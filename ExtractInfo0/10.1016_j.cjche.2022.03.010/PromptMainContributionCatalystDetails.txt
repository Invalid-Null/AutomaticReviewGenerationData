Silicalite-1 zeolite encapsulated Fe nanocatalyst for Fenton-like degradation of methylene blue
Abstract
Encapsulation of Fe nanoparticles in zeolite is a promising way to significantly improve the catalytic activity and stability of Fe-based catalysts during the degradation process of organic pollutants. Herein, Fe nanocatalysts were encapsulated into silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite by using a ligand-protected method (with dicyandiamide (DCD) as a organic ligand) under direct hydrothermal synthesis condition. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) results confirmed the high dispersion of Fe nanocatalysts which were successfully encapsulated within the voids among the primary particles of the S-1 zeolite. The developed S-1 zeolite encapsulated Fe nanocatalyst (Fe@S-1) exhibited significantly improved catalytic activity and reusability in the catalytic degradation process of methylene blue (MB). Specifically, the developed Fe0.021@S-1 catalyst showed high catalytic degradation activity, giving a high MB degradation efficiency of 100% in 30 min, outperformed the conventional impregnated catalyst (Fe/S-1). Moreover, the Fe@S-1 catalyst afforded an outstanding stability, showing only ca. 7.9% activity loss after five cycling tests, while the Fe/S-1 catalyst presented a significantly activity loss of 50.9% after only three cycles. Notably, the encapsulation strategy enabled a relatively lower Fe loading in the Fe@S-1 catalyst in comparison with that of the Fe/S-1 catalyst, i.e., 0.35% vs. 0.81% (mass). Radical scavenging experiments along with electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements confirmed that the major role of OH in the MB degradation process. Specifically, Fe@S-1 catalyst with high molar ratio of [Fe(DCD)]Cl3 is beneficial to form Fe complexes/nanoclusters in the voids (which has large pore size of 1–2 nm) among the primary particles of the zeolite, and thus improving the diffusion and accessibility of reactants to Fe active sites, and thus exhibiting a relatively higher degradation efficiency. This work demonstrates that zeolite-encapsulated Fe nanocatalysts present potential applications in the advanced oxidation of wastewater treatment.

1. Introduction
Fenton-like degradation is one of an advanced oxidation process (AOP) for catalytic elimination of organic pollutants such as dyes (e.g., methylene blue, MB) in wastewater [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. In recent years, application of Fenton-like degradation for organic wastewater treatment is mostly based on heterogeneous catalysts [5], [6]. Many metal-based catalysts have been developed for Fenton-like degradation system in order to efficiently activate H2O2 to produce OH, showing good activity for degrading organic compounds [7], [8]. Among them, Fe-based catalysts have been widely developed because of their high activity, extensive supply as well as low cost [5], [9]. However, heterogeneous Fe-based catalysts still present some drawbacks such as poor accessibility and stability of the active Fe sites [6]. To overcome these limitations, porous materials (e.g., zeolite [6], [10], [11], ordered mesoporous carbon [12]) were used as support for Fe oxide particles in order to reduce the metal particle size, and therefore develop robust catalysts for Fenton-like degradation system. However, for practical application of Fenton-like degradation, it is still challenging to develop a robust heterogeneous Fenton catalyst which has improved metal dispersion and stability.
Zeolites have attracted interest due to their unique structure and properties (such as well-defined microporous channels and excellent hydrothermal stability), being an ideal support to stabilize metal nanoparticles [6], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. However, zeolite supported metal catalysts prepared by simple impregnation methods normally generate relatively larger metal particles with poor dispersion located in zeolite channels and/or on the external surface of zeolite, and thus presenting low activity and stability [14]. One alternative strategy of manipulating the dispersion and particle size of metal sites in zeolite-based catalysts is to in situ encapsulate metal sites during hydrothermal synthesis of zeolite, which could efficiently control the size and location of metal nanoparticles, and therefore improving the stability of metal active sites [18]. Dai et al. [6] employed an “impregnation-dissolution-recrystallization” method to encapsulate highly dispersed Fe-Cu bimetallic oxide nanoparticles within silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite, and the resulting catalyst exhibited high dispersion of Fe-Cu oxide with average particle size of ∼3.7 nm, showing high catalytic activity and low leaching of metal oxide for Fenton-like degradation of phenol. However, this strategy requires a multi-step procedure, as the tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) hydrothermal treatment needed to facilitate the dissolution and recrystallization of zeolite supported catalysts is carried out in a separate step. Recently, many efforts have been devoted to developing simple yet efficient strategies for the encapsulation of metal sites within zeolites [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Cho et al. [18] reported a cationic polymer-assisted method to successfully encapsulate Pt nanocatalysts inside MFI zeolites. Pt@HZSM-5 catalyst exhibited high encapsulation degree of Pt nanoparticles in zeolite (exceeding 90%), giving high selectivity for aldol condensation and hydrogenation, displaying combined yield of 87% for hydrogenated C8 products. Recently, Yu and co-workers prepared sub-nanometer Pd clusters within nanosized S-1 zeolite by using a ligand-stabilized method (employing [Pd(en)2]Cl2 (en = ethylenediamine) as precursor) [13]. The developed catalysts present an excellent activity toward the complete formic acid decomposition to efficiently generated H2 (696 L H2·h−1 (g·Pd)–1).
Herein, we employed a ligand-stabilized method to confine Fe nanoparticles within S-1 zeolite (i.e., Fe@S-1) by using dicyandiamide (C2H4N4, DCD) as an organic ligand. The developed catalysts present outstanding activity and reusability for the Fenton-like degradation of MB.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98%), Ferric chloride (FeCl3·5H2O), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide aqueous solution (TPAOH, 25 %(mass)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30 %(mass)) were supplied from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Dicyandiamide (DCD, (N2H)2CN2), tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), benzoquinone (BQ) were supplied by Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Methylene blue (MB) was purchased from Wuxi Yasheng Chemical Co., Ltd.
2.2. Synthesis of the Fe@S-1 catalysts
Fig. 1 shows the strategy for developing S-1 zeolite encapsulated Fe catalyst. [Fe(DCD)]Cl3 as the precursor was prepared firstly. Specifically, 1.26 g of dicyandiamide was dissolved into 10 ml deionized (DI) water, followed by adding 0.15 g of FeCl3∙5H2O, and the solution was continuously stirred at room temperature (RT). The synthesis gel for Fe@S-1 catalyst was prepared according to different molar composition: 1.0TEOS: 0.4TPAOH: 35H2O: x[Fe(DCD)]Cl3 (x = 0.002, 0.005, 0.014, 0.021, 0.029, respectively) [17]. Typically, 6.5 g of TPAOH solution was firstly added in 7.5 g of DI water, followed by the slow addition of 4.16 g TEOS, and then the solution was stirred for 6 h until fully hydrolyze the TEOS. After that, the prepared [Fe(DCD)]Cl3 solution was added slowly and the solution was stirred for additional 0.5 h. Subsequently, the resulting gel was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, and the hydrothermal synthesis was carried out in an oven at 170 °C for 3 days. After the hydrothermal synthesis, the as-prepared samples were washed with DI water for several times, and then dried at 100 °C overnight, and finally calcined at 550 °C for 6 h in air. The prepared catalysts were named based on the adding amount of Fe, i.e., Fex@S-1 (x = 0.002, 0.005, 0.014, 0.021, 0.029, respectively). In addition, reference catalyst with a nominal Fe loading of 1.0 %(mass) was prepared by conventional incipient wetness impregnation method, i.e., Fe/S-1.

2.3. Characterization of materials
The actual metal content in as-prepared catalysts were measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES 5000, Focused Photonics Inc.). The crystallinity of the samples was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) employed a Smartlab TM 9kw (Rigaku) advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The prepared catalysts were measured using a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20) and corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Raman spectra were measured by using a high-resolution confocal Raman spectrometer with a 50 × LWD objective lens. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were obtained on a Bruker EMX-10/12 to detect the reactive oxygen species (ROS). Specifically, the 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were employed as spin-trap reagent. In addition, radical scavenging experiments were conducted by the addition of a corresponding ROS scavengers during the catalytic degradation process of MB.
2.4. Catalytic degradation performance tests
MB was used to evaluate the degradation efficiency of Fe@S-1 catalysts. Specifically, for each experiment, 50 mg catalyst was added into MB solution (100 ml, 10 mg·L−1) under 60 °C without stirring (the initial pH value was 2). Prior to the addition of H2O2, the suspension was continuously stirred for about 20 min to reach the adsorption and desorption equilibrium between MB and catalyst, followed by adding 4 ml H2O2. At given time intervals, sample (2 ml) was collected and filtered off by using a needle filter (0.22 μm pore size). The supernatant was analyzed by recording variations at 665 nm using a UV-725 UV–visible spectrophotometer (Shanghai Youke Instrument Co., Ltd). To test the reusability of Fe@S-1 catalyst, after each experiment, catalysts were collected from suspension, followed by centrifuging and washing with DI water several times. After that, the recovered catalysts were tested again according to same procedure. The degradation efficiency of MB can be calculated as:

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Characterization of catalysts
As shown in Fig. 1, the nitrogen atoms on nitrile bond (N(1) and N(2)) and imine bond (N(3) and N(4)) in DCD molecule are suitable electron donors to readily interact with Fe due to their lone pair electrons and high charge density. Therefore, Fe3+ could strongly coordinate with DCD molecule to form [Fe(DCD)]Cl3 complex avoiding Fe precipitation in solution. The complex as a precursor could enable the encapsulation of Fe complexes/nanoclusters in zeolite under one-pot hydrothermal synthesis condition. The actual Fe loading in as-prepared Fe@S-1 catalyst along with Fe/S-1 (as reference catalyst) was determined by using ICP-OES, as listed in Table S1 in Supporting Information (SI).
Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectra of Fe@S-1 catalyst (exemplified by Fe0.005@S-1) before and after calcination. As seen in Fig. 2, the band located at ca. 368 cm−1 corresponds to the characteristic of the MFI-type zeolite structure [21]. For the Fe@S-1 catalyst before calcination (Fig. 2(a)), the Raman bands located at ca. 1036, 1102, and 2975 cm−1 could be attributed to the DCD molecule’s CNC symmetric stretching and bending, NCN asymmetric stretching, as well as NH2 stretching, respectively [22]. Significantly, the characteristic band of NCN bending (located at ca. 659 cm−1) shows weak intensity, which should be due to the interaction between Fe species and NCN [22]. However, for the Fe@S-1 catalyst after calcination (Fig. 2(b)), all characteristic peaks related to DCD molecule disappeared due to the burning-out of DCD molecule under high temperature condition, while Fe species were successfully encapsulated in S-1 zeolite. Specifically, after calcination, the intensity of Raman band located at ca. 504 cm−1 (this should be due to isolated FeOSi bonds positioned at extra-framework [23], [24]) decreased significantly, further illustrating Fe species encapsulated in S-1 zeolite. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 2, the bands at ca. 295 and 420 cm−1 (which could be assigned to the Fe2O3 structure [21]) are hardly observed, implying that most of Fe species were well encapsulated in S-1 zeolite.

Fig. 3 shows the powder XRD patterns of as-prepared Fe@S-1 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2, XRD measurements revealed that all Fe-containing catalysts presented the MFI topological structure with several characteristic diffraction peaks (i.e. 2θ = 7.9°, 8.8°, 23.1°, 23.9°, and 24.4°), respectively [25], implying that the lattice distortion was negligible after encapsulating Fe species inside S-1 zeolite [17]. It is worth noting that the characteristic diffraction peaks related to Fe species were not detected, indicating the absence of large Fe particles in the as-prepared Fe@S-1 catalysts.

HRTEM analysis of the Fe@S-1 and Fe/S-1 catalysts were performed to provide the detailed information regarding the location and dispersion of Fe species in the S-1 zeolite, as shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5. Comparative HRTEM images of the Fe@S-1 catalysts with different molar ratio of [Fe(DCD)]Cl3 in the synthesis gel (i.e., 0.005, 0.014, 0.021, 0.029, respectively) shows the typical coffin-like morphology of S-1 zeolite (Fig. 4(a), (d), (g), and (j)). Specifically, by increasing the molar ratio of [Fe(DCD)]Cl3, the particle size of prepared S-1 zeolites gradually increased from ∼ 290 nm to ∼ 500 nm. For Fe0.005@S-1 and Fe0.014@S-1 catalysts (Fig. 4(b), (c), (e) and (f)), TEM analysis showed the transparent S-1 crystals with crystal lattice of ca. 0.58 nm, on which Fe species are hardly identified, indicating that Fe could be atomically incorporated into the MFI-type zeolite framework. Similarly, Yu et al. [17] have proved that single Rh atoms can be encapsulated within 5-membered rings of S-1 zeolite framework by using [Rh(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3]Cl3 complex as a precursor. However, when the molar ratio of [Fe(DCD)]Cl3 increased to 0.021 (Fe0.021@S-1), TEM analysis shows non-transparent S-1 crystal (Fig. 4(h)) and Fe species with crystal lattice of ca. 0.18 nm in S-1 zeolite (Fig. 4(i)), suggesting that Fe complexes/nanoclusters with larger particle size are likely to be formed in the voids among the primary zeolite particles. By increasing the molar ratio up to 0.029 (Fe0.029@S-1), Fe nanoparticles are formed both in the voids among the primary zeolite particles (referred by white arrow in Fig. 4(k)) and on the external surface (with particle size of ∼ 10 nm, referred by red circle in Fig. 4(l)) of S-1 zeolite. For Fe/S-1 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 5(a)−(c), Fe particles with relatively larger particle size (∼9.8 nm) were formed on the external surface of zeolite.

EDS mapping analysis of Fe@S-1 catalyst (Fig. 6) shows the dispersion of different elements (e.g., Fe, referred by red spots). As shown in Fig. 6a and b, Fe element in the Fe0.005@S-1 and Fe0.014@S-1 catalysts was less visible, implying that Fe species in the encapsulated zeolite coating were relatively lower, being in line with the ICP-OES results shown in Table S1 and Fig. S1 in Supplementary Material. However, by increasing the [Fe(DCD)]Cl3 amount in the synthesis gel, Fe element become visible in EDS mapping images of the Fe0.021@S-1 and Fe0.029@S-1 catalysts (Fig. 6(c) and (d)), suggesting the formation of redundant Fe species on the external surface of S-1 zeolite. Additionally, as shown in Fig. S2, the encapsulated Fe@S-1 catalysts have a much lighter red colour compared to bulk impregnated Fe/S-1 catalyst, while the colour gradually turns red by increasing the molar ratio of Fe in catalysts. These results further confirm the formation of redundant Fe species on the external surface of zeolite, which is in accordance with the HRTEM results.

3.2. Catalytic degradation performances of MB over the Fe@S-1 catalysts
We further utilize the MB degradation process to evaluate the activity trends of Fe@S-1 catalyst with H2O2 at a constant temperature of 60 °C (initial MB concentration of 10 mg·L−1, initial solution pH = 2). As shown in Fig. 7(a), the blank experiment using the H2O2 showed the insignificant degradation efficiency of MB. However, the encapsulated Fe0.005@S-1 catalyst exhibited a relatively faster MB degradation process compared to the impregnated Fe/S-1 catalyst with high Fe loading of 0.81% (mass) (Table S1), which is two-fold of that of the Fe0.005@S-1 catalyst (0.35 %(mass)). By comparison, it proves that the encapsulation method gave a relatively low Fe loading (Table S1), but a relatively higher dispersion of Fe species than that of conventional impregnated catalyst (which is confirmed by the HRTEM results in Fig. 5), achieving improved catalytic activity and reusability (which will be discussed later). As shown in Fig. 7(b), by increasing the molar ratio of Fe in encapsulated catalysts up to 0.029, the Fe@S-1 catalysts (with molar ratio of Fe > 0.014) displayed the highest catalytic degradation rate, eliminating the organic compound in 10 min. Additionally, to clearly compare the degradation activities of the Fe@S-1 catalysts with different Fe contents, the catalytic degradation performance evaluation experiments were further performed using a higher initial MB concentration (100 mg·L−1). Clearly, as shown in Fig. 8, the catalytic degradation rate of the Fe@S-1 catalysts significantly increased by increasing of Fe molar ratio from 0.002 to 0.021, suggesting that the increased Fe loading in the encapsulated catalyst benefited the formation of Fe complexes/nanocluster (which is confirmed by the HRTEM results in Fig. 4(a)−(i)) and thus improved the catalytic activity. Specifically, according to TEM results (Fig. 4), when the molar ratio of [Fe(DCD)]Cl3 in the synthesis gel is low (e.g. 0.005, 0.014), Fe could be atomically incorporated into the MFI-type silicalite-1 zeolite framework. The long and narrow pore channels (∼0.55 nm) of S-1 zeolite could limit the diffusion of reactants (i.e. Methylene Blue, H2O2) and products (i.e. CO2 and H2O), and thus inhibiting the accessibility of reactants to Fe active sites. Consequently, these Fe@S-1 catalysts exhibited a relatively poor degradation efficiency. However, when increasing the molar ratio of [Fe(DCD)]Cl3 up to 0.021, Fe complexes/nanoclusters with larger particle size are likely to be formed in the voids (which has larger pore size of 1–2 nm) among the primary particles of the zeolite, which will significantly promote the diffusion and accessibility of reactants to Fe active sites, and enabling a relatively higher degradation efficiency. Notably, when further increasing the molar ratio of Fe up to 0.029, the Fe0.029@S-1 catalyst exhibited a relatively lower degradation rate compared with that of the Fe0.021@S-1 catalyst. This might attribute to the formation of Fe nanoparticles with larger particle size (∼10 nm) on the external surface of S-1 zeolite (Fig. 4(i)−(l)), which could block the pores of voids among the primary zeolite particles and inhibit the accessibility of reactants to Fe active sites with smaller particle size (encapsulated inside zeolite), and thus giving low MB degradation rate.

(Adsorption refers to the insignificant physical adsorption of MB on the Fe@S-1 catalyst).
We further evaluated the catalytic stability of Fe0.005@S-1 catalyst in the degradation of MB by five cycling tests, experiment results were shown in Fig. 9. Clearly, as shown in Fig. 9(a), there is a slight decline of degradation rate from 99.6% to 91.7%, showing ca. 7.9% activity loss after five cycles. However, impregnated Fe/S-1 catalyst exhibited a relatively poor reusability, i.e., the degradation rate significantly decreased from 68.8% to 33.7% after three cycles. These results further demonstrate that the encapsulation of Fe species into S-1 zeolite could significantly improve the stability of Fe active sites, and thus preventing their leaching during the catalytic degradation process. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 9(b), the XRD results confirm that the S-1 zeolite structure of Fe0.005@S-1 catalyst remained rather stable during the cycling MB degradation tests. Additionally, as shown in Table 1, the MB degradation performance of the developed Fe@S-1 catalyst was also compared with that of previously reported catalysts. The Fe@S-1 catalyst demonstrates slightly better catalytic degradation efficiency than the reported catalysts (e.g. graphene supported Fe3O4, Fe3O4/GO, etc), although that the Fe loading (i.e. 0.35 %(mass)) in Fe@S-1 catalyst is significant low.

3.3. Catalytic degradation mechanism of MB over the Fe@S-1 catalyst
To confirm the role of the main active species, the activity of Fe0.005@S-1catalyst was further explored using different scavengers for the OH and O2−, such as tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and p-benzoquinone (BQ) [4]. As shown in Fig. 10(a), in the presence of BQ, the degradation rate of MB was still up to ca. 80% in 60 min, which suggests that the O2− could not be the main active species for the MB degradation. However, in the presence of TBA, the catalytic MB degradation rate significantly declined to ca. 50% in 60 min, indicating that the OH should be the major reactive species. ESR spin trap was also used to confirm the radicals generated by the Fe@S-1 catalyst during the MB degradation process, with DMPO as a radical trapper, and the results are shown in Fig. 10(b). Clearly, the ESR spin trap results demonstrated the DMPO−OH peaks with strong intensities generated by the Fe0.005@S-1catalyst, confirming the key role of OH during the MB degradation process. Additionally, the characteristic peaks of DMPO−O2− with weak intensities were also detected.

Fig. 10. (a) Catalytic degradation performances of MB over the Fe0.005@S-1 catalyst with the addition of ·OH and O2− scavenger, and (b) ESR measurements were carried out (OH and O2– were trapped by DMPO in aqueous solution). Experimental conditions: [MB] = 10 mg·L−1, [catalyst] = 500 mg·L−1, [H2O2] = 4 mmol·L−1, [DMPO] = 100 mmol·L−1.
Based on the above findings, the possible mechanism was proposed and shown in Fig. 11. Typically, during the catalytic degradation process, the MB and H2O2 molecules diffused in the voids (which has large pore size of 1–2 nm) among the primary particles of the zeolite and interacted with Fe(Ⅱ) species from Fe complexes/nanoclusters which were encapsulated in the Fe@S-1, following by the rapid formation of Fe(III) and OH (Eqs. (2), (3)). Subsequently, the OH radicals will readily attack the MB molecules which already diffused into the voids, and thus producing small molecules, which were fully destroyed into CO2 and H2O. Meanwhile, the Fe(III) species will be also reduced by H2O2 to generate Fe(II) and O2– species (Eq. (4)), ensuring the recycling formation of Fe(II) species [26]. However, for the catalysts with low molar ratio of [Fe(DCD)]Cl3, the diffusion and accessibility of reactants and products to Fe active sites could be significantly limited due to that most of Fe species were atomically incorporated into the zeolite framework, and thus exhibiting a relatively lower degradation efficiency.

4. Conclusions
In heterogeneous Fenton-like degradation process, the leaching of Fe species is the main reason of the poor activity and stability of the catalysts as well as secondary pollution, which is considered a major challenge for practical application of wastewater treatment technology. Zeolite-encapsulated metallic catalysts as promising alternatives to the conventional impregnated catalysts show the potential for intensifying the advanced oxidation processes. In this work, Fe nanocatalysts are encapsulated within S-1 zeolite using a ligand-protected method with dicyandiamide as an organic ligand, then used for intensifying the catalytic degradation process of MB. Comparative HRTEM characterization of the zeolite encapsulated Fe nanocatalysts showed that the in situ encapsulation strategy can prepare highly-dispersed and ultrasmall Fe nanoparticles. Notably, the encapsulation strategy also enabled a relatively lower Fe loading in the Fe@S-1 catalyst in comparison with that of the impregnated Fe/S-1 catalyst, i.e., 0.35% vs. 0.81 %(mass). The encapsulated Fe@S-1 catalyst demonstrated excellent catalytic activity and durability, outperformed the bulk Fe/S-1 catalyst prepared by impregnation method. Specifically, the Fe@S-1 catalyst showed high catalytic MB degradation efficiency of 100% in 30 min and good stability (only ∼ 7.9% activity loss after five cycling tests). In addition, radical scavenging experiments and following ESR measurements indicated the major role of OH in the MB degradation process. The degradation mechanism of MB over the encapsulated Fe@S-1 catalyst was also proposed. During the catalytic degradation process, the MB and H2O2 molecules diffused in the voids (which has large pore size of 1–2 nm) among the primary particles of the zeolite and interact with Fe(Ⅱ) species from Fe complexes/nanoclusters which were encapsulated in the Fe@S-1 with high molar ratio of [Fe(DCD)]Cl3. However, when the molar ratio of [Fe(DCD)]Cl3 is very low, the diffusion and accessibility of reactants and products to Fe active sites could be significantly limited due to that most of Fe species were atomically incorporated into the zeolite framework, and thus exhibiting a relatively lower degradation efficiency. The developed zeolite encapsulated Fe nanocatalysts can be further explored to overcome the challenging limitations normally encountered in Fenton-like degradation, e.g., poor catalysts durability with high metal leaching, and thus being further explored for advanced catalytic oxidation process for practical wastewater treatment process.

    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
