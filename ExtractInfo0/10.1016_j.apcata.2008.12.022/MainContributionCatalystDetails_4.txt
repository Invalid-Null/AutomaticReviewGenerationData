 Based on the document, this manuscript discusses propane dehydrogenation (PDH), specifically comparing normal PDH to PDH combined with selective hydrogen combustion.

The main catalyst mentioned is Pt-Sn/Zn-Al-O. It is a bimetallic alloy catalyst composed of platinum (Pt) and tin (Sn) supported on zinc aluminate (Zn-Al-O). The active species are Pt and Sn. Zn is added as a promoter. 

The conversion types mentioned are oxygen conversion (~95%) and propane conversion. For PDH combined with selective hydrogen combustion, the propane conversion was higher than the equilibrium conversion for normal PDH (28% at 500°C), with the highest propane conversion achieved using Pt-Sn/Zn-Al-O.

The selectivity for propylene was almost complete at 99.8%. Stability and deactivation rates were not explicitly mentioned. 

The feed composition was propane and helium at a 1:2 ratio for normal PDH. For PDH combined with combustion, the feed ratio was equilibrium composition of normal PDH at 500°C (C3H8:C3H6:H2 = 0.72:0.28:0.28) plus air and helium, with O2:H2 ratio of 1:2 to 1:4.

The addition of Sn and Zn improved selectivity and stability compared to unmodified Pt/Al2O3. Pt-Sn/Zn-Al-O achieved higher propane conversion than equilibrium conversion for normal PDH due to selective hydrogen combustion.

The key advancement is achieving propane conversion higher than equilibrium for conventional PDH by combining dehydrogenation with selective hydrogen combustion over Pt-Sn/Zn-Al-O catalyst.

Based on the description, this is a PDH process without an oxidizing agent present for normal PDH. For PDH combined with combustion, air is added as an oxidizing agent to combust hydrogen.
