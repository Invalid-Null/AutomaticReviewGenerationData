Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation is an attractive alternative for propylene production to petroleum-based routes. However, overcoming deactivation and toxicity of catalysts in propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH), and over oxidation in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) remain challenging. Here, a chromium-based catalyst supported on a Ce-Zr solid solution is constructed for chemical looping oxidative propane dehydrogenation (CL-ODHP). A dual modulation of oxygen species by Zr doping was unraveled by characterizations and DFT calculation: the oxygen of surface CrOx was constrained while the oxygen mobility of the Ce-Zr support was promoted. Based on these properties, the interaction between surface CrOx and the support further enables an oxygen “donor–acceptor”, which potentially functions as in situ activation and regeneration of redox CrOx species as well as blockage of non-selective oxygen released from the Ce-Zr support. The optimized material (7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2) achieves propane conversion up to 50% and propylene yield of 31% at 600 °C, and has the lowest Cr content among previously reported Cr-based catalysts that have comparable performance. These results provide insights for the design of highly active and selective redox catalysts for chemical looping as a reaction engineering strategy for the upgrading of propane dehydrogenation processes.
1. Introduction
Propylene is a versatile building block for the production of a wide spectrum of commodity chemicals. Currently in the industry, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and light oil (Sattler et al., 2014). However, propylene only accounts for a small fraction of the cracking products in these processes. Propane dehydrogenation is a more direct route for propylene production with much higher process selectivity (Dow retrofitting cracker in plaquemine, 2019). In addition, with the depletion of petroleum resources, as well as the booming production of shale gas, propane dehydrogenation has become increasingly attractive driven by both costs and efficiency incentives (Li et al., 2021).
Generally, there are three categories for current propane dehydrogenation technologies: a) direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH), b) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with O2 co-feed, and c) propane dehydrogenation assisted by mild oxidants (mainly CO2). Among these techniques, oxidative dehydrogenation is free of thermodynamic limitation and produces less carbon deposition (Kotanjac et al., 2010, Carrero et al., 2014). Nevertheless, propane and propylene are prone to over oxidation in the presence of gas-phase oxygen, resulting in the formation of undesired COx (CO2/CO). The use of CO2 assists dehydrogenation by shifting the reaction equilibrium toward dehydrogenation via hydrogen consumption of the reversed water gas shift reaction (RWGS) (Atanga et al., 2018, Chen et al., 2021, Xing et al., 2022). However, breaking the thermodynamic barrier for this process is even more difficult than that for direct dehydrogenation due to the high stability of CO2. Thus far, only the PDH technique has been successfully commercialized.
Among the reported PDH catalysts so far, Pt-based materials are highly active and allow long-term operation (Vajda et al., 2009, Lobera et al., 2010, Marcinkowski et al., 2018). However, apart from the high price of Pt, industrial processes often resort to chlorine to regenerate the sintered Pt-based catalysts, resulting in environmental pollution (Otroshchenko et al., 2021). Recently, Ga-based materials have been demonstrated to be effective for hydrocarbon activation (Phadke et al., 2019). Unfortunately, the generally low propane conversion obtained with Ga-based catalysts has limited their further upgrading and application. The Cr-based material is another extensively studied PDH catalyst category owing to their high activity, low cost, and simple preparation (Weckhuysen and Schoonheydt, 1999, Salaeva et al., 2020). This typical PDH material is also reported for ODHP application (Puurunen and Weckhuysen, 2002). However, they are criticized for the toxicity, and is also subject to deactivation. Therefore, achieving low Cr loading, high thermochemical stability, and long-term operation are major challenges in the upgrade of Cr-based catalysts.
With respect to the catalysts adopted in ODHP, vanadium-based catalysts are the most widely investigated (Otroshchenko et al., 2021). As a matter of fact, compared to developing the catalyst itself under the conventional frame of O2/C3H8 co-feeding ODHP, it would be more promising to focus on reaction engineering aspects if greater progresses are to made. (Otroshchenko et al., 2021). As known, the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes promoted by metal oxide catalysts usually follows the Mars van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism (Routray et al., 2004, You et al., 2017) — the DH reaction proceeds on the surface oxygen (coordinated with the active metal) followed by extracted -H being released as H2O. Meanwhile, these species are regenerated by dissociation of the co-fed gas-phase O2. Since the DH activity is very weakly dependent on oxygen partial pressure (Venegas et al., 2018); many such catalysts used in O2 co-fed ODHP can also be operated under oxygen-free conditions, making it possible for the application of chemical looping. As a substitution of O2 co-feed, the alternate propane/O2 flows of CL mode circumvent direct contact of these gases, and ensure regenerative on-stream oxygen supply (Gao et al., 2019, Hakuli et al., 2000). Apart from V-based catalysts, Cr-based catalysts were also reported for the ODH mode. It is generally acknowledged that while Cr3+ species are active for non-oxidative PDH, Cr6+ species possess MvK features for ODH operation.
The aforementioned cyclic redox mode for propylene production, i.e. chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CL-ODHP) that the present study has adapted is illustrated in Fig. 1. The conventionally simultaneous redox reaction (associated with DH) and oxygen dissociation in conventional ODHP are spatially separated as a result. The concept of chemical looping as an approach of process intensification, is now applied in various production processes far beyond combustion that it originated from. It has drawn increasing interests recently because of the inherent air and products separation, and energy/cost reduction (Zhu et al., 2020, Zeng et al., 2018, Tian et al., 2022, Kelling et al., 2012). CL-ODHP was initially achieved under pulse and fluidized conditions with V-based catalysts by Rostom and de Lasa, 2017, Hossain, 2017). More recently, a Mo-modified VOx material was reported to have high activity and cyclic stability under CL operation. The enhanced propylene selectivity was attributed to the higher V-O binding energy upon Mo modification (Chen et al., 2019).

Fig. 1. The process of CL-ODHP proceeding on the proposed yCr/Ce1−xZrxO2 redox catalyst.
In this study, a Cr-based catalyst supported on Ce-Zr solid solution is specially designed for CL-ODHP. The Ce-Zr oxide is intended as an oxygen reservoir for the redox Cr species, which possesses high redox activity, as well as sintering resistance and high specific surface area required for a support material to enable high dispersion of surface species, making it an ideal material for the proposed strategy. By catalyst composition modulation and operating condition optimization, the screened redox catalyst possesses high activity and stable cycling performance. Characterization and computational analysis have revealed that Zr doping to the CeO2 support has a dual modulation of oxygen species: constraining the oxygen mobility of surface CrOx, while the improving oxygen donating capacity of the support. Meanwhile, an oxygen “donor–acceptor” mechanism was found to have potentially helped maintain activity without lowering propylene selectively.
2. Experimental
2.1. Redox catalyst preparation.
The Ce1−xZrxO2 solid solution supports were prepared by a sol–gel method, where × is the molar ratio of Zr/(Zr + Ce) (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3). In a typical synthesis, stoichiometric amounts of zirconium nitrate (Macklin, AR), and cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate (Aladdin, 99.5% purity) were dissolved in deionized water. Citric acid monohydrate (Sinopharm, Ltd, 99.5% purity) was then added to the total metal ions in the solution at a molar ratio of 1:1. After being stirred at 50 °C for 30 min, ethylene glycol (Sinopharm, Ltd, 99.5% purity) was introduced into the solution at a mole ratio of 1.5:1 to citric acid. The solution was then kept at 80 °C under vigorous stirring until it turned into viscous gel. The gel was dried at 110 °C overnight and calcined at 600 °C for 4 h.
The Cr-modified Ce1−xZrxO2 samples with various chromium loadings (1 wt%, 2 wt%, 5 wt%, 7.5 wt%, 9 wt% and 13 wt%) were prepared by the incipient wet impregnation method. Samples are denoted as yCr/Ce1−xZrxO2, where y is the weight ratio of CrOx (calculated with Cr2O3) to the whole redox catalyst. In a typical preparation, a stoichiometric amount of chromium (III) nitrate nonahydrate (Sinopharm, Ltd, 99.0%) was dissolved and dropwise added onto the Ce1−xZrxO2 support. Afterwards, the mixture was dried and calcinated at 500 °C for 2 h. The calcinated catalyst was crushed, grinded, and sieved into 15–75 mesh.
2.2. Reaction test condition and data analysis
CL-ODHP tests were operated in a fixed-bed quartz U-tube reactor loaded with 0.5 g of redox catalyst under atmospheric pressure. An automatic gas switching system was deployed to achieve continuous redox cycling. The reactions were conducted at 600 °C and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 6000 h−1 except where otherwise specified. The gas stream was 20 vol% propane and 20 vol% oxygen (both diluted with Ar) for the reduction and oxidation steps, respectively, at a total flowrate of 50 mL/min. A typical redox cycle consists of a 7 min reduction step, a 5 min purging step, and a 15 min oxidation step. The catalyst was heated from room temperature to 600 °C in air flow at a ramping rate of 10 °C/min and held for 10 min before switching to purging and subsequently to redox cycling.
As a comparison to the redox reaction mode, the continuous propane feed reaction test consists of 6 reduction steps of 7 min spaced apart by 25 min purging steps (to be consistent with the redox mode) and a 30 min oxidation step in the end; other conditions were identical to those for the redox test. Here, the carbon deposition amount obtained from oxidation is a total over all six consecutive reduction steps. Given the fact that carbon deposition shows a generally proportional correlation with conversion in the present study, the carbon deposition attributed to each reduction step was approximated as a weighted average of total carbon according to propane conversion.
The exhaust gas during the reduction step was collected in a gas bag and then analyzed by a Fuli GC9720plus gas chromatograph (GC). The GC was equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) for hydrocarbon analysis and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for H2 and COx analysis. Carbon deposition was quantified based on the COx signal observed by a Hiden HPR-20 online mass spectrometer (MS) in the oxidation step. Carbon deposition was incorporated into the calculation of propane conversion and product selectivity using the following equations:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
where
is the volume of propane converted to gaseous carbon products
(x is the number of carbon atoms contained in a specific product molecule) including COx, with all products normalized to C3.
is the percentage of product
in total gas products determined by GC, e.g.,
stands for the percentage of ethane and ethylene in the exhaust gas.
is the total volume of inlet propane, and
is the volume of propane converted to coke (calculated based on the COx MS signal in the oxidation step).
is the total volume of gaseous carbon products in the exhaust gas.
is the volume of unconverted propane, which can be calculated according to Eq. (1).
The above methods were verified by checking the carbon balance, which was close to 100%.
2.3. Redox catalyst characterization.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted using an Panalytical Empyrean diffractometer, with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HSTEM) images were obtained with a Tecnai G2 F30 field emission transmission electron microscope. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping were obtained on a Zeiss Sigma 300 SEM instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) patterns were recorded on an ThermoFisher ESCALAB 250Xi analyzer. Carbon calibration was done by C 1s scan peaked at 284.8 eV as the reference. Raman spectra were collected using a ThermoFisher DXR spectrometer with a 532 nm Ar ion laser.
H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) tests were carried out on a SETARAM SETSYS EVO thermogravimetric analyzer using a 10 vol% H2/Ar flow at a total flowrate of 40 mL/min. Prior to the test, samples were pretreated in 20 vol% O2/Ar flow at 600 °C for 1 h and then cooled down to room temperature in Ar flow. TPR tests were then conducted at a ramping rate of 10 °C/min from room temperature to 700 °C. The surface acidity was determined by NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920. In a typical run, 0.1 g sample was pretreated in Ar for 2 h and then saturated with 5 vol% NH3 (total flowrate of 50 mL/min) for 1 h. The saturated sample was then purged with Ar for another 1 h to eliminate physically adsorbed or unadsorbed NH3. Desorption was conducted from room temperature to 750 °C in a 50 mL/min Ar flow at a ramping rate of 10 °C/min, recorded by a TCD detector.
2.4. Computational methods.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. More computational details can be found in Supporting Information.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Composition and structure characterization.
XRD patterns for all as-prepared yCr/Ce1−xZrxO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 2a, b. For the chromium loaded samples, only Ce-Zr solid solution phase is observed when the Cr loading is lower than 7.5 wt% (Fig. 2a). Cr2O3 phase is detected at 7.5 wt% (or higher) chromium loading, which is in accordance with previously reported XRD and Raman results (Wang et al., 2010). It is commonly accepted that at high chromium loading levels, CrOx tends to exist as Cr2O3, which is highly crystalline, inert, and extremely stable (Sim et al., 2017, Moriceau et al., 2000). Thus, the maximum amount of CrOx species with dehydrogenation activity corresponds to an optimum for Cr loading, which will be further discussed in later section of catalyst performance evaluation. Moreover, the peak shifting pattern of Ce1−xZrxO2 samples with different × values agrees well with that of standard PXRD (PDF#01-077-8791, PDF#01-080-6314 and PDF#01075-9467 of Ce0.9Zr0.1O2, Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 and Ce0.69Zr0.31O2, respectively). This indicates the incorporation of Zr4+ into Ce lattice of different degrees and formation of corresponding solid solutions, which results in change in lattice constants and shift of diffraction angles.

HRTEM images of the 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalyst are shown in Fig. 2c, d. Fig. 2c indicates the catalyst consists of nanoparticles with a size distribution of 5–10 nm. In Fig. 2d, well-defined lattice structures with interplanar spacing of 0.312 and 0.198 nm, which are attributed to (1 1 1) and (2 2 0) planes of the doped CeO2, respectively. They agree with those of previously reported Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 solid solutions (Zheng et al., 2016). The (0 1 2) plane of Cr2O3 is also observed as indicated by the 0.340 nm spacing. However, we fail to find structures that match with ZrO2. In addition, EDS (energy dispersive spectrometer) mapping in Fig. S10c shows Cr species of even smaller sizes are abundantly scattered on the catalyst surface. The above results confirm the formation of Ce-Zr solid solutions, and that the catalyst surface is composed of crystalline Cr2O3 and Ce-Zr solid solution covered by highly dispersed Cr species.
3.2. Dehydrogenation performance
As shown in Fig. 3a, the propane conversion generally increases with increasing Cr loading within 1–7.5 wt%. Further increasing the Cr loading does not perceptibly raise propane conversion but does cause a decrease in propylene selectivity. This is because the amount of well-dispersed active Cr species increases with Cr loading only up to 7.5 wt%, as indicated by XRD patterns of the catalysts. Further loading leads to the formation of inert Cr2O3 as well as non-selective Cr clusters, therefore leaving the amount of active Cr practically unchanged.

Fig. 3. (a) Performance of yCr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 with varied Cr loadings. (b), (c) Performance 7.5Cr/Ce1−xZrxO2 with varied Ce/Zr ratios. Reaction conditions: 600 °C; GHSV = 6000 h−1; flowrate at 50 mL/min with 20 vol% C3H8/Ar; 0.5 g sample; 7 min reduction. The error bars represent the standard deviation and mean from three repeats. Reactivity data in all Fig.s is the overall level (average) of the reduction step, while instantaneous data (the 6th min time on stream) can be found in Figs. S4 and S5 in the Supporting Information.
As shown in Fig. 3b, c, with the increase of Zr content, the propane conversion decreases while selectivity toward propylene is improved. 7.5Cr/Ce0.7Zr0.3O2 and 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 show obviously lower COx selectivity compared to 7.5Cr/Ce0.9Zr0.1O2. This is enabled by the moderated oxygen mobility of the surface CrOx species at higher Zr doping, which will be discussed later in detail by characterization and computational results. In addition, as compared with the 7.5Cr/CeO2 sample (Fig. 3c), a profound increase in propylene yield (overall level of 7 min) is achieved by the Zr-enhanced 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalyst (the overall/average level of the 7-min reduction step from ∼ 21.2% to ∼ 28.0%). For reference, a typical gas profile during the oxidation step is shown in Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information. The blank test results obtained with α-Al2O3 shown in Fig. 3a confirm little contribution from gas phase cracking under the tested temperature condition. The reaction conditions (t = 600 °C and GHSV = 6000 h−1) used in the above tests were obtained by tests under temperature from 550 to 650 °C and GHSV from 3000 to 6000 h−1, see Fig. S3 in the Supporting Information for detailed reaction data.
Moreover, as shown in Figs. S4–S6 in the Supporting Information, the 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalyst possesses instantaneous propane conversion up to 50.0% and propylene yield up to 31.4% at the 6th min time on stream in the first cycle and maintains about 30% instantaneous yield over the first 10 cycles. Activity dynamics with time on stream in a typical reduction step is evaluated by the propane signal of the exhaust gas detected by the mass spectrometer and shown in Fig. S2 in the Supporting Information, which shows stable performance during the 7-min reduction step.
The cyclic stability of the 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalyst was further evaluated in 50 redox cycles, as shown in Fig. 4a. No deactivation of significance is observed during the 6 h reaction time with propane. In the continuous propane feeding test (without periodic regeneration by CL), however, propane conversion sharply decreases by over 50% in 15 min time on stream and is then almost depleted by 20 min. (Fig. 4b). The striking contrast between redox cycling and continuous feeding demonstrates the significant improvement that chemical looping reaction mode can offer for mid-to-long term ODHP performance.

(b) The performance of continuous propane feeding reaction. Reaction conditions: 600 °C; GHSV = 6000 h−1; flowrate at 50 mL/min with 20 vol% C3H8/Ar; 0.5 g sample; 7 min reduction, 5 min purging (and 15 min oxidation for redox cycling).
As shown in Fig. S6 (detailed product distribution of the first 10 redox cycles), there is a significance decrease in the formation of COx from the first cycle to the second, in consistency with the change in surface species that the redox Cr6+ deceased and was irreversibly converted to crystalline Cr2O3 and non-oxidative Cr3+ indicated by Raman and XPS results (Figs. 6a and S7). This is followed by slight but continued decrease of COx selectivity to the 10th cycle. It also should be noted that decreased formation of CH4 and coke also contributed to the dramatic increase in propylene selectivity from cycle 1 to 2 shown in Fig. 4a. This could also be well explained by the agglomeration of Cr species which has led to a lowered site concentration. C–C scission is therefore less favorable on the surface of the cycled redox catalyst.
3.3. Comparison with other catalysts and processes
Fig. 5 compares the performance of the proposed 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalyst with previously reported representative Cr-based catalysts. To obtain a more practical, comprehensive assessment of the C3H6 productivity of reported Cr-based catalysts, the actual gas configuration and Cr loading is taken into account and a metric of Cr-normalized C3H6 formation rate is established. Meanwhile, deactivation rate constant (kd) is used to present a quantified comparison of stability. The synergy effect of Cr and Zr has been reported on different catalysts in recent years. The 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 has a 2-fold C3H6 formation rate than the Cr2O3(2)-ZrO2/SBA-15 (Zhang et al., 2002) and far better operation stability than the 8 wt%CrZr5K0.5 (Wegrzyniak et al., 2017).

The commercial Catofin process and the one presented in the current work seem quite similar superficially as they (1) both uses supported Cr material, and (2) adapt a cyclic operation mode. However, there are a few unique features of our proposed process that make it essentially different from the Catofin process. First of all, mechanistically, Catofin is typically a non-oxidative PDH process (C3H8
C3H6 + H2). The main process discussed in this work, on the other hand, is oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODHP). PDH and ODHP are essentially different because ODH involves mass transfer processes (gas phase oxygen dissociation and redox reaction) and usually significant CO2/H2O formation. The key of chemical looping mode is that it spatially separates the conventionally simultaneous mass transfer processes – oxygen dissociation and H2O (CO2) formation, in O2 co-feeding ODHP, into two reaction steps. As such, the regeneration step in the chemical looping mode is a substitution of the co-fed oxygen in conventional ODH operation and regenerates reduced CrOx species, rather than merely for coke removal in the Catofin process. Also because of that, the CL-mode applies a much higher shifting frequency between dehydrogenation and regeneration than Catofin or other general DH operations (reaction time of 7 min here and up to 20 min of Catofin). From this point, the regeneration of CL should be regarded as in situ or an “on stream” reaction sub-step instead of an independent regeneration after a reaction time-on-stream.
Under laboratory conditions, the 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalyst has a 1.5-fold Cr-normalized formation rate (defined as mmol C3H6 gCr-1h−1) relative to an analogue of the Catofin catalyst (Han et al., 2020). The nominal Cr loading of Catofin catalyst used in industrial scenarios is 18 wt% or more, which is almost 2.5-fold as much as that of our 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2.
3.4. Revealing CrOx species and reaction evolution
The Raman spectra obtained for the fresh and spent 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalysts are displayed in Fig. 6a. Peaks at 358 cm−1 and 877 cm−1 are assigned to symmetric stretching and bending vibration of monochromate species (VI), respectively (Vuurman et al., 1993). The peak at ∼1000 cm−1 is attributed to the dehydrated form of the same monochromate species produced by the heat of laser. The ∼850 cm−1 peak is indicative of trichromate species (Cr3O102-). All three species are typical redox CrOx (Cr6+) which are generally considered as active sites for oxidative propane dehydrogenation. They all show a weakened intensity in the spectrum of the spent catalyst, implying their involvement in the ODHP reaction and partly irreversible reduction in the first 10 redox cycles. Previous in situ UV–vis studies of supported Cr catalysts for ODHP also reported diminishing band of Cr6+ species during propane feeding and its intensifying band during regeneration (Puurunen and Weckhuysen, 2002). But the catalyst still exhibits stable activity for up to 50 cycles. This might suggest that oxidative dehydrogenation dominates in the early stage of redox cycling and is moderated and stabilized in the long-term cycling. Although Raman spectra did not show observable band indicative of dispersed Cr3+ species, the diminished part of Cr6+ species is likely to be converted irreversibly to Cr3+ species associated with PDH, as the catalyst exhibits stable performance in the long-term cycling. The 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 sample pretreated with H2 were also tested for further confirmation. The decreased propane conversion and increased propylene selectivity relative to the standard reference were similarly attained over the H2-pretreated sample (Table S1 in the Supporting Information), which is a sign of shift toward non-oxidative dehydrogenation. Moreover, the coexistence of Cr3+and Cr6+ species is confirmed by Cr 2p XPS scan and a decrease of Cr6+ is observed on the catalyst after 10 redox cycles relative to the as-prepared one (Fig. S9). Therefore, PDH and ODHP coexist in a dynamic state and gradually stabilize as cycling proceeds, and propylene selectivity increases while propane conversion decreases as a consequence of a lowered proportion of contribution of ODH to the overall reaction.
In addition, the intense band at ∼ 473 cm−1 is attributed to the symmetric stretching of the cubic fluorite structure of CeO2, which is intensified after 10 redox cycles due to particle/cluster agglomeration, as also supported by SEM images in Fig. S10a,b in the Supporting Information. Another intense band appears at ∼ 555 cm−1, which is characteristic of crystalline Cr2O3 and is further intensified after reaction (Vuurman and Wachs, 1992). Combined with the decrease of Cr6+ species from XPS, we believe this is the reason for a lowered surface Cr/Ce ratio (0.388 to 0.259), as the agglomeration of originally highly dispersed Cr6+ species or clusters has led to less Cr exposure. The ∼ 617 cm−1 band, indicative of Ce3+, is diminished in the spent catalyst. Note that polymeric Cr3+ and isolated Cr6+ species also have a characteristic Raman shift nearby (He et al., 2018). This possibility is, however, excluded by the Ce 3d XPS spectra of the spent catalyst, which exhibits a decrease in Ce3+ proportion (Fig. S7a in the Supporting Information).
3.5. Mechanistic insights: Zr doping, and interaction between CrOx and Ce1−xZrxO2
3.5.1. Oxygen vacancy — Starting from the outer layer
The Ce 3d XPS spectra of the fresh 7.5Cr/Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 and 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 samples are shown in Fig. 6b and c, respectively. Both spectra indicate the coexistence of Ce4+ and Ce3+ species. Table S3a in the Supporting Information lists the proportion of Ce3+ (referred to as Ce3+% hereinafter) which is known to be related to oxygen vacancy (Trogadas et al., 2012); of the 7.5 wt% Cr samples at varied Zr doping level. It can be seen from the ∼ 901.4 eV peaks that the Ce3+% increases significantly from 7.5Cr/Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 to 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2. Further increasing the Zr content from Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 to Ce0.7Zr0.3O2, however, leads to a minor Ce3+% decrease, as indicated by the Ce 3d spectrum of the 7.5Cr/Ce0.7Zr0.3O2 sample in Fig. S7b and Table S3a in the Supporting Information. This is possibly a result of the non-uniform distribution of zirconium in the lattice of CeO2 at high doping level. In addition, the Zr 3d5/2 peaks of the three samples all shift toward lower binding energy relative to that of a ZrO2 reference (182.6 eV) as shown in Fig. S8 (Faqeeh et al., 2018). A further shift of ∼ 0.1 eV is observed from 7.5Cr/Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 to 7.5Cr/Ce0.7Zr0.3O2. This is also reportedly due to oxygen vacancy (Dongare et al., 2002). The richness in oxygen vacancy indicated by the above observations would result in more strongly-bonded oxygen on the support surface that has potentially led to lower COx selectivity (7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 <(slightly) 7.5Cr/Ce0.7Zr0.3O2 < 7.5Cr/Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 as shown in Fig. 3b). The O 1 s spectra (Fig. 6d-f and Table S3b in the Supporting Information) provide additional evidence by revealing that the 7.5Cr/Ce0.7Zr0.3O2 sample has the least weakly bonded oxygen species (characterized by the ∼531.5 eV peak), which is considered to be liable to cause over oxidation of hydrocarbons (Gao et al., 2016). Moreover, the presence of surface oxygen vacancies also favors the dissociation of O2 in the oxidation step, benefiting the redox stability of the catalyst.
The above discussion concerning the effects of Zr doping on the oxygen coordinating properties of Ce provides explanation for the difference in selectivity. Yet it is inadequate since the dominant active components for dehydrogenation are surface chromium oxides rather than the bulk Ce-Zr solid solution, as bare Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 has very limited activity (Fig. 3a). Moreover, although XPS has identified the difference in the surface oxygen, it is an overall result of all O atoms bonding with either chromium and ceria. It is thus unclear which of them is more constrained. H2-TPR were therefore conducted to help obtain such information that is pivotal to understand the interaction of the surface CrOx, and the bulk Ce-Zr solid solution.
3.5.2. Redox properties: Insights into the interaction between CrOx and Ce-Zr support
H2-TPR profiles of the samples with varied Zr contents and Cr loadings are presented in Fig. 6g. Profiles of bare Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 and 7.5Cr/α-Al2O3 are shown in Fig. S11. Both 7.5Cr/Ce0.7Zr0.3O2 and 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 samples exhibit two distinct reduction peaks centered at ∼360 °C and ∼520 °C, which are attributed to the reduction of chromium and ceria oxides, respectively (Chen et al., 2019). The Cr reduction peaks of the samples show a decreasing trend in magnitude with increasing Zr amount, indicating less facile oxygen release on the catalyst doped with more Zr that potentially inhibits COx formation. However, as can be seen, the reduction degree of ceria oxides increases with Zr doping. The H2-TPR profile of the 7.5Cr/Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 exhibits an extremely flat and wide ceria reduction peak ranging from 500 ºC to 700 ºC in contrast to the well-defined peaks of the 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 and 7.5Cr/Ce0.7Zr0.3O2. This can be regarded as a result of improved oxygen mobility and oxygen donating capacity resulting from oxygen vacancy induced by appropriate Zr doping, since these defects function as an internal force for the movement of oxygen (Zheng et al., 2016). Therefore, the increase of more constrained oxygen species observed from XPS might mainly be oxygen of CrOx rather than that of ceria.
Based on the fact that ceria oxides are covered by chromium, if the solid solution support has sufficient oxygen donating capability, the generation and/or regeneration of surface chromium oxides will be no longer dependent on gaseous oxygen, but rather utilizes oxygen donated by the solid solution support and species with high dehydrogenation activity is generated in situ. The reduced CrOx species can be regarded as “oxygen acceptors”, while the Ce-Zr support is the oxygen “reservoir”. This lattice oxygen transfer mechanism between surface active material and bulk material of composite redox catalysts were reported in previous studies (Brady et al., 2017, Marek et al., 2020, Tian et al., 2020, Neal et al., 2014); and is verified in this work to be highly liable to occur on the proposed 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 by DFT calculation. As a result, Zr doping enhanced ODH activity without impairing selectivity to propylene because of the CrOx’s capability of capturing oxygen released from the support.
Additionally, the profile of 13Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 remains largely unchanged in comparison with that of 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2, in consistency with their similar reactivity. Although it has been explained by XRD results that Cr2O3 is formed at high loadings, it is still quite unusual that reactivity hardly changes within such large loading range. However, it is also very likely to be the result of the interaction mechanism of oxygen transfer between surface Cr species and the bulk material, freeing the ODH activity from the restriction of Cr quantity. It is thus a possible route to reduce Cr loading and meanwhile retaining high activity.
3.6. Acidity and CrOx anchoring
NH3-TPD results shown in Fig. 6h reveal two desorption peaks centered at ∼440.4 °C and ∼612.7 °C, which are attributed to medium and strong acid sites, respectively, with comparable quantities over the 7.5Cr/CeO2 sample (Table S4 in the Supporting Information). After a small amount of Zr doping, the 7.5Cr/Ce0.9Zr0.1O2 sample did not show the high temperature peak. Instead, acid sites concentrate at ∼ 457.4 °C and another peak characterizing sites with even weaker acidity appears at ∼ 260.9 °C. The acidic properties of the samples clearly explain the reaction test results, that a large amount of carbon deposition is observed on the 7.5Cr/CeO2 catalyst (Table S2 in the Supporting Information), but is significantly suppressed upon Zr doping to CeO2. This also coincides with DFT computational results that CrOx clusters are more apt to bind on the Zr-doped support surface than that on pure CeO2, due to the fact that the –OH species of strong acid sites can be exchanged by the anchored CrOx (Sharma et al., 2022). Thus, Zr doping substantially tunes the surface acidity distribution of CeO2 and consequently improves the resistance against coke formation of the catalyst (Gao et al., 2019).
3.7. Computational results
DFT calculations are carried out to further understand the effect of Zr doping on the performance of the redox catalysts. A relatively stable CrO2 structure coordinated with the O atoms of the CeO2 (1 1 1) surface is chosen as the model (see the Supporting Information for more computational details) (Nolan and Ganduglia-Pirovano, 2016). The binding energy of the chromium oxide on the Zr-doped CeO2 is 3.746 eV, slightly higher than that on pure CeO2 (3.545 eV). The anchoring of CrOx is therefore somewhat more favorable on the surface of the Ce-Zr solid solution, facilitating exchange of strong acid sites by the anchored CrOx (Sharma et al., 2022). Thus, the surface acidity is altered by the presence of Zr, which is also confirmed by NH3-TPD results (Fig. 6h and Table S4 in the Supporting Information). This partly explains the observed inhibition of coke formation upon Zr promotion and further reduced coking with increasing Zr content. The easier binding also implies stronger interaction between surface CrOx and the Zr-containing support that might plausibly improve the distribution of chromium oxides, leading to restrained aggregation and higher activity. The oxygen vacancy formation energy (
) of CrO2 on pure CeO2 is 3.352 eV and profoundly increases to 4.710 eV on the Zr-substituted surface (Fig. 7b1 and b2). The formation of more stable oxygen species is responsible for the suppressed COx formation over the Zr promoted redox catalyst. This is in accordance with XPS results that the ratio of weakly-bonded oxygen significantly decreases with increasing Zr doping (Fig. 6d-f).

Fig. 7. DFT calculations. Oxygen vacancy formation energy (Eov) and the activation energy for oxygen migration (Ea) of chromium oxide supported on (a) pristine CeO2 and (b) Zr-substituted CeO2. Structures shown in this Fig. are the initial geometry. The final structures can be found in Fig. S13 in the Supporting Information.
Furthermore, the long-range effects of Zr-doping is investigated with the CrO2 binding on the O atom along the diagonal direction within the Zr-substituted 2 × 2 CeO2 surface (considering the symmetry of the other three O atoms that are adjacent to the doped Zr), as shown in Fig. S15a. Results show that Zr doping does have a long-range constraining effect of the oxygen of CrOx, while the binding of CrOx is more favorable only on adjacent O atoms. Related configurations are shown in Fig. S15b, c with computational details.
As discussed in H2-TPR results (i.e., higher oxygen donating capability of ceria found in samples with higher Zr content), it can be inferred that the oxygen from the support migrates to the reduced CrOx, which helps maintain the activity of the catalyst. Further calculations support this conclusion by elucidating the process on the two redox catalysts. The activation energy (
) is determined as 0.106 eV for the Cr/CeO2 redox catalyst (Fig. 7a3), and 0 for the Zr-doped catalyst (Fig. 7b3). This could be reasons for the fact that the redox catalysts with higher zirconium content possess higher oxygen mobility, while maintaining inhibition of COx formation.
4. Conclusion
The 7.5Cr/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalyst developed in this study shows high CL-ODHP performance with considerable cyclic stability. The use of multiple analytical techniques and DFT calculations reveals the instrumental roles of the surface CrOx and Ce-Zr solid solution support and their underlying interactions. The support with improved oxygen mobility serves as an oxygen reservoir for the activation and in situ regeneration of the reduced Cr active species. Also, the addition of Zr has led to a higher oxygen vacancy formation energy in chromium oxides, which facilitates higher propylene selectivity. Moreover, these findings have manifested the feasibility that chemical looping method has provided to rationally tailor the functionality of components. This study is an example of the application of chemical looping in conventional catalytic reactions like propane dehydrogenation, and the first time in Cr catalysis, and has contributed to a more diverse framework for its further development as a method of reaction engineering.
