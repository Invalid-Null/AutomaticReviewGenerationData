AbstractAbstract
In this study, radial flow moving bed reactors for isobutane dehydrogenation have been modeled and simulated heterogeneously based on mass and energy conservation laws. The considered reaction networks in the model are isobutene dehydrogenation as main reaction, and hydrogenolysis, propane dehydrogenation as well as coke formation as side reactions that all occur on the catalyst surface. Then, the process condition has been optimized to produce more isobutene under steady state condition. To prove the accuracy of the considered mathematical model and assumptions, simulation results are compared with the plant data. As a powerful method in the global optimization, the genetic algorithm has been used to optimize the considered objective function. The isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity under optimal conditions are about 40.1% and 91%, respectively.

1. Introduction
There are many researches in the literature focussing on catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes to produce olefins such as isobutene [1]. As one of unsaturated hydrocarbons, isobutene is a colorless and extremely flammable gas at standard pressure and temperature. It is used as a feedstock to produce a variety of chemical components such as polybutene, methyl tert-butyle ether (MTBE) and ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE). In addition, alkylation of isobutene with butane produces isooctane as a fuel additive. Isobutene is also used as a monomer or copolymer to produce synthetic rubber and various plastics. Although isobutene can be isolated from refinery streams, the common industrial method to produce isobutene is catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane over Pt-based catalyst. Some of commercial technologies have been developed for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as isobutane, which differ in catalyst, reactor type and utilized regeneration system. The Catofin isobutane dehydrogenation technology is a cyclic process to produce isobutene over chromia-alumina catalyst [2]. In this process, the fixed-bed reactors operate adiabatically and they are changed periodically to regenerate the catalyst. In UOP process, the dehydrogenation occurs in several adiabatic moving-bed reactors over modified Pt-based catalyst considering continuous catalyst regeneration [3]. This process consists of three radial-flow adiabatic reactors, charge and interstage heaters and regeneration reactor.
There are many researches on isobutane dehydrogenation over Pt-Sn catalyst [4, 5]. Generally, the catalytic properties of Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts strongly depend on the interaction between Pt and Sn, and on the chemical state of Sn [5]. Cortright et al. [6] presented a rate equation for isobutane dehydrogenation over Pt-Sn catalyst. Zwahlen and Agnew [7] studied isobutane dehydrogenation over Cr-Al2O3 catalyst at 530–570 °C in a modified berty reactor. Zhang et al. [8] investigated the synergistic effect between Sn and K in Pt-Sn-K/γ-Al2O3 catalyst by changing Sn content. They showed that, Pt-0.6Sn-K/γ-Al2O3 catalyst results in lower deactivation rate and higher process selectivity and isobutane conversion. Sahebdelfar et al. [9] modeled isobutane dehydrogenation in an adiabatic radial flow moving-bed reactor homogenously without considering the side reactions. They neglected the side reactions while the isobutene selectivity in the commercial process was about 90%.
In this work, isobutene production in the radial flow packed-bed reactors (UOP process) have been modeled and optimized under steady state condition. In this research, isobutane dehydrogenation reaction, as well as side reactions such as hydrogenolysis, propane dehydrogenation and coke formation reactions have been considered in the mathematical model. The catalyst moving and coke deposition on the catalyst surface result in an activity profile along reactors that has been calculated by a proper correlation. To prove the accuracy of the considered model, the simulation results have been compared with the plant data available. Then, process performance has been optimized to produce higher isobutene and lower methane production considering genetic algorithm programming. In this process, methane is main byproduct. Due to significant effect of inlet streams temperature on reaction rate, inlet temperatures to reactors have been considered as decision variables.
2. Kinetics model
Isobutane dehydrogenation is an equilibrium and endothermic reaction. Although increasing temperature and decreasing pressure shift the reaction toward completion, it promotes side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation. The reaction and reaction rate of isobutane dehydrogenation over Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts can be expressed as follows [10]:

Beside isobutane dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, propane dehydrogenation and coke formation reactions take place over the catalyst surface. The use of high contact time or high temperature causes isobutane cracking to methane and propane (hydrogenolysis reaction) which is a main side reaction [11].

3. Process modeling
3.1. Reaction side
The conventional isobutane dehydrogenation process consists of three series moving-bed radial flow reactors that the feed stream is entered to the first reactor. The outlet product from first reactor is fed to the second reactor. Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst is gradually coked as it moves down through the reactors. Due to coke formation on the catalyst surface, the outlet catalyst from the third reactor is sent to the regeneration section. In the regeneration reactor, the formed coke is burnt off and the regenerated catalyst is recycled toward the first reactor and flows in turn along the reactors. Since the outlet temperature from each reactor drops due to endothermic reactions, the interstage heaters are placed between rectors to increase temperature. Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of the conventional process.

In this research, a heterogeneous model has been developed to simulate the process. In the considered mathematical model, the following assumptions are adopted:
•
The gas mixture is ideal under the considered process condition.
•
Radial diffusion of mass and energy is negligible.
•
The chemical reactions take place on the catalyst phase and reactions occurred in the gas phase have been neglected.
•
Temperature gradient in the solid phase is negligible (Biot number is less that 0.1).
•
Catalyst has been dispersed homogenously in the radial and axial directions.
•
The feed flows uniformly in reactors.
•
The system is well isolated.
Based on the heterogeneous modeling, concentration gradient in the catalyst phase has been considered in the model using effectiveness factor (η) which is based on StefanMaxwell equations. And based on the above-mentioned assumptions, mass and energy balances for the gas phase in the reaction zone can be expressed as follows:

3.2. Auxiliary equations
There are some parameters in the heterogeneous models, such as heat and mass transfer coefficients between gas and solid phases, which connect the governing equations in gas and solid phases and should be calculated from proper correlations. In addition, proper and accurate temperature and component dependent correlations should be chosen to estimate the physical properties of components and mixture such as viscosity, specific heat capacity, gas heat conductivity and diffusion coefficients along the reactor. The source of considered correlations to calculate components and mixture physical properties, mass and heat transfer coefficient between phases are summarized in Table 2.

3.3. Optimization
Gradient based optimization methods suffer from trapping at local optimum and do not guarantee global optimum of functions. Genetic algorithm (GA) is an adaptive heuristic search method based on the evolutionary ideas of natural and genetic selections [21]. It is a programming technique which mimics biological evolution as a problem-solving strategy such as inherence, mutation, selection and crossover. The main steps of genetic algorithm are:
•
Initialization and randomly initialize population
•
Repeat
•
Evaluate the objective and fitness function
•
Apply genetic operators

Selection
○
Crossover
○
Mutation
•
Until stopping criteria
In practice, over successive generations, the population moves toward an optimal solution in the feasible domain. In this research, improving isobutane dehydrogenation to enhance isobutene production and decreasing isobutane cracking through hydrogenolysis reaction have been chosen as the optimization objects. Due to severe effect of temperature on the reaction kinetics, temperature policy is a key to optimal operation of reactors. Three decision variables, namely inlet temperature of three reactors (T01, T02 and T03), have been considered in the optimization problem. Due to thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and side reactions occurrence, dehydrogenation of light alkanes is conducted at temperatures about 650 °C. Hence, an upper bound of 700 °C is chosen for inlet temperatures. The bounds of decision variables are:

The considered objective function for minimization is:

4. Numerical solution
The mass and energy governing equations create a set of ordinary differential equations as an initial value problem. This set of nonlinear differential equations is not solved analytically and should be solved numerically. Fourth order Runge-Kutta method has been selected to solve this set of equations. At the end of numerical solution, it is possible to plot components concentration and temperature profiles versus reactor length.
5. Results and discussion
5.1. Model validation
There is no work in the literature about mathematical modeling of isobutane dehydrogenation process considering side reactions such as hydrogenolysis, propane dehydrogenation and coke formation reactions. To demonstrate the accuracy of the considered model and assumptions, the simulation results have been validated by available plant data from Bandar Imam Khomeini petrochemical complex (Iran). The comparison between simulation results and plant data for industrial case has been shown in Table 3. It is observed that the predicted isobutane conversion and selectivity have a good agreement with the observed plant data.

5.2. Process optimization
To produce more isobutene and less methane, the process conditions have been optimized under steady state condition. The calculated optimal temperatures for inlet streams are about 518.6 °C, 593.5 °C and 686.3 °C, respectively. Figure 2, Figure 3 show isobutene and hydrogen mole fraction profiles along the radial direction of reactors under steady state condition, respectively. According to Figure 2, the outlet isobutene mole fraction from the third reactor is 0.144 and 0.141 under optimal and conventional conditions. Under conventional condition, isobutene production in the third reactor is negligible compared with those in the first and second reactors, while isobutene production in each reactor is same under optimal condition. In other word, the third reactor in the conventional configuration has a very low performance. Under both conventional and optimal conditions, at reactors entrance the rate of isobutane dehydrogenation is high and isobutene content increases sharply. At the last part of reactors, isobutane dehydrogenation approaches to the equilibrium condition. It is seen from Figure 3 that hydrogen mole fraction profiles have a maximum in all of reactors. Although isobutane dehydrogenation reaction increases hydrogen content, isobutane cracking as the main side reaction decreases hydrogen content in reactors. Thus, the higher isobutane dehydrogenation rate at the reactor entrance increases hydrogen mole fraction, and at the end part of the reactor isobutane cracking reduces hydrogen mole fraction while isobutane dehydrogenation has approached to the equilibrium.

Figure 4 shows isobutane conversion in the radial direction of reactors. The total isobutane conversion is net of conversion through dehydrogenation and cracking reactions. Isobutane conversions in the first, second and third reactors at optimal condition are about 16.1%, 15.6% and 11.2%, respectively. Although isobutane conversion in the first reactor under optimal condition is lower, total isobutane conversion has been improved about 4.64% compared with conventional reactor. The overall isobutane conversion has been obtained about 40.85% under conventional operating conditions of the process. This figure shows that, about half of isobutane is in the first reactor under conventional condition while conversion in all of optimized reactors is almost same. In this process, isobutane is converted to isobutene, hydrogen, methane and propane. Selectivity, which is the main parameter to investigate side reactions occurrence and is defined as ratio of consumed isobutane through isobutane dehydrogenation reaction per total consumed isobutanethrough isobutane dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reaction, has been obtained about 90.2% and 91.0% under conventional and optimized conditions.

Figure 4. Isobutane conversion profile along the radial direction
Figure 5(a) and 5(b) show isobutane dehydration and hydrogenolysis reactions rate along the radial direction of reactors, respectively. It is seen from Figure 5(a) that the rate of isobutane dehydrogenation reaction approaches to the equilibrium after a certain position in all the reactors. According to Le Chatelier's principle, when an independent variable of an equilibrium system such as temperature, pressure or component concentration is changed, the system shifts to reduce the effect of change and approaches toward a new equilibrium condition. Thus, decreasing temperature along reactors decreases isobutane conversion. It was mentioned that high contact time or high temperature increases the hydrogenolysis reaction rate. Lower inlet temperature in the first and second reactors reduces the rate of hydrogenolysis reaction compared with that of isobutane dehydrogenation due to higher activation energy of hydrogenolysis reaction. Thus, higher value of isobutane is consumed through isobutane dehydrogenation to produce isobutene as desired product and results in higher process selectivity. Higher temperature in the third reactor concludes higher isobutane dehydrogenation that improves isobutane conversion. This figure shows that the difference between isobutane dehydrogenation under optimized and conventional conditions in the third reactor is significant.

Figure 6 shows the radial temperature profiles in gas phase of the reactors. In this process, temperature decreases due to endothermic reactions. Temperature drop in the first reactor is higher compared with those in the other reactors which conforms to isobutane dehydrogenation reaction rate profile. Since reactions take place on the catalyst surface, the solid phase temperature will be lower compared with the gas phase temperature and so it will lead to heat transfer between solid and gas phases, resulting in a decrease of gas phase temperature. Table 4 shows the process performance on producing isobutene under conventional and optimized conditions. This table proves the process operability under optimized condition to produce higher isobutene and lower methane production.

6. Conclusions
In this study, isobutane dehydrogenation in the moving-bed radial flow reactors are modeled and optimized based on the mass and energy conservation laws under steady state condition. In these reactors, isobutane dehydrogenation as main reaction and hydrogenolysis, propane dehydrogenation and coke formation as side reactions occur on the catalyst surface. The accuracy of the considered model and assumptions is proved by available plant data. It is shown that the outlet isobutane conversion from the third reactor is about 40.1% under optimized condition which is improved about 4.64% compared with that under conventional condition. Despite of higher isobutane conversion, the process selectivity is also enhanced about 0.87% under optimized condition.
