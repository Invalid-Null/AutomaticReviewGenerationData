1. Introduction
Propene is one of the most important starting materials in the petrochemical industry with an annual expected demand of about 130 million metric tons in 2020 [1], which will continue to grow in the coming years. Propene is mainly produced together with ethylene and butenes via steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of different oil fractions. The disadvantages of these processes are high cost due to high energy demand, low selectivity to the desired olefins and limited oil reserves. Moreover, they cannot completely fulfil the propene demand of the steadily growing market especially in Asia. Thus, to close the propene gap, on-purpose production technologies such as metathesis of 2-butene with ethylene [2], methanol to olefins [3], methanol to propene [4] and non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene (PDH) [5] have been developed.
The share of propene production through PDH is continuously growing due to the increasing exploitation of shale gas containing propane. Several propane dehydrogenation installations are currently in operation, with other plants being planned. The majority of these facilities are located in Middle East, China or the United States and use either the Oleflex (UOP) or the Catofin (Lummus) technologies [6]. The industrially applied catalysts are composed of platinum (< 1 wt%) or chromium oxide (18–20 wt%) as active components on an alumina support and promoted by 1–2 wt% Na or K [6]. Platinum is additionally promoted with 1–2 wt % Sn to improve its performance. The presence of tin leads to a decrease in the size of platinum particles and might transfer valence electrons to the 5d band of platinum resulting in a decrease in the interaction of hydrocarbons with platinum, thus lowering the contribution of hydrogenolysis and coke formation [7]. The dehydrogenation reaction is performed in a moving-bed reactor (Pt-Sn-based) or in a fixed bed reactor (CrOx-based system) with the cycle time of 30 min consisting of reaction and regeneration stage [5]. The main drawbacks of such catalysts are toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds, thermal sintering of the alumina support on the one hand and high costs of Pt, sintering of the Pt nanoparticles and catalyst particle attrition on the other hand [6]. The Pt catalyst moreover requires the usage of Cl2 or Cl-containing hydrocarbons for re-dispersing Pt upon catalyst regeneration. These disadvantages are a strong motivation for both academia and industry to develop suitable alternatives free of such shortcomings [6]. Thus, various catalysts based on MoOx [8,9], VOx [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14]], isolated FeII [15], isolated CoII [16], alumosilicate zeolite [17] and GaOx/metallic Ga [[18], [19], [20], [21]] have been developed and investigated for the PDH reaction but still have not found their commercial application.
Recently, we have introduced non-toxic bulk catalysts on the basis of ZrO2 [[22], [23], [24], [25], [26]]. According to DFT calculations [27,28], two neighboring coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) were suggested to form the catalytically active site for propene formation. Their concentration can be controlled through (i) the phase composition of bare ZrO2 [28], (ii) the size of crystallites of bare ZrO2 [27,28], (iii) promotion of ZrO2 with an oxide of metal with lower oxidation state than +4 [25] or (iv) through deposition of Ru nanoparticles (NPs) on catalyst surface [24]. The effect of the promoter for ZrO2 was also investigated in dehydrogenation of n-butane and isobutane. Doping of ZrO2 with Y2O3, La2O3 and Sm2O3 was found to increase the rate of olefin formation in comparison with bare ZrO2, while Al2O3, Ga2O3, Li2O, MgO or CaO promoters negatively influenced the activity [23]. The role of supported Ru NPs on the surface of LaZrOx or YZrOx was to ease the removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2 upon catalyst reductive treatment owing to the ability of NPs for H2 activation. It was, however, established that catalyst activity passed through a maximum with rising Ru loading. The decrease in the rate of propene formation was related to ZrO2 overreduction. No further mechanistic studies were carried out to elucidate the role of Ru. Moreover, our previous studies focused on the factors affecting catalyst activity and to a lesser extent on product selectivity with the latter property being highly important for possible commercial application.
Therefore, the present study was aimed to close such gaps with the purpose to provide fundamental knowledge required for purposeful design and preparation of ZrO2-based catalysts with supported metal species. With this intention, we investigated the effects of the kind of supported metal (Ru, Rh, Pt or Ir), its loading and the kind of promoter (Y2O3, La2O3) for ZrO2 on the activity and, particularly, on the selectivity-conversion relationships including coke formation in the PDH reaction. The catalysts were characterized by various complementary techniques and tested in the PDH reaction in a broad range of propane conversion. Isotopic H/D exchange tests as well as temperature-programmed C3H6 desorption and C3H6 pulse experiments were valuable for deriving insights into the role of supported metal in the course of PDH.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalyst preparation
ZrO2 (Saint-Gobain), LaZrOx (9 wt% La2O3 in ZrO2, Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo) and YZrOx (14 wt% Y2O3 in ZrO2, Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo) were used as supports for Rh, Ru, Pt or Ir nanoparticles (NPs). RhCl3·xH2O (40 wt% Rh, Sigma Aldrich), RuCl3·xH2O (36 wt% Ru, abcr GmbH), H2PtCl6 (39 % Pt, Sigma Aldrich), IrCl4 (57 wt% Ir, Alfa Aesar), NaOH (99 %, Merck), ethylene glycol (99 %, Roth), acetone (99.98 %, Fisher Chemical), toluene (99.98 %, Fisher Chemical), and ethanol (99.99 %, Fisher Chemical) were used for NPs synthesis. All reagents were used without further purification. Briefly, to prepare 1 nm NPs, each metal precursor, i.e. RhCl3·xH2O (0.2058 g), RuCl3·xH2O (0.2246 g), H2PtCl6 (0.4002 g) or IrCl4 (0.2709 g), was dissolved in 20 mL ethylene glycol in a three-necked flask. The metal concentration in the obtained solution was about 0.04 mol·L−1. A solution of 0.4 g NaOH in 20 mL ethylene glycol (0.5 mol·L−1) was added to the metal ethylene glycol solution under stirring in Ar flow to obtain a pH value of 12. The resulting solution was heated under Ar flow to 160 °C under reflux for 3 h to remove water and organic byproducts. A dark solution was formed and contained NPs of Rh, Ru, Pt or Ir with metal concentration of about 0.02 mol·L−1. To separate metal nanoparticles from ethylene glycol, 2 mL of acetone were mixed with a calculated volume of NPs solution according to the weight percentage of the metal. The volume was calculated as follows V = n·c −1 = m·Mmetal−1·cmetal−1. For example, 146 μL Rh-containing NPs solution was taken for the synthesis of 3 g of Rh(0.01 wt%)/support. Hereafter, 10 mL of toluene were added to this new solution to obtain two separated phases: toluene and acetone with NPs located in the acetone phase. The toluene phase was decanted, and the remaining solvents was partially evaporated in air flow. The above NPs extraction procedure with further 2 mL of acetone and 10 mL of toluene was repeated (3–4 times for 146 μL Rh-containing NPs solution, the number of repetition increases with increasing volume) until ethylene glycol was extracted and a viscous NPs solution is left. Hereafter, the obtained NPs solution were mixed with 30 mL methanol. The resulting mixture was added to a suspension of 3 g support in 10 mL methanol and then stirred overnight followed by centrifugation and drying at 60 °C for 24 h. All catalysts were used without calcination as a fraction with particle size of 315–710 μm. The preparation method of NPs with a size of about 5 nm is described in our previous study [29].
2.2. Catalyst physicochemical characterization
The size of metal nanoparticles in the mother colloidal solution was determined by SAXS on a Kratky-type instrument (SAXSess, Anton Paar, Austria) operated at 40 kV and 50 mA in slit collimation using a two-dimensional CCD detector.
Aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEM-ARM200 F, operated at 200 kV) using the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector was used to determine the size of metal (Ir or Pt) NPs supported on the surface of ZrO2. It was not possible to determine the size of Rh and Ru NPs on the surface of ZrO2 due to the low contrast between Zr and Rh or Ru as these elements have similar atomic weights. The catalysts were deposited onto a holey carbon film supported on a copper grid.
The metal loading in the catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Varian 715-ES).
Specific surface area (SBET) of the samples was determined by nitrogen physisorption experiments at −196 °C using a Belsorp mini II setup (Bel Japan).
XRD powder patterns were recorded on a Panalytical X'Pert diffractometer equipped with an Xcelerator detector using automatic divergence slits and Cu kα1/α2 radiation (40 kV, 40 mA; λ =0.15406 nm, 0.154443 nm). Cu beta-radiation was excluded using a nickel filter foil. The measurements were performed with a 0.0167° step and a data collecting time of 25 s per step. The samples were mounted on silicon zero-background holders. The obtained intensities were converted from automatic to fixed divergence slits (0.25°) for further analysis. Peak positions and profile were fitted with Pseudo-Voigt function using the HighScore Plus software package (Panalytical). Phase identification was done by using the PDF-2 database of the International Center of Diffraction Data (ICDD). The crystallite size was calculated by applying the Scherrer equation using the integral breadth under the assumption of spherically shaped crystallites. The constant K in this equation was set to 1.0747.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on an ESCALAB 220iXL (ThermoFisher Scientific) with monochromated Al Kα radiation (E = 1486.6 eV). Samples were deposited on a stainless-steel holder with conductive double-sided adhesive carbon tape. The electron binding energies were obtained with charge compensation using a flood electron source and referenced to the C1s peak of CC and CH bonds at 284.8 eV. For quantitative analysis the peaks were deconvoluted with Gaussian-Lorentzian curves. The peak areas were normalized by the transmission function of the spectrometer and the element specific sensitivity factor of Scofield [30].
2.3. Temperature-programmed methods
Catalyst reducibility was tested by temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) using a feed containing 5 vol% H2 in Ar. The experiments were carried out in an in-house developed setup equipped with eight individually heated continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactors. Samples (100 mg for each sample) were initially calcined in air flow (10 mL·min−1) at 550 °C for 1 h and then cooled down in the same flow to 40 °C. Hereafter, the oxidized samples were flushed with Ar (10 mL·min−1) for 15 min and heated in a flow of 5 vol% H2 in Ar (10 mL·min−1) to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 K·min−1. The consumption of H2 was quantified by an on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320) from the changes in the ratio of intensity recorded at atomic mass units (AMU) related to H2 (AMU of 2) and Ar (AMU of 40) signals.
Temperature-programmed ammonia desorption (NH3-TPD) tests were performed to investigate acidic properties of reduced catalysts. The experiments were carried out in the same setup used for H2-TPR tests. Prior to the NH3-TPD tests, the samples (50 mg for each sample) were calcined in air flow (10 mL·min−1) at 550 °C for 1 h, flushed with Ar flow (10 mL·min−1) for 15 min and then treated in a flow of 57 vol% H2 in Ar (10 mL·min−1) at 550 °C for 1 h followed by cooling down in Ar flow to 120 °C. Hereafter, they were exposed to a flow of ammonia (1 vol% NH3 in Ar, 10 mL·min−1) at 120 °C for 1 h and hereafter purged with Ar (10 mLmin−1) for 2 h to remove weakly bound NH3. The samples were then cooled down to 80 °C in Ar (10 mL·min−1) and finally heated to 900 °C (10 K·min−1) in Ar flow (10 mL·min−1). Desorbed ammonia was quantified by an on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320) using the ratio of signal intensities of NH3 (AMU of 15) and Ar (AMU of 40).
Temperature-programmed propene desorption (C3H6-TPD) was performed in the same setup used for H2-TPR or NH3-TPD tests. Prior to the C3H6-TPD tests, the samples (200 mg for each sample) were heated up to 550 °C with a heating rate of 10 K·min−1 in Ar flow (10 mL·min−1), calcined in air flow at 550 °C for 1 h, flushed with Ar flow (10 mL·min−1) for 15 min and then reduced in a flow of 57 vol% H2 in Ar (10 mL·min−1) at 550 °C for 1 h followed by cooling down in Ar flow (10 mL·min−1) to 50 °C. Hereafter, they were exposed to a flow of propene (5 vol% C3H6 in Ar, 10 mL·min−1) at 50 °C for 2 h, then purged with Ar (10 mL·min−1) for 12 h to remove weakly bound C3H6 and finally heated up to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 K·min−1 in Ar flow (10 mL·min−1). The amount of desorbed C3H6 was determined from the changes in the intensity of C3H6 (AMU of 41) and Ar (AMU of 40) signals using an on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320).
2.4. Transient mechanistic studies
The number of oxygen vacancies in YZrOx-based catalysts with supported Rh, Ru, Pt or Ir NPs was determined by O2-pulse experiments performed in the temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor [31,32]. A catalyst probe of 60 mg (particle size: 315–710 μm) was placed in an in-house developed quartz-tube micro reactor (din = 6 mm, L = 40 mm) between two layers of quartz (particle size: 250–350 μm). Prior to the pulse experiments, each catalyst was treated in the following way. It was initially heated in O2 flow (5 mL·min−1) up to 550 °C with a heating rate of 10 K·min−1. Then, the oxidized catalyst was flushed at the same temperature in a flow of N2 (5 mL·min−1) for 5 min and treated in H2 flow (57 vol% H2 in N2, 10 mL·min−1) for 1 h. After completing the reductive treatment, the catalyst was evacuated to about 10-5 Pa. The pulse experiments were performed using an O2:Ar = 1:1 mixture prepared from O2 (Air Liquide, 4.5) and Ar (Linde Gas, 5.0) without additional purification. This mixture was pulsed until no further changes in the intensity of O2 transient responses were observed during at least 30 pulses. The reported amounts of consumed oxygen atoms correspond to the average value of at least 4 repetition of each titration experiment.
H/D isotopic exchange tests were carried out in the TAP reactor over selected catalysts with the purpose to elucidate the effect of supported metal on hydrogen activation. 20 mg of each catalyst were packed into the reactor in the same manner as in the O2 pulse experiments described above. Before starting such tests, a multi-stage treatment was carried out as follows. Firstly, the catalysts were heated in a flow of N2 (10 mL·min−1) to 550 °C. At this temperature, the catalysts were exposed to a flow containing N2 (8 mL·min−1) and O2 (2 mL·min−1) for 1 h. Then, the reactor was flushed with a flow of N2 (10 mL·min−1) for 15 min and at the last stage of the treatment the catalysts were reduced in H2 flow (57 vol% H2 in N2, 10 mL·min−1) for 1 h. Finally, the catalysts were treated again in a flow of N2 (10 mL·min−1) for 15 min and then evacuated to 10−5 Pa. The pulse (about 5·1014 molecules) experiments were carried out at 550 °C using a H2:D2:Ar = 1:1:1 mixture (Ar (Linde Gas, 5.0), H2 (Air Liquide, 5.0) and D2 (CK Special Gases Limited, N2.8)).
Propene adsorption/desorption behavior was investigated over reduced (same treatment as described above for the H/D tests) catalysts at 550 °C. A C3H6:Ar = 1:1 mixture (C3H6 (Messer Griesheim, 2.5), Ar (Linde Gas, 5.0)) was used for the pulse experiments. The overall pulse size was between 5·1014 and 7·1014 molecules.
A quadrupole mass spectrometer (HAL RC 301 Hiden Analytical) was applied for quantitative analysis of the feed components and the reaction products. The following AMUs were used for mass-spectrometric identification of different compounds: 42 (C3H6), 41 (C3H6), 32 (O2), 27 (C3H6), 4 (D2), 3 (HD), 2 (H2) and 40 (Ar).
2.5. Catalytic tests
Propane dehydrogenation tests with a C3H8:N2 = 2:3 feed were performed in an in-house developed setup consisting of 15 continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactors operating at 1 bar (absolute pressure). The feed components and the reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890) equipped with flame ionization (FID) and thermal conductivity detectors (TCD).
To determine the rate of propene formation, catalyst amount (0.05 g, fraction 315–710 μm) and total feed flow (40 mL·min−1 per reactor) were set for achieving a degree of propane conversion below 10 %, i.e. to ensure pseudo differential reactor operation regime. The catalysts were initially heated in N2 flow (13.3 mL·min−1 per reactor) up to 550 °C followed by calcination in air flow for 1 h (10 mL·min−1 per reactor). Hereafter they were flushed with N2 for 15 min (13.3 mL·min−1 per reactor), reduced in H2 flow (57 vol% H2 in N2, (9.8 mL·min−1 per reactor)) for 1 h followed by flushing with N2 for 15 min (13.3 mL·min−1 per reactor). Finally, the reaction feed was directed to a selected reactor, while other reactors were purged with N2. The initial rate of propene formation was measured after 190 s on stream.
To determine selectivity-conversion relationship for gas-phase products and coke, catalytic tests were carried out at 550 °C or 600 °C at different contact times to achieve different degrees of propane conversion. Catalyst amount (0.05–0.3 g) and total feed flow (6–60 mL·min−1) were varied. Same treatment as described above to determine the rate of propene formation was applied before such tests.
Durability of Rh(0.05 wt%)/LaZrOx was investigated in a series of 40 PDH/regeneration cycles at 550, 575, 600 and 550 °C using a feed with 40 vol% C3H8 in N2 with total flows of 40, 60, 80 and 40  mL·min−1 respectively. Prior to the first PDH stage, the catalyst (300 mg) was heated in N2 up to 550 °C followed by feeding air for 1 h. Hereafter, the oxidized catalyst was reduced in a flow of H2 (57 vol% H2 in N2) also for 1 h at the same temperature. Each PDH stage lasted 20 min. A regeneration procedure was performed at the same temperature (30 min reoxidation followed by 1 h reductive treatment with 15 min of purge with N2 between all steps).
Eqs. (1)–(5) were used to calculate the space time yield of propene formation (STY(C3H6)) expressed as kg(C3H6)·h−1·m−3cat, the rate of propene formation (r(C3H6)) expressed as mmol(C3H6)·m−2cat·min−1, propane conversion (X(C3H8)), selectivity to gas-phase products (Si) and coke (S(coke)), respectively.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic materials and their general characterization
To get general information about catalyst morphology, phase and surface composition, both the bare supports and the supported catalysts were characterized by XRD, BET, TEM and XPS. YZrOx possesses the largest SBET surface area of 92 m2·g−1. The SBET values of ZrO2 and LaZrOx are 88 and 67 m2·g−1, respectively. According to XRD measurements, ZrO2 is present in the monoclinic phase with a crystallite size of about 14 nm, while its both doped counterparts, i.e. LaZrOx and YZrOx, are stabilized in the tetragonal phase with smaller crystallites of about 11 and 10 nm, respectively (Fig. S1). The presence of the tetragonal ZrO2 phase in the mixed oxides is in a good agreement with a well-known fact that ZrO2 can be stabilized in this phase if it is promoted with various metal oxides [33,34]. It is also worth mentioning that supported metal NPs did not affect the phase composition of the bare supports. No reflexes characteristic for supported metals could be identified due to very small size of NPs.
The size of metal NPs and its distribution was determined in solution before impregnation by Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) analysis. According to the volume-weighted distribution function Dv(R) evaluated assuming a polydisperse system of spherical particles, Rh, Ru, Pt and Ir NPs have an average diameter of about 1 nm with a relative narrow size distribution (Fig. S2). As shown in our previous study on Rh NPs supported over Al2O3 [29], the size of NPs does not change after their deposition on the surface of Al2O3. To check if this is also the case for the NPs-support systems studied here, we applied TEM for characterizing NPs supported on ZrO2. Due to the low contrast between Zr, Rh and Ru, it was not possible to determine the size of Rh and Ru NPs on the surface of ZrO2. Therefore, the NPs size could be only determined for the significantly heavier elements Ir and Pt. According to the representative HAADF-STEM images shown in Fig. S3 (a, b), the size of Pt and Ir NPs remained at about 1 nm after their deposition on the surface of supports. Therefore, we can exclude sintering of Pt and Ir NPs during catalyst synthesis. Owing to the low surface density of metal NPs, sintering is unlikely to occur during PDH tests at 550 or 600 °C. This assumption is supported by our earlier results showing that Rh NPs on Al2O3 did not sinter even at 800 °C over at least 200 h on stream in the partial oxidation of methane [35]. To check this assumption, we also analyzed a spent Pt/ZrO2 sample used for the PDH reaction at 550 °C for 1 h on stream. No changes in the size of NPs could be established (Fig. S3 (c)).
3.2. Surface electronic state of zirconium
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used for investigating the oxidation state of zirconium in the presence and the absence of metal NPs. It was, unfortunately, not possible to determine the oxidation state of the supported metals as their surface concentration was below the detection limit. The electron binding energies (BE) of Zr3d5/2 and Zr3d3/2 in ZrO2 were 182.1 and 184.5 eV, respectively (the distance between both peaks is always about 2.4 eV) and are characteristic for Zr4+ [36]. The corresponding binding energies in LaZrOx did not relevantly change but those in YZrOx were about 0.7 eV lower (Fig. S4). This shift may indicate the presence of anion vacancies, i.e. electron density mainly located in the vacancies is distributed to a less extent between the neighboring Zr4+ cations. Consequently, the BE values of Zr3d in YZrOx are shifted to lower values in comparison with those in bare ZrO2.
The kind of supported metal was established to influence the BE values of Zr3d but to a different extent. For all ZrO2-based supports, the BE values of Zr3d shift to lower values after depositing Rh, Ru or Pt. This may indicate that the electron density from these metals can be partially transferred to Zr4+. The following order of the strength of metal-Zr4+ interactions was obtained: Ru > Pt ≥ Rh. The metal-induced shift in the BE values of Zr3d decreases when ZrO2 is promoted with La2O3 or Y2O3 (to a larger extent). Such metal-Zr4+ interactions are not characteristic for the Ir-containing catalysts, as concluded from the fact that the presence of Ir does not affect the BE values of Zr3d.
3.3. Redox properties
H2-TPR measurements were carried out to check how the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen is affected by the kind of metal oxide promoter (Y2O3 or La2O3) or the kind and loading of supported metal (Rh, Ru, Pt or Ir). Fig. 1 exemplifies the H2-TPR profiles determined for YZrOx-based catalysts with 0.05 wt% metal. The corresponding data for the catalysts on the basis of ZrO2 or LaZrOx are given in Figs. S5–S6. In general, the reduction occurs in a broad temperature range. The temperature of maximal H2 consumption (Tmax) and the amount of H2 consumed (n(H2)) depend on the kind of NPs and support. The Tmax and n(H2) values are given in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3. For the bare supports, the amount increased from 5.8 μmol·g−1 for ZrO2 to 16.5 μmol·g−1 and 29.6 μmol·g−1 for LaZrOx and YZrOx, respectively. Thus, the metal-oxide promoter for ZrO2 improves the reducibility of the latter.

Deposition of Ru, Rh, Pt or Ir on the support led to an increase in the total amount of consumed H2 with an exception of Ir/YZrOx, where the amount of consumed H2 over YZrOx decreased after deposition of Ir. H2 consumption increased with increasing Rh or Ru content over all supports, while no steady increase was observed for the catalysts with Ir or Pt.
The results of H2-TPR tests with the catalysts possessing 0.05 wt% metal are discussed to exemplarily illustrate the effects of the kind of supported metal and metal oxide promoter for ZrO2 on ZrO2 reducibility. For the catalysts on ZrO2 basis, the highest H2 consumption was determined for Ru/ZrO2 (78.3 μmol·g−1) followed by Rh/ZrO2 (64.4 μmol·g−1). Pt/ZrO2 and Ir/ZrO2 were significantly less active. The corresponding n(H2) values are 28.3 μmol·g−1 and 21.4 μmol·g−1. Pt- or Ir-containing catalysts on the basis of LaZrOx or YZrOx revealed lower activity than their Ru- or Rh-containing counterparts. Regardless of the kind of supported metal, promoting of ZrO2 with Y2O3 or La2O3 had a positive effect of the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen. Thus, both supported metal and metal oxide promoter are two decisive parameters affecting ZrO2 reducibility.
3.4. Acidic properties
The effects of the kind of metal oxide promoter (Y2O3 or La2O3), supported metal (Rh, Ru, Pt, Ir) and its loading on the acidic properties of selected samples were elucidated by means of NH3-TPD tests. Fig. 2 shows the NH3-TPD profiles recorded for YZrOx catalysts possessing 0.05 wt% of Rh, Ru, Pt or Ir. The corresponding data for other materials are given in Figs. S7–S8. Applying mathematical deconvolution of these profiles with Gaussian functions, three different kinds of acidic sites could be identified. They can be ascribed to weak, medium and strong acidic sites (Table S1). The temperatures of maximal NH3 desorption and the overall amount of adsorbed NH3 related to the respective specific surface area (SBET) are given in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3. An addition of metal oxide promoter (Y2O3 or La2O3) to ZrO2 led to an increase in the total amount of adsorbed NH3 from 0.8 μmol·m−2 (ZrO2) to 0.9 μmol·m−2 or 1.0 μmol·m−2 for LaZrOx or YZrOx. This is due to the appearance of anion vacancies and accordingly Lewis-acidic coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ sites (Zrcus).

Fig. 2. NH3-TPD profiles of YZrOx-based catalysts with supported (0.05 wt%) Rh, Ru, Pt or Ir.
For illustrating the effect of the kind of supported metal on the amount of adsorbed NH3, we discuss the NH3-TPD data for the catalysts with metal loading of 0.05 wt%. In the presence of Rh, the number of acidic sites on the surface of ZrO2 decreased from 0.8 μmol·m−2 to 0.5 μmol·m−2. A similar change was observed for Pt/ZrO2 and Ir/ZrO2 with the amount of adsorbed NH3 of 0.6 μmol·m−2 and 0.4 μmol·m−2, respectively. For Ru NPs on the surface of ZrO2, the concentration of acidic sites increased slightly to 0.9 μmol·m−2. In general, for the ZrO2-supported catalysts, their acidity decreased depending on the type of the metal in the following order Ru > Pt > Rh > Ir. No positive effect of supported metal was observed for the catalysts on the basis of LaZrOx and YZrOx. Nevertheless, the kind of supported metal and metal oxide promoter for ZrO2 appears to be important for the overall acidity. Among the LaZrOx-supported metals, the highest concentration of acidic sites was detected for Ru/LaZrOx (0.8 μmol·m−2) followed by Rh (0.3 μmol·m−2), Ir (0.2 μmol·m−2) and Pt (0.1 μmol·m−2). For the YZrOx-based catalysts, the order of metals in terms of their influence on catalyst acidity is Ru > Pt > Rh = Ir (in numbers 0.9, 0.4, 0.3 and 0.3 μmol·m−2, respectively).
No universal correlation between the total amount of adsorbed NH3 and metal loading was obtained. For Rh/ZrO2 and Ir/ZrO2 an increase in the amount of adsorbed NH3 with increasing metal content was observed. However, this amount remained constant with increasing metal loading over all LaZrOx-based catalysts as well as over Pt/YZrOx and Ir/YZrOx. For the remaining catalysts, the amount of adsorbed NH3 decreased with increasing metal content. The highest number of acidic sites (1.0 μmol·m−2) was obtained for bare YZrOx, Ru(0.01 wt%)/YZrOx and Ru(0.01 wt%)/ZrO2.
3.5. Catalyst activity
To compare the prepared catalysts with respect to their activity for propane dehydrogenation, we determined the rate of propene formation at a propane conversion below 10 %. The obtained values related to catalyst surface area are shown in Fig. 3 as a function of apparent metal surface density over ZrOx, LaZrOx and YZrOx. Apparent surface density instead of wt% as a unit of metal content was chosen since the metals have different molar masses, e.g. M(Rh) = 102.9 g·mol−1 and M(Pt) = 195.1 g·mol−1. Importantly, Pt/SiO2, Rh/SiO2 and Ru/SiO2 possessing 1 nm metal NPs revealed very low activity in the target reaction [22]. Thus, the metals are not the main active sites in our present catalysts. They, however, play an important role for generation of catalytically active Zrcus sites and indirectly improve their intrinsic activity through accelerating H2 desorption as will be demonstrated in the below sections.

In comparison with the bare supports, the rate of propene formation increases in the presence of supported metal (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained in our previous study dealt with Ru/YZrOx and Ru/LaZrOx [24]. However, the activity of ZrO2-, LaZrOx- or YZrOx-based catalysts strongly depend on the kind of supported metal and metal oxide promoter for ZrO2. Moreover, the positive effect of metal is more pronounced for doped ZrO2 (YZrOx and LaZrOx) with Rh or Ru in comparison with the corresponding catalysts on the basis of ZrO2.
The rate of propene formation over all catalysts containing Rh or Ru passed through a maximum with rising metal surface density. A similar dependence was observed for LaZrOx- or YZrOx-based catalysts with Ir. No maximum but a steady increase was determined for Pt/ZrO2, Ir/ZrO2 and Pt/YZrOx. For all ZrO2-based catalysts with apparent surface metal density below 0.03 nm−2, the rate of propene formation increased in the order Rh > Ru > Ir ≈ Pt. For their higher-loaded counterparts, the order changes to Rh > Ir > Pt > Ru. Irrespective of the kind of support, the highest rate of propene formation was obtained over Rh-containing catalysts (Fig. 3). The corresponding values for Rh/ZrO2, Rh/YZrOx and Rh/LaZrOx were 15.1, 18.0 and 23.7 μmol·m−2·min−1. The two latter values are higher than 16.4 μmol·m−2·min−1 determined for an analog of industrial K-CrOx/Al2O3 tested under the same reaction conditions. Moreover, the most active present Rh-containing catalyst significantly outperformed our previously developed Ru/YZrOx [24], i.e. 23.7 vs. 14.5 μmol·m−2·min−1.
To demonstrate durability and application potential of our catalyst, 0.05Rh/LaZrOx, one of the most active catalysts, was tested in a series of 40 PDH/regeneration cycles performed at 550, 575 and 600 °C using a feed consisting of 40 vol% C3H8 in N2. The maximal space time yield (STY) of propene formation as well as on-stream profiles of propane conversion and propene selectivity in the first and last 10 PDH cycles at 550 °C are given in Fig. S9. The catalyst deactivated due to coke formation. The deactivation rate increased with PDH temperature. Propane conversion was in the range 22–27 %, 14–29 % and 5–27 % at 550, 575 and 600 °C respectively. The corresponding ranges for propene selectivity are 99−96%, 99−84%, and 100−70%. Regardless of reaction temperature, the catalyst practically completely recovered its activity after oxidative treatment (Fig. S9).
The different effects of supported metals and metal oxide promoters for ZrO2 on the rate of propene formation can be due to their different ability to facilitate release of lattice oxygen from ZrO2 upon reductive catalyst treatment and accordingly to generate Zrcus sites required for propane dehydrogenation [27,28]. To check this hypothesis, we prepared Fig. 4 where the rate of propene formation is shown as a function of the amount of lattice oxygen removed. This amount represents the amount of oxygen vacancies and is proportional to the concentration of Zrcus sites created upon reductive catalyst treatment. It was calculated from the overall H2 consumption determined through our H2-TPR tests under assumption that one H2 molecule removes one lattice oxygen. Depending on the kind of supported metal, different dependences of the rate on the amount of removed lattice oxygen were established. For all Rh- or Ru-containing catalysts, the rate passed through a maximum with an increase in the amount of removed oxygen. The position of the maximum depends on the kind of support. The supports can be ordered in terms of the reduction degree, above which the rate starts to decrease as follows ZrO2 < YZrOx < LaZrOx. In contrast to the Rh- or Ru-containing catalysts, the activity of their Ir-containing counterparts with exception of Ir/YZrOx increased with the amount of removed lattice oxygen. For Pt/LaZrOx, the rate decreased with the amount, while no obvious dependence was established for Pt/ZrO2 and Pt/YZrOx.

The activity of bare ZrO2, LaZrOx and YZrOx is represented by solid symbols. Reaction condition: 550 °C, X(C3H8) < 0.1, C3H8:N2 = 2:3 feed.
For a direct comparison of all catalysts with respect to the effect of catalyst reduction degree on the rate of propene formation, we plotted all the data from Fig. 4 together in Fig. S10. Although the data points are scattered, a positive effect of the degree of ZrO2 reduction might be deduced. Such scattering might be due to the fact that lattice oxygen mobility becomes high in ZrO2-based supports and the determined H2 consumption is not only due to reaction of H2 with surface lattice oxygen but also bulk oxygen may participate in this process. To support a possible correlation in Fig. S10, an alternative method was employed to quantifying the number of anion vacancies in selected samples (YZrOx with 0.05 wt% of Rh, Ru, Pt or Ir). The number of anion vacancies correlates with the number of active Zrcus sites formed upon removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2 during reductive treatment. For quantifying the number of anion vacancies, we carried out O2-titration experiments in the temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor. Under assumption that one O2 molecule fills two anion vacancies, the concentration of the latter in bare YZrOx as well as in YZrOx-supported Pt, Ir, Ru or Rh NPs are 0.9·1017 [24], 4.2·1017, 14.3·1017, 20.0·1017 or 36.8·1017 O-atoms per surface area of the respective catalyst. The number of anion vacancies significantly increased in the presence of supported metal. Moreover, the concentration of anion vacancies depends on the kind of supported metal on the surface of YZrOx. A correlation between the rate of propene formation and the latter values is shown in Fig. S11. The rate of propene formation increases with an increase in the concentration of anion vacancies.
However, the presence of catalytically active Zrcus sites is not the only factor determining catalyst activity in the PDH reaction. The drop in the rate of propene formation with rising reduction degree of Rh- or Ru-containing catalysts (Fig. 4) and large differences in the activity of catalysts with different metal NPs but similar reduction degree (Fig. S10) suggest that there should be interplay between supported metal and catalyst reduction degree. This aspect is further discussed in section 3.8 under consideration of additional experimental data.
3.6. Factors affecting product selectivity
We also analyzed the effects of the kind of supported metal on product selectivity. To this end, selectivity-conversion relationships for gas-phase products (C3H6 and C1–C2 hydrocarbons) and coke were determined. Fig. 5 (a,b) exemplarily shows the dependences obtained for propene selectivity over ZrO2-based catalysts with (i) different amounts of Rh (Fig. 5 (a)) or (ii) 0.05 wt% of Rh, Ru, Pt or Ir (Fig. 5 (b)). Fig. 5 (c) illustrates the effect of metal oxide promoter for ZrO2 on the selectivity-conversion relationship for propene obtained over Rh/ZrO2, Rh/LaZrOx and Rh/YZrOx with 0.05 wt% of the supported metal. Such dependences for C3H6, C1–C2 hydrocarbons and coke over all tested catalysts are given in Figs. S12–S14, Figs. S15–S17 and Figs. S18–S20, respectively.

Reaction condition: 550 °C, C3H8:N2 = 2:3 feed.
In general, the selectivity to propene decreased with rising propane conversion, while the selectivity to C1–C2 hydrocarbons and coke increased. Such dependence suggests that propene is directly formed from propane and then consequently converted into these undesired products. Regardless of the kind of support material, the negative effect of propane conversion on propene selectivity over all catalysts containing Rh (Fig. 5 (a)) or Ru became more pronounced with rising metal concentration (Figs. S12–S14). The selectivity to coke (to major extent) and to cracking products increased accordingly (Figs. S15–S20). In contrast to Rh and Ru, no significant effect of Ir or Pt concentration on the consecutive transformations of propene could be established (Figs. S12–S14). Such difference between the metals suggests that they differ in their ability to react with propene. As exemplarily shown in Fig. 5 (b) for the ZrO2-supported catalysts with metal loading of 0.05 wt%, the metals can be ordered in terms of their influence on propene selectivity as follows Ir > Rh ≈ Ru > Pt. A similar trend was determined for the catalysts based on LaZrOx and YZrOx (Fig. S21).
When comparing the selectivity-conversion relationship for propene over Rh/ZrO2, Rh/LaZrOx and Rh/YZrOx with 0.05 wt% of Rh (Fig. 5 (c)), it becomes obvious that the kind of metal oxide promoter for ZrO2 is also relevant for consecutive propene transformations. Promoting of ZrO2 with Y2O3 or La2O3 has a positive effect on the selectivity to propene with the former promoter showing a stronger effect. Such effect of the promoter is also valid for the catalysts possessing supported Ru or Ir NPs, while no influence was observed for Pt-containing catalysts (Fig. S22).
3.7. Effect of reaction temperature on product selectivity
To check the effect of reaction temperature on product selectivity, we tested LaZrOx- and YZrOx-based catalysts with 0.01 wt% of Rh(Ru) or 0.03 wt% of Pt(Ir) in the PDH reaction at 600 °C. The corresponding selectivity-conversion plots for propene are shown in Figs. 6, 7 . For all catalysts, the negative effect of propane conversion on the desired selectivity was less pronounced when operating at 600 °C in comparison with 550 °C. As a consequence, higher propene selectivity at higher degrees of propane conversion was achieved at 600 °C than at 550 °C. Ir-containing catalysts showed the best performance. For example, propene selectivity of 85 % at propane conversion of about 49 % was achieved over Ir(0.03 wt%)/LaZrOx or 82 % selectivity at 51 % propane conversion over Ir(0.03 wt%)/YZrOx. The positive effect of reaction temperature on propene selectivity should be related to the different activation energies of the pathways of propane dehydrogenation to propene and consecutive propene transformations. It can be assumed that an increase in the reaction temperature accelerates propene desorption and thus undesired reactions as cracking or hydrogenolysis of propene are hindered.

3.8. Active sites and factors affecting their performance
No direct correlation between the rate of propene formation and the concentration of Rh, Ru, Ir or Pt supported on ZrO2-based catalysts could be established, although their activity depended on the kind of supported metal (Fig. 3). Moreover, differently composed catalysts with similar reduction degree strongly differ in their activity (Fig. 4) despite the fact that the ability of the metals to promote the release of lattice oxygen from ZrO2 and accordingly to create Zrcus sites seems to be relevant for propene formation (Fig. S10). Against this background, the below discussion is aimed to get an insight into the role of supported metal in the PDH reaction over ZrO2-based catalysts.
In contrast to all the above catalysts possessing 1 nm NPs, we have additionally prepared a few LaZrOx-based catalysts with supported Rh, Ru or Pt NPs of about 5 nm in diameter. As we used differently sized NPs but similar metal loading, overall surface area of larger NPs is lower than that of smaller ones. This also means that the total boundary area between ZrO2-based supports and metal NPs will decrease with an increase in the size of NPs. As shown in our very recent combined theoretical and experimental study with Rh/ZrO2, lattice oxygen of ZrO2 will be removed preferentially from this area upon catalyst reductive treatment [37]. A similar conclusion should be valid for LaZrOx- and YZrOx-based catalysts. Thus, it is possible to check if the PDH reaction preferentially occurs on Zrcus located in this area.
As seen in Fig. 8, the activity of Pt/LaZrOx does not practically depend on the size of NPs, while the activity of Rh/LaZrOx and Ru/LaZrOx decreases with an increase in the size. Such difference between the Pt- and Rh(Ru)-containing systems may be due to the fact that the presence of Pt has a minor effect on PDH activity of ZrO2-based materials whereas Rh and Ru strongly improve this catalyst performance (Fig. 3). As Rh and Ru are not the main active species in the PDH reaction, the size effect may indicate that this reaction preferably occurs in a close proximity to the supported NPs. The larger the size, the smaller the boundary area (perimeter of NPs) between them and the support is, where Zrcus sites should be located due to the promoting effect of these metals on ZrO2 reducibility upon catalyst treatment with H2.

Is the presence of supported NPs only important for promoting formation of Zrcus sites or also relevant in the course of PDH reaction? To answer this question, we elucidated the role of NPs for H2 activation (adsorption, dissociation and desorption) because our previous DFT calculations of propane dehydrogenation over bare ZrO2 [25,26] predicts that hydrogen formation is the rate-limiting step. For this purpose, we carried out H/D exchange tests over bare YZrOx and YZrOx with supported Rh, Ru, Pt or Ir NPs. To mimic catalyst state in these tests as in the steady-state PDH tests, we applied the same reductive catalyst treatment. When H2 and D2 were pulsed over these catalysts, HD was observed. This means that the catalysts are able to break HH and DD bonds as well as to form new HD bonds.
To derive an insight into the activity of supported metals for H/D exchange, we analyze and discuss now transient responses of D2 and HD. Fig. 9 (a, b) shows their height-normalized forms obtained over YZrOx and Rh/YZrOx, while the corresponding data for other catalysts are presented in Fig. S23. The normalization was performed for a better comparison of the maximum (tmax) of the responses and their width at half-height (th/2). These parameters of HD are related to the intrinsic rate of its formation. The lower these characteristic times, the higher the formation rate is. These values obtained for the tested catalysts are shown in Fig. 9 (c, d). They are lower for all metal-containing samples in comparison with bare YZrOx. The effect of ZrO2 reduction degree on tmax and th/2 can be excluded as Ir/YZrOx, Pt/YZrOx and YZrOx possess a similar reduction degree but differ in these characteristic times. Thus, we put forward that the supported metals are mainly responsible for breaking and forming bonds between two hydrogen atoms in the H/D exchange tests. On this basis, it is suggested that the ability of supported metals for recombining adsorbed hydrogen atoms to yield gas-phase H2 is another effect of supported metals for improving the rate of propene formation in the course of the PDH reaction over ZrO2-based catalysts. The faster the hydrogen formation, the higher the rate of propene formation should be.

3.9. Role of propene adsorption in the course of PDH
Finally, we provide an explanation for a volcano-dependence of the rate of propene formation on Rh or Ru loading (Fig. 3) or ZrO2 reduction degree (Fig. 4). To check if strong adsorption of propene remaining on the catalyst surface after propane dehydrogenation may be responsible for this effect, we investigated propene interaction by means of C3H6-TPD and C3H6 pulse tests. For the latter tests, we used catalysts reduced according to the procedure for steady-state PDH tests to mimic the state of the catalysts under the latter conditions. The responses of C3H6 and Ar (inert standard) recorded for bare ZrO2 and YZrOx at 550 °C are presented in Fig. 10 in the dimensionless form as suggested by Gleaves et al. [38]. The corresponding data for LaZrOx are given in Fig. S24. For ZrO2 and LaZrOx, the responses of Ar (representing simple diffusion) and C3H6 do not differ from each other. Such similarity of these responses indicates that if the adsorption of propene over the catalyst takes place, it is very weak. The strength of adsorption increased for YZrOx as concluded from the fact that the C3H6 response crosses the Ar response. Such crossing is the typical fingerprint for reversible adsorption [38]. In comparison with bare YZrOx, propene adsorbs significantly stronger on Rh/YZrOx, Ru/YZrOx, Ir/YZrOx or Pt/YZrOx as concluded from the fact that the response of C3H6 is located below and does not cross the Ar response (Fig. 10 and Fig. S25). According to Gleaves et al. [38], this situation is typical for irreversible propene adsorption. Taking into account that YZrOx, Ir(0.05 wt%)/YZrOx and Pt(0.05 wt%)/YZrOx have similar reduction degrees (Table 3) but differ in the strength of propene adsorption (Fig. 10 and Fig. S25), it could be assumed that adsorption of propene takes place not only over the support but also over supported metal NPs. The metals can be ordered with respect to their C3H6 adsorption ability as follows Rh ≥ Ru ≥ Ir > Pt. Thus, both, reduction degree of ZrO2 and the kind of supported metal affect the strength of propene adsorption.

Fig. 10. Dimensionless responses of C3H6 and Ar recorded after pulsing of C3H6:Ar = 1:1 at 550 °C over bare ZrO2, YZrOx, Ru(0.05 wt%)/YZrOx or Pt(0.05 wt%)/YZrOx. The responses were transformed according to Gleaves et al. [38].
To check if catalyst ability to desorb propene plays a role in the course of the PDH reaction, we tried to correlate the respective rate with the amount of desorbed propene determined from C3H6-TPD tests (see section 2.3 for experimental details). For the TPD tests, we selected YZrOx-based catalysts with two different metal loading where a negative effect of the latter on the rate of propene formation was established for the Rh-, Ru- or Ir-containing catalysts (Fig. 3). Using the activity and C3H6-TPD data, we prepared Fig. 11. A relationship between the rate of propene formation, metal loading and the amount of desorbed propene can be deduced from this figure. The higher the loading, the higher the amount was obtained. Moreover, a decrease in the rate is also seen with the rising amount. Thus, strong propene adsorption caused by the kind of metal and catalyst reduction degree is suggested to be responsible for the volcano-curve dependence of the rate of propene formation on metal loading or ZrO2 reduction degree due to blocking both Zrcus and surface metal atoms. Strong C3H6 adsorption is also detrimental for the desired selectivity because adsorbed C3H6 species can oligomerize to form coke deposits.

4. Conclusion
In this study, we established that the rate of propene formation and the selectivity-conversion relationships for propene, C1–C2 hydrocarbons and coke depend on (i) the kind of supported metal (Rh, Ru, Pt or Ir) and its loading, (ii) the size of supported metal nanoparticles, (iii) metal oxide promoter for ZrO2 and (iv) reaction temperature. The metals facilitate the creation of catalytically active Zrcus sites upon reductive catalyst treatment and promote hydrogen formation. With this respect, they can be ordered as Rh > Ru > Ir > Pt. In addition, the metals promote desorption of hydrogen in the course of PDH and thus improve catalyst activity.
The kind of metal and ZrO2 reduction degree are also decisive factors affecting propene adsorption. In comparison with Ir, Rh or Ru adsorb propene stronger. This process is also enhanced by ZrO2 reduction degree. Thus, strong propene adsorption causes blockage of PDH active Zrcus sites and metallic sites required for hydrogen formation/desorption. Consequently, the rate of propene formation over catalysts with supported Rh or Ru follows a volcano-type dependence on metal loading or ZrO2 reduction degree. Moreover, strong propene adsorption favors cracking and hydrogenolysis reactions as well as coke formation. These undesired reactions can be partially suppressed upon increasing reaction temperature due to accelerating propene desorption.
