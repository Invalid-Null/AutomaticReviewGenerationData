 The provided document does not contain information relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document focuses on the conversion of glycerol to 1,2-propanediol using copper supported on dolomite catalysts. As there is no discussion of PDH or ODH processes, I have indicated this in the XML output.
