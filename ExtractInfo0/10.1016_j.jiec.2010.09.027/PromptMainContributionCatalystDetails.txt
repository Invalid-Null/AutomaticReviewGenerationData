Pt–Sn-based catalyst's intensification using Al2O3–SAPO-34 as a support for propane dehydrogenation to propylene
Abstract
The addition of Al2O3 up to 20% (as cementing agent) in SAPO-34 support significantly integrates metal functions of Pt–Sn-based catalyst, ultimately improves catalytic performance for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene. Superior propane conversion (initially above 40%) and propylene selectivity (around 95%) is obtained experimentally over Pt–Sn/Al2O3–SAPO-34. The results were found promising and compared with Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 under identical operating conditions. Better platinum dispersion and higher active platinum sites are characterized by TEM and hydrogen-chemisorption analysis. Moreover, the possible metal interactions with different supports were configured. Therefore, light alkane dehydrogenation to alkene was enhanced using surface modified support Al2O3–SAPO-34 for Pt–Sn-based catalysts.
1. Introduction
In today's scenario, high propylene demand emphasizes its production from non-petroleum based routes using on-purpose propylene technologies. Among these on-purpose propylene technologies, propane dehydrogenation is relatively economical and shortest route to propylene. Industrial production of propylene from direct alkane dehydrogenation is complicated due to clashing kinetics and thermodynamic limitations [1], [2], [3]. Moreover, it has plenty of rooms for integration with exiting refinery setup, while their engineering constraints are too complex. In order to overcome the technical obstacles, number of catalysts has been proposed in last two decades, in particular chromium and platinum based catalysts. Severe operating conditions magnify deep side reactions and coke formation. Unfortunately, activity and selectivity of these catalysts remain unsatisfactory.
Pt–Sn-based catalysts supported on Al2O3 and ZSM-5 zeolite were discussed in many studies [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. It is longer been known that the support plays a vital role in stabilizing the activity of catalysts. A number of drawbacks were also observed to be associated with supports. Al2O3 supported catalyst is quickly deactivated [10], [11]. Later the concept is propagated that the acid sites play active role for dehydrogenation reaction, therefore, Pt–Sn-based ZSM-5 zeolite supported catalyst has been recommended. Its performance is poorer than Pt–Sn/Al2O3, while the stability is much better, and number of attempts have been made to improve its performance by incorporating more metallic promoter like Sodium, zinc, lanthanum, calcium, rubidium, lithium, magnesium, cesium, etc. and/or by increasing the Si/Al ratio [7], [12], [13], [14]. But higher surface acidity leads the reaction towards cracking. As coke is fatal to every catalyst and frequent regeneration is needed in the process of dehydrogenation, the performance of these catalysts largely suffers by regeneration either with steam or oxygen due to dealumination, tin loss and platinum sintering. Recently a new concept was also proposed by Su et al., used non-metal based carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a catalyst for dehydrogenation of 1-butene to butadiene, but its performance for alkane dehydrogenation is unsatisfactory [15]. The propane conversion over CNT is limited to 10% with propylene selectivity around 50%.
Recently a highly selective and hydrothermally stable Pt–Sn-based SAPO-34 supported novel catalyst has given a breakthrough in light olefin production via direct dehydrogenation route [1], [2], [3], [16]. The dehydrogenation performance of Pt–Sn-based catalysts depend on platinum, tin and support interaction, lower Sn(0) and Pt–Sn alloy concentration. These all features were appeared using SAPO-34 as a support. The catalysts undergo aging/deactivation owing to aggregation and/or platinum particle sintering and coke fouling. The novel Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst enhances support-metal interaction and platinum dispersion, and has been found to be inherently stable towards regeneration due to its silicon based acid sites [1], [2], [3]. Role of Sn as a promoter is well defined now [3]. It is also known that the Pt–Sn supported on Al2O3 demonstrates better dispersion and active platinum sites formation than on silica supported catalyst [5], [17]. While adverse affect was noted on aluminum usage as binder for Pt–Sn/ZSM-5 because some aluminum species migrate into the ZSM-5 framework during calcinations and produce some acid sites [18].
Herein we explore a novel combination of Al2O3 with SAPO-34 for Pt–Sn-based catalyst which improves platinum dispersion, desired active platinum sites concentration (platinum anchored through SnOx) and ultimately has improved direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene capability [1], [3], [19]. The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method after adding Al2O3 as binder for SAPO-34. The prepared catalyst was analyzed experimentally and characterised.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
SAPO-34 was prepared by mixing Al2O3:P2O5:SiO2:TEA:H2O in the molar ratio of 1:1:0.5:2:100, details are available elsewhere [20], [21], [22]. SAPO-34 was palletized with a binder Al2O3 in 20 wt.% [23], [24]. The bimetallic Pt–Sn-based samples of specific metallic content were prepared by sequential impregnation method [25], [26] after calcination of Al2O3–SAPO-34 at 550 °C (BET surface area 441 m2/g). The support was first impregnated with an aqueous solution of SnCl2·2H2O at 80 °C to add 1 wt.% tin in the catalyst. After impregnation the samples were dried at 110 °C for 3 h and calcined at 500 °C for 4 h. Later the tin doped SAPO-34 was co-impregnated again with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 at 75 °C to give a 0.5 wt.% platinum in the final catalyst, then dried and calcined in the same way as above [27]. The catalyst was dechlorinated at 500 °C for 4 h with nitrogen mixed dilute steam, reduced under flowing hydrogen (with flow rate 8 ml/min) at 500 °C for 8 h prior to the reastion test.
2.2. Reaction test
The performance of prepared Pt–Sn/Al2O3–SAPO-34 and Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 samples were investigated for direct propane dehydrogenation in a continuous flow micro-reactor at ambient pressure [6], [7], [8]. In each experiment, measured amount of catalyst samples was loaded into the reactor in order to maintain the desired WHSV 2.79 h−1. The reaction mixture was composed of H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25 charged into the reactor. The product distribution was analyzed by an online gas chromatography system having Al2O3 capillary column equipped with FID detector. All values were calculated in weight percentages.
2.3. Catalyst characterization analysis
BET surface area was measured by using nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms on an automatic analyzer (Autosrb-1-C). The catalyst samples were heated at 350 °C for 1 h under vacuum to remover gas to enhance adsorption before BET test.
Metallic contents of Pt–Sn/Al2O3–SAPO-34 and Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 were obtained by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements on a Shimadzu XRF 1700 fluorimeter.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of catalyst samples were obtained on a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku-2500), equipped with a copper anode tube operated at 40 kV. The Kα radiation was selected with a monochromator and spectra was scanned at a rate of 5°/min from 5° to 35° (an angular range 2θ).
The acid properties of SAPO-34 and Al2O3–SAPO-34 supported catalysts were determined by ammonia-temperature-programmed desorption using Autochem-II 2920 analyzer. About 0.2 g of catalyst sample was used for analysis in a U-type quartz reactor. The samples were pre-treated with 99.99 dry argon at 500 °C for 1 h prior to ammonia adsorption. Then samples were saturated with ammonia at room temperature. The baseline was stabilized by flowing argon with the flow rate of 30 ml/min and subsequently, the temperature was raised to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min to desorb physically adsorbed ammonia. The ammonia desorption profile was obtained from a thermal conductivity detector.
Coke deposited on catalysts during propane dehydrogenation was determined by oxygen-pulse experiments using gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD. Pulses of pure oxygen (99.99%) were injected at 750 °C. The pulses of pure oxygen were continued until deposited coke was fully converted to carbobdioxide, which was measured by TCD detector and amount of coke was calculated.
Ability of catalysts to adsorb hydrogen was determined by pulse chemisorptions of hydrogen on a conventional setup using gas chromatograph (7890-II) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) [28]. Samples (0.2 g of catalyst) were reduced first under flowing hydrogen (5 ml/min) at 400 °C for 2 h. Then purged with nitrogen at 500 °C for 1 h and were successively cooled to room temperature. Samples were saturated by hydrogen pulses of 5 ml/min of 5% (v/v) at 25, 300 and 500 °C. The time between pulses was 3 min. and pulses were countinued until no further gas uptake was observed. The total amount of adsorption was calculated by adding gas uptake observed in the series of gas injections.
The active metal dispersion on different supports was obtained using a JEM 2010 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (operated at 120.0 kV). The samples were prepared using a common sonication method, while thick samples were dispersed in ethanol.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst performance analysis
The accurate nature of Al2O3–SAPO-34 support for Pt–Sn-based catalyst is complicated and the suitable combination needs superior experimental performance for justification. Therefore, comprehensive experimentation was conducted in order to demonstrate superior activity of the Pt–Sn/Al2O3–SAPO-34 for propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The results are shown in Fig. 1. It is observed that the activity of Pt–Sn-based catalyst was integrated a lot by cementing SAPO-34 with Al2O3 before impregnation of metals. Extensive investigation shows that Al2O3 addition after impregnation of metals fails to give suitable results. The higher conversion over Pt–Sn/Al2O3–SAPO-34 catalyst for longer operation suggests that catalyst activity was improved and reduced coke formation or better coke management (transfer of coke from metal site to support [3]). The results are shown in Table 1. Moreover, it is worthwhile that the catalyst activity is recoverable by re-dispersion of platinum by chlorination, carried out after regeneration. The enhancement capabilities of Pt–Sn/Al2O3–SAPO-34 for propane dehydrogenation are characterised in next section and compared with Pt–Sn/SAPO-34.

3.2. Catalyst characterization
The metallic contents were confirmed after catalyst preparation by XRF analysis. The results are shown in Table 2. The surface area was decreased over Pt–Sn/Al2O3–SAPO-34 due to change in surface characteristics owing to pore blocking of SAPO-34.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Pt–Sn/Al2O3–SAPO-34, Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 and SAPO-34 are shown in Fig. 2. It was observed that after the metallic incorporation, the original structure/topology of the support was not changed. The peaks for PtOx were not found owing to their smaller concentration and large diameter of platinum particles than SAPO-34 channels, while Al2O3 was not appeared due to it amorphous nature.

The suitable acidity of support is the potential requirement of intermediate conversion to propylene (with higher selectivity) without take part into cracking [1], [2], [3]. Almost negligible influence of Al2O3 addition as binder on acidity of the prepared catalyst was observed in Ammonia-TPD analysis shown in Fig. 3. Two ammonia desorption peaks obtained between 200–230 °C and 400–430 °C demonstrate weak acid sites (Si–O–Si) and strong acid sites (due to framework aluminum species), respectively. While small shifts in peaks towards higher temperatures were observed due to changes in acid intensity. The slight increase in weak acid sites and slight decrease in strong acid sites over Pt–Sn/Al2O3–SAPO-34 demonstrates that interaction of platinum was improved. This interaction consumed acid sites at higher temperatures.

From our previous extensive characterization analysis of Pt–Sn-based catalysts, it is observed that hydrogen-pulse chemisorptions analysis is an effective technique for characterizing bi-metallic catalyst for dehydrogenation. This experiment also helps to figure out platinum dispersion, its interaction with Tin promoter and intensified support. The existence of different Pt–Sn alloys is ruled out as we used sequential impregnation method with lower metallic contents.
The results of hydrogen chemisorptions of Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 and Pt–Sn/Al2O3–SAPO-34 catalysts are shown in Table 3. Where the Hydrogen uptakes of the samples are shown at temperatures 500, 300, and 25 °C. The amount of hydrogen chemisorptions at low temperature (25 °C) suggests the size of the platinum particles; and at high temperatures (500 and 300 °C) hydrogen chemisorptions are related to the interactions between platinum and Tin promoter and support [28]. Directly anchored platinum with SAPO-34 sites is favorable for low temperature Hydrogen absorptions and is responsible for the hydrogenolysis reaction which leads towards coke precursors. Platinum sites (anchored with SAPO-34 through SnOx) can adsorb more Hydrogen at high temperatures and are the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. A large improvement in hydrogen absorption at high temperature demonstrates that the Pt–Sn combination is significantly improved, which is indicative of enhanced platinum dispersion and suitable charge transfer from Tin to platinum which enhanced active sites (Pt–SnOx–SAPO-34). This integration of interaction between Pt–Sn and support is intensified with the addition of Al2O3 to SAPO-34 as binder.

There are two possible opportunities for the presence Al2O3, one in the framework and second as surface species. It is well known that about 80% of aluminum present in the SAPO-34 framework is in Si–(4Al) pattern. In accordance with the agreement of existing knowledge of possible aluminum interactions with SAPO-34, a generalized aluminum interaction arrangement during cementing process with SAPO-34 is drawn in Scheme 1. Moreover, the Pt–Sn interaction over different supports Al2O3, SiO2, SAPO-34 and Al2O3–SAPO-34 were demonstrated by TEM images in Scheme 1. These images clearly show platinum dispersion abilities of these supports. On Al2O3–SAPO-34 supported catalyst (Scheme 1(d)), platinum particle size is far smaller and well dispersed in comparison with platinum presence on other supports. It's further known that interaction of Tin in presence of Al2O3 stabilizes its oxidation state (>0), enhances platinum dispersion, hydrogen adsorption ability and catalyst stability [5]. In this scenario it is deduced that the concentration of platinum active site needed for dehydrogenation is integrated with better dispersion using Al2O3 as binding agent with SAPO-34 support of Pt–Sn catalyst.

4. Conclusions
The principal concern is to improve Pt–Sn-based catalyst's stability and activity for propane dehydrogenation to propylene (higher propylene selectivity and propane conversion) was achieved using Al2O3–SAPO-34 as a support. Therefore, propane dehydrogenation to propylene enjoys the plethora of mechanistic/kinetic subtleties in the presence of Pt–Sn/Al2O3–SAPO-34 catalyst. In conclusion intensified catalyst has higher number of active platinum sites and well dispersed pattern with desired metallic combination which enhances its dehydrogenation activity. Therefore, higher propylene selectivity and propane conversion is achieved over Pt–Sn/Al2O3–SAPO-34.
