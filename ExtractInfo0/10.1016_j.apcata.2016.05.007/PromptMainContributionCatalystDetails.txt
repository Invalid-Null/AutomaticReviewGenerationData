1. Introduction
Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to obtain propylene is a significant chemical process, which has distinct advantages over the steam cracking process and fluid catalytic cracking [1], [2], [3]. At present, chromium oxide(CrOx) [4], [5] and Platinum(Pt) [6], [7], [8] supported catalysts are generally considered two commercialized catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane.
Among various reported catalysts, the supported chromium oxide catalysts are intensively attracted since they show good activity and low cost. It is generally accepted that the catalytic properties of chromium oxides catalysts strongly depend on several factors such as support and promoters. As regards the role of support, it not only influences the catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reaction, but also changes the dispersion of surface chromium species. The chromium oxide supported on different supports were studied to analyze the support effect for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane(ODHP) [9]. Besides, the preparation of Cr-MCM-41 by direct hydrothermal synthesis was reported as an active catalyst for ODHP process, in which monomertic Cr species was active sites for isobutene dehydrogenation reaction [10], [11]. Especially, the isolated Cr sites were more active on mesoporous zeolites like SBA-15, while oligomeric Cr species were more active and selective for xCr-Al2O3 [12]. Thus, definite knowledge regarding the supports is important to better understand the catalytic performance of Cr species in ODHP or DHP.
From the previous literatures, many authors focused their attention on Cr-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Shishido et al. [18] investigated the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane over Cr-based catalysts. The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2; while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2. Therefore, it is worth noting that chromium oxide species supported on γ–Al2O3 favors the propane dehydrogenation reaction without CO2.
On the other hand, multicomponent oxides supported catalysts seem to be promising materials for the dehydrogenation of alkanes. The introduction of potassium was discovered to influence the reducibility of the catalysts and the acid surface features [19]; the calcium addition with an appropriate content altered the active sites distribution, promoting the formation of dispersed Cr6+ species [20]; the tin promoter inhibited the formation of coking [21]; as nickel oxide catalysts were ascertained to be good potential catalysts for dehydrogenation reaction [22], [23], [24], [25], nickel could be a suitable addition for Cr based catalysts.
Nevertheless, the chromium oxide supported on γ–Al2O3 with doping nickel for the dehydrogenation of propane has been scarcely studied. Herein, Cr-Ni/Al catalysts were prepared and used as efficient catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. To further understand the constructive role of nickel on Cr supported catalysts, physico-chemical properties were characterized, which could verify the vital information about the structure-performance relationship of catalysts and the interaction between nickel and chromium.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A series of Ni/Al, Cr/Al and Ni-Cr/Al samples with nominal Ni loading of 5 wt% and different Cr contents were prepared by the method of incipient wetness impregnation. Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (99.9%, Aladdin) and chromium nitrate nonahydrate were used (99.9%, Aladdin) as the precursors, respectively. In detail, a certain amount of γ–Al2O3 (Aladdin) was immersed in Ni(NO3)3 aqueous solution with a required concentration, aging for one day at room temperature. The prepared sample was dried in an air oven at 50 °C for 2 h and then at 120 °C for 4 h in order that the Ni precursor would have a good dispersion on the support. After the drying treatment, the samples were calcined in air at 600 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 °C/min. Finally, we got the Ni/Al catalyst which had 5 wt% Ni content. Similarly, the Cr/Al samples with nominal Cr content of 0–5 wt% were prepared. Next, Ni-Cr/Al catalysts were prepared by introducing Cr precursor into the Ni/Al catalyst. The impregnation method and the processing procedure were the same as the preparation of Ni/Al catalyst. The nominal Cr content of Cr-Ni/Al catalysts varies from 0 to 5 wt%. The catalysts were named as xCr-Ni/Al, where x represented the mass ratio of Cr/γ–Al2O3. For instance, the 1.0Cr-Ni/Al sample meant that it contained 1.0 wt% chromium and 5 wt% nickel added on the γ–Al2O3.
2.2. Catalyst characterizations
2.2.1. XRD
The X-ray diffraction patterns of samples were characterized on a Bragg-Brentano diffractometer (Rigaku D/Max-2000) using a monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) of graphite curve mono-chromator, scanning from 10° to 80° at a speed of 4°/min.
2.2.2. BET
Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were performed at −77 K upon NOVA4000 (Quantachrome, USA). Approximately 0.1 g of sample was previously degassed at 300 °C for 4 h. The specific surface areas of samples were obtained using standard multipoint BET analysis method. The BJH method was used to calculate the average pore radius, and the pore volume was calculated at the maximum relative pressure.
2.2.3. NH3/CO2-TPD
In order to evaluate the surface acidity and basicity of Cr/Al and Cr-Ni/Al catalysts, NH3-/CO2-TPD adsorption/desorption investigations were carried out using a TP-5080 adsorption instrument equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The number and strength of acid/basic sites were analyzed from the intensity and position temperature of TPD signals, respectively. Prior to the measurement, 0.1 g of sample was pretreated at 500 °C for 1 h in a flow of dry helium (30 ml/min). Then, a high purified NH3 flow was adsorbed at 120 °C for 30 min in order that all the acid sites were saturated with NH3. Then, the sample was blown for another 45 min so as to remove the physical absorption of NH3. In the end, the temperature programmed desorption was performed from 120 to 650 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. CO2-TPD experiments were conducted to detect the basic sites of the samples with the similar procedure of NH3-TPD.
2.2.4. H2-TPR
The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments of catalysts were carried out on an autosrob-iQ (Quantachrome Instruments), and the consumption of H2 was detected by a thermal conduction detector (TCD). The catalyst power (80 mg), being supported by fluffy quartz wool, was loaded in a U-shape quartz tube reactor. Before measurement, the sample was treated in a flowing Ar (15 ml/min) for 1 h at 500 °C. Then the samples were reduced in a mixture of 10% H2 in Ar from 40 to 1000 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min.
2.2.5. XPS
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of as-prepared and spent catalysts were conducted upon Perkin–Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA with a Al-Kα X-ray source. The binding energies of Cr2p and Ni2p core levels were detected using the C1s peak at 284.9 eV as a reference. The surface contents of chromium and nickel were obtained from the peak areas, calculated through an XPS peak-fit software.
2.2.6. UV–vis
The diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra of catalysts were recorded on a UV-3600 instrument. The samples were placed in a quartz fillister. The spectra were collected from 240 to 900 nm referenced to BaSO4.
2.3. Catalytic activity measurement
The DHP reaction was performed with the prepared catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure. The reaction was conducted at 823 K for 3 h with a sample loading of 0.2 g. Prior to the reaction, it took 1 h to achieve the target temperature (823 K) and then kept it for 0.5 h in Ar flow at 20 ml/min. The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) process was carried out with a feed flow of C3H8/Ar mixtures (C3H8:Ar = 1:9, molar ratio). The feed and exit flows were collected and analyzed by a gas chromatography (GC, SP-6890) using a flame ionization detector (FID). The propane conversion and the propylene selectivity were calculated according to the method described in the previous references [3], [6], [26], [27], [28]:
(1)
C3H8 conversion = (C3H8in − C3H8out)/C3H8in
(2)
C3H6 selectivity = C3H6out/(C3H8in − C3H8out)
where C3H8in and C3H8out are the molar content of propane in feed and exit flows respectively, C3H6out is the propylene molar content in exit flow.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterizations of catalysts
3.1.1. Textural properties
Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. All the samples exhibit type IV isotherms with type H1 hysteretic loops [29], [30], which is indicative of the presence of mesopores. The specific surface area (SBET), total pore volume (Vp) and average pore diameter (Dp) of samples are displayed in Table 1. The SBET of Cr/Al samples generally decreases with increasing Cr content, and the similar trend is also presented for Cr-Ni/Al samples. This implies that Ni or Cr species immigrates into the pores of support and the mesoporous structure keeps well during the process of preparation. In addition, the average pore diameter for Cr-Ni/Al samples is smaller than that of corresponding Cr/Al samples. This indicates that a fraction of porosity in the support is blocked by the doped Ni species.

3.1.2. XRD analysis
The X-ray diffraction patterns of samples are displayed in Fig. 2. All the samples exhibits peaks at 37.6°, 45.8°, 66.8°, which are attributed to the characteristic peaks of γ-Al2O3 (JCPD Card No. 10-0425). This indicates that the structure of γ-Al2O3 is kept well in the impregnation process. No peaks related to the crystalline phases for NiO, Cr2O3 or NiAlO4 spinel [31], [32] are detected by XRD, suggesting a good dispersion of oxides on the supports.

3.1.3. NH3/CO2-TPD analysis
NH3/CO2-TPD is a popular method to determine the acidity/basicity of solid catalysts by ammonia/carbon dioxide [33], [34], [35]. It is well known that acid and basic properties markedly affect the catalytic activity of catalysts. The surface acid-base properties would be changed considerably when active metal oxides are loaded onto support surfaces [36]. In this case, it is essential to research the basicity and acidity of Cr-Ni/Al and Cr/Al catalysts. The semi-quantitative NH3/CO2-TPD data are compiled in Table 2, Table 3, which are obtained by the deconvolution of peaks using the Gaussian deconvolution method. The results show that acid and basic sites co-exist on the surfaces of all the samples. The patterns of NH3-TPD for all catalysts exhibit three desorption peaks (Fig. 3). The peak centered at 170–190 °C corresponds to weak acid sites. The peak centered at 230–250 °C is attributed to medium acid sites, and the high temperature desorption peak at 350–410 °C represents strong acid sites on catalyst surface [3]. The percentage of acid/base sites is calculated according to their corresponding peak area. As shown in Table 2, the Cr-Ni/Al catalysts exhibit larger total peak area compared to Ni/Al catalysts. This suggests that more acid sites are presented on the surfaces of Cr-Ni/Al samples with the addition of Cr species. The percentage of weak acidity for Cr-Ni/Al samples increases with increasing Cr content; while it is practically lower than that of the corresponding Cr/Al samples containing the same Cr loading. Consequently, the addition of nickel facilitates the decrease of surface weak acid sites. Table 3 shows the distribution of surface basicity on the catalysts. The peaks at 174–184 °C, 241–271 °C, 360–460 °C belong to weak, medium and strong basic sites, respectively. The total surface basicity of Cr-Ni/Al samples is much less than that for Ni/Al and corresponding Cr/Al catalysts. Compared to the Cr/Al samples, the ratio of weak basic sites for Cr-Ni/Al catalysts slightly increases. It can be inferred that the introduction of nickel increases the percentage content of surface weak basic sites but decreases the percentage content of surface weak acid sites. The doping of nickel significantly modifies the acid-base distribution of the samples.

3.1.4. H2-TPR analysis
The temperature–programmed reduction (TPR) profiles of Cr/Al and Cr-Ni/Al catalysts are presented in Fig. 4. For each Cr/Al sample, one single reduction peak appears in the range of 250–450 °C, corresponding to the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ [37], [38], [39]. The temperature of maximum peak for Cr/Al samples ranges from 400 °C to 350 °C with the increase of Cr content. For the Cr-Ni/Al catalysts, the reduction peak of Cr6+ species has the similar trend as Cr/Al samples, and its maximum peak appears to move a lower temperature varying from 350 °C to 300 °C. The shift of these reduction peaks for Cr/Al and Cr-Ni/Al catalysts is attributed to the variation of Cr content [40]. Moreover, it is evident that the reduction peaks of Ni-promoted Cr/Al catalysts are shifted to lower temperature. For example, the maximum reduction peak of the 2.5Cr/Al catalyst without Ni manifests itself at 340 °C, whereas that of 2.5Cr-Ni/Al catalyst is located at about 317 °C. This indicates that the addition of nickel reduces the interaction between chromium and γ-Al2O3. At the same time, a new high temperature peak located at from 600 °C to 870 °C is assigned to the reduction of NiAl2O4 spinel [31], [41], [42], which is hardly detected by XRD [43]. It is thought that the higher reduction temperature is owing to strong interaction between Ni species and the support. As the content of chromium increases, the reduction peak for NiAl2O4 spinel moves to a higher temperature. In other words, the Ni species formed in NiAl2O4 spinel is difficult to be reduced with the increase of chromium loading. This suggests that chromium species may have certain influence on the interaction between Ni species and γ-Al2O3, or there may exist interaction between Ni and Cr species [44]. The hydrogen consumption and the value of H2/Crtot ratio for all the catalysts are given in Table 4. The H2 consumption of Cr species for both Cr/Al and Cr-Ni/Al samples increases gradually as the content of Cr ranges from 1% to 5%, which indicates that the content of Cr6+ species increases. Compared to Cr/Al samples, the H2 consumption of Cr species and the H2/Crtot ratio of Cr-Ni/Al catalysts noticeably both decrease, which suggest that the part of bulk Cr6+ species may be reduced owing to the addition of nickel. Besides, the H2 consumption of Ni species for Cr-Ni/Al samples also rises with increasing chromium content. The H2/Nitot ratio varies little for Cr-Ni/Al samples.

3.1.5. XPS analysis
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as a semi-quantitative detection technology is applied to detect the surface properties of the catalysts. Fig. 5 illustrates the Ni2p, Cr2p XPS spectra of Cr/Al and Ni-Cr/Al catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, two peaks at ca. 579 eV and ca. 576 eV are typical characteristics of Cr2p3/2 XPS spectra for Cr6+ and Cr3+ respectively [45], [46], [47], [48]. The detailed XPS data acquired through a peak–fitting method are collected in Table 5. It can be seen that the surface Cr6+/Al and the Cr3+/Al ratio increase evidently when nickel is introduced, suggesting that nickel addition is contributed to the formation of surface Cr6+ and Cr3+. Additionally, with the increase of Cr loading, the surface Cr/Al ratio for Cr-Ni/Al samples increases more pronouncedly than that for Cr/Al catalysts, implying that nickel promotes the formation of surface Cr species effectively [38].

In the case of Ni/Al catalysts, the Ni2p3/2 peak at 855.7 eV as well as a satellite peak at 861.9 eV is presented in Fig. 5c. It is significantly different from typical binding energy for NiO and Ni0, which are located at ca. 855.0 eV [49] and ca. 852.6 eV [50], [51] respectively. For the γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts with low nickel content, nickel interacts strongly with support and is not presented as NiO [32]. A different form of nickel ions is presented on the surface of support, which can be attributed to the interaction with γ-Al2O3. Bortolozzi et al. [52] proposed that NiO exhibited a binding energy difference of about 18.6 eV between Ni2p3/2 and Ni2p1/2 main peaks, and the difference of 17.5 eV was attributed to NiAl2O4 spinel structure. As shown in Fig. 5c, the binding energy of Ni2p3/2 ranging 855.7 eV–856.1 eV with a spin-orbit splitting value of 17.6 eV is observed, which coincides with the characteristic Ni2p binding energy for nickel aluminate in literature [53]. It can be concluded that NiAl2O4 spinel should be formed and there exists strong nickel-γ-alumina interaction, which is also proofed by TPR results.
Furthermore, it should be noted that as Cr content increase, the binding energy value of Ni2p for Cr-Ni/Al catalysts seems to be higher compared to that for Ni/Al samples (Table 5), while the binding energy for Cr3+ and Cr6+ in Cr/Al samples is higher than that in Cr-Ni/Al samples. For instance, the binding energy of Cr3+2p3/2 decreases 0.3 eV for 2.5Cr-Ni/Al catalyst compared to 2.5Cr/Al sample while the binding energy of Ni2+2p3/2 increases 0.1 eV. This implies that electrons transfer from Ni to Cr atoms, and thus leads to Ni with deficient electrons and Cr with enriched electrons [54], [55]. This proves that it becomes easily to reduce Cr species, and the surface electron dispersion of Cr species is modified when nickel is doped.
3.1.6. UV–vis analysis
Fig. 6 displays the UV–vis spectra of the catalysts. Two typical absorption bands at 260–280 nm and 370–380 nm are assigned to OCr(VI) charge transfers in chromate species [11], [56], [57], which are the main peaks for all the samples. It is accepted that the absorption band at about 600 nm is the characteristic peaks of Cr3+ in octahedral symmetry of Cr2O3 [58], [59], which is not observed in the cases of Cr/Al samples, suggesting that chromium species has a good dispersion on the support. As the content of chromium increases, the intensity of UV–vis spectra peaks correspondingly decreases owing to the presence of nickel. This implies that oligomeric chromium species may be formed on the support surface [60], which keeps good correspondence with the H2-TPR results. Additionally, a new weak peak located at 600–610 nm appears for Ni/Al sample and Cr-Ni/Al catalysts. According to the literature [61], the peaks at 372, 598 and 640 nm were the typical absorption bands for Ni2+ species in a spinel structure. Thus, it can be inferred that Ni2+ may have a strong interaction with γ-Al2O3, producing a new type nickel aluminate species. This result is in accordance with the TPR and XPS results [62].

3.2. Catalytic performances
The propane conversions and the propylene selectivity for all the samples are compared in Fig. 7a and b respectively. As shown in Fig. 7a, it is obvious that almost all samples present a low propane conversion in the initial reaction stage. This implies that an induction period is needed to fully develop the Cr active sites [63], [64], [65]. The Ni/Al catalyst is also active for propane dehydrogenation [25], [66], and exhibits the lowest initial conversion of about 11% [67], [68]. The propane conversions for both Cr/Al and Cr-Ni/Al catalysts grow with the increase of Cr content, suggesting that chromium species is active for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. At the same time, the propane conversions for Cr-Ni/Al catalysts are much higher than that of the corresponding Cr/Al samples containing the same Cr content. For example, the average propane conversion of 1.0Cr-Ni/Al catalyst (23%) is far higher than that of 1.0Cr/Al sample (10%). The propane conversion for xCr-Ni/Al is about 9–24% higher than that of xCr/Al (x = 1.0, 2.5, 5.0). Interestingly, the propane conversion for 1.0Cr-Ni/Al catalyst is about 23% nearly approaching to that of 2.5Cr/Al catalyst (29%); and the propane conversion for 2.5Cr-Ni/Al (47%) is also close to that of 5.0Cr/Al (43%) sample. Therefore, the addition of Ni could enhance the activity of Cr/Al catalysts markedly. From Fig. 7b, the Ni/Al catalyst also exhibits the lowest propylene selectivity, which may be due to that nickel loaded catalyst arouse the cleavage of CC bond [69], [70]. By doped with Ni species, the propylene selectivities for Cr-Ni/Al catalysts are higher than those of Cr/Al catalysts, which is more evident for the coupling catalysts 1.0Cr-Ni/Al and 1.0Cr/Al. Based on the results shown in Fig. 7a and b, it can be concluded that the addition of nickel has a significant promotion effect on the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation for Cr/Al catalysts.

In order to investigate the regeneration of xCr-Ni/Al catalysts, 2.5Cr-Ni/Al catalyst is chosen as representative sample. The result is shown in Fig. 8. The spent catalyst is regenerated by re-calcination in situ with flowing air at 550 °C for 2 h, and then purged by Ar for another 1 h. It is obvious that the initial activity of 2.5Cr-Ni/Al catalyst can not be fully regained. The original propane conversion is about 42% in the first cycle; while it is only maintained 28% in the second cycle. After the four reaction-regeneration cycles, the initial activity suffered distinct decline which is about 15% in the fourth cycle. However, the selectivity to propylene retains about 95% for each cycle.

Fig. 8. Catalyst reuse for dehydrogenation of propane by 2.5Cr-Ni/Al (conditions: T = 550 °C, C3H8:Ar (molar ratio) = 1:9, total flow = 20 ml/min, mcat. = 0.2 g).
Attempt is made to illustrate the unrecoverable initial activity for 2.5Cr-Ni/Al catalyst. The H2-TPR profiles of fresh catalyst of 2.5Cr-Ni/Al and the fourth cycle of 2.5Cr-Ni/Al catalyst after calcined in air flow are comparably shown in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 9, the spent catalyst still presents two reduction peaks after four cycles. The low temperature peak which belongs to the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ has a small peak area. The ratio of H2/Cr (Table 4) for regenerated 2.5Cr-Ni/Al catalyst is much lower than that for fresh 2.5Cr-Ni/Al catalyst. It means that the spent catalyst has a much lower Cr6+ species content than the fresh one. Besides, the XPS data (Table 5) reveals that the regenerated catalyst has a less content of surface Cr and the ratio of Cr/Al and Cr6+/Al is lower than the fresh one. These results indicate that a portion of Cr(III) species formed from Cr(VI) species can not be converted to the high oxidation state Cr(VI) species during the regeneration process [71].

Fig. 10 shows the stability of the 2.5Cr-Ni/Al sample for propane dehydrogenation with the time on stream. Propane conversion decreases with increasing reaction time. Thus, the decrease of propylene yield can be attributed to carbon deposition and the change of Cr species [72] on the surface of 2.5Cr-Ni/Al catalyst. The propylene selectivity is found to be relatively constant (∼95%) over the dehydrogenation reaction.

Fig. 10. Catalyst stability of 2.5Cr-Ni/Al for dehydrogenation of propane (conditions: T = 550 °C, C3H8:Ar (molar ratio) = 1:9, total flow = 20 ml/min, mcat. = 0.2 g).
Generally, H2 reduction, oxidation treatment, and the addition of promoters can lead to a chromium re-dispersion [73]. In this work, as the nickel is added to Cr/Al catalyst, the process of re-impregnation and re-baking promotes the re-dispersion of Cr species. Weckhuysen and Wachs [74] demonstrated that two types of surface chromium oxide species were presented on inorganic oxides: monomeric species which was difficult to reduce, and polymetric species which was more easily reduced on the same support. Kumar et al. [12] reported the oligomeric degree of Cr species varied with the Cr content ranging from 1 wt% to 5 wt%. Oligomeric chromium species supported on γ-Al2O3 exhibited a high catalytic activity and was easy to be reduced owing to the weaker interaction of the oligomeric Cr species with the support [74], [75]. Compared to Cr/Al catalysts, the TPR data shows that the reduction peaks of Cr-Ni/Al catalysts shift to a lower temperature. It can be suggested that the interaction between Cr species and support is weakened, and oligomeric Cr is rearranged during the preparation of Cr-Ni/Al catalysts, which is in favor of the higher catalytic performance of Cr-Ni/Al catalysts (Fig. 7). The UV–vis measurement keeps a good accordance with the TPR data. What’s more, the fast reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ over chromium/alumina under a propane steam was detected in the literature [76], [77] which can explain the existence of the induction period. The surface Cr3+ ions, formed through reduction of chromium in high oxidation states is more catalytically active than non-redox Cr3+ [78]. The H2 consumption of chromium, the surface Cr6+/Cr3+ and Cr6+/Cr ratio decreases rather obviously, and the surface Cr3+/Cr increases more evidently in case of the Cr-Ni/Al catalysts compared to that for Cr/Al catalysts. This suggests that a portion of Cr6+ species may be converted to Cr3+ species which would be advantageous to the dehydrogenation activity [38], [60]. It is important to note that hydrogen consumption (Table 4) and the ratio of Cr6+/Cr3+ (Table 5) of the catalysts can be correlated well with the dehydrogenation activity (Fig. 7). Both of them decrease more evidently in case of Cr-Ni/Al catalysts than that for the Cr/Al catalysts with same Cr content; while the catalytic activity for xCr-Ni/Al samples is much higher than that for xCr/Al catalysts(x = 1.0, 2.5, 5.0). It can be speculated that the higher activity of the Cr-Ni/Al catalysts is ascribed to the addition of nickel, which promotes the formation of Cr3+ species from Cr6+ species.
As mentioned in XPS results, there exist two types of chromium states (Cr3+and Cr6+). The content of surface Cr species for Cr-Ni/Al catalysts is higher than that for Cr/Al catalysts. At the same time, the binding energy value of Ni2p and Cr2p has a complementary change resulting in Ni deficient electrons and Cr enriched electrons. This can explain the easy reduction of Cr-Ni/Al samples. As can be inferred from the results of TPR, UV–vis and XPS, the considerably improved activity of Cr-Ni/Al catalysts should be attributed to the synergistic effect between Ni species and Cr species that the addition of Ni species promotes the formation of oligomeric chromium species and more active Cr3+ species.
4. Conclusions
The nickel modified Cr/Al catalysts exhibited much better catalytic activity for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The activity of 2.5Cr-Ni/Al catalyst has the most significant improvement with a propane conversion of about 47%, which is about 24% higher than that for 2.5Cr/Al catalyst. The enhanced catalytic activity of Cr-Ni/Al catalysts is attributed to the interaction between nickel and chromium. The H2-TPR, UV–vis, and XPS characterizations show that the addition of nickel not only leads to the formation of oligomeric chromium species, but also decreases the Cr6+ content resulting in the forming of Cr3+active sites. These would have important influences on the dehydrogenation activity. The synergistic effects between nickel and chromium for Cr-Ni/Al catalysts greatly facilitate the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
