Activation of small molecules over praseodymium-doped ceria

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872206719633693

AbstractABSTRACT
Praseodymium can modify the properties of ceria (CeO2), changing the electronic structure, reducibility and catalytic behavior. Oxygen vacancies in the ceria-based samples can activate C–O and C–H bonds of small molecules such as CO2 and propane. Partially reduced Pr/CeO2-x can selectively activate C–H of propane, giving a propylene selectivity of ca. 75% at a propane conversion of 5% to 10%. Excess reduction of Pr/CeO2-x induces coking reactions during propane dehydrogenation, resulting in fast catalyst deactivation.

1. Introduction
Al2O3 and ZrO2 are widely applied as catalyst supports and binders in petrochemical industries. Non-reducible Al2O3 is often regarded as an inert support or binder, but the high temperature treatment of Al2O3 can generate activity for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene [1]. The active sites on Al2O3 are attributed to the lattice defects created by removal of surface hydroxyl groups during high temperature treatment [1]. Bulk ZrO2-based materials with lattice defects have been identified as active catalysts for propane dehydrogenation [2]. The activity of ZrO2 can be improved by metal doping (such as La2O3-doped ZrO2) to increase the reducibility of ZrO2 and oxygen vacancies [3]. It is proposed that zirconium cations located near oxygen vacancies are catalytically active sites for the propane dehydrogenation [2,3]. It is desirable to know if the oxygen vacancies on reducible ceria-based materials could be active for the activation of C–H and C–C bonds of light alkanes like non-reducible Al2O3 and ZrO2 abovementioned.
CeO2 is a reducible oxide that is widely applied as a support or promoter in catalytic materials because of its unique redox properties [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. When used as a support, CeO2 is able to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form, enhancing the Pt dispersion and inhibiting Pt sintering in catalysts for the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation [11,12]. As a promoter (< 1 wt%), CeO2 can tune the propane dehydrogenation performance and improve the stability of PtSn/Al2O3 [13]. In many cases, CeO2 in combination with noble metals leads to superior catalytic performance. Knowledge on the role of CeO2 itself (without loading conventional hydrogenation/dehydrogenation metals) in C–H and C–C bond activation of light alkanes is still limited.
Doping with metals of lower valence states is an effective way to induce the formation of oxygen vacancies in CeO2. Extensive studies have focused on 3d transition metal (Ni2+, Co2+, Cr3+, etc.)-doped CeO2 [14, 15, 16]. However, it is suggested that transition metal ions do not incorporate into the oxide lattices but instead phase segregate into transition metal oxide nanoparticles [17]. Such problems could be overcome in rare earth metal-doped CeO2, in which the rare earth ions can achieve full dissolution into the CeO2 lattice. Among the various rare earth elements used as dopants for ceria catalysts, praseodymium has received a significant interest over the last few years [18, 19, 20, 21]. Pr species embedded into the ceria lattice promote the formation of oxygen vacancies and the mobility of negatively charged ions in the solid framework [18]. Moreover, our recent studies have shown that the oxygen vacancies induced by the Pr doping of CeO2 promotes the catalytic performance of the Prins condensation-hydrolysis of isobutene with formalin [22,23].
The aim of this work is to investigate the structures of defects, the reducibility of Pr-doped CeO2, and its capability for the activation of small molecules (CO2 and propane) in the absence of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation metals (e.g. Pt or CrOx etc.). Pr/CeO2 was prepared by a co-precipitation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis absorption spectrophotometry, and Raman spectrometry. The reducibility of Pr/CeO2 was investigated by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) in hydrogen. The degree of reduction was further characterized by titration using CO2 as a probe molecule by the temperature-programmed surface reaction (CO2-TPSR). CO2 reduction with hydrogen (H2 & CO2-TPSR) was used as a probe reaction to investigate the influence of the degree of reduction on the catalytic performance. Finally, propane dehydrogenation was used as a model reaction to evaluate C–H and C–C activation by the oxygen vacancies. This work will help understand the inherent catalytic properties of ceria-based materials and explore the potential of oxygen vacancies in metal oxide catalysts for light hydrocarbon conversion.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Pr-doped CeO2 catalyst with a Ce/Pr molar ratio of 4:1 was prepared by a co-precipitation method [22]. 4 g of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and 1 g of Pr(NO3)3·6H2O were dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water. The ammonium hydroxide solution was added drop-wise to the solution whilst stirring to maintain a pH of 11 and the solution was subsequently stirred for 2 h. The mixture was filtered and dried at 120 °C for 12 h, and the recovered solid calcined at 550 °C under a flow of air (50 mL min−1) for 4 h to obtain the final material. For comparison a CeO2 sample was also prepared without adding the Pr dopant.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
XRD patterns were collected on a PANalytical X’Pert powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation, operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V650 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were carried out on a Netzsch TG-DTA apparatus (Netzsch, Germany). About 10 mg sample was placed in an Al2O3 crucible and heated at a ramping rate of 10 °C min–1 under an air flow of 20 mL min–1.
Visible Raman spectra were collected on the Renishaw micro-Raman spectrometer equipped with a CCD detector using the laser wavelengths of 785 and 532 nm. UV Raman spectra were collected using a home-built spectrometer with a laser wavelength of 325 nm (Kimmon Co). All spectra were calibrated by placing the main Raman peak of monocrystalline Si at 520 cm–1. For most experiments, the laser power at the sample was kept below 1 mW to prevent burning effects.
For operando UV Raman experiments, a 30 mg catalyst sample was loaded in an in-situ cell and purged with helium at 400 °C for 30 min. Subsequently the feed gas (2 vol% H2) was introduced with a flow rate of 25 mL min–1 at 400 °C and then ramped to the desired temperature under the flow of hydrogen. The catalyst sample was characterized on-line with the UV Raman spectrometer while the effluent was on-line analyzed using a Pfeiffer quadrupole mass spectrometer to monitor the profile of hydrogen and water as a function of time and temperature.
H2-TPR experiments were performed with a Quantachrome autosorb iQ. First, 50 mg sample was loaded in a U-shaped quartz reactor and purged with helium to remove the adsorbed species at 500 °C for 30 min with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. After cooling to 40 °C, the purge gas was switched to a feed of 3 vol% H2 in helium with a flow rate of 30 mL min–1. The H2 -TPR experiment was carried out with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 up to the desired temperature. The effluent was monitored with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Pfeiffer quadrupole mass spectrometer. The amount of hydrogen consumed per catalyst mass was calculated according to the TCD signals. The integrated area translated to the amount of hydrogen consumption using calibrated curves of the hydrogen amount to the peak area.
The procedure for TPSR was similar to the H2-TPR but used the feeds described in Table 1. The following mass to charge (m/z) signals were monitored: 44 (CO2), 40 (Ar), 32 (O2), 28 (CO), 18 (water), 4 (He), 2 (H2).

2.3. Propane dehydrogenation test
Propane dehydrogenation tests were carried out in a tubular quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 10 mm at 570 °C and atmospheric pressure. 200 mg of catalyst (40–60 mesh) was diluted with 250 mg of quartz sand. Prior to catalytic performance tests, the as-synthesized samples were pretreated with Ar at 550 °C for 1 h or 5 vol% H2/Ar at 550 (650) °C for 1 h, corresponding to the propane performance testing over Pr/CeO2 or the pre-reduced Pr/CeO2-x at 550 (650) °C, respectively. Then propane feed (4 vol% propane, 2 vol% N2 in He) was introduced through the catalyst bed at a total flow rate of 40 mL min–1. The effluent was analyzed on-line using an Agilent MicroGC 490. Nitrogen was used as an internal standard for the performance calculations. Hydrogen, nitrogen, methane, and CO were analyzed with a molecular sieve column and TCD. CO2, ethylene, and ethane were analyzed using a PoraPLOT U column and TCD. Propane and propylene were analyzed with an aluminum oxide column and TCD. The partial pressures of the unconverted feed and products were directly determined using calibrated micro-GC. The flow rates of the unconverted feed and collected products were calculated based on the internal standard, nitrogen. The conversion of propane was determined as the amount of reacted propane divided by the amount of propane at the reactor inlet. The carbon selectivity of each compound was calculated as the quantity of the product formed divided by the amount of converted propane. The fitted hydrogen was calculated according to the below two equations:
Partial pressure of fitted H2 = 4/3 × Partial pressure of CO + Partial pressure of propylene
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterizations (XRD, UV-Vis Absorption spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy)
Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of as-synthesized CeO2 and Pr/CeO2. The observed peaks in the XRD patterns are well indexed and consistent with the reference data of CeO2, which indicates the single phase cubic fluorite structure. The optical properties of CeO2 and Pr/CeO2 were characterized by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy shown in Fig. 1b. The spectrum of CeO2 shows a strong absorption band below 400 nm, which originates from the O2– to Ce3+/4+ charge transfer transition [24]. Pr/CeO2 shows a high intensity visible light absorption in 400–650 nm, which has been assigned to the charge transfer transition from O2– to Pr3+/4+ [24, 25, 26, 27].

Raman spectroscopy is a useful technique in the characterization of defects of the oxide samples. The defects of CeO2 were studied by Raman spectroscopy using 785, 532, and 325 nm excitation laser lines (Fig. 2a). The spectra excited with the 785 and 532 nm laser lines both have a single band at 460 cm–1. The spectrum excited with the 325 nm laser line shows a band at 460 cm–1 and another band centered at 590 cm–1. The band at 590 cm–1 can be explained by a resonance Raman effect, since CeO2 strongly absorbs in the UV region around 325 nm as shown in Fig 1b [28].

Fig. 2. Raman spectra of CeO2 excited with 785, 532, and 325 nm laser lines (a) and operando UV Raman spectra of CeO2 (b).
The bands at 460 and 590 cm–1 are related to the Raman-active vibrational mode (F2g) of fluorite-type structure and the defects of CeO2, respectively [27,29]. The F2g band is the symmetrical stretching vibration of the oxygen atoms around cerium ions. The defect species characterized by the band at 590 cm–1 was observed under ambient conditions and its concentration may be low as it cannot be observed without the resonance enhancement effect.
To validate the structure of the defect characterized by the band at 590 cm–1, CeO2 was studied by operando UV Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 2b). Compared to the spectrum obtained under ambient condition shown in Fig 2a, there are no changes of the band at 590 cm–1 after helium and hydrogen treatments at 400 °C. This band shifts to 570 cm–1 upon the hydrogen treatment at elevated temperature such as 550 and 650 °C shown in Fig. 2b. The shift of band occurs upon on-line hydrogen treatment and should be related to the oxygen vacancy produced by the hydrogen treatment [30]. The consumption of the hydrogen and formation of water were observed by an on-line mass spectrometer during the operando Raman test in Fig. S1, confirming the formation of oxygen vacancies induced by the hydrogen reduction of CeO2.
The Pr/CeO2 shows the different optical properties with strong absorbance in the visible region as shown in Fig. 1b. The impact of the Pr dopant on the structure and amount of the defects was investigated by Raman spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 3a. The spectrum of Pr/CeO2 excited with 785 nm laser line shows a vibrational band of fluorite-type structure at 455 cm–1 and a weak peak centered at 570 cm–1. The spectrum collected with 532 nm excitation laser line is different to the spectrum collected with 785 nm excitation laser line. The peak area ratios of the bands at 570 and 455 cm–1 are 0.2 and 3.3 for the spectra collected with the excitation laser lines of 785 and 532 nm, respectively. This difference can be explained by a resonance Raman effect, since Pr/CeO2 strongly absorbs in the visible region around 532 nm as marked in Fig 1b. Compared with the visible Raman results, the 325 nm excited UV Raman shows a band centered at 590 cm–1 rather than 570 cm–1 and the peak area ratio of the bands at 590 and 460 cm–1 is further increased to 6.7.

For Pr/CeO2, the band around 570–590 cm–1 might be related to the intrinsic defects of CeO2 (590 cm–1), the Pr3+ induced oxygen vacancy (570 cm–1) and the vibration of the Pr–O species around 550 cm–1 [31]. Due to complexities of the band and the resonance Raman effect (resulting in different peak area ratios between the band at 570–590 and 455 cm–1 for different laser lines), the amount of the defects cannot be directly calculated by Raman results. However, the shift of the band of fluorite-type structure from 460 to 455 cm–1 confirms that the Pr dopant changes the local structure of the sample as shown in Fig. S2.
To validate the structure and the evolution of defects in Pr/CeO2, an operando UV Raman test was performed and the results are shown in Fig. 3b. The band at 590 cm–1 shifts to 570 cm–1 upon hydrogen treatment at elevated temperature such as 550 and 650 °C. Combined with the on-line mass spectrometer results, this suggests that the Raman band shift is related to the formation of oxygen vacancies induced by hydrogen treatment. This band shift is similar to the above CeO2 test results shown in Fig. 2b.
3.2. Temperature programmed reactions (H2-TPR, CO2-TPSR, and H2 & CO2-TPSR)
The reducibility of CeO2 and Pr/CeO2 was investigated by temperature-programmed reactions. The H2-TPR profiles of the CeO2 and Pr/CeO2 samples are shown in Fig. 4a and 4b, respectively, and the characteristic data derived from these profiles are listed in Table 2. For CeO2, two reduction zones were observed. The low-temperature region (350–630 °C) corresponds to surface reduction while the high-temperature region (>630 °C) is assigned to bulk reduction in agreement with previous publications [8,32]. The hydrogen consumption of CeO2 drops to zero at 630 °C, suggesting that this temperature is the boundary temperature for the surface and bulk reduction under the testing condition. The surface reduction of CeO2 can be well deconvoluted into the peaks of α and β with the peak area ratio of 1:1. The surface and overall hydrogen consumptions of CeO2 are 0.28 and 0.38 mmol g–1, respectively. The overall hydrogen consumption amount is similar to the previously reported result of 0.34 mmol g–1 [33].

Pr/CeO2 0.27 0.1 0.13 0.19 0.69 0.118
The respective surface and overall hydrogen consumptions of Pr/CeO2 are 0.5 and 0.69 mmol g–1 as listed in Table 2. The Pr dopant not only increases the amount of hydrogen consumption but also tunes the material’s reduction characteristics: (i) the peak area ratio of α and β increases from 1 to 2.7; (ii) a new type of surface reduction peak γ is formed; (iii) surface and bulk oxygen reduction cannot be distinguished clearly. The Pr-doped material still consumes hydrogen at 630 °C, which is different to the CeO2.
H2-TPR was also monitored using a mass spectrometer, allowing the observation of hydrogen consumption and water formation. For Pr/CeO2 in Fig. 5a, the hydrogen starts decreasing as the temperature reaches ca. 350 °C while the water signal is observed at the same time. Maxima in the amount of hydrogen consumed are centered at 480 and 570 °C, coinciding with maxima in the amount of water produced. The mass spectra confirm that Pr/CeO2 is reduced by H2 producing water. After H2 reduction, Pr/CeO2 is in its reduced state, i.e. Pr/CeO2-x, where x indicates the amount of oxygen vacancies and its value is listed in Table 2.

Fig. 5. H2-TPR profiles of Pr/CeO2 (mass spectrometer signal) (a) and CO2-TPSR over the pre-reduced Pr/CeO2-x as a function of pre-reduction temperature (b).
CO2 was used as a probe molecule to titrate the degree of reduction generated by the hydrogen treatment as a function of temperature. Before CO2-TPSR, the as-synthesized Pr/CeO2 was pre-reduced in a flow of hydrogen at 450, 550, 650 or 700 °C for 30 min. Then CO2-TPSR was carried out in a flow of CO2 from 300 to 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. As shown in Fig. 5b, over the Pr/CeO2-x pre-reduced at 700 °C, the CO2 signal starts decreasing as the temperature reaches 400 °C and CO production is observed at the same time. This result suggests that CO2 can dissociate on oxygen vacancies releasing CO, while the catalyst reverts from a reduced state to the initial oxidized state. The amount of CO relates to the degree of reduction and is lower with lower hydrogen pre-reduction temperatures. It is interesting to note that the pre-reduced sample at 450 °C shows little activity for the CO2 reduction.
CO2 reduction with hydrogen (H2 & CO2-TPSR) was used as a probe reaction to validate the influence of the degree of reduction on the reaction performance. As shown in Fig. 6a, the initial surface reduction of Pr/CeO2 in a H2 & CO2-TPSR experiment is quite similar to that observed in the H2-TPR experiment (Fig. 4b). Both show a starting reduction temperature around 350 °C and a peak of hydrogen consumption around 480 °C. In addition, there is no CO2 consumption and CO formation below 480 °C. This indicates that oxygen vacancies are generated at an early stage, corresponding to a low degree of reduction, and do not interact with CO2 at all. This result is similar to that observed in the CO2-TPSR experiment for the material pre-reduced at 450 °C in Fig. 5c. It is interesting to observe that CO2 consumption occurs between 480 and 520 °C but without CO generation. It seems that oxygen vacancies are generated in this stage, corresponding to low-level degree of reduction, interact with CO2 but are unable to decompose CO2 into CO. Further consumption of both H2 and CO2 was observed above 520 °C along with the formation of water and CO. Obviously, oxygen vacancies generated at this stage, corresponding to a higher degree of reduction of Pr/CeO2, can convert CO2 into CO.

Fig. 6. H2 & CO2 co-feed experiments for Pr/CeO2 (a), 600 °C hydrogen pre-reduced Pr/CeO2-x (b), and CeO2 (c).
The CO2 reduction to CO shown in Fig. 6a happens at 520 °C, much higher than the 400 °C in the CO2-TPSR over pre-reduced Pr/CeO2-x (Fig. 5c). To address this, a H2 & CO2-TPSR experiment was performed over the hydrogen pre-reduced Pr/CeO2-x and the result is shown in Fig. 6b. As expected, CO2 was converted to CO over Pr/CeO2-x starting at 400 °C instead of 520 °C, indicating that the activity of oxygen vacancies generated relates to the material’s degree of reduction. As shown in Fig. 6c and Fig. S3, the profiles of CeO2 are similar to that of Pr/CeO2, and the difference is the lower amount of water in the region of 350–520 °C, in agreement with the H2-TPR results in Fig. 4.
As discussed above, H2 & CO2-TPSR results suggest that the ceria catalyst is reduced by H2 generating oxygen vacancies. Subsequently CO2 can be dissociated on the oxygen vacancies releasing CO, while the catalyst changes back from the reduced state to the initial oxidized state. The catalyst cycle between the oxidized and reduced state initiates the CO2 reduction with hydrogen so that the overall reaction is reverse water gas shift.
3.3. Catalytic performance (propane dehydrogenation)
Propane activation reaction was used as a model reaction to investigate the influence of the degree of reduction and Pr dopant on the catalytic performance. This reaction was explored at a constant temperature of 570 °C. The performance results of Pr/CeO2 are summarized in Fig. 7 and Table 3. The sum of products carbon selectivities is the carbon molar ratio between the collected products and converted propane and its decrease indicates an obvious carbon loss in the later stage of the reaction, which should be in the form of coking. TGA and TPO analysis of the used catalyst confirms a carbon deposit about 3 wt% of the catalyst weight in Fig. S4. The reaction process can be divided into a relative stable stage and a fast coking stage. As shown in Fig. 7 and Table 3, the stable stage exhibits the following trends: (i) the initial activity is low and the activity gradually increases with time on stream (TOS); (ii) propylene is the main product and its selectivity increases quickly with time and then stabilizes at ca. 75%; (iii) CO selectivity increases first and then stabilizes at ca. 15%; (iv) CO2 is only detected at the initial time on steam. The formation of CO and CO2 implies that Pr/CeO2 is reduced by propane in the early stage of the reaction. The material’s degree of reduction keeps increasing, corresponding to more oxygen vacancies on the catalyst. The oxygen vacancies seem selective for the activation of the C–H rather than C–C bonds of propane, giving much higher propylene and lower ethylene yields. The product distribution suggests that the major reactions over Pr/CeO2 are catalyst reduction and dehydrogenation of propane presented by the following equations:

Concentrations of the ethane (entries 1–6) and CO2 (entry 6–9) were below the GC limit of detection.
The hydrogen partial pressure was fitted based on the CO and propylene partial pressure using the two equations above. The collected hydrogen and fitted hydrogen are in good agreement for the relative stable performance stage shown in Fig. 7c.
The fast coking stage exhibits the following trends: (i) the conversion of propane does not start to drop until significant carbon deposits have built up; (ii) side reaction C3H8 → 3C (coke) + 4H2 occurs in the coking stage, which is confirmed by the carbon loss along with the big difference between the collected and fitted hydrogen partial pressure, which indicates the boundary of relative stable stage and fast coking stage; (iii) propylene selectivity is still around 50%.
The degree of reduction and activity of the oxygen vacancies of Pr/CeO2 can be tuned by the hydrogen reduction temperature as shown in Fig. 5b. The sample pre-reduced by hydrogen at 650 °C has higher degree of reduction than the sample pre-reduction by hydrogen at 550 °C. The performance data of the Pr/CeO2-x formed by pre-reduction in hydrogen at 550 and 650 °C are given in Fig. 8 with the reference of Pr/CeO2. The Pr/CeO2-x produced by pre-reduced in hydrogen at 650 °C exhibits higher initial activity and propylene selectivity. This result is in agreement with the activity observed in the CO2 reduction experiments (Fig. 5b) and further confirms that the oxygen vacancies have the ability to activate the C–H bonds of propane producing propylene as shown in Fig. 8a and 8b. The CO2 formation by full oxidation of propane is greatly or fully eliminated for Pr/CeO2-x formed by pre-reduction by hydrogen at 550 and 650 °C as shown in Fig. 8c. The CO formation is also obviously lower for the hydrogen pre-reduced samples as shown in Fig. 8d.

The performance of propane conversion over CeO2 is summarized in Fig. S5 and Table S1. The performance profiles over CeO2 are similar to that of Pr/CeO2, but the selectivities for partial oxidation product CO, selective dehydrogenation product propylene, and the coke formation are different, as shown in Fig. 9. The typical performance data of CeO2 and Pr/CeO2 are compared at similar propane conversions (Fig. 9a), aiming to investigate the impact of the Pr dopant on the product selectivities. For the relatively stable performance stage (entries 1–5), Pr/CeO2 gives higher selectivity to propylene, lower selectivity to CO, and lower selectivity to coke as shown in Fig. 9b, 9c and 9d, respectively. For the fast coking stage (entries 6–8), the product selectivities of the two samples are similar, exhibiting much higher coke selectivity around 27%–31% due to the side reaction of C3H8 → 3C (coke) + 4H2.

Fig. 9. Conversion (a), propylene selectivity (b), CO selectivity (c), and coke selectivity (d) for CeO2 and Pr/CeO2. Coke selectivity is estimated from the carbon loss calculated by the sum of products detected by GC. The negative coke selectivity is due to the precision of the GC quantification (1% error bar).
Based on the above results, the oxygen vacancies seem responsible for the selective activation of the C–H bonds of propane resulting in propylene formation. During the early stable performance stage the activity is proportional to the amount of oxygen vacancies. Increases in the amount of oxygen vacancies (high degree of reduction) induce side reactions like the decomposition of propane to coke (carbon deposits) and hydrogen. The carbon deposition causes the deactivation of the catalyst. The Pr dopant suppresses the formation of byproducts of CO and coke in the initial stable stage, giving higher propylene selectivity. The propane conversion over a non-metal loaded Pr/CeO2 catalyst is very appealing with a 75% selectivity to propylene at a propane conversion around 5%–10%. More work is under way to understand and stabilize the oxygen vacancies over Pr/CeO2.
4. Conclusions
In this study, the defects of CeO2 and Pr/CeO2 are investigated by Raman spectroscopy with different excitation laser lines and an operando UV Raman technique, providing information of the structure and amount of defects, and their evolution at elevated temperatures under the flows of He and H2. The reducibility of Pr/CeO2 is investigated by the reactions of hydrogen. The oxygen vacancies of the reduced PrCeO2-x have the ability to activate the C–O bond of CO2 (CO as the product) and C–H bonds of propane (propylene as the product). The activity and product selectivity relate to its degree of reduction. Pr dopant not only changes the optical properties, the amount and type of defects, and reducibility characteristics, but also changes the selectivities of the propane activation reaction suppressing the formation of byproducts CO and coke and producing higher propylene selectivity. The degree of reduction of the ceria sample is an important descriptor of the catalytic performance.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
