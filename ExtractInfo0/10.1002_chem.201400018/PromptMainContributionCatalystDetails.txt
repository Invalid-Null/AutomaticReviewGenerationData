Hybrid Nanocarbon as a Catalyst for Direct Dehydrogenation of Propane: Formation of an Active and Selective Core–Shell sp2/sp3 Nanocomposite Structure
Graphical Abstract
Essential imperfections: The evolution of the surface state and catalytic performance of hybrid nanocarbon produced by high-temperature annealing of nanodiamond was investigated. The core–shell sp2/sp3 composite, comprised of a diamond core and a defective, curved graphene shell, exhibits superior catalytic activity that depends strongly on the high concentration of structural defects and high chemical reactivity of ketone-type groups (see figure).
Abstract
Hybrid nanocarbon, comprised of a diamond core and a graphitic shell with a variable sp2-/sp3-carbon ratio, is controllably obtained through sequential annealing treatment (550–1300 °C) of nanodiamond. The formation of sp2 carbon increases with annealing temperature and the nanodiamond surface is reconstructed from amorphous into a well-ordered, onion-like carbon structure via an intermediate composite structure—a diamond core covered by a defective, curved graphene outer shell. Direct dehydrogenation of propane shows that the sp2-/sp3-nanocomposite exhibits superior catalytic performance to that of individual nanodiamond and graphitic nanocarbon. The optimum catalytic activity of the diamond/graphene composite depends on the maximum structural defectiveness and high chemical reactivity of the ketone groups. Ketone-type functional groups anchored on the defects/vacancies are active for propene formation; nevertheless, once the oxygen functional groups are desorbed, the defects/vacancies alone might be active sites responsible for the CH bond activation of propane.
Introduction
Carbon-based nanomaterials have been an area of great academic and commercial interest in view of their environmental acceptability, corrosion resistance, and unique surface properties. Many sp2-hybridized nanocarbons, including carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, graphene sheets,1 and graphene oxides,2 provide great potential as metal-free catalysts in various catalytic process, involving either oxidation or reduction reactions. Likewise, sp3-hybridized nanodiamonds (NDs) are promising candidates as metal-free catalysts,3 electrode materials,4 or labeling and medical drugs5 for chemical and biological applications. Indeed, NDs combine the intrinsic properties of nanomaterials, including nanoscale sizes (≈5–8 nm, detonation ND) and a high surface-to-volume ratio,6 with unique diamond properties, such as excellent mechanical and optical properties associated with a tunable surface structure.7
In particular, remarkable chemical8 and catalytic properties3 of NDs have recently been attributed to the presence of sp2-carbon “impurity”. Holt et al. reported that ND powders as electrode materials enhanced the electrochemical activity of solution redox species (e.g., [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−), which was attributed to unsaturated sp2 bonding at the ND particle surface, leading to an increased density of surface states.8a, 9 We reported that ND powder as a catalyst exhibited superior catalytic activity and stability for direct dehydrogenation (DH) of ethylbenzene compared with commercial iron oxide and other carbons.3 The bent, graphene-like surface is mostly saturated with CO functionalities, which contribute to the high activity. Liu et al. found that oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane could induce lattice rearrangement of the ND from cubic sp3-hybidized to sp2-hybridized fullerene shells, which gave a carbon surface that was highly selective in the ODH reaction.10 As a consequence, it has been theoretically predicted that the combination of NDs with sp2-hybridized nanocarbons that are covalently bonded may show synergistic effects. The hybrid structure, which consists of diamond blocks interconnected by layers of graphitic carbon, possesses exceptional properties of the individual components. Structural defects and surface oxygen functionalities might be tunable by altering the hybridization state of carbon. Therefore, a detailed and deep understanding is needed to investigate the evolution of the surface state of the sp3–sp2 nanocomposite and its impact on catalytic performance by modulating the relative ratio of sp2 and sp3 carbon.
Herein, we varied and controlled systematically the microstructure and surface chemistry of ND through annealing treatments in an inert atmosphere. The resulting core–shell sp2/sp3 nanocomposites were structurally characterized and tested for their catalytic activity in the DH of propane. The combination of surface state and catalytic performance can further reveal the catalytic role of the tunable core–shell interface for the observed dehydrogenation activity.
Results and Discussion
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveals the structural transformation of pristine ND annealed in an inert atmosphere in the temperature range from 550 to 1300 °C. The image of pristine ND, in which individual diamond particles of 3–10 nm can be distinguished within the aggregates, is shown in Figure 1 a. The core of each particle consists of a well-defined crystalline diamond with (111) planes covered by an outer shell of unstructured amorphous carbon. When ND is annealed at 800 °C (Figure 1 b), a similar morphology and particle size is observed in the HRTEM images and the carbon structure of the outer shell still appears to be disordered. When annealed at 1000 °C (Figure 1 c), partially transformed ND is found, in which the particles remain in a diamond core and exhibit a distorted graphitic structure in the outer shell with one or two curved graphene layers. With increasing annealing temperature, the particles gradually become more highly ordered. At 1300 °C, the curved graphene layers increase and enclose to form highly ordered spherical onion-like carbon (OLC), but still contain a diamond central core with distances between neighboring shells close to 3.5 Å. (Figure 1 d). This observation supports previous conclusions that the graphitization of the ND shell can normally be initiated in an inert atmosphere at a high temperature (>900 °C) and begins at the surface and moves towards the core of the ND particle.11 This phenomenon of graphitization transformation is further supported by results of the EELS spectra (Figure 1 e and Table 1). The main peaks above 290 eV in the EELS spectrum of pristine ND are assigned to characteristic 1 s→σ* transitions of sp3-bonded crystalline diamond; a weak shoulder at 285 eV (1 s→π* transition) indicates the presence of disordered sp2 carbon.12 With increasing annealing temperature, a gradual increase in 1 s→π* intensity and a decrease in 1 s→σ* intensity are observed, which suggests the conversion from sp3 to sp2 carbon. Compared with highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG; Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), the fraction of sp2 carbon estimated from EELS shown in Table 1 was about 27 %; this indicated that the mixed sp2/sp3 bonding of carbon atoms were located in the amorphous core–shell interface, even after oxidizing acid purification.13 In the initial annealing stage (≤800 °C), the fraction of sp2 carbon remained similar. Above 800 °C, the fraction of sp2 carbon increased significantly up to 71 % with increasing annealing temperature, corresponding to the development of sp2/sp3 nanocomposites.

The XRD pattern of pristine ND (Figure S2a in the Supporting Information) shows only prominent peaks at 43.9, 75.4, and 91.8°, which correspond to the normal diamond structure for the (111), (220), and (311) reflections, respectively. After annealing at or below 800 °C, no significant changes were observed in NDs. At 1000 °C, a very broad graphite (002) peak began to appear at 25.2°, which was indicative of the presence of stacked graphene layers. With annealing temperature increasing to 1300 °C, the graphite (002) peak became more apparent, while the peaks of the diamond phase gradually weakened, but the diamond features did not fully disappear and remained at low intensity. The residual diamond peaks are broadened because the particle size is effectively reduced by the conversion of the outer layer to a spherical shell with graphitic features. This transition corresponds to the development of the graphitic layers observed in the HRTEM images; the sp2/sp3 nanocomposite with a diamond core and curved graphitic shell can be formed above 800 °C. N2 physisorption data in Table 1 show that the BET surface area and pore volume increased slightly with increasing temperature. The unchanged pore size distributions further confirm that the integrity of the framework of ND-derived samples is not affected by the annealing treatment.
UV–Raman spectroscopy is highly sensitive to different types of carbon bonding at the surface of the ND (Figure 2 a). The initial spectrum shows a broadened sharp diamond peak at 1324 cm−1 and a broad peak with a maximum at about 1635 cm−1. This broad peak at 1635 cm−1could be assigned to the superposition of the G band at 1590 cm−1 and OH bending vibrations at 1640 cm−1.14 CO stretching vibrations are positioned at 1740 cm−1 and may appear as a shoulder to this broad peak. After annealing at or above 800 °C, the diamond peak is rapidly weakened with temperature and overlapped with a new broad peak at approximately 1400 cm−1 assigned to the disorder-induced D band. The shift of a broad peak from 1635 cm−1 to approximately 1580 cm−1 indicates the reorganization of amorphous carbon into sp2-bonded carbon, which can be interpreted as well-ordered nanocrystalline graphite.13 The fraction of sp2 carbon at the surface estimated from Raman spectra increased from 32 to 88 % after stepwise annealing treatment (Table 2). Consistent with the above characterization data, these observations reveal that the amount of amorphous carbon with mixed sp2/sp3 bonding in the outer shell decreases after annealing, and reconstructs into dominant sp2 bonding, which exists in the carbon onion shells. The first-order Raman spectra of pristine and ND-derived samples were fitted by following the procedure reported by Gogotsi et al.14 The intensity ratio of ID/IG is normally used to qualitatively estimate the defect degree of sp2-bonded carbon materials. The fit for ND-1100 is shown in Figure 2 b as an example. During elevated annealing, the ID/IG ratio increased and then decreased with a maximum ID/IG value for the ND-1100 sample (Table 2). This suggests that, in the early graphitization stage, the defect degree increases with increasing fraction of sp2 carbon, and the maximum defectiveness is obtained on the interface of the sp2/sp3 composite composed of a diamond core with a thin, defective, curved graphene outer shell with a certain ratio of mixed carbon; however, the further formation of a well-ordered OLC shell causes a significant decrease in structural defects.

Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy was performed to provide evidence of the change in the surface oxygen functional groups of ND during annealing (Figure 3). The main features in the spectrum of pristine ND are related to CO stretches (≈1788 cm−1) from carboxylic acid, anhydrides, lactones, or cyclic ketones, and C-O-C stretches (1046–1328 cm−1) of cyclic ethers or esters.15 After annealing, the CO vibrations reduced in intensity and downshifted significantly and the stretching modes of CO assigned to carbonyl ketones remained at 1728 cm−1, while the stretching mode of aromatic CC appeared at 1580 cm−1. This suggests that thermally unstable carboxylic or anhydride groups are removed after annealing, whereas stable ketone groups can exist selectively on reconstructed surface.

Three types of oxygen species are further identified semiquantitatively from the deconvoluted O1 s XPS spectrum of pristine ND, namely, ketonic/quinonic carbonyl oxygen (CO) at 530.3 eV(O1); carbonyl oxygen atoms in esters, amides, anhydrides, and oxygen atoms in hydroxyls or ethers at 532.4 eV(O2); and CO in esters and anhydrides at 533.1 eV (O3) (Figure 4 a and Table 2).16 The 60.7 % concentration of O2 species is indicative of the acidic carboxyl acid and anhydride groups, as predominant oxygen-containing groups, on the pristine ND surface (Figure 4 b). The total surface oxygen content decreased significantly from 9.7 to 0.7 % after annealing, among which the fraction of O1 species increased from 8.1 to 39.5 %, while the O2 fraction significantly decreased from 60.7 to 0 %. This reveals that a lower amount of oxygen-containing groups can be anchored on the sp2/sp3 interface with increasing degree of graphitization; most are basic ketonic/quinonic oxygen groups, in good agreement with DRIFT observations. Annealing at temperatures above 1100 K results in complete desorption of oxygen-containing groups;17 therefore, the presence of such basic oxygen groups on samples annealed above 800 °C can be explained by their exposure to air after annealing. At room temperature, ambient oxygen may react with the edges of incomplete graphene layers, where there are highly reactive dangling bonds; in contrast, the basal surfaces of graphite are relatively inert to oxygen at room temperature.17 Furthermore, it is reported that basic oxygen species are usually regenerated on a desorbed carbon surface after exposure to air at room temperature.18

Based on the above discussions, the evolution of the structure and surface chemistry of NDs during annealing is summarized herein. Disordered carbon with mixed sp2/sp3 bonding in the outer shell is reconstructed into well-ordered sp2-bonded graphitic carbon. The sp2-carbon formation on the core–shell interface increases with annealing temperature, which results in the selective formation of stable ketone-type groups, accompanied by the desorption of unstable carboxylic or anhydride groups to release to CO2, CO and H2O.
The catalytic performance of all ND-derived samples for propane dehydrogenation was evaluated at 550 °C (Figure 5 and Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). Pristine ND and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), as typical examples of sp3 and sp2 carbon, are also shown for comparison. A very low catalytic performance was observed on MWCNTs, with 1.4 % conversion and 50.6 % propene selectivity. Pristine ND displayed a 5.4 % steady-state conversion and 64.8 % propene selectivity after 8 h of reaction (Figure S3a in the Supporting Information). COx and C1–C2 hydrocarbon, including methane, ethane, and ethene, were also detected as byproducts. In the first 2 h, an increase in propene selectivity at the price of COx selectivity was observed, which was indicative of the effective inhibition of propane oxidation. After sequential annealing treatment in the range of 550–1100 °C (Figure 5 and Figure S3b in the Supporting Information), the catalytic performance increased with annealing temperature. The optimal catalytic performance of 10.6 % steady-state conversion and 90 % propene selectivity was observed for the ND-1100 sample; this was much higher than those of pristine ND and MWCNT. After annealing above 1100 °C, propane conversion decreased to 4.3 %, although the propene selectivity remained similar. Moreover, the COx production of samples rapidly decreased with annealing temperature in the initial 1 h until it was not detected (Table 3). This is attributed to the decreased relative concentration of acidic electrophilic oxygen species increasing annealing temperature, as observed by DRIFT and XPS.

After reaction, the negligible change in the XRD patterns of used samples (Figure S2b in the Supporting Information) indicates that the crystalline phase of annealed NDs cannot be influenced during the reaction. Raman spectra of used samples (Table 2 and Figure S4 in the Supporting Information) showed that, after annealing below 800 °C, the formation of sp2 carbon increased to double that before reaction, whereas only a slight increase was observed for samples annealed above 800 °C and was even unchanged at high temperatures. This means that the chemical adsorption and activation of hydrocarbon molecules on the ND surface during the DH reaction could favor carbon reconstruction at a relatively low temperature.10 Nevertheless, when the graphitic outer shell is further formed over the course of the transformation, carbon reconstruction towards the core is required at higher temperature to break CC bonds, because of the smaller numbers of defects and lower kinetic energy in the inner core than that on the outmost surface.11b It is shown in Table 2 that the surface oxygen content of samples annealed below 800 °C decreased significantly after the reaction, and then remained similar above 800 °C. DRIFT profiles of used samples (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information) showed that CO stretching bands all featured at 1726 cm−1; this was assigned to basic ketone-type groups. These observations further confirm that ketone-type groups could remain stable on a reconstructed carbon surface, accompanied by graphitization transformation of NDs.
The relationship between the surface ketone functional groups, the graphitization level of NDs, and their catalytic performances is given in Figure 6. The catalytic performance of NDs is inconsistently verified by the decrease in the content of ketonic carbonyl oxygen and increase in the fraction of sp2-bonded carbon. Interestingly, there is a good correlation between the degree of defectiveness of sp2 carbon on the surface and the catalytic performance. From the results shown in Table 3, propane consumption normalized by ketonic carbonyl oxygen (CO) presents a 2–2.85-fold increase after annealing above 800 °C. This means that the reactivity of ketone groups on the restructured graphitic surface is much higher than those initially found on an amorphous surface; hence, the reactivity of ketone oxygen functionalities on the carbon surface can be tunable by the chemical nature of defect/vacancy sites with different structural characteristics. The excellent catalytic performance can be achieved for the ND-1100 sample, wherein the sp2/sp3 nanocomposite is formed by a graphene shell and diamond core. Owing to its high structural defectiveness, the defective diamond–graphene interface acts an appropriate matrix for the formation of ketone-type functional groups with superior reactivity. For the ND-1300 sample, the well-ordered structure of the diamond–OLC composite decreases the defects that anchor traces of ketone-type groups and result in an inferior catalytic performance.

To further investigate the catalytic role of structural defects on the sp2/sp3 nanocomposite, cyclic DH tests followed by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) runs are performed over ND-1000 catalyst and the results are shown in Figure 7 a. A slight decrease in propane conversion was observed on the TPD-treated sample in the initial stage of the first DH test, which could be related to deactivation of active sites for propane combustion. The propene selectivity remained stable during the reaction. After 2 h of reaction, the catalytic activity reached a steady state with 12 % propane conversion and 92 % propene selectivity, which is even slightly higher than that of the original ND-1000 catalyst without TPD treatment. After consecutive TPD experiments, the propane conversion of the second run decreased slightly from 14 to 12 % in the first 1 h and then remained stable, whereas the propene selectivity stayed the same during the entire test. Almost identical propane conversion and propene selectivity in the second and third DH tests suggest an identical chemical nature of the surface after repeated TPD runs.

DH/TPD cycles of propane dehydrogenation for the ND-1000 sample: a) DH catalytic performance; b) CO2; and c) CO release profiles from TPD.
Periodic TPD profiles of the ND-1000 catalyst before and after the catalytic tests are shown in Figure 7 b and c. In the first TPD profiles, the large broad CO and CO2 desorption peaks were observed in the range of 200–800 and 200–950 °C, respectively, corresponding to removal of carboxyl anhydride, lactone, and ketone/quinone groups. This means that the oxygen-free surface is generated by removing all functionalities. Despite the similarity in the catalytic performance, a significant difference was observed between the first and second TPD profiles. From the second TPD profile, only a very weak CO peak was observed above 850 °C, which indicated that only traces of stable ketone/quinone groups remained on the surface. Moreover, the same, smaller CO desorption peaks in the second and third TPD runs suggested that traces of ketone/quinone groups with same chemical nature were generated during the cyclic catalytic tests; these were likely to originate from the adsorption of ppm traces of water in deoxidized helium on the carbon surface. Carlsson et al. reported that bare vacancies of graphene could be saturated by ether (COC) and carbonyl (CO) groups at a very low oxygen pressure by ab initio atomistic thermodynamics.19 The only difference between the original and TPD-treated ND-1000 samples was that the defects/vacancies at the surface of the original sample were covered by oxygen functionalities, whereas in the TPD-treated sample these oxygen functionalities were removed and most defects/vacancies remained uncovered. Hence, we have concluded that the observed catalytic activity originates mainly from bare defects/vacancies on the surface. Normally, ketone-type functional groups anchored on defects/vacancies are active sites for the activation of hydrocarbon molecules and the surface redox couple of CO and COH groups control the catalytic turnover. However, once these basic oxygen functional groups are desorbed, the bare defects/vacancies might be responsible for activation of the CH bond of hydrocarbon.
First-principles DFT calculations were performed to determine the reactivity of the defect sites. The four defect sites on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were calculated (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information) to mimic the active sites on the graphitic surface of the ND sample, including the armchair edge, the zigzag edge, and the monovacancy. The dissociation energy of the first CH bond breaking of propane was −3.03, −4.18, −4.59, and −1.48 eV, respectively. This indicates that the dissociation of the CH bond of propane is thermodynamically feasible on these uncovered defect sites, which have the potential to be the active sites for propane activation. Moreover, defect sites with different structural characteristics, such as edges or vacancies, could exhibit different reactivities. This assumption is also supported by propane dehydrogenation over perfect Ga2O3 (100) by periodic DFT calculations.20 Propane dehydrogenation mainly followed a DH mechanism. Gallium sites are less active than oxygen sites. Nevertheless, once surface oxygen sites are consumed, hydrogen abstraction from various propyl intermediates by gallium sites becomes the main pathway to form propene. In the present study, the active sites for propane dehydrogenation are likely to originate from defects/vacancies on the surface. Ketone-type functional groups attached on defects/vacancies are the main active sites for propene formation. However, once the surface oxygen groups are desorbed or consumed, the initial CH bond can be activated by uncovered defect sites on the surface, which then result in hydrogen abstraction from propyl intermediates to form propene, finally hydrogen desorption from the surface completes the catalytic cycle in the form of H2. However, this assumption of reaction pathways is only preliminary and the chemical nature of defect sites and intermediate species on defects in the DH reaction remain unclear. Further study is essential to better understand the reaction mechanism by identifying structural defects through the quantification technique and theoretical calculations.21
Conclusion
We investigated the evolution of surface states and the catalytic performance of sp2/sp3 nanocomposites produced by high-temperature annealing of NDs; this gave insights to explain and control its catalytic dehydrogenation activity. Below 800 °C, the original structure of ND particles was not altered and comprised of a diamond core covered by an amorphous carbon layer, which was terminated predominantly by electrophilic oxygen species, such as carboxylic acids and their anhydrides, and resulted in low catalytic activity. At the range of 800–1100 °C, the ND surface was reconstructed into a curved, distorted graphene outer shell. Such a diamond/graphene composite with mixed sp2/sp3 hybrid character may combine the intrinsic core properties of diamond with the surface reactivity of sp2-based nanocarbon, which acts as an appropriate matrix for the formation of ketone-type functional groups and exhibits superior catalytic activity. Above 1100 °C, the ND surface is fully transformed into the diamond/OLC composite, and the well-ordered OLC shell significantly decreases the concentration of structural defects, resulting in a sharp drop in catalytic activity. Hybrid nanocarbon as a catalyst shows a synergistic effect and exhibits superior catalytic activity to that of individual sp2 and sp3 carbon. Indeed, structural defects of the nanocomposite structure as catalytic sites could be responsible for the activation of propane by anchoring active ketone groups or alone; nevertheless, further study of the catalytic role of structural defects is needed.
Experimental Section
ND powders (high-purity grade) were bought from Beijing Grish Hitech, P.R. China, and were synthesized by the detonation explosive method followed by acid washing for purification. Annealing treatment of diamond nanoparticles (3–10 nm) was performed in a tube furnace in a flow of He (100 mL min−1) from 550 to 1300 °C for 4 h, and then cooled to room temperature in He. The ND powders were placed in a quartz boat and ramped to the annealing temperature at a rate of 5 °C min−1.
N2 physisorption was measured at −196 °C by using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 instrument. HRTEM and EELS were performed inside a Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope operating at 200 kV equipped with a Gatan imaging filter (GIF) system. The sample was ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol, and then a drop of the solution was deposited on a holey C/Cu TEM grid for HRTEM and EELS characterization. Low-dose electron beam imaging was used to prevent any beam damage of the sample and additional heating effects of the electron beam. The XPS experiments were performed by using an ESCALAB 250, Thermo VG, instrument with AlKα X-rays (1489.6 eV, 150 W, 50.0 eV pass energy). UV–Raman spectroscopy was performed on powder samples by using a Horiba LabRam HR Raman spectrometer. The excitation wavelength was 325 nm with a power of 0.2 mW. DRIFT experiments were performed on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet IS10 Fourier transform IR spectrometer equipped with a high-temperature/high-pressure chamber and an MCT detector. The resolution of the spectrometer was 4 cm−1 over 128 scans. Before measurement, the sample diluted with KBr was placed in the sample cup and preheated to the desired reaction temperature in a flow of He.
The propane DH catalytic tests were carried out in a quartz fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure. The sample (250 mg) was preheated to 550 °C in a flow of He, and then 2 % propane/He (15 mL min−1) was fed into reactor. The reaction products were analyzed by means of an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) for hydrocarbon and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for inorganic components. Cyclic catalytic DH tests and TPD experiments were carried out in a fix-bed reactor setup, the outlet of which was coupled with both an Ominstar mass spectrometer and Agilent 7890A GC for online quantitative and qualitative analysis. The whole experiment was performed as follows: First, the sample (250 mg) was flushed at room temperature with deoxidized He (50 mL min−1) for 2 h and TPD was performed with a heating ramp of 10 °C min−1, holding at maximum temperature of 950 °C for 30 min. After TPD, the reactant gases were input into the reactor and propane DH test was performed by following the above-mentioned reaction procedures with 2 % propane/He as the reactant (total flow 15 mL min−1). After15 h, the catalyst was flushed with He (50 mL min−1) and cooled to room temperature. Afterwards, TPD was performed in sequence. The catalytic DH test and TPD recycling turns were performed three times. He was deoxidized and the catalyst was never removed from the reactor or exposed to the air.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
