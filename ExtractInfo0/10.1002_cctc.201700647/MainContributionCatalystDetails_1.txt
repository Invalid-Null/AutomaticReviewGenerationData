The provided document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically. While it discusses a mesoporous cobalt aluminate catalyst for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, the focus appears to be on demonstrating a new class of earth-abundant transition metal catalysts rather than optimizing performance for industrial PDH or ODH processes. The document does not provide details on enhancements to selectivity, conversion or stability compared to existing PDH/ODH catalysts.
