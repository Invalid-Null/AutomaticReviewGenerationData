The given document does not appear to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on hydrocracking of heavy oils using bifunctional catalysts consisting of MoS2 and Zr-doped SiO2-Al2O3 mixed oxides. While it mentions catalyst characterization and performance for hydrocracking reactions, it does not discuss propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document does not contain information about propane conversion, propylene selectivity/yield, or any other metrics related to PDH or ODH. Since propane dehydrogenation is not the focus, I have indicated that the document is not relevant.
