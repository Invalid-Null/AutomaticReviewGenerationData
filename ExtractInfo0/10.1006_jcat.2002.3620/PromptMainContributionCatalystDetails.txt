The Relationship between the Electronic and Redox Properties of Dispersed Metal Oxides and Their Turnover Rates in Oxidative Dehydrogenation Reactions
Abstract
The mechanistic connections among propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) rates, H2 reduction rates, and the electronic transitions responsible for the absorption edge in the electronic spectra of dispersed metal oxides were explored for VOx, MoOx, WOx, and NbOx samples consisting predominately of two-dimensional oxide domains supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, and MgO. For a given active oxide, propane turnover rates increased in parallel with the reduction rate of the oxide catalyst using H2, but propane ODH rates differed significantly among different metal oxide samples with similar H2 reduction rates. For all catalysts, ODH turnover rates increased monotonically as the energy of the absorption edge in the UV–visible spectrum decreased. These results, taken together with the respective mechanisms for electron transfer during C–H bond activation and during the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer processes responsible for the UV–visible edge, suggest that the stability of activated complexes in C–H bond dissociation steps depends sensitively on the ability of the active oxide domains to transfer electrons from lattice oxygen atoms to metal centers. The electronic transitions responsible for the UV–visible absorption edge are mechanistically related to the redox cycles involving lattice oxygens responsible for oxidative dehydrogenation turnovers of alkanes. As a result, the details of near-edge electronic spectra provide useful guidance about intrinsic reaction rates on active oxides typically used for these reactions.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
