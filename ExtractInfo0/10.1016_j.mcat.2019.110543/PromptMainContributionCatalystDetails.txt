1. Introduction
Propene has been considered as an important material to produce acrylonitrile, propene oxide, cumin, acrylic acid, and polypropene in petrochemical industry [1,2]. The conventional propene production is by-product from catalytic cracking of heavy oil or from the steam naphtha cracking. The limited yield is hard to meet the market demand [3]. As the increasing production of shale gas containing considerable amounts of natural gas liquids, the price of propane has dropped markedly, which supplies abundant raw material for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) route. Compared to conventional production technology of propene, PDH route yields exclusively pure olefin rather than a mixture of products and increases the product yield of propene as well as decreases the cost of propene production [4].
Pt-based catalysts are widely applied in the commercial PDH technology. PDH is an endothermic reaction and achieves considerable yield only if the reaction is performed at least 600 °C, which can lead to serious coke deposition [5], sintering of active metal sites [6], and side reactions including hydrogenolysis, cracking, and isomerization [7]. Therefore, many efforts have been made to alleviate these problems. Besides the introduction of Sn and the preparation of alloys containing Pt [[8], [9], [10]], the great improvement has also been achieved by the modulation of support. In contrast to pure Al2O3 as a support for commercial Pt-Sn catalysts, some metal oxides were introduced to prepare the mixed metal oxide TiO2-Al2O3 [11], CeO2-Al2O3 [12], La-Ga2O3-Al2O3 [13], CeO2-Ga2O3-Al2O3 [14], to strengthen the Pt-support interaction, which can maintain the dispersity of Pt species and also modulate their electron density. Another strategy was directly regarding of CeO2 [15], ZrO2 [16], Ga2O3 [17], SAPO-40 [18], TS-1 [19], as support to replace Al2O3, for the purse of stabilizing the atomically Pt species at high temperature and reducing coke. Moreover, there are various side reactions during the dehydrogenation reaction mainly due to Brønsted acidity of Al2O3 support [20], which could decrease the selectivity. Pt-based catalysts supported on the less acidity of the spinel MgAl2O4 [21,22], ZnAl2O4 [23], Mg(Al)O hydrotalcites [[24], [25], [26]], Mg(Ga)(Al)O [[27], [28], [29]], Mg(In)(Al)O [30,31], could effectively suppress the side reaction, reduce coke deposition and stabilize active species. Furthermore, the surface properties significantly improve the interaction between active species and support. Pt anchored on coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ centers of the Al2O3 nanosheets exhibited strong metal-support interactions, remained high dispersion even under harsh conditions [[32], [33], [34]]. Besides the surface defect, the surface strong Lewis acid sites of Al2O3 promoted the C–H activation [35], as well as facilitate the adsorption and activation of alkane [35,36], resulting in a better catalytic performance. Al2O3 nanosheets could also stabilize Au nanoparticles at high temperature due to the strong interfacial interaction [37]. The layer double hydroxides containing Mg, Al, Sn of γ-Al2O3 could strongly interact with small raft-like the supported Pt clusters. As a consequence, the catalysts display good durability and stability [38].
From the above analysis, the modulation of morphology and surface properties of Al2O3 could be an efficient approach to prepare the supported-type Pt-Sn catalyst for the propene synthesis through direct propane dehydrogenation. In recent years, Al2O3 with diverse morphologies including nanosheets [33], nanorods [39], flower [40], nanowires [41], nanofibrous [42], and hollow microspheres [43], have been prepared by tuning the Al3+ precursors and precipitants. However, it is not easy to realize a novel morphology of Al2O3 with an open structure and unique surface properties. From references, the modification of surface acid property of Al2O3 was realized by using organic acid [44], alkaline-earth metals [21,22], and tuning of hydrothermal process [45]. Melamine is a special molecule, which can controllably release NH3 and cyanuric acid, and then to be mineralized to ammonia and CO2 in the hydrothermal process [46], as well as surface modification for carbon nanotubes based on previous work of our group [47]. From reference [48], the melamine-Al(NO3)3 complex was used as precursor to produce g-C3N4 with increased surface area through heat treatment, in which the Al ion in melamine-Al(NO3)3 complex serves as a template and a hydrogen-bonding partner of melamine. Therefore, we envisage that it is possible to fabricate Al2O3 supports with unique morphology and surface properties through an easy hydrothermal process with melamine-Al(NO3)3 complex as an unique precursor, in which the complex may serve as Al precursor, template, and precipitant.
In this work, we prepared carambola-like Al2O3-mel with an open structure by a facile hydrothermal process with melamine-Al(NO3)3 complex as Al precursor, template, and precipitant, producing an excellent carrier for the Pt-Sn supported catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Benefitting from enhanced C–H activation by electron-deficient nature of Pt sites and promoted mass transfer by its unique morphology, the developed Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel shows 22.5 s−1 of high turnover TOF with 99.1% of high selectivity and high stability. This work presents an excellent Pt-Sn catalyst for propene generation through direct dehydrogenation of propane.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of diverse Al2O3 supports
The carambola-like Al2O3-mel was prepared by a facile complex assisted hydrothermal process using melamine-Al(NO3)3 complex as Al precursor, template, and precipitant. The melamine-Al(NO3)3 complex was prepared by using a previously reported process with a minor modification [48]. Typically, 3.75 g aluminium nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O, Sinopharm, 99%) was added into deionized water and then the required melamine (Tian Jin Guangfu Fine Reagent Corp., the purifity is 99.5%) was added into Al3+ aqueous solution under stirring. The melamine-Al(NO3)3 complex containing aqueous solution was obtained. After stirring for a while, the as-formed mixture was transferred into the Teflon-lined stainless autoclave to perform complex assisted hydrothermal process. The product was filtered, and then it washed by using deionized water for several times. After that it was dried at 105 °C overnight. Finally, the Al2O3 was obtained by calcination in a muffle furnace at 600 °C for 4 h with a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1, and denoted as Al2O3-mel. By using 2.5 and 5 h of hydrothermal time, the other two Al2O3 supports were prepared, which are denoted as Al2O3-mel-2.5H and Al2O3-mel-5H, respectively. For comparison, the ammonium hydroxide (ChengDu KeLong Chemical Reagent Factory, 25%–28%) was used as precipitant to replace melamine. The as-obtained Al2O3 is denoted as Al2O3-amm.
2.2. Synthesis of supported-type Pt-Sn catalysts
The Pt-Sn supported catalyst on Al2O3 was prepared by an impregnation method. Typically, H2PtCl6·6H20 (ShenYang Nonferrous Metal Research Institute, 37.5% Pt) and/or SnCl2·2H2O (TianJin GuangFu technology Development Co. Ltd, 98%) were mixed in anhydrous alcohol to obtain Pt-Sn containing impregnant. The Pt-Sn was loaded on the Al2O3-mel support by IWI method. After impregnation, the samples were dried at 105 °C for 12 h and calcined in muffle furnace at 600 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The theoretical loading of Pt and Sn was 0.5 and 0.95 wt%, respectively. The as-prepared supported Pt-Sn catalyst is denoted as Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel. For comparison, the orther two Pt-Sn/Al2O3-amm and Pt-Sn/Al2O3-com catalysts were synthesized by using the similar process as above except for using the as-prepared Al2O3-amm and the commercially available Al2O3-com to replace Al2O3-mel.
2.3. Characterization of Al2O3 carriers and the supported-type Pt-Sn catalysts
The morphology of Al2O3 was obtained from SEM on a JEOL JSM-5600LV SEM instrument. The samples were well dispersed in ethanol before examined. The textural properties of Al2O3 carriers were determined by nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiments at 77 K over a Beishide apparatus of model 3H-2000PS1 system. The sample was degassed at 150 °C for 8 h before it to be measured. The actual loading of Pt and Sn supported in catalysts was measured by using ICP-OES technique. The catalyst sample was dissolved in nitrohydrochloric acid at 150 °C for 2 h and volatile acid was evaporated before determined.
CO-chemisorption was carried out on a Builder PCA-1200 apparatus attached with a thermal conductor detector. 100 mg catalyst (20–40 mesh) was loaded in a quartz tube. The the catalyst was pretreated in an Ar atmosphere (200 °C, 1 h). After the sample was cooled down to room temperature, the test gas containing 10 vol% H2 in Ar with 20 mL min−1 of flow rate was introduced into the reactor at 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 for 1 h for reduction treatment. After that, the quartz tube was cooled and maintained at 50 °C in He (20 mL min−1). Then 0.3 mL pulses of 10 vol% CO/He mixture was introduced into the quartz tube. The dispersity of activity sites was estimated by the following formula:
Where VS is the absorbed CO volume on the samples (mL), SF is a defined stoichiometric constant, SW is denoated as the weight of active metal (g), the MW is pointed as the relative molecular weight of active metal (g mol−1). NH3-TPD data were acquired on a Builder Chemisorption (PCA-1200) instrument attaching a thermal conductivity detector to determine the desorbed ammonia. 100 mg of sample was loaded into a quartz tubular reactor between two quartz-wool plugs. The sample was pretreated at 600 °C by heating with a ramp rate of 10 °C min-1 in Ar for 1 h. After the sample was cooled to room temperature, the ammonia saturation process was conducted at 100 °C by an ammonia pulse injection method. NH3 desorption step was performed by heating the sample from 100 to 600 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C min-1 under an Ar flow. The type of acid sites (Brönsted (B) and Lewis (L)) and relative amount (B/L) were measured by pyridine-IR. The pyridine-IR spectra were recorded at room temperature in the wavenumber range of 1590-1410 cm-1 on an EQUINOX-55 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (BRUKER). The as-prepared solid acid catalysts were pressed into a self-supporting wafer (ca. 15 mg/cm), and introduced into a quartz IR cell with CaF2 windows. The samples were pretreated in situ by heating in a stream of helium at 30 mL/min from room temperature to 450 °C and 5 × 10-3 Pa for 30 min. The cell was subsequently cooled to room temperature and pyridine vapor was passed into the cell and adsorbed onto the samples for a period of 30 min. After removal of the excess pyridine, the spectrum was recorded. The sample was then evacuated at 150, 300 and 450 °C for 30 min and a corresponding spectrum was recorded to distinguish the acid site. The relative intensities of the vibration bands at 1540 and 1450 cm-1 were assigned to the B and L acid sites, respectively.
H2-TPR experiment was carried out by using a Builder PCA-1200 apparatus equipped with a thermal conductor detector. The 50 mg of catalyst (20–40 mesh) was introduced into a quartz tube. Then it was pretreated in Ar at 200 °C for 1 h. After it was cooled to room temperature, the 10% H2/Ar (15 mL min−1) gas was introduced into sample, and the sample was heated with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to 850 °C and then the temperarure was maintained at 850 °C for 1 h. In situ DRIFT spectra were collected on a Bruker Equinox5 FT-IR spectrometer with a MCT detector. The catalyst was reduced at 600 °C for 1 h in 20% H2/Ar (30 mL min−1) and transferred into the diffuse IR environmental chamber under Ar atmosphere. The catalyst was pretreated at 400 °C for 1 h in H2 (20 mL min−1) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. After cooled to 30 °C, the catalysts were flushed with Ar for 0.5 h and CO-DRIFT spectra were recorded. Then 2% CO/Ar (40 mL·min−1) was passed through the chamber for 0.5 h until the CO adsorption bands remained constant. The catalyst was flushed under Ar (40 mL min−1) atmosphere and the CO-DRIFT spectra were collected every 10 °C steps from 30 to 100 °C. The coke deposition behavior of the spent catalysts was studied by using a TGA technique over the SDT-Q600 instrucment. Before measurement, the catalyst was treated at 200 °C for 1 h in Ar atmosphere to remove the adsorbed water. After cooled to ambient temperature, the gas was switched to 20% O2/N2 (100 mL min−1) and then the sample was heated with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 up to 900 °C. The XPS spectra were performed on an ESCALAB 250 XPS system with Al Kα X-ray source.
2.4. Catalytic performance measurement
The catalytic performance test was performed in a tubular fixed-bed quartz reactor (I.D. = 4 mm) at atmospheric pressure. 0.15 g catalyst (20–40 mesh) was loaded into the quartz tubular reactor and then it was reduced in 20% H2/Ar at 600 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Then the reaction gas mixture with a 50 mL·min−1 of total flow rate (26% propane) passed through the reactor at 600 °C. The calcination of the spend catalysts at 600 °C was performed to regenerate the catalysts, and the catalytic performance of the regenerated catalysts were tested with the same process and reaction conditions as above. The products were analyzed by TCD on an on-line gas chromatograph with molecular sieve 5A and porapak Q columns. Conversion of propane and selectivity of products were calculated as follows:
Where the letter “i” is the number of carbon atom for hydrocarbon products in the effluent gas, and Fout[Ci'] is the flow rate of corresponding product. Moreover, the turnover frequency (TOF) is defined as the moles of transformed C3H8 conversion per mole of active site per second at steady state (34 h of time on stream), and the number of active sites is obtained from the CO chemisorption measurement.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preparation and characterization of Al2O3 carriers
As presented in Scheme 1, the melamine was added into Al(NO3)3 aqueous solution to synthesize melamine-Al(NO3)3 complex. The mixture containing the melamine-Al(NO3)3 complex was transferred into Teflon-lined stainless autoclave to carry out the hydrothermal process. The Al2O3-mel was recovered by the filtering, washing, drying and the subsequent calcinations. By tuning the hydrothermal time, the Al2O3-mel-2.5H and Al2O3-mel-5H were also prepared.
Fig. 1 shows the SEM images of the Al2O3-mel-2.5H, Al2O3-mel-5H, and Al2O3-mel. For comparison, both Al2O3-amm (Fig. 1d) and Al2O3-com (Fig. S1) were also included. From Fig. 1a–d, the disordered Al2O3 nanosheets gradually assemble into carambola-like structure along with the extending hydrothermal time from 2.5 to 10 h. The carambola-like structured Al2O3-mel composed of thinner nanosheets (Fig. 1c) is obtained. The formation of the unique carambola-like opening morphology may result from the template effect and the special precipitant role of melamine in the complex owing to the hydrolysis of melamine to cyanuric acid with NH3 and then the gradual mineralization of cyanuric acid into ammonia and CO2 in the hydrothermal process [46]. That is to say, the melamine-Al(NO3)3 complex simultaneously serves as Al precursor, template, and precipitant in the formation of carambola-like hierarchically structured Al2O3 with opening structure composed of thin nanosheets through complex assisted hydrothermal process. However, the granular particles of Al2O3-amm with a diameter of about 50 nm were obtained via a similar process with ammonium hydroxide as a precipitant. Moreover, it can be observed that Al2O3-com consists of bulk structure with various sizes (Fig. S1).

The textural properties of Al2O3 carriers were explored by N2 adsorption-desorption experiments. Fig. 2 presents the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, and the pore size distribution by a BJH mode (inset in Fig. 2), and the textural properties are listed in Table 1 . From Fig. 2, the samples own Type-IV isotherm with different hysteresis loops, suggesting variety of pore structures [49]. Al2O3-mel features the type H3 hysteresis loop, associated with the slit-shaped pores from the plate-like structure that corresponds to the outcome exhibited in Fig. 1c. However, Al2O3-amm shows a type H1 loop, perfectly conforms to compacts of particles (Fig. 1d) in a narrow distribution of pore size. For another, Al2O3-com displays a type H4 loop, which is related to the narrow slit-like pores that formed by the bulk structure of Al2O3. From Table 1, the carambola-like Al2O3-mel composed of lathy sheets has a 0.47 cm3 g−1 of pore volume with a most probable pore size of 3.2 nm, but it also has pore diameter distributions of 10–40 nm, which is assigned to the pile hole of lathy sheets. In comparison with Al2O3-mel, Al2O3-amm has 152.5 m2 g−1 of the larger specific surface area and the 0.49 cm3 g−1 of the largest pore volume, which is possibly due to the most probable pore size of 6.8 nm. Among the three carriers, Al2O3-com possesses the largest specific surface area of 222.5 m2 g−1 but with the smallest pore volume of 0.37 cm3 g−1 and the slit-like pore of 3.6 nm. Therefore, a variety of Al2O3 carriers with different morphologies and textural properties were prepared. The above work develops an excellent carrier for preparing the Pt-Sn supported catalysts for propane direct dehydrogenation towards propene production.

The acid-base properties of Al2O3 carriers notably affected the catalytic performance of supported Pt-Sn catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propene [35]. The NH3-TPD and pyridine-IR experiments were performed to measure the acidic properties of the as-prepared Al2O3-mel and Al2O3-amm carriers. Fig. 3 presents the NH3-TPD profiles and pyridine-IR spectra, and Table 2 summarizes quantitative results. From Fig. 3 and Table 2, Al2O3-mel shows lower acidic amount than Al2O3-amm and especially shows no visible Bronsted acidic sites, which can lower the coke deposition. From reference [35], strong Lewis acidic sites can promote the C–H activation. From Table 2, Al2O3-mel shows similar amount of strong Lewis acidic sites to Al2O3-amm.

3.2. Characterization of supported-type Pt-Sn catalysts
The Pt-Sn was loaded on aforementioned Al2O3 carriers to prepare the supported-type catalysts. The loading of Pt and Sn supported in Al2O3 were measured by ICP-OES and are listed in Table 3. From Table 3, the actual Pt and Sn loading is very close to theoretical loading. CO chemisorption experiment shows the dispersity of active sites strongly depends on the nature of Al2O3 support. It is understandable that the Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel shows a lower metallic dispresity than the other two since Al2O3-mel has lower surface area. However, although Al2O3-com has a much higher surface area than Al2O3-amm, the Pt-Sn/Al2O3-com shows a slight lower dispersity of active species, which may originates from the different pore structure (Fig. 2).

The interaction between Pt and Al2O3 was explored by H2-TPR experiments. As displayed in Fig. 4, the peaks at 200–300 °C are attributed to PtO2 interacted weakly with Al2O3, while peaks at 300–600 °C belong to the PtClxOy interacted strongly with Al2O3 [33]. There are distinct peaks at the temperature higher than 600 °C. In order to ascertain these peaks, we also performed H2-TPR experiments on the supported single-metallic Sn catalysts on the diverse carriers (Fig. S2). It can be found out that the peaks at 850 °C, 750 °C and 740 °C for Al2O3-mel, Al2O3-amm and Al2O3-com may be assigned to the desorbed H2O from the reduction of hydroxyl groups (−OHs) on Al2O3 support or the possible dehydration process of the neighboring hydroxyl groups on Al3+ ions [35,38]. Besides the visible peaks of Al−OH higher than 700 °C, we could also find that the reduction of Sn species starts at 200 °C and has a broad peak during 200 °C and 700 °C. Therefore, the reduction peaks at 720 °C, 770 °C and 690 °C for Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel, Pt-Sn/Al2O3-amm and Pt-Sn/Al2O3-com, respectively, could be regarded as the reduction of Sn species. From Fig. 4, in contrast to the pure Pt supported catalyst, the supported Pt-Sn catalysts show higher-temperature reduction peak corresponding to Pt species, ascribed to the Pt-Sn interaction. The peaks towards the reduction of the PtOx species interacting weakly with support of Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel, Pt-Sn/Al2O3-amm and Pt-Sn/Al2O3-com shift to higher temperature by 37 °C, 44 °C and 36 °C, respectively; while the ones towards the reduction of PtOx species interact strongly with supports shift by 120 °C, 95 °C and 105 °C, respectively. The much larger shift towards Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel than those of Pt-Sn/Al2O3-amm and Pt-Sn/Al2O3-com indicates the much stronger interaction of Pt with Sn [50]. The interaction between Pt species and Sn species or Al2O3 not only affects the stability of Pt species, but also decreases the electronic state of Pt species, which subsequently affects the catalysis for propane activation [[51], [52], [53]].

Furthermore, we determined the electronic state of Pt species by in situ DRIFT using CO as probe molecule. As presented in Fig. 5, we observe obvious difference for the four samples. The bands at 2066-2092 cm−1 are indexed as the linearly adsorbed CO on Pt0 [33,34]. In comparison with the band of CO DRIFT spectra of Pt/Al2O3-mel at 2066 cm−1 (Fig. 5a), the band for Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel shifts to 2092 cm−1, suggesting the lowering electronic density of Pt because the electron transfer from Pt species to Sn species takes place by the strong Pt-Sn interaction. Furthermore, from Fig. 5b–d, the bands corresponding to CO linearly adsorbed on Pt0 appear at around 2092, 2076, and 2080 cm−1 over Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel, Pt-Sn/Al2O3-amm, and Pt-Sn/Al2O3-com, respectively, implying electronic-deficiency of Pt for the Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel than the other two catalysts [51]. This is crucial for the catalytic activity during propane dehydrogenation because of the electronic-deficiency of Pt has low adsorption energy for propane [52]. The lower the electronic density of Pt, the more difficult the desorption of CO [53]. Fig. S3 further shows the stronger CO adsorption on the Pt0 of Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel catalyst than that on the other two catalysts, which indicates that the interaction between Pt species and Sn species for Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel is stronger than that for Pt-Sn/Al2O3-amm and Pt-Sn/Al2O3-com. The results are corresponded to the analysis of H2-TPR profiles (Fig. 4). Besides the bands of CO adsorbed on Pt0, there are some bands at 2112-2120 cm−1 assigned to CO adsorbed on Pt2+ [[54], [55], [56], [57], [58]], indicating that some Pt2+ are not reduced to Pt0 completely.

XPS analysis was performed to investigate the Pt-Sn interaction. Fig. 6 presents XPS spectra of the Pt/Al2O3-mel. Compared to Pt/Al2O3-mel (70.6 eV), both Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel (72.4 eV) and Pt-Sn/Al2O3-amm (71.4 eV) catalysts show higher binding energy towards Pt 4f7/2, suggesting the electron-deficient Pt sites owing to the electron transfer from Pt to Sn species [59,60]. The more increase in binding energy of Pt 4f7/2 for Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel than that for Pt-Sn/Al2O3-amm, suggesting the stronger Pt-Sn interaction, which is consistent with the results from in situ CO-DRIFT. Fig. 6 presents XPS spectra of Pf 4f on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel catalysts with diverse molar ratios of Pt/Sn. From Fig. 7, no visible change in the binding energy of Pt 4f7/2 can be observed if the 1:1 of Pt/Sn molar ratio is used. The increasing Sn addition from 1:1 to 1:3 of Pt/Sn molar ratio leads to an obvious binding energy shift from 70.6 to 72.4 eV, ascribed to the elelctron transfer from Pt to Sn. However, the Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel catalyst with 1:5 of Sn/Pt ratio shows a similar binding energy of Pt 4f7/2 to that of Pt/Al2O3-mel catalyst, which might be ascribed to the weakened Pt-Sn interaction by the possible larger particle sizes led by higher loading. All in all, the Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel catalyst with 1:3 of Pt/Sn molar ratio shows more electron-deficient characteristic than the other samples owing to stronger Pt-Sn interaction, which endows Pt sites with higher activity for C–H activation.

3.3. Catalytic performance in propane direct dehydrogenation
The catalytic performance of the supported bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts on different Al2O3 carriers for propane direct dehydrogenation was tested. As presented in Fig. 8 and Table 3, the developed Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel catalyst shows much higher activity and a little higher stability than the Pt-Sn/Al2O3-amm and Pt-Sn/Al2O3-com catalysts, and 33.9% initial conversion with the 22.5 s−1 of TOF at steady state on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel catalyst can be obtained. From previously reported result [35], strong Lewis acidic sites can promote the C–H activation. From Table 2, Al2O3-mel shows a slightly lower amount of strong Lewis acidic sites than Al2O3-amm. Therefore, the superior activity of Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel catalyst compared to the other two samples mainly originates from the promoted activation of C–H by the more electron-deficient nature of Pt sites and intensified mass transfer by the unique morphology. All of the three catalysts show high selectivity towards the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propene. From Table S1, the developed Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel catalyst indicates much superior catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. To correlate the catalytic nature and catalytic properties, it can be concluded that the much higher catalytic activity of Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel catalyst in comparison with the supported Pt-Sn catalysts on the traditional Al2O3-amm and Al2O3-com supports can originate from efficiently the promoted activation of propane by the electron-deficient nature of Pt due to strengthened Pt-Sn interaction, and the promoted mass transfer of support, resulting from the unique morphology and surface chemistry properties of Al2O3-mel support. Moreover, from Fig. 8 and Table 3, Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel catalyst shows higher stability than the other two catalysts. By using the selected Al2O3-mel carrier, the Pt/Sn molar ratio was further optimized. From Fig. 9, the addition of Sn can significantly promote the direct dehydrogenation of propane, ascribed to the strengthened electron-deficient nature led by the electron transfer from Pt to Sn owing to the Sn-Pt interaction confirmed by XPS, CO DRIFTs, and TPR results (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). The too many Sn addition (Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel with 1:5 of Pt/Sn) leads to a weakened Pt-Sn interaction (Fig. 7), which deteriorates the activation ability of Pt. Therefore, the 1:3of optimum Pt/Sn ratio is required. From above, the 0.11% Pt-0.84%Sn/Al2O3-mel with 1:3 of Pt/Sn molar ratio has been developed for propene production through direct dehydrogenation of propane.

3.4. Characterization of spent catalysts
Furthermore, the coke deposition behavior of the spent Pt-Sn supported catalysts was explored by TGA experiments. From Fig. 10, Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel shows a lower total amount of coke deposition (4.6%) than Pt-Sn/Al2O3-amm (5.6%) and Pt-Sn/Al2O3-com (6.1%), ascribed to its less acidic sites affirmed by NH3-TPD and pyridine-IR analysis. Moreover, the weight loss signal appearing at the temperature less than 400 °C can be assigned to the coke depositing on Pt active sites [5]. The largest amount of coke deposition on Pt-Sn/Al2O3-amm catalyst is one reason for its quick decreasing conversion along with the time on stream that shown in Fig. 8. The spent Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel catalyst shows lower coke deposition than the other two catalysts. Furthermore, the regeneration behavior of the spent catalysts through measuring the catalytic performance of the regenerated catalysts (Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel-R and Pt-Sn/Al2O3-amm-R) by calcination process (Fig. 11). From Fig. 11, both of the two regenerated catalysts by removing coke through calcinations process shows lower catalytic activity than their corresponding fresh catalysts, suggesting the appearance of Pt sintering during the reaction. From Table 3, the spent catalysts show much lower Pt dispersity in comparison with their corresponding fresh ones, affirming the possible Pt sintering besides the possible coverage of Pt active sites by the deposited coke. Therefore, it can be proposed that the deactivation of supported Pt-Sn catalysts may originates from the coverage of active sites by coke and the Pt sintering. In a word, the developed Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel catalyst shows relatively high catalytic stability, resulting from the promoted sintering resistance and low coke deposition especially the coke deposited on active sites. The outstanding catalytic behavior concerning the high catalytic activity and selectivity, and also stability of Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel catalyst makes it have a great prospect for propene production via direct dehydrogenation of propane.

4. Conclusions
The carambola-like Al2O3-mel with an open structure has been prepared by a facile hydrothermal process with melamine-Al(NO3)3 complex as Al precursor, template, and precipitant, which serves as an outstanding carrier to prepare the supported Pt-Sn catalyst. It demonstrates 2.1 and 1.8 times higher turnover frequency (22.5 s−1) with high selectivity and catalytic stability for propane direct dehydrogenation than the conventional Pt-Sn/Al2O3-amm and Pt-Sn/Al2O3-com catalysts, respectively. The superior catalytic performance of Pt-Sn/Al2O3-mel can be ascribed to the enhanced activation of propane by the electron-deficient characteristic of Pt resulting from the intensified interaction of bimetallic Pt and Sn and the facilitated mass transfer led by the unique morphology and surface properties of the carambola-like Al2O3-mel featuring opening structure. Moreover, owing to unique morphology and surface properties, the developed carambola-like Al2O3 takes on a promising support for preparing the supported-type catalysts concerning diverse reactions. This work not only develops an excellent carambola-like Al2O3 carriers for supported Pt-Sn catalyst towards the propene synthesis through propane direct dehydrogenation, but also presents a facile complex assisted hydrothermal method for fabricate the other oxide carriers for diverse applications.
