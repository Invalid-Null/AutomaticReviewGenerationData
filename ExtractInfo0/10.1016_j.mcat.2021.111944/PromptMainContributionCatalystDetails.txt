Highlights
•
The MgF2 modified catalysts with adding different fluorides (NH4F, NaF or KF) in the mother liquid were synthesized.
•
They were applied to isobutane direct dehydrogenation.
•
The small particles of MgF2 and unsaturated MgF2 can provide weak acid sites.
Abstract
A series of MgF2-modified hydrotalcite-like (HT) derivatives supported Pt-In catalysts PtInHTR-X (X = NH4F, NaF and KF, R = reduced catalyst) were prepared by combination of hydrothermal method, alkali-etching and impregnation strategy and applied to direct dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene. The catalysts and precursors were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, TG, O2-TPO and low temperature N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The formation of MgF2 phase as dopant to modify the catalyst can influence the pore structure and even the surface acid properties of catalysts. Especially, compared with the three catalysts, PtInHTR-KF catalyst had better stability of isobutene selectivity of over 95% after 9 h reaction, and PtInHTR-NH4F and PtInHTR-NaF catalysts exhibited more stable isobutane activity of 60%. One of the reasons for this catalytic performance is that small particles of MgF2 and unsaturated MgF2 can provide weak acidic sites which can inhibit coke deposition. And it was found the improved catalytic performance was also related to the appropriate In3+/In0 ratio, well-dispersed Pt species and the excellent anti-sintering ability of catalysts modified MgF2.

1. Introduction
In recent years, global olefin demand has increased rapidly due to the rapid growth in the production of high value-adding downstream products. Among them, isobutene has attracted much attention as a raw material for downstream products such as butyl rubber, plastic and methyl methacrylate [1,2]. The traditional preparation methods of isobutene were steam naphtha cracking and heavy oil catalytic cracking [2], which would lead to high costs and much methane as byproducts [3], therefore, the direct dehydrogenation of isobutane, which is environmentally friendly and economical and efficient, has become a common preparation method at present [4].
In industrial production, the catalysts commonly used for the dehydrogenation of alkanes are mainly Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts. Because CrOx-based catalysts are harmful to the environment, Pt-based catalysts have become the most efficient and commonly used active metals for dehydrogenation of light alkanes [5]. Nevertheless, the monometallic Pt catalysts are easily deactivated due to sintering and coke deposition, which lead to low alkene selectivity and stability. Therefore, some metal promoters, such as Sn [6], [7], [8], In [9], [10], [11], Cu [12,13], Ga [14], Zn [15], Na [16] or Ge [17], are usually introduced into the Pt-based catalysts to enhance Pt electron density and improve Pt dispersion. Accordingly, the electronic and geometric effects of metal promoters on Pt species are beneficial for suppressing Pt sintering and improving activity and selectivity of dehydrogenation. Among these promoters, a lot of research attention has been given to element Sn. But now, many researchers pay more attention to the Pt-In bimetallic catalyst due to the elimination of large Pt ensembles and stable performance for the dehydrogenation [18,19]. Except Pt-In bimetallic structure, the “sandwich structure” of the Pt-In2O3-support is also proposed [20]. Further, typically non-metallic promoters are selected to adjust the acid sites of the support and promote the dispersion of the surface active centers to a certain extent, involving element B [21,22], F [23,24] and P [25], which can be added during the preparation process or by impregnation method. With regard to F- anion, the outstanding feature is the high electronegativity and small radius [26]. However, there is no any report about the application of F-based promoter over Pt-based catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation.
There are also support materials that can affect the catalytic performance and coke formation due to their specific surface area, acid-base properties and their own thermal stability [27]. In the late years, a lot of researchers have made a lot of attempts and experiments on the support materials, such as Al2O3 [27,28], SiO2 [29], ZrO2 [30], spinel MgAl2O4 [31] (or ZnAl2O4 [32]) and zeolite [33], for isobutene dehydrogenation catalysts. The suitable acidity of catalyst is an important property for direct dehydrogenation because it encourages the isobutane adsorption and the isobutene desorption, whereas a strong acid site can increase CH4 production which is undesirable. It has been found that the Mg-containing catalyst is a material with moderate acidity, which is perhaps suitable for this process. So the focus has now shifted to calcined MgAl hydrotalcite or hydrotalcite-like (HT) materials [9,10,34], because MgO can be well integrated with Al2O3, and they have been used for the direct dehydrogenation of propane, which have good performance compared with other supports. Generally, the HT materials are directly prepared by coprecipitation or hydrothermal method. And the In specie is usually loaded on the supports by impregnation [9] or directly introduced into the supports by direct addition method before Pt impregnation [35].
In this paper, we successfully synthesized the calcined MgF2 modified HT materials via adding different fluorides (NH4F, NaF, KF) supported Pt-In catalysts, which were evaluated in isobutane dehydrogenation at 600 °C under atmospheric pressure and exhibited great catalytic performance. These catalysts were prepared by dispersing Pt-In nanoparticles onto the calcined HT supports modified by fluorines. Our findings show that the catalysts PtInHTR-X (X = NH4F, NaF and KF) can greatly improve the catalytic activity and improvement in different directions, which PtInHTR-NH4F and PtInHTR-NaF catalysts have good enough isobutane conversion, while PtInHTR-KF catalyst has high stable isobutene selectivity. Then we used a large number of characterization techniques to reveal the relationship between the addition of different fluoride precursors leading to different dehydrogenation properties and physicochemical properties of the catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
2.1.1. Materials
SiO2 powders (> 98%) were purchased from TANSAIL Advanced Materials Co. Ltd (Nanjing, China). Mg(NO3)2•6H2O, Al(NO3)3•9H2O and urea were purchased from Fuchen Chemical Reagents Factory (Tianjin, China). H2PtCl6•6H2O was purchased from Mascot Chemical Co. Ltd (Tianjin, China). In(NO3)3•xH2O, NH4F, NaF and KF were purchased from Aladdin Industrial corporation (Shanghai, China).
2.1.2. Synthesis of supports
The precursor HT-KF was prepared by the combination of hydrothermal method and alkali-etching, and the specific processes and conditions were described in detail in our previous work [36]. Similarly, the precursor HT-NH4F and HT-NaF were also prepared under the same processes and conditions, except that KF is replaced with NaF or NH4F in the initial solution. After calcination at 600 ℃ for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 ℃ min-1, the corresponding supports HTC-X (X = NH4F, NaF or KF) were obtained.
2.1.3. Synthesis of catalysts
Referring to earlier work [36], a series of HTC-X supported catalysts PtInHTC-X (X = NH4F, NaF or KF) were acquired by combination of stepwise incipient wetness impregnation method as well as drying and calcination strategy. Firstly, it was impregnated in aqueous solution of In(NO3)3, after being dried above 120 °C for 12 h (InHT-X), the solid was calcined at 550 ℃ for 4 h (InHTC-X). Then the sample was impregnated with H2PtCl6•H2O solution, followed by the next drying step (PtInHT-X) and calcining step (PtInHTC-X).The loading amounts of Pt and In were 0.5 wt% and 1.4 wt%, respectively.
Before isobutane dehydrogenation reaction, these calcined catalysts were reduced (5 vol% H2/N2 at 600 °C for 2 h), which were labeled as PtInHTR-X (X=NH4F, NaF or KF).
After the 9 h reaction, the spent catalysts were marked as PtInHTU- X (X=NH4F, NaF or KF).
For comparison, the catalyst PtInHTR-NS without SiO2, catalyst PtInHTR containing SiO2 with alkali-etching treatment and catalyst PtInHTR-S containing SiO2 without alkali-etching treatment were also synthesized. The specific synthesis method was consistent with the above process.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The XRD patterns of samples were collected on a Bruker D8-Focus X-ray diffractometer (BRUKER AXS GMBH, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm), operating at 40 kV and 40 mA, at a scanning speed of 8 ° min-1 from 5 to 80 °
To obtain the textural properties of samples, Low-temperature N2 adsorption-desorption tests were carried on a TriStar 3000 micromeritics apparatus (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA) at −196 ℃. All samples were out-gassed under vacuum at 300 ℃ for 3 h prior to analysis. And the specific surface areas were calculated based on the BET method, meanwhile, the pore size distributions and the pore volume were derived from the desorption branch of isotherms using the method of BJH.
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were carried out using a MAIA3 TESAN at an accelerating voltage of 5.0 kV.
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the reduced and spent catalysts were observed on a JEM-2100F field-emission transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The samples after reductive treatment at 600 ℃ in a flow of 5 vol% H2/N2 for 2 h were ground into powder, dispersed in ethanol and dropped on carbon-film coated copper grids. Above one hundred individual metal particles were collected for the determination of average particle size of each sample through DigitalMicrograph.
The in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of catalysts were tested on an ESCALAB Xi+ (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) using Al Kα radiation. The BE was calibrated using the C1s level at 284.8 eV as an internal standard. During the process, all samples were reduced at 600 oC for 2 h under 5 vol% H2/N2 at 30 ml min-1 and cooled down to room temperature, evacuated and transferred to the analysis chamber of the XPS spectrometer
Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was carried on a DTG-50/50H (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) to calculate the coke amount over the spent catalysts, which was heated from room temperature to 900 ℃ at a rising rate of 10 ℃ min-1 in air.
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments were conducted in a programmable temperature system. Prior to TPO analysis, the spent catalysts were pretreated at room temperature for 1 h under flowing He. Then after steadying the baseline, the reactor was heated in a mixture of 10% O2 in He from room temperature to 800 ℃ at 10 ℃ min-1. Finally, the released CO2 signal was monitored by TCD.
2.3. Catalytic tests
The isobutane direct dehydrogenation reactions were tested in a fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor. The calcined fresh catalyst (0.5 g, 40–60 meshes) was set into the reactor and reduced in flowing H2/N2 (5 vol%, 30 mL min-1) at 600 ℃ for 2 h. Then reaction conditions were conducted as follows: the gas including the isobutane and hydrogen (the molar ratio of iC4H10 : H2= 1:1), the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of isobutane was 3 h-1, 600 ℃ for reaction temperature, and 0.1 MPa for the reaction pressure. The gas products were analyzed by the online gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (Al2O3 packed column). The isobutene conversion, isobutene selectivity and isobutene yield were calculated as follows:
where, iC4H10,in and iC4H10,out stand for the isobutane content in feed and exit gasses, respectively, iC4H8,out stands for the isobutene content in exit gas.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic activity
As clearly shown in Fig. S1, the dehydrogenation performance of the catalyst PtInHTR-S has been greatly improved compared with PtInHTR-NS without SiO2 template. After alkali-etching of PtInHTR-S, the obtained catalyst PtInHTR can further elevate the isobutane conversion and isobutene yield. Compared with other catalysts, the conversion of catalyst PtInHTR-NH4F is greatly improved to reach nearly 61% after 9 h of reaction. These results suggest that the addition of fluoride affect the dehydrogenation performance of catalysts.
To investigate the effect of different fluoride additives in catalysts on the isobutane dehydrogenation, the PtInHTR-X (X = NH4F, NaF and KF) catalysts were evaluated in the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction for 9 h. Fig. 1 represents the catalytic performance over the reduced catalysts, including not only conversion of isobutane, yield and selectivity of isobutene but also the selectivity of by-product methane. Firstly, as shown in Fig. 1a, the isobutane conversion of the catalysts can be almost close to 60% after 9 h of reaction. The conversion of the catalysts PtInHTR-NH4F remains constant at 61% within 8.5 h, and the conversion of the PtInHTR-NaF catalyst is comparable to it. Compared with the PtInHTR-NH4F and PtInHTR-NaF catalysts, although the conversion of the catalyst PtInHTR-KF is relatively poor, only 50% at 30 min, after 9 h of reaction it can reach 58%. And from Fig. 1b, it can be seen that the trend of isobutene yield with reaction time is nearly similar to that of isobutane conversion for all catalysts. The isobutene yield of PtInHTR-NH4F and PtInHTR-NaF can be kept at 57%. And the yield of PtInHTR-KF slightly exceeds that of PtInHTR-NH4F and PtInHTR-NaF after reaction of 6 h and goes up to 57% after 9 h, which can be attributed to the superior selectivity of PtInHTR-KF.

Meanwhile, from the comparison of the selectivity of isobutene with by-product methane, the selectivity of isobutene is much higher than the corresponding methane selectivity, indicating that the cracking reaction of the whole reaction process has been inhibited. The PtInHTR-NH4F and PtInHTR-NaF catalysts exhibit the declining isobutene selectivity, but it could be maintained at 90% at 9 h. In contrast, the selectivity to isobutene of catalyst PtInHTR-KF can be stabilized at 95% during the reaction. Furthermore, the selectivity of the by-product methane of the three catalysts is less than 4%, and especially the sample with KF added is only maintained at 1%, which is negligible relative to the isobutene selectivity. Thus, PtInHTR-KF catalyst can be largely suppressed cracking reaction on the catalyst, improve the selectivity and stability of the catalyst, which the isobutene yield could be slightly later than other catalysts.
Overall, the excellent performance of Pt-In based catalysts has been evidenced by high selectivity and yield. The results indicate that the addition of different fluorides in the mother liquid has a clearly different influence on the isobutane dehydrogenation performance of the catalysts, which depending on the physic-chemical properties of catalysts. The further details will be displayed as followed.
3.2. Structure, texture and physico-chemical properties of fresh catalysts
3.2.1. XRD
Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the precursors and corresponding calcined and reduced catalysts, and the detail evolution processes of PtInHTR-NH4F samples are demonstrated in Fig. S2. Table 1 lists some structural properties of all precursors. As can be seen in Fig. 2a, the characteristic peaks of HT phase (JCPDS file No. 51–1525) are observed in each case. The broad and well-defined diffraction peaks indicate that the obtained HT phase is poorly crystallized and the HT nanosheets tend to be thin. And the addition of different fluorides in the mother liquid can result in the decrease of HT diffraction peak intensity, according to the following order HT-KF > HT-NaF > HT-NH4F. Besides the diffraction peaks of HT phase, the slightly increased characteristic diffraction peaks of MgF2 phase (JCPDS file No. 41–1443) also can be detected in accordance with the order of HT-KF, HT-NaF and HT-NH4F. The formation of MgF2 should be ascribed to the stronger MgF (approximately 110 kJ/mol) bond than MgO (approximately 90 kJ/mol) and MgOH (approximately 56 kJ/mol) bonds [37]. In addition, there is no any shift of (003) and (006) diffraction indicating no change in the basal spacing for all samples. As shown in Table 1, the value of basal spacing (d003) is about 0.760 nm. These indicate that the planar CO32- is the only guest anion in the interlayer of HT phase, and there is no F- anion in the interlayer. It is in line with the fact that the exchange ability of CO32- anion is stronger than that of F- anion [38].

As shown in Fig. 2b and c, after calcination and reduction, the HT phase is absolutely transformed into Mg(Al)O phase, corresponding to the transformation of a two-dimensional layered structure to a three-dimensional structure, which the diffraction peaks of the periclase MgO phase (JCPDS file No. 45–0946) appear at 2θ = 36 °, 43 ° and 63 °. And the diffraction peak of the MgF2 phase is still observed, indicating that the MgF2 phase did not disappear. It can be attributed to that the MgF bond strength is stronger than MgO, which makes it not easy to transform. However, the calcination and reduction make the MgF2 diffraction peak of samples adding NaF and KF in the mother liquid slightly enhance. The characteristic diffraction peaks of MgF2 phase become slightly increased in the order of PtInHTC-KF, PtInHTC-NH4F and PtInHTC-NaF. The same tendency can be found in the reduced samples (Fig. 2d). The stronger the diffraction peak intensity, the bigger the particle size of MgF2. This indicates the MgF2 particle size of sample containing KF is slightly smaller relative to that of containing NaF and NH4F. At the same time, the diffraction peaks of Pt and In species cannot be found for all the catalysts, which may be owing to their small particle size and/or low concentration below XRD detection limit.
3.2.2. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms
To evaluate the textural properties of the catalysts, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms are depicted in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3a, the three catalysts can be categorized under mesoporous structure and show the type IV curves with the clear H2 hysteresis loops, instead of H3 hysteresis loops of typical slit-shaped pore for HT-based catalysts [10], wherein once again indicating the characteristic of the hierarchical mesoporous structure. Fig. 3b shows the corresponding pore size distributions (PSD) of the catalysts, and it can be seen that the pore distribution is broad and mainly concentrated in the range of 3–30 nm, further confirming the mesoporous feature, which is consistent with the results in Fig. 3a, especially, the hierarchical porous feature for catalyst PtInHTC-KF.

The textural properties of the prepared catalysts are clearly summarized in Table 2. Compared with the textural properties of samples PtInHTC-NaF and PtInHTC-NH4F, PtInHTC-KF sample exhibits the largest BET special surface area and the similar most probable pore size and total pore volume. The big hierarchical pore of PtInHTC-KF is beneficial to provide easily accessible active sites and take full advantage of the pore properties for dehydrogenation reaction [10].

3.2.3. SEM
The SEM images of three calcined catalysts are displayed in Fig. 4. Overall, the typical mesoporous morphology can be observed for each material. For sample PtInHTC-NH4F in Fig. 4a, the using of NH4F results in the nanosheet arrays crossing each other and leaves a wealth of channels on catalysts. The full replacement of NH4F by NaF or KF, as shown in Fig. 4c and e, makes the nanosheets become bigger and the channels become more uniform. This shows that during the hydrothermal synthesis process, fluoride specie can tune the structure of morphology and pore for the catalyst to a certain extent. One of the reasons for the formation of flake structure on the surface of the three catalysts is that fluorine ion can activate the substrate, which leads to re-crystallization and re-growth in the hydrothermal process [39]. The difference of the size of the lamellar structure of the three catalysts may be related to the properties of the cations.

3.2.4. TEM
In order to understand the dispersion and existence form of the metal particles on the reduced catalyst surface, the TEM characterization was carried out, and the TEM images and particle size distribution (PSD) information are shown in the Fig. 4. As we can see, the PSD of the metal particles of the catalyst exhibits a narrow phenomenon, indicating that the metal particles are well dispersed on these catalysts. According to statistical data, the average diameters of metal particles of PtInHTR-NH4F, PtInHTR-NaF and PtInHTR-KF catalysts are 1.0 nm, 1.1 nm and 1.2 nm, respectively. The small active metal size is much important for enhancing catalyst activity because the small active metals are less active for cracking reaction and deep dehydrogenation. In addition, the images of the reduced catalysts present 0.226 nm lattice spacing, which belongs to the metal Pt (111) nanoparticles. However, the lattice spacing of the zero-valent In or Pt-In alloy cannot be recognized in TEM images, due to the more In2O3 species on the surface.
3.2.5. XPS
To analyze the surface elemental compositions and chemical states of elements on the surface of reduced catalysts, XPS measurements were carried out, and Fig. 5 presents XPS spectra including the peaks of In 3d, Mg 1s and F 1s, with a summary of the binding energy (BE), peak intensity and ratio of every peak for the samples in Table 3.

The whole survey XPS spectra of the each sample were shown in Fig. 5A, and it can be seen that the catalysts indeed contain F element. According to the results of XRD above, it can be known that fluorine is present on these catalysts in the form of MgF2. To deeply explore the metal-support interaction and the role of MgF2, the XPS spectra are mainly focused on the In 3d, Mg 1s and F 1s regions, except Pt 4f, because the energy region of Pt 4f is overlapped with the strong Al 2p peak. The broad In 3d spectra of the reduced samples as shown in Fig. 5B can be deconvoluted into four Gaussian peaks, including the zero-valent In (In0) at 444.5 eV and 452.2 eV, the oxidation state of surface In species (In3+) at 445.6 eV and 453.2 eV, respectively [10,20,34]. It should be noted that there are almost no differences in the BE values of all In3+ and In0. This indicates that the electron transfer from In to Pt is not influenced by the appearance of MgF2. Meanwhile, the ratio of In3+/In0 follows a decreasing trend in accordance with the order of PtInHTR-NH4F, PtInHTR-NaF and PtInHTR-KF. This indicates MgF2 with different particle sizes can inhibit the reduction of In3+ ions to some different degrees. It is known that an excess of In0 can block the active center of Pt, which is unfavorable to the dehydrogenation reaction, while an appropriate ratio of In3+/In0 on the surface is more conducive to the dehydrogenation reaction [20,34]. Some research suggests that a moderate amount of In0 is beneficial to inhibiting Pt sintering and coke formation and even facilitating desorption of olefins from Pt-based catalysts [40,41], which is consistent with high isobutene selectivity of catalyst PtInHTR-KF.
Then Fig. 5C shows the XPS spectra of Mg 1s region for the reduced catalysts, one peaks appearing at 1304.1 eV corresponds to MgO (MgI), and the other one at 1305.2 eV can be attributed to MgF2 (MgII) species, respectively [42]. This further proves the presence of MgF2 in all samples. As shown in Fig. 5D, the spectra of F 1s can be deconvoluted into two peaks, representing two different coordination states of F species. The peak at BE of 686.3 eV is related to F ions (FI) in saturated MgF2 with six F ions coordinated Mg. Another peak at BE of 685.4 eV can be assigned to F ions (FII) bound to under coordinated Mg in unsaturated MgF2 [43]. It is just the under coordinated Mg, that is 4-fold and 5-fold coordinated Mg, results in the formation of abundant amounts of weak Lewis sites in MgF2 [43]. The relative amount of unsaturated MgF2 can be estimated by multipling MgII/MgI ratio by FII/FI ratio in Table 3. The obtained values show that the relative amount of unsaturated MgF2 in PtInHTR-KF sample is higher than that of other F-modified samples. It means that there are more weak Lewis acid sites for PtInHTR-KF sample. It is also pointed out that the small MgF2 particles favors the formation of weak acid sites [43]. Combined with the XRD analysis about MgF2 phase in the reduced samples, it further verifies that the amount of relatively weak acid sites increases in the following order PtInHTR-NaF < PtInHTR-NH4F < PtInHTR-KF, which is consistent with the increasing isobutene selectivity. The highest isobutene selectivity and lowest methane selectivity for catalyst PtInHTR-KF should be attributed to the most amounts of weak acid sites, which is not favorable for coking [43]. Hence, the modification of MgF2 significantly affects the surface acidity of catalysts, thereby affecting the stability of the dehydrogenation performance.
By comparing the relative ratio of In3+/In0, MgII/MgI and FII/FI, it can be found that the variation trend of the saturated MgF2 content is nearly opposite to the zero-valent In. It can be further confirmed that the low zero-valent In, that is high In3+/In0 ratio, is mainly arising from the coverage of big MgF2 nanoparticles with abundant coordinated Mg species. It suggests that the amount and size of MgF2 also can be used to adjust the surface chemical state of In species, so as to affect the catalytic activity.
3.3. Analysis of coke deposition and Pt-sintering in the spent catalysts
3.3.1. TG-DTA and O2-TPO
During the dehydrogenation process, the coke deposition is one of the reasons for the deactivation of catalysts, so TG of the spent catalysts was applied for coke analysis. First, TG curves of different catalysts after 9 h reaction are shown in Fig. 6A, and the mass loss of all samples should be related to the removal of deposited coke by combustion. The coke amount on the used F-modified catalysts decreases in the following order PtInHTU-NaF > PtInHTU-NH4F > PtInHTU-KF. This result is consistent with the trend of methane selectivity of the catalyst (see Fig. 1b), which means that the higher the methane selectivity, the more coke deposition on the surface. And it can be seen that PtInHTR-KF can significantly inhibit the coke deposition.

And to investigate the location of deposited coke, the O2-TPO profiles for the spent catalysts are shown in Fig. 6B. For the MgF2-modified catalysts PtInHTU-NH4F, PtInHTU-NaF and PtInHTU-KF, the spent catalyst presents three peaks at 401 °C (peak I), 612 °C (peak II) and 700 ℃ (peak III), respectively. According to the literature, the three peaks on the surface of the catalyst can be divided into two kinds of carbon deposition. Firstly, the peak I is related to the coke deposited near the metal-support interface [44]. The peak II and III are less reactive, which appears at higher temperature, corresponding to the coke deposited on the support [45]. In other word, the coke on the MgF2-modified catalysts is mainly located on the metal-support interface and on the support, and there is no coke deposition on the metal active sites. It implied that the deposited coke on the MgF2-modified catalysts can be easily transferred from the metal active sites to support. This behavior is beneficial to fully utilize the metal active sites and thus maintain the good catalytic activity over catalysts.
3.3.2. TEM
Fig. 7 shows the TEM images and PSD histograms of the spent catalysts. Compared with the TEM images in Fig. 4, the average diameters of PtInHTU-NH4F, PtInHTU-NaF and PtInHTU-KF have a slight increase from 1.0 to 2.1 nm, 1.1 to 2.1 nm and 1.2 to 2.1 nm, respectively. These also mean that the metal particles have agglomerated in a certain extent after 9 h of reaction. However, the order of the anti-sintering ability of the catalyst is PtInHTR-KF > PtInHTR-NH4F = PtInHTR-NaF, which indicates that the addition of MgF2 can inhibit the sintering of Pt particles to a certain extent. And the catalyst PtInHTR-KF has better sintering resistance. Consistent with the SEM results (see Fig. S3a), there are also coke deposits on the spent catalyst surface from TEM results as shown in Fig. 7b. And from Fig. 7b, the coke deposits can be seen clearly and Pt nanoparticles can still be seen on the spent catalyst surface.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully synthesized a series of the fluorine-doped hydrotalcite-like compounds by adding different fluorides via a simple hydrothermal method. After alkali etching, calcination, Pt-In impregnation and reduction, the excellent catalysts were obtained. Firstly, PtInHTR-KF catalyst has excellent stability of isobutene selectivity of over 95%, and PtInHTR-NH4F and PtInHTR-NaF catalysts exhibit more stable isobutane activity of 60%. In addition, we find the fluorides play the key roles in changing the morphology of PtInHTC-X (X=NH4F, NaF, KF) through SEM measurement, which the flake structure appeared in the morphology of the catalyst and the catalyst with large specific surface area was obtained from BET data. And XPS results prove that the appropriate In3+/In0 ratio of PtInHTR-KF is advantage to the isobutene formation. And from XPS results of Mg 1s and F 1s, we can see the acidity of the catalyst surface change because of the effect of small particles of MgF2 and unsaturated MgF2. In addition, the better resistance to coke deposition can be observed over PtInHTU-X after reaction from TG and O2-TPO results, especially catalyst PtInHTR-KF, which also inhibits the sintering of Pt. It is necessary to point that Pt-In catalysts modified by MgF2 are excellent and promising catalysts for the dehydrogenation reaction.
