The effect of the Ce content on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over CrOy-CeO2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts
Abstract
A series of CrOy (17.5 wt%)-CeO2 (X wt%)/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (X = 0, 0.5, 2, 5, 8) with various Ce contents were prepared by a wetness impregnation method and were applied to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene at 550 °C and 0.1 MPa. The prepared catalysts were characterized by BET, H2-TPR, O2-TPD, XPS, XRD, SEM-EDS and Raman spectroscopy. Among the prepared catalysts, the 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al catalyst with the largest amount of lattice oxygen exhibited the best catalytic performance for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with lattice oxygen. The decreased presence of oxygen defects and reducibility were the factors responsible for the improved dehydrogenation activity of the catalysts. The CeO2 layer could inhibit the evolution of lattice oxygen (O2−) to electrophilic oxygen species (O2−), and the oxygen defects on the catalyst surface were reduced. The inhibited lattice oxygen evolution prevented the deep oxidation of propane or propylene, the average COx selectivity decreased from 24.41% (17.5Cr/Al) to 5.71% (17.5Cr-2Ce/Al), and the average propylene selectivity increased from 60.15% (17.5Cr/Al) to 85.05% (17.5Cr-2Ce/Al).

1. Introduction
Propylene is an important raw chemical material with a large market size. The propylene demand will reach 1.54 million tons, but 1.2 million tons of propylene is produced in the world. Furthermore, it is estimated that the global requirement for propylene will grow by approximately 4.5% in 2020 [1]. In recent years, anaerobic dehydrogenation (industrialization has been achieved) and oxygen dehydrogenation (ODH) are the main methods of propane dehydrogenation. The main propane anaerobic dehydrogenation processes include the following [2]: 1) Oleflex technology; 2) Catofin dehydrogenation technology; and 3) the Uhde STAR process. The three propane dehydrogenation technologies have been compared and analyzed (from the Supporting Information). These three processes are endothermic dehydrogenation reactions and affected by thermodynamic equilibrium, resulting in low propane conversion. In addition, these three processes have high equipment and catalyst costs. Therefore, reducing the cost and improving the propane yield are the current research topics.
Compared with conventional anaerobic dehydrogenation, the reaction of the ODH process is exothermic and has a lower device and catalyst cost. The ODH process has huge potential for solving the equilibrium conversion limitation and low selectivity. Therefore, recently, the ODH of propane has been studied widely with numerous gas and solid oxidizing agents to tackle the aforementioned problems. Gas oxidants mainly include O2, Cl2 and CO2. Among these gas oxidants, CO2 was the most common choice because propane and propylene were not further oxidized by CO2 (whose appropriate ability could note further oxidize propane and propylene). Certain studies on the effect of CO2 in the ODH of propane over catalysts have been reported [3,4]. It is difficult to control the degree of the reaction, and the mechanism of the reaction is unknown, especially at low temperatures [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]].
Based on the aforementioned problems, studies on using metal oxides as lattice oxygen for ODH have attracted attention. Appropriate monometallic or polymetallic oxides can replace gaseous oxygen to achieve the slow release of lattice oxygen, so the reaction rate of propane dehydrogenation can be more effectively controlled than that of anaerobic dehydrogenation and that achieved using gas oxidizing agents.
ODH utilizes the migration and transformation of lattice oxygen from metal oxides, which act as oxygen carriers or redox catalysts to promote the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Transition metal solid oxide catalysts prepared from vanadium, gallium and iron have been used in propane dehydrogenation [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14]]. However, due to the rapid release rate of oxygen in metal oxides, the reaction depth is difficult to control, resulting in a high COx selectivity and the rapid deactivation of the catalyst [15]. At present, Cr with a mass fraction of 17.5% has been used in many studies [16]. After pre-screening, 17.5% Cr has the highest catalytic efficiency among all Cr-gradient-loaded catalysts. Cr-based catalysts have an excellent dehydrogenation performance for propane, but the lattice oxygen release rate is fast, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst activity. To improve and extend the activity of the catalyst, using CO2 to extend the Cr-based catalyst activity has been extensively investigated. Tetsuya et al. studied the effect of CO2 on the activity for the ODH of propane over Cr/Al2O3 [17]. The results showed that CO2 could provide active oxygen for the catalysts but inhibited the adsorption of propane, and the propylene yield was reduced. The propylene yield decreased by 15% after 120 min at 550 °C.
Therefore, loading other appropriate metal oxides on catalysts to control the rate of lattice oxygen released and regulate the migration or evolution of the lattice oxygen released from the catalyst surface was an excellent solution to reduce the selectivity of COx and extend the catalyst life. Li et al. used polymetallic composite catalysts (LaxSr2−xFeO4−δ) to dehydrogenate ethane to ethylene, and 51.6% ethylene yield were achieved (the ethylene yield was the highest yield achieved in the reported literature) [18]. Meanwhile, just a few studies have concentrated on the enhancement of CrOy by adding other metal oxides to improve the catalyst activity and prevent the deep oxidation of propane or propylene to COx. The release rate of lattice oxygen can be controlled effectively and the selective oxidation effect of propane can be produced only by choosing the appropriate metal or ratio of the metal to metal. Meanwhile, another metal oxide with a synergistic effect is difficult to find.
At present, CeO2 is mainly used for the treatment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) due to its excellent oxidation or partial oxidation. It has been reported that CeO2 can modify the transfer of lattice oxygen from adjacent metal oxide species due to its excellent redox properties [19,20]. However, few studies focused on improving propylene selectivity of Cr-based catalysts by adding CeO2 and preventing the deep oxidation of propane or propylene to COx.
Therefore, bimetallic oxides are used in this work to improve propylene selectivity. The synergistic effect of the CrOy and CeO2 catalyst on the ODH mechanism was investigated, and this catalyst was shown to be a promising candidate for industrial applications. In this work, we investigated the effect of adding varying Ce amounts to the Cr-based catalyst to improve the ODH capacity and physicochemical properties of the catalyst and determine the optimum content of Ce to enhance the propylene yield. A series of CrOy (17.5 wt%)-CeO2 (X wt%)/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (X = 0, 0.5, 2, 5, 8) were prepared for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using different reaction times. The purpose is to study the effect of the Ce content on CrOy, characterize the surface and structure of the mixed metal oxides, and further associate these characteristics with the catalyst performance for the ODH of propane.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
For the co-impregnation of Cr and Ce onto the γ-Al2O3 support, CrO3 (99.5%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) and Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (99.9%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) were dissolved simultaneously in deionized water (500 ml). Then, the calcined γ-Al2O3 was added to 600 ml of a HNO3 solution (5 wt%). The two mixed solutions were mixed in an oil bath at 80 °C until they formed a paste, which was dried in a drying box for 48 h at 120 °C. After that, the paste would be calcined for 6 h in a muffle furnace at 700 °C. Finally, the catalyst was crushed and sieved to obtain particle sizes in the range of 100–200 μm for our next test. During this process, the Cr content was 17.5 wt%, and the Ce content was adjusted to 5 wt%. Other catalysts were also prepared in a similar way (the detailed process used to prepare the catalyst is shown in the Supporting Information).
Moreover, the Supporting Information also shows the particle size distribution (D50 and D90) of the γ-Al2O3 support, 2Ce/Al and CrOy (17.5 wt%)-CeO2 (X wt%)/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (X = 0, 0.5, 2, 5, 8). The particle size was determined by a Rise 2002 laser particle size analyzer (Jinan Runzhi Technology Co., Ltd., Jinan, China). The particle size ranges of the five Cr-based catalysts are similar (100–200 μm), belonging to Geldert B particles. The minimum fluidization velocity is 6.6 × 10−3 m·s−1 at 500 °C by calculation [21]. In the experiment, the apparent gas velocity is 0.045 m·s−1 (6.8 times the minimum fluidization velocity), so the particles are in fluidization state. The added content of less than 2% Ce resulted in catalysts with smaller particle sizes and larger specific surface areas. Meanwhile, when the added content is more than 2% Ce, the opposite will happen.
2.2. Materials and methods
2.2.1. Dehydrogenation of propane to propylene
As shown in Fig. 1, this process consists of a fluidized bed reactor (20 mm × 960 mm) that includes an ODH reactor and air reactor. The catalyst (average particle size was 150 μm) was used in a fluidized bed reactor for the ODH of propane and can be recycled continuously in this system. Under a certain flow of air and at a certain temperature, the oxygen vacancies of the catalyst were refilled by the molecular oxygen in reactor to regenerate the catalyst after dehydrogenation experiment. During the reaction process, N2 was needed for the following functions: 1) The heat generated by the dehydrogenation reaction can be quickly removed by N2, which can prevent the local temperature from being too high to affect the dehydrogenation structure–activity of the catalyst. 2) The concentration of propane can be diluted by N2, which is conducive to controlling the reaction rate between the propane and catalyst.

Ten grams of the catalyst should be packed into the reactor before each experiment and then pre-treated under an N2 flow rate (300 ml·min−1) until the reaction temperature and the temperature of the preheating furnace was 450–550 °C. After the system reached the reaction temperature, the flow rate of N2 was decreased from 300 ml·min−1 to 150 ml·min−1, and the flow rate of propane was increased from 0 ml·min−1 to 150 ml·min−1. In the reaction process, the feed composition was fixed at C3H8:N2 = 150 ml:150 ml and the reaction pressure was 0.1 MPa. The reaction products were sequentially analyzed every 2 min with an on-line gas chromatograph (A91 plus, Panna) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID).
Catalytic oxidation experiment was conducted at 550 °C, the catalyst loading was 10 g, and five reaction times (6 min, 8 min, 10 min, 12 min, 14 min) were evaluated. All experiments were repeated three times to ensure the accuracy of the experimental results. The carbon mass balance closures, which considered only the CO, CO2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H8, C3H6 and coke on the catalyst, were within the ± 3% range. The total carbon that formed and was associated with the mass loss of the spent 17.5Cr/Al catalyst (i.e., a 14 min reaction time and 550 °C) was determined after calcination in a muffle furnace at 550 °C. The mass loss of the total carbon ranged from 2 wt% to 3 wt%.
Based on the conversion of propane and selectivity of the products, the performance of both catalysts for the ODH of propane was investigated. The propane conversion, selectivity of the carbon-containing products and propylene yield are defined as follows:

where ni is the number of moles of the gaseous carbon-containing products i, vi is the number of carbon atoms in the gaseous carbon-containing products i, and npropane is the number of moles of the untransformed propane in the product stream. In each experiment, the only identifiable carbon-containing products other than propylene were CO, CO2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4 and propane.
2.2.2. H2-TPR
The H2-TPR experiments can represent the oxygen capacity of a catalyst. The experiments were conducted using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 analyzer. For each experiment, 100 mg of the catalyst was pre-treated at 180 °C for 50 min using a 5% O2/N2 gas mixture with a flow rate of 50 ml·min−1. Then, the pre-treated catalyst was flushed with N2 under a 50 ml·min−1 flow rate for 1 h. Next, the N2 flow was replaced by the 5% H2/N2 gas mixture with a flow rate of 50 ml·min−1, while the catalyst was heated from 25 °C to 700 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C·min−1. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to monitor the hydrogen consumption in the outlet gas stream.
2.2.3. O2-TPD
The O2-TPD experiment was also conducted via the AutoChem II 2920 analyzer to investigate the oxygen uncoupling of the catalysts. 100 mg of the sample was pre-treated at 200 °C using He gas with a flow rate of 50 ml·min−1. Then, the sample as cooled to room temperature, and the catalyst was placed in an O2-TPD apparatus. Pure N2 (20 ml·min−1) was introduced at temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 700 °C with a heat rate of 10 °C·min−1.
2.2.4. Raman spectra
The Raman spectra were obtained at ambient conditions using a confocal Raman microscope (Renishaw, UK) with a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1. The samples were excited with the 514 nm line and a laser power of 4 mW (5% of the initial laser power). The spectra were recorded with an exposure time of 1 s and an accumulation number of 50, and an objective lens with a magnification of × 20 was used.

3.1.1. N2 adsorption–desorption
Fig. 2 displays the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the γ-Al2O3 support and all the catalysts. Table 1 reports the BET surface areas, single-point pore volume and average pore sizes of the samples with different cerium loadings. The surface area of γ-Al2O3 was found to be 113.79 m2·g−1. The surface area reduced to 61.68 m2·g−1 after the impregnation of the chromium species. In contrast, the surface area of 17.5Cr-0.5Ce/Al and 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al increased to 64.98 and 70.78 m2·g−1, respectively, by adding Ce species to the 17.5Cr/Al catalyst. When the Ce content is more than 2%, the surface area of the catalysts decreased with increasing Ce contents.

The pore volume and size of all the catalysts exhibited similar trends. The results show that the surface area and pore structure of the catalyst can be improved by adding a small amount of Ce to 17.5Cr/Al, making the active components distribute better on the surface of the catalyst. Meanwhile, the increase in the pore diameter is beneficial to the release of propylene. However, the formation of cerium oxide particles, surface area and pore volume of the catalysts reduced with increasing Ce contents.
3.1.2. XRD and SEM-EDS analyses of the catalysts
A series of CrOy (17.5 wt%)-CeO2 (X wt%)/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (X = 0, 0.5, 2, 5, 8) were tested by XRD from Fig. 3. Diffraction peaks corresponding to Cr2O3 phases were discovered from each samples. The diffraction peaks corresponding to CeO2 in all the catalysts (except the 17.5Cr/Al catalyst) were observed. In addition, with the increase in the Ce content, the intensity of the CeO2 diffraction peak was enhanced. CeO2 is present in the cubic fluorite phase, with characteristic reflections at approximately 28.8°, 33° and 47.5° (JCPDS 81-0792). Meanwhile, the peaks at 2θ = 33.6° and 36.2° correspond to the (104) and (110) planes of the rhombohedral Cr2O3 crystals (JCPDS 00-006-0504). No peaks corresponding to CrO3 were observed, which may be due to the poor crystallinity or high dispersion on the catalyst surface. Thus, further study in combination with Raman spectroscopy is needed. Furthermore, compared with the 2Ce/Al catalyst, the CeO2 on the surface of the 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al catalyst is more uniformly dispersed, and the peak area of the crystal is smaller due to the effect of the Cr species.

The morphological features of the four catalysts were investigated by SEM, as shown in Fig. 4. It has been reported that the interaction of a certain amount of Ce with other active components in the catalyst, the dispersion of Ce on the catalyst surface is more uniform, thus improving the reaction activity of the catalyst [22]. Similarly, the synergistic effect of 2% Ce and the Cr treatment strengthened the interaction between CeO2 and CrOy, which promotes the migration of the active phase particles. Accordingly, the uniform dispersion of CeO2 particles was achieved on the surface of the CrOy catalyst, as shown in Fig. 4(c). Meanwhile, with the increase in the Ce content, 5% Ce was agglomerated on the surface of the catalyst (Fig. 4(d)).

The results of XRD, SEM and BET show that the 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al catalyst is porous and has a high dispersion of CeO2 particles, which is helpful to improve the specific surface area of the catalyst. It is speculated that the performance of the catalyst is related to the dispersion of Ce. In addition, the larger average pore size is conducive to the desorption of propylene and the inhibition of the formation of deep oxidation products, such as COx. When the mass fraction of Ce is more than 2%, the CeO2 or CeOx crystals resulted in the low dispersion of Ce, which will lead to the transformation of propane or propylene into deep oxidation products at high temperatures.
To further investigate the distribution of Al and Cr, especially the Ce species, EDS analyses were conducted. Fig. 5 shows the EDS mapping images of the 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al and 17.5Cr-5Ce/Al catalysts. Each metal was distinguishable in the EDS mapping images and each metal species were dispersed uniformly on the surface of γ-Al2O3. It is noticeable that the Cr, Al and Ce species co-existed in the catalyst. The results indicate that the 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al and 17.5Cr-5Ce/Al catalysts and the other catalysts were prepared successfully. Compared with 5% Ce, treating the catalyst with chromium makes the distribution of 2% Ce more uniform and destroys the clusters formed at the edge and corner of the catalyst. The dispersion is excellent, and there is no impurity. Therefore, the interaction between CeO2 and CrOy is enhanced, and the catalytic performance is improved for the 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al catalyst.

3.1.3. Raman spectra of the catalysts
Fig. 6 shows that Raman spectra of all the catalysts. The Raman bands observed for the catalysts (17.5Cr/Al) at 856 cm−1 are assigned to υs(O–Cr–O), which may be assigned to the ‘isolated’ tetrahedral surface-mononuclear (CrVI) species that are distorted by the interaction with the support surface, while the bands at 550 cm−1 are characteristic of the crystalline Cr2O3 nanoparticles (CrocteIII ‐ O bonds). The Raman spectra of CeO2 contain a strong F2g band corresponding to the fluorite phase at 460 cm−1 (which is more intense in 17.5Cr-5Ce/Al and 17.5Cr-8Ce/Al) and weak bands at 600 cm−1 related to the defect-induced mode (D) [23]. These results agree with the XRD data. Note that the bands corresponding to mono- and dioxo Cr = O vibrations (at approximately 1000 cm−1) are not observed. For the 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al catalyst, the intensity of the CrVI-O and CrШ-O vibration peak at 856 cm−1 decreased or disappeared due to the coating effect of CeO2.

Fig. 6. Raman spectra for all the catalysts.
In comparison with the spectrum of 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al, the increased intensity of the bands attributed to oxygen vacancies at 460 and 550 cm−1 indicates the increase in the number of defects of the mixed oxide [24]. The increase in the number of oxygen vacancies in the mixed metal oxide catalysts can lead to increases in the propane or propylene total oxidation activity [25]. These results also agree with the XPS data in the subsequent discussion.
3.1.4. H2-TPR and O2-TPD
Because these catalysts release lattice oxygen and convert propane into hydrocarbons, CO and CO2, it is particularly important to understand the processes of lattice oxygen migration and transition in the catalyst surface. These processes were investigated by H2-TPR and O2-TPD methods.
H2-TPR was used to characterize the redox catalysts of reducibility and oxygen capacity. Fig. 7(a) shows which catalyst exhibits the highest reduction peak and which peaks were attributed to the reduction of the Cr6+ species in all the catalysts [16]. The reducibility of the catalyst varies with varying contents of Ce. Due to the addition of varying CeO2 contents to the 17.5Cr/Al catalyst, the reduction peak position of Cr was shifted obviously. The positions of the initial reduction peaks follow the order 17.5Cr/Al > 17.5Cr-8Ce/Al > 17.5Cr-5Ce/Al > 17.5Cr-0.5Ce/Al > 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al as the temperature decreases from left to right. These results clearly indicate that the addition of CeO2 promoters decreased the reducibility of the 17.5Cr/Al catalyst. When the mass fraction of Ce exceeded 2%, the reducibility of the catalysts decreased. The relationship between the reducibility of bulk oxygen and the ODH selectivity has been reported by Blasco et al. and Li et al. A lower reducibility generally corresponds to a higher propylene selectivity [26,27]. Table 2 reports the oxygen capacity of the catalysts. Although the reduction of the catalysts with H2 occurs by a surface reaction, the lattice oxygen removed during the reduction reaction was supplied from the bulk. As a Ce cation is enriched on the surface with Ce promotion, one could ascribe the decreased reducibility to the inhibition of lattice oxygen (O2−) conduction by the Ce-enriched surface.

O2-TPD (Fig. 7 (b)) was used to characterize the relative number of adsorbed oxygen species. Large peaks were observed for all the catalysts. The peak was related to weakly bound “surface” oxygen species. The peak intensities follow the sequence 17.5Cr/Al > 17.5Cr-8Ce/Al > 17.5Cr-8Ce/Al > 17.5Cr-0.5Ce/Al > 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al. This showed that the weakly bonded oxygen species were more significantly suppressed with the addition of CeO2 than in the 17.5Cr/Al catalyst. However, when the Ce content exceeds 2%, the inhibitory effect of the weakly bonded oxygen species is weakened. It has been reported that the abundance of such weakly bonded surface oxygen species led to deep oxidations [28,29]. The TPD results suggest that such an overlayer of CeO2 may serve as a barrier to inhibit the outward diffusion of O2− and its evolution into surface oxygen (electrophilic oxygen species). This was consistent with the observation of the O 1 s XPS spectra, XRD and BET of the all catalysts, whereas 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al had a better selectivity than the other catalysts, as described in the following discussion.
3.1.5. Elemental valence analysis performed with XPS
Fig. 8(a) shows the Ce 3d5/2 XPS spectra of the four catalysts. The Ce 3d5/2 spectra were deconvoluted into Ce3+ (882 eV and 885.8 eV) and Ce4+ (883.5 eV and 888.4 eV) species [30]. With the increase in the CeO2 content, the total areas of the Ce 3d5/2 peaks increased. When the content of Ce was 2%, the ratio of Ce4+ and Ce3+ achieved was the largest (2.08) (from the Supporting Information). Meanwhile, when the mass fraction of Ce is 8%, the proportion of tetravalent cerium of all the cerium content is lower, which is 0.45. It was revealed that the Ce4+ species content and Ce3+ ratio increases, which follow the sequence 17.5Cr-8Ce/Al < 17.5Cr-5Ce/Al < 17.5Cr-0.5Ce/Al < 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al. In addition, the variation trend of the Ce4+ and Ce3+ ratio was consistent with that of the oxygen capacity of the catalysts. When the mass fraction of Ce exceeds 2%, the content of Ce3+ increased, while the content of Ce4+ decreased. However, lattice oxygen (O2−) only exists in CeO2 and does not exist in the Ce3+ species. When excess oxygen species of the cerium oxide were added to the Cr-based catalyst, these oxygen species transformed into electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O2, O2−, and O−), resulting in the deep oxidation of propane or propylene to COx. These results were also consistent with the experimental observations. 17.5Cr-8Ce/Al exhibited a poor selectivity, while 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al exhibited a significant increase in the propylene selectivity.

Fig. 8. Ce 3d5/2 (a) and O 1s (b) XPS spectra of all the catalysts.
The ODH activity is strongly influenced by the binding energy of lattice oxygen. While the oxygen that reacts by ODH is provided from the bulk (mixed) metal oxide, the propylene selectivity is often modified by the surface. Therefore, it is important to obtain surface information from O 1s XPS spectra.
Fig. 8(b) shows the O 1s spectra of the all catalysts. One of the major peaks at 531.4 eV was assigned to hydroxide and carbonate species [18]. The other two peaks (530.5 eV and 532.6 eV) are assigned to the lattice oxygen species of Cr2O3 and CrO3 [31,32]. The peak that appeared at approximately 529.6 eV is assigned to the lattice oxygen species of CeO2. The XPS patterns obtained for lattice oxygen with different Ce contents have changed significantly, as shown by Fig. 8(b). The ratio of the lattice oxygen species content in CeO2 to the catalyst is 29.67% (17.5Cr-0.5Ce/Al), 33.55% (17.5Cr-2Ce/Al), 28.44% (17.5Cr-5Ce/Al) and 21.69% (17.5Cr-8Ce/Al). The lattice oxygen ratio of CeO2 in the 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al catalyst is the highest. This is because the CeIV species account for the largest proportion of all the cerium in the catalysts.
The binding energy region between 529 and 530 eV and 532–533 eV is expressed as Oα with lattice oxygen properties, and the region of 530–532 eV (Oβ) is usually designated as oxygen defect properties [33]. The date in Table 3 was obtained from XPS peak splitting calculation of oxygen species contained in Ce and Cr (from Fig. 8(b)). The relative content of lattice oxygen and electrophilic oxygen was calculated according to the peak proportion (the total area of all oxygen species is 100%). It has been reported that these defective oxygen species increase the activity of catalysts for propane or propylene oxidation [34]. The relative contents of the two kinds of oxygen are calculated in Table 3. Propane or propylene oxidation occurs through the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, so the degree to which lattice oxygen can increase from the mixed metal oxide is critical [35]. This is controlled by the surface oxygen species, vacancies and other defects on the surface of the mixed metal oxide lattice and, to an extent, the concentration of Ce4+ [36]. The relative concentration of Oβ on the surface is significantly related to the oxidation activity of propane or propylene. The oxidation activity of propane or propylene strengthened with the increase in the oxygen defect concentration on the catalyst surface [37]. This finding was consistent with the observation that the CO x selectivity of the catalysts changed, as described in the subsequent discussion.

Fig. 9. Performance of all the catalysts for the ODH of propane at 550 °C.
Fig. 9(a) describes the effect of the reaction time on the propane conversion for all the catalysts. Because lattice oxygen was consumed by all the catalysts, the propane conversions decreased with increasing reaction times. The average propane conversion achieved by 17.5Cr-0.5Ce/Al, 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al, 17.5Cr-5Ce/Al and 17.5Cr-8Ce/Al was 17.5%, 22.9%, 18.5% and 21.4%, respectively, at 6–14 min. The data indicate that the conversion of propane increased with an increase in the Ce loading, and a maximum conversion was reached for the catalyst containing 2 wt% Ce. Due to the layer of CeO2, CrOy and propane cannot fully contact one another, resulting in low propane conversion. Further increasing the Ce loading increased the propane conversion. This can be explained by CeOx aggregation or the CeO2 crystals. A low dispersion of Ce species will lead to the transformation of the reactants or target products to deep oxidation products.
It has been reported that two types of active oxygen species are present in the catalyst surface: electrophilic oxygen forms (O2, O2−, and O−), which have been proven to achieve the deep oxidation of propane or propylene, and nucleophilic lattice oxygen ions (O2−), which have been claimed to prefer the selectivity of propylene [38]. In addition, Tench et al. and Bonnelle et al. studied the oxygen species on the surface of the catalyst, which could have different bonding strengths and electronic properties [[39], [40], [41]]. Therefore, different types of oxygen species could form on the catalyst surface, thereby altering selectivity for the ODH products. The selective pathway towards propylene is preferred over that for combustion and COx formation due to the lower availability of lattice oxygen. Compared with the propane conversion and propylene yield, the propylene selectivity always increased with increasing reaction times (Fig. 9(b)). The reduction degree of the catalyst improves the selectivity of propylene during the ODH of propane using metal oxide as a source of oxygen [12]. Therefore, a higher reduction degree of the catalyst leads to the improvement in the propylene selectivity with increasing reaction times. Compared with the other catalysts, the 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al catalyst decreased the reducibility to the inhibition of the lattice oxygen (O2−) conversion to electrophilic oxygen species by the CeO2 surface layer (Fig. 7). Therefore, a lower reducibility generally corresponds to a higher propylene selectivity. In addition, the changes in propylene selectivity of 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al catalyst are the smallest after 14 min. It indicates that the lattice oxygen was released from catalyst is slower than that of other catalysts due to the inhibition of CeO2 layer, which is helpful to prolong the life of catalyst.
3.3. Catalyst performance for COx selectivity
Fig. 10 shows the change in the selectivity of all the catalysts for COx at different reaction times. The COx selectivity of 17.5Cr/Al is higher than that of the other catalysts. The average COx selectivity of Cr/Al, Cr-0.5Ce/Al, Cr-2Ce/Al, Cr-5Ce/Al, Cr-8Ce/Al and 2Ce/Al was 24.41%, 7.42%, 5.71%, 14.54%, 19.47% and 51.04%, respectively, from 6 to 14 min. The results were consistent with the XPS observations. In addition, the lack of Cr oxide species in the 2Ce/Al catalyst only plays a role in propane combustion, resulting in the low selectivity towards propylene, and most of the propane is converted into COx, indicating that the yield of propylene can be increased only when Cr and Ce interrelated and interact with each other.

Fig. 10. Influence of the reaction time on the COx selectivity over all the catalysts at 550 °C.
In the ODH process, there is an external oxygen source in the reactor, and the oxygen of COx can only come from the oxygen species of the catalyst. This indicated that the lattice oxygen released by the catalyst was finite, and the lattice oxygen is available at higher extents of reduction and longer reaction times. It favor a higher propylene selectivity. Moreover, the increased content of Ce3+ accordingly implies an increase in the surface oxygen vacancy defects, which resulted from the deep oxidation of propane or propylene and improves the selectivity of COx [37].
3.4. Reaction mechanism of converting propane to propylene
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on CrOy catalyst follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism [42,43]. According to the first step of this mechanism, the reduction of CrOy is initiated by the reaction of adsorbing propane and lattice oxygen. The ODH reaction mechanism of propane on the Cr/Ce-Al2O3 catalyst is shown in Fig. 11. The cleavage of the first C-H bond of propane occurred; a propyl radical and hydroxyl atom were separately adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst. The CrVI species are reduced, which is called the rate limiting step. The lattice oxygen contained the in CrVI species plays an important role. The final product distribution depends on the number of acid sites on the catalyst surface. The γ hydrogen abstraction of propoxide generates propylene (more basic sites), while the α hydrogen abstraction leads to the formation of a non-stable aldehyde and goes further to react and form CO, CO2 and C2H6 (more acid sites). The increase in the number of Bronsted acid sites results in more α hydrogen being replaced and more COx being produced. For the 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al catalyst, the number of acid sites on the surface of the catalyst decreased due to the high dispersion and coverage of CeO2, but with the increase in the Ce content, the formation of CeOx aggregate crystals and its low dispersion led to the increase in the number of acid sites on the surface of the catalyst (from the Supporting Information). Chromium oxide without lattice oxygen is oxidized again in an air reactor. Molecular oxygen in the air fills the oxygen vacancy and restores the lattice oxygen in chromium oxide [44,45].

3.5. ODH cycles for 17.5Cr/Al and 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al catalysts
In this study, ten cycles of reaction-regeneration for the process of propane ODH were conducted at 550 °C. with both catalysts in this study. As shown in Fig. 12, the propane conversions, propylene selectivity and COx selectivity of both catalysts remain stable with the following trends:
a)

b)
The average propylene selectivity of 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al remains at 84.44%, higher than the value of 62.19% for 17.5Cr/Al.
c)
The average COx selectivity of 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al remains at 6.59%, lower than the value of 24.27% for 17.5Cr/Al.

The ODH cycles showed that the 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al catalyst has high stability and may be suitable for the industrial production of propylene.
4. Conclusions
This work investigated the effect of the addition of CeO2 to the CrOy/γ-Al2O3 redox catalysts for propane ODH. We prepared different Ce content gradients catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The results are as follows:
a)
The 17.5Cr-2Ce/Al catalyst has a higher oxygen capacity, larger surface area and lower surface concentration of oxygen defects than the other catalysts, as characterized by the H2-TPR, BET and XPS analyses.
b)
The experimental results suggest that a certain amount of a CeO2 overlayer may serve as a barrier to inhibit the outward diffusion of lattice oxygen and its evolution into surface oxygen (electrophilic oxygen species).
c)
Compared with 17.5Cr/Al, the CrOy/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with added CeO2 can improve the average propylene selectivity from 60.15% (17.5Cr/Al) to 85.05% (17.5Cr-2Ce/Al), and the average COx selectivity decreased from 24.41% (17.5Cr/Al) to 5.71% (17.5Cr-2Ce/Al).
