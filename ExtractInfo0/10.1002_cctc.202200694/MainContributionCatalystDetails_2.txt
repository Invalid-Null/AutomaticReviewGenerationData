 Unfortunately, the document does not seem to discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document examines the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in general, including both catalytic and non-catalytic gas-phase reactions. It does not focus on a particular catalyst or enhancement of catalytic performance. Since the criteria outlined are not met, I will output that the document is not relevant.
