 Unfortunately the document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) to produce propylene, but does not focus on any specific catalyst. It mainly examines gas phase oxidative pyrolysis reactions and their contribution to ODP performance. Since a catalyst is not the main scientific contribution, I cannot extract the requested catalyst details.
