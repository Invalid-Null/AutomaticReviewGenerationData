Iron–calcium–hydroxyapatite catalysts: Iron speciation and comparative performances in butan-2-ol conversion and propane oxidative dehydrogenation
Abstract
Iron/calcium–hydroxyapatite catalysts containing different amounts of iron – Fe(x)/CaHAp – were prepared by cation exchange in aqueous media and characterized by XRD, IR, UV–vis, Mössbauer, XPS spectroscopies and temperature programmed reduction (TPR). The iron was found in the samples exclusively as isolated Fe3+ species distributed in CaHAp between distorted octahedral and lower coordination sites.
These catalysts were tested in butan-2-ol conversion with and without oxygen in the reaction mixture. The increase of iron content enhanced the acid properties of the catalysts and the butan-2-ol dehydration (butenes yield around 55%) in the presence of O2. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), they exhibit good propene selectivity (35–90%) but with limited conversion. The maximum propene yield (6.2%) is obtained at low Fe content whereas the dehydrogenation of butan-2-ol into methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) in the presence of dioxygen is much higher on pure CaHAp than on Fe(x)/CaHAp. The sites generated at low Fe content were identified as Fe3+–O–Ca2+ species. Those sites, contrarily to Fe3+–O–Fe3+ which appear at high iron loadings, provide a reasonable performance in propane ODH, most likely because they maintain the needed basicity for the hydrogen abstraction from the propane. This confirms the essential role played by the acid–base properties in the dehydrogenation processes.

1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of C2–C3 alkanes has for several decades called attention as an alternative to the pyrolysis process [1] because they are abundant, cheap and environmentally non-aggressive.
To overcome catalyst deactivation and limited conversion inherent to endothermic dehydrogenation (without oxygen), extensive work has been performed on catalytic oxydehydrogenation (ODH) and selective oxidation [2], [3], [4], [5]. However, in these oxidative routes, selectivity drops upon increasing conversion. Despite numerous attempts, no catalyst has been shown to give ethene and propylene comparable yields to that achieved with the pyrolysis process. The catalysts investigated have been mainly based on transition metal ions (TMI) as (i) supported oxides, either reducible or non-reducible [4], [5], (ii) nanostructured oxides [6] or (iii) isolated species [7].
The previously proposed mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over reducible metal oxide catalysts are essentially based on the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism which involves the breaking of C–H bond and the participation of lattice oxygen [8]. This category of catalysts often bears a double-bond between the exchangeable oxygen atoms and the transition metal, like in vanadium and molybdenum oxides. However, despite the convenience of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, it does not correctly explain the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over the catalysts that do not contain conventional rapid redox couples such as FeZSM-5 zeolite, CoxMg3−x(PO4)2 or carbon nanofibers supported phosphoric acid [9], [10], [11], [12]. The performances of these catalysts are not as good as those achieved with vanadium and molybdenum oxides, but they show competitive selectivities. Their activity is attributed either to the acid–base properties of the carrier and/or to isolated cations capable of activating the methylene C–H bonds [7].
The role of acid–base properties of the support and the nature of its interactions with the catalyst has been recognized for many years [13]. Therefore, the use of carriers with adjustable acid–base characteristics such as calcium–hydroxyapatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 – in short CaHAp – is important. In addition, the high stability and the various substitutions allowed by the apatites network confer them a diversity of uses [14], [15]. CaHAp is the primary inorganic constituent of bones and teeth enamel. It is also utilized in the synthesis of bioceramics, and many fields other than heterogeneous catalysis [16], [17], [18].
The catalytic performances of transition metals loaded calcium–hydroxyapatites have attracted attention in the last years, especially in the ODH of ligth alkanes [7], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], dry reforming of methane [25], decomposition of C3–C4 alcohols [26] and propanone condensation [27]. The OH groups which lie within the tunnels of the phosphate framework intervene in the formation of the active oxygen species which are essential for the ODH process [24]. CaHAp also has the ability to exchange the Ca2+ ions of its network with transition metal cations [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. In the case of trivalent cations [22], [28], the extent of this Ca2+/M3+ exchange depends on the charge of the M(III) species predominent in solution. Moreover, it was observed that the Ca2+/Mn+ exchange modifies acid–base features of the surface.
The present work is devoted to the study of the catalytic properties of Fe3+-loaded CaHAp prepared by exchange of Ca2+ with different amounts of Fe3+. This system was mainly chosen because iron-containing phosphates are known to exhibit high selectivity for various dehydrogenation reactions [29], [30]. Fe(x)/CaHAp was characterized with several surface and bulk techniques including XRD, IR, UV–vis–NIR, Mössbauer, XPS spectroscopies and temperature programmed reduction (TPR). The basic features of CaHAp and their modification by the iron incorporation were investigated using butan-2-ol conversion as a probe reaction. As far as we know, this was the first time that the catalytic performances of Fe(x)/CaHAp in propane ODH were determined and compared with those obtained in the oxidative dehydrogenation of butan-2-ol.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of CaHAp and Fe(x)/CaHAp
CaHAp was prepared using the following precipitation method: an ammoniacal solution of (NH4)2HPO4 (m = 7.92 g dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water + 70 ml of 25% aqueous ammoniac) was poured into a second solution of calcium nitrate (23.6 g in 100 mL) while stirring at 80 °C. The pH was maintained at 9 during mixing. After the dropwise addition (1 h), the mixture was kept at 80 °C for 24 h. The chemical reaction involved in the synthesis is:
6HPO42− + 10Ca2+ + 8OH− → Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 6H2O
The solid recovered by filtration was washed with hot water and dried in air at 120 °C.
The Fe(x)/CaHAp catalysts were prepared by the ion-exchange method. A fixed mass of carrier was introduced in a solution of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and the resulting suspension was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. The solid obtained after filtration was washed with hot water before being dried at 80 °C and calcined in air at 550 °C for 12 h. Different loadings were obtained by varying the initial iron precursor concentration. The samples are labelled as Fe(x)/CaHAp, where x (expressed in wt.%) represents the weight percentage of iron in the catalyst.
2.2. Characterization
Chemical analysis was carried out at the central services of analysis (CNRST-Rabat and CNRS, Solaize, France) by inductive coupling plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES).
X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained with a Siemens D5000 high-resolution diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation. The data were collected at room temperature with a 0.02° step size in 2θ, from 2θ = 20° to 80°. The crystalline phases were identified by comparison with ICSD reference files.
The BET specific surface area of the samples evacuated at 300 °C was determined by equilibrium adsorption and desorption isotherms of N2 at 77 K with a Coulter Omnisorp 100 CX apparatus.
FTIR transmission spectra were recorded between 400 and 4000 cm−1 at room temperature on a Bruker Equinox 55 spectrometer using self-supporting KBr disks. This technique, very sensitive to the presence of carbonates and pyrophosphates, was used to provide information about the apatite purity and modifications while exchanging Ca2+ by Fe3+ ions.
UV–vis–NIR diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded at room temperature between 190 and 2500 nm on a Varian Cary 5E spectrometer equipped with a double monochromator and an integrating sphere coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). PTFE was also used as a reference.
X-ray photoelectron spectra were recorded on a VG Scientific ESCALAB 200A spectrometer utilizing a non-monochromatized Mg Kα radiation (1253.6 eV). The spectra were digitized, summed, smoothed and reconstructed using Gauss-Lorentzian components. In order to minimize charge effects, the measurements were carried out on thin pellets placed on an indium plaque. The carbon C 1s peak at 285 eV was used as reference.
57Fe Mössbauer spectra were recorded using a 57Co/Rh γ-ray source mounted on an electromagnetic drive and using a triangular velocity form. They were obtained at 300 K. The spectra were analyzed by least-squares fitting to a Lorentzian function. The isomer shifts (IS) were referred to α-Fe at 300 K. The samples were prepared by dispersing around 100 mg of the products in a specific resin.
Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments [31] were performed with an apparatus equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a U-shaped quartz reactor operated at atmospheric pressure and loaded with 10–50 mg of the catalyst sieved to a grain size ranging from 120 to 180 μm. Special attention was paid to the experimental conditions in order to avoid the recording of artefacts [32]. The reaction mixture was composed of 10 vol.% of H2 and 90 vol.% of argon in a total flow rate of 40 cm3 min−1. The temperature of reaction was increased from room temperature up to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Analyses of the effluent gases were performed using a TCD.
2.3. Catalytic tests
2.3.1. Butan-2-ol conversion
Butan-2-ol conversion was used as a probe reaction to investigate acid–base properties and redox features of the catalysts. In the absence of oxygen, the reaction produces butenes by dehydration over Brönsted acid sites and methyl ethyl ketone by dehydrogenation over basic sites [33]. In the presence of oxygen, the dehydrogenation into methyl ethyl ketone theoretically takes place over redox sites, generally via a Mars-van Krevelen type mechanism. However, this mechanism is efficient only if the catalyst contains a reducible metal oxide or bears an MO double bond between a transition metal in high oxidation state and oxygen [34]. The protonation of this transferable oxygen creates Brönsted acid sites and, in some cases, causes enhancement of the dehydration reaction upon oxygen addition to the reaction mixture. This improvement of dehydration at the expense of dehydrogenation is also revealed by the modification of selectivity resulting from the catalyst ability to transfer the involved oxygen [35].
The catalytic tests were carried out in a Pyrex microreactor at temperatures ranging from 100 to 240 °C. Prior to the tests, the catalyst (20–50 mg) was treated at 550 °C under 60 cm3 min−1 of air then cooled to the reaction temperature. Butan-2-ol (12.5 mm Hg = 1667 Pa) was provided to the reactor by a saturator maintained at a fixed temperature and fed with pure N2 or air. The reaction products were analysed using two on-line chromatographs: one operating with a 2 m column packed with Chromosorb PAW coated with 15% of carbowax 1500 and a FID detector for alcohol and methyl ethyl ketone separation, and the other equipped with a silica gel column and TCD for COx.
2.3.2. Propane ODH
Propane ODH was performed in U-shaped, quartz fixed bed microreactor operated at atmospheric pressure. The reactor has a length of 15 cm and its external and internal diameters are equal to 6 and 5 mm, respectively. The catalyst (50 mg) sieved to a grain size ranging from 0.125 to 0.180 mm was maintained in the reactor between two quartz wool plugs. The void volume located before and after the catalyst bed was filled with quartz bits in order to homogenize the temperature of the reaction mixture which is constituted of 6 vol.% of propane, 3 vol.% of oxygen and 91 vol.% of nitrogen at a total flow rate of 60 cm3 min−1. The catalyst was heated under pure nitrogen up to the selected reaction temperature before the introduction of the feeding mixture into the reactor. Products analyses were performed using two on-line chromatographs: one equipped with a Porapak Q column and a FID for hydrocarbons and the other equipped with a silica gel column and catharometers for COx. The carbon balance was close to 5% in all the catalytic tests performed.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Chemical analysis and specific surface area
The chemical composition of Fe(x)/CaHAp samples depends on two parameters which are strongly related to the pH of the precursor metal solution: (i) the partial dissolution–precipitation of the apatite in the precursor metal solution, (ii) the nature of the predominant metal species. The pH of the Fe3+ precursor solution is about 2.3 which means that the predominant iron species in the solution are not [Fe(H2O)6]3+ but [Fe(H2O)5(OH)]2+. These later Fe species can be exchanged with Ca2+ ions without charge compensation [28]. However, since the calcination stage will generate Fe3+ cations, the charge balance will be adjusted by the removal of protons as suggested by IR spectroscopy (see Section 3.4). On the other hand, it is relevant to note (Table 1) that the sum of Ca and Fe atomic percentages is not constant for all the samples; it decreases from 0.934 for iron-free CaHAp to about 0.90 for iron-loaded samples. This indicates that there is a slight dissolution of apatite upon its contact with the acid iron solution.

The chemical analyses (Table 1) show that the Ca/P atomic ratio of the synthesized hydroxyapatite is around 1.62 instead of 1.67, indicating a slight calcium deficiency [36]. It also contains carbonates (see Section 3.4) resulting from adsorption of atmospheric CO2, which is confirmed by the relatively high XPS carbon content. Moreover, the contact of apatite with the iron precursor solution followed by drying and calcination leads to a decrease of the Ca/P ratio, which confirms that calcium ions were replaced by iron ions (Table 1).
On the other hand, the specific surface area of Fe(x)/CaHAp samples increases with the iron content, probably because the apatite undergoes a dissolution-precipitation phenomenon as suggested above. No traces of iron were found in the analysis of the solutions recovered after the filtration, confirming its complete fixation by the apatite.
In addition, the Fe content measured by XPS increased linearly with the total Fe content determined by ICP (Fig. 1), suggesting that all Fe ions are located on the surface or in its vicinity.

3.2. X-ray diffraction
X-ray diffraction patterns of CaHAp and Fe(x)/CaHAp (not shown) are similar. No peak of crystalline iron oxides was detected in the diffractograms even for the highest Fe loadings (x = 5.40).
3.3. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
According to TEM pictures (Fig. 2A), pure hydroxyapatite contains rod-like particles with a mean size around 40–50 nm. The pictures of CaHAp and of the Fe-richest sample, Fe(5.40)/CaHAp (Fig. 2A and B), are quite similar, probably because no formation Fe oxide was detected, confirming that all the Fe3+ ions have been exchanged.

3.4. Infrared spectroscopy
The CaHAp spectrum presents several bands (Fig. 3), which are summarized with their attributions in Table 2 [37], [38]. The spectra of Fe(x)/CaHAp samples are similar to that of CaHAp except for a decrease of the intensity of ν(OH) stretching at 3570 cm−1, of the OH liberation at 630 cm−1 and of the P–OH band around 875 cm−1 (see Table 2). This decrease is often observed when a cation exchange is performed in the apatite. It can be attributed to the substitution of Ca2+ by Fe3+, which provokes the elimination of the protons of the OH hydroxyls located in the apatite tunnels in order to counterbalance the electric excess due to the incorporation of Fe3+ ions. Therefore, the nominal composition of Fe exchanged apatite could be written as Ca10−xFex3+(PO4)6(OH)2−xOx. The remaining O2− oxygen species (in the tunnels) probably tend to play a major role in the catalytic activity [39], [40].

The IR spectra also show that the samples contain carbonates introduced by the adsorption of atmospheric CO2. However, they do not contain pyrophosphates, since the bands assigned to stretching modes of P2O74− (1165, 1124 and 757 cm−1) are not visible on the spectra.
3.5. UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy
To our knowledge, no UV–vis–NIR study of the Fe/CaHAp system has been published. The spectra displayed in Fig. 4 show that iron is present in the samples as high spin Fe3+ species in a d5 configuration in agreement with the Mössbauer results (see below, Section 3.7). The crystal field transitions of high spin the Fe3+ species are spin forbidden; therefore, if they appear, they are necessarily of very low intensity and partially covered by charge transfer (CT) transitions. Relevant reference spectra may be found in (i) aqueous solution of Fe3+ where [Fe(H2O)6]3+ species are predominant at low pH [41], [42], [43], [44], (ii) oxide crystals such as beryls or garnets [45], [46].

Fig. 4. UV–vis–NIR spectra of CaHAp and Fe(x)/CaHAp samples calcined in air at 550 °C. The spectrum of a Fe3+ solution is also shown.
Octahedral high spin Fe(H2O)3+ species give (i) spin forbidden d-d transitions from 6A1g to 4T1g, 4T2g, 4A1g, 4Eg, respectively at around 800 nm (12,600 cm−1), 540 nm (18,500 cm−1) and 411 nm (24,300 cm−1), (ii) an O2− → Fe3+ charge transfer near 240 nm (42,000 cm−1). In aqueous solution, the spin-forbidden transitions are not resolved and only a broad band appearing around 820 nm is separated from the CT transitions (Fig. 4). In beryl crystals [45], the spin-forbidden bands are recorded near 810 nm (12,300 cm−1), 435–425 nm (23,500 cm−1), 370 nm (27,000 cm−1), whereas CT appear around 270 nm (37,000 cm−1) and 240 nm (42,000 cm−1).
The UV–vis–NIR spectra of CaHAp and Fe(x)/CaHAp samples are displayed in Fig. 4. The spectrum of CaHAp presents the following: (i) in the NIR region several bands due to overtones and combinations of ν(OH) vibrations of free and bonded OH hydroxyls: the bands at 1385 cm−1 and 1430 cm−1 are attributed to 2ν(OH) overtones and the bands around 1930 and 2230 cm−1 to combinations of ν(OH) and δ(OH) [19], [22], (ii) in the UV–vis domain a band at 205–210 cm−1 assigned to O2− → Ca2+ charge transfer.
All Fe(x)/CaHAp samples exhibit additional bands: (i) at 290 nm assigned to a O2− → Fe3+ charge transfer, (ii) at 475 nm (shoulder) and (iii) around 890 nm (broad band) ascribed to some of the crystal field spin forbidden bands of Fe3+ in octahedral oxygen environment, cited above. The unusual intensity of the shoulder at 475 nm may be ascribed to an “intensity stealing” mechanism [43]. Indeed, as most Fe3+ ions are located on the surface, the symmetry is distorted and the Laporte rule partially relaxed. It is also worthy to note that as the Fe loading is increased the intensity of the three bands (290, 475 and 890 nm) amplifies. This increase and specially that of the bands located in the visible and near-infrared regions (475 and 890 nm) suggest that for loadings above x = 0.52 wt.%, the iron probably agglomerates and forms amorphous oxidized species.
3.6. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
The chemical composition (O 1s, P2p, Fe2p, C 1s, and Ca 2p) of the upper layers, determined by XPS, is presented in Table 3. On iron-free CaHAp, the surface Ca/P ratio (1.45) is lower than the bulk stoichiometric ratio (1.67) but close to that reported by Lu et al. (1.46) [47]. Conversely, the O/Ca value (2.43) is significantly lower than the ratio measured by the same authors (2.76). This difference might be due to the presence of carbonates. On the Fe(x)/CaHAp samples, the decrease of Ca concentration increases the O/Ca ratio and diminishes the Ca/P ratio. The spectra of Fe(x)/CaHAp samples (not displayed) show two main peaks around 711–711.5 eV and 724.5–725 eV, ascribed to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 of high spin Fe3+, respectively (Table 4).

The peak intensity increases with the Fe content (not shown). The value of ΔE (BE 2p3/2 − BE 2p1/2) is about 13.2–13.3 eV. These values corroborate those reported for alumina-supported Fe2O3 [55], silicate glasses [56], supported FePO4 [57], Fe2O3 and FeOOH which contain only octahedral Fe3+ [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54]. The FWHM values are rather high and located between 3.0 and 5.6 eV. Several reasons might explain this: (i) the presence of a satellite near 718–719 eV, (ii) the multiplet splitting, (iii) the decrease of the coordination and the diminution of crystal field energy of the Fe3+ ions located at the surface in comparison with those sited in the subsurface or the bulk. The latter contribution should be significant since the Fe3+ ions are isolated (fixation via ion-exchange). The presence of Fe2+ ions, which is another reason of broadening, can be discarded considering the UV–vis and Mössbauer data. In addition, iron is fixed on the apatite as Fe3+ species before calcination in air and the reduction to Fe2+ species is quite improbable. Finally the BE of the Fe 3p peak lies in the range of Fe3+ species (>55.5 eV), which confirms the absence of Fe2+ (BE Fe3p ≈ 53.5 eV) [56].
As noted in Section 3.1, the Fe content measured by XPS increased with the total Fe content determined by ICP (Fig. 1) suggesting that all Fe ions are located on the surface or in its vicinity.
An attempt to decompose the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks of the Fe-richest sample indicates the presence of several Fe3+ species and several satellites (Fig. 5). As pointed out by Grosvenor et al. [50], the surface Fe3+ ions are surrounded by a lower electron density and more energy is needed to produce a photoelectron. The peak around 715 eV may be ascribed to these surface Fe3+ species. The Fe3+ ions present in the sublayers (it should be recalled that the samples are calcined at 550 °C) are responsible for the main peak located about 711 eV and for the satellite near 718 eV. Similar comments may be made concerning the 2p1/2 peak (main peak at 724.5 eV, surface peak around 728 eV, satellite near 730.7 eV).

3.7. Mössbauer spectroscopy
Mössbauer spectroscopy has been largely used to characterize the iron oxidation state and environment in various solids, including supported iron catalysts. No study is available in the literature concerning iron-apatite catalysts but useful references may be found in silicate glasses [57], [58], phosphate glasses [59] and supported FePO4 catalysts [60]. The Mössbauer spectra of Fe(4.76)/CaHAp and Fe(5.40)/CaHAp recorded at 300 K exhibit a quadrupolar doublet with two broad absorption peaks (Fig. 6). The quadrupolar structure, instead of sextets, attests the absence of magnetic degeneracy and is attributed to the presence of isolated (paramagnetic) high spin Fe3+ ions. The deconvolution indicates the presence of two types of sites with values of the isomer shift δ (0.35–0.39 mm/s−1) intermediate between four- and six-coordinated Fe3+ (Table 5). The δ values, indeed, range between 0.28 and 0.35 mm/s in four-coordinated Fe3+ and 0.40–0.45 mm/s in an octahedral environment [52], [53], [54]. Taking into account that all Fe3+ ions are located near or on the surface (according to XPS data), the sites can be identified to distorted octahedral environment and sites of lower coordination (4 and 5).

3.8. Temperature programmed reduction
It is well known that the reduction of bulk iron oxide proceeds through the following steps [61]:
Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe
As emphasized by the discrepancy of the data reported in the literature, the reduction of this sequence of iron oxides depends on several parameters such as the preparation method, the size of the particles, the nature of the interactions with the carrier and the reducing atmosphere [61]. The Wüstite (FeO) phase is thermodynamically metastable and is hard to detect during the reduction process of hematite (Fe3O4). To our knowledge, no study of reducibility of Fe(x)/CaHAp was reported in the literature despite the fact that iron is an excellent catalyst of ammonia and Fischer–Tropsch syntheses.
The temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) data of Fe(x)/CaHAp are presented in Fig. 7. At low Fe content (x = 0.52, Fig. 8A), one peak appears at 761 °C. Upon increasing the Fe content to 1.29 and 2.60, this peak is shifted towards lower temperatures (678 and 628 °C, respectively). The small peak located in the 400–500 °C range may be ascribed to the reduction of surface carbonates. Finally, for x = 3.71 and 5.40, the profile becomes quite different. It is composed of two overlapping peaks near 569–690 °C and 476–556 °C, respectively. The H2/Fe associated ratio with x = 0.52, 1.29 and 2.75 is close to 0.6, suggesting that the loaded Fe3+ ions are only reduced into Fe2+. For x = 3.71 and 5.40, the global H2/Fe ratio is also close to 0.5, indicating that the reduction of Fe3+ never exceeds Fe2+. Moreover, the significant peak downshift (about 100 °C) induced by the increase of Fe loading, may be attributed to the heterogeneous distribution of the reducible metal on the surface of the carrier [29]. Quantitatively, the peak integration indicates that all loaded Fe3+ are reduced into Fe2+ during the TPR experiments.

3.9. Overview of characterization data
Fe3+ species were exchanged in the apatite with calcium ions as Fe(OH)(H2O)52+ species. Subsequent calcination of the catalysts resulted in the formation of isolated paramagnetic Fe3+ entities accompanied, as shown by IR spectroscopy, by the removal of protons of the OH hydroxyls hosted by the apatite tunnels. These Fe3+ ions take place on the catalyst surface or in its vicinity (XPS). They are located in two types of sites, which were identified to distorted octahedra and sites of lower coordination (4 or 5). The reduction by dihydrogen of those Fe3+ species is limited to Fe2+.
3.10. Butan-2-ol conversion
Fig. 8 displays the variations of butan-2-ol conversion at stationary state and different temperatures. In the absence of oxygen (Fig. 8A), the conversion increases with the temperature and the iron content. In the presence of oxygen (Fig. 8B), the effect of temperature is similar but a minimum appears upon increasing the Fe content. This minimum can be attributed to the fact that the global conversion contains the dehydration and dehydrogenation reactions which, as the Fe loading is increased (in the presence of O2), evolve in opposite directions (see below). The oxygen prevents the reduction of Fe3+ species and consequently enhances the acidity of the catalysts surface. Concomitantly, a shift of this minimum from around x = 2 to about x = 1 wt.% Fe is observed while increasing the temperature.
Fig. 9 shows the butenes yield at stationary state and different temperatures versus Fe content. In the absence of oxygen (Fig. 9A), the yield increases with iron loading and temperature, reaching 55% at 230 °C for Fe(5.40)/CaHAp. The presence of iron clearly improves the dehydration performance of the catalysts, which may be ascribed to the increase of the number of acidic active centres. In the presence of oxygen, the reaction does not produce carbon oxides in the chosen conditions. The butenes yield at stationary state increases with the reaction temperature and the Fe content because of the increase of the catalyst acidity (Fig. 9B).

On the other hand, the methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) yield in the absence of O2 (Fig. 10A) is quite low (<2.5%) at low at all Fe loadings. It increases with Fe content, passes through a maximum (for x ≈ 1.7 wt.% Fe), then decreases and reaches a stationary state that does not exceed 1.1% at 230 °C. The observed maximum can be associated with the compensation of the specific dehydrogenating ability of iron by the decrease of the solids basicity. At low Fe content, Fe3+–O–Ca2+ sites are predominant whereas more acid Fe3+–O–Fe3+ entities are generated upon increasing the Fe loading. In the presence of oxygen, the profile of methyl ethyl ketone yield changes radically (Fig. 10B). The highest values are recorded on pure CaHAp but this yield drops abruptly upon increasing the Fe loading and reaches a constant value (for x above 1.7%) much higher (yield around 17% at 230 °C) than in the absence of oxygen (Fig. 10A). The added O2 probably helps the regeneration of oxygen atoms, which by protonation restore the acid sites involved in the dehydration. This explains the predominance of butenes formation over MEK (compare Fig. 9, Fig. 10). In the absence of O2, there is also a predominance of butenes yield over MEK (Fig. 9, Fig. 10) due to the acidity which is solely provided by the introduction of iron.

To sum up, increasing the Fe content enhances the acidity and favours dehydration and so does the introduction of dioxygen.
3.11. Propane ODH
The propane ODH reaction can be written as follows:
C3H8 + 1/2 O2 → C3H6 + H2O
This exothermic reaction has no thermodynamic limitation and constitutes an excellent alternative for propene synthesis. In addition, CaHAp can host in its channels O2− species that can be involved in nonselective ODH reactions [36]. The Fe/Ca exchange also can promote the formation of other active oxygen species,as stated above. The superoxide O2− species are generally considered as favouring total oxidation, while the O− entities probably enhance propene formation [7]. Moreover, the basicity of the carrier also supports the abstraction of hydrogen.
The catalytic activity of Fe(x)/CaHAp samples was measured in the 350–550 °C temperature range. Fig. 11 displays the propane conversion versus catalyst weight at various temperatures. The conversion first increases linearly with the amount of catalyst then it becomes independent of the catalyst weight, probably because of the kinetic limitations, induced by transport phenomena in the reactor. To circumvent these limitations the catalyst weight was limited to 50 mg in all experiments.

According to Fig. 12, the propane conversion increases with the reaction temperature in the 450–550 °C range. The products formed are carbon oxides (COx), propene and ethylene. At 550 °C, the conversion is very low on pure CaHAp (#3%, not shown) but rises to 18% on Fe(0.52)/CaHAp, giving 9.5% COx, 6.2% propene and 2.3% ethylene. Increasing the Fe loading decreases the conversion and the propene yield. This result may be ascribed to the compensation of two parameters: (i) the specific dehydrogenating ability of iron, (ii) the decrease of the basicity of the solid, induced by the incorporation of Fe3+. Increasing the Fe content decreases the catalysts basicity and, hence its capacity of hydrogen abstraction. Considering that in the presence of dioxygen, the MEK yield (related to the dehydrogenating ability) is lowered by the presence of Fe (Fig. 10B), it may be assumed that, at low Fe content, iron generates oxygen species active in propane dehydrogenation but not in butan-2-ol dehydrogenation. The propene selectivity (Fig. 13A) decreases when the temperature (and the conversion) increases. It shows a maximum (about 90%) at 400 °C for an iron loading between 0.5 and 2.6%, attributed as previously shown to the changes of the acid–base features of the catalyst. However, as the propane conversion increases with temperature, the best propene yield (6.2%) was obtained at 550 °C over the iron-poorest sample, Fe(0.5)/CaHAp (Fig. 14B) with a selectivity around 32–35%. The propene yield and selectivity at 550 °C do not vary significantly versus time on stream at all iron loadings (Fig. 14), suggesting that the catalysts are fairly stable.

Several studies dealing with propane oxydehydrogenation over steamed Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst were recently published [62], [63], [64], [65]. The best propene yield (between 20 and up to 25%) was achieved using N2O as the oxygen supply in 370–500 °C range. Unfortunately, the catalyst loses its activity quite quickly because of the growth on its active sites of poisonous carbonaceous deposits [62], [63]. High calcination temperatures (up to 900 °C) increase Fe/ZSM-5 activity [9]. The level of the deactivation can be decreased by using O2–N2O mixture and by the elimination of protonic sites [64]. Steam-activated Fe/ZSM-5 leads to a larger propene yield (20% at 500 °C) than Fe/silicalite catalyst which under stream suffers a more severe deactivation due to coke formation [65].
The propene yields reported in the present work by using O2 as oxidant are lower than those obtained with N2O but the Fe/CaHAp catalysts do not require regenetation. Their performances should be tentatively related to the nature of the sites. The characterization techniques have identified two types of Fe3+ sites. The sites formed at low Fe content provide the best propene yield but increasing the Fe content above 1.0 wt.% is inefficient. The increase of Fe loading provokes the increase of the intensity and a concomitant shift of the UV–vis band of located at 850–910 nm towards high wavelengths, indicating that there is also an agglomeration and oxidation of iron species. This agglomeration and oxidation might be at the origin of the low yields achieved above x = 0.52 wt.% Fe. Fig. 15, illustrates this correlation and shows clearly that when the surface area of the 850–910 nm band increases, the propene yield decreases. Moreover, as pointed out for butan-2-ol conversion (Section 3.10), we assume that at low Fe content, isolated paramagnetic species such as Fe3+–O–Ca2+ are the predominant sites, whereas more acid Fe3+–O–Fe3+ entities are generated upon increasing the Fe loading. The substitution of calcium by iron decreases the residual charge on the oxygen of Ca2+–O2− species, probably provoking the activation of the oxygen atoms that intervene in hydrogen abstraction from propane. The Fe3+ fixation favours the mobility of neighboring oxygen ions or OH groups, as suggested before in the case of ethane ODH on Co/CaHAp [7], [19] and propane ODH on Co/SrHAp [22]. Incorporation of isolated Fe3+ should also favour the formation of oxygen vacancies, which may be replenished by gaseous oxygen, allowing the production of propene. However, the Fe3+–O–Fe3+ entities, which are too acid, are less efficient in the abstraction of hydrogen.

4. Conclusion
The iron exchanged as Fe3+ ions is distributed in CaHAp between two sites of different coordination. These sites were identified to distorted octahedral environments and sites of lower coordination. The TPR results confirmed this distribution and showed that the reduction of the exchanged Fe3+ never exceeds Fe2+.
The Fe(x)/CaHAp catalysts are active in butan-2-ol conversion. Increasing the iron content enhances the acid properties of the catalysts and its dehydration activity in butan-2-ol conversion (butenes yield) but decreases the dehydrogenating activity. It follows that the MEK yield in the presence of dioxygen is highest on pure CaHAp.
In propane ODH, the propene yield is maximum at 550 °C (6.2%) at low Fe content (0.52 wt.%) but carbon oxides (COx) and ethylene are also formed. It seems that the type of sites generated at low Fe content, identified to Fe3+–O–Ca2+ species, provides the best performances in propane ODH because the Fe content is low enough to avoid a drastic decrease of the basicity. Although these catalysts are fairly stable, their propene yield (about 6% at 550 °C) needs to be improved. This could done by preparing catalysts containing low Fe contents (<0.5 wt.%) and perhaps also by designing samples loaded with FexOy clusters instead of isolated Fe3+ species.
