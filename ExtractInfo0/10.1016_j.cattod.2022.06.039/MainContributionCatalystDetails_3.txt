The given document discusses gallium-exchanged zeolites for ethane dehydrogenation, and does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation. No specific mention of propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation is made. The focus is on comparing gallium speciation and ethane dehydrogenation activity over different zeolite frameworks like CHA, MOR and MFI. Since the content is not relevant to propane dehydrogenation, I have indicated "No" for relevance and did not extract any catalyst information.
