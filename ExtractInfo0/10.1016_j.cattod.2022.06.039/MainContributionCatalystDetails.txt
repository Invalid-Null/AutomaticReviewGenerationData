 Unfortunately the provided documents do not seem to contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Since multiple documents confirmed the focus was on ethane dehydrogenation over gallium-exchanged zeolites, I have marked the relevance as "No" and did not include any extracted information in the XML output:

  <Relevance>No</Relevance>

The documents discussed Ga-CHA and Ga-MOR catalysts for converting ethane to ethylene, but did not provide details related to propane dehydrogenation to propylene which was the topic of interest. Let me know if you need me to review any other documents for relevant propane dehydrogenation catalyst information.
