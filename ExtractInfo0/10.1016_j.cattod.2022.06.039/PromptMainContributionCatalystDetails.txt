Ga speciation and ethane dehydrogenation catalysis of Ga-CHA and MOR: Comparative investigation with Ga-MFI
This study investigated Ga speciation and ethane dehydrogenation catalysis of Ga-exchanged CHA and MOR (Ga-CHA and Ga-MOR) zeolites. These results were compared to the highly efficient Ga-exchanged MFI (Ga-MFI) zeolite previously developed. Reductive solid-state ion-exchange (RSSIE) reactions were conducted at varying loading conditions (Ga/Al = 0.3, H2 at 550 °C and Ga/Al = 1.0, H2 at 800 °C). Isolated Ga-hydrides formed in both CHA and MOR zeolites were probed using infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The remaining Brønsted acid sites (BASs) and formation of other isolated Ga species were characterized via NH3 and pyridine (Py) adsorption experiments as well as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). In non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation, high-loading Ga-MOR exhibited high selectivity and durability; however, the conversion was lower than high-loading Ga-MFI. In the case of Ga-CHA, increasing the loading amount did not improve the durability. The kinetic study and H−D exchange reactions were conducted to discuss the reason for better catalytic performance of Ga-MFI than those of Ga-CHA and MOR.
1. Introduction
Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates comprising tetrahedral SiO4 and AlO4 units. These tetrahedral SiO4 or AlO4 units are connected by sharing oxygen atoms to develop uniform porous frameworks. Because the isomorphic substitution of Si4+ with Al3+ leads to a negative charge in zeolite frameworks, cation species such as protons exist in the pores connecting with Al sites to maintain charge neutrality [1]. Through ion-exchange methods, cationic metal species can be introduced to synthesize metal-exchanged zeolites that can be used as heterogeneous catalysts to promote gas-phase and liquid-phase catalytic reactions [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. Various types of zeolites comprising different frameworks have been developed, and their catalytic performance varies accordingly [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17].
Group 13 metal-exchanged zeolites for light-alkane transformations have attracted considerable attention. In particular, Ga-exchanged MFI (Ga-MFI) zeolites have been one of the most important research topics for light-alkane dehydrogenation for over 30 years [18], [19], [20], [21]. Several Ga species, such as Ga-oxides, GaO+, Ga+, and Ga-hydrides, have been reported to be active sites [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Various types of Ga-oxide-based catalysts have been developed for alkane dehydrogenation; however, the catalysts deactivate quickly owing to coke formation [22], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]. Some studies have reported that isolated Ga-hydrides possess alkane dehydrogenation capabilities [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. The possibility of Ga-hydride formation was first proposed by Iglesia’s group via an in situ XAS study during RSSIE reactions [41]. Several research groups have since comprehensively studied the speciation of Ga-hydrides in MFI and/or catalysis for dehydrogenative alkane transformations. Kazansky’s group reported the formation of two kinds of Ga-hydrides in the form of [GaH2]+ and [GaH]2+ via in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy [36]. For propane and butane dehydrogenation, [GaH]2+ was independently proposed as the active site rather than [GaH2]+ by the research groups of Bell [37], [38], [39], Lercher [40], and Xu [42]. Both Ga-hydrides, as reported by Bell’s group,[39] are active for ethane dehydrogenation. Ga-hydrides in MFI may also promote the dehydrogenative aromatization of ethylene, as reported by Rimer and co-authors [43].
Other zeolite-supported Ga catalysts have been experimentally and theoretically studied by a few research groups [44], [45]. Buckles et al. synthesized Ga3+-exchanged Y zeolites via a liquid-phase ion-exchange reaction to study the mechanism of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, where Ga-Y exhibited lower activity than Ga-MFI [44]. Hensen et al. conducted DFT calculations of Ga-oxo cations in MOR zeolites. The cyclic Ga2O22+ ions were much more stable than the isolated GaO+ ions in MOR (SiAl = 23), and in situ hydrolysis of the reduced extra-framework Ga species was regarded to promote alkane dehydrogenation facilitating high activity [45]. The excellent activity and selectivity of the SAPO-11 zeolite-supported Ga catalyst in butane dehydrogenation was also reported by Machado and co-authors [46]. Vazhnova et al. compared the activity of Ga-loaded MFI and TON zeolites in butane aromatization, where Ga+ ions are proposed as active species [47]. Despite Ga-hydrides being regarded as active sites for alkane dehydrogenation over Ga-MFI, the possibility of Ga-hydride formation in other zeolites, and their relationship with catalysis have not yet been reported.
Recently, our group investigated In- [48] and Ga- [49] exchanged zeolites for selective ethane dehydrogenation. In-CHA was found to show high selectivity and durability, where [InH2]+ is the most plausible active site rather than In+ or [InH]2+, as revealed by experimental and theoretical studies. The different zeolite frameworks (CHA, MFI, and MOR of 8-, 10-, 12-membered ring zeolites, respectively) are closely related to ethane dehydrogenation catalysis, and the active [InH2]+ ions are possibly formed only in CHA zeolites [50]. More recently, the effect of the loading amount on the generation of Ga species in MFI and ethane dehydrogenation has been reported [49]. [GaH2]+ is mainly formed in the high-loading Ga-MFI (SiO2/Al2O3 = 22.3, Ga/Al = 1.0 with H2 at 800 °C) and serves as a selective and coke-resistant active site, yielding the highest ethylene formation rate among Pt-free catalyst systems [49]. However, the effect of zeolite frameworks on Ga-hydride formation and ethane dehydrogenation catalysis has not yet been investigated.
Herein, the formation of Ga-hydrides and catalysis in ethane dehydrogenation of Ga-CHA and MOR was investigated using zeolite supports with similar SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (22.3 and 18.3 for CHA and MOR, respectively) and identical preparation conditions (Ga/Al = 0.3, H2 at 550 °C, and Ga/Al = 1.0, with H2 at 800 °C, denoted as 0.3(550) and 1.0(800), respectively). It was found that more Ga-hydrides were formed in the MOR than in CHA. In ethane dehydrogenation, the high-loading Ga-MOR exhibited the best ethylene selectivity and durability among the tested Ga-CHA and -MOR catalysts, although the ethane conversion value was lower than that for the high-loading Ga-MFI previously developed [49]. The impact of Ga-hydride formation in different zeolites on ethane dehydrogenation catalysis is also discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A series of Ga-CHA and -MOR were synthesized by the RSSIE method in a similar manner to previous our study [49]. First, Ga2O3-modified zeolites were prepared by impregnation of Ga(NO)3·nH2O (n = 7–9, Wako) on NH4+-type CHA (SiO2/Al2O3 = 22.3, Tosoh) and H+-type MOR (SiO2/Al2O3 = 18.3, Tosoh), followed by drying in an oven and calcination at 500 °C for 1 h under air flow. The Ga/Al ratio (Ga/Al = 0.3 or 1.0) was determined based on the amount of Ga precursor (Ga(NO)3·nH2O), and zeolite. After the calcined samples were prepared, RSSIE reactions were conducted via H2 treatment (10 mL/min of 10% H2/He) for 1 h. The treatment temperatures were 550 °C for Ga/ Al = 0.3 and 800 °C for Ga/Al = 1.0. The obtained samples were denoted as Ga-CHA-X(Y) or Ga-MOR-X(Y) (X: 0.3 or 1.0, Y: 550, or 800).
2.2. Characterization
2.2.1. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
XRD experiments were performed using a Rigaku MiniFlex II/AP diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. H-CHA was prepared by the calcination of NH4+-type CHA at 500 °C for 1 h under air flow. After the RSSIE reaction, Ga-CHA and Ga-MOR were exposed to air and subsequently characterized.
2.2.2. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy for Ga-hydrides formation by RSSIE
FT-IR spectroscopy was conducted using a homemade in situ quartz cell and FT/IR-4100 (JASCO) with a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. The Ga2O3-modified zeolite (40 mg) was made into a self-supported disk and placed into the cell. The background spectrum was recorded at 50 °C in a He atmosphere prior to the measurement. The disk sample was treated with 10% H2/He at different temperatures (550 °C for Ga/Al = 0.3 and 800 °C for Ga/Al = 1.0) to promote the RSSIE reaction. In each case, the sample was treated with 10% H2/He for 1 h and cooled to 50 °C in a H2 atmosphere without exposure to air. The first IR spectrum was recorded after purging with He. Next, the obtained sample was treated at 800 °C under He flow for 1 h to decompose the generated Ga-hydrides. The second spectrum was recorded at 50 °C. The first spectrum was subsequently subtracted from the second spectrum to obtain a third spectrum.
2.2.3. FT-IR spectroscopy for Py and NH3 adsorption experiments
Disk samples of Ga-CHA or Ga-MOR were prepared in situ in a quartz cell as described above. The temperature was decreased to 150 °C to obtain the background spectrum in a He atmosphere. Approximately 1 mL of Py was introduced using a syringe with continuous recording of the IR spectra. This dosing procedure was repeated until the band corresponding to the adsorbed Py was saturated. The final IR spectrum was obtained after purging the sample with He for 15 min. For the NH3 adsorption experiment, background spectra were obtained at 50 °C in He atmosphere, and then, 10% NH3/He flow was introduced until the peak at approximately 1450 cm−1, corresponding to adsorbed NH3 on Brønsted acid sites (BASs), was saturated [51]. After purging with He for 15 min to remove NH3, the final IR spectrum was recorded.
2.2.4. In situ XAS measurement
XAS measurements were conducted using the BL14B2 station at SPring-8. The disk sample of Ga2O3/CHA or Ga2O3/MOR was set into a cell and heated to 550 or 800 °C based on the Ga loading amount as described above, and thereafter, the first spectrum was recorded. Then, 10% H2/He was introduced to promote the RSSIE reactions of Ga2O3/CHA or Ga2O3/MOR with continuous recording until the spectrum was saturated.
2.2.5. Temperature programed oxidation (TPO) experiment
Temperature programed oxidation (TPO) measurements were conducted 2 h after reaction commencement, using 50 mg of the catalyst. The catalyst was set into a flow-type reactor connected to a BELmass (MicrotracBEL). Initially, the sample was treated with He at 100 °C for 30 min, followed by 10% O2/He (50 mL/min), with the temperature increasing to 800 °C at 10 °C/min. The amount of CO2 generated by coke oxidation (m/z = 44) was recorded throughout.
2.2.6. H−D exchange experiment
The H−D exchange reactions were carried out for the pellet of Ga-exchanged zeolite after RSSIE using the homemade in situ cell described above. Prior to the reaction, the background spectra were obtained under He at 50 °C. The disk samples were treated with 10 mL/min of 10% D2/He at 400 °C for 30 min. The IR spectra were then recorded at 50 °C under He to monitor a negative band for Ga−H stretching vibration and a positive band for Ga−D stretching vibration.
2.3. Catalytic test
2.3.1. Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation
The ethane dehydrogenation over Ga-exchanged zeolites (Ga-MOR and Ga-CHA) was carried out at 660 °C in a flow-type reactor at atmospheric pressure. Before the catalytic reaction, catalysts were prepared in situ under 10% H2/He flow for 30 min at 550 °C or 800 °C. After cooling to 660 °C under H2/He flow and subsequent purging with He, the gas reactant (10% C2H6/He) was introduced at 660 °C. The conversion, selectivity, and yield were determined by GC and calculated using the following equations:
The deactivation rate was calculated by the following equation according to previous paper: [52].
The

represent the initial and end conversions, respectively.
(h) represents the reaction time. A lower kd value indicates less deactivation and increased durability of the catalyst.
2.3.2. Kinetic study for ethane dehydrogenation
The kinetic study of ethane dehydrogenation was conducted in the same flow-type reactor. The reaction conditions were as follows: for C2H6 partial pressure (0.02–0.08), balanced with He (total flow rate: 50 mL/min), at a reaction temperature of 600 °C. For the formation rate dependency on reaction temperature (550–610 °C), the partial pressure of C2H6 was 0.04, and balanced with He (total flow rate: 50 mL/min).
3. Result and discussion
3.1. Characterization of Ga-CHA and Ga-MOR
XRD experiments were conducted on Ga-CHA and -MOR to confirm the preservation of the zeolite framework after the RSSIE reactions (Fig. 1). Any diffraction peak derived from Ga oxide species was not observed in the XRD patterns before RSSIE, suggesting that the small or amorphous Ga oxide species possibly exist after calcination. For CHA zeolites, the spectra of the Ga-exchanged zeolite after RSSIE reactions were almost identical to proton-type zeolites, indicating that the CHA zeolite frameworks were maintained by H2 treatment at 550 or 800 °C. While in the case of MOR zeolites, the peak intensity for Ga-MOR-0.3(550) remained almost unchanged. However, the peak intensity for Ga-MOR-1.0(800) decreased slightly, implying that the MOR zeolite framework was partially destroyed by high-temperature H2 treatment at 800 °C. The low angle shift was hardly observed between the H-type zeolites and the Ga-exchanged zeolites in both cases, which indicates that the Ga species are mostly immobilized at Al sites and that the incorporation of Ga species in zeolite framework is unlikely to occur. The similar result was reported by Serykh [53].

Fig. 1. XRD patterns of proton-type and Ga-exchanged CHA and MOR zeolites.
In situ FT-IR measurements were performed to investigate the formation of Ga-hydrides in the Ga-CHA and MOR. IR spectra were obtained using a method similar to that used in our recent work on Ga-MFIs (Fig. 2) [49]. Monovalent [GaH2]+ and divalent [GaH]2+ in MFI show an IR peak derived from the Ga−H stretching vibration at approximately 2040 cm−1 and 2060 cm−1, respectively [36]. Ga-CHA-0.3(550) showed almost no peak derived from Ga−H stretching vibration, indicating that few Ga-hydrides were formed. Increasing the Ga/Al ratio from 0.3 to 1.0 and H2 treatment temperature from 550 °C to 800 °C (Ga-CHA-1.0(800)), a peak at 2050 cm−1 was detected. In the case of Ga-MOR, low Ga loading Ga-MOR-0.3(550) exhibited two peaks with wavenumbers of 2077 and 2050 cm−1. These peaks were assigned to [GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+, respectively. Contrastingly, Ga-MOR-1.0-(800) showed a main peak assignable to [GaH2]+ at 2050 cm−1, with a much higher intensity compared to Ga-CHA-1.0(800). These results indicate Ga-hydrides were also formed in other zeolite frameworks, such as CHA and MOR. The formation of Ga-hydrides was supported by H−D exchange reactions. The results are discussed in section 3.5.

Fig. 2. Difference IR spectra of Ga-exchanged CHA and MOR with different loading amounts and H2 treatment. The spectra were recorded at 50 °C. Difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectra after He treatment at 800 °C from that after H2 treatment.
Py adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate other Ga species after the RSSIE reaction. Py was introduced after recording the background, and the dosing procedure was repeated until the saturation of the band corresponded to adsorbed Py. The IR spectra were collected after complete adsorption of Py, followed by He purging (Fig. 3). As recently reported, Py adsorbed onto BASs, Ga+, and GaOx displayed peaks at approximately 1555, 1457, and 1446 cm−1, respectively [40], [49], [54]. In our recent study, the peak intensity of GaOx was hardly observed for Ga-MFI-1.0(800), confirming that the RSSIE occurred completely by high-temperature H2 treatment. The lower-temperature H2 treatment for low-loading Ga-MFI, however, resulted in the presence of remaining GaOx species. A similar result was obtained for Ga-MOR. When the Ga/Al ratio and H2 treatment temperature were increased from 0.3 to 1.0 and from 550 °C to 800 °C, respectively, the peak intensity of Ga+ cations (1457 cm−1) increased while the peak intensity of GaOx (1445 cm−1) and remaining BASs (1555 cm−1) decreased, suggesting that higher Ga loading and H2 treatment temperature also improve the RSSIE reaction in the MOR zeolite. The pore size of CHA is the smallest among the three kinds of zeolites. Py might be too large to access into the pore, so that the adsorbed Py was hard to be detected (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4. IR spectra of adsorbed NH3 on Ga-CHA and Ga-MOR recorded at 50 °C. The spectra were recorded after the NH3 adsorption was saturated and purged by He.
The remaining BASs after the RSSIE were also measured using NH3 adsorption experiments. After the RSSIE reaction, the temperature was decreased to 50 °C and purged with He, followed by NH3/He (10%) until the peak at approximately 1450 cm−1, corresponding to adsorbed NH3 on BASs [51], reached saturation. The IR spectra for adsorbed NH3 were recorded after He was purged to remove gaseous NH3. The peak area was normalized to that of the proton-type zeolite (H-CHA or H-MOR) to determine the relative amount of BASs. The remaining BASs over Ga-CHA-0.3(550) were determined to be 48%. An increase in the Ga loading and H2 treatment temperature (Ga-CHA-1.0(800)) decreased the remaining BAS to 17%. Similar results were obtained for Ga-MOR, where the remaining BASs were 72% and 34% for Ga-MOR-0.3(550) and 1.0(800), respectively. A high Ga loading is effective for reduction of the remaining BASs.
Furthermore, in situ XAS measurements were conducted for low- and high-loading Ga-CHA and MOR during RSSIE reactions. The disk of Ga2O3-modified zeolite was set into a cell and heated under He to the requisite temperature (550 °C for Ga/Al = 0.3 and 800 °C for Ga/Al = 1.0, respectively). With continuously recording the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra, the gas flow was changed to H2/He to initiate the RSSIE reaction. The final spectrum was obtained when the spectrum remained unchanged. The absorption energy of Ga-CHA-0.3(550) and 1.0(800) before RSSIE was determined as E0 = 10366.8 and 10367.0 eV, respectively, which were nearly the same as that of the bulk Ga2O3 (E0 = 10366.9 eV) (Fig. 5a). In the FT-EXAFS spectra of the Ga-CHA and Ga-MOR (Fig. S1), the peak derived from Ga−O−Ga shell was much lower in intensity compared to that for Ga2O3, supporting the presence of small or amorphous Ga oxide species before RSSIE. After the RSSIE reaction, the XANES spectra of Ga-CHA-0.3(550) and Ga-CHA-1.0(800) showed strong peaks at approximately 10364 eV, and the absorption edge shifted toward lower energy values (E0 = 10363.1 and 10363.3 eV, respectively). Although the assignment of these species is controversial, the spectral changes were interpreted as the formation of isolated Ga species in zeolites, including Ga+ [55] and Ga-hydrides [56] ([GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+) [57]. Similar spectral changes induced by RSSIE reactions were observed for Ga-MOR (Fig. 5b). When the XANES spectra were compared between 0.3(550) and 1.0(800), the intensity of the peak at approximately 10363 eV was higher for 1.0(800) in both cases (Ga-CHA and Ga-MOR). Together with the IR results, high-temperature H2 treatment was necessary for the formation of isolated Ga species. The similar conclusion was obtained in our previous paper for Ga-MFIs [49].

3.2. Comparative investigation of Ga-exchanged zeolites in ethane dehydrogenation
Ethylene is an important building block for producing many chemicals, such as polymers, oxygenates, and some important chemical intermediates [52], [58]. Steam cracking of alkanes is the most widely used method to produce ethylene. However, extremely high temperatures are required, and coke formation is heavy. Catalytic non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation has been a potential technology to produce ethylene under milder conditions [48], [52], [59]. In general, Pt- [52], [60], [61], [62], [63] and Cr- [64], [65], [66] based catalysts are widely used in non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation, but the utilization of these catalysts suffers from poor durability due to coke formation or metal sintering of Pt particles in current reactions. Apart from the commonly used catalysts, other metal-based catalysts, such as Fe- [59], [67], Co- [68] loaded zeolites, have also been reported to exhibit a high C2H4 formation rate or selectivity, while rapid coke formation is still unavoidable.
Recently, we found that the high-loading Ga-MFI (Ga/Al = 1.0, H2 at 800 °C, denoted as Ga-MFI-1.0(800)) worked as a selective and coke-resistant catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. Good initial conversion and selectivity (43% and 89%, respectively) were obtained with a low deactivation rate (0.024 h−1 for 15 h) at 660 °C [49]. The high catalytic performance was ascribed to both the low amount of remaining BASs and the main formation of [GaH2]+ ions as active isolated Ga-hydrides.
In this study, Ga-CHA and Ga-MOR were prepared in situ by RSSIE. Catalytic reactions were carried out under the same reaction conditions as those above (Fig. 6 and Table 1). Ga-CHA-1.0(800) exhibited better selectivity (90%) than Ga-CHA-0.3(550) (73%), while the initial conversion values were similar (33% and 27%, respectively) (Fig. 6a). Conversion decreased with increasing reaction time for both Ga-CHA-0.3(550) and 1.0(800). The deactivation rates (kd) for 220 min were almost identical (0.25 and 0.28 h−1, respectively). Both low- and high-loading Ga-CHA showed low durability despite the decrease in the relative amount of remaining BASs with increasing Ga loading.

Temperature: 660 °C. bDetermined by GC-FID. cThe determination of the deactivation rate is described in the experimental section. dThe catalytic test was previously investigated [49]. The results are shown for comparison with those of Ga-CHA and MOR.
Contrastingly, Ga loading strongly affected the durability of Ga-MOR. The low-loading Ga-MOR-0.3(550) catalyst exhibited moderate initial conversion and selectivity values of 37 % and 70 %, respectively (Fig. 6b and Table 1). However, conversion quickly decreased from 37% to 14% after 220 min, with a kd of 0.37 h−1. Ga-MOR-1.0(800) showed good selectivity (90%) and maintained the initial conversion (20%) for 220 min, although the conversion was much lower than that of Ga-MFI-1.0(800) (43%, Table 1, comparison of the time course is shown in Fig. S2. The product distribution with considering coke formation is summarized in Table S1).
Increased Ga loading improved the durability of Ga-MOR in ethane dehydrogenation. A similar trend was reported for Ga-MFI-1.0(800) and showed increased durability (kd = 0.013 h−1 for 220 min) compared to the low-loading Ga-MFI (Ga/Al = 0.3, H2 at 550 °C, kd = 0.65 h−1) [49]. TPO experiments for the catalysts after 2 h (Fig. 7) showed that significant coke formation had occurred for Ga-CHA-0.3(550), Ga-CHA-1.0(800), and Ga-MOR-0.3(550). Notably, coke formation was suppressed over Ga-MOR-1.0(800) in the same level of the Ga-MFI-1.0(800) [49]. High Ga loading is also effective in suppressing coke formation over Ga-MOR, improving durability.

3.3. Kinetic study for high-loading Ga-exchanged zeolites
The reaction mechanism for ethane dehydrogenation on isolated Ga species has previously been investigated [37], [40], [69], [70], [71]. Bell’s group discussed the reaction mechanisms of [GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+ ions for ethane dehydrogenation in a theoretical study [72]. The alkyl mechanism of [GaH]2+ ions involve C2H4 formation as the rate-determining step (RDS), whereas the RDS can be both C2H6 activation and C2H4 formation in the carbenium mechanism on [GaH]2+ ions. For the [GaH2]+ ions, the alkyl mechanism is most plausible, in which the RDS is C2H6 activation. We recently reported a relatively high reaction order of ethane partial pressure (p(C2H6)) (0.56) for Ga-MFI-1.0(800) possessing [GaH2]+ ions as the dominant Ga-hydrides, whereas a low reaction order of p(C2H6) (0.20) was observed for Ga-MFI-0.3(550) having [GaH]2+ ions as major Ga-hydrides [49]. Combined with recent literature, the reaction order of p(C2H6) would be an indicator to consider active Ga-hydrides, [GaH]2+, and [GaH2]+ ions.
Kinetic studies were conducted for Ga-CHA-1.0(800) and Ga-MOR-1.0(800) under the same reaction conditions as those previously reported to discuss the active Ga species for ethane dehydrogenation. It was difficult to obtain reliable kinetic data for Ga-MOR-0.3(550) (Fig. S3), which might be due to rapid deactivation. Hence, kinetic data for the low-loading Ga-exchanged zeolite were excluded from this discussion. The reaction orders of p(C2H6) for Ga-MOR-1.0(800) and Ga-CHA-1.0(800) were determined as 0.63 and 0.27, respectively (Fig. 8a). The reaction temperature dependence of the ethylene formation rate (Eyring plot) was also investigated to evaluate the apparent ΔH‡ (Fig. 8b). The ΔH‡ values for Ga-MOR-1.0(800) and Ga-CHA-1.0(800) were 106 kJ/mol and 77 kJ/mol, respectively. The reaction order of the p(C2H6) and ΔH‡ values for Ga-MOR-1.0(800) are quite similar to those for Ga-MFI-1.0(800) and are consistent with the alkyl mechanism on [GaH2]+ ions, as proposed by Bell [72]. [GaH2]+ ions are likely active Ga-hydrides in ethane dehydrogenation on Ga-MOR-1.0(800). In the case of Ga-CHA-1.0(800), the low reaction order of p(C2H6) (0.27) indicates that C2H4 formation is involved in the RDS, suggesting that [GaH]2+ ions are more plausible active Ga-hydrides than [GaH2]+ ions.

3.4. H−D exchange experiment
Although the apparent ΔH‡ for Ga-MFI-1.0(800) was similar to Ga-MOR-1.0(800) and higher than Ga-CHA-1.0(800), the catalytic performance of Ga-MFI-1.0(800) was superior. To determine the reason for the higher catalytic performance, H−D exchange experiments were conducted and monitored by FT-IR spectroscopy for a series of Ga-exchanged zeolites (Fig. 9a). After the RSSIE reaction (H2 at 550 or 800 °C) for the IR disk of Ga2O3-modified zeolites, recording of background spectra at 50 °C under He, the Ga-zeolites were treated with D2 at 400 °C to investigate the exchange reactions. The temperature was then decreased to 50 °C and IR spectra recorded. Negative bands derived from the consumption of Ga-hydrides (~2050 cm−1) and positive bands assigned to Ga-deuteride appeared (~1470 cm−1), indicating the occurrence of H−D exchange reactions. This supports the formation of Ga-hydrides in different zeolites. Among the tested catalysts, the highest intensity of the negative band was obtained for Ga-MFI-1.0(800). The relationship between the relative amounts of Ga-hydrides in zeolites and catalytic performance was plotted. The ethylene yield at 3 h (as an index of steady-state activity) was plotted as a function of negative intensity at 2050 cm−1 (Fig. 9b). A positive linear relationship was observed, which showed that the highest relative amount of Ga-hydrides in Ga-MFI-1.0(800) is one of the main reasons for the superior catalytic performance, although different active Ga-hydrides depending on the zeolite frameworks and Ga loading amounts should also be considered.

4. Conclusion
We investigated the effect of different zeolite frameworks (CHA and MOR) on Ga speciation and ethane dehydrogenation catalysis for comparison with Ga-MFIs. The formation of Ga-hydrides in CHA and MOR zeolites after RSSIE was confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy, indicating that Ga-hydrides were more likely to be formed in MOR than CHA. The formation of other isolated Ga species was confirmed by Py adsorption experiments and in situ XAS spectroscopy. Increasing the Ga loading was found to be effective in reducing the remaining BASs in both zeolites. These results are similar to those obtained in our recent study of Ga-MFIs [49]. Regarding ethane dehydrogenation catalysis, an increase in Ga loading improved the durability of Ga-MOR, whereas both low- and high-loading Ga-CHA exhibited low durability. However, the catalytic performances of Ga-CHA and -MOR were inferior to those of the previously developed high-loading Ga-MFI catalyst [49]. The high catalytic performance of MFI was discussed based on kinetic studies and H−D exchange reactions. [GaH2]+ ions are plausible active Ga-hydrides in the high-loading Ga-MOR, as seen with Ga-MFI, whereas different kinetics were observed for the high-loading Ga-CHA. The H−D exchange reactions over a series of Ga-exchanged zeolites indicate that the highest relative amount of Ga-hydrides is one of the reasons for the high catalytic performance of MFI. Noth that, during the submission of this manuscript, Ga-exchanged CHA and BEA zeolites for propane dehydrogenation have been reported from the group of Lobo [73] and Lercher [74], independently, where the isolated Ga-hydrides possibly involve the dehydrogenation. This study revealed the formation of Ga-hydrides in other zeolite frameworks other than MFI and suggests that formation of more isolated Ga-hydrides is key to developing more efficient Ga-zeolite-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation.
