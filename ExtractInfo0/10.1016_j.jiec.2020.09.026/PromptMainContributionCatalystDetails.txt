A review on one-pot synthesis of acrylic acid from glycerol on bi-functional catalysts
Abstract
Oxydehydration is one of the possible reactions to valorize glycerol to acrylic acid that has high demand in industry. Glycerol oxydehydration is a two-step reaction that is an interesting, yet challenging approach to give high acrylic acid yield. The reaction consists of the dehydration to 3-hydroxypropanal and subsequently to acrolein catalyzed by mainly Brønsted acid sites. Selective oxidation catalyzed by metal sites should then be carried out to form acrylic acid. A single-step or one-pot conversion requires a multi-component catalyst addressing the requirements of both steps to selectively form the desired product. Strong acid sites will catalyze the undesired glycerol oxidation reactions while metals with high redox capability tend to cause oxidative decomposition of acrolein. This work reviews the recent works on glycerol catalytic oxydehydration to form acrylic acid in a one-pot approach. The complete reaction mechanism and specific requirements are elucidated. Main focus is given to the pros and cons of four groups of catalysts i.e. vanadium pyrophosphates, supported heteropoly acids, mixed metal oxides and molecular sieves. The roles of specific acid sites, type and composition of active components and redox strength of active components are critically reviewed.
Introduction
The high consumption of fossil energy sources results in increasing emission level of greenhouse gases. As such, the research effort to identify greener alternative sources has been recently intensified [1], [2], [3]. As an effort to reduce the use of fossil fuels, researchers have now turned into biomass-derived energy sources such as bioethanol and biodiesel [4], [5]. Biodiesel is proven to be a potential alternative fuel and it is mainly produced via catalytic transformation (mostly through transesterification process) of vegetable oils (triglyceride) or animal fats with mono-alcohols [1], [4].
Glycerol is produced as the main by-product in biodiesel production processes. It is generally reported that roughly 100 kg of glycerol is obtained for every 1 t of biodiesel produced [6]. As biodiesel production greatly increases with time, a large surplus of glycerol production occurs. Due to the presence of impurities (i.e. water, inorganic salts, methanol, fatty acids and esters) at significant concentrations in crude glycerol, it is generally considered as a waste product to be managed by the industry [7]. Usually, large-scale biodiesel manufactures can pre-treat and utilize this crude glycerol for different applications. However, the pre-treatment cost is rather uneconomical for small-scale industries. Hence, a more sustainable approach to convert the unrefined glycerol into other value-added derivative products should be established [3], [4]. In 2020, purified glycerol was usually traded around the world at prices of around USD 2–3/kg [8]. Certainly, these low prices did not justify crude glycerol purification as an economically viable option. As such, future demand for purified glycerol needs to be created to increase its market price.
In general, two main approaches that could be employed for the conversion of glycerol into other products are either by redox processes or by reacting glycerol with other molecules [9]. Fig. 1 shows the molecular structure of glycerol and several of its possible derivatives [10]. The chemical transformations of glycerol into valuable downstream products include dehydration, oxidation, hydrogenolysis, steam reforming, and etherification. Acrolein [11], [12], [13], lactic acid [14], [15], [16], 1,3-propanediol and hydrocarbons [17], [18], [19], glyceraldehyde and glyceric acid [20], [21], hydrogen [22], [23] and polyglycerols [24], [25] are among the high-value products that could be formed from those reactions. Various catalytic processes to convert glycerol to its value-added derivatives are summarized in Table 1. In general, the conversions involve multi-step reactions with specific requirements with regards to the catalyst. Specific metal, acid or basic sites can play different roles while the pore characteristics can also play supplementary roles in increasing the selectivity to the desired products. The main challenge is the general objective of achieving a one-pot synthesis of the products. Chemical combination of active species at the right composition, the use of suitable porous support material and the preparation method of the catalyst are the topics of recent research interest. Supports materials with large internal pores could allow more undesired reactions to significantly occur leading to the formation of undesired products while the catalyst could experience significant deactivation due to coking activity. Meanwhile, highly porous supports could also mean poor catalytic stability due to the partial collapse of the pores during the reaction and significant pore blockage caused by coke.

Product Synthesis reaction Catalyst Remarks Ref
Acrolein Dehydration HSiW/Zr 63.75% of acrolein yield was obtained at 92% glycerol conversion using 30 wt.% HSiW/Zr catalyst. Coke deposition activity was high due to the large pore diameters (>19 nm). [11]
VPO/Zr-SBA-15 Acrolein yield (42%) improved after the treatment of 12 wt.% of V2O5 with H3PO4 at a V/P ratio of 0.2. The mesoporous structure was partially destroyed with the incorporation of phosphorus. [12]
H3PW12O40/MCM-41, H6P2W18O62/ MCM-41 H6P2W18O62/MCM-41 generated more acrolein during the reaction as it had more Brønsted acid sites compared to H3PW12O40/MCM-41. [13]
Lactic Acid Oxidation Pd/C, Pt/C Near complete conversions of glycerol with 68% and 74% selectivities to lactic acid yield were achieved using 10% Pd/C and 5% Pt/C, respectively. High stability of the catalysts was demonstrated for up to five consecutive cycles. [14]
Hydrothermal CaO 97.8% glycerol conversion with corresponding lactic acid yield of 40.8% were achieved at the optimum conditions. [15]
Graphite/Ni A lactic acid selectivity of 92.2% was reached at 97.6% glycerol conversion. [16]
1,2 propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol, ketone and hydrocarbons Hydrogenolysis Zn, Cu, Ni, Zr/H-beta A 1,3-propanediol selectivity of 14% was obtained at 73% glycerol conversion by the Ni- incorporated Zr/H-beta. 1-propanal was the predominant product when bare H-beta and Zr/H-beta were used. [17]
Pt/WOx/Al2O3 The roles played by tungsten oxide were (a) as an interaction site for the 1° OH group/s in glycerol molecule, (b) as a proton supplying site and, (c) as a stabilizing site for the 2° carbocation. 38.5% of 1,3-propanediol yield was achieved by the most active catalyst in 4 h for the reaction carried out at 200 °C and 90 bar of H2. [18]
Ir-Ni/Al2O3 Calcined Ir-Ni bimetallic catalyst produced higher glycerol conversion (21.2%) compared to Ir (5.9%) and Ni (2.4%) monometallic catalysts with an excellent 1,2-propanediol selectivity of 87.2%. Synergic effect between the metals was promoted by the modification of the iridium electronic state in the presence of nickel. [19]
Glyceraldehyde, glyceric acid, formic acid Oxidation Pt/MCN The basicity of the mesoporous carbon nitride (MCN) support enhanced the glycerol oxidation to glyceraldehyde, which would be further oxidized to glyceric acid. At the optimum reaction conditions, glycerol conversion, glyceric acid yield and glyceraldehyde yield of 63.1%, 58.5% and 24.3%, respectively were obtained. [20]
Au-Cu/ZnO & Au-Ag/ZnO At 95% glycerol conversions, the selectivities to glyceric acid obtained using Au-Cu/ZnO and Au-Ag/ZnO as catalysts were 59% and 64%, respectively. The synergetic effect between gold and copper enhanced the AuCu-ZnO catalyst’s performance in the oxidation of glycerol. [21]
Hydrogen Glycerol steam reforming Ni incorporated Pd/Al2O3-ZrO2 Pd incorporation promoted cooperative effect which resulted in better H2 yield. Near complete glycerol conversion with the highest H2 yield of 74% were obtained at 800 °C. [22]
Ni/Al2O3, La2O3, SiO2, ZrO2 & MgO Based on the selectivity to H2, the sequence of catalytic activity was reported as Ni/Al2O3 > Ni/La2O3 > Ni/ZrO2 > Ni/MgO > Ni/SiO2. The highest H2 selectivity (71.8%) was achieved by Ni/Al2O3 catalyst and it was attributed to its small Al2O3 crystallite sizes coupled with high specific surface area. [23]
Diglycerol, triglycerol, polyglycerol Etherification MgFe mixed oxide MgFeO4 (with a Mg/Fe molar ratio of 4) showed the highest glycerol conversion of 41%. After 24 h of reaction, diglycerols and triglycerols were detected. The stability of iron component in the MgO oxide structure significantly influenced the behaviour of the catalyst. The increase in the Mg/Fe molar ratio improved the catalytic activity. [24]
Microwave-assisted etherification Na2CO3 A solvent-free microwave-assisted glycerol etherification was used to produce the desired product. At the optimal reaction conditions, a glycerol conversion of 93%, a combined yield of the desired products (i.e. diglycerols, triglycerols, tetraglycerols) of 70%, and an acceptable cyclic diglycerols selectivity of 7% were achieved. [25]
Considerable research attention has been recently dedicated to the dehydration of glycerol to acrolein as reported by some researchers [26], [27], [28]. Acrolein is the main feedstock for the subsequent controlled oxidation reaction to acrylic acid which has high industrial demand for the production of acrylic esters, resins, oil treatment chemicals and polymer desiccants [29], [30]. Even though some heterogeneous acidic catalysts show generally show good acrolein selectivities, the catalyst may rapidly deactivate after one cycle of use in most cases. Hence, the development of stable solid catalysts, which are more resistant to deactivation for glycerol conversion into acrolein is still a topic of great research interest.
Alternatively, direct acrylic acid production from glycerol in a single pot method is gaining increasing research attention. It is based on the goals of achieving a simpler and greener process, and coupled with the ability to design a suitable multi-component heterogeneous catalyst system. This approach will require a multi-functional catalyst that is capable of performing both the dehydration step of glycerol to selectively form acrolein and the subsequent acrolein controlled oxidation reaction to form acrylic acid in a single reaction vessel. Hence, it is actually an advantageous process from both economic and engineering perspectives. However, challenges are still lying ahead in terms of poor catalytic activity, poor acrylic acid selectivity, rapid catalyst deactivation, different optimum conditions for the two reaction steps etc. Mature understanding of the reaction mechanism is also yet to be established. To date, an in-depth review of acrylic acid production from glycerol, especially through a one-pot synthesis method is hardly found in literature. Thus, in this work, recent development in catalytic one-pot glycerol oxydehydration to acrylic together with related reaction mechanism acid is thoroughly reviewed. The pros and cons of various approaches attempted so far are critically reviewed and conflicting arguments by the researchers are discussed. The main objective is to shed some light into the future research direction in this area particularly with regards to the right combination of active catalytic components to be used towards achieving a more sustainable conversion. However, detail discussion on the roles of the surface morphology of specific catalysts and their pore systems is deemed to be beyond the scopes of the present work.
Conventional acrylic acid production and its drawbacks
Being listed as among the top 100 chemicals produced worldwide, acrylic acid is a chemical of industrial importance with an annual production capacity of 4.8 million metric tons in 2014 [31]. In addition to a good economic potential, this molecule is also attractive in an environmental perspective and finds application in various industries [32]. This unsaturated C3 carboxylic acid with a molecular formula of C3H4O2 is a colorless liquid at room temperature. With the presence of reactive α-β unsaturated carboxyl group in its molecule, acrylic acid may undergo oxidative polymerization to yield several downstream polymeric derivatives that are applicable to industries such as super adsorbents, fabric components, detergents, paper additives, coating materials and plastics, etc. [33].
Commercially, the conventional acrylic acid production process is usually a dual-step oxidation process of propylene that is of petrochemical origin and the process is carried out in gas phase [34]. It starts with oxidative dehydration of propylene (that is usually obtained from naphtha cracking process) into acrolein. This intermediate will eventually form acrylic acid in the subsequent partial oxidative reaction [34]. The catalysts used for this two-step process are usually mixed metal oxides based on Mo and Bi with the use of suitable additives for selectivity improvement [35]. A number of alternative routes have also been patented to synthesize acrylic acid. For example, sugar fermentation to hydroxyl propionic acid has been developed by Cargill [36] and its subsequent dehydration to form acrylic acid has been successfully demonstrated. An alternative route to form acrylic acid from the same feedstock has also been developed by Arkema Company using a multi-bed reactor system catalyzed by two types of proprietory catalyst [37]. A two-stage conversion is usually used due to different requirements for active sites as well as different reaction conditions needed by each step. The dehydration step usually requires acid sites [12], [38] while the oxidation step is usually accelerated by metal sites [39], [40]. However, these two alternative routes to produce acrylic acid could subject to low reaction rate and poor acrylic acid selectivity in addition to complicated reaction system requirement. The possibility of combining the two stages into a one-pot process using suitable multi-functional heterogenous catalysts is an interesting prospect due to significant process simplification, increased productivity and better cost effectiveness.
Besides the commercially available process, single-step gas-phase oxidation of propane is an alternative pathway to conventional acrylic acid production [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]. Three types of catalyst that have been claimed for acrylic acid production from propane are such as vanadyl pyrophosphate (VPO), mixed metal oxides and heteropoly acids [48]. The common features of these catalytic systems are the use of vanadium-based catalysts with the redox capability and the availability of sufficient catalytic sites in the catalysts. VPO-based catalysts were reported to be sufficiently active but acetone pathway that occurred during subsequent oxidation of acrolein could negatively affect the acrylic acid selectivity. As such, the suppression of this pathway with the use of certain additive in the catalyst formulation is the key towards better formation of acrylic acid. Until recently, the most potential catalytic system for the acrylic acid production through selective oxidation of propane was a composite catalyst based on Mo-V-Te-Nb. It is therefore of great interest to learn more about the stability of this catalyst under variable process conditions.
Table 2 shows some recent research works that have been conducted to investigate this catalytic oxidation with d-block transition metal elements (Mo, W, Pt) and p-block semi-metal elements (Nb, Sb, Te) as the minor additives beside V as active components. These elements were incorporated to manipulate the redox properties of the catalysts with the objective of suppressing the over-oxidation of acrolein. Based on the table, the catalysts’ performance was significantly enhanced through suitable modification procedures and with the presence of additives in the catalyst formulation. Pd was found to improve the catalytic activity and it was attributed to the increase in the propane adsorption sites and enhanced formation of V5+ species [38]. An increase in oxygen mobility by the amorphous WOx resulted in the promotion of the rate-determining step (RDS) of propane oxidation [39]. However, excessive catalyst modification could cause over-oxidation or pore filling of the actives sites which consequently led to poorer acrylic acid selectivities [43], [44]. The sustainability if this synthesis approach is also subjects to the drawbacks of feedstock price hike and insufficient supply of propylene in the coming decades due to other competing processes [49].

Fig. 2 illustrates the proposed oxidation pathway of propane over the Te-VPO catalyst to acrylic acid [50]. In the first step, propane is initially dehydrogenated to propylene to undergo an allylic oxidation reaction to acrylic acid with acrolein acting as the intermediate. Thus, the two critical reaction steps will determine the course of the reaction to affect the acrylic acid yield. Meanwhile, the acetone pathway is undesirable as it leads to the formation of acetic acid as the undesired product and carbon oxides with 2-propanol as the intermediate. Subsequent oxidative reactions of acrylic acid leading ultimately to the formation of carbon oxides are to be avoided as they will have a negative effect on the acrylic acid selectivity. The main challenge in this respect is to suppress the hydration of highly reactive propylene in the presence of water molecules in the reaction system.

As a conclusion, there are many alternative routes for the production of acrylic acid. However, due to the increasing demand for petrochemicals and the depleting oil reserves, the sustainable supply of propylene feedstock in the future is a great concern. Furthermore, propane is more useful as a fuel source than as chemical feedstock. Beside that, groundwater and air contamination issues associated with the non-renewable fuel utilization also pose serious challenges to the acrylic acid production from propylene/propane routes [51]. Hence, a new alternative route that lowers the dependence on fossil-based resources to produce acrylic acid needs to urgently identified. For that purpose, this work is focused on the selective glycerol conversion to acrylic acid by means of an oxydehydration process. The surplus of glycerol in the market could offer a more sustainable and cost effective route to produce acrylic acid. In this respect, advancement in heterogeneous catalyst development also allows multi-functional catalysts for this reaction to be identified and developed.
Mechanism and requirements of glycerol oxydehydration to acrylic acid
The glycerol oxydehydration to acrylic acid is in fact a two-step reaction occurring successively in the same vessel under the same conditions [29], [52], [53]. The presence of a multi-component catalyst having suitable active sites for both reaction steps is therefore essential. Initially, glycerol is dehydrated with the abstraction of hydrogen atom and hydroxyl group from the α- and β-carbon position, respectively to form 3-hydroxypropanal which is a very unstable intermediate. The latter readily undergoes another dehydration step to form acrolein as shown in Fig. 3(a) [29]. These two steps may take place under the same reaction conditions due to similarity in the reaction mechanism that involves the abstraction of one molecule of water each.

Fig. 3. (a) Proposed glycerol oxydehydration reaction pathway [29] and, (b) dehydration pathway for the formation of acrolein from acetol [53].
Dehydration step of stable molecules like glycerol generally requires strong acidic sites such as Brønsted and Lewis acid sites and relatively higher reaction temperature. Reaction temperatures of above 250 °C are commonly reported to initiate this reaction step [13], [53], [54], [55]. However, the temperature window is rather narrow as many organic molecules are thermally unstable at temperatures above 300 °C [44]. It could occur following two different pathways. In the first one (I), the primary hydroxy group is preferentially dehydrated with acetol or hydroxy acetone as the product. The dehydration of the secondary hydroxy group is the other option (II) to yield 3-hydroxypropanal, the subsequent dehydration of which will form acrolein (Fig. 3(b)) [53]. Thus, the right catalyst should favor the formation of 3-hydroxypropanal rather than acetol. In this case, Brønsted acid sites are claimed to be more applicable to the reaction [56], [57]. These acid sites with hydrogen donation capability will favor the abstraction of OH from the β-position which is relatively more stable.
The evidence for the reaction pathway catalyzed initiated by Brønsted acid sites has been demonstrated by Alhanash et al. [38]. They used catalysts with Brønsted acid and Lewis acid sites to achieve glycerol dehydration to acrolein. Direct protonation of the secondary glycerol −OH group in the β-position was found to be mainly catalyzed by Brønsted acid catalyst to produce high acrolein concentration in the reactor. Meanwhile, Lewis acid catalyst evidently activated the terminal hydroxyl groups (α-position) of glycerol and drove the reaction to be more selective towards acetol formation. Several acidic catalysts with high Brønsted acid sites particularly zeolites [58], [59] and heteropoly acids [55], [60] have been proven to be applicable to this reaction step. Meanwhile, mixed metal oxides that are richer in Lewis acid sites are more inclined to form acetol [61], [62]. In this reaction, the catalysts were easily deactivated by carbon deposition [62]. As such, metal oxide composition in the catalyst, if any, should be the minor active component. It is also reported that the types of active species, the acidity of the catalyst and the physicochemical structure of catalyst could significantly affect the acrylic acid selectivity [31].
Acrolein that results from the dehydration step is then partially oxidized to form acrylic acid and this step takes place in the presence of molecular oxygen under limiting condition [63], [64], [65]. A catalyst with limited redox potential is usually required in this step and it is fulfilled in many studies by transition metals due to their mild oxidative capabilities. Highly active species such as noble metals will result in a more complete oxidation reaction. For example, active components based on vanadium oxides can have multiple oxidation states. This property actually enhances the catalyst activity and selectivity towards the oxidation reaction step [66]. For example, the surface oxygen atom is detached from vanadium oxide during acrolein oxidation to eventually produce acrylic acid as well as an oxygen vacancy in V2O5-x. However, the oxygen vacancy is re-established in the subsequent step in which the active sites are re-oxidized due to the presence of O2 in the system (V2O5-x + ½O2 → V2O5). The oxidation states of V5+/V4+ change dynamically during the reaction. In fact, this is an important redox characteristic to be offered by vanadium oxides to participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for the oxidation reaction [67]. In this case, acrolein will chemisorb on the metal sites to react with oxygen in gas phase.
However, some modifications, such as the incorporation of additives, need to be made to the vanadium oxides to make them more efficient for glycerol oxydehydration. Different additives basically have different roles in enhancing the catalytic properties of each catalyst. As an example, the rate-limiting step i.e. the glycerol dehydration step can be reduced by incorporating vanadium/tungsten mixed oxides. This is due to the enhanced acidic properties of the catalyst. Meanwhile, tungsten/molybdenum mixed oxides could alter the catalyst’s redox capabilities. The favorable dynamic change of redox properties of vanadium is in accordance with the requirement of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [68]. Studies on complex oxides based on vanadium are being actively investigated due to their potential to act as an effective catalyst for glycerol oxydehydration.
Besides, several researchers investigated the performance of Mo-V-W as the active catalytic components for the acrylic acid formation from acrolein [69], [70], [71]. Increases in the catalytic activity and acrylic acid selectivity were attributed to the preparation procedure, prevalent phases and the tungsten composition of the catalyst. The formation of the nanocrystalline MoO3-Mo5O14 type oxide system via wet chemical preparations method significantly improved the acrylic acid selectivity. Meanwhile, the total oxidation reaction at temperatures above 400 °C was governed by the triclinic V2O5 oxide [69].
Processes for acrylic acid production from glycerol
Dual-step process
Oxydehydration of glycerol for selective formation of acrylic acid can either be classified into a dual-step process (dehydration and oxidation reactions are carried out successively in two different reactors) and a single-step process (dehydration and oxidation reactions are achieved simultaneously in a single reactor) which is also known as a one-pot process. For the dual-step process, the first reactor is for the dehydration step to acrolein by an acid catalyst while the second reactor is meant for the subsequent controlled oxidation of acrolein to acrylic acid by a metal catalyst. In this approach, high acrolein yield is required in the dehydration step to consider some conversion to other by-products that is likely to occur during the subsequent oxidation reaction step. Dubois et al. [72] and Dubois and Patience [37]) patented a reaction system to convert glycerol to acrylic acid (US 7,910,771 B2 and US 8,212,070 B2). The system was comprised of a continuous process of a reactor with two-stage catalytic processes under two different operating conditions. Whereas considerably high acrylic acid yield was obtained, the mass of catalyst with respect to the feed glycerol was indeed very high (more than 20 wt.%), making the process rather uneconomical.
Similarly, Witsuthammakul et al. [73] employed a dual-step system for the same conversion in which zeolites with different configurations and Mo/V oxides supported on silica were used as catalysts for the selective dehydration to acrolein and its further oxidative reaction to acrylic acid, respectively. About 40% of acrylic acid yield was recorded while an attempt to use a mixed catalyst bed produced a relatively lower acrylic acid yield (∼30%). This was due to the direct glycerol oxidation leading to the formation of undesirable oxygenated C2 products (acetaldehyde and acetic acid). Massa et al. [74] also used consecutive beds of zirconia that were incorporated with W-Nb and W-V-Mo as the active components. The catalysts yielded 44.1% of acrylic acid and 7.8% of acrolein. Nevertheless, almost no acrylic acid was found for the mixed bed of W-V-Mo and W-Nb catalysts. As previously mentioned, this could be due to the direct oxidation of glycerol to other undesired products.
One-pot process
Alternatively, the oxydehydration reaction of glycerol is also achievable in a single reactor or a one-pot process with the presence of bifunctional catalysts (catalysts that have both acid and redox sites). This would be a more interesting approach on the basis of simpler reactor system, better productivity and more cost effective. Currently, the possibility of glycerol conversion to acrylic acid by means of a single-step process has gained a significant research attention. However, the key concern is to get a high acrylic acid yield as it requires a bi-functional catalyst that could simultaneously catalyze dehydration and redox reactions in a single unit. In this case, sufficient amount of Brønsted acid sites is needed to initiate the reaction. However, acid sites are also active in oxidizing glycerol directly considering the usual reaction temperature of above 250 °C [29]. Metal oxides that are supposed to oxidize acrolein can also have certain amount of Lewis acid sites to cause the formation of acetol from glycerol [13], [55]. This will lead to poorer acrylic acid yield. As such, an optimized catalyst in terms of active component composition and the use of the right support should be developed.
Until recently, glycerol oxydehydration reaction using bi-functional catalysts are reported in literature with mixed results. Hence, a catalyst that has good shape selectivity effect towards producing acrylic acid with combined roles to accelerate the dehydration step of glycerol and then to oxidize the acrolein that is formed to acrylic acid should be developed. Besides, the specific functions of different combinations of active elements of the catalysts and support, which could selectively enhance the formation of acrylic acid should be properly understood. To achieve this objective, the back to back oxidation step must be sufficiently fast relative to the hydration step. This is necessary to minimize the possibility of heavy compounds formation by both ketal formation and oligomerization reactions that are made possible due to the presence of the unsaturated aldehyde in the reacting system. The partial pressure of oxygen should also be lower than stoichiometric requirement of the oxydehydration of glycerol into acrylic acid to avoid the formation of undesired oxidative products.
Bi-functional catalysts for a single-step acrylic acid production from glycerol
For a single-step conversion of glycerol to acrylic acid, the dehydration and partial oxidation reaction steps must appreciably occur. The steps should be successive while the direct oxidation reaction of glycerol reaction should be minimized. This application is quite challenging bearing mind the high reaction temperature and the presence of oxygen in the reactor system. In addition, polymerization of acrolein is also made possible due to the presence of acid sites of the catalyst. As such, the type and composition of the active species should be optimal. In general, bi-functional catalysts reported in literature can be generally divided into four types i.e. vanadyl pyrophosphate-based, mixed metal oxide-based, heteropoly acid-based and molecular sieve-based catalysts. On the basis of differences in the types of acid sites and sites as well surface properties, they are discussed separately in the following sections.
Vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts
Vanadium pyrophosphate oxide (VPO) is one of the most recognized pyrophosphate catalysts and has been employed for industrial processes since early 1970s to produce maleic anhydrite from n-butane [48]. In 2009, VPO was the first bi-functional catalyst reported for glycerol oxydehydration, with a rather low yield of acrylic acid. However, the only concern at that time was the transformation of glycerol to acrolein, while a much lesser amount of attention was given to its direct transformation into acrylic acid. The main problems during the dehydration step are the formation of undesired by-products and rapid catalyst deactivation by carbonaceous substances. In 2006, Dubois et al. [66], [75] patented a method to avoid catalyst deactivation (WO 2006087084 and WO2006087083) during glycerol dehydration. Glycerol dehydration reaction was carried out by the introduction of oxygen or air into the reactor system. Coke formation was low since most of it was effectively burnt off during the reaction. A positive effect might as well be posed by the oxygen stream on the reducible catalyst knowing that glycerol is, in fact, a strong reducing agent.
Glycerol dehydration reaction over three VPO catalysts with oxygen-containing feeds has been investigated by Wang et al. [76]. A fixed-bed reactor was utilized to carry out the gas-phase catalytic reaction between 250 and 350 °C. They studied the effects of different parameters such as oxygen to glycerol ratio (0, 1.1, 4.5, 9.1, 13.6), reaction temperature (250, 275, 300, 325, 350 °C) and the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) (20.5, 10.2, 5.1, 2.6) on the activity. It was observed that the addition of oxygen had a positive influence on the catalytic performance since the catalyst could be stabilized at higher oxidization states. Moreover, there was no appreciable formation of coke and the by-product formations were effectively reduced so that the VPO catalyst remained stable structurally throughout the reaction. Among the three VPO catalysts used, a hemihydrate i.e. the VOHPO4 oxide catalyst recorded the best performance with almost complete glycerol conversion and a 66% acrolein selectivity at a temperature of 300 °C. The system also demonstrated only 14% of acetaldehyde selectivity as the main by-product. Whereas the system showed good performance in terms of glycerol conversion, only an acrylic acid yield of about 8% could be demonstrated with an oxygen-rich feed at 350 °C. Thus, they concluded that VOHPO4 had limited ability to drive the oxidative reaction of acrolein to yield acrylic acid. A more active catalyst could be needed to allow the reaction to be carried out at lower temperature to avoid the undesired coke formation as well as the occurrence of direct glycerol oxidation reaction to form oxidative by-products. Table 3 summarizes the performance of some VPO catalysts for glycerol oxydehydration to acrylic acid. As can be seen, despite high glycerol conversions, the yields of acrylic acid were rather low as the main product in this reaction was acrolein.

Wang et al. [77] further modified their hemihydrate VOHPO4 catalysts using a thermal treatment method (500–900 °C). Surprisingly, the acidity of the catalysts, surface morphology, crystallinity and the surface P/V ratio of the catalysts changed accordingly with the specified temperatures. The hemihydrate VOHPO4 catalyst which was treated at 800 °C demonstrated an excellent glycerol conversion of 95% at 64% acrolein selectivity. They also investigated the effect of oxygen addition on the reaction and as expected, the occurrence of by-products was intensely decreased while the coke formation was suppressed. Unfortunately, the acrylic acid yield was still way too poor (1%) in all cases. This proved that VPO had low potential towards a one-pot acrylic acid production process. They also made an attempt to enhance the redox properties of the catalysts by incorporating other metals on the VPO catalysts with mixed results obtained. In general, the low acrylic acid yield for VPO based catalyst could be associated with the insufficient presence of Brønsted acid sites to initiate the reaction to form 3-hydroxypropanal that would be subsequently oxidized to form acrylic acid.
Supported heteropoly acid catalysts
Among other acid catalysts, heteropoly acids (HPAs) have received much research focus for various acid-catalyzed reactions. They possess strong but widely tuneable acidity to be able to catalyze many organic reactions. HPAs can be generally represented by a molecular formula of HnPW11MO40 (M = Ti(IV), Cu(II), Al(III), Sn(IV), Fe(III), Cr(III), Zr(IV) and Zn(II)). Their acidity stems from the ability to act as proton donors (Bronsted acidity) and electron acceptors (Lewis acidity) due to the presence of metal sites in their molecules. The incorporation of external metal elements in place of the exchangeable protons is also possible to manipulate their acid characteristics. However, they may lack in terms of thermal stability and poor porosity which are the reasons for the need to be supported on acidic or neutral carriers [57].
HPA catalysts have gained a lot of research attention as far as glycerol reactions to value-added products are concerned. Researchers have found that supported heteropoly acid (HPA) catalysts also have good potential to catalyze the single-step formation of acrylic acid from glycerol. Researchers reported that the increase in HPA catalysts activity was directly influenced by several factors such as acidity, the interaction between the active catalytic component and support material, dispersion of active phase and pore size distribution [55], [60], [78]. Although they are widely used for glycerol dehydration reaction, investigation on supported HPAs for single-step acrylic acid formation from glycerol is still under intensive investigation [57], [79], [80]. Brønsted acid sites in HPA molecules can theoretically catalyze glycerol dehydration reaction step to 3-hydroxypropanal and subsequently to acrolein while their metal sites can accelerate oxidation reaction to acrylic acid. As such, HPAs can been seen as bifunctional catalysts for this reaction.
Some reported works on the performance of several HPAs supported on various porous materials for the glycerol oxydehydration reaction are summarized in Table 4. In 2013, Thanasilp et al. [79] studied liquid phase oxydehydration of glycerol by HPA supported on alumina (Al2O3) catalysts. This was the first reported work in which glycerol oxydehydration reaction was conducted and effects of three different active compounds i.e. silicotungstic (HSiW), phosphomolybdic (HPMo) and phosphotungstic (HPW) acids on glycerol oxydehydration were investigated. The results indicated that the Brønsted acid strengths of the Al2O3-supported heteropoly acid and oxidative ability of their metal sites played major roles in achieving the good acrylic acid selectivities. Among the used catalysts, 4 wt.% SiW/Al2O3 resulted in an excellent glycerol conversion of 84% with around 25% of acrylic acid yield. Besides glycolic acid, acetic acid was also produced as the major by-product (with 19% yield) which was formed through an undesirable pathway intermediated by acetaldehyde. In general, the strength of acid sites in the synthesized catalysts could be summarized as PW/Al2O3 > SiW/Al2O3 > PMo/Al2O3. On the contrary, the order of oxidative ability of the catalysts was SiW/Al2O3 > PW/Al2O3 > PMo/Al2O3. The results basically indicated that the PMo/Al2O3 catalyst with low acid strength and oxidative ability resulted in poor acrylic acid yield. Meanwhile, PW/Al2O3 catalyst with the highest strength of acidity also led to unsatisfactory yield and it was attributed to the direct glycerol oxidation by the acid sites to undesired by-products. Out of these 3 catalysts, SiWAl2O3 catalyst was the most potential one with an acrylic acid yield of 25.0%.

Next, Thanasilp et al. [80] prepared different types of metal-incorporated SiW/HZSM-5 to perform in the same oxydehydration reaction of glycerol. Specifically, they focused their attention on the effects of different metals such as Ce, Ni, Co, and V that were introduced into SiW at different loadings from 0 to 8 wt.% for the glycerol reaction. HSiW was chosen as the active material on the ground that this acid was reported to have mild acid strength and high oxidative ability which are the basic requirements for the catalyst to be more selective towards acrylic acid. Their observations suggested that acrylic acid was not satisfactorily formed in the case of Co/, Ce/ and HSiW/HZSM-5 catalysts despite reasonably high conversions. In this case, Co and Ce actually promoted the direct conversion of glycerol molecules to undesired oxidative products. Interestingly, the incorporation of 6 wt.% V over SiW/HZSM-5 positively influenced the reaction with a glycerol conversion as high as 98.6% while the corresponding acrylic acid yield was 32.4%. It can therefore, be concluded that V helped increase the oxidative ability of the catalyst while preserving the maximum acid strength (contributed mostly by Brønsted acid sites) of the catalyst that was required to initiate the reaction. They also concluded that the acidity, oxidative ability as well as the pore characteristics of the catalyst needed to be optimized for further process improvement. In their case, HZSM-5 zeolite as a microporous material served the purpose as a support reasonably well to indicate that the internal pore size played an insignificant role in the internal diffusion limitation.
Thanasilp et al. [57] also worked on different support materials of different natures (HZSM-5, SiO2, and Al2O3) with the objective of improving the surface area of the catalyst. HZSM-5 is a microporous material with inter-connecting straight and sinusoidal channels while SiO2 and Al2O3 are typical examples of mesoporous materials with rather random and wide pore size distributions. Similar to that in their earlier work [80], HSiW at a same loading of 20 wt.% was chosen as the main active component so that the effects on the reaction could be attributed to the physical factors of the catalysts rather than chemical. Apart from the acidity of the catalyst, the surface characteristic of the supported catalysts was also found to be influential in affecting the performance of the catalysts. SiW/HZSM-5 catalyst that possessed the highest specific surface area (233.4 m2/g) demonstrated the best activity and selectivity. The highest glycerol conversion of 85.5% with a corresponding acrylic acid yield of 30.6% were achieved. These results actually proved that beside the active component, the characteristics of the support could also play a significant role. Internal diffusion limitation phenomenon was not significantly present in these catalysts to allow the accessibility of the active sites within the internal pores.
As a concluding remark from the recent works on the use of HPA catalysts in glycerol oxydehydration, there is a lot of aspects that can still be studied. HPAs are well known for their tuneable acidity from Brønsted to Lewis acid with the incorporation of metals in place of the exchangeable protons. Specific effects on the reaction with the objective of increasing the acrylic acid yield from glycerol will require further investigation. On top of that, the incorporation of HPA into ordered mesoporous supports such as SBA-15 and KIT-6 might further enhance the performance of catalysts. These innovative supports have high specific surface area, tuneable pore size as well as larger pore sizes compare to the conventional supports such as SiO2 and Al2O3. However, the main drawback of HPA catalysts is their low thermal stability to limit their applicability if catalyst regeneration is to be considered.
Unsupported mixed metal oxides catalyst
Unsupported mixed metal oxides catalysts for glycerol oxydehydration are primarily based on tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum and niobium (W, V, Mo, and Nb) [54], [81], [82]. Details on several catalysts studied for glycerol oxydehydration process using mixed metal oxide catalysts are summarized in Table 5. Generally, they were prepared through high-temperature calcination to convert the metal precursors into oxide forms and to improve their thermal stability. Unlike heteropoly acids, mixed metal oxides do not have a well-defined structure and sometimes they might contain a mixture of multiple crystalline and amorphous phases.

Deleplanque et al. [54] studied unsupported mixed metal oxide catalysts (MoVTeNbO, Mo3VO, and W3VO) for gas phase glycerol oxydehydration to acrylic acid. The results revealed that MoVTeNbO was the most potential catalyst with 99.6% glycerol conversion and 28.6% acrylic acid yield achieved at 300 °C. These catalysts relied on their Lewis acid sites for the initial dehydration reaction step while the oxidation of acrolein to acrylic acid could be effectively performed by those transition metals. The high temperature used was deemed the responsible factor for the high glycerol conversion as direct oxidation could also occur beside the dehydration reaction step. As the evidence, significant yields of the undesired acetic acid by-product by up to 23% were also recorded. They also observed that more acetic acid was formed at higher reaction temperatures. At the same time, considerable amounts of COx were also detected and they were attributed to the deep oxidative decomposition of glycerol as well as the acrolein intermediate.
Wang et al. [77] utilized embedded catalyst systems featuring iron oxide (FeOx) species on the iron orthovanadate (FeVO4) surface with different Fe/V ratios (1.0–2.0). A solid-state synthesis method was employed to prepare the catalyst samples. For comparison, a Fe2O3/FeVO4 catalyst prepared using co-impregnation method was also used. In general, the catalysts showed high activity in converting glycerol but the formation of acrylic acid was rather poor. At a reaction temperature of 300 °C, only 14% of acrylic acid yield was demonstrated by the fixed-bed reactor. The results indicated that all these catalysts were mainly involved in the direct conversion of glycerol to form undesired by-products. However, the formation of acrylic acid was poor due to the absence of sufficient acidity in the catalysts to significantly initiate the reaction step of glycerol dehydration to acrolein.
Elsewhere, Soriano et al. [81] investigated the use of vanadium/tungsten mixed oxides with V/W ratios in the range of 0.12 to 0.24 for the same reaction. Increment in the content of vanadium in the catalyst significantly improved the redox properties of the catalyst, which subsequently increased the conversion of glycerol. However, the highest acrylic acid yield achieved was only 25.0%. A V/W ratio of 0.21 in the catalyst resulted in 25% of acrylic acid yield while that of acrolein was reduced to 11%. The vanadium-free catalyst sample only produced 1% acrylic acid yield with almost 67% acrolein yield. Nevertheless, over-oxidation steps to carbon oxides (COx) were favored with an increase in the content of vanadium to indicate a more significant direct oxidation of glycerol to by-products. The COx yield of the catalyst with a V/W ratio of 0.24 was reported to be at 63%. In short, a delicate balance needs to be established between the acidity and redox properties of the catalyst to ensure high yield of acrolein while preventing over-oxidation reaction steps of the glycerol molecule to form COx.
Chieregato et al. [83] dedicated their work to the same vanadium/tungsten mixed oxides catalyst system, but with the inclusion of niobium in order to improve the acidity of the oxides. Besides minimizing the deactivation of the catalyst, the V4+ oxidation state was deemed to be stabilized with the addition of Nb. At 290 °C, a good acrylic acid yield (33%) was demonstrated with the incorporation of Nb5+ into W/V/Nb mixed oxides with atomic ratios V/(W + V + Nb) = 0.13 and Nb/(W + V + Nb) = 0.13. Thus, the right composition of tungsten and niobium (W/Nb) in the mixed catalyst resulted in an excellent acrolein selectivity (up to 73%), but only about 2.5% of acrylic acid yield was recorded. The decrease in acrylic acid yield was due to the absence of redox properties in the catalyst, which in this case, vanadium oxides.
Chieregato et al. [84] focused their work on the same catalysts of vanadium/tungsten/niobium mixed oxides but further studied glycerol-to-oxygen inlet ratio for the sake of further reaction improvement. With a higher amount of oxygen, the selectivity towards heavy components decreased. The acrylic acid selectivity trend peaked at 39% when the oxygen-to-glycerol molar ratio was set at 12:6. Oxygen was claimed to play a crucial role in facilitating the acrylic acid formation reaction from acrolein oxidation by maintaining a higher concentration of the V5+ species. Thus, it would suppress the acrolein condensation reaction that led to the formation of undesired by-products. However, the acrylic acid selectivity decreased with a corresponding increase in COx yield when the partial pressure of oxygen was above the optimal level.
Shen et al. [82] reported the glycerol oxydehydration reaction in the gas phase of over vanadium/molybdenum and vanadium/tungsten oxides catalysts. The results proved that the presence of V in both oxide catalysts facilitated the occurrence of greater quantities of Mo5+, V4+ and W5+ species compared to the pure oxides of MoO3, V2O5 and WO3. A Mo6V9O40 species was also formed in the V/Mo catalysts (Mo1V0.25) which were directly involved in acrolein oxidation to acrylic acid. A maximum acrylic acid yield of 20.1% was recorded at 300 °C with a corresponding acetic acid yield of 20.8% when Mo1V0.25 catalyst was employed in the reaction. Increasing V content clearly increased the yield of undesired oxygenated products. This was associated with the direct oxidation of glycerol and over-oxidation of acrolein in the reaction by V that has good redox properties. It was also found that the oxidation abilities of the pure oxide catalysts were in the order of V2O5 > MoO3 > WO3.
In their work, Omata et al. [56] used a hydrothermal synthesis method to synthesize mixed oxide catalysts based on W, V and Nb. Their work was focused on the role of V composition and the effect of phosphoric acid addition towards the catalytic reaction. By studying different contents of V in W-Nb-O, the reaction yielded 46.2 % acrylic acid at 300 °C when W2.2V0.4Nb2.4O14 catalyst was used. Meanwhile, V sites could interact with phosphoric acid to be concealed for the sequential oxidation step of acrylic acid leading to higher COx formation. In this work, the acrylic acid yield was remarkably improved to 59.2% when 2.5 wt.% of PO4/W2.2V0.4Nb2.4O14 was used as the catalyst. Thus, the introduction of Brønsted acidity by the phosphoric acid incorporation managed to improve the generation of acrolein to subsequently oxidized by the metal sites to acrylic acid.
In 2017, Rasteiro et al. [30] investigated gas-phase catalytic oxydehydration of glycerol to acrylic acid by Mo-V mixed oxides. A hydrothermal method was employed to synthesize Mo-V mixed oxides catalysts under various synthesis conditions. Effects of temperature (290–350 °C) and feed flow composition (20% O2 in N2, 100% O2, or 100% N2) toward catalytic performance were also evaluated. The results showed that the catalytic performance was directly affected by the change in the arrangement of the crystallographic structure of the active components. The catalysts calcined in an oxidizing atmosphere (100% O2) was found to demonstrate more superior catalytic activity compared to that calcined in inert atmosphere (100% N2). This was due to the abundance availability of O2 during the decomposition of catalytic precursors to result in suitable equilibrium formation of mixed oxide phases containing V4+ and V5+ (MoVO5 and Mo4.65V0.35O14, respectively). The experimental run performed at 320 °C evidently showed the highest selectivity of acrylic acid (33.5%).
Possato et al. [29] also applied a thermal treatment on Mo-V mixed metal oxides to investigate the controlling steps during the synthesis of the catalyst. The result showed that the thermal treatment at 500 °C of the V and Mo precursors of under oxidizing or inert atmosphere caused the formation of 29% of Mo4V6O25 or 61% of MoV2O8, respectively. During the reaction, the MoV2O8 phase was more capable of driving the redox reaction through the involvement of oxygen vacancies in this phase to result in 97% of glycerol conversion and 32 % of corresponding acrylic acid selectivity.
Molecular sieve catalysts
The use of molecular sieves with redox capability such as modified zeolites in conjunction with transition metal oxides to produce valuable chemicals from glycerol could promise certain advantages. H-form zeolites can contain significant amount of Brønsted acidity while the incorporation oxidative metals through ion-exchange or impregnation will improve its redox capability. Table 6 summarizes catalysts performance of metal impregnated zeolite catalysts from previous works. The first attempt in 2013 involved the use of an acidic BEA zeolite impregnated with vanadium for acrylic acid production [53]. The influence of vanadium impregnation (0 wt.%, 5 wt.%, 10 wt.%) on acidity and catalyst texture was demonstrated. The impregnation resulted in slight reductions in the available surface area, but the positive effect on the acidity of the zeolites was detected. Later, Possato et al. [85] studied the catalytic behavior of bi-functional V2O5/MFI catalysts by utilizing two types of vanadium precursor i.e. (VOSO4 (V4+) and NH4VO3 (V5+)). VOSO4 impregnation resulted in better performance than NH4VO3 due to greater dispersion of V2O5, but the selectivity of acrylic acid was rather poor (17%). Vanadium evidently improved the catalyst lifetime and this was associated with its ability to oxidize acrolein to acrylic acid while at the same time favored the oxidation of coke precursors.

Instead of using vanadium, Diallo et al. [39] utilized Fe-BEA catalyst prepared via isomorphous substitution for the same reaction. In this case, the Brønsted acid sites were contributed by the BEA framework while Fe contributed the critical redox properties. It was evident that the incorporation of 4 wt.% of Fe in the framework of zeolite resulted in improved glycerol conversion and it was also favorable to the formation of acrylic acid. The yield of acrylic acid after 8 h of reaction reached 23% at almost complete glycerol conversion. In another study, Possato et al. [29] evaluated the performance of an MFI zeolite based catalyst. The support was prepared by sequential processes of desilication and dealumination to manipulate the framework acidity. The MFI zeolite was also subjected to NaOH and either oxalic acid or HCl treatments prior to impregnation with vanadium oxides. Vanadium was found to be well-distributed over the surface of the zeolite and due to the high pore volume of the zeolite, improved the number of accessible sites to be involved in the reaction was achieved. However, the highest acrylic acid selectivity of only 17% at a near-complete glycerol conversion were demonstrated by their best catalyst.
Gas-phase glycerol oxydehydration was performed by Silva et al. [86] over vanadium impregnated with different zeolite topologies including ZSM-5 (MFI), ferrierite (FER), beta (BEA), Y (FAU), mordenite (MOR), offrerite (OFF), ZSM-11 (MEL) and MCM-22 (MWW). Their characterization results suggested that acrolein production was favored on catalysts with an acid sites density of around 0.8 mmol/g. Among these catalysts, V-MWW and V-BEA showed more superior catalytic performances, with acrylic acid selectivities of about 20%. However, significant coke deposition was also observed for these two zeolites with relatively more open topologies.
Future prospects
Single-step oxydehydration of glycerol to acrylic acid relies on the availability of the right types of acid and metal sites in the catalyst. However, there is a delicate balance between type and strength of acid sites, redox capability of the metal sites and accessibility of the active sites in the catalyst. The types of active component, their composition, support materials used and method of distribution of active components on the support materials will play significant roles in influencing the catalytic activity. Strongly acidic catalyst will also catalyze undesired oxidation of glycerol as well as inducing the polymerization of acrolein while excessive redox capability of the metal sites as well as above stoichiometric oxygen level in the feed may lead to the over-oxidation of reaction intermediates to form other products including COx. As such, the balance between these factors should be evaluated for every combination of catalytic components and tested under varying reaction conditions.
The accessibility of active phases by the reactant and intermediates can also be affected by the support materials and the preparation conditions of the catalyst. Microporous materials such as zeolites in their H-form could have sufficient Bronsted acid sites in their framework to address the need in the initial dehydration of glycerol to acrolein. However, different zeolites will have different acid sites concentration, pore characteristics and metal exchange capacity. The incorporation of metal with high redox potential can create metal sites to be involved in the controlled oxidation of acrolein to acrylic acid. In this case, the right type of metal and the level of incorporation should be known. Transition metals can act as Lewis acid sites to contribute in the formation of asetol as an undesired intermediate. Metals with high redox capability will favor over-oxidation of acrolein to form COx but, interestingly, they also favor coke oxidation to lengthen the life span of the catalyst. Thus, optimization of the catalytic component should be performed in future works.
Rection conditions such as reaction temperature, catalyst loading, oxygen to glycerol ratio can also be manipulated to achieved optimized reaction. Excessively high temperature will favor oxer-oxidation reactions to form undesired intermediates and COx. As such, the catalyst needs to be sufficiently active to allow low reaction temperatures to be used. Oxygen should also be the limiting reactant in the reaction so that a controlled oxidation of acrolein will be achieved to selectively form acrylic acid. Information on this parameter is very limited in literature. As such, more research work should also be dedicated on this aspect to establish a more comprehensive understanding of this reaction.
Conclusions
Bi-functional catalysts are needed for a single-step glycerol oxydehydration to selectively form acrylic acid and the individual and combined roles of those activities should be properly understood and optimized. Acids sites particularly of Brønsted type (proton donors) are particularly useful to initiate the reaction by dehydrating glycerol to 3-hydrohypropanal and acrolein. Subsequently, metal sites of mild oxidative capability (usually d-block elements) will be involved in the controlled oxidation of acrolein to acrylic acid. The presence of semi-metals (p-block elements) in the catalyst composition could be of great help in improving the selectivity towards acrylic acid formation. The balance between the acidity, redox capability and the role of support should be understood and optimized to increase the acrylic acid yield. Bronsted acid sites are more desirable as they favour the dehydration to 3-hydroxypropanal while Lewis acid sites will favour the ketol route. The presence of highly active redox metals such as noble metals could cause direct oxidation of glycerol and decomposition of acrolein to COx rather than the controlled oxidation to acrylic acid.
Meanwhile, low activity of the catalyst will necessitate the use of high reaction temperature to result in the same undesired situation with regards to the selectivity to acrylic acid. Mature understanding on this aspect is yet to be established in literature to justify further investigation. Reasonable conversions of glycerol and acrylic acid yield/selectivity have been demonstrated by mixed metal oxides, supported heteropoly acids, and vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts. However, the yield of acrylic acid is still considered rather low. At present, the potential catalysts reported are Mo-, V-, and W-based multi-component catalysts. Two major drawbacks of W-V-Nb oxides are the oxidation of acrylic acid immediately after formation in addition to the undesired acetaldehyde pathway which produce other undesired products instead of acrylic acid.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
