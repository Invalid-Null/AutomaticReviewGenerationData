The supplied document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on investigating the influence of extraframework aluminum species on the acidity and catalytic activity of faujasite zeolites towards paraffin cracking, specifically using propane as a probe molecule. While propane conversion is examined, the document does not discuss optimizing propane dehydrogenation to propylene or utilizing an oxidative process. The catalysts and results presented are not aimed at maximizing propylene yield through PDH or ODH.
