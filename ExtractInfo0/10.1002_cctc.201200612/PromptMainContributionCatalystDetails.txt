Influence of Extraframework Aluminum on the Brønsted Acidity and Catalytic Reactivity of Faujasite Zeolite
Graphical Abstract
Paraffin cracking by Brønsted acid sites (BAS) in faujasite zeolites is strongly influenced by the presence of nearby extraframework aluminum (AlEF) species (see picture). Although enhanced acidity of faujasites with decreasing framework Al density is directly evident from COads FTIR spectroscopy, H/D exchange reactions, and paraffin cracking activities, such correlations are less evident for AlEF modified zeolites, which is also discussed in terms of structure.
Abstract
A series of faujasite zeolites was modified by extraframework Al (AlEF) with the goal to investigate the influence of such species on the intrinsic Brønsted acidity and catalytic activity towards paraffin cracking. The chemical state of AlEF and zeolite acidity were investigated by 27Al MAS NMR and COads IR spectroscopy, H/D exchange reaction, and propane cracking. Strongly acidic defect-free Y zeolites were obtained by substitution of framework Al by Si with (NH4)2SiF6. In accordance with the next-nearest-neighbor model, the intrinsic acidity of the protons increased with decreasing framework Al density. This increased acidity was evidenced by an increased shift of the OH stretching vibration upon CO adsorption in COads IR spectroscopy and by an increased H/D exchange rate in H/D exchange reactions with perdeuterobenzene. All of the acid sites in these zeolites were of equal strength beyond a certain Si/Al ratio. The increased acidity resulted in an enhanced propane cracking activity. Modification of a model dealuminated Y zeolite by AlEF only resulted in a small fraction of cationic AlEF species, because it was difficult to control the ion exchange process. In comparison, commercial ultrastabilized Y zeolites contained less AlEF and these species were predominantly present in cationic form. The rate of propane cracking strongly correlated to the concentration of Brønsted acid sites perturbed by cationic AlEF species. The results of MQMAS 27Al NMR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of sites perturbed by AlEF and unaffected framework Al sites. Zeolites with higher intrinsic cracking activities contained a higher proportion of perturbed sites. Although COads IR and H/D exchange methods proved to be suitable methods to probe the acidity of Y zeolites free from AlEF, they were less suitable to predict the reactivity if the Brønsted acid sites were affected by cationic AlEF species.
Introduction
Zeolite Y with the faujasite structure is widely applied as an acid catalyst in several important industrial chemical processes such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and hydrocracking.1 The strong acidity and large pores make them ideally suitable for the acid-catalyzed conversion of hydrocarbons. It is generally acknowledged that the Brønsted acidity of aluminosilicates resides in tetrahedral substitutions of Si4+ by Al3+. The Lewis acidity in these cracking catalysts arising from the presence of extraframework Al (AlEF) is also important in determining the final catalytic properties.2–6 The catalytic reactivity of zeolites depends strongly on the concentration and strength of the Brønsted acid sites.6–12 In its as-synthesized form, synthetic zeolite Y with framework Si/Al ratios in the range 2.4–2.9 exhibited only weak acidity and low hydrothermal stability.13 The low acidity of low-silica faujasites is usually explained in terms of a high density of Al substitutions in next-nearest-neighbor positions.14 It leads to a strong increase of the negative zeolite charge, which results in 1) strong binding of the protons (lower acidity) and 2) greater susceptibility of the zeolite framework to hydrolysis (lower stability).
Both the acidity and hydrothermal stability of these materials can be improved by steam calcination, resulting in partial removal of framework Al (AlF). Controlled dealumination of zeolite Y leads to increased hydrothermal stability. Accordingly, these materials are typically named ultrastable Y (USY) zeolites. By adjusting the treatment conditions the Si/Al ratio can be varied to a certain extent. Usually, materials with framework Si/Al ratios ranging from 4.5 to 50 are prepared by use of this approach. Despite the lower AlF density and, accordingly, lower density of Brønsted acid sites (BAS), these USY zeolites usually exhibit much higher acidity compared to the parent low-silica zeolite. This acidity increase is attributed to several factors. First of all, a partial dealumination of the framework reduces the number of paired Al atoms, the isolated AlF giving rise to more acidic bridging hydroxyl groups. Besides this, often part of the aluminum is not completely removed from the zeolitic matrix. These AlEF species occupy cationic positions or are present as intrazeolitic oxidic species.15–17 AlEF species may be present in the zeolite in different forms such cationic Al3+, AlO+, Al(OH)2+, and AlOH2+[18] stabilized at specific cationic sites both in the sodalite cages and in the larger supercages of faujasite. In addition, different neutral species such as monomeric AlOOH, Al(OH)319 as well as aluminum–oxo and hydroxo clusters20–23 and bulk aluminum oxide aggregates13, 24 may occur. The association of the AlEF into an amorphous silica–alumina phase has also been postulated.25
The formation of AlEF species in the zeolite pores is believed to have a positive influence on the acidity of the resulting material. The nature of these AlEF species and how they affect Brønsted acidity of zeolites is an issue of continuous debate. It has been postulated that these ALEF polarize neighboring BAS.26, 27 Theoretical calculations indicate that Al(OH)+2 is the dominant species that increases intrinsic acidity of neighboring BAS.28 Acidity enhancement was also demonstrated for faujasites that contain multinuclear cationic AlEF species.20–22 In a recent study by Iglesia et al.,29 it was alternatively proposed that aluminum oxide aggregates confined in the faujasite supercages decrease the effective void space of the zeolite resulting in a more efficient van der Waals stabilization of the confined reaction intermediates and transition states in hydrocarbon conversion. This view implies that activity enhancement owing to steam calcination is not caused by changes in the intrinsic strength of Brønsted acid sites.
The study of the role of AlEF species on zeolite acidity is hampered by the difficulty to unambiguously identify their structure. Moreover, conventional methods to extract Al from the framework such as steam calcination allow limited control over the fate of the framework Al. It leads to substantial heterogeneity of AlEF species as well as a large number of lattice defect sites. To understand the role of these AlEF species on the Brønsted acidity of faujasite-type zeolites, it would be desirable to have model zeolite catalysts free from defects and containing different Si/AlF ratios to which AlEF species are added. Selective substitution of AlF with Si atoms can be achieved by treating a parent NH4Y zeolite with ammonium hexafluorosilicate (NH4)2SiF6 (AHFS).14 AlEF species can then be loaded onto the zeolite by ion exchange (IE) or incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) procedures. A suitable precursor for aqueous-phase IE is aluminum nitrate.20 It has been successfully applied to low-silica zeolites X and Y without damaging the zeolite framework. The acid strength of BAS in the resulting materials was studied by IR spectroscopy of CD3CN adsorption, whereas the structure of AlEF was analyzed by 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy. It was concluded that the introduction of AlEF species substantially increases the intrinsic acidity of bringing hydroxyls in the Al-exchanged zeolites.
To the best of our knowledge, a systematic investigation of the role of the framework Al density and the presence of AlEF species on the intrinsic acidity and catalytic reactivity of well-defined model catalysts representing the industrial high-silica USY catalysts has not been performed yet. Therefore, we have now investigated AlEF modified faujasite prepared from a set of highly crystalline defect-free faujasite zeolites with Si/Al ratios ranging from 3.2 to 6.7 by IE or IWI of aluminum nitrate. The prepared materials were characterized by means of 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy and FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO. The Brønsted acidity of the resulting materials was investigated by monitoring the selective H/D exchange of acidic hydroxyl groups with C6D6 by IR spectroscopy. This method allowed us to distinguish and quantify BAS of different strength.30–33 The catalytic activity of these zeolites in propane cracking was measured to determine their acid catalytic activity. For comparison, we included the parent ammonium-exchanged zeolite Y and commercial USY zeolites with Si/Al ratios of 8.1, 33, and 85.
Experimental Section
Catalyst preparation
The parent sodium form of Y zeolite (NaY, Si/Al ratio, SAR=5) was purchased from Akzo Nobel. KNO3 and NH4NO3 were purchased from Merck and ammonium hexafluorosilicate ((NH4)2SiF6, AHFS) from Sigma. All chemicals were used without further purification. All manipulations involving AHFS were performed in PFA vessels without exposure of solutions to glass.
NaY was dried in an oven overnight at 110 °C. It was exchanged seven times with a 2 M solution of KNO3 followed by seven times exchange with 1 M solution of NH4NO3 at 80 °C in Erlenmeyer flask equipped with reflux condenser and Teflon coated stirring bar. The sample was then dried in a vacuum oven overnight whilst heating slowly from ambient temperature to 90 °C in 1 h. The NH4Y zeolite was then dealuminated according to a slightly modified procedure of Scheels and Breck,34 which was previously employed by Brett et al.35 The zeolite was suspended and incubated at 80 °C in a 0.5 M ammonium acetate buffer at a weight ratio between zeolite and solution of 0.01. An aqueous solution of AHFS was added to the suspension via a Teflon line connected to a syringe pump at a overall rate of 0.0025 molAHFS molAl−1 min−1. The mixture was allowed to stir for 20 h after all AHFS was added. Thereafter, the zeolite was collected by filtration and dried in the same manner as NH4Y. Different amounts of AHFS were used to vary the degree of dealumination. Three samples with dealumination degrees of 30, 60, and 90 % were prepared, which are denoted AHFSY-30, AHFSY-60, AHFSY-90, respectively.
AlEF was introduced onto the ammonium form of AHFSY-60 by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) or ion exchange (IE). The resulting materials are designated as AlEF–AHFSY–M–x, in which M stands for the preparation method (IWI or IE) and x indicates the concentration of Al(NO3)3 in the solution used for IE or IWI. AlEF–AHFSY–IWI–x zeolites were prepared by impregnating AHSFY-60 dehydrated in vacuum at 120 °C for 16 h with an aqueous solution of 0.1 M or 0.5 M Al(NO3)3 (extra pure, Merck). The pH of the solution was kept at 4. The impregnation procedure was followed by drying at 120 °C for 16 h in vacuum and calcination at 550 °C (heating rate of 2° min−1) in a mixture of oxygen (20 vol %) in nitrogen for 6 h. For IE, the parent AHFSY-60 material was contacted with an aqueous solution of 0.1 or 0.5 M of Al(NO3)3 for 4 h at RT. Ammonium acetate was added dropwise to keep the pH of the solution around 4. The IE zeolites were prepared by either a single or five-fold IE. These zeolites are denoted AlEF–AHFSY–IE(1T)–x and AlEF–AHFSY–IE(5T)–x, respectively. After IE, the zeolites were thoroughly washed with distilled water, dried at 120 °C for 16 h in vacuum followed by calcination at 550 °C.
The ammonium forms of the zeolites were calcined in a mixture of oxygen (20 vol %) in nitrogen at a flow rate of 100 NmL min−1, whilst heating at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 followed by an isothermal period of 6 h to obtain the hydrogen forms of the zeolites. A similar procedure was also applied for the activation of reference steam-calcined USY zeolite (SAR=8.1, 33.1, and 85) kindly provided by Shell.
Characterization of the catalysts
X-Ray diffraction (XRD)
The integrity of the zeolite structure following different preparation methods was characterized by XRD. XRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker D4 Endeavor diffractometer using CuKα radiation with a wavelength of 1.54056 Å. 2 θ angles from 5° to 60° were measured with a step size of 0.077° and a time per step of 1 s. The catalysts were ground and pressed in sample holders for measurements. The Topas software was used to calculate the crystallinities of the zeolite samples from the XRD patterns.
Elemental analysis
The metal content of the as-synthesized materials were determined by elemental analysis conducted with ICP-OES (Spectro Ciros CCD ICP optical emission spectrometer with axial plasma viewing). For the ICP measurements the catalysts were dissolved in a 1.5 mL solution of HF/HNO3/H2O (1:1:1) acid mixture.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
TGA measurements were performed on Mettler TGA/DSC-1 apparatus by using the following conditions: alumina crucibles (70 μL), dry air as a purge gas, and nitrogen as a protective gas with flows of 40 mL min−1 each. In a typical experiment, the temperature was increased from 40 to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1.
Argon porosimetry
Argon sorption measurements were performed at −186 °C on a Micromeritics ASAP-2020 apparatus in static measurement mode. In a typical experiment, a zeolite sample (≈100 mg) was degassed at 350 °C for 8 h prior to the sorption measurement. The BET equation was used to calculate the specific surface area from the adsorption data obtained in the p/p0 range of 0.05–0.25. The volume of mesopores was calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method on the adsorption branch of the isotherm.
Infrared spectroscopy of H/D exchange with perdeuterated benzene
To study the intrinsic acidity of different faujasite zeolites, we employed a methodology recently developed in our group based on the selective H/D exchange of hydroxyl groups in the zeolite upon the reaction with perdeuterated benzene.30–33 The progress of the H/D exchange was monitored in situ by IR spectroscopy. FTIR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Vertex V70v FTIR spectrometer in transmission mode. In a typical experiment, a zeolite sample was pressed into a self-supporting wafer with a density of 5.0–6.0 mg cm−2. The wafer was placed in a controlled-environment transmission cell equipped with CaF2 windows. Prior to recording the spectra, the zeolite was dehydrated in an oxygen flow under heating from ambient temperature to 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The sample was then evacuated at 550 °C for 0.5 h and cooled to RT in vacuum. During this pretreatment, the cell body and the evacuated gas-supply section of the setup were kept at 80 °C to remove any remaining physisorbed water. The final pressure of the cell was lower than 2×10−6 mbar. It has previously been reported that residual water may negatively affect the results of the H/D exchange experiments.
Perdeuterobenzene (C6D6, Aldrich, purity 99.96 %) was dosed into the cell from a glass ampoule with a computer controlled pneumatic valve. The total volume of C6D6 administered to the cell was 0.33 mmol. The sample was exposed to C6D6 for 10 s followed by evacuation for 1 h. Then a next spectrum of the partially exchanged sample was recorded. This sequence was automatically repeated to collect spectra for partially exchanged samples with exposure times of 30 s, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min at 30 °C; 30 and 60 min at 50 °C, 30 min at 100 °C. For each spectrum, 125 scans were accumulated at a resolution of 2 cm−1. Difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the initial spectrum of the dehydrated sample from the spectra after exposure to C6D6.
IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO
The dehydrated catalyst wafer, placed in a controlled-atmosphere transmission cell equipped with CaF2 windows, was cooled by flowing liquid nitrogen through a capillary spiraled around the catalyst wafer. After the temperature of liquid nitrogen was reached, an initial spectrum was recorded. Carbon monoxide (Praxair, 99.999 %) was dosed through a sample loop connected to a six-way valve (50 μL). In this manner, accurate doses of 0.04 μmol CO were administered to the cell. Dosing was conducted by a computer-controlled sequence, in which a spectrum was recorded 15 s after each dose. Each spectrum was recorded by accumulating 64 scans at a resolution of 2 cm−1. Difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the initial spectrum of the dehydrated catalyst from the spectra obtained at increasing CO coverage.
NMR spectroscopy
Magic angle spinning (MAS) 27Al single pulse NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DMX500 NMR spectrometer operating at a magnetic field of 11.7 T. The 27Al NMR frequency was 130 MHz. The 27Al chemical shift was referred to a saturated Al(NO3)3 solution. In a typical experiment, well-hydrated sample (10 mg) was packed in a 2.5 mm zirconia rotor. The sample rotation speed was 20 kHz. Single-pulse excitation was used with a 20° pulse of 1 μs and a relaxation delay of 1 s, which proved alright for quantitative spectra as judged from a few test spectra with longer pulse duration (2 μs) or relaxation delay (2 s). MQMAS spectra were recorded by use of the three-pulse sequence p1–t1–p2–τ–p3–t2 for triple-quantum generation and zero-quantum filtering (strong pulses p1=3.4 μs and p2=1.4 μs at ν1=100 kHz; soft pulse p3=11 μs at ν1=8 kHz; filter time τ=20 μs; interscan delay 0.2 s). Spectra were analyzed by use of the program DM2008.36
Catalytic activity measurements
The acid activity of the zeolites was determined by measuring the rate of monomolecular cracking of propane. Catalytic activity measurements were performed in an atmospheric-pressure single-pass quartz microflow reactor at 590 °C. The feed mixture was delivered by thermal mass flow controllers and consisted of C3H8 (10 vol %) in He (Linde gas) at a total flow rate of 100 mL min−1. The WHSV space velocity was kept at 11.7 h−1. The product composition was analyzed by an online three-column gas chromatograph (Compact GC Interscience) equipped with a PLOT Al2O3/KCl column with a flame ionization detector and Molsieve–5 Å and RTX-1 columns both employing thermal conductivity detectors. The conversion was kept below 2 % to ensure differential conditions. The reaction rate (r) was calculated according to ,
in which X is conversion of propane, F is flow rate in mol s−1 and mcat is the mass of the catalyst in g. Turnover frequencies were computed from this rate and the BAS density determined by H/D exchange.
Results and Discussion
Zeolite composition and H/D exchange activity
The composition of the zeolites prepared by treatment of the parent NaY zeolite with AHFS is shown in Table 1. The use of increasing amounts of AHFS during this treatment led to increasing substitution of Al by Si ions. However, the reaction did not proceed stoichiometrically, and the degree of dealumination was between 61 and 69 % relative to the maximum theoretical value. The expected Si/Altheor ratios of AHFS-treated Y zeolite with dealumination degrees of 30, 60, and 90 % were 4, 8 and 34, respectively. According to elemental analysis, the corresponding synthesized AHFSY-30, AHFSY-60, and AHFSY-90 zeolites had a Si/Al ratio of 3.2, 4.2, and 6.7, respectively. The incomplete dealumination is likely attributable to diffusion limitations of the AHFS reagent into the zeolite crystallites, which would imply that gradients in the Al framework concentration may exist in the treated samples.

[a] AlF/u.c.=107.1(a0-24.238).16 [b] calculated from the value of AlF/u.c. under the assumption of a perfect zeolite framework. [c]  calculated from the results of H/D exchange experiment. [d] calculated from the AlF peak/area ratio in the respective zeolite and AHFSY-30 1 D NMR spectra, see Figure 6 (weight- and scan number corrected). [e] AlEF-modified materials are designated AlEF–AHFSY–M–x, where M stands for the preparation method (IWI or IE) and x indicates the concentration of Al(NO3)3 in the solution used for IE or IWI.
The concentration of AlF can be determined by the faujasite lattice constants (a0) derived from XRD data. Because the AlO bonds are longer than SiO bonds, the unit cells of alumina-rich faujasites are larger than those of lower-silica materials (Table 1). Sohn et al.14 reported an empirical correlation between the number of AlF per zeolite unit cell and its lattice constant. The usefulness of this approach has recently been confirmed by Iglesia et al.29 The concentrations of AlF in HY and AHFSY zeolites estimated with this correlation [c(AlF)XRD] are in good agreement with the total aluminum concentrations determined by the elemental analysis [c(Al)ICP].
In industrial practice, faujasites are stabilized by removing part of the framework aluminum by steam calcination. Unlike dealumination with AHFS, steaming of faujasites will lead to considerable structural and textural changes of the zeolite. The removal of framework Al will lead to silanol-rich defect sites and a variety of AlEF species. Such treatment also leads to the development of additional porosity that may have a beneficial effect on catalytic reactivity.37 To compare the results obtained for the well-defined catalysts models, three commercial ultrastabilized Y zeolites, namely USY-8, USY-33 and USY-85 were also investigated (zeolites 11–13, Table 1). The framework Al atoms constituted only 25–70 % of the total amount of Al in these commercial zeolites. The fraction of non-framework Al increased with increasing Si/Al ratio. The concentration of AlF in USY-8 (3.0 mmol g−1) was very similar to that in the selectively dealuminated AHFSY-60 zeolite (3.2 mmol g−1). This similarity prompted us to focus on the comparison of the acidic properties of these two materials.
Acidic hydroxyl groups of well-dehydrated zeolites can be made to undergo selective H/D exchange if exposed to perdeuterated benzene at not too high temperature.32, 33, 38 The reaction rate depends on the intrinsic acidity of the BAS. The isotopic exchange reaction can be followed by in situ IR spectroscopy.32, 33 Prior to reaction with C6D6, the OH stretching vibrations of HY, AHFSY-30, AHFSY-60, and AHFSY-90 were very similar (Figure 1). The spectra contain bands at 3740, 3631–3640 cm−1 and 3550 cm−1, corresponding to silanol groups and BAS located in the faujasite supercages and sodalite cages, respectively. The position of the high frequency (HF) band around 3631–3640 cm−1 depends on the AlF concentration: higher frequency corresponds to higher acidity for the more siliceous zeolites.

FTIR spectra of dehydrated zeolites a) HY and b) AHFSY-90 before (activated) and after reaction with C6D6 with increasing exposure times at 30 °C followed by the gradual increase of the reaction temperature to 100 °C. Left spectra: OH stretching vibrations; right spectra: OD stretching vibrations. The arrows indicate the evolution of the bands.
In the case of the parent HY zeolite, the H/D exchange reaction proceeded very slowly (Figure 1 a) in agreement with data obtained earlier.32 The isotopic exchange reaction is evident from the decrease of the band intensities for ν(OH) of BAS and the appearance of the related ν(OD) bands at 2680 and 2620 cm−1. The band of the silanol groups is only slightly affected. Exposure to C6D6 at room temperature leads to minor changes in the IR spectrum. Increase of the reaction temperature leads to more substantial exchange as evidenced by the appearance of strong new bands in the region of OD stretching vibrations. Nevertheless, even at a reaction temperature of 100 °C, not all acidic hydroxyl groups could be exchanged. Because of the incomplete exchange, the total number of BAS [c(BAS)FTIR] in HY is somewhat underestimated (Table 1). The deviation of c(BAS)FTIR from the concentration of AlF determined by XRD is however less than 5 %.
As it is shown in Figure 1 b, dealumination of zeolite HY resulted in much faster H/D exchange. The rate of H/D exchange increased with the Si/Al ratio (Table 2, see the Supporting Information, Figure S2). Whereas for AHFSY-30 (no. 2) the major part of acidic protons could only be exchanged upon reaction with C6D6 at elevated temperatures, nearly all these OH groups in AHFSY-60 (zeolite 3) and AHFSY-90 (zeolite 4) could already be exchanged at room temperature (Figure S2). For all three zeolites treated with AHFS, an almost complete exchange was obtained after reaction with C6D6 at 100 °C. The concentration of BAS estimated from these H/D exchange experiments [c(BAS)FTIR] was in very good agreement with the concentration of AlF [c(AlF)] atoms for zeolites 2–4 (Table 1).

USY-8
4.7
The FTIR spectrum of dehydrated USY-8 zeolite was quite different in the region of OH stretching vibrations (Figure 2). In addition to the bands at 3740, 3626, and 3552 cm−1, which were discussed above, the spectrum contained two additional bands at 3696 and 3668 cm−1 attributed to the extraframework AlOx phase, and shoulders at 3605 and 3527 cm−1 were observed for the high-frequency and low-frequency bands of BAS in super- and sodalite cages. The bands at 3605 and 3527 cm−1 are usually assigned to BAS polarized by Lewis acidic AlEF species.32 Already at room temperature, almost all OH stretching bands related to BAS disappeared upon reaction with C6D6. This is indicative of the high acidity of these zeolites. Different from the AHFS treated zeolites, the total acidity [c(BAS)FTIR] of USY-8 was substantially lower than its concentration of AlF [c(AlF), Table 1]. This finding implies that in USY-8 part of AlEF was present as cationic species compensating for the negative zeolite charge.

The concentration of AlF in USY-8 was very similar to that in the selectively dealuminated AHFSY-60 zeolite. To investigate the influence of AlEF on the acidity of faujasites, a series of model zeolites (AlEF–AHFSY) was prepared by introducing AlEF onto AHFSY-60 by IE or IWI of an aqueous Al(NO3)3 solution at two concentrations. The total Al concentration in these modified AlEF–AHFSY did not depend strongly on the method of Al introduction and the concentration of the Al(NO3)3 solution (Table 1). For zeolites 5–9, c(Al)ICP was (6.2±0.2) mmol g−1. Only for zeolite 10 the amount of Al was higher. In all cases, the introduction of AlEF did not result in significant changes in the lattice parameters of the zeolites, which points to very minor changes in the concentration of AlF. This result is consistent with the small variations in the crystallinity of these IE and IWI zeolites (see the Supporting Information, Table S1). Only for the sample prepared by IE in a concentrated solution of aluminum nitrate, a substantial decrease of c(Al)F was observed. This result points to partial dealumination of the lattice. Nevertheless, the AlF concentration was back to its original value upon repeated IE, which suggests reversibility of the mild dealumination.
The partial decomposition of the zeolite framework upon introduction of AlEF was also evident from the Ar physisorption data (see the Supporting Information, Table S2). The BET surface areas and pore volumes of samples 5 and 7 were very close to those of the parent AHFSY-60 zeolite (3). Only the mesoporous surface area was affected by the IWI treatment in the case of zeolite 5, which suggests the formation of larger aluminum oxide particles at the external surface of the zeolite. The introduction of AlEF by IE affected both micro- and mesoporosity of zeolite 7. The former effect could be attributed to the presence of AlEF species in the zeolite micropore, whereas the presence of mesopores in this sample was likely a result of the partial dealumination of the framework. If the catalysts were prepared by multiple IE procedures (zeolite 8) or by using more concentrated Al(NO3)3 solutions (zeolites 5, 9, and 10), the overall porosity strongly decreased, evidencing more significant damage to the zeolite lattice.
The introduction of AlEF into AHFSY-60 by IWI inhibited the H/D exchange reactivity, suggesting a decrease of the intrinsic acidity of the zeolitic BAS. The development of the IR bands attributed to the OD bridging groups upon C6D6 reaction of AlEF–AHFSY–IWI–0.1 M and AlEF–AHFSY–IWI–0.5 M (Figure 3 a and b, respectively) was notably slower than for the parent zeolite (see the Supporting Information). The inhibition of the H/D exchange was more pronounced in the former sample. The results were very different if the catalysts were prepared by IE (representative spectra are shown in Figure 4). All four zeolites showed a much higher reactivity towards H/D exchange (Supporting Information, Figure S3). The reactivity was even higher than that of the most dealuminated AHFSY-90 zeolite. The development of the OD bands was somewhat slower for AlEF–AHFSY–IE(5T)–0.5 M than for the other three zeolites exchanged with aluminum nitrate. Among the model zeolites, the IE samples generally exhibited the highest level of exchange of BAS with AlEF species. The total amount of BAS reacted with C6D6 was lower than the number of the AlF atoms. Despite this, there appears to be no clear correlation between the number of BAS substituted with extraframework cationic species and the severity of the IE procedure.

The differences in the intrinsic acidity of the zeolitic protons can be estimated by making first-order plots of their disappearance rate (Figure 5). The first-order H/D exchange rate constants (kH/D) at 303 K are listed in Table 2. Similar to our previous study,32 we monitored the changes in the intensity of the high-frequency ν(OD) band, which is related to the content of BAS in the faujasite supercages. This approach was justified by the fact that BAS were directly involved in the H/D exchange reaction. In line with the discussion above, the exchange rate gradually increased with decreasing AlF concentration. Whereas the difference in reactivity of the parent HY and AHFSY-30 was relatively small, the reaction rate was much higher for AHFSY-60 and AHFSY-90 (Figure 5 a). For the latter, the exchange rate was an order of magnitude higher than for the parent HY (Table 2). The difference between AHFSY-60 and AHFSY-90 was moderate, which is in line with previous proposals on the influence of paired (next-nearest-neighbor) AlF sites on the intrinsic acidity.4, 14, 15, 39, 40 The effect of ALEF on the intrinsic acidity of model zeolites depended on the preparation method. The introduction of AlEF in AHFSY-60 by means of IWI (AlEF–AHFSY–IWI–0.1 M and AlEF–AHFSY–IWI–0.5 M) led to a substantial decrease in the H/D exchange rate compared to that of the parent zeolite (Table 2). On the contrary, the intrinsic acidity of the zeolites prepared by IE (AlEF–AHFSY–IE(xT)–y M) appeared to be much higher as evident from the strongly increased exchange rate. For all IE samples two distinct regimes of H/D exchange could be distinguished. Initially, the H/D exchange rate was approximately as fast as for USY-8. After prolonged exchange, however, the reaction slowed down and the rate was similar to what was observed for the parent AHFSY-60 zeolite. This result points to heterogeneity in the strength of the BAS. Clearly, only a portion of the original BAS in AHFSY-60 was enhanced by the presence of cationic AlEF species. This trend was similar for USY-8 zeolite with the difference that the rate in the second regime remained higher than observed for the model IE samples.

27Al MAS NMR characterization
To obtain more insight into the nature of Al centers, we employed 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy to all zeolites. In Figure 6, 1D single-pulse-excitation and 2D multiple-quantum magic-angle-spinning (MQMAS) 27Al NMR spectra are shown. All 1D spectra are dominated by the signal of Al with tetrahedral oxygen coordination at ≈60 ppm, which is generally associated with AlF. The 1 D 27Al NMR spectra of zeolites 5–13 contain additional weak signals at ≈0 ppm of octahedral Al (AlEF). The AlF peak areas were normalized to the Al content of AHFSY-30 (4.6 mmol g−1). For this sample, the methodologies based on ICP, XRD, FTIR, and NMR techniques gave the same number of AlF centers. The AlF content correlated well with the BAS density derived from H/D exchange monitored by IR and the AlF content determined by lattice spacing changes. Thus, we assume that the 27Al NMR spectra are quantitative in the sense that all AlF is NMR visible.

In contrast, the AlEF signals were smaller than expected. More precisely, the ratios between the peak areas of octahedral and tetrahedral Al in the modified zeolites were much lower than expected from the differences between the total Al content determined from ICP and the AlF density (see Table 1). Consequently, we infer that AlEF in zeolites prepared by IWI, IE, or steaming is largely NMR invisible under our measuring conditions (27Al NMR frequency: 130 MHz; 20 kHz MAS rate). As is well established, second-order quadrupolar interactions of Al nuclei with local electric field gradients can broaden the 27Al MAS NMR signal of Al with lower or distorted coordination symmetries beyond detection.41
Close inspection of the AlF signals of the zeolites revealed that those of modified zeolites are asymmetrically broadened compared to the symmetric lineshapes of the Al signals of the unmodified AHFSY and HY zeolites. Interestingly, the zeolites with the strongest asymmetric broadening (zeolites 5 and 10–13) also have the highest activity towards propane conversion (see below). To investigate the nature of this line broadening, 2D MQMAS 27Al NMR spectra were recorded for zeolites 2–13 (Figure 6). Such MQMAS experiments enabled us to distinguish between two types of line broadening. On the one hand, line broadening caused by quadrupolar coupling to local electric field gradients (resulting from nearby cationic species or coordination–symmetry distortions) appeared as “horizontally” elongated lineshapes in the 2D spectrum. This is illustrated by the AlEF lineshapes in the MQMAS spectra of IWI-prepared zeolites 5 and 6. Chemical heterogeneity, on the other hand, was reflected by resonance lineshapes that are elongated in a direction parallel to the 2D spectrum diagonal. All of the zeolites prepared by IWI and IE, except the most mildly IE treated zeolite 7, showed diagonally elongated tetrahedral lineshapes. Notably, also the MQMAS features of the octahedral signals of the IE prepared zeolites 8–10 differed from those of the IWI prepared zeolites 5 and 6. Thus, the MQMAS spectra yielded a characteristic fingerprint of the type of preparation used.
To get more detailed information we first simulated the observed tetrahedral and octahedral Al signals in the MQMAS spectrum by single Czjzek lineshapes.42 This type of lineshape assumes a Gaussian distribution of chemical shifts and quadrupolar coupling constants with center values and distribution widths that can be adjusted in the lineshape-fitting procedure.36, 42 Czjzek lineshapes fit well to the tetrahedral signals of zeolites 2–4 without AlEF and the octahedral signals of zeolites 5–10 with AlEF (Figure S4 and Table S3 in the Supporting Information). The MQMAS signals of tetrahedral Al of all zeolites with AlEF could not be well described by single Czjzek lineshapes. Instead, these lineshapes were successfully decomposed into the (fixed) narrow lineshape of tetrahedral Al in AHFSY-30 (zeolite 2) and an additional Czjzek lineshape with an adjustable, broader distribution of chemical shifts and quadrupolar coupling constants. The physical interpretation of this bicomponent lineshape model with two AlF types is that AlEF species affect only the local chemical environment and electric field gradients of nearby AlF but leaves the environment of more distant AlF undistorted and thus practically the same as in the AHFSY zeolites 2–4 without AlEF. Such interpretation is in line with earlier MQMAS 27Al NMR spectra of La(x)NaY, in which the partial exchange of Na+ by cationic La species was observed to cause distortion of part the AlF sites.43 Like in the previous MQMAS study of La(x)NaY, the 27Al NMR signal of perturbed AlF in our AlEF–AHFSY zeolites was shifted a few ppm upfield relative to the unperturbed AlF signal. Detailed analysis of the MQMAS spectra permitted estimating the size of the quadrupolar coupling, which reflects the (average) electric field gradient at the Al positions. This quadrupolar coupling is similar (≈2 MHz) for the unperturbed Al sites in AlEF–AHFSY and La(x)NaY. In contrast, the quadrupolar coupling of the distorted AlF fraction in AlEF–AHFSY (3–4 MHz) was less than in La(x)NaY (≈6 MHz), indicating less strong electric field gradients in AlEF–AHFSY.
Infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed CO
IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO can probe the presence and strength of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites in aluminosilicates. At low temperature, CO forms a hydrogen-bonded complex with the surface hydroxyl groups. The Brønsted acidity of the latter determines the strength of the interaction in the adsorption complex. Consequently, this strength can be probed by monitoring the perturbations of the associated CO and OH stretching vibrations [ν(CO) and ν(OH), respectively]. Hydrogen bonding with CO results in the low-frequency shift of ν(OH) and a high-frequency shift of ν(CO). These shifts increase with the increase of the acidity of Brønsted acid sites. Besides, interaction of CO with Lewis acid Al3+ sites also results in distinct shifts of the CO stretching frequencies, usually stronger than those in CO–BAS complexes.
In Figure 7, representative FTIR spectra in the ν(OH) and ν(CO) regions recorded during progressive CO adsorption on zeolites 1–3 are shown. The frequencies of the perturbed OH (ν′(OH)) and CO (ν(CO)) stretching vibrations are listed in Table 3. In agreement with previous reports,30 CO adsorption on the weakly acidic HY led to perturbation of the high-frequency OH band at 3640 cm−1, which is attributed to BAS located in the supercages, and a ν(CO) band at 2174 cm−1. The red-shift of the OH stretching band was 272 cm−1. Because CO cannot access the small sodalite cages, the low-frequency OH stretching band at 3550 cm−1 was not influenced by CO. The higher intrinsic acidity of the selectively dealuminated AHFSY zeolites 2 and 3 was evident from the larger red-shift of the high-frequency OH band with decreasing AlF concentration (Table 3). The position of ν(CO) for all of the AHFSY model zeolites 2–10 was similar. This set of zeolites showed only small differences in the red-shift of ν(OH) upon CO perturbation. In these spectra there was no indication for splitting of the shifted OH modes by a Fermi resonance with the second excited state of δ(OH) as observed for H-ZSM-5.44 Surprisingly, COads IR spectroscopy did indicate strong differences in the Brønsted acidity of AlEF-modified zeolites (see Table 3). Only at relatively low CO coverage, minor differences could be observed that vanished at higher CO coverage. At low CO coverage, Δν(OH) was significantly larger for zeolite 6 than for all of the other zeolites (Table 3). It should be stressed that the spectra of the dehydrated zeolites before H/D exchange did not contain signature bands of enhanced BAS as reported earlier for the USY zeolites 11–13.32 The COads IR spectra of these zeolites did not evidence the presence of significant amounts of Lewis acid sites. This indicates that the dispersion of this AlEF phase was relatively low and AlEF species were predominantly located in the sodalite cages and, therefore, not accessible to CO. On the contrary, the COads IR spectra of USY-8 showed significant amounts of accessible Lewis acid sites.32, 33

3.4. Catalytic reactivity
Monomolecular cracking of propane at 590 °C was used as a test reaction to evaluate the acid catalytic activity of the zeolites. In Table 4 the activity results are collected. The overall reaction rate, the rates of propane cracking (ethylene and methane as the main products) and of propane dehydrogenation (propylene and hydrogen as the main products) and turnover frequencies (TOF) per acid site (determined by H/D exchange FTIR) are also given. In line with its low intrinsic acidity, zeolite 1 (HY) had the lowest activity. Dealumination by AHFSY treatment led to a strong increase of the catalytic activity (zeolites 2–4). An increase in an order of magnitude of the rate of propane conversion and, accordingly, TOF was already observed for the mildly dealuminated AHFSY-30 zeolite. A further decrease of the AlF content in zeolite 3 led to a further increase of TOF. The slightly higher acidity of zeolite 4 (90 % dealumination) compared to that of zeolite 3 (60 % dealumination) translated into a pronouncedly larger TOF. Interestingly, the replacement of AlF by SiF led to a significant increasing in the cracking rate and only a relatively small increase in the rate of dehydrogenation. It is also observed that with increasing dealumination of the framework the contribution of cracking to the overall conversion increases. The TOF values of zeolite 11 (USY-8) are significantly larger than those of the AHFSY-treated zeolites. Both the cracking and dehydrogenation activities were significantly higher. These results suggest that accessible Lewis acidic AlEF sites are directly or indirectly involved in propane activation. More extensive dealumination (zeolites 12 and 13) resulted in a strong decrease of the cracking and dehydrogenation rates. The TOF values for USY-33 and USY-85 zeolites were much larger than those for USY-8. Notably, also in n-heptane hydroconversion AHFSY-60 and AHFSY-90 exhibited equal activities per proton, which were five times higher than the activity of AHFS-30. This difference corresponds very well to the observed difference in propane cracking rates. The hydroconversion activity of USY-8 was approximately four times higher than that of AHFSY-60 and AHFSY-90.

[a] Rate of cracking. [b] Rate of dehydrogenation. [c] Calculated as the rate of propane converted per BAS.
The changes in the rate of propane dehydrogenation by IE and IWI samples 5–10 were much smaller than by the USY zeolites (Table 4). Unlike USY zeolites 11–13, the model zeolites 5–10 contained much fewer accessible Lewis acid sites as evidenced by COads IR. Despite this, the results indicate a positive effect of AlEF on the rate of propane cracking. Typically, TOFs of the IE and IWI zeolites were higher than those of the parent zeolite 3, but lower than of the USY zeolites. The results show that the propane cracking rate does not correlate with the intrinsic acidity of BAS in AlEF-containing materials as determined from the H/D exchange experiments. Although the IWI zeolites showed a lower rate of H/D exchange than zeolite 3, they are much more active in propane cracking.
Relation between acidity and catalytic activity
Finally, we will discuss the above results with emphasis on the relation between the acidity as probed by the various characterization techniques and the catalytic reactivity. The acid sites in HY and the AHFS dealuminated zeolites behaved uniformly as follows from the kinetic plots of the H/D exchange reaction. In all zeolites, all Al atoms were within the zeolite framework and NMR visible. The concentration of BAS was determined by H/D exchange FTIR and XRD analysis. The BAS in HY had the lowest intrinsic acidity as probed by H/D exchange FTIR. As expected, at a Si/Al ratio of 3.2 (zeolite 2) the AlF sites still experience the influence of next-nearest-neighbor AlF, so that the bridging hydroxyl groups are of lower intrinsic acidity than those in zeolites with higher Si/Al ratios. Indeed, zeolites 3 and 4 with Si/Al ratios of 4.2 and 6.7 were significantly more acidic than zeolite 2, as probed by H/D exchange FTIR, and the difference between the former two was relatively small. It is interesting that these differences were not evident from comparison of the stretching frequencies of CO adsorbed to these BAS. The small variations in the CO stretching frequency as a function of the strength of the OH⋅⋅⋅CO complex were attributed to the high CO bond energy, and, therefore, the CO stretching frequency could not be used to adequately compare acidities of these zeolites. Nevertheless, ν(CO) was lowest for HY (2174 cm−1) and increased to 2177 cm−1 for zeolite 2 and to 2178 cm−1 for zeolite 3, which had the lowest Al content. In comparison, the variations in the stretching frequency of the perturbed OH groups (ν′(OH)) were larger and, therefore, allowed us to better discriminate acidity differences. Qualitatively, the differences probed by H/D exchange FTIR were similar to those probed by ν(OH). These acidity differences were also apparent from the catalytic activities in propane conversion. The overall propane reaction rate (per g) for the AHFSY zeolites was an order of magnitude higher than that for the parent zeolite HY. For HY the rates of propane cracking at 590 °C and propane dehydrogenation were almost similar, but removal of AlF resulted in a more than tenfold increase of the cracking rate (per g), whereas the rate of propane dehydrogenation was enhanced much less. As a consequence, the dominant reaction products were ethylene and methane for the AHFSY zeolites. TOFs for propane conversion (per BAS) for AHFSY-30 were significantly higher than those of the parent HY zeolite. With decreasing AlF content, TOFs increased further. In the absence of other differences, we relate this trend to the increasing intrinsic acidity per BAS. As these three AHFSY zeolites are free from an AlEF phase, we can exclude effects of entropy on the apparent reaction rate as suggested before.29, 45, 46 It is striking that diluting AlF in the zeolite framework, which is associated with a higher intrinsic Brønsted acidity, predominantly led to a strong increase of the cracking activity and only slightly influenced the dehydrogenation activity. This may suggest that different sites are involved in dehydrogenation and, specifically, we cannot exclude that a small amount of defect sites such as AlEF may be responsible for dehydrogenation. It should be noted here that calcination of the HY sample was performed under deep-bed conditions (a larger amount of catalyst was used because of its low activity), so that it cannot be excluded that some dealumination did take place. Such conditions did not occur in the H/D exchange FTIR experiment.
Before discussing the structure–activity relations of the model zeolites 5–10, we briefly compare zeolites 1–4 with the commercial USY zeolites. The catalytic activity of USY-8 was much higher than that of AHFSY-60. Although the total Al content of these zeolites was very similar, the number of BAS as probed by H/D exchange FTIR was much lower for USY-8. As the concentration of AlF was also quite similar, it is reasonable that a substantial fraction of the protons in USY-8 were replaced by cationic AlEF. From Figure 5 a it follows that the intrinsic acidity of the remaining protons was much higher in USY-8 than in the AHFSY zeolites. The kinetic plot indicated a distribution in the intrinsic acidity of the BAS, but in Figure 5 only the HF(OH) signal is concerned. The bands at 3608 and 3526 cm−1 in the spectra of USY-8 represent these enhanced sites.27, 32, 33 These BAS react much faster with C6D6 than the regular sites suggesting an order of magnitude higher acidity of the enhanced sites.32, 33 From COads IR, it was also evident that the BAS in USY-8 were more acidic [ν(CO)=2180 cm−1 and Δν(OH)=360 cm−1].47 In this respect, it should be mentioned that Δν(OH) of the perturbed sites was even larger (416 cm−1) for USY-8. Accordingly, it is not straightforward to firmly conclude on the reason for the increased activity of this zeolite. On the one hand, the much higher intrinsic acidity of the few enhanced sites may significantly contribute to the increased catalytic activity, as suggested before for alkane hydroisomerization.32, 33 On the other hand, the regular BAS in USY-8 also were significantly more acidic than those in the model AHFSY-60 sample. In any case, it can be stated that the presence of a large number of cationic AlEF species results in increased acidity of most of the BAS. Finally, the relative rate of propane dehydrogenation was higher in USY-8 than in AHFSY-60. This is in line with the above suggestion that Lewis acid sites are involved in propane dehydrogenation. The USY-33 (zeolite 12) and USY-85 (zeolite 13) zeolites contained much less BAS, which were more acidic than the acid sites in USY-8. Because of the relatively low Al content in the framework, it is not straightforward to calculate the fraction of anionic exchange sites occupied by AlEF, but at least USY-33 seemed to have a similar proportion of such sites to USY-8.
In the case of zeolites 5–10 (AHFSY-60 loaded with AlEF by IE or IWI procedures), it first has to be pointed out that none of the IR spectra of these samples exhibited clear signatures of enhanced BAS, which have been typically reported to be present in USY zeolites. Using ν(CO) as a criterion, the AlEF containing zeolites 5–10 were of nearly equal acidity. Comparison of the red -shift of ν(OH) also showed that most of these zeolites should have similar or even weaker acidity (for samples treated with more concentrated Al(NO3)3 solutions) than their parent AHFSY-60 and substantially lower acidity than USY-8. An exception is AlEF-AHFSY-IWI-0.5 M, the acidity of which appeared to be more similar to that of AHFSY-90. Although all of these zeolites contained a higher amount of AlEF than USY-8, the fraction of cationic AlEF [obtained by subtracting c(BAS)FTIR from c(AlF)XRD] was much lower than in the commercial USY zeolite. About 85 % of the AlEF in USY-8 was cationic, whereas this fraction was below 20 % in the IE and IWI zeolites 5–10 except for zeolite 10 (55 %). Accordingly, we concluded that the majority of the AlEF species in zeolites 5–9 were present as neutral clusters either in the micropores or on the external zeolite surface. This reflects the difficulty in ion exchanging the bridging hydroxyl groups in a defined and controlled manner. However, the kinetic plot in Figure 5 b revealed a large spread in the intrinsic acidities of the zeolites. The intrinsic acidity of the BAS in the IWI zeolites was much lower than those in AHFSY-60. Conversely, the intrinsic acidity of the IE zeolites was similar to or higher than that of USY-8. This pronounced difference between IWI and IE samples indicated that the AlEF phase is different in these two sets of zeolites.
It can be seen from Table 4 that there is no systematic variation in the catalytic activities of these zeolites. Clearly, loading AlEF onto the AHFSY-60 zeolite resulted in higher intrinsic activities for propane cracking in nearly all cases. The higher activities were not caused by the lower concentration of BAS, implying that there is a synergetic effect owing to the presence of AlEF. The dehydrogenation activities also showed some variation, but to a lesser extent, and the promotional effect of AlEF was much less pronounced. In some cases, the dehydrogenation activity was similar to that of the parent AHFSY-60 zeolite. A closer look at the differences in the cracking rates revealed that the synergetic effects correlate to the amount of cationic AlEF. For instance, the activity of zeolite 5 was about 60 % higher than the parent zeolite, whereas that of zeolite 6 was not enhanced at all. The difference was owing to the much higher amount of cationic AlEF species in zeolite 5. The low amount of cationic AlEF in zeolite 6 could be caused by precipitation of aluminum hydroxide at the high Al3+ concentration during IWI. Overall, there was no correlation between the cracking activity (per BAS) and the total amount of AlEF. However, the amount of cationic AlEF species weakly correlated to the activity (not shown). In Figure 8, the propane cracking activity (per BAS) against the ratio of the cationic AlEF and the BAS is shown. Perturbation of BAS by a small amount of cationic AlEF already led to a substantial increase of the cracking activity. At higher ratios the activity did not increase significantly, likely because most of the BAS were already affected by the cationic AlEF species. Notably, this plot does not contain data for USY-33 and USY-85 because these two zeolites appeared to behave quite differently, and despite their relatively low amount of AlEF, their intrinsic cracking (and dehydrogenation) activities were much higher than those of the IE, IWI, and USY-8 zeolites. On the one hand, from Figure 8 it can be suggested that an increasing perturbation of the few acid sites in these strongly dealuminated zeolites might lead to increased activity. Accurate determination of the concentration of cationic AlEF is hampered by the very low concentration of AlF and BAS. On the other hand, it may also be speculated that only the strongest BAS remain intact after extensive removal of AlF from these zeolites.

It should be pointed out here that the NMR results also indicate a perturbation of some of the AlF sites by AlEF. Although MQMAS is a highly informative NMR approach, it is not quantitative. This is reflected in Figure 6 by the differences between 1D spectra and the horizontal projections of the MQMAS spectra. To estimate the densities of unaffected and distorted AlF sites in the zeolites, we therefore analyzed the 1D NMR spectra by using the Czjzek lineshape parameters from the MQMAS lineshape analysis (see the Supporting Information, Figure S4 with only peak heights as adjustable fit parameters). This yielded the relative fractions of perturbed and unperturbed AlF sites, which, at the given total AlF density, could be translated into densities of unaffected and perturbed sites (see the Supporting Information, Table S3). The densities of perturbed AlF sites correlated to the ratio of the amounts of cationic AlEF and BAS in the same way as the catalytic activities of the corresponding zeolites. These trends fortify our conclusion that AlEF affect the catalytic performance of proximate AlF sites in the cracking of propane.
In summary, the present results show that the acid catalytic activity of faujasite zeolites is determined by 1) the AlF density and 2) the presence of cationic AlEF. Concerning the effect of the density of AlF, our data on selectively dealuminated Y zeolite confirm the well-known next-nearest-neighbor model, which states that isolated BAS are intrinsically more acidic than the paired sites. The increased acidity of diluted BAS was confirmed by the results of COads IR as well as the increased rate of H/D exchange with C6D6. In catalytic terms, it is evidenced by the increased rate of propane cracking. Our data show that the ratio of monomolecular propane cracking over propane dehydrogenation strongly increases with increasing acidity. This finding remains unexplained. The second finding of our study is that the acid catalytic activity towards propane cracking is strongly increased by perturbation of the catalytically active Brønsted acid sites by cationic AlEF species. Loading a model AHFS-treated zeolite with Al3+ predominantly results in AlEF in the form of lowly dispersed aluminum oxide clusters instead of cationic AlEF species, except if multiple exchange by a relatively concentrated aluminum nitrate solution is used. The concentration of cationic AlEF species in these model zeolites was significantly lower than that in a commercial ultrastabilized zeolite. Interestingly, it is similarly difficult to obtain highly dispersed cationic extraframework Fe species in Fe/ZSM-5 by IE procedures. The extraction of atomically dispersed Fe from isomorphously substituted [Fe]ZSM-5 can be achieved by steam calcination.48, 49
Despite the clear positive influence of cationic AlEF species on the paraffin cracking activity of BAS, the physicochemical characterization did not evidence their increased intrinsic acidity in all of these modified zeolites. The COads IR data pointed to a quite uniform acidity of zeolites 5–10 similar to that of the nonmodified parent zeolite, whereas the H/D exchange kinetic plots suggested that the acid sites in some of the zeolites are much stronger than in the parent zeolite, yet weaker in some of the others. We will briefly discuss these apparent differences in terms of the particularities of the various methods employed to characterize Brønsted acidity. In Scheme 1 the key intermediates underlying a) low temperature CO adsorption, b) H/D exchange with perdeuterated benzene, and c) propane cracking is shown. Probing the acidity by adsorption of CO provides information about the shape of the potential energy surface for the deprotonation of the zeolite BAS for close-to-equilibrium OH distances. This limitation is caused by the very weak hydrogen bonding in the OH⋅⋅⋅CO adsorption complex (Scheme 1 a). In the absence of stabilizing effects of the chemical environment, we assume that the more shallow the potential energy surface is near the energy minimum, the lower is the deprotonation energy. This relation was clearly observed in the increasing red-shift of the acidic OH group upon CO adsorption on selectively dealuminated zeolites, but not for the catalysts that contain BAS perturbed by AlEF. The rate of H/D exchange with C6D6 correlated to the stabilization of the polarized transition state (Scheme 1 b): the increased dipole moment upon stretching of the OH bond may be stabilized by interaction with AlEF species. The basicity of the zeolite framework may play a significant role in this particular case. It is therefore expected that the enhancement of the dual-site hydrogen bonding and electrostatic stabilization of the contact ion pair in the transition state decreases the activation barrier for H/D exchange. These interactions, either indirect electronic effects or direct physical stabilization, will critically depend on the nature of the AlEF species and may therefore be at the origin of the very different effects observed depending on the method of Al3+ loading. Solvation effects originating from the decreased size of the zeolite cages containing AlEF species are not likely in this case, but cannot be excluded either. In contrast, propane activation proceeds through (nearly) complete deprotonation of the bridging hydroxyl group in the transition state leading to the formation of a carbonium cation and a negatively charged zeolite framework (Scheme 1 c). This clearly contrasts the case of H/D exchange of perdeuterobenzene, which is more closely related to carbenium ion chemistry. Accordingly, it is reasonable to consider paraffin cracking, which requires the most substantial stretching of the O⋅⋅⋅H bond among the methods discussed here, as the most reasonable probe for Brønsted acidity in the classical sense, namely the ability of a compound to lose a proton. The present data confirm the earlier suggestion that cationic AlEF species withdraw some negative charge of the framework O atom to that a nearby proton binds and therefore stabilize the anionic part of the transition state.50–52 This interpretation contrasts the view that the heat of reactant adsorption dominates rate differences in cracking.53

4. Conclusions
A series of faujasite zeolites modified by extraframework aluminum (AlEF) was prepared with the goal to study the influence of AlEF on the acidity and catalytic activity towards paraffin cracking. The zeolites were investigated by 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy, COads IR, the rate of H/D exchange of acidic hydroxyl groups with C6D6, and monomolecular cracking of propane. By selective substitution of framework Al by Si through treatment with (NH4)2SiF6, the Si/AlF ratio of zeolite Y was varied between 3.2 and 6.7. Such samples were free from AlEF. In accordance with the next-nearest-neighbor model, the intrinsic acidity of the protons in these materials increased with decreasing framework Al density. Their increased acidity was evident from the increased shift of OH stretching vibration upon CO adsorption as well as from the increased H/D exchange rate. All of the acid sites were of equal strength. The increased acidity resulted in enhanced activity in propane cracking. The rate of the alternative propane dehydrogenation reaction did not increase as much as that of propane cracking.
AlEF species were introduced onto the model dealuminated faujasite with a Si/Al ratio of 4.1 by incipient wetness impregnation and ion exchange with Al(NO3)3 solutions. The state of Al, their intrinsic acidity and catalytic activity in propane cracking were compared against those in commercial ultrastabilized Y zeolites with a similar Al content. The modification of the strongly acidic model Y zeolite by AlEF resulted only in a small fraction of cationic AlEF species stabilized at the exchangeable sites of the zeolite. It was difficult to control the ion exchange with Al3+. Despite commercial ultrastabilized Y zeolite contained less AlEF, they are predominantly present as cationic species. For AlEF containing zeolites, the rate of propane cracking correlated strongly with the concentration of BAS perturbed by cationic AlEF. The higher is the ratio of cationic AlEF and BAS, the higher is the rate of propane cracking. The results of MQMAS 27Al NMR spectroscopy allowed us to discriminate the unaffected AlF sites and those perturbed by neighboring AlEF. It is demonstrated that the zeolites containing a higher proportion of such perturbed sites exhibited higher catalytic cracking activity.
Although COads IR and H/D exchange methods were suitable methods to probe the acidity of Y zeolites free from AlEF and showed good correlations with the catalytic cracking activity, they were less suitable to predict the reactivity if the BAS are affected by cationic AlEF species. We propose that depending on the nature of the protonated complex, the promoting effect of AlEF can vary substantially.
