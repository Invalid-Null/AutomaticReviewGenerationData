The given document does not contain any information about propane dehydrogenation catalysts or processes. It mentions a membrane reactor for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide any details about the catalyst used. Since the key information about the catalyst composition, performance metrics, and enhancements is not present, I have indicated that the document is not relevant for the detailed assessment requested.
