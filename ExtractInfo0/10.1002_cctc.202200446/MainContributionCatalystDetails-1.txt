 Unfortunately, based on the information provided, it does not appear that any of the documents discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. All of the documents focus on the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes and 1,3-butadiene, with no mention of propane or propylene production. Since none of the documents are relevant to propane dehydrogenation, I cannot provide a synthesized summary in the requested XML format. Please provide documents that contain information pertinent to propane dehydrogenation so I can summarize their key findings in a unified XML output.
