Catalytic Dehydrogenation of Ethane over Mn Oxide Supported on Zeolite Chabazite
Graphical Abstract
A new Mn-containing chabazite zeolite is prepared by incipient wetness impregnation for ethane dehydrogenation. Mn2O3 nano particles form on the external surface of chabazite zeolites and are responsible for the high reactivity and selectivity. Moreover, this strategy is also applicable when the catalyst is used to catalyze propane dehydrogenation or when Mn is supported on other zeolites (MFI or BEA).
Abstract
A new class of Mn-containing zeolites prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) have been found to catalyze the ethane dehydrogenation reaction with high selectivity (98 %+). Preparation by IWI leads to the formation of Mn2O3 nanoparticles on the external surface of the zeolite crystals and herein is shown that the primary active sites for the reaction are located on the surface of these particles. Propane dehydrogenation is also successfully catalyzed by this catalyst. Other Mn-zeolites (MFI and BEA) also have high reactivity and selectivity towards light alkane dehydrogenation.
Introduction
The industrial production of ethylene via steam cracking is the second largest greenhouse-gas-producing process of the chemical industry (behind ammonia synthesis) and efforts to reduce the magnitude of these emissions require the development of catalysts that can carry out this reaction with high selectivity, stability, and low cost.1 Given the scale of this industrial process-millions of tons per year-it is also important that new catalysts are prepared from non-toxic, abundant, and inexpensive ingredients. We have discovered that Mn-containing chabazite zeolites prepared via the incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) technique are exceptional catalysts for the ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) reaction. This contrasts with materials prepared by ion exchange that show modest reaction rates towards EDH.
This report shows that upon IWI and calcination, Mn2O3 nanoparticles form on the external surface of the chabazite (CHA) zeolites, and that these particles are responsible for the EDH properties observed on these materials. During the EDH, the Mn2O3 nanoparticles are partially reduced and the surface of these partially-reduced particles contains the catalytic sites. The role of the zeolite is two-fold: i. stabilizing the formation of the manganese oxide nanoparticles during calcination; and ii. stabilizing these particles against aggregation and over reduction during the EDH reaction. These results are surprising because manganese is not prominent among the metals often investigated in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. These findings are an opportunity to broaden the scope of manganese oxides in dehydrogenation chemistry and of zeolites and other aluminosilicates as supports of nanoparticle oxide catalysis.
Results and Discussion
The addition of Mn in chabazite clearly increases the reaction rate of EDH, especially in the Mn−CHA prepared via incipient wetness impregnation (Mn−CHA−IWI, see Table 1 & Figure 1). With the same Si/Al ratio of 6 and Mn/Al ratio of 0.3, Mn−CHA−IWI has a higher reaction rate (2.52 mmol/gcat/hr) than that prepared via ion exchange (Mn−CHA−IE, 1.15 mmol/gcat/hr) (Table 1 & Figure 1). The higher activation energy of Mn−CHA−IE (158 kJ/mol) compared to Mn−CHA−IWI (120 kJ/mol) is also consistent with this difference in reactivity (Figure S1). Besides, Mn−CHA−IWI (6, 0.3) also has higher ethylene selectivity (97.2 %) than Mn−CHA−IE (6, 0.3) (92.4 %), highlighting the differences in reactivity of samples prepared using IWI and IE (see Figure S2a).

Specific reaction rates of EDH over Mn−CHA−IE and Mn−CHA−IWI with different compositions. (Reaction temperature=600 °C, 25 mL/min of 22 % C2H6/He, P=1 atm).
The optimal Mn/Al ratio for Mn−CHA−IWI is 0.7, as the specific EDH rate increases with the Mn/Al ratio from 0.3 to 0.7 but decreases when the Mn/Al ratio is increased further to 1. A similar trend is also observed in Mn−CHA−IE, but all rates are lower than the Mn−CHA−IWI samples with the same compositions (see Figure S3a). For both Mn−CHA−IWI and Mn−CHA−IE, C2H4 selectivity is higher than H−CHA and increased with the Mn/Al ratio, possibly due to a concomitant reduction in the number of Brønsted acid sites (BAS) in the samples (Table 1, Figure S2a & S3b) since BAS catalyze EDH with lower selectivity.2 All the Mn-containing CHA samples have a very high carbon balance of over 99 % (see Table 1, Figure S2b & S3c). After regenerating via air oxidation, the Mn−CHA−IWI sample shows a slight decrease but still high reaction rate as well as >98 % C2H4 selectivity (Figure S4).
Gallium ion-exchanged in zeolites such as H-ZSM5,3 have been widely investigated for EDH and indium-exchanged CHA zeolites have been recently reported to catalyze EDH selectively.4 At the same metal/Al ratio of 1, Mn−CHA catalysts have similar C2H4 generation rate of over 1.0 mmolC2H4/molmetal/s as Ga−CHA but ∼7 times higher than In−CHA (Figure S5a). In addition, even though the C2H4 selectivity of Mn− and Ga−CHA are over 98 %, the carbon balance of Mn−CHA is higher than Ga−CHA (Figure S5b & c). Mn−CHA−IWI (6, 1) also has comparable specific reaction rate (14.34 mmol/gcat/hr) to Cr2O3/Al2O3 (39.03 mmol/gcat/hr) with the similar metal loading.5 The C2H4 generation rate (10.68 mmol/gcat/hr) of Mn−CHA−IWI (6, 1) is also comparable to that of PtSn/Mg(Al)O (36 mmol/gcat/hr) and higher than Pt/Mg(Al)O (3.6 mmol/gcat/hr) at the same conditions.6 Mn has then comparable reactivity to Pt and Cr-based catalyst and is thus a promising alternative.
The unique role of the CHA zeolite as catalyst support is illustrated by comparing the properties of these materials to Mn supported on other oxides (SiO2 & Al2O3) using the same Mn loading (10 wt.%) and incipient wetness impregnation method. Among these three samples, Mn−CHA has the highest reaction rate (8.1 mmol/gcat/hr vs 4.2 mmol/gcat/hr for Mn−Al2O3 and 1.60 mmol/gcat/hr for Mn−SiO2), underlining the key role of CHA zeolite in forming the active sites (Table 1 & Figure S6a). In addition, Mn−CHA also has the highest C2H4 selectivity (98.6 %) and high carbon balances (99.6 %). Both Mn−Al2O3 and Mn−SiO2 also have high carbon balance (99.1 % and 100 %, respectively), however, this is mostly because of their low activity (Table 1, Figure S6b & c).
SEM images and XRD patterns of the Mn−CHA samples (IWI & IE) help elucidate the origin of the difference in catalytic reactivity. Both samples have an average particle size of ∼800 nm, close to that of the initial H−CHA zeolite. The images reveal the formation of nanoparticles (∼20 nm) on the surface of the zeolites in Mn−CHA−IWI, but not in Mn−CHA−IE samples (Figure S7). For both samples, the introduction of Mn into CHA expands the zeolite unit cell dimensions as confirmed by a shift of XRD peaks to lower angles (i. e., higher d-spacings); while no new diffraction peaks are observed in the XRD patterns (Figure S8).
When supported on SiO2, the manganese oxide particles observed in the SEM images are much larger (∼100 nm) than is observed on the Mn−CHA samples (Figure S9a and S9b). Mn-containing particles could not be distinguished from Al2O3 with SEM (Figure S9c and S9d). New peaks are observed in the diffraction patterns of both Mn−SiO2 and Mn−Al2O3, among which the peaks at 28.7° and 37.0° can be assigned to Mn3O4 while the peaks at 42.7° and 56.7° can be attributed to the presence of MnO2 (Figure S10).7
Higher magnification TEM images also reveal the presence of nanoparticles on the surface of Mn−CHA−IWI, with an average size of ∼20 nm, while no particles are visible on the surfaces of H−CHA and Mn−CHA−IE (Figure 2a & Figure S11). Those particles have a lattice distance (d-spacing) of 0.27 nm that can be assigned to the (222) planes of Mn2O3 (Figure 2b).7 That is, Mn is likely to be present on the surface of CHA in the form of Mn2O3 nanoparticles after calcination of the samples. For Mn−CHA−IE, most Mn ions are exchanged with protons and are present in the form of [Mn−OH]+ with Mn in the oxidation state +2 inside of the CHA zeolite pores; in this case, the CHA zeolite displays a clean surface.

a)–c) TEM images; d) Mn 3 s scan spectra from XPS; e) UV/vis spectra of Mn−CHA−IWI (6, 0.7) sample before and after EDH.
FTIR spectra of the IWI and IE samples support this observation. After D2 treatment of the H2 treated Mn−CHA−IE, the peak at 3660 cm−1 disappears and a new peak at 2692 cm−1 is observed, but after H2 treatment again, the peak at 2692 cm−1 disappears and the peak at 3660 cm−1 recovers (Figure S12a & b). This evidences the H−D exchange of the −OH groups on the catalyst surface. For In−CHA, In−OD was reported to be at 2689 cm−1 while Si−OD and Al−OD are at 2747 and 2663 cm−1, respectively.8 Therefore, the bands at 2692 and 3660 cm−1 are assigned to Mn−OD and Mn−OH bands, respectively, confirming the existence of Mn−OH in the Mn−CHA−IE sample. Similar phenomena are observed in Mn−CHA−IWI, indicating that there is partial ion exchange of Mn (II) to form Mn−OH, although much of the Mn is present as oxides on the surface (Figure S12c & d). The broader bands at 3660 and 2692 cm−1 may be attributed to the co-existence of Mn−OH, BAS and manganese oxide particles.
The introduction of Mn with different methods and compositions also results in changes in micropore volume (Figure S13 & Table S1). All Mn−CHA samples show a reduction in micropore volumes compared with the H−CHA support (0.34 cm3/g) as a fraction of the Mn inevitably diffuses inside of CHA zeolite pores. However, Mn−CHA−IE has a lower pore volume (0.26 cm3/g) than Mn−CHA−WI (0.33 cm3/g) because most of the Mn in Mn−CHA-−IE is inside of the pores in the form of Mn−OH; while in Mn−CHA−IWI, most of Mn are outside of the pores, forming Mn2O3 particles. With the increase of Mn loading amount, the pore volume of Mn−CHA−IWI samples also decreased as more Mn species are now present inside of CHA pores.
The Mn species on the external surfaces of SiO2 and Al2O3, are in the form of Mn3O4 and MnO2 particles according to XRD patterns, structures consistent with the lattice distances determined from TEM images (Figure S14). The introduction of manganese then forms particles of manganese oxides on the surfaces of all the oxide supports but their structures are dependent on the support type. The different Mn2O3 nanoparticles formed on Mn−CHA−IWI, together with its higher activity, indicate that the CHA zeolite promotes the formation of Mn2O3 particles on the external surface and the +3 oxidation state of Mn is key to its higher activity for EDH.
During EDH, Mn2O3 particles on Mn−CHA are progressively reduced into MnO, a process that parallels a reduction in the EDH rate. MnO particles are, in fact, observed on the surface of spent Mn−CHA samples (Figure 2c). The reducibility of Mn−CHA samples is evaluated using H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR): Mn-−CHA−IWI samples have two peaks in the TPR profiles (Figure S15), which are due to a two-step reduction of Mn2O3, i. e., Mn2O3→Mn3O4 and Mn3O4→MnO.9 With the decrease of the amount of Mn, the peak intensity and area of H2 consumption decrease. The Mn−CHA−IE sample, however, shows no H2 consumption peaks since most of the Mn is present inside of the CHA pores as isolated cations. These cations, with the oxidation state of +2, could not be reduced further. TPR analyses of the spent Mn−CHA−IWI (6, 1) after EDH, hardly reveal any H2 consumption in the TPR profile, verifying the reduction of Mn2O3 nanoparticles during EDH. The Mn−CHA−IWI after reduction has a lower reaction rate (40 %) for EDH than the non-reduced sample (Figure S16). These results show that the Mn2O3 particles on the exterior of the Mn−CHA samples are the location of the active sites, and that the decreased reaction rate is mainly due to the reduction of the number of accessible Mn3+ during reaction.
The oxidation state change of manganese from +3 to +2 in Mn−CHA−IWI before and after EDH was investigated using XPS. Two multiplet split peaks can be observed in Mn 3 s spectra due to the coupling of non-ionized 3 s electron with 3d valence-band electrons. The magnitude of this peak splitting (ΔE) can be used to identify the Mn oxidation state.10 The existence of Mn2O3 nanoparticles in the fresh Mn−CHA−IWI sample results in a ΔE of 5.3 eV, which can be assigned to Mn3+ (Figure 2d). After EDH, the value of ΔE increases to 6.1 eV, consistent with a smaller oxidation state of Mn to +2 during EDH. A satellite feature is also observed at ∼648 eV in the Mn 2p spectra after EDH, also indicating the presence of MnO (Figure S17). These results are consistent with the hypothesis above, i. e., Mn2O3 particles formed on the external surface of CHA zeolites are reduced during the reaction, which is likely the ultimate reason for deactivation.
The formation of Mn2O3 on Mn−CHA−IWI leads to two bands at 320–380 nm and 470–550 nm in the diffuse-reflectance UV/vis patterns, while Mn−CHA−IE shows no signal at these two positions due to the negligible amount of Mn3+ species present in it (Figure S18). The band of 320–380 nm is related to the O2− to Mn3+ electronic transition, while the 470–550 nm band is assigned to the Mn3+ d-d transition.11 The band intensity of Mn−CHA−IWI also decreases with the decrease of Mn loading, as was also observed in the TPR patterns discussed above (Figure S15). After reduction, the intensities of the two bands decrease due to the reduction of Mn2O3 and meanwhile, a new peak at ∼420 nm appears, which is ascribed to MnO (Figure 2e). For comparison, the UV/vis pattern of the spent Mn−CHA−IWI after EDH was also collected: this pattern displays the two bands at 320–380 nm and 470–550 nm but with lower intensities, as well as a smaller peak at ∼420 nm, indicating the partial reduction of the particles during EDH.
Based on the results and discussions above, it is proposed that there are two types of Mn species in Mn−CHA−IWI. One type is Mn2+ present in the form of Mn−OH on the micropores inside (and outside) the CHA crystals, while the other is the formation of Mn2O3 particles anchored to the external surface of CHA zeolites (Figure 3). Due to the unique surface of the CHA zeolite, Mn−OH present on the external surface of CHA favors the formation and stabilization of Mn2O3 nanoparticles. For Mn−CHA−IE, however, Mn species only appear inside the CHA pores with the oxidation state of +2, replacing Brønsted acid sites and forming Mn−OH moieties (Figure S19). As Mn−CHA−IWI shows a much higher reaction rate than Mn−CHA−IE, the Mn2O3 nanoparticles are presumed to be the key active sites for EDH. When ethane molecules approach the Mn2O3 nanoparticles, they are transformed into ethylene together with H2 co-production. Overtime, the Mn2O3 nanoparticles are reduced into MnO, leading to a reduction in reaction rate. The charge of the Mn−OH species does not change since they cannot be further reduced under the conditions investigated here (Figure S20).

Schematic of Mn−CHA−IWI structure. Mn species exist in two forms: (1) Mn−OH inside or on the surface of CHA zeolite; (2) Mn2O3 particles on the surface of CHA zeolite. The −OH groups in the inserted image are omitted for structure concision.
For Mn−CHA−IWI with different Si/Al ratios, the turnover frequency (TOF) increases from 1.3 to 2.3 mmolC2H6/molMn/s with the increase of Si/Al ratio from 6 to 12 and 21 although the C2H4 selectivity decreases slightly from 98 % to 96 % (Figure S21). This can be rationalized by the dispersion of Mn species which may be influenced by surface silanols and Mn−OH groups on the exterior of the zeolite crystals.12 CHA zeolite with higher Si/Al ratio tends to have more surface silanols and a lower concentration of Mn−OH, which reduces agglomeration of Mn species, yielding a more disperse system with higher stability on the surface.
These manganese-oxide-based catalysts can also catalyze EDH when supported on other zeolites with larger pores (MFI: 5.1 Å ×5.6 Å and BEA: 6.6 Å ×6.7 Å vs CHA: 3.8 Å ×3.8 Å).13 With the same Si/Al and Mn/Al ratios of 12 and 1, respectively, all the samples have high TOF and C2H4 selectivity (∼97 %), as well as near 100 % carbon balance (Figure S22). This structural adaptability expands the potential scope of these materials. In addition to EDH, Mn−CHA−IWI also catalyzes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction. When compared with Mn−CHA−IE and other supports of ZSM5, SiO2, and Al2O3, the Mn−CHA−IWI still shows the highest dehydrogenation rate of ∼11.3×10−7 molC3H8/gcat/s and the highest C3H6 selectivity of ∼94 % (Figure S23). It is also found that the optimal Si/Al ratio is 12, having the highest dehydrogenation rate of ∼7.5×10−7 molC3H8/gcat/s and the highest C3H6 selectivity of ∼91 % (Figure S24). This Mn−CHA−IWI catalyst is thus promising for further alkane dehydrogenation reactions.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a new catalyst of manganese oxide supported on CHA has been prepared via the incipient wetness impregnation method (Mn−CHA−IWI) and used to catalyze EDH for the first time. Extensive characterizations of the samples show that, unlike Mn−CHA prepared via ion exchange (Mn−CHA−IE), in Mn−CHA−IWI, Mn species are not only present inside the CHA pores in the form of Mn−OH, but also outside the crystal, on the external surface of CHA in the form of Mn2O3 nanoparticles where Mn is in the oxidation state of +3. Since Mn−CHA−IWI has higher reaction rates and higher selectivity than Mn−CHA−IE, it is concluded that Mn2O3 particles are the key active sites for ethane conversion. In other words, EDH is catalyzed primarily outside the zeolite pores on the Mn2O3 particles. The influence of Mn loading (Mn/Al ratios: 0.3–1) and the support (CHA, Al2O3, SiO2) were also investigated: among these samples, Mn−CHA−IWI with a Mn/Al ratio of 0.7 is shown to have the fastest specific reaction rates.
Higher Si/Al increases the effective TOF due to better a dispersion of Mn species but led to lower C2H4 selectivity. PDH has also been successfully catalyzed over Mn−CHA−IWI, extending the potential application of these materials. When CHA zeolite is replaced with other zeolites such as MFI and BEA, the supported manganese oxides show high EDH rates as well, suggesting new stable and selective catalysts await to be discovered. This type of catalyst, manganese oxide supported on zeolites, offers an opportunity for alkane dehydrogenation catalysis with high activity and low cost. The reactivity of the catalyst described herein could be further improved by optimizing particle size, morphology, and surface composition.
Experimental Section
Catalyst Preparation
NH4-CHA zeolite samples with Si/Al ratio of 6 were obtained from ACS Material LLC. NH4-CHA with Si/Al ratios of 12 and 21 were synthesized according to previously reported procedures.14 NH4-MFI (CBV2314) and NH4-BEA (CP814E) zeolite samples with Si/Al ratio of 12 were obtained from Zeolyst. Prior to preparation, all zeolite samples were calcinated at 550 °C for 10 hours in flowing air with a ramping rate of 2 °C/min to obtain the acid form of the zeolite (H-CHA, H-MFI, H-BEA). Mn−CHA with various Mn/Al ratios were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) and ion exchange (IE) with aqueous solution of manganese (II) nitrate tetrahydrate (Sigma Aldrich).15 γ-Al2O3 (powder) and SiO2 (silica, G-6) were obtained from Alfa Aesar and Fuji Silysia, respectively. γ-Al2O3 and SiO2 supports were calcinated in flowing air at 600 °C for 8 hours by heating at a ramp rate of 2 °C/min to remove any residual water. Mn−Al2O3 and Mn−SiO2 with the same mass loading amount (10 wt.%) as Mn−CHA (Si/Al=6, Mn/Al=1) were prepared also using incipient wetness impregnation. The resultant Mn−CHA, Mn−Al2O3, and Mn−SiO2 samples were dried at 80 °C for 12 hours, followed by calcination at 550 °C for 10 hours in flowing air with a ramping rate of 2 °C/min. To identify the various samples succinctly, catalyst samples are designated as Mn−CHA-method (Si/Al ratio, Mn/Al ratio). For example, Mn−CHA prepared via incipient wetness impregnation method with Si/Al and Mn/Al ratios of 6 and 1 respectively is represented as “Mn−CHA−IWI (6, 1)”.
Catalyst Characterization
The Si/Al and Mn/Al ratios were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis (Galbraith Laboratories, TN) and Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis on Zeiss Auriga 60 High Resolution Focused Ion Beam & Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), which was also used to obtain the SEM images of the samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2010F. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using a Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA). N2 adsorption isotherms were collected on a Micromeritics 3Flex system. Before N2 adsorption, the samples were degassed at 300 °C for 12 hours. The micropore volumes of samples were determined by N2 adsorption and the t-plot method. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was performed under a 10 % H2/Ar atmosphere while the amount of H2 consumption was monitored (Micromeritics AutoChem II). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected using a Thermo Fisher K-Alpha+ system. Ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) spectra of the samples were collected from UV/Vis spectrometer (Jasco V-550) with a diffuse reflectance attachment. Reflectance measurements are converted to the Kubelka–Munk function:

where R is the ratio of the diffuse reflectance of the sample to that of a reference material (BaSO4, Sigma Aldrich), K is the absorption coefficient, and S is the scattering coefficient.
Catalytic Rates and Catalyst Evaluation
Catalysts were tested for ethane or propane dehydrogenation in a fixed-bed plug-flow microreactor with a 6.35 mm (1/4 inch) diameter quartz tube. Typically, 50 mg of the sample (20–40 mesh) was placed in the reactor and the catalyst bed was supported by quartz wool plugs at the top and bottom. A thermocouple was placed right below the bottom quartz wool plug inside the reactor quartz tube. There was no detectable catalytic activity with the empty reactor at the reaction temperatures investigated. After loading, the sample was heated up to 600 with a ramping rate of 10 °C/min in 50 mL/min of He. Then, 25 mL/min of 20 % C2H6/He was fed into the reactor to quantify ethane dehydrogenation rates. Apparent activation energies were determined in the temperature range of 590–630 °C using 50 mL/min of 10 % C2H6/He, which were measured under low conversions (<10 %) that were far from equilibrium conversion. The reactor effluent was periodically sampled using an online gas chromatograph (GC) (Agilent 7890B) with a restek ShinCarbon column (80486-810901) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for product analysis. The conversion and reaction rate of C2H6, selectivity of C2H4, and the carbon balance were determined using Eq. S2 to S5, respectively.
