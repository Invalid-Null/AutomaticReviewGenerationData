1. Introduction
Propylene is not only one of the largest-volume petrochemicals but also a valuable feedstock for the petrochemical industry. Propylene is produced primarily either as a coproduct of ethylene manufacture or as a by-product of petroleum refining. Also it is additionally produced through a propane dehydrogenation as a key on-purpose propylene production route, in order to meet the regional demand and market supply-demand balance. Several process technologies are currently available for catalytic propane dehydrogenation including the CB&I Lummus CATOFIN process, UOP’s Oleflex process, Uhde’s STAR process, the Linde/BASF process, and the Snamprogetti-Yarsintez process [1]. Yet the demand for a new dehydrogenation technology, which can efficiently supply the sufficient heat needed for endothermic reaction and can continuously regenerate the catalyst in order to maximize the propylene production rate, has remained unsatisfied [2], [3], [4].
Several schemes have been proposed in relation to the above technical issues, but recently, many researchers have focused on a two-fluidized circulating bed process using oxide catalysts as an oxygen carrier [5], [6]. A commonly-known continuous system employing two-fluidized bed reactors in a dehydrogenation reactor-regenerator assembly is the Snamprogetti process. Because the process is carried out in a catalytic fluidized bubbling bed, it is known that the residence time of the catalyst particles should be more precisely controlled to maximize olefin yield and to preserve catalyst life [7].
Our group has investigated an oxide catalyst in a circulating fluidized moving process with oxygen looping system in which the catalyst is continuously circulated from reactor to regenerator. In detail, the catalyst as an oxygen carrier and propane feed contact each other at the reactor bottom without an additional oxidizing agent and then the catalyst rises quickly to the reactor top. The residence time in the reactor riser is determined by the gas velocity and physical properties of the catalyst. Since the gas velocity is higher than the catalyst terminal velocity Ut, as in a FCC process riser, the residence time is in the range of a few seconds. The reduced catalyst on which coke is deposited is separated from the unreacted propane and products including propylene in a stripper by stripping steam. In regenerator, the heat for endothermic dehydrogenation reaction is supplied to the catalyst through coke and extra-fuel burning, and oxygen vacancy of the catalyst is simultaneously refilled. The regenerated catalyst is sent back to the reactor bottom in order to contact propane feed. Because the catalyst is circulated continuously through the repeated redox cycle and exposed for a long time in a high-temperature regenerator, one of the most important technical issues for realizing this proposed reaction scheme is a stable and durable catalyst with high propylene selectivity.
With regard to continuous production of propylene, the dehydrogenation of propane over oxygen carrier catalyst in gas phase oxygen free environment has been widely studied [8], [9], [10], and many researchers have mentioned that the redox mechanism of the oxygen carrier catalyst follows the Mars-van Krevelen redox cycle [11]. C-H bond of the chemisorbed propane on catalyst surface is initially activated by lattice oxygen. Then, α-hydrogen of the propane is abstracted to form propylene, water, and anion vacant site. The anion vacancy is then filled by migration of adjacent lattice oxygen, and subsequently, the catalyst is reoxidized by an external oxygen source.
Keeping the above mechanism into consideration, we have investigated chromium oxide supported on alumina and zirconium-modified alumina to achieve stable and selective propane dehydrogenation in oxygen free environment. The effect of zirconium addition on CrOx/Al2O3 has already been studied for a long time. However, most studies have been focused on the change in olefin yield in the fixed-bed propane dehydrogenation processes or on the catalyst deactivation caused by coke deposition [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. That is, available information about irreversible catalyst aging during reduction-oxidation cyclic operation for circulating fluidized moving process with oxygen looping system is very limited. Only a few researchers have focused on the durability and propylene selectivity of chromium oxide catalysts which can be applied to the fluidized moving bed. Song [21] and other researchers [19], [20] reported the effect of cerium or zirconium addition on the lattice oxygen capacity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and showed that this catalyst gave high propylene yield in the fluidized moving bed reactor.
In this work, a series of CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/Zr-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared for use in the propane dehydrogenation. The catalysts were characterized in order to find out the important factors affecting propylene selectivity and catalyst durability. Because the propane dehydrogenation reaction should be simulated for the fluidized moving bed reactor having the residence time in a few seconds range as mentioned above, the reaction was carried out within short time-on-stream in gas phase oxygen free condition and the reaction products were analyzed using a specially-designed automatic product sampling system which samples every second by a multi-position valve assembly. The important chromium species and the property of supporting material affecting the propylene selectivity were studied with catalyst characterization tools. In addition, catalytic activity and physicochemical property change of the catalyst after artificial aging treatment were studied.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
For the preparation of mirco-spheroidal Al2O3 support, Boehmite powder (Catapal B, Sasol) slurry was stirred at room temperature for 30 min and peptized to alumina sol by dropwise addition of diluted HNO3 solution. The resulting solution was dried by introducing it into a spray dryer. The dried powder was calcined at 700 °C for 6 h under air flow to yield mirco-spheroidal Al2O3 support (avg. dia. 70 ∼ 100 μm). The preparation procedure of zirconium-modified Al2O3 support (Zr-Al2O3) was identical to that of micro-spheroidal Al2O3 support, except that ZrO(NO3)2 was used instead of HNO3.
A series of fluidizable CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/Zr-Al2O3 catalysts having different chromium loading were prepared by impregnating CrO3 (Sigma-Aldrich) solution on the prepared micro-spheroidal support. After drying the impregnated sample at 60 °C, it was calcined at 700 °C for 6 h under air flow. The prepared catalysts were denoted as xCr and xCr/yZr, where x represents the weight percent of chromium supported on the micro-spheroidal Al2O3 and zirconium-modified Al2O3 (denoted as Zr-Al2O3) and y represents the Zr/Al molar ratio of zirconium-modified Al2O3 support.
An equilibrated catalyst showing stable catalytic performance was obtained by treating a fresh catalyst in the redox mode at 600 °C for 100 cycles. And an artificial aging step was adopted to evaluate the catalyst durability where the catalyst was artificially aged in the 100% steam flow at 800 °C for 24 h.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
H2-TPR (Temperature-programmed reduction) tests were carried in an AutoChem II (Micromeritics, USA) instrument. In a typical experiment, the catalyst sample (400 mg) was pretreated at 800 °C for 15 min under air flow and then cooled down to 150 °C under He flow. For the TPR study, the temperature was increased from 150 °C to 800 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min in a flow of 10 vol.% H2 in Ar with a total flow rate of 50 ml/min. The H2 consumption was determined using a thermal conductivity detector. Water formed during the TPR measurements was removed from the flow by molecular sieve 4 Å before entering the detector.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on the calcined samples, employing a Rigaku Miniflex diffractometer (voltage: 30 kV and current: 15 mA), equipped with a copper tube (λ = 1.54056 Å). The diffractometer was calibrated to determine the concentration of α-Cr2O3 phase in the catalyst samples. The Raman spectra were measured by a home-made wide-field microscopy setup. A silicon isolator was filled with powder sample on a cover glass (12-548-C, Fisher Scientific), and then it was placed on an objective lens with 60 x magnification of oil-immersion type on an inverted microscope (IX71, Olympus). The samples were excited by a single-frequency continuous-wave diode-pumped solid state laser with wavelength of 532 nm (Samba 100, Cobolt). The laser was uniformly irradiated on the samples with diameter of about 100 micrometers by using a wide-field lens and the objective lens. The laser power at the cover glass was 7 mW. The Raman spectra from the samples were recorded by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (PIXIS400BR, Princeton Instruments) equipped with a spectrograph (SCT320, Princeton Instruments) with an exposure time of 30 s. The XPS spectra were recorded with an AXIS NOVA(KRATOS) spectrometer using Al Kα1.2 radiation (40 eV) from an X-ray source operating at 15 kV and 10 mA. The working pressure was better than 2 × 10−8 Torr.
2.3. Dehydrogenation of propane to propylene
Dehydrogenation of propane was conducted in a continuous flow fixed-bed quartz reactor equipped with multi-position valves in the absence of external oxygen source, as schematically represented in Fig. 1. Each catalyst (0.4 g) was charged into the quartz reactor(i.d. =82 mm) and quartz rod(o.d. =80 mm) was inserted to minimize reactor dead volume. The catalyst sample was pretreated under O2 flow(6 ml/min) diluted with He flow(24 ml/min) at 700 °C for 30 min. After purging the reactor with He flow (24 ml/min), the reactant was pulse-injected at 600 °C for 16 s and the products were simultaneously sampled in 16-position valve at a 1 s interval. During the reaction, feed composition was fixed at C3H8:N2 = 40 ml:40 ml and WHSV was maintained at 8,600 ml/(gcat&903;h). Reaction products were sequentially analyzed with an on-line gas chromatograph (GC6890, Agilent) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
BET surface area and pore volume characteristics of the catalysts used in the present study are given in Table 1, Table 2. In the case of xCr samples, a decrease in BET surface area and pore volume with high Cr loadings was generally observed and it could be related to the blockage of pores by the CrOx species. The BET surface area and pore volume of the catalyst having higher Cr loading were more drastically decreased after artificial aging treatment, indicating that the higher the chromium content of the catalyst, the easier the chromium species sintering is during the catalyst synthesis as well as the artificial aging procedure. Additionally, the fact that the BET surface area and pore volume of 20Cr sample were drastically decreased compared to those of alumina support during the artificial aging treatment suggests that not only the mobility of the Cr species on the support but also the increased crystalline characteristic of the alumina is an important factor affecting the chromium sintering. On the other hand, only a small decrease in the BET surface area and pore volume was found in 20Cr/0.07Zr sample after artificial aging. We used Zr-Al2O3 support with Zr/Al molar ratio of 0.07 in this study because minimum amount of α-Cr2O3 was formed at this molar ratio. The effect of different Zr/Al molar ratio and α-Cr2O3 amount in the support on the catalyst stability will be discussed later.

The Raman spectra of chromium oxide on alumina, with different chromium loadings, are presented in Fig. 2. The 1Cr sample has its Raman band at 863 cm−1, assigned to the symmetrical stretching mode of a tetrahedral monochromate species. The shift of band to higher frequency with respect to the chromate ion in aqueous solution is caused by the strong interaction of chromate species with alumina surface [22]. The most intense Raman bands for 5Cr and 10Cr samples are found at 899 and 932 cm−1, respectively. The 5Cr sample band at 899 cm−1 matches with that of a chromium oxide dimer, and the 10Cr sample band at 932 cm−1 shows the presence of polymeric Cr6+ species [23]. In 10Cr sample, a new band appears at 558 cm−1 attributed to formation of Cr2O3 [24]. Furthermore, at a more increased chromium coverage in 20Cr sample, the intensity of Raman band of the polymeric Cr6+ species is decreased and the Cr2O3 band becomes more intense. These observations on the Raman spectra of the various chromium loading samples suggest that the increase of the chromium loading resulted in the reduction of the monochromate species, possibly leading to the formation of polychromate species [25]. Then with the further increase of chromium loading, this polychromate species forms Cr2O3 species. The Cr2O3 band at 558 cm−1 is not present in the Raman spectra of artificial aged 20Cr sample, and instead, a broad band appears near 580 cm−1. This band most closely matches with the Raman band of Al1.896Cr0.104O3 which is Cr/α-Al2O3 solid solution [26]. Therefore, it is very plausible that Cr2O3 species in 20Cr sample is transformed into Cr/α-Al2O3 solid solution during the aging process [27]. In contrast, the clear Cr2O3 band and the absence of the band at 580 cm−1 in the artificially aged 20Cr/0.07Zr Raman spectra indicate that Cr2O3 species remain intact even after the aging process without forming Cr/α-Al2O3 solid solution. This means that Zr modification enhances the stability of the support.

In order to quantitatively analyze different Cr species, H2-TPR results and XRD results are presented and investigated. At first, Cr6+ species, surface grafted monomeric Cr6+ and polymeric Cr6+, in the samples are quantified from H2-TPR results. The selective quantification of different Cr6+ species could be achieved since Cr3+ species will not appear in H2-TPR because H2 is not consumed to reduce the Cr3+ [28]. And the polymeric Cr6+ species and monomeric grafted Cr6+ could be separated by washing with water prior to H2-TPR experiment since polymeric Cr6+ species is water-soluble, while alumina surface-grafted monomeric Cr6+ is water-insoluble [29], [30]. The TPR profiles of the calcined and water-washed samples are shown in Fig. 3(A) and (B), respectively. As shown in Fig. 3(B), the H2 consumption peaks around the lowest and highest reduction temperatures (peak I and III) disappeared, while only the peak around the middle reduction temperature (peak II) remains, after the water-washing treatment. Thus, these results suggest that the H2 consumption peak II is ascribed to the reduction of the surface-grafted monomeric Cr6+ species, and the reduction of the soluble oligomeric or polymeric ones corresponds to the peak I and III. According to Cavani and his co-workers [29], because the grafted Cr6+ interacts more strongly with the support than the soluble Cr6+, the reduction of the grafted Cr6+ species would be more difficult, resulting in the higher reduction temperature than the soluble Cr6+. These observations are in good agreement with the results that Tmax of peak II is higher than that of peak I. However, it is interesting to find that the other H2 consumption peak III, corresponding to the reduction of soluble polymeric chromate, appeared at the higher temperature than the surface-grafted monomeric Cr6+ species (peak II). This fact can be due to less reducible “bulk type” high polymeric Cr6+ species. The amount of each Cr6+ species, noted as Cr6+surfacegrafted and Cr6+soluble, is calculated from the reduction peaks I, II, and III of Fig. 3(A) and the results are shown in Table 3. These quantitative analyses were carried out, based on the hypothesis that the reduction of Cr6+ with H2 is theoretically proceeded by the reaction 2CrO3 + H2 → Cr2O3 + 3H2O [31].

Fig. 4 shows the TPR results of the artificially-aged CrOx/γ-Al2O3 samples. Unlike the equilibrated samples (Fig. 3(A)), the aged samples (Fig. 4(A)) show drastically decreased reduction peaks. The TPR profiles of these aged catalyst samples after water-washing treatment are also shown in Fig. 4(B), and the concentrations of the grafted and the soluble Cr6+ species of the aged samples are summarized in Table 3. The drastically decreased reduction peaks of the aged samples should be attributed to the reduction of monomeric and polymeric Cr6+ species during the aging treatment, suggesting that both of the Cr6+ species were transformed into stable species such as amorphous or crystalline Cr2O3 species.

The amount of Cr3+ species, crystalline α-Cr2O3 and amorphous Cr2O3 in each sample, was determined by the diffractometer calibration method and by the difference between the total Cr3+ amount and the α-Cr2O3 concentration, respectively [24] based on the XRD results. The XRD patterns of the equilibrated and aged xCr and 20Cr/0.07Zr samples are shown in Fig. 5(A) and (B), respectively. For the equilibrated samples, XRD result reveals the presence of crystalline phase in the 20Cr and 20Cr/0.07Zr [32]. After the artificial aging, new crystalline phase was found in 10Cr and 20Cr samples. The new crystalline peaks were well matched with those of Cr/α-Al2O3 solid solution phase [33]. According to this result, samples with high chromium loading formed Cr/α-Al2O3 solid solution phase during the aging process as the Raman results suggested. Yet, only negligible amount of Cr/α-Al2O3 solid solution crystalline peaks was found for 20Cr/0.07Zr sample after the aging treatment.

In order to evaluate the effect of Zr amount in the Zr-Al2O3 support on the stability of Cr species, crystalline structures of the artificially aged 20Cr/yZr (y = 0.01, 0.05, 0.07, 0.08, and 0.1) samples were examined by XRD measurements as shown in Fig. 6(A). The amount of crystalline α-Cr2O3 was also plotted as a function Zr/Al molar ratio as shown in Fig. 6(B). The amount of crystalline α-Cr2O3 decreased in the order of 20Cr/0.1Zr < 20Cr/0.01Zr < 20Cr/0.05Zr < 20Cr/0.08Zr < 20Cr/0.07Zr. It has been previously reported that initial catalytic activity of the equilibrated CrOx/Zr-Al2O3 catalysts was closely related to the Zr/Al molar ratio and the catalyst with the Zr/Al ratio of 0.07 showed the highest initial yield for propylene [34]. These results indicate that the addition of appropriate amount of zirconia enhanced the stability of CrOx/Zr-Al2O3 catalysts as well as the catalytic activity in the fluidized moving bed.

A comprehensive analysis on the transition in chromium state with the amount of Cr6+ species and Cr3+ species was done from TPR results and XRD results as presented in Table 3. For the equilibrated samples, as the chromium loading amount was increased from 1Cr sample to 20Cr sample, both of the monomeric and polymeric Cr6+ species amounts were increased initially, but eventually resulted in reduction of Cr6+ species and substantial increase of Cr3+ species. This result agrees with the Raman spectroscopy interpretation as mentioned above. The increase of the chromium loading higher than 10Cr causes the appearance of the Raman band at 558 cm−1, ascribed to increased amount of Cr3+ species. After the artificial aging, the total amount of Cr6+ species was reduced in all four Cr samples but more severe reduction in Cr6+ species, and major increase in crystalline Cr3+ species in 10Cr and 20Cr samples were observed. This indicates that samples with higher chromium loading are more prone to the chromium particle sintering leading to the formation of Cr3+ crystalline phase. However, even after the artificial aging process, only minor overall changes in chromium state were found for the 20Cr/0.07Zr sample compared to the 20Cr sample, which showed that Zr modified support effectively suppressed chromium sintering into Cr3+ crystalline phase.
To better understand the change of the Cr species on the support surface during aging treatment, XPS analyses were carried out. Fig. 7(A) and (B) shows the change of the surface Cr/Al atomic ratio of equilibrated and aged catalysts on Al2O3 support and Zr modified Al2O3 support, which was determined by XPS analysis. The result of 1Cr sample was not included in the figure, because the intensity of Cr2p signal is not enough for the accurate quantitative analysis. It is seen that the Cr/Al ratios of the equilibrated and aged samples are linearly increased as the Cr loading increases. But, the surface Cr/Al ratio of the aged samples and the slope of its growth are lower than those of the equilibrated ones. This observation suggests that Cr species is agglomerated on the surface of alumina support during the aging treatment and it is more pronounced at the higher Cr loading. For Zr modified Al2O3 supported catalysts with same Cr loadings, all three samples showed higher Cr/Al ratios than Al2O3 supported catalysts. This result again supports the enhanced stability of Cr species on Zr modified support compared to mere alumina support. Chromium oxide on the alumina surface modified with Zr can maintain higher oxidation state such as Cr6+ [15], [16] and it is highly dispersed on the support as shown in Fig. 7. As the chromium content increases, crystalline Cr3+ oxide is formed on alumina [10]. Further increase of chromium content results in the formation of Cr/Al solid solution. Therefore, high dispersion of chromium oxide at high catalyst loading is very important for improving catalyst durability.

3.2. Catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane
Both of long-term stability and hydrothermal stability for PDH catalyst need to be secured for practical industrial applications. Because the catalyst is oxidatively regenerated and consecutively reduced in the PDH process scheme using the fluidized moving bed and this repeated circulation of the catalyst results in a gradual loss of initial activity, it is important to gain insights into long-term catalyst stability for realizing a commercially available oxide catalyst. Yet, only a few literatures concerning on the long-term catalyst stability are reported [35] and the information about the artificial accelerating aging method can be obtained from some patents [36], [37]. Moreover, PDH catalyst is frequently exposed to a high temperature steam so the hydrothermal stability is also important. Therefore, the catalytic activities of equilibrated and artificially aged samples are tested.
The reaction results of propane dehydrogenation with catalysts having different chromium loading were analyzed. Fig. 8(A) and (B) shows the results of propane conversion and selectivity to propylene and carbon dioxide as a function of short time-on-stream of propane dehydrogenation performed over the equilibrated and artificially-aged catalysts, respectively. For both the equilibrated and aged catalysts, a sudden decrease in propane conversion and a sudden increase in propylene selectivity were observed during an induction period due to the rapid consumption of limited lattice oxygen in the catalyst. This rapid oxygen consumption is closely related to the high CO2 selectivity during the induction period. Because it is known that the oxidation state of chromium species greatly affects the selectivity for propylene [38], [39], it is highly probable that the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ or the lower oxidation state [29], [40], [41] during the induction period mainly caused the sudden CO2 production.

The catalytic activity tests for the prepared samples within a short time-on-stream range revealed that the concentration of Cr6+ species should be minimized for increasing propylene selectivity because excessive amount of CO2 was produced during the reduction of Cr6+ species to Cr3+ species in the propane conversion reaction. During this chromium reduction process, CrO3 species in the catalyst reacts with propane and produces CO2 by complete oxidation of propane. However, this does not mean that intrinsic Cr6+ species in the catalyst need to be removed. There are two types of Cr3+ species; one is saturated Cr3+ species formed during the catalyst preparation step and the other is unsaturated Cr3+ species formed by the reduction of Cr6+ species. Between these Cr3+ species, it is known that the unsaturated Cr3+ species formed by the reduction of Cr6+ species act as active sites [42]. Therefore, we need to effectively convert Cr6+ species into unsaturated Cr3+ species to minimize CO2 formation and to increase propylene selectivity instead of simply removing intrinsic Cr6+ species from the catalyst.
The effect of different chromium loading amount on the propane conversion could also be recognized. For equilibrated catalysts, as the loading is increased from 1Cr to 10Cr, the propane conversion also increased, but 20Cr catalyst showed the decreased conversion. After the artificial aging, conversion of 1Cr, 5Cr, and 10Cr catalysts was reduced to half of that of equilibrated catalysts. These results indicate the low hydrothermal stability of the catalysts. Moreover, the conversion decrease after the aging step is even more pronounced for the 20Cr sample. The dramatic reduction of conversion in 20Cr is thought to be primarily caused by the transformation of surface chromium species into chromia/alumina solid solution state as the similar abrupt decrease in conversion due to incorporation of the chromium species into the alumina support has been previously reported [43].
In the previous sections, the enhanced hydrothermal stability of the CrOx/Zr-Al2O3 sample was confirmed after the artificial aging process. Here, reactivity of Al2O3 and Zr-Al2O3 (Zr/Al molar ratio, 0.07) with PDH reaction product, propylene, was compared. Because our target is to achieve highest possible propylene selectivity, high reactivity toward propylene is not desirable. In Fig. 9, propylene reaction rates by the Al2O3 and Zr-Al2O3 supports are shown. Clearly, Zr-Al2O3 demonstrates much lower propylene consumption rate than Al2O3, which makes Zr-Al2O3 a preferable support material.

Furthermore, propylene selectivities of Al2O3 supported catalyst and Zr-Al2O3 supported catalyst in PDH are compared in Fig. 10. For equilibrated (Fig. 10(A)) catalysts, Zr-Al2O3 supported catalyst showed superior propylene selectivity for all conversion level. This result could be ascribed to the low propylene reactivity of Zr-Al2O3 support. After the artificial aging (Fig. 10(B)), while the conversion of Zr-Al2O3 supported catalyst decreased slightly, the conversion of Al2O3 supported catalyst decreased significantly. Thus, Zr-Al2O3 support enhanced not only the propylene selectivity but also the long-term catalyst stability.

4. Conclusions
Propane dehydrogenation, using a number of equilibrated and artificially-aged CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/Zr modified γ-Al2O3 catalysts, was carried out within short time-on-stream in the gas phase oxygen free condition. The catalyst samples were characterized for gaining insights into long-term catalyst stability and high propylene yield. The results obtained by pore and surface analyses revealed that the chromium species of the higher Cr loaded catalyst was more easily sintered and the sintering was more pronounced during the artificial aging treatment due to the mobility of the Cr species on alumina surface. Monochromate, which is not water-soluble, was initially formed on alumina surface. The increase of the chromium loading resulted in the formation of the soluble polychromate species, and then this species was transformed to the Cr2O3 with the further increase in chromium loading. Also, H2-reducible Cr6+ species was transformed into a stable amorphous or crystalline Cr2O3 species during the artificial aging treatment as well. The catalyst sintering in samples with high chromium loading was closely correlated with the reduced catalytic activity (propane conversion). When the chromia/alumina solid solution was formed during the artificial aging step, the propane conversion was decreased drastically. In order to solve this low catalyst stability, Zr-Al2O3 support was adopted. The enhanced catalyst stability and high propylene selectivity of Zr-Al2O3 supported catalyst were observed. These results were due to high dispersion of chromium oxide at high loading. With the successful suppression of ɑ-Cr2O3 formation by zirconium modification, an optimal PDH catalyst applicable for a long-term operation in fluidized moving bed could be designed.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
