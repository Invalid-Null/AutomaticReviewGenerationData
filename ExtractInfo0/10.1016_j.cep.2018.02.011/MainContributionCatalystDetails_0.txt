 Unfortunately, this document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document focuses on ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to produce ethylene. Since it does not pertain to converting propane to propylene, I cannot extract the requested information about propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
