 Unfortunately, the given document does not seem to discuss either Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) or Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically. The document focuses on analyzing shutdown events and availability modeling of propylene production plants via steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation, but does not go into details about catalysts used in these processes. Since the main scientific contribution does not appear to be related to catalyst development for PDH or ODH, I am unable to extract the requested information.
