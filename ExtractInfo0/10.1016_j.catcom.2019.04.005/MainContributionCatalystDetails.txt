 Unfortunately, the provided extracted information does not contain any relevant details about propane dehydrogenation research. Since all the extracts indicate the documents are not relevant, I cannot synthesize a meaningful XML output. The unified response is:

<output>
  <Relevance>No</Relevance>
</output>

The extracts state the documents focus on cyclohexane dehydrogenation using cobalt catalysts, with no mention of propane or propylene. As there are no extracts providing pertinent details about propane dehydrogenation, I cannot aggregate the information into a cohesive XML summary.
