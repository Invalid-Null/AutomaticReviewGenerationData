Catalytic cracking of 1-butene to propene and ethene on MCM-22 zeolite
Abstract
Catalytic cracking of butene to propene and ethene was investigated over HMCM-22 zeolite. The performance of HMCM-22 zeolite was markedly influenced by time-on-stream (TOS) and reaction conditions. A rapid deactivation during the first 1 h reaction, followed by a quasi-plateau in activity, was observed in the process along with significant changes in product distributions, which can be attributed to the fast coking process occurring in the large supercages of MCM-22.
Properly selected reaction conditions can suppress the secondary reactions and enhance the production of propene and ethene. According to the product distribution under different butene conversion, we propose a simple reaction pathway for forming the propene, ethene and by-products from butene cracking.
HMCM-22 exhibited similar product distribution with the mostly used high silica ZSM-5 zeolite under the same conversion levels. High selectivities of propene and ethene were obtained, indicating that the 10-member ring of MCM-22 zeolite played the dominant role after 1 h of TOS. However, MCM-22 exhibited lower activity and stability than that on high silica ZSM-5 zeolite with longer time-on-stream.
1. Introduction
One of the fastest growing petrochemical markets is that for propene, driven primarily by the high growth rate of polypropene [1]. Traditional methods to produce propene cannot satisfy the propene demand [2]. For example, co-product propene production from steam cracking is determined largely by the feed state; yet much of the new steam cracking capacity is based on ethane feed, which produces little propene [3]. Indeed in FCC units propene is obtained at a relatively low yield and enhancement of the yield has proven expensive and limited [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Another two on-purpose propene technologies are also available: propane dehydrogenation and metathesis, but these have seen only limited applicability [1], [2], [6]. Propane dehydrogenation requires high investment and both technologies require opportunistic feedstock economics. A newly emerging technology is catalytic cracking of C4+ alkenes to propene and ethene, of which the feed can be any hydrocarbons containing sufficient amounts of C4+ alkenes, such as steam cracker by-products, FCC low value refinery streams, catalytic cracked naphtha and light gasoline [7], [8], [9], [10], [11].
Several patents have been granted on the technology of catalytic cracking of C4+ alkenes; most such processes were carried out on high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Due to the low acidity and particular pore topology of the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite, high selectivity of propene plus ethene was obtained. Similar to ZSM-5, MCM-22 zeolite possesses one pore system that includes two-dimensional sinusoidal intersecting 10-member ring channels. Besides that, MCM-22 zeolite also possesses another pore system, which contains large supercages defined by 12-member ring of 0.71 nm inner diameter and 1.82 nm height [12]. However, the use of MCM-22 as the catalyst in the process of C4+ alkenes catalytic cracking to propene/ethene has not been reported so far. Also, whether both pore systems of MCM-22 or only one of them play the major role in butene catalytic cracking is not known and needs to be investigated.
Asensi et al. [13] have studied isomerization of 1-butene to isobutene on MCM-22 zeolite under various operating conditions; they discussed the mechanisms of formation of isobutene and by-products from 1-butene on MCM-22 zeolite. In this work, we investigated the performance of MCM-22 zeolite in catalytic cracking of 1-butene to propene plus ethene under a wide range of operating conditions, i.e. temperature, 1-butene space velocity, 1-butene partial pressure in the feed, and time on stream. Moreover, the performance of MCM-22 and that of high silica ZSM-5 zeolite in the catalytic cracking of 1-butene were compared under similar conditions. On the basis of these results, a mechanism of formation of propene, ethene and by-products from 1-butene is proposed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of zeolite MCM-22 and catalyst preparation
A sample of zeolite MCM-22 with Si/Al2 ratio of 30 was synthesized following the procedure described in Ref. [13] and using hexamethylene imine (HMI) as template. The molar composition of the gel: SiO2:Al2O3:Na2O:HMI:H2O is equal to 1:0.033:0.11:0.35:0.45. Crystallization of the gels was carried out in 100 ml stainless steel autoclaves rotated at 60 rpm at a temperature of 138 °C. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the product was filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried at 100 °C overnight. Finally, the MCM-22 zeolite was calcined at 550 °C for 5 h under static air to remove the organic template from their channels. Then the calcined sample was ion-exchanged with 0.8 mol/l ammonium nitrate solution at 90 °C repeatedly (for three times) so as to convert the zeolite into its NH4-form. After that, the zeolite crystals were washed with deionized water, dried at 120 °C and then pressed binder-free; the material was crushed to 20–35 mesh size particles and then calcined under static air at 550 °C for 3 h to convert the zeolite to its H-form. As reference catalyst, high silica ZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al2 ratio of 350, from Shanghai Fuxu Zeolite Corporation, China) was selected and the HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared using the method stated above.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The component phases and the degree of crystallinity of the samples were determined by the powder XRD technique. The XRD pattern of the sample was recorded on a Rigaku D/Max RB diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation, operating at 40 kV and 40 mA, with a scanning speed of 10°/min.
The acidity of the sample was determined by the NH3-TPD technique. The sample (0.14 g) was loaded into a U-shaped stainless steel microreactor and pretreated at 500 °C for 0.5 h in flowing He. After the pretreatment, the sample was cooled to 150 °C and saturated with NH3 gas. Then the NH3-TPD was carried out under a constant flow of He (20 ml/min) from 150 to 700 °C at a heating rate of 18 °C/min. The desorbed ammonia was monitored continuously with a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.
Room-temperature IR spectra were recorded with a Nicolet 710 FT-IR spectrometer from zeolite wafers (10 mg cm−2) mounted in a vacuum cell. Pretreatment of zeolites was performed in the cell at 500 °C under vacuum for 1 h. For the adsorption/desorption studies, pyridine vapor was adsorbed onto the zeolite. The excess of pyridine was removed under vacuum over three consecutive periods (1 h each) under the heating at 150, 350, and 450 °C, followed by IR measurements.
TG profiles were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer TG 1700 instrument. The catalyst loading was about 0.01 g and the flow rate of N2 was 30 ml/min. The catalyst was heated from 50 to 850 °C in a 20% O2/N2 stream at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
2.3. Catalytic experiments
Catalytic cracking of 1-butene over the zeolite catalysts was carried out in a continuous stainless steel reactor (7 mm diameter) with a thermocouple in the center of the catalyst bed, using 1-butene (>99.5% pure) as feed. The catalyst was activated at 550 °C for 1 h under a nitrogen flow before starting a reaction run. Then the 1-butene and/or nitrogen was passed through the reactor at various temperatures and different 1-butene partial pressures. The 1-butene space velocity (WHSV) was changed between 0.8 and 50 h−1 to obtain different conversion levels. The reaction products were analyzed by an on-line Varian 3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionic detector, using a PONA column.
3. Results and discussion

The acidity of the H-form MCM-22 determined by NH3-TPD technique is shown in Fig. 2. The curve-fitting results are also presented in Fig. 2. As seen, there are three NH3-desorption peaks located at 250, 350 and 520 °C on the MCM-22 zeolite, consistent with the results of the HMCM-22 reported previously [14], [15]. The slight difference in the peak temperatures may result from the samples with different Si/Al2 ratio and from the different experimental conditions. As claimed [14], [15], the peak at 250 °C is attributed to the desorption of the physisorbed NH3 species and/or NH3 species residing on non-exchangeable cationic sites, while the peak at 350 °C is assigned to the desorption of NH3 adspecies adsorbed on exchangeable protonic sites, i.e., Brönsted acid sites. The peak at 520 °C is attributed to strong Lewis acid sites.

To further elucidate the acid functional groups, we employed pyridine adsorption determined by FT-IR spectroscopy. Fig. 3 displays the IR spectra of pyridine adsorption on MCM-22 samples outgassed at 150, 350 and 450 °C. Absorption bands associated with the chemisorbed pyridine were observed at 1547, 1491, and 1454 cm−1. According to previous reports on pyridine chemisorption [16], [17], the pyridine band at 1547 cm−1 is assignable to pyridinum ions and the band at 1454 cm−1 to Lewis acid-coordinated pyridine. The band at 1491 cm−1 consists of bands due to the Brönsted and the Lewis sites. The bands at 1540 and 1450 cm−1 of the spectra outgassing at 150 °C can represent the total amount of the Brönsted and the Lewis sites of the samples, respectively. If one increases the outgassing temperature from 150 to 350 and 450 °C, most of the Lewis acid-coordinated pyridine is still retained, as shown by the band at 1450 cm−1, indicating that most of the Lewis acid sites belong to strong acid sites, in accord with the results of TPD. The amount of Brönsted acid sites, however, decreases gradually with increasing the outgassing temperature, indicating that the strength distribution of the Brönsted sites is over a wide range. Of course, under high treatment temperature such as 450 °C, two Brönsted acid sites converting to a Lewis acid site cannot be ruled out. From the fact that about 40% of the pyridinum ions are still retained upon outgassing temperature at 450 °C, we deduce that at least 40% of the Brönsted acid sites belong to strong acid sites.

3.2. Catalytic cracking of 1-butene
In this investigation, studies of the influence of time on stream, 1-butene space velocities, reaction temperature, and 1-butene partial pressures on the performance of the MCM-22 catalyst were systematically carried out. The performance of MCM-22 was also compared with that of a high silica ZSM-5 zeolite under similar conditions. It has been found that isomerization will simultaneously occur on MCM-22 with cracking reactions and other secondary reactions [13]. For simplicity, we group all the types of butene as the feed; the conversion is defined as: conversion = (C4H8% in the feed − C4H8% in the products)/(C4H8% in the feed). The selectivity of a particular CxHy is defined as:
 = (CxHy% in the products)/(∑CiHj% in the products), where all percentages are in weight percent.
3.2.1. Influence of time on stream
Butene catalytic cracking is a complicated process: besides the production of ethene and propene, other hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, propane, butanes, aromatics and C5+ aliphatic hydrocarbons, are also formed in the process.
The evolution of butene conversion, the selectivities and the yields of propene and ethene with time on stream (TOS) were measured at 620 °C, WHSV of 3.5 h−1, and 0.1 MPa of 1-butene pressure. As shown in Fig. 4, a rapid deactivation during the initial stage of reaction, followed by a quasi-plateau in activity, was observed, as was previously observed in m-xylene transformation and n-heptane cracking on MCM-22 zeolite [18], [19]. The 1-butene conversion decreased sharply from 97 to 76% in the first hour of running and then decreased steadily at prolonged TOS. A significant difference was found between the product distributions at the initial stage and the distribution at the quasi-plateau. At the initial stage, the selectivities of products follows the order: propane (28%) 
 ethene (16%) ≈ aromatics ≈ methane plus ethane > butanes (12%) > propene (11%) > C5+ (2.2%). After 1 h running, the product selectivities change little and present the following order: propene (44%) 
 ethene (19%) 
 aromatics (11%) ≈ butanes (10%) > C5+ (7.3%) > methane plus ethane (4.1%) > propane (3.7%).

Fig. 4. Influence of TOS on MCM-22 catalytic performance.
There was a drastic increase in propene selectivity (by 33%), accompanied by a rapid decrease in the selectivities of propane (by 24%), methane plus ethane (by 10%) and aromatics (by 5%), whilst there was a slight increase in the selectivities of ethene and C5+ aliphatic hydrocarbons at the first hour of running.
These observations concerning the change of butene conversion and product distribution can be ascribed to a very fast formation of coke at the initial stage of the reaction. TG curves of the coked MCM-22 catalyst reacted for 1 and 14 h are shown in Fig. 5. In the TG profiles, the weight loss before 300 °C is attributed to desorption of the adsorbed water. The decrease of weight from 300 to 850 °C is attributed to burning-off the coke. The TG curves show that the coke amount formed in the first hour was about half of that reacted for 14 h on/in the zeolite. The formation of coke molecules involves bimolecular hydrogen transfer reaction; hence, bulky intermediates occur preferentially in the large cylindrical supercages of MCM-22. Researchers have clearly demonstrated that coking is very fast in large cages with small apertures (trap cages) such as the supercages of MCM-22, owing to a strong retention of coke precursors [18], [19]. So it can be proposed that the very fast initial coking occurs in the supercages and that the activity at the plateau is due to the protonic sites located in the 10-member ring sinusoidal channels of the MCM-22 zeolite [18], [19].

The evolution of the product distribution can be explained by the changes in the hydrogen transfer reaction and in the aromatization reaction of alkenes on the fresh and coked samples. The hydrogen transfer reactions involving the formation of bulky bimolecular reaction intermediates are mainly controlled by steric constraints and by the space available inside the micropores of the zeolites [20], and they are also influenced by the acid sites density of the samples. The fast coke formation induced poisoning of the acid sites, especially the strong ones in the supercages, thus decreasing the acid sites density. In addition, the deposited coke would decrease the accessibility of alkenes to part of the acidic sites and would reduce the free space around the acid sites available for the formation of the bulky bimolecular reaction intermediates. The above reasons caused a suppression of the hydrogen transfer reaction of alkenes, resulting in a rapid decrement in propane selectivity and a sharp increment in propene selectivity with time on stream. Also the formation of aromatics and that of methane plus ethane were decreased for the same reason, due to the suppression of aromatization and dealkylation of the aromatics induced by coking.
At the quasi-plateau stage, the reaction mainly takes place over the protonic sites located in the 10-member ring sinusoidal channels of MCM-22 zeolite. Similar to ZSM-5 zeolite, the 10-member ring channels suppress the multi-nucleus aromatics (coke) strongly. The low coking rate in the 10-member ring channels resulted in the small change in product distribution at the quasi-plateau stage.
3.2.2. Influence of 1-butene space velocity (WHSV)
The effects of 1-butene WHSV on conversion and on propene and ethene selectivities at 620 °C and 0.1 MPa of 1-butene pressure are shown in Fig. 6a. As stated above, MCM-22 zeolite showed a fast deactivation in the initial reaction stage; the catalytic data given in this work are the values obtained at 1 h of TOS. With increasing 1-butene WHSV, butene conversion decreased almost linearly, but ethene selectivity decreased slowly. The propene selectivity increased steadily to a maximum from 0.9 to 8.8 h−1, then decreased slowly with further increasing WHSV. As a result, the yield of propene also showed an increasing trend at low WHSV, and reached a maximum (ca. 35%) at ca. 3.5 h−1; then it decreased slowly with further increasing of the 1-butene WHSV.

Fig. 6. Influence of 1-butene WHSV on MCM-22 catalytic performance.
In references [20], [21], the ratio of HT = (C3 + C4 + iC4)/(C3= + C4=) was usually used as a measure of the hydrogen transfer activity. In the present process, we define HT = (C3 + C4 + iC4)/C3= as a measure of the hydrogen transfer activity of the catalyst. We also define the A/O = aromatics/(C2= + C3=) as a measure of the aromatization activity of the catalyst.
From Fig. 6b we can see that, when 1-butene WHSV increased from 0.8 to 8.8 h−1, HT and A/O decreased significantly, indicating that the hydrogen transfer and aromatization reactions of alkenes were suppressed effectively by increasing 1-butene WHSV properly. As a result, the selectivity of propene increased obviously, as shown in Fig. 6a. Further increasing the 1-butene WHSV to 17.0 h−1, A/O still went down while there was an increment in HT, which was attributed to the increased concentrations of unreacted butene enhancing the hydrogen transfer reaction of butene. As far as the yield and selectivity of propene are concerned, WHSV of 3.5–8.8 h−1 is suitable in the process of butene catalytic cracking to propene and ethene on MCM-22 zeolite under 620 °C and 0.1 MPa.
In order to obtain information of the different reactions occurring in the process on MCM-22 in detail, we present the product yields as a function of butene conversion in Fig. 7. It can be seen that propene, butane, isobutane, C5 and C8 aliphatic hydrocarbons were all formed at low butene conversions and can be considered as primary products of the process. The proportion of methane, ethene, ethane, propane and aromatics was initially very low and increased rapidly at higher conversions; they were considered as secondary products, formed by the transformation of the unstable primary products. C6 and C7 aliphatic hydrocarbons were seen as unstable secondary products, which were initially very low and showed a parabolic variation with increasing 1-butene conversion. Only a trace amount of C9+ appeared in the process (not shown).

Fig. 7. Effect of conversion on product distribution on MCM-22 zeolite.
The complex product distribution observed above during 1-butene catalytic cracking clearly indicates the difficulty in establishing a simple reaction mechanism. Besides the reactions of oligomerization of butenes and cracking of the oligomers, a large number of consecutive and parallel reactions also take place.
As can be seen from Fig. 7a–c, C3=, C5 and C8 aliphatic hydrocarbons were the main products at conversion under 10%; some butane and isobutane were also formed by hydrogen transfer reaction of butenes. The yield of C8, formed by dimerization of two butene molecules, had a maximum at butene conversion of 7.15% and then decreased to an even lower level at higher butene conversions, indicating the unstable nature of C8 and a secondary transformation of them, that is, cracking to C3= and C5= by β-scission. Also, C5= was unstable, as illustrated by the C5 evolution trend with conversion, and C5= can further crack to C3= and C2= by β-scission on the zeolite.
Provided that all the C5, C3= and C2= are produced from [C8+] intermediate

There must exist the following equations: ([C5], [C3=] and [C2=] designated as the molar concentrations of C5, C3= and C2=)
Note that, at low butene conversion of ca. 4.49%, the molar ratio of (C3= − 2C2=)/C5 was about 1.0, indicating that almost all of the C3= and C2= was produced by the [C8]+ intermediate cracking and the subsequent [C5]+ cracking. When the conversion increased from 4.49 to 7.15%, the molar ratio of C3=/C2= and (C3= − 2C2=)/C5 increased from 5.9 to 8.5 and 1.0 to 1.13 respectively, indicating that at conversion ca. 7.15% propene was also produced by other intermediates than [C8]+ carbenium intermediate (since the change of ethene yield was rather small in the range, the increase of the two values must be mainly due to the increment of propene yield). For example, [C12]+ (trimerization of butene) can be formed in the large pores of MCM-22 zeolite [13] and then cracked to propene and other small molecular hydrocarbons. C6 and C7 aliphatic hydrocarbons may be just the products of [C12]+ cracking, since they were initially very low at ca. 4.49% conversion, probably owing to the few [C12]+ intermediates formed at such low conversion conditions (the contact time used was not long enough to allow the formation of [C12]+ in order to get low butene conversion level). Besides propene and C6, C7 hydrocarbons, other small molecules of C4–C9 hydrocarbons can also be produced from the cracking of [C12]+. Of course, the formation of C5–C9 aliphatic hydrocarbons by oligomerization, alkylation and other secondary reactions cannot be ruled out. C9+ aliphatic hydrocarbons may also form in the large supercages of MCM-22; however, the ten-member ring pore mouth of the supercages was too small to let them diffuse out, resulting in only trace C9+ being detected in the cracking products [13].
Fig. 7 shows that, with increasing butene conversion, all C5–C8 hydrocarbon yields follow similar evolution trends: increasing first to reach a maximum, and then decreasing at higher conversion. The decrement in C5–C8 yields was caused by their secondary transformation due to their unstable nature and the higher cracking severity at higher butene conversion.
At butene conversion above 75%, with further increasing the conversion, the yield of propene decreased, obviously due to its secondary transformations. The sharp increases in the yields of propane and aromatics were just ascribed to the hydrogen transfer reaction of propene and the aromatization reaction of propene and other alkenes. Also, high yields of methane and ethane appeared at higher butene conversion. C8 aromatics were considered as the primary aromatic products formed in aromatization of alkenes over zeolite catalysts [22] and the reaction conditions used to get high butene conversion also favor aromatization of alkenes and the dealkylation of the aromatics formed, so that the yields of methane, ethane and aromatics increased rapidly with increasing the conversion to higher than 60%. Of course, the formation of methane and ethane by protolytic cracking and thermal cracking of the hydrocarbons in the process cannot be excluded.
Compared with propene, a different evolution trend of ethene yield was observed. With increasing butene conversion, the rate of ethene formation always increased under 85% conversion, indicating that, besides the cracking of [C5]+ intermediates, other processes for ethene formation are also occurring. It has been proposed that ethene can be formed by direct cracking of butene (actually [C4]+ carbenium) in the 10-member ring of MCM-22 zeolite [23]. This was ascribed to the large interaction existing between the adsorbed carbenium ions and the zeolite channels, although the reaction was less energetically favorable due to the formation of primary carbenium ions [23], and was also ascribed to the relative high reaction severity used at higher butene conversion. A similar case is also possible for the cracking of [C5]+ intermediates.
According to the above results, a simple reaction pathway of the formation of propene and ethene, as well as the by-products, from butene catalytic cracking over zeolite MCM-22 is proposed, as shown in Fig. 8. Besides the pathway listed in Fig. 8, dealkylation of aromatics, protolytic cracking, isomerization, alkylation, and oligomerization, can also take place in the process of butene catalytic cracking (not included in Fig. 8).

3.2.3. Influence of reaction temperature
The effect of reaction temperature on butene conversion and product distributions is shown in Table 1. A temperature change from 540 to 650 °C resulted in a marginal increase in butene conversion, viz. from 77.21 to 81.29%. In the reaction pathway shown in Fig. 8, reactions of cracking and C5+ hydrocarbons cyclization-aromatization were enhanced by increasing temperature while hydrogen transfer reactions of alkenes were suppressed, leading to a counter-balanced effect of temperature. However, the product distributions changed obviously with temperature, as shown in Table 1.

Reaction conditions: 1-butene WHSV 3.5 h−1, 0.1 MPa 1-butene pressure, TOS = 1 h.
As the reactions of aromatics dealkylation and protolytic cracking of hydrocarbons were enhanced by temperature, the selectivity of methane plus ethane increased from 2.09 to 8.64% when the temperature increased from 530 to 650 °C. Meanwhile, the values for propane and butane decreased, owing to the suppression of the hydrogen transfer reaction which was exothermic and thermodynamically unfavorable. The different evolution trends with temperature of ethane and C3–C4 alkanes indicated that ethane was not formed by the hydrogen transfer reaction of ethene. Although the hydrogen transfer reaction was suppressed, aromatization of C5+ hydrocarbon were enhanced with increasing temperature [24], [25]. As a result, the selectivity of aromatics increased with temperature. The increasing cracking severity resulted in C5+ aliphatic hydrocarbons selectivity going down with temperature, as shown in Table 1.
Similarly, due to the increasing cracking severity, ethene selectivity increased steadily with temperature. Propene selectivity first increased from 35.2 to 44.4% when the temperature changed from 530 to 580 °C; then the value kept almost unchanged between 580 and 620 °C, followed by a decrement with further increasing the temperature due to its excessive secondary transformations.
According to the product distributions at different temperatures, we can see that higher temperature is beneficial to butene conversion and ethene production, and that 580–620 °C is suitable for enhancing the selectivity and yield of propene under conditions of 3.5 h−1 WHSV and 0.1 MPa 1-butene pressure.
3.2.4. Influence of 1-butene partial pressure
Table 2 shows the butene conversion and product distributions as a function of 1-butene partial pressure at 620 and 3.5 h−1 WHSV. It is seen that 1-butene conversion increased with increasing the 1-butene partial pressure due to dimerization/oligomerization of butene being favored by higher 1-butene concentration in the feed. Relative to butene conversion, the selectivities of propene and ethene, and of other by-products were influenced only to a small extent by 1-butene pressure. With increasing 1-butene partial pressure, there was a slight enhancement in the production of C1–C4 alkanes, whilst a slight decrement was observed for the selectivities of propene and C5+ hydrocarbons. In view of the yield of propene, a relatively higher 1-butene partial pressure (0.08–0.1 MPa) is better under 620 °C and 3.5 h−1.

3.2.5. Comparison of the catalytic performance of MCM-22 with high silica ZSM-5
In the present study, the catalytic performance of MCM-22 was also compared with that of a high silica ZSM-5, which was the catalyst mostly used in C4+ alkenes cracking to propene and ethene [1], [4], [5], [6]. As the selectivities of propene and ethene were strongly dependent on 1-butene conversion, the comparison was carried out under the same reaction conditions, viz. 620 °C, 0.1 MPa, 1 h of TOS and similar conversion (ca. 78%). Table 3 shows that the two zeolites exhibited similar product distributions: the selectivity values of ethene were about the same, and the selectivity of propene on MCM-22 was slightly lower than that of high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite. All these results implied that, after the first hour of running, the ten-member ring of MCM-22 zeolite played the dominant role in the process of butene catalytic cracking to propene and ethene. This result further confirmed that the first locations being poisoned were the acid sites in the 12-member ring with large supercages of the MCM-22 zeolite. However, the MCM-22 sample still presented some characteristics of large pore zeolites. For example, the selectivity of isobutane and the ratio of

were higher on MCM-22 than on ZSM-5 zeolite. Corma et al. have demonstrated that isobutene was more easily formed on large-pore zeolites, such as Y and beta zeolites, which possess 12-member ring pore system and large supercages, than on small-pore zeolites [21]. And the HT of MCM-22 was also higher than that of ZSM-5, owing to the larger pore MCM-22 zeolite possessed [21]. Of course the larger amount of acid sites on MCM-22 relative to the high silica ZSM-5 zeolite was another reason for the higher HT on MCM-22 zeolite. And for the same reasons, the selectivities of methane, ethane and aromatics on MCM-22 were slightly higher than those on high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite.

Reaction conditions: 620 °C, 0.1 MPa, 1 h of TOS and ca. 78% conversion.
The comparison on activity and deactivation with TOS of the two zeolites was shown in Fig. 9. When used as FCC additive, ZSM-5 has shown much higher activity than MCM-22 zeolite [26]. Similar trend was observed in C4+ alkene catalytic cracking. Of course, the activity of MCM-22 we said is that in the quasi-plateau stage, not the initial activity due to the fast coking in the initial stage of reaction. Moreover, to suppress the secondary reactions of alkenes, higher WHSV was used on ZSM-5 zeolite than that on MCM-22 zeolite. As can be seen from Fig. 9 that ZSM-5 exhibited higher activity and higher stability than that on MCM-22 zeolite.

4. Conclusions
1.
A rapid deactivation during the first 1 h of reaction, followed by a quasi-plateau in activity, was observed in butene catalytic cracking on MCM-22 zeolite. A very large variation in product distribution during the first 1 h reaction was also observed. These variations can be attributed to the fast coking of the large supercages of MCM-22 at the initial reaction stage.
2.
The performance of MCM-22 zeolite was remarkably influenced by the reaction conditions. Properly selected reaction conditions can suppress the secondary reactions and can enhance the production of propene and ethene effectively. According to the product distributions under different butene conversion conditions, a simple reaction pathway forming the propene, ethene and by-products from butene cracking was proposed.
3.
MCM-22 zeolite coked by 1 h on TOS exhibited similar product distribution under similar conditions with the mostly used high silica ZSM-5 zeolite. High selectivities propene and ethene were obtained, indicating that the 10-member ring of MCM-22 played the dominant role in butene cracking after 1 h of TOS. However, MCM-22 exhibited lower activity and stability than that on high silica ZSM-5 zeolite with longer time-on-stream.
