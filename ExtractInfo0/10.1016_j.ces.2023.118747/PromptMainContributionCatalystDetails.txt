Abstract
Bi2MoO6 hierarchical microspheres (BMO-SP) consisting of monolayer nanosheets with abundant surface oxygen defects and unsaturated Mo sites are constructed for the one-pot synthesis of secondary amine via a photocatalytic coupling reaction of nitrobenzene (NB) and benzyl alcohol (BA). The performance of this photocatalyst is 12 times higher than that of bulk Bi2MoO6 (BMO-bulk). Experiment results and density functional theory calculations reveal that surface oxygen defects induce more unsaturated Mo atoms facilitating the coordination activation of NB and BA molecules through the formation of –N–O···Mo and –C–O···Mo coordination, respectively. The surface oxygen defects also promote the separation of photogenerated carriers. More photogenerated holes transfer to the surface for oxidizing the activated BA while the photogenerated electrons are trapped by oxygen defects for reducing NB. Thus, the photocatalytic performance is markedly improved. This work successfully designs an efficient photocatalyst for the tandem reaction via surface defect engineering.

1. Introduction
Schiff base reaction is usually conducted via the condensation reaction between amines and aldehydes or ketones. The products, imines, are the momentous intermediates for the production of pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals and polymers (Jia and Li, 2015, Li et al., 2022, Han et al., 2022). N-Benzylideneaniline (BE) is one of the representative imines formed via the condensation between aniline (AN) and benzaldehyde (BD). Generally, AN and BD are synthesized by the thermal catalytic reduction and oxidation of NB and BA, respectively. However, these synthetic processes need harsh conditions, such as high temperature and high pressure, resulting in energy consumption and environmental pollution to some extent (Huang et al., 2017, Song et al., 2018a, Tian et al., 2021, Yang et al., 2020). Designing an ideal catalytic system to achieve the one-pot coupling reaction of NB and BA to BE would be a good way which not only shorten the reaction times and synthesis cycles but also avoids the separation of intermediate, effectively reducing unnecessary energy consumption and environmental pollution.
Nowadays, photocatalysis as a mild and controllable catalytic system has been considered a potential way for solving the energy and environmental issues in the modern world (Han et al., 2020, Wang and Domen, 2020). It is a suitable catalytic system for Schiff base tandem reaction (Yu et al., 2019, Yang et al., 2019). The thermodynamic feasibility of this process requires that the conduction band (CB) and conduction band (VB) potential of the photocatalyst should be well matched with the reduction potential of NB to AN (0.82 V vs. NHE) and the oxidation potential of BA to BD (1.98 V vs. NHE), respectively (Daems et al., 2018, Zhou et al., 2021). Moreover, the adsorption and activation of BA and NB molecules on the catalytic active sites are very important for this tandem reaction because the activated BA and NB molecules are easier converted. On the basis of Lewis acids/bases theory, the –OH groups of BA as electron-donating groups tend to interact with the surface Lewis acids sites while the –NO2 groups of NB are electron-deficient groups which generally be absorbed on the surface Lewis bases sites (Liang et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2020). However, previous studies usually focus on the single BA oxidation or NB reduction reaction to design the corresponding Lewis acids sites or Lewis bases sites. Only Lewis acids sites or Lewis bases sites are not satisfied with the synchronous adsorption of BA and NB molecules due to their different electronic structure of the functional groups. How to design the catalytic active sites over a photocatalyst for both achieving the adsorption and activation of NB and BA molecules is very worth exploring.
Recently, defect engineering provides a feasible strategy for addressing the above problem (Jia et al., 2021, Kumar and Krishnan, 2021, Liang et al., 2021). Creating surface defect will make more surface coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUSs), which could serve as active sites to promote the absorption and coordination activation of substrate molecules over the catalyst (Kökçam-Demir et al., 2020, Rao et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2019). The empty d orbitals of transition metal ions are electron acceptors which serve as Lewis acids sites. And the unsaturated transition metal ions may serve as Lewis bases sites due to a higher electron density than the saturated transition metal ions. Thus, the well-designed unsaturated transition metal active sites may achieve the simultaneous absorption and activation of NB and BA.
Bi2MoO6 with an appropriate band gap has shown promising application in photocatalytic organic synthesis (Xie, et al., 2019). It is thermodynamically feasible for the photocatalytic one-pot coupling reaction of NB and BA to BE over Bi2MoO6 due to its suitable CB and VB potential (Jing et al., 2017, Shi et al., 2022). Meanwhile, the layered structure of Bi2MoO6 is convenient for us to prepare ultrathin Bi2MoO6 nanosheets. The surface charge rearrangement would be occurred on the ultrathin monolayer Bi2MoO6 nanosheets, exposing more unsaturated metal atoms, such as Mo5+. The unsaturated Mo5+ serves as the Lewis acid site when the unsaturated Mo5+ coordinates with the –OH group of BA. Meanwhile, it is Lewis base site when adsorbing the electron-deficient –NO2 group. This makes it possible for the synchronous adsorption of BA and NB molecules. Moreover, the Bi2MoO6 nanosheets are the ideal platform to induce the surface oxygen defect (OV). The surface OV not only induces more CUSs (Mo5+) to be exposed, but also promotes the separation of photogenerated carriers, greatly improving the photocatalytic performance (Xie et al., 2020, Lin et al., 2021). Therefore, Bi2MoO6 nanosheets with rich OV and CUSs (Mo5+) can be constructed as promising candidates for the one-pot photocatalytic coupling reaction of NB and BA.
Herein, Bi2MoO6 hierarchical microspheres consisting of monolayer nanosheets with rich surface exposed OV and unsaturated Mo sites were successfully prepared via a typical solvothermal method for the one-pot coupling reaction of NB and BA to synthesize secondary amine. The surface properties of BMO-SP, such as the surface chemical states, surface Lewis acids-bases sites and OV, were well demonstrated by XPS, in situ FTIR, CO2-TPD and EPR. The key factors for influencing this tandem reaction, the universal applicability and the stability of BMO-SP were well studied. The absorption behavior of BA and NB molecules on the surface Mo sites was revealed by DFT calculation, the in situ FTIR spectra, UV–vis DRS spectra, XPS spectra and EPR spectra. In addition, the deprotonation of activated BA to carbon-centered radical by the photogenerated h+ was traced by in situ EPR test. Finally, a possible mechanism for the one-pot photocatalytic coupling of NB and BA over BMO-SP is provided at a molecular level.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Reagents and chemicals
Sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O), Bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were purchased from Aladdin. Ethanol, Nitrobenzene (NB), Aniline (AN), Benzyl alcohol (BA), benzaldehyde (BD), N-Benzylideneaniline (BE), Glycol, Acetonitrile, Methanol were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. (SCRC). All the chemicals were of analytical grade.
2.2. Preparation of Bi2MoO6 hierarchical microspheres (BMO-SP) and bulk Bi2MoO6 (BMO-bulk)
Bi2MoO6 hierarchical microspheres were prepared by a typical solvothermal process with some adjustments (Jing, et al., 2019). 0.970 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 0.05 g of CTAB were added into 70 mL of glycol under vigorous stirring for 1 h. After uniform mixing, 0.242 g of Na2MoO4·2H2O was added to the mixture under stirring for 1 h. The final mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and treated at 180 ℃ for 3 h using an oven. After the oven was cooled to room temperature, the yellow solid product was washed using deionized water and ethanol to remove the additional ions. Finally, the prepared sample was collected after drying in an oven at 60 ℃ for 15 h. Moreover, the bulk Bi2MoO6 was prepared via the same procedure except the solvothermal time was changed to 24 h.
2.3. Photocatalytic one-pot coupling of NB and BA
The photocatalytic one-pot coupling of NB and BA was conducted in a 10 mL quartz reaction tube. 10 mg of the prepared samples, 0.4 mmol of BA, 0.1 mmol NB and 1.5 mL acetonitrile were added to the reaction tube under stir. N2 was used to remove the oxygen. After 30 min, the mixture was irradiated by a 300 W Xenon lamp (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co. Ltd., PLS-SXE300D) with a 400 nm cut-off filter for 6 h. After the reaction, the solid sample was removed and the solution was collected and detected by a Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph (GC2014C) with a Shimadzu SH-RTX-S column (length 30 m; film thickness 0.25 μm; inner diameter 0.32 mm). Due to the excess dosage of BA used, the performance of the prepared sample was evaluated by calculating the conversion of NB and the selectivity of BE. The conversion of NB and the selectivity of BE were calculated as follows:
Conversion (%) = [(C0-CNB)/C0] × 100%.
Selectivity (%) = [CBE /(C0-CNB)] × 100%.C0 and CNB respectively represent the initial and final concentration of NB, and CBE is the concentration of BE.
2.4. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation
All spin-polarized DFT calculations were carried out in Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with projector-augmented-wave (PAW) method (Kresse and Furthmüller, 1996). The exchange–correlation potential was treated by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) gradient-corrected approximation (Perdew, et al., 1993). The plane-wave energy cutoff was set to 400 eV. The stoichiometric surface of the (0 0 1) facet constructed by a 1 × 2 × 2 supercell was used to model the surface of the experimentally prepared Bi2MoO6 (Fig. 1f), where the atomic positions of the top six layers of atoms were relaxed, but the bottom layers were kept fixed at their bulk position. Van der Waals corrections were included using the DFT-D3 method of Grimme (Grimme, et al., 2010). For structural optimization, all of the atoms were fully relaxed and only the Γ point was used to sample the Brillouin zone. A vacuum space of 15 Å was used along the z-direction between the periodic images. The convergence of relaxation was checked with a 0.05 eV/Å criterion and the total energy difference was less than 10-4 eV. The adsorption energy of BA was computed as follows: Eads = Etotal – E* – EBA.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the prepared samples
The XRD patterns of the prepared BMO-SP and BMO-bulk are shown in Fig. 1 (a). All the diffraction peaks are well matched with the peaks of orthorhombic phase Bi2MoO6 (JCPDS No. 21-0102) (Shi et al., 2022), suggesting the successful preparation of orthorhombic phase Bi2MoO6. The SEM images of BMO-bulk and BMO-SP exhibit a bulk solid microsphere and a hierarchical microsphere consisting of nanosheets, respectively. Moreover, the TEM images of BMO-SP (Fig. 1 d, e) further reveal the microstructure of BMO-SP. It also shows that BMO-SP is a hierarchical microsphere and the nanosheets are near transparent, indicating their ultrathin thickness. Clear lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.274 nm are observed in Fig. 1f, attributing to the Bi2MoO6 (0 0 2) (Chen, et al., 2018). To further reveal the thickness of these nanosheets, AFM image of BMO-SP is provided as shown in Fig. 1 (g, h). The average thickness of the nanosheets is about 0.93 nm. This thickness is near a unit cell thickness of the Bi2MoO6 (Fig, 1i), indicating that BMO-SP with monolayer nanosheets is successfully prepared.
Regulating the structure of the photocatalyst to monolayer nanosheets would break the balance of the charge distribution and expose more surface unsaturated atoms. To reveal the surface chemical states of BMO-SP and BMO-bulk, XPS spectra are provided. As shown in Fig. 2a, the high-resolution Bi 4f XPS spectra of BMO-bulk and BMO-SP both show two diffraction peaks with the binding energy of 159.2 and 164.5 eV, attributing to the Bi3+ 4f7/2 and Bi3+ 4f5/2, respectively (Shi et al., 2022). For the XPS spectra of Mo 3d (Fig. 2b), the binding energy at 232.4 and 235.5 eV are assigned to Mo6+ 3d5/2 and Mo6+ 3d3/2, respectively (Jing, et al., 2017). Meanwhile, it can be observed that two new peaks at 231.3 and 234.4 eV corresponding to Mo5+ 3d5/2 and Mo5+ 3d3/2 are fitted for the Mo 3d XPS spectra of BMO-SP and BMO-bulk (Shi et al., 2022). The ratio of Mo5+ is 17% for BMO-SP while only 3% Mo5+ can be fitted for BMO-bulk (Table S1). This result confirms that more Mo5+ sites as CUSs are successfully constructed on BMO-SP. The formation process of Mo5+ is related to the formation of BMO monolayer nanosheets. The Bi2MoO6 would grow towards 2D nanosheet under the assist of CTAB and glycol. Because of the short growth time, there are still many coordination unsaturated W atoms and dangling bond on the surface of Bi2MoO6 monolayer nanosheets. Therefore, the Mo5+ is formed. Moreover, O 1s spectra (Fig. 2c) exhibit that the prepared BMO-SP has three types of surface oxygen atoms. The binding energies at 530.2, 531.4 and 533.0 eV are attributed to lattice oxygen (OL), oxygen vacancies (OV) and adsorbed oxygen species (OC), respectively (Jing et al., 2019, Shi et al., 2022). Meanwhile, the main O signal of BMO-bulk is OL. The proportion of surface OV on BMO-SP is 43% which is much higher than on BMO-bulk (7%), indicating that more surface O defects are created over the prepared BMO-SP. In addition, the EPR spectra of BMO-bulk and BMO-SP are shown in Fig. 2d. A characteristic peak with a g value of 2.003 attributes to the signal of OV (Jing, et al., 2019) be observed for the EPR spectrum of BMO-SP while there is no obvious signal for the BMO-bulk EPR spectrum, further confirming the presence of surface oxygen defects on BMO-SP. All the results demonstrate that the prepared BMO-SP with a unique nanosheet structure has abundant OV and surface unsaturated Mo sites. These rich surface sites would provide great support for the adsorption and coordination activation of BA and NB.

The photo-absorption property of BMO-SP and BMO-bulk is investigated using the UV–vis-DRS spectra. As shown in Fig. 3a, the yellow BMO-SP and BMO-bulk exhibit well visible light absorption. The band gap values of BMO-SP and BMO-bulk are 2.45 and 2.83 eV, respectively. To further reveal the CB and VB potential of BMO-SP and BMO-bulk, Mott-Schottky plots of BMO-SP and BMO-bulk are provided (Fig. 3b, c). It shows that the flat-band potentials of BMO-SP and BMO-bulk are −0.61 V and −0.68 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 7 which can be converted to −0.41 V and −0.48 V vs. NHE (Shi, et al., 2020). The slopes of Mott-Schottky plots are positive, indicating the n-type semiconductor characteristic of BMO (Cao, et al., 2018). The CB potential of an n-type semiconductor is near its flat band potential. Therefore, the CB potentials of BMO-SP and BMO-bulk are −0.41 V and −0.48 V vs. NHE, respectively. According to the band gap value, the VB potentials of BMO-SP and BMO-bulk are calculated to be 2.04 V and 2.35 V vs. NHE, respectively. In addition, the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 3d) exhibit that the specific surface areas of BMO-SP and BMO-bulk are 38.4 m2/g and 12.1 m2/g. The bigger specific surface area of BMO-SP is due to the nanosheet hierarchical structure. It would make more surface active sites be exposed for absorbing and activating organic molecules. The transient photocurrent response curves and Nyquist impedance plots of BMO-bulk and BMO-SP are shown in Fig. (e, f). The BMO-SP shows a higher photocurrent density and a smaller impedance arc radius than BMO-bulk, suggesting its better photo-generated carriers separation and transfer ability. The surface OV is well-known site to capture photogenerated electrons, which greatly accelerates the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Thus, BMO-SP with more surface oxygen defects and unique hierarchical structure has a better separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers.

3.2. Performances of the prepared samples
The prepared BMO-bulk and BMO-SP are applied for the synthesis of secondary amines via the one-pot photocatalytic coupling of NB and BA. As shown in Table 1, BMO-SP possesses good photocatalytic performance for the tandem reaction of BA oxidation and NB reduction. The conversion of NB is 98% in an oxygen-free environment under visible light irradiation. The selectivity of BE and AN is 97% and 3% with 10 h reaction time (Table 1 Entry 1). The the apparent quantum yields (AQY) of BMO-SP and BMO-bulk are 6.3% and 0.6%, respectively (Table S3). It is obvious that the performance of BMO-SP is much higher than that of BMO-bulk. The reason is that BMO-SP with hierarchical ultrathin nanosheet structure has abundant surface OV and CUSs for synergistically achieving the adsorption, activation and conversion of BA and NB molecules. In addition, some control experiments are also conducted as shown in Table 1 Entry 3–6. The results illustrate that the photocatalytic coupling of NB and BA cannot be conducted without light irradiation or a catalyst. In the dark, when we use an oil bath to control the temperature to 333 K, no NB is reduced, indicating that the coupling of NB and BA in this system is driven by the visible light. Moreover, we also employ P25 for the photocatalytic coupling of NB and BA. However, P25 cannot be photoexcited under visible light, resulting in no performance. Even using the Xe lamp irradiation without a cut-off filter, P25 shows a low performance due to the lack of surface defects and active sites to absorb and activate BA and NB molecules. Thus, the prepared BMO-SP with suitable energy band structure and rich surface defects is a very applicative photocatalyst for the photocatalytic coupling of NB and BA under visible light irradiation.

To further deep study this photocatalytic system, the photocatalytic coupling of NB and BA over BMO-SP with different reaction conditions is conducted. As shown in Fig. S1a, as time increases, the conversion of NB and the selectivity of BE are increased. This result indicates that the photocatalytic coupling of NB and BA is done in stages. BA and NB need to be converted to BD and AN, respectively. Then, BE would be formed via the condensation of BD and AN. When the time arrives 10 h, the NB is almost completely converted and the selectivity of BE is about 97%. Considering the long time irradiation would shorten the service life of the Xenon lamp, the photocatalytic coupling of NB and BA is controlled for 6 h to study the influence of other factors. The optimal molar ratio of BA and NB is further explored. The result (Fig. S1b) shows that BMO-SP exhibits the best conversion of NB with a high selectivity of BE in a molar ratio of BA and NB (4:1). Thus, the molar ratio of BA and NB is 4:1 for this system. In addition, the used catalyst is cleaned with methanol for 3 times and collected after drying in 60 ℃ for 6 h to study its photocatalytic stability. Fig. S2 clearly demonstrates that the prepared BMO-SP still maintains a good photocatalytic performance after four times cycle, suggesting the good photocatalytic stability of BMO-SP. The structural stability of BMO-SP is also studied. As shown in Fig. S3 (a, b), the XRD pattern of BMO-SP shows negligible change after four times recycling and the SEM image of BMO-SP after recycling experiment still has a hierarchical nanosheet structure. These results indicate the good structure stability of the prepared BMO-SP sample.
The above experiment results illustrate that the prepared BMO-SP can achieve the photocatalytic coupling of NB and BA under visible light irradiation. To further expand its applicability, various nitroarenes are selected to estimate the scope of photocatalytic coupling coupled reactions. As exhibited in Table 2, the prepared BMO-SP also possesses good performance for the photocatalytic coupling of BA and other nitroarenes, suggesting the wide applicability of BMO-SP. However, the reaction rates are influenced by different substituents groups. Generally, the nitroarenes with strong electron-withdrawing groups (-Cl, -Br) can be easily converted. Conversely, the electron-donating groups (–OH and –CH3) would cause a decreased conversion. It has been reported that the electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups in nitroarenes would reduce and increase the electronic density of –NO2 groups, respectively (Xie, et al., 2019). Thus, different substituents greatly influence the reduction of the –NO2 group, resulting in a different activity.

3.3. The adsorption and coordination activation of BA and NB
In order to elucidate the intrinsic nature of the good performance of BMO-SP, the surface/interface interactions for BA and NB molecules over the active sites of BMO-bulk and BMO-SP are deeply investigated. As we know, the adsorption behavior of reactant molecules on the catalyst contributes a large effect on catalytic performance. Therefore, in situ FTIR is employed to reveal the adsorption behavior of BA molecules over the prepared catalyst. As shown in Fig. 4 a (2), after absorbing BA molecules, four characteristic peaks of BA molecules can be observed, assigning to the C=C stretching vibration (1495 cm−1), the CH2 scissoring vibration (1452 cm−1), the OH scissoring vibration (1365 cm−1) and the OH stretching vibration peaks (1206 cm−1), respectively (Liang et al., 2014, Song et al., 2018b). Even if the sample is further treated at 180 ℃ for 5 min (Fig. 4 a (3)), these characteristic peaks still retained, indicating the strong chemisorption between BA molecules and BMO-SP. In comparison, the BMO-bulk shows weak adsorption for BA molecules. This result suggests that the rich surface CUSs of BMO-SP are beneficial to the adsorption of BA. In addition, the in situ FTIR spectra of BMO-SP and BMO-bulk absorbed NB molecules are also provided. As shown in Fig. b (2), there are two characteristic peaks at 1522 and 1346 cm−1 attributed to the stretching vibration peaks of NO2 groups (Shi, et al., 2020). After further degassing, the two peaks also be existed. Especially, the peak at 1346 cm−1 has an obvious shift to low wavenumber, revealing that the –NO2 groups of NB can be selectively chemisorbed on BMO-SP via forming surface coordination species. It would make the reduction of NB easier. The in situ FTIR spectra of BMO-bulk absorbed NB molecules (Fig. 4d) exhibit a weak signal of the NO2 stretching vibration peaks, also demonstrating that the BMO-bulk with scanty CUSs has a weak interaction for NB molecules. Thus, the conversion of NB over BMO-bulk is only 5%. All the results indicate that the rich surface CUSs on BMO-SP greatly enhance the absorption interaction of BA and NB molecules over the catalyst.

As stated earlier, the surface Lewis acids and bases sites can selectively chemisorb and activate –OH and –NO2 groups, respectively. In view of this, to investigate the surface Lewis acids and Lewis bases properties of the samples, the in situ FTIR of pyridine adsorption and CO2-TPD experiments are conducted. As shown in Fig. 5a, due to the unremoved chemisorbed glycol molecules on BMO-SP, the CH2 scissoring vibration peak of glycol is observed at 1455 cm−1. After absorbing pyridine, the peaks with a wavenumber of 1600, 1579 and 1442 cm−1 can be observed, attributing to the pyridine absorbed on the surface Lewis acids sites of BMO-SP (Tamura, et al., 2012). Meanwhile, these two peaks in Fig. 5b are very weak, indicating that BMO-SP with a hierarchical nanosheet structure can expose more surface Lewis acids sites for the adsorption and activation of BA molecules. Combining the XPS results and the previous studies, these surface Lewis acids sites are corresponding to the surface unsaturated Mo sites of BMO-SP. Therefore, the unsaturated Mo atoms can serve as Lewis acids sites to combine with the electron-donating –OH groups to form a –C–O···Mo coordination, resulting in the BA molecule being chemisorbed and activated. Similarly, the electron-withdrawing –NO2 groups in NB molecules tend to be absorbed on the Lewis bases sites. To confirm the presence of surface Lewis bases sites on BMO-SP, CO2-TPD profiles are provided as shown in Fig. 5c. The prepared BMO-SP sample has an obvious CO2 adsorption peak while there is no peak for BMO-bulk, demonstrating that BMO-SP possesses more surface Lewis bases sites than BMO-bulk. It also confirms that the unsaturated Mo atoms in BMO-SP can be considered as the surface Lewis bases sites. Correspondingly, the surface Lewis base site for BMO-bulk is hard to detect due to the negligible defect and CUSs in BMO-bulk. The NB molecules may be absorbed on the Lewis base sites of BMO-SP via the –N–O···Mo coordination. Thus, the surface unsaturated Mo atoms of BMO-SP greatly promote the adsorption and activation of BA and NB molecules.

Furthermore, XPS test is conducted to reveal the binding energy changes of every element in BMO-SP after absorbing BA and NB molecules. Interestingly, Mo 3d XPS spectra (Fig. 6a) exhibit different changes after absorbing BA and NB molecules. Compared with the pristine Mo 3d spectrum, the peaks of Mo 3d shift to low and high binding energy after absorbing BA and NB molecules, respectively. It indicates that the chemisorption between the substrate molecules and BMO-SP induces electron transfer, causing the activation of BA and NB molecules. Meanwhile, the peak fitting results (Table S2) clearly show the percentage of Mo5+ and Mo6+ before and after absorbed BA and NB. After absorbing BA molecules, the percentage of Mo6+ is decreased due to the electron-donating property of –OH groups. This result confirms that the surface unsaturated Mo atoms of BMO-SP are responsible for absorbing BA molecule via forming the –C–O···Mo coordination. Oppositely, the percentage of Mo5+ is decreased after absorbing NB molecules, also suggesting the formation of the –N–O···Mo coordination which results in the electron transfer from the surface unsaturated Mo atoms to the electron-withdrawing –NO2 group. Moreover, Bi 4f has no obvious change after absorbing BA and NB molecules, indicating the negligible influence of Bi 4f for absorbing the substrate molecules. Furthermore, the UV–vis DRS results of BMO-SP absorbed BA and NB (Fig. S4) both have a redshift, also demonstrating that the surface coordination species is formed (Song, et al., 2017). However, no obvious shift can be observed in the UV–vis DRS spectra of BMO-bulk due to the lack of surface CUSs. These experiment results highlight that the surface CUSs of BMO-SP effectively promote the adsorption and activation of BA and NB molecules.

DFT calculations were also employed to further illustrate the adsorption behavior of BA and NB molecules on BMO-bulk and BMO-SP. Based on the structure and surface properties of BMO-bulk and BMO-SP, we constructed the structures of pristine and defective Bi2MoO6(0 0 1), as shown in Fig. S5. The pristine Bi2MoO6(0 0 1) is saturated with saturated Mo6+ sites on its surface, while the defective Bi2MoO6(0 0 1) has exposed CUSs (Mo5+). Based on these two modes, we simulated the adsorption behavior of BA and NB. As shown in Fig. 7a and Fig. 7b, BA and NB molecules absorbed on the Mo6+ sites of the pristine Bi2MoO6(0 0 1) via the –C–O···Mo and –N–O···Mo coordination, respectively. Whereas on the defective Bi2MoO6(0 0 1), the BA molecules absorbed on the unsaturated Mo5+ sites due to the presence of CUSs (Fig. 7c) The two O atoms of –NO2 groups tend to be coordinated to the two unsaturated Mo sites (Fig. 7d), forming a stable adsorption configuration. The calculations show that the absorption energies of BA and NB on the defective Bi2MoO6(0 0 1) are −2.69 eV and −2.12 eV, respectively. which is more negative than the absorption energy of BA (-1.30 eV) and NB (-0.92 eV) on the pristine Bi2MoO6(0 0 1). This result is consistent with the experiments that the unsaturated Mo sites on the surface greatly facilitate the adsorption of BA and NB molecules. Thus, the one-pot photocatalytic coupling of nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol is favored on the defective BMO-SP.

3.4. Mechanism of one pot photocatalytic coupling of BA and NB
The EPR test is conducted to further investigate the photocatalytic process. As shown in Fig. 8a, the EPR spectra of BMO-SP absorbed BA remain the OV signal. When the light is irradiated, this signal would be enhanced, suggesting that the OV can be the electron enrichment center to gather photogenerated electrons. When NB is adsorbed on BMO-SP, The OV signal of BMO-SP + NB dark is smaller than that of BMO-SP (Fig. S6), indicating that nitrobenzene molecules are adsorbed on the unsaturated Mo sites, which results in a decreased OV signal. In addition, the EPR spectra of BMO-SP absorbed NB (Fig. 8b) exhibit a new peak under light irradiation. According to the in situ FTIR, XPS and DRS results, the NB can be chemisorbed on BMO-SP via forming the –N–O···Mo coordination. The photogenerated electrons gathered by OV would be transferred from BMO-SP to NB via the –N–O···Mo coordination. Thus, the NB molecules would be activated to electron-rich states and a new EPR signal is observed (Song et al., 2018b, Taketa et al., 1978). Considering the negligible surface OV and unsaturated Mo atoms, BMO-bulk shows no obvious EPR signal. As we know, the one-pot photocatalytic coupling of NB and BA needs the oxidation of BA molecules to carbon-centered radical and H+ by photogenerated h+. Fortunately, the VB potential of BMO-SP (2.04 V vs.NHE) is positive enough to oxide BA (+1.98 V vs. NHE). In order to confirm the formation of carbon-centered radical, in situ EPR spectra (Fig. 8c) of BMO-SP and BMO-bulk in CH3CN with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) and 0.4 mmol BA under N2 atmosphere are provided. In the dark, no signal peak can be observed, indicating the reaction is driven by light. The typical characteristic peak of carbon-centered radical (Li et al., 2017, Jiang et al., 2018) can be observed under visible light irradiation, confirming that the photogenerated h+ of BMO-SP would make the deprotonation of BA molecules. The carbon-centered radical can be further converted to BD, easily and the formed H+ can be the hydrogen source for the reduction of NB. There is a position shift on peak of carbon-centered radical of “BMO-bulk + BA light” and “BMO-SP + BA light”. This may be attributed to the magnetic correlation effect induced by OV (Wu, et al., 2022). Moreover, the signal peak intensity of BMO-SP is stronger than that of BMO-bulk, also elucidating the reason for the better performance of BMO-SP.

Based on the above results and discussions, a possible mechanism (Scheme 1) is proposed to clarify the photocatalytic coupling of BA and NB over BMO-SP. At the initial stage, BA and NB molecules would be selectively absorbed on the surface unsaturated Mo sites via the –C–O···Mo and –N–O···Mo coordination, respectively. It makes the surface charge redistribution, effectively activating BA and NB molecules. Then, BMO-SP is photoexcited under visible light irradiation, generating electrons and holes. The photogenerated h+ would attack the activated BA molecules to form the carbon-centered radicals and H+. The unstable carbon-centered radicals would be further oxidized to BD. Meanwhile, the photogenerated electron would be transferred to the surface for reducing the activated NB molecules to AN via the –N–O···Mo coordination and the hydrogen source is provided via the surface H+ transfer. Finally, BD and AN would be coupled to BE. The synergy of surface unsaturated Mo sites and oxygen defects greatly promotes the photocatalytic coupling of BA and NB.

4. Conclusion
In summary, the one-pot photocatalytic coupling of benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene to N-Benzylideneaniline is achieved by creating OV to induce the rich surface unsaturated Mo5+ sites over Bi2MoO6. The surface unsaturated Mo atoms would absorb and activate benzyl alcohol molecules and nitrobenzene via the –C–O···Mo and the –N–O···Mo coordination, respectively. Moreover, the surface exposed OV also promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. The activated BA and NB molecules are easily oxidized and reduced by photogenerated holes and electrons, respectively. Therefore, the performance of BMO-SP is 12 times higher than that of BMO-bulk. This work successfully achieves the tandem reaction by the surface defect engineering and deeply reveals the surface/interface adsorption, activation and transformation process of two substrate molecules over the coordinatively unsaturated active sites.
