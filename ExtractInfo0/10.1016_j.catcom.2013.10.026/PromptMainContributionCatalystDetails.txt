Tunable activity of [Ga]HZSM-5 with H2 treatment: Ethane dehydrogenation




1. Introduction
Gallium incorporated HZSM-5 zeolites ([Ga]HZSM-5) are recognized as effective bi-functional catalysts for converting light alkanes to aromatics [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. The dehydrogenation of paraffins, is played by the incorporated Ga species [1], [2], [3], whereas Brønsted acid catalyzes the oligomerization of the olefins and their subsequent aromatization. While the study of the type of Ga species has spanned over past years, controversy remains on which gallium species is responsible for the catalytic activity [1], [9], [10], [11], [12]. It was first believed that the Ga2O3 obtained after calcination, was the active catalytic species for dehydrocyclization [9], [13] and H2 dissociations [14]. However, it was later found that the intrinsic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 was better than that of Ga2O3 alone [15]. Since this discovery, several investigations attempt to elucidate the structure of the Ga species under the reducing atmosphere and its interaction with Brønsted acid sites. Researchers have reported that the Ga2O3 species are readily reduced during pretreatment with hydrogen or with the hydrocarbon feed to Ga2O species that migrate into the zeolite channels [3], [10], [16], [17].
(1)
These mobile species react with the zeolitic Brønsted acid, resulting in the formation of reduced cationic, Ga+ species bound to a negative framework charge of the zeolites [3], [10], [16], [17].
(2)
Alternatively, several reports [3], [18], [19], [20] suggest that Ga(OH)2+ is primarily exchanged into the negative framework of HZSM-5. Such species can dehydrate to form GaO+ at high temperature [3], [21].
(3)
The GaO+ would be dispersed over the exchangeable sites in the framework, however, such Ga species can readily react with H2, finally forming the Ga+ species [22], [23].
(4)
It is also suggested that H2 not only keeps Ga species in its reduced forms but can also chemisorb on Ga+ species and consecutively dissociate to form dihydrido gallium complex (GaH2+) [24].
(5)
The existence of the dihydrido gallium species is in good agreement with the observed adsorption band at ~ 2040 cm− 1 [24]. Kazansky et al. [21], [24] reported that such Ga species are relatively stable and decompose only partially in a reductive hydrogen atmosphere at elevated temperatures.
One could expect that upon calcination, the gallium oxides (Ga2O3, GaO+) are most likely species present in the catalysts. The oxide species may include aggregates both on the external surface and in the micro-pores of the zeolite. These species may even retain under the reducing stream of H2, if the reduction process is not complete. However, the presence of Ga+, and GaH2+ would be expected under flow of H2 as suggested previously. As most of the studies on [Ga]HZSM-5 focus on alkane aromatization, the Ga active species initially promoted alkane dehydrogenation has not been fully understood.
Accordingly, this research has attempted to demonstrate the dehydrogenation activity of various Ga species that can be purposely prepared using different treatments (i.e. reducing and steaming). Ethane was used as a model feed to selectively probe the dehydrogenation activity without inference from further aromatization of the olefin produced. A pulsed reactor allows an observation of an initial activity and also deactivation if applicable. H2-TPR and NH3-TPD provide insight on reducibility and acidity of the Ga species formed under various treatments. In addition, the effect of Si/Al ratio of the host zeolite was highlighted. Due to the high activity obtained from this results, [Ga]HZSM-5 may also become an alternative dehydrogenation catalyst for light alkanes.
2. Experimental details
HZSM-5 samples were commercially obtained from Zeolyst International (Si/Al ~ 11 and 28) and Sud-Chemie (Si/Al ~ 165). Conventional impregnation of HZSM-5 with Ga(NO3)3 was employed to obtain 3 wt.% Ga loading. The sample was then calcined at 550 °C for 4 h in a flow of dry air. Hereafter, the catalysts will be designated as [Ga]HZSM-5(Si/Al) according to their Si/Al ratio. In addition, the b-[Ga]HZSM-5 (3 wt.% Ga loading) was prepared by physical mixing of HZSM-5 with bulk Ga2O3 (particle size ~ 50–200 nm) in order to evaluate bi-functional behavior of the catalyst. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiments were carried out using a TCD detector. All temperature-programmed measurements were taken with a heating rate of 10 °C/min, with He as the carrier gas. For the pulse reaction studies, 15 mg of catalyst was pretreated in a flow of He or H2 (60 mL/min). After the pretreatment, 25 μL of 5 v/v% ethane in He or H2 gas was injected into the pretreated catalyst bed to obtain its initial activity. The pulses were repeated for different reaction conditions/treatment. The products of the ethane pulse reaction were on-line analyzed by the FID detector.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
The characteristics of the zeolite samples including Si/Al ratio of the host zeolite, % Ga loading, and BET surface area are shown in Table 1. The Ga contents of the impregnated and physical mixed catalyst are comparably in the same range. Fig. 1a shows the TPR profile of the Ga modified HZSM-5(28) zeolite samples. With the Gaussian deconvolution (Fig. 1b), two major reduction were assigned to (i) the well-dispersed Ga species (~ 510 °C) such as small Ga2O3 particles and/or GaO+ species interacting with the zeolite framework and (ii) bulk Ga2O3 particles (~ 600 °C) separated from or loosely supported on the zeolite matrix [20]. Detail of these species has fully described in previous work [25].

The samples were first calcined at 550 °C and cooled down to 50 °C in air; then, heated in a flow of 2% H2/Ar (30 mL/min) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min up to 900 °C. After primary TPR experiments, the samples were then cooled to 50 °C in a flow of He and the experiments were repeated under the same condition.
After the primary H2-TPR, the sample was cooled down to 100 °C, then purged with air for 2 h in order to recover the Ga oxide species. Secondary and tertiary H2-TPR was then performed. It clearly showed that the reduction temperature shifted toward lower temperature with increasing hydrogen consumption (Fig. 1c and d) indicating that re-dispersion of the Ga species was obtained after series of reduction/oxidation cycles. It is suggested that the Ga2O3 particles can be partially reduced and subsequently migrated to the negative framework sites. When this species was re-oxidized, a smaller particle of Ga species was generated resulting in the shift to a lower reduction temperature. An increase in hydrogen consumption also indicates the better reducibility of the Ga species formed after a series of re-dispersion.
One may expect that dispersion of Ga species may be better inferred from XRD or TEM. However, no Ga2O3 or Ga phase is observed by XRD for all cases. In our previous work [26], TEM provided additional clues for a better dispersion of Ga species when the catalyst was treated with steam. However, it may be a mistake to deduce Ga dispersion from TEM in these samples. This is because, unlike other metals that trend to form aggregates upon reduction, Ga cannot be readily reduced to metallic species (Ga). The cationic species, such as Ga+ and GaO+ formed after reduction with H2, would also be highly dispersed at the exchangeable sites and cannot be observed by TEM.
In fact, the previously published TPR study on the same catalyst systems [25] describes the dispersion of Ga species in detail. The observed reduction peak at high temperature indicates that the incorporated Ga species agglomerate into larger Ga2O3 clusters at higher loading (~ 6 wt.%), and are probably segregated to the outer surface of ZSM-5. As a series of TPR is repeated, the shift toward lower reduction temperature is clearly noticed and this must be derived from the reduction of different species. Moreover, the increase in H2 consumption, as the TPR is repeated, may well support the reversible association of H2 of highly dispersed Ga species (Ga+ to GaH2+) proposed in literatures [24]. With these reason we believe that, for [Ga]HZSM-5, the nature and dispersion of Ga species can better be investigated using TPR.
Although acid site is not active site for dehydrogenation, NH3-TPD provides a clue for the dispersion of the reduced Ga species into the exchangeable sites. It can be seen from NH3-TPD in Fig. 2 that when the Ga species was introduced into zeolite, strong acid sites (~ 300–500 °C, [27], [28]) is slightly decreased while the weak acid sites and physisorbed NH3 were slightly increased (50–200 °C). The observed change in acidity distribution, when Ga is incorporated, is in line with acidity measured by IPA-TPD [25] and MAS-NMR [26] of the same catalyst system previously reported.

The samples (0.05 g) were dried in flowing He at 425 °C for 2 h. Adsorption of 10% NH3/He until saturation took place at 50 °C, then the samples were flushed with He at the same temperature for 2 h. TPD measurements were done from 50 to 700 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min, with He as the carrier gas.
The above observation suggested that, as the catalyst was calcined, the incorporated Ga were mostly retained as isolated oxides (Ga2O3) and cationic species (GaO+) that would also occupy some of the exchangeable sites. Accordingly, the acidity of the [Ga]HZSM-5 is relatively reduced as compared to that of HZSM-5. However, a noticeably decrease in strong acid site can be seen when the catalyst was reduced in H2. This is presumably due to the better dispersion of Ga species as cationic species (Ga+ and GaH2+), which is consistent with the previous suggestions that reduced Ga species (i.e., Ga+ and GaH2+) act as exchangeable cations and replace the acid sites [24], [25], [29]. Together with the TPR results, the reduction of the [Ga]HZSM-5 can readily disperse the incorporated Ga species, predominantly as the Ga cationic species on the exchangeable sites. It should be noted that, for [Ga]HZSM-5(11) and [Ga]HZSM-5(28), number of exchangeable sites in this sample are in excess, as compared to the Ga loading (Al/Ga > 1, Table 1). In the case of [Ga]HZSM-5(165), the oxide species may include aggregates on the surface of the zeolite. These species may even retain under the stream of H2.
It is also worth noting that no attempt to prove or propose new Ga species in GaHZSM-5 was made in this work. All species are referred to those previously reported and proposed in literatures. Additional characterization including effect of high temperature treatment can be deduced from some of our own characterization results as well as previously published spectroscopic studies on the same catalyst systems [25], [26].
3.2. Dehydrogenation of ethane
From Table 2, it can be clearly seen that the conversion of ethane to ethylene is increased with reaction temperature for all experiments. For HZSM-5(28), a low conversion of ethane is obtained either using H2 or He as carrier gas. While [Ga]HZSM-5(28) show a higher dehydrogenation activity, particularly in the H2 stream. This implies that the reduced Ga species (Ga+, GaH2+) possesses a high dehydrogenation activity, as compared to the Ga oxide species (Ga2O3, GaO+). In order to clearly compare the catalytic activity of the Ga species under H2 and He atmosphere, the pulsed reaction was carried out as shown in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. Ethane pulsed reaction over [Ga]HZSM-5(28) catalyst with different reaction condition. exp 1 = 5% ethane/He was feed using He as carrier gas, exp 2 = the 10 pulses of pure H2 was injected to the catalyst, and then 5% ethane/He was feed using He as carrier gas, exp 3, 4 = the exp 2 was re-operated, exp 5 = 5% ethane/H2 was feed using H2 as carrier gas, exp 6 = the exp 2 was re-operated, exp 7 = the exp 5 was re-operated, exp 8 = the exp 2 was re-operated.
Reaction condition: Catalyst = [Ga]HZSM-5(28), Reaction temperature = 650 °C, Pulsed volume = 25 μL.
From Fig. 3, ~ 25% conversion of ethane was obtained at 650 °C using He as a carrier gas (Exp. 1). It is believed that Ga2O3 particles and/or GaO+ were the active species under this reaction condition. As the catalyst was calcined and only treated with He, the incorporated Ga are mostly retained as isolated Ga2O3 and exchangeable GaO+ (from dehydration of Ga(OH)2+, Eq. (3)) [3]. Such Ga oxide species in [Ga]HZSM-5(28) can provide a relatively higher activity of ethane dehydrogenation, as compared to HZSM-5 (~ 2% conversion). Again, it is interesting to note that only ethylene and hydrogen are produced and there is no change of activity with the number of ethane pulses. This clearly shows that there is an excess of Ga active sites and the initial activity can be obtained from every single pulse.
When the catalyst was in situ reduced with 10 pulses of pure H2 and ethane was then pulsed under He (Exp. 2), a marked increase in activity was initially observed, but slowly decline to a certain level (~ 30% conversion) after 7–8 pulses of ethane. It was suggested that, by pulsing with H2, a reduced Ga species (presumably Ga+) could be generated. Moreover, the Ga+ formed may also chemisorb H2 to form a H2-incorporated Ga species, “GaH2+” ((Eq. (5)) as reported earlier [24]. These two species seem to be responsible for the high activity observed initially, as compared to that over the oxide forms. However, at high reaction temperatures, the “GaH2+” cannot be stabilized in the absence of H2 as reported by Kazansky et al. [21], [24]. It would be readily decomposed to the reduced Ga+ species after H2 is withdrawn. Hence, a decrease in catalytic activity can be observed (~ 40% to ~ 30% conversion after 7–8 pulses) in Exp. 2. The reduced Ga+ species appears to be less active, as compared to the H2-incorporated Ga species (GaH2+), but somewhat more active, as compared to the Ga oxide species. The same operating condition as Exp. 2 was performed for Exps. 3 and 4 and similar results can be repeatedly observed. It is, therefore, assumed that H2 chemisorption of Ga+ and decomposition of GaH2+ species in [Ga]HZSM-5(28) is readily reversible.
Since the decomposition of such GaH2+ to Ga+ would be favored in the absence of H2, one could expect that by keeping the catalyst in a H2 stream, decomposition of the so-called GaH2+ may well be prevented. Hence, H2 mixed with ethane was then pulsed in the reaction (Exp. 5) under the H2 carrier. It was found that a relatively high activity was obtained (~ 55% conversion) and there is no change in catalytic activity throughout a series of ethane pulses under H2 as the carrier gas. Accordingly, it is believed that the H2-incorporated Ga species (presumably GaH2+) is kept under this condition and this species seems to be more active, as compared to other Ga species mentioned previously. To elucidate that, the carrier was switched back to He (Exp. 6), and while pulsing of ethane was continued. It can be clearly seen that, a result as in Exps. 2–4 was exactly reproduced for Exp. 6. This again demonstrates that the H2-incorporated Ga species (GaH2+) could only be preserved under the reducing H2 stream. As a non-reducing stream of He replaced H2, the active “GaH2+” was gradually decomposed to “Ga+”, leading to a decrease in dehydrogenation activity as observed in Exps. 2–4. Exps. 7 and 8 were further performed to verify the above phenomenon and, as expected, the process was clearly reversible.
From the above results, it can be concluded at this stage that dehydrogenation activity of [Ga]HZSM-5 is largely dependent upon the Ga species present. The H2-incorporated Ga species (presumably GaH2+) exhibits higher activity, as compared to the reduced Ga+ and Ga oxide species, respectively. This is probably due to the noble-metal-like characteristics of such H2-incorporated Ga species [30], as compared to others. If this species is really GaH2+, one could expect that such 16-electrons complex with soft hydrido ligands would interact well with hydrogen in a manner similar to the noble metals. However, this species appears to be present only under H2 stream.
According to the above observation, the active Ga species would be highly dispersed as exchangeable cationic species. This can be demonstrated by the reaction using the bulk Ga2O3 support on HZSM-5(28) (b-[Ga]HZSM-5(28)) under non-reducing stream of He as shown in Fig. 4.

Reaction condition: Catalyst = [Ga]HZSM-5(28), b-[Ga]HZSM-5(28), st-b-[Ga]HZSM-5(28) and red-b-[Ga]HZSM-5(28), Reaction temperature = 550–750 °C, Carrier gas = He, Reactant = ethane.
As expected from Fig. 4, a relatively lower ethane conversion can be obtained over b-[Ga]HZSM-5(28) (Ga particle size ~ 50–200 nm, not shown), as compared to the [Ga]HZSM-5(28). It is noted that the conversion over b-[Ga]HZSM-5(28) is only 2–3% higher than that over HZSM-5 (Table 2) suggesting that, predominantly, the observed activity is thermally driven. After steaming at 425 °C for 2 h, the dehydrogenation activity can be enhanced (st-b-[Ga]HZSM-5(28)). It is believed that water can react with the bulk Ga2O3 forming relatively well-dispersed GaO(OH) species that can consecutively react with Brønsted acid sites to form an exchangeable GaO+ species [26], [31].

(7)
The better dispersion of Ga species in st-b-[Ga]HZSM-5(28) can be supported by the TPR, as shown in Fig. 5a. It is clearly seen that a H2 consumption peak of the Ga species in the steamed sample (st-b-[Ga]HZSM-5(28)) shifted toward a lower temperature, as compared to that of the b-[Ga]HZSM-5(28) (~ 670 °C). This is probably because reduction of the dispersed Ga species (presumably GaO(OH) or GaO+) obtained from the steam treatment would be more feasible, as compared to the bulk Ga2O3. With the Gaussian deconvolution, a weaker signal at ~ 670 °C was observed over the st-b-[Ga]HZSM-5(28), indicating that less bulk Ga2O3 was retained in this sample. In other words, larger parts of the bulk Ga2O3 may well be re-dispersed by the reaction with steam ((Eqs. ((6), (7))) to form GaO(OH) or GaO+ that possesses a higher dehydrogenation activity, as compared to the bulk Ga2O3 (Fig. 4).

The samples were first calcined at 550 °C and cooled down to 50 °C in air; then, heated in a flow of 2% H2/Ar (30 mL/min) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min up to 900 °C.
After H2 reduction at 750 °C, the catalysts (red-b-[Ga]HZSM-5(28)) become even more active as shown in Fig. 4. In line with the change in the nature of the Ga species observed upon H2 reduction (Fig. 1), it is believed that the some parts of bulk Ga oxide species could be reduced and re-dispersed on the zeolite support, presumably forming exchangeable Ga+ species that is more active than the Ga oxide species as discussed earlier.
To emphasize the role of these exchangeable Ga species, the same loading of bulk Ga2O3 on HZSM-5 with a higher Si/Al (b-[Ga]HZSM-5(165)) was prepared (Table 1). After reduction at 750 °C, the dehydrogenation activity in He was compared as shown in Table 2. It is clearly seen that, despite of the same Ga2O3 loading, the lower dehydrogenation activity can be obtained from b-[Ga]HZSM-5(165), as compared to that from b-[Ga]HZSM-5(28). This is expected because b-[Ga]HZSM-5(165) would possess relatively less acid sites and, according to Eqs. (2), (7), less exchangeable Ga species would be obtained in this catalyst after reduction. In line with a separate measurement, higher number of dispersed Ga species was obtained for the same Ga loading on zeolite with lower Si/Al (Fig. 5b). From the above results, it is interesting to note that the acidity of zeolite determines the dispersion of the Ga species and hence the high dehydrogenation activity.
4. Conclusions
As [Ga]HZSM-5 was calcined in air and only treated with He, the incorporated Ga oxide species provide ~ 25% ethane dehydrogenation at the reaction condition studied (650 °C). After reduction, the catalyst shows a slightly higher activity (~ 30% conversion), presumably due to the presence of more active reduced Ga species, i.e. Ga+. Under H2 stream, the active site can reversibly chemisorb H2 forming so called “GaH2+” that is even more active for ethane hydrogenation (~ 55% conversion). However, such H2-incorporate Ga species (GaH2+) can gradually decompose in the absence of H2. Nevertheless the process is readily reversible. In addition, steam treatment and reduction with H2 can disperse the bulk Ga oxide into the higher active cationic Ga species (presumably GaO+ and Ga+). In addition, the number of acid sites of the host zeolite determine the Ga species dispersion and hence the dehydrogenation activity. This result indicates that [Ga]HZSM-5 can be an alternative candidate for light alkane dehydrogenation catalyst.
