Abstract
Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) was investigated over unconventional catalysts, i.e. binary La2O3-ZrO2 and Y2O3-ZrO2 materials with or without tiny amounts (0.005 or 0.05 wt.%) of Ru in form of nanoparticles with the size of about 1.1 nm. The results of catalytic tests and catalyst characterization with complementary techniques enabled us to conclude that coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) and neighboring lattice oxygen are catalytically active sites responsible for C3H6 formation. Supported Ru species contribute to a minor extent to PDH but promote generation of Zrcus sites upon catalyst reductive treatment or in situ under PDH conditions. The concentration of Zrcus sites can also be increased through doping of ZrO2 with La2O3 or Y2O3 with the latter being a more efficient dopant. High activity, selectivity, and durability of our catalysts were verified by comparing their performance under industrially relevant conditions with that of a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material in a series of 60 PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles at 550, 600, and 625 °C.

1. Introduction
Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production [1]. The most common processes for synthesis of this olefin are steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions [2]. Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3], [4]. The latter process is performed over supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts [4], [5], [6]. Cr-containing compounds are, however, toxic and lead to health and environmental concerns. On the other hand, Pt-based catalysts are environmentally friendly. To ensure high dispersion of Pt species, which is important for high activity and selectivity, such catalysts, however, have to be treated under chlorine atmosphere after removal of carbon deposits [5]. High price of Pt is another shortcoming of Pt-based catalysts.
Stimulated by the drawbacks mentioned above, various research groups in both industry and academia have attempted to improve available commercial catalysts or to develop suitable alternatives. Among the latter materials, those containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have been identified to be the most suitable candidates [5], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Isolated ions of Zn2+, Co2+, or Fe2+ on the surface of SiO2 were also reported to be active in the PDH reaction [16], [17], [18].
In our recent short communications, we introduced alternative type of alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, which have typically been used as supports, i.e. Al2O3 [19] and ZrO2 promoted with La2O3 [20]. In comparison with usually applied supported materials, surface defects such as coordinatively unsaturated surface metal cations (Alcus or Zrcus) were suggested to play an important role in alkane dehydrogenation over the above unconventional catalysts. We also reported that PDH activity of ZrO2 promoted with La2O3 could be increased after depositing hydrogenation-active metals such as Ru, Cu, Ni, and Co [20]. The metals were not assumed to be directly responsible for the increase in the activity but helped to increase the concentration of Zrcus sites through reaction-induced reduction of ZrO2. Further comprehensive studies are required to prove the dehydrogenation role of Zrcus and to understand how its concentration can be tuned to affect the catalyst activity.
From a structural viewpoint, such surface sites are located at anion vacancies. The latter can be created upon doping of ZrO2 with oxides of metal with oxidation state of lower than 4+ as a result of charge compensation [21]. It is also well known that the ability of dopants for the substitution of Zr cations and formation of homogeneous binary solid solutions strongly depend on the ionic radius of dopant metal cation, which should be close to that of Zr4+ (0.79 Å). Not only the radius but also the kind of dopant influence structural and mechanical properties of zirconia as well as the concentration of oxygen vacancies [22]. Concentration of such defect sites and, therefore that of Zrcus sites, can also be increased through high-temperature reduction of zirconia, e.g. by H2. The higher the reduction temperature, the higher the number of oxygen vacancies [23]. Reducibility of ZrO2 can also be improved when depositing hydrogenation-active metals on the surface of zirconia. As documented in several previous studies [24], [25], [26], the role of supported metals was to dissociate gaseous hydrogen to highly reactive atomic hydrogen species. The latter can leave the metal surface and spillover onto the support surface, where they react with lattice oxygen yielding water and anion vacancies [27], [28].
In comparison with our previous short communication [20], the purpose of the current work was to elucidate the fundamentals of propane dehydrogenation over ZrO2-based catalysts, which are required for tailored catalyst design. In particular, we focused on (i) the kind of catalytically active sites as well as (ii) factors affecting their formation and, in particular, activity. To investigate the effect of dopant on catalytic activity, ZrO2 was promoted by either La2O3 or Y2O3. In addition, these both binary oxides were impregnated with tiny amounts (0.005 or 0.05 wt.%) of Ru in form of well-defined (about 1.1 nm in diameter) Ru nanoparticles. In situ UV–vis analysis was used to monitor the effects of promoter and reduction conditions on formation of anion vacancies (indirectly Zrcus sites). Their concentration as a function of the type of dopant, the presence of Ru, and reduction temperature in an H2 flow was determined from O2-pulse titration experiments in the temporal analysis of product (TAP) reactor. Catalytic tests were performed after different reduction treatments to correlate the activity with the amount of Zrcus sites in the samples. Finally, the catalysts were tested under alternating C3H8 and O2 feeds in the temperature range from 550 to 625 °C to check their activity, selectivity, and durability in comparison with an industrially relevant K-CrOx/Al2O3 material.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
RuCl3·nH2O (37.2 wt.% Ru, Merck), ethylene glycol (99.8%, Aldrich), NaOH (99%, Merck), acetone (>99%, Roth), toluene (99.99%, Acros), and ethanol (absolute, J.T. Baker) were used for synthesis of Ru nanoparticles (Ru NP) as described in Ref. [29]. Catalysts were synthesized by impregnation of commercial supports (LaZrOx (ZrO2 doped with 10 wt.% La2O3, MelChemicals) and YZrOx (ZrO2 doped with 8 wt.% Y2O3, MelChemicals)) with colloidal solution of Ru NP. The samples were denoted according to the weight percentage of ruthenium: 0.005Ru/LaZrOx, 0.005Ru/YZrOx, 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx. They were calcined in flowing air directly before starting catalytic tests.
A reference catalyst (K-CrOx/Al2O3) was prepared according to the protocol described in a patent of Süd-Chemie [30]. KOH (Merck), CrO3 (99.9%, Sigma Aldrich), and Al2O3 (Saint-Gobain NorPro) were used as starting materials. Briefly, two aqueous solutions with the required amounts of CrO3 and KOH were separately prepared and then mixed together. Hereafter, Al2O3 was impregnated with the resulting solution. The catalyst precursor was dried at 120 °C overnight and finally calcined at 760 °C for 4 h. The nominal concentration of Cr2O3 and K2O in the resulting catalyst was 19.7 and 0.93 wt.%, respectively.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Specific surface areas (SBET) of the samples were determined from nitrogen physisorption experiments at 77 K using a Belsorp mini II setup (Bel Japan). Desorption isotherms were evaluated according to the BET method.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Theta/Theta diffractometer X’Pert Pro (Panalytical) with Cu Kα radiation (α = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA) and an X’Celerator RTMS detector. Phase composition of the samples was determined using the program suite WinXPOW (Stoe & Cie) with inclusion of the powder diffraction file PDF2 of the international center for diffraction data.
Transmission electron microscopy (JEM-ARM200F, E = 200 kV) was used to determine size distribution of Ru NP after their deposition from ethylene glycol solution onto copper grid.
Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Varian 715-ES) was applied to ascertain Ru concentration.
In situ UV–vis measurements were carried out using an Avantes spectrometer (AvaSpec-2048-USB2-RM) equipped with a high-temperature reflection UV–vis probe, an Ava-Light-DH-S-BAL deuterium-halogen light source, and a CCD array detector. The probe consisting of six radiating optical fibers and one reading fiber was threaded through the furnace to face the wall of the quartz tube reactor at the position where the catalyst (250 mg) was located [31]. Before recording UV–vis spectra, the sample was heated up to a certain temperature (550, 600, or 650 °C) in Ar and then treated in 20 vol.% O2 in Ar flow for 1 h. After the oxidative treatment, the catalyst was purged with Ar followed by treatment in an H2 flow (57 vol.% H2 in Ar) for 1 h. UV–vis spectra were recorded in the range from 225 to 800 nm every 1 min during the reduction stage. Barium sulfate (99.998%, Aldrich) was used as a white standard.
For visualizing the progress of reduction process, a relative reflectance (Rrel) was defined as the ratio of the reflectance of sample treated in H2 to that of the fully oxidized one as given in Eq. (1). From this relative reflectance, we calculated the relative Kubelka-Munk function F(Rrel) according to Eq. (2).

The concentration of anion vacancies in the catalysts reduced at 550, 600, or 650 °C was determined by O2-pulse experiments performed at 550 °C in the temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor [32], [33]. The catalyst (50 mg, particle size: 250–710 µm) was placed in a quartz-tube microreactor between two layers of quartz (particle size: 250–350 µm). Before starting transient experiments, the catalyst was treated in the following way. It was initially heated in an O2 flow (10 ml/min) up to 550 °C with a heating rate of 10 K/min. Hereafter, the catalyst was either flushed with N2 at 550 °C for 5 min, or further heated in N2 flow (10 ml/min) up to 600 or 650 °C. At 550, 600, or 650 °C it was exposed to an H2 flow (57 vol.% H2 in N2) for 1 h. After finishing the reductive treatment, the catalyst was either cooled down to 550 °C (for reduction at 600 and 650 °C) during evacuation to ca. 70 Pa or directly evacuated (for reduction at 550 °C). Then it was exposed to high vacuum of approximately 10−5 Pa.
The pulse experiments were performed using an O2:Ar = 1:1 mixture. Ar (5.0) and O2 (4.5) were applied without additional purification. The pulsing was continued until no changes were observed in the intensity of O2 pulses during the last 30–40 pulses. Such experiment was repeated at least 3 times for each reduction temperature. The amount of oxygen consumed was quantified from signals at AMUs 32 (O2) and 40 (Ar) recorded with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (HAL RC 301 Hiden Analytical).
2.3. Catalytic testing
All catalytic tests were performed at 1 bar in an in-house developed setup consisting of 15 continuous-flow fixed-bed tubular reactors made of quartz. The rate of propene formation was determined from the amount of propene formed at a degree of propane conversion below 10% (Eq. (3)). In a first series of tests, the catalysts (40 mg) were heated in an N2 flow up to 550 °C followed by feeding air for 1 h. Hereafter, they were purged with N2 for 15 min and then exposed to a flow (20 ml/min in total) of C3H8 (40 vol.% C3H8) in N2.

To investigate the effect of reduction treatment on catalyst activity, another series of tests was performed as follows. After the above oxidative treatment, the catalysts (40 mg) were reduced in a flow of 57 vol.% H2 in N2 at different temperatures (550, 575, 600, 625, and 650 °C) and then tested for their PDH activity at 550 °C with a total flow of C3H8-N2 mixture (40 vol.% C3H8) of 20 ml/min. All tests in this series were performed with the same sample for each catalyst. First the catalysts were reduced at 550 °C. After the corresponding PDH test at 550 °C, the catalysts were reoxidized at 550 °C and then reduced at another temperature followed by performing PDH at 550 °C and reoxidation at the same temperature. The order of reduction temperature in the series was 550, 575, 600, 625, and 650, and again 550 °C.
To determine an apparent activation energy of propene formation, the rate of propene formation was measured at 525, 550, 575, 600, and 625 °C. The catalysts (40 mg) were heated in an N2 flow up to 525 °C and then calcined in an air flow for 1 h. After flushing with N2 for 15 min, they were treated in an H2 flow (57 vol.% H2 in N2) for 1 h and again purged with N2. Hereafter, the catalysts were exposed to a flow of C3H8-N2 mixture (40 vol.% C3H8) and the rate of propene formation was measured. In a next step, the catalysts were treated as described above but at 550, 575, 600, or 625 °C, where the rate was also measured. To achieve propane conversion below 10% at each temperature, the total flow of the reaction feed was adjusted to 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 ml/min for 525, 550, 575, 600, and 625 °C respectively. Another series of tests was similarly carried out but the reductive H2-treatment was always performed at 625 °C before measuring the rates of propene formation between 525 and 625 °C. The rate is reported after 150 s on stream.
To benchmark our catalysts, we compared their performance with that of K-CrOx/Al2O3 (reference material) in 60 PDH/regeneration cycles at 550, 600, and 625 °C using total flow of C3H8-N2 mixture of 10, 40, and 60 ml/min, respectively. In these experiments, the amount of each catalyst sample was 300 mg. Before the first PDH stage all catalysts were calcined in a flow of air at 550 °C for 1 h. The PDH and regeneration stages continued for 30 and 15 min, respectively, and were separated by purging with N2 for 15 min. The regeneration stage was performed in flowing air at the PDH temperature.
The feed components and the reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890) equipped with PLOT/Q (for CO2), AL/S (for hydrocarbons), and Molsieve 5 (for H2, O2, N2, and CO) columns as well as with flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic materials and their characterization
The specific surface areas (SBET) of bare LaZrOx and YZrOx were determined to be 84.2 and 73.9 m2/g, respectively. According to X-ray diffraction analysis, these materials were exclusively composed of the tetragonal phase (Fig. S1 in the Supporting Information (SI)). No reflexes of crystalline La2O3 or Y2O3 were detected. Thus, in agreement with previous studies [34], [35], doping of ZrO2 with La2O3 or Y2O3 leads to stabilization of ZrO2 in the tetragonal phase due to creation of oxygen vacancies in the structure of ZrO2 [36].
The 0.005Ru/LaZrOx, 0.005Ru/YZrOx, 0.05Ru/LaZrOx, and 0.05Ru/YZrOx catalysts were prepared by impregnation of LaZrOx or YZrOx with a colloidal solution of Ru NP with an average diameter of 1.1 nm. TEM image and size distribution of Ru NP deposited from ethylene glycol solution onto copper grid are shown in Fig. S2 in SI. As proven in our previous study with Rh/Al2O3 also possessing tiny amount of Rh, the NP size does not significantly change after their deposition on supports and even after approximately 180 h on stream in partial oxidation of methane at 800 °C [29], [37]. The concentration of Ru determined by ICP analysis in 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx was found to be 0.06 wt.% and 0.03 wt.% respectively. The samples 0.005Ru/LaZrOx and 0.005Ru/YZrOx contain too low amount of Ru to be precisely determined.
3.2. Formation of Zrcus sites and quantifying their concentration
Formation of oxygen vacancies upon catalyst reduction in H2 was monitored by in situ UV–vis analysis. In order to avoid any contribution of electron transitions related to Ru to the UV–vis spectrum of zirconia, we used bare LaZrOx and YZrOx. The samples were initially heated in air to a certain reaction temperature (550, 600, or 650 °C) and tempered for 1 h. Hereafter, the air flow was replaced by an H2 flow (57 vol.% H2 in Ar). Since neither reaction temperature nor position of UV–vis fiber was changed in this experiment, the obtained UV–vis spectra represent solely reaction-induced changes of the catalysts. For an illustration of such changes, temporal evolution in F(Rrel) of LaZrOx and YZrOx at 550 °C is given in Fig. 1. The corresponding results at 600 and 650 °C are shown in Fig. S3 in SI. A band with a maximum at around 420 nm rose up during H2 treatment upon increasing time on stream. Such changes in the UV–vis spectra should be related to formation of oxygen vacancies. According to Gionco et al. [38], creation of oxygen vacancies leads to the appearance of several transition energy levels of 3.5–3.8 eV above the valence band of ZrO2. Electron transitions from these levels into the conduction band are accompanied by optical absorption in the visible light threshold. This results in a change of catalyst color from white to grey, as we actually observed in our experiments. Thus, we can safely conclude that oxygen vacancies and accordingly Zrcus sites are formed upon H2 treatment of LaZrOx and YZrOx. The rate of their formation increased with treatment temperature and was higher for the latter catalyst as can be concluded from the temporal profiles of F(Rrel) at 420 nm at 550, 600, and 650 °C in Fig. 1(c) and (d).

Since UV–vis spectroscopy cannot be used for quantifying the concentration of anion vacancies, we performed O2-multipulse experiments at 550 °C in the TAP reactor with LaZrOx, YZrOx, 0.05Ru/LaZrOx, and 0.05Ru/YZrOx reduced at 550, 600, or 650 °C. The concentration of anion vacancies was calculated from the amount of O2 consumed under the assumption that one O2 molecule fills two vacancies. For the regular tetragonal ZrO2, removal of one oxygen from the bulk results in creation of 4 Zrcus. However, the coordination of lattice oxygen changes when considering corners, steps, and surface that makes it difficult to determine how many Zrcus sites are really created upon reductive catalyst treatment. Thus, the concentration of anion vacancies should be considered as semi-quantitative measure of Zrcus.
Fig. 2 shows the effect of catalyst composition and reduction temperature on the concentration of anion vacancies. As expected from in situ UV–vis and catalytic tests, the concentration increased with an increase in the temperature, at which the catalysts were treated in H2. Bare YZrOx has about two times higher concentration of such sites than LaZrOx, while the difference practically disappears for the corresponding materials with Ru NP. The Ru-containing catalysts possess, however, around 100 times higher number of anion vacancies compared with bare YZrOx and LaZrOx. For checking whether large oxygen consumption over 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx can be explained by oxidation of Ru to RuO2, we performed a control O2 titration test with 0.05Ru/Al(60 wt.%)-Si(40 wt.%)Ox (non-reducible support) possessing the same Ru nanoparticles as the ZrO2-based catalysts. Only around 6.6 · 1017 O atoms were consumed per one gram of 0.05Ru/Al(60)-Si(40)Ox reduced at 550 °C. This amount is equal to approximately 10% of the amount required for complete conversion of Ru to RuO2 and is close to the number of surface Ru atoms. It is also significantly lower than 5 · 1018 and 7 · 1018 O atoms consumed per one gram of 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx respectively. Thus, such high oxygen consumption over the latter materials should be related to refilling oxygen vacancies of ZrO2. This phenomenon (support over-reduction in the presence of supported metals) has frequently been described in the literature for low noble metal loadings (0.01–1 wt.%) [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. We cannot, however exclude that bulk oxygen vacancies were also titrated in these experiments owing to high oxygen mobility within ZrO2 lattice. As previously reported in Ref. [44], bulk oxygen diffusion in ZrO2 occurs between 300 and 450 °C, i.e. at lower temperatures than 550 °C in our O2 titration tests.

3.3. Kinetics of propane dehydrogenation
To compare the catalyst PDH activity, we determined the initial (after 150 s on stream, Fig. S4 in SI) rate of propene formation at 550 °C at a degree of propane conversion below 10%. The tests were performed with both oxidized and reduced samples for elucidating the effect of catalyst treatment (oxidative vs. reductive) on its PDH activity. Irrespective of the treatment and catalyst composition, propene was formed with selectivity between 98 and 99%. The main side products were CH4, C2H4, and C2H6. Table 1 shows the rate of propene formation over oxidized catalysts. One can see that all YZrOx-based catalysts are more active than their LaZrOx-based counterparts. It is also obvious that the presence of Ru increases catalytic activity. However, the increase is not directly proportional to the metal loading and depends on the kind of second metal in the binary ZrO2-based catalysts. Possible fundamental origins of the effects of ZrO2 promoter and the presence of Ru on catalyst PDH activity are discussed in Section 3.4 under consideration of characterization data presented in Section 3.1.

0.005Ru/LaZrOx 0.22 203 170
0.05RuLaZrOx 0.53 202 202

YZrOx 0.38 174 151

The effect of reductive catalyst treatment on the rate of propene formation was studied in a series of PDH tests at 550 °C with the catalysts reduced at different temperatures before the PDH reaction. When comparing the rates obtained over LaZrOx-based catalysts oxidized (Table 1) or reduced at 550 °C (Fig. 3), one can conclude that the latter materials showed up to approximately two times higher activity. The positive effect of reductive treatment is significantly less pronounced for the YZrOx-based catalysts. As in case of oxidized catalysts, the presence of supported Ru NP also improved the activity of reduced catalysts.

Fig. 3. Effect of reductive treatment temperature on r(C3H6) measured at 550 °C over (a) LaZrOx- and (b) YZrOx-based catalysts. Open symbols represent r(C3H6) measured after completing tests with the catalysts reduced at higher temperatures (up to 650 °C) followed by reoxidation and reduction at 550 °C.
Another important observation from Fig. 3 is the influence of temperature of catalyst reductive treatment on the rate of propene formation measured at 550 °C. For bare LaZrOx and YZrOx, the rate augmented with increasing reduction temperature. This effect must be related to an increase in the concentration of catalytically active sites, which were formed on the surface of LaZrOx and YZrOx during their reduction at high temperatures. Compared to the Ru-free binary materials, the activity of the 0.005Ru/LaZrOx and 0.005Ru/YZrOx catalysts only slightly increased, whereas the activity of the 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx catalysts even decreased (Fig. 3) with an increase in reduction temperature.
The following explanation suggests that such behavior of the latter materials cannot be due to irreversible catalyst deactivation caused by reduction at high temperature. As described in Section 2.3, the reduction temperature was increased from 550 to 650 °C with steps of 25 K, while the catalyst sample was not exchanged but oxidatively regenerated at 550 °C after testing PDH at the same temperature. For checking catalyst stability, we performed a control PDH test with a reduction step at 550 °C after completing PDH tests with the same sample, which had been reduced at higher temperatures (up to 650 °C). It is seen in Fig. 3 (open symbols) that the high-temperature treatment did not significantly influence initial (after first reduction of fresh sample at 550 °C) catalyst activity.
To check whether and how Ru NP influence propane dehydrogenation kinetics, we also determined apparent activation energy (Ea) of propene formation in two series of catalytic tests performed between 525 °C and 625 °C. It is worth noting that propane conversion without any catalyst (blank activity) was only 0.2 and 1.6% at 550 and 625 °C respectively thus even with the latter value being well below about 10% in the presence of catalyst. In a first series, the catalysts were reduced at a certain reaction temperature in H2 before measuring the rate of propene formation at the same temperature. The obtained Arrhenius plots are shown in Fig. 4 (closed symbols). For all samples, we obtained a linear dependence of ln(r(C3H6)) on 1/T in the 525–575 °C range. No deviation from the Arrhenius plot for LaZrOx and YZrOx was observed at higher temperatures (≥600 °C), but the slope of the Arrhenius plot for 0.005Ru/LaZrOx and 0.005Ru/YZrOx between 575 °C and 625 °C was lower than between 525 °C and 575 °C (Fig. 4(b)). Even a decrease in the rate of propene formation was observed for 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx when the reaction temperature was increased from 600 to 625 °C (Fig. 4(c)). Any mass transport limitations can be excluded as a possible reason for the nonlinearity of ln(r(C3H6)) on 1/T dependence observed for Ru-containing catalysts above 575 °C because LaZrOx and YZrOx showed higher activity but followed the same Arrhenius dependence between 525 °C and 625 °C. The unusual high-temperature behavior of Ru-containing catalysts is supposed to be associated with the effect of reductive treatment on the concentration of PDH active sites (see Section 3.4).

We now analyze the Arrhenius plots in Fig. 4 (closed symbols) for the temperature range between 525 °C and 575 °C, i.e. where a linear dependence was obtained. For this temperature range an apparent activation energy (Ea) was determined for each catalyst studied (Table 1). Two important conclusions can be drawn: (i) the Ea values for Ru-containing samples were lower than for bare binary oxides and (ii) all YZrOx-based catalysts have lower Ea than their LaZrOx-based counterparts. It should be, however, mentioned that these values do not correspond to the PDH reaction exclusively according to the below reasoning. As seen in Fig. 3, the rate of propene formation at 550 °C could be increased when the catalysts had been reduced at higher temperatures in H2 probably due to an increased concentration of active sites created upon the catalyst reduction. For the catalysts that were reduced at PDH temperature, the determined Ea values should additionally include the energy required for formation of active sites during reductive treatment.
To exclude the effect of reduction temperature on the formation of such sites, we performed additional tests at different reaction temperatures but with the catalysts, which had always been reduced at 625 °C, i.e. the highest reaction temperature. In this case, the concentration of PDH active sites does not depend on reaction temperature and so determined Ea should be related to the PDH reaction only. Arrhenius plots for all catalysts reduced at 625 °C are shown in Fig. 4 (open symbols). In comparison with the test described above (catalyst reduction at PDH temperature), a linear dependence between ln(r(C3H6)) on 1/T was obtained for both bare LaZrOx and YZrOx as well as 0.005Ru/LaZrOx and 0.005Ru/YZrOx catalysts in the whole temperature range (525–625 °C). However, irrespective of the type of catalyst reductive treatment, the rate of propene formation over 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx followed an Arrhenius dependence between 525 and 575 °C and practically did not change with a further increase in temperature. Such unusual high-temperature behavior might be due to over-reduction of the samples in situ under reaction conditions thus resulting in a change of the intrinsic activity of PDH active sites or their concentration (see Section 3.4).
The acquired Ea values for LaZrOx, YZrOx, 0.005Ru/LaZrOx, and 0.005Ru/YZrOx are given in Table 1. They are lower than those determined for the same catalysts but reduced at PDH temperature, because they do not include the energy required for generation of PDH active sites in the latter case. Moreover, the Ea values for LaZrOx and YZrOx became very close to those for 0.005Ru/LaZrOx and 0.005Ru/YZrOx (approximately 170 and 150 kJ/mol respectively). This strongly suggests that Ru NP are not the main catalytically active sites.
3.4. Active sites for propane dehydrogenation and factors affecting their concentration
On the basis of the above results and our previous study [20], as well as under consideration of literature data on alkane dehydrogenation over CrOx- [45], [46], [47] and GaOx-containing catalysts [48], [49], we put forward that a PDH active site consists of Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen (Fig. 5(a)). Such pair is responsible for breaking C–H bond in C3H8 resulting in the formation of surface Zrcus-C3H7 and O–H species. After the elimination of the β-hydrogen in the former species, gas-phase C3H6 and H2 are formed and the active site is regenerated.

Fig. 5. Schematic illustration of (a) propane activation over Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen and (b) migration of bulk lattice oxygen to the surface.
Concentration of Zrcus sites was proven to rise upon doping of ZrO2 with Y2O3 or La2O3, with the former being a more efficient promoter (Fig. 2(a) and (b)). Such sites are also generated when ZrO2-based catalysts are reduced in H2 before the PDH reaction. Supporting tiny amounts of Ru on the surface of YZrOx and LaZrOx affected catalyst reducibility particularly at low temperatures (Fig. 2). The supported metal catalyzes this process due to its ability for H2 activation followed by removal of lattice oxygen in form of water with a simultaneous formation of Zrcus sites. However, when designing new catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, one should avoid their over-reduction under PDH conditions or upon reductive catalyst treatment. As seen in Fig. 3, high-temperature reduction of 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx results in a decrease in their high PDH activity. Such behavior can also be obtained when performing PDH reaction above 575 °C, where catalyst over-reduction occurs in situ by propane, propene, or hydrogen (Fig. 4(c)). We have three general suggestions for interpreting the effect of catalyst over-reduction on PDH activity. As mentioned above, both Zrcus and neighboring surface lattice oxygen are a part of the PDH active site (Fig. 5(a)). Concentration of the latter species will, however, decline with an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction; thus, C3H8 dehydrogenation will be hindered. Alternatively, the intrinsic activity of Zrcus sites may change with an increase in their unsaturation degree, which depends on the amount of oxygen removed from the catalyst. These two options are indirectly supported by the following discussion. To estimate an apparent degree of surface reduction (degree of removal of surface lattice oxygen), we used the number of lattice oxygen in the most stable (1 0 1) face of tetragonal zirconia and the concentration of anion vacancies shown in Fig. 2. The obtained values are summarized in Table 2. For bare YZrOx and LaZrOx, the highest degree achieved after catalyst reduction at 650 °C was lower than 1%, while the corresponding values for 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx were 11 and 13% respectively. The reduction degree of these catalysts treated at 600 °C in H2 was 3.2 and 6.4% and significantly higher than those for bare YZrOx and LaZrOx. The high reduction degree of 0.05Ru/LaZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx may be a reason for a change in the slope in the corresponding Arrhenius plots above 575 °C.

Catalysts Degree of removal of surface oxygen/%
550 °C 600 °C 650 °C
LaZrOx 0.002 0.006 0.020
0.05Ru/LaZrOx 0.54 3.2 11.0
YZrOx 0.014 0.03 0.10
0.05Ru/YZrOx 1.4 6.4 13.0
Another possible explanation of the abnormal Arrhenius dependence of Ru-containing catalysts can be related to high oxygen mobility in the lattice of zirconia. When a certain surface reduction degree is achieved, bulk lattice oxygen diffuses to the surface and fills surface oxygen vacancies. As a consequence, the concentration of surface Zrcus sites decreases (Fig. 5(b)). The higher the reduction temperature and degree, the greater is the oxygen mobility [50].
3.5. Practical relevance of ZrO2-based catalysts
To check practical relevance of our catalysts, we performed additional tests consisting of 60 PDH/regeneration cycles under industrially relevant degrees of propane conversion. The regeneration stage consisted of oxidation in air for 15 min followed by flushing with N2 for 15 min. No reductive catalyst treatment was carried out. K-CrOx/Al2O3 was also investigated under the same conditions as a reference material. For all catalysts tested, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) with respect to propane was 1.57, 6.29, and 9.43 h−1 at 550, 600, and 625 °C respectively. The catalysts were initially tested at 550 °C (20 cycles) followed by an increase in temperature to 600 °C for the next 20 cycles. Hereafter, 10 cycles were again carried out at 550 °C and finally the catalysts were tested at 625 °C (10 cycles). The selectivity toward propene was higher than 85% for all catalysts during the whole experiment.
Time-on-stream profiles of propene yield in the first catalytic cycle at each reaction temperature are shown in Fig. 6. The corresponding data for all cycles at each temperature are shown in Fig. S5 in SI. The yield over all LaZrOx-catalysts continuously increased with rising time on stream at 550 °C and passed over a maximum after first 10 min in case of YZrOx-based catalysts. Such increase confirms in situ reduction of samples under reaction conditions and therefore formation of Zrcus sites.

For LaZrOx-based catalysts, the presence of Ru influenced the extent of propene yield increase, which was most pronounced for 0.05Ru/LaZrOx. For all samples, the yield at higher temperatures (600 °C and 625 °C) passed through a maximum or continuously decreased with time on stream. The decrease is due to catalyst deactivation caused by blocking of catalytically active sites by carbon deposits formed from propene. The catalysts completely restored their performance after oxidative regeneration at reaction temperature (Fig. S5 in SI).
To compare the catalysts in terms of propene production, we determined an overall amount of propene (mC3H6) produced in each PDH cycle. To this end, we integrated the time-on-stream profiles of propene yield under consideration of WHSV. The obtained mC3H6 values for all 60 PDH cycles are given in Fig. 7. All catalysts showed good durability from cycle to cycle at 550 °C. The amount of propene produced over K-CrOx/Al2O3 was only slightly higher than that over YZrOx-based catalysts, which performed similar to each other irrespective of Ru loading. LaZrOx-based samples yielded noticeably lower propene amount, which was positively affected by Ru presence. As expected the mC3H6 values at 600 °C are significantly higher than at 550 °C. Again, K-CrOx/Al2O3 showed the highest average productivity. However, the difference with respect to ZrO2-based catalysts became less pronounced. This is due to different activation/deactivation kinetics of the catalysts, with K-CrOx/Al2O3 and 0.05Ru/YZrOx showing the highest deactivation rate (Fig. 6(b)). All catalysts did not practically change their productivity within 20 PDH cycles at 600 °C and in the following 10 PDH cycles at 550 °C performed after the tests at 600 °C.

The amount of propene produced within one PDH cycles could be further increased when the PDH reaction was performed at 625 °C (Fig. 7) but only over LaZrOx and 0.005Ru/LaZrOx, since they were least deactivating. These catalysts performed superior to K-CrOx/Al2O3. The catalysts with 0.05 wt.% Ru produced the lowest propene amount, which even slightly decreased from cycle to cycle. This is probably related to over-reduction of these catalysts under PDH conditions, i.e. some irreversible changes in the structure/morphology of binary oxides might happen under alternating dehydrogenation/reoxidation cycles.
In summary, ZrO2-based catalysts showed both high activity and durability in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, which were similar to those of a K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material. The obtained knowledge about the nature of active sites provides fundamentals for further improving PDH performance by a proper catalyst design. Nevertheless, deep understanding of factors governing the kinetics of C3H8 activation, formation of side products and, in particular, catalyst deactivation is still required. This is topic of continuing research in our group.
4. Conclusions
In this study we demonstrated that unconventional ZrO2-based materials are active and durable for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation and perform similar to a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material. Their catalytic behavior was established to depend strongly on the type of dopant, the presence and concentration of Ru on their surface, as well as the temperature of reductive treatment. All these factors influence concentration of Zrcus, which together with neighboring lattice oxygen participate in activating C–H bond in C3H8 to yield C3H6. In comparison with La2O3, Y2O3 was found to be a more efficient promoter for ZrO2 in terms of generation of Zrcus sites and accordingly PDH activity. Reductive treatment of the catalysts in an H2 flow at high temperatures significantly increases catalytic activity due to creation of Zrcus sites. The presence of Ru on the surface of ZrO2-based materials accelerates reduction of ZrO2 thus also yielding such sites. However, to ensure high PDH activity, catalyst over-reduction should be avoided because it either results in a drop in the concentration of surface lattice oxygen also playing an active role in propane activation, or favors oxygen diffusion from the bulk to fill surface anion vacancies thus decreasing the concentration of Zrcus sites.
