 Based on the details provided in the document, this does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses CO2 assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over VOx-based catalysts, but does not have a focus on converting propane to propylene specifically. Therefore, I will output that the document is not relevant.
