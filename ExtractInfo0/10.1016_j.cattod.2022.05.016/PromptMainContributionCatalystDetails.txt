Acetonitrile formation from ethane or ethylene through anaerobic ammodehydrogenation
The on-purpose production of acetonitrile from ethane or ethylene through conventional aerobic ammoxidation faces the challenge of CO2 and NOx formation. Here we show an anaerobic ammodehydrogenation (ADeH) process for acetonitrile formation from ethane or ethylene. For ethane ADeH, we identified that among various second metal promoters (Co, Zn, Ga, In, Sn, Ce, Rh, Zr, Mn, and Pd), only Co demonstrated a promising promotion effect on the benchmark Pt/HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 30) catalyst. We show that the presence of Co enhanced the activity, selectivity, and stability, simultaneously, when the Pt loading is 0.05 wt%. However, the presence of excessive Co decreased the activity and selectivity when the Pt loading is 0.5 wt%. For ethylene ADeH, we show that the Re/HZSM-5 catalyst is significantly more active than the Zn, Co, In, Ga, and Cu modified HZSM-5 catalysts. The selectivity and space-time-yield of acetonitrile are up to 80% and 1300 μmol/g/min, respectively, over the optimized Re/HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 80) catalyst. We suggested that an appropriate balance between the metal functionality (for dehydrogenation) and acid density (for amination) be critical for both ethane and ethylene ADeH.
1. Introduction
The unprecedented increase in natural gas liquid (NGLs) production in the US provided cheap and abundant ethane as the feedstocks for the chemical industry [1]. However, as a result of the shifting feedstock from naphtha to ethane for steam cracking, the production of C3+ petrochemical products, such as propylene, butylene, and aromatics (BTX), is expected to decrease, which therefore requires the development of on-purpose catalytic techniques to synthesize these critical chemicals from the inexpensive light alkanes [2]. Consequently, the direct conversion of ethane and propane to olefins and BTX through dehydrogenation [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8] and dehydroaromatization [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19] have been extensively studied more recently. Alternatively, light alkanes can be co-processed with NH3 (usually in the presence of O2) for the direct production of nitriles, such as hydrogen cyanide [20], acetonitrile [21], and acrylonitrile [22], as the value-added chemicals. However, these catalytic processes remain challenging, especially under anaerobic conditions.
Acetonitrile is an important solvent with medium-polarity that is miscible with water and a range of organic solvents. It has been widely used as a solvent in the battery (because of its relatively high dielectric constant), refineries (for butadiene purification), and other manufacturers. Acetonitrile is also a common building block in organic synthesis, it can be converted into ethylamine, acetic acid, and acetamide, as the precursors to medicine, pesticide, and paints. In industry, acetonitrile is recovered (as a by-product) during the propylene ammoxidation (SOHIO Process [23]) that aims at acrylonitrile production. Therefore, the production of acetonitrile strongly depends on the acrylonitrile capacity: the global chemical industry experienced an acetonitrile shortage during 2008–2009 due to the declined production of acrylonitrile. Therefore, an on-purpose technique for selective acetonitrile production from the abundant ethane or ethylene could be an important alternative to the current industry process.
Acetonitrile can be produced from ethane or ethylene through ammoxidation using either the conventional mixed metal oxide or the metal exchanged zeolites as the catalysts [21], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51]. According to the pioneering work by Li and Armor [25], [26], the rate of acetonitrile formation from ethane ammoxidation over the Co exchanged zeolite (Hβ) was raised by 1–2 orders of magnitude in contrast to the mixed metal oxides (Nb-Sb-Al and Cr-Zr-Mo). Our recent studies showed that while the Co/HZSM-5 catalyst is more active in ethane ammoxidation [50], the Sn modified HZSM-5 catalyst demonstrated significantly higher C- and N-based acetonitrile selectivity [51]. However, the optimal Sn/HZSM-5 catalyst still shows up to 20% CO2 and 30% NOx + N2 selectivity during ethane ammoxidation [51]. In order to completely preclude the formation of CO2 and NOx, we tried the reaction in the absence of O2, which turned the reaction from aerobic to anaerobic. The anaerobic process – called ammodehydrogenation (ADeH) – can be realized over a bi-functional metal modified HZSM-5 catalyst through a tandem dehydrogenationaminationdehydrogenation mechanism [52]. It shows significantly higher activity and selectivity than the conventional ammoxidation process [52]. Noteworthily, although the formation of acetonitrile from ethylene and NH3 has been previously investigated [53], [54], our study demonstrates that acetonitrile can be directly produced from ethane and NH3 with decent activity under anaerobic conditions. The only other attempt similar to our study was made by Denton and Bishop about 70 years ago [55], which, however, was not successful due to the low activity and selectivity of their Mo/Al2O3 catalyst.
While our previous study shows that Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst is efficient for ethane ADeH at relatively low temperatures [52], the catalyst shows relatively higher methane selectivity. Additionally, both the activity and stability of the catalysts significantly decreased at lower Pt loading. In this paper, we show that the catalytic performance of the Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst can be tuned by adding Co as a promoter. Besides ethane ADeH, we also show that the same concept can be employed for the highly selective acetonitrile synthesis from ethylene and NH3 (ethylene ADeH). Although the reaction between ethylene and NH3 has been found ineffective over the Pt/HZSM-5 according to our previous study [52], here we show such a reaction can be efficiently realized over the Re modified HZSM-5 catalyst. We demonstrated that the catalytic performance during the present catalytic systems can be tuned by the metal functionality in zeolites.
2. Experimentals
2.1. Catalyst preparation
2.1.1. Catalysts for ethane ADeH
The bimetallic Cox-Pty/HZSM-5 catalysts, where x and y represent the nominal loading (wt%) of Co and Pt, were prepared through co-impregnation. Firstly, the NH4-ZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 30, specific surface area ∼400 m2/g, Alfa Aesar) was calcinated in the muffle furnace at 560 °C (ramp 20 °C/min) for 6 h under stagnant air to obtain HZSM-5. Then, based on the desired nominal loading of Co and Pt, the HZSM-5 zeolite was impregnated with appropriate amounts of the aqueous solutions of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, Co(NO3)2.6 H2O (Chemsavers), 0.0005–0.005 gcobalt/ml, and tetraammineplatinum(Ⅱ) nitrate, Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Millipore Sigma, ≥ 50.0% Pt basis), 0.005–0.5 mgPt/ml. The slurry (1 g of HZSM-5 in 10 ml of solution) was stirred at room temperature for 2 h before being transferred to a rotary evaporator to remove water under a vacuum of 150 mbar at 65 °C. The obtained sample was dried under air at 120 °C for 12 h, and then calcined at 560 °C for 6 h in a tube furnace at a ramp of 5 °C/min under 100 ml/min dry air.
For comparison purposes, the monometallic Pt0.05/HZSM-5, Pt0.5/HZSM-5, and Co2/HZSM-5 catalysts were also prepared according to the same procedure described above.
2.1.2. Catalysts for ethylene ADeH
The preparation of Re/HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 30–280) catalysts can be found in our previous paper [56]. Specifically, the rhenium species, with nominal loading 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 wt%, respectively, were introduced through impregnation of 1 g of the HZSM-5 zeolite with 10 ml of ammonium perrhenate (NH4ReO4, > 99% purity, Millipore Sigma) aqueous solution, 0.0005–0.01 gRe/ml. The slurry was stirred at room temperature for 2 h before being transferred to a rotary evaporator to remove water under a vacuum of 150 mbar at 65 °C. The as-prepared samples were dried at 70 °C under vacuum overnight followed by calcination (solid-state ion-exchange) under 100 ml/min 20% O2/Ar at 500 °C for 10 h. The actual concentration of Re after activation is lower than the nominal loading. According to ICP-MS, the actual concentration of Re are 24.2, 51.6, 82.7, 186.4, and 328.7 μmol/g, respectively.
The Zn, Co, In, Ga, and Cu supported HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 30) catalysts were prepared through incipient wetness impregnation. In a typical synthesis procedure, according to the target metal loading (2 wt%), weighted grams of metal nitrate precursor was dissolved in DI water to make a solution (1.5 ml), which was added to 1 g of the HZSM-5 support dropwise. The sample was kept under ambient conditions overnight. The sample was dried at 120 °C for 12 h, and then calcined at 560 °C for 6 h in a tube furnace at a ramp of 5 °C/min under 100 ml/min dry air.
All of the aforementioned powder samples were pressed into pellets and sieved to obtain a 20–45 mesh particle size for characterization and catalytic performance tests.
2.2. Catalytic performance evaluation
The catalytic testing of both ethane and ethylene ADeH was performed in a home-built flow reactor system. Typically, 0.1 g of the catalyst was diluted with 0.5 g of silica sand (cleaned with HNO3 and calcined at 600 °C for 5 h) and activated at 650 °C (ramp 10 °C/min) for 30 min (in 10% H2/Ar for ethane ADeH catalysts and pure Ar for ethylene ADeH, both at 30 ml/min). Noteworthily, the Co-Pt based ethane ADeH catalysts were activated under a reducing atmosphere because metal0 alloy clusters are expected to be the critical active species. Whereas the Lewis acid metalδ+ or metal oxo cations are hypothesized to be essential for the ethylene ADeH, consequently, the catalysts were activated under an inert atmosphere. After the activation, the reactor was adjusted to the desired temperatures. Meanwhile, the feed (ethane + NH3 or ethylene + NH3) bypass signal and the inert standard (Ar) signal were recorded for mass spectrometer calibration. The ethane and ethylene ADeH reactions were mainly performed at 500 °C except for ethane ADeH on the ultralow Pt loading catalysts. Due to the low activity of the Co-Pt based catalysts (with Pt loading ≤0.05 wt%) at 500 °C, the reactions were performed at 600 °C to compensate for the activity. The partial pressure ratios of Pethane/Pammonia and Pethylene/Pammonia both are 0.5/0.5 atm and the total reactants flowrate is 40 ml/min. The corresponding gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) is 16000 h−1. The reactor effluent was measured by an online Agilent 5973 mass spectrometer (equipped with MS Sensor 2.0 software). Detailed methods for MS quantification can be found in the supporting information or in our previous paper [52], [56].
2.3. Catalyst characterization
The chemical properties of the Pt and Co species in the bimetallic Cox-Pty/HZSM-5 catalysts were characterized by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), involving X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The radial distribution functions are obtained after the Fourier transformation of k2-weight χ function derived from the EXAFS data. The experiments were conducted at the beamline 12-BM and 20-BM in Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. Data were acquired in fluorescence mode using a 13-element germanium detector; the sample was set at a 90-degree angle to the incoming beam and detector. The ex-situ activated Cox-Pty/HZSM-5 powder catalysts (under 10% H2 at 650 °C for 30 min) were pressed to a disk, sealed in Kapton®tape, and attached to the sample stage. The spectra were recorded at the Pt LIII-edge and Co K-edge. The XAS data were normalized and analyzed by Athena software.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Ethane ADeH on Co-Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst
3.1.1. Catalytic results
Our previous study suggested that the monometallic Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst shows high CH4 selectivity at high temperatures and the catalyst is less active when the Pt loading decreased to 0.05 wt% [52]. To tune the catalytic behavior of the benchmark Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst, various second metals, including Co, Zn, Ga, In, Sn, Ce, Rh, Zr, Mn, and Pd, have been employed to tune the metal/acid functionalities of the catalyst. Our preliminary catalytic screening (results not shown) suggested that only Co shows an outstanding promotion effect. Noteworthily, the Co/HZSM-5 is an active catalyst for ethane ammoxidation (can be considered as oxidative ADeH) to ethylene and acetonitrile [27], [50], however, is inactive for ethane ADeH under anaerobic conditions. As shown in Fig. 1, ethane conversion over the Co2/HZSM-5 catalyst is < 1% and produces negligible acetonitrile and ethylene under the investigated conditions. The monometallic Pt0.05/HZSM-5 catalyst, while is active for ethane ADeH, conversion decreased from 15% to < 4% after time-on-stream (TOS) of 1 h (see Fig. 1a). Accordingly, the space-time yield (STY) of acetonitrile (see Fig. 1c) decreased from 300 to < 50 μmol/g/min and the STY of ethylene (see Fig. 1d) decreased from 600 to 200 μmol/g/min. The selectivity of acetonitrile and ethylene (obtained at TOS of 1 h) is 15% and 80%, respectively (Fig. 1b). The fast deactivation of the Pt0.05/HZSM-5 could be originated from the coke deposition, although the presence of NH3 as a co-reactant enhanced the coke-resistibility [52]. The Pt0 clusters in HZSM-5 show high affinity to the paraffinic C-H bond due to the electronic deficiency [10], which is prone to coking under anaerobic reaction conditions.

Fig. 1. Catalytic performance of ethane ADeH on Co-Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst and its monometallic counterparts. The selectivity data were calculated based on the STY at TOS of 1 h. Reactions were performed at 600 °C under atmospheric pressure, Pethane/Pammonia = 1/1, GHSV 16000 h−1. The catalytic performance of the Co2-Pt0.05/HZSM-5 catalyst at 500 °C can be found in Fig. S2.
Quite interestingly, the activity, acetonitrile selectivity, and stability all increased for the bimetallic Co2-Pt0.05/HZSM-5 catalyst. The initial ethane conversion is up to 20%, which although also decreased with TOS, remains above 12% (5 times of the monometallic Pt0.05/HZSM-5) after TOS of 1 h. The selectivity of acetonitrile is 18% and the total nitriles (CH3CN + HCN) selectivity is 30%. In terms of the STY, the bimetallic Co2-Pt0.05/HZSM-5 shows > 400 μmol/g/min STY for acetonitrile, which remains > 165 μmol/g/min after TOS of 1 h. Additionally, the STY of ethylene is up to 700 μmol/g/min over the bimetallic Co2-Pt0.05/HZSM-5, which is only slightly deactivated after TOS of 1 h. Further catalytic activity evaluation can be found in Fig. S1. As shown in Fig. S1(a), the cumulative turnover number of acetonitrile over the Co2-Pt0.05/HZSM-5 is > 13 mmol/gcat in 1 h, which is about 3 folds of that for Pt0.05/HZSM-5. Fig. S1(b)-(d) show the changes of turnover frequency (TOF) vs. TON over the Pt, Co, and H+, respectively. It is seen that over the Co2-Pt0.05/HZSM-5, the TOF remains above 65 molacetonitrile/molPt/min and TON reaches 5260 molacetonitrile/molPt after 1 h. Whereas, the TOF decreases much faster with the TON over the monometallic Pt0.05/HZSM-5 catalyst. The same trend was observed when the TOF and TON were calculated per Co and H+, although the TOF and TON based on the Co and H+ were significantly lower due to the higher concentration of the Co and H+ than that of Pt. Nevertheless, the Pt sites are assumed to be the catalytically active sites for the rate-determining step because the Co2/HZSM-5 is inactive for the ADeH. We suggested that the enhanced activity and stability of the Co2-Pt0.05/HZSM-5 catalyst must be associated with the formation of Pt-Co coordination (vide infra).
The catalytic data discussed above demonstrated that Pt is the key catalytically active species for ethane ADeH, and the presence of Co shows a significant promotion effect on the activity and stability. Further influence of Pt loading (0.01–0.05 wt%) on the catalytic performance is shown in Fig. 2(a-c). As shown in Fig. 2a, ethane conversion decreases with decreasing Pt loading from 0.05 to 0.01 wt%, which again suggests that Pt is the main active site. All three catalysts show similar deactivation behavior after TOS of 30 min, suggesting that the same deactivation mechanism was involved after the catalytic system reached the steady-state. In terms of product selectivity (see Fig. 2b), changing Pt loading from 0.01 to 0.05 wt% only resulted in a slight decrease in HCN selectivity, whereas the selectivity of acetonitrile and ethylene is almost not changed. The STY (see Fig. 2c) of acetonitrile and ethylene both increase linearly with increasing Pt loading from 0.01 to 0.05 wt%. However, the STY of HCN remains constant within the same range of Pt loading, indicating that the formation of HCN and acetonitrile involves different types of catalytically active sites and mechanisms. According to our recent study [56], HCN is formed through ammonia-assisted reforming (C-C cleavage) rather than the ADeH (dehydrogenation/amination) for acetonitrile. Therefore, it is not a surprise that the formation of HCN is different from that of acetonitrile with the change of Pt loading. It might be noted that the 0.005 wt% Pt catalyst is almost inactive for ethane ADeH, which shows the absence of acetonitrile and HCN after TOS of1 h, although the STY of acetonitrile is around 50 μmol/g/min during the early-stage (see Fig. S3).

Fig. 2. Catalytic data of ethane ADeH. (a-c) influence of ultralow loading of Pt (0.005–0.05 wt%) and (d-f) influence of Co loading on ethane conversion, products selectivity, and space-time yield (STY), respectively. The selectivity and STY data were obtained after TOS of 1 h. Reactions were performed at 600 °C for (a-c) and 500 °C for (d-f) under atmospheric pressure, Pethane/Pammonia = 1/1, GHSV 16000 h−1.
The aforementioned catalytic data showed the catalytic behavior of the ultralow loading Pt catalysts, the influence of Co loading on the catalytic performance of Pt0.5/HZSM-5 is shown in Fig. 2(d-f). Different from the catalysts with ultralow Pt loading (< 0.05 wt%), at higher Pt loading, the presence of Co decreased the activity. As shown in Fig. 2d, ethane conversion significantly decreased with increasing Co loading from 2 to 5 wt%. Nonetheless, the activity of Co0.5-Pt0.5/HZSM-5 is similar to the Pt0.5/HZSM-5, and the stability of the catalysts significantly increased at a higher Co loading. Almost no deactivation was observed for the Co5-Pt0.5/HZSM-5 catalyst during the investigated TOS. Additionally, the presence of Co shows a significant influence on product selectivity. As shown in Fig. 2e, the selectivity of acetonitrile increased from 53% to 65% with the presence of 0.5 wt% Co. However, further increases in the Co loading resulted in a decrease in acetonitrile selectivity and an increase in ethylene selectivity. The selectivity of ethylene is up to 75% for the Co5-Pt0.5/HZSM-5 catalyst. In terms of the byproduct CH4 formation, the selectivity decreased from 20% or STY decreased from 220 μmol/g/min (for monometallic Pt0.5/HZSM-5) both to almost 0 (for Co5-Pt0.5/HZSM-5). The STY of different products (see Fig. 2f) suggested that the Cox-Pt0.5/HZSM-5 catalyst favors the formation of acetonitrile at low Co loading, but favors the ethylene formation at higher Co loading. The STY of acetonitrile is > 450 μmol/g/min for the Co0.5-Pt0.5/HZSM-5 catalyst. Noteworthily, the cobalt shows less promotion effect to the Pt0.5/HZSM-5 than the Pt0.05/HZSM-5. We suggested that for the samples with ultralow Pt loading (≤ 0.05 wt%), the majority of the Pt species are forming isolated Pt0-Cox clusters, therefore the catalyst demonstrated a significant promotion effect.
3.1.2. Catalyst metal/acid properties and discussion
According to our previous study [52], acetonitrile formation during ethane ADeH follows the tandem mechanism over both Pt0 and Brønsted acid sites of the catalyst, namely ethane dehydrogenation (on the Pt0 clusters), ethylene amination (on the Brønsted acid sites), and ethylamine dehydrogenation (again on the Pt0 clusters). Such a catalytic mechanism was proposed based on the combined approaches of DFT calculations and transient kinetic analysis [52]. In the bimetallic Cox-Pty/HZSM-5 catalyst, the presence of Co could simultaneously influence the metal and acid functionalities of the catalyst, which could be the reason for the enhanced catalytic performance. The chemical properties of the Pt and Co species in the bimetallic Cox-Pty/HZSM-5 catalyst were characterized by the X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in terms of XANES and EXAFS, at both Pt LIII-edge (see Fig. 3a-b) and Co K-edge (see Fig. 3c-d). According to the Pt LIII-edge XANES spectra (Fig. 3a), the Pt species in the monometallic Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst are confirmed as Pt0 by the similar “white line” intensity to that of Pt foil. However, the “white line” increased for the bimetallic Cox-Pty/HZSM-5 catalyst, indicating the formation of positively charged Pt species. Additionally, the main absorbed peak at 11567 eV for the bimetallic catalyst is slightly broader than the Pt/HZSM-5, which also suggested the different electronic structures. The most intense EXAFS peaks are observed at 2.3–2.4 Å, which was derived from Pt-Pt or Pt-Co coordination [57]. For the Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst, the Pt-O bond at a radial distance of 1.7 Å (typically corresponds to PtO2 or single-atom Ptδ+ Lewis acids) is absent from the EXAFS, but in the bimetallic catalysts, a small portion of Pt-O is identified, which is consistent with the increased “white line”.

Fig. 3. X-ray adsorption spectra at Pt LIII-edge ((a) and (b)) and Co K-edge ((c) and (d)). (a) and (c) XANES spectra; (b) and (d) the magnitude of the Fourier transform EXAFS spectra.
The Co K edge XANES spectra in Fig. 3c show high “white line” intensity at 7725 eV, which suggested that most of the Co species in the bimetallic Cox-Pty/HZSM-5 catalysts are oxidized (Co2+). The small pre-edge peak at around 7710 eV indicates that a small portion of Co species is reduced to Co0 in Co0.5Pt0.5 and Co1Pt0.5. The XANES spectra are almost identical for Co0.5-Pt0.5 and Co1-Pt0.5 catalysts, but the “white line” intensity increased and the pre-edge intensity decreased for the Co5-Pt0.5 sample. We suggested that the relative concentration of the Co0 decreased with increasing Co loading since the X-ray absorption spectra give the average oxidation state. The R space of the EXAFS spectra in Fig. 3d also shows the presence of mainly Co-O coordination at a radial distance of 1.6 Å. The Co-Co bond at a radial distance of 2.1 Å is absent, indicating the absence of Co0 nanoparticles (see also Fig. S4 for TEM images). A small peak at a radial distance of 2.3 Å is observed for Co0.5Pt0.5 and Co1Pt0.5, which could be originated from the Co-Pt coordination as already mentioned in the Pt LIII-edge. We anticipate that the formation of Pt-Co coordination, most likely forming Pt0-Cox alloy nanocluster in the micropore of the HZSM-5 zeolite, to be responsible for the increased selectivity and stability during ethane ADeH. Such Pt/Co hybrid clusters, in contrast to the Pt0 cluster in the monometallic Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst, show lower activity for ethane hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation, therefore decreasing the selectivity of by-products methane and HCN, and enhancing the coke resistibility.
Besides the influence on the Pt0 metal functionality, the presence of Co could also affect significantly the acid functionality. As already indicated from the aforementioned XAS results, the majority of the Co species in the bimetallic Cox-Pty/HZSM-5 catalyst form Co2+ cations (through solid-state ion-exchange during activation). The Co2+ cation in ZSM-5 zeolite is a strong Lewis acid, increasing Co loading will decrease the Brønsted acid concentration (see Fig. S5a for NH3-TPD). According to the propylamine-TPD (see Fig. S5b), the Brønsted acid density in HZSM-5 is 531 μmol/g, which decreased to 381.7, 369.8, and 262.4 μmol/g, respectively, for the 0.5, 1, and 5 wt% Co/HZSM-5. The corresponding Co/H+ ratios are 0.22, 0.46, and 3.23, respectively; and the corresponding H+/Al ratios are 0.36, 0.35, and 0.25, respectively (the H+/Al ratio is 0.51 for HZSM-5). Noteworthily, the H+/Al ratios of the Co-containing catalysts are within the reasonable range as reported by Di Iorio et al. for Cu/HZSM-5 [58], but significantly lower than that of the HZSM-5. More detailed characterizations of the monometallic Cox/HZSM-5 catalysts have been extensively studied by XRD, TEM, XPS, and UV–vis–DRS in our previous paper [50]. The significantly decreased Brønsted acid concentration could be responsible for the decreased acetonitrile selectivity. Specifically, the C-N linkage through amination was significantly inhibited without sufficient Brønsted acid sites. Therefore, the selectivity of acetonitrile decreases but ethylene selectivity increases with increasing Co loading in the bimetallic catalysts.
3.2. Acetonitrile from ethylene and ammonia
3.2.1. Influence of different metals supported on HZSM-5
While acetonitrile can be synthesized directly from ethane and NH3 through the proposed ADeH, there is a trade-off between activity and selectivity. Considering that ethylene is the reaction intermediate during ethane ADeH, acetonitrile formation from ethylene and NH3 was extensively investigated over the various metal-modified HZSM-5 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4(a-b), different metals modified HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 30) catalysts are all active toward acetonitrile formation from ethylene ADeH. The selectivity of different products during ethylene ADeH is shown in Fig. 4a. Unlike the ethane ADeH, where CH4 and HCN are the only by-products (the formation of C3+ was totally absent), significant amounts of C3+ hydrocarbons and aromatics (BTX) were produced. The formation of these higher hydrocarbons was realized through oligomerization on the Brønsted acid site and aromatization on the Lewis acid sites of the metal/HZSM-5 catalyst. It is seen that the pristine HZSM-5 is highly selective for C3+ and BTX (90%) formation under the investigated conditions, suggesting that the Brønsted acid site alone is inefficient for acetonitrile formation due to the absence of metal active sites for dehydrogenation. Based on our previous study [52], the Pt0 metal sites are critical to the dehydrogenation of ethylamine intermediates.

(a-b) influence of different metals in HZSM-5 zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 = 30); (c-d) influence of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio on Re/HZSM-5; and (e-f) influence of Re concentration in HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 80). The reactions were performed over 0.1 g of catalyst at 500 °C under atmospheric pressure with total flow = 40 ml/min and NH3/C2H4 ratio 1/1.
Among the different metals investigated, the Re, Co, and Zn modified HZSM-5 catalysts are selective (60%) for ethylene ADeH to acetonitrile. In particular, the selectivity of C3+ and BTX is only 15% over the Re/HZSM-5 catalyst. However, the In and Cu modified HZSM-5 catalysts are selective to C3+ and BTX hydrocarbons (inefficient for ADeH). Besides the C3+ and BTX, ethane is another main by-product during ethylene ADeH. The selectivity of ethane on the Re/HZSM-5 catalyst is 20% and it is produced from ethylene hydrogenation (with H2) or hydride transfer over the Re sites. In terms of activity, as shown in Fig. 4b, the Re/HZSM-5 catalyst shows 12% ethylene conversion and up to 660 μmol/g/min acetonitrile STY (the mole-specific activity, TOF of acetonitrile is 7.7 min−1, see Fig. S6). The Zn and Co modified HZSM-5, however, only show 6% ethylene conversion and < 350 μmol/g/min acetonitrile STY (TOF around 1 min−1). Therefore, the Re/HZSM-5 is the most efficient among the investigated catalysts.
3.2.2. Re/HZSM-5 catalyst for ethylene ADeH
The influence of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (SAR) of the HZSM-5 host on ethylene ADeH over the Re/HZSM-5 catalyst was then investigated to elucidate the effect of acidity. As shown in Fig. 4c-d, both selectivity and activity are strongly influenced by the SAR. Acetonitrile selectivity is increased from 60% (for SAR 30) to 80% (for SAR 80 and 280). The selectivity of by-products, ethane, C3+, and BTX, decreased significantly with increasing SAR (decreasing the acid density). On the one hand, the formation of C3+ and BTX decreased with increasing SAR due to the decreased acidity. At low SAR (30), ethylene will be protonated by the excess Brønsted acid sites, forming C2H5+ carbocation [59], which will be oligomerized to form higher olefins and aromatics. Although the presence of NH3 as a co-reactant reduced significantly the activity of oligomerization, such a reaction is inevitable due to the high ethylene partial pressure as already identified based on the catalytic performance of HZSM-5. On the other hand, when the SAR is high (280), the C-N bond linkage (on the Brønsted acid sites [52]) through amination will be limited, which could result in low activity. Additionally, the different siting of Brønsted acid sites among different zeolites might affect the structure of Re site [60], [61], which could also influence the catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 4d, ethylene conversion is > 15% and STY of acetonitrile is > 1000 μmol/g/min when the SAR of the zeolite host is 80, but the increase of SAR to 280 or a decrease of SAR to 30 both resulted in a significantly decreased activity.
The influence of Re concentration on the catalytic performance of ethylene ADeH is investigated with optimal HZSM-5 (SAR 80) as the host. As shown in Fig. 4e, the selectivity of acetonitrile increases (the selectivity of C3+ and BTX decreases) with increasing Re concentration from 24.2 to 82.7 μmol/g. However, the acetonitrile selectivity remains at 80% with further increasing Re concentration to 328.7 μmol/g. Whereas, the selectivity of ethane (<10%) and HCN (<5%) remains almost constant within the investigated range of Re concentration. In terms of the catalytic activity, both ethylene conversion and acetonitrile STY increase almost linearly with increasing Re concentration from 24.2 to 82.7 μmol/g, indicating that Re is the critical catalytically active site. The activity is further increased with increasing Re concentration from 82.7 to 328.7 μmol/g at a significantly lower slope, which suggested that besides the Re sites, the Brønsted acid sites could also play a significant role during the ethylene ADeH, considering that increasing Re concentration will result in a decrease of Brønsted acid density. As shown in Fig. S7, the strong acid sites density – demonstrated by the desorption of NH3 at temperatures above 300 °C – decreased with increasing Re concentration. Whereas, the weak acid density (low-temperature NH3 desorption peak) increased with increasing Re concentration. Further characterization of such Re/HZSM-5 (SAR 80) catalysts, by means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in-situ Raman spectroscopy, HAADF-STEM, and H2-TPR, can be found in our recent study [56], where the Re/HZSM-5 catalysts were employed for ammonia reforming of ethane (at 650 °C). The results suggested that the isolated ReOx oxo species (anchored to the framework Alf) were not fully reduced during the reaction despite the high reaction temperature under the reducing atmosphere. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the isolated ReOx oxo in ZSM-5 must be stable under the ethylene ADeH conditions. We suggested that the ReOx is critical for the dehydrogenation of ethylamine intermediate after the C-N linkage on the Brønsted acid sites. Therefore, an appropriate balance between the metal and acid functionalities must be the key to efficient ADeH.
4. Conclusion
We show that acetonitrile can be produced from ethane or ethylene through anaerobic ADeH. In contrast to conventional ammoxidation, the present catalytic system eliminates the formation of CO2 and NOx, and co-produces H2, due to the absence of gaseous O2. During ethane ADeH, we investigated the influence of Co as a promoter on the catalytic performance of the benchmark Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst. We show that the presence of Co enhances the stability and total selectivity of acetonitrile and ethylene. Specifically, when the Pt loading is < 0.05 wt%, the presence of 2 wt% Co enhances simultaneously the activity, selectivity, and stability. However, with such ultralow Pt loading catalysts, the ethane ADeH favors the formation of ethylene rather than acetonitrile (the selectivity of ethylene is >65%). Whereas for the higher Pt loading (0.5 wt%) catalyst, the presence of 0.5 wt% Co increased the selectivity and STY of acetonitrile to 65% and 458 μmol/g/min, respectively, significantly higher than ethane ammoxidation on the Co/HZSM-5 catalyst [50]. Characterization of the Co-Pt/HZSM-5 catalysts by XAS suggested the formation of Pt/Co clusters and Co2+ cation Lewis acid in the zeolite, indicating that the presence of Co influences both metal and acid functionalities. During ethylene ADeH, we show that the Re/HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 80) catalyst is highly efficient for acetonitrile formation. Other metals, such as Zn, Co, In, Ga, and Cu modified HZSM-5 catalyst, while also active for ethylene ADeH, are significantly less selective and/or active than the Re/HZSM-5. The selectivity and STY of acetonitrile are up to 80% and 1300 μmol/g/min, respectively, which are significantly higher than that of ethane ADeH. Based on the results shown in this paper and the characterization data demonstrated in our previous study, we suggested that an appropriate balance between the metal and acid functionalities be critical for both ethane and ethylene ADeH.
