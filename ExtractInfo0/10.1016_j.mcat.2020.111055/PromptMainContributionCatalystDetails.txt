1. Introduction
The selective catalytic conversion of light alkanes to alkenes is of growing interest because of rising demand for more efficient utilization of hydrocarbons feedstocks to produce useful petrochemicals and fuels. Significant attention has been garnered in recent years to propane dehydrogenation, because of the rising demand for propylene. Commercial dehydrogenation of propane processes (PDH) operate at temperatures above 500 °C (823 K). The catalysts used in this process generally are chromium oxide and platinum-based systems while many different materials have been explored. Platinum-based catalysts show excellent activity and good stability. However platinum is expensive and limitedly available. Chromium oxide catalysts are subjected to significant deactivation, because of carbon deposition requiring frequent catalyst regeneration. In addition chromium oxide catalysts because of their toxicity can cause environmental impact. All of these factors encourage searching for alternative systems for PDH.
Among the various materials that are actively investigated for PDH (vanadium oxide, gallium oxide, molybdenum oxide, indium oxide based materials) (for a review see [1]) zinc oxide (ZnO) based materials can be promising candidates, because of zinc low cost and low toxicity. The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics over zinc-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolites received considerable attention [2]. Zinc titanate was reported [3,4] exhibits high selectivity with high specific activity in dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane. Moderate activity and high olefin selectivity was also reported for Zn/Al2O3 [5] and Zn/SiO2 [6,7] catalysts.
In this paper we report novel results on spectroscopic study of the nature of active sites on the surface of zinc-alumina catalysts and their catalytic behavior in propane dehydrogenation reaction. For the characterization of the surface sites we used diffuse reflectance spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide and hydrogen probe molecules. The effect of preparation method on the formation of catalytically active sites and catalytic performance of zinc-alumina catalysts was explored. Zinc-alumina catalysts were prepared by two different methods: conventional incipient wetness impregnation technique and high-temperature zinc vapor deposition (CVD) on alumina subjected to dehydroxylation at different temperatures. It was shown in the literature [8] that unlike conventional methods of zinc introduction (ion exchange, incipient wetness impregnation) high-temperature interaction of zinc vapor with the surface hydroxyls of support favors the formation of Zn2+ surface sites which are active in the catalytic transformations of alkanes [9].
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
PURAL SB aluminum hydroxide (boehmite) from SASOL was used as a starting material for the preparation of the catalysts. The γ-alumina support was obtained by the calcination of this material at 800 K for 2 h. The BET specific surface area of the support measured by nitrogen adsorption was found to be 240 m2/g. Zinc-alumina catalysts were prepared by two different methods: (i) one sample was prepared by a conventional incipient wetness impregnation technique and (ii) two samples were prepared by high-temperature CVD (chemical vapor deposition) of zinc vapor on the alumina support dehydroxylated at two different temperatures: 673 K and 843 K. The BET surfaces of all zinc-alumina catalysts were found to be similar to that of parent alumina. An alumina-supported chromium catalyst was also prepared for comparison purposes as described elsewhere [10].
2.1.1. Incipient wetness impregnation
The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of the alumina with aqueous solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Sigma Aldrich, >99 %). The amount of zinc salt in the solution was chosen to yield samples containing 5 wt. % of zinc. Following the impregnation, the samples were dried first at room temperature overnight and then at 380 K for 12 h and subsequently were calcined in flowing dry air at 773 K for 2 h. Prior to the catalytic test the samples were evacuated at 823 K for 2 h. The catalyst code is Zn-Imp.
2.1.2. High-temperature CVD of zinc vapor
In this case the samples were prepared in a vacuum glass cell (Fig. 1). The cell consisted of three finger-shape parts. At first, the alumina support was dehydroxylated under vacuum of 10−2 Pa for 2 h either at 673 K or 843 K in one part (middle finger) of the cell. Two different dehydroxylation temperatures were chosen to create the support surface with different hydroxyl group coverage. After that the dehydroxylated alumina was transferred to another part (right finger), containing metallic zinc on the bottom, and heated at 723 K. The sample pretreated at 673 K was heated from 673 K to 723 K slowly (3 h ramp). The heating was accompanied by hydrogen evolution which indicated interaction of zinc with surface hydroxyls of the support (the hydrogen evolution was detected by a mass spectrometer attached to the vacuum setup). After the reaction was over (hydrogen evolution was over) the sample was cooled down and transferred to the first part of the cell and heated at 823 K for 1 h to remove metallic zinc traces and destroy Zn+ species [11] (if formed). To transfer the catalysts to the catalytic reactor the cell was filled with dry argon. This catalyst is coded as Zn-CVD1. Another zinc-alumina sample was prepared by zinc CVD on the alumina dehydroxylated at 843 K. The interaction of zinc vapor with alumina was conducted at similar conditions as in the case of Zn-CVD1 sample. The catalyst is coded as Zn-CVD2. Zinc contents in the catalysts are 5.6 and 1.7 wt. % respectively, as determined by AAS spectroscopy (ContrAA 700, Analytik Jena AG). The third part of the cell (side left finger) was equipped with CaF2 window for DRIFT measurements.

2.2. Catalyst characterization
The catalysts surface characterization was performed using diffuse-reflectance infrared (DRIFT) spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) probe molecules. The DRIFT spectra of the samples were measured using a Nicolet Protege 360 spectrophotometer (spectral resolution of 4 cm−1) equipped with a home-made diffuse reflectance unit [12]. Carbon monoxide adsorption was conducted at room temperature while hydrogen adsorption was conducted both at room and liquid nitrogen temperature. Room temperature adsorption of hydrogen was conducted during 48 h at the pressure of 6.7 kPa. In the case of low-temperature adsorption the middle finger of the vacuum glass cell with the samples was immersed in the quartz Dewar flask filled with liquid nitrogen. The low-temperature adsorption of H2 was conducted at the equilibrium pressure of 13.3 kPa
The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) for different catalysts was measured in a programmable temperature system. All the samples were transferred into the TPR cell in a glove box under argon. Before the analysis, each sample (0.2 g) was flushed with a mixture flow of 5% H2 in Ar C for 40 min until the baseline was stubilized. Subsequently, the TPR cell was heated in the mixture from room temperature to 1073 K with a heating rate of 10 K/min. A cold trap (178 K) was set at the downstream of the TPR cell to remove the reduction products. A TCD detector was employed to monitor and record the consumption profiles of H2.
2.3. Catalyst reduction treatment
Taking into account that propane dehydrogenation reaction is accompanied by hydrogen formation it is important to investigate the effect of reduction treatment on the concentration of active sites of zinc-alumina catalysts. For this purpose the catalysts were heated in flowing hydrogen-argon mixture (5 M % H2, inlet flow rate 0.93 L/h at STP) at 823 K for 1 h (temperature ramp of 8 K/min). After the treatment the catalysts were cooled down to room temperature and subsequently were evacuated at 623 K. After that the catalysts were characterized by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide as described above.
2.4. Catalyst evaluation
The propane dehydrogenation reaction was conducted in a U-shape fixed bed quartz reactor (ca. 15 mm i.d., 30 cm long) under atmospheric pressure at the temperature 823 K. The prepared catalysts (1.45 g, particle size 0.25−0.5 mm) were loaded to the reactor under a counterflow of argon. Then, a mixture of propane and N2 (15 M % C3H8, inlet flow rate 0.93 L/h at STP) was admitted into the reactor. The feed gas was purified by passing through moisture (dehydrated alumina) and oxygen (reduced copper-zinc-alumina catalyst) traps. All experiments were conducted in the kinetic region. The part of the reactor upstream of the catalyst bed was filled with quartz chips to preheat the feed in the precatalytic section. Temperature gradient in the catalyst bed both in the radial and longitudinal direction did not exceed 2 deg. The products of PDH were analyzed on line with a gas chromatograph (LKhM-8MD), PORAPAC-Q and 5A molecular sieves columns and a thermal conductivity (TCD) detector. Propane conversion and propene selectivity were measured based on a carbon atom balance principle according to the following equations:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. DRIFT spectroscopy characterization of freshly prepared catalysts
Fig. 2 shows the infrared spectra of carbon monoxide adsorbed on the zinc-alumina (Zn-Imp, Zn-CVD1 and Zn-CVD2) catalyst studied and on the parent alumina (preevacuated at 823 K). The spectra of the catalysts (traces 1–3) are characterized by a band in the region of 2202-2208 cm−1. This band almost matches the position of CO adsorbed on Al3+ Lewis acid sites of the alumina surface (trace 4). However the intensities of the bands due to CO adsorption on the zinc-alumina catalysts are significantly higher which indicates the formation of additional Lewis sites which associated with zinc surface species. The most intense is the spectrum of CO adsorbed on Zn-CVD1 catalyst (trace 1, band at 2204 cm−1). The spectrum of CO adsorbed on Zn-CVD2 (trace 2) is represented by an asymmetric band at higher frequency of 2208 cm−1 with a high-frequency shoulder at 2235 cm−1. The asymmetry toward high frequencies can be explained by the presence of Lewis sites associated with zinc sites which are characterized by the frequencies of adsorbed CO above 2208 cm−1. The shoulder at 2235 cm−1 is similar to that in the spectrum of CO adsorbed on the parent alumina and characterizes Al3+ x-sites [13]. In Zn-CVD2 these sites were formed due to partial dehydroxylation of the alumina at 823 K before zinc deposition. The spectrum of CO adsorbed on Zn-Imp catalyst (trace 3) preevacuated at 823 K is characterized by a band at 2202 cm−1. It should be noted that the intensity of the spectrum of CO adsorbed on the Zn-Imp catalyst is the lowest in comparison with the spectra of other catalysts, despite the fact that the zinc content in this sample is similar to that for Zn-CVD1. This indicates that the concentration of zinc sites capable of adsorbing CO in Zn-Imp is the lowest. It is interesting to note also that in the spectrum of CO adsorbed on Zn-Imp catalyst evacuated at 823 K no bands due to CO adsorption on Al3+ x-sites are observed. This indicates that the Zn2+ sites in this catalyst are formed upon the interaction of supported ZnO, in particular, with those hydroxyls whose removal in the starting alumina results in the formation Al3+ Lewis sites. Thus the CO adsorption sites which are characterized by the absorption bands in the range of 2002−2010 cm−1 in the IR spectra of zinc-alumina catalysts certainly can be associated with surface Zn2+ cations [14,15]. Somewhat different position of the adsorbed CO bands is because of different strength of Zn2+ Lewis sites [16]. In Zn-CVD samples these sites are formed as the result of substitution of the protons of surface hydroxyl groups by zinc cations (Equation 3 and Scheme 1):

This equation is similar to that previously discussed for zinc CVD on HZSM-5 [8]. The substitution of the protons of surface OH groups is clearly demonstrated by Fig. 3. It is seen that the intensity of the bands of the surface hydroxyl groups in the IR spectrum of the alumina support dramatically decreased after high-temperature interaction with zinc vapor.

It is well-established in the literature that zinc-alumina catalysts prepared impregnation technique contains oxygenated zinc species such as ZnO particles and zinc-alumina spinel [17,18]. In the case of Zn-Imp catalyst the surface Zn2+ sites can form as the result of the interaction of zinc oxide particles with the protons of surface alumina hydroxyls (Equation 4):
(4)
2[Al−OH+] + ZnO → [Al-O]2Zn2+ + H2O
This equation is similar to that previously discussed for ZnO/HZSM-5 catalysts [8]. It is well known that according to thermodynamics the interaction of mineral acids with zinc oxide is less favored than with zero-valent zinc [19]. Therefore it is reasonable to expect that the reactivity of zinc vapor toward surface hydroxyls of alumina is higher than that of zinc oxide. This explains why the concentration of Zn2+ surface cations bonded to alumina surface in Zn-CVD catalysts is high than in Zn-Imp sample. In addition, zinc oxide is less mobile than zero-valent zinc because it is not volatile even at high temperatures. In Zn-Imp catalyst heated in vacuum at 823 K only a part of zinc introduced forms Zn2+ surface sites while the rest remains in the form of ZnO particles or zinc-alumina spinel [17,18]. It should be noted that somewhat different positions of the absorption bands in the spectra of CO adsorbed on different catalysts indicates that the Zn2+ surface sites are heterogeneous and possess somewhat different Lewis acidity strength due to their different local environment in conformity with the environment of the surface hydroxyls [20] which they replaced. It is worth noting here also that all hydroxyl groups on the surface of alumina independently of their IR characteristics (OH vibration frequencies) interact with zinc, which means that all surface hydroxyls of alumina possess acidity.
Further, we also have characterized the prepared zinc-alumina catalysts by hydrogen probe molecules.It has beenfound that Zn2+ surface cationic sites are active in hydrogen dissociation at ambient temperature, which results in the formation of surface zinc hydride species (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2. Formation of surface zinc hydride species as a result of hydrogen dissociation on the surface zinc cations.
The dissociative adsorption turned out to be activated and occurs slowly. Therefore we conducted it by exposure of the samples to hydrogen for 48 h. Fig. 4 shows infrared spectra of hydrogen adsorbed on all the zinc-alumina catalysts (traces 1–3) and on the parent alumina (trace 4) at ambient temperature in Zn-H vibration region [8]. One can see that the spectra of H2 adsorbed on different catalysts are characterized by significantly different bandshapes and band positions. The Zn-H band in the spectrum of H2 adsorbed on Zn-CVD1 catalyst (trace 1) is peaking at 1840 cm−1 with a strong tailing to low frequencies. The band is very broad which indicates that the Zn2+ sites are very heterogeneous in their properties and form Zn-H hydrides with different Zn-H bond strength. The strong low-frequency tailing can be additionally explained by the dynamic interaction of the Zn-H dipoles [21]. The Zn-H band in the spectrum of H2 adsorbed on Zn-CVD2 catalyst (trace 2) at 1890 cm−1 is narrower compared to that in the spectrum of Zn-CVD1. The band is also tailing to low frequencies. The comparison of Zn-H spectra of Zn-CVD1 and Zn-CVD2 catalysts allows us to conclude that Zn2+ sites on the surface of Zn-CVD2 catalysts form Zn-H hydride species predominantly with stronger Zn-H bonds. The Zn-H band in the spectrum of H2 adsorbed on Zn-Imp catalysts is represented by a very broad absorption band the intensity of which is significantly lower than those in the spectra of Zn-CVD. It has been found that zinc hydride species which are characterized by higher Zn-H vibration frequencies possess higher thermal stability. The most stable Zn-H hydrides which are characterized by the band at 1890 cm−1 can be destroyed in vacuum at the temperatures above 550 K.

Next, Fig. 5 shows infrared spectra of hydrogen adsorbed at liquid nitrogen temperature on Zn-CVD-1 (trace a) and Zn-CVD2 catalysts (trace b) together with the spectrum of H2 adsorbed on the parent alumina preevacuated at 673 K (trace c). The latter is represented by a band at 4105 cm−1 due to H2 adsorbed on the surface hydroxyls. The absorption bands in the region of 3900−4100 cm−1 are due to H2 adsorbed on Zn2+ surface cations. It is interesting to compare the spectra of H2 adsorbed in the molecular form on Zn-CVD1 and Zn-CVD2 catalysts. It is seen from Fig. 5 that in the spectrum H2 adsorbed on Zn-CVD2 catalyst the most intense band is shifted to lower frequencies by 10 cm−1 relative to that in the spectrum on H2 adsorbed on Zn-CVD1. In addition, the low-frequency shoulder at 3984 cm−1 in the spectrum of H2 adsorbed on Zn-CVD2 is more pronounced. Thus, the comparison of the spectra of H2 adsorbed in molecular form on Zn-CVD catalysts with the spectra of Zn-H hydrides (Fig. 4) leads to a conclusion that the Zn2+ Lewis sites which stronger perturb adsorbed molecular hydrogen (relative to gaseous hydrogen vibration frequency of 4163 cm−1) form stronger (more stable) Zn-H hydrides. In other words, stronger Zn2+ Lewis sites form more stable Zn-H hydride species. It is reasonable to suggest that different Zn2+ sites form zinc-alkyl (zinc-propyl) species [9] with different zinc-alkyl bond strength upon dissociation of alkyls on Zn2+ sites. This means that the energetics of the propane dehydrogenation reaction can be somewhat different on different Zn2+ sites.

Dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on the surface of zinc oxide is well-known from the literature [22,23]. In addition, dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on Zn2+ isolated exchange cations in high-silica ZSM-5 zeolites was previously reported by some of us [8,24,25] (and later reproduced by Kuroda’s group [26]). The ability of Zn2+ cations in ZSM-5 zeolite to dissociate hydrogen molecules was associated with their specific local environment geometry (since Zn2+ cations in faujasites are not able to dissociate hydrogen). The specific location of Zn2+ exchanged cations in ZSM-5 provides strong perturbation of H2 molecules vibration [8] (low frequency shift of more than 200 cm−1 relative to HH vibration frequency of free hydrogen molecules of 4163 cm−1) and their strong adsorption. In the current study however we see that Zn2+ cations on the surface of zinc-alumina catalysts perturb H2 molecules not as strong as Zn2+ in Zn-ZSM-5 while adsorb hydrogen dissociatively. This fact makes us to suppose that in spite of the Zn2+ local environment geometry is very important, chemical interaction of Zn2+ cations with support can also affect the properties the surface cations and therefore should be taken into account.
3.2. TPR
Fig. 6 shows TPR profiles of zinc-alumina catalysts. The profiles of Zn-CVD catalysts are complex and their interpretation can be ambiguous. In general, the low- and intermediate-temperature negative peaks in the TPR profiles can be associated with destruction of two types of zinc hydrides (low- and high-temperature hydrides). The negative peak below 370 K can be due to hydrogen evolution as a result of destruction of low-temperature zinc hydride species formed at room temperature during the baseline stabilization period. The positive peak in the range of 350-500 K can be due to hydrogen adsorption as a result of the formation of high-temperature zinc hydride species. Negative peaks in the temperature range of 500−750 K can be due hydrogen evolution as a result of destruction of high-temperature zinc hydrides. A high-temperature positive peak above 750 K (hydrogen adsorption) should be related to the reduction of surface Zn2+ cations. During the high-temperature reduction formation of zero valent zinc along with recovery of surface hydroxyls occurs. Upon further temperature rise a strong negative peak appears due to hydrogen evolution. This peak can be explained by a suggestion that the reduction of the surface Zn2+ cations is reversible and at temperatures above 750 K interaction of zero-valent zinc with surface hydroxyls and restoration of a part of Zn2+ sites is thermodynamically more favorable than reduction.

Fig. 6. TPR profiles of the zinc-alumina catalysts.
Unlike Zn-CVD catalysts the reduction peak in the TPR profile of Zn-Imp catalyst is very weak which indicates that the reduction of oxygenated zinc species is minor. The TPR measurements thus indicate high reducibility of the Zn2+ surface cations. It has been found that zinc content in Zn-CVD1 and Zn-CVD2 after the TPR was 3.1 and 1.0 % respectively which is nearly two times lower than in the freshly prepared catalysts (5.6 and 1.7 % respectively). This means that significant part of Zn2+ species in Zn-CVD catalysts was reduced to zero-valent zinc and left the catalysts at high temperatures due to zinc volatility [19]. In contrast, zinc content in Zn-Imp sample after the TPR turned out to be nearly the same as in the freshly prepared catalyst (4.7 vs 5.0 % respectively). Low reducibility of Zn-Imp catalyst is in a good agreement with the literature [5]. Furthermore, if the reduction of Zn2+ species is reversible then it is obvious that the equilibrium concentration of Zn2+ cationic sites depends on the temperature of reaction and hydrogen concentration.
3.3. DRIFT characterization of reduced catalysts
The results of DRIFT spectroscopy study of carbon monoxide adsorption on the reduced zinc-alumina catalysts are represented in Fig. 7. As reported in the experimental section, prior to CO adsorption the reduced catalysts were evacuated at 623 K. This evacuation temperature was chosen to be high enough to destroy zinc hydrides and low enough to avoid restoration of Zn2+ sites due to high-temperature interaction of the reduced zinc with surface hydroxyl under vacuum conditions. It can be seen from comparison of Fig. 2, Fig. 6 that concentration of Zn2+ sites in Zn-CVD catalysts significantly decreases after 1 h of reduction in 5% H2/Ar mixture. This result is in agreement with the TPR results. Taking into account that the initial concentration of Zn2+ sites in Zn-CVD1 catalyst more three times as high as in Zn-CVD2 one can conclude that a part of Zn2+ cations in Zn-CVD1 possess lower stability under reduction conditions than those in Zn-CVD2. The concentration of active Zn2+ sites in Zn-Imp catalyst did not decrease significantly. In this sample the equilibrium concentration of Zn2+ site can be determined both by the disappearance of the existing Zn2+ sites due to their reduction and formation of new ones due to interaction of ZnO particles with the support surface.

The intensities of the absorption bands in the spectra of the freshly prepared and reduced catalysts can be used for evaluation of the concentration Zn2+ sites. In this case, it is necessary to take into account the contribution of CO adsorbed on Al3 + cations which present in significant amount in Zn-CVD2 as discussed above. This can be done by subtraction of the spectrum of CO adsorbed on alumina with an appropriate weight factor from the spectrum of CO, adsorbed on Zn CVD2.
3.4. Catalytic behavior in propane dehydrogenation
Fig. 8 illustrates the results of catalytic tests: propane conversion and propylene selectivity as a function of time on stream for all the catalysts studied. In addition Table 1 represents initial and steady state values (measured in 10 min and in 4 h after the beginning of a catalytic run) of propane conversion, propylene selectivity and propylene steady state specific activities for the catalysts studied. The latter were calculated based both on the initial zinc content and Zn2+ concentration in the samples subjected to reduction treatment at the temperature of the reaction as discussed in the previous section. It is seen that the catalysts prepared by zinc CVD exhibit very high initial activity in propane conversion. The main products of propane conversion at the beginning of the catalytic run, however, are methane, ethylene and hydrogen. Methane and ethylene can be formed, according to the literature, mainly due to due to propane cracking/hydrogenolysis reactions [[27], [28], [29], [30], [31]]. So, nearly 100 % of propane is converted over Zn-CVD1 catalyst into cracking products at the very beginning of the catalytic run. The most significant changes in the performance of the catalysts occurred during the first hour on stream. The overall propane conversion over the catalysts prepared by zinc CVD dropped to less than half while propylene selectivity increased strongly. The performance of all the catalysts almost stabilized in three hours on stream. One can see that propane conversion over all zinc catalysts reached similar values. The very high initial activity of zinc-alumina catalysts prepared by zinc CVD compared to that prepared by the traditional incipient wetness impregnation technique can be explained by high initial concentration of active Zn2+ sites (as it follows from the spectra of adsorbed CO (Fig.2) and Zn-H hydrides (Fig.4)). The low propane selectivity and high undesired cracking reaction at the beginning of the catalytic run on Zn-CVD catalysts can be explained by close location of active zinc sites. Similar suggestion that paired closely located active sites are needed for the cracking reaction was made in the literature for zeolite-based hydrocarbon cracking catalysts [32]. The quick decrease of the propane conversion activity of Zn-CVD catalysts compared to Zn-Imp can be explained by quick partial reduction of Zn2+ sites in accordance with the TPR results and IR characterization of the reduced catalysts. The fact that Zn-CVD1 and Zn-CVD2 catalysts reach similar propane conversion values can be explained by the fact that the concentration of Zn2+ sites reaches similar equilibrium value in all the catalysts. This suggestion is in agreement with the results discussed in the previous section. The specific activities of zinc-alumina catalysts calculated based on the initial zinc loadings and based on the assessments of Zn2+ concentration in the reduced samples obtained using the IR spectra of CO adsorbed on the fresh and reduced samples are shown in Table 1. The activities calculated based on Zn2+ content in the reduced catalysts should be considered as more correct. Somewhat high specific activity and selectivity of Zn-CVD2 catalyst can be explained in general by different zinc-alumina bond strength and different environment of Zn2+ sites in this catalyst as discussed above.

b
The catalytic activity of the alumina support is negligible (order of value lower) compared to that of the catalysts studied.
Thus the catalytic results are in general agreement with the conclusions made based on the results obtained by DRIFT spectroscopic study. Namely, the high initial activity of Zn-CVD catalysts is due to the high concentration of active Zn2+ surface sites. These Zn2+ surface sites are heterogeneous most probably because of their different local environment configuration. The spectroscopic manifestation of different local environment configuration of Zn2+ sites and different zinc-alumina bond strength is different position of the absorption bands and different bandshapes in the spectra of adsorbed CO, H2 and Zn-H species. The catalytic manifestation of the heterogeneity of Zn2+ sites is their somewhat different catalytic behavior in propane dehydrogenation.
Finally, it is also worth noting that catalytic activity of zinc catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is even higher than that of chromium-alumina catalyst which is widely employed industrial catalytic material.
4. Conclusion
In summary, in this work we have studied alumina supported zinc catalysts prepared by different methods: conventional wetness impregnation technique and high-temperature interaction of zinc vapor with alumina surface. The catalysts were characterized by DRIFT spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide and hydrogen probe molecules, TPR measurements and tested in propane dehydrogenation. The catalysts prepared by high-temperature interaction of zinc vapor with alumina are characterized by high initial concentration of surface Zn2+ cations bonded to alumina surface and exhibit very high initial activity in propane conversion. The Zn2+ sites on the surface of alumina are also capable of adsorbing molecular hydrogen dissociatively with the formation of surface zinc hydride species. The Zn2+ cations on the surface have been found to be heterogeneous. The spectroscopic manifestation of the heterogeneity of Zn2+ sites are different bandshapes and band positions in the spectra of adsorbed CO and H2 and Zn-H hydride surface species. The catalytic manifestation of the heterogeneity of Zn2+ sites is their somewhat different activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. The Zn2+ cations bonded to alumina surface are more easily reducible in hydrogen at high temperatures than supported zinc oxide particles.
The results obtained in this work can be used in the development of new efficient promising dehydrogenation catalysts. Namely, one can suggest that for better propylene selectivity the distance between active sites should be optimized. Optimal interaction strength between active sites and support material as well as local environment of the sites also can significantly affect catalytic performance of supported dehydrogenation catalysts.

2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
