Strong NiOx and ZrO2 interactions to eliminate the inhibiting effect of trace oxygen for propane dehydrogenation by accelerating lattice oxygen releasing
Recently, the ZrO2-based catalysts for PDH exhibited high activity owing to the formation of oxygen vacancy and coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcu) sites. However, industrial C3H8 raw gases typically contain trace amounts of oxygen at 10–1000 ppm, which can significantly decrease the PDH activity of nano-sized ZrO2 catalyst, because that oxygen vacancy can be filled by the O2 molecules rapidly, while the rate of lattice oxygen consumption is relatively slow. Here, highly dispersed NiOx species loading on ZrO2 significantly increased C3H6 formation rate (up to 6.6 times) and decreased the activation energy. The strong interaction between NiOx species and ZrO2 enhances the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen, and increases the concentration of oxygen vacancy and unsaturated Zr-O acid-base pairs for PDH. This strategy can expand to other metal oxides interacted with ZrO2 to eliminate the inhibiting effect of trace oxygen, such as GaOx, CoOx, CrOx, LaOx, and InOx.
1. Introduction
Propylene is the basis chemical product for the synthesis of polymers, paints, dyes, rubber, solvents and other chemicals [1]. It mainly comes from the by-product of steam cracking of naphtha and catalytic cracking technology of wax oil and residue, which cannot meet the growing needs [2]. Thus, it is necessary to develop the direct dehydrogenation technology of propane form abundant shale gas and natural gas, which has the advantages of high selectivity of propylene, simple product and easy separation [3], [4]. Commercially applied catalysts are materials with supported Pt or CrOx active species. They, however, suffer from high costs or toxicity of the active components. The focus of the ongoing research in both academia and industry is the development of alternative materials free of such limitations.
Remarkably, the traditional catalyst supports, such as ZrO2 [5], [6], TiO2 [7], [8], Al2O3 [9], [10], [11], WO3 [12], Eu2O3, and Gd2O3 [13] oxide are found to exhibit high dehydrogenation activity themselves recently. Through reduction pretreatment or in situ nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction, the elimination of lattice oxygen from a crystal plane results in oxygen vacancy. Nearby coordinatively unsaturated M-O Lewis acid pairs become active sites for alkane DH and reduces the energy barrier for alkane C-H rupture. Especially, the nano-sized ZrO2 shows industrially relevant activity in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Most of the oxygen vacancies structures are stable only under the absolutely non-oxidative PDH reaction condition, which is high temperature and reducing atmosphere.
However, industrial C3H8 or N2 raw gases typically contain trace amounts of oxygen at 10–1000 ppm (complete oxygen elimination increases cost). Whether trace oxygen will affect the dehydrogenation activity of hard-reducing ZrO2 catalyst has not been studied yet. We found that a trace O2 in industrial-like C3H8/N2 feed gas can significantly decrease the PDH activity of nano-sized ZrO2 catalyst because of oxygen vacancy filling. How to broaden the application conditions of ZrO2-based catalyst is worthy for further study.
Regulating the redox property of lattice oxygen of ZrO2 is the key to stabilize the structure of oxygen vacancy under this oxygen-lean PDH condition. Doping rare earth element (Y, La or Sm) into and supporting metal (Cu, Ru or Rh) on the ZrO2 are typical strategy to promote more oxygen vacancy formation under non-oxidative PDH reaction condition [5], [6], [14], [15]. The interaction between Highly dispersed Ni species and ZrO2 promoted interfacial lattice oxygen releasing and oxygen vacancy formation, which is widely applicated in CO2 hydrogenation, even trace O2 cofeed [16], [17].
Inspired by the above research, we prepared highly dispersed NiOx supported on nano-sized zirconia materials using a simple incipient wetness impregnation method, which are used as catalysts to eliminate the inhibiting effect of trace oxygen for PDH by accelerating lattice oxygen releasing. Compared with bare ZrO2, the NiOx loading on ZrO2 significantly increased the C3H6 formation rate (up to 6.6 times) and decreased the activation energy. The trace oxygen can also inhibit the Ni metal particles formation, those typically exhibit high deep dehydrogenation and cracking activity. Experimental and theoretical calculation results indicate that the strong interaction between NiOx species and ZrO2 enhances the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen, and increases the concentration of oxygen vacancy and unsaturated Zr-O acid-base pairs for PDH. This strategy can expand to other metal oxides interacted with ZrO2 to eliminate the inhibiting effect of trace oxygen, such as GaOx, CoOx, CrOx, LaOx, and InOx.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The nano-sized ZrO2 catalysts were prepared by hydrothermal method according to Ref. [6]. 12.748 g of ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O (99%, Aldrich) were dissolved in 30 mL of H2O. Separately, 21.622 g of urea were dissolved in 30 mL of H2O. The two resulting solutions were mixed together to obtain 0.6 mol·L−1 Zr4+. The solution was then transferred into a Teflon lined stainless-steel autoclave. Crystallization was made at 180 °C under autogenous pressure for 24 h. Hereafter, the precipitate was washed thoroughly with deionized water and dried at 100 °C overnight. The obtained powder was calcined at 600 °C for 4 h. The resulting catalysts were denoted as bare nano-sized ZrO2. The incorporated 3Ni-ZrO2 catalyst was synthesized through the same method expect addition of Ni(NO3)2·6 H2O (99%, Aldrich) into the Zr4+ solution (NiO:ZrO2 =3:100, mass ratio).
Nano-sized ZrO2 suppNorted NiO catalysts (xNi/ZrO2) were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method using Ni(NO3)2·6 H2O as Ni source. The preparation method was described as follows: a certain amount of Ni(NO3)2·6 H2O was dissolved in deionized water (0.75 mL) and then the resulting aqueous solution was dropped to nano-sized ZrO2 (1.5 g). While the mixture was stirred with glass rod vigorously. The amount of Ni(NO3)2·6 H2O was varied in order to achieve different NiO to ZrO2 mass ratios ranging from 1% to 10%. Impregnated samples were treated under ultrasound at room temperature for 30 min and vacuuming under a vacuum of − 0.09 Mpa at 50 °C for 6 h in order to promote the dispersion of active components. Then, the as-prepared products were dried at 100 °C overnight and calcined at 600 °C for 4 h in air. The obtained samples were labeled as xNi/ZrO2, x denotes NiO content (NiO:ZrO2 =x:100, mass ratio). 3Ga/ZrO2, 3Cr/ZrO2, 3La/ZrO2, 3Co/ZrO2, and 3In/ZrO2 catalysts were synthesized through the similar method.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were recorded on a Panalytical Empyrean power diffraction system using Cu Kα radiation over the 2θ range of 5–80. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on the Jeol JEM-2011 microscope and FEI Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope at the accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were recorded on a USA Thermo Scientific ESCALAB250Xi spectrometer using Al Ka (hv = 1486.6 eV, 15 kV, 150 W) X-Ray source. The binding energies were calibrated using the C 1 s peak of contaminant carbon (BE = 284.6 eV) as an internal standard. The ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS) measurements were conducted on a Hitachi UH4150 spectrophotometer equipped with an accessory of integration sphere diffuse reflectance. The powder samples were loaded in a transparent quartz cell after drying treatment and measured in the range of 200–800 nm. Barium sulfate was acted as a reference in the tests. For the H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments, the samples (50 mg) were pretreated at 300 °C for 10 min and then cooled to room temperature in a He flow. The temperature was raised at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in the range of 80−850 °C under H2-reduction condition (10 vol% H2 in Ar, 30 mL min−1). Raman spectra were undertaken on a LabRAM HR Evolution Raman spectrometer (HORIBA) with a 532 nm laser excitation. For the in-situ/operando Raman spectra, the samples were mounted in an in-situ cell at desired temperatures and gas flows. The in-situ Raman spectra were obtained under 10% H2/N2 gas flows at 200–600 °C after 0.5 h. The operando Raman spectra were obtained under 5 vol% C3H8/N2 feed containing 100 ppm O2 at 200–600 °C after 0.5 h.
In this work, all spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [18], [19]. The electron exchange-correlation effect were described by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE) [20]. The projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotential was utilized to describe the core-valence electron interaction [21]. The plane-wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 400 eV was used. For all the geometric optimization, the conjugate gradient algorithm was used in ionic optimization and the convergence threshold was set to 10−4 eV in electronic relaxation and 0.02 eV/Å in Hellmann-Feynman force on each atom. Considering long-range van der Waals (vdW) interactions, the DFT-D3 method with Becke-Jonson damping [22], [23] was used. The vacuum gap thickness along the z axis was set to be 15 Å, which was enough to avoid the interactions among periodic images. Gaussian smearing method was adopted with the width of the smearing of 0.05 eV. The 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst-pack k-point mesh was implied for the Brillouin zone integration [24].
Adsorption energy were calculated using the following expression:
(1)
Ead=Etot–Eslab- Egas
Where Etot is the total energy of the catalysts, Eslab is the energy of slab and Egas is the energy of the gas. According to this definition, exothermic adsorption results in a negative value.
2.3. Catalyst tests
All catalytic tests were performed at 1 bar in a continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz tubular reactor between 500 ℃ and 600 ℃. To determine the effect of a trace O2 in C3H8/N2 feed gas on the PDH catalytic activity, the rate of propene formation (r(C3H6)) was tested at a degree of propane conversion below 10% using a 40 vol% C3H8/N2 feed containing 1000 ppm O2. The amount of the catalyst and the total flow of reaction mixture were set to 0.1 g and 20 mL·min−1, respectively. The catalysts were firstly heated in N2 flow up to 600 ℃ followed by calcination in air flow for 1 h. Then they were purged with N2 for 10 min, treated with H2 flow (50 vol% H2 in N2) for 1 h and flushed in N2 for 10 min. Finally, a flow of C3H8-N2 mixture (40 vol% C3H8 in N2) was passed through the catalyst bed. The initial r(C3H6) and balanced r(C3H6) was measured at 5 and 20 min on stream, respectively.
To investigate the evolution of surface structure and the product distribution under the oxygen-lean PDH reaction condition, we performed catalytic tests at 550 ℃ using low concentration C3H8 feed (5 vol% C3H8 in N2) containing 1000 ppm O2. Catalyst amount (0.8–1.5 g) and total flow (6–80 mL·min−1) were varied to get different contact times and accordingly different degrees of propane conversion.
An apparent activation energy of PDH was determined in the temperature range between 550 and 600 ℃ over the catalysts pre-reduced at 600 ℃ in a flow of H2 (50 vol% H2 in N2) for 1 h. Catalyst amount used in these tests was varied from 0.1 to 0.4 g depending on the sample, and the total feed flow was 10–20 mL·min−1.
The components of the feed gas and the reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Beijing Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument (Group) Co.,Ltd. SP-3420) equipped with HP-PLOT/Q (for CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and C3H8) and TDX-1 (for CO and CO2) columns with flame ionization detector, CO and CO2 were converted into CH4 by hydrogenation in a nickel reformer and then detected by a hydrogen flame ionization detector. The propane conversion (CC3H8), selectivity of dehydrogenation products (Si), yield of dehydrogenation products (Yi) were determined from (1), (2), (3), respectively.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of ZrO2 and xNi/ZrO2 catalyst
XRD analysis indicated that ZrO2 and xNi/ZrO2 are mainly composed of monoclinic phase (Fig. 1). With Ni content increasing, the intensity of XRD peak at around 30° corresponding to tetragonal zirconia enhanced, indicating that Ni species promote the transformation of monoclinic phase to tetragonal zirconia after high temperature calcination [25]. No characteristic XRD peak of NiO was detected. TEM image revealed a representative 3Ni/ZrO2 nanoparticles with ∼15 nm diameter (Fig. 2a). All atomic plane distances are in agreement with the lattice spacing along the different direction of monoclinic ZrO2. Nano-sized NiO crystal nanoparticles were not observed. EDS elemental mapping images for Zr, O, and Ni revealed a uniform distribution of these elements in xNi/ZrO2 (Fig. 2b). These suggested that the NiOx species are highly dispersed.

As shown in Fig. 3, the UV–vis DRS absorption peak at around 224 nm corresponds to the charge transfer O2-→Zr4+ of ZrO2 [26]. The absorption at 256–317 nm is typically attributed to band gap absorption of NiO [27]. Intensity of these absorption peaks increased with the Ni loading, especially for the absorption peak at 317 nm, suggesting the formation of polymeric NiOx species with weaker interaction with ZrO2 [28]. The bands at around 415–440 nm indicate the presence of octahedral Ni species in the form of NiO [29]. It shifts to low wave length with Ni loading. Thus, for the NiOx species on Nix/ZrO2 catalysts, the absorption peak at 440 nm and relative lower peak in 317 nm compared with the peak at 256 nm, those are different from that of the bulk NiO, should be ascribed to the highly dispersed NiOx species with strong interaction with ZrO2.

Fig. 4 shows the visible Raman spectra of bare ZrO2 and xNi/ZrO2 catalyst. The Raman bands located at 178, 189, 219, 307, 334, 382, 615 and 635 cm−1, and the band at 476 cm−1 were stronger than that at ∼623 cm−1, those are the features of m-ZrO2. The Raman band at around 147 cm−1 due to t-ZrO2 are also observed [30], [31], [32]. This Raman band intensity of ZrO2 is relative lower than that of m-ZrO2, indicating the m-ZrO2 are dominant. It is consistent to the result of XRD characterization. Interestingly, all the Raman peaks intensity decreased with Ni loading, suggesting the strong interaction between NiO and surface ZrO2 or Ni doping.

To investigate the effect of Ni loading on the reducibility of xNi/ZrO2 catalysts, the H2-TPR profiles of NiO/ZrO2 catalysts were shown in Fig. 5. The two reduction peaks centered at 304 and 492 °C are attributed to the reduction of NiO species with weak and strong interactions with the ZrO2 support [33]. The former shifted to lower temperature and H2 consumption increased with the Ni loading, suggesting the presence of more polymeric NiO species. The latter shifted to higher temperature and H2 consumption increased with the Ni loading, which should be ascribed to the formation of Ni–O–Zr bond with stronger metal-support interaction[34], [35]. The reduction peak of 3Ni-ZrO2 catalyst is at 417 °C, which is not match the supported xNi/ZrO2 catalysts. No reduction peaks around 304 °C and 492 °C were observed, suggesting no surface polymeric NiOx species formation and Ni species doping into ZrO2 crystal.

3.2. The relationship between structure and activity
For the eco-friendly and cost-efficient bulk inert metal oxide, such as Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2, their surface defect sites from lattice oxygen consumption exhibited PDH activity under absolutely non-oxidative reaction condition. In fact, industrial C3H8 or N2 raw gases typically contain trace amounts of oxygen at 10–1000 ppm (complete oxygen removal is expensive). To emphasize the effect of a trace O2 in C3H8/N2 feed gas on the PDH catalytic activity over the above bulk metal oxide catalysts, especially for the ZrO2, we determined the initial r(C3H6) of H2-reduced bare ZrO2 catalyst at 550 ºC under industrially relevant conditions with or without O2 cofeed. Its initial r(C3H6) can reach 0.15 mmol·g−1·min−1 under non-oxidative PDH reaction condition. However, under the oxygen-lean PDH condition, the r(C3H6) of this H2-reduced ZrO2 catalyst is only 0.05 mmol·g−1min−1 (Fig. 6a). It is because that ZrO2 is the typical non-reducing oxide, a trace amount of oxygen in the reaction gas can dissociate and fill into the oxygen vacancy rapidly, while lattice oxygen consumption rate by C3H8 or its derivatives is too low to keep the coordinatively unsaturated Zr-O acid-base pairs for PDH. Thus, regulating the redox property of lattice oxygen of ZrO2 is the key to balance lattice consumption and replenishment under this oxygen-lean PDH condition.

Balanced C3H6 formation rate (a) and C3H6 selectivity (b) of reduced xNi/ZrO2 catalysts (Black hollow circle) with different Ni loading, 3Ni/SiO2 (Red square), and the Ni incorporated 3Ni-ZrO2 (Blue triangle) under the oxygen-lean PDH condition (550 ℃, 0.1 g catalyst, 20 mL/min total flow, 40 vol% C3H8/N2 feed containing 1000 ppm O2). Initial C3H6 formation rate (a) and C3H6 selectivity (b) of bare ZrO2 catalyst under non-oxidative PDH condition (550 ℃, 0.1 g catalyst, 20 mL/min total flow, 40 vol% C3H8/N2).
Here, the different contents of NiO supported on ZrO2 by simple incipient wetness impregnation method were used as catalysts for oxygen-lean PDH. To generate oxygen vacancies, xNi/ZrO2 catalysts were reduced by H2 at 600 ºC for 1 h. According to the H2-TPR results, the supported NiO species were reduced. These further demonstrated by the results of XPS characterization in Fig. 7. The Ni 2p3/2 peaks of fresh 3Ni/ZrO2 catalyst at 855.5 and 861.1 eV are assigned to Ni2+ species. A metallic nickel peak of H2-reduced 3Ni/ZrO2 are observed at binding energy of 852.6 eV [36], [37]. For these H2-reduced xNi/ZrO2 catalysts with different Ni loading amounts, a short induction period is observed (only at 5 min, the first detection point), in which their CH4 selectivity increased from 2.4% to 99.6% with Ni loading (Fig. S2). In general, Ni metal particles exhibit high deep dehydrogenation and cracking activity [38], [39]. Thus, for the xNi/ZrO2 catalysts with more Ni species content, the more surface NiO are reduced to metal Ni responding to the formation of CH4. After the 20 min on stream (the second detection point), their balance C3H6 selectivity of xNi/ZrO2 catalysts increased to ∼95% (Fig. 6b), demonstrating that the reduced Ni species are re-oxidized to NiOx species. The Ni0 in spent 3Ni/ZrO2 catalyst are not observed, also suggesting that its surface Ni species maintain oxidation state under oxygen-lean PDH reaction condition (Fig. 7).

For the xNi/ZrO2 catalysts after this short induction period, which are denote as balanced catalysts, their volcanic-type dependence of r(C3H6) on Ni loading are shown in Fig. 6a. Ni loading significantly increases r(C3H6) of xNi/ZrO2 catalyst, 3Ni/ZrO2 exhibits highest r(C3H6) value, which is 6.6 time than that of bare ZrO2 catalyst. Obtained apparent activation energy (Ea) values and the corresponding Arrhenius plots for ZrO2 and xNi/ZrO2 with different Ni loading were shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. S3, respectively. The Ea value of bare ZrO2 was 256 kJ·mol−1. However, the Ea values of xNi/ZrO2 were all around 80 kJ·mol−1, indicating that Ni loading significantly decreases Ea of C3H6 formation. These may be attributed to two reasons. (1) NiOx species are the PDH active sites. (2) NiOx species promote the formation of oxygen vacancy and Zrcu of ZrO2 as the PDH active sites.

It is worth mentioning that 3Ni/SiO2 catalysts showed very low activity in comparison with their ZrO2-based counterparts (Fig. 6a), suggesting that NiOx species is not the main active site in the oxygen-lean PDH reaction over the xNi/ZrO2 catalysts. The similarity of apparent Ea values among the xNi/ZrO2 catalysts with different Ni contents also suggests that their active sites do not depend on the degree of polymerization of Ni species (Fig. 8). Furthermore, the TOF of propene formation with respect to one surface Ni atom decreases with Ni loading (Fig. S4). If this NiOx species determined the activity, the TOF values would not depend on the NiO loading content, especially for the low concentration NiOx species in high dispersion [15], [40], [41]. Furthermore, the Ni incorporated ZrO2 catalyst (3Ni-ZrO2) through in situ synthesis method exhibited low r(C3H6) value under oxygen-lean PDH condition, which is similar to that of H2-reduced ZrO2 catalyst (Fig. 6a). It suggests that Ni incorporating into ZrO2 lattice is not beneficial to maintenance oxygen vacancy under oxygen-lean PDH condition.
Thus, we suggest that the strong interaction of surface NiOx species and ZrO2 enhance the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen and increase the concentration of oxygen vacancy and unsaturated Zr-O acid-base pairs for PDH. The rate of oxygen vacancy filling by the trace oxygen is comparable to the rate of lattice oxygen releasing, this dynamic balance kept the relative stable concentration of oxygen vacancy and Zrcu for PDH.
In order to further certify the suggestion, zirconia structure evolution of the bare ZrO2 and 3Ni/ZrO2 catalysts under different condition are investigated by in situ Raman spectroscopic characterization. For the 3Ni/ZrO2 catalyst under oxygen-lean PDH reaction condition, its operando Raman spectra at different temperatures is similar to in situ Raman spectra in 10%H2/N2 atmosphere, partial Raman bands corresponding to m-ZrO2 shifted to a lower frequency and their intensities decreased with temperature increasing. Especially, above 500 ºC, the Raman bands at 182, 307, 382, 476, 615, and 635 cm−1 disappeared (Fig. 9a-b). These may attribute to the lattice disorder of ZrO2 because of oxygen vacancy formation under the condition of reducible atmosphere and high temperature. However, 3Ni/ZrO2 catalyst in 20%O2 atmosphere above 500 ºC only exhibited that the m-ZrO2 Raman peaks shift and intensities decrease slightly (Fig. S5). Furthermore, for 3Ni/ZrO2 catalyst in 40% C3H8/N2 atmosphere with 1000 ppm O2 at 550 ºC within 1 h, most Raman bands corresponding to m-ZrO2 rapidly disappeared, no Raman bands at 1332 and 1570 cm−1 corresponding to coke were observed [7], those expect the above phenomenon is not because that the 3Ni/ZrO2 catalyst were covered by coke (Fig. 9c-d).

As shown in Fig. S6, in situ Raman spectra of bare ZrO2 catalyst only exhibit a red shift of partial Raman bands, especially in the H2 atmosphere at high temperature. Interestingly, there is not a change of Raman bands of ZrO2 catalyst in 40% C3H8/N2 atmosphere with 1000 ppm O2 at 550 ºC within 1 h. These are significantly different from that of 3Ni/ZrO2 catalyst. These further demonstrated that the strong interaction between NiOx and ZrO2 enhance the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen under oxygen-lean PDH reaction condition.
To further verify the effect of supported NiOx species on oxygen vacancy formation of ZrO2 at atom level, DFT calculations were performed. According to the XRD and Raman characterization, monoclinic ZrO2 are the dominant crystal phase and its (
) is the most stable surface plane [42], [43], [44]. It was used as the basis for computing stoichiometric (s-ZrO2 (
)), there are five-coordinated (Zr5c) and six-coordinated (Zr6c) Zr cations as well as two-coordinated (O2c) and three-coordinated (O3c) anions on the surface (Fig. 10). Charge density difference of NiO clusters and ZrO2 (
) surface was added in Fig. S7. The result shows that an obvious electron transfer between NiO clusters and ZrO2 (
) surface and demonstrate the strong interaction. Projected partial density of states (PDOS) for d-ZrO2(
) and Ni- d-ZrO2(
) were calculated and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. S8. After supporting NiO cluster, the 3d state shows a decrease in localization, indicating that there is a strong orbital interaction between Zr and Ni atoms. These results showed that NiO affects the electronic structure of Zr active sites.

To create Zrcu cations, we built oxygen-defective surfaces with an O2c defect (d-ZrO2 (
)). Forming an O2c vacancy generates two Zrcu cations in Fig. 10a. Its oxygen vacancy formation energy is 5.72 eV. Representatively, a small NiO cluster with 3 Ni atoms and 3 O atoms was constructed on the surface (Ni3O3-s-ZrO2(
)) in Fig. 10b. The two lattice oxygen consumption energies of NiO cluster are 3.39 eV and 2.97 eV, respectively, indicating that NiO clusters are easier to be reduced than ZrO2. It is consistent to the result of H2-TPR. For the O2c lattice oxygen of ZrO2 nearby the partial reduced NiOx, its O2c vacancy formation energy is 4.41 eV, which is lower than that of s-ZrO2 (
). It demonstrates that the strong interaction between NiOx and ZrO2 are beneficial for the formation of oxygen vacancy on ZrO2 surface.
According to previous research [6], the formation of hydrogen from adsorbed hydrogen atoms on ZrO2 surface with oxygen vacancies is the rate-limiting step of propane dehydrogenation. It needs endothermic 1.87 eV energy on d-ZrO2 (
) (Fig. S9). On Ni-d-ZrO2(
), formation of hydrogen needs 1.67 eV, which is lower than that on d-ZrO2 (
). These results suggest that Ni-d-ZrO2(
) are more active than d-ZrO2 (
) for PDH reaction. As shown in Fig. S10, the adsorption energy of C3H8 on d-ZrO2 (
) and Ni-d-ZrO2(
) are − 0.58 eV and − 0.50 eV, which reveals C3H8 can adsorb on these surfaces with moderate adsorption energy. The desorption energy of C3H6 on d-ZrO2 (
) and Ni-d-ZrO2(
) are 0.73 eV and 0.63 eV, which shows that propylene is easier to desorb on the Ni-d-ZrO2(
) surface to form final products.
To investigate the evolution of catalysts’ surface structure and catalytic performance under oxygen-lean PDH reaction condition, the low concentration C3H8/N2 (5 vol%) gas with 1000 ppm O2 at 550 °C are used to prolong the initial induction period of catalysts. As shown in Fig. S11, C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity of ZrO2 were about 10% and 80%, respectively, and increased slightly within 150 min. However, for the fresh 1Ni/ZrO2 catalysts, its initial COx selectivity is 55% at 5 min. Then C3H8 conversion increased from 8% to 15% and the C3H6 selectivity increased from 18% to 91% at 20 min. These indicate that the lattice oxygen is reduced by C3H8 and its derivative to generate more oxygen vacancies to enhance PDH reactivity. Especially for the xNi/ZrO2 (x = 3–10), their initial 100% C3H8 conversion and ∼90% C1 +C2 selectivity illustrated that the surface NiO are rapidly reduced to Ni metal species, which exhibit high deep dehydrogenation and cracking activity. Remarkably, with reaction time, their C3H8 conversion and C1 +C2 selectivity decreased, meanwhile C3H6 selectivity increased to ∼90%. These suggest that the reduced Ni species are re-oxidized to NiOx species by the trace oxygen molecular while oxygen vacancies and Zrcu of ZrO2 are still maintain for PDH reaction. It is worth noting that the time of transformation from cracking reaction to dehydrogenation reaction delayed with Ni loading, suggesting that more nano NiO are reduced to form more metal Ni nanoparticles through rapidly exothermic reaction, then the more metal Ni nanoparticles need more oxygen gas for partial oxidation. After C3H6 selectivity reaches the highest point, the slow decrease of propane conversion with the increase of time may because of two aspects: One is coke formation; the other is that the equilibrium between lattice oxygen consumption and oxygen vacancy filling shifts resulting in decreasing the number of PDH active sites.
To verify the above suggesting, we add the 10% H2 into the 40 vol% C3H8/N2 feed containing 1000 ppm O2. Under such H2 co-feed oxygen-lean PDH condition (Fig. 11), 3Ni/ZrO2 exhibit higher C3H6 formation rate and its deactivation rate constant (kd=0.05) is lower compared with that under the oxygen-lean PDH reaction condition (kd=0.33). These indicate that the additional H2 reducing gas is conducive to the formation of oxygen vacancies, the reduction of oxygen vacancy concentration is one of the reasons for deactivation.

Finally, we also synthesized other metal oxides supported nano-ZrO2 catalysts. Fig. S12 exhibited the HR-TEM, HAADF-STEM and elemental mapping images of 3Cr/ZrO2, 3La/ZrO2, 3Co/ZrO2, 3Ga/ZrO2, and 3In/ZrO2 catalysts. All atomic plane distances are in agreement with the lattice spacing along the different direction of monoclinic ZrO2. Nano-sized CrOx, La2O3, CoOx, GaOx, and InOx crystal nanoparticles were not observed. EDS elemental mapping images for Cr, La, Co, Ga, and In revealed a uniform distribution of these elements in 3 M/ZrO2. These suggested that the supported CrOx, La2O3, CoOx, GaOx, and InOx species are highly dispersed. Like NiO, the other metal oxides interacted with ZrO2, such as GaOx, CoOx, CrOx, LaOx, and InOx, are also beneficial for lattice oxygen consumption to generate oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated metal cations under oxygen-lean PDH condition, which eliminates the inhibiting effect of trace oxygen (Fig. 12).

4. Conclusions
We found that a trace O2 in C3H8/N2 feed gas can significantly decrease the PDH activity of nano-sized ZrO2 catalyst because of oxygen vacancy filling. Highly dispersed NiO loading on ZrO2 significantly increased the C3H6 formation rate of the catalyst (up to 6.6 times) and decreased the activation energy under the oxygen-lean PDH condition. A list of catalytic experiment results demonstrated that surface NiOx or Ni species are not the active sites of PDH. In situ/operando Raman characterization and DFT calculation results suggest that the interaction of surface NiOx species and ZrO2 enhances the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen and increase the concentration of oxygen vacancy and unsaturated Zr-O acid-base pairs for PDH. The rate of oxygen vacancy filling by the trace oxygen is comparable to the rate of lattice oxygen releasing, this dynamic balance kept the relative stable concentration of oxygen vacancy and Zrcu for PDH, especially H2 addition. The trace oxygen can also inhibit the Ni metal particles formation, those typically exhibit high deep dehydrogenation and cracking activity. This strategy can expand to other metal oxides interacted with ZrO2 to eliminate the inhibiting effect of trace oxygen, such as GaOx, CoOx, CrOx, LaOx, and InOx.
