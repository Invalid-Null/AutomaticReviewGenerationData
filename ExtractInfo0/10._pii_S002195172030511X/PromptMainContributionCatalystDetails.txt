Abstract
The gap between supply and demand of propylene has become more and more evident, because of a large consumption of the downstream products derived from propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process. Herein, we discover that the Sn-Beta zeolite with Lewis acid sites can activate the C-H bond, and exhibits high catalytic performance in the PDH. XRD, STEM, and XPS characterizations confirm that Sn species are incorporated into the zeolite framework, and H2-TPR suggests that there is a strong interaction between Sn species and zeolite framework. It is found that the Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brønsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brønsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%. Most importantly, these Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that both Sn and adjacent O atom or OH group cooperatively act as the active sites. The PDH occurs through the direct reaction mechanism in which hydrogen molecule is produced by the direct coupling of H atom of primary C3H7 motif with the Brønsted proton in closed sites or the proton of water in open sites. It seems that open sites are more reactive than the closed ones, and the intrinsic enthalpy barriers are calculated to be 242 ~ 301 kJ/mol depending on the hydroxylation extents. These efficient Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of PDH catalysts with a high stability for the production of propylene.

1. Introduction
The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene [1]. The gap between supply and demand becomes increasingly wide, which has greatly promoted the development of new technologies for the production of propylene [2], [3]. So far, the Olefin metathesis, methanol-to-olefins, and propane dehydrogenation emerge as the typical on-purpose technologies for the production of propylene [4], [5], [6], [7]. Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas [8], [9]. Furthermore, high selectivity to propylene can be achieved with the valuable H2 as the by-product in the propane dehydrogenation process.
In fact, the catalytic propane dehydrogenation process has been commercialized with the Catofin (Lummus) and Oleflex (UOP) technologies, which are based on CrO3/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively [3], [10]. The main drawback of Pt-based catalyst is its high cost and a rapid deactivation arising from the sintering of Pt particles. To re-disperse Pt species, this catalyst always requires a frequent regeneration by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds [11], [12], [13]. The concern about the toxicity of CrO3/Al2O3 to public health largely limits its practical application. According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, exposure to Cr(VI) may bring about several diseases [14]. In such a case, much effort has been dedicated to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for the production of propylene from propane dehydrogenation [15], [16], [17].
Recently, the propane dehydrogenation over single-site catalysts has received considerable interest, and the well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. Loading metal species onto metal oxide, such as SiO2 and Al2O3, is a common way for the fabrication of single-site catalysts, and the obtained isolated metal oxide species deliver high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [27]. A high selectivity to propylene above 95% can be achieved in the silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst for propane dehydrogenation reaction, and in-situ characterization studies reveal that single-site Zn(II) ions located in the strained three-membered siloxane rings on the amorphous silica surface are the active site for propane dehydrogenation reaction [22], [25]. The single-site Co2+ on SiO2 with a tetrahedral coordination also exhibits high selectivity > 95% at 550 °C with stable activity over 24  h for propane dehydrogenation. Calculations with hybrid density functional theory suggests a non-redox mechanism for activation of C-H and H-H bonds by Co2+ similar to the pathway of single-site Zn2+/SiO2 [27]. The mononuclear alumina-supported single-site Ga sites show much higher activity in propane dehydrogenation than their dinuclear silica-supported counterparts, and the propane dehydrogenation reaction requires the presence of Al-O-Ga bonds to promote heterolytic C-H bond activation [23], [24].
The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst [26], [28], and the isolated metal species in zeolite display enhanced stability due to the strong anchoring effect of the framework structure. The iron-silicate zeolites show high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction, and a redox catalytic cycle occurring over the isolated or single-site Fe framework sites in Fe-zeolites for the formation of propane radical cations is suggested to the reaction mechanism in propane dehydrogenation [28]. The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization [30], [31]. As a matter of fact, the Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report [32]. Nevertheless, the Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component [32], [33], [34]. Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
Sn-Beta zeolites were synthesized via a well-established two-step post-synthesis procedure, which is composed of the dealumination of parent H-Beta and then incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated Si-Beta through an impregnation process [35], [36]. In a typical synthesis, commercial Beta zeolite with a nominal nSi/nAl ratio of 13.5 was stirred in a 13 mol L-1 nitric acid aqueous solution (20 ml g zeolite-1) at 100 °C overnight to obtain a dealuminated Beta (Si-Beta). The powder was filtered, washed thoroughly with deionized water, and dried at 180 °C overnight. 1.0 g of the solid powder was impregnated with SnCl2 solution with the nSn/nSi ratios of 1/15, 1/30, and 1/60, respectively. The solid mixture was transferred into a furnace, and the resulting sample was heated to 600 °C in the flow of air using a heating rate of 5 °C/min and then held at 600 °C for 4 h. The obtained products were labeled as Sn-Beta-15, Sn-Beta-30, and Sn-Beta-60, and the number in the name indicates the nominal Si/Sn ratios. The Sn-Beta were converted to Na-Sn-Beta by ion-exchange with 1 M NaCl solution at room temperature for 48 h. After ion-exchange the samples were washed with distilled water to remove chloride ions, dried at 100 °C, and calcined in the air at 600 °C to obtain Na form zeolite. For comparison, SnO2/Al-Beta samples (nSn/nSi ratios of 1/15, 1/30, and 1/60) were synthesized by direct impregnation of Al-Beta with SnCl2 solution.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were recorded on a Rigaku D/max-2550 PC diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å,40 kV,40 mA) from 5° to 50° with a scan speed of 2θ = 8.0°/min.
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of catalyst were acquired on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer, and the spectra were collected in a wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1. The spectra were recorded in dry air against KBr as background.
Nitrogen sorption was measured at −196 °C using a Micromeritics@ ASAP2420 instrument. Prior to the measurement, the samples were degassed in a vacuum for 2 h at 300 °C The surface area was calculated by the BET method, and the average pore size was determined by the BJH method.
The chemical compositions of samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) on a Thermo IRIS Intrepid II XSP atomic emission spectrometer.
The catalyst samples were dispersed on a Cu mesh with carbon microgrid for TEM/STEM characterization. TEM and STEM observations were made by aberration-corrected TEM/STEM (FEI Titan3 G2 60–300). The accelerating voltage used was 300 kV. Elemental mapping and line scan analyses were conducted in HAADF-STEM mode with drift correction applied. The noise due to the scanning electron probe in STEM images is reduced by simply smoothing out the pixels using the image analysis software Digital Micrograph.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were done with a PHI Quantum 2000 XPS System with a monochromatic Al KR source and a charge neutralizer; all the binding energies were referenced to the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV of the surface adventitious carbon.
The experiments of temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR) were performed using a Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 chemisorption analyzer. The sample was treated in He at 400 °C for 1 h and cooled down to room temperature in flowing He. Afterward, the sample was heated in 8% H2/He to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1.
Py-IR characterization methods were performed using a VERTEX 70v FTIR spectrometer. The catalyst samples were pressed into self-supporting disks. The sample cell was evacuated at 400 °C for 2 h; the background spectrum was measured after the sample cell was cooled down to room temperature. Pyridine vapor was introduced into the sample cell for 0.5 h at room temperature. FTIR spectra were taken after the sample cell was evacuated at elevated temperatures. The amounts of the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites were calculated from the following method: CBrønsted sites = 1.88IA(B)R2/W; CLewis sites = 1.42IA(L)R2/W. C = concentration (mmol/g catalyst); IA(B, L) = integrated absorbance of B or L band (cm−1); R = radius of catalyst disk (cm); W = weight of disk (mg) [37].
2.3. Catalytic reaction
The evaluation of the catalytic performance of Sn-Beta for propane dehydrogenation was conducted at 630 °C and atmospheric pressure. All samples were pelletized, crushed, and sieved to obtain catalyst particles about 200–400 μm. 1 g of catalyst pellet was loaded into a quartz tube fixed-bed reactor with the quartz wool as support. Before the reaction, the sample was pretreated in a flow of N2 at 630 °C for 1 h. A feed mixture of 20 mol % C3H8/80 mol % N2 was introduced into the reactor with a flow rate of 20 ml/minute.
The measurement of activation energy of PDH was carried out from 600 to 650 °C with 0.1 g of Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst and a flow rate of 8 ml/minute (20% propane). The measurement of reaction order of PDH was performed at 630 °C with 0.1 g of Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst and a flow rate of 60 ml/minute, and the propane concentration was varied from 2% to 10% to get different levels of reaction rate.
An online GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to analyze the products in the propane dehydrogenation. The by-products formed in the reaction are CH4, C2H4, and C2H6. The carbon balance in the reaction was evaluated by comparing the number of moles of carbon in the outlet stream to the number of moles of carbon in the feed. The carbon balance in H-Beta is about 90%, and the low carbon balance in this catalyst is due to the formation of a large amount of carbon. The carbon balance in the Sn-Beta samples is above 98%, which is acceptable for the calculation of conversion and selectivity. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated from following equation: propane conversion (%)=([FC3H8]in-[FC3H8]out)/[FC3H8]in; propylene selectivity (%) = [FC3H6]out/([FC3H8]in-[FC3H8]out). The blank test in the absence of catalyst was also performed, and it was found that the propane conversion is below 3% and the products mainly come from cracking reaction. Therefore, the gas phase reaction is negligible in the catalytic reaction system.
2.4. Computational methods and modeling
All periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP 5.3.5) [38]. The Bayesian error estimation functional with vdW correlation (BEEF-vdW) was employed [39]. The electron–ion interaction was described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method [40], [41]. The plane wave basis set kinetic energy cutoff was 400 eV. The sampling of Brillouin zone was only with Gamma point. The dimer method was utilized to locate transition states [42]. A force threshold of 0.02 eV/Å was used for structure optimization of all intermediates and transition states.
The Sn-Beta was modeled by a periodic 64T cell, and the lattice constants (a = 12.63 Å, b = 12.63 Å, c = 26.57 Å) were optimized using 800 eV energy cutoff and 0.01 eV/Å force threshold. One of the Si atom at the T2 site was substituted by Sn atom to produce the closed Lewis acid sites for the reaction, and its adjacent Si atoms were then gradually hydroxylated to model different open sites and silanol nests (see Fig. 1). It has been previously revealed that the Sn atoms locate at T2 sites using hydrothermal synthesis, and the preferred sites of Al in H-Beta are also T2 for Sn substitution using dealumination post-synthesis [43], [44]. All atoms in the cell were allowed to relax with the lattice constants being fixed. The harmonic frequency calculations employed a partial Hessian vibrational analysis (PHVA), including Sn and one adjacent active O atom in closed sites or adjacent OH groups in open sites, and organic species part of involved states. Such harmonic frequencies were used to validate TS structures and zero point energy (ZPE) calculations.

3. Result and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolites
The exploitation of Sn-Beta zeolites by the incorporation of Sn(IV) into the BEA framework structure, has been regarded as a big progress in the development of environmental-friendly solid Lewis acid catalysts for sustainable chemistry [45], [46], [47]. Nevertheless, the application of Sn-Beta zeolite is greatly limited by the difficulties in synthesizing this material, particularly the use of hydrofluoric acid with a long crystallization time [48]. To reduce the crystallization time, seed-assisted growth method was applied to the synthesis of Sn-Beta [49], and however the use of seed will increase the cost of synthesis. In such a case, the indirect synthesis was developed and proven to be a feasible route for the synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolite. The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite [35], [36].
The crystalline Al-Beta zeolite with a nSi/nAl ratio of 13.4 was used as a precursor for the synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolite (Figure S1 and S2). As evidenced by 27Al NMR characterization, most Al atoms are incorporated into the zeolite framework and exist as a tetrahedral coordination structure (Figure S3). The efficiency of the dealumination greatly affects the subsequent Sn atoms incorporation process, so an attempt was made by the treatment of Al-Beta with different concentrations of HNO3 (2.3 M, 7.0 M, and 13.0 M) to remove Al from its structure. ICP analysis on the samples treated with 2.3 M and 7.0 M HNO3 shows that the nSi/nAl ratios still keep at low levels of 16.5 and 40, which indicates that atom in Beta zeolite cannot be effectively removed in the dealumination process. However, when the Al-Beta is treated with 13.0 M HNO3 acid, the nSi/nAl ratio decreases to a high level of 450.3. XRD and N2 adsorption characterizations on the Sn-Beta(13.0 M HNO3) sample indicates that its crystalline structure and pore architecture are well maintained (Figure S1 and S2). Therefore, the treatment of Al-Beta with a high concentration of HNO3 is beneficial to the removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework, and 13.0 M HNO3 was used for the dealumination process.
3.2. Characterization of Sn-Beta zeolites
Sn-Beta zeolites with different Sn/Si ratios obtained from two steps were investigated with XRD characterization, to verify the possible structural changes in the post-synthesis procedures. As shown in Fig. 2, all the samples exhibit characteristic peaks located at 2θ of 7.6 and 22.6°, which correspond to (1 0 1) and (3 0 2) reflections of BEA topology, respectively [50], [51]. Moreover, the diffraction peak relevant to SnO2 is not detectable in all Sn-Beta samples [52], which suggests that no bulk SnO2 phase is formed after the loading of Sn species into Beta zeolite structure. The feature structure of these samples can be further investigated by IR spectra (Figure S4). All the samples display strong peaks at 820–750 cm−1 and 1000–1100 cm−1. The adsorption at 820–750 cm−1 is assigned to the O-T-O (T = Si or Sn) symmetric stretching vibration mode, and characteristic vibration at 1000–1100 cm−1 is ascribed to the five- and six-membered rings of T-O-T in the structure of zeolite Beta [53], [54]. Based on XRD and IR analysis, it can be concluded that the incorporation of Sn species into Beta zeolite structure has no evident effect on its structure.

The nitrogen adsorption isotherms of these samples are shown in Fig. 3, and the calculated surface area and pore volume are summarized in Table 1. Indeed, Sn-Beta, and H-Beta samples exhibit the typical adsorption behavior of microporous material with a classic type I isotherm. A sharp increase in nitrogen uptake at a relatively low pressure is observed in these samples, which can be ascribed to the nitrogen filling within the micropore. Apart from the micropore adsorption at the low pressure, a significant uptake is observable at the P/P0 range above 0.7, which is due to the presence of inter-particle mesopores[55]. Surface area and pore volume estimated from nitrogen adsorption isotherms (Table 1) show that Sn-Beta samples possess high microporous volumes (~0.16 cm3/g) and large surface area (410–490 m2 g−1) as that of parent Beta zeolite, which indicates that the textural properties of Beta zeolite are well preserved in these Sn-Beta samples [36]. An element analysis on these samples was carried out with the ICP technique. After incorporation of Sn, the actual nSn/nSi ratio determined by ICP is close to the desired value, confirming the post-synthesis method is an efficient strategy for the preparation of Sn(IV)-containing Beta zeolites.

The microstructure of the Sn-Beta zeolite can be visually reflected from electronic microscopy characterization. The TEM and STEM characterizations were carried out on a typical Sn-Beta-30 sample, in order to know the morphology and elemental distribution in its structure (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). The TEM images in Fig. 4 show that the shape of Beta zeolite crystal is not well-defined, and particle size ranges from 200 to 400 nm. The TEM under the high magnification indicates that the big particles observed in the low magnification are not a single crystal, which is actually the polycrystal consisting of small nanocrystals around 30–50 nm. The irregular of Beta zeolite in its morphology is ascribed to the coexistence of three polytypes in its crystalline structure with different ratios [56]. It should be noted that no evident particles or clusters relative SnO2 phase is detectable in TEM of Sn-Beta, which indirectly suggests that the Sn species is incorporated into Beta zeolite framework. An energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping in the STEM analysis confirms that Si, O, and Sn elements are homogeneously distributed in the Sn-Beta sample (Fig. 5). Note that there is no evident phase separation among these three elements. It can be therefore inferred that Sn species are uniformly dispersed in Beta zeolite structure, and most probably the Sn species enters into zeolitic framework and exists as isolated or single-site Sn.

TEM characterization was also carried out on a typical SnO2/Al-Beta-30 sample, which is obtained via a direct impregnation of Al-Beta with SnCl2 solution. Figure S5 shows that lots of nano-particles from 5 to 20 nm are observable at the surface of Al-Beta. Further EDS analysis on a representative particle confirms the formation of SnO2 at the surface of Al-Beta (Figure S6). Therefore, it can be concluded that the Sn species cannot be incorporated into the zeolite framework if the Al-Beta zeolite is not treated with acid, and a direct loading of Sn species onto Al-Beta zeolite leads to the formation of bulk SnO2 particles at the surface of Al-Beta zeolite.
Fig. 6 shows the Sn XPS spectra of Sn-Beta with different Sn/Si ratio in the 3d region. The bonding energy at around 488.0 and 496.2 eV can be assigned to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 photoelectrons of tetrahedrally coordinated framework Sn species [35]. The signals at these two positions are observed in all samples, which suggests that the Sn species in these samples were tetrahedrally coordinated into the framework. It is well-known that the presence of octahedrally coordinated Sn species at extra-framework position in the zeolites gives two correlated peaks at 486.0 and 494.4 eV, derived from the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 photoelectrons of octahedral Sn species [57], [58]. This signal is not observable in these Sn-Beta zeolites, which strongly suggests that there is no extra-framework Sn species in the Sn-Beta zeolites. Further DRUV measurement was carried out on these Sn-Beta samples, and the sharp adsorptions around 220 nm strongly indicate that the Sn atoms are incorporated into the zeolite framework (Figure S7).

The incorporation of Sn(IV) species into Beta zeolite structure for the formation of single-site Sn can be further verified from the H2-TPR analysis (Fig. 7). Evidently, the H2-TPR profile of Sn-Beta samples exhibits a broad reduction peak from 500 to 800 °C centered at about 650 °C. The reduction peak is ascribed to the reduction of Sn(IV) species into metallic Sn via a two-step (Sn4+→Sn2+ and Sn2+→Sn) transformation [59]. The H2-TPR measurement was also carried out on the SnO2/Al-Beta samples. The reduction temperatures of Sn species in SnO2/Al-Beta-60, SnO2/Al-Beta-30, and SnO2/Al-Beta-15 are 480, 570, and 580 °C, respectively (Figure S8), which are much lower than those in the Sn-Beta samples[60]. Therefore, it can be concluded that Sn species in the framework of Beta zeolite have a strong interaction with the zeolite structure, because the Sn species in zeolitic lattice becomes less reducible.

The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites [61]. The catalytic performance of Sn-Beta is essentially related to the nature of acidity in its structure, and therefore pyridine was then employed as a probe molecule to acquire detailed information on the amount and strength of different acid sites in Sn-Beta samples. Pyridine as a base probe molecule, can interact with both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites to give characteristic bands in IR spectrum. The band at around 1450 cm−1 is regarded as the Pyridine adsorbed on Lewis acid sites, and the band at around 1540 cm−1 is considered as the Pyridine adsorbed on Brønsted acid sites [62], [63], [64]. Fig. 8 shows that both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites can be observed in all Beta samples, and a quantitative analysis on the acid site density in Sn-Beta with different Sn/Si ratios at 200 and 300 °C is shown in Table 2. A high level of both Brønsted and Lewis acidity is found in the H-Beta sample. However, the Brønsted acid largely decreases (241.4 μmol.g−1 in H-Beta, 36.0 μmol.g−1 in Sn-Beta-30) and the Lewis acid (163.8 in H-Beta, 170.9 μmol.g−1 in Sn-Beta-30) is well kept, when the Sn species is incorporated into Beta zeolite. The Brønsted acid in Sn-Beta can be further reduced to a low level of 15.8 μmol.g−1 in Na-Sn-Beta-30, while the Lewis acid is still maintained at a high level of 170.2 μmol.g−1 in Na-Sn-Beta-30. Therefore, a general trend can be observed that the amount of Lewis acid in H-Beta, Sn-Beta, and Na-Sn-Beta are identical, but the amount of Brønsted acid follows a sequence of H-Beta > Sn-Beta > Na-Sn-Beta. The lowest B/L ratio is achieved in the Na-Sn-Beta samples (0.06 in Na-Sn-Beta-30), which allows them to be a unique solid Lewis catalyst for catalytic application.

3.3. Propane dehydrogenation over Sn-Beta zeolites
The catalytic behaviors of these Beta catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reaction (Fig. 9). The H-Beta zeolite can activate propane and catalytically convert it into propylene, ethylene, ethane, and methane. Nevertheless, the cracking products (selectivity of 52%) occupy the majority and less propylene (selectivity of 48%) is produced. The cracking of propane results in a fast decrease of conversion from 45% to 30% in 3 h. By contrast, Sn-Beta zeolites exhibit improved stability in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The catalytic performances of these Sn-Beta catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation become stable after a certain period, and no evident loss of activity is observable in a long time-on-stream reaction for 72 h. Note that an evident increase of propylene selectivity is observed in Sn-Beta-60 sample, which is due to a decrease of Bronsted acid for cracking reaction. The Sn/Si ratio in the zeolite structure has a great effect on the catalytic performance of these Sn-Beta samples. A small amount of Sn doping (Sn/Si = 1/60) enables Beta zeolite to be a good catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. A propane conversion of 27% and propylene selectivity of 75% can be achieved in the Sn-Beta-60 catalyst. The increase of the Sn/Si ratio to 1/30 leads to an obvious improvement in both conversion and selectivity, and the obtained Sn-Beta-30 delivers the propane conversion of 37% and selectivity of 80%. Further increase of the Sn/Si ratio to 1/15 leads to a decrease of the conversion to 31%, but the selectivity in the Sn-Beta-15 increases to 92%. The efficiency of these three Sn-Beta catalysts can be demonstrated from the propylene yield. The highest propylene yield of 30% can be achieved in the Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, and thus the optimized Si/Sn ratio in Sn-Beta zeolite for the propane dehydrogenation should be around 30.

Fig. 9. Propane conversion and propylene selectivity over H-Beta and Sn-Beta with different Sn/Si ratios at 630 °C.
The spent H-Beta and Sn-Beta were studied with Raman and TG analysis techniques. Two distinct peaks around 1350 cm−1 (D band) and 1580 cm−1 (G band) can be observed in the Raman spectra of the deactivated H-Beta (Figure S9 and S10), which are generally ascribed to the disordered graphitic lattice and ideal graphitic lattice, respectively. By contrast, weak peaks relevant to graphitic structure could be detected in the spent Sn-Beta catalyst, which indicates that a small amount of coke was generated in these catalysts. The amount of coke deposition in these two catalysts can be quantified by the thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (Figure S11). Estimated from the weight loss from 300 to 800 °C, about 25% of coke is generated in the spent H-Beta for propane dehydrogenation reaction. Meanwile, the coke formation in H-Beta zeolite leads to a significant decrease of acid sites, and its Lewis acid and Brønsted acid reduce to 7.8 μmol.g−1 and 2.6 μmol.g−1 at 300 °C, and the loss of acid site leads to a fast deactivation in the reaction. However, only about 2% weight loss is observed above 300 °C in the TG of the spent Sn-Beta-30, which indicates that the coke formation is negligible in this catalyst. Therefore, it can be concluded that Sn-Beta zeolite is a coking resistant catalyst, which allows it to be a promising catalyst for practical applications.
Based on the propane transformation over H-Beta and Sn-Beta zeolites, it is reasonable to propose that the Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brønsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction [65]. A conversion versus selectivity was achieved by changing the space velocity on these Sn-Beta samples (Figure S12-15), and it is found that the propane selectivity almost keeps unchanged with an increase of propane conversion. Therefore, the propane dehydrogenation over these Sn-Beta catalyst takes place via a parallel reaction pathway, which can be depicted in Scheme 1. On the basis of this assumption, it is reasonable that a high L/B ratio is beneficial to attaining a high propylene selectivity. Indeed, the dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate which can be estimated from propylene selectivity (equals to SC3H6/(1- SC3H6)) in these samples can be correlated with L/B ratios measured from IR-Py characterization (Fig. 10). The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is helpful for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

Fig. 10. Dependence of the propane dehydrogenation to craking ratio on the Brønsted acid to Lewis acid ratio.
As revealed in the study above, Sn-Beta-30 possessing the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L acid ratio exhibits the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, and therefore the catalytic activities of these Sn-Beta zeolites can be correlated to the strong Lewis acidity arising from single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework. To further prove this hypothesized structure–activity relationship, the Na-Sn-Beta which was obtained by a simple Na+ exchange with Sn-Beta zeolite, was also evaluated in propane dehydrogenation reaction. In comparison to the parent Sn-Beta zeolite, the amount of Lewis acid in the Na-Sn-Beta is kept almost unchanged but the Brønsted acid is significantly reduced, which leads to a large decrease of B/L ratio. It is quite interesting that the Na-Sn-Beta shows an enhanced catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, especially for Na-Sn-Beta-30 and Na-Sn-Beta-60 samples (Fig. 11). The propane conversion over these Na-Sn-Beta zeolites remains unaltered, but the propylene selectivity is greatly increased to 93% in Na-Sn-Beta-30 and Na-Sn-Beta-60 samples. The propylene production rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid in these Na-Sn-Beta catalysts (Figure S16), and it can be expressed as: rpropylene (μmol.g−1.minute-1) = 1.48*k, k = density of Lewis acid site (μmol.g−1). The studies of Na-Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta in propane dehydrogenation undoubtedly confirmed that the Lewis acid rather than Brønsted acid is the active site for propane dehydrogenation.

Further kinetic studies were performed on the optimized Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst at relatively low propane concentration with the conversion below 10%. The Arrhenius plot of propane dehydrogenation reaction from 600 to 650 °C is shown in Figure S17, and the calculated activation energy equals to 221 kJ/mol which is consistent with the following theoretical calculation. The reaction order in propane is calculated as the slope of lg(propane converting rate) versus lg(C0) plot as shown in Figure S18, and the measured propane reaction order is 1.1.
The formation of Lewis acid in Sn-Beta zeolite is mainly attributed to the incorporation of Sn species into the zeolitic framework to create single-site Sn, and the isolated Sn atoms are responsible for propane dehydrogenation reaction. To verify the crucial role of single-site Sn in propane dehydrogenation, the reference catalysts SnO2/Al-Beta were also studied in propane dehydrogenation. These SnO2/Al-Beta zeolites were prepared by a simple impregnation of Al-Beta with the Sn precursor solution followed by a calcination. DRUV spectra of these samples exhibit a wide adsorption from 200 nm to 300 nm with a shoulder peak at around 270 nm (Figure S19), suggesting the presence of SnO2 domains in these samples [32], [33]. The pyridine IR experiments were carried out on a typical SnO2/Al-Beta with Si/Sn ratio of 30. Results show that it has much less Lewis acid site (23.1 μmol.g−1 at 200 °C and 11.0 μmol.g−1 at 300 °C) than Sn-Beta, but its Bronsted acid density (248.9 μmol.g−1 at 200 °C and 168.2 μmol.g−1 at 300 °C) is close to that of H-Beta zeolite. Therefore, it can be inferred that Sn species are not incorporated into zeolite framework in this sample. These SnO2/Al-Beta zeolites are active in propane dehydrogenation, and the initial propane conversion is about 50% for SnO2/Al-Beta-30 and SnO2/Al-Beta-15 samples (Fig. 12). Nevertheless, a significant loss of activity is observed in these catalysts, which results in a low level of conversion after 72 h. Moreover, these SnO2/Al-Beta zeolites display a lower selectivity to propylene, in comparison to Sn-Beta zeolites with the same Sn/Si ratio. The fast deactivation of SnO2/Al-Beta catalysts in propane dehydrogenation could be ascribed to the sintering of SnO2 particles at the surface of Beta zeolite under the high reaction temperature. There is no strong interaction between SnO2 particles and zeolite framework, because these SnO2 particles are physically dispersed at the surface of Al-Beta zeolite which can not resistant to the thermal treatment at a high temperature of 630 °C. On the contrary, the Sn species are chemically incorporated into the zeolite framework and exist as single-site Sn in the Sn-Beta catalysts. These tetracoordinated Sn single atoms are intensively bonded to the zeolite framework, which enables these Sn atoms to be highly stable under the harsh reaction condition.

3.4. DFT calculation for propane dehydrogenation over Sn-Beta zeolite
The above experimental results have proved that the isolated Sn atoms are located in the framework of Beta zeolite. It was previously proposed that both closed and open sites in zeolites may act as the active center for the reactions [66]. Herein the periodic DFT calculations were performed in Sn-Beta to elucidate the detailed reaction mechanism and catalytic activity for the propane dehydrogenation. Sn is located at T2 site of Beta structure model. Both direct and indirect reaction pathways (see Scheme 2) were first addressed in closed active sites. In both pathways, one of the H atom in propane was first abstracted by O atom adjacent to Lewis Sn Site acting as the Brønsted base, and the remaining C3H7 motif bonds with Sn site. Then in the direct pathway, the second H atom in the C3H7 motif attacks the H atom in the framework to directly produce propylene and H2 molecule. While in the indirect pathway, the C3H7 motif loses one H to bond with Sn atom forming Sn-H moiety and propylene; finally H2 was produced by the coupling of two H atoms respectively at Sn and O sites.

Scheme 2. Proposed reaction mechanism of the alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed by Lewis Sn zeolites through the direct or indirect pathways. R1 and R2 are alkyl groups or H atoms.
The calculated enthalpy diagram of both pathways in closed sites is shown in Fig. 13, and the optimized transition state structures are depicted in Fig. 14. It should be noted that the preferred pathways involve the intermediate of the primary C3H7 group, while those involving the secondary C3H7 group are energetically less favored (see Figure S20 and Table S1). Propane is first adsorbed at the intersection of two twelve-membered channels (M1) with the adsorption enthalpy being 48 kJ/mol at 0 K. An enthalpy barrier of about 251 kJ/mol was calculated for the first dehydrogenation (TS1) to form the primary C3H7 group bonded with the closed Lewis Sn site. At the TS structure, the breaking C-H and forming O-H distances are respectively 1.51 and 1.20 Å, and the forming C-Sn bond distance is 2.46 Å. In the case of the second dehydrogenation step of the direct pathway to produce propylene and H2 (TS2), the enthalpy barrier is 182 kJ/mol. At the TS structure, the C-H bond distance in the C3H7 group is elongated from 1.10 to 1.49 Å and the O-H bond distance in the framework is elongated from 0.98 to 1.53 Å, and the forming H-H distance is 0.84 Å. As the first dehydrogenation step is endothermic by about 118 kJ/mol, the second dehydrogenation step is rate-determining and the overall enthalpy barrier of the direct pathway involving primary C3H7 intermediate is about 300 kJ/mol for propane dehydrogenation at closed Lewis site in Sn-Beta. It should be noted that the overall enthalpy barrier of the direct pathway involving the secondary C3H7 motif is 359 kJ/mol (see Table S1); this is understandable as the terminal CH2 group at the TS exhibits primary carbenium ion feature.

In the case of the indirect dehydrogenation pathway in closed sites, the second dehydrogenation of primary C3H7 group is highly energy demanding, and the enthalpy barrier is 266 kJ/mol. The TS (TS3) involves four-membered ring structure, and the breaking C-H and forming Sn-H distances are respectively 1.74 and 1.91 Å. Regarding the structure of M3 intermediate, Bader charge analysis revealed that the H atom bonded with Sn is hydride with −0.98 e. Finally, the enthalpy barrier for H-H coupling is 116 kJ/mol, and the forming H-H distance is 1.08 Å with the breaking Sn-H and O-H distances are respectively 1.97 and 1.21 Å (TS4). In the indirect pathway involving primary C3H7 moiety, both the first and second dehydrogenation steps are endothermic, and the overall enthalpy barrier is as high as 384 kJ/mol (~445 kJ/mol in the indirect pathway involving secondary C3H7 group). Compared the overall enthalpy barriers in both direct and indirect pathways, we could conclude that the propane dehydrogenation proceeds via the direct pathway through primary C3H7 motif bonded with Sn at closed Lewis Sn-Beta sites.
According to the suggested direct reaction pathway for the propane dehydrogenation, we now in the position to elucidate the catalytic activity of open Sn-Beta sites. Different structures of open sites could be formed depending on the hydroxylation extents. Herein, three open Sn sites with one to three hydroxyl groups, namely, Sn(OH)1, Sn(OH)2, Sn(OH)3, were compared (see Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 13, the adsorption enthalpies of propane in three open Sn-Beta structures are around −48 kJ/mol, similar to that in closed structure as a result of the contribution from non-bond vdW interaction. A monotonous decrease in the first dehydrogenation enthalpy barrier was observed from closed (251 kJ/mol) to open sites (  237 > 220 > 217 kJ/mol). Interestingly, the formed intermediate M2 in open structure is more stable over 40 kJ/mol than that in closed one; this may be attributed to the flexibility of open active sites and the hydrogen bond with adjacent silanol nests. On the contrary, the second dehydrogenation enthalpy barriers in open sites (211 ~ 235 kJ/mol) are higher than that in closed one (182 kJ/mol). The overall enthalpy barriers in three open sites are therefore around 242 ~ 296 kJ/mol depending on the hydroxylation extents, and it seems open Sn(OH)2 sites exhibit the highest activity for propane dehydrogenation in Sn-Beta. As a result, finely tuning the local structure of Lewis Sn sites is essential to improve the dehydrogenation activity.
4. Conclusion
A series of Sn-Beta catalysts with a unique single-site Sn structure are developed for propane dehydrogenation reaction to produce propylene. Full characterizations with XRD, STEM, XPS, H2-TPR, and Py-IR techniques on these catalysts reveal that the Sn species are incorporated into zeolite framework and exist as isolated Sn single atoms. The Lewis acid in Sn-Beta is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brønsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst that possesses the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which gives propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%. Most importantly, Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h. Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents. These efficient Na-Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts for the production of propylene.
