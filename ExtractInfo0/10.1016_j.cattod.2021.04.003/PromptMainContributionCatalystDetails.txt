1. Introduction
Platinum catalysts with mixed oxides, prepared from layered double hydroxides, as support precursor have been the subject of intensive research in recent decades [[1], [2], [3]]. Layered double hydroxides (LDH) are a unique class of inorganic materials. The LDH general formula can be represented as M(II)1-xM(III)x(OH)2[An−]x/n · mH2O, where M – metal and A – anion [4]. LDH consist of the layers built from the cations of metals with different valences, and interlayer space with anions, compensating positive layers charge, and water molecules. It is possible to vary structural, acid-base, textural and adsorption properties of LDH by the changing of the nature of cations in the layers, their ratio, and the nature of the interlayer anions. Besides, anion complexes of the active metals precursors can be introduced into interlayer space. So its uniform distribution in the structure of the support at the atomic level was achieved. This opens up new possibilities for the formation of metal centers.
We have previously studied the anchoring of the platinum complexes on the MgAl-LDH. It was shown that the nature of the interlayer anion has a significant effect on the composition of surface forms of platinum, their localization in the structure of the layered material, and the amount of fixed metal. The [PtCl6]2− complexes are mainly localized in the interlayer space when using MgAl-LDH with OH-interlayer anions. The anchoring of platinum complexes on LDH with carbonate anions in the interlayer space is mainly due to adsorption on the outer surface of the support. The size of the platinum particles formed after the thermal treatment of the systems is different. The platinum size is much smaller (2−3 nm) in the samples obtained on the basis of LDH with carbonate anions in the composition. The Mg/Al ratio in LDH also affects the properties of the forming platinum centers. The density of the positive charge increased and the electrostatic interaction between the layers and interlayer anions enhanced when the proportion of aluminum in the composition of MgAl-LDH grew up. This led to the adsorption of more anionic platinum complexes and their stronger interaction with hydroxide layers. As a result of this process an increase of the platinum dispersion in corresponding catalysts, as well as a rise of their activity in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation, occurred [5].
Bimetallic catalysts, as a rule, are more effective than the monometallic analogs. The introduction of such cations as tin, zinc, and gallium into the composition of platinum catalysts makes it possible to significantly improve their catalytic properties. Most often, the authors associate this with a geometric effect (dilution of platinum active centers and, as a consequence, an increase of their dispersion) or an electronic effect (a change in the electronic state of platinum in the composition of catalysts due to interaction with the second metal).
It was found in previous works that bimetallic PtZn particles formed in the Pt/MgZnAl catalysts. Structure and force of interaction of these particles with the support depends on the Zn content. Platinum particles are reduced and stabilized in the metallic form at a certain zinc content. As a result, this contributes to an increase in the dehydrogenating ability of platinum catalysts [6]. The presence of gallium cations in the composition of LDH also leads to the formation of highly dispersed particles of supported platinum and an improvement in the activity of catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (at a certain Ga/(Ga + Al) ratio) [7]. The introduction of tin into the MgAl-LDH composition also increases the dispersion of the supported platinum. At the same time reduced form of tin or formation of bimetallic PtSn particles was not found [8].
Thus, the introduction of another metal into the composition of platinum catalysts based on LDH opens up new possibilities for controlling the dispersion of platinum and its properties and, as a consequence, increasing the activity of the corresponding catalysts.
Studies of the platinum catalysts based on LDH, in which gold introduced as a second metal, are found only in some literature works for selective aerobic oxidation of polyols [9] or electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction [10]. In this case, the processes occurring during the interaction of the precursor of the active component with the support have not been considered. At the same time there are many articles dedicated to the study of bimetallic Au-Pt systems on other supports. The Au-Pt/Al2O3 catalysts presented high selectivity of the formation of unsaturated compounds in the methylcyclopentane reaction and lower deactivation during reaction process compared with monometallic platinum catalysts [11]. As the authors of the work found out, gold blocks the platinum surface. At the same time, it contributes to the isolation of metal particles from each other and, accordingly, to an increase in dispersion. It is also important to note that a large amount of gold on the platinum surface slowed down the reaction rate. This may indicate that the reaction proceeds at platinum centers, and not at gold ones.
The authors of work [12] also noted the decrease in the size of platinum active centers upon the introduction of gold. During the synthesis of the Au-Pt/SiO2 and TiO2 catalysts, gold appears on the surface of bimetallic PtAu clusters, thereby additionally separating platinum atoms in space. In addition to the geometric effect, the electronic effect at gold addition to platinum catalysts on selected supports was proven by the authors. By ensuring close contact between platinum and gold, a charge transfer from gold to platinum is observed. Both of these effects have a significant impact on the reactivity of the systems. Increased reactivity of Au-Pt/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts in comparison with monometallic platinum systems in the reaction of complete oxidation of toluene was noted in article [13]. The authors explained this by the fact that during the preparation of catalysts, gold deposited in the form of individual nanosized metal particles, which can stimulate the reduction of surface oxygen. This contributes to increase of the catalyst activity, especially at low reaction temperatures.
The possibility of obtaining of the monometallic Au/LDH systems and some bimetallic catalysts based on gold-containing LDH was studied in separate scientific works [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18]]. For example, in [14], the intercalation of gold particles into the interlayer space of ZnAl-LDH was proved using a set of physicochemical methods. Catalysts based on Au/MgAl exhibited the high activity in the one-pot synthesis of flavones [15], in low temperature CO oxidation [16], aerobic oxidation of alcohols [17,18].
Among the bimetallic catalysts based on LDH, containing gold and a second metal, the most information is found about Au-Pd/MgAl-LDH systems. The introduction of palladium into the composition of Au/MgAl-LDH catalysts significantly improves their properties in oxidation reactions of many organic compounds: aerobic oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexanols and cycloxanones to phenols [19], alcohols oxidation in water [20], photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols [21]. The authors of [22] discovered a synergistic effect between Au and Ag in Au-Ag/MgAl-LDH catalysts, which contributed to an increase in their activity in the reaction of the reduction 4-nitrophenol. The anchoring of gold complexes on NiAl-LDH also led to a synergistic effect between gold and nickel [23]. This largely determined the improved properties of the obtained catalysts in the reaction of selective oxidation of alcohols.
As follows from the cited literature data, bimetallic Pt-Au catalysts are the subject of intensive research. The authors of most works agree that in order to improve the properties of platinum centers, it is necessary to ensure close contact between two metals: platinum and gold. The unique structure of LDH allows the introduction of complex metal anions into a limited interlayer space. The simultaneous introduction of anions containing platinum and gold will provide this interaction.
At present work bimetallic catalysts Au-Pt with using MgAl-layered double hydroxides as supports precursors were first obtained and studied. The influence of the Mg/Al ratio in LDH, nature of interlayer anion in LDH (carbonate anion, hydroxide anion) and Au/Pt ratio on the properties of obtained catalysts in propane dehydrogenation was found.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
MgAl-LDH with Mg/Al = 2, 3, and 4 M ratios was obtained by the coprecipitation. For this purpose, the aqueous solution containing magnesium and aluminum nitrates was added dropwise to an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate with vigorous stirring at a constant temperature of 60 °C. Also pH = 10 during the synthesis procedure was maintained by the addition of aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide to the mixture. Thereafter, the suspension was aged at the synthesis temperature and vigorous stirring for 1 h, and then in an oven at 60 °C for 16 h. Then the resulting precipitate was washed with distilled water to neutral pH of the washings, filtered, and dried at 80 °C for 18 h. Obtained LDH contained carbonate-anions into interlayer space and were denoted as MgAl-X−CO3, where X – Mg/Al molar ratio.
The mixed oxides MgAlOx-X (X – Mg/Al) were prepared by MgAl-X−CO3 calcination at 550 °C. LDH with preferential content of hydroxide-anions into interlayer space were obtained after interaction of the mixed oxides with distilled water during 8 h and drying at 100 °C for 12 h. These materials were denoted as MgAl-X−OH, where X – Mg/Al molar ratio.
To obtain an aqueous solution of H[AuCl4], a sample of a gold wire was dissolved in a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids. The resulting solution was evaporated in a water bath to a syrupy state by adding dropwise concentrated HCl and then distilled water. The resulting concentrated solution was cooled, quantitatively transferred into a volumetric flask and made up to the mark with distilled water.
LDH with carbonate-anions MgAl-X−CO3 and LDH with hydroxide-anions MgAl-X−OH in interlayer space, as well as oxide form of LDH (MgAlOx-X) (X – Mg/Al) were used as supports for the adsorption of chloride complexes of platinum and gold. Anchorage was provided from an excess of an aqueous solution of metal complexes for 1 h at room temperature and vigorous stirring. The support with the fixed metal complex was washed with distilled water on a filter and then left to dry for 24 h at room temperature. For the synthesis of bimetallic systems containing both Pt and Au, a solution was preliminarily prepared by mixing individual solutions of H2[PtCl6] and H[AuCl4] in the amount necessary to ensure the specified content of each of the metals in the finished catalyst.
The concentration of metals (Mg, Al, Pt, Au) in solid samples (after dissolution) was estimated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy on a Varian 710-ES system.
2.2. Study of the systems by physicochemical methods
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data for the MgAl-LDH and LDH with adsorbed metals complexes were obtained with using D8 Advance (Bruker) X-ray diffractometer (CuKα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å) by scanning with step of 0.05° and accumulation time of 5 s/step at 2θ diffraction angles between 5 and 80°. Phase composition determination was made with using ICDD PDF-2 database. Calculation of the unit cell parameters was performed according to the formulae: с = 3d003 and а = 2d110.
The electronic diffuse-reflectance spectra (DRES) of the supported gold complexes were measured on a UV-2501PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) with an ISR-240A attachment in a range of 11000–54000 cm–1. BaSO4 was used as a reference sample. The experimental spectra were represented in the Kubelka– Munk function–wavenumber coordinates.
Samples of the catalysts, preliminary oxidized and reduced at 550 °C, were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM images were obtained on a JEM-2100 (JEOL Ltd.) electron microscope. Local Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis was made оn Inca-Xact (Oxford Instruments) analyzer. The samples were prepared by depositing the ethanol suspension of the powdered samples on a copper grid that was covered with a thin perforated carbon ﬁlm.
Platinum dispersion in the reduced samples was estimated by pulse chemisorption of CO probe molecules at room temperature assuming the stoichiometry of [Pt] : [CO] = 1:1.
2.3. Catalytic testing
Dehydrogenation of propane was carried out in a ﬂow-type reactor with a stationary catalyst bed (0.5 g loading) at a temperature of 550 °C, atmospheric pressure, molar ratio H2/C3H8 = 0.25, and weight hourly space velocity of 8 g/(gcath). For the study of catalytic properties of synthesized samples 0.25−0.5 mm catalyst fraction was used to avoid diffusion/heat transfer limitations. The sample (without dilution by quartz or any other material) was put between two pieces of fiberglass (which prevented the carryover of the catalyst during the reaction) in U-shaped metallic reactor. Conditions of the catalyst pretreatment included calcination in air at 550 °C and reduction in ﬂowing hydrogen at 550 °C. The time of each experiment was 5 h. The composition of products was analyzed on-line using a Tsvet 500 gas chromatograph equipped with an Rt-Alumina PLOT column and flame ionization detector. Internal normalization method was used to calculate the concentration of the reaction products.
Propane conversion was calculated as
X = 100 %*(CinC3H8-CfnC3H8)/ CinC3H8,
Propene selectivity was calculated as
S = 100 %*(CfnC3H6-CinC3H6)/(CinC3H8-CfnC3H8)
The yield of the light reaction products was calculated as
Y (C1-C2) = CfnCH4 + CfnC2H4 + CfnC2H6
The yield of the reaction products with high molecular weight was calculated as
Y (C4+) = ∑ CfnC4+,
where CinC3H8 is the initial content of the propane in the mixture (taken as 100), CinC3H6 is the initial content of the propylene in the mixture (taken as 0), CfnC3H8, CfnC3H6, CfnCH4, CfnC2H4, CfnC2H6, CfnC4+ are the concentrations of the propane, propylene, methane, ethylene, ethane and high molecular weight components in the reaction products at a certain point in time. The relative error in measuring the concentrations was 5%. X, S and Y are measured in %.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Study of the anchorage of Au chloride complexes on MgAl-LDH
The study of the composition of metal complexes fixed on the surface of the support is an important stage in the study of metal catalysts. DRES is one of the methods that allow us to carry out such studies. The process of anchoring of Pt (IV) chloride complexes on various forms of MgAl-LDH by the DRES method has been studied by us in detail earlier [24]. It was shown that the fixation of [PtCl6]2− on MgAl−CO3 occurs in the form of deeply hydrolyzed forms of platinum stabilized on the surface of the support. Upon the adsorption of these complexes on MgAl−OH, platinum is stabilized mainly in the form of the complexes of the initial composition. This is due to different localization of the platinum compounds during their adsorption on the various forms of MgAl-LDH. Thus, the complexes are anchored on the outer surface of the support due to its surface OH groups for MgAl−CO3. The high pH value in the near-surface of the support leads to the hydrolysis of the complexes. In the case of adsorption on MgAl−OH, the fixation of platinum complexes occurs in interlayer space due to anion exchange. Anion complexes held as a result of electrostatic interaction with positively charged layers without a noticeable change in the composition of their coordination sphere.
Despite the fact that Au/LDH systems have already been synthesized in some works [[11], [12], [13]], none of them studied the initial stage of interaction of the metal complex with the support surface. DRES spectra for systems obtained by adsorption of [AuCl4]− complexes on hydroxide (MgAl−CO3 and MgAl−OH) and oxide (MgAlOx) forms of LDH are presented in Fig. 1. Both the spectra of freshly prepared samples and of samples stored in air for 7 days were obtained.

The transmission spectrum of the H[AuCl4] solution contains bands at 223 nm (44 843 cm−1) and 333 nm (33 333 cm−1), which, according to the literature, correspond to the ligand-metal charge transfer bands (Fig. S1) [25]. There is a wide band with a maximum at 45 000 cm−1 in the DRES of the [AuCl4]- complexes anchored at different forms of supports (Fig. 1a). There are no clear bands in the region of lower wavelengths. This may be due to the hydrolysis of gold complexes upon their contact with the basic surface of the supports. The large band width also indicates some heterogeneity in the composition of the surface compounds. Observed formation of a hydrolyzed forms upon interaction with basic supports well correlates with the high kinetic lability of gold (III) complexes.
A wide band in the region 35 000 cm−1 is present in the spectra of the [AuCl4]/MgAlOx samples (both freshly prepared and after storage). According to the available literature data [26], it corresponds to the absorption of ionic forms of gold. They are polynuclear complexes consisting of square-planar oxide clusters of gold with bridging oxygen present on the support surface. In such complexes, electrons are transferred from Au (III) ions to bridging oxygen ions.
After storing the samples in air and re-examining them by the DRES method, it turned out that an additional band with a maximum at 18 500 cm−1 appeared in the spectrum (Fig. 1b). A similar picture was observed by the authors of [26] when they studied the composition of the [AuCl4]- complexes adsorbed on the surface of γ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3. They found that after the reduction of the [AuCl4]/γ-Al2O3 sample in a H2 flow at 400 °C in the DRES, along with bands at 44 000 and 31 000 cm−1, a band at 19 100 cm−1 in the region of lower energies appeared. As it was found out, this band is characteristic of "plasmon" resonant absorption of light by dispersed particles of Au metal.
Thus, the formation of gold metal particles on the surface of the supports occurred for the systems obtained by anchoring gold chloride complexes on the surface of supports based on MgAl-LDH at storage in air (even without additional processing). This is also confirmed by a change in the color of the samples from light yellow, characteristic of freshly prepared systems, to mauve color, typical of gold in a colloidal state [27], appearing in samples subjected to long-term storage in air.
Structural changes occurring during the adsorption of chloride complexes of gold on the surface of supports based on MgAl-LDH were investigated using the XRD method. Anchoring of the [AuCl4]− on MgAl−CO3 did not lead to destruction of the layered structure (Fig. 2, curve 2). All the reflections characteristic of the hydrotalcite phase presents at diffractogram: in the region of low angles (003 and 006), in the region of average angles (012, 015, 018), and in the region of high angles (110 and 113). We have previously shown that calcination of LDH leads to the destruction of the layered structure and the formation of a mixed oxide MgAlOx with a layered defective spinel structure. The diffraction pattern of calcined LDH contains only two peaks at angles 2θ = 35° and 65° [28]. A complete restoration of the layered structure of the original support occurs during anchoring of the [AuCl4]− on mixed oxides from water solution (Fig. 2, curve 3). At the same time, some broadening of the basal reflexes is observed at diffractograms of the supported systems.

The analysis of structural parameters showed that there is practically no change in the value of the interplanar distance d003 during anchoring of the gold chloride complexes on the LDH, containing CO3-anions in interlayer space (Table 1). In contrast, adsorption of the complexes on the calcined MgAl-LDH after rehydration led to the significant growth of the d003 for supported systems compared with initial. This may indicate that the mechanism of anchoring of gold chloride complexes on the surface of various forms of supports based on MgAl-LDH is similar to the mechanism of anchoring of [PtCl6]2− complexes on the same supports. The constancy of the interlayer distance for the support and for the sample with the anchored [AuCl4]− indicates preferential complex fixation on the outer surface of MgAl−CO3. An increase in the interlayer distance for [AuCl4]−/MgAlOx-2 is the result of introduction of the complexes into the interlayer space during the adsorption of [AuCl4]− complexes on mixed oxide during its rehydration. An increase in the interlayer distance during the fixation of chloride complexes of gold on ZnAl-LDH through anion exchange of NO3-anions in the interlayer space of LDH on [AuCl4]- was observed by the authors of [14]. On the basis of these data, the authors also concluded that the metal complexes are intercalated into the ZnAl-LDH interlayer space.
Table 1. Cell parameters for the support MgAl-2−CO3 and for the samples with anchored [AuCl4]− complexes.
Sample d003, nm c, nm a, nm Lc, nm La, nm
MgAl-2-CO3 0.760 2.277 0.3044 13.4 19.8
[AuCl4]/MgAl-2-CO3 0.762 2.287 0.3046 9.74 17.4
[AuCl4]/MgAlOx-2 0.771 2.313 0.3042 5.42 9.4
The anchoring of [AuCl4]− complexes on different forms of MgAl-LDH practically does not affect the value of the lattice parameter a (Table 1). The value of this parameter is determined by the radii of the cations included in the hydroxide layers. The constancy of the parameter a indicates that the Mg/Al ratio in the supported samples is preserved. Intercalation of the gold complexes in the interlayer space of MgAl-LDH led to the decrease in the crystal size. At the same time crystal size of the MgAl-2−CO3 and [AuCl4]−/MgAl-2−CO3 was very close.
3.2. Study of the influence of the support precursor on the catalysts properties in propane hydrogenation
At first, monometallic Au/MgAlOx-2 (0.3 wt. % Au) and Pt/MgAlOx-2 (0.3 wt. %Pt), as well as bimetallic Au-Pt/MgAlOx-2 (0.3 wt. %Pt and 0.3 wt. %Au) catalysts were prepared using the same type of support precursor (mixed oxides).
According to obtained data, the catalyst Au/MgAlOx-2 was almost inactive in chosen reaction conditions: the propane conversion did not exceed 4% (Fig. 3). Bimetallic catalyst Au-Pt/MgAlOx-2 demonstrated the increased activity in the reaction. The conversion of propane was almost 2 times higher than the corresponding characteristic of monometallic platinum catalysts. At the same time selectivity of target product – propylene was the same and amounted to 99 % for both catalysts. Thus, the introduction of gold in the composition of platinum catalyst based on LDH contribute to a significant increase in the activity.

In continuation of this work monometallic platinum catalysts, as well as bimetallic catalysts containing both platinum and gold, were synthesized using different MgAl-LDH (with CO32− and OH− anions into interlayer space) and mixed oxide MgAlOx with Mg/Al = 3. Dependences of the propane conversion on the type of support precursor (at different reaction times) are presented in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4. Propane conversion for monometallic and bimetallic catalysts obtained using different types of LDH, at various reaction time: a – after 0.17 h., b – after 5 h. Mg/Al = 3.
The propane conversion decreased with increase in the reaction time for all studied catalysts (Fig. 4). Herewith the selectivity of propylene formation was high for all catalysts during the reaction and was 98–99%. The highest selectivity was for the samples obtained using MgAlOx and MgAl−OH support precursor. The lowest selectivity was for the samples prepared using MgAl−CO3. Increase of the propane conversion almost two times after gold introduction was observed for the catalysts prepared using MgAl−OH and MgAlOx. The best catalytic activity was demonstrated by bimetallic catalysts synthesized using mixed oxide as a support precursor. The opposite trend was observed for the systems, prepared using MgAl−CO3: the introduction of Au into the platinum catalyst resulted in the activity decrease was down to 70 % of the initial value (Fig. 4).
Thus, it can be concluded that the localization of complexes of active metals in the interlayer space of the support precursor (MgAl−OH and MgAlOx) improves the catalytic characteristics, and the adsorption of complexes mainly on the outer surface of the support (MgAl−CO3) leads to a significant decrease in the activity of catalysts. Herewith, the best efficiency is achieved when the complexes are intercalated during the rehydration of the mixed oxide. Probably, in this case, most of the active metals are present in the interlayer space.
A number of by-products are formed in addition to the target product, propylene, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. These include light hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, ethylene) formed during the cracking of starting materials, as well as products with a higher molecular weight. The accumulation of the heavy products on the surface of the catalyst leads to its coking and loss of activity. Light hydrocarbons formed due to high reaction temperature, necessary for the endothermic reaction of propane dehydrogenation. Herewith the process of breaking the less strong CC bond is more favored at elevated temperatures. The accumulation of coke is primarily determined by the presence of acid sites on the surface of the catalysts, which promote a stronger adsorption of olefins, provoking their further polymerization and coke deposition. That is why the use of supports based on MgAl-LDH with basic properties is promising for the synthesis of catalysts for the dehydrogenation of paraffins. The content of light hydrocarbons (C1-C2) and hydrocarbons with a higher molecular weight (C4+) in the reaction mixture was monitored in order to assess the contribution of by-products formed in the reaction to the decrease in the selectivity of propylene formation (Fig. 5). The yield of CC bond hydrogenolysis products decreased with an increase in the reaction time for all analyzed systems. After 5 h of catalyst testing, the C1-C2 yield did not exceed 0.08 %. The lower propylene selectivity of catalysts based on MgAl−CO3 is mainly due to the increased amount of light hydrocarbons formed during the reaction when using this type of catalyst (Fig. 5a). Moreover, they are characterized by a higher content of heavy hydrocarbons in comparison with catalysts obtained using MgAl−OH or MgAlOx (Fig. 5, b). This is apparently due to the lower basic properties of the supports formed after calcination of LDH with carbonate anions in the interlayer space [5]. However, at stationary operation of the catalysts, the yield of C4+ products for all samples based on MgAl-LDH was low and did not exceed 0.02 %.

The sizes of particles of supported metals in catalysts were determined to explain the observed catalytic regularities. TEM and chemisorption method (CO adsorption) was used for this purpose. The chemisorption method can only determine the dispersion of platinum. It was previously found that this method is inapplicable for determining of Au size [29].
According to the TEM data, large oval and round particles with wide size distribution are observed for monometallic Au/MgAl−CO3 and Au/MgAlOx catalysts (Fig. 6a, b). Most of the particles in the Au-Pt/MgAl−CO3 sample have a size in the range of 4.0–7.0 nm (Fig. 6, a). Anchoring of gold into interlayer space (Au/MgAlOx sample) promoted to decrease in the size of the formed particles to 3.0–5 nm (Fig. 6b). At the same time for both of the monometallic gold catalysts, the formation of the particles with a size of more than 10 nm was observed. It is possible that such a large particle size is the reason for the low activity of these samples in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

Small particles are observed for the Au-Pt bimetallic catalysts based on the LDH (Fig. 6c, d). The size of the most of particles did not exceed 2.0–3.0 nm. The most active Au-Pt/MgAlOx catalysts are characterized with a higher inhomogeneity of particle size distribution and maximum share of small particles compared with the Au-Pt/MgAl−CO3 catalysts, which had the lowest activity among studied bimetallic samples. The fraction of particles with a size of more than 3 nm did not exceed 30 % for Au-Pt/MgAl−CO3 and 20 % for Au-Pt/MgAlOx catalysts.
In accordance with the data on CO chemisorption, the dispersion of platinum in the Au-Pt/MgAl−CO3 catalyst was higher than in the Au-Pt/MgAlOx sample (Table 2). At the same time, the activity of the catalyst prepared using LDH with CO32− anions into interlayer space was lower than of the samples, based on MgAlOx. A similar relationship was observed for monometallic platinum catalysts synthesized using the same support precursors (MgAl−CO3 and MgAlOx) [30]. Thus, platinum dispersion and catalytic properties of the mono- and bimetallic catalysts change in the same way depending on support precursor (LDH with carbonate-anions or mixed oxide).

3.3. Study of the effect of the Mg/Al ratio on the properties of bimetallic catalysts Au-Pt/MgAlOx in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation
The influence of the Mg/Al ratio in the support on the properties of Pt/MgAlOx monometallic catalysts has been studied in detail in our previous works [5,31]. It was found that with an increase in the Mg/Al ratio, the activity of the corresponding platinum catalysts decreases. This is due to the lower dispersion of Pt in samples with a high Mg/Al ratio.
A similar trend was observed for bimetallic Au-Pt/MgAlOx catalysts. The propane conversion decreased with an increase in the Mg/Al ratio in the support (Fig. 7a). Herewith, the selectivity of propylene formation for samples with Mg/Al = 2 and 3 is close (> 98.5 %), and for a catalyst with a Mg/Al = 4 ratio is lower (Fig. 7b). This is due to the more intensive reaction of the hydrogenolysis of the CC bond with the formation of light hydrocarbons (about 0.1 %) for catalysts with a large Mg/Al ratio (Fig. 7c). The yield of C4+ products for samples with a Mg/Al = 4 ratio was minimal and did not exceed 0.02 %. In general, the yield of products with high molecular weight for the studied systems was low (<0.1 %) and decreased with an increase in the Mg/Al ratio and the reaction time (Fig. 7d).

The dispersion of platinum for bimetallic systems decreased with an increase in the Mg/Al ratio as for monometallic catalysts (Table 2). This explains the catalytic behavior of the samples. This once again confirms a similar mechanism of anchoring of the metal complexes [PtCl6]2− and [AuCl4]− during the formation of mono- and bimetallic catalysts based on MgAl-LDH with different Mg/Al ratios. As shown earlier, both of these complexes are localized predominantly in the MgAl-LDH interlayer space, which is formed upon rehydration of the corresponding mixed oxide. With a decrease in the Mg/Al ratio in the support (and, accordingly, with an increase in the proportion of aluminum in the layers), the density of the positive charge of the layers increases. As shown in [5], a lower Mg/Al ratio promotes a stronger interaction of Pt (IV) chloride complexes with a support and reduces the mobility of complexes in the interlayer space during heat treatment. This leads later (after reduction treatments) to the formation of more dispersed platinum particles. Apparently, the same regularities can be extended to explain the change in the dispersion of Pt and the catalytic activity of bimetallic Au-Pt/MgAlOx catalysts.
3.4. Study of the effect of the Au/Pt ratio on the properties of Au-Pt/MgAlOx catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation
Two series of samples were synthesized to study the effect of the amount of added gold on the properties of platinum catalysts based on MgAl-LDH. In the first series, Au/Pt = 0.5, 1, 1.5 (atomic ratio) at a constant Pt content of 0.3 wt. %. In the second series of samples the atomic ratio Au/Pt = 0.33, 1, 3 was changed at a constant total metal content Au + Pt =0.6 wt. %. The exact content of metals in the synthesized samples is presented in Table 3.

The activity of both series of bimetallic catalysts was higher than monometallic platinum catalysts regardless of Au/Pt ratio (Fig. 8). Even with a decrease in the Pt content to 0.15 wt. % (sample of the second series, Au/Pt = 3), the propane conversion was 10 % higher than for the 0.3 Pt/MgAlOx-3 monometallic catalyst. With an increase in the Au/Pt ratio, the propane conversion decreased. For the catalysts of the second series (constant total content of active metals 0.6 wt.%), this tendency is manifested to a greater extent. The best catalytic characteristics of samples with a high platinum content indicate that the reaction proceeds primarily with the participation of platinum centers. Apparently, gold in this case is not a hydrogenating metal.

For all catalysts studied in these series of experiments, the selectivity of propylene formation during the reaction was higher than 98 %. The yield of light products of CC bond hydrogenolysis decreased with an increase in the Au/Pt ratio in both series of catalysts. After 5 h of catalyst testing, it did not exceed 0.1 % (S2,a, S3,a). The yield of products with a higher molecular weight for the studied systems was low and at a steady state operation of the catalyst was practically the same and amounted to 0.02 % (S2b, S3, b).
4. Conclusion
In the present work, platinum, gold, and platinum-gold catalysts were obtained using aluminum-magnesium layered double hydroxides as the support precursors. It was shown using DRES and XRD that gold chloride complexes are anchored on the selected support precursors predominantly in a hydrolyzed form without destroying the layered structure of LDH. The mechanism of anchorage of [AuCl4]− complexes on different forms of LDH is similar to the mechanism of anchorage of [PtCl6]2- complexes. When MgAl−OH or MgAlOx were used as support precursors the complexes are predominantly fixed in the interlayer space. Gold chloride complexes were anchored on the outer of the supports surface during adsorption on LDH with CO32- counterions.
It was shown that the introduction of gold into the composition of a platinum catalyst based on LDH leads to the increase in the propane conversion without impairing the selectivity for the main product (propylene). Next, we varied the form of LDH taken for adsorption (with OH− and CO32-anions in the interlayer space, calcined LDH), the Mg/Al ratio in the support, the total concentration of platinum and gold, and the Au/Pt ratio. It is shown that the anchoring of active metals complexes in the interlayer space of LDH contributes to a decrease in the size of metal particles and, as a consequence, to an improvement in catalytic properties. An increase in the Mg/Al ratio in the support leads to a decrease in the dispersion of platinum in bimetallic catalysts and, as in the case of monometallic platinum catalysts, to a decrease in the propane conversion. Also, it was found that the activity of bimetallic catalysts is higher than the activity of similar monometallic platinum systems regardless of the Au/Pt ratio. Moreover, the propane conversion is higher for catalysts with a higher platinum content. Thus, it can be concluded that the introduction of gold into the composition of platinum catalysts based on LDH promotes geometric dilution of platinum active centers, leading to an increase in their dispersion. At the same time, gold itself does not perform a dehydrogenating function. The use of mixed oxides with a Mg/Al = 2 ratio for anchoring of gold and platinum chloride complexes with a minimum Au/Pt ratio (Au/Pt = 0.5 with a platinum content of 0.3 wt% and Au/Pt = 0.33 with a total platinum and gold content of 0.6 wt%.) leads to the formation of the most active catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane with a high (> 99 %) selectivity of propylene formation. Additional research needs to be carried out in order to explain the existence of an optimal ratio of metals and the mechanism of their mutual influence on each other.
