1. Introduction
Propene is one of the most important olefins, being widely used as a starting material for valuable chemical intermediates including polypropylene and propylene oxide [1]. A large amount of propene has been supplied by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, in which it is produced as a byproduct [2]. The recent shift in the steam cracking feedstock, from naphtha to ethane, has caused a shortage in the propene supply because the ethane crackers mainly produce ethene rather than other olefins [1,3,4]. Thus, the steady growth in the demand for propene motivates the development of alternative processes that exclusively yield propene. The high availability of cheap propane from shale resources and the economic benefits obtained by converting propane to propene have directed attention towards the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene (C3H8 ↔ C3H6 + H2).
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic reaction. As a result, it requires high reaction temperatures (>600 ℃) to achieve sufficient equilibrium conversion (> 50%) at ambient pressure [3,5]. Under such harsh reaction conditions, the active phases of the catalysts are rapidly deactivated by coke deposition and sintering. This high reaction temperature allows short-time reaction over the catalysts with frequent catalyst regeneration in industrial PDH processes. Currently two types of supported catalysts, Pt-Sn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3, are used in the commercial processes [3,[6], [7], [8], [9]]. Despite the employment of these catalysts, the high expenditure of Pt and severe toxicity of the Cr6+ species still demand the development of alternative catalysts with economic and environmental benefits [3,10].
As an attempt to find active materials, GaOx-, WOx-, VOx-, FeOx-, AlOx-, ZnOx-, and InOx-based metal oxides have been tested for light alkane dehydrogenation [3,[11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. Previous studies have revealed that the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites near the oxygen vacancies are catalytically active. These sites can be generated either by pretreating the catalysts in a flow of reducing gas or by mixing metal oxides. Indeed, partially reduced bulk WOx and FeOx/Al2O3 exhibited noticeably higher activities than their fully oxidized counterparts [13,20]. It was suggested that this enhanced performance arises from the creation of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites. Chen et al. also reported that the GaxAl10-xO15 catalyst displays higher activity than Ga2O3 for PDH [11]. They reported that the formation of spinel-type Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions creates more coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations, thereby leading to an increase in the activity.
ZrO2 has been widely used as a supporting material in many catalytic reactions owing to its high chemical stability and amphoteric properties [[22], [23], [24], [25]]. Recent studies have reported that unsupported ZrO2-based catalysts are highly active and selective in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane, n-butane, and isobutane. Similar to other metal oxides, coordinatively unsaturated metal ions, Zrcus4+ in this case, serve as active sites for dehydrogenation [26,27]. Thus, the creation of more Zrcus4+ sites is key to improving the catalytic performance of ZrO2-based catalysts for PDH. Substitution of metal atoms, which have lower coordination numbers and/or different radii, into the Zr lattice is one way to generate structural oxygen defects and therefore, Zrcus4+ ions [12,26,28]. This strategy has been successfully applied to several ZrO2-based catalysts such as La-doped, Y-doped, and Cr-doped ZrO2. In terms of acidity, Zrcus4+ ions correspond to Lewis acid sites. This implies that the activity of ZrO2-based catalysts is closely related to the number of Lewis acid sites on the surface of the metal oxides. However, their correlation in PDH over ZrO2-based catalysts is still unclear.
In this work, a series of bulk Cu-doped ZrO2 metal oxides (CuZrO-x) were prepared via the co-precipitation method. Their catalytic performances for PDH were compared to investigate the influence of the amount of Cu dopant on the catalytic activity. Moreover, the physical and chemical properties of CuZrO-x were systematically investigated by various techniques, including near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), to understand the states of the doped Cu and Zr in CuZrO-x. Our results revealed that the addition of Cu, which has a lower valence state and smaller radii than Zr, can promote the creation of Zrcus4+ ions and thus, the activity for PDH. It was found that the catalytic activity depends on the number of weak acid sites on CuZrO-x. Additionally, the role of the Cu dopant was examined by comparing the properties of CuZrO-x with those of Cu-impregnated ZrO2.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
CuZrO-x catalysts with various Cu contents were prepared by the co-precipitation method. In a typical synthesis, specified amounts of ZrO(NO3)2∙xH2O (Sigma Aldrich, 99%) and Cu(NO3)2∙3H2O (Sigma Aldrich, Puriss p.a.) were dissolved in 200 mL deionized water to obtain a total cation concentration of 0.1 M. While vigorously stirring the solution at room temperature, an aqueous ammonia solution (Samchun Pure Chemical, 28–30 wt%) was added dropwise until a pH of 9 was reached. The solution was aged at 100 ℃ for 12 h under static conditions. Subsequently, the precipitate was filtered and washed several times with deionized water until a pH of 7 was attained. The precipitate was dried at 110 ℃ for 12 h and then calcined at 600 ℃ for 3 h. The obtained solid powders were labeled as CuZrO-x, where x denotes the molar ratio of [Cu]/([Zr]+[Cu])×100 in the samples. For the preparation of Cu/ZrO-8, pure ZrO2 was first synthesized by the precipitation method without adding the Cu precursor. Next, Cu was deposited on the ZrO2 by the incipient wetness method using an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2∙3H2O. Subsequently, the sample was dried at 110 ℃ for 12 h and calcined at 600 ℃ for 3 h.
For comparison of the catalytic performances, 1 wt% Pt/Al2O3, 0.5 wt% Pt-1.5 wt% Sn/Al2O3, and 5 wt% CrOx/Al2O3 were also prepared. The 1 wt% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was purchased from Alfa Aesar. The Pt1Sn3/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by wet impregnation method [9]. For the preparation of the Pt1Sn3/Al2O3 catalyst, a γ-alumina support (Sasol, Puralox SCCa 5/150) was wet-impregnated with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6∙xH2O (Sigma Aldrich, 99.9%) and SnCl2∙2H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 98%). The catalyst was dried at 60 ℃ for 2 h and subsequently overnight at 120 ℃. Next, it was calcined at 560 ℃ for 3 h. The 5 wt% Cr/Al2O3 was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of a γ-alumina support (Sasol, Puralox SCCa 5/150) with an aqueous solution of Cr(NO3)3∙9H2O (ACROS, 99%). The sample was then dried at 110 ℃ for 12 h and subsequently calcined at 600 ℃ for 3 h.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The bulk composition of the samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on a SPECTRO ARCOS FHM22 spectrometer.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/Max 2500-PC diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 100 mA with a Cu-Kα radiation source (λ =1.54 Å). The fraction of the tetragonal phase in the sample was calculated using the equation [29]:
where
,
, and
represent the 2θ peak intensities at 28.3°, 31.8°, and 30.3°, respectively.
Nitrogen physisorption was carried out at 77 K using a BELSORP-mini II instrument. The samples were pretreated under N2 flow at 150 ℃ for 12 h prior to measurement. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were calculated using the data obtained over the relative pressure range 0.1 ≤ p/p0 ≤ 0.3.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a JEOL JEM-2100 F transmission electron microscope at the Korea Basic Science Institute (Daegu, Korea). TEM-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2200FS microscope at the National Institute for Nanomaterials Technology (Pohang, Korea).
H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was conducted on a BELCAT II. The sample was reduced in a stream of 5 vol% H2/Ar gas mixture (total 30 sccm), from room temperature to 700 ℃, at a heating rate of 5 ℃/min. The amount of consumed H2 was monitored with a thermal conducting detector (TCD).
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) under ultra-high vacuum at the Korea Basic Science Institute (Busan, Korea). The binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 285.0 eV. Near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) studies were performed with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν =1486.6 eV) at the Korea Basic Science Institute (Daejeon, Korea). The analysis of the sample was conducted at 500 ℃ while exposing the sample to H2 (0.1 mbar), propane (1 mbar), and O2 (1 mbar).
Fourier transform infrared spectra of adsorbed pyridine (Py-FTIR) were recorded on a Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a diffuse reflectance (DRIFT) cell (PIKE Technologies DiffuseIR™). Prior to pyridine adsorption, the sample was pretreated in a flow of 5 vol% H2 in Ar (total 100 sccm) at 600 ℃ for 1 h and then cooled down to 50 ℃ in an Ar flow. After pyridine vapor was introduced into the cell for 10 min, the sample was heated to 100 ℃ to remove the physisorbed pyridine and the FTIR spectra were then recorded at 100 ℃.
Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was conducted on a BELCAT II using a 100 mg sample. Prior to NH3-TPD, the sample was reduced in a stream of 10 vol% H2/He gas mixture (total 50 sccm) at 600 ℃ for 1 h. Next, the sample was cooled down to 120 ℃ in a He flow. After the temperature was stabilized at 120 ℃, the pre-reduced sample was exposed to a 5 vol% NH3/He gas mixture (total 50 sccm) for 30 min and cooled down to 80 ℃ in a He flow. The sample was then heated from 80 to 700 ℃ at a heating rate of 10 ℃/min in a He flow (30 sccm). The amount of ammonia desorbed from the sample was monitored with a mass spectrometer (MS).
2.3. Catalytic tests
The catalytic performances for PDH were evaluated at ambient pressure using a tubular fixed-bed quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 4 mm. The flow rates of each gas were regulated using calibrated mass flow controllers. The reaction temperature was measured with a type K thermocouple positioned at the top of the catalyst bed inside the quartz reactor and controlled by a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. The powder catalysts were pelletized to obtain a uniform grain size of 425–850
and 200 mg of the catalyst was used for the performance tests. Prior to the reaction, the reactor was first heated to the reaction temperature, 550 ℃ or 600 ℃, under Ar flow for 1 h. Subsequently, the loaded catalyst was pretreated in a flow of 10 vol% H2/Ar gas mixture at the reaction temperature for 1 h. After purging the reactor with Ar for 15 min, a gas mixture of 8 sccm C3H8 and 52 sccm Ar (WHSVpropane =4.73 h−1) was introduced into the reactor to evaluate the catalytic performance. Then, the product gas was analyzed at 6 min intervals from 5 min, using online gas chromatograph (YL6500, Younglin Instrument Co., Korea) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The propane conversion (Xpropane), product selectivity (Si), and activity were calculated as follows:
where npropane is the number of moles of propane, ni is the number of moles of the C1-C3 products (CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H6), ai is the number of carbon atoms in the corresponding product, Fpropane is the molar flow rate of propane, and W is the weight of the catalyst. In the calculations, the conversion of propane to coke was not considered because the carbon balance was within
3% during the measurements.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the CuZrO-x catalysts
3.1.1. Structural properties of the CuZrO-x catalysts
Fig. 1(a) displays the powder XRD patterns of the CuZrO-x samples with different molar ratios, where x = [Cu]/([Zr]+[Cu])
100. The pure ZrO2 only presented the diffraction peaks of the monoclinic phase (m-ZrO2) at 2θ = 24.5°, 28.3°, 31.8°, 34.5°, 35.6°, 49.6°, and 50.5°. The crystal structure of the sample changed from the monoclinic to the tetragonal phase (t-ZrO2) with increasing Cu content, presenting the corresponding peaks at 2θ = 30.3°, 35.2°, 50.5°, and 60.2°. In general, ZrO2 is in the monoclinic phase at room temperature. It has been reported that doping ZrO2 with transition metals of different atomic radii and/or oxidation states leads to the distortion of the ZrO2 lattice and/or a charge imbalance, thereby creating oxygen vacancies [[30], [31], [32]]. The stabilization of these defects results in the transformation from the monoclinic to the metastable tetragonal phase. Thus, the appearance of the tetragonal phase in CuZrO-x indicates the generation of oxygen vacancies by the substitution of Cu into the Zr sites. The tetragonal phase fraction in the prepared samples linearly increases with Cu content up to 10 mol% as shown in Fig. 1(b). Complete transformation to the tetragonal phase, corresponding to 100% tetragonal fraction, occurs between 10 and 15 mol%. This implies that the optimal amount of Cu for the creation of oxygen vacancies in CuZrO-x is slightly less than 15 mol%. It also reveals the possibility of the presence of excess Cu in CuZrO-15 and CuZrO-25. Indeed, the CuZrO-25 sample exhibits a diffraction peak at 2θ = 38.7°, resulting from the bulk CuO formed from the excess Cu (Fig. S1).

The specific surface areas obtained by nitrogen physisorption for the CuZrO-x samples are listed in Table 1. The CuZrO-x samples have greater surface areas (47–77 m2 g−1) than that of pure ZrO2 (42 m2 g−1). The surface areas as a function of the Cu content are displayed in Fig. 2. The surface area increases with an increase in the Cu content until it reaches 10 mol%, where it exhibits the highest surface area of 77 m2 g−1, and thereafter decreases to 60 m2 g−1. As mentioned above, the addition of Cu can induce the creation of structural defects by incorporation of Cu into the Zr lattice sites. As a result, it accompanies the structural change of ZrO2 into the tetragonal phase and the increase in the surface area of CuZrO-x. After complete structural change to the tetragonal phases, however, the surface area begins to decrease as illustrated for CuZrO-15 and CuZrO-25. This is attributed to the presence of excess Cu and the formation of bulk CuO (Fig. 1). The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of CuZrO-x display type IV curves with H2-type hysteresis and reflect the existence of mesopores in the prepared samples (Fig. S2). Moreover, the representative TEM images of the samples confirm that they are composed of particle agglomerates with mesopores (Fig. S3). The representative EDS images of CuZrO-8 reveal that doped Cu is homogeneously mixed with ZrO2 (Fig. S4).

3.1.2. Chemical properties of the CuZrO-x catalysts
The states of the Cu species in the as-prepared CuZrO-x samples were investigated by H2-TPR. The TPR profiles of the CuZrO-x samples are illustrated in Fig. 3. Pure ZrO2 does not present a reduction peak in the range 100–300 ℃ but it shows only a small peak at ∼625 ℃, corresponding to the evolution of H2O (Fig. S5). With the addition of a small amount of Cu, however, CuZrO-5 presents its first peak (α) at ∼150 ℃. On increasing the Cu concentration, a second peak (β) appears at a higher temperature of ∼170 ℃ for the CuZrO-8 and CuZrO-10 samples. The reduction temperature of CuO depends on its dispersion and crystallinity [33,34]. The α and β reduction peaks observed for CuZrO-5, CuZrO-8, and CuZrO-10 are assigned to the reduction of the isolated and finely dispersed CuO species. Existence of the CuO species suggests that the doped Cu atoms are well incorporated into the Zr lattice without aggregation, even after calcination at a high temperature of 600 ℃. On the other hand, the CuZrO-15 and CuZrO-25 samples presented three distinct peaks. The additional reduction peak (γ) at ∼200 ℃ is ascribed to the reduction of the large crystalline CuO, which interacts weakly with ZrO2. This agrees with previous observations that the reduction temperature of the larger CuO crystallites is higher than that of the well-dispersed CuO species. These H2-TPR results also support the formation of bulk CuO from the excess Cu, as illustrated in the XRD patterns in Fig. 1.

Fig. 3. H2-temperature-programmed (H2-TPR) profiles of the calcined CuZrO-x samples.
The chemical states of the as-calcined CuZrO-x samples were analyzed by XPS. The relative Cu composition on the catalyst surface and the Zr 3d5/2, O 1s, and Cu 2p3/2 binding energies are listed in Table 2. The CuZrO-5, CuZrO-8, and CuZrO-10 samples exhibit a greater Cu surface ratio ([Cu]/([Zr]+[Cu])) than the bulk ratio measured by ICP-OES. This reveals surface enrichment of the Cu species in the samples. The Cu surface ratio increases with an increasing amount of doped Cu up to 10 mol% and thereafter becomes saturated. This saturation is related to the formation of crystalline CuO on ZrO2, which occurs when the Cu loadings exceed their dispersion capacity [35]. The saturations of the Cu surface ratios observed for CuZrO-15 and CuZrO-25 agree with our XRD and H2-TPR results, which also indicate the formation of bulk CuO.

Fig. 4 represents the Zr 3d and Cu 2p core-level spectra of the as-calcined CuZrO-x catalysts. The Zr 3d3/2 and Zr 3d5/2 peaks have an area ratio of 2:3 with a binding energy difference of ∼2.35 eV by spin orbital splitting (Fig. 4(a)). All the CuZrO-x catalysts presented a Zr 3d5/2 peak at the binding energy range 181.7–182.1 eV, corresponding to the Zr4+ state [36]. As observed in the CuZrO-5 and CuZrO-8 catalysts, the addition of a small amount of Cu induces a slight peak shift of ˜0.3 eV towards the lower binding energies in the Zr 3d spectra. These peaks still exhibit a symmetric feature suggesting that there is no change in the oxidation state of the Zr ion. Similar observation has been reported for the Cu/ZrO2 catalysts, in which this peak shift was interpreted as the generation of oxygen vacancies by the substitution of Cu ions into the ZrO2 lattice [37]. Based on the observation that this shift disappears with a further increase in the amount of doped Cu, it seems that the formation of CuO crystallites on the catalyst surface leads to a decrease in the number of oxygen vacant sites.

Fig. 4. X-ray photoelectron core-level spectra of (a) Zr 3d and (b) Cu 2p for the as-calcined CuZrO-x catalysts.
The Cu 2p core-level spectra of the as-calcined CuZrO-x catalysts exhibit broad peaks at 932.8–933.2 eV (Cu 2p3/2) and 952.6–953.0 eV (Cu 2p1/2), respectively and additional peaks at 949–945 eV and 959–965 eV, respectively (Fig. 4(b)). These additional peaks are assigned to shake-up satellite peaks and generally confirm the presence of CuO and therefore, Cu2+ species [38]. An increase in the amount of Cu content leads to the peaks shifting towards a higher binding energy. Previous studies have shown that such shifts reflect a decrease in the dispersion of CuO on the surface [35,38]. The XPS results in this study also suggest that excess Cu leads to the formation of bulk CuO crystallites, while the Cu species exists in the form of highly dispersed CuO in the CuZrO-5 and CuZrO-8 catalysts [39].
To further understand the chemical states under pretreatment, reaction and regeneration conditions, the CuZrO-8 catalyst was next characterized by NAP-XPS. All the analyses were performed at 500 ℃ under hydrogen, propane, and oxygen environments. All the Zr 3d core-level spectra presented two symmetric peaks with a 2:3 area ratio and a binding energy difference of ∼2.35 eV (Fig. S6). The overlapped Zr 3d spectra indicate that there is no change in the oxidation state of the Zr ions, Zr4+ state, in the CuZrO-8 catalyst under different gas conditions. However, the Cu 2p core-level spectra reveal a noticeable change in the oxidation state of Cu, depending on the gas employed. Fig. 5(a) illustrates that under both hydrogen and propane environments, the Cu 2p3/2 peaks have similar binding energies of ∼931.6 eV. Notably, the binding energies are significantly lower than that of the as-calcined CuZrO-8 displayed in Fig. 4(b). Moreover, no shake-up satellite peaks appear under these gas conditions. Because the shake-up satellite peak at 938–945 eV evidences the presence of Cu2+ species, these results indicate that the Cu species in CuZrO-8 are reduced from Cu2+ to Cu+ and Cu0 under hydrogen pretreatment and the reaction conditions. Indeed, the Cu LMM Auger spectra in Fig. 5(b) confirm that both Cu+ and Cu0 species are present in the CuZrO-8 catalyst under these conditions [40,41]. On the other hand, the Cu species are in fully oxidized form, Cu2+, under an oxygen environment. The Cu 2p core-level spectrum in Fig. 5(a) exhibits a broad Cu 2p3/2 peak at a higher binding energy of 933.4 eV with a satellite peak. These features are similar to those of the as-calcined CuZrO-8 catalyst displayed in Fig. 4(b). The presence of Cu2+ is also confirmed by the peak at 917.5 eV in the Cu LMM Auger spectrum [41].

As mentioned above, the substitution of a dopant with different atomic radii and/or oxidation states in the ZrO2 lattice can lead to the distortion and/or imbalance of the lattice charge accompanying the generation of oxygen vacancies. For the CuZrO-x catalysts, the structural transformation to the metastable tetragonal phase in the XRD patterns and the shift of the Zr 3d peaks to lower binding energies in the XP spectra imply the creation of oxygen vacancies in the catalysts. With respect to the coordination of the Zr ions, the formation of oxygen vacancies also results in the creation of coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ (Zrcus4+) sites. It has been found that these sites reveal Lewis acid properties in many metal oxides [11,17]. Therefore, pyridine and ammonia were used as probe molecules to estimate the acidic properties of the CuZrO-x catalysts. Fig. 6(a) displays the FTIR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on pure ZrO2 and a representative CuZrO-x sample, CuZrO-8. Prior to pyridine adsorption, the samples were pretreated in a flow of 10 vol% H2 at 600 ℃. Both samples displayed well resolved bands at 1447 cm−1, 1575 cm−1, and 1604 cm−1 ascribed to the pyridine adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites but a negligible band at 1540 cm−1 assigned to pyridine adsorbed on the Brønsted acid sites. These results indicate that only Lewis acid sites are present on the surfaces of the CuZrO-x catalysts, regardless of the Cu content.

The NH3-TPD spectra for the CuZrO-x catalysts are presented in Fig. 6(b). The desorption temperature and total area under the peaks in the spectra provide information on the strength and amount of acid sites in the catalysts, respectively. For detailed characterization, the broad NH3 desorption peaks were deconvoluted into three Gaussian peaks based on semi-empirical methods (Fig. S7) [26,42,43]. The peak temperatures of the three deconvoluted peaks, peak α, peak β, and peak γ, were set to ∼165 ℃, ∼225 ℃, and ∼310 ℃, respectively. Therefore, in this case, peak α and peak β correspond to the relatively weak acid sites, while peak γ represents the strong acid sites. The estimated acid site density for each peak of the CuZrO-x catalysts is summarized in Table 1. A comparison of the total amount of acid sites reveals that the CuZrO-x catalysts have a lower value than that of the pure ZrO2. As displayed in Fig. 6(b), the desorption peaks of the CuZrO-x catalysts are in a narrower temperature range than that observed for the ZrO2 sample. This indicates that the addition of Cu into ZrO2 leads to a significant decrease in the number of strong acid sites, corresponding to peak γ. Conversely, doping with a small amount of Cu led to an increase in the amount of weak acid sites as observed in the CuZrO-5, CuZrO-8, and CuZrO-10 samples. These samples exhibited higher peak intensities than that of pure ZrO2 at temperatures < 300 ℃ in the NH3 desorption spectra. The substitution of Cu into ZrO2 creates Zrcus4+ sites revealing Lewis acid properties. Thus, the increase in the number of weak Lewis acid sites, corresponding to peak α and peak β, is expected to arise from the increase in the number of Zrcus4+ sites. Further increases in the Cu contents to 15 and 25 mol% result in a decrease in the amount of weak acid sites. Based on our XRD, H2-TPR, XPS, and N2-physisorption results, the formation of Cu crystallites and decrease in the surface area seems to have a negative influence on the creation of Zrcus4+ sites in these catalysts.
3.1.3. Catalytic performances of the CuZrO-x catalysts in propane dehydrogenation
The catalytic performances of the CuZrO-x catalysts in the PDH reaction were tested at 550 and 600 ℃. Prior to the reaction, all the catalysts were pretreated in hydrogen at the corresponding reaction temperature. Fig. 7 displays the initial specific activity and propene selectivity of the CuZrO-x catalysts measured at 5 min TOS. All the CuZrO-x catalysts exhibited a significant increase in the specific activity with the increase in the reaction temperature from 550 to 600 ℃. However, faster deactivation with time-on-stream was also observed at 600 ℃ (Fig. S8). The propene selectivity remained higher than 98% at both reaction temperatures regardless of the Cu content in the CuZrO-x samples. With respect to the Cu content, all the CuZrO-x samples, except CuZrO-25, exhibited improved activity over that of pure ZrO2, thereby demonstrating the positive effect of Cu doping. Among the CuZrO-x catalysts, the CuZrO-8 sample presented the highest activity, whereby Cu contents ≥ 15 mol% resulted in a decrease in the activity. This was attributed to the excess Cu species forming bulk Cu crystallites. It should be pointed out that there was no clear relationship between the surface area and the catalytic activity of CuZrO-x. Despite higher surface area, CuZrO-15 revealed lower activity than CuZrO-5. Thus, the enhancement on catalytic performance can be explained by the increase in the number of Zrcus4+ ions. The initial conversion and propene selectivity of CuZrO-8 were further compared with those of conventional catalysts by using the same total amount of catalyst. Despite the fact that CuZrO-8 is an unsupported catalyst, it exhibited a comparable conversion and higher selectivity than others as shown in Fig. 8.

The catalytic performance of CuZrO-8 was measured at 600 ℃ for 10 cycles of PDH reaction to see its stability. After each reaction, the catalyst was regenerated by air treatment, followed by hydrogen treatment at reaction temperature. As the cycle was repeated, the activity gradually decreased but propylene selectivity remained the same (Fig. 9). The spent CuZrO-8 sample revealed a different H2-TPR spectrum compared to that of a fresh sample (Fig. S9). The appearance of a new peak at ∼200 ℃ indicates that the formation of bulk CuO led to the deactivation of CuZrO-8 catalyst during the repeated cycles.

Substitution of Cu into the Zr lattice can lead to the creation of oxygen vacancies in CuZrO-x. Thus, the Zr atoms neighboring the oxygen vacancies, Zrcus4+ sites, reveal weak Lewis acid sites. Indeed, the NH3-TPD results reveal that a small amount of Cu doping increases the number of weak Lewis acid sites, corresponding to peak α and peak β (Table 1). Thus, the specific activity of CuZrO-x can be interpreted by the number of weak acid sites. Fig. 10 displays the relationship between the activity of the CuZrO-x samples and their number of weak acid sites. The data reveal that the CuZrO-x samples with more weak acid sites exhibited higher activity. This supports that the Zrcus4+ sites generated by the substitution of Cu act as active sites for PDH. Our results agree with the previous studies on PDH over ZrO2-based metal oxides [26,27]. In other metal oxides, including CrOx, GaOx, VOx, FeOx, and AlOx, the coordinatively unsaturated metal ions (Mcusx+) also serve as adsorption sites for the CxH2x+1 species, a reaction intermediate for dehydrogenation [3,6,11,13,17,[44], [45], [46]].

3.1.4. Role of Cu in the CuZrO-x catalysts
The Zrcus4+ sites created by the incorporation of Cu contribute towards the improvement of the catalytic activity. When considering the role of doped Cu into ZrO2, one may expect that Cu itself acts as the active species for PDH. To clarify the role of Cu, a Cu/ZrO-8 sample was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation and its properties and catalytic performance were compared to those of the CuZrO-8 sample prepared by co-precipitation. The Cu/ZrO-8 catalyst presented a significantly different XRD pattern from that of CuZrO-8 (Fig. 11(a)). Although CuZrO-8 undergoes a transformation from the monoclinic (m-ZrO2) to the tetragonal (t-ZrO2) structure following the addition of Cu, the Cu/ZrO-8 remains in the monoclinic phase, which is the same as that of pure ZrO2. Moreover, the Cu/ZrO-8 has a similar surface area, 47 m2/g, to that of pure ZrO2, 42 m2/g. These results suggest that the impregnated Cu species exists on the ZrO2 surface and do not create any oxygen vacancies and Zrcus4+ sites. The negligible influence of the impregnated Cu on the generation of Zrcus4+ sites was also confirmed by the XPS data (Fig. 11(b)). The Zr 3d peak shift to a lower binding energy, a feature arising from the creation of oxygen vacancies and Zrcus4+ sites, was not observed for the Cu/ZrO-8 sample. As a result, despite the addition of Cu, the amount of weak acid sites in the Cu/ZrO-8 sample was similar to that of pure ZrO2 and less than that of the CuZrO-8 sample (Fig. 11(c)).

Both the Cu/ZrO-8 and CuZrO-8 catalysts comprised the same amount of Cu but different amounts of weak acid sites and therefore, Zrcus4+ sites. Fig. 12 illustrates the initial activities of the pure ZrO2, CuZrO-8, and Cu/ZrO-8 catalysts for PDH. Interestingly, Cu/ZrO-8 exhibits nearly identical activity to that of pure ZrO2, revealing the negligible influence of Cu on the catalytic performance. This indicates that the Cu species itself has no influence on the activity for PDH but promotes activity by its substitution into the Zr lattices and the generation of oxygen vacancies and Zrcus4+ sites. It is also worth pointing out that the addition of Cu suppresses the formation of strong acid sites (Fig. 11(c)). Despite the total amount of acid sites of pure ZrO2 being significantly greater than that of Cu/ZrO-8, both catalysts exhibited similar activities. Again, this shows that the activity can be reliably estimated by the amount of weak acid sites present in the Zr-based catalysts.

4. Conclusions
This study demonstrated that the catalytic activity of ZrO2 can be enhanced by doping with Cu, which has a lower valence state and smaller radii than Zr. For PDH over CuZrO-x catalysts, the Cu only serves as a promoter not as an active site. Therefore, the improvement in catalytic activity arises from the creation of more active sites, namely Zrcus4+ sites, by Cu doping. However, the excess Cu formed bulk CuO, which deteriorated the catalytic performance of the CuZrO-x catalysts. As a result, the CuZrO-8 sample presented the highest activity among the CuZrO-x catalysts. The comparison of CuZrO-x with Cu-impregnated ZrO2 revealed that the catalytic activity significantly depends on the doping method. Nonetheless, the catalytic activity for PDH exhibited a strong correlation with the amount of weak acid sites for both Cu-doped ZrO2 catalysts.
