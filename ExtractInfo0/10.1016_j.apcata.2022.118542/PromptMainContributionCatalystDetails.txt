Influence of hydrophilicity and titanium species on activity and stability of Cr/MWW zeolite catalysts for dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2
Borosilicate zeolite ERB-1 with MWW topological structure was post-processed to prepare deboroned D-ERB-1, pillared layer MCM-36 and delaminated layer structure ITQ-2. Titanium was introduced into MWW structure by atom-planting method. Cr species were loaded by the impregnation for comparison with the one-pot synthesized Cr-MCM-41 and Cr/TS-1. The results show that Cr(Ⅵ) is the active site for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2. As the number of hydroxyl groups on the zeolite increases, the content of CrOx and Cr(VI) loaded also increases. The hydroxyl-anchored Cr(VI) on MWW zeolite is easier to be regenerated. The addition of titanium can enhance the dispersion of Cr on the hydrophilic surface of the MWW zeolite and improve the stability of the catalyst. The presence of surface hydroxyl groups is critical to the activity of CrOx-based catalysts. The CO2 can not only promote the reverse water gas shift reaction but also Bouduoard reaction.
1. Introduction
Ethylene is an important raw material for the production of many petrochemical products. The increasing demand for petrochemical products has led to an increase in the demand for ethylene year by year [1]. For now, naphtha cracking is the main source of ethylene [2]. Ethane dehydrogenation replaces the traditional method to produce ethylene with great promise [3].
Ethane Dehydrogenation is a kind of endothermic reaction, which needs a high temperature to obtain a sizable yield, the high temperature in turn leads to rapid deactivation of catalysts and low product selectivity [4], [5]. Therefore, it has been proposed to add an oxidant to lower the reaction temperature. However, the co-feeding of ethane and oxygen will bring some safety risks and lower ethylene selectivity [6], [7], [8]. Using carbon dioxide as the oxidant, dehydrogenation of ethane and carbon dioxide to ethylene is considered to be a promising method for producing ethylene, because higher selectivity along with the lower generation of the coke can be achieved via adding the carbon dioxide [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Chromium-based catalysts show excellent catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of ethane, but their stability and catalytic activity are insufficient for industrial production [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Zeolites with high specific surface area are often used as the support of chromium-based catalysts, such as Beta, SBA-15, MFI, and so on. The chemical properties of the surface of these supports have a great effect on the active Cr species state and catalytic activity. Piotr et al. [21] found that dealumination has a great influence on the catalytic performance of the catalyst. Compared with the Cr-supported Al-Beta zeolite catalyst, the Cr-supported Si-Beta zeolite catalyst exhibits higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. Smith et al. [22] observed that the difference in the distribution of hydroxyl groups on SBA-15 leads to changes of loaded vanadium species amount, which affects the catalytic behavior for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene reaction. Cheng et al. [23] found that the Cr species on Silicalite-1 with skeletal vacancy defects were better dispersed and had higher catalytic activity for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2. Therefore, preparing a zeolite as support with property to stabilized distribution Cr species is essential for chromium-based catalysts to obtain excellent activity. Mihail et al. [24] found that part of the chromium on the surface of zirconia exists in the form of surface chromate, and the rest form larger Cr2O3 clusters. The chromium on the titanium dioxide forms small Cr2O3 clusters. Lee and Wachs [25] found that adding TiO2 to the surface of SiO2 has a significant effect on the dioxo/monoxide ratio of supported group VI metal oxides (CrOx and WOx). Al-Awadi et al. [26] found that the use of an appropriate amount of TiO2 to modify MCM-41 increased the concentration and stability of Cr species. It exhibits higher catalytic activity for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2.
ERB-1 was a borosilicate zeolite with MWW structure discovered by Millini et al. [27] in 1988. It has a unique channel system with MWW structure, two sets of independent and vertical channels, one of which is a 10-MR channel and the other has a 12-MR super cage, and there are 12-MR bowl-shaped cavities on the surface of the zeolite [28]. The layer structure of ERB-1 is highly modifiable to expose more external layer with 12-MR half-cup and hydroxyl groups by delamination with acid treatment, pillaring with SiO2 [29], [30]. For example, acid treatment can remove the boron atoms in the ERB-1 framework to generate new hydroxyl groups and defect sites. By swelling the ERB-1 precursor and then using SiO2 to prepare MCM-36, mesopore can be introduced and new hydroxyl groups can be generated. Similarly, after swelling the ERB-1 precursor, ultrasonic and acid treatment is performed to prepare ITQ-2 with a delaminated layer structure, which can expose more 12-MR half-cups and generate new hydroxyl groups. Hydroxyl groups can be used to introduce different catalytically active sites, a large specific surface area and more exposed 12-MR half-cups are beneficial to disperse active sites. In addition, the atom-planting method can be applied to incorporate the tetrahydrate titanium active site with the hydroxyl group in the surface of ERB-1 by dehydrochlorination [31].
In this contribution, ERB-1 precursor was synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis, then nitrate acid treatment, or swelling, pillaring, hydrochloric acid and calcination treatment obtain 3D structure borosilicate ERB-1, deboroned D-ERB-1, SiO2 pillared micro/mesoporous composites MCM-36 and layer delaminated ITQ-2 to obtain the different MWW structure zeolite. Cr oxides (CrOx) loaded MWW was created through utilizing impregnation approach in the different MWW structures to investigate the effect of layer structure and generated exposed hydroxyl group during the delamination, pillaring, and deboronation on the stability of CrOx and catalytic performance for ethane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the Ti was incorporated in the deboronated ERB-1 zeolite by atom-planting to disperse the CrOx, which was compared with CrOx loaded TS-1 to investigate the different loaded titanium species state on dispersion CrOx in zeolite and the ethane dehydrogenation catalytic activity. The one-pot hydrothermal synthesized Cr-MCM-41 were also compared with CrOx loaded different MWW zeolite to investigate the different CrOx states on the catalytic activity. The influence of hydroxyl group and the incorporated Ti for dispersion CrOx in MWW zeolite were investigated for the development of stability and high activity ethane dehydrogenation catalyst.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
2.1.1. Synthesis of MWW zeolites
ERB-1 precursor (ERB-1(P)) was synthesized according to our previous method. The ERB-1(P) was prepared using boric acid and fumed nano-silica as the boron source and silicon source, with piperidine as a template, and the molar ratio of B: Si: H2O: piperidine = 2: 1: 19: 1.4 [31]. The ERB-1 precursor was calcined at 823 K to acquire the ERB-1. The deboroned sample D-ERB-1 was obtained with the treatment of ERB-1 in 8 mol/L nitrate acid for 1 day. The feed ratio of ERB-1 to nitrate acid is 1 g: 50 mL [32]. Using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as a pillaring agent, the precursor of ERB-1 was pillared to prepare micro/mesoporous composite MCM-36 [31]. ITQ-2 was synthesis by swelling the ERB-1 precursor with a mixture of tetra propyl ammonium hydroxide (TPAOH): cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMABr): H2O = 1: 4: 5, and then the ultrasonic and HCl acid treatment generate the delaminated pure silicate sample ITQ-2 [33]. The titanium containing sample Ti-D-ERB-1 was prepared by atom-planting method with TiCl4 vapor as the titanium source treated with D-ERB-1 [34]. The detailed synthesis processes of the catalysts are display in Supporting information.
2.1.2. Synthesis of chromium oxide impregnated samples
Supported chromium oxide catalysts could be synthesized after impregnating Cr(NO3)3.9H2O aqueous solution in the carrier by incipient wetness impregnation method. According to the calculated Cr loading amount, the Cr(NO3)3 aqueous solution was dropwise added to the different structure zeolites and continued stirred until fully mixing, and then stand overnight at room temperature. The samples were dried at 353 K. It was subsequently calcined for five hours at 10 K/min rate at 823 K to obtain the samples Cr/ERB-1, Cr/D-ERB-1, Cr/MCM-36, Cr/ITQ-2, and Cr/Ti-D-ERB-1. Samples with different chromium loadings amount of mass percentage 3%, 5% or 8% in zeolite were prepared and named as 3 wt%, 5 wt% or 8 wt%.
2.1.3. Cr-MCM-41 and Cr/TS-1
Synthesize Cr-MCM-41 by one-pot method [35]. The silicon source was TEOS, the Cr source was Cr(NO3)3.9 H2O, and CTMABr was the template. The raw materials were added in a molar ratio of Si: Cr: CTMABr: NH3·H2O: H2O = 1: 0.05: 0.42: 12: 400. According to the order of CTMABr, NH3·H2O, TEOS, Cr(NO3)3.9 H2O, the raw materials were added to distillated water for synthesizing Cr-MCM-41. First, CTMABr and H2O were stirred at 333 K until completely dissolved, then NH3·H2O were added to adjust the pH value, and next Cr(NO3)3.9 H2O and TEOS were added to stir for four hours at 343 K under reflux. The obtained suspension was filtered and then cleaned by using distilled water for three times, which was subsequently dried in an oven overnight at 333 K. The created sample was calcined for five hours at 873 K in air at 2 K/min heating rate. The TS-1 was provided by Sinopec Baling Branch and it was calcined in accordance with the previous guidance. Similarly, Cr(NO3)3.9 H2O is used as the Cr source to prepare Cr/TS-1 by the incipient wetness impregnating method.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of the sample was collected by D-MAX 2500/PC, and the small angle of 0.5–5° and the wide angle of 5–80° were collected under 100 mA and 40 kV Cu Kα radiation. Micromeritics Gemini VII 2390 was utilized to conduct N2 physical adsorption, and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) and the equation of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) was employed for the calculation of specific surface area. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) photos were taken on Hitachi TM3030 and Hitachi S-4800. The electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) in the JEOL JXA-8200 electron probe is used to analyze elements. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on a JEM-2100A and JEM2100 F instrument using an electron beam. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) uses Thermo Fisher's ESCALAB Xi+ and non-monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-rays for measurement. The binding energy is based on the C1s peak at 284.8 eV. UV-Vis spectra were measured on a Hitachi UH-4150 spectrometer, equipped with a diffuse-reflectance sphere and using BaSO4 as a reference. The measuring range of the instrument is 200–800 nm. SDT Q600–1553 TA was used for thermogravimetric analysis. The thermogravimetric test was performed in a N2 flow of 30 mL/min, and the heating rate was 5 K/min. Before the test, the catalyst samples were placed in a 373 K oven to dry for 24 h, and then the catalysts were transferred to an environment with a relative humidity of 80% and allowed to stand for 48 h to control the degree of hydration. The H2-TPR test was performed in Micromeritics Auto Chem II 2920 to determine the state of Cr in the catalyst. The TPR test is carried out in H2/Ar (10 vol%) mixed gas, and the gas flow rate is 32 mL/min. The reduction temperature program is 10 K/min, from 393 to 1073 K. Use the TCD detector to record the signal. In situ infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT) use the Nicolet 6700 with HARRICK, the field infrared data could be collected, with a collection range of 3200 cm−1 to 3900 cm−1. The DRIFT in Fig. S2 uses Bruker TENSOR II with QIRS-A02 to collect infrared data ranging from 3000 to 4000 cm−1. The test sample pressed into tablets, and the test was performed after dehydration at 673 K in an argon atmosphere for 1 h. Raman data was collected on a LabRAM HR Evolution-HORIBA equipped with a 325 nm air-cooled solid-state laser with a power of 25 mW. The transmittance is 100%, the exposure time is 2 s and the accumulation number of 2.
2.3. Catalytic testing
In a fixed-bed reactor, the catalytic investigation of carbon dioxide and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane was performed in the stainless-steel tube reactor (o.d., 20 mm; i.d., 8 mm; length, 300 mm). The filling amount of the catalyst was 0.5 g, and the particle size was 60–80 mesh. Quartz sand was used as diluent to fix the catalyst in the constant temperature section of the reactor. The catalyst was activated for 2 h in a nitrogen stream at atmospheric pressure and 973 K. The reaction atmosphere was a mixed gas flow of alkane, carbon dioxide and nitrogen, the rate of overall flow was 50 mL/min, and the ratio of volume flow was C2H6: CO2: N2 = 5: 15: 30. The reaction temperature was 973 K, and the reaction pressure was normal pressure. The product was detected on-line using GC FULI 9790II equipped with TCD (TDX-01 packed column) and FID (KB-PLOT Q capillary column). The external standard method was used to calculate the mole fraction of each component, and then the mole fraction was used to calculate the mass fraction of each component, and the mass fraction was employed for the calculation of the yield, product selectivity and ethane conversion. The formula is displayed as below, in which F and y respectively represents the molar flow of material and the component molar fraction.
3. Results
3.1. Structural properties
The synthesized CrOx supported MWW structure catalyst was characterized through X-ray diffraction, and its pattern is reflected in Fig. 1. All catalysts retain the characteristic diffraction peaks of MWW structure at 7.1°, 25.1° and 26.1°, which shows that Cr/ERB-1 and Cr/D-ERB-1, Cr/MCM-36 and Cr/ITQ-2 prepared by post-treatment have the basic structure of MWW. Compared with Cr/ERB-1, the diffraction peak intensity of Cr/D-ERB-1 is reduced, but the peak shape is basically the same as that of Cr/ERB-1, and the characteristic diffraction peaks of the 101 and 102 crystal planes are two sharp peaks. This shows that the layered structure of Cr/D-ERB-1 is similar to the structure of Cr/ERB-1, and the acid treatment does not significantly change the layered structure of D-ERB-1. Cr-MCM-41 has three diffraction peaks corresponding to the (100), (110), and (200) crystal planes of MCM-41 molecular sieve at 2θ = 1–5°. This is consistent with the characteristic peaks of typical mesoporous MCM-41 molecular sieve. The TS-1 has the typical framework structure of MFI zeolite. The CrOx-loaded MWW catalyst and Cr/TS-1 also shows characteristic diffraction peaks at 33.5°, 36.1°, 54.7° and 65.1°. This was because the loaded CrOx formed agglomerated Cr2O3 crystal phase on the catalyst surface. These characteristic peaks also appeared in Cr-MCM-41. The XRD pattern of different MWW zeolite samples and TS-1 is shown in Fig. S1. It is not difficult to compare Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 to see that after loading of CrOx the MWW and zeolite MFI structure is still retain, while Cr2O3 characteristic diffraction peaks are appeared.

The N2 desorption and adsorption curve and the pore distribution of BJH of CrOx-loaded MWW structure zeolites are shown in Fig. 2, and the relevant physical parameters are listed in Table 1. Cr/D-ERB-1 and Cr/ERB-1 are the classic I-type isotherms, which indicates that they are microporous zeolites. Cr/Ti-D-ERB-1 is similar to Cr/D-ERB-1. Cr/MCM-36 is a typical IV curve, and its absorption and desorption amount between p/p0 = 0.2–0.4 has a significant increase, which means that there is a mesoporous structure in Cr/MCM-36, and the corresponding BJH pore distribution curve also showed a peak between 2 and 3 nm, which means that TEOS successfully intercalated between the layers of the MWW structure zeolites, and the formation of silica pillars between the layers resulted in a mesoporous structure. Cr/ITQ-2 also has a slow rising trend between p/p0 = 0.2–0.4, which is resulted from the mesopores produced by its disordered stacking structure. Cr-MCM-41 has a typical IV curve and H1 hysteresis loop, which is a typical mesoporous material. Cr/TS-1 is also a microporous zeolite.

Fig. 3 shows the In-situ DRIFT spectra of ERB-1, D-ERB-1, MCM-36, Ti-D-ERB-1, and ITQ-2 samples. The sample of D-ERB-1 exhibited a broad peak between 3420 and 3620 cm−1. This was on account of fact that the borosilicate zeolites ERB-1 will produce a large number of hydroxyl nests after the deboronization by the acid treatment. A sharp peak at 3700–3740 cm−1 was a characteristic peak of silanol [36]. These two characteristic peaks of 3420–3620 cm−1 and 3700–3740 cm−1 indicate that D-ERB-1 contains a large amount of hydroxyl nest and silanol. MCM-36 has an obvious sharp peak at 3700–3740 cm−1, and ITQ-2 has a broad peak mainly at 3400–3700 cm−1. This means that silanol was mainly present in MCM-36, and hydroxyl nests were mainly present in ITQ-2. The two characteristic peaks of Ti-D-ERB-1 at 3420–3620 cm−1 and 3700–3740 cm−1 after titanium loading weakened. This was because the TiCl4 dehydrochlorination with the hydroxyl nest, and the titanium atom occupy the position of the hydroxyl nest and the silanol, and was successfully incorporated into the framework of D-ERB-1 to form the Ti-D-ERB-1 zeolites. Moreover, Fig. S2 shows the in situ FTIR spectra of D-ERB-1, MCM-36 and ITQ-2 before and after loading CrOx. It can be seen that when CrOx was loaded on sample, the two peaks at 3420–3620 cm−1 and 3700–3740 cm−1 almost completely disappeared. This means that after CrOx was loaded, it has a strong interaction with the hydroxyl group to occupy the position of the hydroxyl group.

Thermogravimetric analysis was used to investigate the number of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst, and the result is shown in Fig. 4. The weight loss of the catalyst before 373 K was considered to be the removal of physical adsorbed water on the surface, the weight loss between 373 and 473 K was considered to be caused by the elimination of chemical adsorbed H2O molecules, and the weight loss between 473 and 873 K was considered to be caused by the dehydration by the condensation of silanols [37], [38], [39]. Based on this, the ratio of the weight lost between 473 and 873 K to the total weight of the catalyst was calculated as the hydroxyl groups densities in Table 2 [37]. Compared with ERB-1, the number of hydroxyl groups in D-ERB-1 after deboronation is significantly increased, which is in accordance with literature report [34]. A significant weight loss peak was found from 400 to 500 K for D-ERB-1, but no obvious weight loss peak was observed for ERB-1, MCM-36 and ITQ-2. Therefore, D-ERB-1 has more abundant hydroxyl groups. MCM-36 and ITQ-2 cause the boron atom to be removed from the framework due to the organic alkaline treatment during the swelling process, and the number of surface hydroxyl groups increased in comparison with that of ERB-1 [31], which is in accordance with the in-situ DRIFT results in Fig. 3. Compared with D-ERB-1, Ti-D-ERB-1 has less weight loss during heat treatment. TS-1 also has less weight loss during heat treatment for its hydrophobicity.

3.2. State of Cr species on catalyst
The SEM characterization of the catalyst is shown in Fig. 5. Cr/ERB-1 is composed of many small flake monomers compactly aggregated to form a granular shape, with a relatively regular surface morphology, and its surface looks rough. The size of Cr/D-ERB-1 particles is larger, and the surface morphology of the particles is relatively smooth due to corrosive action of the acid treatment on particles surface. Cr/MCM-36 appears as flake monomers agglomerated to form particles with irregular surfaces. This is due to the corrosion of the particle surface in the alkaline environment during the swelling process. Due to the swelling and ultrasonic treatment in the preparation process of Cr/ITQ-2, the delaminated monomers with MWW structure are peeled off, and then after acid treatment and calcination process, the delaminated monomers are formed into disorderly agglomerated particles.

Because the CrOx was loaded by the incipient wetness impregnation method, the EDS element surface scan can be used to investigate the loading amount of CrOx. The distribution of CrOx on the catalyst surface results is reflected in Fig. 6. The MWW zeolite supported CrOx catalyst created via the impregnation approach revealed well dispersion of CrOx. The CrOx in Cr/ERB-1, Cr/D-ERB-1, Cr/MCM-36 and Cr/ITQ-2 is highly dispersed on the surface of the particles, and there is no local agglomeration. The analysis of XPS and EDS showed that the CrOx content in Cr/ERB-1 was lower than Cr/D-ERB-1, Cr/MCM-36 and Cr/ITQ-2. The Cr/TS-1 also showed less CrOx content. In order to further evaluate the dispersion of CrOx on Cr/MMW, TEM images were obtained on ERB-1, D-ERB-1 and MCM-36, the images are shown in Fig. 7. ERB-1, D-ERB-1 and MCM-36 all show stacked layers. Due to acid or alkali treatment, the edges of D-ERB-1 and MCM-36 are smoother than ERB-1. Under 5 wt% CrOx loading, no large-size CrOx was observed on either MCM-36 with a large specific surface area or D-ERB-1 with a small specific surface area. The particle size of loaded CrOx has no difference in these samples.

The XPS spectrum of the MWW structure zeolites with a CrOx loading of 5 wt% is shown in Fig. 8. The peak fitting results of the spectrum show that the area ratio of the peak near 575.5 eV and the peak near 577.5 eV has changed significantly. The signal peak at 575.5 eV corresponds to the Cr(Ⅲ) on the catalyst surface, and the signal peak at 577.5 eV corresponds to Cr(Ⅵ) [18], [19], [40]. The Cr(Ⅵ)/Cr(Ⅲ) ratios of the CrOx loaded different MWW zeolite catalyst are displayed in Table 3. It can be obviously found that the signal peak of Cr/ERB-1 at 573–580 eV is shifted to 575 eV, while the signal peak of Cr/D-ERB-1, Cr/MCM-36 and Cr/ITQ-2 is moved towards 577.5 eV. These results mean that the Cr existed in Cr/ERB-1 is mainly with Cr(Ⅲ) form, while that in Cr/D-ERB-1, Cr/MCM-36 and Cr/ITQ-2 is in the form of Cr(Ⅵ), and the peak fitting results for the Cr(Ⅵ)/Cr(Ⅲ) ratio of the Cr loaded MWW zeolite as shown in Table 3 also confirms that Cr(Ⅵ)/Cr(Ⅲ) ratio in Cr/ERB-1 is far lower than other catalysts. Similarly, it can be seen that the CrOx in Cr-MCM-41 is mainly Cr(Ⅵ), while Cr/TS-1 is mainly Cr(Ⅲ).

The valence state analysis of 5 wt% Cr/D-ERB-1 and Cr-MCM-41 before and after the reaction was carried out by XPS characterization. As shown in Fig. 8, for Cr/D-ERB-1 before and after the reaction, it can be clearly observed that the signal peak position between 573 and 580 eV before and after the reaction changes significantly, which means that the valence state of Cr has changed during the reaction. In the catalyst before the reaction, the peak area of Cr(Ⅵ) is significantly higher than the peak area corresponding to Cr(Ⅲ). But after the reaction, the peak area corresponding to Cr(Ⅲ) increases, and the peak area of Cr(Ⅵ) decrease. These results indicate that the Cr element on the catalyst surface before beginning reaction is principally in Cr(Ⅵ) form, and the transformation of Cr(Ⅵ) to Cr(Ⅲ) occurred during the reaction. These phenomena can also be observed in Cr-MCM-41 before and after the reaction.
The state of CrOx can also be obtained from the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance measurement, and the result is shown in the Fig. 9. These samples showed two peaks at 275 and 370 nm. These two peaks are attributed to the O2-→Cr(Ⅵ) charge transfer transition of the chromate species in the tetrahedral coordination. The peaks at 468 and 605 nm are attributed to the octahedral Cr(Ⅲ) in the Cr2O3 or CrOx cluster [13], [17], [23]. The peak at 275 nm in Cr/Ti-D-ERB-1 attributable to Cr(Ⅵ) almost disappeared. This may be due to the interaction between Cr and Ti, which weakened the O2-→Cr(Ⅵ) charge transfer transition. And Compared with Cr/ERB-1, the peaks attributable to Cr(Ⅲ) in Cr/D-ERB-1 and Cr/Ti-D-ERB-1 are significantly weaker.

Fig. 10 shows the H2-TPR characterization results of the 5 wt% CrOx loaded MWW structure catalysts. All catalysts show reduction peaks, which are on account of the reduction of Cr(Ⅵ) species in catalysts [17], [18], [41]. Cr/D-ERB-1 shows two reduction peaks near 620 and 700 K, while Cr-MCM-41 and Cr/TS-1 also showed two reduction peaks near 570 and 700 K. Cr/MCM-36 shows only one reduction peak and the peak position is between 620 and 700 K. The reduction peak positions of Cr/Ti-D-ERB-1, Cr/ITQ-2 and Cr/ERB-1 are completely shifted toward 700 K. Moreover, the reduction peak signal value of Cr/ERB-1 and Cr/TS-1 are much lower than other catalysts. These results indicate that the content of Cr(Ⅵ) in Cr/D-ERB-1, Cr/MCM-36, Cr/ITQ-2 and Cr-MCM-41 is higher than that of Cr/ERB-1 and Cr/TS-1.

The effect of added titanium against the CrOx dispersion on zeolite was clarified by Laser Raman spectroscopy, and these outcomes are illustrated in Fig. 11. No obvious peaks were observed in D-ERB-1 in 500–1200 cm−1 wavelength. There were obvious peaks appeared at around 550, 600 and 980 cm−1 after CrOx loading for the sample Cr/D-ERB-1, and these peaks are all related to the state of Cr. At 550 cm−1, the peak is due to the formation of crystallized Cr2O3, at 600 cm−1; the peak is related to the interaction between the support and CrOx; at 980 cm−1, the appearance peak can be ascribed to monochromate species [23], [42]. However, after loading CrOx on Ti-D-ERB-1, the peaks at 550 cm−1 and 600 cm−1 almost disappeared, while the peak at 980 cm−1 was enhanced and a shoulder peak appeared at 1030 cm−1. The shoulder peak at 1030 cm−1 may be related to polychromate species.

3.3. Catalysts activity test
The catalytic activity of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 for different CrOx loading amount on the MCM-36 and D-ERB-1 is displayed in the Fig. 12. It can be shown that for the Cr/D-ERB-1 with the increase of CrOx amount from 3 wt%, 5 wt% to 8 wt%, the ethane conversion increased from 30% to about 50%, while the selectivity decreased from 90% to about 70%. However, for Cr/MCM-36 with the increase of CrOx amount from 5–8 wt%, the ethane conversion decreased from 48% to about 20%, while the selectivity decreased from 90% to about 80%.

Fig. 12. Effects of CrOx loading amount on the initial ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity of (a) Cr/D-ERB-1 and (b) Cr/MCM-36 catalysts.
The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 experiment was carried out on prepared catalyst with the Cr content amount of 5 wt%, and the activity results as shown in Fig. 13 and Table 4. Cr/ERB-1 showed the lower activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2. The ethane conversion was maintained at about 10%, and there is no obvious deactivation within 6 h of the reaction. Cr/D-ERB-1 showed the highest activity and stability. The initial ethane conversion was 50%, and the conversion reach stable at about 35% after 6 h of reaction. The activities of Cr/MCM-36 and Cr/ITQ-2 are very close, the initial conversion rate is 48% and 46%, and the conversion is close to 30% after 6 h deactivation, and it can be clearly observed that the stability of Cr/ITQ-2 is better than that of Cr/MCM-36. After the initial catalyst deactivation, the stable selectivity of ethylene of all catalysts is higher than 90%. The Cr/MCM-36 has lower initial methane selectivity and higher CO selectivity. For all the catalysts, the methane selectivity sequence is Cr/D-ERB-1 > Cr/ITQ-2 > Cr/MCM-36 > Cr/ERB-1. Fig. 13 also shows the activity of fresh and regenerated Cr/D-ERB-1, the deactivated catalyst can be regenerate for 10 h in a flowing air atmosphere at 873 K. The initial ethane conversion of the regenerated Cr/D-ERB-1 is about 8% lower than that of the fresh catalyst, while the selectivity of ethylene is almost same with the fresh catalyst.

The activity result at the same reaction condition of Cr-MCM-41 with 5 wt% Cr contents synthesized by one-pot method was also shown in the Fig. 13. The initial ethane conversion of hydrothermally synthesized Cr-MCM-41 was as high as 50%, and the ethylene selectivity was also approximately 90%. However, the ethane conversion of Cr-MCM-41 continued to decrease during the reaction process. The Cr-MCM-41 conversion dropped by 30% within 4 h of reaction, and after deactivation the ethane conversion was only 20%. After regeneration of Cr-MCM-41, the initial conversion rate of ethane was only 20%, and the selectivity of ethylene was about 90%, as shown in Fig. 13. It can be observed that the Cr-MCM-41 catalytic activity cannot be recovered after the same regeneration conditions of Cr/D-ERB-1. The initial ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity of the one-pot synthesized Cr-MCM-41 showed are consistent with the results of other reported silica supported CrOx-based catalysts: CrOx/SiO2 [9], CrOx/ZSM-5 [12], CrOx /SBA-15 [13].
The comparison results oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 activity of 5 wt% CrOx loaded titanosilicate Ti-D-ERB-1 and TS-1 were shown in Fig. 14. In the initial stage of the reaction, 5 wt% Cr/Ti-D-ERB-1 shows higher activity with 45% ethane conversion and 40% ethylene yield than that of 25% ethane conversion and 25% ethylene yield for hydrophobic zeolite 5 wt% Cr/TS-1. All these two catalysts show deactivation with ethane conversion gradually decrease about 10% during the 6 h reaction.

The ethane dehydrogenation activity of 5 wt% Cr/D-ERB-1 without CO2 is shown in Fig. S3. The temperature and total space-velocity remain unchanged, C2H6: N2 = 1: 9. The initial conversion of ethane without CO2 is almost same as that in the presence of CO2, but the ethylene selectivity is lower. However, the catalyst is rapidly deactivated. After 90 min of reaction, the catalyst is calcined at 700 °C for 1 h in the mixed gas (CO2: N2 = 3: 7), and the activity of the catalyst can be restored. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide on a 5 wt% Cr/D-ERB-1 catalyst was also studied by changing the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the CO2/C2H6 ratio. The results are shown in Fig. S4 (reaction conditions: T = 700 ℃, GHSV=3000 mL·g−1·h−1). When the GHSV is reduced, the conversion rate of ethane increases, the selectivity of ethylene decreases, and the stability of the catalyst also increases. With the increase of the CO2/C2H6 ratio from 1 to 5 at the same GHSV, the conversion of ethane is almost unchanged, while the selectivity of ethylene increased obviously. When the CO2/C2H6 ratio was continuously increased to 9, the conversion rate of ethane remained basically unchanged, and the selectivity of ethylene increased slightly.
4. Discussion
4.1. Effect of hydroxyl group of MWW zeolite on the dispersion of Cr species and catalytic activity
From the characterization results of XRD in Fig. 1 and SEM in Fig. 5, it can be seen that the structure of MWW phase still exists after D-ERB-1, MCM-36 and ITQ-2 are prepared with ERB-1 as the precursor. The structure of the zeolite supports does not change after loading CrOx, while after the delamination, pillaring or deboronation post-treatment and atom-planting loading of Ti, it can be seen that the characterized diffraction peaks of MWW structure after Cr2O3 loading are weakened. The N2 adsorption results in Fig. 2 proved the existence of mesoporous structure in MCM-36.
The In-situ IR results in Fig. 3 and TG results in Fig. 4 also showed that the number of hydroxyl groups on the modified MWW zeolite increased with the acid or organic alkaline treatment for the synthesis of D-ERB-1, MCM-36, and ITQ-2. This was attributed to the fact that the acid treatment or organic alkaline swelling treatment of ERB-1(P) would remove boron atoms from the zeolite framework, resulting in the formation of zeolite framework defects and hydroxyl groups. The Si/B ratio in Table 1 and the quantitative data of the hydroxyl group in Table 2 prove that the boron has been removed and hydroxyl groups have been generated during the acid treatment and alkaline swelling treatment. Moreover, compared with MCM-36, D-ERB-1 and ITQ-2 have more abundant hydroxyl groups according to the TG results in Fig. 4 and Table 2. For the preparation of MCM-36, SiO2 pillars were generated through the dehydration and condensation of TEOS dissolved in the swelling CTMABr of the interlayer with the hydroxyl groups on the external surface of the layer. During this process, the external hydroxyl groups of the deboroned ERB-1 were consumed, which resulted in it only retaining a smaller number of hydroxyl groups than that of ITQ-2 and D-ERB-1. The weight loss of Ti-D-ERB-1 is less than that of D-ERB-1 because the Ti species occupies part of the hydroxyl group. Due to TS-1 is highly hydrophobic, the number of hydroxyl groups is small, and the weight loss is also small.
The EDS elemental mapping results in Fig. 6 and TEM in Fig. 7 show that CrOx has a well dispersion state on the surface of the MWW structure catalyst. In the case of 5 wt% CrOx loadings, the difference in specific surface area of different MWW samples has no significant effect on the dispersion of CrOx in the external surface. It can be seen from Fig. S2 that compared with the sample without CrOx, the hydroxyl peak on the CrOx-loaded sample almost disappears, which indicates that CrOx is anchored to the support by consumption of the hydroxyl group. However, the Cr content on the surface of Cr/ERB-1 detected by the XPS and EDS analysis is lower than D-ERB-1, ITQ-2, and MCM-36, as shown in Table 1. This may be due to the less hydroxyl group of ERB-1, which caused lower loading amount of CrOx. While the increased number of hydroxyl groups on D-ERB-1, MCM-36, and ITQ-2 enhance the loading amount of CrOx. And with the increase of the number of hydroxyl groups, the loading of CrOx also increases. The H2-TPR in Fig. 10 also confirms this result. ERB-1 has the least number of hydroxyl groups, and the reduction peak of Cr/ERB-1 is also the weakest. The increase in the number of hydroxyl groups on D-ERB-1, MCM-36, and ITQ-2 corresponds to the increase in the reduction peak intensity of CrOx-loaded samples.
For the comparison of ethane carbon dioxide oxidative dehydrogenation activity of same 5 wt% CrOx loading amount in different MWW structure zeolite in Fig. 13. ERB-1, which has the lowest number of hydroxyl groups, exhibits the worst initial activity. Cr/D-ERB-1, which has the largest number of hydroxyl groups, exhibits the highest initial activity. Cr/MCM-36 and Cr/ITQ-2 also show similar catalytic properties with Cr/D-ERB-1. Although the specific surface area of Cr/D-ERB-1 is not the highest, its abundant hydroxyl groups enable D-ERB-1 to load and disperse more CrOx. Therefore, with the increased CrOx loading amount from the 3 wt%, 5–8 wt% in the D-ERB-1, the ethane conversion increased simultaneously. Although Cr/MCM-36 has the largest specific surface area due to its mesoporous structure, with the CrOx loading amount increased from 5 wt to 8 wt%, the ethane conversion of Cr/MCM-36 decreased obviously. The less amount of hydroxyl group in the MCM-36 prohibited it to loading more amount of CrOx as the active site for ethane conversion. With the increased loading amount of CrOx, the ethylene selectivity declined, with the increased CO selectivity according to the over-oxidization of ethane. It can be seen from Fig. 13 that Cr/MWW has good activity, excellent stability and regeneration ability in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. This may be because the unique 12 MR half-cup structure on the surface of the MWW structure limits the size of the CrOx and the possible agglomeration during the reaction. The abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface of the MWW structure anchor the dispersed CrOx and further restrict the agglomeration of CrOx.
4.2. Effect of chromium species on reactivity
Fig. 8 and Table 3 show that there are significant differences in the ratio of Cr(Ⅵ)/Cr(Ⅲ) on zeolite supports. Cr/ERB-1 with a small number of hydroxyl groups is dominated by Cr(Ⅲ), while D-ERB-1, ITQ-2, MCM-36 with a large number of hydroxyl groups is dominated by Cr(Ⅵ). UV-Vis results are consistent with the XPS results, which shows that chromium exists in the form of Cr(Ⅵ) and Cr(Ⅲ). The hydroxyl groups on the zeolite are beneficial to the formation of Cr(Ⅵ). It was confirmed that the hydroxyl group is in favor to grasp the Cr(Ⅵ). The H2-TPR results in Fig. 10 show that the different framework structure of zeolite also affects Cr(Ⅵ) species. Cr/D-ERB-1 showed two reduction peaks near 620 K and 700 K, indicating that Cr(Ⅵ) can be formed on the surface of the support and inside the pores. The reduction peak of Cr/MCM-36 shifted to 700 K, which may be due to the pillared structure that exposed the interlayer framework of the zeolites, and a large number of Cr(Ⅵ) interacted with the framework of zeolite. The reduction peak position of Cr/ITQ-2 is completely shifted towards 700 K. This can be attributed to its delamination structure which leads to greater exposure of the framework of zeolite, and most of the Cr(Ⅵ) are directly combined with the framework. The exposure degree of the zeolite framework increases and the reduction temperature of CrOx also increases, which means that increasing the exposure degree of the zeolite framework can enhance the combination of CrOx and the carrier.
Table 4 shows the conversion and product selectivity at the initial of the reaction and after 6 h. The activity of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 of Cr/D-ERB-1, Cr/MCM-36 and Cr/ITQ-2 is much higher than that of Cr/ERB-1, and the order of activity is consistent with the order of Cr(Ⅵ)/Cr(Ⅲ) ratio shown in Table 3, which means that Cr(Ⅵ) plays an important role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2. The activity of Cr/D-ERB-1 basically reached stable after 5 h of reaction. Fig. 8 and Table 3 also show that the ratio of the catalyst Cr(Ⅵ)/Cr(Ⅲ) after the reaction is significantly reduced, which indicates that Cr(Ⅵ) is converted into Cr(Ⅲ) during the reaction. The transition of Cr(Ⅵ) to Cr(Ⅲ) is one of the important reasons for deactivation. Moreover, the activity of the catalyst was almost restored after regeneration, which means that the loaded CrOx can be regenerated after O2 calcination. The results in Fig. 14 show that the activity of the deactivated Cr/D-ERB-1 catalyst during the direct dehydrogenation can also be restored under the regeneration of CO2, which shows that CO2 not only promotes the reaction through RWSG (reverse water gas shift) reaction but also acts as an oxidant during the reaction to regenerate the catalyst by bouduoard reaction. Compared with the direct dehydrogenation of ethane, the catalyst showed better ethylene selectivity and stability in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2. From Fig. S4, it can be seen that the change in the ratio of CO2/C2H6 has a great impact on the reaction. Increasing the ratio of CO2/C2H6 will significantly increase the selectivity of ethylene. After the CO2/C2H6 ratio is 5, the CO2/C2H6 ratio is further increased, and the ethane conversion rate and ethylene selectivity remain basically unchanged.
In Fig. 10 for the H2-TPR, Cr-MCM-41 also showed two reduction peaks at 550 K and 700 K, which indicates that Cr species do not fully incorporate into the zeolite framework during the synthesis process. The XPS results in Fig. 8 and Table 3 show that CrOx in Cr-MCM-41 mainly exists in the form of Cr(Ⅵ). The synthesized Cr-MCM-41 in which the Cr species was fixed on the molecular sieve framework was applied to the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2, and the effects of different Cr species on the activity were compared. It can be seen from Fig. 13 that although the Cr-MCM-41 has almost similar initial ethane conversion and ethane selectivity as the Cr/D-ERB-1, its activity continued to decrease during the reaction, and the activity of the catalyst cannot be recovered after O2 regeneration. It shows that the Cr species in the framework of the Cr-MCM-41 has a certain activity to catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2, but it is difficult to regenerate the Cr species in the framework after being reduced. The large number of hydroxyl groups on D-ERB-1 not only makes CrOx uniformly dispersed on the surface of the support in the form of chromate but also improves the oxidative-reductive cycle of chromate during the catalysis process with the comparison with Cr species fixed in the framework of MCM-41 and crystalline Cr2O3. Therefore, the hydroxyl group in the modified ERB-1 zeolite not only can anchor the CrOx, but also can promote the regeneration of the Cr(Ⅵ) active site for dehydrogenation.
4.3. Effect of titanium species on the catalytic stability
The H2-TPR results in Fig. 10 show that the reduction peak of Cr/Ti-D-ERB-1 is higher than that of Cr/D-ERB-1. This means that after Ti doping, the amount of reducible CrOx is increased. The increase in the ratio of Cr(Ⅵ)/Cr(Ⅲ) in Table 3 also proves this result. In addition, Cr/D-ERB-1 shows a strong reduction peak near 620 K, while the reduction peak of Cr/Ti-D-ERB-1 shifts to 700 K, which indicates that there is an interaction between TiOx and CrOx. The UV-Vis results in Fig. 9 show that the charge transfer transition of O2-→Cr(VI) is weakened in Cr/Ti-D-ERB-1, which also proves that there is an interaction between Cr and Ti. It can be seen in Fig. 10 that the reduction peak signal of Cr/TS-1 is much weaker than that of Cr/Ti-ERB-1, which is consistent with the XPS results in Fig. 8 and Table 3, indicating that low content of Cr(Ⅵ) in Cr/TS-1. The TG results also show that the TS-1 is hydrophobic and has fewer hydroxyl groups. Therefore, it can be concluded that even though there is a lot of titanium on the carrier, it still cannot catch too much CrOx when there are fewer hydroxyl groups. The amount of Cr(VI) increases with the increase of hydroxyl groups on the carrier.
The titanium species was loaded on D-ERB-1 by atom-planting method. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that the loaded titanium atoms occupy part of the hydroxyl nests and silanol positions, especially the hydroxyl nests inside the zeolite at 3420–3620 cm−1. It can be seen from Fig. 11 that the introduced Ti can promote the CrOx better dispersed on Ti-D-ERB-1, and Cr2O3 is almost invisible. It can be seen from Fig. 14 that with 5 wt% CrOx loading amounts, the initial ethane conversion of Cr/Ti-D-ERB-1 decreased by 4% compared with Cr/D-ERB-1, and the selectivity of ethylene was almost the same. However, the deactivation rate of Cr/Ti-D-ERB-1 is significantly slower than that of Cr/D-ERB-1. After 6 h reaction, the ethane conversion of Cr/D-ERB-1 decreased by 15%, and that of Cr/Ti-D-ERB-1 decreased by only 9%. This shows that the addition of titanium can improve the stability of Cr/D-ERB-1 during the reaction. The addition of Ti enhances the dispersion of CrOx on the surface of D-ERB-1, and the interaction between Ti and Cr makes crystalline Cr2O3 transformed into polymeric chromate. Compared with crystalline Cr2O3, polymeric chromate is easier for the redox based cycle during the reaction, which makes the catalyst more stable during the reaction. It has been reported that the promotion of Ti is believed to be due to the formation of Cr-O-Ti-O-Si bridge bonds, but in the FT-IR spectrum, the Cr-O vibration of the Cr(VI) species (near 905 cm−1) overlaps with the vibration of the Si-O-Si bond (asymmetric vibration 1090 cm−1, symmetric vibration 810 cm−1), which makes Cr-O vibration is difficult to observed in Cr-silica samples [35], [43].
Moreover, as comparison shown in Fig. 14, Cr/TS-1 exhibits poor activity and rapid deactivation in the reaction. Therefore, it was proposed that the hydrophilic property of Ti-D-ERB-1 compared with the hydrophobic zeolite TS-1 enhanced the activity and stability of CrOx loaded on the MWW zeolite. The presence of surface hydroxyl groups is critical to the activity of CrOx-based catalysts during the reaction.
5. Conclusions
The borosilicate zeolite ERB-1 with MWW topological structure was subjected to acid treatment, swelling-pillaring and swelling-ultrasonic-acid treatment to prepare deboroned MWW zeolite D-ERB-1, SiO2 pillared micropore and mesopore composite MCM-36 and interlayer delaminated ITQ-2 with disorderly stacking. Ti-D-ERB-1 was synthesized by TiCl4 atom-planting method. Furthermore, the Cr/MWW and Cr/TS-1 was produced via the incipient impregnation approach. Cr-MCM-41 was prepared by the one-pot method. The role of hydroxyl, chromium species and titanium species in the oxidative dehydrogenation of carbon dioxide from ethane was explored.
The results show that CrOx is supported on the carrier by occupying the position of the hydroxyl group. Compared with ERB-1, the number of hydroxyl groups on D-ERB-1, MCM-36 and ITQ-2 increases, the content of CrOx increase, and the ratio of Cr(Ⅵ)/Cr(Ⅲ) also increases. The H2-TPR results show that as the exposure of the framework increases, the reduction temperature of Cr increases, and the combination of CrOx and the carrier becomes stronger. In Cr/MWW with Cr(Ⅵ) species high content, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide also exhibited high activity. The decrease of Cr(Ⅵ) species content after reaction also confirmed that Cr(Ⅵ) is the active center of reaction. In contrast to Cr-MCM-41, the activity of Cr/D-ERB-1 is basically restored after regeneration, which indicates that the Cr(Ⅵ) anchor by hydroxyl group of modified MWW zeolite is easy to regenerate. At the same time, the introduction of titanium makes the Cr2O3 on the MWW zeolite transformed into easily reducible polymeric chromate, which improves the stability of the catalyst. Compared with the hydrophobic zeolite TS-1, Ti-D-ERB-1 has a hydrophilic hydroxyl group, which can capture more CrOx and show better ethane conversion activity. Therefore, increasing the number of hydroxyl groups on the carrier as well as introducing titanium into the carrier can effectively improve the loading of CrOx and the amount of active Cr(Ⅵ) species, thereby increasing the activity of the CrOx-based catalyst in the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. The results also show that CO2 can regenerate the deactivated catalyst and increase the CO2/C2H6 ratio can effectively increase the selectivity of ethylene in the product.

Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
