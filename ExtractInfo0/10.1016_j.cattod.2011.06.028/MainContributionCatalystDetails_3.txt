The document does not pertain to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically. It discusses the decomposition of dichloromethane and the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, but does not focus on converting propane to propylene. Therefore, I have indicated that the document is not relevant to the propane dehydrogenation processes of interest.
