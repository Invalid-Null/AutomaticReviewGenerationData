Based on my analysis, the supplied document does not pertain to propane dehydrogenation, including Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) or Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically for converting propane to propylene. The document discusses the decomposition of dichloromethane and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, but does not focus on PDH or ODH for propane to propylene conversion.
