Restructuring effects of Pt and Fe in Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts and their enhancement of propane dehydrogenation
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) over Pt-based catalysts has drawn particular attention as a propene on-purpose production technology. The addition of a promoter and the dispersion of Pt have significant effects on catalytic performance. Herein, Fe-doped dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (Fe-DMSN) supported Pt catalysts were developed, which show high catalytic activity and selectivity for PDH. We found that the reduction process induces redispersion rather than agglomeration of Pt, which is favorable for PDH reaction. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and Raman spectra revealed that the restructuring of Fe from aggregated FeOx species to isolated Fe3+ species occurred during the loading of Pt onto the Fe-DMSN supports as a resulting of the interaction between Pt and Fe. The stable isolated Fe3+ species promotes Pt redispersion during the reduction process, which results in a strong metal (Pt)–support (Fe-DMSN) interaction. A high catalytic activity for PDH, even during a 60 h long-term test, was obtained on Pt/0.4Fe-DMSN because of the strong interaction between the isolated Fe species and Pt species.
1. Introduction
As one of the most important basic chemicals, propene is traditionally obtained as by-product from petroleum-based processes such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking [1], [2]. Because of the growing demand for propene and the discovery of large reserves of shale gas, PDH has drawn particular attention as a propene on-purpose production technology [3]. However, the PDH reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which implies that a high reaction temperature and/or low pressure are needed to achieve high rates of propane conversion. Pt-based catalysts are widely used in the PDH reaction due to their superior activation of the propane C–H bond and low activity for C–C cleavage [4], [5], [6], [7]. However, catalyst deactivation caused by sintering of Pt and coke deposition remains one of the biggest issues for Pt-based catalysts [8], [9]. One strategy to improve catalytic stability is to add a second metal. Sn is the promoter most studied in Pt-based catalysts for PDH reaction [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. The addition of Sn can modify the Pt active phase, which is explained mainly by geometric and electronic effects [1]. Other metals, such as In, Ga, Mn, Ge, Cu and Zn have also been studied as promoters of Pt in the PDH reaction [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Moreover, the support of a catalyst also play a vital role in affecting the dispersion and distribution of Pt on the catalyst, which is related to the strong interaction between the metal and the support. This strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) is often observed on reducible oxide supports (e.g. TiO2, CeO2) [26]. However, most of the supports used in the PDH reaction are irreducible supports (e.g. Al2O3, SiO2, zeolites). The SMSI on the Al2O3 supported catalysts can be generated by the formation of coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ centres [27], [28], [29]. In addition, the SMSI on zeolites-supported catalysts can be generated by encapsulating the metals in zeolites or creating lattice defects in zeolites [30], [31]. Compared with Al2O3 and zeolites, SiO2 is much more inert. Deng et al. have reported the SMSI between Pt and SiO2 generated by high-temperature reduction (> 773 K) [32]. In order to obtain the SMSI on SiO2 supported catalysts at lower temperatures, the modification of SiO2 may be achieved [33]. The aim of these strategies was mainly to obtain highly dispersed and stable Pt active sites, which is favorable for high activity and stability. Indeed, the dispersion of Pt particles changes with supports, synthesis process and reaction conditions. Redispersion of particles into clusters and single atoms has attracted scientific interest because of the opportunity to maximize the dispersion of active sites [34]. One of the most common approaches used to induce redispersion employs using cycles of oxidation and reduction. In most cases, oxidation results in redispersion and reduction results in agglomeration. It has been demonstrated that the strong interactions between Pt and different supports is the reason for the redispersion process [35], [36]. However, due to the chemical inertness of the SiO2 support, the anchorage to Pt metal is weak. To overcome this problem, modifying the silica by incorporating various metal species is considered to be a potential method. As the most earth-abundant and non-toxic transition metal, Fe is of special interest as a promoter of bimetallic Pt-based catalysts for PDH, but it has been studied less extensively compared to post-transition metal Sn. Moreover, Fe species have the ability to anchor Pt metal particles, thus preventing active metal clusters from forming highly mobile and agglomerations [37], [38], [39]. Thus, the development and mechanistic understanding of Fe-promoted Pt-based catalysts with increased stability has become an intense field of research. In this contribution, we developed a series of Fe-doped dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (Fe-DMSN) supported Pt catalysts. Interestingly, we found the redispersion rather than agglomeration of Pt happened during the reduction process. And this redispersion of Pt may be caused by the restructure of aggregated Fe species to isolated Fe3+ species on DMSN support due to the interaction between Pt and Fe. And the stable isolated Fe3+ species promotes the redispersion of Pt during the reduced process, which results in the strong metal (Pt)-support (Fe-DMSN) interaction. The Pt/0.4Fe-DMSN catalyst shows the highest propane dehydrogenation performance because of the strong interaction between stable isolated Fe species and Pt species.

Pt/xFe-DMSN catalysts were synthesized using H2PtCl6·6H2O as precursor by incipient-wetness impregnation method. The loading of Pt was 0.5 wt%. For comparison, PtSn/DMSN catalyst was also prepared by the same method with the loadings of Pt and Sn of 0.5 and 0.4 wt%, respectively.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were carried out on a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 instrument. XRD patterns were recorded on an Ultima Ⅳ X−ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with a Nickel filter operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a Hitachi SU8010 field emission scanning electron microscope. Samples were coated with gold by ion sputtering before SEM analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization was taken on a FEI TECNAI F20 (200 kV) transmission electron microscope. The samples were suspended in ethanol and sonicated for 10 min. And then drip on a copper grid coated with carbon. The UV−Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV−Vis DRS) spectra were carried out on a Hitachi UH4150 equipped with the integration sphere diffuse reflectance attachment at 200–800 nm. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurements were performed on an Agilent 7900. Raman spectra were performed on a LabRam HR Evolution with a 266 nm laser. H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out in a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920. Catalyst of 100 mg was loaded in a quartz and heated to 300 °C under Ar atmosphere (30 mL min−1) and maintained for 1 h. After cooled to 50 °C, the gas was changed to 10% H2/Ar flow with 40 mL min−1. And the catalyst was heated from 50 to 850 ℃ at a rate of 10 °C min−1 H2O and CO2 in outlet gases were removed by a cooling trap and a filter packed with 5 A molecular sieve. The H2 consumption signal was recorded by a TCD on line. The amount of coke deposited was determined by a NETZSCH STA 449 F5 thermogravimetric (TG) analyzer. The samples were exposed to 20% O2/N2 flowing and oxidized from ambient temperature to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1.
2.4. Catalytic activity test
PDH reaction was carried out in a conventional quartz tubular micro−reactor. The catalyst of 0.2 g was placed into the center of the reactor and reduced under 10% H2/Ar at 500 °C for 4 h. Subsequently, the gas mixture of C3H8 and N2 with molar ratio of 1:2 was fed to the reactor with the propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 2.4 h−1 and the reaction temperature was raised to 590 °C and maintained at 590 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by using an online Agilent-7890B gas chromatography equipped with a HP-Al2O3 capillary column for the separation of CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and C3H8. The conversion of propane and the selectivity for propene were defined as follows:
where i represented all the product molecules containing carbon atoms in the reaction products, ni was the number of carbon atoms of product i and Ci was its molar composition.
The deactivation rate constant kd was used to evaluate the stability of a catalyst:
Where Xinitial and Xfinal represents the propane conversion at the initial and final of an experiment, respectively. And t (h) represent the duration of PDH reaction.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Catalytic performance
The catalytic performances of Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts for PDH are shown in Fig. 1. For comparison, the catalytic performances of the 0.4Fe-DMSN support and the PtSn/DMSN catalyst for PDH were also tested. The results clearly demonstrate that the 0.4Fe-DMSN support was almost inactive. Moreover, the selectivity to propene of the 0.4Fe-DMSN support was only 56.1%, that is, it is nonselective to propene. For the PtSn/DMSN catalyst, it achieved 49.6% and 36.8% propane conversion for the initial and 6 h reactions, respectively. Moreover, the deactivation rate constant of 0.087 h−1 indicated a relatively fast deactivation. For the Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts, as shown in Fig. 1A and listed in Table 2, the initial propane conversion were greater than 50%, except for the Pt/2Fe-DMSN catalysts, which had an initial conversion of 46.3%. In particular, the Pt/0.4Fe-DMSN catalyst had an initial propane conversion of 57.6%. After 6 h of the reaction, the conversion of propane on the Pt/0.4Fe-DMSN catalyst remained at 51.1%, while other catalysts had conversion below 50%. Unlike other catalysts, the Pt/2Fe-DMSN catalyst showed an increase in propane conversion during the first hour of reaction, followed by a gradual decrease with reaction time. The increase in propane conversion at the beginning of the dehydrogenation process may have been caused by the further reduction of FexOy species. As shown in Fig. 1B and listed in Table 2, the initial selectivity of propene decreased with the level of Fe dopings, giving the lowest initial selectivity of 73.0% on Pt/2Fe-DMSN. The selectivity to propene showed a gradual increase with reaction time to approach the steady-state values. According to the catalytic test results, Pt/0.4Fe-DMSN gave the highest propane conversion and considerable propene selectivity. Therefore, the stability of the Pt/0.4Fe-DMSN catalyst was further investigated for a 60 h PDH reaction (Fig. 1C) and its behavior was compared with the PtSn/DMSN catalyst. After 60 h reaction time, the propane conversion and yield of propene were 37.8% and 36.8%, respectively, on Pt/0.4Fe-DMSN, while those on PtSn/DMSN were only 14.4% and 14.0%, respectively. The obvious difference in propane conversion after 60 h indicates the better long-term stability of the Pt/0.4 Fe-DMSN catalyst compared with the PtSn/DMSN catalyst. In general, doping with Fe enhanced the activity and stability of Pt/DMSN catalysts for PDH. In addition, different levels of Fe doping results in different levels of catalytic performance. Therefore, the effects of different Fe contents on the catalyst structure, the distribution of metallic particles and the metal-support interaction all need to be investigated further.

3.2. Textural and morphological properties
The morphology of the catalysts plays an important role in the catalytic reaction. SEM characterization was carried out, and the resulting images are shown in Fig. 2. All of the samples were monodispersed nanospheres with rough outside surfaces. We can see that all of the catalysts exhibited similar nanosphere morphology. The results show that a low Fe content scarcely changed the physical structure of the catalysts. N2 adsorption–desorption measurements also demonstrated similar pore structure characteristics. Fig. 3 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of the Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts, and the corresponding textural properties of the samples are presented in Table 3. All of the samples exhibited a type IV isotherm, indicating the existence of mesoporous structures. Two distinct capillary condensation steps can be clearly seen at P/P0 values of approximately 0.4 and 0.85, which resulted in the formation of two hysteresis loops, suggesting that the catalysts had bimodal porosity [40]. The pore size distribution obtained from the adsorption branch using the BJH method showed one peak at about 2 nm and another shoulder peak below 10 nm. The average pore diameter (Table 3) of all catalysts was between 3.5 and 4.0 nm. Moreover, all of the catalysts possessed a high BET surface area (> 1000 m2 g−1) and pore volume (> 0.8 m3 g−1). According to the SEM and N2 adsorption–desorption results, the catalysts with different levels of Fe doping showed similar textural and morphological properties.

3.3. Phase structure, dispersion and chemical properties
The true levels of Fe doping of the Fe-DMSN supports were obtained by ICP-MS, and the corresponding results are listed in Table 1. The Fe content in the Fe-DMSN supports increased with increasing quantities of Fe precursor in the recipe, indicating that the efficiency of in situ synthesis on the quantities of Fe doping was close to the theoretical value.
In order to gain insight into the effect of Fe doping on the catalysts, XRD measurements were carried out and the XRD patterns of the Fe-DMSN supports, along with the calcined and reduced Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts, are shown in Fig. 4. For the Fe-DMSN supports, all of the patterns showed abroad maximum of 23° at 2θ, which is the peak typical of amorphous silica. The absence of diffraction peaks ascribed to FexOy indicates the high dispersion of FexOy species or the formation of amorphous FexOy phases. Fig. 4B shows the XRD patterns of the calcined Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts. In addition to the characteristic patterns of silica, the reflection peaks at 2θ of 39.8°, 46.2°, 67.4° and 81.4° were attributed to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) inter-planar spaces of the Pt metal, respectively. This indicated the formation of crystalline Pt. The peak intensity decreased only on the Pt/2Fe-DMSN catalyst, which indicated that the Fe modification of the silica may be favorable for the dispersion of Pt. By comparing the XRD patterns of the calcined and reduced samples, an interesting phenomenon was observed, where the intensity of the diffraction peak at 39.8° decreased on the reduced Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts but not on the Pt/DMSN catalysts. This phenomenon suggests that the strong interaction between Pt and the Fe-DMSN support makes the Pt redispersed during the reduction process, the extent of which increased with increasing levels of Fe doping. The absence of Pt redispersion on the Pt/DMSN catalyst illustrates how the doping of Fe species on the DMSN support plays an important role in this procedure. Fig. 5 shows the STEM images of calcined and reduced Pt/0.4Fe-DMSN catalysts. It can be seen that both the calcined and reduced catalysts shows the highly dispersed nanoparticles on the Pt/0.4Fe-DMSN catalyst.

In order to further investigate the interaction between Pt and the Fe species, UV-Vis DRS was used to characterize the coordination state of the Fe species. For comparison, both the Fe-DMSN supports and the calcined Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts were characterized, and the results are shown in Fig. 6. For the Fe-DMSN supports, the band centred at approximately 250 nm was ascribed to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (O2−→Fe3+) between the oxygen p orbitals and the iron d electrons of the isolated 4-coordinated Fe3+ in tetrahedral [FeO4]− [41]. The presence of this band indicated the formation of isolated 4-coordinated Fe3+ in the silica framework, which confirmed that some Fe species entered into the silica framework during the in situ synthesis. For the 0.8Fe-DMSN and 2Fe-DMSN supports, the spectra are dominated by an intense band in addition to the isomorphic substitution of silicon atoms by iron atoms, and these strong bands were also assigned to extra-framework Fe oligomer or to aggregated iron oxide clusters [42], [43]. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the intensity of the band in the range 350–650 nm increased with increasing levels of Fe doping, which indicated the aggregation of Fe species on the highly doped supports (0.8Fe-DMSN and 2Fe-DMSN). After loading Pt onto the Fe-DMSN supports, all of the spectra showed an intense band at 250 nm, and the band at 350–650 nm almost disappeared on the 0.2Fe-DMSN and 0.4Fe-DMSN supports. This phenomenon indicated the transformation of the iron oligomer or aggregated iron oxide clusters to isolated Fe species and resulted in the restructuring and redispersion of Fe species during Pt loading procedure.

Fig. 7 shows the Raman spectra of the Fe-DMSN supports and of the calcined and reduced Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts in the 400–1400 cm−1 range. For the DMSN sample shown in Fig. 7A, the bands at 494 and 610 cm−1 were assigned to symmetric O−Si−O motions and breathing motions of the SiO4 tetrahedra, respectively [44], [45]. It can be seen from Fig. 7F that the Raman spectra of the Fe-DMSN supports are similar to that of the DMSN sample. The Raman spectra of the calcined and reduced Pt/DMSN are similar to that of the DMSN support (Fig. 7A). However, the spectra show obvious changes on the Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts, as shown in Fig. 7B−E. The band at 1090 cm−1 was assigned to the Fe−O−Si asymmetric stretching mode of isolated tetrahedral Fe ions in the silica framework, while the band at 1149 cm−1 was assigned to the extra-framework octahedrally coordinated Fe species [46]. Moreover, the band at 494 cm−1 in the Pt/DMSN sample shifted to 503 cm−1 in the Pt/Fe-DMSN samples due to the formation of a symmetric Fe−O−Si stretching mode of isolated tetrahedral Fe ions in silica framework [47]. The intense bands at 1090 and 1149 cm−1 on the calcined Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts indicated the formation of isolated Fe species during the Pt loading procedure, which accord with the UV-Vis DRS results. Combining the UV-Vis DRS and Raman results, it can be concluded that the restructuring and redispersion of Fe may have been the result of the interaction of the Pt and Fe species on the Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts. Moreover, an SMSI occurred on Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts. Following the reduction of the Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts, the Raman spectra (Fig. 7B–E) appeared similar to that of the calcined Pt/Fe-DMSN catalyst, indicating the species in the reduced Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts similar to that of the calcined samples. This indicates the restructuring and redispersion of the Fe species was the result of the Pt species and not of the treatment conditions. In order to investigate the state of iron, XPS characterization was carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that the calcined samples with the characteristic peak at 711.6 eV was attributed to Fe3+ [48]. Although the signals of Fe 2p XPS were very weak on the reduced Pt/0.2Fe-DMSN, Pt/0.4Fe-DMSN and Pt/0.8Fe-DMSN catalysts, the characteristic peak of reduced Pt/2Fe-DMSN catalyst at about 711.4 eV indicated the existence of Fe3+. This is in accordance with the Raman results.

In order to study the interaction between Fe and Pt on the catalysts, H2-TPR measurements were carried out, and the corresponding profiles of the Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 9. For the Pt/0.2Fe-DMSN and Pt/0.4Fe-DMSN catalysts, there was almost no oxidation state of the Pt species on the catalysts. The peak in region II of the Pt/0.2Fe-DMSN and Pt/0.4Fe-DMSN catalysts was assigned to the reduction of Fe species. For the Pt/0.8Fe-DMSN and Pt/2Fe-DMSN catalysts, however, reduction of the Pt-O-Fe species occurred in the low temperature region I. Moreover, reduction of the Fe species on the Pt/2Fe-DMSN catalyst occurred in temperature region III, but in region II for the other catalysts. It can be seen that the reduction temperature of Fe species in region II moved to lower temperature due to the interaction of Pt and Fe species, as suggested by the XRD, UV-Vis DRS and Raman results.

3.4. Fe and Pt redispersion and its effect on catalytic performance
In the PDH reaction, the promoting effect of promoter, for example, Sn on Pt-based catalysts is due mainly to electronic and geometric effects [49], [50], [51]. The electronic effect causes the promoter to transfer electrons to Pt so as to weaken the propene–Pt interaction. The geometric effect of the promoter acts mainly to help increase the dispersion of Pt. In this study, the doping of Fe in the DMSN support improved the dispersion of Pt. According to the characterization results, for the 0.2Fe-DMSN and 0.4Fe-DMSN supports, most of the Fe species existed in an isolated and highly dispersed form, and only some of the Fe species existed in an aggregated iron oxides (Fig. 6A, B). For the 0.8Fe-DMSN and 2Fe-DMSN supports, however, most of the Fe species existed as aggregated iron oxides, while only some of the Fe species existed in an isolated and highly dispersed form (Fig. 6C, D). By comparing the Fe-DMSN supports to the Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7B–E, it can be seen that some aggregated iron oxide species transferred to the isolated and highly dispersed Fe species after Pt was loaded onto the Fe-DMSN supports. This process did not occur during the reduction, as shown in Fig. 7B–E, indicating that the reason for the redispersion of Fe was due mainly to the strong interaction between Pt and Fe. This interaction promoted Pt redispersion during the reduction process, which can be demonstrated by the fact that no redispersion occurred in the absence of Fe (Fig. 4B, C). The reducible oxide supported Pt catalysts usually shows strong metal-support interaction, which results in the highly dispersed Pt species. In particular, the oxides of reducible metal ions, such as Ce4+, Fe3+ and Ti4+ are widely used to stabilize highly dispersed metal species even single metal atoms [52]. However, the deoxygenation process at high temperature or reduction process may result in the reduction of metal ions to metals and make the reducible metal oxides unstable. This will lead to the aggregation of supported metal species. In this work, Fe3+ are dispersed and confined in the silica support, which makes it stable even in the reduction process. And the stable Fe3+ species promotes the dispersion of Pt species. In short, as shown in Fig. 10, the loading of Pt onto the Fe-DMSN supports promoted the redispersion of Fe, which in turn promoted the redispersion of Pt during the reduction process as a result of the strong interaction between Pt and Fe. This may also have resulted in a strong metal (Pt)–support (Fe-DMSN) interaction. PDH activity and stability on the Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts were enhanced compared with that on the PtSn/DMSN catalyst, which may have been caused by SMSI.

The differences in the PDH performance on the Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts with different levels of Fe doping indicated that the presence of interaction between the metal (Pt) and the support (Fe-DMSN) varied considerably. For the low-level Fe-doped catalyst (Pt/0.2Fe-DMSN), although the Fe species existed in the form of isolated Fe species (Fig. 6), the interaction between Pt and Fe-DMSN was insufficient. For the high-level Fe-doped catalyst (Pt/2Fe-DMSN), some aggregated FeOx species existed even after the Fe and Pt redispersion process, and these aggregated FeOx species were not fully reduced during the activation process at 500 °C (Fig. 9), which may have resulted in decreased propene selectivity. The best PDH activity was obtained on the Pt/0.4Fe-DMSN catalyst, which may have been caused by the strong interaction of Pt and the isolated Fe species. The long-term stability test for PDH (Fig. 1C) indicates the superiority of the modification involving Fe and Pt rather than that of Sn in this system.
3.5. Coke analysis and its effect on catalytic performance
Raman spectroscopy and O2-TPO measurements were used to analyse the type and nature of the coke on the spent catalysts. As shown in Fig. 11, all of the spent catalysts showed two bands at 1335 and 1600 cm−1, which are typical for coke deposition. And these two bands can be deconvolved to four bands. The band at 1600 cm−1 is the G band, which is the doubly degenerate phonon mode with E2g symmetry for a perfect graphite lattice [53]. The band at 1335 cm−1 is the D1 band, which assigned to a defect and an in-plane transverse optic phonon mode in the graphene lattice. The intensity ratio of the D1 to the G band (ID1/IG) was calculated and the results are given in Table 2. The Pt/0.2Fe-DMSN catalyst showed the lowest ID1/IG ratio of 0.66, which suggests that the coke was mainly a graphene phase. The Pt/2Fe-DMSN catalyst showed the highest ID1/IG ratio of 1.04, suggesting that the coke had disordered features and lower crystallinity. As given in Table 2, the lowest propene selectivity obtained on the Pt/2Fe-DMSN catalyst had the highest ID1/IG ratio, while the highest propene selectivity on Pt/0.2Fe-DMSN catalyst had the lowest ID1/IG ratio. It has been reported that coke with disordered features is associated with low propene selectivity [54]. Moreover, the D3 band with a large line width at approximately 1500 cm−1 was attributed to amorphous carbon, while the D4 band at 1220 cm−1 was attributed to the disordered graphitic lattice of an A1g symmetry [55]. O2-TPO and TG was further carried out to analyse the quantity and deposition position of the coke. As shown in Fig. 12A, the peak at low temperature (below 400 °C) suggests the coke deposited on active metal, while the peak at high temperature (above 400 °C) represents the coke deposited on support. Moreover, the weight losses at below and above 400 °C in the TG results are assigned to the coke deposited on the active metal and on the support, respectively. According to the O2-TPO and TG results, the coke mainly deposited on the supports of the Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts. This indicates the effective migration of coke from the metal sites to the supports. The mass increase of Pt/2Fe-DMSN catalyst in the temperature range of 100–450 °C of TG curve may be caused by the oxidation of Fe species. And the large quantity of coke deposition on the Pt/2Fe-DMSN catalyst suggests that the aggregated FeOx clusters may have been responsible for coke deposition.

4. Conclusions
In summary, this study focused on the development of a series of Pt/Fe-DMSN catalysts for PDH. UV-Vis DRS and Raman spectra showed that redispersion of Fe species occurred during the loading of Pt onto the Fe-DMSN supports as a result of the interaction between Pt and Fe. Moreover, this interaction promoted the redispersion of Pt during the reduction process, which resulted in a strong metal (Pt)–support (Fe-DMSN) interaction. For the catalysts with low levels of Fe doping (Pt/0.2Fe-DMSN and Pt/0.4Fe-DMSN), isolated Fe3+ in the DMSN supports anchored the Pt and led to the formation of well-dispersed Pt clusters. For the catalyst with a high level of Fe doping (Pt/2Fe-DMSN), some aggregated FeOx species formed, which resulted in side reactions. The Pt/0.4Fe-DMSN catalyst showed the best catalytic performance for PDH because of the strong interaction between isolated Fe3+ and Pt species. This study not only offers Pt/Fe-DMSN as active catalysts for PDH, but also provides a method for improving the redispersion of metals for producing high performance catalysts.
