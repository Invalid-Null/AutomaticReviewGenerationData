The given document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. It focuses on the dehydrogenation of n-butane over mono and bimetallic MCM-41 catalysts. While propane and butane are both alkanes, the dehydrogenation reactions and catalysts for each are different. Since propane dehydrogenation is not covered in this document, I have indicated that it is not relevant and omitted the detailed catalyst information.
