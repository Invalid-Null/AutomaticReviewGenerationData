Dehydrogenation of propane on chromia/alumina catalysts promoted by tin
Abstract
Dehydrogenation catalysts based on chromia supported on γ-alumina, containing about 3 wt.% of chromium and increasing amounts of tin (up to 3 wt.%), were prepared and characterized by means of several techniques, such as N2 adsorption–desorption at 77 K, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), laser Raman spectroscopy, temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and chemical analyses. The catalytic behavior of the samples was investigated in the propane dehydrogenation reaction at 883 K. The coking formation (in 150 min of time of stream) was analyzed by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO). The addition of increasing amounts of the tin determined a general decrease in the coking formation. TPR profiles of the Sn-containing samples showed the presence of one reduction peaks, which decreased in intensity at high tin loading.
1. Introduction
Dehydrogenation of light paraffins has great industrial importance because it represents an alternative for obtaining alkenes for polymerization and other organic synthesis from low cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks.
Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic equilibrium limited reaction that is generally carried out at 800–900 K and atmospheric pressure using platinum [1] or chromium [2] catalysts. The high activity and selectivity of supported chromia catalysts for the dehydrogenation of C3–C4 alkanes have been known for many decades [3], [4]. Widely employed industrial catalysts for this reaction are chromia supported on γ-alumina, a refractory high surface area material, which presents the undesired feature of catalyzing the side reactions of cracking and coking, leading to catalyst deactivation. In this respect, the possibility of using supports with different acid properties [5], [6], [7] and the addition of alkali or alkaline-earth metals to the catalyst formulation [8], [9], [10], [11] have also been investigated. In the case of chromia supported on γ-alumina, the promotion of activity and selectivity in the presence of alkali metals has been attributed to a decrease in surface acidity or to an increase in the number of active sites and to a stabilizing effect on the structure of the carrier against recrystallisation to the α-phase [9], [10], [12]. On the other hand, an inhibition effect of potassium on activity has been observed in [11], depending both on the concentration of the alkali metal and the chromium.
It has been generally accepted that the catalytic properties of the chromia-based systems are due to surface Cr(III) species. During the catalyst regeneration, part of the chromium is oxidized at Cr6+ and also at Cr5+. These oxidized chromium contribute to coke catalytic combustion. For the other side, they diminish the selectivity to the olefinic product in the first stage of dehydrogenation due to the reactant combustion. The objective of this work was to look into the effect of the tin aggregate as an activity, selectivity and stability promoter in chromia/alumina catalysts prepared by impregnation with a relatively low chromium loading if compared to industrial catalysts. Industrial catalysts are usually prepared with a chromia load dependant on the process (12 wt.% in isothermal processes for obtaining mono-olefins and 18–20 wt.% in adiabatic processes for obtaining di-olefins). In previous studies [14] we observed that catalysts with a 3 wt.% chromium are as active as those with high loads (8 wt.% or higher), but they present poor catalytic stability between runs (the statement “Catalytic stability between runs” refers to the difference in activity for the same catalyst between the first and the second runs).
The addition of tin to platinum catalysts has proved to be an effective way to reduce undesired reactions and prevent deactivation, due to coke formation in naphtha reforming and alkanes dehydrogenation reactions, but no data in the literature have been found on the use of tin as promoter for dehydrogenation reaction on chromia alumina catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
In this study four Sn–Cr/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared with 3 wt.% chromium and variable amounts of tin ranging from 0 to 3 wt.%. Another chromium-free solid was prepared with 3 wt.% tin so as to observe its particular effects on the support features. The samples prepared were identified as Sn(n)Cr(m)/Al2O3 where n and m indicate the percentual contents in weight for Sn and Cr in the catalyst, respectively.
The catalysts were initially prepared by fixing the chromium to alumina and then adding the tin. A commercial alumina ALCOA F110 was used as a support which is characterized by a Na content lower than 0.1%, Sg = 180 m2/g and Vg = 0.39 ml/g.
Preparation of the Cr(3)/Al2O3 system: Alumina in 2 mm-diameter spheres was loaded in an impregnation reactor with liquid recycling, where it was placed in contact with a chromic acid solution for 2 h. The chromium-impregnated alumina was dried at 323 K for 2 h at atmospheric pressure and then at 373 K for 5 h at vacuum. Calcination was done at 873 K for 1 h. It was reached by heating at 2.5 K/min.
Sn addition to the catalysts: catalysts were prepared from the Cr(3)/Al2O3 catalyst with 0.3, 1 and 3 wt.% of Sn, impregnating with tin nitrate solutions using the incipient humidity method. The powdered solid was put in contact with a volume of impregnating solution equivalent to the volume of the pores. The concentrations for the solutions were appropriate to the required tin content in every catalyst. A solution of nitric acid was used for the catalyst with 0% Sn. The impregnated samples were dried at 373 K with vacuum and then calcinated, using the same heating program described for the Cr(3)/Al2O3 catalyst but maintaining the samples at 873 K for 6 h.
Preparation of the Sn(3)/Al2O3 system: this system was prepared following a identical procedure to the one used for the addition of tin to the catalysts described above.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The amount of chromium and tin in the catalysts was determined by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy by using a Philips PW 1400 spectrometer. The calibration curve was made by using standards of concentration measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Varian AA-275).
Textural analysis of catalyst samples was done by means of adsorption–desorption of nitrogen at 77 K, using an Micromeritics Accu Sorb 2100 E.
XRPD patterns were obtained with a Rigaku-D/max-3C diffractometer operated at 30 kV and 20 mA, employing Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15417 nm). Scans were taken with a 2θ step of 4°/min.
Raman spectra were recorded from powdered samples, with a JASCO TRS600SZP multichannel monochromatic spectrometer. The samples were pressed into self-supporting wafers. The Raman spectra were recorded at 169 K and using the 514.5 nm line of argon ion laser as the excitation source. The laser power at the catalyst wafers was 200 mW, unless state otherwise. The samples were placed under a microscope in such a way that it was possible to point the laser beam to any desired particle.
TPR studies were performed in a conventional unit. The apparatus consisted of a gas handling system with mass flow controllers (Mathesson), a tubular reactor, a linear temperature programmer (Omega, model CN 2010), a PC for data retrieval, a furnace and various cold traps. Samples of ca. 100 mg were first oxidized in a 30 ml/min flow of 20 vol.% O2 in He at 723 K for 2 h and then cooled at room temperature. After that, helium was admitted at room temperature to remove oxygen. The samples were subsequently contacted with a 30 ml/min flow of 4.5 vol.% H2 in nitrogen and heated, at a rate of 10 K min−1, to a final temperature of 893 K, while hydrogen consumption was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector after removing the water formed. The voltage values from the detector and those from the thermocouple were converted into digital signals using a data acquisition module and recorded in a PC.
2.3. Catalytic activity
The activity of the catalyst samples for dehydrogenation of propane was tested in a stainless steel, fixed-bed tubular reactor, at 883 K and atmospheric pressure, using a catalyst charge of 1 g and a gaseous mixture of 20 mol% propane in nitrogen at a total flow of 24 ml/min as a feed. The fed gases were carefully dried by passing them through a column filled with silica gel and molecular sieve and preheated before being introduced into the reactor. Prior to the run, the catalyst was heated up to the reaction temperature in N2 flow. Reactant and effluent reaction products were analyzed by GC by using an activated alumina packed column and a flame ionization detector (FID). Conversion of propane and selectivity to propene, expressed as mole percent, were calculated as the ratio of moles of converted propane to the moles of fed propane and the ratio of moles of formed propene to the moles of converted propane, respectively. Two dehydrogenation runs of 150 min reaction were performed for each catalyst. A regeneration step was carried out between both runs, thus eliminating the coke by in situ combustion with air at 723 K for 1 h. After the second run (150 min of reaction), the catalysts were unloaded from the reactor without being regenerated for their posterior coke analysis.
2.4. Analysis of coke
The carbon deposits formed during the second dehydrogenation were analyzed by Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) of coke combustion.
DTA of samples were recorded by using a Shimadzu 50 analyser for Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA). The scanned temperature ranged from room temperature to 1073 K. A synthetic mixture consisting of air (40 ml/min) and nitrogen (60 ml/min) was used as oxidant. The sample load was of 20 mg and alpha alumina was used as reference sample. The study was carried out at two heating temperatures: 15 and 30 K/min.
TGA of samples were recorded by using TGA Shimadzu equipment. The samples, ca. 15 mg, were placed in a Pt cell and heated from room temperature to 1073 K at a heating rate of 10 K/min with a gas feed (air) of 50 ml/min.
3. Results and discussion
Table 1 shows the chromium and tin contents of the catalysts under study, obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. The tin and chromium contents in the catalysts matched the nominal values programmed during preparation. The data in Table 1 also show that the support area is greater than the rest of the catalysts, but they do not show differences from each other. The area reduction for the catalysts prepared in the relation to the support area, which was 11% in this study, has also been observed in previous studies [13], [14] and should be attributed to differences in thermal calcination treatment rather than to a blocking of the pores resulting from the chromium and/or tin loading.

The distribution of pore volumes as a function of the radium for the Sn(0)Cr(3)/Al2O3, Sn(1)Cr(3)/Al2O3 and Sn(3)Cr(3)/Al2O3 catalysts showed a mean pore radium of approximately 20 Å. The pore volumes for the Sn(0)Cr(3)/Al2O3 catalyst was not modified by the tin added. The XRPD of alumina samples (Sn(0)Cr(0)/Al2O3), alumina without chromium and maximum tin loading (Sn(3)Cr(0)/Al2O3) and alumina with chromium and maximum tin loading (Sn(3)Cr(3)/Al2O3) are presented in Fig. 1. The diffractogram corresponding to the support (Fig. 1a), shows diffraction lines related to the γ-alumina phase and to α-alumina. The support impregnated with 3% Sn (Fig. 1b) and the catalyst with maximum Sn content (Fig. 1c) show quite weakened diffraction lines characteristic of the support, but they do not show diffraction lines of a crystalline phase from tin or chromium. This is not surprising in the case of chromium, because the high area of the support as well as the low chromium loading and the impregnation method applied in chromium deposition guarantee its dispersion on the support. It is not surprising either for tin not to present crystalline phases. It has been suggested in previous studies using bi-metallic catalysts, Sn–Pt–alumina, that the distinguishing characteristics of the Pt in these catalysts results from the formation of a tin aluminate. The diffractograms obtained in our study showed no signs of this phase in any case.

The Raman spectra for the catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. For the catalysts Sn(0)Cr(3)/Al2O3, Sn(0.3)Cr(3)/Al2O3 and Sn(1)Cr(3)/Al2O3, the main Raman peaks are observed at 850 and 352 cm−1. A slight displacement toward lower wavenumber (850–845 cm−1) can be also observed for the sample containing 3 wt.% Sn. This Peaks are assigned to the symmetric stretching and bending modes of hydrated tetrahedral surface-chromate species. The shoulders observed at higher wavenumber (∼906 cm−1, ∼943 cm−1) indicate that species such as Cr2O72− anion are present in small amounts. The presence of other species such as Cr3O102− anion cannot be ruled out. The band at 550 cm−1 attributed to crystalline cluster of Cr2O3 is not found in this study. It may be observed that the intensity of stretching band (850 cm−1) increases with Sn content. This could be indicating that Sn modifies the distribution of chromium oxides species on the support surface.

It has been suggested that the upward shift of the Raman bands indicates the formation of the dimmers of chromium oxides [15]. Therefore, the shift observed by the tin addition might be assimilated to a lower chromium covering. This should allow the formation of less polymerized chromates species.
The interpretation of the TPR curves is limited to the discussion about the number of reduction peaks, to the reduction temperatures obtained from the peaks maximum (Tmax) and to the total hydrogen consumption expressed in arbitrary units (a.u.) which in our case reflect the magnitude of oxidized chromium in the catalysts. Fig. 3 shows the TPR profiles for the catalysts with different tin contents. The TPR of the solid Sn(3)Cr(0)/Al2O3, not included in this figure, did not show a reduction peak for tin. It might be observed that Sn(0)Cr(3)/Al2O3 catalyst presents the highest hydrogen consumption. This consumption decreases with the increase of Sn loading. The minimum hydrogen consumption corresponded to the catalyst with 3% Sn. Besides the main peaks, the TPR profile of this catalyst exhibits two minor peaks at about 220 and 600 °C. The decrease in hydrogen consumption implies that the Sn added to the catalyst brings about a decrease in chromium oxidized species (Cr6+ y Cr5+). The effect is small in the catalyst with 0.3% Sn, but it increases considerably in catalysts with 1% and 3% Sn, the latter showing a lower amount of oxidized chromium. In Table 2 is summarized the Tmax and the consumed amount of hydrogen. The Tmax slightly changes to a higher values with Sn loading. The hydrogen consumption for Sn(0)Cr(3)/Al2O3 corresponding to the reduction Cr6+ → Cr3+ represents 10% of whole chromium. The hydrogen consumption for Sn(3)Cr(3)/Al2O3 clearly diminishes and represents a 20% lower than that for Sn(0)Cr(3)/Al2O3.

The contribution of the support and homogeneous reaction may afford great influence to the catalysis and coking. Under the same reaction conditions as the ones used for the rest of the catalysts, the Sn(0)Cr(0)/Al2O3 sample showed conversions of ∼3% at 5 min and about 10% at 150 min with selectivity of 70%. The support showed an appreciable coke formation. The Sn(3)Cr(0)/Al2O3 catalyst showed conversions and selectivities of 3% and 55%, respectively; but, in turn, the spent catalyst showed no appreciable coke formation. The DTA did not show the coke combustion peak.
In general, the initial conversion values for the first run were of about 60% for those catalysts with Sn content between 0 and 1 wt.%. The catalyst with 3 wt.% tin presented a lower initial activity than the rest of the catalysts for the first run, but the change in activity over time was less marked. Initial selectivity was definitely higher in catalysts with 1 and 3% tin, which is not surprising due to the fact that they have less oxidized chromium and form less coke. In the second run, all catalysts showed lower initial activity. Considering the data from the 10 min reaction, the reduction in activity was similar in the case of the catalysts containing up to 1% tin, approximately 10%. The catalyst with 3% Sn showed a more pronounced reduction in activity (15%) than the other catalysts, but selectivity was not modified.
The analysis of the second run allows us to observe that all catalysts diminish in conversion but not in selectivity. Every catalyst reduces initial activity in about 10% in relation to the first run. If we compare the conversion data from the catalyst without tin to those to which up to 1% Sn was added, we may claim that this deactivation problem does not result from tin. In general, this phenomenon is usually observed in catalysts with low chromium content, in which small changes in chromium dispersion (redistribution and insertion in the alumina network) brings about important changes in catalytic activity. The activity loss for all catalysts at to 1 wt.% Sn is the same. Additional factors should be considered in the case of the catalyst with the higher Sn content.
Fig. 5 shows the results of DTA combustion (heating rate at 15 K/min) of coked catalysts after 150 min of reaction. Two exothermal peaks can be observed. The first (∼493 K) may be attributed to chromium oxidation whereas the second (∼723 K), which is greater, corresponds to the coke combustion.

The analysis of these curves allows us to infer that the addition of tin modifies coke formation as well as its burning temperature. This effect is small in the catalyst with 0.3% Sn. It increases in the catalyst with 1% and considerably in the catalyst with 3% Sn, in which the coke reduction is more significant. Relative coke (defined as the ratio of areas of the combustion peak of a catalyst to the catalyst without tin) and maximum combustion temperature (Tmax) obtained from the burning of the coke performed at a heating rate of 15 K/min. are shown in Table 1. The coke amounts for the support and the catalysts, expressed as wt.% and obtained from TGA experiments, were included in Table 1. This results, obtained from DTA and TGA experiments, clearly show the main effect of adding Sn.
4. Conclusions
Tin alters the activity, selectivity and stability of chromia–alumina catalysts. The addition of tin to these catalysts results in important changes in the amount of oxidized chromium and in the amount of deposited coke which depend on the Sn content in the catalyst. Up to 1% of Sn addition, the effects of these changes on catalytic activity and stability were little noticeable. The addition of 3% Sn, which produces an important reduction of the amount of oxidized chromium and of the amount of deposited coke improves catalytic stability but diminishes activity. In all cases, the addition of tin improves the initial selectivity of the catalysts.
