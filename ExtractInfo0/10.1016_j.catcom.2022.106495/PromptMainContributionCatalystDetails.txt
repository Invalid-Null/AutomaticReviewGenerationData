Propane dehydrogenation to propylene over Co@N-doped carbon: Structure-activity-selectivity relationships




1. Introduction
Propylene, being a major commodity chemical, is widely produced by oil-cracking technologies in a mixture with other olefins [1,2]. However, a more focused and atomic-efficient complement to this approach, namely the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH), is becoming increasingly important [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. Currently, two commercial PDH processes are in practice, drawing on the use of Pt/Al2O3 or CrOx/Al2O3 based catalysts, though a number of challenges remain as the supported Pt catalysts are expensive and difficult to reactivate, while Cr-containing materials are environmentally hazardous [[1], [2], [3], [4],10]. Therefore, a variety of alternate, albeit generally less efficient catalyst formulations applicable to PDH, have been elaborated for the last decade. Among them, VOx, GaOx, MoOx, CoOx, FeOx, InOx, ZnO, ZrO2 and (ZnO-ZrO2)TiO2 based materials showed the most promising catalytic behavior [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]].
In line with these findings, it was shown also that various forms of carbon (mainly nanocarbons [11]), which are commonly regarded as relatively accessible and easy to disposal materials, can exhibit a high catalytic performance in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to corresponding olefins, including the PDH reaction [[12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]]. Moreover, it was demonstrated that carbon doped with N-, P- and other heteroatoms can be a more efficient catalyst for the same transformations [[18], [19], [20], [21]]. It is not surprising, then, that carbon materials enriched both with nitrogen and a transition metal display the continued growth in the catalytic activity toward the alkane's dehydrogenation. Indeed, a number of Co-N-C catalytic systems, obtained by different synthetic approaches, showed an exceptional activity in PDH [[22], [23], [24], [25], [26]]. For example, a hybrid catalyst comprising cobalt‑nitrogen compounds anchoring on oxidized carbon nanotubes, CoN@OCNTs, provided a comparatively high initial conversion of propane (∼20%) and significant selectivity to propylene (>95%) at 570 °C [23]. The catalytic performance was even higher with a spatial isolation of cobalt oxide sites in N-doped carbon supported on silicalite-1 [24]. The corresponding composites, designated as CoOx@NC/S-1, were prepared by pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) loaded on silicalite-1 zeolite (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1). These catalysts provided the propane conversion of 40% and the propylene selectivity of >97% at 600 °C with no apparent deactivation after 10 h of reaction.
Notably, it has been proved that atomically-dispersed Co(II)-Nx sites [22,23] or isolated CoO sites [24] incorporated in carbon were largely responsible for the target catalytic properties. On the other hand, it was claimed that Co-N-doped carbon materials obtained by pyrolysis of ZIF-67 at various temperatures (550 to 900 °C) demonstrated positive correlation between metallic Co proportion and catalytic properties in the PDH reaction at 550 °C [26].
In general, the Me-N-doped carbon materials (Me = Co, Ni, Fe, etc.) are known as effective noble-metal-free catalysts in many others, mostly redox reactions [[27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]]. Typically, these composites are produced by pyrolysis of metal–organic frameworks [24,26,[36], [37], [38], [39], [40]]. Another usual approach is based on wet impregnation of (nano)carbon with complexes of transition metals with N-heterocycles [27,31,32]. In addition, our research group has recently shown the opportunity to obtain Co-N-doped carbons (Co@NC) by simply solid-state mixing of readily available raw materials, such as carbon black, nitrogen heterocycles and Co(II) salts, followed by pyrolysis [[41], [42], [43]].
Importantly, the synthetic approaches mentioned lead to the formation of similar Co@NC materials, which, however, may strongly differ by the content of common structural elements such as metallic cobalt, cobalt oxides and graphitic carbon filled with subnano-sized cobalt‑nitrogen sites. This allows, in principle, to assess the structural factor in the catalytic reaction. Given the strong overall interest in the Me-N-C-materials and in order to evaluate further their potential use as the dehydrogenation catalysts, we report here the catalytic activities of Co@NC composites in PDH reaction. The appropriate Co@NC samples were obtained following by different synthetic techniques with the aim to provide their sufficient structural diversity, and thus determine the relationship of each catalyst component to the catalytic performance.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
The catalysts preparation procedures are given in the Supporting information (SI). Briefly, the samples denoted as Co@NC-Gr and Co@NC-W were synthesized according to the literature, via deposition of the Co(II) complexes with N-heterocycles (1,10-phenanthroline or 2-methylimidazole) on Vulcan XC72R carbon, using the solid-state grinding [41] or incipient wetness impregnation [32] techniques, respectively (Table 1). The sample denoted as Co@NC-ZIF was synthesized through a separate ZIF-67 synthesis from cobalt(II) nitrate and 2-methylimidazole, followed by pyrolysis [37]. The Co@NC-ZIFSA and Co@NC-Gr1SA samples were obtained by treatment of Co@NC-ZIF and Co@NC-Gr1 with a 1 M sulfuric acid water solution at 90 °C for 5 h, as described earlier [42].

2.2. Catalysts characterization techniques
A powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a Siemens D500 instrument with monochromatized CuKα radiation and θ – 2 θ focusing geometry. The porous structure parameters were determined from N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K on ASAP-2400 (Micromeritics, USA) analyzer after degassing the samples at 150 °C to a residual pressure of 30 mTorr (4 Pa). The content of Co element in the samples was measured by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using a sequential spectrometer ARL Perform'X with a Rh anode X-ray tube. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) were obtained with JEM-2010 (JEOL, Japan) and ThemisZ (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) instruments with accelerating voltage 200 kV and lattice resolutions 0.14 nm and 0.07 nm, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a SPECS (Germany) photoelectron spectrometer using a hemispherical PHOIBOS-150-MCD-9 analyzer (Al Kα radiation, hν = 1486.6 eV, 150 W). The binding energy (BE) scale was pre-calibrated using the positions of the peaks of Au 4f7/2 (BE = 84.0 eV) and Cu 2p3/2 (BE = 932.67 eV) core levels. The BE values were corrected by referencing to the C 1 s internal standard (284.5 eV).
2.3. Catalytic performance tests
The PDH reactions were performed in a quartz tube flow reactor of internal diameter 7.5 mm. The gas mixture (10 vol% propane balanced with nitrogen) was fed to the reactor at a gas hour space velocity (GHSV) of 7500 ml h−1 gcat−1. Reactions were carried out at atmospheric pressure using a catalyst (0.2 g) mixed with 1 ml of quartz particles (d = 0.45 to 1 mm). The reaction temperature, 600 °C, was controlled inside the reactor with an accuracy of ±0.5 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Chromos GC-1000) with a flame-ionization detector, using a quartz capillary column of an inner diameter 0.32 mm and a length of 7 m. The column was prepared by the static high pressure method, yielding a monolithic layer of porous SiO2 formed in the process of sol-gel synthesis directly inside the capillary [44]. Prior to the measurements, the catalysts were gradually heated to 600 °C in a flow of N2 for 1 h. The blank experiments (the quartz particles only) showed propane conversion of ~2% and selectivity to propylene about 55%.
The propane conversion (X) and propylene selectivity (S) were calculated according to the carbon atom balance method:
where CC3H8 and CC3H6 mean mole flow rate of propane and propylene, respectively. In view of the reaction-induced changes in the gas flow due to conversion of one molecule of propane into two molecules (propylene and hydrogen) during the reaction, the values of CC3H8 and CC3H6have been normalized by carbon balance accordingly.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalysts characterization
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of as-synthesized catalysts. Peaks at 44.0°, 51.7° and 75.9° are clearly visible for Co@NC-Gr1, Co@NC-Gr2, Co@NC-W, Co@NC-ZIF and CoC-Gr samples. They correspond to (111), (200) and (220) crystallographic planes of cubic Co, and reflect the presence of metallic cobalt in these catalysts. In contrast, such peaks are practically absent or look severely reduced in case of Co@NC-Gr1SA and Co@NC-ZIFSA samples. Also, two broad diffraction peaks at ~25° and 44° assignable to amorphous-graphitic (turbostratic) carbon, are observed for all the catalysts. And, lastly, unlike other catalysts, XRD pattern of Co@NC-ZIF includes a set of notable peaks related to crystallographic planes of cobalt oxides, CoO and Co3O4.

In spite of the fact that the Co@NC catalysts are synthesized using different preparation methods, there TEM images, however, can be very similar [[41], [42], [43]]. The only distinction is the different content of metallic cobalt and cobalt oxide nanoparticles, which are uniformly distributed in graphitic carbon enriched with highly dispersed subnano-sized particles of cobalt coordinated to nitrogen. As an example, Fig. 2 shows the TEM images of fresh Co@NC-ZIF sample. In addition to the structural elements listed above, this catalyst comprises also a moderate amount of carbon nanotubes (outlined in yellow). Their growth was obviously promoted by metallic cobalt largely contained in Co@NC-ZIF.

After treatment of Co@NC-ZIF with sulfuric acid, the resulting material, Co@NC-ZIFSA, retained approximately one third of the original amount of cobalt (Table 1), particularly in the form of residual cobalt nanoparticles survived only in a dense graphite package (Fig. 3). Besides, nanoclusters of CoOx are present in the catalyst (Fig. 3d). More important, though, is the fact that the dispersed subnanosized cobalt species stood practically intact (Fig. 3f). It should also be noted that the acid treatment of the Co@NC-ZIF and Co@NC-Gr1 samples showed a different influence on their texture (Table S1). Thus, SBET of Co@NC-ZIFSA has increased to 507 m2 g−1 on account of the growth of microporosity, while its mesoporosity notably decreased, from 147 to 51 m2 g−1. In contrast, mesoporosity of Co@NC-Gr1SA (37 m2 g−1) is higher than in the parent Co@NC-Gr1 sample (22 m2 g−1).

XPS analysis was conducted to determine the distribution of oxidation states of cobalt and to clarify the nature of the carbon and nitrogen on the catalysts surface. The obtained binding energies (BE) profiles are shown in Fig. 4. In the high-resolution Co 2p spectrum, the catalysts exhibit mainly two kinds of BEs, relating to Co0 at 778.8 eV, and assignable to Co2+ at 780.6 and ca. 797 eV (Fig. 4a). The most significant impact of Co0 is found in the Co@NC-ZIF, Co@NC-ZIFSA and Co@NC-Gr2 samples. This is in line with their XRD characteristics. The C 1 s spectra show major peak at BE of 284.5 eV corresponding to graphitic carbon (Fig. 4b). Less considerable contributions at 285.8, 288.1 and 290.2 eV conform to deconvolution peaks of CN, CO and carbonate functions, respectively. Fig. 4c shows the high-resolution XPS N 1 s spectra, which can be resolved into peaks related to pyridinic (398.8 eV), pyrrolic/graphitic (400.8 eV) and NOx (402.8, 405.6 eV) functions. As it can be seen, the relative contribution of these nitrogen forms correlates with the N-ligand taken. The catalysts based on 2-methylimidazole, Co@NC-ZIF, Co@NC-ZIFSA and Co@NC-Gr2, have a higher percentage of pyrrolic/graphitic nitrogen. It should be noted here that a number of authors identify also peaks of Co-N species at BE of ~781 and 398.8 eV in the Co 2p and N 1 s spectra, respectively [26,40]. Such (additional) peaks could obviously contribute to graphic views in Fig. 4a and c. In general, the XPS characteristics are very close to those of Co@NC materials reported in the literature [[22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]].

To sum up the catalysts characteristics, one can conclude that all the prepared Co@NC samples consist of porous graphitic carbon enriched with uniformly distributed subnano-sized cobalt species coordinated to pyridinic/pyrrolic nitrogen atoms. Such species are widely regarded in the literature as single-atomic centers Co(II)-Nx [22,23,26,39,40]. The main structural difference of the catalysts lies in the different content of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles incorporated in the graphite carbon. In particular, Co@NC-ZIF sample differs from other catalysts in that it contains the most significant amount of metallic cobalt nanoparticles and comprises also cobalt oxides, detectable by XRD. Leaching of Co@NC-ZIF and Co@NC-Gr1 samples with sulfuric acid resulted in the decrease of Co content in the derived Co@NC-ZIFSA and Co@NC-Gr1SA materials, which was mainly happened at the expense of poorly packed metallic cobalt nanoparticles. In contrast, the subnano-sized cobalt/nitrogen species are resistant to the acid treatment.
3.2. Catalytic performance
The catalytic performances of the Co@NC catalysts were evaluated at 600 °C using a 10% propane/N2 mixture. Fig. 5 shows that Co@NC-Gr1, Co@NC-Gr2 and Co@NC-W catalysts provide propane conversion of 12–23% with selectivity to propylene above 85%. No dramatic loss of activity was observed for approximately 60 min on stream, while the selectivity to propylene increased steadily to the level of 90%. Under the specified reaction conditions, in addition to the PDH reaction, propane can undergo concurrent side reactions yielding mainly methane, ethylene and carbonaceous material [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]]. However, the carbon balance for the Co@NC-Gr1, Co@NC-Gr2 and Co@NC-W catalysts stood above 95% over the course of the tests. This indicated a low level of coke formation on the catalysts surface, suggesting priority of PDH over the cracking reactions.

It is noteworthy that opposed to the Co@NC catalysts, the nitrogen-free sample, CoC-Gr, showed significantly lower activity, allowing only 2–3% propane conversion (Fig. S1). That clearly underlines the key role of nitrogen in the catalytic performance.
Furthermore, Fig. 6 demonstrates that catalytic properties of Co@NC-Gr1 and Co@NC-Gr1SA are not essentially different. Moreover, despite a nearly three-fold decrease in total content of Co in the latter catalyst (Table 1), its activity is nevertheless slightly higher. This result illustrates that the residual cobalt centers (resistant to sulfuric acid) are primarily responsible for the propane dehydrogenation process, while cobalt oxide and metallic cobalt nanoparticles are not the main participants in the target reaction.

To clarify further the correlation of activity with the structure of the catalysts, the catalytic behaviors of Co@NC-ZIF and its derivative, Co@NC-ZIFSA, were compared. Fig. 7 shows the corresponding catalytic performances, which turned out to be quite different. Initially, Co@NC-ZIF is very active, resulting within the first 50 min in the exclusive generation of methane, hydrogen and carbon material, revealed by a loss ~30% of carbon balance. Then, Co@NC-ZIF completely changes its catalytic performance in favor of the PDH reaction. In contrast to the parent catalyst, the catalytic performance of Co@NC-ZIFSA appeared similar to those of other Co@NC catalysts right from the start. At that, Co@NC-ZIFSA has shown the best activity among the tested catalysts, which is clearly visible when considering the corresponding conversions of propane on the combined graph (Fig. S2). After 5 h time on stream, the propane conversion decreased from 29% to 18%. In general, such a picture of gradual deactivation of cobalt catalysts is quite typical, and can be explained by coke deposition along with restructure of Co sites at the high temperature conditions [26,45,46].

In order to gain insight into the sharp difference in the catalytic behavior of the fresh versus to the spent Co@CN-ZIF catalyst, it would be desirable to analyze their microstructures. In Fig. 8 one can see two major changes in the Co@CN-ZIF catalyst after 5 h of operation. Firstly, significant growth of carbon nanotubes is observed compared to the image in Fig. 2. This can be explained by the large amount of metallic cobalt in the fresh catalyst, which is known to strongly promote the carbon nanotubes growth. According to STEM-EDX analysis, the content of Co in the grown carbon nanotubes is about 0.2 wt%, while nitrogen is practically absent (Fig. S3). Secondly, considerable carbonization of cobalt nanoparticles, resulting in their additional and denser encapsulation, is clearly seen in Fig. 8b and Fig. S4.

(d-g) HAADF-STEM images and EDX elemental mapping of C, Co and N for different areas in the spent Co@NC-ZIF catalyst.
Besides, small CoOx particles of about 2 nm size are detected by TEM on the surface of the spent catalyst (Fig. 8c and Fig. S5). Such oxidation state of cobalt after the reaction upon conditions of high temperature and reducing atmosphere (mixture of H2 and hydrocarbons) seems unexpected. However, the residual and even stable CoOx species in the spent cobalt catalysts (after PDH) were repeatedly described in the literature [24,46].
It is apparent, that metallic cobalt in the fresh Co@CN-ZIF strongly contributes to the propane (or rather propylene) cracking reaction, leading in particular to dense deposition of graphite. After the complete locking of the metallic Co with carbon, the catalyst switches mainly to PDH reaction. It should be noticed that the spent Co@CN-ZIF is de facto close to Co@CN-ZIFSA in the sense that both of them contain only graphitized Co nanoparticles. Moreover, comparison of images in Fig. 3, Fig. 8 (see also Figs. S5 and S6) allows concluding that Co@CN-ZIF and Co@CN-ZIFSA have retained a certain amount of cobalt oxides nanoparticles (CoOx) and subnano-sized cobalt‑nitrogen species. Either of these structural elements could catalyze the PDH reaction [[22], [23], [24]]. However, CoOx can be partially responsible for the cracking reactions too [46]. Hence, it seems reasonable that only subnano-sized cobalt, which most probably is monoatomic cobalt‑nitrogen species Co(II)-Nx, provides selective PDH reaction.
4. Conclusions
A number of Co-N-doped carbon composites have been prepared by a variety of synthetic approaches, including very simple, solid-state grinding technique. These materials have proven to be quite effective catalysts in the target PDH reaction, considered as an additional, atom-efficient way of industrial propylene production. According to XRD, TEM and XPS characterizations, the Co@NC catalysts are composed of graphitic carbon enriched with uniformly distributed subnano-sized cobalt sites in pyridinic/pyrrolic environment, along with cobalt and cobalt oxide nanoparticles of various contents. The latter structural elements, especially metallic cobalt, catalyze concurrent cracking reactions. Removal of Co nanoparticles by treating of the parent Co@NC catalysts with sulfuric acid or their encapsulation in a dense graphite shells in the PDH reaction course results in the increased catalytic efficiency toward propylene production. This indicates that the key catalytic sites in Co@NC materials, ensuring the PDH reaction path, are the subnanosized cobalt‑nitrogen species incorporated in graphitic carbon.
