The given document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation. It discusses boron nitride catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, not plain propane dehydrogenation. The document mentions oxidative dehydrogenation specifically, indicating the presence of an oxidizing agent. Therefore, this does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation without oxidation.
