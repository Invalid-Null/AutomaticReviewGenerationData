Abstract
The influences of support (SiO2 versus Al2O3), synthesis method (impregnation versus colloidal synthesis) and Sn loading on the performance of Sn-promoted Pt nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation to propene at 773 K were explored. Catalysts were characterized extensively by X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction/oxidation, chemisorption, electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and DRIFTS of adsorbed CO. Catalyst stability and selectivity to propene were correlated with extent of Pt-Sn interactions within the nanoparticles, which was favored at high Sn loading, and when the particles were supported on a weakly interacting carrier such as silica. However, oxidative regeneration irreversibly deactivated bimetallic nanoparticles on silica relative to those on alumina. The extended performance of Sn-promoted Pt catalysts is an optimization of the Pt-Sn interactions with the ability to oxidatively redisperse the metals during regeneration.

1. Introduction
Improvements to fracking technology have increased the availability of natural gas and natural gas liquids thus decreasing the cost of chemicals production [1]. The abundant supply of light hydrocarbons has motivated the development of processes for on-purpose dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes that are key building-block molecules in the plastics and specialty chemicals industries [1], [2]. Several processes that have been commercialized utilize chromium-based catalysts, which suffer from environmental concerns [2], [3], or platinum-based catalysts [2]. Supported Pt catalysts in particular are highly active for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, including the conversion of propane to propene. Unfortunately, Pt is also known to catalyze hydrocarbon hydrogenolysis and coke formation at the conditions required for alkane dehydrogenation [2], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Platinum is therefore typically promoted by a second metal such as Ga [9], Cu [10], Zn [11], [12], and Sn [2], [5].
Tin is a well-known promoter of Pt group metals that has been studied in a wide variety of reactions [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. For example, the addition of Sn to Pt propane dehydrogenation catalysts increased selectivity to propene while decreasing catalyst deactivation due to coke formation [5], [7], [8], [28], [29], [30]. The promotional role of Sn on Pt catalysts has been attributed to both electronic and geometric effects [2], [5], [31], [32], [33], [34]. Electronic promotion is proposed to occur by the donation of electronic charge from Sn to Pt, which decreases the heat of ethene [32], [34] and propene [31] adsorption as well as increases the barrier for dissociative adsorption of light alkanes [31], which is postulated to be the rate determining step for the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt [2], [5], [35], [36], [37]. As an increased barrier of the dissociative chemisorption of propane will slow the rate of propane dehydrogenation, there is a trade-off between catalytic activity and stability of Pt-Sn alloys with varying Sn content. Density-functional theory was used to determine that the binding strength of 1-propyl, a key surface intermediate during the dehydrogenation of propane, decreases with increasing Sn-alloy content in the following series: Pt(1 1 1) > Pt3Sn > Pt2Sn > PtSn2 [31]. The decrease in binding energy of dehydrogenated species on the Pt surface lowers the steady state coverage of these unsaturated molecules, inhibiting deep dehydrogenation and coke formation.
The geometric effect of adding Sn to Pt results from the dilution of Pt ensembles. Large ensembles of Pt surface atoms are required for some undesired side reactions including deep dehydrogenation, which leads to coke formation, and hydrogenolysis. Thus, surface dilution of Pt ensembles is thought to enhance selectivity to propene during propane dehydrogenation while decreasing coke formation [2], [4], [28], [29], [30], [32], [37]. The presence of Sn atoms has also been suggested to improve the regeneration of deactivated Pt/Al2O3 by acting as nucleation sites for mobilized Pt atoms during oxidative treatments [4], [30], [38], [39].
The mode and extent of Sn promotion of Pt depends on many factors including synthesis method and catalyst support. For example, co-impregnation of an acidic solution containing SnCl2 and H2PtCl6 forms the bimetallic PtCl2(SnCl3)22− complex that results in a high degree of Pt-Sn interaction during the post-synthesis thermal treatment [5], [30], [40]. Direct reduction of Pt-Sn/SiO2 prepared by incipient wetness impregnation was more active than analogous samples treated in inert gas or air prior to reduction [41]. Additionally, the composition of the catalyst support influences the interactions between Pt and Sn. A support such as SiO2, which interacts weakly with the metals, allows for a greater extent of metal interaction with themselves, resulting in a higher degree of alloy formation [2], [5], [42], [43]. On the contrary, a support such as Al2O3, which interacts strongly with Sn, stabilizes the promoter in an oxidized state [2], [5], [8], [44]. Alloy formation has only been observed on Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts with high Sn loadings [44], [45]. The Sn is typically found near the Pt-Al2O3 interface or on Pt defect sites as determined by FTIR spectroscopy utilizing CO as a probe molecule [46].
Advanced synthesis techniques have been employed recently to produce a narrow size distribution of nanoparticles as well as specific Pt:Sn ratios within those nanoparticles. Particle size is known to influence catalyst stability and product selectivity for monometallic Pt catalysts [47], [48] and bimetallic PtSn catalysts [32]. Step sites on monometallic Pt catalysts, which dominate the activity on smaller particles [48], bind propene more strongly and can lead to the formation of deep dehydrogenation products during propane dehydrogenation [31]. A narrow particle size distribution for the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts can be achieved using colloidal synthesis techniques [15], [32], [49], [50], [51], [52]. In addition, manipulation of nanoparticle composition will influence the alloy phases that are produced. For example, increasing the atomic Sn content from 97:3 (Pt:Sn) to 75:25 has been shown to increase the content of Pt3Sn alloy as evidenced by powder X-ray diffraction [52].
In the present study, the dehydrogenation of propane to propene was investigated over Pt and PtSn catalysts. In particular, the influence of the catalyst support (SiO2 versus Al2O3) and the Sn loading on the catalyst stability and selectivity were investigated, with and without co-fed H2. The performance of colloidal PtSn nanoparticles synthesized using a modified polyol method is compared to those synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation. The influence of Sn and the support on the regeneration of catalysts was also explored.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Catalyst synthesis
Nominal 1 wt% Pt/SiO2, denoted as 1Pt/SiO2, was synthesized via incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) using H2PtCl6·6H2O (>37.5% Pt, Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in distilled, deionized (DI) water. The catalyst was supported on Davisil 636 SiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich). Following impregnation, the catalyst was dried overnight in air at 393 K and treated in 100 cm3 min−1 H2 (99.999%, GTS-Welco) at 923 K for 3 h following a 1 K min−1 ramp rate. Alumina-supported nominal 1 wt% Pt/Al2O3, denoted as 1Pt/Al2O3, was synthesized by IWI utilizing Al2O3 with a mixed phase (pore size 58 Å, ∼150 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich 267740) and H2PtCl6·6H2O. Following impregnation, the catalyst was dried overnight in air at 393 K and treated in 100 cm3 min−1 air (medical grade, GTS-Welco) at 773 K for 3 h following a 1 K min−1 ramp rate. After cooling to room temperature, the 1Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was reduced in 100 cm3 min−1 H2 at 923 K for 3 h following a 1 K min−1 ramp rate.
Bimetallic Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts were synthesized by IWI using H2PtCl6·6H2O and SnCl2 (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) precursors and Davisil 636 SiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich) as the catalyst support. The Pt and Sn precursors were co-impregnated in an HCl (ACS reagent, 37%, Sigma-Aldrich) solution diluted in DI water with an HCl to SnCl2 molar ratio of 3 to 1. The catalysts were dried overnight in air at 393 K and then treated in 100 cm3 min−1 H2 at 923 K for 3 h following a 1 K min−1 ramp rate. The bimetallic catalysts had a nominal loading of Pt of 1 wt% and a nominal loading of Sn ranging from 0.2 wt% to 2.4 wt%. These catalysts were denoted as 1PtxSn/SiO2 where x is the nominal Sn weight loading.
Bimetallic Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized by IWI using H2PtCl6·6H2O and SnCl2 precursors and the mixed phase Al2O3 support. The Pt and Sn precursors were co-impregnated in an HCl solution utilizing the same dilution and HCl:SnCl2 molar ratio as the bimetallic SiO2-supported catalysts. The bimetallic samples were subsequently treated in air and H2 following the same protocol used to prepare monometallic Pt/Al2O3. The bimetallic Al2O3-supported catalysts were denoted as 1PtxSn/Al2O3 where x is the nominal Sn weight percent.
A bimetallic nominal 1 wt% Pt and 0.6 wt% Sn supported on SiO2 catalyst was also synthesized by a modified polyol method [49]. In summary, 0.18 g NaOH (reagent grade ≥98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 50 cm3 ethylene glycol (99.8%, anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich) at 323 K. The solution was cooled to room temperature followed by the addition of 0.053 g PtCl4 (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.030 g SnCl2. The metal precursor solution was stirred for 1 h at room temperature before 2.952 g of SiO2 was added under stirring conditions. The slurry was then rapidly heated to 463 K where it was held for 2 h and stirred under reflux. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, thoroughly washed with DI water, and dried under vacuum. The catalyst was dried overnight in air at 393 K. Lastly, the catalyst was treated in 100 cm3 min−1 air (medical grade, GTS-Welco) at 723 K for 1 h to remove any remaining ethylene glycol, cooled to room temperature, and then treated in 100 cm3 min−1 H2 (99.999%, GTS-Welco) at 773 K for 3 h. All ramp rates were 1 K min−1. This polyol-synthesized bimetallic catalyst was denoted as 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2-P.
A second bimetallic catalyst synthesized by the polyol method composed of 1 wt% Pt and 0.6 wt% Sn supported on Al2O3 was also prepared [49]. For this sample, 0.30 g NaOH was dissolved in 50 cm3 ethylene glycol (99.8%, anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich) at 323 K. The higher concentration of NaOH, relative to that used for 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2-P synthesis, was utilized to ensure that the solution pH was above the point of zero charge for Al2O3. The solution was then cooled to room temperature followed by the addition of 0.053 g PtCl4 and 0.030 g SnCl2. The solution containing the metal precursors was stirred for 1 h at room temperature before 2.952 g of Al2O3 was added under stirring conditions. The slurry was then rapidly heated to 463 K and stirred for 2 h under reflux. The recovered solid was treated the same way as the 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2-P catalyst. The polyol-synthesized Al2O3-supported bimetallic catalyst was denoted as 1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3-P.
Catalyst compositions of some of the samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) provided by Galbraith Laboratories, Inc. (2323 Sycamore Drive, Knoxville, TN 37921).
2.2. Catalyst characterization
2.2.1. Chemisorption of H2 and CO
The number of exposed Pt surface sites was estimated by H2 and CO chemisorption using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 automated adsorption analyzer. All IWI-synthesized catalysts were heated ex situ at 923 K (or 773 K for polyol-synthesized catalysts), in flowing H2 for 3 h prior to chemisorption analysis. The catalysts were heated in situ at 1 K min−1 to 723 K under H2 (99.999%, GTS-Welco) and held at temperature for 2 h. The samples were then cooled to 473 K and evacuated for 2 h before being cooled to 308 K for H2 chemisorption. This sequence was repeated for CO chemisorption using the same sample without exposure to air. The amount of exposed Pt was calculated using the total amount of adsorbed H2 or CO extrapolated to zero pressure. Nominal weight loadings were used for the calculations of H/Pt and CO/Pt unless otherwise noted.
2.2.2. X-ray diffraction
X-ray diffraction patterns of the powder samples were measured using a PANalytical X’Pert Pro equipped with monochromatic Cu Kα-radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) utilizing a scan rate of 0.0088° s−1 from 15° to 90°.
2.2.3. Temperature-programmed reduction
The Al2O3-supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts were probed with temperature programmed reduction (TPR) using a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Approximately 100 mg of catalyst that was freshly calcined in flowing air from the synthesis procedure (prior to reduction in H2) was heated at a rate of 5 K min−1 in 5% H2/Ar (GTS-Welco) to 1073 K.
2.2.4. Transmission electron microscopy
Samples analyzed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) were prepared by dispersing the powders in cyclohexane (99.5%, anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich) and sonicating for 1 h before mounting on Cu-supported holey carbon grids. The catalyst samples were imaged using an FEI Titan 80–300 operating at 300 kV.
2.2.5. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Phi VersaProbe III with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) and a hemispherical analyzer. A magnetic lens with a 100 μm spot size was utilized with a pass energy of 26 eV for region scans at 50 ms per step. Charge compensation was utilized with a low energy external Ar ion flood gun and an internal electron flood gun at 1 eV. Spectra were deconvoluted utilizing CasaXPS. The Si 2p3/2 peak for SiO2 (103.5 eV) was used to reference the peak positions. Peak areas were calculated after subtracting the background and utilizing curve fitting parameters for Pt and Sn reported previously [53].
2.2.6. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy
A Bruker BioRad FTS-60A FTIR spectrometer equipped with a Harrick Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance cell with KBr windows was used for the diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments. The spectra are reported in Kubelka-Munk units and were averaged over 150 scans collected at 1 cm−1 resolution. Alumina-supported catalysts were used as prepared. Silica-supported catalysts were diluted to 50 wt% in Al2O3, which was previously calcined at 773 K, and lightly ground with a mortar and pestle. Samples were loaded into the diffuse reflectance cell and treated in 20 cm3 min−1 H2 (passed through an OMI-2 purifier) at 773 K for 1 h following a 2 K min−1 ramp rate. Catalysts were then cooled to 303 K and purged for 30 min with 30 cm3 min−1 He (99.999%, GTS-Welco, passed through an OMI-2 purifier). Carbon monoxide (99.9%, GTS-Welco) was passed through a SiO2 trap maintained at 195 K to remove carbonyls. The CO was diluted to approximately 1% in He to give a total flow rate of approximately 100 cm3 min−1. The catalyst sample was exposed to the dilute CO for 30 min, and was subsequently purged with He. Spectra were collected starting 15 min after the beginning of the He purge and were recorded every 15 min thereafter.
2.2.7. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane
The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene was performed in a stainless steel continuous flow reactor in a downward configuration with a 0.64 cm OD. A stainless steel pre-heater section was located above the reactor. The catalyst bed was supported by quartz wool. For reactions targeting 2% initial conversion of propane and the effect of co-fed H2, catalysts were diluted with SiO2 to give a total bed loading of about 300 mg. For reactions in which deactivation and regeneration of the catalyst were studied, the catalysts were used without diluent. The undiluted catalyst allowed for the recovery of used catalyst material for additional characterization. Once loaded, catalyst was heated at 1 K min−1 in 100 cm3 min−1 H2 (99.999%, GTS-Welco) and held at 923 K for 3 h for IWI-synthesized catalysts and at 773 K for polyol-synthesized catalysts. The reactor was then cooled to 773 K and purged with 60 cm3 min−1 N2 (99.999%, GTS-Welco) before initiating the flow of the propane feed mixture. The feed consisted of 25% propane and 75% N2 with total flow rate varying from 40 cm3 min−1 to 200 cm3 min−1. Experiments utilizing co-fed H2 had a molar ratio of 1:2:5 for H2:propane: N2. An Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and an HP-PLOT/Q column was used to analyze the reaction products.
The influence of regeneration conditions was investigated by utilizing a synthetic air blend consisting of 20.7% O2 with balance He (GTS-Welco) to mimic the oxidation treatment required to remove coke. Typically, catalysts were first used for propane dehydrogenation for 24 h. The reactor was subsequently purged with 60 cm3 min−1 N2 (99.999%, GTS-Welco) for 1 h at reaction temperature. The coke deposits were removed by treatment in 80 cm3 min−1 of synthetic air at 773 K for 1 h and then purged for 1 h with 60 cm3 min−1 N2. Finally, the catalysts were re-reduced in situ at 773 K in 100 cm3 min−1 in flowing H2 for 2 h and purged for 1 h with 60 cm3 min−1 N2 prior to resuming the flow of the reaction gas mixture.
Equilibrium conversion at 773 K was calculated to be 33% for a 1:3 propane:N2 feed ratio and 19% for a 1:2:5 H2:propane:N2 feed ratio. Sample calculations for the Weisz-Prater criterion can be found in the Supplemental Materials.
2.2.8. Temperature-programmed oxidation of coked samples
The weight percent of coke formed on each catalyst was measured using a TA Instruments SDT Q600 thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Approximately 4–10 mg of used catalyst sample was placed in a small Al2O3 cup that was heated in 20.7% O2/He (GTS-Welco) to 1073 K at a rate of 10 K min−1 for Al2O3 catalysts and 20 K min−1 for SiO2 catalysts. Results from the Al2O3 catalyst support were used to subtract background water loss from Al2O3-supported catalysts.
2.3. Calculation of rate, selectivity, and deactivation
The typical products observed during propane dehydrogenation reactions included methane, ethane, ethene, and propene. The conversion of propane was calculated on a carbon basis as shown in Eq. (1):
(1)
where ni is the number of carbons in product i flowing at molar flow rate of Fi. The selectivity to propene was defined on a carbon basis as shown in Eq. (2):
(2)
The rate of catalytic conversion of propane was defined as the conversion of propane (Eq. (1)) multiplied by the molar flow rate of propane (Fpropane) as show in Eq. (3):
(3)
Rates were sometimes normalized by the initial rate of propane conversion, which was estimated by extrapolation back to time zero. Site-time-yields (STY) were calculated by normalizing the rate by the amount of exposed Pt measured by CO chemisorption. A first-order deactivation mechanism was assumed to estimate the initial rate of catalyst deactivation [2], [54]. The deactivation coefficient, kd (h−1) is defined by Eq. (4):
(4)
where Xstart is defined as the initial conversion at zero time on stream, Xt is the conversion at time t, which is defined here as 0.83 h.
A long term deactivation parameter D quantifies the deactivation of the catalyst after the initial rapid decline in activity over the first 0.83 h on stream and is defined by Eq. (5):
(5)
where Xt is the conversion at time t, defined at 0.83 h on stream, and Xend is the conversion after 3.1 h on stream.
3. Results
3.1. Catalyst characterization
3.1.1. Chemisorption of H2 and CO
Table 1 shows the H2 and CO chemisorption results on both SiO2- and Al2O3-supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts. The H/Pt and CO/Pt for 1Pt/SiO2 were 0.33 and 0.30, respectively, while the H/Pt and CO/Pt for 1Pt/Al2O3 were 0.50 and 0.51, respectively, indicating excellent agreement between the adsorption of the two probe molecules on the monometallic catalysts.
Table 1. Results from chemisorption of H2 and CO on Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts.

1Pt1.2Sn/Al2O3 0.20 0.56
1Pt2.4Sn/Al2O3 0.14 0.49
a
Three separate chemisorption analyses were averaged to obtain the H/Pt and CO/Pt for 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2.
b
ICP-OES data was used to calculate H/Pt and CO/Pt for 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2. The Pt wt% was 0.94% and the Sn wt% was 0.61%.
c
ICP-OES data was used to calculate H/Pt and CO/Pt for 1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3. The Pt wt% was 0.93% and the Sn wt% was 0.68%.
For the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts, both the H2 and CO uptake were inhibited as the Sn content increased. Interestingly, the uptake of H2 was inhibited by Sn to a greater extent than the uptake of CO. Chemisorption of H2 was also inhibited by Sn on the bimetallic Al2O3-supported catalysts, but not to the same extent as those supported on SiO2. For example, the addition of 2.4 wt% Sn to 1Pt/SiO2 decreased the measured H/Pt ratio from 0.33 to 0.0033, whereas addition of 2.4 wt% Sn to 1Pt/Al2O3 only decreased the H/Pt ratio from 0.50 to 0.14. On the alumina supported catalysts, addition of Sn did not inhibit CO uptake, which ranged from 0.49 to 0.64 over the entire range of Sn loadings.
3.1.2. X-ray diffraction
The XRD patterns in the region where low index planes of the metals are present for as synthesized SiO2-supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts are displayed in Fig. 1. The 1Pt/SiO2 sample reveals features characteristic of Pt (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) at 39.8° and 46.1° (JCDPS 00-004-0802), respectively, whereas the addition of 0.2 wt% Sn shifted the Pt (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) peaks to lower angles (39.2° and 45.7°) indicative of incorporation of Sn into the Pt lattice. Increasing the Sn content to 0.6 wt% resulted in features associated with a Pt3Sn alloy of 39.0° and 45.4° (JCDPS 00-035-1360) and with a PtSn alloy at 41.7° and 44.0° (JCDPS 00-025-0614). Addition of 1.2 wt% Sn decreased the intensity of the Pt3Sn alloy peaks while increasing the intensity of the PtSn alloy peaks. The most heavily Sn-promoted (2.4 wt%) catalyst had peaks at 41.7° and 44.2°, suggesting the presence of PtSn alloy without any detectable Pt3Sn alloy. The overlap of peaks from γ-Al2O3 with those of Pt-Sn alloys prevented the characterization of the alumina-supported catalysts by XRD.

3.1.3. Temperature-programmed reduction
The alumina-supported catalysts were characterized by temperature-programmed reduction as an alternative to XRD (Fig. 2). The samples were probed by TPR after the high temperature oxidative treatment but prior to pre-reduction in H2. The oxidized 1Pt/Al2O3 sample revealed H2 uptake at 444 K which is characteristic of the reduction of PtOx species [16], [55], [56]. The higher temperature feature at 550 K was attributed to either hydrogen spillover on the catalyst support [35], [57] or the reduction of oxychlorinated Pt species that have a strong interaction with the catalyst support [16].

Fig. 2. Temperature-programmed reduction of Al2O3-supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts. Patterns are offset for clarity.
The addition of Sn slightly increased the temperature of the main reduction peak of the PtOx species. Both 0.2 wt% and 0.6 wt% Sn samples have a H2 consumption peak at 459 K, while samples containing 1.2 wt% and 2.4 wt% Sn shift that feature to 473 K. This shift to higher reduction temperature suggests an interaction between Pt and Sn species that increases with higher Sn loadings [55]. The high temperature feature found on the 0.2 wt% Sn sample may be similar to the feature found on the monometallic Pt catalyst, which is attributed to hydrogen spillover or reduction of oxychlorinated species. This high temperature feature becomes much broader as the Sn content increases, with H2 consumption occurring as high as 850 K. Tin species interacting with Pt have been shown to have TPR features between 573 and 673 K [16], [55], [58], with those occurring at 700–850 K being attributed to Sn species interacting with the Al2O3 in the absence of nearby Pt [27], [56].
3.1.4. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy
The DRIFTS spectra of adsorbed CO on SiO2-supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts are shown in Fig. 3A. The 1Pt/SiO2 sample exhibits an intense band at 2067 cm−1 and a weak band at 1780 cm−1 corresponding to linear-bonded CO and bridge-bonded CO, respectively [27], [46], [55], [59]. Addition of a small amount of Sn, as low as 0.2 wt% Sn, eliminated the weak band associated with bridge-bonded CO. Tin also slightly shifted the linear-bonded CO absorption band to 2071 cm−1 possibly indicating a modification of the Pt surface due to the presence of Sn [46]. The complication associated with dipolar coupling of adsorbed CO prevents a definitive conclusion based on line shift. The intensity of the linear-bonded CO band also decreased with increasing Sn content, which is consistent with the CO chemisorption results reported in Table 1.

Fig. 3. DRIFTS spectra of adsorbed CO on (A) SiO2-supported and (B) Al2O3-supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts. Spectra are offset for clarity.
The DRIFTS spectra of adsorbed CO on Al2O3-supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts are shown in Fig. 3B. Similar to the monometallic SiO2-supported Pt catalyst, the 1Pt/Al2O3 sample exhibited both linear- and bridge-bonded CO adsorption with features at 2073 cm−1, 2063 cm−1, and 1783 cm−1. The bands at 2073 cm−1 and 2063 cm−1 are indicative of linear-bonded CO on two different lattice faces of Pt nanoparticles while the peak at 1783 cm−1 is indicative of bridge-bonded CO [46]. Bridge-bonded CO was again eliminated by the addition of 0.2 wt% Sn on Al2O3-supported catalysts. Increasing Sn content also eliminated the primary feature at 2063 cm−1 while the feature at 2073 cm−1 remained, indicating modification to the exposed Pt facets. The linear band at 2073 cm−1 narrowed with increasing Sn content. A band at 2020 cm−1 has been attributed to adsorption on higher-Miller index sites or on Pt sites that interact strongly with the Al2O3 support [46]. Narrowing of the linear-bonded CO feature suggests that the sites corresponding to the feature at 2020 cm−1 are where Sn preferentially adsorbs on Pt/Al2O3. Two new features were observed on the heavily-promoted 2.4 wt% Sn sample at 2010 cm−1 and 1978 cm−1, which perhaps suggests a greater extent of interaction between Pt and Sn on this heavily promoted sample.
3.2. Conversion of propane at constant initial conversion
The conversion of light alkanes to olefins is known to be inhibited by dehydrogenation reaction products [2], [5], [29], [35], [36], [37], [60], [61]. Inhibition of the forward reaction was observed in the present study when varying the reactant flow rate and the catalyst mass over the range of values displayed in Fig. 4. As the extent of product inhibition above propane conversions of 2% was significant, the influence of Sn promotion on the catalyst performance was evaluated under conditions at which the initial conversion was about 2%.

3.2.1. Influence of Sn loading at 2% initial conversion
Fig. 5 compares the normalized rate of propane conversion over (A) SiO2- and (B) Al2O3-supported catalysts with an initial propane conversion of ∼2%. In both sets of materials, the rate of propane dehydrogenation declined rapidly over the first hour followed by a much slower rate of decline. As the Sn content was increased on the silica-supported catalysts, the relative extent of the initial deactivation decreased. The initial deactivation constant decreased from kd = 1.4 h−1 to kd = 0.22 h−1 as the Sn content increased from 0 wt% to 2.4 wt%, indicating a much slower rate of deactivation at early time on stream with Sn loading. The longer term deactivation parameter, D, decreased from 0.66 for Pt/SiO2 to approximately 0 for the 1Pt2.4Sn/SiO2 sample, indicating the highly-promoted catalyst did not deactivate appreciably after the slight initial deactivation. Whereas Sn promoted catalyst stability for the silica-supported Pt, the overall rate of conversion was substantially lowered by the presence of Sn. For example, the rate of propane conversion at 2% conversion over 1Pt/SiO2 and 1Pt2.4Sn/SiO2 was 0.097 and 0.014 molpropane gcat−1 h−1, respectively.

In contrast to Pt-Sn/SiO2, the Sn content did not appear to significantly impact the stability of 1Pt/Al2O3 at Sn weight loadings between 0.2 and 1.2 wt%. The rate of deactivation was slowed on the highly promoted 2.4 wt% Sn catalyst as measured by the decrease in kd from 1.2 h−1 to 0.62 h−1 for 1Pt/Al2O3 and 1Pt2.4Sn/Al2O3, respectively. The longer term deactivation parameter D remained relatively constant at a value of approximately 0.5 as Sn content varied from 0 to 1.2 wt% but decreased to 0.24 for the highly loaded 2.4 wt% Sn sample. The values for kd and D are summarized in Table 2 and the conversion versus time plots can be found in Fig. S1 of the Supplemental Materials. The selectivity to propene was greater than 99% during the propane dehydrogenation results reported in Fig. 5.

Initial conversion was 2%.
3.3. Coke deposition on the catalysts
To explore the level of carbon deposited on the catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, higher initial propane conversions were employed (∼4 to 8%) over catalysts that were not diluted in the reactor. Fig. 6A shows the conversion of propane with time over SiO2-supported Pt-Sn catalysts in the absence of catalyst diluent. The relative stability of the catalysts at higher conversion was similar to that reported at low conversion in Fig. 5A. The monometallic 1Pt/SiO2 deactivated the fastest, converting 8.0% of the propane at 5 min on stream and only 0.20% after 24 h on stream. The coke content after 24 h on stream was measured to be 1 wt% from TPO (Fig. S2). The addition of 0.6 wt% Sn reduced the rate of deactivation, resulting in a conversion of 7.5% at 5 min on stream and 3.3% after 24 h on stream. The amount of coke on this sample was 0.9 wt% which is similar to that on 1Pt/SiO2. The most stable of the three catalysts was promoted by 2.4 wt% Sn, which had 6.2% conversion at 5 min on stream and 5.1% after 24 h on stream. This sample had only 0.3 wt% coke after 24 h.

Fig. 6B shows the conversion of propane over undiluted Al2O3-supported catalysts at higher conversions. The overall trend regarding deactivation was similar to that reported in Fig. 5 at much lower conversions. The 1Pt2.4Sn/Al2O3 catalyst converted 4.1% of the propane at 5 min on stream and 4.7% after 24 h on stream with only 0.6 wt% coke formed after 24 h. The monometallic 1Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a conversion of 7.5% at 5 min on stream and 1.0% after 24 h on stream, producing 2.3 wt% of coke, which is consistent with the greater rate of deactivation. The 1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3 catalyst converted 7.3% of the propane at 5 min on stream and 0.56% after 24 h and produced 2.7 wt% coke. Interestingly, the 1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3 sample deactivated the fastest and produced more coke than the un-promoted 1Pt/Al2O3 sample (Fig. 6B). This may be explained by the presence of very small Pt nanoparticles, as evidenced by the number average particle size standard deviation roughly equal to the average particle size. Smaller Pt nanoparticles possess more steps and kinks, which are suggested to be where deep dehydrogenation reactions occur, and thus produce coke very rapidly with time on stream [47]. As with the silica catalysts, the most highly promoted catalysts deposited the lowest wt% of coke.
3.4. Evolution of metal particle size
The metal particle size of fresh samples and catalysts that had been subjected to 24 h of propane dehydrogenation at 773 K are summarized in Table 3. The monometallic 1Pt/SiO2 and 1Pt/Al2O3 catalysts did not exhibit a signification change in Pt particle size after reaction. In the case of the Sn-promoted SiO2 catalysts, the 0.6 wt% Sn sample increased in number average particle size from 3.8 ± 2.7 nm to 5.1 ± 2.7 nm while the 2.4 wt% Sn sample increased in number average size from 3.4 ± 1.7 nm to 4.5 ± 2.5 nm, despite the observed minimal deactivation of the 2.4 wt% Sn catalyst. For the alumina-supported catalysts, metal particle size was relatively unaffected by 24 h of reaction.

3.5. Regeneration of Pt-Sn catalysts
The performance of the Pt-Sn catalysts following an oxidative treatment to remove coke in situ is compared to that of fresh catalysts in Fig. 7. The regeneration treatment did not significantly impact the initial conversion over 1Pt/SiO2 (5.8% vs 6.9% over fresh catalyst) and 1Pt/Al2O3 (5.0% vs 5.4% over fresh catalyst). However, the oxidative treatment utilized in this study substantially decreased the initial conversion over Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts. For example, the initial conversion over fresh 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2 was 6.6% compared to an initial conversion of 1.5% over the sample after in situ regeneration, which corresponds to a 77% loss in activity. In contrast, the unpromoted Pt catalyst recovered 84% of its initial activity. The overall influence of Sn on the stability of the catalysts as measured by the deactivation parameters kd and D was relatively unaffected by the regeneration procedure (Table 4).

The oxidation state of Sn in the fresh and regenerated 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2 samples was analyzed using XPS (Sn 3d5/2) and the photoemission spectra are shown in Fig. 8. The fresh sample showed two Sn features corresponding to Sn(0) and SnOx, of which approximately 43% was Sn(0). After regeneration, the amount of Sn(0) decreased to 29% and two features corresponding to SnOx species were observed. The decrease in Sn(0) suggests that restructuring of the bimetallic catalyst, presumably by de-alloying of the Pt-Sn particles, occurred during the regeneration procedure. The observed decrease in activity after regeneration was likely caused by additional SnOx species on the Pt surface as evidenced by the increase in Sn/Pt ratio from 2.2 to 2.5 for the fresh and regenerated samples, respectively. An enrichment of the Pt surface with SnOx can physically block Pt sites and depress the observed catalytic activity. The oxidation state of Pt was also evaluated by XPS (Pt 4f7/2) and photoemission spectra are provided in Fig. S3 in the Supplemental Materials. Both fresh and regenerated 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2 were consistent with Pt(0) at 70.6 eV and 70.7 eV, with no features corresponding to PtOx.

The regenerated sample was tested for propane dehydrogenation for 24 and regenerated in situ in flowing synthetic air for 1 h at 773 K followed by reduction in flowing H2 for 2 h at 773 K. After regeneration, the catalyst was then tested for propane dehydrogenation activity for an additional 16 h prior to XPS analysis.
The effect of regeneration conditions on the conversion of propane over Al2O3-supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts is shown in Fig. 7C. Unlike the case with SiO2, the highly promoted 2.4 wt% Sn catalyst on Al2O3 was successfully regenerated without substantial loss of activity. The monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a 93% recovery of the initial activity but its kd increased from 0.85 to 1.6 h−1 as a result of the more rapid deactivation observed post regeneration. The regeneration performance of the low loaded Sn catalyst (1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3) was similar to that of unpromoted Pt/Al2O3.
Representative STEM images used to analyze particle sizes of samples after regeneration can be found in the Supplemental Materials (Fig. S4 (SiO2) and S5 (Al2O3)) and a summary of the particle sizes can be found in Table 3. Minor sintering was observed on the 1Pt/SiO2 sample following reaction and regeneration. The fresh 1Pt/SiO2 had a number average particle size of 3.7 ± 2.1 nm while the regenerated sample was 5.1 ± 3.6 nm, which may partially account for the slight decrease in activity and the more rapid deactivation observed over the regenerated 1Pt/SiO2 catalyst. Additional sintering was observed on the 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2 sample. Reaction and regeneration increased the particle size of all of the Sn-promoted Pt/SiO2 samples investigated (Table3).
In contrast to the silica-supported catalyst, the particle size of the 1Pt2.4/Al2O3 sample actually decreased after oxidative regeneration treatment, presumably by oxidative redispersion. The monometallic 1Pt/Al2O3 and 1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3 experienced little change in metal particle size following reaction and regeneration.
3.6. Pt-Sn catalysts prepared by the polyol method
3.6.1. Physical properties of catalysts
The chemisorption uptakes for the polyol-synthesized catalysts are shown in Table 5. The 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2-P sample had H/Pt and CO/Pt ratios of 0.053 and 0.13, respectively. These chemisorption results are similar to those observed for the 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2 sample synthesized by IWI (Table 1). The hydrogen uptake on 1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3-P resulted in H/Pt = 0.059, which is a low value consistent with the silica-supported sample, but completely different than the 1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3-P prepared by IWI (H/Pt = 0.33). Clearly, the method of preparation is very important when alumina is used as a support. The uptake of CO on 1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3-P gave CO/Pt = 0.51 which is similar to the analogous catalyst prepared by IWI.

The XRD pattern for the 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2-P sample is given in Fig. S6 in the Supplemental Materials. Peaks associated with Pt3Sn alloy (39.0° and 45.3°) and PtSn alloy (41.8° and 44.1°) were present in the pattern, which is consistent with the alloys detected by XRD in the analogous sample prepared by IWI (Fig. 1).
Temperature-programmed reduction of the 1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3-P catalyst shown in Fig. S7 of the Supplemental Materials revealed two major hydrogen uptake features at ∼360 K and ∼510 K. The feature at ∼510 K is similar to that observed on the Al2O3-supported catalysts prepared by IWI and is attributed to Pt and Pt-Sn reduction [16], [55]. The low temperature feature at ∼360 K is thought to result from reduction of surface oxide or chemisorbed oxygen on Pt that was previously reduced during the polyol synthesis process.
The adsorption of CO on polyol-synthesized catalysts evaluated by DRIFTS is shown in Fig. S8 of the Supplemental Materials. The 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2-P sample displayed a single band at 2064 cm−1 corresponding to linearly adsorbed CO and the intensity of the band was an order of magnitude lower than that observed on the IWI-synthesized 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 3A). The 1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3-P also showed a single band attributed to linear-bonded CO at 2070 cm−1 and the intensity of the feature on this Al2O3-supported polyol catalyst was an order of magnitude lower than that associated with CO on the IWI-synthesized 1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3 sample (Fig. 3B).
3.6.2. Conversion of propane over polyol-synthesized PtSn catalysts
Fig. 10A shows the conversion of propane over both fresh and in situ-regenerated 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2-P. The initial conversion over the fresh catalyst was 8.7% prior to deactivating to 6.7% conversion at 0.83 h on stream, resulting in a kd of 0.34 h−1. As the analogous IWI-synthesized 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2 catalyst exhibited a kd = 0.92 h−1 (Table 2), apparently the polyol synthesis method improved the initial catalyst stability. Moreover, the 0.6 wt% Sn SiO2-polyol catalyst remained relatively stable on stream for 24 h without exhibiting longer term deactivation. Interestingly, the conversion slowly increased after 3 h on stream. After 24 h the catalyst was subjected to our standard regeneration treatment in situ and re-evaluated for activity. The regenerated catalyst converted 3.2% of the propane initially, which is a 63% decrease in the initial conversion rate compared to the fresh catalyst. As with the catalysts prepared by IWI, we attribute the irreversible loss in catalyst activity to de-alloying and surface enrichment of SnOx. Since the deactivation of the regenerated sample was negligible, no deactivation coefficient kd can be reported for the regenerated 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2-P catalyst. Examination of the sample after regeneration did not reveal any significant change in metal particle size (3.1 nm vs 3.4 nm as reported in Table 6).

Fig. 10B displays the conversion of propane during 24 h over the fresh and in situ-regenerated 1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3-P catalyst. The calculated deactivation parameters kd and D of the fresh polyol-synthesized alumina-supported catalyst were 1.7 h−1 and 0.78, respectively, but changed to 2.4 h−1 and 0.73 after regeneration. The average particle size was reduced to 2.2 ± 0.9 nm following regeneration (Table 6).
3.7. Propane conversion with co-fed H2
3.7.1. Influence of Sn promoter on propene selectivity
The influence of Sn promotion on the product selectivity in the presence of co-fed H2 was explored utilizing the 1Pt/Al2O3 and 1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3-P catalysts (Fig. 11A). In the absence of co-fed H2, the selectivity to propene was >99% over all catalysts, with the lone exceptions being the monometallic Pt catalysts at 5 min on stream. The selectivity to propene in the aforementioned exceptions was still >98% for those initial conversion points. In contrast, the presence of co-fed H2 decreased the selectivity to propene over the 1Pt/Al2O3 sample when the initial conversion was ∼4% or greater (Fig. 11), producing methane, ethane, and ethene as side products. The addition of Sn to Pt has been suggested to improve the selectivity to propene during propane dehydrogenation by diluting large Pt ensembles that are required for hydrogenolysis [2], [29], [61]. Indeed, the presence of Sn improved the selectivity to propene even in the presence of co-fed H2 (Fig. 11A). Hydrogenolysis products were not detected over the 1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3-P at conversions below ∼7%. The selectivity to propene at 11.8% conversion over the promoted catalyst was >98%, which is an improvement compared to the 92% propene selectivity at 11.3% conversion over 1Pt/Al2O3. Interestingly, selectivity to propene increased with time on stream over 1Pt/Al2O3 (Fig. 11B), which suggests that trace amounts of coke deposited on Pt promote propene selectivity, presumably by disrupting the large ensembles of Pt needed to catalyze hydrogenolysis.

The H2:propane:N2 ratio was 1:2:5 at a total pressure of 0.1 MPa.
3.7.2. Catalytic rate
Co-fed H2 decreased the rate of coke formation and thus improved catalyst stability during propane dehydrogenation, allowing for the quantification of catalytic rates [5], [37]. Thus, the conversion and site time yield (STY, normalized by CO/Pt) of propene over Pt/SiO2 and Pt-Sn/SiO2 in the presence of co-fed H2 is shown in Fig. 12. The initial STY of Pt/SiO2 was about 3 s−1 based on Pt dispersion evaluated from CO chemisorption. For comparison, Barias et al. report an initial turnover frequency for propane dehydrogenation of 1 s−1 at 792 K and 0.3 bar propane over their synthesized Pt/SiO2, which compares very well to the current study [62]. Moreover, the turnover rate for isobutane dehydrogenation over Pt/SiO2 at 773 K as reported by Stagg et al. was about 3 s−1, albeit at a partial pressure of hydrocarbon that was 2.7 times that used in the current work [30]. Although a Weisz-Prater analysis (see Supplemental Material) indicates the most active Pt/SiO2 catalyst may be slightly affected by transport limitations during propane dehydrogenation in H2, the lower observed rates over the Sn-promoted catalysts and those catalysts that have undergone deactivation are clearly free from transport artifacts.

The reaction temperature was 773 K at 0.1 MPa total pressure. Total catalyst loading and flow rates were varied to adjust the conversion. The H2:propane:N2 ratio was 1:2:5.
The STY of the two bimetallic catalysts in Fig. 12 appeared to be impacted by their respective synthesis methods. The polyol-synthesized catalyst exhibited initial activity less than half that of the monometallic catalyst. In contrast, the IWI-synthesized 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2 sample had an initial STY 40% higher than the monometallic catalyst. Despite similar H/Pt and CO/Pt ratio observed on the 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2 catalysts, the observed initial STY differed by a factor of 3.4.
4. Discussion
4.1. Influence of catalyst support and Sn loading
4.1.1. SiO2 support
Hydrogen chemisorption was inhibited by increasing the Sn content on Pt/SiO2, and this inhibition has been attributed to the disruption of Pt ensembles by Sn [63]. The dissociative adsorption of H2, which is required for hydrogen chemisorption, requires adjacent Pt sites and can be inhibited by the formation of Pt-Sn alloys or by SnOx surface species blocking these pairwise ensembles. Interestingly, CO chemisorption was not inhibited by Pt-Sn to the same extent as observed with hydrogen chemisorption. For example, the H/Pt and CO/Pt ratios on the 1Pt2.4Sn/SiO2 sample were 0.3% and 3%, respectively. The disparity between the chemisorption results on this heavily promoted sample suggests disruption of Pt ensembles because CO chemisorption can occur on isolated Pt surface sites while hydrogen chemisorption may not. Furthermore, charge donation from Sn to Pt has been reported previously and will alter the electronic structure of Pt [63]. This so-called ligand effect may also influence the chemisorption of hydrogen as the dissociative adsorption of H2 on Pt-Sn alloys can become a more activated process compared to Pt alone. A third alternative for the difference between H/Pt and CO/Pt on the silica-supported samples is CO induced surface segregation of Pt during the chemisorption experiment. The chemisorption of CO on Pt-Sn alloys has also been reported to be influenced by a ligand effect which can reduce the total uptake [64]. Some researchers report that the observed CO uptake on Pt-Sn catalyst is in fact only attributed to unalloyed Pt [30]. Therefore, the chemisorption results in the present study suggest that a high degree of alloy formation is possible when weak metal-support interactions are present and can lead to a significant decrease in probe molecule uptake.
Computational modeling has suggested Pt-Sn alloys can improve the stability of propane dehydrogenation activity while decreasing the catalyst activity by increasing the barrier for dissociative adsorption of propane [31]. Alloys with greater Sn contents (i.e. Pt2Sn or PtSn2) have been proposed to exhibit lower activity compared to Pt3Sn alloy and unalloyed Pt [31]. Indeed, XRD characterization reported here showed that as the Sn content is increased on SiO2-supported catalysts, the PtSn content increased while Pt3Sn content decreased until only PtSn alloy was present at 2.4 wt% Sn loading (Fig. 1). The trend in the normalized rate of propane conversion over SiO2-supported catalysts (Fig. 5) supports the idea that Pt-Sn alloy formation improves stability while decreasing activity. In Fig. 5, similar catalyst loadings were used to achieve approximately 2% initial conversion for the 0.6 wt% Sn catalyst and the 1.2 wt% Sn catalyst. However, the rate differed by a factor of ∼2 with observed rates over 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2 and 1Pt1.2Sn/SiO2 equal to 0.28 and 0.13 molpropane gcat−1 h−1, respectively. The 2.4 wt% Sn catalyst only showed features indicative of the PtSn alloy, exhibited the most stable activity, but exhibited the lowest rate at 0.014 molpropane gcat−1 h−1.
The relative amount of coke formed on each catalyst also decreased with increasing Sn content. Tin is known to inhibit the side reactions leading to coke formation and can also help coke precursors migrate from Pt sites to the catalyst support [2], [7]. It is speculated that the similar amount of coke on the 0.6 wt% Sn catalyst compared to 1Pt/SiO2 indicates that the coke resides on the SiO2 surface instead of on the Pt sites due to the coke precursor mobility of Sn-promoted catalysts. The total amount of coke was actually highest on the 1Pt2.4Sn/SiO2 despite having the lowest relative amount of coke (wt%). The disconnect between relative and total amount of coke arises from the total amount of catalyst in the reactor. A total of 250 mg of 1Pt2.4Sn/SiO2 was used in Fig. 6, compared to 50 mg of 1Pt/SiO2. The higher amount of silica support and sustained reactivity in the 2.4 wt% Sn sample allows for more coke precursors to be captured by the support over 24 h on stream.
Attempts to regenerate the bimetallic SiO2-supported catalysts proved to be unsuccessful. The XPS results from regenerated 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2 suggest that some Sn de-alloyed from the bimetallic particles and migrated to the Pt nanoparticle surface and support surface, as evidenced by the increase in Sn/Pt surface ratio from 2.2 to 2.5 post-regeneration. These results are consistent with those reported by Xie et al. who demonstrated that Pt-Sn/C forms Pt-Sn alloy after reduction but de-alloys and phase segregates following the aqueous phase oxidation of 1,6-hexanediol [53]. Freakley et al. observed a similar enrichment of SnOx on Pd nanoparticle surfaces following a calcination-reduction treatment which was attributed to a stronger affinity between SnOx and Pd than between the SnOx and TiO2 support [65].
Interestingly, the CO DRIFTS results do not indicate an obvious electronic effect for Pt-Sn/SiO2, which is similar to results reported previously [44]. The lack of influence of Sn on the IR peak position of adsorbed CO may suggest that the CO DRIFTS actually probes only the unalloyed fraction of surface Pt. Nevertheless, results from chemisorption and XRD as well as the observed decrease in dehydrogenation activity of Sn-promoted Pt/SiO2 indicate a significant interaction between Pt and Sn on silica.
4.1.2. Al2O3 support
Similar to the SiO2-supported catalysts, the bimetallic Al2O3-supported catalysts exhibited a decrease in H/Pt with the addition of Sn. However, the CO chemisorption uptake did not appear to be impacted to the same extent as the hydrogen chemisorption. The discrepancy between H and CO uptake can therefore be attributed to a geometric promotion of Pt and the absence of electronic effects that may result from Pt-Sn alloy formation [30], [64]. Additionally, Deng et al. observed a decrease in the reduction temperature when Pt/Al2O3 was promoted with Sn and was attributed to the donation of electrons from SnOx [24]. In the present study, an increase in the reduction temperature was observed for Pt-Sn/Al2O3 relative to an unpromoted sample, which may suggest a lack of significant electronic interactions between SnOx and Pt nanoparticles.
The majority of the Sn likely resided on the Al2O3 surface due to its strong interaction with the support material instead of on the Pt nanoparticle surface [2], [4], [5], [45], [46], [56], [66]. The CO DRIFTS results (Fig. 3B) on the alumina-supported catalysts suggest that any Sn on the Pt surface resides on higher Miller index sites such as the steps and kinks, as evidenced by the narrowing on the linear adsorption band [46].
In contrast to the SiO2-supported catalysts, an improvement in catalyst stability (Fig. 5B) was only observed at the relatively high 2.4 wt% Sn loading. This 1Pt2.4Sn/Al2O3 sample was also the only one examined to exhibit bands for linear-adsorbed CO at 2010 and 1978 cm−1, which suggested a higher degree of interaction between the Pt and Sn species. Such interaction is consistent with the improved catalyst stability observed even at higher conversions (Fig. 6B). A higher Sn content was shown to reduce coke formation on the 2.4 wt% Sn catalyst and thus improve the catalyst stability, which was consistent with the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts. Recent work by Pham et al. has suggested that the deactivation of Al2O3-supported PtSn catalysts may be due to particle sintering in addition to coke formation [4]. It appears that the relative coke content after 24 h on stream observed in our work correlated well with the observed deactivation trends while sintering played a minor role in the extent of deactivation under the reaction conditions used in this study.
The widely utilized Oleflex industrial propane dehydrogenation process is known to utilize a Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst system [2]. The contrast between the ability to regenerate Pt-Sn on SiO2 compared to Al2O3 highlights one of the reasons why Al2O3 is utilized in the industrial process. Regeneration of all three of the examined Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts resulted in recovery of the catalytic activity as well as redispersion of Pt-Sn nanoparticles (Table 3, Table 6). Pham et al. demonstrated that Sn can act as a nucleation site for Pt redispersion during regeneration, aiding in the recovery of catalytic activity [4]. This explains the unique activity and particle size change observed on the 1Pt2.4Sn/Al2O3 and 1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3-P samples after regeneration.
4.2. Influence of synthesis method
The polyol synthesis method has been demonstrated to produce monodisperse bimetallic nanoparticles [49], [67] and our results reported in Table 6 are consistent with those reports. For example, the fresh 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2-P sample had an average particle size of 3.1 ± 1.5 nm whereas the fresh 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2 prepared via traditional incipient wetness impregnation had an average particle size of 3.8 ± 2.7 nm. The greater standard deviation associated with catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation is indicative of a wider distribution of particle sizes than the sample prepared by the polyol synthesis method.
A second advantage of the polyol synthesis method is the creation of bimetallic precursor particles in solution prior to depositing them on the support. Therefore, the Pt-Sn interaction can be achieved before the affinity of the supports for Sn affects the formation of bimetallic particles. Reactivity results of the polyol-synthesized silica-supported catalysts were consistent with a more extensive interaction between Pt and Sn than an analogous sample prepared by standard impregnation of metal precursors. Unfortunately, oxidative regeneration of 1Pt0.6Sn/SiO2-P irreversibly deactivated the catalyst, presumably by de-alloying the Pt particles.
The chemisorption results suggest that Pt is substantially unalloyed on alumina despite preforming the bimetallic nanoparticles through colloidal synthesis. Indeed, the strong interaction of Sn with the alumina support ultimately resulted in promoted catalysts that were similar in performance regardless of preparation method. The oxidative regeneration of 1Pt0.6Sn/Al2O3-P (Fig. 10B) was very similar to the analogous catalyst prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (Fig. 7C). This suggests that a major role of Sn promoters on alumina is to act as nucleation sites for the redispersion of Pt during oxidative regeneration [4]. At high Sn loadings, Sn interactions with Pt are more substantial resulting in a decrease in the rate of coke formation and more stable catalytic activity [68].
5. Conclusion
The reactivity of SiO2- and Al2O3-supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is affected by the strength of interaction of Sn with Pt relative to the support. Low weight loadings of Sn were much less effective at promoting propene selectivity and stability of Pt/Al2O3 than Pt/SiO2 during propane dehydrogenation because of the high affinity of Sn species for the alumina. The primary factor influencing catalyst deactivation was the deposition of coke, regardless of the support. In contrast to the alumina-supported catalysts, oxidative regeneration of SiO2-supported catalysts caused irreversible loss of activity attributed to the segregation of SnOx species to the surfaces of the bimetallic particles. Although preforming bimetallic particles via a colloidal synthesis method achieved a narrower particle size distribution, the performance of the catalyst was still correlated with the interaction of metals with the support.
