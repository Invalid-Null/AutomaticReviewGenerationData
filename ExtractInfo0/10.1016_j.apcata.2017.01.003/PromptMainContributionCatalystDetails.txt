1. Introduction
Ethylene and propylene are vital components in the petrochemical industry to produce many chemical intermediates such as ethylene oxide, ethylene dichloride, propylene oxide, cumene, methyl methacrylate, phenol, and polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene. Propylene is mainly produced as a byproduct from ethylene steam cracking plants and fluid catalytic cracking units (FCC) [1]. However, on-purpose propylene production processes such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), metathesis, methanol to olefin (MTO), methanol to propylene (MTP) and olefins cracking (C4–C8 olefins) [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] are gaining importance. Among them, catalytic cracking of higher olefins to light olefins has a significant interest in both refining and petrochemical industries.
Zhu et al. [8] investigated a number of zeolites (Y, Beta, MCM-22, ZSM-5, ZSM-22, ZSM-23, ZSM-35 and SAPO-34) for catalytic cracking of C4 olefins to produce propylene and ethylene. It was observed that the zeolite pore structure and zeolite acidity have significant effects on the cracking performance and product distribution. The highest conversions (above 95%) were achieved by Y, Beta, MCM-22 and ZSM-5 because of their large pore diameters and higher amount of acid sites. Although ZSM-5 and SAPO-34 have a high amount of acid sites, the smaller pore diameter and weak external acid sites of latter, lowered the conversion to 83% [9]. Catalyst stability was one of the important factors for assessing the catalyst performance along with the activity and the selectivity. ZSM-5 showed the best stability among all the eight tested catalysts and this is due to its 10-membered oxygen ring which prevents aromatics formation. Moreover, its intersection between the channels lowers the probability of pore blocking. Lu et al. [10] showed that increasing the Si/Al ratio (ZSM-5) will reduce the acidity of the catalyst and hence reduce side reactions (hydrogen transfer reaction) which yield aromatics and alkanes.
Further studies have been conducted on zeolites including modifications of ZSM-5 in order to enhance activity, propylene selectivity and hydrothermal stability. Phosphorous and HNO3 have been used to modify ZSM-5 to study the effect of the acid strength on propylene selectivity [11], [12], [13]. Phosphorous and HNO3 reduced the amount of strong acid sites, thereby increasing propylene selectivity, which indicates that catalytic performance could be controlled by using distribution of acid strength. Eplede et al. [14], [15] used K and P to modify ZSM-5 to increase the yield of propylene. They suggested that treatment with K affected the distribution of acid strength and led to higher propylene yield by inhibiting the side reactions of hydrogen transfer and aromatization. Li et al. [16] used Fe to modify P-ZSM-5 and studied the effect of this modification on the catalyst acidity. It was found that Fe addition led to little change in catalyst acidity. However, iron addition led to increased surface area and basicity (which suppress hydrogen transfer reactions) of the catalyst resulting in higher propylene selectivity. The phosphorous modification was done on HITQ-13 zeolites by Zeng et al. [17]. The surface area, crystallinity and pore volume of PITQ-13 were reduced when compared to the HITQ-13. The acid strength distribution was changed with increasing the number of the weak acid sites and decreasing the number of strong acid sites. When using 1.0 wt% P in PITQ-13-2 the propylene yield was 41.5% and the ethylene yield was 15.7%, but information about stability was not provided. Zhao et al. [18] showed P/E ratio of 0.8–5.8 for 1-butene cracking by silanization of silanes with hydroxyl groups using catalytic cracking of silane processes. However, 1-butene conversion was lowered to 58.8 mol% at P/E ratio of about 5.8.
Recently, we have reported that silicate-1 is an efficient catalyst for propylene production from 1-butene due to the absence of strong acid sites and the presence of weak acid sites [19]. It was inferred that the silanol groups act as the weak acid sites (Brønsted sites) above 300 °C, but it is still not known which type of silanol group is responsible for the cracking. The yield of alkenes other than n-butenes was 60 C-wt%, while the propylene yield was 34.1 C-wt% at 550 °C over silicate-1.
In our present study, ZSM-5 zeolite was modified using CLD and core-shell composite method to reduce the strong acid sites as well as external surface acidity. The modified ZSM-5 was used as catalyst for 1-butene cracking and the observed results are discussed.

Silica coating on ZSM-5 zeolites with a different SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 23, 80 and 280 was carried out using chemical liquid deposition (CLD) method [20]. Before silica coating, the zeolite materials were calcined at 550 °C for 4 h at 5 °C/min. In a typical coating procedure (Scheme S1), 10 g of parent zeolite was suspended in 100 ml of n-hexane solvent and the mixture was heated until reflux at 70 °C. After 30 min of stirring, the TEOS solution corresponding to a loading of 4 wt% SiO2 was added and silylation lasted for 2 h at 70 °C accompanied by reflux and stirring. Then the sample was dried in a vacuum in order to remove excess n-hexane. Finally, the catalyst was dried at 100 °C for 24 h and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h, with a 5 °C/min heating rate. After each TEOS deposition 2 g of catalysts were taken from a batch and subjected to physicochemical characterization and catalyst activity test. Silylation treatment was carried out six times using the same procedure and the samples obtained after third and sixth cycles were denoted as shown in Table 1.
Core-shell silicalite composite [21], [22] was synthesized using SiO2/Al2O3 ratio 280 (Scheme S1). The parent material was mixed with gel composition of 1 SiO2:0.08 TPABr: 0.1–2.0 NH4F: 20 H2O. The ratio of parent material and silica in the gel was about 1:2 for HZ-280-CS(1X). HZ-280-CS(1X) composite was prepared using tetra propyl ammonium bromide as structure directing agent and ammonium fluoride as mineralizer. In a typical synthesis procedure, 6 g of HZ-280 zeolite was mixed well with silicalite-1 gel prepared using the following molar composition of the gel: 1 SiO2:0.08 TPABr: 1.6 NH4F: 20 H2O. The mixed gel was subjected to a hydrothermal process at 200 °C for 2 days. The obtained solid sample was then washed with deionized water, filtered, dried and calcined at 550 °C for 6 h. HZ-280-CS(2X) composite was prepared using 6 g of HZ-280-CS(1X) mixed well with silicalite-1 gel prepared using the following molar composition of the gel 1 SiO2: 0.08 TPABr: 1.6 NH4F: 20H2O. This was subjected to a hydrothermal process at 200 °C for 2 days. The sample was then washed with deionized water, filtered, dried and calcined at 550 °C for 6 h.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
The zeolite samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) with a Rigaku Mini-flex II system using nickel-filtered CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å, 30 kV and 15 mA). XRD patterns were obtained in static scanning mode from 1.2–50° (2q) while the angular speed of the detector was 2° min−1 with the size of the step of 0.02°. The surface area of the catalyst samples was measured by nitrogen adsorption at −195 °C with Autosorb-1 (Quanta Chrome) using BET equation. For SEM images, the samples were loaded on the sample holder, held with conductive aluminum tape and coated with a film of gold in a vacuum with cressington sputter ion-coater for 20 s with 15 mA current. SEM of images of the gold-coated samples was captured with a JEOL JSM-5800 scanning microscope at a magnification of 7000. FT-IR spectra of the samples were measured to identify the silanol groups present in the catalysts. The thin wafer of catalyst sample was prepared and then transferred to an in-situ cell (Makuhari Rikagaku Garasu Inc., Japan) for pretreatment under vacuum (ca. 2 × 10−1 Pa) at 450 °C for 1 h. All spectra measurements were performed at room temperature with Nicolet FT-IR spectrometer (Magna 500 model).
Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia was conducted using thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). 25 mg catalyst sample was taken in a crucible and it was pretreated at 500 °C under a helium flow for 60 min. Then it was exposed to 5% ammonia in He at 100 °C for 15 min. Excess ammonia adsorbed was flushed by helium stream for 30 min at 100 °C. The desorption of ammonia was monitored using TGA from 100 °C to 600 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1. The external surface acidity of the zeolite was measured by cracking of 1,3,5 triisopropyl benzene (TIPB) using a fluidized-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. The detailed description about the riser simulator can be found elsewhere [23]. The experiments were performed with 0.81 g of catalyst and 200 μl of TIPB at 550 °C for 20 s. The conversion of TIPB was found to be 51.37%, 14.09%, 0.71% for catalyst HZ-280, HZ-280-CLD(6X) and HZ-280-CS(2X), respectively.
2.4. Reaction procedures
The evaluation of the catalytic performance was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor packed with 2 ml of the catalysts with the size of the particle between 0.5 mm to 1.0 mm diameter. A pretreatment of the catalyst with nitrogen at 550 °C was performed for 1 h and then a mixture of the 1-butene and nitrogen (5 ml/min and 25 ml/min, respectively) (GHSV = 900 h−1) was passed through the catalyst bed at 550 °C. The products were analyzed by on-line GC equipped with a GS-Gaspro column together with a flame ionization detector (FID).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
XRD patterns of ZSM-5 and modified ZSM-5 catalysts are presented in Fig. 1. All samples show the characteristic peaks of ZSM-5 structure in the ranges 2θ = 7–10° and 22–25° as reported in the literature [24], [25], [26]. Due to the difference in crystal growth, the relative intensity of diffraction peaks was different depending on the sample. The peak at 2θ = 7.9 is a superposition of the diffractions from (−1 0 1), (0 1 1) and (1 0 1) faces. The peak observed at 2θ = 8 × 9 is superposition of the diffraction from (0 2 0), (2 0 0), (−1 1 1) and (1 1 1) faces. The d spacing values for all the catalyst are presented in Table 1.

The nitrogen adsorption isotherms for the parent as well modified ZSM-5 samples were recorded (Fig. 2), and the total surface areas are presented in Table 1. The BET surface area was slightly decreased for HZ-23-CLD(3X)and HZ-23-CLD(6X) as compared to catalyst HZ-23. The decrease in a surface area related to continuous external surface passivation by chemical liquid deposition using tetraethylorthosilicate. A similar trend was also observed for HZ-80-CLD(3X), HZ-80-CLD(6X), HZ-280-CLD(3X) and HZ-280-CLD(6X). Upon silica deposition, the micropore volume of the catalyst was also decreased as shown in Table 2. However, catalysts HZ-280-CS(1X) and HZ-280-CS(2X), synthesized using core-shell method retained the BET surface area of parent materials.

Fig. 3 shows the FT-IR spectra in the –OH stretching region for HZ-280, HZ-280-CLD(6X), HZ-280-CS(2X), and HZ-1500. All tested catalysts show a band at 3745 cm−1, assigned to the terminal silanol groups. In the case of HZ-280-CLD(6X), prepared using CLD method, the intensity of terminal silanol group was decreased as compared to the parent material as well as HZ-280-CS(2X) catalyst [27]. A band at 3610 cm−1 is assigned to the presence of Bronsted acid sites and was observed for HZ-280. The peak intensity was lowered for HZ-280-CLD(6X) and HZ-280-CS(2X) as compared to parent HZ-280. This clearly indicates that the concentration of Bronsted acid sites was reduced by the CLD and core-shell synthesis method.

TPD profiles of desorbed ammonia are presented in Fig. 4. Two peaks appeared for ZSM-5 zeolites. The peaks at a higher temperature correspond to the ammonia desorbed from the acid sites of zeolites. The peaks appearing at a lower temperature were assigned to ammonia molecules adsorbed either on NH4+ species formed on Brønsted acid sites or on Na+ cations [28]. From the areas of the peaks at a higher temperature, the number of acid sites was estimated and given in Table 1. As expected, the number of acid sites increased with a decrease in Si/Al ratio of H-ZSM-5 zeolites. No desorption peaks were observed for core-shell silicalite composite HZ-280-CS(1X) and HZ-280-CS(2X). In the case of catalyst prepared by CLD method, the increase in silica deposition cycles, decreased the total acidity of the resulting materials as shown in Table 1. The weakly adsorbing ammonia sites were 0.06 and 0.05 mmol g−1 for HZ-280-CLD(6X) and HZ-1500, respectively.

SEM images of HZ-23, HZ-80, HZ-280, HZ-280-CLD(6X), HZ-280-CS(1X) and HZ-280-CS(2X) are shown in Fig. 5. The particles size was increased with increase in the Si/Al ratio. The image for H-ZSM-5 showed relatively large quadrangular prism-like crystallites. After silica deposition by the CLD method, HZ-280-CLD(6X) does not show any change in crystal size. However, HZ-280-CS(1X) and HZ-280-CS(2X) synthesized by core-shell method showed an increase in the crystal size as compared with catalyst HZ-280. The crystal size of HZ-280-CS(1X) and HZ-280-CS(2X) was increased at least 3 times as compared to the parent material. The crystal size of HZ-280-CS(2X) was slightly increased as compared to HZ-280-CS(1X).

3.2. Catalytic reactions
3.2.1. Reaction of 1-butene
In the catalytic reaction, more than 20 hydrocarbons were produced. These products were classified into eleven groups according to the expected reaction mechanism. These groups were; 1-butene (reactant), cis- and trans-2-butene, propylene (target product), ethylene, iso-butene, pentenes, hexenes, alkanes (C1-C6), aromatics (BTEX), and hydrocarbons with carbon number more than 8 (C8+, aromatics other than benzene, toluene, xylenes, and ethylbenzene, alkanes and alkenes; oligomerization and hydrogen transfer products). The summarized products are plotted against the reaction temperature in Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8 for HZ-280, HZ-280-CLD(6X) and HZ-280-CS(2X), respectively. The yield of propylene and ethylene at 550 °C with modified ZSM-5 catalysts are presented in Fig. 9, and Table 3 summarizes the dependence of the detailed product distribution on the catalyst formulation.

The parent HZ-23, which has both strong and weak acid sites showed higher amount of aromatics and C8+ as main products. The aromatics yield was lowered, when the Si/Al molar ratio of catalyst was increased from 23 to 1500 (HZ-23–HZ-1500). This clearly shows that the formation of aromatics by hydrogen transfer reactions required strong acid sites. Upon continuous silica deposition by CLD method over catalyst HZ-23, the amount of aromatics was decreased due to the reduction of strong acid sites as evident from acidity measurements. The suppression of hydrogen transfer increased the amount of ethylene and propylene for HZ-23-CLD(6X) as compared to HZ-23-CLD(3X) and HZ-23. Similar observation was made for silica deposited catalysts HZ-80-CLD(3X), HZ-80-CLD(6X), HZ-280-CLD(3X) and HZ-280-CLD(6X). It has been reported [29], [30] that the transformation of 1-butene involves two successive steps to produce propylene, i.e., dimerization of butenes and cracking of octene isomers. The C4= molecules adsorb on acid sites of the catalysts to form a [C4]+ carbenium ion, which can react with another C4= molecule to form the [C8]+ carbenium intermediate. This unstable intermediate is cracked to form propylene molecule and a [C5]+ carbenium ion via ß-scission mechanism [31], [32]. The [C5]+ carbenium ion can further crack to propylene and ethylene or can desorb as C5 hydrocarbons. The [C8]+ carbenium intermediate can also produce aromatics by dehydro-cyclization. Apart from this, the [C8]+ carbenium ion can further oligomerize with a C4= molecule to form [C12]+ carbenium ion. The [C12]+ carbenium ion can then be converted to low molecular hydrocarbons by cracking/aromatization reactions. The commercially available ZSM-5 catalyst with SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 1500 (HZ-1500) showed the yield of propylene and ethylene about 31.62% and 8.84% at 550 °C, respectively. However, the formation of isobutene (skeletal isomerization) was more for HZ-1500 as compared to other catalysts (19.77%). The highest P/E ratio of 3.58 was observed for HZ-1500.
Over catalyst HZ-280 (Fig. 6), double bond isomerization mainly occurred in the temperature range 150–200 °C. At 250 °C, the main products were alkenes (including propylene) and C8+. As the reaction temperature increased to 350 °C, the formation of alkenes was reduced dramatically, and the formation of alkanes and aromatics became dominant. However, as the temperature was further increased, the formations of alkenes, including propylene, gradually increased in the temperature range 350–550 °C, The percentage of propylene and ethylene over HZ-280 increased with the reaction temperature up to 550 °C to reach 21.88% and 18.58% at 550 °C, respectively. The yield of propylene and ethylene over HZ-280-CLD(6X) increased with the reaction temperature and to reach 26.37% and 20.07% at 550 °C, respectively (Fig. 7). HZ-280-CLD(3X) and HZ-280-CLD(6X) showed almost similar activity. This showed that triplicate deposition of silica on HZ-280 is sufficient and further deposition does not enhance the catalyst activity.
Core-shell silicalite composite catalyst HZ-280-CS(2X) (Fig. 8) showed double bond isomerization mainly occurred in the temperature range 150–200 °C. At 250 °C, the main products were 1-butene and 2-butene isomers with very small percentages of other alkenes. As the temperature increased to 300 °C, the formation of alkenes became predominant, and the formations of alkanes and C8+ were limited to small percentages. Further increase in reaction temperature to 550 °C, the yield of propylene and ethylene reached a maximum of 41.44% and 13.82%, respectively. Aromatics were not formed over HZ-280-CS(2X) in the temperature range from 150 to 550 °C, as this requires strong acid sites for hydrogen transfer reactions. The presence of silanol groups which act as weak acid sites at higher temperatures results in high propylene yield [19]. It is known that four types of silanol groups such as terminal silanol, geminal silanol, vicinal silanol and nest silanol are present on the surface of silicalite-1. The strength of these silanol groups was reported as terminal < germinal < vicinal < nest [33], [34]. Nest silanol groups are recognized to be active sites for an acid-catalyzed reaction of Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime to ε-caprolactam [33], [34], [35]. In our previous study [19], we treated silicalite-1 with HCl to dealuminate and with NH3 to enrich the surface silanol groups. The propylene yield was increased by NH3 treatment and decreased by HCl treatment, clearly, indicated that surface silanol groups act as active sites. In our present study, core-shell composite synthesis using silicalite-1 result in enrichment of silanols groups and on the other hand leads to a decrease in strong acid sites was observed from FT-IR study (Fig. 3). Apart from weak acid sites, the presence external surface acidity of HZ-280-CS(2X) was much lower as compared to catalyst HZ-280 and HZ-280-CLD(6X) as evident from TIPB cracking reaction. The formation of ethylene was lowered for catalyst HZ-280-CS(2X) as compared to catalyst HZ-280, HZ-280-CLD(3X), HZ-280-CLD(6X) and HZ-280-CS(1X). The presence of more isomerized product in HZ-280-CS(2X) showed that direct cracking of 1-butene to ethylene was lowered. Similar observation was made for HZ-280-CS(2X) and HZ-1500, as catalyst HZ-1500 showed only 8.84% of ethylene yield with higher isomerized product yield 36.26%.
3.2.2. Other side reactions
The formation of alkanes, aromatics, and isomerization products for catalyst HZ-280, HZ-280-CLD(3X), HZ-280-CLD(6X), HZ-280-CS(1X), HZ-280-CS(2X) and HZ-1500 was shown in Fig. 10. In our previous study [19], we found that by increasing the Si/Al molar ratio from 23 to 280 the formation of aromatic and alkanes was decreased and the yield of isomerization products was increased. We observe the similar trend for HZ-280, HZ-280-CLD(3X), HZ-280-CLD(6X), HZ-280-CS(1X), HZ-280-CS(2X) and HZ-1500. In the case of HZ-280-CLD(3X) to HZ-280-CS(2X), the formation of alkanes and aromatic was lowered as compared to parent material (HZ-280). This shows that surface modification by both CLD and core-shell silicalite composite method decreases the amount of acid sites, which reduces the formation of alkanes and aromatics by hydrogen transfer reactions. The formation of isomerization products both double bond isomerization and skeletal isomerization was increased from catalyst HZ-280 < HZ-280-CLD(3X) < HZ-280-CLD(6X) < HZ-280-CS(1X) < HZ-280-CS(2X) < HZ-1500. Based on the observed results, possible reaction pathway leading to the formation of alkenes, alkanes and aromatics was presented in Scheme 1. The presence of strong acid sites in the catalyst influences the formation of aromatics and alkanes due to hydrogen transfer reactions, where as weak acid sites leading to lower olefins formation.

3.2.3. Effect of external/internal mass transfer limitations
The external mass transfer resistance measured using the Sherwood number from the Foressling’s correlation [36]:
Where:
Sh: Sherwood number,
Sc: Schmidt number,
Re: Reynolds number,
kc: The external mass transfer co-efficient (m/s),
DAB: Molecular diffusivity of 1-butene in carrier gas nitrogen (m2/s), subscript A is used for 1-butene and B is using for nitrogen,
dp: The particle diameter (m),
: The observed reaction rate (mol/m2 s),
CAB,b: The bulk concentration of gaseous reactant (mol/m3),
and CAB,s: The surface concentration of gaseous reactant (mol/m3)
The diffusivity for 1-butene in nitrogen (DAB) was estimated using the Fuller, Schettler, and Giddings correlation [37]:
Where:
vi: The summation of the diffusion volume for component I,
T: Temperature in Kelvin,
MA: The molecular weight of component A
and MB: The molecular weight of component B.
Frössling correlation was evaluated by considering the fluid surrounding the particles is almost stagnant which corresponds to possible highest gas film resistances (Re = 0 → Sh = 2). The observed reaction rate (mol/m2 s) in the fixed bed reactor can be expressed as:
Where:
FA0: The molar flow rate of reactant 1-butene,
XA: The conversion of 1-butene,
Sex: The external surface area per gram of sample (372 m2/g)
and W is the weight of the catalyst (1.00 g).
In order test for the highest mass transfer resistance the highest possible particle diameter was used in the calculations (dp = 1 mm). The calculations for the external mass transfer were conducted and the final results are presented in the Table 4. From ΔCfilm values, it is observed that the decrease across the mass transfer film is very small and hence the mass transfer resistance across the film is small and does not affect the rate of reaction. Effect of external mass transfer was also verified by using doubled the amount of feed as well as catalyst, it was found the activity and product distribution remains same (Table S1). This shows there is no limitation on external mass transfer resistance.

For the internal mass diffusion resistance the Weisz-Prater criterion was used, the criterion states that if the following expression is true; then the internal diffusion resistance will be negligible [38]:
Deff = 0.1 DAB
Rp = dp/2
Since all the values of the Weisz-Prater parameter as shown in Table 5 are ≪1, the internal diffusion resistance is not significant. In order to prove experimentally, HZ-280-CS(2X) catalyst having different particle size was used and there is no change in 1-butene conversion and product distribution clearly indicating the absence of internal mass transfer resistance (Table S1).

3.2.4. Effect of time on stream study
Catalyst stability was plotted for HZ-280-CS(2X) and HZ-1500. Catalyst HZ-1500 was chosen to compare with HZ-280-CS(2X) due to the high P/E ratio it afforded. The results, presented in Fig. 11, show that HZ-280-CS(2X) was stable for 50 h under the 1-butene stream, whereas catalyst HZ-1500 deactivated faster. The yields of propylene and ethylene remained the same for 50 h over HZ-280-CS(2X). The formation of isobutene was increased from 19% (TOS = 1 h) to 34% (TOS = 50 h) for HZ-1500 resulting the catalyst deactivation. These results indicate excellent catalyst stability of core-shell silicalite composite as compared to HZ-1500. The coke formation of HZ-280-CS(2X) and HZ-1500 was found to be 0.73% and 1.5%, respectively. Eplede et al. [39], [40] showed the nature and amount of coke deposited using HZSM-5 zeolite and SAPO-34 in the transformation of ethylene or 1-butene to propylene. The amount of coke observed for HZ-280-CS(2X) and HZ-1500 catalyst was very low and also the formation of aromatics are limited due to presence of weak acid sites of catalysts. However, FT-IR of spent catalyst was carried out and the results show the absence of aliphatic and aromatic peaks (Fig. S1) indicates the formation soft coke, which can be regenerated easily.

4. Conclusions
Surface modification of ZSM-5 catalyst by silica deposition using chemical liquid deposition (CLD) method as well as core-shell silicalite composite was compared. Core-shell composite showed higher propylene yield for catalytic cracking of 1-butene as compared to CLD method. The higher propylene yield and stability is related to effective surface passivation as observed in external surface acidity measurements as well as FT-IR. Silica deposited using CLD method showed P/E ratio of 1.7, whereas core-shell silicalite composite has P/E ratio of 3.0. The effective control of acid sites allows to reduce the hydrogen transfer reactions and subsequently minimizing undesired products such as alkanes and aromatics. It was found that aromatics formation was decreased with the increase in light olefins formation. Moreover, the coke formation over core-shell silicalite composite was found to be 50% less than catalyst HZ-1500, indicating better stability.
