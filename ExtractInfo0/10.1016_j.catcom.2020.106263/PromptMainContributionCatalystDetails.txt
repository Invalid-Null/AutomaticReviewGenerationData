Promoted mesoporous Fe-alumina catalysts for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane




1. Introduction
Isobutene (2-methylpropene) is a vital base chemical extensively used as a building block for the synthesis of a vast number of intermediates in the chemical industry. It is an essential precursor for the synthesis of various oxygenates like methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), and methacrylates which are used as octane enhancing additives in gasoline [1]. Isobutene is also widely used in the polymer industry for the production of butyl rubber [2]. The estimated increasing demand for isobutene soon insists on the need for alternative synthesis pathways other than conventional naphtha steam cracking and crude oil fluid catalytic cracking methods. In this regard, the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane acquires much significance due to the available low-cost feedstocks [3]. However, the endothermicity of this process requires an elevated operational temperature to obtain high yield of isobutene.
Chromium and platinum-based catalysts have been extensively studied for the dehydrogenation of isobutane (DHisoB). Pt-Sn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3 systems are well explored and already implemented in the industry a few decades back. Even though these catalytic systems are giving satisfactory results, they are suffered from some disadvantages. A part of chromium ions that exist in carcinogenic Cr6+ in alumina supported chromium catalyst causes severe environmental threats [4]. Also, possible sintering of Pt nanoparticles and high-cost limits Pt-based catalysts to some extent [5]. Moreover, the catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition is unpreventable at stringent reaction conditions. Hence, the development of an environmentally friendly and cost-effective promising catalyst for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane becomes imperative.
Catalyst support has a significant role in defining the activity performance. Especially for a dehydrogenation reaction, the support should be thermally stable to survive the rigorous reaction conditions. Moreover, the limited acidity can evade undesired C-C cracking and alkane isomerization reactions. High surface area and uniform pore size distribution of the support will enhance homogeneous metal dispersion [6]. While considering all these aspects, the nonreducible metal oxide, alumina, serves as an excellent candidate for the dehydrogenation reaction owing to its high thermal stability as well as mechanical strength. Moreover, state of the art drawn from the existing literature evinced alumina as the most preferred support for DHisoB, including various industrial applications [[7], [8], [9]]. Meanwhile, the commercialized catalysts have been modified to overcome the current difficulties and to improve activity by adding different metal oxides as active components [10]. Recently, Uwe et al. have proved that bare alumina itself is active for the reaction with a 30% yield towards isobutene due to the coordinatively unsaturated Al sites on the surface [11]. The supported VOx, GaOx, and MoOx materials on alumina have improved the conversion and selectivity for DHsioB [6].
Alumina is acidic, and hence it should be modified to control the acidity. Researchers have successfully attempted to reduce the acidic properties of alumina by combining with ZnO and MgO, which has improved the dehydrogenation activity and catalyst stability [12]. The addition of alkali metals can also contribute to this by selectively poisoning the acidic sites and thus hinder the coke formation [13,14]. Shingo et al. have established that the addition of a small amount of iron can improve the activity, selectivity, and stability of Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for the DHsioB. NH3-TPD studies have proved a considerable reduction in influential acid sites after Fe addition [8], which is in good agreement with the investigations of Kania et al. [15]. These prominent acidic sites prompt alkene hydrogenolysis and decrease isobutene selectivity [16]. Apart from these, iron oxide-containing activated carbon has also served as a suitable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of C4-C5 hydrocarbons [17].
Inspired by these described observations, in this contribution, we illustrated the synthesis of chromium-free catalytic system based on iron-doped mesoporous alumina system. To solve the above-discussed problems, the catalyst is separately modified with an alkali metal, phosphorous as well as noble metal via dry impregnation method. The synthesized materials are characterized for their topology, morphology and chemical properties by an array of instrumentation techniques including powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), N2 physisorption analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The materials displayed promising catalytic activity towards the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane. Iron doped alumina based catalyst systems were explored for different reactions. However, in the current study Ag, K and P are used as promoters to enhance the catalytic activity of isobutane dehydrogenation and is reporting for the first time up to our knowledge.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The chemicals with more than 99% purity were used as received from the respected company for material synthesis. Fe doped mesoporous alumina catalyst was prepared via method reported by Bing Yan et al. [18]. In a typical synthesis, roughly 1.5 g of F-127 (Sigma Aldrich) and 0.36 g Fe(NO3)3.9H2O (Merck) was added to 20 mL anhydrous ethanol (99.9%, CSS) and vigorously stirred for 4 h and labeled as ‘A.’ Meanwhile, to a stirring mixture of 15 mL anhydrous ethanol and 1.6 mL concentrated nitric acid (69–70%, Thomas baker), 12 mmol aluminum isopropoxide (Aldrich) was added and labeled as ‘B.’ Both A and B were combined using 3.0 mL ethanol to transfer the solution B. This final mixture was stirred continuously for 8 h and the obtained residue was dried in the oven at 60 °C for 48 h. Further, the solid was ground well and calcined at 700 °C for 5 h with 1 °C min−1 ramping rate. The final powder was represented as MesoFeAl.
For the synthesis of promoted catalysts, 1 wt% of K, P, and Ag were dry impregnated over 2 g MesoFeAl from a concentrated solution of the precursors KNO3 (Merck), orthophosphoric acid (88%, Merck) and AgNO3 (99.995%, Alfa Aesar) respectively. These solids were sintered at 550 °C for 2 h with 1 °C min−1 and denoted as KMesoFeAl, PMesoFeAl, and AgMesoFeAl. For the comparison study, the pristine support mesoporous alumina (MesoAl) was also synthesized by following the above procedure without adding the Fe precursor. Later, Fe was impregnated from the nitrate precursor over MesoAl and represented as FeMesoAl.
2.2. Catalytic activity test
The catalytic activity of as-synthesized mesoporous alumina catalysts was measured for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane in a continuous flow mode fixed bed reactor system equipped with an Inconel (nickel‑chromium based alloy) made reactor tube of 8*11*480 (ID:OD:L) mm dimension. The reactor tube was heated in a furnace fitted with two zones maintained at the same reaction temperature. In a single measurement, 300 mg catalyst sieved into 1.2 -1.7 mm grain size pellets were loaded at the center of the reactor tube in between quartz wool to form a catalyst bed. High temperature stable ceramic beads were used to fill the remaining space. The bed temperature was monitored continuously with K type thermocouple. A mixture of isobutane and Ar taken in an equal ratio was continuously passed into the catalyst bed using 5890E series Brook's make mass flow controllers at 400 h−1 GHSV. The reaction temperature was varied between 400 and 600 °C for the study in different runs. The dehydrogenated products were analyzed in every 30 min time interval with a Thermo Scientific Trace 1110 gas chromatograph equipped with both FID coupled with Alumina plot column and TCD coupled with Porapak Q as well as Molecular sieve columns. The major components in the effluents were n-butane, 2-butenes, 1,3-butadiene, propene, propane, ethene, ethane, methane and hydrogen. No carbon oxides were detected. Conversion of isobutane, and selectivity for isobutene, werecalculated using the equations reported elsewhere [10].
2.3. Characterization
Crystalline features of the synthesized materials were collected by powder X-ray diffraction analysis in PANalytical X'pert Pro dual goniometer diffractometer. The data were collected with a step of 0.008° (2θ) and a scan rate of 0.5° min−1 at room temperature. The radiation applied was Cu Kα (1.5418 Å) with a Ni filter, and the data was obtained using a flat holder in Bragg-Brentango geometry. Nitrogen physisorption was analyzed for the textural properties of the materials from Quantachrome Quadrasorb SI using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model. N2 sorption data were examined at −196 °C after degassing the samples at 300 °C and the relative pressure of P/P0 = 0.05–0.3 was selected to calculate surface area. Horiba JY LabRAMHR800 Raman spectrometer coupled with a microscope in reflectance mode was used with a 628 nm excitation wavelength for Raman studies. X-ray photoelectron spectra were acquired from the pelletized materials on the Thermo Scientific K-Alpha+ instrument using micro-focused and monochromated Al Kα radiation with energy 1486.6 eV.
Temperature programmed reduction experiments were carried out in a Micromeritics Autocem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer (USA). In a single TPR analysis, 0.05 g catalyst was pre-treated at 400 °C inside the furnace coupled with the instrument with 30 cm3 min−1 of 10% O2/He controlled by Brooks make mass flow controllers. Then, the sample was reduced with 5% H2/Ar at a 30 cm3 min−1 flow rate while ramping the sample temperature from 50 to 1000 °C at 10 °C min−1. Hydrogen consumption was quantified using a thermal conductivity detector. Acidity of the materials were determined in the same model instrument. In a typical TPD study, the samples were degassed at 400 °C under Helium at 30 cm3 min−1 flow before each run. Afterwards, the sample temperature was brought down to 50 °C to adsorb the probe molecule at 10% NH3/He (30 cm3 min−1) for the acidic site evaluation. The desorbed gas was analyzed from 100 to 1000 °C with 10 °C min−1 ramp rate. The quantification was made from the resulting TPD profiles.
A dual-beam scanning electron microscope FEI company made and Quanta 200 3D model operated at 30 kV was used to collect scanning electron microscopy images. A high-resolution transmission electron spectroscopy study was performed in JEM2100 multipurpose instrument operated at 300 kV. The sample was prepared by dispersing the powder in isopropyl alcohol followed by drop-casting on carbon‑copper mesh (200 μm size) and silicon wafer respectively for TEM and SEM study. Coke deposition over the spent catalyst was determined with the help of the Perkin Elmer instrument. TG analysis was performed under the air atmosphere and the carbon combustion temperature was taken from the exothermic event in DTA.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane
A conventional fixed bed reactor was used to study the catalytic activity of the mesoporous alumina catalysts. The effect of different promoters, as well as reaction parameters like temperature on the activity performance, was investigated through various experiments. The main products were obtained from the dehydrogenation, isomerization, and cracking processes occurred during the reaction (Scheme 1). Coke deposition was also detected near the catalyst bed at the end of each experiment.

3.1.1. Effect of promoters
Catalyst promoters have been utilized on an existing catalyst to improve the product yield. Therefore, the effect of different promoters on the selective dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was performed at 600 °C. All experiments were conducted at 400 h−1 GHSV concerning isobutane and argon mixture taken in 1:1 ratio. The results are depicted in Fig. 1 as well as in Table S1. For the comparison study, the reaction was carried out over MesoAl also. Interestingly, as can be seen, the bare support exhibited appreciable activity under the given reaction conditions with the highest selectivity towards total dehydrogenating products (STDP), which include isobutene, 1-butene, 2-butenes, propene, and ethene. However, the final conversion of isobutane (Xisobutane) and selectivity for isobutene (Sisobutene) were low. The incorporation of Fe simultaneously decreases STDP and increases isobutane conversion. It can be realized from the activity performance given in Fig. 1 that the addition of small amount of promoters only slightly affected the dehydrogenation reaction pattern at 600 °C. Potassium promoted catalyst (KMesoFeAl) showed excellent selectivity towards the dehydrogenation reaction while conversion was comparatively low. Conversely, the acid-treated material (PMesoFeAl) was less selective for isobutene with a better isobutane conversion. Surprisingly, the noble metal promoted AgMesoFeAl displayed slightly higher yield of isobutene, Yisobutene (Table S1) at the studied reaction parameters. Isobutane conversion achieved was 36%, with 32% selectivity towards isobutene. It is essential to highlight the considerable STDP over the same catalyst.

To investigate the effect of the synthesis method adopted for Fe incorporation in MesoAl support on the non-oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, FeMesoAl was prepared by dry impregnation method. Moreover, the activity performance of this catalyst was compared with the in situ prepared MesoFeAl catalyst. The activity results represented in Fig. 1 clearly illustrates that FeMesoAl shows the least selectivity towards the dehydrogenation products. The reason for this observation was analyzed with the material properties and explained in the respective sections. It may be interpreted in terms of the amount of coke deposited on the surface, which is quantified from TG analysis. From the above results, AgMesoFeAl was selected as a representative catalyst for further analysis.
3.1.2. Influence of reaction temperature
Fig. S1 shows isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity as a function of reaction temperature over AgMesoFeAl catalyst. At 400 °C, Xisobutane was insignificant with the least isobutene selectivity due to the formation of other dehydrogenated products. The main process that occurred at this temperature would be isomerization of the formed alkene to n-butenes. On further increasing the reaction temperature up to 500 °C, conversion slightly improves accompanied by the steady increase in the product selectivity. A sharp increase in reactant conversion is observed above 500 °C. Contrastively, the selectivity slowly increases with the reaction temperature and remained constant after 550 °C. Thus, Fig. S1 illustrates that 36% isobutane is converted with 32% selectivity towards isobutene at 600 °C. The formation of other alkenes is also in line with the isobutene selectivity pattern when plotted against reaction temperature (Fig. S1). At higher temperatures, isobutene was further cracked into lighter hydrocarbons. This results in coke formation which is deposited on the catalyst surface and blocks the active sites. Post characterization of the spent catalysts supports this observation. This activity trend with temperature may also be correlated to the particle size distribution over the alumina support during the TOS analysis.
3.1.3. Onstream performance of the catalyst
The stability of a catalyst under the reaction conditions has a major significance while approaching commercialization. Hence, the time on stream study of AgMesoFeAl was executed at an optimized reaction temperature; 600 °C. Fig. 2 further depicts the long term performance of AgMesoFeAl. It was perceived from the study that at an early time on stream, the conversion is 30% with appreciable selectivity for dehydrogenated products. Gradually, Xisobutane improves during this initial 4 h phase and correspondingly Sisobutene decreases. The most top performance over this catalyst was achieved as 32% isobutene selectivity and 36% conversion of isobutane under the studied parameters. After 4 h, a steady reduction in conversion (30%) as well as selectivity (30%) is observed. Subsequently, this activity remained constant above 10 h. Followed by this initial phase, nearly stable activity was maintained up to 60 h.

The main significance of the present work is the maintenance of overall product yield over 60 h under the drastic reaction conditions. Additionally, here dehydrogenation is practiced with low space velocity. Major reasons for the decrease in activity after 10 h and the maintenance of isobutene yield in TOS are explained in the material characterization section based on the particle distribution and carbon deposition on the catalyst.
3.2. Material characterization
All synthesized mesoporous alumina catalysts were well studied for the structural-textural properties, and surface morphology. The acivity results presented in the previous section are correlated to establish the relationship between the performance and material characteristics.
3.2.1. Textural properties
N2-sorption was used to characterize the textural features of the calcined promoted catalysts and pure MesoAl support. Total surface area (SBET), pore-volume (Vp), and average pore-size values were calculated applying the BET method and presented in Table 1. According to the IUPAC classification system, the N2-sorption isotherms given in Fig. 3 indicate type IV with H1 hysteresis loop typical of mesoporous materials. However, FeMesoAl possesses slight features of the H2 loop with wide pore size distribution. These are characteristic of bottlenecked pores [19]. A close analysis of isotherms of the promoted catalysts proves that even after the impregnation process, the materials maintained mesoporosity. Pore size distribution curves derived from the N2-desorption process shown in Fig. S2 also supports the presence of mesopores. Additionally, it may be mentioned here that small pores are unfavorable for the migration of coke deposited on the active sites towards the acidic sites [20].

Fig. 3. N2 adsorpton-desorption isotherms of mesoporous alumina catalysts.
All mesoporous materials exhibited an appreciable specific surface area. Surprisingly, the total surface area of MesoAl increases after Fe doping. However, iron impregnation on mesoporous alumina support may block the pores of FeMesoAl in the rich presence of iron oxide resulting in a slight decrese in surface area from 162 to 153 m2/g. The average pore diameter (Dp) considerably reduces in the synthesized catalysts compared to the pristine support MesoAl due to the entering of the active metal species into the pore channels. The uniform mesoporous structure and noticeably large pore volume of these materials can significantly contribute towards catalytic activity. AgMesoFeAl also possess remarkable surface area with comparable pore dimensions with other samples.
3.2.2. The crystalline structure of the samples
Fig. 4 presents the X-ray diffractions of the synthesized mesoporous alumina-based catalysts. The diffraction pattern of all samples indicates the formation of γ-Al2O3 phase with JCPDS card no. 10–0425. The peaks observed at 31.9, 37, 39.5, 45.9, 60.5 and 67° are attributed to the diffraction planes 220, 311, 222, 400, 440 and 511 respectively [21]. For MesoFeAl, no peak linked to iron is found suggesting high dispersion of Fe during the in situ synthesis, and the formed iron oxide domains are too small to be detected. However, Fe has indeed detected in XPS and elemental mapping analysis. Moreover, Kobayashi et al. reported that at low content, Fe2O3 could form a solid solution with γ-Al2O3 [8]. Although, the iron impregnated sample FeMesoAl exhibited peaks at 2θ values 24.3, 33.3, 35.9, 41.1, 49.6, 54.3, 57.6, 57.9, 62.7, and 64.4° corresponding to α-Fe2O3 phase (JCPDS card no. 33–0664). This observation stipulates that only a diminutive amount of Fe is doped in the alumina framework and also, iron oxide species are poorly dispersed on mesoporous alumina support due to the ex situ synthesis method. The excess amount of Fe in FeMesoAl would oxidize in the air during the calcination process to form iron oxide and separately crystallizes on the surface.

Fig. 4. X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-sythesized samples.
When promoters are added in the MesoFeAl sample, the corresponding peaks are not identified due to the high dispersion of these species on the alumina matrix. Except in FeMesoAl, a small shift in the diffraction angle to lower 2θ values are noticed in other solids compared to the pristine support MesoAl. This could be because of the changes that occurred in the lattice parameters, which might arise from the proper doping of the elements into aluminum site [22]. The difference in ionic radii of Fe3+ (0.645 Å) and Al3+ (0.535 Å) might cause the broadening of γ-Al2O3 reflections. Compared to other materials, AgMesoFeAl best resembled in crystalline structural features with MesoAl proving the perfect incorporation of Fe and Ag. This could be a reason for the observed faintly higher activity of AgMesoFeAl. No silver oxide peaks were found in this sample, because of the minimal size and greater dispersion in the MesoFeAl matrix. Hence it can be concluded that stable phases of Fe2O3 and Al2O3 are formed in the studied catalysts after sintering at high calcination temperature.
Further examination of the structural and crystalline properties was conducted with Raman analysis of the annealed samples. Fig. S3 shows the Raman spectra of FeMesoAl, MesoFeAl, and AgMesoFeAl samples. FeMesoAl revealed peaks at 228 (A1g), 504 (A1g), 247(Eg), 297 (Eg), 416 (Eg), 620 (Eg) cm−1 corresponding to the Raman modes of α-Fe2O3. Additionally, some rare Raman peaks reported by a few researchers for the hematite phase are also identified at 669 and 836 cm−1 [23]. Surprisingly, MesoFeAl does not exhibited a single peak attributing to iron oxide, demonstrating either high dispersion of Fe in alumina matrix or it is undetectable in Raman analysis. This observation further supports PXRD and HRTEM studies.
3.2.3. Catalyst morphology
Material morphology and proper dispersion of the elements contribute to a great extent towards the catalytic performance. The selected AgMesoFeAl catalyst was analyzed with TEM, and the images collected are shown in Fig. S4. The results exhibit a mesoporous structure which are in consistent with the type of isotherms obtained from the N2 sorption analysis. A sheet-like morphology is visible for the fresh AgMesoFeAl catalyst with evenly distributed metal nanoparticles. High-resolution TEM analysis provided well-resolved lattice fringes with 0.2 nm spacing characteristic of the interplanar distance corresponding to (104) plane of the α-Fe2O3 phase. The SAED pattern of this sample with concentric rings and bright spots represented typical of a nanocrystalline material with an average particle size of 5.6 nm. Small clusters of iron oxide particles on the surface are observed in FeMesoAl, as represented in Fig. S5 demonstrating agglomeration and poor dispersion. The segregated α-Fe2O3 crysatallites are clearly emerging in the PXRD pattern shown in Fig. 4. This could be due to the different synthesis strategies adopted for the material. Therefore, all other catalysts are superior to FeMesoAl in the studied selective dehydrogenation reaction. For example, AgMesoFeAl exhibited better dispersion of metal nanoparticles than FeMesoAl, which is contributing to the catalytic activity.
Elemental mapping of fresh AgMesoFeAl as a respect for its best catalytic properties was performed using HRTEM, and the results are given in Fig. S6. The images revealed uniform distribution of the elements over the surface. This further indicates fine dispersion of the catalyst supporting PXRD as well as Raman results. SEM analysis was used to determine the surface morphology of the catalyst, and it does not exhibited any particular morphology as represented in Fig. S7. The particle shape remained the same even after the non-oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The EDX data also confirms the presence of all elements in the catalyst. No elements other than Ag, Fe, Al, and O were present, which signify the excellent purity of the sample. Therefore, it may be perceived that the proper dispersion of active metal species on the mesoporous alumina matrix can facilitate the dehydrogenation activity. These observations declare the appropriate incorporation of the metal species in alumina consistent with the structural features of the optimized catalyst. Time-dependent DHsioB experiments are carried out over the AgMesoFeAl catalyst to get insight into the morphology changes happening on its surface. The results are depicted in Fig. S4 and explained in the post reaction analysis.
3.2.4. Acidic properties
Acidic-basic properties of the materials are crucial in defining the catalytic activity. In view of this, temperature-programmed desorption experiments were conducted with NH3 as a probe molecule to measure the number of acid sites present in the catalysts. The uptake of NH3 is propotional to this value. The TPD profiles are given in Fig. S8 and the acidity values measured are presented in Table 1. According to the existing works from the literature, the samples exhibit two significant peaks at around 150, and 450 °C corresponding to NH3 desorbed from the weak and medium Lewis acidic sites, respectively [24]. It is observed from the TPD profile and the acidic strength values shown in Table 1 that bare support MesoAl (0.02 mmol/g) and FeMesoAl (0.07 mmol/g) are least acidic in nature. The in situ incorporation of metal ions enhanced the acidity of the catalysts. Iron doping to MesoAl has considerably improved the acidity to 0.34 mmol/g. As reported by Carvalho et al., strong acid sites cause hydrogenolysis of alkenes [16], which are absent in the studied materials. Isobutane mainly activates on the acidic centers and promotes the conversion. On the other hand, desorption of isobutene may inhibit at the medium and strong acidic centers, which can increase the cracking reactions [20]. The in situ iron-doped catalysts show a comparable amount of medium acidic sites, which matches well with the activity trend proving the role of catalyst acidity. The ratio between the number of active metal sites to the number of acidic sites is significant in defining catalytic performance.
3.2.5. Reducibility of the catalysts
The redox properties of the catalysts are another factor affecting the catalyst performance. Therefore, the materials were measured with H2 probed temperature-programmed reduction analysis. Under the reducing atmosphere, the amount of consumed hydrogen for all sintered catalysts is quantified from the TPR profiles (Fig. S9) and tabulated in Table 1. AgMesoFeAl exhibits the highest H2 consumption among the promoted catalysts (1.49 mmol/g) due to the additional reduction of silver oxide, which occurs at low temperature. Except in FeMesoAl, no other materials demonstrated reduction peaks correspond to the iron oxides proving the high dispersion of these species on alumina. On the contrary, the iron oxide species in FeMesoAl is reduced in different steps as Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe [25]. Hence, TPR further corroborates the poor dispersion of Fe over mesoporous alumina in FeMesoAl unlike other catalysts. Peak broadening was detected due to the multistep reduction of iron oxide. The highly exposed iron oxide crystallites can lead to further cracking of formed alkenes which result in low selectivity towards the desired isobutene as well as other dehydrogenated products (Fig. 1). Therefore, the highest coke deposits are found on this catalyst (26.2%) as shown in Table 1. Quickly reducible silver oxides in AgMesoFeAl might make it favorable for high-temperature dehydrogenation.
3.2.6. XPS study
To understand the surface species involved, XPS analysis was conducted ex situ for the fresh and spent catalysts, and the results are represented in Fig. S10. All spectra were binding energy (BE) shifted by carbon correction using the C 1 s core level value (284.8 eV) of adventitious carbon on the surface. Spectra recorded for Ag 3d exhibited (Fig. S10a) main peaks at 367.8 and 373.7 eV constitute for 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Ag2O in Ag+ state [26]. The presence of AgO cannot be rejected or confirmed owing to its high instability under ultra-high vacuum [27]. Al 2p spectra, given in Fig. S10c contained 2p3/2 peak at 74.5 eV assigned to Al3+ in mesoporous alumina. XPS peak appeared at 78 eV is attributed to anhydride Al2O3 [28]. The doping of metal into alumina lattice can affect the chemical states of Al and O, and the BE values will be changed [29]. O 1 s core level XPS spectra recorded is shown in Fig. S10d for the samples before and after the reaction. A major broad peak at lower BE value (530 eV) represents the lattice oxygen collectively contributed from all metal oxides. The surface Al-O species will be present at around 531.4 eV. Subsurface O species form silver may also contribute towards this peak [30]. The isolated –OH groups give rise to a peak at 532.7 eV. It is well known that any chemisorbed oxygen species like water molecules appear at higher BE. These values fall in slightly higher regions compared to the reported data. A close inspection of Fe 2p core-level spectra of fresh AgMesoFeAl in Fig. S10b hints the presence of 2p3/2 of Fe3+ state at BE, 712 eV accompanied by satellite peak located at 720 eV [31]. A small peak shift observed indicate that the catalyst surface is reduced after the reaction.
Silver oxide can be reduced to metallic silver under the high-temperature dehydrogenation atmosphere in the presence of isobutane. Probably the Ag0 would drive the reaction. However, no peaks correspond to Ag metal are detected in XPS may be due to its high susceptibility for atmospheric oxidation. Interestingly, a well-known phenomena called voltage induced differential charging [32] might happened in the core level spectra of the studied samples. Consequently, distortion of peaks and shift of the measured position of the peaks corresponding to the core levels could occur. This is usually observed on the non-uniformly conducting sample surface [32]. The splitting of peaks observed in the current study may be attributed to this phenomenon. The catalytic activity is not directly correlated to the XPS analysis although gives the idea about the surface composition as well as oxidation states of each element in the catalyst.
3.3. Post reaction analysis
Post reaction analysis of the catalysts was carried out to discover the structural and chemical changes that occurred during the high-temperature isobutene synthesis. The X-ray diffraction patterns of all catalysts after the reaction were collected and given in Fig. S11. The crystallinity of the samples remained intact even after the reaction at 600 °C. Crystalline phases are analyzed after 6 h as well as 60 h of DHsioB reaction at the optimized reaction temperature and presented in Fig. 5.

TEM images of spent AgMesoFeAl catalyst are recorded to study the changes that occurred in the catalyst morphology. The material retained sheet-like mesoporous structure even after 6 h of dehydrogenation reaction at 600 °C with a small increment in particle size to 7.7 nm. It is clearly seen as slightly bigger particles in the TEM image represented in Fig. S4. However, after 60 h of TOS study, more agglomerated metal particles are observed (Fig. S4), and the average particle size increases to 16.9 nm. The SAED pattern given in the inset corroborated the separation of crystalline metal oxides and is also distinctly perceived from the XRD pattern of AgMesoFeAl after 60 h as presented in Fig. 5. Moreover, thermogravimetric analysis performed in the presence of air quantified 14.4% coke deposition on the catalyst after on-stream analysis. It is observed as carbon nanotubes in the TEM image depicted in Fig. S4 after 60 h reaction. Close analysis of the TEM images illustrates some of the active metal particles are entrapped in the nanotubes, which would also be a reason for the activity decline. The Raman spectrum of this sample shown in Fig. S12 confirms the formation of both sp2 and sp3 hybridized carbon formed during the high-temperature dehydrogenation process. This coke formation mainly leads to slight deactivation of AgMesoFeAl over 60 h of stability test. However, the material maintained mesoporosity throughout the reaction.
Coke formation is one of the chief concerns involved in the isobutane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. The type of coke formed and the blocking of active sites by coke deposition can cause severe catalyst deactivation. Hence, AgMesoFeAl spent catalyst after 60 h of on stream study was investigated with Raman spectroscopy to study the nature of coke. The spectrum given in Fig. S12 proved the presence of D and G bands at 1330 and 1590 cm−1, respectively which are attributed to the disordered and pristine graphene bands. In addition to this, peaks correspond to Fe2O3 are also emerged, which were not visible in the fresh catalyst. These observations could be correlated to PXRD and TEM results evidencing phase separation as well as carbon deposition happening on the catalyst surface that leads to the deactivation during TOS analysis.
Since carbon formation is observed as one of the main reason for catalyst deactivation, the quantification of coke deposited over the spent catalyst becomes inevitable. Therefore, thermogravimetric analysis was carried out for all spent catalyst and depicted in Fig. S13. The thermogram of AgMesoFeAl-TOS after on stream DHsioB result is also represented. The amount of coke for each catalyst was quantified and tabulated in Table 1. The pristine support MesoAl exhibits the least coke deposition, which might be due to the lowest isobutane onversion and less C-C cracking reactions occurred during the dehydrogenation reaction. The table clearly shows PMesoFeAl (12%), as well as AgMesoFeAl (12.7%), have lower coke deposits compared to other promoted catalysts. The maximum C-C cracking occurred on FeMesoAl (26.6%), which is higher than both AgMesoFeAl after 60 h on stream study (14.4%) and MesoFeAl (16.2%). This observation illustrates the importance of in situ Fe doping in the mesoporous alumina. Moreover, the results obtained from TG analysis can be directly correlated to the dehydrogenation reaction trend. Coke formation continues even after the initial period which is evidenced from the thermogravimetric analysis of spent catalyst after 6 h (12.7%) and 60 h (14.4%). But the coke deposition process is very slow. This might be a reason for the stable activity of AgMesoFeAl after the initial period. In addition, FeMesoAl exhibited a meager isobutene yield due to the cracking of formed alkene under severe reaction conditions. Therefore, maximum carbon deposition was observed for this sample. Additionally, sometimes carbon deposition can also contribute to maintain the alkene selectivity through deactivating the extreme active sites. McGregor et al. have studied butane dehydrogenation over VOx/Al2O3 and observed coke encapsulation over the catalyst after the reaction at 700 °C. Unlike typical catalyst deactivation, in this case the catalytic activity remained the same indicating that carbon species can catalyze the reaction [33]. Appreciable activity towards carbon-based systems are also reported for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane by Liu et al [34]. Interestingly, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes exhibited efficient isobutene yield for the conversion of isobutane without any oxidant [35]. These results can be correlated to the current study and the possibility of carbon nanotubes to catalyze the dehydrogenation process cannot be ruled out. This could also be a reason for the stable activity of AgMesoFeAl in the TOS analysis.
4. Conclusions
In summary, mesoporous alumina-based catalysts synthesized by the sol-gel method along with the material characterization correlated to their activity performance for non-oxidative dehydrogenation delivered essential insights to the synthesis of isobutene. The overall yield of isobutene over MesoAl was improved after metal incorporation. The proper doping of iron in the alumina matrix and the optimum surface acidity are viewed as the chief properties to inhibit cracking reactions and thus affecting isobutene selectivity. AgMesoFeAl was selected for further studies as a representative of the metal incorporated material. The catalyst surface was reduced after the reaction. Particle agglomeration followed by carbon nanotube development occurred over the continuous gas phase high-temperature dehydrogenation reaction, and isobutene formation are slightly hindered. To conclude, the promoted materials exhibited nearly the same activity and can be a promising catalyst for the selective dehydrogenation of isobutene. AgMesoFeAl catalyst provided a stable yield of isobutene during the long time reaction under the drastic reaction conditions with low space velocity.
