Facile synthesis of holey lamellar CuO via ultrasonic chemical etching toward highly efficient hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol under mild conditions
Abstract
Rational engineering the structural and superficial characters of catalysts to tailor their properties is a pursuit for the catalyst design. In this work, via an ultrasonic-assisted H2O2 etching strategy, a kind of copper oxide catalyst (CuO-60) with a holey lamellar structure was prepared and structurally characterized by a series of characterization techniques including SEM, HRTEM, XRD, N2 adsorption, XPS and H2-TPR. Interestingly, this strategy can not only generate defect rich surface but also achieve morphology reconstruction, thereby affording high-density active sites on CuO-60. As a low-cost catalyst, CuO-60 displays exceptional high catalytic activity and stability for the hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) under mild conditions (25 °C and 1 atm). The 4-NP conversion over CuO-60 reaches up to 99% within 12 min, which is nearly 43-fold faster than that of the pristine CuO control. The correlation between the microstructure of the catalyst and the enhanced catalytic performance was well established. The outstanding catalytic properties can be ascribed to the synergistic effects of structure porousness, which renders in more exposed active sites, and unique redox behavior of electropositive Cu sites during catalytic process. Additionally, a catalytic mechanism is also proposed and rationalized.
1. Introduction
Metal oxides are considered as one of the most prospective catalysts owing to their widely-accessible resources, economic nature, good chemical stability and unique redox properties [1,2]. However, metal oxide materials also suffer from inherently low catalytic activities under mild conditions, and therefore, they can only be practically used a supplementary constituents for noble metal species [3,4]. Among several common metal oxide materials, for instance, copper oxide (CuOx) is able to undergo multiple oxidation states (0, +1 and + 2) during the catalytic cycle, exhibiting great versatility as an important catalyst [5,6]. Unfortunately, the overall activity of CuOx is far from the needs for real applications without the participation of noble metals, such as Au or Pt. Therefore, developing new metal oxide materials with good catalytic properties are of significance to both fundamental science and industrial applications [7,8], despite the obvious challenges are in front. The utilization of metal oxide as an independent catalyst with satisfactory activities, in this regard, requires additional modulation of its morphology, surface structure or other factors that closely related to the catalytic properties.
In recent years, defects engineering has been probed as an efficient strategy to modulate the optical, magnetic, conductance and catalytic behaviors of solid materials [9,10]. It is reported that such defects on the surface have fundamental influence on the gap states and surface electronic properties of catalysts, which in turn affect the overall catalytic performance during the process of catalysis [11,12]. Currently, the defect engineering in catalysts design is mainly focused on the tailoring of the morphology to yield a high-density of active sites or to optimize the intrinsic electronic structure to improve the intrinsic activity [13,14], by a variety of methods, such as solvothermal synthesis, thermal treatment, chemical etching, or plasma-engraving [[15], [16], [17], [18]]. For example, a kind of copper oxide (CuO) nanorods with diameters of 3.6 nm, which were synthesized by Li et al from a colloidal chemistry pathway, exhibit highly reactive redox activity in styrene epoxidation [15]. Handoko and co-workers reported a CuO nanostructure with good OER activity synthesized from hydrothermal method and H2O2 oxidation treatment as the additional post-synthetic step [16]. By high temperature pyrolysis of Cu-MOF, Niu et al obtained a novel carbon supported CuOx catalyst and exhibits a comparable catalytic activity to noble metal catalysts in 4-nitrophenol reduction, which can be ascribed to the defect-rich surface [17]. Apparently, the synthesis strategy of catalysts is critical to the resultant structural and/or surficial characteristics and the catalytic performance.
Nitrophenols (NPs) and its derivatives are important chemical intermediates in the files of pharmaceutical, printing and dyeing, agriculture and so on. However, they are also regarded as contaminates and widely detected in wastewater from industrial and agricultural production due to their resistance to degradation [19,20]. Choosing a proper reaction pathway to covert the harmful contaminates to other useful chemicals is an important subject [21]. Particularly, the version of NPs to aminophenols (APs) by liquid-phase catalytic hydrogenation strategy was proved to be both environmentally friendly and cost-effective as the final APs can be used as intermediates and/or additives for the production of several drugs or dyes [22]. In this reaction, traditional noble metal catalysts (Au, Pt) are commonly used as they usually exhibit high catalytic performance [23]. Although research on non-noble materials have also been conducted, for example, catalysts with Ni, Co and Cu species being supported on porous carbon, boron nitride, bentonite and graphene etc. [24,25], two main disadvantages still hinder the further application of such catalysts: 1) the complex multistep synthetic process and 2) inferior catalytic activity under mild conditions. Therefore, exploring more facile and “green” synthetic methods for the design of oxide-based catalysts with high catalytic activity and stability is highly desirable.
In this work, a novel holey lamellar CuO catalyst (CuO-60) with rich surface defects was obtained through an ultrasonic-assisted H2O2 etching strategy. The employment of the low cost CuO and H2O2 makes it interesting for the large-scale production. More importantly, this method can not only generate defect-rich surface but also trigger morphology reconstruction. Correlate with the surface and structure characters of CuO-60 is its unique redox property and interestingly high catalytic performance for 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) hydrogenation to 4-aminophenol (4-AP). The catalytic activity, reaction kinetics and reusability of CuO-60 in hydrogenation of 4-NP was investigated in detail. Additionally, with the combination of structural characterization results and catalytic performance, the catalytic mechanism over CuO-60 is also proposed and rationalized.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and chemicals
Copper oxide powder (CuO, AR) and hydrogen peroxide solution (H2O2, 25%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). 4-nitrophenol (C6H5NO3, AR) was provided by Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Deionized water was self-made in the laboratory and used in all experiments.
2.2. Preparation of CuO-x catalysts
H2O2 mediated etching-reconstruction strategy was applied during the fabrication of holey lamellar CuO catalyst. Before used as precursor, commercial CuO powder was washed with deionized water for 60 min to remove the adsorbed impurities. In a typical preparation process, 1.0 g pristine CuO (P–CuO) powder and 20 mL H2O2 solution (25%) was firstly mixed in a conical flask and treated by ultrasonic vibration. After a duration of 60 min, the residual bulk solids were removed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the final copper oxide catalyst was obtained by high speed centrifugation (8000 rpm) for 10 min. The obtained sample was washed with deionized water for three times and dried at 80 °C overnight. For comparison, samples with different treatment time (including 30 min and 90 min) were also obtained with the same procedure, and the resulting catalyst was donated as CuO-x (x represents treatment duration).
2.3. Catalyst characterizations
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi) and transmission electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai F20 EM) was used to examine the morphology and microstructure of CuO-x catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a Rigaku Powder X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα, k = 1.5418 Å). N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were recorded over a Micromaterial ASAP 2010N analyzer at 77 K. Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model was applied in the surface area calculation. The pore size distribution was estimated using the desorption branch of nitrogen isotherm. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were measured on Thermo ESCA LAB 250 system (Mg Kα, 1254.6 eV). Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra were recorded using Shimadzu UV-2700 spectrometer. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was determined on TP-5079 adsorption analyzer (Xianquan) equipped with a TCD detector. Typically, 50 mg of solid sample was firstly pretreated at 400 °C for 30 min under He flow. After the sample temperature was brought down to 50 °C, the H2-TPR pattern was recorded by ramping the temperature to 500 °C at the rate of 5 °C·min−1 in a 5 vol% H2/He gas flow. The content of Cu ions in the reaction mixture was measured over inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) combined with a PerkinElmer emission spectrometer.
2.4. General procedure for hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol
The catalytic hydrogenation procedure of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) is similar to the previous reports [26,27]. NaBH4 was used as reducing agent and the reaction was performed at 25 °C and 1 atm. In general, 4-NP solution (0.4 mM, 200 mL) and freshly NaBH4 solution (0.4 M, 50 mL) was firstly mixed in a beaker and stirred (400 rpm) to obtain a yellow-green solution. Then, 5 mg of CuO-x catalyst was added to start the reaction. During catalytic reaction, 3 mL of reaction solution was taken at regular intervals and the absorbance was recorded using a UV–vis spectrophotometer. Due to the relative high dispersibility of CuO catalyst in aqueous solution, the concentration of both reactants and catalyst in the reaction solution could be approximately regarded as unchanged after sampling. The hydrogenation activity was determined based on the change of absorbance at 400 nm using At/A0, where At and A0 represent the absorbance of reaction solution at intermittent and initial stages, respectively. A pseudo-first-order kinetic model was used to estimate the reaction rates because of the much higher concentration of NaHB4 in comparison to 4-NP. The conversion of 4-NP is calculated using the equation (A0-At)/A0 and the rate constant (k) is calculated using the equation ln(At/A0) = -kt [28]. In the recycle test, the catalyst (10 mg) was recovered by centrifugation after each catalytically cycle, washed for three times with deionized water and then directly used in next cycle.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The fabrication and morphology of CuO-60 catalysts
The fabrication of CuO-60 catalyst using ultrasonic-assisted H2O2 etching strategy is illustrated in Fig. 1A. By taking advantage of the weak acidic nature of H2O2 and exfoliation effect from ultrasound during synthesis process [29,30], CuO-60 catalyst with lamellar structure and defect rich surface was successfully obtained in a short period time of about 60 min. The detailed morphology of CuO-60 was first analyzed by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which is also compared with that of pristine CuO (P–CuO) as a control. The P–CuO sample is amorphous in the bulk structure with the particle size ranging from 500 to 800 nm (Fig. S1A). On the contrary, the CuO-60 exhibited an 3D architecture composed of numerous curved nanosheets, as shown in Fig. 1B, which is should be caused by the exfoliation of the P–CuO and assembly of CuO sheets. The enlarged SEM image in Fig. C reveals that the average lateral size of lamellar CuO is 200 nm and the thickness is about 14 nm. Additionally, the Tyndall effect is obviously detected in an aqueous dispersion of CuO-60, confirming its excellent dispersibility, which is important to the efficient contact with substrate molecules during catalysis (Fig. 1D) [31]. The elemental mapping patterns of CuO-60 are shown in Fig. 1E. It was found that the Cu and O are homogeneously distributed throughout the whole catalyst. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis revealed the molar ratio of Cu/O was 0.74 for CuO-60 (Fig. S3), this result is much lower than that of P–CuO (0.94), indicating more Cu defect sites were generated on the surface of CuO-60 during H2O2 etching. Based on the results above, this strategy can not only achieve morphology reconstruction but also generate defect-rich surface, which may contribute more active sites during catalytic process.

The microstructure of CuO-60 was further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Amorphous structure with relative huge thickness was observed in TEM image for P–CuO (Fig. S1B). The TEM image in Fig. 2A clearly demonstrates the 3D morphology of CuO-60. As displayed in Fig. 2B, uniform lamellar structure with large a rich of wrinkles can be unambiguously seen for CuO-60, which has good agreement with the SEM results. In addition to the 3D interconnected structure, the pores were also observed in CuO-60 (Fig. S2). Notable, different from the uniform lattice fringe in block oxides, HRTEM image of CuO-60 reveals that various exposed crystal planes on the surface of CuO-60, which should be correlated to defect rich surface caused by the reconstruction of CuO in H2O2 solution. The HRTEM image of CuO-60 in Fig. 2C inset reveals lattice fringes with the interplanar spacing of 0.25 nm, which could be indexed to the (111) diffraction plane of CuO [6]. N2 adsorption-desorption result of CuO-60 in Fig. 2D suggests type IV isotherms with a hysteresis loop at relative pressure between 0.45-1.0, indicating the porous structure of this oxide [[32], [33], [34]]. The inset in Fig. 2D shows the average pore diameter distribution of CuO-60. Apparently, two kind of pore centered at 3.7 nm and 12 nm was detected in CuO-60, which is in agreement with the HRTEM result (Fig. S2).

The synergistic effect between hydrogen peroxide etching and ultrasonic stripping is a key player for the holey lamellar structure and defect rich surface in CuO-60. For comparison, the CuO-x catalysts with different treating duration were also synthesized (x represent the treating time). With the decrease of treating time, for example, a mixture of irregular particles and nanosheets was found in SEM for CuO-30 (Fig. S4A). The lamellar structure could be maintained with a prolonged treating duration based on the SEM image of CuO-90 (Fig. S4B). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) results in Fig. S5 revealed that all CuO-x catalysts show characteristic peaks of crystal facets for copper oxide (JCPDS card no. 44–0706) [35,36], confirming the absence of crystal phase transformation during H2O2 treatment. However, obvious decrease in the intensities of the character peaks is observed with the increase of treating duration, revealing the gradual decrease of crystallization in the obtained catalyst. The texture properties of the obtained CuO-x catalysts were shown in Table 1. It is clear that the specific surface areas increase from 9.6 m2/g for P–CuO to 28.9 m2/g for CuO-60. This significant increase of surface area can be attributed to the formation of holey lamellar structure, which is consistent with the SEM and TEM results. The porous structure and defects rich surface of CuO-60 may bring advantages for its application during heterogeneous catalysis [37,38], such as providing more active metal sites, favoring the diffusion of reactants and products, and thus enhancing the catalytic activity in catalytic transformations.

3.2. The catalytic performance of CuO-x catalysts
To evaluate the catalytic performance of the obtained CuO catalysts, hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) using NaBH4 as hydrogen source was performed under mild conditions (25 °C, 1 atm). Similar to the previous literatures, UV–Vis spectrum was used to detect the transformation of 4-NP during hydrogenation process [39,40]. The absorption peak the 4-NP solution changed from 317 to about 400 nm after the addition of NaBH4, confirming the alkali mediated the formation of phenolate ion (BH4-) [42], as shown in Fig. S6. Due to the high kinetic barrier, no conversion of 4-NP was detected without the addition of any catalysts, as displayed by Fig. S7. P–CuO displayed poor performance in the title reaction (Fig. 3A). Over CuO-30, only slight decrease was observed in the characteristic peak of 4-NP at the wavelength of 400 nm (Fig. 3B). Under the same conditions, however, exceptional high catalytic behavior was obtained over CuO-60 (Fig. 3C). The complete conversion of the 4-NP took only 12 min with high selectivity to 4-AP. Fig. 3D shows the 4-NP conversion over the synthesized CuO-x catalysts. It shows that obviously increase in the catalytic performance of the catalyst was observed with the increase of H2O2 treating duration. The hydrogenation activities follow the trend: CuO-60 > CuO-30 > P–CuO. Notably, with the further extension of treatment time, for example to 90 min, the catalytic performance was no further significantly improved, which should be correlated to its similar structure and surface area to CuO-60 (Table 1 and Fig. S4B).

Plots of At/A0 and ln(At/A0) versus reaction time in the hydrogenation of 4-NP over various CuO-x catalysts (D and E) and reusability performance of CuO-60 in the hydrogenation of 4-NP (F).
Additionally, the reaction kinetics of various CuO-x catalysts in hydrogenation of 4-NP were also evaluated. Over CuO-60, as displayed in Fig. S9, a gradual increase in 4-NP conversion was observed with the stirring speed increasing from 100 rpm to 300 rpm, however, this value maintain constant at stirring speeds higher than 300 rpm. Therefore, the antiparticle mass transfer resistance in this work could be eliminated since 400 rpm is selected for all catalysts during catalytic evaluation [41]. Similar to previous reports, pseudo-first-order kinetic model was applied to estimate the 4-NP hydrogenation rates over various catalysts [24,40]. As shown in Fig. 3E, the calculated rate constant (k) is 0.347 min−1 for CuO-60, which is about 8 times and 43 times higher than that of CuO-30 and P–CuO (the value of k is 0.043 min−1 and 0.008 min−1, respectively). This catalytic efficiency is comparable or even higher than those of non-noble metal catalysts reported in the literatures (Table S1). The reaction rate of CuO-x is positively related to the increase in their surface area (Fig. S10), indicating that the larger surface area of CuO-60 is beneficial to promote its efficiency during catalysis process. In the controlled filtration experiment, no subsequent increase in conversion of 4-NP was observed after removing CuO-60, confirming the high stability and heterogeneous nature of this catalyst (Fig. S11). Meanwhile, the recyclability of the catalyst was also explored since it is of vital importance for practical applications. By taking advantage of the high stability, as displayed in Fig. 3F, 4-NP is robustly transformed over CuO-60 for at least four cycles without obvious decrease in efficiency. ICP-AES result reveals that the concentration of Cu ions in the reaction mixture was only 0.03 ppm, which suggests that leaching of Cu species could be omitted. Additionally, no obvious change in the XRD pattern of CuO-60 was observed before and after catalytic reactions (Fig. S12), further confirms the relative high reusability of CuO-60 during hydrogenation process.
3.3. Hydrogenation mechanism study over CuO-60
For the catalytic hydrogenation of 4-NP, Esumi et al have reported previously that the whole catalytic process includes two continuous steps: (1) adsorption and diffusion of substrate on the surface of catalyst; (2) electron transformation mediated by the active sites [42]. Because of mutual repulsion, the simultaneous adsorption of negatively charged 4-NP and BH4- ions is the main kinetic barrier for this reaction [23,43]. Therefore, the surface property of the catalysts has fundamental influence on their catalytic behaviors. Thus, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to investigate the electronic property of the elements on the surface of CuO-60 and P–CuO. The O1s and Cu 2p XPS signals of P–CuO and CuO-60 were displayed in Fig. 4. Two character peaks at around 933.2 eV and 952.7 eV were found in Fig. 4A for both samples, which could be assigned to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 core level, respectively [6,44]. In addition, two wide satellite peaks are also observed at the about 941.5 eV and 961.6 eV in both samples, further indicating the Cu atoms exist in a near +2 valence state. It is noteworthy that, compared with P–CuO, an increase of 0.47 eV in binding energy was obtained for CuO-60, indicating a more positive charged Cu center in this catalyst. Similar results were also detected by Handoko et al in H2O2-treated CuO nanostructures [16].

Fig. 4. Cu 2p and O 1s XPS spectra of P–CuO and CuO-60.
As for the O 1s spectra (Fig. 4B), two oxygen species were observed at around 529.8 eV and 531.6 eV in P–CuO, proving multiple types of surficial oxygen species on this catalyst. According to previous reports, the characteristic O 1s peaks with lower binding energy (530 eV) can be assigned to lattice O species (Olat) in oxides, and the peaks at higher binding energy (531.5 eV) is associated with the loosely bounded surface oxygen species (Oads) around defects [45,46]. Apparently, the peak intensity of Oads is much larger than that of Olat for CuO-60, confirming the defect-rich surface of this catalyst. Additionally, the ratios of two O species (Oads/Olat) in both samples are further calculated. Based on the area from peak encapsulation, the ratio of Oads/Olat is 9.7 for CuO-60, which is obvious higher than that of P–CuO (the value is 0.7). This unique electronic property of CuO-60 may be caused by the dissolution-precipitation of surface CuOx species during H2O2 treatment, resulting in the generation of positively charged Cu species. This speculation is in good agreement with the lower surface Cu/O mole ratio in EDX results of CuO-60 in comparison to P–CuO. The unique electronic property may affect instinct physico-chemistry properties and thus catalytic behavior of the CuO-60 during catalytic transformation.
The redox properties of CuO-60 and P–CuO were further determined by temperature programmed reduction technology (H2-TPR). As displayed in Fig. 5, for P–CuO, only one broad H2 consumption peak was observed at 318 °C, indicating the direct reduction of CuO to Cu in a reductive process [47]. As for CuO-60, the main reduction peak down shifted from 318 to 304 °C. More importantly, an obvious shoulder peak at a lower temperature (230 °C) appears in the TPR spectrum, indicating the higher redox property of CuO-60. Combined with the results of HRTEM and XPS, this may be caused by the reduction of more active Cu species on the surface of the catalyst.

Fig. 5. TPR profiles of P–CuO and CuO-60.
Previously, Qu and co-authors found that electro-positive metal sites could favor the adsorption of reaction substrates, thus achieving enhanced performance of 4-NP hydrogenation [48] For CuO-60 catalyst here, on one hand, the porous structure and abundant surface defects can provide more active sites and convenient diffusion channels, which is beneficial to the adsorption and activation of the substrates. On the other hand, the positive charged Cu sites with high redox ability could further promote the electron transfer between BH4- to 4-NP molecular, thus overcoming the kinetic barrier of the transformation. Based on the previous literatures and the structural and electronic features of CuO-60, a hypothesized mechanism is summarized. As shown in Fig. 6, the negatively charged 4-NP and BH4- are firstly adsorbed by the electronic-positive Cu sites in CuO-60 through electrostatic interaction. Due to the strong electron injection capability, BH4- will transfer electrons to Cu sites combined with releasing H+, forming the Cu–H intermediates. It will attack the nearby –NO2 groups in 4-NP and reduce them to 4-AP. Finally, desorption of 4-AP will vacate the Cu site and complete the catalytic cycle.

4. Conclusions
In this work, we report that the structure and surface properties of CuO catalyst could be effectively controlled by an ultrasonic-assisted H2O2 etching strategy. The catalyst obtained by this method exhibits excellent catalytic activities for the hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol under mild conditions. The porous architecture and electro-positive Cu sites endow CuO-60 with unique redox property, which in turn, afford an enhanced catalytic activity. This work undoubtedly expands a robust, low-cost, and scalable synthetic strategy for structure and surface properties regulation on CuO catalyst, which can also applied for the fabrication of other metal oxides with outstanding performance.
