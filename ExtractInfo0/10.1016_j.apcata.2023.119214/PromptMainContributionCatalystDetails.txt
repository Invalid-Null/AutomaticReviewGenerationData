Effects of the FCC catalyst binder type on propylene production during catalytic cracking of VGO
Effects of the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst binder type on catalytic properties were studied. SiO2 and Al2O3 were used for the FCC catalysts as a binder. Although the yield of olefins in gasoline, which is easily cracked to light olefins such as a propylene over the ZSM-5 additive, over the SiO2 binder catalyst was lower than that over the Al2O3 binder catalyst during vacuum gas oil (VGO) cracking, however, when the ZSM-5 additive was blended, the SiO2 binder catalyst showed higher propylene yield as compared with the Al2O3 binder catalyst. In terms of the difference in the properties of catalyst, the SiO2 binder catalyst indicated higher SAmicro than the Al2O3 binder catalyst after steaming. Moreover, the acid properties of the FCC catalysts after steaming also were affected by the binder type. In results, the SiO2 binder catalyst indicated higher propylene yield as compared with the Al2O3 binder catalyst.
1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the important basic chemical building blocks in petrochmical industry and the market demand have been increasing [1], [2], [3]. The production of propylene is mainly processed by thermal steam cracking of naphtha. This process is operated at high temperatures so that the large amount of energy is consumed with carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, this process produces ethylene, which is twice yield of propylene, and cannot control propylene to ethylene product ratio [4], [5], [6]. If steam cracker treatment is increased in response to the increase in demand for propylene, ethylene may be produced more than the demand, so selective propylene production is being considered. Dehydrogenation of propane is the promising process [7], [8], but the ratio in propylene production is still low. The second propylene production source is FCC process in oil refinery [2], [3]. In FCC unit, the heavy oil such as VGO and atmospheric residue is converted to light fraction like naphtha over FCC catalyst and then the produced naphtha is cracked to light olefines over ZSM-5 additive. The selectivity of propylene to ethylene is much higher as compared with thermal steam cracking. In addition, FCC unit uses the combustion heat of coke generated on the FCC catalyst as the heat of reaction, and by maintaining the heat balance, there is no need for external heating, and the energy is used efficiently. Therefore, increasing propylene production from the FCC process would be important in response to the increasing market demand.
The FCC is a flexible process for changing feed oil property and target product yield because it is easy to change the operation conditions such as fresh catalyst addition rate, ZSM-5 additive addition rate, reaction temperature, catalyst to oil ratio etc. In previous, in the FCC unit, the ZSM-5 additive has been added to adjust propylene / gasoline yield according to the demand from the market, however, nowadays the FCC unit, which emphasizes the propylene production, is increasing. In addition, some FCC processes specializing in propylene production have been developed and industrialized [1], [9]. It has been reported that when ZSM-5 additive is blended to FCC catalyst, the olefins in gasoline fraction produced over the FCC catalyst are converted to light olefins including propylene [10], [11], [12]. Therefore, the production of the olefins is required over the FCC catalyst, and the aromatics that cannot be decomposed by the ZSM-5 additive are not desired. From the elementary reaction mechanism over the FCC catalyst, it is important for increasing in the gasoline olefins yield to suppress the hydrogen transfer reactions of bimolecular reaction (i.e., olefin + naphthene → paraffin + aromatic), and it is required to reduce the acid density of the FCC catalyst [13], [14], [15].
The FCC catalyst is generally composed of ultra stable Y (USY) zeolites (which are generally modified by La), active matrix (such as active alumina), kaolin clay and binder. The activity of the FCC catalyst is mainly determined by the acidity from USY zeolite. In addition, since FCC catalysts are used under high severity conditions such as high temperatures with the presence of steam, hydrothermal stability is required for the acid sites. It is known that modification of RE by ion exchange is effective for improving the hydrothermal stability of the acid site of the USY zeolite [16], [17], [18]. Increasing RE content in the FCC catalyst increases the activity and the gasoline yield, while reducing the amount of the gasoline olefins by promoting the hydrogen transfer reaction. Therefore, it is suggested that the high RE content increases the acid density by suppressing the dealumination from the USY skeleton under hydrothermal condition. In addition, it has reported that ion exchange or modification with other metal species, such as Zr, Zn, Ca, K and Al, also changes acid properties and thermal stability of USY zeolites and changes the reaction properties [19], [20], [21], [22]. In general, the parameters of USY zeolite content, active matrix content and RE/zeolite ratio are tuned for the FCC catalyst with high performance. On the other hand, although the binder is an important component that controls the physical properties of the FCC catalyst, the effect on the catalytic properties of the FCC catalyst, particularly the yield of propylene, has been rarely studied. It is very important to know the effects of binder types that are not tuning parameters of the FCC catalyst on the catalytic properties and performance. Even if there is a slight yield difference due to the binder type, it is expected to be a large margin difference in the refinery.
The binder components play a very important role in industrial catalyst. In general, it is desired that the binder component does not affect the reaction that occurs on the active component and retains its physical properties. However, in fact, the binder component would cover the active component surface, and active sites would be affected by the interaction between the binder component and active component, and the binder component would form the pore structure. They greatly affect the reaction properties of the catalysts [23], [24], [25], [26]. Thus, it is necessary to consider that the binder component affects the catalytic properties even in the FCC catalyst. It is known that there are two types of binders for FCC catalysts, alumina binders and silica binders [27], [28]. Therefore, we studied on the effect of the difference in binder types for FCC catalysts on propylene yield during VGO cracking reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst Preparation
The preparation flow of SiO2 binder FCC catalyst was shown in Scheme 1. The SiO2 binder was prepared by mixing sulfuric acid and water glass well and adjusting the pH to 1.4–1.6. Then, the SiO2 binder, USY zeolite, active alumina and kaolin were mixed well, and the slurry was dried by spray dryer. The obtained dry powder was suspended in ion exchanged water, filtrated, and washed with the ion exchanged water. After then, it was ion-exchanged with (NH4)2SO4, and then ion-exchanged with LaCl3 solution. The pH value of the solutions was adjusted to 3.5. After washing and drying at 423 K for over-night, the resulting materials were calcined at 873 k for 2 h. The catalysts were treated under steam atmosphere at 1053 K for 13 h to simulate catalyst in regenerator of FCC unit. The Al2O3 binder FCC catalyst was prepared following Scheme 1 except the using basic aluminum chloride solution (Takibain #1500 supplied by Taki Chemical Co., Ltd.) as an Al2O3 binder instead of the SiO2 binder. SiO2 and Al2O3 mixed binder FCC catalyst was prepared by mixing the SiO2 binder and AlCl3 solution. The prepared catalyst was labeled as following: Si orAl -B(La2O3 content (wt%))_ZSM-5 additive content (wt%), where Si or Al showed SiO2 or Al2O3 binder, respectively. The mixed binder catalyst was labeled as following: Si(SiO2 binder ratio in binder component)-Al(Al2O3 binder ratio in binder component) -B(La2O3 content (wt%))_ZSM-5 additive content (wt%).

The ZSM-5 additive, which was OCTUP-α, supplied from JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd., was used. It contains 40 wt% ZSM-5 zeolites crystal.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Al2O3 and La2O3 contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) using ICPS-8100 (SHIMAZU CORPORATION).
Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured using BELSORP-mini. (MicrotracBEL Corp.) The surface area (SABET) was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory. The mesopore surface area (SAmeso) was evaluated using the t-plot method. The micro pore surface area (Zeolite SA) was obtained by the difference between SABET and SAmeso.
The pore distribution of the catalyst was measured by mercury press-in method using the Pore Master 60-GT (Quantachrome Co.).
XRD patterns were collected on a RINT-2100 (Rigaku Corporation) using a Cu Ka X-ray radiation. The unit cell size (UCS) was calculated from the X-ray diffraction pattern (RINT-2100, Rigaku Corporation) of the FCC catalyst mixed with anatase TiO2 powder.
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of adsorbed pyridine were measured using a Jasco 4600 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. The FCC catalyst was pressed into a self-supporting disk and placed in an IR cell attached to a conventional closed-gas circulation system. The sample was pretreated by evacuation at 773 K, followed by adsorption of pyridine at 423 K. Then, the sample was evacuated at the same temperature for 10 min. For quantitative calculation of adsorbed pyridine, the reported molar extinction coefficient was used [29].
2.3. Catalytic cracking test
Cracking activities test with VGO was conducted with the advanced cracking evaluation micro activity test (ACE-MAT) unit at 853 K, under the catalyst / oil weight ratio of 5.0. VGO feed property is given in Table S1. Conversion of VGO was calculated by followed equation: Conversion [wt%] = 100 – LCO [wt%] – HCO [wt%]. The products cut point is as follows Gasoline C5∼489 K, LCO 489–616 K and HCO + 616 K.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Influence of binder type on FCC catalyst properties
The properties of FCC catalysts are shown in Table 1. The SABET was almost the same in both binder types. For SAmeso before steam treatment, Al-B catalysts showed higher compared with the Si-B catalysts. While the SAmicro of Si-B catalysts were higher than those of Al-B. After steam treatment, the SAmicro of Al-B catalysts were significantly lower than those of Si-B catalysts. This result suggests that the difference in the hydrothermal stability of the USY zeolites in FCC catalyst was caused by the difference in the binder types.

The UCS of USY zeolites depended on La2O3 content in each binder cases. Al-B catalysts tended to show slightly lower UCS as compared with Si-B catalysts at a similar La2O3 content. Since the decrease in UCS means dealumination from USY, it is easier to dealumination from USY zeolites by steaming when using Al2O3 binder than when using SiO2 binder. This tendency is consistent with SAmicro results.
The number of Brønsted acid sites was also depended on La2O3 content in each binder case. The Si-B catalysts indicated the slightly greater number than the Al-B catalysts. The difference in descending order of La2O3 content is 1.2, 0.1 and 0.2 µmol/g, respectively. While the number of Lewis acid sites on Al-B catalysts were clearly more than that on Si-B catalysts. The difference in descending order of La2O3 content is 5.9, 2.2 and 0.4 µmol/g, respectively. These results mean the Al2O3 binder formed Lewis acid sites.
The pore distributions for Si-B (1.0) and Al-B (0.8) are shown in Fig. 1. There were two types of pores in both catalysts before steam treatment in Fig. 1a). In the case of macro pore (above 70 nm) structure, there is no difference in both catalysts. On the other hand, meso pore (range of 5–10 nm) volume of Al-B (0.8) was more than that of Si-B (1.0). This difference is depending on the type of binder because the components other than the binder have the same content. After steam treatment, the pore that was not seen before steam treatment appeared at 20–50 nm. It is considered that the pore was formed by dealumination from USY zeolites [30], [31]. The pore volume of Al-B (0.8) was more than that of Si-B (1.0). This result suggests that the Al2O3 binder could promote dealumination from USY zeolites. This is consistent with other characterization results. It has been reported that the alumina sol, which would form the Lewis acid sites, leads to removing of the aluminum from framework in Y zeolites. Because the Lewis acid sites caused by the alumina sol would have an affinity for the H2O molecule and then the interacted H2O molecule would be attacking the tetrahedral aluminum of zeolites [26]. On the other hand, the small amount of silica sol can diffuse into the silicon hydroxyl nest formed by hydrothermal dealumination of zeolite and continue to react to form a new silica network. As the results, the silica sol can improve the hydrothermal stability of Y zeolites and can also retain the micropore structure of Y zeolites [26]. There are differences in materials between the previous study [26] and this study, regarding the binder materials, in previous study used the alumina sol and the colloidal sol of pseudo boehmite as the Al2O3 binder materials. The pH of those materials is lower pH (pH: 2.5, 2.7, respectively) than basic chloride solution in this study (pH: 4.2). And the pH of silica sol in the previous study is higher pH (pH: 2.7) than SiO2 binder in this study (pH: 1.5). Additionally, regarding the USY zeolites, the rare-earth containing USY was used in the previous study, on the other hand, the USY zeolites not containing was used but rare-earth was post treated in this study. However, the effect of binder type on the characterization results showed similar trends. That is, with a similar mechanism, the hydrothermal stability of the USY zeolites changed depending on the binder type, and as a result, the properties of the FCC catalysts also differed depending on the binder type.

3.2. Effects of FCC catalyst binder type on VGO cracking
Table 2 shows the results of cracking reaction of VGO over each catalyst. Conversion increased with increasing La2O3 content regardless of binder type. The Si-B series catalysts indicated slightly higher conversion and higher LPG yield than the Al-B series catalyst at the similar La2O3 content, while the Al-B series catalysts showed higher coke yield. Generally, hydrocarbons lighter than gasoline are mainly produced over acid sites on USY zeolites [15], [32], [33], so that the difference in LPG yield means that the gasoline cracking to LPG over the USY zeolites in the Si-B series catalysts is more likely to occur than that over the USY zeolites in the Al-B series catalysts. The Al-B catalysts have the greater number of Lewis acid sites than the Si-B catalysts, therefore it is thought that the difference in coke yield is depending on the Lewis acid sites attributed to the alumina binder.

The obtained gasoline by VGO cracking reaction over these catalysts was analyzed, and the yields of each component are shown in Fig. 2. The olefins yield over Al-B series catalysts was higher than that over Si-B series catalysts at the similar La2O3 content. On the other hand, Si-B series catalysts indicated higher iso-paraffins yields as compared with Al-B series catalysts. These results mean that the hydrogen transfer reaction with bimolecular, which is olefins → paraffins + aromatic, is more likely to occur over Si-B series catalysts than over Al-B series catalysts in this reaction conditions. In addition, the ratio of olefins in the gas products (C3= +C4=)/LPG was higher over Al-B series catalysts than Si-B series catalysts in the cases of 0.0% and around 1.0% of La2O3 content. On the other hand, when the La2O3 content was around 2.0%, the effect of La exchanged with USY zeolites was strong, and there was almost no difference due to binder type. These facts mean that the Al-B series catalysts have lower hydrogen transfer activity due to secondary reactions than the Si-B series catalysts. However, it is suggested that the difference in the binder type has a smaller effect than the reactivity of USY zeolites with increased La2O3 content, which enhances hydrogen transfer reaction activity [25].

Fig. 2. Effect of La2O3 content on gasoline component during VGO cracking over a) Si-B catalyst, b) Al-B catalyst.
As shown in Table 1, the number of weak Lewis acid sites from which pyridine desorbs below 350 oC increased in the Al-B catalysts compared to the Si-B catalysts at the La2O3 content of 0.0% and around 1.0%. In catalytic cracking reactions, it is known that strong Lewis acid sites, which attributed to matrix component like an active alumina, also contribute to reactions such as coke formation, however, weak Lewis acid sites are thought to have little effect on the primary reaction [34], [35], [36]. It is thought that the weak Lewis acid site attributed to Al2O3 binder have almost no effect on the cracking reaction, similar to the weak Lewis acid sites on the matrix alumina, however, the large number of weak Lewis acid sites could interact with primary reaction products and/or intermediates, and they could suppress desorption of primary products. Therefore, it is considered that the hydrogen transfer reaction that occurs in the secondary reactions was suppressed over the Al2O3 binder catalyst, resulting in higher gasoline olefins yield. The interaction of the primary reaction products and/or intermediates with weak Lewis acid sites from the Al2O3 binder is thought to be supported by the higher coke yield (where coke includes hydrocarbons that were not desorbed on the catalyst) over the Al2O3 binder catalyst than over the SiO2 binder catalyst.
3.3. Effects of binder type on propylene yield with the ZSM-5 additive
The ZSM-5 additive was added with 15 wt% and 30 wt% to the Si-B (1.0) and the Al-B (0.8), respectively, and VGO cracking reaction tests were conducted. The results are shown in Table 3. The propylene yield was increasing with the increasing the ZSM-5 additive content, while the conversion was slightly decreasing because of the dilution effect. When the ZSM-5 additive was added, unexpectedly, the Si-B (1.0) indicated higher propylene yield than the Al-B (0.8), and the difference was larger than over FCC catalyst alone. Conventionally, it is well known that propylene yield could be achieved by enhancing the olefins yield in gasoline over the FCC catalyst alone and then cracking them over the ZSM-5 additive [10], [11], however, these results are different. In other words, even if the FCC catalyst alone shows the higher olefins yield, it does not necessarily indicate that propylene yield will be enhanced with ZSM-5 additive.

Fig. 3 shows the yield change of each gasoline component by adding the ZSM-5 additive to both catalysts. The decrease in gasoline olefins yield was greater for the Al-B(0.8) than for the Si-B(1.0) at both of ZSM-5 additive addition, however, the yield of gasoline olefins over the Al-B(0.8) was higher than that over the Si-B(1.0) in every ZSM-5 additive contents. On the other hand, iso-paraffins decreased more over the Si-B(1.0) than over the Al-B(0.8). Then the iso-paraffins yield over the Si-B(1.0) was almost the same as that over the Al-B(0.8) in ZSM-5 additive addition cases. Regarding aromatics, n-paraffins and naphthenes, both of catalysts showed the similar tendency.

The carbon number distributions of produced olefins and iso-paraffins over both catalysts were shown in Fig. 4 (and Table S2). Regarding to the olefins yield over the FCC catalysts alone, the Si-B(1.0) showed higher C3 olefins than the Al-B(0.8), while yields of C5 and above olefins were higher over the Al-B(0.8) than those over the Si-B(1.0). These results mean that the Si-B(1.0) is more likely to convert to smaller molecules than the Al-B(0.8), i.e., has stronger cracking ability. The tendency of the difference in the carbon number distribution of the olefins yield was the same regardless of the ZSM-5 additive addition ratio. On the other hand, for iso-paraffins yield over the FCC catalysts alone, the Si-B(1.0) showed higher yields below C7 iso-paraffins than the Al-B(0.8), while yields of C7 and above iso-paraffins were higher over the Al-B(0.8) than those over the Si-B(1.0). With 15 wt% of the ZSM-5 additive, the C4 iso-paraffin yield was increasing, while C5 and above iso-paraffins yields were decreasing over both catalysts as compared with the FCC catalysts alone cases. These results mean that C5 and above iso-paraffins were also cracked over the ZSM-5 additive as well as olefins. The differences of C4 and C5 iso-paraffins yield between over the Si-B(1.0)_15 and over the Al-B(0.8)_15 decreased as compared with over the FCC catalysts alone. C6 iso-paraffins yield was lower over the Si-B(1.0)_15 than over the Al-B(0.8)_15. With 30 wt% of the ZSM-5 additive, C4 and C5 iso-paraffins yields were also lower over the S-B(1.0)_30 than over Al-B(0.8)_30. These results suggest that the Si-B(1.0) with the ZSM-5 additive is more likely to crack iso-paraffins than the Al-B(0.8) with the ZSM-5 additive. So that the Si-B(1.0) with the ZSM-5 additive indicated higher propylene yield than the Al-B(0.8) with the ZSM-5 additive. In other words, the propylene formation via iso-paraffins is superior for the FCC catalyst with SiO2 binder over that with Al2O3 binder. It is known that micro pores of Y-type zeolites promote isomerization reactions to form the iso-paraffins [18], [37]. As shown in Table 1, the FCC catalyst with SiO2 binder has a larger SAmicro than the FCC catalyst with Al2O3 binder. It is assumed that the difference in the SAmicro is due to micropores of the USY zeolites, however, it is not certain that the micropores is not formed by the SiO2 binder species. Even if SiO2 clusters form the micropores, it is known that SiO2 clusters do not have acidity [38], so it is thought that they do not contribute to the isomerization reaction. Furthermore, if the SiO2 binder species at the interface with the USY zeolites form micropores, it is possible that the isomerization reaction on the acid sites on the USY zeolites surface is likely to occur. In other words, even if SiO2 binder species form micropores, it is considered that they hardly contribute directly to the isomerization reaction. Therefore, it is considered that iso-paraffins formation was promoted over the FCC catalyst using the SiO2 binder, and those iso-paraffins were cracked to propylene by the ZSM-5 additive.

3.4. Effects of adding Al2O3 species to SiO2 binder on the properties of the FCC catalyst
In order to study on the effect of binder species on the properties of catalyst and the reaction in more detail, two catalysts in which 25% or 50% of the SiO2 binder were replaced with Al2O3, using AlCl3 as the Al2O3 binder material, were prepared as the mixed binder catalyst. The properties of those catalysts are shown in Table 4. The SABET and the SAmicro decreased with increasing the Al2O3 binder ratio. Those of the Al(50)-Si(50)-B(0.9) were significantly lower despite the same zeolite content as the others. The UCS of the Al(50)-Si(50)-B(0.9) and the Al(25)-Si(75)-B(0.9) was also lower as compared with the Si-B(1.0). These results suggest that the added Al2O3 binder instead of the SiO2 binder for the FCC catalyst would break the structure of the USY zeolites. Compared with the Al-B(0.8) shown in Table 1, the results that these two catalysts had lower UCS suggest that the use of AlCl3 as the Al2O3 binder species would break the structure of USY zeolites more. On the other hand, the SABET and the SAmicro of Al(25)-Si(75)-B(0.9) were higher than those of Al-B(0.8), although it indicated the lower UCS after steaming. In the study of the interfacial structure between the binder species and zeolites, it has been reported that the smaller size binder like an alumina sol reduces micropore of zeolite, while the larger size binder like a silica sol retains it [25]. It is considered that the results of using the SiO2 binder and the Al2O3 binder in this study are consistent. Although SAmicro before steaming is almost the same for the Al(25)-Si(75)-B(0.9) and the Al-B(0.8), the Al(25)-Si(75)-B(0.9) has higher SAmicro after steaming. It is thought that the SiO2 binder inhibited the formed interface between the Al2O3 binder species and the USY zeolites by mixing the binders. Then, the SiO2 binder formed at the interface with the USY zeolites is thought to suppress migration of Al2O3 species accompany with moving framework Al from the USY due to steaming. Therefore, those results mean that the large amount of SiO2 binder contributed to the retention of the SAmicro. The pore size distribution of these two catalysts was almost the same as that of the Si-B(1.0) (shown in Fig. S1). From these results, to summarize the effects of binder type on the properties of the FCC catalyst, Al2O3 binder would accelerate the breaking USY zeolites, while SiO2 binder would contribute to the retention of the micro pore of the USY zeolites.

The yield of each gasoline component over these catalysts during VGO cracking was shown in Fig. 5. The Al(25)-Si(75)-B(0.9) indicated almost the same gasoline component yields as the Si-B(1.0). On the other hand, the Al(50)-Si(50)-B(0.9) indicated the higher olefins yield and lower iso-paraffins yield as compared with the Si-B(1.0). The yields of gasoline component over Al(50)-Si(50)-B(0.9) were close to those over Al-B(0.8) which were shown in Fig. 2. The iso-paraffins yield over the Al(25)-Si(75)-B(0.9)_15, which was added 15 wt% ZSM-5 additive to the Al(25)-Si(75)-B(0.9), was slightly higher than that over the Si-B(1.0)_15, furthermore the Al(50)-Si(50)-B(0.9)_15 showed the slightly higher iso-paraffins yield than the Al(25)-Si(75)-B(0.9)_15. These results show the same tendency as the difference in catalytic properties between the SiO2 binder catalyst and the Al2O3 binder catalyst described above. Comparing the carbon number distributions of olefins and iso-paraffins over these catalysts also show the same trend as Fig. 4 (shown in Fig. S2 and Table S3). With 15 wt% of ZSM-5 additive, the Al(50)-Si(50)-B(0.9)_15 showed similar olefins yield in gasoline to the other two catalysts. Despite the larger reduction in the olefins yield compared to the Al-B(0.8), the propylene yield over the Al(50)-Si(50)-B(0.9)_15 was lower. It is thought that the Al(50)-Si(50)-B(0.9)_15, which indicated the higher coke yield, would promote coke formation from olefins so that the propylene yield was low over the catalyst.

Fig. 5. Effect of SiO2 binder to Al2O3 binder ratio on gasoline component during VGO cracking a) over FCC catalysts alone, b) over FCC catalysts with 15 wt% of ZSM-5 additive.
The mixed binder with increasing Al2O3 ratio in the FCC catalyst binder indicated decreasing the SAmicro and UCS so that the Al2O3 species would be breaking USY zeolite structure. Taking into account that the UCS of the Al(25)-Si(75)-B(0.9) was lower than that of the Al-B(0.8), it is considered that the difference in SAmicro caused by the binder type strongly affected the propylene yield during the VGO cracking. In other words, it is suggested that the property of the SiO2 binder that could retain the high SAmicro is important for improving the propylene yield.
3.5. Effects of binder type on the reaction pathway
The reaction pathway of catalytic cracking over the FCC has been discussed from the early days. It is well known that catalytic cracking involves the formation of carbenium ions [33], [39], [40] as shown in Fig. 6. Compared to the Al2O3 binder catalyst, the SiO2 binder catalyst indicated higher iso-paraffins yield in the gasoline component. This is probably because the β-scission of the carbenium ions over the SiO2 binder catalyst is likely to occur via the isomerization reaction. It is considered that this is because the SiO2 binder in the FCC catalyst contributes to maintaining the pore volume of the USY zeolites, as described above. On the other hand, over the Al2O3 binder catalyst, which had the greater number of Lewis acid sites, an increase in paraffin yield is assumed due to hydride transfer back from Lewis acid sites, however in this study indicated that the paraffins yield over the Al2O3 binder catalyst was lower than that over the SiO2 binder catalyst. This is probably due to the strong influence of secondary reaction such as bimolecular hydrogen transfer reaction under the reaction conditions in this study. In other words, the Al2O3 binder catalyst with the large number of Lewis acid sites could produce more paraffins than the SiO2 binder catalyst in the primary cracking reaction, however, subsequent secondary reactions could be more likely to occur over the SiO2 binder catalyst than over the Al2O3 binder catalyst, resulting in lower olefins yield over the SiO2 binder catalyst. As described above, the weak interaction between the Lewis acid sites on the Al2O3 binder catalyst and the products and/or intermediates of the primary reaction would suppress the desorption and would make the secondary reaction less likely to occur. Furthermore, in addition to weak adsorption of products and/or intermediates over Lewis acid sites, the coke formation via carbenium ions might occur, because the coke yield over the Al2O3 binder catalyst was clearly higher than over the SiO2 binder catalyst.

There are some reports on the function of the ZSM-5 additive adding to the FCC catalyst during cracking reactions. A simplified image of the function of the FCC catalyst and the ZSM-5 additive was shown in Fig. 7. When the ZSM-5 additive was added to the SiO2 binder catalyst, more iso-paraffins were cracked on the ZSM-5 additive compared to the Al2O3 binder catalyst case. This result suggests that the iso-paraffins are desorbed easily over the SiO2 binder catalyst, which could promote isomerization reaction, after then they could be cracked over the ZSM-5 additive. While the yield of iso-paraffins over the Al2O3 binder catalyst was lower so the isomerization reaction might be promoted on the ZSM-5 additive. It is concluded that slight differences in reaction pathways and secondary reaction reactivity over the FCC catalysts would affect propylene yields after addition of the ZSM-5 additive.

4. Conclusion
The effects of binder type for the FCC catalysts on propylene production during VGO cracking reaction were studied. It was found that the SiO2 binder catalyst indicated lower gasoline olefins yields than the Al2O3 binder catalyst, but when the ZSM-5 additive was added, the SiO2 binder catalyst showed higher propylene yield as compared with the Al2O3 binder catalyst. The SiO2 binder showed higher retention of the USY zeolites structure in the FCC catalyst after steam treatment as compared with the Al2O3 binder, resulting in the higher SAmicro. Therefore, it was found that the isomerization reaction was promoted over the SiO2 binder catalyst with less steric hindrance, and iso-paraffins were easily cracked over the ZSM-5 additive. The fact that the number of Lewis acid sites over the Al2O3 binder catalyst was higher than that over SiO2 binder catalyst would also affect the secondary reaction reactivity during VGO cracking. The FCC catalyst prepared by using the mixed SiO2 binder with the Al2O3 species showed similar tendency depending on the Al2O3 species ratio in the binder component. It is concluded that the binder types influence the SAmicro of the FCC catalyst and the number of Lewis acid sites after steam treatment so that they influence the reaction pathway and the secondary reaction reactivity over the FCC catalyst.
