Dehydrogenation of Propane on Pt or PtSn Catalysts with Al2O3 or SBA-15 Support
Abstract
Dehydrogenation of propane on Pt or PtSn catalyst over Al2O3 or SBA-15 support was investigated. The catalysts were characterized by CO-pulse chemisorption, thermogravimetry, temperature-programmed-reduction of H2, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy of absorbed CO. The results show that the platinum species is in oxidation state in the catalyst on Al2O3 support, so the catalyst must be reduced in H2 before dehydrogenation reaction. Addition of Sn improves the Pt dispersion, but the catalyst deactivates rapidly because of the coke formation. The interaction of Pt and Al2O3 is strong. On SBA-15 support, the platinum species is completely reduced to Pt0 in the calcination process, so the reduction is not needed. Addition of Sn improves the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The interaction of Pt and SBA-15 is weak, so it is easy for Pt particles to sinter.

1. Introduction
Propene is an important chemical raw material. As the demand for propene is increasing, new production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane have been developed. Efforts have been made to get excellent catalysts for these processes.
In many investigations, bimetallic system Pt–Sn has been used as a catalyst for dehydrogenation or reforming reaction, and how Sn, the most effective additive, affects the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts is explained. Some researchers suggest that high dehydrogenation selectivity achieved by addition of Sn to Pt resulted from the decrease in the size of surface Pt ensembles, i.e., high Pt dispersion [1], [2], [3], [4]. Zhang et al. [3] and Nawaz et al. [4] also consider that Sn could facilitate the transfer of carbon deposits from the active sites to the carrier, improving the catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation catalysts PtSn/ZSM-5 or PtSn/SAPO-34. Beltramini and Trimm [5] have considered that Sn could decrease coke formation by enhancing gasification of coke precursors. Bariås et al. and Rodríguez et al. [2], [6] have found that PtSn alloy forms on SiO2, which could improve the catalytic stability though the specific activity decreased a little.
Meso-porous material SBA-15 possesses well-ordered pore structure, high thermal stability and high specific surface area. Recently, SBA-15 and modified SBA-15 have been used as supports in the propane dehydrogenation catalysts [7], [8], [9], showing particular properties compared to ordinary oxide and micro-porous molecular sieve.
This paper presents some experimental results of Pt and PtSn catalysts supported on Al2O3 or SBA-15. The two catalysts are compared with the characterization and the activity in propane dehydrogenation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalyst
The meso-porous material SBA-15 was prepared in our laboratory according to a procedure reported in literature [10]. Briefly, a gel prepared from poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block poly(ethylene glycol) (P123, Aldrich), HCl and tetraethylorthosilicate was stirred at 40 °C for 24 h, then transferred into a teflon bottle and aged in an oven at 120 °C for 24 h. The resulting white solid was filtered, washed with double deionized water, dried at 120 °C for 2 h, calcined at 550 °C for 8 h.
Al2O3 was available commercially, with specific surface area of 159 m2·g− 1, pore volume of 0.8033 cm3·g− 1, and average pore size of 15.541 nm.
The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using PtH2Cl6·6H2O and SnCl2·2H2O as metal precursor. The Pt loading was 0.5% (by mass) and Sn loading was 1.0% (by mass), which is the optimal content for the catalysts. Before reaction, the catalyst was pre-treated in a 30 ml·min− 1 of H2 flow at 480 °C for 2 h.
2.2. Characterization
The Pt dispersion of catalysts was determined by CO-pulse chemisorption using an Autochem 2920 automatic chemical adsorption instrument (Micromeritics Company, USA). Samples about 0.2 g were put in a tube and heated to 480 °C under 10% H2–Ar flow, keeping for 2 h, then cooling to 50 °C by He and pulse adsorbing 5% CO–He to saturation. The Pt dispersion (DPt) is calculated according the adsorption quantity of CO.
where npt is the amount of Pt adsorbed CO (mol), M is the atom mass of Pt (g·mol− 1), m is the mass of the sample (g) and wPt is the mass content of Pt in the catalyst (%).
The diameter of Pt particle (d) is calculated according to hemisphere model,
where ρPt is the density of Pt (g·m− 3) and S is specific surface of Pt in catalyst(m2·g− 1).
Temperature-programmed-reduction of H2(H2-TPR) was also tested on the Autochem 2920 automatic chemical adsorption instrument. About 0.2 g sample was put in a tube, purging with 50 ml·min− 1 10% H2–Ar flow for 10 min. After the baseline was stable, the sample was heated to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C·min− 1, and the H2 consumption was recorded.
The amount of coke on spent catalysts was measured by a TGA/DSC1 analyzer (Mettler-Toledo Company). About 20 mg spent catalyst sample was heated from 40 °C to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C·min −1 with a continuous airflow of 50 ml·min− 1.
In situ spectra of diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) for adsorbed CO on catalyst samples were obtained using Vertex 70 spectrometer (Bruker Company). A Hardrick thermo spectra-tech cell capable of high temperature operation and fitted with ZnSe windows served as the reaction chamber for in situ CO adsorption measurements. The samples were reduced under a 10 ml·min− 1 10% H2–90% N2 flow at 480 °C for 2 h. Then the sample was cooled to setting temperature to absorb CO. Before the spectra were recorded, the excessive CO was evacuated by N2.
2.3. Catalytic evaluation
The catalytic dehydrogenation reaction of propane was performed in a fixed bed tubular reactor at 600 °C and atmospheric pressure. The weight space velocity of propane was 3.0 h− 1 and the mole ratio N2/C3H8 was 1.0. The reaction products were analyzed by an online Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with a HP-Al2O3 column and a flame ionization detector.
The conversion of propane is defined as the percentage of propane converted to products. The selectivity to propene is defined as the amount of propene obtained divided by the amount of reactant converted to products.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Pt dispersion
Table 1 shows the Pt dispersion of fresh and used catalysts calculated by CO-pulse adsorption. The catalysts on Al2O3 present good Pt dispersion. Without Sn, Pt dispersion is 55.44%; with Sn, the Pt dispersion is 61.28%. Probably due to different preparation methods, the increment of Pt dispersion with Sn is less than that in previous research [11], [12], [13]. For the catalysts on SBA-15, the Pt dispersion with Sn is less than that without Sn, which is contrary to previous work [7], [14], where the Pt dispersion of PtSn/SBA-15 was higher than that of Pt/SBA-15. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Fig. 1 show large Pt particles. Few Pt particles enter the pore channels of meso-porous material. Because of different synthesis conditions, the SBA-15 obtained may present different pore structures, which may lead to different Pt dispersions.

After reaction for 25 h, the Pt dispersion of catalysts dropped drastically to less than 1%. With air calcination, for catalysts on Al2O3, the Pt dispersion recovered to above 20%, while for catalysts on SBA-15, the Pt dispersion was still small. It implies that the catalysts on Al2O3 deactivates partly by coke formation and partly by Pt sintering, while the catalysts on SBA-15 deactivates mainly by Pt sintering.
3.2. H2-TPR
The H2-TPR profiles of catalysts are depicted in Fig. 2. The Pt/Al2O3 samples show peaks at 190 °C and 398 °C, attributed to different oxychlorinated Pt species formed after impregnation of chloroplatinic acid into Al2O3 support and thermal treatment processes, such as drying and calcination. For PtSn/Al2O3, besides the peak at 190 °C, there is a broad peak around 250–450 °C, indicating co-reduction of Pt–Sn species [18]. For Pt/SBA-15, there is no obvious reduction peak, so the platinum species is completely reduced to Pt0 during the preparation process [8]. With the addition of Sn, a reduction peak appears at 300 °C, which should be the Sn4 +–Sn2 + reduction peak.

3.3. DRIFTS spectra of adsorbed CO
Fig. 3 shows the DRIFTS spectra of adsorbed CO on different catalysts. The scans at room temperature were taken on the catalysts without pre-treatment by H2 and those at other temperatures were taken on the catalyst pre-treated by H2 at 480 °C. The peak at 2050 cm− 1 is defined as the linear ν (CO) bands of Ptx(CO)y species [15]. For all samples, there is no peak at 1800–1900 cm− 1, indicating that no bridging CO adsorbs between two Pt atoms [16]. On support SBA-15, without pre-reduction, CO absorbs on catalysts at room temperature. This result is in accordance with the H2-TPR results. As the temperature increases to 60 °C, the ν (CO) band of PtSn/SBA-15 almost disappears and the ν (CO) band of Pt/SBA-15 is slightly visible. It implies that the Pt–CO interaction on SBA-15 is rather weak and the addition of Sn further weakens this interaction. However, on support Al2O3 even when the temperature reaches 550 °C, the ν (CO) band is still legible, indicating a rather strong interaction between Pt and Al2O3.

3.4. Catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation
The catalytic performance of different catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is shown in Fig. 4. On Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15, the propane conversion was about 32% initially and dropped to 5% after 25 h. For PtSn/Al2O3, the initial propane conversion was 56%, which is almost the calculated equilibrium conversion in propane dehydrogenation under the reaction condition, while the catalytic activity decreased rapidly. After 25 h, the propane conversion was only 9%. For PtSn/SBA-15, the propane conversion was also 56% initially and dropped to 32% after 25 h. The addition of Sn enhanced the stability of catalysts significantly. Among the four catalysts, the selectivity to propene on the PtSn/SBA-15 was the best. On Pt/Al2O3, the selectivity to propene was less than 80%. There were some by products, methane and ethylene, resulted from the thermal cracking. With the addition of Sn, the propene selectivity increased. Sn in PtSn/Al2O3 could decrease the thermal cracking activity of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. On Pt/SBA-15, the selectivity to propene was higher than that on Pt/Al2O3. With Sn, the selectivity to propene further increased, and it did not decrease as the reaction proceeded.

3.5. Thermogravimetry
Table 2 lists the coke deposition in the reaction of 25 h over different catalysts analyzed by thermogravimetry (TG) measurements. The amounts of coke over spent Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 were up to around 20%. Addition of Sn did not reduce the coke formation remarkably, which is contrary to previous research [17], where Sn modifies the electronic properties of Pt allowing better coke tolerance. Over spent Pt/SBA-15 and PtSn/SBA-15 the amount of coke was less than 1%. There was no obvious difference between the two catalysts on coke formation.

3.6. Discussion
With the results of DRIFTS of absorbed CO, Pt dispersion, H2-TPR, TG and catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, we find that the PtSn catalysts on supports Al2O3 and SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation present different features. On Al2O3 support, the Pt species exists as oxidation state, with notable reduction peaks in H2-TPR profiles. Before reaction, the catalysts must be pre-treated by H2 to get active Pt species. The H2-TPR of PtSn/Al2O3 presents a broad peak that does not belong to Pt or Sn alone. Pt and Sn form complex, with favorable catalytic performance. The addition of Sn improves the Pt dispersion, but the carbon deposit on the catalysts is not reduced. Although the initial activity of PtSn/Al2O3 is high enough for initial propane conversion to almost reach the equilibrium, considerable amount of coke covering the active surface makes the catalysts deactivate rapidly. The interaction between Pt or PtSn and support Al2O3 is strong. On support SBA-15, Pt species exists as atom state, no reduction peak appears in H2-TPR profiles. Before the reaction, the catalysts do not need pre-treatment by H2. The interaction of Pt and support is weak, so Pt is easy to sinter. The catalysts show good propane dehydrogenation performance. It needs more study to explain it.
4. Conclusions
Pt and PtSn catalysts on oxide support Al2O3 and meso-porous material SBA-15 have been studied. The two catalysts show different performances in propane dehydrogenation. On Al2O3 support, Pt species is in oxidation state, so the catalyst must be reduced in H2 before dehydrogenation. The addition of Sn could improve the dispersion of Pt, but the catalyst still deactivates rapidly because of the coke formation. On SBA-15 support, the platinum species can be completely reduced to Pt0 during the preparation process, so the reduction is not needed before dehydrogenation. The interaction of Pt and SBA-15 is weak, so the Pt particles are easy to sinter. The addition of Sn could improve the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. SBA-15 is a potential support for propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
