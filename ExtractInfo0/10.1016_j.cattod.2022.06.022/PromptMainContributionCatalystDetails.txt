Petroleum pitch-derived porous carbon as a metal-free catalyst for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as one of the most promising strategies for propylene synthesis, has attracted tremendous attention with the increase of shale gas exploitation. The exploration of green and sustainable catalytic materials to replace the high-price (Pt-Sn/Al2O3) and environmentally unfavorable (Cr2O3/Al2O3) catalysts will drive the rapid development of PDH technology. Porous carbon-based materials have been proposed as ideal PDH catalysts due to their abundant surface quinone/ketone CO groups for C-H bond activation and well-developed pore structures for mass transfer. However, the facile preparation of carbon-based catalysts with controllable surface properties and unique architectures remains a challenge. And the structure-function relationship of carbon-based catalysts in PDH is also under debate. Herein, we report a simple and efficient synthetic method to prepare the porous carbon-based PDH catalysts with cheap and readily available petroleum pitch as carbon source. The surface chemical properties and architectures of the porous carbon-based catalysts can be precisely tailored by varying the activation temperature during the synthesis process. Various characterizations including X-ray photoelectron spectra, temperature-programmed pyrolysis curves, thermogravimetric analysis and morphology observations clarify that the plentiful surface quinone/ketone CO groups and appropriate adsorption/desorption strengths of reactant/products derived from the great specific surface area are vital factors that guarantee the excellent C-H bond activation capability (propane conversion 45.6%) and alkenes selectivity (73.9%, propylene and ethylene) of the petroleum pitch-derived porous carbon catalyst. This work not only provides a promising alternative catalyst for the PDH process but also enriches the application fields of the carbon-based catalysts.
1. Introduction
Propylene, as the feedstock to produce various polymers and chemical intermediates such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, etc. is one of the most important basic chemicals in our daily life [1], [2], [3]. Due to the steadily increasing demand of the downstream building blocks over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production of propylene [4]. The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2–3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035 [2]. At present, most of the propylene come from the catalytic cracking process of crude oil and the steam cracking process of diesel oil or naphtha [5], [6]. Because of the low selectivity of propylene, high energy consumption of the device and serious environmental pollution, the traditional propylene production technologies have been unable to meet the increasing demands of propylene [3]. Therefore, it is highly urgent to seek a novel propylene synthesis strategy to eliminate the above mentioned obstacles in the traditional propylene synthesis routes [7]. In recent years, propane dehydrogenation has provided a great opportunity for propylene synthesis due to the increase in natural gas or shale gas production and the successful exploitation of combustible gas with the development of fracking technologies [4], [8], [9]. The propane dehydrogenation technologies can be divided into the direct (PDH) and oxidative (ODHP) dehydrogenation of propane. Even though the PDH process has been industrialized for propylene synthesis, the high price of noble metal Pt-based catalyst (Oleflex process) and the environmentally unfriendly features of CrOx-based catalyst (Catofin process) limit their further development. In addition, the rapid coking and carbon deposition phenomenon under high-reaction temperature need frequent regeneration step, thus increasing the cost of operation [10], [11]. Therefore, the development of efficient, low-cost, environmentally friendly and long-life catalysts is the research focus in the field of PDH technology.
Recently, many inexpensive metal and non-metal catalysts have been widely studied as novel propane dehydrogenation catalysts, including VOx [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], ZrO2 [18], [19], [20], [21], ZnO [22], [23], [24], [25], Co [26], [27], [28], [29], Ni [30], [31], [32], [33], and nanocarbon materials [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. Carbon materials have become ideal catalyst supports or even catalytic materials for PDH because of their abundant sources, green and non-toxic properties, and controllable physical and chemical properties [34], [40]. The pore structure and surface chemical properties of carbon-based catalysts are often the key factors affecting their PDH catalytic performance [41]. Ordered mesoporous carbon is the research focus in the filed carbon-based PDH catalysts. Yuan et al. [35] synthesized the ordered mesoporous carbon catalysts by low-temperature hydrothermal induced organic-organic self-assemble method and used them in PDH process for the first time. The catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity and stability, the propane conversion remained at 42.2%, and the propylene selectivity was as high as 90% after long-term stability test of 100 h. This study found that the basic oxygen-containing groups carbonyl CO on the surface of the mesoporous carbon catalysts act as the active sites for dehydrogenation, and other acidic oxygen-containing groups are active sites for excessive cracking side reactions. The subsequent studies focused on the modification of mesoporous carbon catalysts to increase the number of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface, especially the number of quinone/ketone carbonyl CO, such as nitric acid oxidation [42], heteroatom doping (P, N, B) [37], [38] and other treatment methods [41]. Despite the ordered mesoporous carbon materials exhibit excellent dehydrogenation performance, the complicated and time-consuming organic-organic self-assemble method and the application of toxic solvents during the preparation process seriously hinder their industrial application.
Heavy oil is a promising carbon source for carbon materials preparation due to its low price, high carbon-hydrogen ratio and rich polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons content [43], [44], [45]. Herein, with petroleum pitch as carbon source, the petroleum pitch-derived carbon-based catalysts were prepared by a one-step calcination method with salt templates. By controlling preparation conditions, the pore structures and surface chemical properties of the catalysts were precisely controlled, and the dehydrogenation performances of the catalysts were further regulated. Specifically, the sheet-like carbon with few pores and porous carbon with well-developed pore structure and high specific surface area were prepared by using double molten salt (NaCl/KCl) as template and K2CO3 as pore-forming agent, respectively. Furthermore, the number of surface CO groups were regulated by controlling the activation temperature during the preparation of porous carbon catalysts to explore the effect of surface oxygen-containing groups on the catalytic performance in PDH. Based on the characterizations and catalytic results, the structure-function relationship of the petroleum pitch-derived porous carbon in PDH was established. The porous carbon catalyst MC-700 with high number of quinone/ketone CO groups and well-developed pore structure exhibited excellent alkenes selectivity (73.9%) at a propane conversion of 45.6%.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of the catalysts
Petroleum pitch (Sinopec Jiujiang Branch), anhydrous potassium carbonate (K2CO3, analytical grade), sodium chloride (NaCl, analytical grade), potassium chloride (KCl, analytical grade) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Group Co., Ltd. All reagents were used directly without further purification.
2.1.1. Preparation of the sheet-like carbon catalyst
The sheet-like carbon catalyst was prepared by the double molten salt-templated method (Fig. 1), specific procedures are as follows. Typically, petroleum pitch of 1 g and double molten salt of 20 g [44], [46] (8.76 g NaCl, 11.24 g KCl) were grinded and mixed thoroughly. Subsequently, the mixture was heated to 800 °C with a ramping rate of 5 ℃·min−1 and held at this temperature for 2 h in a tube furnace under a continuous N2 flow. After cooling down to room temperature, the obtained product was washed with deionized water repeatedly to remove the unreacted salt templates and collected by vacuum filtration, followed by drying at 60 °C overnight in an oven to obtain the sheet-like carbon catalyst, which was labeled as DCS (double molten salt carbon sheet).

2.2. Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were evaluated using an X′Pert Pro MPD diffractometer with Cu. Kα radiation source to test the crystal types of the catalysts, the scanning range was 5–75°, and the scanning rate was 10 ° min−1; The Raman spectra were conducted on a Renishaw RM2000 employing a 512 nm laser to test defect structure of the catalysts. The morphology and microstructure of the catalysts were observed by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Nova nanoSEM 450); The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained on a JEM-2100plus equipment. The specific surface area and pore structure parameters were obtained by analyzing the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms which were recorded using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer. Before characterization, the catalysts were degassed at 300 °C for 6 h. The specific surface area was calculated by the BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) equation, and other pore structure parameters were calculated by the NLDFT (Delocalized Density Function Theory) theory; The surface chemical properties, especially the types and content of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of catalysts were evaluated using an Escalab250XI X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the spectral data was determined by the C 1 s (284.3 eV); The temperature-programmed pyrolysis tests of the catalysts were carried out using a Mack AUTOCHEM2920 Chemisorber. During the test, 0.1 g of the catalysts were heated to 950 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C·min−1 under He flow of 20 ml·min−1, the CO signals generated by the decomposition of oxygen-containing functional groups on the catalysts surface were collected by a TCD detector. The CO signals generated at different temperatures represent the decomposition of different oxygen-containing functional groups. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) test of the catalysts were carried out on a Netzsch STA 449 F3 thermogravimeter with a ramping rate of 10 °C·min−1 under N2 flow of 20 ml·min−1, the catalysts were heated from room temperature to 950 °C, and the weight losses at different temperatures are attributed to the decomposition of different oxygen-containing groups, so as to determine the types and content of oxygen-containing groups on the surface of the catalysts.
2.3. Catalytic test
The catalytic performance was tested in an atmospheric pressure micro-fixed bed reactor, and the reaction tube was a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 8 mm. Before loading, catalyst was crushed and sieved after being pressed into tablets at a high pressure of 30 MPa, and 200 mg of catalyst with a size of 20–40 mesh was screened out. The catalyst particles were diluted with 600 mg of quartz sand to avoid the overheating of the bed. Then, the mixture were placed and supported by quartz wool in the middle of the quartz reaction tube. Before catalytic performance test, the temperature was raised to 600 °C [35] with a ramping rate of 5 °C·min−1 under N2 atmosphere for 1 h to remove impurities on the catalyst surface. The feed gas of propane (5 vol%) diluted by Argon (95 vol%) [35] was switched to start the reaction. After stabilizing for 1 h, the exhaust gas was analyzed by a Huifen HF-900 gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and Ar as carrier gas. The hydrocarbon components in the exhaust gas were detected using a Al2O3 packed chromatographic column, and H2 was detected using a TDX-01 packed chromatographic column. The blank pipe experiment indicated that the conversion without catalysts was negligible, and can be ignored.
The calculation formulas involved are as follows (1), (2), (3):

Where n represents the moles of reactant and products at the inlet and outlet of the reactor, Ni represents the carbon atomic number in the products (Nmethane = 1, Nethane = 2, Nethylene = 2, Npropylene = 3). Through the above formulas, the propane conversion, product selectivity and propylene yield were calculated, which were used as evaluation indicators for the catalytic performances of the catalysts.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The effect of microstructure
First, the effect of microstructure of the catalysts on the PDH performance was investigated. Fig. 3(a and b) shows the catalytic performances of the sheet-like carbon DCS and the porous carbon MC-800. DCS exhibited low catalytic activity with the initial propane conversion of 5.6% and propylene selectivity of 37.8% at the reaction temperature of 600 ℃, the initial propylene yield was only 2.1%. In contrast, MC-800 showed better catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation, with the initial propane conversion of 36.1% and initial propylene selectivity of 70.4%, initial propylene yield of 25.4% was achieved. Furthermore, no obvious deactivation phenomenon was detected on the MC-800 catalyst during the test of 8 h. Fig. 3(c and d) shows the product distribution over reaction time of the DCS and MC-800, respectively. In addition to the targeted product propylene, by-products such as methane, ethane, and ethylene were also detected, which came from the occurrence of excessive cracking side reactions [49], [50], [51], [52]. It is obvious that the selectivity of propylene from the MC-800 catalyst was much higher than that of the DCS catalyst, no decrease of the propylene selectivity over the reaction test of 8 h, further confirmed the excellent stability of the MC-800 catalyst.

To explain the origin of difference in catalytic performances of the two catalysts, the relevant characterizations were carried out. First, the surface micromorphologies of the DCS and MC-800 can be directly observed by SEM images in Fig. 4(a and b). The two catalysts exhibited distinct microscopic morphologies, with DCS as an interconnected flake structure and MC-800 as a porous carbon structure. The sheet-like carbon structure of DCS can be attributed to the confinement effects of double molten salts NaCl and KCl at high temperature. The melting temperature of equimolar amounts of NaCl and KCl is 660 °C, which is higher than the carbonization temperature of petroleum pitch. When the temperature reached 660 °C, the molten salts began to melt, and the pitch was carbonized to form a thin carbon shell covering them. On the surface of molten salt particles, the carbonized pitch reacted with salt ions in solution to form a two-dimensional carbon layer structure with a smooth surface. The porous structure of MC-800 can be attributed to the etch activation effects of K2CO3 and the decomposition products at high temperature. When the activation temperature reached 270 ℃, K2CO3 began to decompose into K2O and CO2. Then, K2CO3, K2O, and CO2 removed the carbon atoms accompanied with the release of CO, which guaranteed the formation of a large number of pores[47], [48]. The reaction equations involved are as follows (4), (5), (6), (7).

Fig. 4. SEM images of the (a) DCS and (b) MC.
The XRD patterns of the DCS and MC-800 are shown in Fig. 5(a). Clearly, two broad diffraction peaks were observed in two catalysts, which can be attributed to the (002) and (100) planes of graphitic carbon with amorphous and disordered characters. Compared with DCS, the (002) diffraction peak of MC-800 shifted to a small angle and the peak intensity became weakened. According to the Bragg diffraction formula, the porous carbon MC-800 catalyst prepared by K2CO3 activation method had a stronger amorphous degree and a larger carbon layer spacing (d002 = 0.40 nm) compared to the sheet-like DCS catalyst (d002 = 0.35 nm) [53], which is beneficial to expose much more active sites. The defect features of the two catalysts were further revealed by Raman spectra in Fig. 5(b). In general, two obvious bands named D-band (~1340 cm−1) and G-band (~1580 cm−1) were seen in two catalysts, corresponding to the disordered carbon and the E2 g mode of sp2-bonded carbon atoms in graphitic layers, respectively [54]. The value of the ID/IG has been widely used to characterize the defect features of the carbon materials. A larger ID/IG means more defects in the carbon materials. The ID/IG of MC-800 was much larger than that of DCS, indicating that the defect degree of porous carbon prepared by K2CO3 activation method is higher than that of sheet-like carbon prepared by double molten salt method. The defect-rich structure is favorable for the exposure of high-energy active sites, therefore providing more active sites for PDH reaction.

Then, the specific surface area and porosity of the two catalysts were evaluated by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the NLDFT pore size distribution curves are illustrated in Fig. 5(c and d). The corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms showed that N2 adsorption capacity of MC-800 increased rapidly at low relative pressure (P/P0 < 0.1), corresponding to a typical type Ⅰ adsorption isotherm with a microporous structure. The NLDFT pore size distribution curves (Fig. 5(d)) further proved the microporous structure of MC-800. In contrast, DCS had almost no N2 adsorption behavior, indicating its low specific surface area. It can be found from the pore structure parameters in Table 1 that the specific surface area of MC was as high as 1747.9 m2·g−1, and most of which could be contributed from micropores. The low amorphous degree, defect degree and ultra-low specific surface area (6.8 m2·g−1) caused by poor-developed pore structure of DCS catalysts are not conducive to the activation of C-H bonds. Specifically, the low specific surface area is unfavorable for the accessibility of active sites and the mass transfer behavior of the reaction process, which ultimately leads to its poor catalytic performance.

Based on the above characterizations, the structures of the DCS and MC-800 catalysts exhibited huge differences due to the different preparation methods. The lower specific surface area and defect degree of the sheet-like carbon DCS are not conducive to PDH reaction, resulting in poor catalytic performance. In contrast, the porous carbon MC-800 possessed superior dehydrogenation activity, propylene selectivity and stability due to its well-developed pore structure.
3.2. The effect of activation temperature of MC
The catalytic performance was further optimized by varying the preparation conditions of the MC-T catalysts. Fig. 6 shows the propane conversion and propylene selectivity over reaction time of three catalysts MC-600, MC-700, and MC-800 that prepared at different activation temperatures. Among the three catalysts, propane conversion showed a volcano-shaped trend with the increase of the activation temperature, while propylene selectivity grew with the increase of the activation temperature. MC-600 exhibited the worst catalytic activity among the three catalysts, and the deactivation was obvious during reaction. The rapidly decreasing catalytic activity may be attributed to the fact that low carbonization and activation temperature (600 °C) could not stabilize the structure and surface properties of carbon-based catalysts, resulting in the collapse of pore structure and the evolution of surface groups during the catalytic performance test process. MC-700 showed the highest propane conversion, with an initial propane conversion of 45.6%, and MC-800 showed the highest propylene selectivity, with an initial propylene selectivity of 70.4%. The propylene yield over reaction time as shown in Fig. 6(b) confirmed that MC-700 possessed the highest propylene yield with the initial propylene yield of 30.5%, indicating its good catalytic performance for PDH reaction. No obvious changes were detected in the product distribution over reaction time of 8 h (Fig. 6(c-e)), which confirmed the excellent stability in PDH.

Three porous carbon catalysts prepared at different activation temperatures were characterized by SEM. As shown in Fig. 7, there was no significant difference in the microscopic morphology of the three catalysts, and they all showed a three-dimensional lamellar porous structure that penetrated each other. With the increase of activation temperature, the color of the carbon layer gradually became lighter and more transparent, indicating that the thickness of carbon layer gradually became thinner, and the pore structure between the carbon layers was further enriched, which is beneficial to the exposure of catalytic active sites and the mass transfer behavior of the reaction process. The enhanced mass transfer behavior can be embodied in accelerating the diffusion and adsorption of reactant and the desorption and diffusion of reaction products, accelerating the occurrence of reaction and the desorption of product propylene, preventing the occurrence of side reactions, and finally increasing the yield of targeted product.

TEM image of MC-700 is shown in Fig. 7(d), the porous carbon MC-700 catalyst was formed by the interconnection of transparent lamellar structures. HRTEM image (Fig. 7(e)) and the corresponding enlarged image (Fig. 7(f)) confirmed the amorphous structure property of MC-700 with no obvious lattice fringes.
XRD patterns of the MC-600/700/800 are shown in Fig. 8(a). With the increase of activation temperature, the diffraction peaks broadened and the peak intensity weakened, indicating the increase of amorphous degree of three catalysts. The XRD results confirmed that the higher activation temperature, the stronger etching pore-forming ability of K2CO3, therefore increasing the amorphous degree of catalysts. The defect features of these catalysts were revealed by Raman spectra (Fig. 8(b)). The ID/IG of three porous carbon catalysts MC-600, MC-700 and MC-800 were 0.83, 0.93, and 0.96, respectively, indicating that the higher activation temperature is beneficial to increase defect degree of the porous carbon-based catalysts.

N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of the three catalysts are shown in Fig. 8(c and d). And the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 2. With the increase of activation temperature, the amount of N2 adsorbed by the catalysts increased significantly, indicating that the increase of activation temperature could significantly enhance the pore structure of catalysts, which was also attributed to the stronger etching pore-forming effect of K2CO3 on carbon materials at high temperature. It could be seen from Table 2 that three porous carbon catalysts all possessed larger specific surface areas, which were 383.8 m2·g−1, 849.2 m2·g−1, and 1747.9 m2·g−1 in sequence. The high K2CO3 activation temperature could increase the specific surface area and pore volume of the catalysts. The highest specific surface area of MC-800 was conducive to rapid desorption of propylene, thereby avoiding the occurrence of side reactions, and effectively improving the selectivity of propylene, which was consistent with the catalytic performance results. It could be found from the pore size distribution curves in Fig. 8(d) that the pore sizes of three catalysts were concentrated around 1 nm, and the average pore size decreased with increase of activation temperature, which was consistent with the pore structure parameters in Table 2.

The surface chemical properties of three porous carbon catalysts were characterized by XPS (Fig. 9), and the content of each element is listed in Table 3. It could be found that the surface elements of three catalysts were mainly C and O, in addition to which there was a small amount of N element that comes from the petroleum pitch resource. With the increase of activation temperature, the peaks intensities of N 1 s and O 1 s decreased significantly, and the peaks intensity of C 1 s increased, indicating that N- and O-containing groups were pyrolyzed at high temperature. It could be found from the high-resolution XPS spectra of O 1 s in Fig. 9(b-d) that there were three main forms of oxygen-containing groups on the catalysts surface: CO groups at about 531.4 eV, OC-O groups at about 532.6 eV, and C-OH/C-O-C groups at about 533.5 eV [55]. The content of each oxygen-containing groups was calculated based on the content of O element in the survey spectra as listed in Table 3. Among the three catalysts, MC-700 had the highest CO groups content, and the content of other oxygen-containing groups were between the other two catalysts. It has been proven that the basic oxygen-containing groups CO, especially the quinone/ketone carbonyl groups on the surface of mesoporous carbon catalysts are the active sites for C-H activation and cleavage in propane. Therefore, the most excellent propane activation performance of MC-700 can be attributed to its highest number of CO groups. It is noteworthy that other acidic oxygen-containing groups, such as C-OH, C-O-C, and OC-O, can be employed as active sites for the main side-reaction C-C activation. And too many C-OH and OC-O groups on the surface of carbon materials are detrimental to propylene selectivity. Therefore, as listed in Table 3, the least unfavorable oxygen-containing groups in MC-800 catalyst guaranteed the highest propylene selectivity.

The oxygen-containing groups of three porous carbon catalysts were characterized by temperature-programmed pyrolysis. During the He temperature-programmed process, the oxygen-containing groups on catalyst surface could be decomposed at different temperatures to generate CO or CO2 [56]. The CO or CO2 signals detected by the TCD detector at different temperatures could reflect the different types of oxygen-containing groups, the OC-O, C-OH/C-O-C, and CO groups can be decomposed around 400–550 ℃, 550–700 ℃, and above 700 ℃, respectively [55]. As shown in Fig. 10(a), total content of oxygen-containing groups on the catalysts surface decreased with the increase of activation temperature. All three catalysts showed a weak peak at 50–200 ℃, corresponding to the desorption of adsorbed water in catalysts. As the temperature increased to 300 °C, some oxygen-containing groups on catalyst surface began to be decomposed. Among the three catalysts, MC-700 has the largest peak area above 700 ℃, indicating that the number of dehydrogenation active site CO group was the largest. Other oxygen-containing groups that catalyze side-reactions were located between the other two catalysts. This result is consistent with the XPS characterization results, and further explaining the difference in dehydrogenation catalytic performance of three catalysts.

TGA analysis under N2 atmosphere was further performed to determine the content of oxygen-containing groups in the carbon-based catalysts. The weight loss above 700 °C can be attributed to the decomposition of CO groups on the surface of carbon-based catalysts, and the variation trend of MC-700 (5.01%)>MC-600 (4.98%)>MC-800 (3.02%) corresponded well with the XPS results (Table 3) and the propane activation performance. The decomposition of other oxygen-containing groups (C-OH, C-O-C, and OC-O) as reflected by the weight loss between 300 and 700 °C confirmed that MC-800 posessed the least number of active sites for side-reactions, in line with the best propylene selectivity.
Based on the above characterizations and catalytic performance test results, it is concluded that the activation temperature during the preparation process could significantly affect the defect degree, pore structures and surface chemical properties of the porous carbon catalysts. In order to retain the number of CO groups for the dehydrogenation reaction and maintain the structure stability of the porous carbon-based catalyst under high reaction temperature (600 ℃), the activation temperature of 700 ℃ is the optimal activation temperature.
The XPS characterization was carried out on the MC-700 catalyst after the reaction of 8 h, and the content of oxygen-containing groups on the surface of the catalyst before and after the reaction were compared. The O 1 s high-resolution XPS spectra of the fresh and used MC-700 catalysts are shown in Fig. 11 and the atom ration of oxygen-containing groups on the surface of the catalysts are listed in Table 4. It could be found that the oxygen content on the surface of the catalyst decreased obviously after reaction, mainly due to the decrease in the number of CO groups, and the content of other oxygen-containing groups were almost unchanged, which further verifies the conclusion that CO acts as active site for dehydrogenation, while other oxygen-containing groups act as active sites for side reactions.

3.3. The dehydrogenation mechanism of the MC
The dehydrogenation mechanism of the petroleum pitch-derived porous carbon catalysts is shown in Fig. 12. The dehydrogenation active site is the basic oxygen-containing groups CO on the catalysts surface, and the whole process is a redox cycle. During the reaction, propane molecules are first adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts, and the basic CO groups on the surface of MC activate the C-H bonds in propane. After the two adjacent C-H bonds being broken, propylene molecule is generated. The H atom combines with CO to convert into C-OH active intermediate. At high reaction temperature, two C-OH active intermediates react each other to guarantee the recovery of CO active sites and the release of a H2 molecule at the same time.

4. Conclusion
The pore structure and surface chemical properties are the two key factors affecting the PDH performance of carbon-based catalysts. In this work, a new type of porous carbon-based catalyst is prepared with by using cheap and readily available petroleum pitch as raw material. The preparation process is simple, the cost is low, and the use of toxic solvents in the preparation process of ordered mesoporous carbon catalyst is avoided. The pore structure and surface chemical properties of the catalysts can be precisely regulated by controlling the preparation conditions, specifically referring to the preparation of the sheet-like carbon and porous carbon catalysts with different pore structures that prepared by different salt-templated methods. The content of CO groups on the catalysts surface can be further controlled by changing the activation temperature during the preparation of the porous carbon. By controlling these two preparation conditions, the regulation of the catalytic performance of carbon-based catalysts for PDH process with high efficiency is achieved.
