The provided document does not pertain to propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The abstract indicates it is about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, but the process involves selective oxidation of hydrogen rather than dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Therefore, this document is not relevant to assessing advances in propane dehydrogenation catalysts and processes.
