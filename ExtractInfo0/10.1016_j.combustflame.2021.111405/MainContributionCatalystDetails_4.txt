 Based on my analysis, the supplied document does not contain information relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses computational modeling of pulverized coal char combustion, which is not directly related to the conversion of propane to propylene. Therefore, I have indicated that the document is not relevant.
