Abstract
Aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) bound HZSM-5 extrudates were prepared with different Al/P ratios, and characterized with respect to the species chemical state, surface morphology, pore structure, and acidity, in comparison to conventional alumina bound and as-received HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst. The binder results in decrease in micropore volume implying blockage of micro channels within the zeolite crystal. AlPO4 binder forms dense amorphous matrix, while alumina forms a porous matrix with significant increase in mesopore volume and surface area. Moreover, both of the bound samples exhibit decreases in acidity strength and sites number, while the alumina bound one shows an increase in strong acidity strength which implies an enhancement of the acid stability of the strong acid sites. The reaction performance experiments on the simulated MTP operating conditions show that compared to alumina bound catalyst the AlPO4-bound type exhibits much lower paraffins and aromatics yields, and particularly that the polymer grade propylene may be easily obtained without C3 splitter, though the lifetime assessment reveals that alumina is much superior to AlPO4 as the binder.
1. Introduction
Methanol to olefins process has become an important complement to traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of petroleum-based feedstock for producing olefins (Koempel and Liebner, 2007). It attracts even more attention in countries lacking in oil but rich in coal and natural gas. This process is catalyzed by zeolite catalysts like HZSM-5. The reaction system is highly exothermic, and like other methanol to hydrocarbons processes, catalyst lifetime is an important issue. The reactor has to be off-line for catalyst reactivation after an operation cycle. Numerous studies have been published concerning the mechanism, kinetics, and reactor modeling (Kazemi et al., 2017, Huang et al., 2017b, Huang et al., 2015, Guo et al., 2012, Wu et al., 2011, Bjørgen et al., 2009). Nevertheless, most of previous works are focusing on research catalysts which can differ strongly in composition, structure, porosity, and performance from technical catalysts, i.e. for zeolites which exhibit poor self-binding properties, the inclusion of binders is indispensable to shape pulverous zeolites into suitable forms for their commercial application, in particular situations, the zeolite-binder interaction can cause decisive performance alterations thus is crucial to the overall process viability (Mitchell et al., 2013, Michels et al., 2014).
Binders deserves close consideration as they are ubiquitously used and can form a main part (i.e. 90%) of the final catalyst. In addition to their primary role in improving the mechanical stability, binders can contribute to a well-defined internal pore structure, exhibit co-catalytic activity, improve the thermal stability, protect the catalytic phase from impurities, etc., by other physical and chemical means (Mitchell et al., 2013). As a typical type of shape-selective catalyst, binders incorporated HZSM-5 is found to have enhanced porosity and related mass transfer properties of the technical bodies, simultaneously, the acid site density and speciation are also found to be binder-dependent (Michels et al., 2014, Pérez-Uriarte et al., 2016). Zhang et al. (2006) found alumina binder provided Al-atoms for the zeolite framework, formed additional acid sites, and helped enhance the propane dehydrogenation activity. Similarly, silica binder was found to change the Si/Al ratio and then caused an appreciable decrease in the zeolitic acidity (Devadas et al., 1998, Wu et al., 2000). Freiding et al. (2007) took aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) binder as a sintermatrix and prepared HZSM-5 extrudates with macropores in a narrow, monomodal size distribution. Then they evaluated its catalytic performance in comparison to conventional alumina- (Al) and silica-bound extrudates in the fixed-bed MTO (methanol to olefins) conversion, and found that the former catalyst exhibited higher light olefin selectivity and higher resistance against coke deactivation (Freiding and Kraushaar-Czarnetzki, 2011). Lee et al. (2010) found that AlPO4-bound extrudates exhibited enhanced catalytic activity and mechanical strength. Nevertheless, in the Lurqi MTP process of current practice only alumina bound extrudates were used rather than AlPO4-bound type. In addition, the phosphorus-zeolite chemistry over AlPO4 bound HZSM-5, and its performance in by-product reduction in MTP process, have not been well debated (van der Bij and Weckhuysen, 2015).
This contribution is an extension of our previous studies on MTP conversion catalyzed by conventional Al-bound HZSM-5 extrudates (Huang et al., 2017b, Huang et al., 2015, Huang et al., 2017a, Huang et al., 2016a, Huang et al., 2016c, Huang et al., 2016b), and aims to further understand the binder-zeolite interactions and examine the underlying mechanistic principles in property variations induced by binders. We prepared AlPO4-bound extrudates with different Al/P ratios and compared them to Al-bound extrudates and as-received HZSM-5 zeolite with respect to the species chemical state, surface morphology, pore structure, and acidity. Their catalytic performances in MTP conversion were evaluated from product selectivity and lifetime points of view.
2. Experiment
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The AlPO4-bound extrudates (designated as Al:P = x) were prepared with Al/P ratios of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 respectively. A typical procedure is as follows: 11.58 g pseudo boehmite was dispersed in phosphoric acid solution (13.1 g phosphoric acid + 23.4 g deionized water), then 0.64 g Sesbania powder was added to form a homogeneous sol-gel. 49.8 g HZSM-5 powder (Si/Al ratio of 200, provided by Shanghai Fuyu New Material Company) was gradually added into the sol-gel under mechanical agitation condition. The obtained paste was extruded through the nozzle of a piston extruder to cylindrical strings with a diameter of 3 mm. After drying for 24 h at 120 °C in an oven, they were broken into small pieces and were then transferred to a calciner where they were heated in air from ambient temperature to 550 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min, and where they were kept at 550 °C for 6 h. The resultant pellets were grinded and sieved into particles measuring 100–120 mesh, small enough to eliminate the effects of inner diffusion resistance, before being used for catalytic reactions. Al-bound extrudates (designated as Al Sol) were prepared in a similar procedure except for the acid, where phosphoric acid was replaced by nitric acid. As-received HZSM-5 zeolite sample was also prepared via direct calcination for comparative purpose.
2.2. Characterization of catalyst
For all characterization methods, extruded samples were milled before investigation. The crystal structures of the samples were analyzed by means of XRD on a Rigaku D/MAX 2200PC X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The surface morphology was inspected by means of scanning electron microscopy (Nova NanoSEM 450, FEI). The pore system was characterized using a N2 physical adsorption (ASAP-2010, Micromeritics). The specific surface area was calculated by the BET method and the pore volume and size distribution was calculated using the t-Plot method and the Horvath-Kawazoe method respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEDL JEM1200 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The TEM samples were prepared by evaporating one drop of a powdered zeolite–EtOH suspension (after sonication) onto a carbon-coated, holey film supported on a 3 mm, 300 mesh copper grid. Temperature programed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was applied to determine the amount and type of acid sites (Chembet Pulsar, Quantachrome). Solid-state MAS NMR measurements were performed at room temperature on a Bruker AVANCE III 400 MHz spectrometer. The 27Al MAS NMR spectra were recorded with a Larmor frequency of 156.4 MHz using a short RF pulse length of 1.0 μs, and a recycle delay of 2 s. 27Al chemical shifts were reported relative to [Al(H2O)63+]. The 31P MAS NMR spectra were recorded with a Larmor frequencies of 242.7 MHz using a short RF pulse length of 4.0 μs, and a recycle delay of 8 s. 31P chemical shifts were reported relative to 85% H3PO4.
2.3. MTP experiments
MTP experiments were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor as described in our previous articles (Huang et al., 2015, Huang et al., 2016a, Huang et al., 2016b). The apparatus mainly consists of a preheater and a U-shaped tube reactor immersed in salt bath as shown in Fig. 1. Alcohols and water were fed into the preheater by constant-flux pumps, where the liquids were vaporized and mixed with N2. As iron, nickel and chromium of steel could catalyze methanol to produce methane, the preheater, the reactor and all the pipelines were made of titanium.

Fig. 1. Experimental set-up.
All the catalyst samples had undergone hydrothermal treatment under 480 °C for 24 h. The catalyst loading weighted 0.825 g. Reactions were performed under atmospheric pressure and 480 °C, and the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was 2 h−1. In order to eliminate the induction period, butanol was co-fed with methanol with partial pressures of 2.5 and 10 kPa respectively. The partial pressure of water was 30 kPa, and the balance was N2. The resultant products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). A HP-PLOTQ capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 20 μm) received from Agilent was used.
It has been long established that instantaneous intramolecular dehydration of methanol to dimethyl ether occurs upon coming into contact with acid catalysts. So dimethyl ether in the effluent was taken as unreacted methanol, and methanol conversion was defined as:
(1)
where FMeOH,in stood for the mole flowrate of methanol at the reactor inlet, FMeOH,out and FDME for those of methanol and dimethyl ether at the reactor outlet respectively. The product selectivity was calculated on a CH2 basis:
(2)
where n stood for the carbon number in ith component, and Fi for its mole flowrate.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Species chemical state
The crystal structures of the samples were firstly examined by means of XRD. As shown in Fig. 2, AlPO4-bound samples show no significant change in X-ray diffraction pattern compared to as-received HZSM-5 sample, suggesting that the original crystal structure of HZSM-5 is well retained. The stronger diffraction signal represents the higher crystallinity of a sample. It can be observed that the diffraction signal of Al-bound sample is weaker than that of as-received HZSM-5 sample. This is related to the bounding environmental change during calcination due to the alumina binder.

The interaction between AlPO4 binder and HZSM-5 zeolite can be further revealed by MASS NMR. Cabral de Menezes et al. (2006) deemed that aluminum complexes in P-containing HZSM-5 catalyst could be categorized into three types: tetrahedral coordinated framework aluminum [Al(OSi)4], framework aluminum in defect states covalently bonding with at least one framework silicon, including tetra-/penta-/hexa-coordinated aluminum such as Al(OSi)3(OH2)n, Al(OSi)2(OH2)n(H3PO4)m etc., and non-framework aluminum bounding with no framework silicon, e.g. octahedral coordinated aluminum [Al(H2O)63+]. Fig. 3 shows the 27Al MASS NMR spectra of the samples. The AlPO4-bound samples exhibit signals at 41.9 ppm corresponding to the framework aluminum [Al(OSi)4] in HZSM-5 zeolite. While for Al-bound sample, the framework aluminum exhibits a significantly stronger signal (41.2 ppm) than those of AlPO4-bound type, suggesting more [Al(OSi)4] complexes exit. This is related to extra [Al(OSi)4] formation due to the combination of alumina binder and HZSM-5 of high Si/Al ratio. In AlPO4-bound samples the formation of Al-O-P bond, which transforms [Al(OSi)4] to [Al(OSi)3(OP)], twists the original tetrahedral coordinated framework of aluminum, and exhibits characteristic signal at 27.0 ppm. The AlPO4-bound samples also exhibit signals at −24.2 ppm corresponding to octahedral coordinated aluminum [Al(OP)6]. The counterpart of Al-bounder sample is [Al(OAl)6] which exhibits a signal at −7.0 ppm. It can also be observed that for AlPO4-bound samples, the signal intensity of [Al(OSi)3(OP)] varies with Si/Al ratio, while that of [Al(OP)6] shows no significant change. That is because the aluminum of the latter is non-framework and can be easily saturated by a small amount of P, thus the intensity doesn’t vary with the increase of phosphorus content in the binder.

Further insights into the state of phosphorous and its interaction with aluminum can be obtained from the 31P MASS NMR spectra as shown in Fig. 4. As indicated in previous studies (Xue et al., 2010, Blasco et al., 2006), the signal around −21 ppm represents the intermediate functional groups of the polyphosphate chain. Its intensity decreases with the decrease of phosphorus content, suggesting the decrease in quantity of phosphorus donor complex. The signal around −31 ppm is related to P-Al complexes, which is tetrahedral coordinated [P(OAl)4].

3.2. Surface morphology and pore structure
The SEM micrograph reveals that, as shown in Fig. 5, the crystal structure of as-received HZSM-5 zeolite is quadrangular shape. The crystal structures of both AlPO4-bound and Al-bound samples are in keeping with as-received HZSM-5 zeolite however, the roughness of crystal surface increases obviously. That is because most binder components bind on the crystal surface of HZSM-5 zeolite in an amorphous state. The average crystal size of Al-bound sample is measured to be 263 nm, while that of AlPO4-bound ones are 137 nm. This is due to the fact that alumina binder had transformed to other materials during calcination and partially destroyed the crystal structure of HZSM-5 zeolite, which may also explain the weaker XRD signal for Al-bound as shown in Fig. 2.

The pore size distribution of the samples was determined by mercury intrusion method as shown in Fig. 6. It is noted that since micropore-openings are too small for mercury to enter into, micropores cannot be detected by this method. The pore system presented in Fig. 6 is mainly formed due to the stacking of particles. It can be observed that as-received HZSM-5 zeolite exhibits macropores with a mean width of about 150 nm. The pores sized around 0.1 mm are expected to be formed due to the stacking of lumps during tableting. The pore size distribution of Al-bound sample is similar to as-received HZSM-5 zeolite, whereas the mean width is about 230 nm. This difference can be attributed to the fact that the combination of HZSM-5 zeolite and alumina binder could form larger particles. This phenomenon is also reflected in the plots of other composite zeolite samples. It can also be observed that Al-bound sample exhibits the lump-formed pores with a mean width smaller than that of as-received HZSM-5 zeolite, while AlPO4-bound type exhibits essentially no such pores. This result reveals that binders, especially the AlPO4 binder, can significantly improve the homogeneity of zeolites. For the AlPO4-bound samples, the one with an Al/P ratio of 1.5 exhibits a sharper peak than other two, indicating a centralized distribution of pore size.

More insights into the pore system of the samples were obtained with the aid of the BET method. The N2 adsorption curves at 77 K are shown in Fig. 7. The higher adsorption amount represents a higher specific surface area. The hysteresis loop formed by a adsorption/desorption curve pair confirmed the existence of mesopores. It can be observed that Al-bound sample exhibits the highest N2 adsorption amount.

Key parameters of the pore system are listed in Table 1. One can see that both AlPO4- and Al-bound samples exhibit decreased micropore volume. Commonly the decrease is attributed to binders induced partial blockage of micro channels within the zeolite crystal. While the mesopore volumes of composite samples exhibit increases compared to as-received HZSM-5 zeolite, particularly, the Al-bound sample exhibits a value more than twice of the latter. This can be explained by the formation of additional mesopores due to the staking effect of alumina binder. The BET surface area of the AlPO4-bound sample is lower than that of as-received HZSM-5 zeolite as a consequence of decreased total pore volume. In contrast, Al-bound sample exhibits larger BET surface area. On the one hand, this increase is caused by the formation of additional mesopores mentioned above. On the other hand, it is due to the fact that AlPO4 binder can form dense matrix, while alumina binder can form porous matrix which is believed to be γ-Al2O3 and is also a contributory factor to the surface area.

The porous matrix in Al-bound sample was well revealed by means of TEM, as shown in Fig. 8(B). The surface morphology of AlPO4-bound sample is nearly identical to that of as-received HZSM-5 zeolite. Since AlPO4-bound sample exhibits no significant change in X-ray diffraction pattern as shown in Fig. 2, it is reasonable to speculate that aluminum phosphate adheres to HZSM-5 zeolite in an amorphous form rather than a crystalline form. In addition, pores formed due to acid leaching can be clearly observed in both AlPO4- and Al-bound samples.

3.3. Acidity of the samples
Fig. 9 shows the NH3-TPD plots of the samples. It can be observed that each plot has two peaks, the low temperature peak around 200 °C and the high temperature peak around 500 °C which are assigned to weak acid sites and strong acid sites respectively. The former type is related to weakly acidic silanol groups that covers the external surface of the crystals and/or arise from lattice defects. The latter type is generated when Al3+ replaces Si4+ in the zeolite lattice, and the resulting negative charge is compensated by a proton (H-form) (Freiding et al., 2007). The desorption peak temperature and the acid sites amount are listed in Table 2. It can be seen that compared to the as-received HZSM-5 sample, both weak and strong acid sites of binder/HZSM-5 composite samples exhibit decreases in acid sites amount. For AlPO4-bound samples, with the increase of Al/P ratio the weak acid sites amount decreases while the strong acid sites amount increases. Generally the decrease in weak acidity is due to the fact that impure crystals generated during calcination covered some of the surface acid sites or partial blockage of the micropores. While the decrease in strong acidity is expected to be caused by the dehydrate of Al-OH+-Si. In other words, some Brønsted acid sites are destructed by phosphorus generating or (Kaeding and Butter, 1980, Huang et al., 2014). It is also a proof of the entrance of phosphorus into the zeolite framework.

Tpeak is the desorption peak temperature, I and II represent the weak and strong acid sites respectively.
The desorption peak temperature reflects the strength of the acid sites as well as the acid sites stability. It can be observed that the desorption peak temperatures of composite samples exhibit decreases except for the strong acid sites of Al-bound sample, which exhibit a temperature about 60 °C higher than the AlPO4-bound type. The increased desorption peak temperature implies enhanced acid strength and stability, and is beneficial to the lifetime of the catalyst.
3.4. Catalytic selectivity
As discussed in our previous work (Huang et al., 2015, Huang et al., 2017a, Huang et al., 2016a, Huang et al., 2016c, Huang et al., 2016b), the chemical reactions of methanol over HZSM-5 zeolite can be categorized into four groups: methanol dehydration, olefin methylation, olefin interconversion, and paraffins/aromatics generation. Here we considered three kinds of catalysts: as-received HZSM-5 zeolite, Al-bound HZSM-5 zeolite, and AlPO4-bound HZSM-5 zeolite with an Al/P ratio of 1.5. The first one was used in its original form. The latter two were grinded and sieved into particles measuring 100–120 mesh, small enough to eliminate the effect of inner diffusion resistance. The selectivity of paraffins, aromatics, and olefins along weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) is plotted in Fig. 10, Fig. 11, Fig. 12 respectively. It is noted that due to the limitation of separation capability of gas chromatography, paraffins of C5+ were not analyzed. As shown in Fig. 10, the lowest paraffins selectivity of AlPO4-bound catalyst is evident. It has long been established that the paraffins (C2+) are generated via hydrogen transfer reactions between olefins and hydride abstraction at strong acid sites (mainly Brönsted) (Huang et al., 2016b, Corma et al., 1994, Meusinger and Corma, 1996). As indicated in Fig. 9; the AlPO4-bound catalyst with an Al/P ratio of 1.5 exhibits the lowest amount and strength of the strong acid sites, compared to as received and Al-bound HZSM-5 zeolites. Therefore the lowest paraffins selectivity of AlPO4-bound catalyst in Fig. 10 can be explained by the decrease in acidity and the acid strength of the sites that hinder hydrogen transfer and aromatization reactions, which give way to paraffin and aromatic formation. These results are also consistent with those obtained by Epelde et al., 2014a, Epelde et al., 2014b, who carried out ethylene conversion into propylene over HZSM-5 zeolites subjected to different acidity adjustments. Unlike the higher paraffins, methane with no C-C bond could not be formed directly from the hydrogenation of olefins, but could be produced from the cracking of higher hydrocarbons or direct pyrolysis of methanol (Babitz et al., 1999, Chen, 2007, Narbeshuber et al., 1995). The lowest methane selectivity of AlPO4-bound catalyst is expected to be caused due to the weakening in both of the two.

Fig. 12. Olefins selectivity of different catalysts as a function of WHSV at 480 °C.
Aromatics are generally formed from the cyclization and dehydrogenation of high olefins as we discussed previously (Huang et al., 2016b). The hydride abstraction from aromatization process is the Ha-source of hydrogen transfer reactions to form paraffins. Thus in most cases, the paraffins selectivity varies together with aromatics selectivity. As shown in Fig. 11, aromatics selectivity of AlPO4-bound catalyst is far below that of the others, which can be also explained by the decrease in acidity and the acid strength of the sites that hinder hydrogen transfer and aromatization reactions (Epelde et al., 2014a, Epelde et al., 2014b). In addition, the deterioration of micropores caused by AlPO4 binder is another notable factor. As shown in Table 1, AlPO4-bound sample exhibits the least micropore volume compared to as received and Al-bound HZSM-5 zeolites, as a result of the blockage of the micropore mouth. The modification of micropore structure and its ensuing blockage by coke can reduce the diffusivity of large molecules like aromatics here, from the interior center to the surface of the catalyst. In an unfavorable way the aromatics being blocked are apt to evolve into coking precursor which in turn blocks micropores and shortens the lifetime of the catalyst as it is shown in the next section. These results are consistent with Chen et al. (1979) who suggested that the presence of phosphorus changed diffusion characteristics by decreasing pore openings. From Fig. 11, one can also observe that aromatics selectivity declines with increasing WHSV, implying that the aromatization reaction entails an evolution with carbon number increase that is susceptible to residence time.
Fig. 12 shows the selectivity of the individual olefin, C2=–C6= (without C4=), with the latter two representing the lumping of the corresponding olefin and paraffin isomers, and C4= (using butanol as C4= raw material) co-fed with methanol. It can be observed that due to the shape selective property of HZSM-5 catalyst, the principal product of propylene takes up the largest proportion than others. With increasing the space velocity, the selectivity of ethylene and propylene decreases while that of C5/C6 increases, because most of light olefins (C2/C3) are generated by cracking of the higher olefins, which are formed through methylation of the lower olefins. When the space time declines, the residence time tends to be insufficient for generating high olefins then more intermediate C5/C6 by methylation reactions exit the catalyst bed (Wu et al., 2011). One can also observe that, in AlPO4-bound catalyst, the lower paraffins and aromatics selectivity facilitates a notable increase in C5/C6 selectivity, rather than an improvement in ethylene and propylene selectivity. This is also related to the loss of strong acid sites (mainly Brønsted) by the introduction of AlPO4 binder, since cracking of the higher olefins into the lower ones occurs at these sites. Previous studies had also shown that the ratio of Brønsted/Lewis acid site decreased in the P-treated HZSM-5 zeolites, which indicated that the phosphorus doping has a greater influence on Brønsted acid sites (van der Bij and Weckhuysen, 2014, Jiang et al., 2008). In a word, the attenuation of the cracking reactions is able to well explain the distribution of olefins products for the AlPO4-bound catalyst.
Fig. 13 shows the ratio of olefin to the sum of the olefin and corresponding paraffin for C2 and C3 species, O/(P + O), respectively, which implies the potential purity of ethylene and propylene after a simple separation (De-ethane and De-propane). Generally, the purity of polymer grade propylene is over 99.6% with trace impurities of propane and ethane. It can be observed that the ratios for AlPO4-bound catalyst are significantly higher over those of Al-bound and as-received HZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. In a typical industrial practice, the reduction of C1–C3 paraffins has distinctive significances in intensifying principal product yields and in cost reduction of separation units. Particularly, because propylene and propane have very close boiling points, the decrease in propane selectivity can significantly reduce the separation burden and even avoid the necessity of propene and propane distillation column (C3 splitter, typically with a theoretical stage number over 150), which is the most complicated and highest steam-consuming unit in a MTP plant.

3.5. Lifetime assessment
As shown in Fig. 14, dramatic difference can be observed in the lifetime between Al-bound and AlPO4-bound catalysts. For the Al-bound catalyst, the breakthrough point of methanol conversion emerges at about 500 h time on stream, and approaches the threshold value of 90% at 900 h, at which point the MTP reaction has to be stopped and the catalyst regeneration be launched (Huang et al., 2016c). The lifetime of Al-bound catalyst here is in accordance with Lurgi’s industrial practice (Koempel and Liebner, 2007). While for the AlPO4-bound catalyst, the methanol conversion drops from an early stage and comes more quickly to the threshold value within 300 h. On the one hand, the decrease in acidity and the acid strength of AlPO4-bound catalyst can directly result in the loss of catalytic activity, thereinto acid strength reduction implies a decrease of acid stability. The strength of the strong acid sites of Al-bound catalyst is even enhanced compared to the parent sample Table 2, thus exhibits favorable acid stability. On the other hand, the partial blockage of micropores in AlPO4-bound catalyst can significantly reduce the diffusivity of large molecules like heavier olefins and aromatics, from the interior center to the surface mouth of the channel in the zeolite crystal. These blocked molecules are expected to evolve into coking precursor which in turn blocks micropores and shortens the catalyst lifetime. The shorter lifetime implies the more frequent catalyst regeneration, which is not favorable for the current industrial practice, where employed are three adiabatic multi-stage fixed bed reactors with two operated and one regenerated or standby. This may explain why Lurgi MTP process uses Al-bound catalyst rather than AlPO4-bound in the industrial application.

4. Conclusions
In this work, we investigated the phosphorus-zeolite chemistry over AlPO4 bound HZSM-5 catalyst via various characterization methods, and comparative analysis was made with conventional alumina bound and as-received HZSM-5 zeolite catalysts.
The characterization results show both AlPO4 and alumina binders decrease the micropore volume as a consequence of partial blockage of micro channels within zeolite crystals. The Al-bound sample exhibits larger surface area and increased mesopore volume due to the porous matrix. While AlPO4 binder forms a dense matrix adhering to HZSM-5 zeolite crystals. The composite samples exhibit decreases in strength and amount of the acid sites (both weak and strong) except for the Al-bound sample of which the strong acid sites exhibit an increase in strength and imply enhanced acid stability.
According to the MTP conversion experiments under the conditions close to practical operations, the AlPO4-bound catalyst exhibits a unique advantage lowering paraffins and aromatics selectivity, and a potential possibility to cancel the high-cost C3 splitting unit. However, due to the loss of catalytic activity and partial blockage of micropores, the lifetime of AlPO4-bound catalyst is much shorter compared to conventional Al-bound type, which is unfavorable for the current industrial practice using multi-stage fixed-bed reactor.
