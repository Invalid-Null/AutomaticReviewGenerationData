 Based on my analysis, the supplied document does not contain relevant information about propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

The document discusses methanol conversion to olefins over HZSM-5 catalysts with different binders, and does not mention propane dehydrogenation specifically. While propylene is produced, it is from the conversion of methanol, not propane. There is no discussion of Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) or Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH).
