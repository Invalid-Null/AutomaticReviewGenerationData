The given document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically for the conversion of propane to propylene. It examines the effect of chlorine elimination from Pt-Sn catalysts on catalytic behavior in general, but does not focus on PDH or ODH processes. Since it does not pertain specifically to propylene production via PDH or ODH, I cannot extract the requested information.
