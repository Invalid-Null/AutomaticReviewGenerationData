Carbon Dynamics on the Molybdenum Carbide Surface during Catalytic Propane Dehydrogenation
Graphical Abstract
Black is beautiful: The active surface of mesoporous bulk molybdenum carbide catalysts during catalytic propane dehydrogenation sensitively responds to reaction conditions (see scheme). The delicate balance between surface coking and irreversible bulk oxidation affects the product distribution. The reactivity can be controlled by vanadium doping, reaction temperature, or by adding H2, H2O, or CO2 to the feed.
Abstract
The effect of the gas-phase chemical potential on surface chemistry and reactivity of molybdenum carbide has been investigated in catalytic reactions of propane in oxidizing and reducing reactant mixtures by adding H2, O2, H2O, and CO2 to a C3H8/N2 feed. The balance between surface oxidation state, phase stability, carbon deposition, and the complex reaction network involving dehydrogenation reactions, hydrogenolysis, metathesis, water-gas shift reaction, hydrogenation, and steam reforming is discussed. Raman spectroscopy and a surface-sensitive study by means of in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy evidence that the dynamic formation of surface carbon species under a reducing atmosphere strongly shifts the product spectrum to the C3-alkene at the expense of hydrogenolysis products. A similar response of selectivity, which is accompanied by a boost of activity, is observed by tuning the oxidation state of Mo in the presence of mild oxidants, such as H2O and CO2, in the feed as well as by V doping. The results obtained allow us to draw a picture of the active catalyst surface and to propose a structure–activity correlation as a map for catalyst optimization.
Introduction
Since the early transition metal carbides were found to provide noble metal-like properties,1, 2 there has been a renewed interest in these materials in the field of catalysis, especially so in the case of Group 5 and 6 carbides. It is hoped that such materials may be able to substitute scarcer and more expensive noble metals in a growing field of applications, including fuel cells and energy-related catalysis. The direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes is of high interest in the chemical industry and reported over bulk and supported molybdenum carbide and oxycarbide for ethane,3 propane,4, 5 and butane.6–10 The relatively low number of studies concerning this topic reflects the difficulties associated with these reactions, namely severe deactivation, a complex reaction network, and the dynamic nature of the carbide surface. Literature on catalytic propane dehydrogenation is dominated by supported Cr oxides11 and Pt-based systems.12 However, these catalysts are either rare and costly, or hazardous. Sn, especially in combination with platinum as Pt-Sn/Al2O3 is one of the most popular promoters.12 However, Cu-based catalysts also provided a surprisingly high propylene productivity even at low temperatures.13
Solymosi et al. have reported on propane dehydrogenation over bulk and supported Mo2C as well as the influence of CO2.4, 5 In the dry feed bulk Mo2C predominantly produces propylene (S=44 %) with the byproducts CH4 and ethylene. Supported Mo2C/SiO2 shows a higher propylene selectivity. A strong impact of the dynamics of surface oxygen and carbon, however, is evidenced by the initial selectivity to propylene of the in situ prepared silica supported catalyst, which is zero and increases with time on stream. In contrast, the passivated (surface-oxidized) bulk catalyst is initially selective to propylene.
The reactions of n-butane over Mo oxycarbide have been extensively studied by Ledoux et al.,6, 10, 14 who described a carbon-modified MoCxOy phase being selective to C4 olefin products in a H2/C4H10/H2O feed. Reduction of the H2O content leads to reduction of the oxycarbide and increasing selectivity to hydrogenolysis. A comparative study by Thompson et al.7 contrasted the relative product selectivities in butane activation over the Group 5 and 6 transition-metal carbides. For Mo2C, the selectivities to dehydrogenation, isomerization, and hydrogenolysis are 62, 4, and 34 %, respectively. This appears incommensurate with the findings of Ledoux et al., however, the temperature-programmed reduction–carburization (TPRC) stopped at 660 °C and H2 pretreatment of the passivated sample was carried out at 480 °C. Under these conditions the carburization is likely incomplete and bulk oxygen, which is mobilized under the reaction conditions applied, will form an oxycarbide overlayer. It is also observed that the vanadium carbide materials were highly active for butane dehydrogenation.
We recently studied the formation mechanism of hcp β-Mo2C by carburization of hexagonal molybdenum oxide as well as the impact of its V doping (3 to 11%).15 CNT-supported systems have also been investigated in methanol steam reforming16 or higher alcohol synthesis.17 The present work concerns the reactivity of Mo2C and V-doped Mo2C in propane activation including a detailed analysis of the active surface with the aim to improve our knowledge on the relations between phase composition, surface chemistry, and reactivity of molybdenum carbides in catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons. The motivation arises particularly from the question as to whether the reducing gas mixture obtained in typical selective oxidation processes over, for example, Mo/V mixed oxide catalysts beyond full O2 conversion could lead to the formation of carbide phases, at least near the reactor outlet, and related changes in the product distribution. At the same time, the reactivity study will provide basic strategies to shift the selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane towards propylene. Thus, as the oxidation state of Mo controls its catalytic performance, the chemical potential of the reactant mixture was systematically varied by adding H2, O2, H2O, and CO2 to the C3H8/N2 feed.
Results and Discussion
Reactivity in propane dehydrogenation: Catalytic experiments on undoped β-Mo2C reveal that the critical temperature for stable operation conditions in the oxygen-free feed is in between 500–550 °C (Figure 1). Here, equilibrium conversions of propane dehydrogenation range from 20–30 %.18 Although the carbide phase is stable, deposition of carbonaceous species as shown in a quasi in situ Raman experiment (Figure 2) leads to a rapid decrease in activity with time on stream at the higher temperatures. This adverse effect is also prominent on Pt- or Cr-based systems,19 which, however, can easily be regenerated by oxidation with air.20 Propane conversions in our experiments are rather low (<5 %), however, the formation rate of propylene over β-Mo2C in the pseudo-steady state is among the highest reported at 500 °C (Figure 1).

The general product spectrum is indicative for propane dehydrogenation to propylene and primary hydrogenolysis to CH4 and C2H6 as the main reactions. CH4 excess (S> S) points at the secondary ethane hydrogenolysis to CH4, whereas C2H4 can be formed by both the dehydrogenation of C2H6 and the hydrogenolysis of propylene. Dominance of the latter is revealed by the S–X plot (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). In sharp contrast, increasing C2H6 selectivity points at the hydrogenation of C2H4, according to the tenfold lower equilibrium constant of ethane dehydrogenation and H2 excess in the feed.18 The latter, however, is a common strategy to reduce coke formation. These results nicely agree with moderate propylene selectivities obtained over freshly carburized Mo2C and Mo2C/SiO2 catalysts.4 Also over Pt-based catalysts a pronounced evolution of dehydrogenation selectivity is observed,19 which can be likely referred to equilibration of carbon and oxygen species on the active catalyst surface.
Process of coke formation: The oxycarbide overlayer generated on as-prepared carbides by 0.5 % O2/He passivation is completely removed under the reaction conditions applied, as indicated by the initial formation of CO, after which the catalytic performance of the passivated catalyst is identical to that of the as-prepared one (Figure 1 and Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The process of coke formation on the catalyst surface can be monitored by Raman spectroscopy, where typical bands located at 1360 and 1580 cm−1, the so-called D- and G-bands,21 indicate the presence of disordered and graphitic carbon, respectively. The as-prepared catalyst is free of these features, which confirms the optimized preparation process avoiding the formation of a coke overlayer by extended carburization.15 At 500 °C, weak bands slowly arise, whereas the catalyst used at 550 °C is characterized by heavy coke deposition (Figure 2). Similar observations are made on Pt-based catalysts.19 However, the analysis in terms of D- and G-bands is too simplified as all (polymeric) species contribute their skeletal vibrations. This can be seen in the dynamics of deposition/hydrogenation in the first 4 h (see Figures 1 and 2) and later by the fact that carbon deposition runs into a steady state despite continuous addition of potential feed molecules for soot formation. The large contribution of reaction conditions is seen in the massive profile change from in-situ to ex-situ coming from the fact that during isolation of the sample massive hydrogenation/deposition takes place and the ex-situ surface is covered by a polymer/molecular film rather than by coke (see white coke and black coke in zeolites22). The cooling prevents dehydrogenation of initial molecular deposits. Regarding reactivity, it is evident, that coke formation and the dynamics of surface carbon affect the hydrogenolysis to CH4 and C2H6 to a much larger extent than the selective dehydrogenation (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information).
Dynamics of carbide phases: The penetration of surface carbon into the catalyst bulk was investigated by TPRC (Tmax=600 °C) of the hexagonal h-MoO3 precursor with propane. Here, the fcc α-phase is formed (Figure 3). Compared to CH4,15 longer-chain hydrocarbons lead to this thermodynamically unstable phase, as a consequence of weaker CH bonds leading to a low phase transformation temperature. The evolution of CO as the indicator for bulk carburization begins at 450 °C, proving the vital carbide formation and regeneration to be relevant under the reaction conditions applied. It supports healing of passivated Mo2C under propane dehydrogenation conditions (Figure 1).

The pronounced formation of hydrogenolysis products CH4 and C2H6 peaking at 500 °C points at partially reduced phases (MoO2, MoOxCy) being responsible for this side-reaction, whereas the formation of propylene increases with the release of CO, however, drops at full reduction of the catalyst. A low-temperature shoulder (350–420 °C) indicates that propylene is not only formed by dehydrogenation but propane could also act as the reducing agent for MoVI via oxidative dehydrogenation,23, 24 yielding propylene and H2O. Considering the mobility of O2− this may explain the weak shift of C3H6 with respect to CO evolution curves (Figure 3). This experiment impressively underlines the delicate balance of the Mo oxidation state required for selective dehydrogenation catalysis.
Interestingly, β-Mo2C catalysts treated in C3H8/H2/N2 also contain small domains of metastable α-MoC1−x (invisible by XRD), which could be identified in the HRTEM analysis by selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) experiments (Figure 4, inset). This phase was not detected on the fresh catalyst sample. Such cubic sub-domains appear to be integrated within the matrix of the bulk carbide and potentially come about by means of a high-temperature recrystallization of the surface oxycarbide layer.

The effects of the dynamics of surface O and C in carbide catalysts on the performance necessitates a study of the stability and reactivity of Mo2C under different oxidative potentials (Table 1). Post mortem X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses after at least 10 h time-on-stream reveal that the carbide phase degenerates to MoO2 and MoO3 in the case of either H2O or O2 addition to the C3H8/N2 feed. However, resistance against H2O can be achieved by adding H2 to the gas mixture. In the presence of H2O and CO2, additional side reactions can occur, namely steam reforming of propane and water–gas shift, which substantially lower the propene selectivities obtained. However, absolute propene productivities still exceed the pure propane feed by more than one order of magnitude. This can only in part be referred to the beneficial effect of H2.25 It is evident that mild oxidants such as H2O or CO2, if phase stability is provided by additional H2, can boost the catalyst activity either by improved coke removal or by tuning the oxidation state of Mo.

At this point it is of interest to compare the reaction rates over molybdenum carbide with chemically different systems studied in propane dehydrogenation: The formation rate of propylene over a 0.5 % Pt/Al2O3 catalyst19 at 600 °C in 25 % C3H8/H2 is in the range of 20–40 μmol g−1 min−1, strongly dependent on the degree of deactivation, which, however, occurs on a significantly shorter time-scale than for bulk Mo2C at 500 °C (Figure 1). At the higher temperature, however, C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity range from 15–50 % and 15–70 %, respectively. The formation rate of C3H6 increases after addition of Sn as promoter up to a level of 30–45 μmol g−1 min−1.19 Also, a 13 % Cr/Al2O3 catalyst26 at 550 °C in 9 % C3H8/He gives C3H6 formation rates ranging from 70–120 μmol g−1 h−1 at C3H8 conversions of 25–45 %. Similarly to the Mo2C system, a partially reduced Cr3+/Cr2+ state is discussed as the selective dehydrogenation site.11
Dynamics of electronic surface properties: We performed an in situ XPS study to clarify the origin of this promoting effect. Coke formation does not occur under low-pressure conditions. Instead, surface (aliphatic) carbon is rapidly removed in pure H2 at 600 °C leaving a clean carbide surface with some residual oxygen (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). The Mo2C catalyst was subsequently cooled to 500 °C and exposed to C3H8/H2/He (2:1:1). The surface of the carbide becomes progressively oxidized, which is due to the mobilization of residual oxygen in the carbide bulk. This process coupled with the related product spectrum illustrates a valuable picture of surface reactivity with respect to surface oxidation. A selection of the Mo 3d spectra as well as peak assignments and positions are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S4, Table S1). Still the reliable and accurate assignment of peaks in such a multi-component structure is very difficult. The complex electronic nature of Mo suboxides prevents their exact determination, and instead attempts have been made to present a consistent pattern of fitting for the data that may be gauged against the observed reactivity.
Metallic Mo0 and carbidic MoII peaks have been assigned to 3d5/2 features at around 227.8 and 228.3 eV, respectively. MoIV is divided into two separate species; the metallic screened (S) peak (metallic character; delocalized electrons) at 229.3 eV and a contribution from non-metallic unscreened (U) states (oxidic character; more localized electrons), which is observed as a broad doublet at 231 eV. Finally, a small feature at 232.7 eV is attributed to MoVI but this may also coincide with a shake-up peak of Mo0 (227.8 + 5.1 eV).27–31 The observed changes in surface oxidation are represented by the peak integrals plotted over time on stream (Figure 5). The metallic and carbidic surface is slowly oxidized over the first 3 h with a steadily growing contribution from MoIV (S). After 3–4 h the oxidation accelerates and results in a large increase in the MoIV (U) doublet. In parallel, the initial rate of C3H6 formation is high and drops as the formation rates of C2H4 and C4H8 rapidly increase within the first 2 h. Recombinative hydrocarbon formation products C2H4 and C4H8 are observed to decrease in parallel after 4–5 h. Apparently, the oxidation state of the surface is detrimental for the reaction switching between alkylidene recombination (metathesis) and dehydrogenation.

The valence band (VB) spectra recorded during the in situ run (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information) provide additional insight into the reaction mechanism. Throughout the reaction there is a significant electron occupation of the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi edge, implying that the system remains metallic. However, the VB spectra show a decreasing electronic density of states close to the Fermi edge and an increase of intensity at a binding energy of around 6 eV. This valence band region is typically dominated by O2p states in transition-metal oxides and thus reflects the progressing oxidation of the surface. In the final spectra it can be seen that the overlap between the Mo4d and O2p bands is strongly decreased to the point that the bands are almost discrete. The cross-sectional view through the VB spectra at binding energies of 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 eV illustrate the electron density at the Fermi edge, the Mo4d state, and at the overlapping region between the 4d and O2p states, respectively. While the DOS at the Fermi edge remains unchanged, the electron density in the Mo4d VB decreases strongly from t=4 to 6 h in concert with the observed formation of C2H4. Again, this is explained by an ongoing surface oxidation that reduces the number of Mo4d electrons in an ionic picture for metal oxides. While covalent bonding modifies the DOS Mo4d occupation, the general trend still holds. Moreover, the separation between the Mo4d and O2p states occurring from t=4 h, is observed to coincide with the decrease in C4H8 formation rate. Thus the observed changes in the valence band region support the interpretation/assignment of the Mo3d core level spectra.
Although rapid water–gas shift32 and consecutive steam reforming drastically alter the propane dehydrogenation product spectrum, the boosted formation rate of propylene in the presence of CO2 (Table 1) calls for detailed surface analysis. A more reducing feed of C3H8/H2/CO2=1:2:1 was applied in the in situ XPS analysis, keeping the catalyst in the reduced state. Unfortunately, due to problems with GC analysis (H2/C3H6 overlap), only the CO, CO2, and C2H4 traces could be extracted from the chromatograms. However, according to the ambient pressure catalytic experiment (see Table 1, and Figure S6 in the Supporting Information) it can be assumed that the evolution C2H4 and C3H6 product formation goes in parallel.
The initial formation rate of C2H4 inversely decreases to the rate of CO formation via the reverse water–gas shift (rWGS, Figure 6 a). This process coincides with a loss of oxygen (Figure 6 b). The O1s spectrum consists of a sharp line at around 530 eV, which is associated with structural oxygen and broad shoulders indicative for adsorbed and dissolved atomic oxygen species and OH groups. Different bond strengths of oxo- and carbo-species with respect to Mo in different oxidation states may be the driving force for the structural dynamics and reactivity equilibration. In Figure 6 the final O1s spectrum decreases slightly in intensity as rWGS appears to level off, and C2H4 formation further decreases. The Mo3d and C1s peaks are characteristic of the reduced Mo2C throughout (not shown). Again, a detrimental impact of oxygen in the catalyst on its performance is indicated, supporting the hypothesis that an oxygen-moderated carbide phase is more active for the dehydrogenation of alkanes.

Regarding the CO2 co-feed it must be mentioned that a positive influence of this gas on propane dehydration has also been reported for a silica-supported Mo2C catalyst.5 Here, it was concluded that above 773 K CO2 acts as the oxidizing agent to form a highly active and selective oxycarbide phase. This interpretation is supported by the present in situ XPS study performed on a bulk Mo2C system.
Impact of vanadium doping: We recently reported on the synthesis of mesoporous V-doped Mo2C materials15 and it is well known that V exhibits a higher oxophilicity than Mo. The addition of V strongly influences the carburization temperature of the hexagonal h-Mo1−xVxO3 precursors suggesting a stabilizing effect on the redox properties of the materials. Thus, moderate doping with oxygen could also be a key factor for the reactivity in this system. Here is an analogy to the Pt–Sn/Al2O3 system. The degree of the Sn reduction has been found to depend on the Sn loading, temperature of the pretreatment, and the presence of surface additives such as chlorine.33 Pt–Sn alloy phases in addition to oxidic tin states have been detected from in situ studies.34
The XPS analysis in vacuum shows that the surface of the V-doped catalyst is rich in oxygen but remains in an overall reduction state below MoO2. The spectra taken at higher kinetic energy indicate that the subsurface is predominantly carbidic. C1s spectra show two distinct maxima at Eb=285 and 283.3 eV, which relate to surface carbon (CC, CH, CO) and carbidic carbon, respectively. Depth profiling indicates that the surface is dominated by adventitious carbon, and that V doping leads to a larger contribution from associated carbon and oxygen species at the surface (Table 2). Thus, oxygen is to a large extent associated to this surface carbon deposit (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information) rather than being incorporated into the bulk. Notably, the surface V/Mo ratio of 0.4 in the carbide, which is only doped by 8 at % V, suggests that the immediate surface layer is highly enriched in V. Here, also an increase in subsurface carbon is observed in comparison to the undoped Mo2C. These observations suggest that the formation of the carbide has resulted in mobilization of the V atoms towards the surface.

The qualitative analysis of the V2p spectrum indicates that the primary structure consists of a broad doublet centered at 3d5/2 ≈ 515.8 eV. Comparison with energies reported in the literature suggests that the V atom is in a reduced oxidation state such as that found in V2O3.35 Electron energy loss spectra (EELS) were obtained for the samples to give information about the chemical states of the elements present in the matrix. As can be seen in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information, the Mo M edge is rather broad and has a small feature (M 4,5) at 227 eV and further features visible at 393 and 410 eV (M3, M2). A large peak was observed for the C K-edge, which is indicative of the presence of sp2-bonded carbon that is in agreement with the Raman spectra (Figure 2). The final feature of note is the doublet peak observed at about 515 eV for the V L-edge. As was observed for the XPS in vacuum the energy range of the 3d5/2 peak suggests that the vanadium is in an intermediate oxidation state (V3+).
These observations can be related with the catalytic performance in propane DH (Table 1). Unfortunately, the binary carbide is less stable in the presence of H2O (and CO2) in the feed and partially decomposes into MoO2, likely due to the higher oxophilicity of V. Thus, stable operation conditions can only be obtained in H2-containing mixtures. Indeed the formation rate of propylene at 500 °C, C3H8/H2/N2=25/55/20 and 5000 mL g−1 h−1 almost doubles from 10.2 to 18.0 μmol g−1 min−1 for the Mo2C catalyst as the result of 8 % V dopant, which can only in part be explained by the slightly higher specific surface area (Table 2). As the apparent activation energy increases from 80 to 88 kJ mol−1 for Mo2C and (Mo0.92V0.08)2C, respectively, this activity change must be linked with the generation of additional active sites, most likely associated with surface oxygen. Evidently, the oxycarbide provides a higher catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation than the pure carbide does.
Conclusion
The following picture of the active surface can be drawn (Figure 7). The dehydrogenation reactions are independent of other reactions, while CH4 can be formed by hydrogenolysis of propane or propylene. Strong hydrogenolysis sites are defined as those that can activate CC single bonds such as in propane, whereas weak sites are defined as those that can only activate propylene. This explains a disparity between the selectivity to ethylene/ethane and CH4, which is seen in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. Alkyl-recombinative sites leading to C4 products can only be observed on the clean surface in high-vacuum. Based on the in situ XPS analysis and in close agreement with literature reports for bulk and supported MoC catalysts,4 we can ascribe the dehydrogenation pathways to the presence of residual oxygen in the carbide. This finding goes in parallel with more common Cr/Al2O3 or Pt–Sn/Al2O3 systems. As the reaction progresses at ≥ 500 °C, the strong hydrogenolysis sites are deactivated by carbon deposition, which can serve as an additional source of CH4 formation via methanation. At higher temperatures TPRC reveals that surface oxygen is stripped in the course of entire carburization, leading to a loss of dehydrogenation sites. It means that the molybdenum carbide system requires a delicate control of reaction parameters as surface carbon deposits cannot be removed by facile combustion in air. Two strategies of stabilization of the selective sites for propylene formation have been proposed in the present work: i) the addition of mildly oxidizing H2O or CO2 to the feed (the latter is rapidly converted to H2O via rWGS), and ii) the addition of V as an oxophilic dopant for the Mo2C catalyst. However, the optimization of the process conditions requires a balance between phase stability, coking, activity, and selectivity, which are all senstitive to the variation of reaction conditions.

Moreover, this study proves that carbide phases of Mo and V are unstable in the presence of H2O or CO2, which are typically present in high concentrations in the product stream of selective oxidation reactions, whereas stabilizing H2 is absent here. Thus, a non-oxidative conversion in the oxygen-free regime via consecutive dehydrogenation pathways over such reduced catalyst states is rather unlikely.
Experimental Section
Catalyst preparation: Details of catalyst preparation as well as basic characterization is reported elsewhere.15, 32 Briefly, β-Mo(1−x)VxO3 carbides were prepared by TPRC in 20 % CH4/H2 in a rotary furnace with a maximum temperature of 675 °C. After cooling, samples were passivated in 0.5 % O2/He, or transferred into a glove box before further processing.
Catalytic testing: The catalyst bed was fixed between two quartz wool plugs in the isothermal zone (±0.5 K) of a U-shaped quartz reactor (inner diameter: 4 mm) located in a Carbolite furnace. The complete set-up was located in a heating box. All reactions were carried out over 295 mg catalyst mixed 1:1 by weight with SiC (sieve fraction 250–355 μm). Gas analysis was carried out with an Agilent 5890 GC equipped with FID for analysis of hydrocarbons and TCD for determination of CO2, O2, N2, CO, and H2O.
Raman spectroscopy: Catalysts in the form of pressed wafers were analyzed with a Horiba Jobin LABRAM microscope. All spectra were recorded for 60 s with the average of 3 accumulations at a magnification of 100X using an MPlan Olympus objective with an aperture value of 0.9. The light source was a 20 mW He-Ne laser with λ=632.8 nm. Quasi in situ Raman spectra were obtained by the use of a custom designed SiO2 cell. The design of the cell allowed for the sample to be heated in a tube furnace under reaction conditions (gas flow, temperature, precursor analysis by GC) and periodically removed to record Raman spectra through a SiO2 window without air contact.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy: Experiments were performed at the ISISS beamline at the BESSY II synchrotron facility in Berlin. All samples were transferred without air contact. In situ measurements were performed at 0.3 mbar under flow conditions and the gas-phase composition was monitored by QMS and GC. The sample was heated by a laser from the rear, which was incident on the stainless steel backing plate of the sample holder. Ex situ spectra were recorded at two positions on each sample. The Fermi edge was measured at each energy to correct for charging phenomena. Subtraction of a Shirley background and peak fitting was carried out using CasaXPS™ software. Gauss–Lorentzian peak shapes were applied for peaks with oxidic character, whereas a Doniach–Sunjic profile was used for metallic components.
Transmission electron microscopy: TEM investigations were carried out with a Philips CM 200 FEG (Philips) equipped with a Gatan Image Filter (Gatan, Warrendale, PA) and a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera at 200 kV. HAADF-STEM and HRTEM investigations were carried out on a TITAN 80–300 (FEI) equipped with a Cs-corrector.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
