Design and synthesis of the honeycomb PtSnNa/ZSM-5 monolithic catalyst for propane dehydrogenation
Abstract
A novel PtSnNa/ZSM-5 monolithic catalyst was designed and synthesized for the propane dehydrogenation reaction, which was a significant transformation in industry. Experimental results showed that although the propane conversion and the propylene selectivity gradually fell down along with the reaction time, the descent speed of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 monolithic catalyst was slower than that of the granule catalyst and the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the reaction with monolithic catalyst still remained at a high level after 12 hr. The monolithic catalyst had regular pore structure that facilitated the separation of the product from the catalyst and reduced the limitation on internal and external diffusion and mass transfer, and led to the high catalytic activity and stability. The catalyst could be easily fabricated and was of highly industrial application potential.
1 INTRODUCTION
Dehydrogenation of low-carbon alkanes is a very important chemical process for producing alkenes, among which, propylene is a very important chemical intermediate for the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acetone, etc.1 The dehydrogenation reaction of propane is one of the most important methods to produce propylene and the PtSn-based catalysts are majorly employed in the reaction owing to the high catalytic activity of Pt2 and the resultant good propylene selectivity of the reaction.3 In PtSn-based catalysts, the structures and surface properties of the support and the metal additives could directly affect the catalyst performances and stability. Porous materials such as the ZSM-5,4 Al2O3,5 SBA-15,6 MCM-41,7 SAPO-348 and TiO29 are widely employed as catalyst supports for their large specific surface area and tunable surface acidity. Metal additives, such as Sn,10 In,11 Ce12 and Zn13 could adjust the interaction between the catalytically active components and the supports to enhance the catalytic activity. The alkali metals such as Na14 and K15 are employed as the alkali additives to adjust the catalyst surface acidity so that the side-reactions caused by the excessive acidity could be restrained.
The process of propane dehydrogenation to propylene is affected by the characteristics of the reaction, catalysts, reactors etc. Previously, in order to obtain high propylene yield, attentions are usually paid to the development of efficient catalysts, or only to the study of reactors, but seldom to the combination of the factors on the reaction characteristics, the catalyst development and the reactor design, resulting in the failure to give full play to the performances of catalyst and reactor. During our continuous investigations on novel catalytic systems,16 recently, we designed and synthesized a type of monolithic catalyst of honeycomb PtSnNa/ZSM-5 for the reaction. In the material, Pt and Sn were the major components of the catalyst, while ZSM-5 was used as the support containing Al-O and Si-O bonds and possessing very large specific surface area and unique channel structures. The catalyst surface acidity could be adjusted by the molar ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 as well as the incorporated Na. Experimental results showed that the catalyst is more active and stable than traditional granular catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reaction to produce propylene. Herein, we wish to report our findings.
2 EXPERIMENTAL
2.1 Preparation of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 monolithic catalyst
H4SiO4, Al[OCH (CH3)2]3 and TPAOH were mixed together at the molar ratio of 100/2/10. The mixture was covered to the cordierite and dried at 100 °C for 3 hr. After heating at 175 °C for 48 hr in hydrothermal reactor, the material was washed to neutral, dried and baked at 500 °C for 8 hr in air. The HZSM-5/cordierite material was obtained after the ion exchange in 1 mol/L NH4Cl and then immersed in the aqueous solution of NaCl (1.4 × 10−3 mol/l) and SnCl4 (2.3 × 10−4 mol/l) at 80 °C for 1 hr. The material was dried at 120 °C for 2 hr and baked in air at 500 °C for 4 hr. The successive immersion in the aqueous HCl solution of 0.12 mg/ml H2PtCl6 for 12 hr led to the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 monolithic catalyst, which was dried and calcined at 500 °C in air for 4 hr. The catalyst was then treated by steam at 500 °C for 4 hr for dechlorination and was reduced by H2 at 500 °C for 2 hr. Pt and Sn contents were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) on Optima 5300DV ICP equipment.
2.2 Catalyst characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were acquired on a ARL X'TRA X-ray diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The scanning range (2θ) ranged from 2–80o at 20o/min. The applied voltage and current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively.
The materials were characterized by JEOL-6700F Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope and Titan 80/300 S/TEM Field Emission Scanning-Transmission Electron Microscope.
The BET surface areas were obtained by N2 adsorption using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. About 100 mg of the samples were degassed at 300 °C to a vacuum below 0.4 Pa for 3 h before measurement.
2.3 Catalytic activity evaluation
The catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation was evaluated on a micro catalytic reaction device designed by our group. The internal diameter of stainless-steel tube reactor was 2.5 cm, and the height is 65 cm. 0.7 g of catalyst (Φ2.5 cm*3 cm, triangular straight channel with 300 holes/square inch) was placed 33 cm from the top of the reaction tube in this reaction. The products were collected each hour and he reaction conditions were as follows: T = 59°oC; H2, P = 0.1 MPa, C3H8/H2 = 3/1(vol/vol) with WHSV = 155 h-1.
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Characterization of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 monolithic catalyst
The support of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 monolithic catalyst was cordierite, which was formed by the oxides of Al and Si, containing Al-O and Si-O bonds. Therefore, ZSM-5 could be prepared in situ on cordierite and was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, as shown in Figure 1. Compared with the XRD spectrum of cordierite (Figure 1, curves a) and ZSM-5 (Figure 1, curves b) with ZSM-5/cordierite samples (Figure 1, curves c–f), the characteristic peaks of ZSM-5 emerged at 7-9o and 23-25o on ZSM-5/cordierite samples, attesting that the ZSM-5 was successfully synthesized in situ on the cordierite support. Besides, with the increase of ZSM-5 content, the characteristic peaks of ZSM-5 gradually enhanced.

The XRD patterns of monolithic PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts with different HCl concentration were measured and shown in Figure 2. It was only found the diffraction lines of ZSM-5/cordierite supports and no obvious diffraction peaks of Pt,Sn and Na were observed, reflecting that the metal clusters were uniformly dispersed on support surface. On the other hand, no obvious diffraction peaks change with the different HCl concentration, indicating the HCl had no impact on the catalysts structures.

The materials morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), as shown in Figure 3. The thickness of ZSM-5 layer in the material was estimated to be 53 μm and it was tightly combined with the cordierite support without crack (Figure 2a). In the ZSM-5 layer, the particles are in a regular size distribution and a variety of gaps existed in the material, which allowed the propane and propylene molecules diffusing (Figure 2b).

The BET surface area, pore volume and pore size were measured and summarized in Table 1. It was found with the increase of ZSM-5 loading, the BET area of monolithic PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts were gradually increased (Table 1, entries 1–4), indicating the ZSM-5 was benefit for increasing the catalysts surface areas. However, the pore volumes and pore sizes didn't change too much.

3.2 Effect of the uploaded ZSM-5 amount on the catalytic performances
Amount of the in situ synthesized ZSM-5 on honeycomb cordierite support determined the thickness of the layer and changed the channel configurations, so that the mass transfer and heat transfer processes of the catalyst were influenced.17 By multiple coatings of the ZSM-5 precursor, a series of catalyst with different ZSM-5 weight were prepared. Under the conditions of 590 °C, 0.1 MPa pressure and with n(C3H8): n(H2) = 3:1, the as-prepared catalysts were evaluated.
As shown in Figure 4, with the increasing of the ZSM-5 content from 3.3 to 6.7 wt.%, both of the propane conversion ratio and the propylene selectivity were enhanced. The changes became smaller with the ZSM-5 content at 6.7 wt.% to 8.7 wt.%. With the monolithic catalyst containing of 8.7 wt.% ZSM-5, the reaction afforded the highest propane conversion at 19.4% and the best selectivity of propylene at 88.7% (Figure 5). In regardless of the ZSM-5 amount, the propane flow in unit time and weight of catalyst was constant. The higher ZSM-5 amount resulted in the elevated airspeed of propane and the propylene selectivity.

3.3 Effect of the Pt distribution on the catalytic performances
The Pt distributions of the catalyst were influenced by the aqueous HCl concentration of the H2PtCl6 being used in catalyst preparation, resulting in the changes of the catalyst activity. Parallel experimental results showed that under the conditions of 590 °C, propane airspeed 155 h−1 and 0.1 MPa pressure and with n(C3H8):n(H2) = 3:1, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity decreased along with the reaction time and the catalyst prepared with 0.048 g/L HCl concentration afforded the highest propane conversion and propylene selectivity (Figure 6,7).

As shown in Figure 8, after 12 hr reaction, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity rose initially with the HCl concentration during the catalyst preparation process and reached their peaks at the 0.048 g/L HCl concentration. Further elevated HCl concentration led to the reduced catalyst activity, probably due to the competitive adsorption between Cl− and PtCl62− on ZSM-5 support.

3.4 Comparison of the monolithic catalyst with granular catalyst
The catalytic performances of the monolithic catalyst and granular catalyst were tested simultaneously for comparison and the results were illustrated in Figure 9. The catalytic activities of both catalysts turned to be stable along with the reaction time. After 12 hr reaction, the monolithic catalyst led to the propane conversion at 24.78% and propylene selectivity at 98.39%, which showed better performances than that of the granular catalyst. The disordered arrangement of granular catalysts in fixed-bed reactor and the resultant diffusion restriction probably led to their poor activity. During the reaction process, the produced propylene inevitably contacted and reacted with the granular catalysts, which not only reduced the contact of propane with the active center, but also led to the deep dehydrogenation of propylene reducing its selectivity. The monolithic catalyst with ZSM-5 support possessed regular straight channel structures with large geometric surface area and good heat and mass transfer performances. In propane dehydrogenation process, the concentration of propane inside the channels was higher than that on the surface, facilitating the diffusion of the chemical into the fluid. The regular straight channel structures in monolithic catalyst enhanced the contact of propane and reduced the contact time of propylene, so that the deep dehydrogenation side-reactions could be well restrained.

4 CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the novel honeycomb PtSnNa/ZSM-5 monolithic catalyst was designed and successfully synthesized via the in-situ generation of ZSM-5 on cordierite being followed by the immersion to upload the catalytic species and additives. The monolithic catalyst showed advanced catalytic activities versus traditional granular catalyst owing to its regular channel structures allowing the diffusion of the reactant and product, leading to obviously enhanced propane conversion and propylene selectivity. The catalyst is very stable and possesses profound industrial application prospect.
