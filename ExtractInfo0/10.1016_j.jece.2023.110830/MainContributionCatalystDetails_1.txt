The given document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation. It discusses a process involving propane dehydrogenation integrated with a membrane reactor and solid oxide fuel cell, but does not provide details on any specific catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The document focuses more on the process modeling, economic analysis, and life cycle assessment rather than improvements in catalyst performance for propane to propylene conversion.
