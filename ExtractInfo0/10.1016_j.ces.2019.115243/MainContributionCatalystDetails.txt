Based on the multiple document extractions provided, the documents do not seem to contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The documents focus on propane pyrolysis using phenyl radicals, and do not discuss any specific catalysts, processes, or performance related to propane dehydrogenation. Since the documents are not relevant, I have indicated "No" for relevance and have not included any scientific contribution details.
