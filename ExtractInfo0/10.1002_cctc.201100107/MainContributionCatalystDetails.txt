Unfortunately, based on the provided excerpts, there does not appear to be enough relevant information to generate a meaningful unified summary for the propane dehydrogenation research described across the documents. The excerpts indicate the documents examine propane activation and dehydrogenation activity over various zeolite catalysts, but do not directly discuss propane dehydrogenation for propylene production or provide details on catalyst optimization and performance. As such, I cannot construct a cohesive XML summary with the requested details on the catalyst, enhancements, and scientific contributions. Please provide more complete source documents containing pertinent information if an integrated summary is needed.
