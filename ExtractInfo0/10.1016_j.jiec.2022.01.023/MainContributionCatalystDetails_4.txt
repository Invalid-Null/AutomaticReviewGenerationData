 Based on the document, this does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene. The document discusses selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx using NH3 over ceria-promoted manganese titanium oxide catalysts. While it explores different catalyst preparation methods and their effects on performance, it is not about converting propane to propylene specifically.
