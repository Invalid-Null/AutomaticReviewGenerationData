•
The metal loading method highly influenced the metal distribution and NO/NH3 adsorption/desorption behavior.

Abstract
Although the metal loading sequence can highly influence the bimetallic catalyst performance, they are generally applied to the reaction experiments without investigating the metal impregnation sequence. In this study, therefore, we investigated the surface properties of CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts with different impregnation sequences of Mn and Ce in the low-temperature selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by NH3. We observed that the catalyst performance depended on simply changing the impregnation method of Mn and Ce in the catalyst activity test for the low-temperature SCR reaction. The co-impregnated catalyst, Mn-Ce/TiO2, achieved much higher NO conversion than other catalysts. Additionally, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, N2 adsorption/desorption experiments, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NO/NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NO/NH3-TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were performed to identify the influence of this simple change on the catalyst. These characterization results indicated that metal dispersion improved in the co-impregnated catalyst compared to the sequentially impregnated catalysts, and these well-distributed metal particles (Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst) could produce defect formation on the catalyst, thereby serving more NOx/NH3 adsorption sites. Moreover, it was found that catalyst acidity could be simply controlled by changing synthesis method although it contained same metal composition. This knowledge will be useful for the design of catalyst for low temperature NH3-SCR of NO.

Introduction
Nitrogen oxide (NOx) from stationary sources, such as combustion and coal-fired power plants, are emitted into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to the formation of acid rain and smog and depletion of ozone [1], [2], [3]. These emissions can be reduced by modifying the plant processes or installing air pollution control equipment [1], [2], [3]. Among these methods, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO using ammonia (NH3) as the reducing agent has proven to be the most efficient and economical method for removing NOx from flue gas. In the NH3-SCR process, catalyst plays a vital role in determining the deNOx efficiency and overall cost associated with the SCR system. Currently, vanadium-based catalysts, including V2O5-WO3/TiO2, V2O5-MoO3/TiO2, and V2O5-WO3(MoO3)/TiO2 [4], [5], [6], [7], with an operating temperature of approximately 300–420 °C, are used as commercial catalysts at medium to high temperatures [4], [5], [7]. Typically, the SCR system is installed upstream of the desulfurizer and electrostatic precipitator because of the working temperature of the vanadium-based catalyst [5], [7]. However, the catalyst surface in this location is often covered with a high concentration of dust that prevents the adsorption of NH3 and NOx; therefore, catalyst deactivation is inevitable [1], [2]. Furthermore, high concentrations of alkali metals, arsenic, and other substances in fly ash from flue gas lead to catalyst poisoning and increase the operating cost of the plant system [8], [9]. Thus, developing a high-performance catalyst that can be utilized at low temperatures and located downstream of the desulfurizer and electrostatic precipitator is pivotal to meeting the demand of the industry [2], [8].
Recently, Mn-based TiO2 catalysts have been regarded as promising materials for the low-temperature NH3-SCR of NO owing to their variable valence states and high redox ability [10]. Furthermore, Mn-based catalysts have gained extensive attention in academia and industry owing to its low cost and excellent catalytic performance. However, Mn/TiO2 catalyst without a promoter (such as Fe, Cu, Ce, and Nb) is rapidly deactivated, thus requiring bimetallic catalyst modified by any additives [11], [12], [13], [14].
Among these materials for promoters, ceria (CeO2) is a widely used in the Mn/TiO2 modification because the addition of CeO2 improves catalyst redox ability and surface acidity, which are essential for NH3-SCR of NO [15]. Ke et al. reported that the catalyst acidity could be highly influenced by the amount of impregnated metal oxide on CeO2, thereby improving the adsorption ability of NH3 [16]. They also reported that CeO2 could improve or inhibit the catalyst performance and selectivity, depending on the ratio of Ce/Ti [16]. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the influence of the CeO2 addition method, for instance, the CeO2 addition sequence, presuming that the surface properties of Mn/TiO2 catalyst are sensitive to the added amount of CeO2.
The selection of the most suited impregnation sequence in catalysts using more than two transition metal oxides has always been debatable. In the case of propane dehydrogenation studied by Liu et al., the catalyst with K impregnated before the Cr loading (Cr/K/Al2O3) exhibited higher propene selectivity than that synthesized with the opposite impregnation sequence (K/Cr/Al2O3) [17]. They also reported the formation of polymeric Cr species in the Cr/K/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to higher catalytic activity and selectivity [17]. Another study reported by Shiau et al. demonstrated higher catalytic activity of the Ce/Cu/Al2O3 catalyst compared to the Cu/Ce/Al2O3 catalyst for the CO oxidation [18]. These experimental results suggested that the catalyst preparation process could determine the metal dispersion, and small Cu species could strongly interact with CeO2, leading to good performance [18].
Although the catalytic performance varies greatly depending on the metal impregnation sequence, many studies using bimetallic catalysts disregard its importance. Therefore, based on the above literature, we aimed to investigate the surface properties in CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts with different impregnation sequences of Mn and Ce. Mn/TiO2 catalyst was synthesized as the reference catalyst. X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption/desorption experiments, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NO/NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NO/NH3-TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were performed to identify the influence of this simple change on the catalyst.
Experimental
Catalyst preparation
CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts were synthesized by the impregnation method. Manganese nitrate (97 %, Junsei) and cerium nitrate (99 %, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as metal precursors, and the loading amounts of Mn and Ce were fixed at 10 wt%. The anatase-type of TiO2 (G5, CristalACTiV) was used as a support and was pre-calcined in the air at 500 °C for 4 h. The Mn/Ce/TiO2 catalyst was prepared using the sequential impregnation method. For Mn/Ce/TiO2 catalyst, Ce was initially impregnated on TiO2, and the prepared Ce/TiO2 was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h. Subsequently, Mn was loaded onto Ce/TiO2, and the Mn/Ce/TiO2 was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h. Furthermore, the Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst was prepared using the co-impregnation method. After the co-impregnation process, the Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst was calcined in air at 500 °C for 4 h. The Ce/Mn/TiO2 catalyst was prepared using the sequential impregnation method. For Ce/Mn/TiO2 catalyst, Mn was initially impregnated on TiO2, and the prepared Mn/TiO2 was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h. After that, Ce was loaded onto Mn/TiO2, and the Ce/Mn/TiO2 was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h. Mn/TiO2 catalyst as the reference catalyst was also prepared by the impregnation method for understanding the influence of CeO2.
ICP-OES analysis was performed to ensure the metal compositions in Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts and shown in Table 1.

Characterization
The BET surface area of the catalysts was measured by N2 physisorption at –196 °C using a BELSORP-max (BEL Japan. Inc.). The crystal structures of the as-prepared catalysts were investigated by XRD using a D/MAX-2500 (Rigaku) equipped with Cu-Kα radiation. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas, total pore volumes, and N2 isotherms were estimated for powdered samples by N2 adsorption at − 196 °C using a BELSORP-max (BEL Japan, Inc). TEM images were obtained using an FEI Tecnai G2 F30 TEM (FEI Co.) at 300 keV, equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector with Schottky field-emission type electron source. Raman spectra of samples were collected using a LabRam Aramis (Horiba Jobin Yvon) spectrometer and Lorenz curve fitting was used for analysis. The excitation source was a 532 nm line from a Nd-YAG laser.
H2-TPR analysis was carried out in an Autochem 2950 HP (Micromeritics). In H2-TPR experiment, 100 mg of a sample was mounted onto a quartz tube and pretreated in a flow of 10 %O2 in He at 200 °C for 1 h. After pretreatment, TPR experiments were performed in the temperature range of 50 – 700 °C using 10 % H2/Ar using a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1. NH3-TPD and NO-TPD experiments were performed using an AutoChem 2950 HP (Micromeritics). For NH3-TPD analysis, the sample was pretreated in He at 200 °C for 1 h to remove any impurities and cooled to 50 °C. Subsequently, the He gas flow was switched to 10 vol% NH3/He for 30 min to adsorb NH3 species on the catalyst surface, and the sample was purged for 30 min with He to desorb the physically adsorbed NH3. TPD analysis was initiated in the temperature range of 50–400 °C using He at a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1. Before the NO-TPD experiments, the samples were pretreated in a flow of He at 200 °C for 1 h, followed by purging and cooling at 50 °C. The samples were exposed to 0.5 % NO/He for 30 min and then purged with He. After the pretreatment, NO-TPD was conducted up to 400 °C in a He with a flow rate of 10 °C min−1.
The surface electron state and concentration of the reduced samples were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS profiles were obtained on a K-alpha plus (Thermo Scientific, UK) using Al-Ka radiation (hv = 1486.6 eV) at a constant energy of 50 eV. The binding energy was aligned using the C 1 s transition at 285 eV. The relative concentrations were calculated through peak fitting and using the areas under the fitted components.
FTIR analyses were performed in a ceramic IR cell with ZnSe windows, using a PIKE Technologies diffuse reflectance IR accessory attached to a Nicolet iS10 IR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The spectrometer was equipped with an HgCdTe (mercury cadmium telluride) detector operated with liquid nitrogen. Absorbance spectra were recorded using the KBr pellet method. Before each IR spectral acquisition, the samples were pretreated at 200 °C in the He gas flow to remove impurities. The as-prepared catalysts were exposed to NH3 gas or NO and 3 % O2 in N2 balance gas for 30 min to adsorb NH3 or NO species, respectively, on the catalyst surface at room temperature. The samples were subsequently introduced to He for 30 min to remove weakly adsorbed species on the surface.
Catalytic reaction
The low-temperature catalytic reaction was tested in the range of 100–200 °C in a fixed-bed flow reactor with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 60,000 h−1. The experimental temperature was measured using a K-type thermocouple inserted directly in the center of the catalyst bed. Before each catalytic reaction, the catalyst was pretreated with 10 % O2/N2 balance at 200 °C for 1 h, then lowered the temperature to the desired temperature. The reactant gas mixture consisted of 500 ppm NO, 500 ppm NH3, 3 vol% O2, and balanced N2, which were introduced into the catalytic reactor. All the data were collected after the SCR reaction reached a steady state for more than 30 min at each temperature point. The NOx concentration was measured using a VARIO plus online NOx analyzer (MRU GmbH). The effluent gases, N2O and NH3, were monitored using a Sensonic IR-1 infrared gas analyzer (Madur Polska). The NO conversion and N2 selectivity are defined as follows:
where [NO]in, and [NH3]in correspond to the concentrations of NOx and NH3 at the inlet of the reactor, respectively. [NO]out, [NH3]out, and [N2O]out correspond to the concentrations of NO, NH3, and N2O measured at the outlet of the reactor, respectively.
Results and discussion
Catalytic performance
The low-temperature NH3-SCR of NO over Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts were tested in the range of 100–200 °C with a GHSV of 60,000 h−1. Fig. 1(A) shows the NO conversion over Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts. All the catalysts initiated the SCR reaction below 100 °C. The Mn/Ce/TiO2 and Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalysts achieved higher NO conversion than the Mn/TiO2 catalyst on increasing the reaction temperature, while Ce/Mn/TiO2 catalyst only achieved less than 40 %. The N2 selectivity was stable over the entire reaction temperature range for all the catalysts, given in Fig. 1(B), with a small amount of N2O byproducts via the ammonia oxidation reaction (2NH3 + 2O2 → N2O + 3H2O). Therefore, it is suggested that the metal impregnation sequence highly influenced the catalytic activity of CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 for the low-temperature NH3-SCR of NO and did not influence the N2 selectivity.

Generally, inhibition gas of NH3-SCR of NO, like H2O and SO2 are produced at combustion plants [19], [20]. These gases are competitively adsorbed on the active sites of the catalyst, causing deterioration of catalytic performance. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the effect of such inhibition gases for catalyst using NH3-SCR reaction of NO. Experiments were conducted in the presence of 3 % H2O to confirm that Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promtoed Mn/TiO2 catalysts exhibit resistance to H2O, given in Fig. 2. The NO conversion was noted to be influenced by H2O. When H2O was injected in the feed gas, NO conversion is highly decreased, especially low temperature regime, but Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst still showed better catalytic activity compared to others. Gas-switching experiments for NH3-SCR reaction of NO were carried out as a function of time-on-stream, as given in Fig. 3. 100 ppm of SO2 gas was injected into the fixed-bed reactor at 200 °C. As clearly shown, the catalytic activity decreases when the SO2 is added in the feed stream, and furthermore, NO conversion is not recovered to original conversion in the absence of SO2. However, there is an interesting point that degree of deactivation is different on as-prepared catalysts. CeO2 is well known material that has the resistance to SO2 during NH3-SCR reaction. In this gas-switching experiments, resistance property is clearly presented. For Mn/TiO2 without CeO2, NO conversion is rapidly decreased in the presence of SO2. On the other hand, CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts have resistance to SO2. In particular, Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst has highly stable NO conversion for long time in the presence of SO2. It is evident that the Mn and Ce impregnation method onto TiO2 can significantly influence the catalytic activity toward the NH3-SCR of NO.

Because all the CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts tested used the same amount of Mn and Ce (see Table 1), it could be considered that the significant differences in the deNOx activity performance were attributable to the metal loading method and not to the metal composition. Thus, XRD, BET surface area, TEM-EDS, H2-TPR, XPS, FTIR, and NO/NH3-TPD analyses were performed to investigate the effect of the metal loading method.
Catalyst characterization
Textural and structural properties
Fig. 4 illustrates the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of the Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4(A), all catalysts illustrate a typical Type-IV isotherm (defined by IUPAC) with an evident hysteresis in the range of 0.06–0.9 P/P0, indicating the well-developed pore structure of the catalysts. The pore size distribution of each sample is calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method, as shown in Fig. 4(B). The Mn/TiO2 catalyst had pore sizes varying in the range of 2–80 nm (meso- and macropores), while the CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalyst mainly had mesopores with diameters in the range of 2–50 nm. This variation was attributed to the blocked large pores of loaded metal oxides, Mn and Ce. Textural properties of the Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts are summarized in Table 2. The specific surface area, total pore volume, and average pore size decreased on the addition of CeO2 as compared to Mn/TiO2 catalyst due to the decrease in the amount of the anatase TiO2 support [10]. For CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts, the as-prepared samples had almost similar textural properties, implying that the impregnation sequence of Mn and Ce had slight influence on the textural properties, which are good agreement with results reported by Liu and co-workers [17].

XRD analysis was conducted to investigate the variations in the crystalline structure of the as-prepared catalysts. Fig. 5 illustrates the powder XRD diffraction patterns of the as-prepared Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts. All samples demonstrated characteristic peaks of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS #21-1272) at 25.1°, 37.6°, 47.9°, 53.8°, 54.9°, and 62.7° [10], [21]. A small peak assigned to MnO2 (JCPDS #24-0735) was observed at 28.4° [22], [23]. The addition of CeO2 to the Mn/TiO2 catalyst led to the appearance of new peaks at 28.5° and 32.9°, ascribed to the (111) and (200) planes of the cubic structure, respectively [24]. However, these peaks were not observed clearly for the co-impregnated catalyst. Particle size below 5 nm is difficult to be detected in XRD spectra because of XRD detection limitation, which means certain particle has really small size in catalyst.

In order to prove metal dispersion by another method, TEM-EDS technique has been applied in this paper, which clearly shows the location of each metal oxide. Fig. 6 shows the TEM-EDS elemental mapping images of Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts with different metal precursor impregnation sequences. Each element (Mn, Ti, O, and Ce) was observed along with the TEM results. For the Mn/TiO2 catalyst, Mn formed large particles on the catalyst surface. For the Mn/Ce/TiO2 and Ce/Mn/TiO2 catalyst, Mn demonstrated agglomerated particles in mapping images despite adding CeO2. However, large particles of Mn were not observed on the Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst. Furthermore, all four elements were located at the same position for the Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst, indicating that none of the elements were condensed during the preparation process. Contrary to expectations, Mn and Ce dispersion was only enhanced in the co-impregnated catalyst, implying that the metal dispersion was highly influenced by the catalyst preparation method.

The defect structures on metal oxides strongly influence Raman spectroscopy and can be observed from the peak shifting and/or broadening in Raman spectra [25], [26]. Moreover, the Raman spectra changes investigated in TiO2 support were associated with the oxygen stoichiometry of the materials and not to the internal stress or particle size [25], [26]. Thus, the variations in the defect structures on differently synthesized CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts were investigated. The Raman spectra of Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts are shown given in Fig. 7. All catalysts exhibited anatase TiO2 with five Raman-active modes at 147 cm−1 (Eg), 197 cm−1 (Eg), 395 cm−1 (E1g), 515 cm−1 (combination of A1g and B1g), and 637 cm−1 (Eg) [25], [26]. Among these samples, the Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst had improved intensity of the overall background spectrum compared to that of other catalysts due to the defect formation [26], which could be explained by the particle size of the doped metal oxide. The relatively small size of Mn and Ce in the Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst could easily distort the lattice structure of TiO2 by entering into lattice matrix and have a strong metal-support interaction [26], forming large lattice defect structures on the Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst [26]. Zeng et al. recently reported that lattice defect could improve the redox property and surface acidity, eventually enhances the NH3-SCR activity [27]. Furthermore, Yao et al., who studied a series of Ce/TiO2 for NH3-SCR reaction, insisted that a more defect formation in TiO2 could form stronger interaction between CeO2 and TiO2, and increasing the number of active sites [28]. Based on these literature, it is regarded that the defect formation would positively influence on Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst for NH3-SCR reaction. For manganese oxide, the Raman spectra were examined in the range of 450–700 cm−1 to focus on the possible multiphase of MnO2, which was confirmed by XRD analysis. The anatase TiO2 peaks at 515 and 637 cm−1 were asymmetrically developed, as given in inset of Fig. 7. The shoulder peaks observed at 531 and 653 cm−1 were attributed to the multiple phases (α-, β-, and γ-) of MnO2 species [22]. Thus, the Raman spectra confirmed that the defect formation in catalysts could be controlled by the preparation method. It also found that manganese oxide supported on TiO2 mainly existed in multiple phases of MnO2 species.

Reduction behavior and oxidation state
H2-TPR experiments were carried out to investigate the reduction behavior of Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts. Fig. 8 shows the H2-TPR profiles of Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts. For the Mn/TiO2 catalyst, the PI peak is attributed to MnO2 species and the reduction peak labeled as PII is correlated to Mn2O3 or bulk MnOx phase [28], [29], [30]. When CeO2 is added, the peak position of PI and PII is highly changed. Moreover, new peak marked as PIII is observed at around 430 °C, which is corresponded to the reduction of surface CeO2 [23], [28], [30]. For Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst, PI peak is shifted to 264 °C and have broad regime from 150 − 320 °C, compared to Mn/Ce/TiO2 and Ce/Mn/TiO2 catalysts, indicating that the more reducible oxygen species are existed in the Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst. In the case of PII peak in Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst, however, it moved to lower temperature than PII peak of Mn/TiO2 but appeared at higher temperature than PII peak of Mn/Ce/TiO2 and Ce/Mn/TiO2 catalysts. These results imply that catalyst redox property is significantly influenced by metal impregnation method and metal–metal and metal-support would have totally different interaction.

The surface electron state and atomic concentration of Mn, Ti, and O in the as-preapred catalysts were investigated by XPS analysis. A curve-fitting for this analysis was carried out after Shirly-type background subtraction using a combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. Fig. 9(A) presents the Mn 2p spectra for Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promtoed Mn/TiO2 catalysts. the XPS peaks of Mn 2p3/2 at 640.8, 641.8, and 643.2 eV can be attributed to Mn2+, Mn3+, and Mn4+, respectively [31], [32]. The XPS intensity of CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts were increased compared to that of Mn/TiO2 catalyst, and furthermore, peak ratio of Mn in CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts is highly changed by the metal impregnation method. The ratio of Mn3+ was calculated through peak fitting and using the areas under the fitted components and summarized in Table 3. The Mn3+ ratio over Mn-Ce/TiO2 was significantly higher than that over Mn/TiO2, Mn/Ce/TiO2, and Ce/Mn/TiO2 catalysts. The O 1 s spectra of the as-prepared catalysts are shown in Fig. 9(B). All catalysts exhibited two well-defined peaks in the O 1 s spectra located at around 529.6 and 531.3 eV. The peak at 529.6 eV was ascribed to the lattice oxygen (Oα), and the peak observed at 531.3 eV was attributed to chemisorbed oxygen (Oβ), such as O2−, O− and OH− [31], [33]. There is little binding energy shift by the metal impregnation method, while the change of Oβ concentration is noticeably observed in Table 3. Compared to Mn/TiO2 catalyst, Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst has a number of Oβ species which has superior oxidation activity, leading to high NO conversion. Fig. 9(C) depicts the Ti 2p spectra for the Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promtoed Mn/TiO2 catalysts. The XPS spectra of the core levels of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 for as-prepared catalysts are approximately 458.5 eV and 464.3 eV, respectively, corresponding to the reference data [33], [34]. The peaks of Ti 2p slightly shift to a lower binding energy with the addition of CeO2. This indicate that the surface electronic state of TiO2 is changed, depending on the metal impregnation sequence [33], [34]. This phenomenon is remarkably represented in Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst. It could be interpreted that free electron induced by defect formation have been produced in Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst. On the basis of the XPS results, the high ratio of Mn3+ over Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst might be attributed to the redox process of Oβ/Ototal and Ti3+/Ti4+, both of which could transfer electrons to Mn4+ [32].

NO adsorption study
Youn et al. and Liu et al. focused on the variations in NOx species because the catalyst activity and reaction mechanism could be differed by the adsorbed NOx species [35], [36]. Among the adsorbed NOx species, monodentate nitrate species were highlighted in their study because they were precarious on the catalyst surface and positively influenced the low-temperature NH3-SCR reaction [35], [36]. Thus, the FTIR analysis of Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts was performed to identify the chemical structure of the adsorbed NOx species, in particular monodentate nitrate species. Fig. 10 presents the IR spectra obtained for the NOx species adsorbed on the Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts. The IR bands at 1363, 1389, and 1414 cm−1 were attributed to monodentate nitrate species, while those at 1463 cm−1 corresponded to linear nitrate species [35], [36], [37]. The intensities of NOx species over CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts were higher than those over the Mn/TiO2 catalyst, indicating that nitrate species formed more on the CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalyst. In addition, monodentate nitrate species on CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts shifted to lower wavenumbers because of an increase in the π-donation in monodentate nitrate species and a lower Lewis acid strength of Mn species in the presence of CeO2 [38]. Pietrogiacomi et al. reported that in catalysts with weak Lewis acid strength, that is, with high electron density, the electron-donor capacity toward the reactant was higher, and the formation of surface complexes was easier [38]. Based on this literature, nitrate species can be easily produced on CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts, and this surface complex readily reacts with NH3 species to produce a more reactive intermediate such as Mn(n−1)+-O-NO[NH3] [35].

The NO-TPD analysis is performed to quantitatively elucidate the temperature-dependent desorption behavior, as shown in Fig. 11. For this NO-TPD profiles, NO desorption peaks could be divided into two sections. The peak below 200 ℃ was assigned to the decomposition of monodentate nitrate, and the peak above 200 ℃ is assigned to the bridged and bidentate types of nitrates that have high thermal stability [35], [39]. Primarily focusing on monodentate nitrate, considered essential for low-temperature NH3-SCR of NO, it was observed that the peak below 200 ℃ varied depending on the metal loading method. Remarkably, the sequentially impregnated catalyst had a relatively small amount of monodentate nitrate, while the co-impregnated catalyst formed abundant monodentate nitrate species as compared to the Mn/TiO2 catalyst. Thus, the results indicated that the co-impregnated catalyst had more NO adsorption sites than Mn/Ce/TiO2 and Ce/Mn/TiO2 catalysts. Moreover, NO mainly existed as monodentate nitrate species on Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalysts (Table 4).

Liu et al. studied density functional theory (DFT) calculation for NO adsorption on Mn-doped CeO2 surface [40]. They insisted that the oxygen vacancy would adsorb superoxo species (O2–), providing a number of adsorption site for NO [40]. In DFT calculation, NO molecules preferentially interacted with the O2– species located in lattice defect and formed nitrate species which will be reacted with NH3 species, leading to superior catalytic activity, while NO molecules are unfavorable to adsorb on oxygen vacancy without superoxo species [40]. This shows that defect formation is essential for NH3-SCR reaction, and it highly support our result.
NH3 adsorption and catalyst acidity study
Ammonia is a significant component that participated in the reaction of the present study. Thus, the NH3 adsorption and desorption study are essential for the low-temperature NH3-SCR of NO to explain the catalyst acidity [37], [41]. Yao et al. reported that many acid sites are beneficial for the adsorption and activation of NH3 molecules [21], [42]. Jin et al. suggested that NH3 species on the catalyst surface could further react with NO to produce N2 and H2O [43]. Thus, FTIR and NH3-TPD analyses were performed to observe the acidic strength and the type of surface acidity on CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts synthesized using sequential impregnation and co-impregnation methods. Fig. 12 shows the FTIR spectra of NH3 species adsorbed on Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts. The peaks at 1605 and 1205 cm−1 belonged to the NH3 adsorbed on Lewis acid sites, and those at 1489 and 1404 cm−1 were ascribed to the NH4+ ions in Brønsted acid sites [43], [44]. Although these four peaks were relatively well developed in the Mn/TiO2 catalyst, they decreased with the addition of the CeO2 on Mn/TiO2 catalyst. In particular, the peak related to the Lewis acid sites at 1605 cm−1 decreased on the CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalyst, suggesting that adding CeO2 suppressed the Lewis acid sites. This result indicated that the peak intensities ascribed to the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites differed on the Mn/Ce/TiO2, Mn-Ce/TiO2, and Ce/Mn/TiO2 catalysts. Furthermore, changing the impregnation method could easily control the catalyst acidity owing to the formation of different interactions between CeO2 and the Mn/TiO2 catalyst, depending on the metal loading method [17]. Fig. 1S shows the more detail in-situ FT-IR analysis of NH3 on Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts at different temperatures.

Fig. 13 shows the changes in the acidity, including the acidic strength and amount of acid sites in Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts, which is determined through NH3-TPD. The two peaks labeled as Pα and Pβ were observed in the temperature range of 100–400 °C for the Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts. TPD profile below 100 °C was closely related to physically adsorbed NH3. The Pα peak was attributed to weak acid sites, and the Pβ peak was ascribed to the intermediate strength acid sites [43]. According to the literature, the thermal stability of NH4+ ions attached to the Brønsted acid sites is weaker than that of the coordinated NH3 adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites, suggesting the detection of peaks associated to the Brønsted acid sites in the temperature range of 100–200 °C and that of the Lewis acid sites above 200 °C. Thus, the Pα peaks corresponding to NH4+ ions attached to the Brønsted acid sites, and the Pβ peaks belonged to the coordinated NH3 species on the Lewis acid sites. Furthermore, in the NH3-TPD profiles, the Pβ peaks changed drastically with the metal impregnation method, whereas the Pα peaks showed a small change. These results indicate that the CeO2 addition on Mn/TiO2 could change the Lewis acid sites more than the Brønsted acid sites. For quantitative analysis, the amount of NH3 species desorption is summarized in Table 4. The total amount of NH3 desorbed on the Mn/TiO2 catalyst was 0.683 mmolNH3·gcat−1, while that of the CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 was smaller than the Mn/TiO2 catalyst (Mn/Ce/TiO2 = 0.587 mmolNH3·gcat−1, Mn-Ce/TiO2 = 0.509 mmolNH3·gcat−1, and Ce/Mn/TiO2 = 0.591 mmolNH3·gcat−1). This change was mainly ascribed to the decrease in the Lewis acid sites (Table 4). Notably, the addition of CeO2 played a significant role in selectively decreasing the amount of Lewis acid sites on the Mn/TiO2 catalyst, and the decrease in the Lewis acid sites resulted in an increase in the Brønsted acid sites in the total amount of acid. It is well known that the Brønsted acid site is beneficial for catalyst performance in the low-temperature NH3-SCR of NO [19], [25], [31]. Thus, the Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst was expected to have higher activity in the NH3-SCR reactions.

Fig. 14 illustrates the relationship between the acidity distribution and catalytic performance of the as-prepared catalysts and presents the following three results: First, the total amount of catalyst acidity is decreased when CeO2 is added to the Mn/TiO2 catalyst regardless of the synthesis method. In particular, the Lewis acid site is selectively reduced, and not the Brønsted acid site. Second, the catalyst acidity could be controlled by changing the synthesis method although it contained the same metal composition. Mn-Ce/TiO2 synthesized by co-impregnation method has lesser Lewis sites than the catalyst having Mn and Ce sequentially impregnated onto TiO2. Third, the NO conversion was related to the ratio of the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites rather than the total number of acid sites, consistent with the currently reported studies [16], [21], [42]. The NO conversion remarkably increased with a decrease in the number of total acidic sites. The Mn-Ce/TiO2 catalyst having the lowest acidity exhibited the highest NO conversion because the ratio of Brønsted acid was strongly related to the reaction activity. Thus, increasing the ratio of Brønsted acid sites could be beneficial the catalyst performance for the low-temperature NH3-SCR of NO.

Conclusions
In this study, we investigated the surface properties in CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts with different impregnation sequences of Mn and Ce. The catalyst performance depends on simply changing the impregnation method of Mn and Ce in the catalyst activity test for a low-temperature SCR reaction. The co-impregnated catalyst, Mn-Ce/TiO2, achieved much higher NO conversion than other catalysts on increasing the reaction temperature. Furthermore, the XRD and TEM-EDS analyses revealed that metal dispersion improved in the co-impregnated catalyst compared to the sequentially impregnated catalysts. These well-distributed metal particles could produce defect formation on the catalyst, thereby serving more NOx adsorption sites. This result was also confirmed through Raman spectroscopy, XPS, FTIR, and NO-TPD analyses. Furthermore, depending on the metal impregnation method, the catalyst acidity distribution changed considerably and catalyst redox property is highly changed. These results imply that metal–metal and metal-support would have totally different interaction. Based on the results of NH3-TPD and FTIR analyses, the total amount of catalyst acidity decreased when CeO2 was added to the Mn/TiO2 catalyst, irrespective of the synthesis method. In particular, the Lewis acid site was selectively reduced. Furthermore, catalyst acidity could be controlled by changing synthesis method although it contained same metal composition.
