 Based on the analysis, this document is not directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation as it focuses on n-pentane catalytic cracking. The catalysts explored are Zr-ZSM-5, Ag-ZSM-5, and regenerated ZSM-5, which are tested for n-pentane cracking rather than propane dehydrogenation specifically. No propane dehydrogenation catalyst is identified. Therefore, the output is:
