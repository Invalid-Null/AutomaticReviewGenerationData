1. Introduction
Light olefins play a leading role in the petrochemical industry, and its derivatives are directly related to the development of plastics, rubber, textile, packaging materials, chemical machinery manufacturing, transportation, automobile manufacturing, building materials, etc., which make a huge difference on the social life [1], [2]. The rigid demand for light olefins continues to grow promoting the progress of the world petrochemical market. Production of light olefins has become a key symbol to measure the economic development. Traditionally, naphtha thermal cracking process is the main source for light olefins; however, it suffers from the high energy consumption and CO2 emission, the low light olefins yield and propylene/ethylene ratio, etc. Compared with thermal cracking, naphtha catalytic cracking process can make up the mentioned defects via the introduction of a high-efficiency catalyst [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Due to the unique structure and acidity, zeolites, especially ZSM-5, are promising to create a prospect for naphtha catalytic cracking process [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. In the past decades, several generations of scientists have devoted themselves to the related studies hoping to complete the theoretical system, achieve the well-design catalyst, and promote the progress in the chemical industry [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23].
Analysis and modulation of reaction pathways can provide guidelines for catalyst and process design to optimize light olefins technology. Huang et al. [24] found that in C3C7 olefins transformation over high-silicon HZSM-5, the main reaction pathways gradually changed from monomolecular cracking to bimolecular cracking, and further to trimolecular cracking with molecular chain length decreasing from C7= to C3=. Lin et al. [25], [26] found that tailoring reaction temperature and acid strength significantly influenced the reaction pathways in 1-butene/1-pentene transformation over HZSM-5 that high temperature and strong acidity benefited monomolecular cracking, while low temperature and weak acid sites preferred dimerization cracking. Epelde et al. [27] found that K-incorporation (1 wt%) tailored HZSM-5 acid properties, and increased the selectivity to propylene in 1-butene transformation. Li et al. [28] found that Fe-incorporation recovered partial B acid sites of P/HZSM-5 catalyst, and created some L acid sites, which significantly increased feedstock conversion and the selectivity to ethylene, while decreased the selectivity to propylene in the coupling cracking of butene and pentene. Miyaji et al. [29] found that in pentene catalytic cracking, when the specific spatial volume of zeolite was close to the volume of pentyl cations, it benefited monomolecular cracking and selectively promoted the formation of ethylene and propylene; while, a wider spatial volume enhanced dimerization cracking, and led to the formation of butenes and hexanes. Bortnovsky et al. [30] found that compared to ferrierite, mordenite, ZSM-12, beta, etc., ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 exhibited a high and stable selectivity to light olefins in pentene catalytic cracking, and it can be attributed to their 10-MRP intersecting channels, which benefited the formation of oligomeric intermediates and simultaneously suppressed the formation of coke-like species.
The reaction network for alkanes catalytic cracking was different from that of alkenes, especially the bimolecular cracking route. In alkanes catalytic cracking, bimolecular cracking involved hydride transfer between reactant molecules and carbenium ions, and β-scission of the generated carbenium ions [21], [31]. Lukyanov et al. [32] found that hydride transfer reactions played an important role in n-hexane cracking over HZSM-5 below 400 °C. Wielers et al. [33] defined the “cracking mechanism ratio (CMR)” to express the relative contributions of monomolecular and bimolecular cracking mechanisms in n-hexane catalytic cracking, and found that zeolites pore structure remarkably tailored the relative contributions of the two cracking mechanisms, e.g. decreasing zeolite pore dimensions suppressed bimolecular cracking. Corma et al. [34] proposed the “paraffin/olefin ratio (P/O)” to evaluate the contribution of hydride transfer in n-heptane catalytic cracking, and found that decreasing zeolite pore dimensions suppressed hydride transfer reactions. Wang et al. [35] found that reducing acid sites within the supercages of MCM-22 suppressed hydride transfer reactions and coke formation, and thus, promoted the selectivity to propylene and achieved a proximate stability comparable to HZSM-5. Williams et al. [36] found that compared to H-Y, the high activity of H-USY can be attributed to the enhancement of hydride transfer reaction; while, it also introduced the oligomeric cracking mechanism into the reaction network, accelerating coke formation and catalyst deactivation. It was found that Zr-incorporation over HZSM-5 can enhance hydride transfer reactions in n-pentane catalytic cracking [37], and promote light olefins yield in naphtha catalytic cracking [38]. Wang et al. [39] modified HZSM-5 with rare earth (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu or Gd) impregnation, and found that it greatly promoted the selectivity to light olefins, especially to propylene in butane catalytic cracking. Ce-incorporation gave the highest yield of total light olefins, and Nd-incorporation gave the highest yield of propylene at 600 °C. Lu et al. [40] found that a tiny Fe-loading over HZSM-5 greatly improved both the catalytic activity and the selectivity to light olefins, which was probably attributed to the acidic modification of catalyst or enhancement of dehydrogenation route caused by Fe-incorporation. Hu et al. [41] found that the introduction of V2O5/Al2O3 into the equilibrium ZSM-5 catalyst offered another reaction pathway for n-heptane conversion, and significantly improved the initial reaction rate and the selectivity to light olefins. Qiu et al. [42] pointed out that Ag sites generated by Ag-incorporation over HZSM-5 can initiate dehydrogenation cracking for n-dodecane conversion promoting CH bond breaking. Thus, Ag-ZSM-5 catalysts greatly enhanced the dehydrogenation rate and the selectivity to light olefins in alkanes catalytic cracking [37], [43].
It has been emphasized that in naphtha catalytic cracking, a certain portion of feedstock was inevitably converted into coke species, blocking zeolite pore openings and resulting in catalyst deactivation [44], [45], [46]. Usually, the spent catalysts have to go through the high-temperature treatment in air/oxygen flow promoting coke combustion and recovering catalytic activity [47]. Nakasaka et al. [48] pointed out that coke combustion led to the steep jump of temperature that remarkably affected the structure and acidity of zeolites. Al-majnouni et al. [49] found that the high-temperature treatment generated redox sites over HZSM-5, which can activate propane by the redox mechanism, and promoted CH bonds breaking. Yun et al. [50] found that the high-temperature treated SSZ-13 selectively enhanced propane dehydrogenation, and proposed the redox cracking mechanism to explain the role of redox sites in propane conversion. It can be deduced that redox cracking initiated by the redox sites promoted the selectivity to hydrogen and alkenes in alkanes conversion [51].
Generally, modification of zeolites, e.g. element incorporation, high-temperature treatment, etc., can modulate the reaction pathways for alkanes catalytic cracking, and the probable roles can be described as followings: (1) Zr-incorporation over HZSM-5 enhanced the hydride transfer reactions between carbenium ions and reactant molecules, (2) Ag sites generated by Ag-incorporation initiated dehydrogenation cracking and promoted CH bond breaking, (3) redox sites generated by the high-temperature treatment initiated redox cracking and promoted CH bond breaking. In this paper, influences of reaction pathways modulation on alkanes catalytic cracking to produce light olefins were investigated using n-pentane as a model reactant. Zr-ZSM-5, Ag-ZSM-5, and the high temperature regenerated HZSM-5 were prepared and employed in n-pentane catalytic cracking. A particular attention has been paid to the measurement of catalytic activity and stability, as well as the product distribution, especially light olefins; meanwhile, element balance analysis and deactivation rate were also defined and calculated according to the experiment results. Finally, a straightforward scheme was proposed to express the potential relationship among catalysts, reaction pathways, and catalytic performance.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Reactant and catalysts
Reactants: n-Pentane (>99 wt%), Zr(NO3)4 (>98 wt%), and AgNO3 (>98 wt%) were purchased from Huadong Reagent Company (Tianjin, China), and used without further purification.
Parent HZSM-5: The commercial HZSM-5 with a Si/Al2 ratio of 25 and an average particle size of 1 μm was purchased from Nankai University Catalyst Plant (Tianjin, China). It has been calcinated in the dry air at 550 °C for 6 h, and denoted as P-Z5.
Zr-ZSM-5 and Ag-ZSM-5: The metal-incorporated ZSM-5 catalysts were obtained by impregnating P-Z5 with Zr(NO3)4 and AgNO3 aqueous solutions (0.1 mol L−1), respectively. As a typical run, the parent HZSM-5 (2 g) powder was suspended in Zr(NO3)4 and AgNO3 aqueous solutions (40 mL, 0.1 mol L−1), respectively. Stirring speed was 600 rpm and maintained at room temperature for 0.5 h. And then, the samples were collected, dried at 120 °C for 4 h, and calcinated in the dry air at 550 °C for 4 h. The obtained metal-incorporated ZSM-5 catalysts were denoted as Zr-Z5 and Ag-Z5, respectively.
ZSM-5(R2): After the test run, the spent HZSM-5 went through the regeneration treatment that was carried out at 550 °C under air flow for 4 h promoting coke combustion. ZSM-5(R2) referred to the parent HZSM-5 that has experienced the test/regeneration process twice, and was denoted as Z5(R2).
2.2. Characterization
XRF (X-ray Fluorescence) spectrum was recorded by on a Bruker S4/Pioneer to determine the real percentage of Zr and Ag loading on ZSM-5 zeolites. XRD (X-ray diffraction) patterns were recorded with a Rigaku instrument in the range of 5–50° with a scan rate of 5° min−1. TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) images were obtained on a Tecnai G2F-20 transmission electron microscope with a field-emission gun operating at 200 kV. NH3-TPD (Ammonia Temperature Programmed Desorption) profiles were measured on a Micromeritics 2910 (TPD/TPR) instrument. Sample (ca. 100 mg) was charged in a quartz tubular reactor, and pretreated at 550 °C under Ar flow for 1 h, and then cooled to 50 °C. Ammonia (20% NH3 in He) with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 was introduced at 50 °C for 0.5 h. Then, He stream was fed in until a constant TCD signal obtained, and the physisorbed ammonia was removed by flowing He at 100 °C for 1 h. The chemically adsorbed ammonia was determined by raising temperature up to 650 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Py-IR (Pyridine Adsorbed Infrared) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 710 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The powder sample (ca. 10 mg) was pressed into a self-supported wafer, and treated directly in an in situ IR cell connected to a vacuum apparatus that allowed to obtain a residual pressure below 10−3 Pa. Adsorption of pyridine proceeded at 60 °C, followed by desorption at 200 and 350 °C. IR spectra were recorded with a resolution of 4 cm−1 by collecting 32 scans for a single spectrum. XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectra) was conducted on a PHI-5000 Versaprobe II X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with C as the internal standard (C1s = 284.7 eV). 27Al solid-state MAS NMR spectra were collected on a Varian Infinity plus 300 MHz spectrometer at room temperature with a spin rate of 1.0 kHz, a frequency of 100.6 MHz, a pulse width of 4 us, and a recycle delay of 1.0 s.
2.3. n-Pentane catalytic cracking
Experiment apparatus and procedure employed in this work have been presented by the previous paper [37]. Reaction conditions were as follows: catalysts, 200 mg; SiC,1 g; n-pentane,1.2 mL h−1; N2, 200 sccm; n-pentane partial pressure (Ppar), 2 kPa; weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), 3.7 h−1. Firstly, n-pentane catalytic cracking was conducted at 400–550 °C to characterize the activity of ZSM-5 based catalysts, and the data point was collected after 10 min when it reached the set temperature. Then, feedstock stream was maintained for 12 h at 550 °C to evaluate the stability of the targeted catalysts. Finally, after each test run, the high-temperature regeneration was carried out at 550 °C under air flow for 4 h promoting coke combustion.
n-Pentane conversion (X), and the mass selectivity (Si) and yield (Yi) of species i are defined as follows:
(1)
(2)
(3)
where Wi is the molecular weight of species i and (i) is the corresponding mole fraction in product. (n-C5) is the mole fraction of n-pentane in product. Thus, in Eq. (1), the numerator represents the mass sum of the products, and denominator represents the mass sum of the products and the remnant n-pentane.
2.4. Turnover frequency
For n-pentane catalytic cracking over ZSM-5 based catalysts, the turnover frequency (TOF) per B acid site can be determined by Eq. (4):
(4)
where X, WHSV and CBAS refer to n-pentane conversion, weight hourly space velocity and the concentration of B acid sites, respectively.
2.5. Mass balance analysis
During n-pentane catalytic cracking, the products heavier than C5 may be generated on the traceable level. Two atom ratios, i.e. H/C (Eq. (5)) and N/C (Eq. (6)), were defined and calculated to analyze the mass balance, and the theoretical values of feedstock were 2.4 (H/C) and 18.8 (N/C), respectively.
(5)
(6)
where (i) is the corresponding mole fraction of species i, and (N2) is the mole fraction of N2 in product. Letter “m” and “n” refer to the number of hydrogen and carbon atom in species i, respectively.
2.6. Deactivation rate
To further reveal and compare the catalytic stability of ZSM-5 based catalysts, the deactivation rate (Rd) was defined as Eq. (7):
(7)
where X0 and Xt represented n-pentane conversion at TOS = 0.1 and t h.
2.7. Blank experiments
Blank experiments in an empty reactor and a reactor with diluents (SiC, 1 g) were carried out under the similar reaction conditions: n-pentane, 1.2 mL h−1; N2, 200 sccm; partial pressure, 2 kPa; temperature, 400–550 °C. Experiment results indicated that n-pentane can hardly cracking without ZSM-5 based catalysts.
3. Results
3.1. Structure and acidity of Zr-Z5, Ag-Z5, and Z5(R2)
The real percentage of Zr and Ag loading on Zr-ZSM-5 and Ag-ZSM-5 was detected by XRF spectra, and it was close to 0.4 wt% and 0.6 wt%, respectively. The diffraction peaks of ZSM-5 based catalysts were recorded and compared with those reported in the Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standards (00-044-0002) data base files. As shown in Fig. 1, Zr-Z5, Ag-Z5, and Z5(R2) exhibited the characteristic diffraction peaks of MFI structure at 2θ = 7–9, 22–25° as that of P-Z5. The relative crystallinity (RC) was calculated based on several key reflections (2θ = 7–9, 22–25°) and shown in Table 1. The RC value of Zr-Z5, Ag-Z5, and Z5(R2) decreased by 2%, 6%, and 11% compared to that of P-Z5, respectively. The decreased RC value can be attributed to the defects in crystallographic structure of ZSM-5 caused by Zr-incorporation, Ag-incorporation, and high temperature regeneration. The high-temperature regeneration remarkably corrupted the textural properties of ZSM-5 crystallite. TEM technology was used to observe the morphology of Zr-Z5, Ag-Z5, and Z5(R2). As shown in Fig. 2, Ag-incorporation led to the formation of silver particles (ca. 3 nm) on Ag-Z5, while there was no visible particle on Zr-Z5 in the nanoscale, and the high-temperature regeneration led to no visible effects on the microscopic crystal morphology. Furthermore, acidity of ZSM-5 based catalysts was detected by NH3-TPD and Py-IR measurements. NH3-TPD curves have been shown in Fig. 3, and two desorption peaks centered at ∼220 °C and ∼450 °C were observed, which corresponded to ammonia desorption from weak and strong acid sites, respectively. Compared with P-Z5, Zr-incorporation, Ag-incorporation, and the high-temperature regeneration decreased the acid sites; at the same time, the former little decreased, while the latter two increased the strong/weak ratio (S/W). Types (B and L) of acid sites have been defined and determined by Py-IR measurement. Zr-incorporation, Ag-incorporation, and the high-temperature regeneration have significantly reduced both BT/LT and BS/LS ratios compared to that of P-Z5, indicating the decrease of B acid sites.

Acid density was calculated by combining the NH3-TPD and Py-IR results, and summarized in Table 1. Zr-Z5, Ag-Z5, and Z5(R2) gave a lower concentration of B acid sites and a higher concentration of L acid sites compared with P-Z5. Acid distribution over Zr-Z5 was similar to that over P-Z5; the decrease of B acid sites and the increase of L acid sites were close to 8% and 15%, respectively; influences caused by Zr-incorporation on strong and weak acid sites were approximately equal. Ag-incorporation led to a decrease of 65% for B acid sites and an increase of 288% for L acid sites; the weak B acid sites over Ag-Z5 completely disappeared; the strong L acid sites were almost fourfold compared to that of P-Z5. In comparison with P-Z5, B acid sites of Z5(R2) decreased by 46% and L acid sites increased by 147%; increase of L acid sites was mainly due to strong acid sites that increased by 273%. It can be concluded that Zr-incorporation, Ag-incorporation, and the high-temperature regeneration significantly tailored the acid properties, including the acid strength, acid types, and acid distribution, and this may be attributed to the defects in crystallographic structure of ZSM-5 caused by Zr-incorporation, Ag-incorporation, and the high-temperature regeneration.
The existence states of Zr, Ag, and Al species were illustrated by XPS and NMR measurement (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4a, two existence states of Zr species can be differentiated via deconvolution of Zr3d5/2 profiles. The binding energies were 182.5 eV and 183.4 eV, belonging to Zr-O and Zr-O-Si, respectively [52], [53]. The appearance of ZrOSi indicated that Zr atom can interact with or enter into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites. As shown in Fig. 4b, five existence states of Ag species can be differentiated via deconvolution of Ag3d5/2 profiles. The binding energies were 367.1 eV, 367.6 eV, 368.2 eV, 368.9 eV, and 369.4 eV, belonging to AgO, Ag2O, Agn0, Ag+, and Agnd+, respectively [42]. Different from AgO, Ag2O, and Agn0, the Ag+ and Agnd+ species in these samples tend to adsorb onto or enter into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites. 27Al MAS NMR spectra shown in Fig. 4c depicted the local structure of Al species in P-Z5 and Z5(R2). The different resonances at 55.4 ppm and 0 ppm are normally assigned to the framework Al in tetrahedral coordination and the extra-framework Al in octahedral coordination, respectively [54], [55], [56]. It was figured out that the 0 ppm peak was more intensive on Z5(R2) compared to that of P-Z5, indicating that high temperature regeneration can force Al atoms dropping off the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites and forming the extra-framework Al sites.

Zeolites usually possess orderly distributed and three-dimensionally extended framework topologies, which is built exclusively from TO4 tetrahedra (T denotes tetrahedrally coordinated Si, Al, or P, etc.). The TO4 tetrahedra are connected in different ways, which leads to the rich variety of zeolite structures and acidity [15]. For example, ZSM-5 zeolites are characterized by tetrahedra of alumina (AlO4) and silica (SiO4), possessing the MFI topology and the abundant B acid sites (SiOHAl) [57]. It can be deduced that the variation of TO4 tetrahedra would make a difference on the MFI topology, crystallinity, as well as acidity. As conformed by XPS and NMR measurement, Zr-incorporation, Ag-incorporation, and high temperature regeneration have altered the components of the framework, i.e. the TO4 tetrahedra of ZSM-5 zeolites, to some extent. Zr- and Ag-incorporation forced Zr atoms and Ag atoms entering into, while high temperature regeneration forced Al atoms dropping off the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites. As a result, the relative crystallinity and acidity of Zr-ZSM-5, Ag-ZSM-5, and ZSM-5(R2) was lower than that of the parent HZSM-5. The extra-framework Zr, Ag, and Al can generate acid sites, usually L acid sites, which led to the increase of L acid sites over the modified ZSM-5 zeolites compared to that of the parent HZSM-5.
3.2. Catalytic activity of Zr-Z5, Ag-Z5, and Z5(R2)
n-Pentane catalytic cracking under atmosphere pressure was taken as a model reaction to evaluate the catalytic activity of Zr-Z5, Ag-Z5, and Z5(R2). Fig. 5 showed n-pentane conversion, TOF value, light olefins yield, and light olefins selectivity, and all of them increased with the elevated temperature from 400 °C to 550 °C, indicating that an increase of reaction temperature was beneficial to achieve a higher catalytic activity and light olefins production. As shown in Fig. 5a, conversions of n-pentane cracking over Zr-Z5 and Z5(R2) were higher than those over P-Z5. Zr-Z5 and Z5(R2) achieved an n-pentane conversion of 36.5% and 40.1% at 500 °C, which was 65% and 83% higher than that of P-Z5 (22.1%), respectively. Ag-Z5 also achieved a higher n-pentane conversion than that of P-Z5 at 400–500 °C; while, when the temperature came to 550 °C, conversion of P-Z5 was comparable to or even a little higher that of Ag-Z5. As shown in Fig. 5b, TOF values of Zr-Z5, Ag-Z5, and Z5(R2) at 500 °C were almost double, fivefold, and triple that of P-Z5, indicating that Zr-incorporation, Ag-incorporation and the high-temperature regeneration significantly promoted the utilization of B acid sites. Promotion of Zr-incorporation on the utilization of B acid sites was probably attributed to its specific role in enhancing the interaction between the reactant molecules with B acid sites or carbenium ions via dispersion forces, while that of Ag-incorporation and high-temperature regeneration was probably due to the enhanced formation of alkenes, which was easily protonated by B acid sites and accelerated the conversion of alkanes.

As shown in Fig. 5c, Zr-Z5, Ag-Z5, and Z5(R2) gave a higher light olefins yield than that of P-Z5. Light olefins yield obtained over Zr-Z5, Ag-Z5, and Z5(R2) at 500 °C was 19.0%, 21.7%, and 25.6%, which was 58%, 81%, and 113% higher than that of P-Z5 (12.0%), respectively. As shown in Fig. 5d, selectivity to light olefins over Ag-Z5 and Z5(R2) were a little higher than those over P-Z5. Zr-Z5 exhibited a lower selectivity to light olefins at 400–500 °C than that of P-Z5; while, when the temperature came to 550 °C, the negative effect of Zr-Z5 on light olefins selectivity was unremarkable. Z5(R2) achieved the highest light olefins yield, which can be attributed to the fine activity (Fig. 5a) and selectivity (Fig. 5d). The redox sites generated by high temperature regeneration initiated the redox cracking and promoted the formation of alkanes that was easily protonated by B acid sites and accelerated the protolytic cracking of n-pentane (Fig. 5b). Compared with Ag-Z5 who can also selectively promote alkenes formation by dehydrogenation cracking over Ag sites, Z5(R2) reserved more B acid sites, which was crucial to n-pentane conversion. Different from Ag-Z5 and Z5(R2), Zr-Z5 improved n-pentane catalytic cracking by enhancing the interaction of the reactant molecules with B acid sites or carbenium ions. Even though Zr-Z5 reserved most B acid sites, it did not exhibit any superiority in light olefins production in comparison to Z5(R2) (Fig. 5c). It seems reasonable that the enhancement of physical force was not as efficient as that of chemical action in promoting alkanes conversion. In addition, the noticeable drop of light olefins yield over Ag-Z5 was probably caused by the rapid deactivation at 550 °C.
3.3. Catalytic stability of Zr-Z5, Ag-Z5, and Z5(R2)
Fig. 6 showed conversion and light olefins yield in n-pentane cracking over ZSM-5 based catalysts at 550 °C as a function of time on stream. As shown in Fig. 6a, n-pentane conversion gradually decreased from 72.5% to 53.2% on Zr-Z5, and from 61.7% to 46.2% on P-Z5 with the prolonged time on stream, indicating that Zr-incorporation led to a stable promotion on catalytic activity. In comparison with P-Z5, Ag-Z5 and Z5(R2) remarkably reduced n-pentane conversion after 12 h on stream. As shown in Fig. 6b, the gradual decrease of light olefins yield over ZSM-5 based catalysts was evidenced with time on stream. In comparison with P-Z5, Zr-Z5 maintained a higher yield of light olefins; while, Ag-Z5 and Z5(R2) first increased and then decreased light olefins yield for 12 h on stream.

Deactivation rate (Rd) has been calculated based on the results of stability tests and presented in Fig. 7 as a function of time on stream. P-Z5 and Zr-Z5 possessed the proximate Rd values, and they were remarkably lower than those of Ag-Z5 and Z5(R2), which went through a rapid increase at the starting stage. One-hour Rd value of P-Z5, Zr-Z5, Ag-Z5 and Z5(R2) in n-pentane catalytic cracking at 550 °C was 0.6%, 0.1%, 17.8%, and 8.8%, and increased to 25.0%, 26.6%, 46.8%, and 51.6% after 12 h on stream, respectively. 12 h Rd value of Ag-Z5 and Z5(R2) was almost twice that of P-Z5 and Zr-Z5.

Mass balance analysis provided the information about the undetectable products, and helped to explain the results of stability tests. H/C and N/C atom ratios for n-pentane cracking over ZSM-5 based catalysts at 550 °C were calculated and presented as a function of time on stream in Fig. 8. H/C and N/C values of P-Z5 and Zr-Z5 held the proximate level, and were approximately equal to the theoretical values, indicating that the undetectable products were produced in a small portion. While, H/C and N/C atom ratios obtained over Ag-Z5 and Z5(R2) were remarkably higher at the starting stage, and then decreased and got close to the theoretical values, indicating the loss of carbon atoms and the formation of undetectable hydrocarbons, such as aromatics, or even coke species. Catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation may be the reason to explain the rapid decease of n-pentane conversion and light olefins yield observed in Fig. 6.

3.4. Product distribution over Zr-Z5, Ag-Z5, and Z5(R2)
Fig. 9 showed the changes of product distribution in n-pentane catalytic cracking over ZSM-5 based catalysts at 550 °C. For P-Z5, the main products were propylene (>35 wt%), ethylene (>20 wt%), butylenes (>10 wt%), ethane (>10 wt%), and propane (>7 wt%); selectivity to propylene and butylenes remarkably increased, and that to ethane almost held the same, while that to ethylene and propane decreased with the declining n-pentane conversion. Hydrogen, methane, and butane took up a small fraction in the cracked products, approximating to 2 wt%, and responded negatively to the reduction of n-pentane conversion. Compared with P-Z5, Zr-Z5 increased the selectivity to ethane and propane, decreased the selectivity to hydrogen, methane, and propylene, and hardly affected the selectivity to ethylene, butanes, and butylenes; Ag-Z5 promoted the selectivity to hydrogen and ethylene, while reduced the selectivity to methane, ethane, propane, propylene, butane, and butylenes at high n-pentane conversions; Z5(R2) increased the selectivity to hydrogen, ethylene, and propylene, while decreased the selectivity to methane, ethane, propane, butane, and butylenes.

4. Discussion
Generally, it is accepted that B acid sites are the active sites for alkanes catalytic cracking over H-zeolites, and it follows a chain reaction that involves three elementary steps: (1) initiation step, monomolecular protolytic racking between the reactant alkane molecular and B acid sites; (2) propagation step, hydride transfer reactions between the reactant alkane molecular and the generated carbenium ions; (3) termination step, deprotonation of carbenium ions [31], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62].
Modulation of reaction pathways for alkanes catalytic cracking over ZSM-5 based catalysts has been summarized in Scheme 1, which involved the traditional protolytic cracking at B acid sites, and the new introduced dehydrogenation cracking at Ag sites, and redox cracking at redox sites.

Scheme 1. Roles of reaction pathways modulation in alkanes catalytic cracking.
4.1. Roles of hydride transfer
In alkanes protolytic cracking, alkanes are first activated by B acid sites forming carbonium ion transition states, which undergo CC/CH bond breaking and generate carbenium ions (Pathway I) [21], [31], [33], [63]. The generated carbenium ions intermediates react with feed alkanes through bimolecular hydride transfer producing shorter alkanes, and the derived feed carbenium ions are transformed into smaller carbenium ions and alkenes via beta-scission (Pathway V) [64], [65]. At the same time, carbenium ions go through some side reactions such as oligomerization, isomerization, cyclization, aromatization, etc., enhancing the further-conversion of products (Pathway VI) [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73]. Finally, deprotonation of carbenium ions forms alkenes whilst restores B acid sites via back donation of a proton to zeolites (Pathway VI).
Promotion of Zr-incorporation on n-pentane catalytic cracking over ZSM-5 was probably attributed to its specific role in enhancing the interaction of the reactant molecules with B acid sites or carbenium ions via dispersion forces. The product distribution for n-pentane catalytic cracking suggested that Zr-incorporated ZSM-5 increased the selectivity to propane and butane. In the previous paper [37], influences of Sr-, Zr-, and La-incorporation on the reaction pathways in n-pentane catalytic cracking have been investigated and compared, and it was found that Zr-incorporation remarkably enhanced hydride transfer reactions (Pathway V). Thus, it was deduced that Zr-incorporation enhancd the interaction of the reactant molecules with B acid sites or carbenium ions via dispersion forces, promoting the catalytic activity and thus yield of light olefins.
Although a higher conversion and light olefins yield may accelerate the side reactions, enhancement of hydride transfer reactions facilitated the transformation of carbenium ions into paraffin molecules, and probably retarded the side reactions to coke formation. Therefore, the promotion of Zr-ZSM-5 on light olefins production was accompanied with a catalytic stability that was comparable to the parent HZSM-5. Enhancement of hydride transfer reactions increased the selectivity to specific products, i.e. ethane and propane; while, weakened the relative contribution of monomolecular protolytic cracking, decreasing the selectivity to hydrogen, methane, and propylene. One of the major routes to ethylene and C4 products was the side reactions, which was hardly affected by enhancing hydride transfer reactions, and thus, their selectivity almost held the same over Zr-ZSM-5.
4.2. Roles of dehydrogenation cracking and redox cracking
Ag sites created by Ag-incorporation and redox sites created by high temperature regeneration play a crucial role in n-pentane activation, and it is different from B acid sites [37], [42], [43]. Ag sites interact with hydrogen atoms of alkanes, enhance the dissociation of CH bond, and promote the formation of hydrogen and olefins (Pathway II) [42], [43]. Redox cracking initiated by redox sites exhibited a lower activation energy for CH/CC bond breaking compared with that of protolytic cracking [49]; moreover, the cleavage of CH bonds was significantly enhanced by redox cracking compared to that of CC bonds (Pathway III) [49], [50].
It can be concluded that the feature of both Ag-incorporation and high temperature regeneration was the significant enhancement of CH bond breaking and alkenes formation [37], [42], [74]. According to carbenium ions mechanism, alkenes can be directly and easily protonated by B acid sites with much lower activation energy in comparison with alkanes [20]. Williams et al. have explicitly tested the role of alkenes addition in alkanes conversion: first, a low conversion of hexane was observed; then, feed was switching to the mixtures of 1-hexene and n-hexane at the same conditions, and immediately, hexane conversion increased dramatically [75]. They concluded that alkenes addition can accelerate the rate of alkane conversion. It was reasonable to address that Ag-incorporation and high temperature regeneration significantly enhanced alkenes formation, which was easily protonated by B acid sites and accelerated alkanes conversion.
In n-pentane catalytic cracking over Ag-ZSM-5 and ZSM-5(R2), alkenes generated by dehydrogenation cracking and redox cracking were easily protonated and accelerated n-pentane protolytic cracking over B acid sites (Pathway IV), and thus improved the catalytic activity [21]. Different from Zr-ZSM-5 that enhanced the interaction between the reactant molecules with B acid sites or carbenium ions, Ag-ZSM-5 and ZSM-5(R2) introduced new routes to n-pentane cracking, which was much more efficient to promote the utilization of B acid sites. Therefore, even though Ag-ZSM-5 and ZSM-5(R2) reserved less B acid sites, they still exhibited the superiority in light olefins yield in comparison to Zr-ZSM-5.
However, both Ag-ZSM-5 and ZSM-5(R2) went through a rapid deactivation in n-pentane catalytic cracking at 550 °C. Catalyst deactivation was mainly due to the formation of coke. It has been pointed out that in the catalytic cracking of alkanes, coke species can be formed from the alkenes produced in the cracking reactions via a sequence of reaction steps, i.e. protonation, alkylation, isomerisation, oligomerization, cyclization, aromatization, dehydrogenation, etc., which led to the deposition of large polyaromatic molecules on catalysts [8], [45], [46], [66], [76], [77]. Chen and Manos [78] found that coke can be directly formed via oligomerization of 1-hexene reactant and coke species generated in 1-hexene cracking was far more than that of n-hexane at each reaction temperature. Thus, the selective enhancement of light olefins over Ag-ZSM-5 and ZSM-5(R2) promoted the side reactions to coke formation and accelerated catalyst deactivation.
5. Conclusions
In this paper, Zr-ZSM-5, Ag-ZSM-5, and ZSM-5(R2) were prepared to explore influences of reaction pathways modulation on n-pentane catalytic cracking, and it was found that light olefins yield obtained over Zr-ZSM-5, Ag-ZSM-5, and the regenerated HZSM-5 at 500 °C was 58%, 81%, and 113% higher than that over the parent HZSM-5 (12.0%), respectively. The promotion on light olefins production caused by Zr-incorporation can be attributed to the enhancement of the interaction between the reactant molecules with B acid sites or carbenium ions, which increased the utilization of B acid sites and the catalytic activity accompanied with a proximate stability compared to the parent HZSM-5. Dehydrogenation cracking over Ag sites and redox cracking over redox sites selectively promoted cleavage of CH bond and the formation of light olefins, which was easily protonated by B acid sites and enhanced n-pentane protolytic cracking, while accelerated the side reactions to coke formation and resulted in a rapid catalyst deactivation.
Although enhancing hydride transfer reactions led to a higher conversion accompanied with the proximate stability, it reduced the selectivity to light olefins compared to the parent HZSM-5. Dehydrogenation cracking and redox cracking selectively promoted light olefins formation accelerating n-pentane cracking; however, enhanced some side reactions resulting in a rapid coke formation and catalyst deactivation. By now, it seems hard to simultaneously improve catalytic activity, catalytic stability, and light olefins selectivity in alkanes cracking over zeolite catalysts. Further studies would focus on how to achieve the high and stable light olefins production over ZSM-5 based catalysts, which was vital to naphtha catalytic cracking process.
