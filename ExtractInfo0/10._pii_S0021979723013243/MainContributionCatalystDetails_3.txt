 Unfortunately the document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst described is focused on total oxidation of propane to CO2 and water, rather than partial dehydrogenation to propylene. No propylene yield, propane dehydrogenation, or oxidative propane dehydrogenation processes are mentioned.
