 Unfortunately the given document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation as it focuses on the total oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide and water rather than the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The document discusses oxidation catalysts and mechanisms for complete combustion of propane, which is different from PDH and ODH processes that aim to produce propylene.
