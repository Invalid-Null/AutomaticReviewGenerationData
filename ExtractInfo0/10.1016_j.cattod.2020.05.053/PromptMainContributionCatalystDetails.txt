1. Introduction
Propane dehydrogenation is a vital reaction to produce valuable olefin products, especially propylene, which is an essential intermediate for many chemical industries. For this reaction, the catalyst shows an important role to proceed the reaction, hence the catalytic for propane dehydrogenation has been extensively studied in a recent decade. Pt and CrOx-based catalysts have been well-known as the catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, and it regularly uses to be a standard catalyst in a propylene production industry [1]. However, due to the toxicity of CrOx-based catalyst and the environmental issue, the Pt is quite more favorable in the research and development field. To increase the efficiency of Pt in the catalytic reaction, introduction of Pt into support is necessary. Due to the availability and low cost, silica and alumina are common supports for catalysts production; nevertheless, there is evidence informing that
-Al2O3 is a proper support for PtSn catalyst comparing with SiO2 [2]. Therefore,
-Al2O3 is standard support for Pt-based catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation process for many decades. However, at present the UOP group choose θ-Al2O3 support for the industrial process [3] because it has lower Bronsted acid sites relative to γ- Al2O3 consequence to less of side reaction, while it still gives the excellent of Pt dispersion although it tends to have lower surface area than
-Al2O3 [1]. Besides, many researchers have attempt to improve the stability of the Pt-based catalyst, which is the leading problem caused by coke formation. In a general way, the promoters, as alkali metals like Na, Li, and K, were added to the catalyst to suppress the acid sites, which was one cause of coke formation [[4], [5], [6], [7]]. While the addition of other promoters such as Cu, Sn, Ga, and In can improve the electronic and geometric effect of Pt-based catalysts, so coke formation was also reduced [[8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]. Furthermore, there was some evidence showing that Sn can also promote the migration of coke precursors to the support of the catalyst leading to the decreasing amount of deactivated active sites covering by coke [13,14]. Due to the unique effect of Sn and the best performance of K modified on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst when comparing with other alkaline metals like Na and Li [15,16], K-PtSn/Al2O3 is the conventional catalyst, which is broadly used in propane dehydrogenation industry.
However, it is recently found that only tin on silica support can also activate propane dehydrogenation not only as a promoter, but it shows outstanding stability for 20 h with a considerable constant conversion when compared with two commercial catalysts, K-PtSn/Al2O3, and K-Cr/Al2O3 [[17], [18], [19]]. Hence, It was interesting to know that what the properties on SnOx/SiO2 that consequent to outstanding stability are and how differences in the side reaction pathways of this catalyst from the conventional catalyst such as K-PtSn/Al2O3 can be elucidated. For the investigation, insight of tin oxide on silica support is necessary. The various researches studied involving the catalytic properties of tin oxide on silica, and this catalyst was also applied to many reactions such as Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) reduction, sugar isomerization and epimerization, Baeyer–Villiger oxidation, phenol hydroxylation, Aldol condensation, and Mukaiyama reaction [20]. In general, mixed tin oxide-silica is the Lewis acid catalyst [20,21], and its acidity may bring to the activation of propane dehydrogenation. Nevertheless, the researchers found that the acidity of catalysts can promote coke formation, while Lewis acid tends to rise more coke formation comparing with Bronsted acid [22,23]. Therefore, SnOx/SiO2 probably shows the deactivation during the reaction period. However, the above evidence showed that SnOx/SiO2 performs promising stability during the propane dehydrogenation; hence, the stability of this catalyst is likely be due to some factors that affect the reduction of coke formation on the acid site. Based on this hypothesis, the spillover of hydrogen should be brought for consideration.
Hydrogen spillover is the migration of the hydrogen atom, which is adsorbed or formed on one surface to another neighborhood surface [24]. This phenomenon was discovered since 1964 by Khoobiar, who found that the WO3 can be reduced at room temperature after physical mixing with Pt/Al2O3, whereas the physical mixing of WO3 with Al2O3 and the pure WO3 cannot be reduced. This result was attributed to the migration of hydrogen, which dissociated on the Pt surface and spilled to the WO3 [25]. Spillover of hydrogen is applied to many fields. For example, in hydrogen storage, semiconductor, insulator, and including the catalytic field [24,26]. In the field of a heterogeneous catalyst, there was evidence showing that spillover of hydrogen can reduce coke formation by the change of Lewis acid, which has a stronger influence on coke formation into Bronsted acid [27]. This Lewis acid transformation to Bronsted acid attributed to the hydrogen spillover effect was also proven by other researchers [28,29] using the FTIR technique. Moreover, some researchers purpose that hydrogen spillover can remove coke precursors across to the hydrogenation with spilled hydrogen to make the desorption possible for species like methane [30,31]. Based on this evidence, the good stability of SnOx/SiO2 is likely due to the hydrogen spillover effect.
In the experiment, K-PtSn/Al2O3 was used to compare with SnOx/SiO2. Hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and catalytic cracking were the side reactions that we needed to concern because hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation result in undesired alkane products, while catalytic cracking gives undesired methane and ethylene. Additionally, propylene dehydrogenation was selected to represent the deep dehydrogenation, which had an association with the generation of coke precursor and coke formation while propadiene was used to study the coke formation ability of SnOx/SiO2 catalyst. The spent catalyst was characterized by the TPO technique and the amount of coke represented by percent of carbon converting from the amount of CO2 per 1 g of catalyst. The acidity of the catalysts, which affected catalytic cracking and coke formation was determined by NH3-TPD, while H2-TPD, FTIR, and propylene hydrogenation were used to study the hydrogen spillover ability.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
K-PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by the sequential incipient wetness impregnation method. First, γ-alumina oxide support, obtained from calcinated boehmite (Sasol) at 550 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C/min for 4 h in box furnace, was impregned with a mixed aqueous solution of chloroplatinic acid hydrate and tin (II) chloride dihydrate in ethanol with 0.3 percent loading for both Pt and Sn. After dried in room temperature for 2 h, the sample was put into the oven with the fixed temperature at 110 °C overnight. The dried sample was calcined at 550 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C /min for 3 h in the air. Potassium nitrate in deionization water solution was secondly impregned into the catalyst with 0.6 percent loading. Finally, the wet sample was dried and calcined with the same procedure as the previous steps.
SnOx/SiO2 catalyst with 4 percent loading was prepared by the sol–gel method. Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and 30% ammonia solution were added into ethanol and deionized water mixture. The mixture was stirred for 15 min, then the homogeneous mixed solution of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and tin (II) chloride dihydrate in ethanol was added dropwise to the former solution while continuous stirring. After mixing for 2 h, the sample was filtered and washed with deionized water until the pH of washing water become the same as deionized water. The wet catalyst was dried at 110 °C overnight and then calcined in air at 550 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C /min for 6 h. The physicochemical properties of these two catalysts are shown in Table 1.

2.2. Catalytic reaction
The reaction was tested by using a fixed-bed reactor connected with GC-FID. All of the reactions were carried out under atmospheric pressure with 1 g of the catalyst. Before any reaction testing, the catalyst was pretreated under the same condition. Firstly, the temperature was ramped to 500 °C in N2 feed with a heating rate of 10 °C /min, and then the catalyst was reduced at 500 °C for 55 min using H2 and N2 co-feed with a flow rate of 50:50 mL/min after that purged the sample using N2 for 5 min subsequently raised the temperature to 600 and held for 30 min prior to starting the reaction.
For the reaction testing, 99.99% propane and 99.99% propylene with a weight hourly space velocity (WSHV) of 0.37 and 0.35 h−1 were respectively used as a feedstock for propane and propylene dehydrogenation, while 5% propylene in N2 co-feed with H2 and N2 in a ratio of 1:1:2 was used as a feed for propylene hydrogenation. The WSHV for this reaction was 2.39 h−1. For the reaction temperature, propane and propylene dehydrogenation were conducted at 600 °C, while propylene hydrogenation was conducted at 40 °C. To study the coke formation ability, 5% propadiene in nitrogen was used as a feedstock, and the reaction was conducted under the same condition with propylene dehydrogenation.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
2.3.1. The hydrogen temperature-programmed desorption (H2-TPD)
There were two procedures for H2-TPD. The first procedure was to compare K-PtSn/Al2O3 and Sn/SiO2. The second one was to find the reversible and non-reversible peak, which was related to hydrogen desorption on metal and support, respectively.
For the first procedure, 0.1 g of catalyst was pretreated with the same procedure as reaction testing. After finished the pre-treatment, the sample was cooled down to 40 °C, then adsorbed the hydrogen for 30 min subsequent to de-physisorption by nitrogen gas for 1 h after that temperature-programmed desorption was started from 40−900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C /min and held for 1 h. For the second procedure of H2-TPD, it used the same procedure as the reference testing on the Pt [32], in which 0.1 g of a catalyst was reduced at 300 °C, cooled in H2 and conducted the temperature program desorption from 40−700 °C. After that, the catalyst was reduced at 700 °C, cooled down in H2 and subsequently desorbed the second temperature program from 40 to 700 °C.
2.3.2. In situ IR spectroscopy
The catalyst was pretreated, adsorbed, and de-physisorbed with the same procedure as the first procedure of H2-TPD. The data were corrected after finished the pre-treatment process at 40 °C and after finished the de-physisorption at 40 °C. For the hydrogen desorption process, the temperature was raised to 125 °C, and held around 5 min and subsequently cooled down to 40 °C. At this temperature, the IR result was collected. Finally, the temperature was raised to 250 °C, and then it was held and cooled down to 40 °C and the data was corrected.
2.3.3. The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)
The spent catalyst was packed in a quartz column with 0.1 g catalyst. Then, the sample was exposed to 1% oxygen in helium gas using ﬂow rate of 25 mL/min. Finally, the temperature program was increased from room temperature up to 800 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C /min. The CO2 signal was collected using TCD and GC column.
2.3.4. The ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD)
For this testing, 0.1 g of catalyst was pretreated and cooled down to 40 °C, and then the sample was exposed to 15% NH3 in He gas for 30 min. After that the sample was de-physisorbed for 1 h. The temperature-programmed desorption was started at 40−800 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min and held for 1 h.
3. Results and discussion
Propane dehydrogenation on K-PtSn/Al2O3 and SnOx/SiO2 catalysts was conducted at 600 °C with a weight hourly space velocity (WSHV) of 0.37 h−1 for 5 h using 99.99% propane as a feedstock. The result in Fig. 1 shows the higher initial conversion at 42.3% for K-PtSn/Al2O3 compared with SnOx/SiO2 catalysts at 29.9%. However, K-PtSn/Al2O3 shows fast deactivation when compared with SnOx/SiO2 catalysts because of coke formation. The selectivity comparison showing in Fig. 2 illustrates that SnOx/SiO2 has higher propylene selectivity than K-PtSn/Al2O3 with the values of 84 and 78% at initial, respectively. Moreover, K-PtSn/Al2O3 shows higher undesired alkane selectivity. These alkane products, like methane and ethane, can roughly refer to hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation side reactions while methane and ethylene can refer to catalytic cracking, which SnOx/SiO2 shows more selective on this side reaction than K-PtSn/Al2O3. However, the comparison of our K-PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst with other researches showing in Table 2 informs that most of the other researches show better catalytic testing results than ours, especially the deactivation rate and selectivity. This result may be due to the difference in the feed mixture, type of alumina support, and percent loading of each elemental (Pt, Sn, and K). First, other researchers used co-feed propylene and hydrogen, while ours used pure propylene feed. There was evident showing that using co-feeding hydrogen can reduce coke precursors coverage on the catalyst surface. It also decreases the adsorption strength of the propylene product; hence propylene products can desorb easily. Moreover, it can increase energy barriers for the further dehydrogenation of propylene, resulting in a decrease of deep dehydrogenation [33]. Therefore, using co-feed hydrogen ought to show better activity and stability than using pure feed propane. Secondly, the different types of alumina support directly affect to selectivity and coke formation because θ-Al2O3 has less Bronsted acid than
-Al2O3 [1]; howbeit, due to the temperature limit of our equipment, we were unable to synthesize θ-Al2O3 support because it was necessary to calcinate at a very high temperature (>900 °C) [3,4]. Hence,
-Al2O3 was chosen to be a support for our K-PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst instead of θ-Al2O3. Finally, the percent of metals loading on our catalyst measured by the XRF technique was 0.9, 0.4, and 0.2% for K, Pt, and Sn, respectively. This percent loading might not be suitable. However, the catalytic testing result of our K-PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst could be comparable with the result of Li et al., in which they used the same support (
-Al2O3) with this work [5]. For our research, we emphasize the key of stability in SnOx/SiO2 catalyst corresponding to the results reported by Wang et al. They found that this catalyst has more stability than K-PtSn/Al2O3 [17]. This result was consistent with our experiment although our K-PtSn/Al2O3 showed much faster deactivation. The comparison trend between K-PtSn/Al2O3 and SnOx/SiO2 can be comparable.

According to the selectivity result of SnOx/SiO2, this catalyst tended to undergo the catalytic cracking side reaction when compared with K-PtSn/Al2O3. The active site for catalytic cracking was reported to be an acid site [1,34]. Although silica has a lower acidity than alumina support [35,36], the addition of Sn into silica can increase the surface hydroxyl and silanol groups [37], indicating an increase in the acid site. Fig. 3 shows the comparison of the ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) results between K-PtSn/Al2O3 and SnOx/SiO2. The total acidity of SnOx/SiO2 is higher than the K-PtSn/Al2O3 corresponding to higher activity in catalytic cracking. As known, many researches showed that the acidity could promote coke formation [4,22,23] resulting in the deactivation. However, SnOx/SiO2 still had better stability when compared with K-PtSn/Al2O3 due to lower coke deposition. This result may involve the strength of acidity. Some researches indicated that the preferable coke formation was increased with the acid strength [22], and the hydrogen spillover effect can reduce coke formation on the acid site [27]. The NH3-TPD result also indicated the strength of acidity on the catalyst surface. The peak position at 100, 250, and 400 °C can refer to the weak, medium, and strong acid sites, respectively [38,39]. SnOx/SiO2 shows a large amount of medium acid site, while K-PtSn/Al2O3 shows much of the weak and strong acid. The higher amount of strong acid on the K-PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst maybe one reason that convinces the faster deactivation on K-PtSn/Al2O3 comparing with SnOx/SiO2. However, the amount of total acid on SnOx/SiO2 is still higher than K-PtSn/Al2O3, so the hydrogen spillover effect was brought to consider.

The hydrogen temperature-programmed desorption (H2-TPD) results compared between SnOx/SiO2 and K-PtSn/Al2O3 are displayed in Fig. 4. There are two peaks around 350 and 750 °C for K-PtSn/Al2O3, while it has four peaks occurred at 125, 200, 500, and 800 °C for Sn/SiO2. From the reference [32], peak at 350 °C of K-PtSn/Al2O3 was referred to the hydrogen spillover on support, while the peak at 750 °C occurred from the decomposition of a catalyst. The low-temperature peak of hydrogen desorption on a metal site at 175 °C did not appear owing to a small amount of Pt loading. However, the peak criterion may differ for the non-Pt-base catalyst. For example, Ru-based catalysts had a peak of hydrogen adsorbed on a metal site at around 30−500 °C [40], while the temperature around 120−140 °C was corresponding to the desorption of hydrogen bonding to the metal site on TiO2 [41]. For SnO2, there were some studies about hydrogen desorption by Raman spectroscopy. They proposed that the peak on the temperature range of 180–550 °C exhibited the desorption of hydrogen-bonded on the active sites provided by SnO2 nanoparticles and multi-wall carbon nanotube, while the temperature range of 170–210 °C corresponded to the desorption of hydrogen from the hydrogenated single-wall carbon nanotube–SnO2 composite sample [42,43]. Unfortunately, there was no study about H2-TPD in SnOx/SiO2 catalyst; hence it is necessary to specify any peaks of Sn/SiO2, which appear on H2-TPD result in Fig. 4. For the specification process, the sample was tested using H2-TPD with the same procedure, which was tested on the Pt in the reference [32]. In addition, the in-situ IR spectroscopy was also used to confirm the testing result.

Fig. 5 shows H2-TPD results. The black line(A) is a reduction of SnOx/SiO2 at 300 °C, while red line(B) refers to the re-reduction of SnOx/SiO2 at 700 °C. The first TPD (A) shows two peaks at 125 and 250 °C. In a term of secondary TPD (B), the first peak disappears, while the later peaks around 200−500 °C still occur. This result indicates that the peak around 200–500 °C may occur from the desorption of hydrogen on tin oxide active sites, while an irreversible peak at 125 °C is likely due to the desorption of water. The broaderness of a later peak may be due to the slower desorption of hydrogen when compared to the first TPD. This suggests that the increase of hydrogen adsorption amount on a catalyst surface is due to the raising of the unsaturated tin oxide active sites amount from secondary reduction.

(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.).
In situ IR spectroscopy was used to support the H2-TPD result. Fig. 6 demonstrates the IR results at the temperature of 40 °C obtained after the pre-treatment process (line A), hydrogen adsorption, and physisorption at 40 °C (line B) and hydrogen desorption at 125 and 250 °C (line C and D), respectively. The peak at 3740 cm−1 refers to the isolated silanol group [44], while the changing in the intensity of the shoulder peak around 3600 cm−1 and two peaks around 3200 and 3060 cm−1 can be attributed to the changing in the total of a surface hydroxyl group [37,45,46] which was due to the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen from any surface of the catalyst consisting of metal and the support surface. However, because we are interested in hydrogen spillover on a silica support, the only peak at 3740 cm−1 was considered. The barely changing from A to D steps of that peak can indicate that only a few hydrogens can spill to a silica surface; therefore, it is possible that hydrogen spillover was hardly occurred on SnOx/SiO2. Moreover, the peak at 1610 cm-1, which represents the adsorbed water [37,47] shows the decreasing of intensity at line C when compared to line B. This result indicates that there was the desorption of water during hydrogen desorption at 125 °C.

IR spectra at 40 °C for SnOx/SiO2 after pre-treatment step – line A (black), after hydrogen adsorption for 30 min and hydrogen de-physisorption for 1 h – line B (blue), after hydrogen desorption at 125 °C – line C (red), and after hydrogen desorption at 250 °C – line D (green). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.).
From both of H2-TPD result in Fig. 5, and the FTIR results in Fig. 6, we can explain the result of SnOx/SiO2 in Fig. 4 that the first peak of H2-TPD at 125 °C was the desorption of water. The second peak around 200–500 °C represents the hydrogen desorption from tin oxide, while the peak of hydrogen spillover does not appear due to there was a slight amount of hydrogen spillover occurring on the SnOx/SiO2 catalyst. Therefore, it is clear that K-PtSn/Al2O3 had more hydrogen spillover than SnOx/SiO2. This conclusion corresponding to the catalytic hydrogenation testing result showing in Fig. 7. Because this reaction can be promoted by hydrogen spillover [48], it is reasonable that K-PtSn/Al2O3 exbibits a better hydrogenation activity than SnOx/SiO2, which does not activate this reaction at the same conditions. Additionally, the reason that leads to the lack of hydrogen spillover in the SnOx/SiO2 catalyst, although tin oxide can dissolve the hydrogen molecule [43,49], was a poor hydrogen receptivity of silica support [50]. However, due to the lack of hydrogen spillover, the cause of outstanding stability in the SnOx/SiO2 catalyst should not involve the effect of hydrogen spillover. Hence, the ability of coke precursor generation and the ability of coke formation on the catalysts were taken to consider.

Fig. 8 demonstrates the comparative result of propylene conversion in propylene dehydrogenation. The result shows that K-PtSn/Al2O3 has a higher propylene conversion than SnOx/SiO2, hence it can approximate that there was a higher degree of deep dehydrogenation occurring on K-PtSn/Al2O3. The TPO results of the spent catalyst from this reaction were shown as a solid line in Fig. 9. K-PtSn/Al2O3 has two peaks around 450 and 525 °C, while SnOx/SiO2 has only one peak around 550 °C. The TPO low-temperature peak around 400–450 °C in K-PtSn/Al2O3 result indicated the coke occurring on a metal site. This result was the major cause of the deactivation in the K-PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, while high-temperature peak around 550–600 °C, which appears on both K-PtSn/Al2O3 and SnOx/SiO2’s TPO results, indicates the coke occurring on support [51,52]. This result informs that the coke on the SnOx/SiO2 catalyst prefers to deposit on support contrasting with K-PtSn/Al2O3; therefore, this catalyst could express better stability than K-PtSn/Al2O3. In addition, the TPO result of SnOx/SiO2 shows obvious lower coke content than K-PtSn/Al2O3, for its reason. It was possible to explain in two points. First, the coke precursor generation on SnOx/SiO2 was less than that on K-PtSn/Al2O3 or second, SnOx/SiO2 has poor ability to adsorb coke precursor; hence the coke formation was limited. The actual reason was investigated by the testing of propadiene’s coke formation using SnOx/SiO2 as a catalyst. Then, the spent catalyst from this testing was brought to characterize using the TPO technique. This TPO result shows as a dashed line in Fig. 9, indicating the higher intensity of this sample compared with SnOx/SiO2 spent catalyst obtained from propylene dehydrogenation. This informs that the cause of low coke deposit on SnOx/SiO2 was not affected by the difficult of coke precursor adsorption on SnOx/SiO2. Hence, the excellent stability of SnOx/SiO2 was due to its poor ability in coke precursor generation.

The consideration of the atomic radius between Pt, Sn, and O showed that the radius distance order was O < Pt < Sn [53]. If each atom is bonded with C atom from the hydrocarbon molecule, the bonding of OC will be the strongest. The Pt-C should have a stronger bond than Sn–C. The strength of bonding directly influences the desorption of the hydrocarbon molecule, so the desorption of the hydrocarbon molecule from O atom in the SnOx/SiO2 catalyst must be the hardest. However, it contrasts with the experimental result, which showed that K-PtSn/Al2O3 had higher deep dehydrogenation than SnOx/SiO2. The electronegativity comparison showed that O atom in SnOx/SiO2 catalyst had more probability to bond with H atom, which was dissociated from hydrocarbon molecule, than C atom because the difference of electronegativity of O atom compared with H atom that had more than O atom compared with C atom [53]. Similarly to Sn, it had more differences in electronegativity between Sn and C atom than Sn and O atom [53], so Sn perhaps prefer to bond with C atom than H atom. This result was similar to the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation that occurred on Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS), which was proposed by Wang et al. [18]. This mechanism was consistent with our experimental result due to Sn had a higher atomic radius than Pt. Hence, SnOx/SiO2 had a weaker bonding with hydrocarbon molecule when compared with K-PtSn/Al2O3. This results in the easier desorption of hydrocarbon and the less probability to undergo further dehydrogenation on SnOx/SiO2 catalyst when compared with K-PtSn/Al2O3. Besides, the lower coke precursor generation on SnOx/SiO2 can be explained by its structure since the active species on SnOx/SiO2 catalyst is metal oxide, while K-PtSn/Al2O3 is a metal. There was a research explaining that the active species of metal coordinately unsaturated in a metal oxide was separated and spread homogeneously over catalyst surface. Thus, oxygen atoms partitioned each active species of a metal oxide catalyst. This partition causes the problem on the migration of the adsorbed hydrocarbons over catalyst surface, while the metal did not have this problem due to the closing of its active sites [1]. Moreover, the coke formation on Pt metal which occurred through a deep dehydrogenation and dimerization pathway was also proposed in the literature [1]. From the consideration of this coke formation mechanism, we found that the large distance between each of Sn active species and the smaller size of C atom when compared with Sn [53] may be the cause of difficulties in coke precursor generation. For a more clear view, Scheme 1A (upper) is constructed to illustrate the coke intermediate of deep dehydrogenation and dimerization pathway. This picture reveals that it is necessary to adsorb the secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of the hydrocarbon molecule on the nearby Pt active center. For, SnOx/SiO2 in Scheme 1A (lower), it shows the challenging for the bonding of secondary and tertiary carbon atoms because there was a long-distance between each of active sites. Therefore, the coke precursor of deep dehydrogenation and dimerization pathway was more difficult to be generated on SnOx/SiO2 than K-PtSn/Al2O3. These explanations can support our experimental results, which express that the SnOx/SiO2 catalyst had a lack of coke precursor generation. However, Scheme 1B illustrates that the coke formation on SnOx/SiO2 was possible to occur through the catalytic cracking pathway.

4. Conclusion
The comparative study of SnOx/SiO2 and K-PtSn/Al2O3 in propane dehydrogenation shows that K-PtSn/Al2O3 had higher catalytic activity than SnOx/SiO2. At the same time, the side reaction comparison of each catalyst informed that K-PtSn/Al2O3 preferred to selective hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation, while SnOx/SiO2 preferred to selective catalytic cracking because SnOx/SiO2 had higher total acidity than K-PtSn/Al2O3. Although the acidity directly influenced to coke formation, SnOx/SiO2 still had a lower coke formation than K-PtSn/Al2O3. Moreover, most of the coke occurring on SnOx/SiO2 deposited at the support, whereas the coke occurring on K-PtSn/Al2O3 could deposit at both metal and support. Therefore, SnOx/SiO2 had much better stability than K-PtSn/Al2O3. The H2-TPD and FTIR results show that the lower coke formation on SnOx/SiO2 was not a result of hydrogen spillover effect [27,30,31] due to the poor ability to receive hydrogen of its silica support. However, the additional experiments indicated the actual reason for SnOx/SiO2 to exhibit better stability than K-PtSn/Al2O3 according to the less of coke precursor generation on this catalyst. This result can be explained using the atomic radius and electronegativity. The electronegativity comparison informs that C atom perhaps prefer to bond with Sn atom than O atom. Because Sn has a larger atomic radius than Pt, the bonding of hydrocarbon molecule with Sn active sites was weaker than Pt active sites. It leads to a lower ability on deep dehydrogenation. Additionally, the wide distance of Sn active species due to the partition of a neighboring oxygen atom and the smaller of carbon atomic size compared with Sn atom causes to the difficulty in the secondary and tertiary carbon atom adsorption on the next Sn2+ active site. This was an important step in deep dehydrogenation and dimerization pathway. Hence, the coke formation from deep dehydrogenation and dimerization pathway had low probability, while the coke formation from the catalytic cracking pathway had a higher possibility. However, these were roughly explanations because there were many factors that influence the strength of bonding, which was not considered, such as the effect of positive charge in Sn2+ or Sn4+. This could affect the decrease of its atomic radius, the hybrid orbitals, and the lone pairs of electrons. To find the exact possible mechanism of coke formation, advanced computational techniques such as DFT will be necessary to apply.
