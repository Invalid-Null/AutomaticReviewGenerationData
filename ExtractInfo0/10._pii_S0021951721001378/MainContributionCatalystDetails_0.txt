 Based on the provided document, this does not appear to directly pertain to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses oxygen vacancies on aluminum oxide catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions, but does not specifically focus on propane dehydrogenation. Since propane dehydrogenation is not a main topic, I have indicated this is not relevant and will not provide additional details.
