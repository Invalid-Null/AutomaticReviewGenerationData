Highly selective and stable propane dehydrogenation to propene over dispersed VOx-species under oxygen-free and oxygen-lean conditions
Abstract
For the first time, we reported on a highly selective propane dehydrogenation to propene over SiO2-supported dispersed VOx species under oxygen-free and oxygen-lean conditions. Propene selectivity above 80% was achieved with propane conversions above 45% at 823–843 K. At operation under oxygen-lean conditions, consecutive propene conversion to COx was significantly suppressed and propene was formed additionally via the highly selective non-oxidative dehydrogenation route over the same catalyst. Usage of SiO2 supports (MCM-41, SBA-15, SiO2) with no strong acid sites and co-feeding of small O2 amounts lead to very limited coke formation (<2 wt. % after 20 h on-stream operation). This results in only slight decrease in time-on-stream performance (ca. 10% of deactivation during 20 h).

1. Introduction
The continuously growing demand for C2–C4 olefins stimulates research to improve the existing technologies or to develop new ones. The two main commercial sources are steam cracking of naphtha and liquid petroleum gas as well as fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil fractions. However, it is difficult to tune the selectivity towards a certain olefin in these processes. Functionalization of cheap and, as oil reserves run out, longer available C2–C4 alkanes from natural gas towards olefins is an attractive alternative. For example, non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene has been commercialized [1]. This reaction proceeds above 800 K due to thermodynamics constrains and often leads to cracking and formation of coke. Supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalytic materials are industrially applied. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes is free of the above limitations. However, it suffers from low olefin selectivity at industrially relevant alkane conversions [2]. In our previous contribution [3] we demonstrated that combining oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of iso-butane in one reactor system can significantly suppress consecutive iso-butene conversion to COx at high iso-butane conversions. As a result, iso-butene yields above 40% at iso-butene selectivity above 80% and COx selectivity below 2% were achieved. In the present contribution we elaborated this approach further and applied it for propane dehydrogenation to propene over SiO2-based supported catalysts possessing well-defined surface VOx species.
2. Experimental
Highly dispersed surface VOx species were prepared by impregnating differently structured pure silica supports (MCM-41, SiO2) and MCM-41 modified with TiO2 with a solution of vanadium acetylacetonate in toluene. Vanadium oxide supported on SBA-15 was synthesized by grafting vanadyl propoxide. The vanadium content and Ti/Si molar ratio were varied from 1 to11 wt.% and from 0 to 1.5, respectively. Details of catalysts preparation and their thorough characterization (TEM, TPR, in situ UV/vis, in situ Raman) have been reported previously [4], [5], [6]. The presence of only highly dispersed VOx species (no three-dimensional VOx-aggregates) was proven for the samples, having up to 5 wt.% of V. The samples are denoted here by their amount of vanadium loading (e.g. sample with V loading of 5.3 wt.%, designated as VOx(5)/MCM-41). Catalytic tests were performed using feeds of 15–40 vol.% C3H8 in Ne with (0–0.5) O2/C3H8 ratios and modified contact times (W/F) of 0.003–18 g s ml−1 at temperatures of 773–843 K in a fixed-bed quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure, using 0.005–0.6 g of catalyst. Catalyst particles of 0.1–0.2 mm were used for these investigations. The catalyst was sandwiched between two layers of quartz particles (0.25–0.35 mm) to fix the catalyst, to pre-heat the reaction feed, and to minimize the dead volume of the reactor in the hot zone. The reactor was immersed into a fluidized bed of quartz sand to provide isothermal operating conditions. A movable thermocouple inside the reactor was used to control temperature inside the catalyst bed. The feed components and the reaction products were analyzed by an on-line GC (HP 5890-II) using a Poraplot Q column and a Molsieve 5 column. Ar was used as carrier gas for GC analysis of H2; N2 was used instead of Ne in the reaction feed for a proper detection of H2. The conversion of feed components, selectivity and yield of reaction products were calculated from the inlet and outlet concentrations considering the changes of reaction volume during the reaction.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Propane dehydrogenation under oxygen-free and oxygen-lean conditions
Operation under the oxygen-lean or oxygen-free conditions (the ratio of C3H8/O2 > 10) described in this paper results in highly selective propane dehydrogenation. The propene selectivity was above 90% at a propane conversion of up to 30% (Fig. 1). The main side products were CH4, C2H4 and C2H6. However, their individual selectivity did not exceed 5% even at a propane conversion of approximately 50%. Selectivity with respect to COx (mainly CO) depends on O2 partial pressure. The selectivity can be kept below 5% by operating with C3H8/O2 ratios higher than 10. Tiny amounts of COx were also formed during the first 1–2 h of operation under oxygen-free conditions This is due to the fact that propane/propene were combusted over oxidized VOx species until the latter were reduced.

In comparison to oxidative dehydrogenation under stoichiometric (C3H8/O2 = 2/1) conditions (Fig. 2a), the dehydrogenation of propane under oxygen-lean conditions (Fig. 2c) is significantly more selective to propene, and results in a propene yield of up to 40% at 823–843 K. In our previous contribution [7] we did not observe significant difference in propene selectivity in the oxidative propane dehydrogenation over highly dispersed VOx species supported over SiO2-supports with different morphology (amorphous SiO2, MCM-41, and MCM-48). The same is valid for vanadia supported over SBA-15 (Fig. 2a). Propene selectivity obtained over VOx(5)/MCM-41 and VOx(4)/SBA-15 was very similar at comparable degree of propane conversion upon oxidative propane dehydrogenation under stoichiometric conditions (Fig. 2a) and the dehydrogenation under oxygen-lean conditions (Fig. 2c).

Fig. 2. Selectivity to propene vs. propane conversion at different modes of operation over VOx(5)/MCM-41 (●) and VOx(4)/SBA-15 (□) catalysts: (a) oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) under stoishiometric inlet concentration (C(C3H8)/C(O2) = 2, T = 773 K, W/F = 0.01–0.04 s g ml−1, (b) oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH + DH) under stoishiometric inlet concentration (C(C3H8)/C(O2) = 2, T = 833 K, W/F = 0.03–11 s g ml−1, (c) oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH + DH) under oxygen-lean conditions (C(C3H8)/C(O2) > 10, T = 833 K, W/F = 0.03–18 s g ml−1. Reaction feed: C3H8 – 15 vol.%; O2 – 0–0.5 vol.% in Ne/N2.
The differences between previously reported iso-butane dehydrogenation [3] and propane dehydrogenation under oxygen-lean conditions are the following: (1) due to a stronger CH bond in the propane molecule in comparison with that in the iso-butane molecule, 3–4 times longer contact time is required to achieve a comparable degree of alkane conversion at similar temperatures (2) thermodynamic limitation of propane dehydrogenation [8] results in a lower maximal yield of propene at a given T and alkane concentration (3) propane dehydrogenation is more selective than iso-butane dehydrogenation, in the latter case selectivity to side n-butenes reach 15% at iso-C4H10 conversion above 50% [3].
Because non-oxidative dehydrogenation is significantly slower than oxidative dehydrogenation (it will be discussed in the next chapter), a significantly longer modified contact time (W/F > 0.1 g s ml−1) and slightly higher temperature (T = 823–843 K) should be applied to get a significant contribution of non-oxidative dehydrogenation. However, longer contact times and higher temperatures are not sufficient to achieve a very high propene selectivity. If reaction is performed with a stoichiometic inlet ratio of C3H8/O2 = 2 (Fig. 2b), the selectivity to propene will never be higher than 70%, and COx selectivity will be around 30%. The difference between areas (b and c) in Fig. 2 is the O2 content. To get a really selective performance in propane dehydrogenation (the same is valid also for iso-butane dehydrogenation) the reaction should be performed under oxygen-lean conditions, alkane/O2 > 10. The different trends in the plots of the selectivity as a function of conversion for different oxygen content, however, may indicate, that different reaction mechanisms prevail under the different regimes. With variation of oxygen content the contributions of different reaction pathways of propene formation, namely non-oxidative and oxidative, are varied.
One more aspect should be commented on at this point. To get a significant contribution of non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the contact time was increased considerably, by 10–20 times of the original. However, this increased modified contact time (W/F) is still in the range of 2–5 g s ml−1. Supported VOx-aggregates are very active in oxidative dehydrogenation, even when they are supported on pure SiO2-supports and an alkane with a relatively strong CH bond (propane) is converted. At T = 773 K, over supported VOx-aggregates, a high degree of alkane conversion could be achieved at W/F less than 1 g s ml−1 via the oxidative dehydrogenation route at sufficient O2 content. However, the best olefin yields in “oxidative dehydrogenation” of propane and iso-butane were obtained in the literature mostly at a W/F higher than 1 g s ml−1 and temperatures of T = 823–873 K [2], [9], [10]. This is in area (b) of Fig. 2, where we also started from the stoichiometric ratio of C3H8/O2 = 2; however, in this area a significant contribution of non-oxidative dehydrogenation takes place, and formation of H2 was detected.
To get a significant contribution of non-oxidative dehydrogenation we need to apply longer W/F (2–5 g s ml−1) and slightly higher temperatures (823–843 K). At such conditions the contribution of gas-phase non-catalytic dehydrogenation is possible. However, these gas-phase reactions greatly depend on the free volume in a hot zone of the reactor. All our experiments were performed with a minimized volume in a hot zone of reactor and we tested the propane dehydrogenation over fused SiO2 at 833 K and W/F of 5 g s ml−1. The degree of propane conversion did not exceed 0.3% without the catalyst. Thus, the contribution of non-catalytic gas-phase propane conversion is negligible under the conditions applied, and propene is formed catalytically and very selectively under these conditions.
Propane dehydrogenation under oxygen-lean conditions can be presented as following. In the front part of the reactor mainly oxidative propane dehydrogenation takes place with formation of propene, water and carbon oxides (Scheme 1). Most of the VOx species are in the highest oxidation state 5+. At the reactor outlet predominantly non-oxidative dehydrogenation with the formation of propene and hydrogen occurs. The reduction degree of VOx species strongly increases along the catalyst bed. As a result, alkane dehydrogenation occurs via different reaction mechanisms in different zones of the catalyst bed. We would like to emphasize that such a combination of ODH and DH proceeds not simply by superposition of two processes. The catalytic process is complex with a series of competing reactions occurring simultaneously including carbon deposition resulting in catalyst deactivation. Moreover, this catalyst deactivation is very likely to proceed with different rates in various reactor zones due to various reduction degrees of VOx species, different partial pressures of oxygen and reaction products.

3.2. Factors affecting activity and time-on-stream stability
One of the main disadvantages of non-oxidative dehydrogenation in comparison to oxidative dehydrogenation is a fast catalyst deactivation under oxygen-free conditions. VOx-supported catalysts are already reported in the literature for non-oxidative alkane dehydrogenation. However, to our knowledge, no stable performance in alkane dehydrogenation has been reported so far. Thus, in non-oxidative butane dehydrogenation over VOx/Al2O3 catalysts [11], [12], [13], [14] under comparable conditions already after 30 min of operation 7–8 wt.% of carbon deposits were detected.
These carbon deposits can have own activity in dehydrogenation reaction [15]. Studies are in progress to distinguish activity and selectivity of VOx-species and carbon deposits in the formation of olefins. However, all results in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 were obtained within 1–2 h of operation, e.g. at the minimized influence of carbon deposits.
Fig. 3 shows the propene yield obtained over the VOx(5)/MCM-41 catalysts (black circles) over 20 h on-stream. During this period of time, the yield decreased slightly from its maximum value of ca. 42 to ca. 37%. This is remarkable when comparing with the results from [11], [12], [13], [14] having reported about a ca. 50% decline in the butane production over VOx/Al2O3 within only 30–60 min on stream. Such relatively stable operation is due to the very low formation of carbon-containing species on the catalyst surface. The amount of carbon deposits formed over the catalyst after 20 h on-stream was only 0.8 wt.% of the catalyst mass, as was determined by TPO (temperature-programmed oxidations). The maximum on the TPO profile for MCM-41- and SiO2-based catalysts with highly dispersed VOx-species was below 723 K, i.e. lower than the reaction temperature. Coke formation increases with an increase in Ti content in the support (for Ti/Si = 0.2 ca. 1 wt.% of C, and for Ti/Si = 1.5 ca. 2 wt.% of C is detected after 20 h on-stream), resulting in less stable performance of VOx/SiO2-TiO2 catalysts (Fig. 3, grey triangles). It is important that such higher coke depositions are obtained over Ti-containing samples under the same reaction conditions (temperature, propane concentration, contact time) and even at lower total amount of propene produced (Fig. 3). As evidenced from TPO tests with used catalysts, another carbon-containing species are formed over the VOx/SiO2-TiO2 catalyst containing the highest titania (Ti/Si = 1.5) amount. These species start to be oxidized at a ca. 50 K higher temperature. We conclude therefore, that Ti increases the total amount of carbon deposition under oxygen-lean conditions and the amount of strongly bonded carbon deposits. As a result, the time-on-stream performance is less stable (Fig. 3).

This relatively stable time-on-stream performance achieved over VOx-supported on SiO2-supports is an important and significant feature of oxygen-lean operation over silica-supported vanadium-based catalysts compared to the alkane dehydrogenation over VOx/Al2O3 from [11], [12], [13], [14] or present VOx/TiO2-SiO2. This may be due to the fact that the strong support acidity favors carbon deposition due to an increased propene adsorption.
In order to prove in the presence of Ti in Ti-SiO2 materials influences the activity supported VOx species in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, we estimated initial turn-over frequencies (TOF) of propane conversion from test at low degrees of propane conversion (X(C3H8) < 5%). The results are presented in Fig. 4. For comparative purpose, the corresponding values for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) over the same catalysts from [5] are also reported in this figure. It is clearly seen that Ti dramatically increases the TOF values of the oxidative dehydrogenation while those characteristics of the oxygen-free propane conversion are not influenced. This is probably due to different reaction mechanisms. It is well established that the ODP reaction occurs via a Mars van Krevelen sequence, in which redox properties of VOx species are important [16] and influenced by the presence of Ti in SiO2 [5]. The oxygen-free propane dehydrogenation occurs probably via a not redox mechanism. This points at possible direction of search of the better oxides catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. In contrast to the oxidative propane dehydrogenation, vanadia supported over Al- and Ti-containing supports are not the best choice for the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation.

4. Conclusions
For the first time, we report on a highly selective and relatively stable propane dehydrogenation to propene over SiO2-supported dispersed VOx species under oxygen-free and oxygen-lean conditions. Propene selectivity above 80% is obtained at propane conversions above 45% at 823–843 K. A stable on stream performance over at least 20 h on stream was achieved over silica-supported catalysts due to low coke formation. Propene yield exceeded 40% under optimized conditions.
