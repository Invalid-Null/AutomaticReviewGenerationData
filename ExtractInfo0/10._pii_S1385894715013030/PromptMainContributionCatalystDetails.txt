Abstract
The Mg(Al)O-x supports with different Mg/Al molar ratios and the supported bimetallic Pt–In catalysts are synthesized, characterized by several state-of-art methods and applied to propane dehydrogenation reaction. The results verify that the Mg/Al molar ratio markedly influences the structure, properties and catalytic performances of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction. It is found that the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 catalyst (Mg/Al molar ratio is 4:1) has nanoflake-like structure, the largest specific surface area, the smallest average metal particle size (2.5 nm), the highest Pt dispersion and harmonious acid–base properties of the catalyst. Meanwhile, the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 catalyst exhibits good reducibility of metal species due to the moderate interactions between metals and support according to H2-TPR results. The highest propane conversion and propylene selectivity are got over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 catalyst, which nearly exhibits no deactivation during one 12 h once-through propane dehydrogenation reaction. Moreover, the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 catalyst possesses good reproducibility ability. After 8 reaction–regeneration cycles, the initial and final propane conversions still attain 66.4% and 43.5% accompanied with the propylene selectivity above 95%.
1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins is generally carried out at high temperature to obtain high olefin yield as it is an endothermic process. Nevertheless, the deactivation of the catalyst and the undesirable side reactions are inevitable at high temperature due to coke deposition, cracking and hydrogenolysis reactions [1], [2], [3], [4].
Platinum (Pt) is known to be the most effective transition metal for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes [5]. However, monometallic Pt supported catalysts exhibited low olefin selectivity, catalyst activity and stability [6]. Doping additional promoters such as Sn, Pb, Ga, Ge, Zn, Ca, Cu, In or Na to interact with Pt could improve the catalytic performances and suppress coke formation in propane dehydrogenation reaction [3], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The bimetallic Pt–Sn supported catalysts have been widely studied in the open literatures. Numerous articles reported that tin promoter had advantageous effects on monometallic Pt catalysts: it could improve the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent them from sintering; it could weaken Lewis acid sites of catalyst surface and increase alkene selectivity in dehydrogenation reaction; it could influence the oxidation and reduction properties of Pt to facilitate the reduction of Pt species; it could decrease the rate of coke formation and facilitate the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to support; it could change the interactions between Pt and support and enhance catalytic stability [7], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. These effects of Sn promoter were generally summarized into two main sides: geometric effect and electronic effect [12], [23], [24], [25]. However, the properties of PtSn catalysts greatly depended on the compositions of their precursors and synthesis procedure [26]. In contrast, Pt–Indium (In) catalysts may be more suitable for dehydrogenation due to its less dependence on the preparation procedure [27]. The works of Román-Martínez et al. [28] and Passos et al. [29] verified that Pt–In supported catalysts had narrower particle size distribution and more uniform composition than Pt–Sn catalysts.
Furthermore, it was generally accepted that the support not only impacted the catalytic performances of the dehydrogenation process, but also affected the properties of the final metal phase [30], [31]. Previous studies showed that metal oxide supports including K-L zeolite, spinels, alkali-doped alumina, calcined hydrotalcite greatly suppressed coke formation due to the free of acid sites and low alkene adsorption [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. Among these supports, the studies about the calcined hydrotalcite (Mg(Al)O) or hydrotalcite-like materials were especially attractive due to their moderate basic characteristics and high thermal stability. In addition, such materials can effectively help the dispersion of the metal particles owing to Al cations presented on the support surface [38], [39]. Akporiaye et al. [40] reported that PtSn/Mg(Al)O catalysts exhibit superior activity and stability compared to conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The recent studies reported that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O or Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts with hydrotalcite-like supports by substituting Al with Ga and In cations displayed better catalytic activity and high alkene selectivity [5], [14], [15], [41]. The XANES, EXAFS and high-resolution TEM were employed to verify that part Ga3+(or In3+) cations were reduced and the resulted zero-valent promoter forms PtGa (or PtIn) alloy particles. The previous studies in this side were mostly devoted to discussing the influences of doped cations on catalytic performance. As far as we know, little attention was paid to the effects of the Mg/Al ratio of the carriers on the catalytic performances in propane dehydrogenation reaction.
The objective of this work is to study the influences of different Mg/Al molar ratio on the catalytic performances of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The Mg(Al)O-x support was firstly synthesized, and then doped with Pt and In species by successive impregnation method. The structure–performance relationships of the catalysts are elucidated upon propane dehydrogenation reaction and numerous characterization techniques.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of Mg(Al)O-x supports
The calcined hydrotalcite (referred as Mg(Al)O) was prepared by co-precipitation and subsequent thermal treatment [42]. First, 30 g Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and appropriate amount of Al(NO3)3·9H2O (depending on the desired Mg/Al molar ratio a, a = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8) were dissolved in 100 mL deionized water. Another solution was prepared with the desired amounts of Na2CO3 and NaOH (depending on the CO32−/Al3+ molar ratio b and OH−/(Mg2+ + Al3+) molar ratio c, b = c = 2) dissolved in 100 mL deionized water. Then, two solutions were mixed drop-wise with stirring at 60 °C for 20 min. The solution pH was controlled at 9–10. Afterwards, the mixed solution was aged at room temperature for 18 h. The resulting suspension was filtered, washed with deionized water to neutrality, and dried in air at 110 °C for 10 h. The dried hydrotalcite (HT) was then heated at 700 °C for 10 h to obtain the calcined supports (Mg(Al)O-x), where x represents the Mg/Al molar ratio of the synthesized support.
2.2. Preparation of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts
The PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation method. Firstly, Indium was deposited onto the calcined Mg(Al)O-x support by impregnating indium nitrate aqueous solution with InNO3·4.5H2O as the precursor at room temperature for 12 h. Secondly, the samples were dried at 50 °C for 3 h and then dried at 120 °C for 2 h. After that, the catalysts were calcined at 550 °C for 4 h. Finally, the same procedure as In impregnation was conducted to introduce Pt species using H2PtCl6·6H2O as precursor and achieve the final catalysts. Each catalyst contains 0.6 wt% Pt and 1.5 wt% In in all the cases. The prepared catalyst samples were labeled as PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x.
2.3. Catalysts characterizations
2.3.1. XRD
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts were collected on a Bragg–Brentano diffractometer (Rigaku D /Max-2000) with a monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The samples were scanned from the 2θ value of 20–80° with a scan speed of 2°/min. The X-ray tube was manipulated at 40 kV and 30 mA.
2.3.2. Low temperature N2 adsorption/desorption
The textural properties PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption–desorption at liquid nitrogen temperature with an automatic analyzer (NOVA 4000, Quantachrome, USA). The samples were previously degassed for 4 h at 300 °C. The specific surface areas of the samples were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size model was used to calculate the average pore diameter according to the desorption branch of the isotherms.
2.3.3. FESEM
The morphologies of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts were examined by a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S-4800) operated at 5.0 kV.
2.3.4. NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD
The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 and CO2 measurements were implemented to analyze the acidity and basicity of the catalysts. The sample (∼0.1 g) was pretreated at 400 °C for 1 h under a helium flow (30 ml/min) before being cooled to 120 °C and saturated with adsorbed gas. During desorption, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was employed to record the TPD profiles from 120 to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
2.3.5. C3H6-TPD
The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of C3H6 measurements were implemented to determine the interactions between propylene and catalysts. All the catalysts were reduced in situ under hydrogen atmosphere at 580 °C for 2.5 h. The pre-reduced samples (∼0.1 g) were pretreated at 400 °C for 1 h under a helium flow (30 ml/min) and cooled to 50 °C. The catalysts were saturated with propylene gas at 50 °C, and then washed with flowing He for 1 h. During desorption, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was employed to record the TPD profiles from 50 °C to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
2.3.6. TEM
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the as-synthesized catalysts were taken with a JEM-2010 microscope operated at 200 kV. The samples after reductive treatment were dispersed and sonicated in ethanol. Then, a small drop of this dispersion liquid was placed onto carbon-film and coated with copper grids, and dried in air before testing. Above one hundred individual metal particles were collected for the determination of average particle size of each sample.
2.3.7. H2-TPR
The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were implemented in a programmable temperature system. Prior to TPR analysis, the catalyst (0.2 g) was pretreated in a argon(Ar) flow (15 mL/min) at 500 °C for 1 h. Then the baseline was stabilized in this gas flow at 25 °C for 60 min. Afterwards, the reactor was heated in a mixture of 10% H2 in Ar from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Finally, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) cell was used to monitor and record the H2 consumption.
2.3.8. XPS
The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts were recorded on Perkin-Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA using Al Kα radiation. All samples were reduced in situ under hydrogen at 580 °C for 2.5 h. The binding energies (BE) were calibrated using the C1s level at 284.8 eV as an internal standard.
2.3.9. TG
Thermogravimetric analysis was used to determine the coke amount on the spent catalysts with a LCT thermogravimetric analyzer (DTG-60H), which was conducted from room temperature to 800 °C at a rising rate of 20 °C/min.
2.3.10. CO chemisorption
Pt dispersion of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts was determined by CO chemisorption on Autosorb-iQ unit (Quantachrome, USA). 1.0 g fresh samples were pre-reduced in situ under hydrogen at 580 °C for 2.5 h. Then the catalysts were pretreated in a helium (99.99%) flow of 30 mL/min at 200 °C for 1 h. CO chemisorption was performed at 30 °C by injecting CO pulses of 5 vol% CO/He every 4 min until the signal value became stable. To calculate the metal dispersion, an adsorption stoichiometry of CO/Pt = 1 was assumed.
2.4. Propane dehydrogenation reaction
The propane dehydrogenation reactions were performed in a fix-bed quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm. The catalyst (0.3 g) was placed into the center of reactor and reduced in H2 at 580 °C for 2.5 h. Afterwards, the feed gas including H2, C3H8 and Ar (H2/C3H8/Ar molar ratio = 7:8:35, WHSV = 3.3 h−1) was fed to the reactor. The propane dehydrogenation reactions were performed at 620 °C. A gas chromatography (GC, SP-6890) equipped with a FID detector and an AT-PLOT PORA-Q capillary column was employed to analyze the gas compositions. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were based on the total number of carbon atom balance.
The reaction-regeneration cycles were carried out as following. The catalysts were reacted at 620 °C and regenerated under air atmosphere with a flow rate of 30 mL/min in situ at 580 °C for 2 h. After regeneration, the catalysts were reduced in H2 atmosphere at 580 °C for 2.5 h prior to the next reaction cycle.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of Mg/Al molar ratio on textural properties of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts
To evaluate the pore structure parameters of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts, low-temperature N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms are conducted and shown in Fig. 1(a). All samples exhibit typical type IV adsorption isotherms with different hysteresis loops, implying the typical mesoporous structure of the catalysts. As depicted in Fig. 1(a), the isotherm of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 is similar to that of Ca500-Pt/Al catalyst reported by Yu [43], presenting a very similar shape as γ-Al2O3 material. The hysteresis loop of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-2 can be classified as type H3 (according to IUPAC), the pores are correlated with slit-shaped pores due to the aggregation of flake-like particles [44]. Furthermore, type H2 hysteresis loop can be observed over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-6 and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-8 samples, which was often associated with complex and interconnected pore structure [45]. However, the isotherms of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 sample present an intermediate shape between those of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-2 and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-6. It is obvious that the pore structures of samples vary correspondingly with the increase of Mg/Al molar ratio. The chemical compositions and textural properties of the samples are listed in Table 1. Among these catalysts, PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 shows the highest SBET of 188.5 m2 g−1. With the further increase of Mg/Al ratio, the SBET value notably decreases. Fig. 1(b) shows the pore size distributions of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts determined by the BJH model according to the desorption branches of the isotherms. As a whole, the pore diameter presents an opposite variation in accordance with that of SBET. The variations of total specific surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter with Mg/Al molar ratio may be ascribed to the difference of the pore structure.

3.2. Effect of Mg/Al molar ratio on morphologies of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts
The FESEM images of different PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts are displayed in Fig. 2. PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 sample has the aggregate crystal particle clusters with small flakes inserting the surface. In contrast, the great difference can be observed over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-2 and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 catalysts, which exhibits slit-shaped pores ascribed to nanoflakes interleaving with each other. Similar structures have been shown for Mg–Al-LDH (Mg/Al = 3:1) materials [44]. It is interesting that compared to PtIn/Mg(Al)O-2, flower-like spheres with small and flaky debris can be found in PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 sample. When Mg/Al ratio increases to 6 and 8, more complex structures with interconnected pores are noted over the samples. These results are in accordance with BET results (Section 3.1), indicates that the sample morphology alters with the change of Mg/Al ratio.

3.3. Effect of Mg/Al molar ratio on crystalline phases of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts
Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts. As can be seen, the characteristic peaks of the spinel MgAl2O4 (JCPD No. 21-1152) are found for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 sample [46], [47], [48]. In this case, the γ-Al2O3 phase cannot be observed easily, which is attributed to the overlapped diffraction peaks of γ-Al2O3 and MgAl2O4. When Mg/Al ratio increases from 2 to 8, the XRD patterns of the catalysts present periclase (MgO) as the primary crystal phase accompanied with the unconspicuous peaks of meixnerite (Mg6Al2(OH)18·4H2O) and γ-Al2O3. The intensity of diffraction peaks increases as the Mg/Al mole ratio increases, suggesting that more crystal phase of MgO is formed. Based on these results, it can be concluded that MgO, meixnerite and γ-Al2O3 coexist in the catalysts with the Mg/Al molar ratio of 2–8, and the MgO content increases as the Mg/Al ratio increases. Moreover, the diffraction peaks of Pt and In species are not been detected for all the catalysts as their small particle size and/or low concentration below XRD detection limit.

As far as the aforementioned discussions are concerned, the textural properties, crystalline phases and morphologies of the catalysts correspond to each other. The difference in morphology of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts (presented in Fig. 2) leads to the variation of hysteresis loop (shown in Fig. 1(a)) type. In addition, in case of the crystal phase (shown in Fig. 3), characteristic peaks of the spinel MgAl2O4 are found for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 sample, but the other four catalysts with Mg/Al from 2 to 8 present periclase (MgO) as the primary crystal phase. Therefore, the XRD results accord with isotherms and morphologies well.
3.4. Effect of Mg/Al molar ratio on acid–base properties of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts
It is well known that dehydrogenation performance of light paraffin is closely related to the acidic properties of catalyst surface [49], [50], which can be probed by temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) method. The NH3-TPD profiles of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 4. The semi-quantitative analysis is also achieved by deconvoluting the peaks with Gaussian curve fitting method. The calculated results are listed in Table 2. As can be seen from Fig. 4, all the catalysts display a similar curve shape containing a broad desorption peak centered at 190–220 °C accompanied with a shoulder at 280–310 °C and a well-defined peak with a maximal temperature (TM) at ∼500 °C. The three fitted peaks can be ascribed to weak, medium and strong acid sites (in Fig. 4), which should be attributed to the Lewis acidity of MgO–Al2O3 mixed oxide [51]. It can be seen that the total acidity of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts decreases obviously with the increase of Mg/Al molar ratio, and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 catalyst with the lowest Mg content exhibits the highest total acidity. It can be explained that the existence of MgO can reduce the acidity properties of the catalysts [50]. Furthermore, it can be seen from Table 2 that the fraction of two low temperature peaks (I + II) of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 is 53.5%, which is clearly higher than those of other catalysts.

The basicity of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts was detected by the temperature-programmed desorption of CO2(CO2-TPD) and summarized in Fig. 5 and Table 3. As can be seen from Fig. 5, all the samples exhibit three fitted peaks at 180–200 °C, 200–350 °C and around 500 °C, which can be ascribed to the surface sites of weak (OH− groups), medium (Mg2+–O2− pairs) and strong (isolated O2− anions) basicity of Mg(Al)O-x respectively [52]. From Table 3, it can be seen that the fraction of weak and medium basicity increases as Mg/Al ratio increases. Meanwhile, the desorption peak at high temperature corresponding to the strong basicity slightly shifts to higher temperature (shown in Fig. 5). These results imply that the basicity can be improved by increasing Mg content. Moreover, the highest total basicity is observed over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 catalyst, and the value decreases with further increase of Mg/Al ratio (low Al content). It can be explained that the formed surface amorphous AlOy structure in samples with low Al content (Mg/Al > 5) partially covered the Mg2+–O2− pairs [52].

All aforementioned results verify that acidic and basic sites coexist on the surface of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts. The Mg/Al ratio markedly influences the acidity and basicity of catalysts, which will influence the catalytic properties. With a suitable Mg/Al ratio of 4:1, the catalyst possesses the highest fraction of weak and medium acid sites, which can effectively suppress the undesired side reactions. Besides, the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 catalyst displays enough basicity, which may further improve the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation.
3.5. Effect of Mg/Al molar ratio on reduction property of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts
Fig. 6(a) shows the H2-TPR curves of Pt/Mg(Al)O-4, In/Mg(Al)O-4 and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 catalysts. As can be seen, the monometallic catalyst of In/Mg(Al)O-4 exhibits two well-defined peaks at about 465 °C and 580 °C, implying different interactions between In species and Mg(Al)O-4 support. For the monometallic catalyst of Pt/Mg(Al)O-4 sample, the peak located at 690 °C should be related to the reduction of Al of support, which is unconspicuous over In/Mg(Al)O-4 sample due to the overlap by In reduction peak at high temperature. The two other peaks at around 410 °C and 560 °C can be attributed to the reduction of Pt species. The corresponding temperature of the Pt reduction peak is significantly higher than that reported in previous study [29], [32], [53]. It may be attributed to that the interaction between Pt and particular Mg(Al)O-4 material (P-M interaction) is stronger than that between Pt and Al2O3 (or MgAl2O4) support. The reduction profile of the bimetallic PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 catalyst displays a main peak at 540 °C (peak II) and a big shoulder at 430 °C (peak I). Peak I can be easily associated with the reduction of Pt species. Its intensity is higher than that of monometallic Pt/Mg(Al)O-4 catalyst, suggesting that a low reduction temperature of Pt after introducing In. Peak II may be related to the co-reduction of Pt with In. From Fig. 6(a), it is worthy noting that the peak intensity of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 sample is much lower than that of In/Mg(Al)O-4, which indicates the reduction of In species was inhibited after the impregnation of the support with Pt species and the subsequent thermal treatment.

The effect of Mg/Al molar ratio on the reducibility of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts is determined by H2-TPR and illustrated in Fig. 6(b). It can be seen that PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 catalyst exhibits a main reduction consumption peak at about 560 °C (peak II) and a shoulder at lower temperature (around 430 °C, peak I). From Fig. 6(b), it is obvious that the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 sample has the strongest reduction peak at 430 °C, implying that more Pt oxide species can be reduced over this sample. At the same time, the co-reduction peak of Pt and In shifts to a relatively lower temperature (at about 540 °C), suggesting that an appropriate proportion of Mg (Mg/Al = 4) could moderate the interaction between metal and support, and promote the co-reduction of Pt and In species. However, as Mg/Al molar ratio increases to 6 and 8, the major reduction peak shifts to 560 °C and 580 °C, implying that with the excessive proportion of Mg, the co-reduction of Pt and In species becomes more arduous. The similar effect was also reported by Zhang [54]. In the case of high temperature reduction zone, it is noteworthy that the strongest signal can be found over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 sample, indicating that more Al cations can be reduced which is in line with the highest value of Al content among all the samples. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the Mg/Al ratio plays an important role in the reducibility of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x. Appropriate Mg content can facilitate the reduction of Pt species and moderate the interactions between Pt, In and support.
In order to further determine the chemical state of In species, XPS measurements are conducted over the catalysts. The XPS spectra for In3d5/2 of three typical catalysts after reduction are shown in Fig. 7. The deconvolution results of the corresponding spectra are summarized in Table 4. There are two peaks at ∼444.1 eV and ∼445.2 eV representing zerovalent and oxidation state of In respectively on the catalysts [17]. As can be seen in Table 4, the percentages of oxidation state In for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1, PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-8 catalysts are about 20, 60 and 55% (upon the data of In3d5/2), respectively. It is obvious that the lowest content of oxidation state In is observed over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 catalyst and the highest value is obtained over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4. This result verifies that the suitable Mg/Al molar ratio can strengthen In–support interaction, stabilizing the oxidized indium species; while the low Mg content leads to large amount of metallic In, and the high Mg content also brings about negative influence. Our previous work [55] has reported that In has a similar influence as Sn assistant and it was proposed by Shi et al. [50] that Sn in a metallic state (Sn0) may be a poison to propane dehydrogenation reaction. Therefore, overmuch In0 blocking Pt active sites is disadvantageous to the dehydrogenation reaction.

3.6. Effect of Mg/Al molar ratio on metal particle distribution of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts
To determine the effect of Mg/Al ratio on the distribution of metal particles, the TEM images of the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts were carried out. The morphologies and corresponding particle size distributions of different samples are displayed in Fig. 8. The average sizes of metal particles for each sample are listed in Table 5. It is obviously found that PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 exhibits the smallest average particle size of 2.5 nm accompanied with good distribution of Pt particles, which can lead to a promotion on the reduction of Pt particles (discussed in Section 3.5) [50]. Meanwhile, the Pt particle size is significantly smaller than that of the Pt catalysts supported on alumina in our previous works [16], [17]. In summary, the average particle size decreases in the following order: PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 (5.3 nm) > PtIn/Mg(Al)O-8 (3.5 nm) > PtIn/Mg(Al)O-6 (3.0 nm) > PtIn/Mg(Al)O-2 (2.8 nm) > PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 (2.5 nm). It is interesting that low or excessive proportion of Mg addition cannot bring about a satisfied particle distribution and a smaller Pt particle size. These results also suggest that the proportion of Mg can markedly influence metallic particle size and distribution.

The Pt dispersions and TOF values of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts are also summarized in Table 5. It can be seen that PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 catalyst exhibits the lowest Pt dispersion of 16.8%. The metal dispersion firstly increases with the increase of Mg/Al ratio from 2 to 4, and then decreases with the further increase of Mg/Al ratio to 8. The highest Pt dispersion (39.6%) is obtained over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 sample. It can be explained by that suitable Mg/Al ratio may promote the diffusion of Pt species and prevent the agglomeration of Pt particles. However, the overhigh Mg/Al ratio (excessive Mg content) may lead to the formation of blocked Pt particles [54] and give rise to the decrease of Pt dispersion. Moreover, as shown in Table 5, it is easily noted that C3H8 TOF exhibits a similar variation as Pt dispersion with the change of Mg/Al molar ratio. The highest TOF value of 4.6 min−1 is also found for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 sample. Moreover, the minimum of TOF value of 2.3 min−1 is observed for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 catalyst with the lowest Pt dispersion.
3.7. Effect of Mg/Al molar ratio on catalytic performances of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts
Fig. 9 shows the propane conversion and propylene selectivity over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts. From Fig. 9(a), it is found that there is a rise of propane conversion for all the catalysts in the initial several hours and attain the stable value after 8 h reaction, which is usually called as “induction period” and explained in our previous work [55]. There is almost no decline of the catalytic activity for all the catalysts in 12 h propane dehydrogenation reaction. The sample PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 exhibit the lowest catalytic activity among all catalysts, indicating that low Mg/Al ratio is detrimental to propane dehydrogenation reaction. With the increase of Mg/Al ratio, the propane conversion is markedly improved for the samples of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-2 and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4, attaining 57.2% and 61.3% stable propane conversions after reaction for 12 h respectively. It is verified that moderately increasing the Mg/Al ratio of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts is advantageous to the catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation reaction. However, with the further increase of Mg/Al ratio, the catalytic activity evidently decreases to 51.9% and 48.1% for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-6 and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-8, respectively after reaction for 12 h. The results indicate that overhigh Mg/Al ratio suppresses the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

Fig. 9. (a) Propane conversion and (b) propylene selectivity as functions of time for different catalysts (reaction conditions: T = 620 °C; H2:C3H8:Ar (molar ratio) = 7:8:35; WHSV = 3.3 h−1; mcat. = 0.3 g).
The variation of the catalytic performances of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction can be explained as following. Firstly, according to the textural parameters in Table 1, the SBET value firstly increases and attains the largest point for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 sample, and then decreases with the increase of Mg/Al ratio of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts. The higher SBET value leads to the better diffusion and dispersion of Pt particles, more Pt active reaction sites [55] and higher propane conversion. Secondly, as shown in Fig. 3, characteristic peaks of the spinel MgAl2O4 are found for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 sample, but the other four catalysts present periclase (MgO) as the primary crystal phase. The catalysts with different crystalline phases in support may lead to the differences on the catalytic performance. Thirdly, the H2-TPR curves in Fig. 6(b) also verify that more reduced metal sites exist on PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 sample after reduction and XPS analysis reveals that a suitable Mg/Al ratio can stabilize the oxidation state of In, which is favorable to propane dehydrogenation. However, two low or two high Mg/Al ratio triggers the formation of more In0, which may block Pt active sites. Furthermore, the TEM images and CO-chemisorption results show that the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 presents the smallest average metal particle size, the highest Pt dispersion and narrow metal particles distribution among all the samples, which can provide much more active sites with the same Pt content, giving rise to the best catalytic performance.
From Fig. 9(b), it can be seen that the propylene selectivity also increases in the initial 3 h and then keeps stable for 12 h propane dehydrogenation reaction. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 catalyst presents the lowest propylene selectivity varying from 79.6% to 81.2% in 12 h reaction. With the increase of Mg/Al ratio, the propylene selectivities for other catalysts are markedly higher than that of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 catalyst, and stabilize above 94.0%. Also, propylene selectivity has the similar varying trend to propane conversion with respect to the Mg/Al ratio of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts. The catalyst PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 possesses the relatively high propylene selectivity (>95%) among all catalysts. Too high or too low Mg/Al ratio of the catalysts cannot bring about the satisfied propylene selectivity.
Fig. 10 shows the initial (5 min reaction) and final (12 h reaction) major by-product selectivities as a function of Mg/Al molar ratio. For Pt-In/MgAlO-1, the catalyst exhibits the highest by-product selectivity. However, with the continuous increase of Mg/Al ratio from 2 to 8, the selectivities of by-products significantly decrease, suggesting that the side reactions are well restrained. These results are well in accordance with propylene selectivity in Fig. 9(b).

In order to analyze the differences of propylene selectivity, the C3H6-TPD measurement was carried out to examine the interaction of propylene with catalysts. The desorption curves of propylene are displayed in Fig. 11. The interactions between propylene and catalyst surface can be evaluated by the desorption temperature [56]. All samples exhibit two peaks ascribed to the adsorbed C3H6 with different strength. It can be observed that the desorption peaks over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 catalyst are located at 143 °C and 500 °C. As Mg/Al molar ratio increases, compared to PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1, the two desorption peaks of other samples shift to lower temperature. This result gives reason for the lowest propylene selectivity of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 catalyst (about 80%) among all the samples. Moreover, for the peaks at high temperature, PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 sample presents the lowest desorption temperature (462 °C), which is in accordance with the optimal propylene selectivity over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 catalyst. It is owing to that promoting propylene desorption can prevent propylene from converting into higher-order dehydrogenation products which are coke precursors [12]. The NH3-TPD results in Table 2 are well in accord with the C3H6-TPD measurement. From Table 2, the total acidity of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts is weakened with the increase of Mg/Al molar ratio. Also the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 sample presents the lowest strong acidity fraction. The decrease of strong acidity can restrain side reactions and leads to higher propylene selectivity.

Fig. 11. C3H6-TPD profiles of different catalysts.
Coke quantitative analysis of the spent catalysts is clearly summarized in Table 6. It has been reported that coke formation is related to the absorbed behavior of olefin on the active sites of the catalyst and the strong acidity can promote the carbon deposition [21], [54], [57]. From Table 6, it is found that the spent PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 catalyst possesses the highest coke content (9.3%) among all the samples, which is in accord with the propylene selectivity in Fig. 9(b). Meanwhile, for the other four catalysts, the spent PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 presents the slightly lower coke content linked with the optimal propylene selectivity. The results are in good agreement with C3H6-TPD and NH3-TPD results discussed above.

3.8. The reaction–regeneration cycles of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 catalyst
To demonstrate the regenerability of the catalysts, the sample PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 is selected for the reaction–regeneration test with 8 cycles. The results are illustrated in Fig. 12. It can be seen that the propane conversion gradually decreases in each cycle except for the first period due to “induction effect”; while the propylene selectivity varies little at about 95.0% in each cycle period. Also, the decline trend of propane conversion becomes more pronounced in each cycle as reaction–regeneration cycle goes on. At the same time, it is interesting that the initial propane conversion slightly increases. However, the final propane conversion evidently decreases with the cycles of reaction–regeneration. From Fig. 12, after 8 reaction–regeneration cycles, the initial and final propane conversions still attain 66.4% and 43.5% accompanied with the propylene selectivity of about 95%.

Fig. 13 shows the initial and final propylene yields in each cycle. It can be observed that the initial propylene yield doesn’t decrease in the whole 8 cycles. However, the final propylene yield gradually decreases, implying that the deactivation rate of the catalyst increases with dehydrogenation–regeneration cycle. The behavior of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 catalyst during the whole reaction–generation cycles can be linked with the variation of metallic phase [58]. To insight this, the H2-TPR measurements of fresh PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 catalyst and the final sample after 8th cycle are conducted and illustrated in Fig. 14. It can be observed that the H2-TPR signals of the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 catalyst after 8 cycles are markedly weaker than that of fresh one. This sample shows two reduction peaks centered at about 425 °C and 540 °C respectively. The conclusion can be proposed that a large amount of metallic Pt species is stabilized on the support after successive reaction–regeneration cycles and cannot be reduced, and the interactions between Pt and In metals decrease. The similar viewpoint was also reported over PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst by Bocanegra et al. [34].

4. Conclusions
The Mg(Al)O-x materials were synthesized by coprecipitation method and used as the supports of bimetallic PtIn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The Mg/Al molar ratio of the carriers has obvious effect on the structure, properties and catalytic performances of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction. As Mg/Al molar ratio varies, the clear changes of the structural characteristics can be observed through BET, FESEM and XRD measurements. With the suitable Mg/Al molar ratio (4:1), the harmonious acid–base properties, a better distribution of well-dispersed Pt particles with the smallest average size (2.5 nm) can be achieved. Moreover, the appropriate proportion of Mg can promote the reduction of Pt species, stabilize the oxidation state of In and inhibit the coke formation, which are favorable to propane dehydrogenation reaction. The optimal catalytic performances are obtained over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-4 catalyst, which exhibits no deactivation for 12 h continuous running of propane dehydrogenation reaction. After 8 reaction–regeneration cycles, the initial and final propane conversions still attain 66.4% and 43.5% accompanied with the propylene selectivity of about 95%.
