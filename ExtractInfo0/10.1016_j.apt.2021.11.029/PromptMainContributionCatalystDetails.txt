Abstract
Hierarchical structure and surface properties of selective support afford some special effects on the catalytic activity, which could be tuned to achieve improved performance. Herein, using a combination of hydrothermal coprecipitation and thermal processing, we integrated highly-distributed Co3O4 spinel nanospecies on laminated hierarchically structured Al2O3 which could be used as a highly efficient VOCs treatment catalyst. Impressively, compared to Co-free Al2O3 counterpart (SBET = 188.2 m2·g−1), these obtained Co3O4 spinel functionalized catalysts are endowed with adjustable Co loading, optimized Co activity state, and obviously improved hierarchically structural properties (SBET = 274.7 m2·g−1). The microporous and mesoporous structures both existed in the obtained Al2O3, which is beneficial to the heterogeneous catalytic reaction process. The results reveal that the proper Co loading in the hierarchically structured Al2O3 could enable the rational modulation of catalytic activity in the combustion of toluene and exceeds the commercial 5 wt% Pd/C catalyst in the light of total catalytic oxidation ability. This developed heterogeneous Co3O4 compositing hierarchically structured Al2O3 provides a significant potential value for practical VOCs treatment.

1. Introduction
With the long-term emissions of volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in industrial development, seeking effective treatment methods to reduce their harm to the atmospheric environment and human health became very urgent [1], [2]. The emergent environmental demand has catalyzed various advanced environmental treatment techniques to solve and reduce the effect of VOCs [3], [4]. The low-temperature thermal catalytic oxidation treatment using heterogeneous catalysts could enable the efficient and low-energy consumption conversion of VOCs such as toluene into non-toxic carbon dioxide and water [5]. Therefore, the development of a low-cost, high-efficiency, and stable catalyst has been particularly emphasized and become one of the researches focused on the thermal catalytic oxidation of VOCs [6].
Precious metal catalysts (Pt, Pd, Ag, etc.) have exhibited excellent low-temperature catalytic activity in VOCs oxidative elimination treatment [7], [8], but corresponding high cost derived from their scarcity and easy inactivation of noble metals very impede their large-scale industrial production. Transition metal-based heterogeneous catalysts afford large favor for low-cost and high stability in the reaction process [8]. Improving the intrinsic activity of transition metals in the light of active species size and their dispersity on the support to enable the highly efficient catalytic degradation of VOCs became a focus in the synthesis and design of heterogeneous catalysts [9].
Among the various transition metal oxides, Co3O4 spinel oxide as an environmental catalytic material affords high catalytic activity and efficiency, which is not only suitable for VOCs oxidation but also CO/NO oxidation, NOx selection natural reduction, and soot combustion [10], [11], [12]. The excellent catalytic performance of Co3O4 is generally attributed to the high redox performance of Co3+/Co2+ coupling, a large amount of surface acidity, and the existence of oxygen vacancies [13]. The traditional preparation methods may still result in the uneven distribution of active components, low atomic utilization efficiency, and mass transfer efficiency [14], [15]. In order to improve the catalytic activity of cobalt oxides in the VOCs oxidation, many synthetic strategies have been proposed, such as constructing porous structures, forming solid solutions [16], [17], metal doping [8], or derivative structure of titanium ore/hydrotalcite [8], and so on. Using porous support to improve the distribution of active Co3O4 and stabilize the pony-sized Co3O4 through strong metal-support interaction, this might could maximize the catalytic efficiency of Co3O4 active components [18], which is expected to significantly contribute to a lower VOCs degradation temperature.
For the supported Co3O4 catalyst, some corresponding studies revealed that its catalytic activity strongly depends on the particle size and surface dispersibility of the cobalt active species [18], [19]. However, the high temperature-driven degradation process of cobalt precursor will cause metal nanoparticles to agglomerate or even sinter on the support, which will adversely affect its overall catalytic activity [19]. In order to weaken the agglomeration, steps should be taken from the very beginning of catalyst preparation to build smaller cobalt nanospecies. Relevant documents have proved that adding organic compounds (or complexing agents) to the metal precursor solution can effectively prevent the overgrowth of cobalt particles, thereby improving the catalytic performance [20], [21]. On the other hand, some researches revealed the structural character of support in the vapor catalysis also could affect the reaction progress of catalysis, in particular, the 2-dimensional structure would benefit to weakening the diffusion limitation of reactant molecule and thus improving the reaction activity [22]. This inspires that integrating the highly active catalytic species might cause a great improvement for the VOCs catalytic elimination.
Inspired by the above thoughts, we developed a laminated hierarchically structured Al2O3 modified with active Co3O4 spinel nanoparticles through Co-doping and thermal processing tactics as an integrated composite catalyst, which could enable efficient thermal catalytic degradation of toluene. The loading amounts of active Co3O4 spinel nanoparticles in laminated alumina were checked, and the obtained catalysts were characterized and ascertained to identify the physicochemical properties and catalytic activity in toluene degradation using air as oxidants. Besides, the catalytic stability of the optimized catalyst sample was assessed to know their potential in practical application.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and reagents
Al(NO3)3·9H2O (AR) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (k30, PVP) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd, Co(NO3)2·6H2O (AR) was obtained from Energy Chemicals (Shanghai) Co., Ltd, C2H5OH (AR), C7H8 (AR) and C3H6O (AR) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.
2.2. Synthesis of catalysts
Co-modified AlOOH was synthesized and depicted as follows: 260 mg Al(NO3)3·9H2O (0.693 mmol) and 260 mg PVP were dissolved into a mixture containing 10.0 mL ethanol, 10.0 mL H2O, and 5.0 mL acetone, and then 0/0.05/0.15/0.3 mL Co(NO3)2 (0.5 M) solution was added. The resulted mixture was transferred to a stainless-steel autoclave lined with polytetrafluoroethylene, and then subjected to a constant temperature hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C for 24 h. The resulting precipitate was washed twice with ethanol and dried for further use. The above-mentioned dried sample was placed in a tube furnace for calcination at 400 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 1 to 5 °C under air conditions. The obtained cobalt-modified Al2O3 two-dimensional nanosheets with different proportions of Co species was named AlCoxO (x = 0/1/3/6).
2.3. Characterizations
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used under airflow from room temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min on the DSC thermal gravimetric analyzer (NETZSCH STA 449F3, Germany).
The XRD results were collected using a Smartlab TM 9 KW (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
The structural properties were measured with N2 (77.4 K) adsorption-desorption on a BELSORP-MINI volume adsorption analyzer (BEL Japan, Osaka, Japan). Before the operation, the sample was vacuum degassed at 150 °C for 4 h. Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) and NLDFT methods were used to calculate the specific surface area and pore size distribution, respectively.
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were collected on a Hitachi S4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).
The transmission electron microscope (TEM) was operated on a JEM-2010 EX microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were collected on Bruker VECTOR22 resolution (Bruker, Bruker, Germany).
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded on a PHI 5000 Versa probe X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ULVAC-PHI, Kanagawa, Japan). The C1s core level of 284.6 eV was utilized as the standard reference.
The metal content was checked by PE Optima 2000DV (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) Inductively Coupling Plasma Emission Spectrometer (ICP).
The hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) measurement was conducted from room temperature to 800 °C using a fixed bed reactor, with a 10% H2/Ar atmosphere flow and a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Before the measurement, the sample was purified by flowing 30 mL min−1 argon at 300 °C for 1 h and then cooled to room temperature.
2.4. Measurement of adsorption isotherms of toluene vapor
Before the analysis, all tested samples were subjected to vacuum degassing pretreatment at a temperature of 150 °C for 6 h. Then, the samples were measured by using the Belsorp Vapor Pretreatment instrument (MicrotracBEL Corporation, Japan). The static volumetric method was used to determine the adsorption isotherms of benzene and toluene saturated vapor(>99%) over series samples at 25 °C. The operation temperature was controlled by using a thermostatic water bath. VOCs steam is generated from stainless steel Chambers with thermostatic seals and automatic air shutoff valves. The sample was placed in a circulating water bath at the characteristic test temperature.
2.5. Catalytic performance assessment of toluene combustion
The pre-treatment of the applied catalyst: The cobalt-based catalyst applied for catalytic oxidation of toluene was pressed into tablets and ensuingly sieved through 40–60 meshes, and 0.1 g of the treated catalyst was placed into a fixed-bed quartz reaction tube.
Catalytic combustion of toluene reaction: catalytic activity is evaluated in a tubular fixed bed reactor system connected to an online gas chromatograph (GC), which is equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and KB-1 column. Before the reaction, air with a flow rate of 91 mL/min was introduced to purge impurities in the overall gas path of the fixed bed reactor; then the toluene was entrained with a flow rate of 9 mL/min airflow to bubble the toluene solution at 0 °C. The continuous catalytic oxidation of toluene is carried out under the programmed temperature of 180–450 °C. The reaction gas mixture (1000 ppm toluene steam balanced with air) is blasted from the bubbling device under the zero-degree constant temperature water bath, and the calculated space velocity is 60000 mL/(g·h).
The conversion rate of toluene (Xtoluene) at different temperatures is calculated according to the following formula:
Among them, Ctoluene, In is the concentration of toluene at the inlet, and Ctoluene, Out is the tested concentration of toluene at the outlet.
The calculation of catalytic reaction kinetics: To better understand the thermal catalytic removal of toluene, the kinetics of the composite catalyst were checked. Generally, the reaction process of catalytic oxidation conforms to the first-order reaction kinetics. The following formula can be used to calculate the activation energy (Ea) of different catalysts for activity evaluation.
Among them, x is the conversion rate of the reactant toluene, k is the reaction rate constant at a certain temperature; V and W are the volumetric flow rate of the gas and the feed amount of the catalyst, respectively. When the gas volume flow rate is 9 mL/min and the catalyst feed rate is 0.1 g, the conversion rate x at different temperatures can be measured, and k can be further calculated. According to the Arrhenius formula, the relationship between lnk and 1/T is obtained, and the different slopes -Ea/R are obtained by linear fitting, and the activation energy of different catalysts can be calculated.
3. Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1, this work applied a simple hydrothermal method to synthesize a cobalt-modified sample Co-AlOOH, and then calcined at a high temperature (400 °C) to ensure the complete oxidation of metal precursor to gain the final Al2O3 catalyst, wherein the loading of Co species was enabled through controlling the addition of Co precursor. The catalyst prepared by this approach was endowed with a two-dimensional stacked sheet structure, which is conducive to the effective contact of toluene molecules with the highly-dispersed cobalt active species located on the Al2O3 support, thereby benefiting to improve the poor surface contact and big diffusion limitation when gaseous molecules cross the filled catalyst layer. Before the characterization of the obtained series samples, the obtained Co-free AlOOH sample was checked using TG-DTA measurements under air condition, which indicates the PVP degradation mainly occurred at 360 °C (Fig. 1S). Therefore, the PVP can be completely removed through a 400 °C high-temperature treatment.

Fig. 2 shows the obtained powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the composite catalysts before and after the calcination. Specifically, the series catalysts before calcination treatment exhibit the featured diffraction peaks which are consisted of AlO(OH) (JCPDS no. 21-1307) and Al(OH)3 (JCPDS no. 38-0376), revealing the coexistence of two kinds of alumina species including AlO(OH) and Al(OH)3 [23]. In the meantime, the diffraction of Co species was found and indexed to Co(OH)2 (JCPDS no. 51-1731) in the uncalcined samples, revealing the Co atoms fail to dop into the AlO(OH) but hydrolyze to form hydroxides. After undergoing the calcination treatment, the main phase of the catalyst was transformed into γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS no. 10-0425), besides, the Co species confined in alumina becomes Co3O4 spinel (JCPDS no. 42-1467), which evidenced by the presence of diffraction of Co3O4 spinel. Note that only weak diffraction peaks of Co3O4 in the composite catalyst are identified, which reveals the low-crystalline degree and high dispersity of Co species in alumina. In addition, the collected results of the plasma inductive coupling/emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) test showed that the molar ratio of the active cobalt species in the samples AlCo1O, AlCo3O, and AlCo6O was close to 1:3:6 (Table 1), which conforms to the Co dosage added in the sample preparation process.

Fig. 3(a-f) depicts the scanning electron micrographs of the series of Co-modified catalysts before and after the calcination, and Fig. 3(g-i) further shows the transmission electron micrographs of the optimal catalyst AlCo3O. The collected electron microscopy results reveal that all the catalysts have a microstructure of two-dimensional nanoflakes laminated structure which is beneficial to weaken the internal diffusion effect in the traditional catalytic reaction process, and facilitate the direct contact between reactant molecules and active catalytic species, thereby promoting the progress of the catalytic reaction compared to those affording limited pore character. In detail, the flaky structure of the AlCo1O catalyst is the most obvious, but this lamellar structure of alumina has certain damage and fragmentation with the gradual increase of the cobalt loading content. The lamellar structure and shape of the sample AlCo6O are very irregular, which may be the result of the introduced cobalt species disturbing the self-assembly of AlO(OH) during the hydrothermal synthesis. In the contrast, Co-free AlOOH sample was checked for TEM image (Fig. S2), the pure AlOOH affords the broken sheet morphology and smaller size differing from the Co-bearing sample in spite of the absence of Co introduction, which indicates the influence of implanting Co on the laminated configuration AlOOH. The TEM image of the sample AlCo3O further shows that the flake structure of alumina can be well maintained, and bulky aggregated Co3O4 species are invisible on the flaky alumina (Fig. 3(g, h, i)), indicating the active Co3O4 species can be uniformly distributed on the support with small size state, which may lead to a rational improvement in catalytic performance. To further observe the distribution of Co species on the alumina, elemental mapping information of Al, O, and Co was collected and shown in Fig. 3j, especially, the observed Co elemental distribution is uniform on the selected area of alumina, thereby confirming the high dispersity and existence of Co3O4 on the alumina. Besides, the higher magnification TEM image of AlCo3O was collected to observe the morphology and state of formed Co3O4 in the calcined samples. Specifically, the Co3O4 particle can be observed and indexed into a corresponding spinel configuration with small size (Fig. S3). This result well verifies the loading and modification of Co species on the alumina through the hydrothermal and annealing approach.

Fig. 4(a, b) shows the nitrogen isothermal adsorption and desorption curves of the series of comparative catalysts before and after calcination, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method is applied to calculate the specific surface area of the samples. Table 1 summarizes the detailed textural properties of the series of catalysts. It can be known that the specific surface area of AlOOH obtained by the hydrothermal method is 101.14 m2/g, which indicates that the original catalyst carrier has good surface structure properties. In the meantime, the high-temperature calcination makes the specific surface area of all catalysts be further enlarged nearly twice. This should be explained that the PVP was degraded, which renders the formation of more voids and partial porous structure in the materials. Thus, impressively, the structural properties of the three cobalt-modified catalysts after the calcination are also further improved compared to pure alumina, but as the cobalt loading content increases, the SBET and Vtotal of the catalysts afford a certain descend owing to the emerged cobalt species destroying the two-dimensional structure of alumina.

Fig. 4. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and NLDFT pore size distribution of the uncalcined (a, c) and calcined (b, d) cobalt-modified catalysts.
Fig. 4(a, b) shows that the obtained curve presents a type IV adsorption isotherm (according to the IUPAC classification) with a hysteresis loop of H3 in the high-pressure zone [23]. The series of catalysts obtained before and after calcination has a typical stacked mesoporous structure character. The N2 adsorbed capacity of materials gradually decreases especially in the high-pressure region with the increasing cobalt loading content, which could be attributed to descend of packed voids of laminated space of alumina. The pore size analysis diagram of all samples shows the range of main pore size distribution located in 0.5–6 nm (Fig. 4c, d). Note that the newly-emerged pore size distribution region at ∼0.63 nm was observed for the calcined samples, which should be resulted from the formation of more and smaller broken voids of alumina nanosheet after degrading the PVP precursor. The Enlarged N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the uncalcined and calcined cobalt-modified catalysts in the range of 0–0.1 P/P0 were further provided in Fig. S4(a, b). The obvious increase of adsorption volume around P/P0 = 0 can be observed for the calcined cobalt-modified catalysts, which can be attributed to the formed micropore adsorption behavior of N2 in the catalyst and further validate the formed broken microporous voids. Correspondingly, we identified that the calculated surface area of all the calcined samples affords a remarkable increment compared to that of uncalcined ones. Specifically, the surface area of AlOOH was increased to 188.2 m2/g from the initial 101.1 m2/g, while the surface areas of AlxCoO are enlarged to 250–280 m2/g from the initial ca. 105 m2/g. This observed phenomenon is closely associated with the formation of newly broken voids because the other existing pores hardly show large variation before and after calcination. We suggest that the post-formed broken voids on the surface of alumina could further benefit the cross-diffusion of reaction molecules during the reaction process, thereby better for the contact of reactant and active species on the catalyst surface.
FTIR is an important technique for ascertaining the composition information of materials. The FTIR spectra of all the samples before and after calcination are shown in Fig. 5(a, b). It can be known that the uncalcined series of Co-AlOOH samples afford two peaks at 3297 cm−1 and 3091 cm−1 belonging to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the (Al)OH group [24], respectively, revealing the specified AlOOH and Al(OH)3 structure. The absorption peak at 2920 cm−1 is observed and indexed into CH2 moieties of surfactant PVP and another strong band at 1712 cm−1 is attributed to the CO groups in the carboxylic acid, notably the absorption bands at these two positions disappear after the calcination indicating the efficient removal of PVP molecule [23]. The absorption peak at 1639 cm−1 corresponding to the adsorption of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface became weakened after the calcination, indicating partial losing of surface hydroxyl groups. These three characteristic peaks at 762, 641, and 480 cm−1 are identified and belong to the specific vibration modes of AlO [25], [26]. The disappearance of the characteristic AlOH peak at 1070 cm−1 and the changing AlO bonds in the range of low-wavenumbers from three adsorption bands to two adsorption bands indicate that the vibrations mode of the main phase in the catalyst has transformed from AlOOH to Al2O3 [25]. Apart from that, a weak absorption band at 1109 cm−1 existed in the IR spectra of Al3CoO and Al6CoO which might originate from the vibration modes of CoO in the relatively high Co loading samples [27].

The UV–vis diffuse reflectance can be applied to study the oxidation state, coordination state, coordination symmetry, etc. of transition metals in the catalyst, and corresponding results are shown in Fig. 6(a, b). The two unmodified catalysts AlOOH and Al2O3 only have a slight absorption around 200 nm. The absorption peaks around 200 nm and 270 nm correspond to the charge transfer from O2− to Al3+ in the catalyst, and the intensity of the absorption peak increases significantly after calcination. The obvious multiple overlapped absorption peaks at 500–640 nm are observed and correspond to the 4A2(F) → 4T1(P) transition of cobalt species with tetrahedral configuration and partial Co(III) species in the cobalt-modified catalyst compared to the AlCo0O [28]. But note that two sets of new peaks at ca. 450 nm and ca. 670 nm are observed for AlCo3O and AlCo6O and indexed to the featured absorbance bands of O → Co(III) attributed to Co3O4 species on the alumina [29]. In the meantime, the observed attributed peaks afford an obvious shift in terms of comparative samples of AlCo3O and AlCo6O which might derive from the strong interaction between Co3O4 species and alumina to a different extent. This result suggests that the higher loading of Co species in AlCo3O and AlCo6O leads to the formation of spinel Co3O4 species on the surface of alumina.

H2-TPR is generally applied for measuring the redox properties of the catalyst, which could provide information on metal size, chemical state, and interaction between metal and support. As shown in Fig. 7, we collected the redox properties of the calcined series of cobalt-modified alumina catalysts through H2-TPR experiments. It can be found that except for Co-free Al2O3, the other cobalt-modified catalysts all have obvious multiple reduction peaks. Regarding the AlCo1O sample, only a set of reduction peaks at 250–500 °C were observed. In the conjunction with DRUV–vis results concerning the existence of the Co2+ in a tetrahedral environment and partial Co(III) species, we attribute the appeared three peaks to the reduction of partial Co(III) species and cluster-like Co(II) species that weakly interacted with the alumina. This result indicates the Co species in the pony-size state rather than the bulky Co3O4 particle on the alumina in a low loading, which agrees with wide-angle XRD results. However, for higher Co loading AlCo3O and AlCo6O, the first reduction peak at a lower reduction temperature (around 300 °C) can be attributed to the reduction of Co(III) to Co(II) species [30], and as the cobalt loading increases, the reduction peak gradually shifts to the low-temperature region. Compared to the AlCo0O, all the Co-bearing catalysts show several multiple reduction peaks before the 500 °C reduction temperature, which can be attributed to the reduction of Co(III) species to Co(II) species. Notably, a typical reduction peak at 533 °C for AlCo3O is observed and explained by the existed highly-dispersed Co(II) interacted with alumina with the relatively bigger size [31]. Other reduction peaks at 680 and 657 °C observed in the curves of AlCo6O are identified and indexed to the reduction of Co(II) to Co species strongly interacted with alumina in a bulky particle state [31]. Compared to that of AlCo6O, the appeared reduction peak of AlCo6O at 684 °C is obviously weaker, while the corresponding reduction peak attributed to highly-dispersed Co(II) might contribute to the better activity for the reaction [32]. Particularly, the great catalytic activity of Co3O4 spinel on account of its weaker CoO bond and higher oxygen-binding rate.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to further identify the detailed variation of the surface atomic composition and electronic state of an element in the sample AlCo3O (Fig. 8). The elemental survey confirms the main components of constructed elements in the AlCo3O including Al, O, and Co. Only one dominant peak can be identified in the respective XPS spectra of the Al 2p core level. The central peak of Al 2p at 74.8 eV belongs to Al3+ which indicates the dominated skeletal Al atoms of Al2O3, and the center of O 1s at 531.6 eV was identified and attributed to the AlO group (lattice oxygen) [33]. In the meantime, two weak peaks located at 533.5 eV and 530.2 eV were deconvoluted and indexed into AlOH (adsorbed oxygen) on the surface of the catalyst and CoO bond derived from the resultant Co3O4 spinel species [34]. This indicates the Co species mainly existed as oxides on the surface of alumina, which hardly affects the coordination environment of Al species. on the other hand, the Co2p core level was deconvoluted into two Co states including Co(II) and Co(III) species, which is typical evidence favoring the existence of Co3O4 spinel on the surface of alumina. These mixed valances of Co species in the sample benefit the electron transfer of the Co2+–Co3+ cycle which could improve the reaction performance.

4. Performance assessment
To further identify the effect of toluene adsorption on the catalyst and superiority origin of catalytic activity, all the samples were applied for the toluene static adsorption test. Fig. 9 shows the adsorption isotherms of the series of catalysts to toluene at 25 °C after calcination. It can be clearly seen that the adsorption capacity of the catalyst to toluene gradually increases as the increased relative pressure. At the same time, compared to the sample Co-free AlCo0O, the three catalysts modified by cobalt have a certain increase in the adsorption capacity of toluene. Judging from the N2 adsorption results, the pore volume of cobalt modified alumina is obviously inferior to that of Co-free AlCo0O, which generally affect directly the adsorption capacity of materials. But the surface area of AlCo1O, AlCo3O, and AlCo6O reach 284.59 m2/g, 274.67 m2/g, and 250.65 m2/g, which is obviously higher than that of AlCo0O. This is because the introduced active Co species make the structure be improved and correspondingly provide more chemical adsorption sites such as Co3O4 for toluene molecules through chemical adsorption interaction, which improves the catalytic performance of toluene. However, note that AlCo1O only shows slightly increased adsorption of toluene despite the structural properties of AlCo1O exceeding that of AlCo3O and AlCo6O.

The catalytic performance results for toluene combustion of the prepared AlCoxO series catalysts are shown in Fig. 10, and all the catalytic performance results for toluene degradation over the calcined series catalysts and commercial precious metal catalysts 5% Pd/C were collected at different temperatures (180–450 °C). Notably, AlCo3O exhibits the best low-temperature catalytic activity among all catalysts in the light of total oxidation of toluene, and the flowing toluene mixture gas could be completely degraded at 330 °C, which is comparable to that of noble metal catalysts (the conversion rate of toluene over 5% Pd/C at 330 °C is 90%). Therefore, potentially, AlCo3O can be used as an effective replacement for precious metal catalysts in terms of the present catalytic performance. Besides, the comparison between the optimal AlCo3O and reported works for various transition metal-based catalysts was conducted, Table 2 reveals the obtained AlCo3O affords the obvious superiority for toluene combustion in the light of the applied reaction airspeed and temperature of toluene complete combustion. This highlights that the obtained catalyst has a large potential for practical VOCs catalytic elimination. Combining the above series of characterization results, it can be included that the structure and morphology of AlCo3O and active Co3O4 active species afford certain superiority in the reaction process. Besides, we suggest the present laminated construction could make the gaseous toluene more easily diffuse across the catalyst layer in the reactor because the voids produced among the packing catalysts are bigger compared to those small particle catalysts, thus was endowed with better contact and weakening diffusion resistance (Fig. 11).

Fig. 11. Description of the superiority of laminated construction for the reaction.
Specifically, the laminated hierarchically structured character of catalyst was regarded to be beneficial to the catalytic reaction process. Especially, more active sites could be exposed on the surface of the sheet-like hierarchical structure of support, while a large agglomerated morphology with fewer active centers is unfavorable. Notably, compared to the AlCo1O and AlCo6O, the higher catalytic activity of AlCo3O should be emphasized in the light of two aspects that active species content and their corresponding specific states on the carrier. First, the AlCo3O affords higher Co concentration on the Al2O3 surface compared to AlCo1O, thus could contribute to more reactive sites for adsorbing and activating the toluene molecule. Thereby, despite a greater structural property for AlCo1O being attained, the resulting catalytic activity of AlCo1O was still inferior to that of AlCo3O owing to its lower Co loading. On the other hand, the AlCo6O still affords lower catalytic toluene combustion activity in a higher Co loading concentration. In the conjunction with the characterizations, we suggest the active Co3O4 show the differential state on the surface of plate Al2O3. Especially, the redox state of Co species derived from the H2-TPR results reveals the AlCo3O catalyst afford modest redox ability compared to AlCo1O and AlCo6O, which might be the crucial active species in the toluene combustion.
In addition, the ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance results demonstrated the interaction between the cobalt active species and the support in the catalyst AlCo3O, which is confirmed by the H2-TPR and XPS results. This interaction is beneficial to improve the intrinsic activity of metal oxide supported on the catalyst. It can also be found that, for all the tested samples, the conversion of Pd/C to toluene affords the faster reaction rate after 210 °C reaction temperature compared to catalyst samples, and reached more than 50% toluene conversion at 270 °C. However, note that the temperature at which toluene is completely degraded is slightly lower than AlCo3O. This may be due to the good low-temperature catalytic activity of noble metal catalysts. The rest of the comparative catalysts have low catalytic activity at 270 °C, and the conversion rate of toluene is less than 20%, and the performance gradually increases only after 300 °C. In addition, we can also note that the modification of different contents of cobalt species has improved the catalytic performance of the original AlCo0O catalyst (e.g. Al2O3) to a different extent, revealing that the implanting Co contributing to the optimized catalytic activity compared to the pure Al2O3. In general, the activity trend of the series of catalysts is depicted as follows: AlCo3O > AlCo6O > AlCo1O > AlCo0O. Therefore, we can incline that only the modification of the carrier by the proper loading of active species can exert its greatest effect.
The catalytic activity stability is the important factor for evaluating the applicable catalyst [44], [45], [46], [47]. Fig. 10(b) depicts the test curve of the catalytic stability of the AlCo3O catalyst for the catalytic oxidation of toluene at T100. The results show that the toluene conversion rate of more than 98% is well maintained within 25 h, indicating that the AlCo3O catalyst has excellent catalytic stability. Despite the slight decrease in the conversion rate after 6 h may be because the active metal happens to reconstruct which affects the slight reactive properties. After 20 h of reaction time, the performance returned to a relatively stable state, but the conversion rate showed a downward trend again after 25 h of testing. This similar situation has been reported in the relevant literature. Although the magnitude of the change is not large, it is also a cyclical process.
In addition, we can also evaluate the activity of the catalyst by comparing the apparent activation energy (Ea) value. The lower activation energy of the sample indicates better activity. When the toluene catalytic combustion reaction is controlled within the dynamic range (toluene conversion rate <20%), the slope of the Arrhenius curve is used to evaluate the value of Ea. According to the slope of the Arrhenius curve, the Ea value of the catalyst can be calculated. The fitting result is shown in Fig. 10(c). The changing trend of the activation energy of all catalysts is depicted as follows: Pd/C (31.1 kJ/mol) < AlCo3O (36.2 kJ) /mol) < AlCo6O (38.6 kJ/mol) < AlCo1O (49.5 kJ/mol) < AlCo0O (56.8 kJ/mol). As a precious metal catalyst, Pd/C has the smallest activation energy due to its good low-temperature catalytic activity. Except for the precious metal catalyst, the other results are inversely proportional to the changing trend of the catalyst performance we obtained above, which further verifies that the AlCo3O in the series of catalysts has the best catalytic combustion activity for toluene.
5. Conclusions
In summary, we successfully constructed concentration-controlled Co3O4 spinel modified hierarchically-structured alumina using the combined synthesized approaches of hydrothermal and thermal processing treatment, which can be used as a superior catalyst in the efficient VOCs catalytic treatment. Impressively, the obtained materials afford appreciable laminated structures endowed with microporous and mesoporous characters together. The formed Co3O4 nanospecies were highly dispersed on the laminated alumina, which exhibits the great advantage of exposed active centers. Besides, we demonstrated that modification of cobalt species in the laminated alumina makes the structural properties of alumina be improved to great extent, which is beneficial to the catalytic process of toluene combustion. More importantly, the obtained industrial catalyst shows long-standing catalytic activity in the toluene combustion. Taken together, the developed Co3O4 spinel modified hierarchically-structured alumina exhibited great potential in the VOCs' environmental catalytic elimination.
