Based on my review, the provided document does not contain any discussion related to propane dehydrogenation or the conversion of propane to propylene. The document focuses on process intensification strategies in general, without mentioning any specific processes or catalysts relevant to propane dehydrogenation. Therefore, I do not believe this document is relevant for extracting details on scientific contributions to propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
