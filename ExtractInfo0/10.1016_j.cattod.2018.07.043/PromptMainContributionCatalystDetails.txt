Promotion of Pd nanoparticles by Fe and formation of a Pd3Fe intermetallic alloy for propane dehydrogenation
Highlights
•
2 nm Pd nanoparticles have low selectivity and rapid deactivation for propane dehydrogenation due to Pd carbide formation.
•
2 nm Pd3Fe intermetallic nanoparticles have high olefin selectivity and do not be form carbides, thus deactivate more slowly.
•
Pd3Fe shows higher selectivity and stability, which is due to smaller Pd ensembles separated by inactive Fe atoms.
•
Changes in the energy of the filled and unfilled Pd 4d orbitals in Pd3Fe are suggested by Pd L3 edge XANES.
1. Introduction
Light hydrocarbons, such as ethane, propane and butane, are abundantly distributed in shale natural gas, and can be used for production of fuels and chemicals through dehydrogenation, oligomerization and other functionalization reactions [1,2]. There are two major types of alkane dehydrogenation catalysts: Pt-based bimetallics and CrOx. The former has higher activity, moderate selectivity and stability [3,4]; while the latter has higher selectivity, but is poorly active and stable [1,5,6]. Other noble metal catalysts, for example Pd, are poorly selective with high yield of methane, and they rapidly deactivate due to coke formation. It has long been known that the addition of promoter significantly enhances the performance of Pt catalysts. Addition of an inert second metal such as Sn, Ga, Zn or In enhances the selectivity as well as activity [4,[7], [8], [9], [10], [11]]. Many studies have suggested geometric and electronic effects are decisive for high selectivity in promoted Pt dehydrogenation catalysts [2,3,12,13,14,15]. Most often, the electronic effects by the promotor metal atoms are considered to be responsible for the improved selectivity of the catalysts [16,17]. Recently, with the help of using synchrotron X-ray diffraction to determine the alloy structure in dehydrogenation catalysts, it has been suggested that a geometric effect, i.e., isolation of active site by the second metal, is the primary reason for the enhancement of selectivity and suppression of the structural-sensitive CC hydrogenolysis and coking reactions. For example, improved dehydrogenation performances have been demonstrated for the AuCu type intermetallics β1PdZn, Pt1Zn1, CsCl type PdIn, and Cu3Au type Pt3In [[18], [19], [20]]. In addition, a recent resonant inelastic X-ray scattering study on Pt1Zn1 intermetallic alloy showed that the energy of the filled Pt valence 5d orbitals decrease and the energy of the unfilled Pt 5d orbitals increase upon bonding with Zn [18]. Thus, the dominant electronic effect was a change in the energy of the filled and unfilled 5d orbitals, rather than a change in the number of electrons as is generally suggested in the Pt-Sn catalysts [19,21,23]. Lowering of the energy of the filled Pt 5d valence orbitals results in the decrease of Pt-adsorbate bond energy leading to a decrease in the metal adsorbate bond energy and reactant surface coverage.
In this manuscript Pd and Pd3Fe intermetallic alloy nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared and tested for propane dehydrogenation. The Pd3Fe catalyst has higher selectivity for production of olefins with improved stability compared with Pd NPs of the same size. The catalysts were characterized by Pd K-edge and L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), Infrared (IR) spectroscopy of adsorbed CO and Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). In the Pd3Fe catalyst, the Pd ensembles are broken by inactive Fe atoms, which is believed to be the primary reason for the improved selectivity and stability. Moreover, the changes in Pd L edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) suggest changes in the electronic structures; however, these are not likely large enough to account for the large change in dehydrogenation selectivity.
2. Results
The Pd catalyst was synthesized by strong electrostatic adsorption and Pd3Fe catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation as described in the experimental section of supplemental information (SI). As can be seen in the STEM images, Fig. 1, NPs with average size of 1.7 nm were obtained in the Pd catalyst prepared by strong electrostatic adsorption of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 on SiO2 in strongly basic pH with NH4OH. For the Pd3Fe catalyst, Fe was firstly added to silica by impregnation of Fe(NO3)3·xH2O with citric acid. Addition of NH4OH to the Fe(NO3)3 solution leads to precipitation of iron hydroxide-oxide, which is not suitable for impregnation. However, addition of citric acid prior to addition of NH4OH leads to a clear Fe-citrate complex, which can be impregnated on silica to get Fe/SiO2 with uniform dispersion. Subsequent impregnation of a basic solution of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 on Fe/SiO2 gives NPs with an average size of 1.9 nm. Under identical conditions, impregnation of Pd(NH3)4Cl2 on Fe-SiO2 leads to large NP’s with an average size of 12 nm (Figure S1). The presence of Cl on the catalyst appears to give significantly larger NPs than that without Cl.

The catalysts were characterized by in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. After reduction in H2, the X-ray absorption near edge spectra (XANES) at Pd K edge (24,350 eV) indicates that the shape as well as the edge energy and white line intensity of the three samples are similar, indicating Pd is fully reduced to metallic in all samples (Figure S2). Small changes in the shape of the XANES of the Pd3Fe catalysts compared to Pd suggest that bimetallic NPs form. The magnitudes and imaginary parts of the k2-weighted extended X-ray absorption spectra (EXAFS) are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a and c show spectra characteristic of metallic Pd NP, while those of the Pd3Fe catalysts shown in Fig. 2b and d are significantly different. The EXAFS spectra of Pd3Fe show scattering from metallic Fe as well as Pd. The Pd K edge EXAFS of Pd3Fe_large is very similar to that of the small particle except that the intensity of the magnitude of the FT-EXAFS is higher (Fig. 3) consistent with a larger particle size. The EXAFS, both magnitude and imaginary part, of the FT-EXAFS were fit and the results are given in Table 1. The quality of the fits is shown in Fig. 2. The coordination number of the Pd catalyst is 6.6 and the Pd-Pd bond length is 2.75 Å, consistent with small metallic Pd NPs. Estimating the NP size from the coordination numbers gives an approximate size of 1.9 nm consistent with the STEM results [25].

In the Pd3Fe catalysts, the fits were poor using only Pd-Pd scattering. Addition of a Pd-Fe scattering path gave good fits. The Pd-Pd distance was shorter than in the Pd NP despite the similar size. The Pd-Fe bond distance was about 2.62 Å, which is about the sum of the radii of metallic Pd and Fe, i.e. (2.75 + 2.48)/2 = 2.615 Å. The ratio of the coordination number of Pd-Pd to Pd-Fe was approximately 2 for both Pd3Fe catalysts, which is in line with that of the crystal structure of Pd3Fe (Fig. 4). The Fe K-edge (7112 eV) XANES of the Pd3Fe catalyst (Figure S3a and S3b) indicates that most of the Fe is present in the Fe(II) oxidation state [24,26]. In our previous studies, Fe(II)/SiO2 shows much lower (two orders magnitude) dehydrogenation activity under our reaction conditions, so the unreduced Fe present in the bimetallic Pd3Fe catalyst should be considered as inactive [24]. The EXAFS indicates that much of the Fe has O bonds. There is a small higher shell peak between about 2–3 Å (uncorrected distance) in the magnitude of the FT-EXAFS. The small size of the peak and the potential overlap with FeOFe bonds from Fe oxide, prevented fitting of Fe-Pd scattering in the alloy. In summary, the XAS results indicate the formation of bimetallic Pd-Fe NPs; however, EXAFS is a local characterization and does not determine the crystal structure. To investigate the crystal phase of the NPs, diffraction is needed.

In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been previously shown to be possible on NPs with 2 nm size [4,13,27]. The XRD patterns of Pd and Pd3Fe catalysts along with the simulated patterns of bulk Pd and Pd3Fe phases are shown in Fig. 5. The peaks for both Pd3Fe and Pd catalysts are broad, consistent with their small particle sizes. For the Pd catalyst, the position of maximum peak is observed at 3.01°, corresponding to the simulated Pd (111) peak, which indicates the Pd species is monometallic. The (200) peak, however, merges into the (111) peak due to the small particle size [27]. Also distorted are the peaks at higher 2-thetas. The XRD pattern of Pd3Fe is similar to Pd except for several minor peaks and a small shift in the peak position (as can be seen from the simulated pattern in Fig. 5). Fig. 5 also shows the XRD peaks of the larger (about 12 nm) Pd3Fe catalyst. With the larger size, sharp diffraction peaks are recorded and precise peak shifts can be determined. The peaks are shifted compared to monometallic Pd and the position of the (111), (200) and (220) peaks are 3.04, 3.50 and 4.96°, respectively, which corresponds to the simulated pattern of Cu3Au type Pd3Fe intermetallic phase. Even the small superlattice peaks characteristic of the Pd3Fe phase are visible at 2θ of 2.49, 3.92 and 6.99°, which confirms the Pd3Fe phase in the sample. From the peak positions of the XRD, the unit cell size was determined for the Pd and the two Pd3Fe NPs. The results and corresponding particle sizes are shown in Table 2. The lattice parameter decreases from 3.865 Å in Pd catalyst to 3.826 Å in Pd3Fe catalyst, in line with the decrease in the lattice upon alloying with Fe. Moreover, a slight increase of the lattice parameter from 3.826 to 3.835 between Pd3Fe and Pd3Fe_large catalysts also agrees with the size effect, where the contraction of lattice is observed when the particle size decreases below 30 Å [25]. Therefore, along with the results obtained from XAS where both Pd3Fe samples have the same ratio of CN of Pd-Pd to Pd-Fe paths as 2, confirm the phases in both samples as Pd3Fe.

In situ IR spectra of chemisorbed CO on Pd and Pd3Fe catalysts are shown in Fig. 6. As is well studied, the vibration band between 1700 cm−1 and 2000 cm−1 represents the bridge bonded CO while the vibration band between 2150 cm−1 and 2050 cm−1 represent the linearly bonded CO. For the monometallic Pd sample, the bridge-bonded broad band between 2000 cm−1 and 1700 cm−1 is the largest peak. The ratio of peak areas of Pd (bridge-to-linear ratio) is 6.7, consistent with previous studies of small Pd (2 nm) catalysts, Fig. 6a [3,13]. After alloying with Fe, the IR spectrum of absorbed CO shows predominantly linear-bonded bands between 2050 cm−1 and 2150 cm−1 with bridge-to-linear ratio of 0.9, Fig. 6c. The IR spectrum of CO adsorbed Pd3Fe_large also shows predominantly linear-bonded CO with a similar bridge-to-linear ratio as shown in Table 3 and Fig. 6b [22]. Because of the larger size of the latter catalyst, the noise in the absorption band between 2000 cm−1 and 1900 cm−1 originates from the low CO uptake. In addition to a shift from bridge to linear bonded CO in the diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), there is a change in the type of bridge bonded CO. The band centered about 1850 cm−1 in the Pd catalyst, which represents the 3-fold hollow site [31] is completely absent in the Pd3Fe NP’s. For the latter, there is bridge bonded−CO occurs at about 1950 cm−1 [32]. Thus, in both Pd3Fe catalysts the IR spectra indicate there are few 3-fold Pd ensembles remaining.

Electronic effects are often thought to be essential to the promotion of high selectivity in Pt dehydrogenation catalysts [33,34]. For Pd, one generally measures the K-edge XANES spectra, which is the 1 s to 5p transition. However, the unfilled 5p orbitals have higher energy than the valence 4d orbitals, and thus the K-edge XANES are not indicative of the electronic changes in Pd that are responsible for the catalytic properties. The Pd L-edge XANES spectra (2p to 4d orbital transition) are sensitive to the energy and provide information of the energy of the valence 4d orbital. Fig. 7a and b show the Pd L3 and L2 XANES, respectively, for the Pd and Pd3Fe catalysts. The L3 edge energy of Pd3Fe (3173.8 eV) is 0.2 eV higher in energy than Pd (3173.6 eV). There is a larger shift of edge position, 0.5 eV, in Pd3Fe_large NP’s (3174.3 eV) compared to small Pd NP’s [35]. Similarly, at the L2 edge, the XANES energy of Pd is 3330.6 eV, and Pd3Fe and Pd3Fe_large are 3331.0 and 3331.2 eV, respectively, suggesting an increase in energy of the Pd unfilled 4d states upon alloying with Fe.

The catalysts were then tested at 1 atm and 510 °C in a mixture of 1.5% H2, 1.5% C3H8 and 97% Ar for propane dehydrogenation. To test the dehydrogenation selectivity under sever reaction conditions, H2 was co-fed to promote the hydrogenolysis side reaction. The C3H6 selectivity was greatly enhanced after alloying Pd with Fe. At the C3H8 conversion of 10%, the Pd catalyst showed a C3H6 selectivity of about 45%, while the Pd3Fe and Pd3Fe_large catalysts each showed an overall C3H6 selectivity of 94% and 80%. At a higher conversion of 20%, the Pd3Fe catalyst had a C3H6 selectivity of 85%; while Pd decreased to 32% (Fig. 8 and S5). The side products are methane, ethane, ethylene and coke. The Pd3Fe and Pd3Fe_large catalysts each shows initial TOR as 0.2 and 0.3 s−1, while Pd catalyst shows an initial TOR of merely 0.04 s−1 (Table S1). Moreover, after 5 h on stream, the activity of Pd catalysts dropped to only 8% of its original activity; while the Pd3Fe catalysts kept 50% of its initial activity (Figure S4).

To investigate the origin of deactivation, we performed in situ XAS experiments for both Pd and Pd3Fe catalysts (Fig. 9). For the Pd catalyst, we observed a significant change in the FT-EXAFS of the spent catalyst. EXAFS fitting results of the spent catalyst suggest the presence of both Pd-C and Pd-Pd bonds. In particular, the CN of Pd-Pd path has dropped from 6.6 to 3.9, and the CN of Pd-C is 2.4 suggesting the formation of PdCx. On the contrary, for the Pd3Fe catalyst, the FT-EXAFS of spent catalyst shows little difference compared with that of fresh catalyst. (Table S2) Therefore, incorporation of Fe helps the coking resistance and provides the Pd3Fe catalyst with enhanced stability.

3. Discussion
The XRD results suggest that the Pd3Fe_large sample has a Pd3Fe intermetallic structure. The XANES, EXAFS, bond distances, ratios of Pd-Pd to Pd-Fe coordination numbers and infrared spectra of this sample, are all very similar to the Pd3Fe catalyst. Therefore, we confirmed the Au3Cu type Pd3Fe phase in the 1.9 nm catalyst. The STEM images show that both Pd and Pd3Fe catalysts are similar in size. However, their catalytic performances are significantly different. As is well known, the dehydrogenation selectivity of Pd is poor and deactivation is fast [3,36,7,9,37], As a result, Pd is seldom studied for alkane dehydrogenation. Improvements in olefin selectivity to Pt dehydrogenation catalysts are thought to be dominated by changes in the electronic properties of the 5d orbitals and are generally described as an increase in the number of 5d electrons donated from the Sn 4p orbitals for example [38,39]. However, the orbital symmetries of d and p orbitals are orthogonal and little overlap and weak bonding is expected. Thus, transfer of the Sn 4p electrons to Pt is likely small. While geometric effects also are often suggested [40,41], there is little experimental evidence that the structure or surface has smaller ensembles correlating with selectivity.
Unlike Pd, Pd3Fe has high olefin selectivity. The shifts in the L edge XANES are small, about 0.2 eV, and not likely enough to modify Pd to perform like Pt, and especially the high selectivity typical of Pt3Sn. Further evidence that electronic effects do not dominate the selectivity are comparison of the large and small Pd3Fe. The electronic change in the larger particles is greater than that in the smaller particle; however, the selectivity is lower. If the increase in the XANES energy of the small Pd3Fe compared to Pd correlated with its selectivity, then further increases should give even higher selectivity, which is not observed. Thus, while alloy formation with Fe does lead to changes in the energy of the empty Pd 4d orbitals, the change in selectivity is likely due to other factors. IR shows that the surface has few Pd ensembles in the Pd3Fe catalyst, and those surface Pd atoms that bridge bond CO are not effective for alkane hydrogenolysis. The Pd3Fe structure (Fig. 4) is similar to that of Pt3Sn and has similarly high olefin selectivity [38]. Although there are adjacent Pd atoms in Pd3Fe there are no large ensembles, and few 3-fold Pd sites [31]. Thus, it appears that high selectivity can be obtained for structure with two or even three adjacent Pd atoms. While full site isolation is not necessary, the selectivity of PdZn [27] and PdIn [13] were higher than that for these Pd3Fe. The dehydrogenation selectivity of Pd3Fe is consistent with the hypothesis that site isolation of the active site by inactive metal atoms is responsible for high olefin selectivity. In addition, structures with two active atoms have good olefin selectivity, although not as high as structures as with completely isolated active sites. Furthermore, if a noble metal with poor selectivity, like Pd, can demonstrate high olefin selectivity, then other poorly selective noble metals may also be possible if the proper intermetallic structure can be synthesized.
While it appears that electronic changes are not the dominant factor for determination of selectivity, the Pd L-edge XANES shows electronic effects do occur upon alloy formation. The influence of electronic effects may increase the TOR. In our previous work, we have demonstrated that, for Fe(0)/SiO2 catalyst, upon exposure to propane, the metallic Fe catalyzes the CC cleavage and generates coke at very high rate (43 h−1) [24]. As a result, Fe(0)/SiO2 deactivates in few seconds. Therefore, we considered Fe as inactive for propane dehydrogenation. The TOR of Pd3Fe is five times that of Pd, 0.2 s−1 and 0.04 s−1 at 510 °C, respectively. The TOR further increases to 0.3 s−1 in the Pd3Fe_large catalyst. Similar increases in TOR have been reported for PdZn, PdIn, Pt3In and Pt1Zn1 intermetallic alloys [3,11,13,18]. It has been proposed that the increase in the L-edge XANES is due to alloy formation. In addition to this increase, there is a corresponding decrease in the energy of the filled d orbitals, which have recently been measured [18]. If the increase in the Pd L-edge XANES represents a similar decrease in the energy of the filled 4d orbitals of Pd, then Pd-adsorbate bonds will be weaker in Pd3Fe than Pd, since the energy of the unfilled adsorbate orbitals is higher in energy that the Pd 4d’s. As the energy of the Pd 4d orbitals decrease, chemisorption energies will decrease. Thus, Pd-C and Pd-H bonds will be weaker, desorb more easily and result in a faster turnover of the active site. Furthermore, with lower chemisorption energies, one would also expect lower surface coverage of reactants and products, perhaps leading to lower deactivation rates [42,43]. While electronic changes are not thought to be responsible for the large changes in olefin selectivity, they are important to the performance, i.e., rates and stability.
4. Conclusion
2 nm size Pd3Fe catalysts show have high olefin selectivity for propane dehydrogenation; while monometallic Pd is poorly selective. The electronic modification of the Pd 4d orbitals as measured by changes in the Pd L-edge XANES is likely too small to account for the large changes in selectivity. In addition, larger 12 nm Pd3Fe_large NP’s with even large shifts in the L-edge XANES are less selective; thus there is no correlation between the electronic effects and selectivity. The IR spectrum of Pd3Fe suggests that there are few surface 3-fold Pd hollow sites suggesting few surface ensembles capable of hydrogenolysis. While there are three adjacent Pd atoms in Pd3Fe, these show little tendency for hydrogenolysis. The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that site isolation of the active metal by inactive atoms is likely responsible for the high olefin selectivity. While electronic effects are not thought to strongly influence the selectivity, there is a correlation between the TOR and change in the Pd L-edge XANES. The shift of L-edge XANES energy implies a corresponding decrease in the energy of the filled Pd 4d orbitals, weaker adsorbate bond energies, lower reactant surface coverages and higher TORs.
