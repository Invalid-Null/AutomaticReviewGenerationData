 Unfortunately this document does not seem to be relevant, as it does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document is about modeling and control of the Catofin propane process, which involves cyclic operations of propane dehydrogenation and catalyst regeneration. But it does not go into details about any specific catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.
