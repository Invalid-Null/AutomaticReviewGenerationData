Abstract
Magnesium aluminate spinel was prepared with co-precipitation method by varying Mg, Al precursors, Mg/Al molar ratios and calcination temperatures. The as-prepared magnesium aluminate spinel was characterized by nitrogen adsorption–desorption, XRD, FT-IR, NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD and SEM, and were employed to catalyse the vapour-phase decarbonylation of lactic acid (LA) to produce acetaldehyde. Among Mg, Al precursors investigated in our experiment, overwhelming majority can be easily transformed into spinel under high temperatures, which offered highly efficient catalytic performance for decarbonylation of LA to acetaldehyde. Mg/Al molar ratios had a significant influence for this reaction. Under high Mg/Al molar ratios, the catalyst displayed low selectivity to acetaldehyde and high selectivity to propionic acid due to strong alkalinity on its surface. Decreasing Mg/Al molar ratios favoured to acetaldehyde selectivity. Calcination temperatures evidently affected to form spinel structure. With enhancing calcination temperatures, it favoured to the formation of magnesium aluminate spinels, displaying a high crystallinity. Meanwhile, the catalytic performances became better with an increase of calcination temperatures. Accordingly, magnesium aluminate spinel was thought as active species for decarbonylation of LA to acetaldehyde. With further increase of calcination temperatures, the structure of magnesium aluminate spinel was destroyed. At the same time, the catalytic performance also drastically decreased. These results can further confirm the spinel as active species. Under the optimal reaction conditions, LA was almost converted and the selectivity of acetaldehyde achieved 87.5% over the magnesium aluminate spinel with Mg/Al molar ratio = 1:2 at calcination temperature of 1000 °C.

Magnesium aluminate spinel catalyst has been found to have an excellent performance for decarbonylation of lactic acid to acetaldehyde.
1. Introduction
Magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl2O4) has attracted great interest in academy and industry due to its unique properties such as high resistance to chemicals, good mechanical strength in wide range of temperatures, low dielectric constant, excellent optical properties, low thermal expansion, adsorption properties and good catalytic performances [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Several preparation methods such as hydrothermal techniques [11], [12], sol-gel [13], [14], flame spray pyrolysis [15], cool drying [16], [17], controlled hydrolysis [18], co-precipitation [5,19] and aerosol method [20], [21] have been developed to synthesize magnesium aluminate spinels. Among these methods, co-precipitation is viewed as a simple method to synthesize spinel. Due to excellent properties, spinel is widely used for optical engineering applications, electronic humidity sensors, integrated electronic devices, aluminium electronic cells and adsorbents [10]. Besides, its low acidity and thermal stability made spinel an excellent catalyst or catalyst support for oxidation of SO2 to SO3 [22], selective catalytic reduction of NO [23], water-gas shift reaction [24], and propane dehydrogenation [25].
Acetaldehyde is a very important compound and has been utilized as a useful synthon for various important chemicals such as peracetic acid, pentaerythritol, pyridine bases, butylene glycol, and chloral [26], [27]. So far, acetaldehyde is mainly obtained from ethylene route using PdCl2–CuCl2 as a catalytic system [28]. Due to the increasing depletion of petroleum reserves which are used to produce ethylene via high temperature pyrolysis or catalytic cracking, this route will be restricted in the near future. For this reason, it has become a heated research that acetaldehyde, like other chemicals such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, 1-butanol and succinic acid, is produced from the biomass [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. A case in point is that acetaldehyde is produced via catalytic dehydrogenation of ethanol or partial oxidation of ethanol [26,[37], [38], [39], [40], [41]]. Another case is that acetaldehyde is also obtained through decarbonylation of lactic acid (LA) [32]. As a crucial platform molecule, LA is utilized to produce many value added chemicals such as acrylic acid [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], acetaldehyde [32,[47], [48]], 2,3-pentanedione [49], [50], propionic acid [51], pyruvic acid [52] and polymers [53]. Except for corn starch, rich and inexpensive biomass materials such as cellulose [54], sugars [55], and sorbitol [56] have also been used to produce LA. Thus acetaldehyde produced from LA has displayed a potential perspective. However few researches on decarbonylation of LA to acetaldehyde have been reported so far. Katryniok et al. [32] reported silica supported heteropolyacids for the catalytic decarbonylation of LA to acetaldehyde, achieving 81∼83% yield of acetaldehyde at 275 °C. More recently, we have reported metal sulphates and aluminate phosphate as catalysts for the decarbonylation of LA to acetaldehyde [47], [48]. However, to my knowledge, magnesium aluminate spinel has not been used to catalyse decarbonylation of LA to acetaldehyde to date.
In this work, we presented an efficient catalyst (MgAl2O4) for decarbonylation of LA into acetaldehyde. Effect of precursors, Mg/Al molar ratios and calcination temperatures on formation of spinel was investigated. Based on these, we further discussed the relationship between preparation conditions for spinel catalysts and catalytic performances.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Lactic acid (analytic grade, 85∼90 wt%) was purchased from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Reagent Co. and was used for the synthesis of acetaldehyde without further purification. Triple-distilled water was prepared in the laboratory and was used to dilute lactic acid for demanded concentration. Aluminium nitrate(Al(NO3)3·9H2O), magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2·6H2O), aluminium sulphate (Al2(SO4)3·18H2O), magnesium sulphate (MgSO4·5H2O), magnesium chloride (MgCl2·6H2O), sodium aluminate (NaAlO2), aluminium isopropoxide (C9H21AlO3), ammonia solution (25∼28 wt%), acetaldehyde, acrylic acid, propionic acid, acetic acid, 2,3-pentanedione and n-butanol, together with hydroquinone were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Acrylic acid, propionic acid, acetic acid, 2,3-pentanedione and acetaldehyde were used for gas chromatograph reference materials, and n-butanol was utilized as internal standard material. Hydroquinone (0.3 wt%) was used as a polymerization inhibitor.
2.2. Preparation of catalysts
According to previous reports [7], [10], [57], magnesium aluminate spinel was prepared with a co-precipitation method. In a typical experiment, 5.0 g Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and 14.6 g Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Mg/Al molar ratio = 1:2) were fully dissolved in 100 mL distilled water under a stirring state for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the resultant solution was adjusted to pH = 8∼9 to form a white precipitate by dropwise addition of ammonium hydroxide solution (25 wt%). The resulting precipitate was filtered, completely rinsed with distilled water and dried at 120 °C for around 5 h. Similarly, other precursors except for NaAlO2 were also used to prepare spinel catalysts. According to reference [22], NaAlO2 and Mg(NO3)2 were used to synthesize spinel. Prior to use, the catalyst was calcined at demanded temperature in air for 6 h.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction measurement was conducted on a Dmax/Ultima IV diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 20 mA with Cu–Ka radiation. The FTIR spectra of the catalysts were recorded in the range of 500∼4000 cm–1 on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer. The morphologic features of the catalysts were determined by scanning electron microscope (Philips XL30 ESEM FEG). The specific surface areas of catalysts were measured through nitrogen adsorption at 77 K using Autosorb IQ instrument. Prior to adsorption, the samples were treated at 250 °C under vacuum for 6 h and the specific surface area was calculated according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Pore size of catalysts was calculated from desorption branch data on the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. TG analysis was used with Netzsch STA449 F3 analyser. Surface acid and base properties of the samples were estimated by NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD, respectively, on a Quantachrome Instrument. The sample (ca. 50∼60 mg) was purged with dry Ar (50 mL/min, purity > 99.999vt%) at 500 °C for 1.0 h, followed by reducing the furnace temperature to 80 °C, and switching to a flow of 8vt% NH3/Ar or 10 vt% CO2/Ar for 1 h to execute NH3 or CO2 adsorption. Then, the samples adsorbed NH3 or CO2 were desorbed in the range of 80∼700 °C at a rate of 10 C/min.
2.4. Catalyst evaluation
The synthesis of acetaldehyde from lactic acid over the catalysts was carried out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor with a 4 mm inner diameter operated at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (ca. 370 mg, 20∼40 meshes) was placed in the middle of the reactor and quartz wool was placed in both ends. Firstly, the catalyst was pretreated at the required reaction temperature (ca. 380 °C) for 1.0 h under N2 with high purity (0.1 MPa, 1.0 mL/min). The feedstock (20 wt% solution of LA) was then pumped into the reactor (LA aqueous solution flow rate, 1.0 mL/h) and driven through the catalyst bed by nitrogen. The contact time of reactant over the catalyst is around 0.5 s, and the contact time is estimated according to Eq. 1 [47], [58], [59]. The liquid products were condensed using ice-water bath and analysed off-line using a SP-6890 gas chromatograph with a FFAP capillary column connected to a FID. Quantitative analysis of the products was carried out by the internal standard method using n-butanol as the internal standard material. GC–MS analyses of the samples were performed using Agilent 5973 N Mass Selective Detector attachment. The reaction tail gas was analysed using GC with a packed column of TDX-01 connected to TCD detector. The conversion of LA and the selectivity toward acetaldehyde or other by-products were calculated according to Eqs. 2 and 3.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization
3.1.1. XRD and FT-IR
Fig. 1 presented XRD patterns of magnesium aluminate spinel catalysts prepared with different precursors at 1000 °C of calcination temperature. It is evident that all the prepared samples except for sample f show a single phase, well matched with the standard spinel (PDF#21-1152). These samples exhibit strong characteristic diffraction peaks at 19.2°, 31.4°, 37.0°, 44.9°, 59.4° and 65.5°, which can be indexed to (111), (220), (311), (400), (511), and (440) diffractions, respectively [5,7]. Compared to other samples (a∼e), higher intensities of all diffraction peaks indexed to spinel (PDF#21-1152) for sample f were observed, indicating a high crystallinity. However, additional diffraction peaks indexed to MgO (PDF#45-0946) occur, suggesting that a small quantity of MgO formed.

Subsequently, XRD technique was used to characterize the structure of the samples prepared with different Mg/Al molar ratios, and the results were shown in Fig. 2. MgAl2O4 spinel can be formed in all three samples with different Mg/Al molar ratios (1:1, 1:2, and 1:3), respectively. When Mg component increased (ca. Mg/Al = 1:1), characteristic diffraction peaks at 43.3° and 62.4° in the sample were clearly observed, which can be indexed to the phase of MgO (PDF#45-0946) [3]. Next, we utilized the XRD technique to investigate effect of calcination temperature on the sample structure (presented in Fig. 3). At low temperatures, characteristic diffraction peaks exhibit broad diffraction angles and low intensities, indicating a low crystallinity and a small grain size. However, the samples exhibit stronger intensities and narrower diffraction peaks for characteristic diffraction angles with an increase of calcination temperature, suggesting an excellent crystallinity. It is noted that new diffraction peaks appear in the sample when the calcination temperature further increases (ca. 1200 °C), and the characteristic diffraction peaks attributed to MgAl2O4 spinel still remain but evidently reduce. This result suggests that MgAl2O4 spinel partly decomposed or transformed to other phases.

In order to obtain information on the functional groups in the as-prepared samples, IR analyses were carried out as shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 6. From IR spectra of samples shown in Fig. 4, six samples including a, b, c, d, e and f are almost identical. Absorption bands of around 3455 cm−1 and 1640 cm−1 are assigned to H–O–H bending mode, due to adsorption of water [5], [9]. Besides, the IR spectra of these six samples exhibit two characteristic frequencies at ca. 533 cm−1 and 710 cm−1 attributing to [AlO6] groups and characteristic Mg–O–Al vibrations, indicating existence of MgAl2O4 spinel structure in the samples [5], [9]. From IR spectra of the samples with different Mg/Al molar ratios shown in Fig. 5, in the sample with Mg/Al molar ratio = 1, two new absorption bands appear at 1074 cm−1 and 1415 cm−1, confirming that some MgO was not transformed into the MgAl2O4 spinel. Fig. 6 showed the IR spectra of the samples calcined at different temperatures. The strongest absorption bands in the region 500∼800 cm−1 characteristic of the MgAl2O4 phase occur in the sample calcined at 1000 °C. This to some extent demonstrates that 1000 °C is the optimal calcination temperature for formation of MgAl2O4. When the calcination temperature increases from 1000 °C to 1200 °C, a drastic change takes place in the IR spectra. This result is in concert with that obtained from XRD characterization in Fig. 3.

3.1.2. BET
Magnesium aluminate spinel catalysts were synthesized using different precursors with Mg/Al molar ratio = 1:2, followed by calcination of 1000 °C for 6 h. Table 1 showed the BET data for magnesium aluminate spinel catalysts prepared using different precursors. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distribution curves for the prepared catalysts were presented in Fig. 7. Although magnesium aluminate spinel can be successfully prepared using different precursors (confirmed by XRD patterns and FTIR spectra in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4, respectively.), an obvious difference in specific surface areas existed for these magnesium aluminate spinel catalysts. For example, the magnesium aluminate spinel from C9H21AlO3 used as Al precursor exhibited the highest specific surface area (61.6 m2/g), while the magnesium aluminate spinel from NaAlO2 as Al precursor had the lowest specific surface area, only 24.4 m2/g. The pore volumes changed from 0.17 cm3/g to 0.55 cm3/g. Compared with others, the spinel prepared with aluminium isopropoxide had higher pore volume (0.55 cm3/g). This result may be relative to organic aluminium as aluminium source. Under high temperature (1000 °C) together with air atmosphere, aluminium isopropoxide can be easily decomposed to form carbon dioxide, leading to a large number of pores [8]. Pore diameter was calculated from the data of desorption branch on the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. According to the mesopore definition of porous materials (2 nm∼50 nm), all the prepared catalysts belong to mesoporous materials.

Besides, BET data of the spinel prepared from Mg(NO3)2–Al(NO3)3 at different Mg/Al molar ratios were also tested, and the results were shown in Table 2 and Fig. 8. It is clearly seen that Mg/Al molar ratios have a slight influence on the specific surface areas of the catalysts. Subsequently, the specific surface areas of the spinels calcined at different temperatures were also measured, and the results were listed in Table 3. From the BET data given in Table 3, we found that the specific surface area of the spinel reduced with an increase of calcination temperature except for 900 °C. A similar effect of calcination temperature on spinel′s specific surface area was also observed by other investigators [8].

The TPD curves for samples (a, b, c, d, e and f) agree well with each other. A broad desorption peak appears in the region of 150∼400 °C in which were regarded as weak-medium acidity (alkalinity). However, compared with others, sample f showed a weak desorption peak in the region of 150∼400 °C, indicating a low acid density. Acid density together with alkalinity density was shown in Table S1 and Table S2 in Support Information.

From the TPD profiles shown in Fig. 10 (A, B), three samples exhibit a strong and broad peak at 150∼400 °C, suggesting that weak-medium acid sites were distributed on the sample surface. However, as for the sample with Mg/Al molar ratio = 1:1, a strong desorption was observed at higher temperature (> 550 °C) which shows strong acid (alkali) sites distributed on the sample surface. Fig. 11 shows the NH3/CO2-TPD of the samples calcined at different temperatures. From Fig. 11A, weak-medium acid sites increase when calcination temperature increases from 550 °C to 900 °C, while strong acid sites decrease. With further increase of calcination temperature from 1000 °C to 1200 °C, both weak-medium and strong acid sites drastically decrease. From Fig. 11B, similar phenomena were observed. Weak-medium alkali sites increase when calcination temperature increases from 550 °C to 1000 °C, while strong alkali sites decrease. At 1200 °C, both weak-medium and strong alkali sites also drastically decrease.

It is clearly seen that the morphology of catalyst particles is subsphaeroidal. The catalyst is composed of these particles through a stackable form. Therefore the pore size of the catalyst is around 24.3 nm due to formation of stackable holes.

3.2. Catalyst evaluation
3.2.1. Effect of catalyst preparation methods on the catalytic performance
3.2.1.1. Mg, Al precursors
Table 4 showed the effect of Mg, Al precursors on the catalytic performance obtained at 380 °C with LA concentration of 20 wt% and feed flow rate of 1.0 mL/h (corresponding LHSV = 2.63 h–1). It is clearly seen that LA conversion was drastically influenced by Al precursors. For example, LA conversion over the catalyst obtained from Mg(NO3)2–NaAlO2 is only 35.8%, far less than others. As for acetaldehyde selectivity, precursors had also a great influence. For example, the catalyst prepared with Mg(NO3)2-NaAlO2 displayed 68.2% for acetaldehyde selectivity, while other five catalysts offered obviously higher acetaldehyde selectivities (84.0%∼87.5%). It is noted that the same catalyst prepared with Mg(NO3)2-NaAlO2 displayed higher propionic acid selectivity (ca. 14.5%) than the other five catalysts. According to XRD characterization in the foregoing sections, the catalyst prepared with Mg(NO3)2-NaAlO2 has a low MgO phase, except for MgAl2O4 spinel phase. It is known that MgO is a typical basic oxide. Due to the occurrence of MgO in the catalyst prepared from Mg(NO3)2-NaAlO2, it drastically reduced the surface acidity of catalyst. At the same time, its alkalinity was also consumed. For example, from Table S1 surface acid amount over the catalyst prepared from Mg(NO3)2-NaAlO2 is only 0.07 mmol/g during 150∼400 °C, far less than others (0.13∼0.23 mmol/g). Besides, from Table S2, its surface alkalinity amount (0.38 mmol/g during 150∼400 °C) is also lower than others (0.51∼0.91 mmol/g).

3.2.1.2. Mg/Al molar ratio
Effect of Mg/Al molar ratio on the catalytic performance was investigated and the results were depicted in Table 5. For LA conversion, it was found that Mg/Al molar ratios displayed a relatively minor influence. For example, LA conversion changed between 93.0% and 100% in the range of 1:3 and 1:1 for Mg/Al molar ratios, observing the largest difference value of only 7.0%. However, as for acetaldehyde selectivity, Mg/Al molar ratios had a drastic influence. A case in point is that 46.2% of acetaldehyde selectivity is obtained when the Mg/Al molar ratio is 1:1; nevertheless, 87.5% of acetaldehyde selectivity is obtained at Mg/Al molar ratio = 1:2. Similarly, Mg/Al molar ratios were also found to have an evident influence on propionic acid selectivity. Over the high Mg/Al molar ratio, high propionic acid selectivity was obtained. A case is that 6.8% of propionic acid selectivity over the catalyst at Mg/Al molar ratio = 1:1 which was obviously higher than the other two catalysts was achieved. This result can be well explained through the above characterizations such as XRD shown in Fig. 2, FT-IR shown in Fig. 5 and TPD shown in Figs. 10A and B. Indeed, MgO phase was clearly found in the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2, which was further confirmed by FT-IR presented in Fig. 5. It is known that MgO displays an evident alkalinity, belonging to a typical alkali metallic oxide. The alkalinity of catalyst is beneficial to hydrogenation reaction of substrates [60], [61]. Therefore, it is easily understood to observe a high selectivity (6.8%) toward propionic acid on the catalyst with Mg/Al molar ratio = 1:1. Considering the acetaldehyde selectivity together with LA conversion shown in Table 5, the optimal Mg/Al molar ratio is around 1:2.

3.2.1.3. Calcination temperature
For most of heterogeneous catalysts, calcination at high temperature is a crucial step to obtain an excellent catalytic performance [42], [62], [63]. Table 6 showed the effect of calcination temperature on the catalytic performance of the catalysts obtained from precursors Mg(NO3)2–Al(NO3)3, with Mg/Al molar ratio = 1:2. When calcination temperature increased from 550 °C to 1000°C, LA conversion remains constant (100%). With further increase of calcination temperature (ca. 1200 °C), LA conversion drastically decreased to 60%. As for product selectivity, calcination temperature displayed a great influence. Acetaldehyde selectivity gradually increased with an increase of calcination temperature. For example, 63.0% of acetaldehyde selectivity was obtained at 550 °C of calcination temperature. When the calcined temperature increased from 550 °C to 1000 °C, corresponding selectivity of acetaldehyde increased from 63.0% to 87.5%. However, similar to the phenomena observed in LA conversion at 1200 °C, acetaldehyde selectivity also drastically reduced. It is noted that at this calcination temperature (1200 °C) the selectivities for all the three products including propionic acid, acrylic acid and 2,3-pentanedione obviously increased, respectively.

Scheme 1. The possible mechanism for decarbonylation of LA to acetaldehyde over the catalyst.
In order to fully understand the effect of calcination temperature on the catalytic performance, we can combine with the characterization in the above sections to discuss the decarbonylation reaction of LA. According to XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3, the intensities of diffraction peaks attributed to spinel structure became stronger and stronger with an increase of calcination temperature, indicating a formation of a large quantity of magnesium aluminate spinel with a high crystallinity. It is noteworthy that acetaldehyde selectivity also increased with an increase of calcination temperature. These results just demonstrated that the increase of magnesium aluminate spinel phase in catalysts favoured to catalyse the decarbonylation of LA to form acetaldehyde. Besides, it was further investigated that the surface acidity and alkalinity of catalysts calcined at different temperatures shown in Fig. 11 were related to catalytic performance. From Fig. 11A and Table S3, weak-medium acid sites increase from 0.0011 mmol/m2 to 0.0062 mmol/m2 when calcination temperature increases from 550 °C to 1200 °C. From Fig. 11B and Table S4, similar phenomena were observed. Weak-medium alkali sites increase from 0.0038 mmol/m2 to 0.0587 mmol/m2 when calcination temperature increases from 550 °C to 1200 °C. Although the catalyst calcined at 1200 °C has the highest surface acid density, its specific surface area is only 2.2 m2/g, which is less an order of magnitude than other catalysts (52.0∼201.0 m2/g). As for acetaldehyde selectivity, it also increased with an increase of calcination temperatures between 550 °C and 1000 °C. Furthermore, when the calcination temperature continuously increased to 1200 °C, acetaldehyde selectivity drastically decreased to 73.3%. Thus these results fully suggested that selective formation of acetaldehyde from LA was related to weak-medium acid sites distributed on the catalyst surface. Furthermore, acidity-alkalinity balance is also an important factor for catalytic decarbonylation reaction of LA to acetaldehyde. By the way, the acidity–alkalinity balance effect for heterogeneous catalysts on dehydration of LA to acrylic acid has been also found in the previous reports [64], [65].
3.2.2. Catalyst stability
Fig. 13 showed the stability of the catalyst with time on stream. The experiment on stability of the catalyst with Mg/Al molar ratio = 1:2 calcined at 1000 °C was performed at 380 °C with LA concentration of 20 wt% and feed flow rate of 1 mL/h. It is known that long-term stability is a very important characteristic for a heterogeneous catalyst [66], [67], [68], [69], [70]. So far there are only few cases on decarbonylation of LA to acetaldehyde to report the stability of the catalysts. The first case is SBA-15 loaded with silicotungstic acid as an active phase for decarbonylation of LA to acetaldehyde [32]. In this case, we can obtain the data on catalytic performance within only 5 h. Recently, we have reported the aluminium sulphate catalyst for decarbonylation of LA which offered the catalytic performance with 50 h on stream [47]. From Fig. 13, LA conversion gradually decreased with time on stream. For example, in the initial time of reaction, LA conversion maintained around 95% while after experienced 100 h on stream, LA conversion reduced to near 60%. Compared with the effect of time on stream on LA conversion, acetaldehyde selectivity was less influenced by the time on stream. For example, acetaldehyde selectivity also slightly decreased from about 84.0% at the initial reaction time (1 h∼10 h) to 72.0% at 100 h on stream. From the experimental points shown in Fig. 13, LA conversion as well as acetaldehyde selectivity simultaneously decreased with time on stream. For these results, there are significant parallels with the previous report [47]. Catalytic performance reduced with time on stream, indicating a deactivation of catalyst. However, the deactivated catalyst can easily regenerate the activity after a simple calcination under the air because the resultants on the catalyst surface causing in deactivation are carbon or coke. The catalytic performance over the spent catalyst was shown in Fig. S1. In addition, the thermal analysis and XRD were used to characterize the spent catalyst, and the results were shown in Fig. S2 and Fig. S3, respectively.
3.3. Reaction mechanism
Unlike the mechanism on dehydration of LA into acrylic acid which has been discussed by many researchers [64], [65], [71], the mechanism for decarbonylation of LA to acetaldehyde is rarely investigated. Recently, Ghantani et al. [71] have proposed the decarbonylation reaction mechanism of LA to form acetaldehyde over the calcium hydroxyapatite. More recently, we have also discussed the mechanism on decarbonylation of LA to acetaldehyde over the aluminium sulphate catalyst [47]. Similarly, based on the experimental results achieved over the magnesium aluminate spinel catalyst, we proposed the possible reaction mechanism on formation of acetaldehyde from LA as followed in Scheme 1. Firstly, dissociative adsorption of LA occurs on the magnesium aluminate spinel catalyst, where the hydroxyl group in LA molecule adsorbs on the Mg site, forming a C–O–Mg bond and the hydroxyl proton gets abstracted by aluminate oxygen forming Al–OH. Subsequently, Al–OH further reacts with the carboxylic –OH group to form aluminate ester. In the end, this aluminate ester decomposes to produce acetaldehyde and carbon monoxide. The mechanism on decarbonylation of LA to acetaldehyde was well demonstrated by analysis of tail gas. The productivity of CO in tail gas drastically increased with an increase of LA feed flow rate, while the productivity of CO2 in tail gas hardly increased. According to Eq. 1, contact time of LA on the surface of catalyst reduced with an increase of LA feed flow rate. CO2 in tail gas is possibly formed through the path of water-gas shift reaction. Short contact time does not favour the water-gas shift reaction, resulting in low concentration of CO2 in tail gas. This result suggested that acetaldehyde is not formed via the decarboxylation of LA, but the decarbonylation of LA.
4. Conclusions
Magnesium aluminate spinel prepared with co-precipitation method was firstly used to catalyse the decarbonylation of LA to acetaldehyde. It was found that magnesium aluminate spinel acts as active phase for decarbonylation of LA. Different precursors have offered different catalytic performances because formation of magnesium aluminate spinel was influenced by precursors. Mg/Al molar ratios have also a different effect on catalytic performance. High Mg/Al molar ratio displayed poor selectivity to acetaldehyde due to high alkalinity on the catalyst surface resulting in destroying the balance of acidity–alkalinity. Decreasing Mg/Al molar ratio effectively reduced in alkalinity to maintain the balance of acidity–alkalinity favouring the decarbonylation of LA to acetaldehyde. Enhancing calcination temperature favoured to formation of spinel structure, leading to high activity. However, with further enhancing calcination temperature it offered a poor catalysis due to encountering a destroying of spinel phase.
