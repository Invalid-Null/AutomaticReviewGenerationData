The given document discusses the catalytic properties of magnesium orthovanadate, magnesium pyrovanadate, and mixed oxides of vanadium and magnesium in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and butane. It does not specifically pertain to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) for converting propane to propylene. The document examines oxidative dehydrogenation of both propane and butane, rather than focusing specifically on propane to propylene conversion.
