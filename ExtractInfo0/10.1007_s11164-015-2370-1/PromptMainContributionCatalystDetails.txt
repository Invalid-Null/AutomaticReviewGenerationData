Effect of potassium addition on bimetallic PtSn/θ-Al2O3 catalyst for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene
PtSn/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with different amounts of K (0.14, 0.22, 0.49, 0.72, and 0.96 wt%) are prepared to investigate the K effects on the PtSn catalyst in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). KPtSn catalyst with 0.xx wt% K, 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.75 wt% Sn is designated as xx-KPtSn. PDH was performed at 873 K and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 53,000 mL/gcat h. The temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and CO chemisorption of the KPtSn catalysts with K added revealed the potassium addition blocked the acid sites, promoted the reduction of Sn oxide and decreased the Pt dispersion. The formations of cracking products and higher hydrocarbons on acid sites were suppressed by the K effect of blocking the acid sites. In contrast, K addition at more than 0.72 wt% rather increased cracking products and the amount of coke, resulting in the severe deactivation of catalysts. The high cracking products on the KPtSn catalysts with the high amount of K should not be related to the acid sites, because the acid sites were monotonously decreased with an increase in the amount of K. Instead, the potassium affected the characteristics of PtSn. The interaction between Pt and Sn could be weakened by enriching the reduced Sn, because the K component promoted the reduction of Sn oxide in the TPR experiments. Therefore, the 14-KPtSn catalyst with the low amount of K exhibits the highest stability and selectivity among the prepared KPtSn catalysts due to the compromise of the advantageous (blocking the acid sites) and bad (weakening the interaction between Pt and Sn) effects of the K addition in PDH.
Introduction
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important chemical process for petrochemicals [1–5]. Propylene is a chemical intermediate for the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, phenol, and isopropylic alcohol [6–9]. Propylene is also used in refineries for alkylation and oligomerization reactions to produce an alkylate-blended, clean fuel with a high octane number. PDH was conducted at higher temperature (823–883 K); however, PDH at high temperature mainly produces cracking products and the coke formation caused severe deactivation of the catalysts [10].
The addition of Sn to Pt-supported catalyst has been widely investigated in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to light olefins. The roles of Sn were proposed to modify the electronic and geometric properties of Pt. The sizes of platinum ensembles were decreased by the geometric effect of Sn, which reduced hydrogenolysis and coking reactions [11]. Sn could also modify the electronic density of Pt, either by positive charge transfer from Snn+ species or by the different electronic structures of PtSn alloys. The electronic modification was responsible for changes in the heat of adsorption of different adsorbates participating in the reaction [4]. Many researchers have reported PtSn catalytic systems with different supports [12–16], zeolites [17, 18], mesoporous materials [19], alkali metals (Na, K) and rare earth metal (La, Ce, Y) [20–26] for PDH. Tahriri et al. studied the influence of solvent in the preparation of Pt–Sn/θ-Al2O3 catalyst for PDH. The PtSn/θ-Al2O3 catalyst prepared with ethanol showed the better activity among the other solvents such as water and acetone [27].

yield among the other catalysts in the investigation on the selective and stable bimetallic Pt1.5Sn x.x /θ-Al2O3 for dehydrogenation of n-butane to n-butenes [28]. Based on this information, we studied dehydrogenation (propane and butane) of alkane to light olefins over the Pt0.5Sn x.x catalyst with low Pt content, which are important for the practical applications [29]. 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.75 wt% Sn-supported θ-Al2O3 catalyst showed the highest C

yield and the catalyst was stable among the other samples for PDH. So far, few authors have studied the K-doped PtSn catalyst with different supports for PDH. In the present work, the effects of K addition to the Pt0.5Sn0.75/θ-Al2O3 catalyst were studied for PDH. The 0.14 wt% K doped catalyst showed maximum C

yield among the prepared samples with K added. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirmed the presence of PtSn alloy on the prepared bimetallic PtSn catalysts. Temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) studies were performed to investigate the acidic sites of the catalyst and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were done to monitor the changes of the reducibility of the prepared oxide samples. The effects of the K additions could be explained by the characteristic studies on the KPtSn catalysts using XRD, NH3 -TPD, TPR, TEM and CO chemisorption.
Experimental
Catalyst preparation
The 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.75 wt% Sn-supported θ-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by a co-impregnation method, using hydrogen hexachloroplatinate (IV) hydrate (H2PtCl6·nH2O, n = 5.8, purity = 99 %; Kojima Chemicals Co., Ltd, Japan) and tin (II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl2. 2H2O, purity = 98 %; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) salt as precursors. Weighed amounts of Pt and Sn salt were placed in a 50-ml beaker and dissolved in a required quantity of ethanol. A spherical θ-Al2O3 support (~3 mm) was prepared by calcining the spherical γ-Al2O3 at 1273 K for 6 h (γ-Al2O3 support was supplied by Hyosung Company, South Korea). The θ-Al2O3 support was added into the beaker with Pt and Sn solution. Ethanol was removed by evaporation on a hot plate, and the residue was dried at 393 K overnight and calcined at 773 K for 4 h in air. The calcined θ-alumina-supported PtSn catalyst was designated as 00-KPtSn. 00-KPtSn catalyst means that 0.5 wt% Pt, 0.75 wt% Sn and 0.0 wt% K was loaded on the θ-Al2O3 support.
Samples with different amounts of potassium were prepared by adding the appropriate quantities of aqueous solutions of potassium hydroxide (purity ≥ 86 %; Fluka) to (PtSn)0.5 so that the final resultant materials contained 0.15, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 wt% of K. The samples were dried at 393 K overnight and were calcined in air at 773 K for 4 h. The potassium, Pt and Sn contents of the samples were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Table 1). The 0.xx wt% 00-KPtSn samples with K added were designated as xx-KPtSn.

Catalyst characterization
The XRD patterns of the prepared KPtSn catalysts were recorded on a diffractometer (M/S, Shimadzu Instruments, Japan) with Ni-filtered Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) as a radiation source. The operating voltage was 40 kV and the current was 30 mA with a scanning rate of 2θ and 2°min−1. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas and N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were performed at 77 K using an automated gas sorption system (Belsorp II mini, BEL Japan, Inc.). The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method was used for discerning the pore size distribution. The NH3-TPD was performed to determine the acidic properties of the catalysts. The sample was pre-treated at 773 K for 1 h under a stream of helium (30 mL min−1) in order to remove the moisture, physically adsorbed water and other impurities. After the pretreatment, the ammonia (5 % NH3/He, flow: 30 mL min−1) was introduced at 373 K for 1 h, and then the weekly adsorbed ammonia was removed at 373 K for 1 h. During the desorption step, the temperature was ramped from 323 to 1073 K with a heating rate of 10 K min−1 under a stream of helium (30 mL min−1). The NH3 desorption profile was monitored with a mass detector (PFEIFFER Vacuum, Prisma, Germany). 17 amu signals were monitored to obtain NH3 desorption curves. The TPR experiments were carried out using a temperature program analyzer (BELCAT, BEL Japan, Inc.). The sample was thermally treated under an Ar stream at 673 K for 2 h to remove physically adsorbed water and other impurities. After the pretreatment, the catalysts were heated at 10 K min−1 from room temperature up to 1073 K in 5 % H2/Ar stream with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1. The chemisorptions of CO were performed with a pulse chemisorption mode (BELCAT, BEL Japan, Inc.). Prior to measurements, 0.050 g of a sample was thermally treated under a He stream at 773 K for 50 min to remove physically adsorbed water and other impurities. The sample was reduced in a pure H2 flow at 823 K for 2 h. After the reduction at 823 K, the sample was purged with He gas at the same temperature for 1 h. After cooling to 323 K, the 10 % CO/He gas was introduced for the CO chemisorption. CO loop gas was used for each pulse, and the pulse injections were repeated until saturation. The amount of the chemisorbed CO was measured using a thermal conductivity detector. The metal dispersion of each catalyst was then calculated from the amount of CO adsorbed, taking the stoichiometry factor (SF) as one for CO/Ptatm.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a technique to calculate the Pt particle size by using a CM30 microscope (Philips) with an accelerating voltage of 50–300 kV using a LaB6 source. The reduced catalyst sample was dispersed in ethanol solution and the suspension was carried out using ultrasonic bath for 30 min. The resulting solution was deposited on a copper grid coated with a carbon film, and the alcohol was evaporated. Finally, the sample containing the copper grid was used for the TEM analysis. Carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur (CHNS) analysis was carried out using a Fisions EA1108 instrument for the determination of the amount of accumulated carbon on the surface of the catalyst after the reaction. The Pt, Sn and K were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES).
Catalytic reaction test
The prepared catalysts were first crushed and sieved using a testing sieve. The final particle size was in the range of 180–435 μm before the activity test. PDH was carried out at 873 K at atmospheric pressure using 0.080 g of the catalyst after the H2 reduction. The internal diameter (i.d.) of the fixed bed tubular quartz reactor was 10 mm, and the catalyst bed length between the quartz wool layers in the reactor was approximately 3–4 mm. Before each experiment, the sample was reduced in a pure hydrogen (99.99 %) flow (30 mL min−1). The temperature during the reduction was increased slowly from room temperature to 883 K (10 K min−1) and maintained at 883 K for 2 h. After the reduction, C3H8:H2 feed gases with a molar ratio of 3:2 were introduced into the catalytic reactor for the reaction, and the total gas flow rate was maintained constant at 30 mL min−1. The products and reactants were analyzed with an online gas chromatograph (GC) with a flame ionization detector (FID, Series M 600D, South Korea) equipped with a capillary column (i.d.: 0.53 mm, length: 50 m; GS-Alumina, Agilent Technologies, USA).
Results and discussion
Characterization of catalysts
Figures 1 and 2 show the calcined and reduced XRD patterns of 00-KPtSn catalyst with different amount of K loadings. No XRD peaks from Pt/PtO or Sn/SnO2 or K phases were observed in the calcined catalysts and only θ-Al2O3 phases appeared (ICDD file no.: 47-1771) This is because the metal components were highly dispersed on the support and/or too small to be detected by XRD techniques. The 2θ values of Pt were at 39.76°, 46.24° and 67.45° (ICDD file no.: 04-0802), and those of Sn were at 15.57°, 16.35°, 22.10°, 27.64°, and 28.99° (ICDD file no.: 19-1365). No characteristic peaks of Pt/PtO x and Sn/SnO x were observed in the XRD patterns of the reduced potassium-doped Pt0.5Sn0.75 catalysts, too. The reduced bimetallic potassium-doped Pt0.5Sn0.75 catalysts showed θ-Al2O3 (ICDD file no.: 47-1771) and PtSn (ICDD file no.: 25-0614) phases with hexagonal structures, indicating the formation of PtSn alloy during the reaction. Additionally, no diffraction peaks assigned to the crystalline potassium were detected, suggesting that potassium species were highly dispersed on the θ-Al2O3 support.

Table 1 shows the physical properties such as BET surface area and pore size distribution. The loading contents (Pt, Sn and K) of the prepared catalysts were determined using AAS/ICP-AES analysis. The BET surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter of θ-Al2O3 were 98 m2 g−1, 0.360 cm3 g−1, and 15 nm, respectively. The surface areas of the calcined and reduced 00-KPtSn catalyst were 98 and 91 m2 g−1, respectively. The surface areas of the samples containing potassium were approximately 92–97 m2 g−1 for the calcined ones and approximately 91–87 m2 g−1 for the reduced ones. The BET surface area of the 00-KPtSn catalyst was not changed much with an increase in potassium content. The pore volume (365–361 cm3 g−1) and pore size (15.4–15.8 nm) of the calcined catalyst were slightly varied with the increase in potassium content.
Figure 3 shows the NH3-TPD profiles of KPtSn catalysts with different potassium loadings. The catalytic activity was primarily related to the acidity of the catalysts in PDH. All the NH3-TPD profiles were de-convoluted using Lorentzian–Gaussian functions. Table 2 shows the multi-peak fitting with different temperatures, percentage of peak and total NH3 uptake of different potassium-loaded catalysts. It can be observed that all the samples exhibit three peaks. The peak (I) at 445–472 K and 476–512 K is assigned as weak acidic sites, the peak (II) at 529–601 K can be attributed to medium acidic sites, and the final peak (III) at 628–645 K and 655–755 K can be considered as strong acidic sites [30]. The amount of the acidic sites of mono metallic 14-KPt catalyst was 0.522 mmol g

and of bimetallic 00-KPtSn catalyst, it was 0.442 mmol g

. The results indicate that the addition of Pt and Sn on θ-Al2O3 decreased the acidic sites of the support [31]. KPtSn catalysts with different amounts of K were also studied, and the results are also shown in Table 2. The above results clearly showed that the K addition to Pt0.5Sn0.75 suppressed the acid sites of the catalyst. The acidic sites of the catalyst were decreased with the increase of potassium content on 00-KPtSn. The total ammonia uptakes were as follows: θ-Al2O3 > 14-KPt > 00-KPtSn > 14-KPtSn > 22-KPtSn > 49-KPtSn > 72-KPtSn > 96-KPtSn. It was suggested that the addition of K or Sn reduced the acidic sites of the support due to its basic character [22, 32]. The number of strong acid sites was significantly decreased by the K addition, but the number of weak acid sites was rarely influenced by the K addition to PtSn catalyst. The number of weak acid sites was estimated to be 0.118 ± 0.02 mmol g

for all the KPtSn catalysts. The total acid sites of KPtSn catalysts were not significantly dependent on the amount of K.

Figure 4 shows the TPR profiles of 14-KSn, 13-KPt and KPtSn catalysts and Table 3 shows the reduction temperature, hydrogen consumption and percentage of catalyst reduction. All the TPR profiles were de-convoluted using Lorentzian–Gaussian functions. A small reduction peak for a finely dispersed Sn species at 536 K appeared with the 14-KSn catalyst (Fig. 4a). The broad reduction peaks at 600, 671, 749 and 789 K could be due to the reduction of Sn4+/Sn2+ and/or Sn2+/Sn0 species, respectively [35, 36]. The peak at 890 K can be assigned to the reduction of Sn2+ to Sn0 in a strong interaction with the support [30, 37]. The mono-metallic K0.13(Pt)0.5 (Fig. 4b) catalyst showed the low-temperature reduction peak at 382 and 456 K, which was assigned as the reduction of the Pt species in the weak interaction with the support. The other peak at 626 K was assigned to the reduction of the Pt species in a strong interaction with the support [33]. The reduction peaks at 772 and 867 K can be attributed to oxychlorinated Pt species. [26, 34]. The TPR profiles of the 13-KPt and 14-KSn samples are overlapped in the temperature range up to 984 K, indicating that the Pt and Sn species can be co-reduced in this range. The 00-KPtSn catalyst (Fig. 4c) showed reduction peaks at 478, 522, 650, 766 and 960 K. The reduction peaks at 478 and 522 K (α) can be assigned to the co-reduction of the Pt species with Sn species, which is mainly related to the Pt species in a weak interaction with the support. The peak at 650 (β) can be assigned to the co-reduction of the Pt species with Sn species, which is related to the Pt species in a strong interaction with the support. The reduction peak at 766 (γ) can be assigned to the reduction of isolated Sn4+/Sn2+ and/or Sn2+/Sn0 species. The reduction peak at 960 K (δ) can be assigned to the reduction of Sn2+/Sn0 species in a strong interaction with the support. The 14-KPtSn catalyst (Fig. 4d) showed reduction peaks at 511, 559, 649, 849 and 992 K. The reduction peaks at 511 and 559 K (α), and 649 K (β) can be assigned to the reduction of the Pt with Sn and K species [22]. The reduction peaks at 849 K (γ) and 992 K (δ) can be assigned mainly to the reduction of Sn4+/Sn2+ and/or Sn2+/Sn0 species, and Sn2+/Sn0 species, respectively. The K0.22(Pt0.5Sn0.75) (Fig. 4e) catalyst showed α peaks at 368, 486 and 566 K, and β, γ, and δ peaks at 680, 769 and 992/1009 K. The 49-KPtSn catalyst (Fig. 4f) also showed α peaks at 401, 478 and 554 K, and β, γ, and δ peaks at 658, 740, and 906 and 998 K. All the reduction peaks with the 72-KPtSn and 96-KPtSn (Fig. 4g, h) catalyst could also be assigned to the β, γ, and δ peak as shown in Table 3. When the TPR pattern of the 13-KPt is compared with that of Pt0.5 previously reported [19], the reduction temperatures at α peak position with the 13-KPt appear at lower reduction temperature. When potassium was added to 00-KPtSn, the reduction temperatures of α and γ peaks of KPtSn oxides were shifted to lower temperatures. It was reported the alkali metal addition facilitated the redox properties of metal oxides [38] by observing that the reduction temperatures were shifted to lower ones by the alkali metal addition to metal oxides. Similarly, potassium addition decreased the reduction temperatures of 00-KPtSn. In addition, the hydrogen consumptions were increased with increasing potassium content in KPtSn oxides, indicating that the reduction of Sn oxide was promoted by the addition of potassium (Table 3), supporting the notion that the addition of potassium promoted the reduction of Sn species [39].

Table 4 shows the Pt surface areas (MSA), Pt dispersions (D) and particle sizes (PS) of the KPtSn catalysts by CO chemisorption. The mono-metallic 13-KPt catalyst exhibited a low Pt dispersion. The bimetallic 00-KPtSn catalyst showed the highest Pt dispersion and Pt surface area. The Pt dispersion of KPtSn catalysts slightly decreased with an increase in potassium amount. However, the Pt metal dispersion rapidly decreased with the KPtSn catalyst more than 0.72 wt%. The potassium addition below 0.49 wt% rarely covered the exposed Pt surface, but that above 0.49 wt% significantly covered the Pt surface resulting in low Pt dispersion.

Figure 5 shows TEM images and particle size distribution of the reduced KPtSn catalysts. Pt particle sizes of the reduced 13-KPt and KPtSn catalysts were calculated from the TEM images. The Pt particles size of the 00-KPtSn catalyst was the smallest among the prepared catalysts, which corresponds with the CO chemisorption results. The Pt metal dispersion decreased with an increase in potassium content, as shown in Table 4.

yields of the tested catalysts. The reaction was carried out at a GHSV of 53,000 mL (gcat h)−1 and 873 K in PDH. The products of C1–C2 included methane, ethane and ethylene, which could be produced on the hydrocracking sites on the Pt metal species. The cracking products were the highest on the 13-KPt and 14-KSn catalyst. The cracking sites on the Pt catalyst were little influenced by the potassium addition, but were blocked by the Sn addition, as shown in Table 5. The selectivity to C1–C2 of 00-KPtSn catalyst was not significantly changed with the addition of a small amount potassium, but rather increased with the addition of potassium at more than 0.5 wt%. The addition of potassium mainly reduces the formation of higher hydrocarbons, which improves the C

selectivity (Table 5), indicating that the potassium on Pt particles suppressed the acidic sites on the Pt particles, as shown in Fig. 4.

The initial conversions of 00-KPtSn, 14-KPtSn, 22-KPtSn, 49-KPtSn, 72-KPtSn, 96-KPtSn, 13-KPt and 14-KSn catalysts were 28.6, 24.9, 23.2, 19.4, 14.7, 11.6, 15.6 and 3.0 %, respectively. The conversion of each catalyst after 5 h decreased to 25.4, 23.2, 21.2, 17.3, 12.0 9.8, 11.9 and 3.2 %, respectively. The conversion is closely related to the Pt dispersion, except for 14-KPtSn. The 14-KPtSn showed the optimized composition for the potassium addition. Veldurthi et al. [40] reported that the improvement of catalytic activity was mainly related to the Pt dispersion, Pt surface area and particle size of the catalysts. The compositions listed in order of C

yield at 873 K were as follows: 00-KPtSn > 14-KPtSn > 22-KPtSn > 49-KPtSn > 72-KPtSn > 96-KPtSn > 13-KPt > 14-KSn. The deactivation parameters of the prepared catalysts are shown in Table 5 [ΔX = 100 × (X i − X f)/X i, where X i is the initial and X f is the final conversion, respectively]. The mono-metallic 13-KPt showed very high deactivation parameters and the catalyst was strongly deactivated with time on steam. 13-KPt catalyst showed very low Pt dispersion (7.1 %) and Pt surface area (0.083 m2 (gcat)−1), and a large Pt particles size (>15.9 nm). The coke formation after the reaction was 1.12 wt%, which was the highest among the prepared catalysts. The deactivation parameters are closely related to the coke amount after 5 h of reaction. The coke formation on the catalyst involves several processes such as dehydrogenation condensation, polymerization, and cyclization of hydrocarbon species on the catalyst surface [35, 41, 42]. It was known that the olefinic precursors on the metal active sites migrated to the supports, which were converted to polyolefinic or polyaromatic types of coke through condensation and polymerization reactions. The relationship between the particle size of the active metal and the amount of carbon deposited on the surface of the support was reported [11, 43]. The coke formation on the 00-KPtSn) catalyst (the Sn addition to Pt) was much lower than that on the 13-KPt catalyst (the K addition to Pt). The 0.14 wt% K addition to the 00-KPtSn catalyst suppressed the coke formation on the 00-KPtSn significantly, but K addition at more than 0.49 wt% rather increased the coke formation. The coke can form on the cracking, isomerization and higher hydrocarbon sites on the Pt particles and acid sites. The coke deposition on Pt catalyst occurred mainly on the cracking sites on the Pt particles and the cracking sites were inhibited by the Sn addition. The potassium could inhibit the acid sites on the support as well as on the Pt particles. The stability of the KPtSn catalyst also increased with an increase in the potassium amount up to 0.5 wt%. The high stability of KPtSn catalyst with low potassium content is ascribed to the suppression of the acid sites on the 00-KPtSn catalyst, while the low stability of KPtSn catalysts with high potassium contents (more than 0.49 wt%) can be due to large Pt particle sizes, as shown in Table 4. Additionally, the high selectivity to C1–C2 of 72-KPtSn and 96-KPtSn indicates that PtSn interaction was weakened by the potassium addition at a high content.

selectivity of the 00-KPtSn catalyst was 89.0/89.0 % for Si/Sf, while that of the 14-KPtSn catalyst was 92.9/92.6 %. The high C

selectivity of the KPtSn catalysts resulted from inhibiting the formation of higher hydrocarbons, as discussed previously, because the selectivity to C1–C2 was not significantly changed with the potassium addition up to 0.25 wt% K. Finally, the catalysts listed in the order of stability were as follows: 14-KPtSn > 22-KPtSn > 49-KPtSn > 00-KPtSn > 72-KPtSn > 96-KPtSn > 13-KPt. Figure 7 shows the catalytic activity of the 00-KPtSn and 14-KPtSn catalysts at 873 K for 15 h. After 15 h, the yield of propane to propylene on the 14-KPtSn catalyst was similar to that on 00-KPtSn catalyst. The C

yields of 00-KPtSn and 14-KPtSn catalysts. PDH was carried out at 873 K for 15 h. The initial conversions of 00-KPtSn and 14-KPtSn catalyst were 28.6 and 25.9, respectively, and the final conversions after 15 h were decreased to 22.8 and 20.0 %, respectively. The deactivation parameters were almost similar in both catalysts. The C

selectivity in 00-KPtSn and 14-KPtSn catalyst was 87.6 and 92.2 % after 15 h of reaction, respectively. The above results indicates that the addition of potassium mainly reduces the formation of higher hydrocarbons, which improves the C

Pt is an active component for PDH. Therefore, the activity of Pt-based catalysts depends on the Pt dispersion (Fig. 6; Table 4). Side reactions such as cracking and higher hydrocarbon formation occur on Pt surfaces in PDH. The side reactions not only lowered the selectivity to propylene, but also deactivated the Pt catalyst by the formation of coke. It was reported that the Sn addition to Pt suppressed the cracking sites, thereby improving both the stability and the selectivity to propylene [29]. Nonetheless, the higher hydrocarbon formation was still significant. The potassium addition to the PtSn catalyst significantly decreased the acid sites on the PtSn catalyst (Fig. 3; Table 2). The blocking of the acid sites on PtSn catalyst improved both the selectivity and the stability further (Fig. 6; Table 5). The main cause of the deactivation was due to the formation of coke (Table 4). The coke formation came from the cracking sites on the Pt component and the acid sites. The addition of 0.15 and 0.25 wt% K to PtSn reduced the amount of coke, but further K addition rather promoted coke formation. Therefore, formation of coke by further K addition to the PtSn catalysts is not related to the acid sites, but to the cracking sites on the PtSn component. On the other hand, K addition promoted the reduction of Sn oxide on the support (Fig. 4; Table 3). The enhanced Sn oxide reduction resulted in enriching the reduced Sn metal (δ peaks in Fig. 4). The high amount K addition rather weakened the PtSn interaction similarly to PtSn catalysts with high Sn contents (29), resulting in large Pt particles, as shown in TEM images (Fig. 5).
Conclusion
KPtSn/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with different amounts of potassium (0.14, 0.22, 0.49, 0.72 and 0.96 wt%) were prepared by an impregnation method, and their catalytic activity in PDH was investigated at 873 K, at atmospheric pressure with a GHSV of 53,000 mL (gcat h)−1. The acidity of the catalyst decreased with an increase in K loading. The 00-KPtSn catalyst showed a selectivity to C1–C2 of 6.4 %, a selectivity to higher hydrocarbons of 4.6 % and a coke amount of 0.6 wt%, resulting in the low C
=

selectivity (89.0 %). When potassium was added to the 00-KPtSn catalyst up to 0.49 wt%, both of the selectivity to the higher hydrocarbons and the coke amount were minimized to 1.0–1.1 % and 0.4–0.12 wt%, respectively. Further potassium addition rather increased the selectivity to C1–C2 of 6.4 %, the selectivity to higher hydrocarbons of 4.6 % and the coke amount. From these experimental results, Sn addition suppressed the cracking sites on the Pt catalysts, while the potassium addition blocked the acid sites on the PtSn catalysts. The K addition to the 00-KPtSn catalyst minimized the higher hydrocarbon formation by blocking the acid sites. On the other hand, the K addition more than 0.49 wt% rather increased the cracking products, indicating that the interaction between Pt and Sn was weakened by the K addition. The K addition promoted the reduction of Sn oxide and the enriched Sn metal weakened the interaction between Pt and Sn similarly to the PtSn catalysts with the high amount of Sn.
