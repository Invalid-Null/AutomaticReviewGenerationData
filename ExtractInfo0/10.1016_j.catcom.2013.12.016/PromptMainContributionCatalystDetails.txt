Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of 1-butene to 1,3-butadiene using CO2




1. Introduction
1,3-Butadiene is an important raw material in manufacturing industry, being an essential monomer for producing widely used rubbers such as styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) [1], [2]. In addition, BD is a key intermediate for manufacturing adiponitrile, chloroprene, sulfolane, 4-vinylcyclohexene, among other chemicals [3], [4], [5]. Currently, BD is mainly produced by steam cracking of hydrocarbons [6]. This process mixes hydrocarbon feedstock with steam and then the mixture is heated to extremely high temperature (usually over 850 °C) [1]. After a complex and expensive separation process, BD is extracted by aprotic polar solvent from crude C4 raffinates [7]. Feedstocks such as naphtha and gas oil can produce 15–20% BD content [6]. However, in recent years, the usage of natural gas and refinery waste gas was increased as cracker feedstock. In addition, the vast reserves of shale gas will certainly increase this trend. Unfortunately, only a very small amount (1–5%) of BD is obtained by using gas as feedstock, leading to a shortage of BD supply [6]. However, the requirement of BD is expected to grow quickly. In 2011, the global consumption of BD was 10.5 million tons and it was predicted to reach 13 million tons by 2015, with 3–4% annual increment. To meet the quick increasing BD demand, alternative processes to provide BD to the market are required.
Among various processes for producing BD, catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of 1-butene is the most widely investigated since 1-butene can be obtained from natural gas condensates and refinery waste gasses [6]. ODH process has the advantages of low energy consumption [8], [9] and low greenhouse gas emission [10], [11], as it requires lower reaction temperature than other processes like direct dehydrogenation. The oxidant not only initiates the dehydrogenation by removing hydrogen from the allyl position [7], but also regenerates the catalyst in situ [12]. To the best of our knowledge, only the ODH of 1-butene to BD using oxygen as oxidant was reported [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. However, the strong oxidation capacity of oxygen often led to low BD selectivity and high C1–C3 yield [18], [19], [20]. Enlightened by the usage of CO2 as mild oxidant in the ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene [18], [21], [22], [23], [24] and propane to propene [25], [26], [27], we have explored the usage of CO2 as soft oxidant in this study, aiming to improve both BD selectivity and yield. To the best of our knowledge, the use of CO2 as a soft oxidant is reported for the first time in this contribution. In addition, the use of CO2 may have other advantages, such as minimization of hot-spots [21], [23], [28] and low explosion risks [10], [23].
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
In this study, metal oxide samples, e.g. Fe2O3, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. For Fe2O3/Al2O3 and Fe2O3/SiO2 catalyst, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (≥ 98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as precursor and loaded onto the supports by wet impregnation method.
2.2. TPSR investigation
Preliminary screening of metal oxides was carried out using Temperature Programmed Surface Reaction (TPSR) using a continuous fixed-bed reactor and a HPR 20 QMS Sampling System (Hiden Analytical). The reaction mixture consisted of 1-butene and CO2 with a 1:9 molar ratio. 50 mg catalyst was loaded into a quartz tube (diameter 3.7 mm, sample length ca. 1.5 cm) and pretreated with 30 ml/min helium at 400 °C for 1 h to remove moisture and impurities. After cooling down to 200 °C, the inlet gas was switched to 30 ml/min of reaction mixture. After a stabilization period of 10 min, the reactor furnace was ramped from 200 °C to 800 °C using a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The outlet gasses, including hydrogen, CO, CO2, 1-butene and BD, were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS).
2.3. Catalytic reaction tests
Catalytic activity tests were also conducted in the continuous fixed-bed reactor. 100 mg of catalyst was loaded in quartz tube, with quartz wool as support. Before the catalytic activity tests, the sample was pretreated under 30 ml/min helium at 400 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was also fed at 30 ml/min. The products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent, 6890 N). The front column for the flame ionization detector (FID) is Agilent CP7431 (Select Al2O3 MAPD, 50.0 m × 320 μm × 50.0 μm), while the back column for the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) is Agilent CP7375 (CarboBOND, 50.0 m × 320 μm × 10.0 μm). The GC oven was ramped from 40 °C to 180 °C, with 15 °C/min ramping rate. The hold time at 180 °C was 6 min.
As CO2 amount was in excess and its conversion was not determined, conversion and selectivity are defined as following:
2.4. Characterizations
Surface area and pore size distribution of the samples were measured using a Micromeritic ASAP 2420 instrument. Elemental analysis was performed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) in a Bruker S4 Explorer Spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Bruker D8 advance powder diffractometer with monochromatic Cu K-Alpha radiation. Ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiments were carried out using a Thermo Scientific TPROD 1100, with adsorption and purging temperatures at 150 °C.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Blank test
In order to prove that catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of 1-butene to 1,3-butadiene (BD) with CO2 can occur, a blank test was first conducted using an empty tube. Two experiments were performed: 1) blank test, using premixed 1-butene and CO2 with a 1:9 volume ratio, and 2) helium diluted 1-butene (premixed 1-butene and helium with a 1:9 volume ratio). It should be noted that MS cannot distinguish 1-butene and its isomers, so we treated all the isomers as 1-butene in the analysis of these MS results. A logarithmic vertical axis was used, to provide a better visualization of the results.
As shown in Fig. 1(a), BD can be produced using helium/1-butene mixture as feeding gas. However, BD production peak was only observed at ca. 770 °C. Within the peak range, hydrogen concentration was also increased, indicating the presence of direct dehydrogenation (1-butene → BD + H2). In Fig. 1(b), the presence of CO2 slightly shifted the appearance of BD to lower temperature (ca. 750 °C). Within the peak range, CO and H2O concentrations were clearly increased, demonstrating that CO2 is involved in ODH reaction (1-butene + CO2 → BD + CO + H2O). In the same range, hydrogen concentration was also increased. The hydrogen may come from direct dehydrogenation as observed in Fig. 1(a). In addition, the ODH products, CO and H2O, may also produce hydrogen through water–gas shift (WGS) reaction (CO + H2O → CO2 + H2). So in this study, the increasing amount of CO and H2O confirms that CO2 is involved in ODH, while the increase of hydrogen may result from either direct dehydrogenation or WGS.

3.2. Catalytic test using metal oxides
It was shown that CO2 can oxidatively dehydrogenate 1-butene to BD at a slightly lower temperature than direct dehydrogenation. However, the required temperature is still too high. Usually, ODH reactions take place through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [13], [17], [19]. As shown in these papers, butene can be converted into BD by reacting with the lattice oxygen of metal oxides. Then the reduced species is re-oxidized by an oxidant, usually air or oxygen. According to this redox mechanism, several transition metal oxides were preliminary tested in this study, i.e. Fe2O3, MoO3, and Bi2O3. Among the tested samples, Fe2O3 gives the best performance, producing the larger amount of BD at the lowest temperature. As the most representative one, the TPSR pattern of Fe2O3 is shown in Fig. 2. In the presence of Fe2O3, the high temperature BD peak is further shifted to even lower temperature (ca. 730 °C). Meanwhile, an additional BD production peak is found at quite low temperature (ca. 410 °C).

Within this low temperature peak range, CO concentration was slightly increased, suggesting the engagement of CO2. However, H2O concentration was increased simultaneously, while the hydrogen concentration was only slightly increased, indicating that BD was mainly produced by ODH reaction. In the high temperature peak range, ODH was quite strong as both CO and H2O were significantly increased. Between the two peaks, no BD formation was observed. This suggests that BD formation via ODH takes place until complete consumption of lattice oxygen in Fe2O3 (0.939 mmol for 50 mg Fe2O3, assuming that all oxygen atoms can be utilized). Therefore, it seems that the redox cycle does not readily occur.
3.3. Supported iron oxide
BET analysis showed that the surface area of commercial Fe2O3 is quite low (14.7 m2/g). Therefore, to overcome this issue, supported iron oxide samples were prepared. Two common supports, Al2O3 and SiO2, were used to support Fe2O3. For both samples, 10 wt.% Fe2O3 was loaded. The corresponding TPSR patterns are shown in Fig. 3, being quite different.

The low temperature peak for 10 wt.% Fe2O3/SiO2 is quite weak, which may be due to low dispersion of Fe2O3 species onto SiO2. The BD production was weak until 570 °C, indicating a weak redox cycle.
For 10 wt.% Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, the BD concentration is also significantly lower than that of Fe2O3 sample. However, the BD concentration continuously increases from 360 °C, indicating that the redox cycle occurs readily. Comparing the TPSR pattern of Fe2O3/Al2O3 with the one obtained on bare Al2O3, it is clear that the low temperature BD production is mainly due to the presence of Fe2O3.
Aiming to explain the significant difference between 10 wt.% Fe2O3/SiO2 and 10 wt.% Fe2O3/Al2O3, both samples were further characterized. XRF confirms the expected Fe2O3 loading, 10 wt.% on both supports. BET results indicate that both sample exhibit similar surface area, ca. 250 m2/g. XRD patterns showed no crystalline Fe2O3 phase for 10 wt.% Fe2O3/Al2O3, demonstrating the existence of small particle sizes and high dispersion of Fe2O3. Contrarily, for 10 wt.% Fe2O3/SiO2, XRD peaks confirms the existence of large and well crystallized Fe2O3 particles with hematite structure. This clearly highlights the importance of particle size and dispersion. NH3-TPD was conducted to compare their acidity/basicity properties. It was found that the acidity of 10 wt.% Fe2O3/Al2O3 is significantly higher than that of 10 wt.% Fe2O3/SiO2. Since it is commonly accepted that acidity affects both adsorption and surface reactions, our results may indicate that acid sites are also involved in ODH reaction.
3.4. Catalytic test in a fixed-bed reactor
After confirming that low temperature BD production on Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalyst occurs, further conventional catalytic tests under isothermal conditions were conducted at the optimum temperature range. The reaction products were analyzed on-line using a GC, after 30 min of time on stream. In addition, butene isomers can be easily separated and quantified. Fe2O3, Al2O3 and Fe2O3/Al2O3 were tested under the same reaction conditions.
In Fig. 4, conversion and selectivity are compared at 600 °C, which was found to give the best catalytic performance, in terms of BD yield and selectivity. For Fe2O3 sample, both conversion (16.4%) and BD selectivity (16.4%) are quite low, thus giving very low BD yield (2.7%). The 1-butene conversion for Al2O3 reaches 72.1%, which is much higher than that of Fe2O3. However, the BD selectivity is pretty low (6.5%), again resulting in a very low BD yield (4.7%).

With Fe2O3 impregnated on Al2O3 support, both conversion and BD selectivity are significantly improved. At 600 °C, 10 wt.% Fe2O3/Al2O3 shows 77.1% conversion and 21.8% BD selectivity. The main by-products are trans-2-butene 33.3%, cis-2-butene 25.6%, iso-butene 1.4%, butane 1.1%, propane 2.9%, ethene 2.2% and methane 5.7%. Thus, the BD yield is greatly improved from 2.7% on Fe2O3 and 4.7% on Al2O3 support to 16.8% on Fe2O3/Al2O3 sample. This result clearly indicates that highly dispersed Fe2O3 on an acidic Al2O3 support leads to a significantly more efficient redox cycle between 1-butene/BD–CO2/CO–Fe oxides.
3.5. 2-Butene as reactant
As shown in Fig. 4, trans-2-butene and cis-2-butene are the major byproducts. Considering that they are isomers of 1-butene, 2-butene was also used as feedstock in order to check if 2-butene is also converted into BD. Experiments were performed using trans/cis-2-butene/CO2 mixture, with a molar ratio 1:9. The ratio between trans-2-butene and cis-2-butene was 1:1. According to Table 1, similar catalytic performance is obtained regardless whether 1-butene or 2-butene is used as reactant, suggesting that trans/cis-2-butene produced in the ODH reaction of 1-butene could be recycled for further producing BD. In addition, 1-butene was also observed when 2-butene was used as feedstock, suggesting that isomerization reaction readily occurs. The different conversion and selectivity observed when 1-butene or 2-butene is used as feedstock may be due to the isomerization equilibrium. Therefore, this process is very promising for producing BD.
Table 1. Comparison of catalytic activity using either 1-butene or 2-butene feedstock.
Feeding gas Conversion/BD selectivity/BD yield (%)
500 °C 550 °C 600 °C
1-Butene/CO2 72.5/4.7/3.4 75.3/5.6/4.2 77.1/21.8/16.8
2-Butene/CO2 33.8/13.6/4.6 37.7/17.9/6.7 48.2/31.1/15.0
Reaction condition: 100 mg sample; 30 ml/min helium pretreatment, 400 °C for 1 h; 30 ml/min; 1:9 butene/CO2 mixtures.
Based on the fact that both 1-butene and trans/cis-2-butene produce almost the same BD yield, a simple reaction mechanism is suggested in Fig. 5. In the first step, both 1-butene and 2-butene can be absorbed in an activated form, most likely through a delocalized π bond. This activation step is mainly controlled by the acid sites since bare Al2O3 is able to isomerize 1-butene. Then, the activated butene can be converted into BD on suitable metal oxide sites.

4. Conclusion
In this work, the feasibility of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of 1-butene to 1,3-butadiene (BD) using CO2 as soft oxidant is reported for the first time. Temperature Programmed Surface Reaction (TPSR) patterns show that ODH takes place to produce BD involving CO2. Fe2O3, the most promising metal oxide among the screening ones, is able to promote the ODH, though its catalytic activity is quite low. Al2O3 supported Fe2O3 significantly improves the catalytic activity.
The main by-products of 1-butene ODH, trans/cis-2-butenes, can also be converted into BD under the same reaction conditions with similar catalytic performance. Based on this fact, a reaction mechanism is suggested: both 1-butene and 2-butene can be absorbed on acid sites in an activated form. Then the activated butene can be converted into BD on suitable metal oxide sites.
