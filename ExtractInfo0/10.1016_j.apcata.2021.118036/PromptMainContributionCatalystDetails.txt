1. Introduction
The conversion of light alkanes to value-added chemicals is motivated by the increasing availability of cheap shale gas, which is mainly composed of methane, ethane, and propane [[1], [2], [3]]. The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene (C3H8 ↔ C3H6 + H2) is of great importance because of the growing demand for propene as a raw material for the production of polypropylene, propene oxide, and acrylic acid [3,4]. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic reaction. Thus, a high reaction temperature (≥ 550 °C) is required to achieve sufficient equilibrium conversion. In addition to Pt, many metal oxides such as CrOx, GaOx, ZrOx, VOx, InOx, FeOx, and WOx have been studied as active materials for PDH [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]].
In the case of the supported metal oxides for PDH, the surface concentration, reducibility, and oxidation state of the metal oxide species depend on the interaction between metal oxide and support. The changes in these properties can significantly affect the catalytic performance. For CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/SiO2, the most extensively studied metal oxide catalyst for PDH, in-situ X-ray absorption near edge structures (XANES) and operando Raman analysis showed that the change in the oxidation state of Cr cation from Cr6+ to Cr3+ increases the catalytic performance [16,17]. The weakening of the interaction of Cr species with support by addition of other components such as Cu and Ni enhances reducibility and therefore, catalytic performance [18,19].
CoOx-based catalysts have been widely used in important heterogeneous catalysis, such as the Fischer-Tropsch reaction [[20], [21], [22], [23], [24]]. Recently, CoOx has been suggested as a promising catalyst for PDH [[25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]]. Similar to other metal oxide catalysts, the oxidation state of Co species on supports affects the catalytic performance for PDH. Lewis acidic Co2+ species in CoO phase leads to higher activity than the Co species in the Co3O4 phase [[26], [27], [28]]. Moreover, Co/Al2O3 catalysts with Co0 species exhibit higher performance, suggesting that metallic Co is the most active Co species for PDH [29,30]. However, the characterization by ex-situ techniques has hampered both the direct identification of the oxidation state of the most active Co species and quantification of the amount of each Co species. The difficulty arises from the fact that the Co species are easily re-oxidized in ex-situ conditions and are present in a mixed oxidation state. Consequently, in-situ quantification of the oxidation state of Co species in CoOx-based catalysts is required to elucidate the active sites for PDH.
The physico-chemical properties such as surface concentration, dispersion, reducibility, and oxidation state of Co species are strongly influenced by the interaction with supports [21,[31], [32], [33]]. The Co nanoparticles are well-dispersed on Al2O3 support but inner diffusion of Co species into Al2O3 lattice and formation of Co-Al mixed oxide by strong interaction weaken the reducibility of Co species [20,30,31]. There are several reports that the interaction between Co species and Al2O3 can be modified by the addition of other components such as La, P, and Ce [[34], [35], [36], [37]]. The modification enhances the reducibility or increase surface concentration of Co species. In this work, alumina-supported Co-V oxide catalysts with various loadings of Co and V are prepared to improve catalytic performance for PDH. The influences of V doping on the change of properties of Co species including surface concentration, reducibility, and oxidation state and on the performance are investigated by comparing those of CoOx/Al2O3 catalyst. Systematic characterization of the catalysts shows that the enhanced performance of Co-V oxide catalysts is associated with the increase of surface concentration of metallic Co on the Al2O3 support by the V content.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Alumina-supported Co-V oxide catalysts were prepared via wetness impregnation with a solution of Co(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar, 98–102%) and NH4VO3 (ACROS, 99.5%). Specific quantities of the precursors were dissolved in deionized water with oxalic acid (Sigma Aldrich, 99%). Then, a γ-Al2O3 support with a surface area of 140–170 m2⋅g–1 (Puralox SCCa 5/150, Sasol) was impregnated in the solution overnight at 55 °C under stirring. After the evaporation of the solvent, the sample was dried at 120 °C for 12 h and subsequently calcined at 550 °C for 6 h under air. For all Co-V oxide catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, the total loading of Co and V was set to 5 wt% because both Co and V species are active for PDH. The supported Co-V oxide catalysts were labeled as xCo-yV, where x and y (
) denote the loading of Co and V, respectively. For example, 5Co represents a catalyst of 5 wt% Co supported on γ-Al2O3 and 2.5Co-2.5V indicates a catalyst of 2.5 wt% Co and 2.5 wt% V on γ-Al2O3. For comparison of the states of the Co and V species in the xCo-yV catalysts, Co3O4 (Sigma Aldrich), CoO (Sigma Aldrich), V2O5 (Sigma Aldrich, ≥98%), V2O4 (Sigma Aldrich, ≥99%), and V2O3 (Sigma Aldrich, 98%) were used as reference samples.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out at the BL15XU NIMS beamline at SPring-8, Japan. The incident energy of the synchrotron X-ray beam was fixed at 29.022 keV using a Si (311) monochromator with an undulator. The crystallite size of the CoOx phase was calculated by the Scherrer equation. The Scherrer equation is expressed as D = Kλ/βcosθ, where D is the average crystalline size, K is the shape factor (K = 0.9 if the shape of nanoparticles is spherical), λ is the X-ray wavelength, β is the full width at half maximum (radians) of an observed peak, and θ is the Bragg angle. Raman spectra were obtained from the powder sample using WITec alpha 300 R confocal Raman microscope with a resolution of 1 cm−1 and an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. The bulk compositions of the samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on a SPECTRO ARCOS FHM22 spectrometer. Nitrogen physisorption was carried out at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 system. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were calculated using data obtained over the relative pressure range of 0.05 ≤ p/p0 ≤ 0.2. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100 F FE-TEM at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV at the National Institute for Nanomaterials Technology (NINT), Pohang, South Korea. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) under ultra-high vacuum at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Busan, South Korea. The binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was conducted on a BELCAT II using 100 mg of sample. Prior to NH3-TPD, the sample was reduced in a stream of 10 vol% H2/He gas mixture (total 50 sccm) at 550 °C for 1 h. Next, the sample was cooled to 120 °C in a He flow. After the temperature was stabilized at 120 °C, the pre-reduced sample was exposed to a 5 vol% NH3/He gas mixture (total 50 sccm) for 30 min and cooled to 80 °C in a He flow. The sample was then heated from 80 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a He flow (30 sccm). The amount of ammonia desorbed from the sample was monitored using a mass spectrometer. The reducibility of the catalysts was investigated by H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) using a BELCAT II. The sample was reduced in a stream of a 5 vol% H2/Ar gas mixture (total 30 sccm) from 30 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The amount of consumed H2 was monitored using a thermal conducting detector (TCD). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a HITACHI STA 7300 using 10 mg of the spent sample. The sample was charged into sample pan and then heated to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in an air flow (40 sccm).
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were performed simultaneously in the transmission and fluorescence mode at the P65 beamline, DESY, Hamburg, Germany [38,39]. A Si(111) monochromator was used to scan the energies near the Co K-edge and V K-edge. Additionally, the Si mirror was used to eliminate the higher-order harmonics. The transmission signal was measured using a gas ionization chamber using nitrogen, argon, and their mixture to achieve an optimized signal at the metal K-edges. The integrated fluorescence signal was measured using a passivated implanted planar silicon detector. XAS measurements on the catalyst samples were carried out in a reactor made from a quartz capillary with a diameter of 1.5 mm and wall thickness of 0.01 mm. The capillary was supported on a stainless-steel holder with the open ends glued to the holder. The ends of the capillary were used to feed the gas and collect the exhaust, and the exit end was also connected to a mass spectrometer to monitor the reaction product and gas environment around the catalyst powder. The catalyst powder in the capillary was heated using a heat blower placed beneath the capillary. In-situ XAS measurement was performed in a stream of 20 vol% H2/He gas mixture (total 20 sccm) while heating the catalyst from 20 to 550 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Normalization of the XAS data was performed following the standard procedure in the Athena software [40].
2.3. Catalytic tests
The catalytic performances of the xCo-yV catalysts for PDH were evaluated under ambient pressure using a tubular fixed-bed quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 4 mm. The flow rates of each gas were regulated using calibrated mass flow controllers. The reaction temperature was measured using a type-K thermocouple positioned at the top of the catalyst bed inside the quartz reactor and controlled by a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. The powder catalyst was pelletized to obtain a uniform grain size of 425–850 μm and 50 or 100 mg of the catalyst was used for the catalytic tests. Prior to the reaction, the reactor was heated to the reaction temperature (550 °C) under Ar flow for 1 h. Subsequently, the loaded catalyst was pretreated at 550 °C via either reduction or oxidation. Pre-reduction was performed in a flow of a 50 vol% H2/Ar gas mixture for 1 h, and pre-oxidation was conducted in a flow of a 50 vol% Air/Ar mixture for 10 min. After purging the reactor with Ar for 15 min, a gas mixture of 1 sccm C3H8 and 19 sccm Ar (WHSVpropane =1.2 h−1) was introduced into the reactor to evaluate the catalytic performance. The propene formation rate was determined using 50 mg of catalyst in a flow of 4 sccm C3H8 and 36 sccm (WHSVpropane =9.5 h−1), where the conversion was below 10%. The gas compositions of the reactant and products were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (YL6500, Younglin Instrument Co., Korea) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The propane conversion Xpropane, Selectivity Si, Carbon balance Cbalance, propene yield Ypropene, and propene formation rate rpropene were calculated as follows:
where npropane is the number of moles of propane, ni is the number of moles of the C1-C3 products (CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H6), ai is the number of carbon atoms in the corresponding product, Fpropene is the molar flow rate of propene and W is the weight of the catalyst.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Bulk and surface characterization
To understand the characteristics of Co and V oxides on γ-Al2O3, the bulk and surface properties of the as-prepared xCo-yV catalysts were investigated. The metal contents and surface areas of the prepared xCo-yV catalysts are summarized in Table 1. The as-prepared xCo-yV catalysts had similar surface areas of 143–162 m2⋅g–1. The powder XRD patterns of the 5Co catalyst showed peaks corresponding to Co3O4 or CoAl2O4 with a spinel structure and γ-Al2O3 phase (Fig. 1). The 2θ values of 5.25°, 8.58°, 10.1°, 10.5°, 12.1°, 14.9°, and 15.8° corresponded to the (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), and (511) reflections from the Co oxide phases, respectively. The phase of the Co oxide for 5Co could not be determined solely from the XRD patterns because both the Co3O4 and CoAl2O4 phases have peaks at nearly the same positions. There was no change in the peak positions despite the addition of V. This indicated that there was no formation of solid solution between the Co and V oxides in the xCo-yV catalysts. Except 1Co-4V, the crystallite size of the CoOx in the xCo-yV catalysts could be calculated by the Scherrer equation using the (511) reflection. The estimated size was 7.5 nm for the 5Co, 16.1 nm for the 4Co-1V, and 11.9 nm for the 2.5Co-2.5V. The presence of V led to a noticeable increase in the crystalline size of CoOx in the 4Co-1V. However, the decrease in Co content dominantly affected the size of CoOx in the 2.5Co-2.5V, resulting in a smaller size than that of 4Co-1V. It is also interesting that none of the V-containing catalysts had a peak that corresponded to the VOx phases. This indicated that VOx species was present in highly dispersed form.

Fig. 1. Wide-angle XRD patterns of the as-prepared xCo-yV catalysts taken using synchrotron radiation. They reveal that the Co oxide is in the Co3O4 or CoAl2O4 phase, while V oxide is in highly dispersed state.
Representative TEM and EDS images of the xCo-yV catalysts confirmed that the V species were uniformly dispersed on the support, while Co species formed nanocrystallites of Co oxide, not Co-Al mixed oxide (Fig. S1). Only in the case of 1Co-4V, CoOx species were well-dispersed due to low Co content. The observed sizes of CoOx in the images were consistent with those estimated by XRD analysis. The Raman spectra of xCo-yV catalysts also revealed the phase of CoOx and VOx in the xCo-yV catalysts (Fig. S2). The 5Co, 4Co-1V, and 2.5Co-2.5V catalysts exhibited intense bands, corresponding to Co3O4 phase. However, no bands related to CoOx were observed for the 1Co-4V and 5V catalysts. All V-containing catalysts exhibited a band, corresponding to the dispersed mono-oxo vanadium oxide species, whereas they showed no bands assigned to V2O5 phase [41]. This observation was consistent with the XRD, TEM, and EDS results, showing the presence of highly dispersed V species instead of V2O5 crystals.
The surface acidity of the xCo-yV catalysts were investigated by NH3-TPD (Fig. S3). The amount of weak acid sites, represented by the desorption peak between 200–300 °C, decreased as increasing the composition of V. Instead, the increase in the V content led to the generation of strong acid sites, showing the growth of the desorption peak between 450–700 °C. The total amount of acid sites was also slightly increased from 0.24 mmol⋅g–1 for the 5Co to 0.29 mmol⋅g–1 for the 5V (Table 1). These results were consistent with the previous studies showing the strong acidic property of V species [42,43].
The binding energies and relative surface concentrations of Co and V analyzed by XPS are listed in Table 2. The Co 2p and V 2p core-level spectra of the as-prepared xCo-yV catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. The Co 2p spectrum of the reference CoO sample exhibited a clear satellite peak at ∼786 eV, while that of the reference Co3O4 sample showed a slight peak due to the mixed oxidation states of Co3+ and Co2+ (Fig. S4) [44,45]. Comparison of the Co 2p spectra of the xCo-yV catalysts with those of the reference samples indicated that the Co species in the catalysts were mainly Co3O4 because the satellite feature at ∼786 eV was not obvious. The Co 2p3/2 peak of the 5Co catalyst showed a shift of ∼1 eV toward a higher binding energy (780.5 eV) when compared to that of the Co3O4 sample (779.6 eV). The higher binding energy and broadness of the Co 2p peaks suggested the presence of additional Co species which strongly interacted with alumina, such as amorphous Co-Al mixed oxide and/or CoAl2O4 [33,45,46].

Fig. 2. X-ray photoelectron core-level spectra of (a) Co 2p and (b) V 2p for the as-prepared xCo-yV samples. Dashed lines represent the binding energies of the Co 2p3/2 peak for Co3O4 and of the V 2p3/2 peak for V2O4 and V2O5, respectively. The lower binding energy of the Co 2p3/2 peak for 2.5Co-2.5V compared to that of 5Co suggests the prevention of the formation of strongly interacting Co-Al mixed oxide by V content.
The presence of the V component led to the shift of the Co 2p peaks to a lower binding energy. As the V loading increased, the Co 2p3/2 peak shifted from 780.5 eV to 780.0 eV for 4Co-1V and to 779.6 eV for 2.5Co-2.5V. The Co 2p spectrum of a reference catalyst, 2.5Co, showed the Co 2p3/2 peak with binding energy at 781.1 eV (Fig. S5). Comparison of the binding energies of the Co 2p peaks for 2.5Co-2.5V with those for 2.5Co confirmed that this peak shift was attributed to the addition of V component. It should be noted again that presence of the Co species which strongly interacted with the Al2O3 support, resulted in the shift of Co 2p peaks to higher binding energies as observed for 5Co. The fact that the Co 2p peaks for 2.5Co-2.5V had the same binding energies as those for the reference Co3O4 sample, which was not supported on Al2O3, suggested that V component in the 2.5Co-2.5V weakened the interactions of the Co species with Al2O3. A similar changes in interactions between Co species and Al2O3 support have been reported for Co-based oxide catalysts in the presence of a second metal [34,35,45]. The Co 2p3/2 peak for 1Co-4V shifted again to a higher binding energy (781.2 eV), despite a higher V content. This result agreed with the observation that well-dispersed Co at low loading formed two-dimensional Co-Al oxide layered structures through epitaxial interactions with the Al2O3 support [20,47]. The V 2p3/2 core-level spectra of the xCo-yV catalysts showed that V species had mixed oxidation states of V4+ (515.9 eV) and V5+ (517.2 eV), exhibiting peaks at 516.4–516.9 eV [48,49]. A gradual peak shift toward higher binding energy with increasing V content showed the oligomerization of surface VOx species [41,[50], [51], [52]].
The surface concentration of each component measured by XPS was compared with the bulk concentration measured by ICP (Fig. 3). The surface concentration of Co in the 5Co catalyst was only 1.4 mol% in cations, while the bulk concentration corresponded to 4.3 mol%. This considerable surface deficiency of Co seemed to arise from the diffusion of Co cations into the sublayer of the Al2O3 support during the calcination step, which is related to the strong interactions between the Co species and the support [20,30,53]. Compared to 5Co, the surface concentration of Co in 4Co-1V and 2.5Co-2.5V gradually increased, despite a decrease in the Co content. In particular, the 2.5Co-2.5V catalyst revealed noticeable Co enrichment with a surface concentration of 4.4 mol%. However, in the case of a reference sample, 2.5Co, the Co concentration on the surface was only 1.1 mol%. A comparison with 5Co clearly showed that the added V species led to the surface enrichment of Co in 2.5Co-2.5V. It should be emphasized that the 2.5Co-2.5V had lower binding energies for the Co 2p peaks than those of 5Co. This observation suggested that the presence of the V component in 2.5Co-2.5V prevented the generation of the Co species strongly interacting with the Al2O3 support, which was observed for 5Co. Consequently, it can be inferred that the surface enrichment of Co in 2.5Co-2.5V was attributed to the weakening of the interactions between Co and Al2O3. Further decrease in Co content led to a decrease in the concentration of surface Co in 1Co-4V. In the case of the V component, the surface concentration of V linearly increased with the total V content. This result indicated that Co content had little effect on surface V species and was consistent with the TEM and EDS images showing highly dispersed V species on the surface of the xCo-yV catalysts.

Fig. 3. Surface concentration of (a) Co and (b) V of xCo-yV catalysts measured by XPS as a function of the bulk concentration, measured by ICP. 2.5Co-2.5V catalyst exhibits a noticeable surface enrichment of Co species, indicating the highest Co concentration of 4.4 mol%. The surface concentration of V linearly increases with the total concentration, showing no surface enrichment nor deficiency.
The XPS results suggested that the V content in the xCo-yV catalysts modified the interactions between Co species and Al2O3 support. This change can also affect the reducibility and oxidation state of the xCo-yV catalysts. Thus, the reducibility of the as-prepared catalysts was investigated by H2-TPR. The TPR profiles are shown in Fig. 4, and the H2 consumption is listed in Table 1. The 5Co catalyst exhibited a broad peak in the 350−750 °C range. A comparison with the profile of the reference Co3O4 sample showed that the peak in the lower temperature range of 350−500 °C corresponded to the reduction of the Co3O4 phase, while the peak in the higher temperature range of 500−750 °C corresponded to the reduction of strongly interacting Co-Al mixed oxide (Fig. S6) [[31], [32], [33],53,54]. Several metal oxide catalysts reveal higher performance for PDH after H2 pretreatment. Assuming the pretreatment at 550 °C, which is a PDH reaction temperature, the average oxidation state of the Co species in 5Co was estimated to be +1.4 from the amount of H2 consumption. The TPR results suggested that a considerable amount of Co species could be present as CoO after the pre-reduction. The incomplete reduction of Co species was associated with the formation of hardly reducible Co-Al mixed oxide. The TPR profile for the 5V catalyst exhibited a peak at approximately 470 °C. The average oxidation state of V corresponded to +3.7, assuming pretreatment by H2 at 550 °C. This showed that most V5+ species could be easily reduced to V4+ by the pretreatment. The absence of a peak over 600 °C in the TPR spectrum, corresponding to the reduction of bulk VOx, confirmed again that V species on the Al2O3 support were highly dispersed [[55], [56], [57]].

Fig. 4. H2-TPR profiles of as-prepared xCo-yV catalysts. The 5Co catalyst exhibits a broad peak at 500-750 °C, attributed to the reduction of the strongly interacting Co-Al mixed oxide. The presence of V species in the xCo-yV catalysts leads to the appearance of new peaks at 300-400 °C, showing improvement in reducibility.
In the case of the xCo-yV catalysts, the average oxidation state of Co and V species could not be clearly determined due to the simultaneous reduction of both species. However, the change in peak position and the amount of H2 consumption below 550 °C indicated an improvement in the reducibility of the xCo-yV catalysts. Compared to the TPR spectrum of 5Co, the presence of V species in the xCo-yV led to the disappearance of a broad peak at 500−750 °C, associated with the reduction of strongly interacting Co-Al mixed oxide. Instead, new peaks, representing the formation of easily reducible Co species with weaker interaction with alumina, appeared at lower temperatures of 300−400 °C. [30,31,58]. In particular, the 2.5Co-2.5V catalyst showed the largest amount of H2 consumption at temperatures below 550 °C, showing the greatest improvement in reducibility.
3.2. In-situ XAS analyses
The weakening of the interactions between Co species and Al2O3 support and improvement of reducibility of xCo-yV catalysts in the presence of the V component could significantly affect the oxidation state of the pre-reduced catalyst. To clarify the oxidation state of the pre-reduced catalysts, in-situ XAS analyses were also performed under H2 reduction conditions. Normalized XANES spectra at the Co K-edge and V K-edge of the 5Co, 5V, and 2.5Co-2.5V catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. The phase and oxidation states of the Co species in 5Co and 2.5Co-2.5V were assigned by comparison with the spectra at the Co K-edge of the reference samples, which were Co foil (Co0), CoO (Co2+), and Co3O4 (Co2+/Co3+). As shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), 5Co and 2.5Co-2.5V showed very similar spectra to that of the reference Co3O4 sample at the beginning of the H2 treatment (black lines), showing that the Co species were mainly in the form of Co3+ and Co2+. Moreover, the similar intensity of pre-edges of 5Co and 2.5Co-2.5V at 7709 eV to that of Co3O4 ruled out the formation of CoAl2O4, which shows stronger pre-edge [21]. The H2 treatment of 5Co and 2.5Co-2.5V with increasing the temperature led to a shift of the main edge to a lower energy. The XANES spectrum of 5Co at 550 °C (red line) with a white line at 7724 eV indicated that most Co species were present as Co2+. Moreover, the slight increase in the intensity of the shoulder at 7711 eV indicated the formation of Co0 during the H2 pretreatment. At 550 °C, the XANES spectrum of the 2.5Co-2.5V catalyst resembled that of Co foil, indicating that most Co species were reduced to Co0. These results confirmed the facile reduction of the Co3O4 phase to the metallic Co phase in the presence of the V component.

Fig. 5. Normalized XANES spectra at the Co K-edge of (a) 5Co and (b) 2.5Co-2.5V and at the V K-edge of (c) 5V and (d) 2.5Co-2.5V under H2 atmosphere. Dashed lines represent the spectra of the reference samples. The spectra show a clear change in the oxidation states of Co and V species under the H2 reduction conditions. The Co species in 5Co exhibits mixed oxidation state of Co2+ and Co0 after H2 reduction at 550 °C while 2.5Co-2.5V reveals the oxidation state similar to Co0.
In the comparison of XANES spectra at the V K-edge between the 5V and 2.5Co-2.5V samples, V2O3 (V3+), V2O4 (V4+), and V2O5 (V5+) were used as reference samples (Fig. 5(c) and (d)). The V species in both catalysts revealed similar changes in the XANES spectra during the H2 treatment. They exhibited an oxidation state of V5+ at the beginning of H2 treatment. After H2 treatment at 550 °C, the oxidation states of 5V and 2.5Co-2.5V changed to V4+, showing a spectrum similar to that of V2O4. This change in the oxidation state of the V species of the catalysts was well matched with the TPR data.
To quantitatively evaluate the oxidation state of the Co species in the 5Co and 2.5Co-2.5V catalyst, a linear combination analysis (LCA) of the XANES spectra was performed (Fig. 6). Both 5Co and 2.5Co-2.5V catalysts primarily contained Co3O4 phase with mixed oxidation states of Co3+ and Co2+ in the initial state. Under an H2 atmosphere, the reduction of 5Co catalyst from Co3O4 to CoO dominantly occurred near 430 °C with increasing temperature. The generation of the CoO phase by H2 treatment also triggered the subsequent reduction to Co0. However, the strong interaction of Co species with the Al2O3 support hindered the reduction to a Co0 species. As a consequence, the 5Co catalyst still had CoO as a major phase and only 43% of the Co species were present as metallic Co in the final state despite H2 treatment at 550 °C for 1 h. In contrast, the same H2 treatment of the 2.5Co-2.5V catalyst led to a completely different oxidation state. Compared to the 5Co catalyst, the Co3O4 phase started to be reduced at a lower temperature of 350 °C. Moreover, most of the CoO phase was subsequently reduced to a metallic Co phase near 400 °C. This facile reduction resulted in Co0 being the major species of the 2.5Co-2.5V catalysts. Approximately 80% of the Co species in the catalyst were in the metallic phase after H2 treatment at 550 °C for 1 h. The unreduced CoO phase in the catalyst could be attributed to the strong interfacial interaction of the well-dispersed Co with the support.

Fig. 6. Quantitative results from LCA of Co K-edge XANES spectra of (a) 5Co and (b) 2.5Co-2.5V. The 5Co catalyst has CoO as major phase after H2 treatment at 550 °C for 1 h. The presence of V content in the 2.5Co-2.5V catalyst promotes the subsequent reduction of CoO phase to metallic Co, showing that 80 % of Co species is present as Co0 after the treatment.
Co K-edge EXAFS analysis of the 5Co and 2.5Co-2.5V catalysts also revealed the change in oxidation state during H2 treatment (Fig. 7). The Fourier transformation of the χ(k)k2 data was performed in the k-range of 3−12 Å−1 with a sine window. As confirmed by the reference samples, the Fourier transform (FT) peaks at 1−2 Å and 2.2−3 Å were attributed to the Co-O and Co-Co shells, respectively. For the metallic Co, the Co-Co peak was observed around 2.2 Å. The distinct positions of Co0, CoO, and Co3O4 in the FT spectrum could be used to determine the local environment of Co species in the catalysts. At 20 °C under H2 atmosphere, the 5Co and 2.5Co-2.5V catalysts showed a local structure similar to that of Co3O4. As the reduction temperature increased, the amplitude of the peaks decreased up to 380 °C. This could be attributed to an increase in disorder with temperature and a decrease in the particle size of the initial Co3O4 phase during the reduction process. The peak positions in the spectrum of 5Co obtained at 500 °C indicated a mixed phase of Co3O4 and CoO. Although a noticeable change in the phase occurred at 500 °C, the results revealed that Co oxides were still dominant. However, the 2.5Co-2.5V catalyst showed a change in their EXAFS spectra at 380 °C. More importantly, it underwent a gradual transformation of the local environment from Co3O4 to CoO to Co, showing a distinct peak corresponding to Co0 at 2.2 Å. These EXAFS results were consistent with those obtained from the LCA of the XANES spectra.

3.3. Catalytic performance
The catalytic performance of xCo-yV catalysts was evaluated for PDH at low WHSVpropane (1.2 h−1). All catalysts were pretreated by H2 at 550 °C before the catalytic tests. The propane conversion and propene selectivity of xCo-yV are compared in Fig. 8. The total carbon balance was greater than 95 % after 60 min time-on-stream (TOS) (Fig. S7). The 5Co catalyst showed an induction period at the initial reaction stage, yielding 11 % conversion and 94 % propene selectivity. These values are similar to those obtained from 5 wt% Co/Al2O3 nanosheet at identical reaction temperature [28]. Despite a small amount of V content, the 4Co-1V exhibited a clear increase in conversion and propene selectivity. The 2.5Co-2.5V showed the highest performance and stability, demonstrating a synergistic effect in the co-presence of Co and V oxides. It exhibited the initial propane conversion of 23 % and the propene selectivity of 97 %. However, further increase in V content negatively affected. Both 1Co-4V and 5V showed similar initial activity to that of 2.5Co-2.5V but the activity was significantly decreased to less than half at 260 min TOS.

Fig. 8. (a) Propane conversion and (b) propene selectivity of xCo-yV catalysts. The Co-V mixed oxide catalysts, 4Co-1V and 2.5Co-2.5V, show improved catalytic performance compared to the 5Co and 5V catalysts. Experimental conditions: T = 550 °C, atmospheric pressure, WHSVpropane =1.2 h−1, 100 mg of catalyst, and total flow rate =20 sccm.
The deactivation rate constants were calculated using first-order deactivation model (Table 3) [3]. The 5Co, 4Co-1V, and 2.5Co-2.5V catalysts showed lower deactivation constants than the 1Co-4V and 5V catalysts. Approximately 3 times lower value of 2.5Co-2.5V than that of 5V indicated higher stability of 2.5Co-2.5V. The total amount of coke deposited on the spent xCo-yV catalysts is summarized in Table 3. The highest amount of coke was deposited on 5Co and the amount was decreased as increasing the V content in xCo-yV catalysts. There was no clear correlation between the deactivation rate constant and the amount of carbon deposits. Compared to the 2.5Co-2.5V, the 1Co-4V and 5V were rapidly deactivated despite less carbon deposition. This result indicated that VOx sites in the xCo-yV catalysts were vulnerable to coke deposition as reported that strong acidic properties of partially reduced VOx sites lead to re-adsorption of propene and coke precursor [42,43]. The deactivation behavior was consistent with the surface acidity of the xCo-yV catalysts (Fig. S3). Moreover, Raman spectrum of the spent 5V catalyst exhibited the formation of V2O5 crystal after reaction. This indicates that the agglomeration of surface VOx species to inactive V2O5 crystallites also affected the deactivation of the xCo-yV catalysts (Fig. S8). The change in catalytic performance of 2.5Co-2.5V was also measured for 5 cycles of PDH. The conversion slowly decreased with repeating cycles, whereas the selectivity gradually increased (Fig. S9).

The propene formation rate and the selectivity of the xCo-yV catalysts at high WHSVpropane (9.5 h−1) were measured under differential reactor conditions (Fig. 9). The total flow rate and the weight of the catalyst were chosen to keep the conversion below 10%. The 5Co exhibited relatively lower propene formation rate of 0.17
and selectivity of 96.7%. Small amount of V component improved the both activity and selectivity as shown for the 4Co-1V. The 2.5Co-2.5V exhibited the highest propene formation rate of 0.35
, two times higher than that of the 5Co (Table 3). Moreover, the 2.5Co-2.5V catalyst exhibited a higher space time yield of propene compared to previously reported Co-based catalysts (Table S1) [59]. After reaching the maximum activity, the propene formation rate decreased as increasing the V content. Both 1Co-4V and 5V showed similar propene formation rate to that of the 5Co.

Experimental conditions: T = 550 °C, atmospheric pressure, WHSVpropane =9.5 h−1, 50 mg of catalyst, and total flow rate =40 sccm.
The performance results revealed that 4Co-1V and 2.5Co-2.5V exhibit improved catalytic properties compared to 5Co. The main feature observed in both catalysts was the surface enrichment of Co species. The surface concentration of V species in the catalysts was proportional to the bulk concentration, whereas the concentration of surface Co was noticeably higher than that of bulk Co (Fig. 3). It can be concluded that the presence of V component led to the surface enrichment of Co species by modifying the interactions between Co species and Al2O3 support and resulted in enhanced performance of the 4Co-1V and 2.5Co-2.5V compared to the 5Co. However, V-dominant catalyst, 1Co-4V, exhibited similar catalytic properties to those of 5V, revealing minor effect of Co species in the catalyst on the performance.
It should be also noted that the Co species in 2.5Co-2.5V showed improved reducibility than 5Co. Consequently, in-situ XAS results showed that the 2.5Co-2.5V catalyst had nearly two times higher fraction of metallic Co, 80% of the total Co species, than that of the 5Co catalyst. This observation suggests that reducibility of the xCo-yV catalysts and thus, oxidation state of Co and V species could affect their catalytic properties. The influence of oxidation state has been observed for several metal oxide catalysts such as CrOx-, WOx-, and FeOx-based catalysts [9,10,16,17]. Indeed, the 2.5Co-2.5V resulted in significantly different performance depending on the pretreatment conditions. The propene formation rate of the pre-reduced 2.5Co-2.5V was three times higher than that of the pre-oxidized catalyst (Fig. S10). Moreover, in the case of 5Co, the pre-oxidized catalyst exhibited lower performance than pre-reduced catalyst at the initial reaction stage but recovered performance during the reaction (Fig. S11). The XPS spectra for the spent catalysts showed that a part of oxidized Co species in the pre-oxidized catalyst was reduced to metallic Co during the reaction (Fig. S12). Based on these observations, it can be inferred that formation of more active Co species, Co0, could lead to the improvement in performance of CoOx-based catalysts. Our results are consistent with the previous studies suggesting that well-dispersed Co0 in Co/Al2O3 catalysts is active and selective species for PDH [29,30].
It is also noteworthy that the pre-reduced 5Co also exhibited an induction period. This result confirmed that the pretreatment by H2 was not sufficient for complete reduction of all Co species to metallic Co, showing consistency with the data obtained by in-situ XANES analysis. On the other hand, the presence of the V component in 2.5Co-2.5V improved the reducibility of the catalyst and facilitated the reduction of Co species to Co0. Consequently, the difference in the initial performance between pre-oxidized and pre-reduced 2.5Co-2.5V was much smaller than that between of 5Co catalysts. Thus, it can be concluded that the superior propene formation rate of 2.5Co-2.5V, two times higher than that of the 5Co and 5V catalysts, was affected by the increase in the surface concentration of active Co species. Our results based on in-situ XAS and ex-situ characterizations show that a delicate control of surface concentration of metallic Co species is required for the development of highly active CoOx-based catalysts for PDH.
4. Conclusions
This work reported the properties of xCo-yV catalysts and their catalytic performance for PDH. Among the xCo-yV catalysts, 2.5Co-2.5V exhibited the highest catalytic performance. The improved performance was associated with the fact that the presence of the V component led to the modification of the interaction of Co species with Al2O3 support. This change resulted in the increase in the concentration of surface Co species. The co-presence of Co and V components also enhanced the reducibility of Co species. Comparison of the catalytic performance of pre-reduced and pre-oxidized catalysts and in-situ XAS data suggested that formation of more active Co species, metallic Co, led to the improvement in the performance of 2.5Co-2.5V. Our results showed that the surface concentration of metallic Co species is an important factor in determining catalytic performance of CoOx-based catalysts for PDH.
