The document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. It discusses platinum and tin catalysts supported on various metal oxides, but does not mention application to propane dehydrogenation to propylene. Therefore, I have indicated that the document is not relevant.
