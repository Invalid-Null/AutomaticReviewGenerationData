Characteristics and catalytic properties of Pt–Sn/Al2O3 nanoparticles synthesized by one-step flame spray pyrolysis in the dehydrogenation of propane
Abstract
The Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts with 0.3 wt% Pt and 0.5–1.5 wt% Sn loading were prepared by one-step flame spray pyrolysis (FSP). Unlike the catalysts prepared by conventional impregnation method, the FSP-derived catalysts were composed of single-crystalline γ-alumina particles with the as-prepared primary particle size of 10–18 nm and contained only large pores. The FSP catalysts exhibited superior catalytic activity and better stability than the ones made by impregnation in the dehydrogenation of propane, while they did not alter the selectivity to propylene (in all cases, propylene selectivity ≥96%). The presence of large pores in the flame-made catalysts not only facilitated diffusion of the reactants and products but could also lessen the amount of carbon deposited during reactions. As revealed by CO chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the metal particles appeared to be partially covered by the alumina matrix (Al–O) due to the simultaneous formation of particles during FSP synthesis. Such phenomena, however, were shown to result in the formation of active Pt–Sn ensembles for propane dehydrogenation as shown by higher turnover frequencies (TOFs).

Pt–Sn/Al2O3 nanoparticles produced by one-step flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) exhibited higher catalytic activity and better stability with high selectivity to propene in the dehydrogenation of propane compared to the ones prepared by conventional impregnation technique. The better catalytic performance of the FSP-derived catalysts has been correlated well with their advantageous characteristics such as the single crystalline γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles with very large pore size (inter-particle pores) and the formation of active Pt–Sn ensembles in the alumina matrix.

1. Introduction
Due to the uncertain oil price and the growing demand of propylene in the past few years, the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane from natural gas has received much attention as an alternative way for producing propylene. The dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction that requires high temperature, which promotes the thermal cracking reaction to coke and light alkane. The catalysts with high activity, high selectivity, and good stability are required to overcome this problem. Chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are most widely studied in such reactions [1]. However, both of them have relatively poor reaction stability due to the carbon deposits.
It is well known that addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts can promote desired dehydrogenation reactions while inhibiting coking reactions [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. The role of Sn in Pt–Sn catalyst has been explained in terms of geometric effects and/or electronic effects. For geometric effects, tin decreases the size of platinum ensembles, which reducing hydrogenolysis and coking reactions, while for electronic effects, tin modifies the electronic density of Pt, due either to a positive charge transfer from Snn+ species or to the different electronic structures of Pt–Sn alloys. This modification was responsible for changes in the heat of adsorption of different adsorbates participating in the reaction.
Bimetallic Pt and Sn supported on different supports, such as metal oxides (Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, TiO2) [2], [3], [8], [9], [10], zeolites (ZSM-5) [11], [12], and mesoporous materials (SBA-15) [13], which are believed to be the promising catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and thus have been extensively investigated. Among those, Pt–Sn/Al2O3 is one of the favorite dehydrogenation catalysts, owing to the strong interactions between Pt metal and Al2O3 supports, which could affect the reduction behavior and stability of the catalyst.
Flame synthesis, especially flame spray pyrolysis (FSP), is a relatively new process for one-step synthesis of supported metal catalysts. It is generally known as a method for making nanoparticles such as fume silica, titania, and carbon black in large quantities at low cost [14]. Many applications of supported metal catalysts synthesized via FSP method have been reported. For examples, flame-made Pt–Ba/Al2O3 and Pt/Ba/CexZr1−xO2 have been investigated in lean-NOx storage-reduction [15], [16]. High surface area FSP-derived Ag/ZnO has been reported to exhibit high photocatalytic performance in UV-photodegradation of methylene blue [17]. Baiker et al. [18], [19], [20] successfully applied the FSP method for syntheses of various Al2O3-supported noble metal catalysts. The flame-made Pt/Al2O3 showed an improved turnover frequency in the hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate compared to conventional porous catalysts. Our recent studies also show that Pd/SiO2 synthesized in one-step by FSP method exhibited higher hydrogenation activity in the liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of 1-heptyne comparing to the ones prepared by a conventional impregnation method [21], [22]. The structural differences of the flame-made and conventionally prepared catalysts have often been explained as the reasons for the differences in their catalytic behaviors.
One aim of this study is to extend our investigation to the flame-synthesized Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts with 0.3 wt% Pt and 0.5–1.5 wt% Sn in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The stronger metal–support interaction in the flame-made catalysts is believed to produce great beneficial effects in such reactions. The catalyst behaviors have been correlated with the characterization results obtained using N2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), CO pulse chemisorption, transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by conventional impregnation of Pt and Sn precursors on both the flame-synthesized and the reference Al2O3 were also employed for comparison purposes.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
2.1.1. Flame-made catalysts
Synthesis of Pt–Sn/Al2O3 was carried out using a spray flame reactor similar to that of Ref. [23]. Platinum actetylacetonate, tin ethylhexanoate and aluminum butoxide from Aldrich were used as platinum, tin and aluminum precursors, respectively. Precursors were prepared by dissolving in xylene (MERCK; 99.8 vol.%) with total metal concentration maintained at 0.3 M. The platinum concentration was fixed at 0.3 wt% while the tin content was varied between 0.5 and 1.5 wt%. Using a syringe pump, 5 ml/min of precursor solution was dispersed into fine droplets by a gas-assisted nozzle fed by 5 l/min of oxygen (Thai Industrial Gas Limited; purity >99%). The pressure drop at the capillary tip was maintained at 1.5 bar by adjusting the orifice gap area at the nozzle. The spray was ignited by supporting flamelets fed with oxygen (3 l/min) and methane (1.5 l/min) which are positioned in a ring around the nozzle outlet. A sintered metal plate ring (8 mm wide, starting at a radius of 8 mm) provided an additional 10 l/min of oxygen as sheath for the supporting flame. The product particles were collected on a glass fiber filter (Whatman GF/C, 15 cm in diameter) with the aid of a vacuum pump.
2.1.2. Impregnation-made catalysts
For comparison purposes, the impregnation-made Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation of the solution of platinum actetylacetonate and tin ethylhexanoate in xylene on a commercially available (Fluka) alumina and on the flame-made alumina. The metal content in these catalysts was 0.3% Pt and 1% Sn.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a Siemens D5000 using nickel filtered Cu Kα radiation. The crystallite size (dXRD) was determined using the Scherrer equation and α-alumina as the external standard. The BET (Brunauer Emmett Teller) surface area, average pore size diameters, and pore size distribution were determined by physisorption of nitrogen (N2) using a BEL-SORP automated system. The morphology and particle size of powders were observed using a JEOL-JEM 200CX transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV. The active sites and relative percentage dispersions of platinum catalyst were determined by CO-pulse chemisorption technique using a Micromeritics ChemiSorb 2750 system running ChemiSoft TPx software at room temperature. XPS analysis was performed using an AMICUS photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a Mg Kα X-ray as a primary excitation and running KRATOS VISION2 software. XPS elemental spectra were acquired with 0.1 eV energy steps at a pass energy of 75 kV. The C1s line was taken as an internal standard at 285.0 eV.
2.3. Catalytic evaluation
The dehydrogenation of propane (Thai Industrial Gas) was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor with an inner diameter of 6 mm. Approximately 0.1 g of catalyst was loaded in the middle of the reactor. Prior to the experiments the catalysts were pretreated in flowing H2 (30 ml/min) at 773 K for 1 h. The reaction was carried out isothermally at 823 K and at atmospheric pressure. The reaction mixture composed of H2, C3H8 and Ar (H2/C3H8/Ar molar ratio = 1:1:5) was fed to the reactor with the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) based on propane of 5 h−1. A purge gas (Ar) flow of 30 ml/min was used and the reaction mixture was preheated at 773 K. The product gases were analyzed on-line using a gas chromatograph with a TCD detector using a SUS Column PorapakQ, 80/100 mesh column.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst properties
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of impregnation- and flame-made Pt/Al2O3 and Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts with Sn loadings 0.5–1.5 wt%. All the catalyst samples exhibited only the characteristic peaks of γ-Al2O3, additional peaks corresponding to Pt, Sn, and other alumina phases were not observed, probably due to the low amounts of Pt and Sn present and/or to the high dispersion of these metals on the Al2O3 supports. Addition of Pt or Sn simultaneously with Al during flame synthesis did not affect alumina phase transformation. Formation of γ-phase in high temperature flame can be explained by the fact that the particles spent only a few seconds in the flame. This result is consistent with the work from Baiker et al. [18], [19], [20].

Typical TEM micrographs of the impregnated and flame-made Pt/Al2O3 and Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. The impregnation-made Pt–Sn supported on reference Al2O3 catalysts (Pt–1.0Sn/Com-Al) consisted of agglomerated large particles of alumina and spherical Pt/PtO particles/granules with average sizes between 2 and 5 nm dispersed on the alumina surface (shown as dark spots). The flame-made powder consisted of spherical primary particles with average sizes around 10–18 nm. Pt/PtO metal clusters were not distinguishable for the impregnation-made Pt–Sn on flame-made Al2O3 supports (Pt–1.0Sn/F–Al) and for all the flame-made catalysts.

Fig. 3 shows the XRD particle size (dXRD) for Al2O3 (triangles), the BET equivalent particle size (dBET; circles), and the average particle size obtained from TEM analysis (dTEM; square) as a function of Sn loading for the flame-made Pt–Sn/Al2O3 powders. The calculated dBET data were found to be in good agreement with the dXRD and dTEM values indicating that the particles were single crystalline. The physicochemical properties of the impregnation- and flame-made Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts are summarized in Table 1. The BET surface areas of the reference and the flame-made Al2O3 supports were 145 and 105 m2/g, respectively, whereas those of the corresponding impregnation-made Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts were 139 and 103 m2/g. A small decrease in BET surface area of the alumina supports can be explained by pore blockages during impregnation of platinum and tin precursors. On the other hand, the BET surface areas of flame-made Pt and Pt–Sn catalysts were ranged between 110 and 122 m2/g, which were higher than the area of the flame-made Al2O3 support alone. Such a result suggests an inhibition of the growth of Al2O3 particles by Pt and Sn dopants resulting in formation of smaller particles. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 4) reveal that the catalysts prepared in one-step by FSP and the impregnation-made catalysts supported on FSP-derived alumina contained only large pores and did not possess any mesopores, while the impregnation-made ones supported on reference alumina showed the properties of typical mesoporous materials.

The relative amounts of active Pt metals on the catalyst surface were calculated from CO chemisorption experiments at room temperature. The calculation of Pt active sites was based on the assumption that one carbon monoxide molecule adsorbs on one platinum site. Our preliminary tests of CO-pulse chemisorption indicated that flame-made Sn/Al2O3 and the Al2O3 support do not chemisorb CO. For the FSP-synthesized catalysts, the density of Pt active sites decreased from 2.3 × 1018 to 1 × 1018 sites/g-catalyst as Sn content increased from 0 to 1.5 wt%, corresponding to decreasing of Pt metal dispersion from 28 to 12.2%. As suggested by others, the lower amount of CO chemisorption on the Pt–Sn catalysts can be attributed to the formation of Pt–Sn ensembles or alloys that do not adsorb CO [24]. The average Pt0 metal particle sizes calculated from CO chemisorption were in the range of 4–9 nm. Comparing the catalysts with similar metal composition (0.3 wt% Pt and 1.0 wt% Sn), we found the amount of Pt active sites to be dependent on the preparation method and on the different alumina supports used in the order: Pt–1.0Sn/F–Al > Pt–1.0Sn/Com-Al > F–Pt–1.0Sn/Al. It is also possible that the F–Pt–1.0Sn/Al catalyst, which was prepared by one-step FSP method exhibited CO chemisorption suppression due to the formation of an alumina matrix (i.e., in the form of Al–O groups) covering the Pt and Sn surfaces during FSP synthesis.
Surface compositions in term of Sn/Al atomic ratios of the various FSP- and impregnation-made Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts were determined by XPS technique, the results are given in Table 1. It was found that the Sn/Al atomic ratio for Pt–Sn/Com-Al catalyst was ten and twenty-five times higher than those of Pt–Sn/F–Al and F–Pt–Sn/Al, respectively. For the impregnation-made catalysts, the larger pore size of FSP-made alumina made it possible for Pt and Sn particles to be located deeper inside the pores than was possible for the reference Al2O3-supported ones. For the FSP-made catalysts, it is likely that the metals were partially covered by the Al2O3 matrix during one-step FSP synthesis resulting in much lower Sn/Al ratio observed. It should, however, be noted that Pt species were not detected in all cases due to the very low amount present.
The XPS elemental scan peak for Sn 3d5/2 was observed at 488.3–488.4 eV for impregnation-made Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, while the FSP-made catalysts exhibited the characteristic peak corresponding to oxidized Sn species at 486.1–486.7 eV. According to the literature data, a binding energy at 486.5–486.9 eV represents Sn2+, while Sn4+ exhibits higher binding energies at 486.5–488.0 eV [25], [26], [27]. The lower binding energies of Sn 3d5/2 for the FSP-made catalysts thus suggest that the more reducible form of Sn was produced in the Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts synthesized by the one-step FSP method.
Particle formation during FSP synthesis of supported noble metals has been suggested earlier [15], [28]. According to the proposed mechanism, formation of FSP-made Pt–Sn/Al2O3 nanoparticles can be considered as follows: the sprayed droplets of precursor solution were evaporated and combusted as soon as they met the flame at very high temperature and released the metal atoms; then nucleation and growth of particles by coagulation and condensation occurred along the axial direction of the flame. Since the vapor pressure of Al2O3 was lower than those of the metals, the formation of Al2O3 particles could start earlier. Further downstream of the flame at lower temperature, Pt and Sn started to form small particles and/or deposits directly on the Al2O3 support. However, in such a very high temperature environment, it is likely that some of the metal particles were covered by support matrix.
3.2. Catalyst behavior in the dehydrogenation of propane
The catalytic behaviors of the flame-made Pt/Al2O3 and Pt–Sn/Al2O3catalysts were investigated in the dehydrogenation of propane reaction. The catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, selectivity to propene, and the turnover frequencies (TOFs) calculated based on CO chemisorption of the flame-made Pt/Al2O3 and Pt–Sn/Al2O3catalysts are given in Table 2. The results were compared to those of the impregnation-made Pt–Sn supported on flame-made and reference Al2O3 supports. The conversion of propane for the flame-made Pt/Al2O3 and Pt–Sn/Al2O3catalysts increased from 7.3 to 22.6% as Sn loading increased from 0 to 0.5 wt% and decreased to 12.7% when Sn loading was increased further to 1.5 wt%. When there was an excessive amount of Sn on the catalyst surface, a larger amount of Sn0 species could be produced, resulting in an alloy formation, and as a consequence the catalyst activity decreased [11], [12]. However, this was probably not the case in this study, since there was no significant change in the binding energies of Sn species for the FSP-derived Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts with various Sn contents. On the other hand, the Sn/Al atomic ratio for F–Pt–1.5Sn/Al was found to be much higher than the others, suggesting the possibility for blockages of active Pt surface by excessive amount of Sn and/or the decrease in acidity of the alumina support, which would also lower the catalyst activity [11], [12]. Comparing the catalysts prepared by different techniques (similar Sn content), we find that the propane conversion was improved in the order: F–Pt–1.0Sn/Al > Pt–1.0Sn/F–Al > Pt–1.0Sn/Com-Al. There was no significant difference in the selectivity for propylene for all the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt–Sn/Al2O3catalysts (propylene selectivity ≈96–99%). It should be noted that the calculated TOF for F–Pt–1.0Sn/Al catalyst was approximately two-fold and five-fold higher than those of the impregnation-made ones supported on flame-made and reference alumina, respectively. In other words, the simultaneous formation of Pt–Sn/Al2O3 nanoparticles by FSP method could produce highly active Pt–Sn ensembles for such reaction.

The relations between propane conversion and reaction time are plotted in Fig. 5. The propane conversion was gradually decreased during 180 min time-on-stream in all cases, suggesting catalyst deactivation due probably to coke formation. The percentages of catalyst activity change are shown in Fig. 6. Compared to the conventional impregnation-made ones, all the flame-made catalysts exhibited better stability with the F–Pt–1.0Sn/Al showing the lowest deactivation. The lower catalyst deactivation rate for the FSP-made catalysts can be attributed to their larger pore size, resulting in lower amounts of coke formation and/or less carbon blocking active sites. Considering the FSP-catalysts with different Sn contents, we found that the percent deactivation decreased from 37.5 to 25% as Sn loading increased from 0 to 1 wt% and then decreased to 32.5% when the amount of Sn was further increased to 1.5%. It is known that there are two active centers (metal and acid sites) for the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. Pt is used as the hydrogenation center, while the acid sites on Al2O3 support are “double-faced”. When the balance of metal and acid of the catalysts is kept, the synergistic effect is beneficial to the dehydrogenation activity and catalyst stability. When the acidity is strong, the acid sites promote the undesired reactions such as cracking, isomerization and polymerization, which decreased the olefin selectivity and stability of the catalyst [29], [30]. There exists an optimum ratio between the number of acid sites and the number of active metal sites on the catalyst surface in order to improve activity and stability of the catalysts. Addition of an appropriate amount of Sn would adjust the ratio between these two sites so that better catalyst performance was obtained.

4. Conclusions
The Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts synthesized by one-step FSP method exhibited higher catalytic activity and better stability in the dehydrogenation of propane with high propylene selectivity (≥96%) compared to the ones prepared by conventional impregnation of Pt and Sn precursors on either the flame-made or the reference Al2O3 supports. Addition of Pt and Sn simultaneously with Al during FSP synthesis produced single crystalline γ-alumina particles with the as-prepared primary particle size of 10–18 nm. An optimum Sn loading that yielded the highest catalyst activity and lowest catalyst deactivation rate was determined to be ca. 1 wt%. The better catalytic performance and stability of the FSP-derived Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts were attributed to the formation of highly active Pt–Sn ensembles and to the very large pore sizes of the flame-made catalysts, respectively.
