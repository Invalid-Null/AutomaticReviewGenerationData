Dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over CrOy-CeO2-K2O/γ-Al2O3 catalysts: Effect of cerium content




1. Introduction
Propylene is a major building block in the petrochemical industries [1], [2], [3]. On-purpose production of propylene has been conducted through several routes; metathesis [3], [4], methanol-to-propylene [3], [5], and propane dehydrogenation [3], [6]. Among these processes, dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has attracted much attraction as a promising process, because recent development of shale gas industry has favored the use of propane as a raw material. In addition, propane, which has been mainly used as an energy source, can be easily converted into value-added product.
Dehydrogenation of propane involves the cleavage of two C–H bonds of propane with the formation of a hydrogen molecule. The major drawback of this reaction is low propane conversion due to thermodynamic limitation. However, this problem can be solved by using oxidizing agents such as O2, CO2, and N2O for converting hydrogen to water. In addition, metal oxide catalyst can be utilized as an oxygen source because lattice oxygen in the catalyst is transferred to reactant through partial oxidation mechanism [6].
The reaction mechanism for the dehydrogenation of propane over metal oxide catalyst follows the Mars–van Krevelen redox cycle [6]. First, propane is chemisorbed on metal site and C–H bond is activated by lattice oxygen of the catalyst. α-Hydrogen of propane is then abstracted to form propylene, water, and anion vacancy on the catalyst surface. The anion vacancy is filled by migration of adjacent lattice oxygen, and subsequently, the catalyst is reoxidized by an external oxygen source. Thus, redox property of metal oxide is a crucial factor determining the catalytic performance in the reaction.
Various transition-metal oxide catalysts based on Cr, V, Nb, and Mo have been applied to the dehydrogenation of propane [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Among these catalysts, chromium oxide catalyst supported on potassium-containing γ-alumina has been widely used in the commercial processes due to their intrinsic redox property. However, only a few researches have focused on the promotion of Cr-based catalysts via addition of metal element. It has been reported that cerium oxide can modify the ability to transfer lattice oxygen of neighboring metal oxide species due to their excellent redox property [13], [14]. Therefore, a systematic investigation on the effect of cerium content on the catalytic activities and physicochemical properties of chromium oxide-based catalyst would be worthwhile.
In this work, a series of CrOy(17.5 wt.%)-CeO2(X wt.%)-K2O(2 wt.%)/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with different cerium content (X, wt.%) were prepared, and they were applied to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalyst was designed for use in a circulating fluidized-bed process with chemical looping system in which the catalyst was continuously circulated from reactor to regenerator. In detail, the catalyst and reactant feed pass rapidly through a straight-through transport reactor without oxidizing agent. In the regenerator, coke on the catalyst is removed by burning and oxygen vacancy of the catalyst is refilled by molecular oxygen. The regenerated catalyst is then sent back to the reactor. For this purpose, the reaction test was performed within short time in the absence of external oxygen source in this work. The effect of cerium content on the catalytic activities and physicochemical properties of the catalysts was investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A series of CrOy(17.5 wt.%)-CeO2(X wt.%)-K2O(2 wt.%)/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by a spray drying method and a subsequent incipient wetness impregnation method. For the preparation of γ-alumina support, 27.8 g of Catapal B alumina (Sasol) was dissolved in deionized water (57 ml) at room temperature under vigorous stirring for 30 min. 15.4 ml of HNO3 solution (4.7 wt.%) was then added into the solution. After maintaining the solution with constant stirring for 40 h, the resulting solution was introduced into a spray dryer. The spray dryer equipped with rotary atomizer was operated at different inlet (210 °C) and outlet (125 °C) temperatures. The resultant was calcined at 700 °C for 6 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min under air flow to yield γ-Al2O3.
For co-impregnation of chromium, cerium, and potassium species onto γ-Al2O3 support, known amounts of CrO3 (Sigma-Aldrich), Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich), and KNO3 (Sigma-Aldrich) were simultaneously dissolved in deionized water (3 ml). During this process, cerium content was adjusted to be 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 wt.%. The solution containing metal oxide precursors was then introduced onto γ-Al2O3 support by an incipient wetness impregnation method. After drying the impregnated sample at 60 °C, it was calcined at 700 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min under N2 flow (50 ml/min). The prepared catalysts were denoted as 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8), where X represented the cerium content (wt.%). The contents of chromium oxide and potassium oxide were fixed at 17.5 and 2 wt.%, respectively.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
Textural properties of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8) catalysts were examined by nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements (BELSORP-mini II, BEL Japan). Metal contents of the catalysts were determined by ICP-MS analyses (ELAN 6100, Perkin-Elmer SCIEX). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were obtained by a D-Max2500-PC diffractometer (Rigaku) using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.541 Å) operated at 50 kV and 100 mA. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra of the catalysts were recorded using a Lambda-35 (Perkin-Elmer) spectrometer. Binding energies and oxidation states of the catalysts were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses using an AXIS-HSI instrument (KRATOS). Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analyses of the catalysts were conducted in a flow reactor system equipped with a quartz reactor. For the TPR measurement, 10 mg of each catalyst was pretreated with N2 flow (50 ml/min) at 200 °C for 1 h. TPR profiles were obtained using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 700 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min under 5% H2/N2 flow (50 ml/min). Temperature-programmed reoxidation (TPRO) analyses of the catalysts were conducted using a mass selective detector (MSD). For the TPRO experiment, 0.2 g of each catalyst was reduced by carrying out the dehydrogenation of propane at 630 °C for 5 min in the absence of oxygen feed to consume lattice oxygen of the catalyst. After the used catalyst was placed in a TPRO apparatus, a mixed stream of helium (20 ml/min) and oxygen (2 ml/min) was introduced at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 700 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min.
2.3. Dehydrogenation of propane to propylene
Dehydrogenation of propane was conducted in a continuous flow fixed-bed quartz reactor equipped with multi-position valves in the absence of external oxygen source. Each catalyst (0.2 g) was charged into the reactor, and it was pretreated under O2 flow (6 ml/min) diluted with He flow (24 ml/min) at 630 °C for 20 min. After purging the reactor with He flow (24 ml/min), the reactant was pulse-injected at 630 °C for 45 s and the products were simultaneously sampled in 16-position valve at a 3 s interval. During the reaction, feed composition was fixed at C3H8:N2 = 40 ml:40 ml and GHSV was maintained at 12,000 ml/(h·gcat). Reaction products were sequentially analyzed with an on-line gas chromatograph (ACME 6000, Younglin) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al catalysts
Textural properties of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8) catalysts were examined by nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements, as shown in Fig. 1(a). It was observed that all the catalysts exhibited IV-type isotherms with H2-type hysteresis loops, indicating the formation of well-developed cage-type mesopores. Detailed textural properties of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8) catalysts are listed in Table 1. It was found that actual metal contents in the catalysts were well matched with the designed values. All the catalysts showed high surface area (> 120 m2/g), large pore volume (> 0.28 cm3/g), and large average pore diameter (> 9.0 nm), indicating that the mesoporous structure of alumina support was successfully formed by a spray drying method. It was also found that surface area and pore volume of the catalysts decreased with increasing cerium content.

Crystalline structures of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8) catalysts were examined by XRD measurements. As shown in Fig. 1(b), diffraction peaks corresponding to γ-alumina phase were detected in all the catalysts. However, any diffraction peaks for chromium species were not detected in all the catalysts despite its high loading. This indicates that chromium oxide particles were finely dispersed on the catalyst surface due to strong interaction with alumina support. It was also observed that diffraction peaks for cerium oxide were not detected in the 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 0, 1, and 2), while diffraction peak intensity for cerium oxide increased with increasing cerium content in the 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 4 and 8). This indicates that cerium oxide particles were aggregated to be detected by XRD measurement in the 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 4 and 8) catalysts.
In order to investigate coordination and oxidation states of chromium species, UV–vis analyses for 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8) catalysts were conducted, as presented in Fig. 2(a). The absorbance bands at 267 and 371 nm are assigned to Cr6 + species with tetrahedral coordination in the impregnated chromium oxide [15]. On the other hand, the bands at 475 nm and 614 nm correspond to Cr3 + species with octahedral coordination in the bulk α-Cr2O3 [16]. It should be noted that the absorbance bands of Cr6 + species were observed in all the catalysts while the bands of Cr3 + species were not detected. The absorbance band of Cr6 + species decreased with increasing cerium content because of relative decrement of chromium content. From this result, it is believed that chromium oxide was mainly dispersed as Cr6 + species on γ-Al2O3 support without the formation of bulk Cr3 + species.

XPS analyses for 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8) catalysts were performed to examine the oxidation state of cerium species. Fig. 2(b) shows the XPS spectra for Ce 3d5/2 level of the catalysts. The Ce 3d5/2 spectra were deconvoluted into Ce3 + (882.0 eV) and Ce4 + (885.5 eV) species [17]. The total areas of Ce 3d5/2 spectra increased with increasing cerium content. The oxidation state ratio of cerium species was calculated as listed in Table 1. It was revealed that Ce4 +/(Ce3 + + Ce4 +) ratio increased in the order of 17.5Cr-8Ce-2K/Al < 17.5Cr-4Ce-2K/Al < 17.5Cr-1Ce-2K/Al < 17.5Cr-2Ce-2K/Al.
TPR experiments for measuring the amount of lattice oxygen of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8) catalysts were conducted, as shown in Fig. 3(a). 17.5Cr-2K/Al catalyst retained one-step reduction peak which was attributed to the reduction of Cr6 + species [9]. Although 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 1, 2, 4, and 8) also showed only one reduction peak without any peaks for bulk cerium species, the area of reduction peak was changed with a variation of cerium content. The TPR peak area representing hydrogen consumption was then converted into the corresponding amount of lattice oxygen (oxygen capacity) of the catalyst. The calculated oxygen capacity of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al catalysts is summarized in Table 2. The oxygen capacity increased in the order of 17.5Cr-8Ce-2K/Al < 17.5Cr-4Ce-2K/Al < 17.5Cr-1Ce-2K/Al < 17.5Cr-2Ce-2K/Al. This trend of oxygen capacity was well consistent with the trend of Ce4 +/(Ce3 + + Ce4 +) ratio. Fig. 3(b) shows the relationship between oxygen capacity and Ce4 +/(Ce3 + + Ce4 +) ratio of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8) catalysts. It was found that oxygen capacity increased with increasing Ce4 +/(Ce3 + + Ce4 +) ratio, indicating that the oxidation state of cerium species was an important factor determining the amount of lattice oxygen of the catalyst. In addition, we also came to know that an appropriate cerium content (X = 2) can modify the ratio of oxygen-rich Ce4 + species in the 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al catalysts.

3.2. Catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene
Fig. 4 shows the catalytic performance of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8) in the dehydrogenation of propane at 630 °C for 45 s in the absence of external oxygen source. In our catalytic reaction, propylene and water were mainly produced. This indicates that the reaction occurred via oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using lattice oxygen of the catalysts. It was observed that conversion of propane and yield for propylene significantly decreased during the reaction due to the rapid consumption of limited lattice oxygen in the catalyst. On the other hand, selectivity for propylene slightly increased with time on stream. It is known that selectivity for propylene is affected by oxidation state of chromium species [9], [10]. For example, Cr6 + species not only increase conversion of propane by facilitating H-abstraction of propane but also decrease selectivity for propylene by forming by-products due to its high reactivity. In this work, Cr6 + species of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al catalysts were reduced during the reaction because of the absence of external oxygen source. Therefore, selectivity for propylene increased with time on stream. Initial conversion of propane and initial yield for propylene increased in the order of 17.5Cr-8Ce-2K/Al < 17.5Cr-4Ce-2K/Al < 17.5Cr-2K/Al < 17.5Cr-1Ce-2K/Al < 17.5Cr-2Ce-2K/Al, in good agreement with the trends of Ce4 +/(Ce3 + + Ce4 +) ratio and oxygen capacity. In other words, initial conversion of propane and initial yield for propylene showed volcano-shaped trends with respect to cerium content. This indicates that an optimal cerium content was required for maximum propylene production by dehydrogenation of propane over 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al catalysts.

3.3. Effect of oxygen capacity of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al on the catalytic performance
In order to investigate the amount of oxygen consumption of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8) catalysts during the reaction, TPRO experiments were carried out. Fig. 5(a) shows the TPRO profiles of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al catalysts. It was found that TPRO peak area and peak temperature of the catalysts were different depending on cerium content. The amount of oxygen uptake of the catalyst is summarized in Table 2. The amount of oxygen uptake increased in the order of 17.5Cr-8Ce-2K/Al < 17.5Cr-4Ce-2K/Al < 17.5Cr-2K/Al < 17.5Cr-1Ce-2K/Al < 17.5Cr-2Ce-2K/Al, well consistent with the trend of oxygen capacity. This means that the amount of oxygen consumption during the reaction was closely related to the total amount of lattice oxygen (oxygen capacity) which was transferred from Cr6 + species of the catalyst. Fig. 5(b) shows the correlation between initial yield for propylene and oxygen capacity of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8) catalysts. It was revealed that initial yield for propylene increased with increasing oxygen capacity of the catalyst. Among the catalysts tested, 17.5Cr-2Ce-2K/Al with the highest oxygen capacity showed the highest initial yield for propylene in the dehydrogenation of propane.

4. Conclusions
A series of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al (X = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8) catalysts were prepared by a spray drying method and a subsequent incipient wetness impregnation method, and they were used for dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of external oxygen source. The effect of cerium content on the catalytic activities and physicochemical properties of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al was investigated. All the catalysts retained a well-developed mesoporous structure and finely dispersed Cr6 + species. It was revealed that the oxygen capacity of 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al catalysts was closely related to the oxidation state of cerium species. The oxygen capacity increased with increasing Ce4 +/(Ce3 + + Ce4 +) ratio of the catalyst. Catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane over 17.5Cr-XCe-2K/Al showed a volcano-shaped trend with respect to cerium content. Initial yield for propylene increased with increasing oxygen capacity of the catalyst. Among the catalysts, 17.5Cr-2Ce-2K/Al with the highest oxygen capacity served as the most efficient catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
