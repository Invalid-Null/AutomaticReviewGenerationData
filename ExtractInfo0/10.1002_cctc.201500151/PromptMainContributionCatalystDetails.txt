Effect of VOx Species and Support on Coke Formation and Catalyst Stability in Nonoxidative Propane Dehydrogenation
Graphical Abstract
VOx takes it all: The kind of VOx species determines the rate of carbon formation in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane over VOx/SiO2–Al2O3. Larger species result in a higher rate, and the on-stream dehydrogenation stability is consequently reduced.
Abstract
VOx/SiO2–Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by grafting vanadyl acetylacetonate onto the supports with a SiO2 content between 0 and 100 wt. %. The degree of polymerization of VOx species and acidity both of pristine supports and the catalysts were evaluated. To determine their on-stream stability and carbon deposition activity in nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation, continuous-flow tests and in situ thermogravimetric measurements were performed. The rate constants of catalyst deactivation and carbon deposition were derived from kinetic evaluation of these experiments. Gathered experimental evidence pointed out that VOx species were significantly more active for coke formation than acid sites of the supports. The rate constant of carbon formation was found to increase with the degree of polymerization of VOx species, whereas no correlation between catalyst acidity and the rate constants of coking or deactivation could be drawn.
Introduction
Propylene is the second important building block of the chemical industry after ethylene and finds its application in production of polymers, fibers, resins, and solvents. It is industrially produced as a co-product of steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions.1, 2 Metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes3 and nonoxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane2 are two commercially available on-purpose propylene production alternatives. Growing extraction of shale gas drives the price of propane down thus making the latter process more commercially attractive despite high energy demand caused by strong endothermicity of the reaction. The existing industrial DH processes employ catalysts based on chromium oxide or metallic platinum.2, 4 Supported VOx-containing catalysts were extensively studied for their activity and selectivity in the conversion of C3–C4 hydrocarbons into corresponding olefins in the absence of gas-phase O2. From a mechanistic viewpoint, this reaction can run oxidatively or nonoxidatively with participation of lattice oxygen of oxidized VOx species5–14 or their reduced counterparts,15, 16 respectively. Although the former approach is thermodynamically not limited, it suffers from low on-stream stability caused by a reduced capacity of VOx species to provide their active oxygen. Recently, VOx/SiO2–Al2O3 catalysts were shown to have commercially attractive activity, propylene selectivity and durability in propane DH.15, 16 The latter is an important process parameter, because all known DH catalysts suffer from deactivation caused by coke deposits formed on their surface.17, 18 To remove coke and restore the initial activity and selectivity, catalysts must be oxidatively regenerated. Such regeneration results in restructuring of the active Pt and CrOx species and, consequently, in a gradual loss of the catalytic performance with a growing number of DH/regeneration cycles,19 while VOx-based catalysts remain stable.15, 16 It was also demonstrated that VOx/MCM-41 maintains higher stability than its CrOx counterpart in a given DH cycle,15 which, combined with VOx better durability, sets a case for further investigation of vanadium oxide catalysts as a potential alternative to commercial chromium oxide analogs.
Thorough understanding of the process(es) responsible for coke deposition and removal is highly important for further development of novel or improving of the existing catalysts. The analytical methods typically employed to study the phenomenon include temperature-programmed oxidation of spent catalysts, as well as in situ spectroscopic and thermogravimetric techniques. The latter in situ methods allow kinetic analysis of coke formation and thus make deeper fundamental understanding of coke formation possible. They were instrumental in elucidating relations between coking behavior and catalytic activity in several reactions20–23 including propane dehydrogenation on CrOx-24, 25 and Pt-based26–28 catalysts. To our knowledge, there are no mechanistic and kinetic studies of coke formation in propane DH over VOx-based catalysts.
The purpose of the current work was to elucidate physico–chemical properties of VOx-based catalysts responsible for coke deposition in propane DH and hence detrimental for their on-stream stability. To this end, we prepared catalysts comprising highly dispersed or polymerized VOx species on the supports of different acidity [SiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2–Al2O3 (Siral)] as well as nanocrystalline V2O5 on a single selected Siral. Their on-stream activity and selectivity in propane DH were determined under industrially relevant conditions, and the kinetics of coke formation was derived from time-resolved in situ thermogravimetric experiments.
Results and Discussion
Determination of VOx molecular structures
The degree of polymerization of surface VOx species was evaluated by in situ UV/Vis spectroscopy at 550 °C in air to exclude the effect of adsorbed water. This technique has been successfully employed by many researchers to distinguish between isolated, polymerized VOx species or crystalline V2O5 in supported vanadium-containing catalysts.29–40 In Figure 1, the UV/Vis spectra of 5 V/MCM-41, 4 V/S10, 6 V/S10, 13 V/S10 and 3 V/Al2O3 are shown (for abbreviations see Experimental Section). Briefly, the number in front gives the rounded vanadium weight content, the index in the Siral formula stands for a weight percentage of SiO2. The spectra of other V/Siral catalysts with V loading of 4–5 wt % were similar to that of 4 V/S10.

UV/Vis spectra of selected catalysts collected at 550 °C in air.
A broad adsorption maximum at approximately 300 nm in the spectrum of 5 V/MCM-41 stems from O2− to V5+ charge-transfer transitions and is characteristic of highly dispersed dehydrated VO4 species.33, 36, 37, 41 The red shift and broadening of the maximum take place if such species become connected via oxygen bridges or if three-dimensional V2O5 is formed.33, 37, 41 For a qualitative comparison of the catalysts with respect to the kind of VOx species, we calculated the edge energy (EEdge) from the UV/Vis spectra according to the procedure described in Ref. 42. The results are given in Table 1. As expected, EEdge decreased with increasing apparent V surface density (Figure 2 a) and reached the lowest value for 13 V/S10. This catalyst possessed crystalline V2O5 [PDF#00-074-1595] with an average crystallite size of 65 nm as determined by XRD analysis, whereas all other samples were free of XRD-detectable vanadia.

EEdge of VOx species versus a) apparent V surface density and b) specific support acidity measured by in situ FTIR pyridine adsorption at 150 °C: Numbers in the squares: 1) 3 V/Al2O3, 2) 4 V/S1, 3) 4 V/S10, 4) 6 V/S10, 5) 13 V/S10, 6) 5 V/S40, 7) 5 V/S70, and 8) 5 V/MCM-41. Apparent V surface density was calculated as a ratio of V atoms to catalyst surface area.
However, the loading and hence the surface V density was not the only factor determining the degree of polymerization of VOx species. Acidity of the supports on which VO(acac)2 was grafted also influenced the final distribution of VOx species, as shown in Figure 2 b. Clearly, for the catalysts with low V surface coverage, EEdge decreases with an increase in acidity of the corresponding pristine supports. In other words, higher acidity favors formation of higher polymerized VOx species. Contrarily, for the catalysts with high V surface density, for example, 13 V/S10 and, to a lesser extent, 6 V/S10, VOx particles were larger than follows from the trend. This deviation suggests that support acidity plays less or no role in determining the size of VOx particles if the support surface coverage with V approaches or exceeds a monolayer.
On-stream catalytic performance
For all catalysts tested, propylene was the main product, and methane, ethane, ethylene, and C4 and C5 hydrocarbons were gas-phase side products. In Figure 3 propane conversion is shown as a function of time on stream. The corresponding data for selectivity to propylene and carbon are given in Supporting Information, Figure S1. For all catalysts, the initial propane conversion was below the equilibrium conversion of 0.43 calculated for the current experimental conditions. Clearly, the catalysts differed substantially in their on-stream stability and selectivity to carbon. 5 V/MCM-41 and 5 V/S70 showed the highest stability and the lowest carbon selectivity with the latter being between 1 and 5 % over the duration of DH test. In contrast, this selectivity over other tested catalysts dropped from approximately 15 % at the beginning to zero towards the end of the test. The decrease in Scarbon was concomitant with the activity loss, which was especially rapid on 3 V/Al2O3 and 13 V/S10, making these two catalysts the least stable.

To quantitatively compare the catalysts in terms of their on-stream stability, we estimated the constant of deactivation rate by fitting of the experimental data in Figure 3 to the kinetic model expressed in Equation (1). The deactivation rate was assumed to be of the first order and independent of the concentration of gas-phase species. The reactor was modeled as isothermal plug–flow. Both the constant of deactivation rate (kdeac) and the constant of propane dehydrogenation (kDH) were the fitting parameters.

where p(C3H8), p(C3H6), and p(H2) are the partial pressures of the respective gases. Keq is the equilibrium constant of propane DH (1.36×104 Pa at 550 °C) and t is time.
In Figure 3, the experimental data points and the “deactivation” curves obtained through modeling are displayed. Apparently, the model correctly predicts evolution of propane conversion with time on stream over all catalysts. The deactivation rate constant (kdeac) obtained from the fitting is given in Table 1.
If kdeac values are related to the corresponding EEdge (Table 1, Figure 6 d), it becomes evident that kdeac increases as EEdge decreases, that is, smaller VOx species (high EEdge) deactivate slower. To gain further fundamental insight into this relationship, we analyzed the kinetics of carbon formation under propane DH conditions by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with a simultaneous analysis of gas-phase products.
In situ monitoring of catalyst reduction and carbon deposition
In Figure 4, the weight-change curves are shown obtained in the in situ TGA experiments on the catalysts in a flow of C3H8/He=50:50. For all catalysts, the curves feature an initial drop followed by a rise, yet their temporal evolution strongly varies between the catalysts. The initial weight loss commences in two steps occurring in the temperature ranges of 90–450 and 450–550 °C (Figure S2). The mass spectrometry (MS) measurements performed simultaneously with TGA revealed evolution of water on all catalysts also proceeding in two steps with the maxima falling into the 170–270 °C and 500–550 °C ranges (Figure S3).

The first step was ascribed to desorption of physically adsorbed water, and the second to the loss of lattice oxygen from VOx species upon their reduction by propane and/or reaction products. The latter phenomenon was reported in several previous studies.43–49 Dehydroxylation of the surface may occur in a wider range of temperatures and thus contributes to both weight-loss steps. Noteworthy is the difference between 13 V/S10 and two other V/S10 catalysts (Figure S3 c). On the former, the low-temperature peak of water desorption (at ≈190 °C) is negligible compared to the one related to water formation through reduction of VOx species by propane in the 300–550 °C range. On the latter two catalysts, both peaks are of comparable height. Recalling that Siral 10 surface in 13 V/S10 is covered by more than a monolayer of VOx, it can be hypothesized that water adsorption on VOx and V2O5 is hindered compared to that on Siral 10 resulting in a relatively small “desorption” peak. On other hand, the “reduction” peak of 13 V/S10 has two maxima caused by participation of surface and bulk lattice oxygen of V2O5 in water formation.
Besides H2O, H2 was observed during the second step of weight loss indicating beginning of nonoxidative DH reaction. Simultaneous evolution of water and hydrogen stems from the fact that oxidative and nonoxidative dehydrogenation run concurrently at the earliest stage of the reaction over initially oxidized catalysts. After approximately 20 min on stream, the intensity of H2O signal drops sharply suggesting that VOx reduction likewise oxidative propane dehydrogenation are largely completed. The intensity of H2 keeps growing indicating that the DH reaction proceeds further via a nonoxidative route.
Once water is removed from the catalysts through the processes discussed above, the weight curves start ascending because of continuous accumulation of coke on the catalysts. It is evident that the trends in weight increase in Figure 4 varied dramatically between the catalysts. 4 V/S1 and 4 V/S10 showed the strongest weight gain that lasted over entire duration of the experiment. Contrarily, the weight curves of 3 V/Al2O3 and 13 V/S10 are characterized by fast increase in the first 6 h on stream followed by a moderate growth phase that flattened into a plateau by the end of the experiment. Specifically, during the first 6 h on stream, 3 V/Al2O3 and 13 V/S10 added respectively 73 and 65 % of their total weight gain. Further, 5 V/S40 sustained a slow increase through the whole test, whereas 5 V/S70 and 5 V/MCM-41 gained very little weight.
To compare the rates of carbon deposition on different catalysts quantitatively, we kinetically evaluated the weight change curves starting from the second step of water formation (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane). To this end, we used Equation (2) for describing both oxygen removal from VOx and coke deposition (descending and ascending parts of the TGA curves in Figure 4 respectively). The first term in this equation accounts for coke formation as originally suggested in Refs.24–26 for evaluation of similar experiments of propane dehydrogenation over Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts. In these studies, coke formation with its own kinetics was assumed to take place i) over coke-free surface of the catalysts to yield “carbon” monolayer as well as ii) over formed coke species resulting in multilayer deposits. The second term in Equation (2) describes removal of lattice oxygen from oxidized (+5 or +4) VOx species in form of water and carbon oxides.
(2)
where ▵mcoke is a weight gain from a monolayer of carbon, kcoke(m) and kcoke(M) respectively are the rate constants of coke formation over carbon-free catalyst surface and over already existing carbon deposits. ΔmO and kO stand for a weight loss upon reduction of oxidized VOx species and the rate constant of this process.
The kinetic model assumed here provides a good description of the weight curves. The experimental TGA data and their fitting are shown in Figure 5 for 5 V/MCM-41 and 4 V/S10 selected as examples of the catalysts with very different coking behavior. The data fitting overlays for other catalysts are given in Figure S4. Importantly, the goodness of fit of the curves for all catalysts with the exception of 3 V/Al2O3 and 13 V/S10 was not sensitive to the kcoke(M) value. The latter therefore could be set to zero suggesting that not enough carbon was deposited to form a monolayer. In the case of 3 V/Al2O3 and 13 V/S10, inclusion of kcoke(M) in the fitting procedure improved the goodness of fit significantly indicating that carbon monolayer was formed on these two catalysts and further coke deposition took place over that monolayer. Apparently, one reason behind formation of the monolayer on 3 V/Al2O3 and 13 V/S10 is their low specific surface area.

Comparison between calculated (line) and experimental (open circles) TGA profiles recorded during propane DH over a) 5 V/MCM-41 and b) 4 V/S10. Experimental conditions as in Figure 4.
As seen from Table 1, the obtained values of kcoke(M) are in general significantly lower than those of kcoke(m) meaning that formation of coke on already deposited carbon layer proceeds much slower than on carbon-free surfaces of the catalysts. It is in agreement with the results previously obtained for coke formation in propane DH over Cr2O3/Al2O3 described by the same kinetic model.25 Two important observations regarding the rate constant of coke formation over carbon-free surfaces should be emphasized:
For the catalysts with V loading of 3–5 wt %, kcoke(m) increases with Al content in the support from the minimum on 5 V/MCM-41 (0.5×10−3 min−1) to the maximum on 3 V/Al2O3 (5.49×10−3 min−1).
Vanadium loading and consequently its surface density also influence the kcoke(m) constant. It rises from 1.96×10−3 to 7.07⋅10−3 min−1 as V loading increases from 4.2 to 13.2 wt % for the V/S10 catalysts.
Factors governing coke formation and on-stream stability
Catalyst acidity is often reported to be one of the important parameters determining coke formation and deactivation in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2–C4 alkanes.50–55 To test this hypothesis, we constructed plots showing the relationship between surface-normalized catalyst acidity and the rate constants of coke formation kcoke(m) (Figure 6 a) and catalyst deactivation kdeac (Figure 6 b). Despite the fact that most acidic 3 V/Al2O3 and 13 V/S10 deactivated faster than all other catalysts, no general correlation for all tested catalysts could be discerned. Yet, if kcoke(m) and kdeac are plotted versus EEdge of VOx species, one can see trends holding for all catalysts (Figure 6 c and d). Both constants increase as EEdge decreases suggesting that the degree of oligomerization of surface VOx species affects coke formation and catalyst deactivation, that is, the larger the species, the faster these processes. Remarkably, loss of activity accelerates as carbon deposition mounts, which becomes especially visible if kdeac is plotted versus kcoke(m) as in Figure 7. This correlation suggests that carbon deposits directly on the surface of VOx sites shielding them from propane and thus resulting in catalyst deactivation.

To deepen our understanding of the effect of VOx species size on coke formation, we performed catalytic tests with a feed containing propylene (11.4 vol. % C3H6 in N2) as it is known to be a coke precursor. To distinguish between the coke formed on the supports and on VOx, the catalysts with highly dispersed, moderately, and highly polymerized VOx species, that is, 5 V/MCM-41, 4 V/S10 and 3 V/Al2O3, correspondingly, and the respective pristine supports were investigated. After exposing the above catalysts and supports to the C3H6/N2 feed for 3 h, the spent materials were analyzed by TPO to determine the amount of carbon deposits. The amount of deposited carbon is found in Table 2.

Zero propylene conversion was observed over pristine MCM-41, which remained snow-white after 3 h on stream. TPO analysis did not reveal any carbon-containing species on this material. Contrarily, propylene conversion and carbon deposits were observed on 5 V/MCM-41. Therefore, we can safely conclude that coke formation on 5 V/MCM-41 during the catalytic tests with propylene and propane occurred exclusively on VOx species. In the case of 4 V/S10, coke was formed on both the support and VOx. However, the amount deposited on 4 V/S10 was 4.2 times higher than that on pristine S10. This evidences that VOx species on this catalyst are significantly more active in coke formation than the support, especially given that the support is partially covered by VOx. In the case of 3 V/Al2O3, for which V coverage exceeds one monolayer, coke formation occurs entirely on VOx; the amount of carbon on the catalyst was 8.8 times higher than on pristine Al2O3. These comparisons certainly verify that VOx species function as the sites for coke formation and are substantially more active in this process than acidic sites on S10 and γ-Al2O3. The fact that the amount of carbon deposited on 3 V/Al2O3 and Al2O3 is lower than on other catalysts and pristine S10 stems from their fast deactivation.
Returning to the correlation between size and activity of VOx species in coke formation, we calculated the initial rate (rV) of carbon formation per weight of V [Eq. (9)] for estimating intrinsic activity of differently sized VOx species. The activity of acidic sites on S10 was neglected for the reasons discussed above. The rate values found in Table 2 indicate that carbon deposition on 3 V/Al2O3 proceeds much faster than on 5 V/MCM-41. Recalling that a certain fraction of V atoms on the former catalyst is buried in multilayers, the difference between the catalysts must be even larger. The rV obtained on 4 V/S10 falls between the values of 3 V/Al2O3 and 5 V/MCM-41, which matches the arrangement of the catalysts’ VOx species according to their size.
Based on the fact that coke deposition takes place on VOx species, the effect of their size on coking rate can be explained as follows. From a mechanistic viewpoint, adsorbed propylene molecules interact with each other to initially form small aromatic structure followed by further oligomerization and condensation to large graphitic structures.9 As for isolated VOx sites, they should be located in close proximity to each other to oligomerize. Alternatively, adsorbed propylene or its fragments may migrate from one VOx species to another, on which they can further transform into coke. Upon increasing apparent V surface density and the size of VOx species, a probability of interaction between several adsorbed propylene molecules increases resulting in a higher rate of carbon deposition. The highest rate will be achieved if the support surface is completely covered by highly polymerized VOx species or crystalline V2O5 as in 3 V/Al2O3. Exactly this trend was observed experimentally.
Conclusions
Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation to propylene over VOx species supported on Al2O3–SiO2 with SiO2 content varying from 0 to 100 wt. % was studied in conventional catalytic tests and by in situ thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Kinetic evaluation of the obtained data combined with characterization of VOx species allowed novel insight into coke formation. Irrespective of the kind of the supported VOx species, they are more active in coke formation from propylene than acidic sites of the supports. The kinetic analysis of TGA profiles enabled us to conclude that carbon monolayer–multilayer model quite accurately described this process. A clear correlation between the rate constant of carbon deposition and that of catalyst deactivation was found thus verifying that resistance to coking determines catalysts on-stream stability. Importantly, the rate constant of carbon deposition strongly increased with the degree of VOx polymerization reaching the maximum on nanocrystalline V2O5. This tendency was rationalized through a general mechanism of coke formation. To form carbon precursors from adsorbed propylene or its fragments, they should be located in close proximity to each other. Such situation is easily realized on large VOx species, whereas on the smaller ones it is statistically less probable. As coke formation proceeds faster on larger VOx particles, the catalysts designed for long-term stability in propane dehydrogenation shall have high coverage of the support with small or even isolated VOx species.

Preparation of catalytic materials
To prepare supported catalysts we used γ-Al2O3 (NorPro Saint-Gobain), SiO2 (MCM-41) and SiO2–Al2O3 (Siral 1, 10, 40, and 70, provided by Sasol) as supports. The index in the Siral formula stands for a weight percentage of SiO2. MCM-41 was synthesized as described in Ref. 56. The support densities starting from Al2O3 and going in the direction of increasing SiO2 content were 0.641, 0.591, 0.517, 0.352, 0.313, and finally 0.303 g cm−3 for MCM-41. The procedure from Ref. 16 was used for deposition of VOx species on the supports. Briefly, vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2, 2.6 g) was dissolved in dry toluene (1 L). Hereafter, a dried support (10 g) was added to this solution, which was then stirred for 24 h. Then the solid was isolated, washed in toluene twice, dried, and calcined in air at 550 °C for 12 h. To deposit higher loadings of VOx on Siral 10, we used amounts of VO(acac)2 of 9.4 or 18.8 g to prepare 1 L toluene solutions. The catalysts are abbreviated as 3 V/Al2O3, 4 V/S1, 4 V/S10, 6 V/S10, 13 V/S10, 5 V/S40, 5 V/S70, and 5 V/MCM-41 with vanadium weight content rounded to the whole number shown in front of the abbreviation. The exact content is given in Table 1.
Catalyst characterization
Nitrogen adsorption isotherms collected at 77 K on BELSORP-mini II (BEL Japan) were used to calculate the specific surface area of the calcined catalysts applying the Brunauer, Emmet and Teller (BET) equation for N2 relative pressure range of 0.05<P/P0<0.30. The BET values are provided in Table 1.
The vanadium content of the calcined catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP–OES, Varian 715-ES).
X-ray diffraction was performed on the theta/theta diffractometer X’PertPro from Panalytical (Almelo; The Netherlands) equipped with the X’celerator RTMS detector system using Cu Kα 1/2 radiation (l=1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA). The alignment was checked against a silicon standard. The data were collected in the 2θ range of 5–70° with a total measurement time of 12 min. The phase composition of the samples was determined using the program suite WINXPow by STOE&CIE with inclusion of the Powder Diffraction File PDF2 of the ICDD (International Centre of Diffraction Data). The Scherrer equation was applied to calculate the V2O5 [PDF#00–074–1595] average crystallite size from the reflection at 2θ of 26.13°.
The UV/Vis spectra of fresh catalysts were collected at 550 °C using an in-house developed setup described in Ref. 57. Prior to the analysis, the samples were conditioned at the same temperature in a flow of synthetic air for 1 h. The AVASPEC UV/Vis spectrometer (Avantes) used in the study was equipped with a DH-2000 deuterium-halogen light source and a CCD array detector. BaSO4 was used as a white reference standard. All UV/Vis spectra are presented as Kubelka-Munk function F(R∞) calculated according to Equation (3),

For determining catalyst acidity, we performed IR measurements of adsorbed pyridine. They were performed in transmission mode on a Bruker Tensor 27 FT IR spectrometer equipped with a heated and evacuated custom made reaction cell with CaF2 windows connected to a gas dosing and evacuation system. The powdery samples (50 mg) were pressed into self-supporting wafers with a diameter of 20 mm. Before pyridine adsorption, the samples were pretreated at 400 °C for 10 min in synthetic air followed by cooling to 150 °C and evacuation. Pyridine was adsorbed at 150 °C until saturation. Then the reaction cell was evacuated for removing physisorbed pyridine. The IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded at 150 °C.
Continuous-flow catalytic tests
Catalytic propane DH tests were performed in a multichannel setup equipped with 15 plug–flow fixed-bed quartz tube reactors (Øid=3.8 mm) operated in parallel. Each reactor was filled with 300 mg (315–710 μm grain fraction) of the fresh catalyst. The catalysts were heated to 550 °C (5 K min−1) in synthetic air (10 mL min−1 per reactor), held in the air flow for 1 h and then purged with N2 for 20 min. Hereafter a mixture of 40 vol % C3H8 in N2 was fed at a rate of 6 mL min−1 per reactor. All catalytic experiments were performed at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.94 h−1 and a pressure of 1.2 bar. The experiments were run for 25 h followed by cooling the reactors to RT in N2. Catalytic experiments aimed to study coking behavior of selected catalysts and their respective supports were performed in a feed containing 11.5 vol % of propylene in nitrogen at 550 °C. This propylene concentration was determined to be an average in propane DH tests. The experiments designed to quantify the amount of carbon deposited on catalysts and supports were performed at WHSV of 0.26 h−1 and lasted for 3 h. To find the initial propylene conversion rates, 5 V/MCM-41, 4 V/S10 and 3 V/Al2O3 were tested at WHSV of 2.6 h−1 for 1 h. The initial rates of propylene conversion were calculated as mol(C3H6) converted per mol(V) per hour at zero time on stream. The initial conversion values were obtained from fitting the X(C3H6) curves by Equation (1).
The feed components and the reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N) equipped with PLOT/Q (for CO2), HP-PLOT Al2O3 “KCl” (for hydrocarbons) and Molsieve 5 (for H2, O2, N2, and CO) columns, flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors. The analyses were performed successively, reactor by reactor. The propane conversion (X(C3H8)) was calculated from the inlet () and outlet () propane molar flows [Eq. (4)]. The outlet flow was corrected with respect to the flow of nitrogen to take into account reaction-induced changes in the number of moles of gas-phase components. The propylene yield (Y(C3H6)) and selectivity to propylene (S(C3H6)) and carbon (S(carbon) were calculated according to Equations (5), (6), and (7), respectively. Yield and selectivity of the side products methane, ethane, ethylene, C4 and C5 hydrocarbons, CO, and CO2 were calculated accordingly taking into account their different numbers of C atoms., , , , ,

In situ thermogravimetric and temperature-programmed tests
The thermogravimetric setup described in Ref. 20 consisted of a thermobalance SETSYS Evolution (Setaram) and an on-line mass spectrometer OmniStar GSD 301 (Pfeiffer). A catalyst sample (50 mg) was loaded into a quartz cap suspended inside a thermobalance furnace. The sample was heated to 550 °C at 10 K min−1 in a flow of 7.7 % O2 in He and held at this temperature for 12 h to oxidize VOx species. After cooling to RT, a C3H8:He=50:50 mixture was fed at 20 mL min−1 for approximately 30 min. Hereafter, the reactor was heated to 550 °C at 30 K min−1 in the same flow and held at this temperature for 24 h. Weight of the sample was continuously measured over the entire experiment. The reaction products and propane were monitored by mass spectrometry.
The amount of carbon deposits formed during catalytic experiments was determined from the amount of CO and CO2 evolved during temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of spent catalysts. TPO measurements were performed in a setup equipped with eight individually heated plug–flow fixed-bed quartz tube reactors of 6.9 mm inner diameter. The used catalysts were heated to 900 °C at 10 K min−1 in a flow (10 mL min−1) of 10 vol. % O2 in Ar. Oxygen consumption and formation of reaction products were monitored by a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar 200). The following atomic mass units (AMUs) were analyzed: 44 (CO2), 40 (Ar), 32 (O2), 28 (CO, CO2), and 18 (H2O). The concentrations of O2, CO, and CO2 were determined from the respective AMUs using standard fragmentation patterns and sensitivity factors determined by analyzing calibration gas mixtures.
