Abstract
Hierarchical SAPO-34 assembled from nanosheets was synthesized via in situ growth at low temperature, and then was served as support to prepare Pt-based catalyst for promoting the dehydrogenation performance of ammonia borane. The prepared Pt/SAPO-34 catalysts were characterized by XRD, ICP, SEM, TEM, XPS, HAADF-STEM, N2 adsorption-desorption and NH3-TPD. Contrary to traditional microporous Pt/SAPO-34-M catalyst, hierarchical Pt/SAPO-34-H catalysts possessed larger surface area to strengthen metal dispersion, which further improved catalytic activity and reusability. At the same time, the increase in SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of Pt/SAPO-34-H under the same metal loading was beneficial for enhancing the catalytic activity. Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 with SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 0.6 showed outstanding catalytic performance and high turnover frequency (TOF) value (131
) at 30 °C on account of the synergistic effect of Brønsted acidic sites and Pt metal dispersion.

1. Introduction
Hydrogen energy is regarded as the clean energy with the most development potential in the future, so many countries and regions have extensively carried out hydrogen energy research in the world [1]. Hydrogen evolution from water electrolysis is a promising way to produce pure hydrogen [2], but the expensive cost hinders its practical application in hydrogen energy industry. The ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) is considered as one of the most attractive candidates for chemical hydrogen storage because of its low molecular weight, superior solubility in water, high hydrogen content, and good room temperature stability, as well as low cost hydrogen evaluation without emission of toxic compound [[3], [4]–5]. In recent years, supported metal catalysts, such as noble metals (Pt [6,7], Ru [8,9], Pd [10]), non-noble metals (Co [11], Ni [12]) and alloys (PtCo [13], RuNi [14]), are widely used for the hydrolysis of AB. Among them, noble metals have exhibited superior catalytic properties, especially platinum. However, it is worth mentioning that the choice of supports is also crucial, because suitable supports are the beginning of successful catalytic reaction [[15], [16]–17]. Several commonly used supports include microporous zeolites [18,19], mesoporous silica [20], porous carbon [21] and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) [22].
As a member of the supports for metal-based catalysts, zeolite does not exist as an inert counterpart. In addition to its own superior structural stability, large surface area and regular pore channels, mild acidity plays a significant role in the reaction [[23], [24]–25]. Chandra and Xu [26] found that H+ from solid acids or carbonic acid exhibited significant activity for the dissociation and hydrolysis of aq. NH3BH3 solution at room temperature. Sun et al. [27] revealed that the interaction between Ru clusters and adjacent Brønsted acid sites of SAPO-34 zeolites synergistically promoted the hydrogen evolution rate of AB hydrolysis. Large external surface was also proved to be beneficial for anchoring metal species to improve the catalytic performance.
Compared with microporous zeolites, zeolites with hierarchically porous structure are more conducive to the exposure of acidic sites. The preparation of hierarchical zeolites include hard template method [28], soft template method [29] and post-treatment method [30]. Hard template materials such as carbon are usually non-hydrophilic, which will result in a weak interaction between the hard template and synthesis gel. Furthermore, the hard template method is relatively expensive and generally requires post-treatment to remove the crystallized solid template, hindering further industrial application. Compared with hard template, soft template is more widely used because it has greater flexibility and adaptability. The morphology and hierarchical structure of the zeolites can be directly controlled by adjusting the amount of the soft templates, however, the relatively expensive solvent used by the soft template cannot be underestimated. The preparation procedure for hierarchical zeolites by post-treatment is simple and versatile but uncontrollable. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a simple and cost-effective method to synthesize hierarchical zeolites to avoid such problems.
In this study, hierarchical SAPO-34 zeolites with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratio were synthesized by in-situ growth, and microporous SAPO-34 was also synthesized for comparison. On the above basis, Pt/SAPO-34 catalysts were prepared by using hierarchical and microporous SAPO-34 as supports and their catalytic performances in AB hydrolysis were investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals and materials
Pseudoboehmite (Al2O3, 67 wt%), phosphoric acid (H3PO4, 85 wt%), silica sol (SiO2, 40 wt%), triethylamine (TEA, 99 wt%), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr, 99 wt%), and AB (NH3BH3, 97 wt%) were used as raw materials. All the chemical materials were used directly without further purification.
2.2. The synthesis of SAPO-34
2.2.1. Synthesis of hierarchical SAPO-34
The gel ratio for hierarchical SAPO-34 was 0.8 Al2O3: 1.0 P2O5: x SiO2: 50 H2O: 1.8 TEA: 1.5 TEABr (x = 0.5, 0.4, 0.32, 0.24, 0.16). The typical synthetic process was as follows: 1.65 g of pseudoboehmite was firstly added to 16.31 g of deionized water, followed by continuous stirring for 30 min at 80 °C. After that, 4.61 g of phosphoric acid was added dropwise to the mixture under stirring at room temperature. Then 1.50 g of silica sol was added and stirred for 30 min. Finally, 3.68 g of triethylamine and 6.37 g of tetraethylammonium bromide were successively supplemented to the mixture. The mixture was further stirred for 3 h and then crystallized at 120 °C for 48 h in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave under tumbling. Then the crystallized product was centrifuged and washed with distilled water. The obtained solid-like products was dried at 80 °C overnight and finally calcined in air at 550 °C for 10 h. The hierarchical SAPO-34 with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratio were denoted as SAPO-34-H-X (X = 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2).
2.2.2. Synthesis of microporous SAPO-34
For comparison, traditional microporous SAPO-34 zeolite with a gel ratio of 1 Al2O3: 1.0 P2O5: 0.2 SiO2: 50 H2O: 3 TEA was synthesized. 2.06 g of pseudoboehmite was firstly added to 16.89 g of deionized water, followed by continuous stirring for 30 min at 80 °C. After that, 4.61 g of phosphoric acid was added dropwise to the mixture under stirring at room temperature. Then 0.6 g of silica sol was added and stirred for 30 min. Finally, 6.13 g of triethylamine was successively supplemented to the mixture. The mixture was further stirred for 72 h and then sealed in a 100 ml Teflon-lined steel autoclave and heated in an air-circulating oven at 200 °C for 24 h under autogeneous pressure. The resulting crystals were dried at 80 °C overnight, followed by calcination in air at 550 °C for 10 h. The obtained sample was designated as SAPO-34-M-0.2.
2.3. Synthesis of Pt/SAPO-34 catalysts
Pt/SAPO-34 catalysts were prepared by impregnation method. Typically, 1 g of calcined SAPO-34 was impregnated b 1 mL H2PtCl6 aqueous solution (1 wt%). The mixture was sonicated for 30 min and then kept static for 12 h to make Pt highly disperse on the support. The mixture was dried at 80 °C overnight, and then reduced with NaBH4 aqueous solution (1 M) for 4 h. The prepared catalysts were named as Pt/SAPO-34-H-X (X = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6) and Pt/SAPO-34-M-0.2.
2.4. Hydrogen production of AB
Fig. 1 showed the equipment for the test of hydrogen generation from AB. A three-necked round-bottomed flask and an inverted measuring cylinder filled with water acted as dehydrogenation reaction and gas measurement section, respectively were connected via a rubber tube. The process of hydrolysis catalyzed by AB was similar to that described by Ge and others [31]. Typically, 100 mg catalyst and 20 mL distilled water were mixed thoroughly by ultrasonic pretreatment in the flask. The flask was placed in a water bath with magnetic stirring (700 rpm) at a preset temperature. Then, 20 mg AB was quickly added, and timing started when hydrogen generation was observed. The volume of produced H2 was obtained by periodically measuring the capacity of water in the cylinder. The reaction was finished when no bubbles were observed.

Fig. 1. The equipment for the test of hydrogen generation from AB.
To explore the hydrolysis kinetics of AB over the optimal catalyst, a series of hydrogen evolution with varying initial AB concentrations (e.g., 16.5, 33, 49.5, 66 mM) and catalyst concentrations (e.g., 50, 100, 150, 200 mg) were carried out. The activation energy (Ea) value of the reaction system was calculated by varying the reaction temperature from 15 to 30 °C under the reaction conditions of 20 mg of AB, 100 mg of catalyst, and 20 mL of deionized water.
The durability of the Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 catalyst was conducted at 30 °C under the reaction conditions of 20 mg of AB, 100 mg of catalyst, and 20 of mL deionized water. After finishing run, another 20 mg of AB was added to start the next run.
2.5. Calculation section
The total turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated based on the quantity of Pt metal atoms in the catalysts when the conversion of AB achieved to 100%. The equation for TOF calculation was listed as below:
Where P is the atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa),
is the total volume of the released gas, R is the universal gas constant (8.3145 m3 Pa mol−1 K−1), T is the room temperature (298 K), nPt is the mole of Pt atoms in catalyst, and t is the completion time of the reaction in minute.
The activation energy (Ea) for the catalytic hydrolysis of AB was evaluated based on the Arrhenius equation:
Where R and T are gas constant and reaction temperature, respectively.
2.6. Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted with a RINT2000 vertical goniometer using Cu Ka radiation operated at 150 mA and 40 kV. XRD patterns were scanned at a step size 0.02o in the 2θ range of 5–60o.The morphology of sample was viewed by a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, SU8010, FE-SEM). The morphology and element mapping were examined using JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL) and JEM-2100F high angle annular dark field scanning (HAADF-STEM, JEOL; Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured by a CAE analyzer mode (Al K Alpha, Pass Energy 30.0 eV). The NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiments were performed on a Micromeritics AutChem II 2920 apparatus equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiments were proceeded on a Micromerities ASAP 2010 system at -196 °C. The specific surface area (SBET) was determined based on the BET equation. The t-plot methods were applied to ascertain the external surface area (Sext), micropore surface area (Smicro) and micropore volume (Vmicro). The mesoporous volume (Vmeso) was calculated by the BJH method based on adsorption isotherm. The Pt contents of samples were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometer (Agilent 730).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization
Fig. 2 showed the SEM images of SAPO-34-H-0.6 crystallized at 120 °C from 12 to 48 h. When the crystallization time was 12 h, a few SAPO-34 crystals wrapped around the amorphous phase appeared. With the increase of the crystallization time from 12 to 36 h, the amorphous phase disappeared gradually, and the SAPO-34 aggregates composed of plate-like nanocrystals were formed finally. Further increasing to 48 h, the morphology and crystal sizes were not change obviously. In addition, in contrast to the conventional SAPO-34-M-0.2 crystals with flat surface, the hierarchical SAPO-34-H-0.2 displayed flower morphology with a large number of nanosheets on the crystal surface (Fig. 3), resulting from assembly of nanocrystallines.

The XRD patterns of Pt/SAPO-34 samples showed the characteristic diffraction peaks of SAPO-34 (Fig. 4), which was consistent with standard card peaks associated with the CHA structure (JCPDS with reference code 00-037-0359) [28,32]. The characteristic peaks for Pt metal were not observed in the XRD patterns of the Pt/SAPO-34 due to the small metal nanoparticles and high dispersion. The peak intensity of Pt/SAPO-34-M-0.2 was significantly higher than that of Pt/SAPO-34-H because of the larger grain size of Pt/SAPO-34-M-0.2, which was consistent with the SEM results shown in Fig. 3. The samples Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6, Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.2 and Pt/SAPO-34-M-0.2 all possessed a similar metal loading of ca. 1 wt% (Table 1).

The hierarchical structures were more conducive to metal loading and fixing for supported metal catalysts [33]. The TEM images of Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 shown in Fig. 5a and b exhibited the formation of the flake assembled structures with about 800 nm in diameter. Bright areas shown in the TEM images owing to differences in thickness indicated the existence of intracrystalline mesopores [34,35]. The high resolution platinum nanoparticles could be seen clearly in Fig. 5c, which was enlarge view of the Pt nanoparticles and zeolite lattice. HAADF-STEM and Pt size distributions of Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 were shown in Fig. 5d. Pt nanoparticles with uniform size distribution were well dispersed throughout the SAPO-34 crystals and the average sizes of Pt nanoparticles were approximately 2.65 nm, including the slightly aggregated platinum clusters. The elemental mapping presented in Fig. 5e revealed that elements, including Al, O, P and Si were uniformly distributed in the Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6, and Pt nanoparticles were also highly dispersed on the surface of SAPO-34-H-0.6 (Fig. 5e), and thus should give more active centers for catalytic hydrolysis of AB.

The XPS spectra in Fig. 6 showed binding energies of 71.4 and 74.7 eV for Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 in the Pt/SAPO-34-0.6 catalyst, indicating the presence of metallic Pt (0) [36]. The peak at 74.5 eV was the 2p orbital of Al element that originated from silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, which showed similarity with the former Ref. [37].

The NH3-TPD profiles of all as-synthesized samples were shown in Fig. 7. The acidic concentration of Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6, Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.2 and Pt/SAPO-34-M-0.2 was 0.58, 0.17 and 0.57 mmol/g, respectively, which was measured by peak areas. The Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.2 with low acidity showed much better catalytic performance than Pt/SAPO-34-M-0.2, because the hierarchical structure of Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.2, enhanced the metal dispersion and facilitated molecular mass transfer, which was beneficial to AB hydrolysis. In addition to the hierarchical structure, the enhanced acidity within Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 caused by the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 could improve the hydrolysis reaction due to the increase of H+ ion concentration in reaction system [27].

Fig. 8 showed the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore-size distribution of the prepared samples. Different from the microporous Pt/SAPO-34-M-0.2 catalyst exhibiting a typical type I isotherm, Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.2 and Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 showed the type IV isotherms with hysteresis loops at high relative pressures related to capillary condensation capillary condensation in the intracrystalline pores, indicating the existence of mesopores. BJH pore-size distribution curve of Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.625 in Fig. 8b revealed the existence of mesopores and macropores ranged from 2 to 174 nm centered at around 30 nm, which was consistent with the TEM result. The surface area and pore volume date for above samples were summarized in Table 1. Compared with Pt/SAPO-34-M-0.2, Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 showed similar micropore volume, but the mesopore volume increased significantly from 0.10 to 0.19 cm3 g−1, proving that assembly of nanocrystallines could lead to the formation of mesopores during crystallization. In addition, the external surface area for nanosized Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 catalyst (31 m2 g−1) increased remarkably in comparison to the microporous Pt/SAPO-34-M-0.2 due to mesopore formation [38]. As reported in the literature [39], nanosized zeolites with large external surface areas were considered as superior supports to anchor ultrasmall metal particles. The specific surface area of Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.2 was significantly lower than other catalysts due to the low crystallinity, which was consistent with the XRD result.

3.2. Catalytic hydrolysis of AB
Fig. 9a showed the catalytic properties of Pt/SAPO-34 catalysts for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB at 30 °C. It could be clearly seen that the molar ratio of generated H2/AB over SAPO-34-supported catalysts was 3/1 during the catalytic process, demonstrating the complete dehydrogenation of AB. 7 min was needed for Pt/SAPO-34-M-0.2 as catalyst to 100% decomposition of AB with a TOF value of 56
at the hydrolysis temperature of 30 °C. Compared with Pt/SAPO-34-M-0.2, Pt/SAPO-34-H catalysts showed much better catalytic activity in the hydrolysis of AB, possessing TOF values of 131 and 87 
at 30°C for Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 and Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.2, respectively. The excellent catalytic performance was reasonably attributed to the synergistic effect between Brønsted acid sites and hierarchical pore structures, and Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 catalyst as the best catalyst exhibited more than 2-fold higher TOF value than Pt/SAPO-34-M-0.2 catalyst and was used in the following reaction kinetics studies. In order to prove the effect of acidity on the hydrolysis of AB, pure SAPO-34 was used in the reaction. 1.8 mL H2 was able to generate from pure SAPO-34-H-0.6 zeolite within 4 min at 30 °C, suggesting that acidity promoted the hydrolysis of AB. In addition, it is worth noting that the catalytic performance of Pt/SAPO-34-H catalysts was enhanced with the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 from 0.2 to 0.6 (Fig. 9b).

To investigate the kinetics of AB hydrolysis catalyzed by Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6, controllable hydrogen evolution tests with various AB and catalyst concentrations were performed [40,41]. As shown in Fig. 10a, the volume of hydrogen generated from the catalytic hydrolysis of AB catalyzed by Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 increased with AB concentration, but the slope of logarithmic diagram of hydrogen generation rate versus AB concentration was 0.21, being close to zero-order reaction AB hydrolysis over Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 with respect to AB concentration (Fig. 10b). The straight line with a slope of 1.06 in Fig. 10d exhibited first-order reaction kinetics with respect to catalyst concentration, suggesting that catalyst concentration was the rate-determining step in the hydrolysis reaction.

Fig. 11 showed the H2 generated from AB hydrolysis over Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 catalyst at different reaction temperatures in the range of 15–30 °C. With the increase of reaction temperature from 15 to 30 °C, the H2 evolution rates improved, and the TOF values also increased from 36 to 131 
, as shown in the inset of Fig. 11. 44 mL of H2, corresponding to H2 to AB molar ratio of 3, was generated within 3 min (nPt/nAB = 0.0077), affording a complete decomposition of AB at 30 °C. Fig. 12 showed the plot of lnTOF versus 1/T, which could be used to measure apparent activation energy Ea (61.88 KJ mol−1) according to Arrhenius formula. Comparisions of catalytic activity between our SAPO-34-supported Pt catalyst and other Pt-based catalysts reported in the literatures were listed in Table 2. Using the TOF value as the comparison parameter, the Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 catalyst gained here displayed better catalytic activity compared to the other supported Pt catalysts such as Pt@Co/mCN [42], Pt@PC-POP [44], Pt/SiO2 and Pt/C [45], indicating that hierarchical SAPO-34 supports could promote Pt dispersion as well as the accessibility of the Brønsted acidic sites and thus improve the catalytic performance. The stability of the catalyst was another important factor for H2 generated from AB hydrolysis and the durability of Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 was tested after each successive cycle. As shown in Fig. 13, with the increase of recycling numbers, the rate of AB hydrolysis over Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 catalyst was decreased gradually, but ca. 75% of the initial TOF value (30 °C) was preserved even after 5 cycles, confirming the excellent recycling stability of the prepared Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 catalyst. The decrease in hydrogen generation rate might be due to the coverage of zeolite acidic sites by some intermediates such as NH3BO+ or NH4+ species.

4. Hydrolysis mechanism
According to experimental results, the NH3BH3 hydrolysis mechanism was proposed in Fig. 14. The Pt nanoparticles supported on SAPO-34 zeolites adsorbed AB molecules and activated the B-H bond to make it easily break. The hydrogen ion obtained by the cleavage of the B-H bond was negatively charged. At the same time, Brønsted acid sites situated adjacent to Pt nanoparticles activated water molecule to make them protonation. The protonated water molecule acquired a hydrogen ion and was positively charged, which made it more electrophilic and easily combined with H− to generate hydrogen. Furthermore, H+ could switch between zeolite support and water. Thus, the Brønsted acid sites and Pt metal served as active sites to synergistically facilitate the catalytic dehydrogenation process of AB. The proposed reactions were shown in formula as follows (4-1) to (4-9), in which (4-1) was the total reaction equation [45,49].

5. Conclusions
In this paper, a novel Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 catalyst was prepared by combining in situ growth at low temperature and impregnation methods, in which hierarchical structures of SAPO-34 gave larger surface area and hierarchical pores to promote Pt metal anchoring, Brønsted acidic sites exposure and molecular mass transfer. In comparison to Pt/SAPO-34-M-0.2 and Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.2 catalysts with the same Pt loading, Pt/SAPO-34-H-0.6 with Pt loading of 1 wt% and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 0.6 exhibited superior catalytic performance for the hydrolysis of AB with a turnover frequency of 131
taking advantage of the synergistic effect of Brønsted acidic sites and Pt metal dispersion.

If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
