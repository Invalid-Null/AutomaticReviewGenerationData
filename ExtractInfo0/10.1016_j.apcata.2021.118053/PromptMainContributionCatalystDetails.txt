1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important raw materials in petrochemical industry for the production of various industrial chemicals such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and acrylic acid. To keep up with the increasing global propylene demand, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has dominated propylene capacity addition among the on-purpose propylene technologies over the past 10 years [1]. Compared to the mainstream commercial propylene production routes namely steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha and oil gas, which are high energy-consuming processes and provide low selectivity toward propylene, PDH is a more economical and environmentally friendly approach to produce propylene and also produce H2 as a valuable by-product [[2], [3], [4]]. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is highly endothermic (
= 124.3 kJ/mol) and limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium, which requires a high reaction temperature to achieve high yield of propylene (equilibrium propane conversion at 550 °C is about 30 %) [5,6]. Under severe operating conditions, undesired side reactions and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation are inevitable problems [7]. That has led to the development of better performance PDH catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and long-term stability.
In commercial dehydrogenation technology such as Oleflex developed by UOP, the PDH catalysts are based on bimetallic PtSn supported on Al2O3 [7]. A number of literatures clarify the promotional roles of Sn regarding the modification of geometric and electronic effects. For geometric effect, Sn decreased the size of Pt ensembles and facilitated the dispersion of Pt, suppressing hydrogenolysis and coking reactions [[8], [9], [10]]. For electronic effect, the electron donation from Sn to Pt resulted in the decrease of the heat of adsorption of alkenes and increased the activation barrier of light alkanes [11,12]. Although PtSn based catalysts are quite efficient for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and are being used in industry, catalyst deactivation by coking is an inevitable problem [13]. The oxidative regeneration process at high temperature is therefore needed to restore the catalyst activity frequently [14]. Many efforts have been made to enhance the catalytic performance in PDH by doping other elements such as alkali metal, alkaline-earth metal, and transition metal [[15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]]. These promoters not only neutralize some acid sites of the support, but also change the characteristics of Pt active sites. Currently, PtIn catalysts have especially drawn much attention as the promising bimetallic catalysts for dehydrogenation of light alkanes, comparable to PtSn. Formation of PtIn intermetallic alloy also changed both geometric and electronic properties of Pt [21,22]. On alumina support, the addition of In decreased the Pt ensemble size more effectively than Sn, suggesting a more homogeneous dispersion of Pt-In particles [23]. Roman-Martinez et al. [24] revealed the differences in elemental distribution of the bimetallic phases of PtSn/C and PtIn/C catalysts prepared by co-impregnation and successive impregnation. The state of platinum in PtIn catalysts was found to be less dependent on the preparation method than PtSn. Even though supported bimetallic PtSn and PtIn catalysts have been extensively investigated and believed to be the efficient dehydrogenation catalysts, it remains debatable which element is more effective for enhancing propane dehydrogenation performance. The detailed catalytic properties of PtSn-based compared with PtIn-based catalysts thus are needed to be further discussed.
Because the intrinsic acidity of alumina caused large amount of coke formation and catalyzed side reactions such as cracking, isomerization and polymerization, the use of non-acidic materials especially magnesium aluminum oxides (Mg(Al)O) has received considerable attention as catalyst supports for PDH catalysts owing to their moderate acid characteristics, high thermal stability, and high metal dispersion [15,[25], [26], [27], [28]]. Moreover, the Mg(Al)O support could greatly suppress coke deposition, minimize the adsorption of alkenes as well as modify the properties of Pt particles and provide the strong metal-support interaction [[29], [30], [31]]. Many synthetic techniques have been employed to synthesize Mg(Al)O apart from conventional co-precipitation method. The textural and structural properties of Mg(Al)O are typically dependent on the preparation methods. Sol-gel synthesis has become one of the most promising method due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, which also produces mixed metal oxides with high chemical homogeneity, large surface area and uniform pore size distribution [[32], [33], [34], [35]]. Recently, incorporating promotors into the Mg(Al)O supports further improve propylene selectivity and stability of the catalysts. The presence of SnII/IV sites confined in Mg(Al)O lattices strengthened the interaction with platinum complexes resulted in highly dispersed Pt clusters with excellent durability [36,37]. A recent study from our group, Tolek et al. [38] revealed that the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalyst showed superior catalytic performances compared to the PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst. In species incorporated inside Mg(Al)O structure provided the strong metal-support interaction and established well-dispersed Pt-In alloy nanoparticles. Sun et al. [39] and Wu et al. [40] also observed that on Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts, some of In3+ cations near the support surface and close to Pt were reduced and formed Pt-In bimetallic alloy. The accumulation of carbon significantly decreased as the alloying of In with Pt increased.
In this work, Sn and In incorporated in Mg(Al)O were synthesized via the sol-gel method with various contents of Sn and In and employed as the supports for preparation of supported Pt catalysts. The catalytic performances in the PDH reaction of Pt/MgAl(Sn)O and Pt/MgAl(In)O catalysts were systematically investigated at 550 °C and atmospheric pressure. The influences of Sn and In on the catalytic behaviors of these catalysts were differentiated by comparing their structure-activity relationship described by various characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 physisorption, NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and temperature programmed oxidation (TPO).
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
All the MgAl(Sn)O and MgAl(In)O supports were synthesized using the following procedure. 1.2 g cetyltrimethylammonium bromide was dissolved in 150 mL ethanol at about 60 °C. After stirring for 20 min, the determined amounts of SnCl2.2H2O (or In(NO3)3.xH2O) were added to the solution depending on the desired Sn (or In) loadings. Then, 19.83 g Mg(NO3)2.6H2O and 5.21 g aluminium isopropoxide were dissolved in the solution under vigorous stirring and kept at 60 °C. After mixing for 1 h, 20 mL ammonia aqueous solution (30 wt.%) was slowly dropped to the suspension and further stirred for 2 h at 60 °C. During this stage, the resulting product became more viscous and milky. Subsequently, the obtained solid was collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol until the pH of solution was 7. The sample was dried overnight at 110 °C in an oven and calcined in air at 600 °C for 3 h to gain the mixed oxide support. The different loadings of Sn and In incorporated into Mg(Al)O were denoted as MgAl(xSn)O and MgAl(yIn)O, where x and y represent the mass percentages of Sn and In, respectively.
The Pt/MgAl(xSn)O and Pt/MgAl(yIn)O were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method using H2PtCl6.6H2O as the catalyst precursor. After impregnation, the sample was dried at ambient temperature for 2 h and dried at 110 °C overnight, then calcined at 550 °C for 3 h. The Pt loading was 0.3 wt.% for all catalysts.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted to determine the crystallinity and phase composition of catalysts using a Bruker D8 advance with Ni-filter CuKα radiation. The data were collected in the 2
range of 20° to 80° with a step size of 0.02° and an acquisition time of 0.5 s per step. The textural properties were investigated by N2 adsorption-desorption using Micromeritics Chemisorbs 2750 instrument. The samples were degassed at 200 °C under nitrogen flow before performing the N2 physisorption at −196 °C. The specific surface areas were analyzed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and the pore structural data were calculated applying Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. The acidity of catalysts was examined by NH3-TPD experiments using Micromeritics Chemisorb 2750 automatic system connected with ChemiSoft TPx software. Approximately 0.3 g of catalyst was placed in a quartz U-tube and pretreated at 550 °C for 1 h under He gas flow (25 cm3/min) to remove a moisture. After cooling down, the samples were saturated with 15 %NH3/He gas flow (25 cm3/min) at 40 °C for 30 min and then purged with He gas flow for 1 h. Subsequently, the samples were heated to 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min to desorb ammonia. The NH3 desorption profiles were recorded by using the thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The XPS analysis was performed to investigate the surface electronic states and the elemental composition of the samples. XPS element spectra were carried out using an AMICUS photoelectron spectrometer with a Mg Kα X-ray as a primary excitation and a KRATOS VISION2 software. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of catalysts was obtained on a JEOL JEM-2010 microscope operated at 200 kV. Prior to testing, the samples were dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonic and a small drop of this solution was placed onto carbon-coated copper grids, followed by drying at room temperature. Pt L3-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurement was conducted at beamlines BL1.1 W of the synchrotron light research institute (SLRI), Thailand. The electron storage ring was operated at an electron energy of 1.2 GeV and a double crystal monochromator with Ge (220) was employed for selection of photon energy. The XANES spectra of Pt L3-edge were collected at room temperature in fluorescence mode using ionization chambers. Analysis of the XANES data was processed using Athena software. The coke deposition of spent catalysts was examined by TPO experiments using a Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD detector. Approximately 0.05 g of spent catalyst was placed in the quartz tube and exposed to 1%O2/He gas flow (25 cm3/min). The temperature was increased linearly from room temperature to 700 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min.
2.3. Catalytic evaluation
The propane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in the stainless steel fixed-bed reactor with an internal diameter of 0.75 in. Approximately, 1.5 g of catalyst was packed at the center of the reactor and heated to 550 °C under N2 flow (50 cm3/min). Then, the catalyst was reduced at 550 °C in flowing H2 (50 cm3/min) balanced with N2 (50 cm3/min) for 1 h, and purged with N2 flow for 30 min. Pure propane (20 cm3/min) was fed to the reactor under atmospheric pressure. The reaction was tested for 5 h on stream, and the effluent stream was qualified on an on-line gas chromatography (Agilent 7820A) with a flame ionization detector (FID) using a packed column HP-PLOT Al2O3 “M” deactivated (50 m with 8
m ID). The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were determined by the following formulate:
where
was the propane content in feed,
and
were the contents of propane and propylene in the effluent gas, respectively. All the values were calculated in weight percentages.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of as-prepared catalysts
The textural properties of Sn- and In-incorporated Mg(Al)O supports were determined by N2 adsorption-desorption as reported in Table 1. Considering the MgAl(Sn)O supports, the BET surface areas were quite similar at approximately 145−155 m2/g. Besides, the total pore volume and average pore size were not remarkably altered with the increasing Sn loading. It is reasonable that Sn species were mainly located on the external support surface [41]. Meanwhile, a change in textural properties of the MgAl(In)O supports was observed. The BET surface area and pore volume gradually decreased with increasing In addition. Such results demonstrate that most of In species incorporated into Mg-Al structure. However, when In loading increased, excessive In species could not be entirely incorporated into Mg(Al)O. Some of In species probably covered on the surface and blocked the pore channels, thus decreasing the surface area and pore volume [42,43]. Fig. S1 displays the XRD patterns of all Pt/MgAl(Sn)O and Pt/MgAl(In)O catalysts. All the XRD patterns presented the diffraction peaks of periclase-like MgO (2
= 37°, 43°, 62.2°, 74.6° and 78.6°) as a major crystal phase [44]. It can be inferred that the incorporation of Sn and In species into Mg(Al)O did not destroy the structural characteristic of MgO. Moreover, diffraction peaks corresponding to Pt, Sn, and In species were not detected for all the catalysts because of the high dispersion and/or low concentrations of these metals [27,31].

The influence of Sn and In addition on surface acidity of the catalysts was examined by NH3-TPD experiments. Fig. S2 shows the ammonia desorption profiles of different catalysts and Table 2 illustrates the corresponding semi-quantitative results by deconvoluting the NH3-TPD peaks using a Gaussian function. In general, the ammonia desorption peaks in the temperature ranges of 120−250 °C, 250−350 °C and 350−450 °C were ascribed to weak, medium and strong acid sites, respectively [5,30]. As can be seen, all ammonia desorption peaks were found in the similar temperature region. Notably, the Pt/MgAl(1.7Sn)O catalyst possessed the highest amount of total acidity with the highest fraction of medium acid sites. As reported earlier [45,46], the deposition of SnO2 supported on metal oxides such as SiO2, MgO and CaO presented some acidic properties. The modification of surface acidity at high Sn loading could originate from poor dispersion of SnO2 on the surface. On the contrary, incorporation of In in the Pt/MgAl(In)O catalysts resulted in a lower fraction of medium acid sites. A possible explanation is that In2O3 and SnO2 are considered as amphoteric oxides but indium oxide is regarded mainly basic [19,47], thereby some acid sites were poisoned upon addition of In. Therefore, it can be summarized that the Pt/MgAl(In)O catalysts exhibited relatively weaker acidity than the Pt/MgAl(Sn)O catalysts.

The XPS measurements were carried out to investigate the surface composition and atomic concentration ratio of the prepared samples as displayed in Table 3. The surface atomic ratio of Sn/(Sn + Al) gradually increased with increasing Sn content whereas the In/(In + Al) atomic ratio did not evidently increase with an increase amount of In loading. Taking into account the fact that both the ionic size and valence of the dopant can have an effect on the surface segregation energy [48]. Even though the greater difference in ionic radius between the host cation (
= 0.53
) and the trivalent dopant In (
= 0.79
) was found compared to the tetravalent dopant Sn (
= 0.69
) [49], the results from this study indicated that the difference in ionic valence had more substantial impact on their segregation to the surface. A rising trend of Sn/(Sn + Al) atomic ratio was dominantly observed in comparison with In/(In + Al) atomic ratio, suggesting a significant phase segregation to the surface of Sn cations. After impregnation of Pt, calcination, and reduction at 550 °C, an increase in the concentration of surface Sn and In cations was noticed compared to the supports in the entire range of Sn and In contents as depicted in Fig. 1. It is suggested that part of Sn (or In) cations were migrated to interact with Pt atoms and formed bimetallic PtSn (or PtIn) catalysts [10,39]. Obviously, the growing tendency of Sn/(Sn + Al) atomic ratio was more pronounced than In/(In + Al) atomic ratio, similar to those before introducing Pt. Such results indicate that the migration of Sn species from bulk Mg(Al)O phase to the surface was favored upon the thermal treatment at high temperature resulting in a surface tin enrichment. Whilst the In species were primarily incorporated into Mg(Al)O structure and a small proportion of In species was homogeneously dispersed on the support surface.

The XPS spectra for Sn3d5/2 region of reduced catalysts are presented in Fig. 2. The Sn3d5/2 spectra were deconvoluted into two peaks corresponding to two different species. Typically, the component at lower binding energy (483.2–484.2 eV) was assigned to metallic tin (Sn°) whereas the other at higher binding energy (487.2–487.5 eV) was attributed to oxidized tin species (Sn2+, Sn4+) [50]. The percentages of each species given in parentheses are summarized in Table 4. It can be seen that the proportion of metallic tin decreased in the following order: Pt/MgAl(0.4Sn)O (10.7 %) > Pt/MgAl(0.8Sn)O (4.1 %) > Pt/MgAl(1.7Sn)O (2%). Such results indicate that the degree of reduction decreased when Sn loading increased and most of tin species stabilized in an oxidative state, which was probably due to high stability of SnO2 particles [51]. Fig. 3 shows the XPS spectra of the In3d5/2 region of the Pt/MgAl(In)O catalysts after reduction. From the deconvolution analysis, there were two peaks located at
444 eV and
445.5 eV, representing metallic In and oxidized In species respectively [52,53]. As can be observed in Table 5, the Pt/MgAl(1.6In)O catalyst possessed the lowest amount of metallic In (19.4 %) while the other catalysts exhibited the higher percentage of metallic In (27.2 % and 25.9 %). Similar results were reported by W. Tolek et al. [53] that an appropriate amount of In could stabilize the oxidized In species because of the strong In-support interaction, whereas an excess content of In caused the higher proportion of In° species being formed.

The metal particle size and their particle size distribution were observed from TEM micrographs of the catalysts as shown in Fig. 4. The average Pt particle sizes for fresh Pt/MgAl(Sn)O and Pt/MgAl(In)O catalysts were approximately 1.2 and 1 nm, respectively, indicating that small Pt clusters were highly distributed on both Sn and In-modified supports. The higher magnification TEM images as displayed in Fig. S3 provided further evidence of the observed small Pt particles.

In order to investigate the electronic properties of Pt, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra at the Pt L3-edge of all reduced catalysts and references (Pt foil and PtO2) are demonstrated in Fig. 5. Typically, the intensity of white line indicated an index of the d-band vacancies of Pt [54,55]. For the Pt/MgAl(Sn)O catalysts, the higher amount of Sn in the Sn-incorporated catalysts resulted in the lower white line intensity suggesting an increase in electron density at Pt atoms. A decrease in white line intensity was primarily attributed to the electron donation from Sn to Pt since Sn atoms were less electronegative than Pt atoms [56]. Taking into account the XPS results, it is verified that the high proportion of oxidized Sn species enhanced electron transfer to Pt atoms [57]. Likewise, a decrease in the white line intensity of the Pt/MgAl(In)O catalysts could be also ascribed to the electron transfer from In to Pt due to the difference in their electronegativity values [39,58]. As displayed in Fig. 5, the lowest intensity of white line was achieved for the Pt/MgAl(1.6In)O catalyst whereas the Pt/MgAl(0.2In)O and Pt/MgAl(2.4In)O catalysts possessed the higher white line intensity. It is also indicated that the electron density of Pt particles was associated with the proportion of oxidized In species [59]. Additionally, the predominant electron transfer effect of the In-modified catalysts compared to those of the Sn-modified catalysts was also observed. Since a small amount of surface In cations was homogeneously distributed on the catalyst surface as evidenced by the XPS results, it can be presumed that the intimate contact between Pt atoms and well-dispersed InOx species promoted the electron donation to Pt. While the electron transfer effect of Sn to Pt appeared to be limited due to high surface segregation of Sn, which may contribute to the aggregated tin oxides on the surface. The surface structures of Sn- and In-incorporated Mg(Al)O supports before and after introducing Pt catalysts were proposed in Scheme 1.

3.2. Catalytic performances
Fig. 6 displays the catalytic performances in propane dehydrogenation at 550 °C of the Pt/MgAl(Sn)O catalysts with different Sn contents. The catalytic activity decreased with increasing Sn content while the propylene selectivity increased. Such results indicate that the addition of Sn resulted in an improvement in propylene selectivity, but the excessive Sn loading (1.7Sn and 3.3Sn) caused a dramatically loss of catalyst activity. In addition, there was no significant change of catalyst deactivation trend with various Sn loadings, suggesting that the presence of Sn did not have much influence on the catalyst stability. Moreover, the catalytic performances of the Pt/MgAl(In)O catalysts with different In loadings are depicted in Fig. 7. The initial propane conversion of the Pt/MgAl(In)O catalysts decreased with increasing In content, which was similar to the trend of activity of the Pt/MgAl(Sn)O catalysts. Nonetheless, the conversion appeared to be stable during 5 h time on stream especially those with relatively high In loadings (1.6In to 2.9In). Furthermore, the propylene selectivity dominantly improved with the increase of In loading (above 97 % during the entire reaction process), which was superior to the propylene selectivity of all the Pt/MgAl(Sn)O catalysts. It is suggested that the effect of In addition on suppression of the undesired side reactions was more pronounced than that of Sn addition. Besides, a noticeable difference in the catalytic behaviors of the Pt/MgAl(Sn)O and Pt/MgAl(In)O catalysts could be observed in a way that introducing In on the Pt/MgAl(In)O catalysts greatly enhanced the catalyst stability. Such results infer that the incorporation of an appropriate amount of In could inhibit coke formation and/or sintering of Pt particles, which are the main causes of the catalyst deactivation during PDH [6].

Among the investigated catalysts, the Pt/MgAl(0.8Sn)O and Pt/MgAl(1.6In)O catalysts were selected as the appropriate Sn and In content owing to their superior catalytic dehydrogenation performances. Table S1 summarizes the propane conversion data and all the product selectivity of the Pt/MgAl(0.8Sn)O and Pt/MgAl(1.6In)O catalysts at initial and final time on stream. The initial propylene selectivity of the Pt/MgAl(0.8Sn)O catalyst was lower than that of the Pt/MgAl(1.6In)O catalyst obviously due to propane hydrogenolysis to methane and ethane. The propane dehydrogenation experiment of the catalyst in the absence of Pt was also carried out on the MgAl(1.6In)O support and the results are shown in Table S1. Without Pt, the catalyst support exhibited a negligible propane conversion (<1%) under the reaction conditions used. In order to verify the stability of the Sn and In-modified Pt catalysts during the reaction, Fig. S4 demonstrates the yield of propylene with time on stream for a longer reaction time in propane dehydrogenation over the Pt/MgAl(0.8Sn)O and Pt/MgAl(1.6In)O catalysts. Both catalysts exhibited similar propylene yield at the initial stage (about 26 %). However, the Pt/MgAl(1.6In)O catalyst showed higher stability upon 12 h time on stream than the Pt/MgAl(0.8Sn)O catalyst (the final propylene yields were 23.2 % and 18.8 %, respectively). Such results confirm that incorporating In on the Pt catalyst evidently improved the catalyst stability and propylene yield for propane dehydrogenation at 550 °C.
When considering the catalysts with low Sn and In loadings, both Pt/MgAl(0.4Sn)O and Pt/MgAl(0.2In)O catalysts exhibited high initial conversion of propane but low selectivity toward propylene. Owing to their relatively large fraction of metallic Sn and In, the weakening charge transfer to Pt atoms resulted in more electron-deficient Pt particles. A DFT study on the supported single Pt atoms reported by X. Sun et al. [60] suggested that a positively charged Pt atom had greater reactivity in C–H bond activation. Subsequently, the dehydrogenation and deep dehydrogenation tended to be simultaneously occurred, leading to the production of undesired side products and fast catalyst deactivation. After increased amount of Sn and In, the enhancement in dehydrogenation performance was observed for both Pt/MgAl(0.8Sn)O and Pt/MgAl(1.6In)O catalysts. The improved propylene selectivity was primarily due to the higher fraction of oxidized Sn and In species. Some of Sn (or In) cations were partially reduced and interacted with Pt atoms, which promoted the electron transfer to Pt particles. It consequently stimulated the repulsion between propylene
bond and Pt d electrons [61]. On the other hand, the excessive Sn and In contents both showed a declining trend of catalytic activity. Previous studies reported that the surface tin enrichment in bimetallic PtSn catalysts could physically block some Pt active sites [12]. Similarly, excessive content of In caused the large amount of metallic In, which also contributed to a blockage of Pt sites [26,31].
3.3. Characterization of spent catalysts
One of the major problems of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts is catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and/or the sintering of metal particles [6,14]. TEM images of the spent catalysts after the dehydrogenation reaction proceeded for 5 h were therefore observed in order to investigate the metal particle size as displayed in Fig. S5. The average Pt particle sizes for spent Pt/MgAl(0.8Sn)O and Pt/MgAl(1.6In)O catalysts were 1.13 and 0.94 nm, respectively, which were smaller than those of fresh catalysts. It is confirmed that both Sn- and In-modified Pt catalysts exhibited high sintering-resistance under high reaction temperature.
The amount and location of deposited carbon of the spent catalysts were determined by TPO experiments. As shown in Fig. 8, the TPO profiles of all the spent catalysts exhibited two successive peaks indicating two types of coke. The peak at lower temperature was assigned to coke deposited on the metal while the higher temperature peak was attributed to coke deposited on the support [62]. The Pt/MgAl(Sn)O catalysts showed coke deposition mostly covered on the support. It was because large proportion of Sn species stabilized in the oxidative state, which produced a drain-off effect by migrating the coke precursors from the Pt sites to the support [13]. Furthermore, the coke contents decreased with the rise of Sn loading, especially coke formed on the support. Based on coke formation mechanism proposed by Li et al. [63], the coke precursor is firstly generated through dehydrogenation reaction. Then, these olefins produce high-molecular-weight coke, namely aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon, through oligomerization, hydrogen transfer, and cyclization. Accordingly, it is worth mentioning that one of the important factors determining the deposition of coke is the olefin adsorption behavior, which is influenced by the electronic properties of Pt particles [18,42]. The higher electron density of Pt atoms facilitated the repulsion of propylene as well as coke precursor [5]. Thus, a declining trend of coke formation was observed with increasing Sn content. However, all Sn-modified Pt catalysts still showed quite high rates of deactivation. This result implied that the inhibition of coke deposited on both metal and support was essential to retard the catalyst deactivation.

Fig. 8. TPO profiles of the spent catalysts.
In the case of the Pt/MgAl(In)O catalysts, the amount of coke decreased sharply when In loading increased from 0.2In to 1.6In and then gradually decreased with further increasing of In loading. Besides, the combustion peaks shifted towards lower temperature after rising the amount of In. According to the results of Li et al. [63], they reported that coke deposited on the metal is mainly aliphatic coke (high H/C ratio) whereas coke deposited on the support contains higher aromatic coke (low H/C ratio). The shift of combustion peak when increasing In loading can be presumed that the graphitization degree of coke was lower and coke molecules had a higher H/C ratio like aliphatic nature of coke. As can be observed in Fig. 8, it is suggested that for the Pt/MgAl(0.2In)O catalyst, a comparatively large combustion peak at high temperature originated from the very low In content as well as high fraction of zero-valent In. Therefore, the weakening electron transfer to Pt atoms contributed to the adsorption of coke precursors more easily. Meanwhile, the Pt/MgAl(1.6In)O catalyst possessed the highest proportion of oxidized In species and the most electron-rich Pt particles, leading to a dramatic reduction in the amount of coke on both metal and support. Thus, a remarkable improvement in catalyst stability was attained. Additionally, a continuously declining trend of coke deposition was found with further increasing In contents, resulting from the blockages of Pt active sites, where the coke precursor was generated through dehydrogenation and deep dehydrogenation [14,63]. Accordingly, the Pt/MgAl(2.4In)O catalyst displayed the relatively low propane conversion as well as coke content.
Overall, the Pt/MgAl(In)O catalyst displayed a more selective and higher stability than those of Pt/MgAl(Sn)O catalyst. The superior catalytic performances on the former could be originated from a greater homogeneity of In cations on the support surface. The close intimacy of Pt atoms with homogeneously distributed InOx species resulted in a more promotional electronic effect on Pt particles. The higher electron density of Pt particles played a significant role in the suppression of coke formation. As a result, substantial enhancements of the dehydrogenation activity and catalyst stability were therefore obtained. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to mention that the lower acid strength of supported bimetallic catalysts was beneficial to the catalyst performance in PDH [30,53]. Accordingly, the comparatively weaker acidity of the Pt/MgAl(In)O catalyst also contributed to the improvement of propylene yield.
4. Conclusions
A series of Sn- and In-modified Mg(Al)O supported Pt catalysts was synthesized by sol-gel method with various Sn and In loadings. The catalytic performances of Pt/MgAl(Sn)O and Pt/MgAl(In)O catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation reaction were evaluated. The results demonstrated that incorporation of Sn and In into Pt/Mg(Al)O catalysts decreased initial propane conversion and increased propylene selectivity. Interestingly, the introduction of In distinctly enhanced the catalyst stability during the reaction, whereas the Sn addition did not have significant effect on deactivation behavior of the catalysts. Such results were associated with a small amount of homogeneously distributed In species on the support surface. The close intimacy between Pt atoms and well-dispersed InOx species resulted in a more promotional electronic effect on Pt particles. Conversely, the electron transfer effect of Sn to Pt appeared to be limited because Sn cations tended to segregate more on the support surface due to the difference in ionic valence between Sn dopant and the host cation (Al3+). The predominant electronic modification of Pt particles on the Pt/MgAl(In)O catalysts had an important role in the enhancement of the dehydrogenation activity and anti-coking ability, resulting in better tolerance against catalyst deactivation remarkably.
