On catalyst activation and reaction mechanisms in propane aromatization on Ga/HZSM5 catalysts
Abstract
Ga/HZSM5 catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of HZSM5 with gallium nitrate solutions and submitted to reductive and oxidative pre-treatments were studied by adsorbed pyridine FTIR, in situ DRIFTS and had their catalytic activity tested in propane aromatization reactions at 703 K with different initial hydrogen partial pressures. It is shown that dihydridogallium ions formed under hydrogen at aromatization temperatures, slowly decompose under inert gas flow and rapidly decompose when hydrogen is replaced by propane. During reduction under propane, no dihydridogallium species are observed, only alkylgallium species. Dehydrogenation reactions were inhibited and hydrogenolysis activities went through a maximum with increasing hydrogen partial pressure. The results showed that dihydridogallium ions cannot be the active sites for alkane activation and that, while taking part in hydrogenolysis reactions, hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites. A possible reaction scheme for catalyst activation and the first steps in the aromatization reaction is proposed.

1. Introduction
Aromatization of light alkanes (methane to butane) has been extensively studied, because of its economic and strategic importance in terms of the exploitation of natural gas resources and valorization of light hydrocarbons obtained in petroleum refining. Commercially, this process using mainly gallium-modified zeolite catalysts of MFI type is named “Cyclar”, and was developed jointly by UOP and British Petroleum (BP) [1]. Most of these studies date from the 90s (for a review see Ref. [4]), but recently interest in studying these catalysts was renewed [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], due to the worldwide growing importance of GTL technologies.
Although several papers in the literature suggest that the active gallium species under reductive conditions is a dihydridogallium cation, GaH2+, little experimental evidence really corroborate this hypothesis [4], [10], [22], [23], [24], [25] and only a few papers actually demonstrate that these species are formed under real aromatization conditions.
Rane et al. [5] and Hensen et al. [13], in their FTIR and XANES study of the grafting and reduction of trimethylgallium, observed that zeolite Brønsted acid sites are replaced by dimethylgallium species and the removal of the methyl ligands generates Ga+ and GaH2+ ions, the first process being favored at higher temperatures. Also kinetic data obtained by these authors suggest that propane was converted only on Ga+ sites, producing exclusively propene.
According to several papers [5], [13], [24], [30], [31] the oxidized gallium species observed in model catalysts, the gallyl ion (Ga = O+), is more active than the reduced gallium species formed during the reaction. However, gallyl ions have been found not to be regenerated in situ in the absence of an oxidizing agent like water [30], [32].
It can be seen that determining the role of gallium and reactant activation mechanisms has proven difficult, due to the multiplicity of gallium species that have been proposed to exist in these catalysts under reaction conditions and the lack of consensus on which is the active one.
This work is part of a project which aims to contribute to the solution of some standing questions involving alkane aromatization on Ga/HZSM5 catalysts. Previously [6], our group studied by EXAFS the nature of the gallium species obtained by impregnation of different amounts of gallium (2–10 wt.%) in a HZSM5 zeolite and their effects on 1-butene aromatization activity. It was observed that the increase in gallium content leads to the preferential formation of a segregated β-Ga2O3 phase at the external surface of the zeolite and favors the formation of agglomerated species inside the zeolites channels with low aromatization activity. The gallium species with better dispersion formed at lower gallium loadings showed higher activity.
In another work [19], we established quantitative correlations between the dispersion, acidity, reducibility and catalytic activity for propane aromatization of Ga/HZSM5 catalysts in the oxidized form, with varying composition (zeolite silica-to-alumina ratio and gallium content). It was determined that dispersed oxidic gallium species coexist in the catalysts with condensed species, and the proportion of the dispersed species decreases with the increase in Ga/Al ratio. Gallium incorporation, besides decreasing the density of Brønsted acid sites when compared to the pure zeolites, caused the appearance of strong Lewis acid sites related to the presence of dispersed gallium species. These species were more easily reduced than more condensed gallium ones. A correlation with good linearity was found between the initial propane aromatization activity at 703 K and the product of the concentrations of Lewis and Brønsted strong acid sites, which points to the need of both types of sites in the oxidized form of the catalyst for a good aromatization activity of the final catalyst.
Experiments using propane pulses [20] showed that the active sites in propane dehydrogenation activity are generated by the exposure of the catalyst in its oxidized form to propane itself. After a few pulses, a constant propane conversion and a 1:1 ratio between produced hydrogen and converted propane were achieved, with the simultaneous formation of propene and other hydrocarbons.
Also in situ XAFS experiments, under propane or hydrogen atmospheres in aromatization conditions, showed that reduced gallium in Ga/HZSM5 catalysts are isolated species coordinated to a single oxygen atoms [21]. Furthermore, the extrapolation of the observed correlation between the Ga coordination number and state of reduction suggested that, in the first stages of the reduction, condensed gallium species present in the oxidized catalysts are converted to dimeric oxidic species, which are then reduced to Ga+.
In the present work, we report on the study, by infrared spectroscopy, of the genesis, nature and stability of the species produced under propane or hydrogen flow, at alkane aromatization temperatures on Ga/HZSM5. We try to use these results, together with our previous catalyst characterization, to interpret product distributions in propane aromatization in mechanistic terms, especially the alkane activation steps. To this end, the study of the effect of hydrogen partial pressure on catalyst activity and selectivity was of considerable importance.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Catalysts containing 2, 3 and 4 wt.% gallium, supported on an HZSM5 zeolite with silica-to-alumina ratio (SAR) 35, were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with a gallium nitrate solution and calcined at 773 K for 4 h under a 200 mL/min flow of dry air. The gallium-modified zeolites were then subjected to two reduction/oxidation cycles: reduction was performed under a hydrogen flow of 200 mL/min at 783 K and oxidation under an air flow of 200 mL/min at the same temperature. Catalysts prepared in this way with 2, 3 and 4 wt.% of gallium were named, respectively, T2GaZ35, T3GaZ35 and T4GaZ35. For more details on catalyst preparation and the naming scheme see Ref. [19].
2.2. FTIR of adsorbed pyridine
The experiments were performed using self-supported wafers of sample T2GaZ35, with an area density of approximately 7.5 mg cm−2, in an infrared cell with CaF2 windows adapted for in situ treatments. The catalyst was analyzed as prepared, after reduction at 783 K for 4 h with 200 mL/min flow of pure hydrogen and after re-oxidation with air under the same conditions. The reduced sample was pre-treated at 673 K for 4 h under vacuum for obtaining the background spectrum. Pyridine was then adsorbed to a 267 Pa equilibrium pressure, at 323 K. FTIR spectra were recorded after consecutive evacuations at 323, 373, 423, 473, 573, and 673 K.
2.3. In situ DRIFTS
In situ DRIFTS experiments were made using a Praying Mantis type diffuse reflectance cell and a flow-through reaction chamber (both from Harrick Sci.). DRIFTS spectra were obtained during catalysts reduction with pure hydrogen, reaction with 2% C3H8/He and reduction followed by reaction. After each experiment the reduction/reaction gas was substituted by an inert gas in order to flush loosely bound species. Gas flows were at 50 mL/min and experiments were made at 703 and 783 K with post-flush at reaction temperature and also at 323 K. All gases were purified for contamination with oxygen and water.
2.4. Catalytic tests
The catalytic tests for propane conversion in the gas phase were conducted in a batch recirculating apparatus at 703 K and atmospheric pressure. The initial partial pressure of propane in the reaction loop was 2.0 kPa. A known amount of nitrogen was added to the reacting system as an internal standard, and the balance was helium. Experiments to probe the influence of hydrogen during reaction used partial pressures of 0 (reaction with pure propane), 2.0, 2.8, 4.9 and 6.0 kPa of this gas and the catalyst with 3 wt.% of gallium (T3GaZ35). The analysis of the reaction mixture was made by periodic sample withdrawal from the gas phase, which was injected in a methylsiloxane capillary column (100 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5 μm thickness) installed in an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a mass selective detector (quadrupole mass spectrometer), model 5973. Chromatographic area conversion into concentrations was made by means of response factors determined by calibration in our laboratory. The experiments were performed with approximately 65 mg mass of catalyst, with the exception of the catalytic tests with the pure zeolite sample (TZ35), where 200 mg were used due to its low activity.
3. Results
3.1. Adsorbed pyridine infrared spectroscopy
In order to verify the effects of reductive and oxidative treatments on the acidity of Ga/HZSM5 catalysts, these catalysts were characterized by adsorbed pyridine FTIR spectroscopy as prepared, after reduction in hydrogen flow at 783 K and after re-oxidation at this same temperature. Fig. 1 shows the results of this analysis for catalyst T2GaZ35.

Fig. 1a shows the infrared spectrum of the as-prepared sample after pyridine adsorption and evacuation at 423 K. The infrared bands used in this work to separately quantify the Lewis and Brønsted acid sites were the peaks at, approximately, 1450 and 1540 cm−1, corresponding to pyridine coordinated to a Lewis acid site and pyridine adsorbed under protonated form (pyridinium ion), respectively. The method and integrated molar extinction coefficients (IMEC) used for quantification can be found in Ref. [18].
Observing Fig. 1b–d, it is possible to infer that, during catalyst reduction, there is an increase in the concentration of Lewis acid sites, which occurs in parallel with a decrease in the concentration of Brønsted acid sites, with the total acid site concentration remaining essentially constant. This corroborates the hypothesis raised in the literature [2], [5] and in our previous work [21] that the reductive treatment favors gallium dispersion. An interesting fact here is that the reduced gallium species apparently act as Lewis acid sites. On the other hand, during catalyst re-oxidation the opposite occurs: a decrease in the concentration of Lewis acid sites and an increase in the concentration of Brønsted acid sites, showing that the gallium dispersion process is reversible. It is interesting to notice that this process was only partially reversed, as Lewis and acid sites concentration in the catalyst as prepared and after re-oxidation are not the same.
Fig. 1d shows that the generation of Lewis sites is in an essentially 1:1 basis with respect to Brønsted acid site consumption. In our previous work [21] we showed that gallium reduction may occur from a variety of binuclear gallium species with charges varying from 0 to 2+. The Lewis acidity of these species is supposed to increase with increasing charge. The observed increase in Lewis acidity with simultaneous decrease in Brønsted acidity upon reduction may be explained by some of the reactions proposed in that paper [21]. Thus, the reduction of a singly charged binuclear gallium species may involve the following overall reaction:
(1)
Z−Ga2O2(OH)+ + 2H2 + ZH → 2Z−Ga+ + 3H2O
In these reactions, Z− represents an ion-exchange site at the zeolite framework, i.e., two surface oxygen atoms connected to a single aluminum atom, and ZH is a Brønsted acid site. Reduction of neutral binuclear species, which is probably more difficult than reduction of charged species, may also lead to a 1:1 replacement of zeolite protons by isolated gallium ions:
(2)
Ga2O3·xH2O + 2H2 → Ga2O + (2 + x)H2O
(3)
Ga2O + 2ZH → 2Z−Ga+ + 2H2O
In reaction (3), xH2O implies that the gallium species is hydroxylated and x may lie between 0 and 2.
Finally, in the spectrum obtained after reduction of sample T2GaZ35 at 783 K and subsequent evacuation, two peaks associated with dihydridogallium cations (GaH2+) were observed: one with wavenumber 2042 cm−1, related to the stretching of GaH bonds [15], [16], [17], and another with wavenumber of 953 cm−1 which has not been previously reported in the literature and is probably due to the bending mode of the hydrogen atoms in GaH2+ group. This implies that, as already shown in the literature [5], [13], [15], [16], [17], hydrogen may dissociate on gallium sites to produce the hydride. These peaks disappear after the re-oxidation treatment.
In the literature, several papers indicate that the GaH2+ species could be the active one in Ga/HZSM5 catalysts under reductive conditions [4], [10], [22], [23], [24], [25]. In principle, the observation of these peaks in the infrared spectra of reduced catalysts would strengthen this hypothesis, as the dihydridogallium cation would be a stable species that resists evacuation. However, it is still necessary to verify that this same species is observed under propane atmosphere, indicating that it is also present during the aromatization reaction. Experiments trying to elucidate this possibility were made using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy which will be shown in the next section.
3.2. In situ DRIFTS
As seen in the previous section, the transmission FTIR spectra of reduced catalysts showed two absorption features with wavenumbers of 2042 and 953 cm−1 related, respectively, to the stretching of GaH bonds [15], [16], [17] and bending mode of the GaH2+ group. This fact was corroborated by DRIFTS results in all Ga/HZSM5 catalysts studied here, where two unresolved bands (2036 and 2052 cm−1) were observed and attributed again to the stretching of the GaH bond [15], [16], [17]. The peak at 953 cm−1 was not observed during DRIFTS experiments because it is overlapped by the structural bands of the zeolites, which dominate the spectra below 2000 cm−1. Fig. 2 shows these results for the catalyst T2GaZ35 during reduction at 703 and 783 K and catalysts T3GaZ35 and T4GaZ35 during reduction at 703 K, after subtraction of the spectra under argon flow in all cases. Therefore, in this figure, positive peaks represent the formation and negative peaks the consumption of species upon reduction.

Fig. 2 shows a decrease in the concentration of Brønsted acid sites (3594 cm−1) in parallel with the appearance of the dihydridogallium species. This confirms that during reduction the dispersion of gallium increases and that dispersed gallium species are located at the ion exchange sites of the zeolite. At the same time, OH groups related to extra-framework gallium species (3666 cm−1) [4], [35] are consumed. This is consistent with reactions (1), (2), (3) discussed above.
A band at 3736 cm−1 due to silanol groups appears upon reduction and comparison of Fig. 2(a) and (b) shows that its intensity increases with increasing reduction temperature. The growth of this band is most probably due to de-alumination of the zeolite framework, that we observed before using FTIR and solid state NMR techniques (27Al and 29Si) [19].
It has been pointed-out by one of the referees to this paper that the appearance of the silanol band, together with the decrease in intensity of the bridge-bonded OH band (Brønsted acid sites) at 3594 cm−1, could indicate that the gallium atoms are actually inserted in the zeolite framework and reduction results in the breakage of SiOH+Ga bonds. However, this interpretation is not consistent with our previous EXAFS characterization of the oxide form of the catalysts [19], where it was found that the main effect of gallium incorporation into the zeolite is the appearance of strong Lewis acid sites at the expenses of Brønsted acid sites. Furthermore, our simultaneous EXAFS and XANES study of Ga/HZSM5 reduction [21] showed that gallium is initially present in the oxide form of these catalysts as binuclear or larger oxidic gallium species, that are transformed into atomically dispersed reduced gallium species upon reduction with hydrogen or propane. This is of course not consistent with gallium being part of the zeolite framework in the oxide form of the catalysts.
It can also be observed from curves (a) and (b) in Fig. 2 that the increase in reduction temperature of catalyst T2GaZ35 does not lead to significant changes in the hydridogallium band, but leads to further decrease of the band related to the Brønsted acid sites and increase in the band attributed to silanol groups, which is also evidence of de-alumination, rather than consumption of gallium-associated Brønsted acid sites to produce hydridogallium species.
Fig. 3 shows the DRIFT spectra of T2GaZ35 catalyst after reduction in hydrogen at 703 K and subsequent purge with argon at this same temperature for different times. The results in Fig. 3 show that the formation of dihydridogallium species at high temperature is reversible by the replacement of hydrogen flow by argon. In this case peaks related to the stretching of GaH bonds (marked with the vertical line at 2044 cm−1) almost completely disappear after 90 min purge at 703 K. Results obtained at 783 K with catalyst T2GaZ35 and with other catalysts (T3GaZ35 and T4GaZ35) at 703 K are analogous to those and are included as supplementary information.

Fig. 3 also shows the OH stretching region of the spectra, where peaks assigned to terminal silanol groups (3736 cm−1), OH groups bonded to extra-framework gallium (3662 cm−1) and aluminum species (3640 cm−1), and to the zeolite Brønsted acid sites (3600 cm−1) are marked with vertical lines. As is clear from this figure, the intensity of the silanol peaks is constant during the purge with argon, suggesting that, after the initial de-alumination which occurs during the reduction process, there is no more aluminum loss by the framework and the de-alumination process, as would be expected, is irreversible. On the other hand, it is observed that, simultaneously with the decrease in the dihydridogallium band, there is an increase in the concentration of the Brønsted acid sites, along with an increase in the concentration of OH groups bound to extra-framework gallium species. This fact indicates that the increase in the dispersion of extra-framework gallium species observed during hydrogen reduction is at least partially reversible by the removal of its flow and therefore reactions (1), (2), (3) are reversible reactions. This also indicates that at least part of the water produced during reduction stays adsorbed in the zeolite, probably associated with extra-framework aluminum species. These species are formed during the reduction of the catalyst and might be contributing to the absorption maximum located near 3640 cm−1 observed with the reduced catalyst in Fig. 2, Fig. 3.
During argon purge at 323 K (after reduction at 703 K and cooling in hydrogen to room temperature), no significant changes were observed in the bands followed during the experiment, showing that hydridogallium species are stable at low temperatures. In experiments with unmodified HZSM5, no modifications were observed in the DRIFTS spectra during reduction.
No peaks due to dihydridogallium ions were observed under propane at aromatization conditions. Neither did the dihydridogallium bands appear after purging with argon, either at the reaction temperature (Fig. 4a) or at 323 K. This clearly shows that the gallium hydride species is not stable under propane aromatization conditions. From this observation, we can conclude that it is very improbable that the gallium hydride is the active species in the aromatization reaction.

In the DRIFTS experiments with propane under aromatization conditions, the irreversible formation of adsorbed alkyl species (Fig. 4a) was observed with Ga/HZSM5. These alkyl species were identified from four peaks with the following wavenumbers: 2877, 2900, 2928 and 2967 cm−1, determined by deconvolution of the experimental spectra with Gaussian peaks (R2 = 0.9967), as seen in Fig. 4b. These bands were attributed to the following vibration modes: νs,CH2 (2877 cm−1), νs,CH3 (2900 cm−1), νas,CH2 (2928 cm−1) and νas,CH3 (2967 cm−1), based on the work of Kubarkova et al. [26]. They are characteristic of ethyl groups bonded to gallium, but this same group of vibrations could also be attributed to methyl and ethyl groups simultaneously bonded to gallium, as methyl-gallium species have vibration frequencies at wavenumbers of approximately 2900 and 2965 cm−1, corresponding to the νs,CH3 and νas,CH3 vibration modes, respectively, which are very close to the ones observed here. Also, alkyl-gallium species with three or more carbon atoms in the alkyl chain were ruled-out in this work as these, according to the literature [26], should exhibit vibration frequencies with wavenumbers between 2715 and 2750 cm−1.
Under propane aromatization conditions, a decrease in the intensity of the bands corresponding to the Brønsted acid sites and to OH groups bonded to extra-framework gallium species was observed. As discussed before, this is associated to the increase in the dispersion of gallium oxide oligomers during reductive treatments and to de-alumination of the zeolite framework. From Fig. 4 it can also be noticed that, in contrast to what was observed during the experiments using hydrogen, during post-flush with argon, there was no increase in the intensity of the peaks related to extra-framework gallium species and to the Brønsted acid sites, suggesting that alkyl groups bonded to gallium stabilize it in its dispersed form. The same behavior was not observed during the propane aromatization reaction over the pure zeolite, where propane in the gas phase was completely removed from the system 30 min after the beginning of the purge with argon and no adsorbed species were retained by the catalyst.
In another experiment, catalyst reduction with hydrogen was immediately followed by the propane aromatization reaction. The results are shown in Fig. 5. It is observed that the dihydridogallium species formed during reduction disappeared between 5 and 15 min after the change of the reacting flow (from hydrogen to propane) as shown in Fig. 5. It should be noticed that in the spectrum obtained after 5 min propane flow (not shown here), hydrogen was not yet completely replaced by propane in the gas phase. This is in sharp contrast with the results of the argon purge after reduction in hydrogen, where the dihydridogallium species could still be clearly observed after purging for 75 min.

3.3. Catalytic reactions
In the propane aromatization reaction, carried-out in a batch re-circulating reactor system, saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons from C1 to C4 and aromatic hydrocarbons from C6 to C8 were obtained as products. Table 1 shows the initial activities for total propane conversion and conversion to alkanes, alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons, while Fig. 6 shows the amount in moles of propane converted to each of these three classes of compounds as a function of reaction time for catalysts TZ35 and T3GaZ35 (other catalysts were omitted for the sake of simplicity, as the results obtained were analogous to these). The initial rates of conversion of propane to olefinic, saturated, and aromatic hydrocarbons were obtained from the slope of the curves analogous to those of Fig. 6 at zero reaction time. Initial rates of propane conversion were obtained in a similar way, from curves of moles of propane versus time.

Fig. 6b shows that, for the Ga/HZSM5, there is a fast initial reaction (before 5 min) that leads to the formation of alkenes, mostly propylene and ethylene, evidenced by the fact that the conversion of propane to these products does not extrapolate to zero conversion at time zero. The initial reaction rates reported in Table 1 do not include this fast initial reaction, whose rate could not be quantified.
From the carbon and hydrogen balance obtained from the chromatographic analysis during the course of the reaction, it was possible to estimate the average H/C ratio in the reaction products, as a function of the degree of conversion, as shown in Fig. 7. This Figure shows that, before and after gallium modification, initially the average product H/C ratio is higher, rapidly decreasing until it reaches a steady state. The values obtained for initial and steady-state H/C ratios during the reaction were 2.8 and 2.2, respectively, for catalyst TZ35, and 1.9 and 1.5, respectively, for catalysts T2GaZ35, T3GaZ35 and T4GaZ35. No significant differences were noticed among the gallium modified catalysts.

In the case of Ga/HZSM5, ethylene is formed during the fast initial reaction along with the other olefins, and, afterwards, its concentration slowly decreases. It is interesting to notice that the production of ethylene does not produce methane as its counterpart, as would be expected if it had arisen from the propane cracking reaction.
It was also observed that, on Ga/HZSM5, propylene is mostly formed along with the other olefins in the fast initial reaction, its concentration reaches a maximum and then decreases steadily along with the propane concentration. In the unmodified zeolite, the propylene/propane ratio increased along the whole reaction. The propylene/propane ratio as a function of reaction time is shown in Fig. 9 for catalysts TZ35 and T3GaZ35.

The propene concentration at the first experimental point is 3.6 × 10−5 mol dm−3, while that of ethylene is ca. 1.2 × 10−5, i.e., the amount of ethylene formed in the initial fast reaction is a significant fraction of the amount of propene.
Fig. 10 shows the concentrations of C4 hydrocarbons as a function of reaction time. It can be seen that, in the case of the pure zeolite, the concentrations of C4 hydrocarbons increases steadily, while in the Ga/HZSM5 these concentrations go through a maximum, suffering a slow decrease afterwards. It is interesting to notice that the sum of the butenes concentrations is one order of magnitude smaller than the concentration of ethylene.

Fig. 11 shows the aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene and xylenes plus ethylbenzene) concentrations as function of reaction time for catalysts TZ35 and T3GaZ35. In both cases the main reaction products are benzene and toluene which are formed in almost equimolecular proportions. It can also be observed that the distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons is very similar in both cases. However, on the unmodified zeolite, the aromatic hydrocarbons are clearly secondary products, while on Ga/HZSM5 they appear as primary reaction products.

In order to have an insight into the role of hydrogen in the reaction, a series of experiments using a constant propane initial partial pressure (2.0 kPa) and varying the hydrogen partial pressure in the system (0, 2.0, 2.8, 4.9 and 6.0 kPa) was performed. All of the following tests were made using only the T3GaZ35 catalyst.
Fig. 12, Fig. 13 show how different groups of reactions are influenced by the ratio of hydrogen to propane partial pressures at the beginning of the reaction (from now on called just RH–P).

The effect of RH–P on the initial rate of formation of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene and xylenes + ethylbenzene) is shown in Fig. 13. In general, a decrease in aromatics formation can be observed with the increase in hydrogen partial pressure. This figure also shows that, with the increase in initial hydrogen partial pressure, benzene formation is favored over the production of the remaining aromatic hydrocarbons.
4. Discussion
4.1. Reaction network and influence of hydrogen partial pressure on product distributions
As shown in Table 1, the initial rate of propane conversion is, at least, 18 times higher on Ga/HZSM5 catalysts than on the unmodified zeolite, under the conditions used here. This result depends little on the gallium content of the catalysts (a better discussion of the effect of proton-gallium balance on activity is presented in Ref. [19]). Considering only aromatization activities, gallium impregnation leads to catalysts that are at least 180 times more active than HZSM5. These results contrast with those published in the literature on alkenes aromatization (a few examples can be seen in Ref. [4]), where reactant conversion is nearly independent of gallium modification of the catalysts, but selectivities to saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons change markedly.
Fig. 7 shows that product H/C ratios were significantly lower in the case of Ga/HZSM5 catalysts (1.5 in Ga/HZSM5 and 2.2 in the unmodified zeolite at steady-state). The fact that, with the pure zeolite, this ratio is close to 2.0 means that on this catalyst, after the dehydrogenation step that produces alkene molecules, the dehydrocyclization reactions that lead to aromatic hydrocarbons occur mainly by intermolecular hydride transfer, leading to overall reactions such as reaction (4) below:
(4)
5C3H6 → C6H6 + 3C3H8
In contrast, the significantly lower H/C value observed with Ga/HZSM5 shows that in this case dehydrogenation reactions leading to hydrogen evolution also contribute to alkene dehydrocyclization.
It should be noticed that the H/C values larger than 2.0 obtained with the pure zeolite mean that alkene generation itself involves, not only dehydrogenation, but also intermolecular hydride transfer reactions, as reaction (5) shown below, that explains ethane formation on the pure zeolite.
(5)
2C3H8 → C3H6 + C2H6 + CH4
Meitzner et al. [2] and Biscardi and Iglesia [3] suggest that, on Ga/HZSM5, alkane activation occurs on the zeolite acid sites and the role of gallium is to provide an outlet for hydrogen desorption. In the pure zeolite, hydrogen desorption would be the rate determining step (rds), which would cause a high hydrogen virtual pressure [2], [3], i.e., a much higher hydrogen surface concentration than expected from the hydrogen partial pressure in the gas phase. Accepting the proposal of hydrogen desorption as the rds on the pure zeolite (although not subscribing to the idea that in Ga/HZSM5 alkane activation occurs only on the zeolite acid sites), this elevated hydrogen virtual pressure could lead to hydrogenolysis reactions in such a way that reaction (5) would be more generally represented by scheme 1:
Scheme 1:
(6)
CnH2n+2 → CnH2n + 2Hads
(7)
CnH2n+2 + 2Hads → CmH2m+2 + C(n−m)H2(n−m)+2
(8)
2CnH2n+2 → CnH2n + CmH2m+2 + C(n−m)H2(n−m)+2
where reaction (8) in scheme 1 is the sum of reactions (6), (7) presented in the same scheme.
Observing the product distribution obtained with the pure zeolite, besides ethane formation, which can be explained by reaction (5) or scheme 1, formation of ethylene and methane in almost equimolecular quantities also occurs, suggesting the contribution of propane cracking reaction, reaction (9), at the zeolite acid sites [27], [28], [29].
(9)
C3H8 → C2H4 + CH4
On the other hand, on Ga/HZSM5, propane hydrogenolysis, reaction (10), seems to be the main route for methane and ethane formation, as suggested by the similarity of the concentrations these product with time. The hydrogen needed for the hydrogenolysis reactions is produced in the dehydrogenation reactions that lead to olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons formation.
(10)
C3H8 + H2 → C2H6 + CH4
Regarding propene formation on Ga/HZSM5, the main source of this product is surely the direct dehydrogenation of propane, reaction (11):
(11)
C3H8 ⇋ C3H6 + H2
It is worth noticing that most of the propene is produced in the first 5 min of reaction (cf. Fig. 9). Thereafter the propene-to-propane ratio is nearly constant, i.e., a quasi-steady state is achieved for propene production and consumption.
The production of ethylene with Ga/HZSM5 is interesting, inasmuch as it seems to be formed without a corresponding production of methane (cf. Fig. 10b), so that reaction (9) above is not the main one leading to its formation. Ethylene is most likely formed as a consequence of oligomerization of propene and subsequent cracking. The same type of mechanism must be responsible for the formation of C4 hydrocarbons.
It is interesting that all alkenes are produced at the beginning of the reaction (cf. Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10) on Ga/HZSM5. This means that the oligomerization and cracking reactions that are necessary for their formation and occur on the acid sites of the zeolite are fast under the present conditions.
For all alkenes and C4 hydrocarbons in general, the concentrations reach a quasi-steady state on Ga/HZSM5 catalysts, but, on the pure zeolite concentrations increase steadily. This certainly happens because, on the gallium modified catalysts, these hydrocarbons are largely consumed in the production of aromatic hydrocarbons. In the case of the pure zeolite, the formation of alkanes and alkenes is favored over aromatization, which leads to their accumulation, as there is no efficient route for their removal.
Despite the fact that the condensation of two C3 molecules followed by dehydrocyclization leads to the formation of benzene, it was observed that benzene and toluene are formed in almost equimolecular proportions (cf. Fig. 11). It can also be seen that the distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons is very similar on both catalysts. However, it cannot be inferred from this that the mechanism of their formation is the same, as we have already established from the H/C ratios in the products that dehydrocyclization on HZSM5 involves intermolecular hydride transfer reactions, whereas on Ga/HZSM5 it must involve hydrogen evolution. In the catalytic tests using the pure zeolite, the production of aromatic hydrocarbons displayed secondary product profiles (cf. Fig. 11a), revealing their multi-step formation with oligomerization of the olefins present in the reaction system, followed by hydride transfer and cyclization. In the case of the gallium modified catalysts, on the other hand, the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons has a primary product profile. This must be due to the fast initial formation of alkenes (cf. Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10), so that already at the initial instants of the reaction there is already a high concentration of the intermediates responsible for aromatic hydrocarbons formation in the system.
It is also interesting that poly-unsaturated and cyclic hydrocarbons, which would be expected as intermediates in dehydrocyclization, were never observed in any significant amount, either on HZSM5, or on Ga/HZSM5, although traces of these compounds were indeed detected. Therefore, the conversion of these intermediates is nearly as fast as their formation, on both types of catalysts, and possibly the distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons is determined more by thermodynamic than by mechanistic factors.
Fig. 14 shows maxima for the initial rate of formation of saturated hydrocarbons as a function of the hydrogen to propane ratio. Thus, while favoring hydrogenolysis over dehydrogenation reactions, it is clear that hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites. On the other hand, the initial rate of production of aromatic hydrocarbons decreases steadily with the hydrogen-to-propane ratio. This is probably due to the reversibility of the dehydrogenation steps involved in dehydrocyclization. Besides, it is also observed that the presence of hydrogen in the reaction system strongly favors the production of benzene over toluene and xylenes. A possible explanation is that formation of toluene and xylenes involves the condensation of more than two propylene molecules at some stage of the mechanism, so the decreased concentration of alkenes in the system in the presence of hydrogen would more strongly affect their formation than that of benzene.

4.2. Mechanistic inferences
As mentioned before, several studies in the literature show that, in the absence of oxidizing agents in the reaction system, the active gallium species present in the catalysts is in a reduced state [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Also, previous results from our group using propane pulses [20] showed an increase in propane conversion with the number of pulses injected at aromatization reaction temperatures. At the same time, hydrogen evolution started from near zero at the first pulse and increased steadily until a 1:1 ratio was obtained between converted propane and hydrogen produced, unequivocally establishing that gallium is reduced upon exposure to propane at aromatization temperatures and that the reduced form of the catalyst is more active than the oxidized form.
The reduction of gallium in the presence of propane, as well as under hydrogen, under aromatization temperatures was confirmed from our in situ XAFS [21] results, where it was also shown that the reduced gallium species is atomically dispersed. Reactions (1), (2), (3) discussed under Section 3.1 show how binuclear oxidic gallium species may be reduced under hydrogen to produce reduced isolated Ga+ ions, creating at the same time Lewis acid sites at the expenses of Brønsted acid sites. Apart from those, reduction of Ga2O22+ [21] and Ga = O+ (which may be present in catalyst with small gallium loadings [19]), that do not lead to a decrease in Brønsted acidity also have to be considered:
(12)
Z−Ga2O22+Z− + 2H2 → 2Z−Ga+ + 2H2O
(13)
Z−Ga = O+ + H2 → Z−Ga+ + H2O
The FTIR results (cf. Fig. 3) establish that dihydridogallium species exist under hydrogen flow after reduction with hydrogen at aromatization temperatures. Formation of this species is represented by reaction (14):
(14)
Z−Ga+ + H2 ⇋ Z−GaH2+
This reaction is reversible, as it was shown that the dihydrido species is decomposed by purging with argon, but the reversibility is slow even under aromatization temperatures. The FTIR results (cf. Fig. 3) show that the dispersion of gallium is partially reversed at aromatization temperatures once the hydrogen flow is replaced by inert gas.
Our previous XAS results [21] also established that exposure to propane under aromatization temperatures leads to gallium species indistinguishable by this technique from the one obtained under hydrogen. Therefore, propane may replace hydrogen as the reducing agent. For example, in the presence of propane instead of hydrogen, a reaction analogous to (12) would be:
(15)
Z−Ga2O22+−Z + 2 C3H8 → 2Z−Ga+ + 2 C3H6 + 2H2O
Analogous equations, with propane as the reducing agent and propene evolution, would apply to reactions (1), (2). This is consistent with the fact that, with Ga/HZSM5, the initial H/C ratio in the reaction products is very close to 2.0, since on first contact with the catalyst only alkenes are produced (cf. Fig. 12).
As to alkane activation on the reduced catalyst, the idea that a dihydridogallium ion could be the active species [2], [4], [10], [22], [23], [24], [25] is highly improbable, since this species was shown to disappear in the presence of propane (cf. Fig. 5). Neither do our results support the idea that the dihydridogallium species could intermediate hydrogen desorption [2], [12], [16], [17], as its decomposition under argon is slow. Furthermore, stable alkylgallium species, probably methylethylgallium ions, were observed to be formed under propane aromatization conditions. These observations are consistent with the following sequence of steps:
(16)
Z−Ga+ + C3H8 ⇋ Z−Ga+H(C3H7)
(17)
Z−Ga+H(C3H7)+ ⇋ Z−Ga+ + H2 + C3H6
(18)
Z−Ga+H(C3H7) ⇋ Z−Ga+(CH3)(C2H5)
Besides these reactions, a further one is necessary to explain the removal of hydride by reaction with propane:
(19)
Z−GaH2+ + C3H8 ⇋ Z−GaH(C3H7)+ + H2
A sequence of steps that corresponds essentially to reaction (19) has been analyzed by Frash and van Santen [24] in their theoretical study of ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites, with dihydridogallium ions as the active sites. In their scheme, the alkylhydridogallium species in reaction (19) decomposes to produce an alkene molecule and regenerate the dihydrido active site. Our results suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs by reactions (17), (18) instead.
Addition of hydrogen to the reaction medium suppresses the aromatization reaction, possibly by reversal of reactions such as (17) and other dehydrogenation steps involved in aromatization. On the other hand, it strongly promotes the formation of methane and ethane. However there is competition between hydrogen and the hydrocarbon for the active sites (cf. Fig. 12). A Langmuir–Hinshelwood type of mechanism, such as represented by reaction (20) is a likely possibility:
(20)
ZO−Ga+(CH3)(C2H5) + ZO−GaH2+ → 2ZO−Ga+ + C2H6 + CH4
It should be reminded that the isolated gallium species are formed from binuclear gallium oxidic species during reduction, so pairs of reduced species are likely to be in close proximity in the reduced form of the catalyst.
The reactions proposed in this article refer to the activation of the catalysts at the beginning of the reaction and to propane activation. In subsequent steps, the zeolite Brønsted acid sites are responsible for oligomerization, cyclization and hydride transfer reactions involved in the aromatization process, while reduced gallium species are responsible for dehydrogenation reactions [5], [13], [22], [23], [33], [34].
Finally, Fig. 14 shows a scheme summarizing the reactions proposed in this work for propane activation in Ga/HZSM5 catalysts.
5. Conclusion
The results in the present paper complement our previous ones on the genesis of the reduced gallium species in Ga/HZSM5 catalysts. The formation of isolated Ga(I) species from binuclear oxidic gallium clusters involves the production of Lewis from Brønsted acid sites in a 1:1 basis. This process is accompanied by some de-alumination of the zeolite framework to produce extraframework alumina, which also helps to explain the decrease in Brønsted acidity and increase in Lewis acidity. When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen is replaced by inert gas, but when the reducing agent is propane the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, that were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas.
Dihydridogallium ions were observed after reduction in hydrogen, but were slowly decomposed when hydrogen flow was replaced by inert gas. This slow decomposition of the dihydridogallium ions shows that it cannot intermediate hydrogen desorption during the aromatization reaction. However, when hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species appear to be rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected. These facts show that it cannot be the active site for alkane activation, as proposed by some investigators.
It was also shown that gas phase hydrogen added at the beginning of the reaction has a strong influence on catalysts activity and selectivity. Our results demonstrate that, while dehydrogenation reactions are inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities go through a maximum. This maximum shows that, while hydrogen takes part in hydrogenolysis reactions, it competes with propane for the active sites. This pattern of behavior confirms that dihydridogallium species cannot be the active species in this system.
