Graphical Abstract
Catalytic propane dehydrogenation reaction: Silicalite-1 with unique textural properties is favorable for the formation of high-density and ultrafine ZnO species. The optimized ZnOA/S-1 catalysts exhibit high performance for propane dehydrogenation.
Abstract
Propylene is deemed as a kind of key raw materials with significant value in industrial production. Highly dispersed Zn species are served as active sites in catalyzing propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH). More importantly, the morphology and textural properties of Si-based support exert the great influence on the formation of active Zn species. Herein, active Zn species were dispersed on macroporous commercial SiO2, mesoporous siliceous materials (SBA-15, MCF, DMSN, KIT-6), and microporous silicalite-1 (S-1), respectively. Characterization result indicated that the dispersed active ZnO species were prone to be formed on S-1, which could be attributed to the confinement effect of micropores in S-1 and the abundant Si-OH groups interacted with Zn2+ species. As a result, the optimal ZnOA/S-1 catalyst exhibited superior catalytic activity (propane conversion of 40.4 %, propylene selectivity of 96.0 %, 550 °C, WHSV=0.47 h−1) during PDH process. Furthermore, the relatively considerable performance of ZnOA/S-1 catalysts could help to offer a guidance on the design of efficient and low-cost catalysts for PDH reaction.
Introduction
At present, propylene are considered to be a kind of significant raw materials in industrial production.1 However, the traditional source of propylene include the fluid catalytic cracking of crude oil and steam cracking of refinery gas, accompanying with the enormous energy consumption.2 In recent years, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) have received extensive attention due to the increased availability of propane extracted from shale gas.3, 4 Although Pt- and Cr-based materials are widely used commercial catalysts for PDH, yet still suffering from the high cost of Pt and environmental detriment of Cr.5 Besides, the descriptor clearly revealed that the linear relationship accorded with the high activity and low catalytic selectivity for propane dehydrogenation.6 Thus, a great deal of non-noble metal catalysts have been extensively investigated for PDH, including Sn-, V-, Ga-, Fe-, Co-, and Zn-based catalysts with high performance and environmental friendly characteristic.2
To realize the relatively high selectivity with satisfactory activity, considerable efforts have been devoted to explore Zn-based catalysts due to the abundant Zn active sites. Biscardi et al. synthesized the Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalyst via ion-exchange method, in which Zn existed in the form of isolated Zn species (O−Zn2+−O).7 This study further revealed that Zn species were beneficial to promote the removal of H atoms and increase the formation rate of propylene. To elucidate the nature of active sites in Zn-modified ZSM-5, Almutairi et al. proved that the oxygenated Zn clusters ([ZnOZn]2+ or [ZnO2Zn]2+) were superior to ZnO aggregates (multinuclear or bulk ZnO clusters) and the isolated Zn2+ in PDH reaction.8 Recently, Yuan et al. proposed insights on the formation of ZnO species (single Zn2+ site, [Zn−OH]+ site, [Zn−O−Zn]2+ site, and ZnOx clusters) on H-ZSM-5 catalysts with different Si/Al and Zn/Al ratios.9 The results showed that the [Zn−OH]+ and [Zn−O−Zn]2+ sites were more superior than the single Zn2+ site in PDH reaction, especially for the stability of Zn−O−Zn. In addition, amorphous SiO2 supported with Zn single sites (tetrahedrally coordinated single Zn (II) sites) were also developed as efficient PDH catalyst, in which the heterolytic cleavage mechanism was favorable for increasing the selectivity for alkane dehydrogenation.10 Another study confirmed that the small nanoclusters of ZnO could act as active site to catalyze the PDH process.11 It's worth noting that the dealuminated BEA zeolites with abundant vacancies and silanol group were prone to achieve the highly dispersed ZnO species. Besides, ZnO nanoparticle supported on silicalite-1 (S-1) were also developed as an efficient catalyst for PDH due to the unique porous structure coupled with abundant silanol nests in S-1, which contributed to produce ZnO species with the smaller size.12 Except for silanol nests, the effect of OH nests on S-1 for in situ formation of ZnOx species was also investigated, revealing the defective OH sites were favorable for producing certain ZnOx active sites in PDH process.13 Very recently, [ZnH]+ site was found to be the active site and the Cu-modified [ZnH]+ favored to increase the active sites, further promoting the formation of propylene.14 Although great progress on Zn-based catalysts have been made, the loss of Zn species during PDH process is still a severe problem. It was confirmed that Mg-modified ZnOx supported on S-1 could suppress the loss of Zn due to the strong interaction between Mg2+ and ZnOx.15 More importantly, the active sites of heterogeneous catalysts are highly correlated to the textural properties of supports.16 Numerous efforts have been devoted to explore the active species on Si-based supports to improve the PDH performance.16, 17 However, the relationship between textural properties of Si-based supports and the existence form of active Zn species, have rarely been reported.
In this work, various Si-based supports, with diverse textural properties, typically macroporous, mesoporous, and microporous siliceous materials, were designed to disperse the active Zn species. Different pore structures and morphologies of Si-based supports were systematically investigated to determine the relationship between the textural properties of supports and the existence form of active Zn species. Furthermore, active Zn species were loaded on Si-based materials and the physicochemical properties and PDH performance were evaluated. The results showed that the suitable microporous characteristics and abundant OH groups of S-1 facilitated the formation of favorable ZnO species and single Zn2+ sites. As a result, the optimal ZnOA/S-1 catalyst demonstrated the considerable propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and regeneration ability.
Results and discussions
Catalyst characterization
To elucidate the influence of textural properties on dehydrogenation activity, a facile impregnation with pyrolysis process was applied to prepare a series of catalysts with different Si-based supports and Zn species. Specifically, Figure S1 displayed the schematic diagram of representative preparation of ZnOA/S-1.
The constitution and crystalline properties of selected samples were verified by XRD patterns (Figure S2). Except for the S-1, the other Si-based supports exhibited the typical diffraction peaks at around 22°, corresponding to the amorphous silica (Figure S2a). When loaded with Zn species, besides ZnOA/S-1 and ZnOA/KIT-6, the XRD patterns displayed three diffraction peaks of ZnO at 31.7, 34.5, and 36.2°, respectively (Figure S2b).18 However, the S-1 presented a clear mordenite framework inverted (MFI) framework with diffraction peaks at 7.9°, 8.9°, 23.2°, 24.0°, and 24.5°, respectively.19 Moreover, the peak at 24.5° belongs to the typical orthorhombic structure.19 In addition, XRD pattern of ZnOA/S-1 showed no obvious diffraction peaks of ZnO, indicating that active Zn species well distributed in the form of ultra-small ZnO particles.12 Based on the XRD results, it can be speculated that ZnO species on S-1 showed the better dispersion than those of other mesoporous or macroporous Si-based materials.
SEM was used to analyze the morphology of catalysts consisting of active ZnO loaded on different supports. In Figure 1(a–b), SiO2 agglomeration with rough and irregular morphology can be found on the ZnOA/SiO2. The ZnOA/S-1 catalyst in Figure 1(c–d) showed a coral-like morphology with well-distributed hexagonal structure. ZnOA/SBA-15 exhibited a plate-like morphology, in which partially assembled into particles, as shown in Figure 1(e–f). In addition, Figure S3 clearly showed the typical morphology of other contrast samples. Among these, ZnOA/DMSN showed the pearl-shaped nanoparticles with a dense distribution (Figure S3a–b). The bulks with tiny spherical nanoparticles can be observed on the ZnOA/MCF (Figure S3c–d). Besides, ZnOA/KIT-6 exhibited a flower-like structure surrounded with bits of nanoparticles (Figure S3e–f).

The preferred ZnOA/S-1 catalyst was further characterized by TEM, demonstrating the typical hexahedron MFI structure (Figure 2a and Figure S4a). Notably, ZnO nanoparticles can hardly be observed on S-1 (Figure S4b–c). Thus, we can conclude that the Zn species were uniformly dispersed throughout the whole zeolites. Moreover, EDS mapping was further conducted to confirm the dispersion of active sites, indicating that Si, O and Zn species were homogeneously distributed on the ZnOA/S-1 catalyst (Figure 2b). For comparison, TEM images of ZnOA/SiO2, ZnOA/SBA-15 and ZnOA/KIT-6 were also characterized (Figure 2c–h). Evidently, bulk ZnO nanoparticles appeared on the surface of SiO2, SBA-15, and KIT-6. Moreover, Zn species exhibited the partial aggregation on the corresponding supports.

N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions were shown in Figure 3. Specifically, the type I sorption isotherms with a quick adsorption at low relative pressure confirmed the microporous feature of ZnOA/S-1 (Figure 3a).14 Figure 3b showed the similar pore size distributions of ZnOA/S-1 and S-1 at the range of 1.8–3 nm. Commercial SiO2 and ZnOA/SiO2 exhibited the macroporous structure because of the characteristic of type III isotherms (Figure 3c).16 In addition, the corresponding pore size distribution (Figure 3d) clearly illustrated that the pores of SiO2 and ZnOA/SiO2 mainly centered at 170 nm. As shown in Figure 3e, the type IV isotherms with hysteresis loops (at relatively low pressure of 0.4–0.6) of SBA-15 and ZnOA/SBA-15 were attributed to the typical mesoporous materials.20 Figure 3f further verified the pore sizes centered at around 2.2 nm. It was worth mentioning that the BET surface areas, pore volumes and pore sizes of catalysts inevitably changed after loading with Zn species (Table S1). With regard to the S-1 and SBA-15, the specific surface areas, pore volumes and pore sizes dramatically decreased after loading with Zn, implying that Zn species mainly dispersed inside the pore channels of supports. However, the Zn species mainly located on the surface of macroporous SiO2 according to the slight change on pore volume and specific surface area. The agglomeration and loss of active Zn species generally occurred on the outside surface of supports, which can be attributed to the reduction of ZnO to metallic Zn during high-temperature catalytic reaction. However, the Zn species confined in pores could effectively restrain the agglomeration in a certain extent, greatly improving the catalytic performance. Thus, the Si-based supports with diverse textural properties significantly affect the dispersion of Zn species, which may lead to the remarkable discrepancy on catalytic activities in PDH reaction.

The stretching vibrations and structural characteristics of samples were further characterized by ATR-FTIR (Figure 4a). The peaks at 1224 and 1076 cm−1 were attributed to the Si−O stretching vibration and asymmetric stretching vibration of SiO4 tetrahedron, respectively.21 In addition, the characteristic bands at 800, 547, and 451 cm−1 were assigned to the symmetric stretching vibrations of tetrahedrons, vibrations correlated to the outside of tetrahedrons from MFI structure, and Si−O bending vibrations, respectively.21 Significantly, the special Si-OH stretching vibration peak at 964 cm−1 was attributed to the unique silanol nests in S-1, which was favorable for the dispersion of active Zn species.11, 16 Moreover, the characteristic peaks of catalysts showed almost no change (Figure 4b). The decreased intensity of silanol peak might be associated with the reaction between OH and Zn species. DR UV-Vis spectra were conducted to analyze the chemical environment of Zn species. The supports showed almost no adsorption bands except for the SiO2 (Figure 4c). The adsorption band at around 300 cm−1 in commercial SiO2 could be attributed to its own adsorption properties.22 Previous reports have verified that the adsorption band at 210, 240, and 370 cm−1 were generally attributed to the isolated Zn species in framework (O2− to Zn2+), subnanometric ZnO clusters (O−Zn−O species) inside of channel pores, and ZnO macrocrystallines (Zn−O−Zn species) on the external surface of zeolite, respectively.23, 24 As shown in Figure 4d, the adsorption band at ∼370 cm−1 in ZnOA/S-1 exhibited the lowest intensity, verifying the ZnO species located on the external surface of S-1 with relatively small size in comparison to the other catalysts.18 Similarly, compared with ZnOA/S-1, the other Si-based catalysts exhibited more intensive adsorption bands at 240 nm, indicating that the Zn aggregates located in the pores. Therefore, the samples with identical Zn loading on different Si-based supports demonstrated different adsorption intensities due to the different ZnO grains. Besides, the isolated Zn species were also observed in these samples with certain adsorption intensity, demonstrating the produced isolated Zn species in supports.7

XPS were performed to explore the electronic states of Zn components on the selected samples. The XPS spectrum of pure ZnO generally contained two diffraction peaks at 1021.3 and 1044.6 eV, respectively.11 As shown in Figure 5a, more positive shifts of Zn 2p peaks were attributed to the Zn species bonded to the framework of supports. Moreover, the peaks at 1022 and 1045 eV belong to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, further demonstrating the Zn existed as +2 valence over the selected catalysts.25 However, it is difficult to evaluate the chemical environment of Zn2+ from XPS spectra.18 Furthermore, the AES spectra were recorded to investigate the chemical states of Zn species. As displayed in Figure 5b, two typical peaks around 987 and 989 eV in the selected catalysts showed negative shifts in comparison with those of pure Zn (988.6 and 991.9 eV).18 AES results further verified that Zn2+ species dominated in the formation of framework O-bonded Zn species, and the Zn species endowed the higher electronegativity than the bulk ZnO.26, 27 Notably, active species with higher electronegativity contributed to facilitate the desorption of propylene during PDH reaction, resulting in a relative moderate side reaction.28

The acidity properties of catalysts were revealed by NH3-TPD in Figure 5c. Pure siliceous materials were generally inert for NH3.16 Meanwhile, the signal peaks can be ascribed to the NH3 desorption on Zn species. Typically, the NH3 desorption peaks centered at the temperature range of 100–270, 270–550, 550–800 °C, corresponding to the weak acid site, moderate acid site, and strong acid site, respectively.16, 18 For the ZnOA/S-1 catalysts, three peaks centered around 103, 420, and 600 °C can be assigned to weak, moderate, and strong acid site, respectively. The ZnOA/SBA-15 also possessed the similar acidity distribution. NH3-TPD results were significantly associated with the catalytic activity. The concentration of acidity followed the order of ZnOA/SBA-15>ZnOA/SiO2>ZnOA/S-1 (Figure 5d), corresponding to the amount of Lewis acid. The lower content of Lewis acid in ZnOA/S-1 could relieve the side reaction and coke deposition.18, 29 In brief, catalysts with ZnO species endowed different acid amounts and acid sites, leading to the variable performance during PDH reaction process.
Catalyst reactivity characterization
To evaluate the catalytic reactivity, propane dehydrogenation reactions were conducted on the selected catalysts. The ZnOA/S-1 catalyst exhibited the predominant catalytic performance compared with other Si-based catalysts. Specifically, ZnOA/S-1 showed the outstanding initial propane conversion (40.41 %) along with a considerable propylene selectivity (96.02 %) (Figure 6a). Moreover, the conversion slowly decreased to 37.07 % after 6 h on stream tests. The other samples exhibited the extremely low propane conversions (below 5 %). The selectivity of catalysts followed the order of ZnOA/S-1>ZnOA/KIT-6>ZnOA/MCF>ZnOA/DMSN>ZnOA/SiO2>ZnOA/SBA-15, which was greatly related to the textural properties of selected supports and the dispersed active ZnO species. The space time yield (STY) value is also considered as a vital indicator to evaluate the performance of PDH.2 Thus, the STY values of catalysts followed the order of ZnOA/S-1>ZnOA/SiO2>ZnOA/SBA-15>ZnOA/MCF>ZnOA/KIT-6>ZnOA/DMSN (Figure 6b). Besides, the initial activity of catalysts further confirmed the superior performance of ZnOA/S-1 (Figure 6c). The outstanding activity of ZnOA/S-1 catalyst might be attributed to the unique morphology, textural properties along with well-dispersed ultrafine ZnO species. Moreover, to assess the intrinsic activity in PDH reaction, the corresponding specific surface activity is defined as the utilization efficiency of Zn species (UZn). The UZn values summarized in Table S2 confirmed that the ZnOA/S-1 was superior to ZnOA/SiO2 and ZnOA/SBA-15.

Furthermore, the ZnOA/S-1 catalysts with various theoretical Zn loading were tested to investigate the PDH reactivity. A typical volcano trend on activity could be observed in Figure S5, indicating the optimal theoretical Zn loading (4.8 %) possessed the excellent performance. We speculated that catalyst with a higher Zn loading possibly caused the severe Zn agglomeration,12 leading to a decreased performance. However, the reactivity of catalyst with low contents of active species was insufficient to catalyze the PDH process. In addition, the different Zn precursors (ZnCl2 and Zn(NO3)2⋅6H2O) were chosen for preparing the catalysts with the same theoretical Zn content. The activity of ZnOA/S-1, including conversion, selectivity, and STY, were much better than those of ZnON/S-1 and ZnOC/S-1 (Figure S6). The outstanding activity of ZnOA/S-1 may be caused by the moderate content of Zn active species, which was verified by the ICP-OES measurement (Table S2). Similarly, XRD patterns showed no diffraction peaks of ZnO species, further demonstrating the well-dispersed ZnO species in S-1 (Figure S7a–b). Moreover, DR UV-Vis spectra also showed that ZnOA/S-1 catalyst occurred a blue shift of band adsorption around 370 nm when compared with other catalysts (Figure S7c–d). The larger band gap of ZnOA/S-1 indicated the unique crystalline properties of ZnO species.
The optimal ZnOA/S-1 catalyst was further evaluated under different reaction condition. The propane conversion decreased from 49.70 % to 3.49 % with the weight hour space velocity (WHSV) of propane ranging from 0.24 to 2.36 h−1 (Figure 6d). Meanwhile, the higher WHSV leaded to the relatively low selectivity of C3H6, which was caused by the transient contact between catalyst bed and reaction gas. Furthermore, the optimized WHSV of 0.47 h−1 was obtained according to the high STY value (Figure 6e). The PDH performance over ZnOA/S-1 with different WHSV was summarized in Figure 6f, further verifying the optimum WHSV value.
It is well known that diffusion behavior greatly influence the catalytic performance in heterogeneous catalysis.30 Thus, the interphase and intra-phase diffusion characteristics were assessed on the optimized ZnOA/S-1. Specifically, propane conversion as a function of the inlet flow rate of propane was shown in Figure 7a, revealing that the propane conversion gradually became stable with the increased flow rate. The similar experimental conditions (550 °C, 40 ml min−1, 40 vol.% C3H8/N2) and conclusions can be found in previous report,31 verifying no diffusion constraints by using force-field molecular simulations. Therefore, the same flow rate of 40 mL min−1 was used in our study. Besides, the diffusion limitation can be excluded according to the interphase diffusion behavior of PDH reaction over ZnOA/S-1. The intra-particle diffusion behavior showed that the larger particle size leaded to an inferior propane conversion (Figure 7b). The diffusion limitation could be eliminated with the decreased particle size. Arrhenius curves were obtained by plotting the propylene formation rate as a function of particle size.13, 32 The apparent activation enthalpy of ZnOA/S-1 was determined to be 150.1 KJ/mol, which was an intermediate value for the Zn-based catalysts (Figure 7c).13, 14 Additionally, ZnOA/S-1 catalyst showed satisfactory activity when compared with the previously reported Zn-based catalysts (Table S3).10-14, 26, 33, 34 The reaction temperature plays a significant role in catalyzing PDH reaction due to the intrinsic properties of endothermic behavior during reaction process. Therefore, the reaction temperature was explored over the selected ZnOA/S-1. The conversion increased with the reaction temperatures (Figure 7d). However, ZnOA/S-1 showed a low selectivity of propylene at high temperature due to the intensive side reactions. In addition, the STY values over ZnOA/S-1 were calculated during 6 h tests, and the higher values were attributed to the high conversion (Figure 7e). Furthermore, the low temperature reaction corresponded to the low initial propane conversion, exhibiting lower deactivation behavior (Figure 7f). Taken into consideration of energy consumption and deactivation behavior, a suitable reaction temperature of 550 °C should be applied in PDH process.

To explore the deactivation behavior of ZnOA/S-1 catalyst for PDH, the catalytic recycling tests were performed at 610 °C. As shown in Figure 8a, the reactivity of ZnOA/S-1 catalyst could be partially recovered after regeneration in air condition. However, a slight decay on activity still can be observed because of the loss of active component.15 The propane conversion decreased with the increased cycles and the corresponding propylene selectivity also increased with the regeneration numbers (Figure 8b). Raman spectroscopy was applied to analyze the formed carbon in ZnOA/S-1 after three times of cycles. Two obvious bands can be observed at around 1348 and 1591 cm−1 (Figure 8c), which were attributed to the defective structure (D band) and graphitic carbon (G band), respectively.25 Moreover, the ZnOA/S-1 catalysts after regeneration showed almost no obvious change according to the results of SEM and the XRD (Figure 8d and Figure S8). The corresponding elemental mapping further revealed that C elements well dispersed throughout the whole catalyst. TG analysis was conducted to investigate the combustion of coke in air (Figure 8e). The mass loss of 0.76 % at around 50 °C was ascribed to the physical adsorbed water. The mass loss at 628 °C can be attributed to the formation of coke after regeneration and the amount of coke was calculated to be ∼2.4 %. The slight loss of weight indicated the excellent coking resistance. Moreover, the industrial evaluation was performed to further analyze the performance of ZnOA/S-1 (Figure S9). Initially, ZnOA/S-1 exhibited a comparable performance (propane conversion of 36.8 %, propylene selectivity of 90.8 %, STY of 1.51 g gcat−1 h−1). The propane conversion gradually decreased as the reaction process, which can be attributed to the coke deposition and active Zn species agglomeration during high temperature reaction. In the future, more efforts should be devoted to improve the stability of catalyst under industrial condition by means of strong metal support interaction, structural optimization, and electronic modification.

According to the above results, the catalytic performance of ZnOA/S-1 with highly dispersed ZnO and single Zn2+ site can be summarized as the following factors. (1) The textural properties of S-1 support greatly influence the formation of ZnO species. S-1 with special hexahedron morphology, microporous characteristics, high crystallinity, and abundant silanol nests synergistically promote the formation of highly dispersed ZnO species. (2) The isolated Zn2+ and small-sized ZnO served as active sites, significantly contributing to the efficient dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.12
Conclusions
In this work, the textural properties of different Si-based materials were systematically investigated. Moreover, the active Zn species loaded on these Si-based supports were evaluated and discussed. Characterization result indicated that active Zn species were more favorable to form on the S-1 with microporous structure and silanol groups. The suitable microporous characteristics and abundant OH groups of S-1 facilitated the formation of highly dispersed active Zn species, endowing the considerable propane conversion and propylene selectivity of ZnOA/S-1. Besides, a large STY of 0.17 g gcat−1 h−1 (550 °C, WHSV=0.47 h−1) and a relatively small deactivation constant of 0.023 h−1 (550 °C, WHSV=0.47 h−1) were also realized. Furthermore, the diffusion limitation was eliminated by applying an appropriate feed flow rate and refining the particle size. The siliceous materials with peculiar textural properties significantly affect the formation of active ZnO species (highly dispersed ZnO and single Zn2+ site), which will further guide the rational design of efficient PDH catalysts.

Catalyst preparation
ZnOA/S-1 catalyst
0.6 g of S-1 was dispersed in 25 mL ultrapure water and stirred for 30 min. Subsequently, a certain amount of Zn(CH3COO)2⋅2H2O was added in the above solution and stirred for another 1 h at room temperature. After that, the solution was evaporated at 80 °C to obtain the powder. Finally, the powder was calcined at 550 °C for 2 h to obtain the xZnOA/S-1, in which x represents the theoretical amount of Zn elements of 3.6, 4.8 and 6.0 wt.%, respectively. Markedly, 4.8 was considered as the optimal Zn content, thus 4.8ZnOA/S-1 catalyst was abbreviated as ZnOA/S-1 for further investigation.
In addition, different Zn salts were also investigated as precursors. The catalysts prepared by using Zn(NO3)2⋅6H2O and ZnCl2 were denoted as ZnON/S-1 and ZnOC/S-1, respectively.

The other Si-based catalysts with Zn species were prepared by the same approach as ZnOA/S-1 by changing the supports.
Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) were conducted on Empyrean X-ray diffractometer utilizing Cu Kαray for 2θ values of 5-85° at a scanning rate of 2°/min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by a FEI Inspect F50 instruments. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) observation and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping were performed on a Talos F200S G2 to observe the morphology of catalysts. N2 adsorption-desorption curves were evaluated by Quantachrome instrument at −196 °C. The specific surface area of catalysts was calculated by using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model were employed to calculated the pore size distribution. The attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) was performed on NEXUS 670 with an ATR accessory coupled with an infrared spectrometer. Diffuse reflectance UV-Visible (DR UV-Vis) was conducted on Shimadzu UV-3600 plus spectrophotometer and BaSO4 was utilized as a reference material. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained on a ThermoFisher (Thermo Scientific) with mono Al Kα radiation. Ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was evaluated by Auto Chem II 2920 analyzer equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. To begin with, 100 mg of sample was activated at 600 °C with 30 mL ⋅ min−1 of He. Then, the temperature was cooled to 50 °C with 10 mL ⋅ min−1 of He. The mixed gas of NH3/He (10/90) was blown into a reactor for saturated adsorption. Subsequently, the He gas with 30 mL ⋅ min−1 was introduced to eliminated the surface physical adsorption of NH3. In the end, TPD plots were obtained from 50 to 800 °C. Raman spectra were acquired on Thermofisher (Dxr2xi) equipped with an InGaN laser at the excitation wavelength of 532 nm at 20 °C. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was conducted on a TG 209F1 (NETZSCH Germany) at air atmosphere with 10 °C min−1. Inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was performed to analyze the contents of Zn.
Catalytic performance evaluation
Catalytic reaction was performed at atmospheric pressure in a stainless-steel reactor with 60 cm of length and 12 mm of inner diameter. 0.5 g of catalyst powder was utilized for catalytic estimation, which was diluted with 0.3 g of quartz wool to overcome temperature and concentration gradients. The reaction feeding gas was composed by 5 vol.% of C3H8 in the inert balance gas with the total flow rate of 40 mL min−1. The temperature of reactor in the oven was monitored by using the thermocouple. The tail gas was analyzed by on-line gas chromatography (SHIMADZU GC-2014). Products were analyzed by flame ionization detector (FID) detectors with MC-3 column (HP-AL/S) for quantitative and qualitative measurements. The detailed descriptions for weight hour space velocity (WHSV) of C3H8, C3H8 conversion, C3H6 selectivity, formation rate of C3H6 (r(C3H6)), space time yield (STY) of C3H6, and deactivation rate constant were given in supporting information.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
