The given document discusses the kinetics of propane oxidation and reforming over Rh/Al2O3 catalysts, but does not specifically pertain to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) for converting propane to propylene. The catalyst composition, performance metrics, and process conditions are not optimized for propylene production via PDH or ODH.
