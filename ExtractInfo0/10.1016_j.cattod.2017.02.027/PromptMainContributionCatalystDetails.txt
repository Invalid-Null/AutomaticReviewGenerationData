1. Introduction
Light olefins are important feedstocks for polymer and petrochemical industries [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The global propylene market is anticipated to exhibit considerable growth in coming years and it is estimated about 165 million tons by 2030 [7]. Conventionally, propylene has been produced by steam cracking (SC), methanol to olefin production (MTO) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of light oil fractions. From recent comprehensive reviews on light alkane dehydrogenation to light olefin using Pt, Cr, V and Mo metals [8], [9], [10], [11], it can be deduced that the Pt-based alloy catalysts showed high activity and stability as compared with other metal or metal oxide catalysts. Accordingly, Pt-based catalysts were widely studied for propane dehydrogenation. Recently, structured supports such as zeolites and mesoporous silicas as well as modified alumina supports have been newly attempted to improve the catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Alumina supported PtSn catalysts are regarded as best candidates for propane dehydrogenation due to their high selectivity to light olefin. The high thermal stability as well as the low acidity of the alumina supported PtSn catalysts led to the high metal dispersion and the low coke formation, resulting in high activity and stability [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. PtSn alloy formation on the alumina can also prevent the coke formation on active Pt sites, which are explained by geometric and electronic effects [26], [27], [28]. Accordingly, Characterizations of PtSn catalysts have been intensively performed to correlate the catalytic activity with the PtSn alloy formation [25], [29], [30], [31]. The quantity of PtSn metal loadings and the atomic ratios of Sn to Pt were optimized to show the highest propylene yield in propane dehydrogenation [32], [33], [34]. The amount of alkali metal doping on the PtSn catalysts was also optimized to increase the selectivity to light olefins [12], [20].
On the other hand, it was found that Pt particles were scattered on the dispersed Sn on the calcined PtSn samples [21]. Therefore, it was expected that the impregnation steps before the calcination would be a controlling step to disperse Pt metals on the support. According with the reasoning, it was reported that the activity of the PtSn catalysts was dependent on solvent used in the co-impregnation to prepare the PtSn catalysts. The kinetic data showed that the catalytic activity of the PtSn catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation and isomerization decreased in the order of ethanol > acetone > water [35]. Similarly to that, the kinetic data with the PtSn catalysts in propane dehydrogenation also showed that the catalytic activity decreased in the order of ethanol > water > acetone [36]. Here, we observed that the addition of the mixed acid of HCl and HNO3 in dissolving Pt precursor enhanced Pt metal dispersions of the PtSn catalysts three times higher than the catalysts prepared using ethanol. TEM analysis revealed that the aggregates of the metal sub-nanoparticles were observed on the PtSn catalysts using the mixed acid solution to dissolve the Pt and Sn precursors. The metal sub-nanoparticles on the catalysts showed the high selectivity as well as the high activity. And also the surface acidity (acidic sites) of the catalysts was investigated by temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) method.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of the catalyst
2.1.1. Preparation of (PtSn)A and (PtSn)E catalysts
The sphere-shaped θ-Al2O3 support (∼3 mm) was prepared by calcining the spherical γ-Al2O3 (CONDEA chemie GmbH) at 1273 K for 6 h. Hydrogen hexachloroplatinic acid (IV) hydrate (Kojima chemicals, Co. Ltd., purity: 99%) and tin chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, purity: 98%) were used as Pt and Sn precursors, respectively. Two different solvents were used to dissolve the Pt and Sn precursors: 1) aqueous acid solution of HCl and HNO3 and 2) ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, absolute). Aqueous 35 wt% HCl and 60 wt% HNO3 solutions were used as reagents of HCl (Junsei chemicals Co. Ltd.) and HNO3 (Junsei chemicals Co. Ltd.). Where, the aqueous acid solutions with two different acid concentrations were used to dissolve the Pt and Sn precursor, respectively. Acid solution A was used to dissolve the Pt precursor, which was prepared by mixing 0.5 wt% HCl to θ-Al2O3, 0.25 wt% HNO3 to θ-Al2O3 and distilled water of 74 vol% to θ-Al2O3. Acid solution B was used to dissolve the Sn precursor or both the Pt and Sn precursors, which was prepared by mixing 4.0 wt% HCl to θ-Al2O3, 1.0 wt% HNO3 to θ-Al2O3 and distilled water of 74 vol% to θ-Al2O3. On the other hand, ethanol was used to dissolve the Pt and Sn precursors.
Two (PtSn)A and (PtSn)E catalysts with the metallic composition of 1.0 wt% Pt and 0.5 wt% Sn on θ-Al2O3 support were prepared by the co-impregnation using acid solution B and ethanol, respectively. After mixing the θ-Al2O3 with the solvent dissolving the Pt and Sn precursors and removing the solvent in a rotary evaporator. Samples were dried in an oven at 378 K for 16 h and then the dried samples were calcined at 873 K for 3 h in air.
2.1.2. Preparation of (Pt-Sn)A and (Pt-Sn)E catalysts
Two (Pt-Sn)A and (Pt-Sn)E catalysts with the metallic composition of 1.0 wt% Pt and 0.5 wt% Sn on θ- Al2O3 support were prepared by the sequential impregnation of the Pt and Sn components. After mixing the θ-Al2O3 with the acid solution A or ethanol dissolving the Pt precursor and removing solvent in a rotary evaporator, the samples were dried in an oven at 378 K for 16 h and then the dried Pt/θ-Al2O3 samples were calcined at 873 K for 3 h in air. In next step, the dried PtSn/θ-Al2O3 samples were prepared by the same method described above using the acid solution B or ethanol dissolving the Sn precursor, which were calcined at 853 K for 3 h in air, again.
2.1.3. Preparation of (Sn-Pt)A and (Sn-Pt)E catalysts
Two (Pt-Sn)A and (Pt-Sn)E catalysts with the metallic composition of 1.0 wt% Pt and 0.5 wt% Sn on θ-Al2O3 support were prepared by the sequential impregnation of the Sn and Pt components. After mixing the θ-Al2O3 with the acid solution B or ethanol dissolving the Sn precursor and removing the solvent in a rotary evaporator, the samples were dried in an oven at 378 K for 16 h and then the dried Sn/θ-Al2O3 samples were calcined at 873 K for 3 h in air. In next step, the dried PtSn/θ-Al2O3 samples were prepared by the same method described above using the acid solution A or ethanol dissolving the Pt precursor, which were calcined at 853 K for 3 h in air, again.
For convenience, PtSnE catalysts represent for the PtSn catalysts prepared using ethanol and PtSnA catalysts represents for the PtSn catalysts prepared using acid solutions.
2.2. Characterization of catalysts
2.2.1. X-ray diffraction analysis
The XRD patterns of the prepared catalysts were recorded on a diffractometer (M/S, Shimadzu Instruments, Japan) with Ni-filtered Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) as a radiation source. The operating voltage and current were 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. A scanning rate of 2 θ was 2° min−1.
2.2.2. BET surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution
The BET surface areas and N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were performed at 77 K using an automated gas sorption system (Belsorp II mini, BEL Japan, Inc.,). The Barrett-Joyner-Halanda (BJH) method was used for the pore size distribution.
2.2.3. Temperature programmed reduction analysis
The temperature programmed reductions (TPRs) were carried out using a temperature program analyzer (BELCAT, BEL Japan, Inc.). For a typical TPR analysis, 0.1 g of a calcined sample was placed between quartz wool in a U-type quartz reactor. The sample was thermally treated under an Ar stream (30 mL min−1) at 673 K for 2 h to remove physically adsorbed water and other impurities. The catalyst was cooled down to the room temperature under the Ar stream and then the catalyst was heated at 10 K min−1 from the room temperature up to1073 K in a gas mixture of 5% H2/Ar (30 mL min−1).
2.2.4. CO chemisorption
The CO chemisorptions were performed with a pulse chemisorption mode (BELCAT, BEL Japan, Inc.). Prior to measurements, 0.050 g of a sample was thermally treated under a He stream at 773 K for 50 min to remove physically adsorbed water and other impurities. The sample was cooled down to room temperature and heated to 823 K with a heating rate of 10 K min−1 using pure H2 at a flow rate of 50 mL min−1. The sample was then reduced in a pure H2 flow at 823 K for 2 h. After the reduction at 823 K, the sample was purged with a He gas at the same temperature for 1 h. After cooling to 323 K, a gas mixture of 10% CO/He was introduced for the CO chemisorption. A CO gas loop was used for each pulse and the pulse injections were repeated until saturation. The amount of CO was measured using a thermal conductivity detector. The metal dispersion of each catalyst was then calculated from the amount of CO adsorbed, taking the stoichiometry factor (SF: Pt/CO) as one. The metal dispersion could be calculated as follows;
Where VS is the cumulative volume of adsorbed CO (cm3 at STP), MW is the molecular weight of Pt metal (g mol−1), SW is the weight of the sample, and Fn is the Pt fraction in relation to the total catalyst sample weight.
2.2.5. Temperature programmed desorption
The temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was performed to determine the number of acidic sites on the surface of the catalysts. The sample was pre-treated at 773 K for 1 h under a stream of helium (30 mL min−1) in order to remove the moisture, physically adsorbed water and other impurities present in the sample. After the pretreatment, the ammonia (5% NH3/He, flow: 30 mL min−1) was introduced at 373 K for 1 h, and then the weekly adsorbed ammonia was removed at 373 K for 1 h. During the desorption step, the temperature was ramped from 323 to 1073 K with a heating rate of 10 K min−1 under a stream of helium (30 mL min−1).
2.2.6. Transmission electron microscopy
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission microscopy (STEM) images of the Pt and Sn particles were characterized by using a Technai (F20 G2, FEI corporate) and a TITAN (G2 Cube 80–300 kV, FEI corporate) microscopy working in a STEM mode. Titan obtains a better lateral resolution than 1 Å and energy resolution down to 0.1 eV. The catalyst samples were dispersed in ethanol solution using a ultra-sonic bath for 30 min. The resulting solution was deposited on copper grids coated with a carbon film, and alcohol was evaporated. Finally, the sample of the copper grid was used for the TEM and STEM analysis.
2.2.7. AAS and ICP elemental analysis
The metal Pt and Sn compositions on the prepared catalysts were determined by an atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) and an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES).
2.3. Activity measurement
The prepared catalysts were crushed and the particles sizes of 180–435 μm were sieved and used for the reaction. Propane dehydrogenation was conducted in a quartz reactor with PtSn catalysts loaded at 873 K at an atmospheric pressure. The calcined catalysts were pre-reduced in a pure hydrogen gas (99.99%) at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 before the reaction. The reduction temperature was increased slowly from room temperature to 883 K (10 K min−1) and maintained at 883 K for 2 h. After the reduction, reactants with a molar ratio of 3:2 to C3H8:H2 were introduced into the catalytic reactor for the reaction at 873 K and a GHSV of 22,500 mL gcat−1 h−1. The products were analyzed with an on-line GC (FID detector, Series 6000, Younglin & Co.) equipped with a capillary column (GS-Alumina, 50 m). Here, if there were no words, selectivity means as the selectivity of n-propane to propylene, which was calculated as follows;
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
3.1.1. Physical properties of θ-Al2O3 and calcined PtSn catalysts
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of θ-Al2O3 and the calcined PtSn catalysts. All the peaks were corresponding to θ-Al2O3 phases at 2θ values of 31.1°, 33.1°, 37.2°, 39.5°, 45.1°, and 48.0° (ICDD file no.: 47-1771). The intensities at 39.5° in XRD patterns of the (PtSn)E, (Pt-Sn)E and (Sn-Pt)E catalysts are stronger than those at ca 37.2°, but the XRD patterns seem not to provide any information about Pt and Sn oxide phases due to the low weight percentage of Pt and Sn metals [14], [20], [21].

Table 1 shows the metal compositions, BET surface areas and average pore diameters of the calcined PtSn catalysts. The ICP-AES analysis shows there are no considerable differences in the metal compositions. BET surface areas of all the PtSn catalysts were about 86–88 m2 g−1, indicating that BET surface areas of the catalysts were not so much changed depending on the impregnation methods. The pore volumes (0.325–0.337 cm3/g) and average pore sizes (14.9–15.3 nm) of all the calcined PtSn catalysts also show the similar values. The pore structure of the prepared PtSn catalysts was not affected by the solvent to dissolve metal precursors. The isotherms of θ-Al2O3 and the calcined PtSn catalysts indicate that the θ-Al2O3 support has a mesoporous structure with a typical IV isotherm and H2 adsorption hysteresis (Fig. S1) [37]. The pore size distributions from the N2 adsorption-desorption of all the PtSn catalysts were not so much different from each other (Fig. S2). However, it can be only noticed the pore sizes of (PtSn)E and (PtSn)A catalysts prepared by the co-impregnation were slightly larger than those of other catalysts prepared by the sequential impregnation.

Table 2 shows the metal dispersions and metal surface areas of the prepared PtSn catalysts. Metal dispersions of the PtSnA catalysts ((Pt-Sn)A, (Sn-Pt)A and (PtSn)A) were three times higher than respective of the PtSnE catalysts ((Pt-Sn)E, (Sn-Pt)E and (PtSn)E). The metal dispersions of the PtSnE catalysts decreased in the order of (PtSn)E > (Pt-Sn)E > (Sn-Pt)E, while those of the PtSnA catalysts decreased in the order of (Sn-Pt)A > (PtSn)A > (Pt-Sn)A. Differently for the pore structures, the CO chemisorption shows that the metal dispersions of the PtSn bimetallic catalysts were very dependent on the type of solvent to dissolve the precursors in the impregnation steps. It should also be noted that the optimized impregnation procedures to get the catalyst with the highest metal dispersion are depending on solvent dissolving the metal precursors. The (PtSn)E prepared by the co-impregnation shows the highest metal dispersion among the PtSnE catalysts. However, the (Sn-Pt)A catalyst prepared by the sequential impregnation of the Sn and Pt components shows the highest metal dispersion among the PtSnA catalysts. Fig. 2 shows particle size distributions from TEM images. The average metal particle sizes of the PtSnE catalysts measured by the CO chemisorption were similar to those by the TEM analysis.

However, the average metal particle sizes of the PtSnA catalysts measured by the CO chemisorption were 2 times larger than those by the TEM analysis. The particle sizes of a few nanometers by TEM images were not clear. The STEM images of the PtSnA catalysts measured by a Titan TEM (Fig. 5) shows that sub-nano particles are aggregated on the alumina surface, while the STEM images of the PtSnE catalysts show the crystalline particles. The apparent sizes of the aggregates of metal sub-nanoparticles were measured as the particles sizes by TEM images in Table 2, indicating the real metal particle sizes are much smaller than those calculated by the CO chemisorption. One probable reason is that the sub-nano particles are not active for CO chemisorption, and another is that the embedded metal particles on the surface of alumina support are inaccessible to CO.
3.1.2. Temperature programmed reduction of calcined PtSn catalysts
Fig. 3 shows temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles of all the prepared PtSn catalysts. All the TPR profiles were deconvoluted using Lorentzian-Gaussian functions. The reduction temperature and the hydrogen consumption in TPR profiles were summarized in Table 3. The low reduction temperatures around 450 K–600 K (α peaks) has been assigned to the reduction of Pt metal oxides in the weak interaction with the support [20], [38], [39]. The reduction temperatures in the range of 601 K–700 K (β peaks) were assigned to the co-reduction of Pt and Sn metal oxides [40] which were mainly related to the reduction of Pt oxides in the strong interaction with support. The reduction temperature ranges from 701 K to 800 K (γ peaks) can be assigned to the reduction of Sn4+/Sn2+ and/or Sn2+/Sn0 in the weak interaction with the support [14], [41], [42]. The broad peaks around 801 K–954 K (δ peaks) can be due to the reduction of Sn2+ to Sn0 species interacting strongly with support. The total hydrogen consumption of all the prepared catalysts decreased in the order of (Sn-Pt)A > (PtSn)A > (PtSn)E > (Pt-Sn)A > (Pt-Sn)E > (Sn-Pt)E. The hydrogen consumptions of the (Sn-Pt)A and (PtSn)A catalysts were the highest among the prepared catalysts. Especially, the reduction percentages of the PtSnA catalysts were high in the temperature ranges of α and β peaks as compared with the PtSnE catalysts. The hydrogen consumptions in the reduction temperature ranges of α and β peaks show the values of 0.073 mmol g−1–0.078 mmol g−1 for all the PtSnA catalysts and the values of 0.058 mmol g−1–0.061 mmol g−1 for all the PtSnE catalysts.

From these observations, it can be suggested that the Pt and Sn oxides on the PtSnA catalysts have weak interactions with the supports. On the other point of view, the particle sizes of the Pt and Sn oxides on the PtSnA catalysts are very small as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2. Therefore, the highly dispersed Pt and Sn oxides of the Pt-SnA catalysts can also be a reason for the high hydrogen consumption in the low reduction temperature ranges of α and β peaks. For the PtSnE catalysts, the impregnation procedures affected the hydrogen consumption in the reduction temperature ranges of α and β peaks. The Pt metal oxides on the (Pt-Sn)E catalyst are in the weak interaction with the support or highly dispersed on the support (Fig. 3(a)), while the Sn interactions with the supports are very strong with the (Sn-Pt)E catalyst (Fig. 3(b)). The Sn particles are dispersed and the Pt particles are scattered on the calcined (PtSn)E catalysts [21]. Therefore, the strong interaction of Sn with the support on the (Sn-Pt)E catalyst retarded the reduction of Sn as shown in Fig. 3(b). Then, the mobility of Sn to Pt particles to form PtSn alloy can be prevented, which can result in low selectivity and stability.
3.2. Catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation
3.2.1. Propane dehydrogenation on the PtSn bimetallic catalysts
Fig. 4 shows the selectivity and conversion for propane dehydrogenation with respect to the reaction time on the prepared PtSn bimetallic catalysts and Table 4 shows the deactivation parameters, product distributions and propylene yields of the PtSn catalysts. The propane dehydrogenation was carried out at 873 K and a GHSV of 22,500 mL g−1 h−1 for 5 h. The (Pt-Sn)A catalyst shows the highest selectivity and stability among the tested catalysts. After 5 h, the (Pt-Sn)A catalyst shows the highest propylene yield of 25.7%. The (Sn-Pt)A catalyst shows the highest initial conversion (30.9%) and the moderate selectivity (88.7%). The propylene yield of the (Sn-Pt)A catalyst is in the second place after 5 h reaction. It is clear that propylene yields of all the PtSnA catalysts were higher than those of all the PtSnE catalysts. Especially, the PtSnE catalysts were deactivated so fast that the propylene yields were very low after 5 h. The (PtSn)E catalyst only shows the comparable activity and selectivity with the PtSnA catalysts among the prepared PtSnE catalysts. It was kinetically observed that the catalytic activity of PtSn catalysts decreased in the order of ethanol > water > acetone [36], supporting the results for cyclohexane dehydrogenation with PtSn catalysts [35]. In that report, water was used as a solvent to dissolve the Pt and Sn precursors. For comparison, the (PtSn)W and (Sn-Pt)W catalysts were prepared using water as solvent dissolving the Pt and Sn precursors and their activity was examined [Tables S1–S3]. The conversion (24.4%) and selectivity (80.4%) of the (PtSn)W catalyst were lower than the conversion (29.4%) and selectivity (88.4%) of the (PtSn)E catalyst, supporting the reported results on the solvent effect. On the other hand, the conversion (24.3%) and selectivity (84.1%) of the (Sn-Pt)W catalyst with the metal dispersion of 7.7% were comparable with the conversion (21.6%) and selectivity (88.4%) of the (Sn-Pt)E catalyst. However, the mixed acid addition to water significantly enhanced the metal dispersions, resulting in high activity for propane dehydrogenation. It should be noted that the catalytic activities of PtSnE and PtSnW catalysts are very dependent on the impregnation procedures, but those of PtSnA catalysts are not.

Fig. 5 shows STEM and TEM images of the reduced PtSnE and PtSnA catalysts, which was measured by a Titan STEM/TEM. The metal particles of ∼20 nm are shown in the STEM images of (PtSn)E catalysts (Fig. 5(c1′)), while the aggregates of sub-nano particles are observed with the STEM images of (PtSn)A catalysts (Fig. 5(f1′)). The average metal particle sizes of the PtSnE catalysts by TEM images are equivalent to those from CO chemisorption. Although the metal particle sizes of the PtSnA catalysts by TEM images were measured by the size of the aggregates, the average metal particle sizes on the PtSnA catalysts by TEM images were half of those by the CO chemisorption. Fig. 5(d1, e1, f1, f1′) clearly shows that the sizes of all the metal particles on the PtSnA catalysts are far below 1 nm. The formation of the sub-nano particles of the PtSnA catalysts is not dependent on the impregnation procedures. When the acid solution was used in the impregnation step, surface alumina can be dissolved and the dissolved aluminium ions can be re-deposited with metal components on the alumina surface. In acidic solution, the surface of aluminium oxide is dissolved via Al[OH]2+ cations by hydration [43]. Then, the aluminium cations can be re-deposited with chloroplatinic anions on alumina. No change of the pore structures of the PtSnA catalysts indicates that the dissolution of metal ions is limited on the surface. Due to the dissolution-deposition process, the metal dispersions of the PtSnA catalysts can rarely be influenced by the sequence of metal impregnation in the sequential impregnation method, because the deposited metal ions can be re-dissolved and co-precipitated in the next step. So, it is proposed that the sub-nano metal particles on the PtSnA catalysts were formed from the dissolution-precipitation. The dissolution-precipitation on the alumina support was also observed in the preparation of Mo/Al2O3 catalysts [44], [45].

3.2.2. Stability tests of the (PtSn)E, (Pt-Sn)A, (Sn-Pt)A and (PtSn)A catalysts
Fig. 6 shows the time-dependent catalytic activity of the (PtSn)E, (Pt-Sn)A, (Sn-Pt)A, and (PtSn)A catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. These catalysts were selected on the yield and selectivity basis from Table 4 and Fig. 4. The reaction was carried out at 873 K and a GHSV of 22,500 mL gcat−1 h−1 for 15 h. Table 5 shows the deactivation parameters, product distributions and propylene yield of the selected PtSn catalysts. The initial conversion of 29.4%, 29.3%, 30.9% and 30.2% on the (PtSn)E, (Pt-Sn)A, (Sn-Pt)A, and (PtSn)A catalysts decreased to 20.3%, 22.1%, 21.6%, and 21.3%, respectively. The propylene selectivity decreased in the order of (Pt-Sn)A > (PtSn)A > (Sn-Pt)A > (PtSn)E. In long term test, the selectivity at initial reaction time was not so much changed, but the conversions at initial reaction time are diverged in 5 h reaction and converged in 15 h.

4. Conclusions
The PtSn bimetallic catalysts were prepared by a co-impregnation or a sequential impregnation using different solvents. Two different solvents were used to dissolve the Pt and Sn precursors: 1) acid (aqueous acid solution of HCl and HNO3) and 2) ethanol. Water is also used as a solvent to dissolve Pt and Sn precursors for comparison. The activity and stability of the PtSnA catalysts were higher than that of the PtSnE catalysts, irrespective of the impregnation procedures. The catalytic performances of the PtSnE and (PtSn)W catalysts were dependent on the impregnation sequences, but those of the PtSnA catalysts were not. The Pt metal dispersions of the PtSnA catalysts were three times higher than those of the PtSnE catalysts. The aggregates of the metal sub-nanoparticles were observed on the PtSnA catalysts, which is the reason of the high metal dispersion. It is proposed that the formation of the metal sub-nanoparticles on the PtSnA catalysts is due to the dissolution of aluminium oxide on the alumina support by acid and precipitation of the dissolved aluminium ions and metal ions during the impregnation. The PtSnA catalysts with high metal dispersions show high stability as well as high activity and selectivity as compared with the PtSnE catalysts.
