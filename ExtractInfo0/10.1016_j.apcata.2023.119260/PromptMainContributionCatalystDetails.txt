Spectroscopic insights into the role of CO2 on the nature of Cr species in a CrOX/Al2O3 catalysts during ethane dehydrogenation with CO2
The dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 was studied on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts (8 wt% of CrOx) in the 600–675 °C temperature range. The role of CO2 was determined by comparison with catalytic and spectroscopic data of ethane dehydrogenation without CO2. Characterization of fresh catalyst suggested an intimate interaction of Cr and support. Moreover, in situ Raman spectroscopic analysis combined with XPS studies done on reaction exposed samples indicated changes in both the nature of active Cr species and the reaction mechanism depending on the reaction conditions (i.e., presence/absence of CO2, and the reaction temperature). At lower temperatures (600–625 °C), CO2 promotes the re-oxidation of Cr3+ to Cr6+ favoring the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) route. While at higher temperatures (650–675 °C), the reaction occurs mainly via a catalytic dehydrogenation mechanism, as CO2 is no longer capable of re-oxidizing Cr3+ to Cr6+, with CO2 inhibiting partially the formation of coke.
1. Introduction
Ethylene is the most important feedstock in Petrochemistry, and due to high consumption in many applications, the global ethylene capacity has increased in the last decade, and it is expected to reach more than 200 million tons by 2026 [1]. Ethylene is produced almost exclusively in the chemical sector by steam cracking [2], a high energy consuming and non-catalytic process [3], [4]. Additional disadvantages include low yield of ethylene and high amount of coke production [5], [6]. In this scenario, the development of alternative and cost-effective processes to produce olefins is highly desirable [5], [6], [7], [8].
The selective oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) has been proposed as a promising alternative route to ethylene [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], exploiting cheap ethane (from both natural or shale gas), due to the exothermic character of the reaction, the in-situ reactivation of the catalysts and the relatively low reaction temperatures required. Although the main studies on ethane ODHE have been carried out using oxygen/air as oxidant [8], [9], [10], [11], the number of studies on ethane ODH, in which CO2 is used as a soft oxidant (ODHE-CO2), has grown in the last years [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. This is so because the use of CO2 as oxidant could favor the formation of ethylene with net negative CO2 emissions, even more so if the ODHE-CO2 reaction is complemented with a certain contribution of dry reforming to obtain ethylene and synthesis gas [15], [16].
Despite the common interest on using O2 as oxidant in ODHE, some drawbacks include its excessive oxidative power, leading to the oxidation of the desired products, and their flammability, that requires additional safety precautions. Moreover, the reaction with oxygen is exothermic, requiring ways to remove the generated heat [13]. In contrast, there are several potential ways for the development of alternative technologies utilizing CO2 as a soft oxidant and promoter to produce chemical [15], [16]. CO2 is a mild oxidant, thus making reoxidation of the active centers slower when compared to the reoxidation caused by oxygen, while also capable of partially removing coke by the reverse Boudouard reaction, or promoting other reactions [15]. However, the ODHE-CO2 is a thermodynamically un-favored process, competing at the reaction temperatures of 600–700 °C with ethane dry reforming and ethane/ethylene decomposition reactions, the last ones with almost 100% conversion [15]. Thus, catalyst development slowing down the undesired reactions is critical for high olefin selectivity.
Over the years, different metallic oxides were used as catalysts for alkane ODH with CO2 as soft oxidant [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], in which chromium-based catalysts seem to show great activity in oxidative reactions [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], due to its different oxidation states and its capability of undergoing a redox cycle [21], [22]. Chromium oxide is typically supported on materials with high surface areas [17], [19], [20], [21], [24] or incorporated in microporous materials [18], [23], [26]. For instance, Bugrova et al. [22] studying supported chromium oxide on aluminum, zirconium and cerium oxides, as well as a mixed support of cerium and zirconium, observed that the catalytic activity was extremely dependent on the redox properties of the chromium species. In this sense, the catalysts that presented a higher Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio showed the best ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity. Furthermore, the nature of the support also influenced the reactional paths followed during the process. The alumina-based catalyst, for example, presented a CO/C2H4 formation rate ratio very close to 1, which indicates that the overall oxidative dehydrogenation reaction is the main reaction. The zirconium-based catalyst, on the other hand, showed similar catalytic activity, but a CO/C2H4 ratio close to 2 at high temperatures, indicating the occurrence of parallel reactions.
It is widely accepted that Cr6+ species are responsible for the high catalytic activity and ethylene formation of chromium-based catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. XPS studies on chromium oxide supported on the SBA-15, with different pore sizes, showed that the optimum catalyst had the highest Cr6+/Cr3+ atomic ratio [24]. Similar results were found on silica-supported chromium catalysts promoted by different oxides, such as Zr, Sr, Sn, and Ce [21].
The spent catalysts presented significant changes in the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios, as the Cr6+ species were completely reduced in some cases. At the same time, Cr3+ species have been suggested to act as active sites on propane dehydrogenation on zirconium-supported chromium catalysts [27]. In this way, it has been proposed that Cr3+ species (that were reduced from Cr6+ during reaction) can also function as active sites, while dispersed Cr3+ (that were already present on the fresh catalyst) are considered to be less active [28]. This is because the reduced samples can more easily participate in the redox cycle, on contrary to the dispersed samples, which presents a stronger interaction with the support.
It is well known that two types of surface Cr6+ species are present in supported chromium oxide catalysts as observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy [29], which were named “monomeric” or “isolated” and “polymeric” species. The first were difficult to be reduced, while the latter were more easily reduced on the same support. These species were later denominated “hard” and “soft”, respectively, by Baek et al. [30]. The soft species presented a low interaction with the support, a mesoporous silica, and showed a greater facility to be reduced to Cr3+ and to be re-oxidized to Cr6+, which gave the catalysts with larger quantities of soft species a higher catalytic activity. Consequently, although it is important to obtain a catalyst with a high ratio of Cr6+/Cr3+ species, it is also very important that the Cr3+ species can be readily oxidized to the original Cr6+ oxidation state, in order to keep the redox cycle working, since it is precisely the reoxidation process of Cr3+ species that will recover the lattice oxygen species.
In the present study, chromium-based catalysts (8 % mass wt.) supported on γ-alumina were evaluated on the production of ethylene in the presence and absence of CO2. The experiments were conducted in the temperature range of 600–675 °C. A careful analysis of the ratio of H2, CO and CH4 in relation to ethylene was performed, in order to verify the different reactions and pathways most likely to occur between the two routes, likely to occur between the dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation routes. CO2 activation and the nature of the chromium active species will be discussed based on in situ spectroscopic studies.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Alumina-supported chromium catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation of γ-Al2O3 (SBET = 216 m2 g−1, from ABCR, 97%) with an aqueous solutions of chromium nitrate Cr(NO3)3·9 H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99 %). The chromium loading selected (ca. 8 wt%) corresponds to one theoretical monolayer covering the surface of support (i.e., 5 atoms Cr per nm2 of the support [22]), in order to maximize the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio. The catalysts were dried overnight at 100 °C and calcined at 650 °C for 4 h (2 °C min−1). The used catalysts will be named as 8CrAl(x)y, with x indicating whether they were tested in the presence of CO2 or N2, and y the reaction temperature. For example, the catalyst 8CrAl(CO2)650 was tested in ethane ODH, in the presence CO2, at a reaction temperature of 650 °C.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
N2-adsorption isotherms were recorded in a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 device and the Brunauer-Emmet- Teller (BET) method was used to estimate the surface areas. The solids were degassed in vacuum at 300 °C prior to the analysis.
X-ray diffraction patterns were collected in an Enraf Nonius FR590 diffractometer with a monochromatic CuKα1 source operated at 40 keV and 30 mA.
Raman spectra were obtained in an inVia Renishaw spectrometer, equipped with an Olympus microscope. The laser wavelength was 514 nm, generated with a Renishaw HPNIR laser with a power of approximately 15 mW. In situ Raman studies were done using a commercial Linkam 1000 Raman cell. The reaction has been done in a flow of 30 mL min−1 ethane/N2 (molar ratio 12/88) or ethane/CO2/N2 (molar ratio 10/20/70), and the reaction temperature was set to 600 °C or 650 °C with a heating ramp of 10 °C min−1. Once achieved the target temperature, the reaction was kept for 0.5 and 3 h. Spectra were acquired at specific reaction conditions, stopping the reaction, switching from the reactant gases to He flow and cooling down to 200 °C.
UV–visible reflectance spectroscopy (DR-UV–vis) measurements of the solids were carried out using a Varian spectrometer model Cary 5000, within the 200 − 800 nm range.
Temperature-programmed reduction experiments (H2-TPR) were performed in an Autochem 2910 (Micromeritics) equipped with a TCD detector. The solids were heated until 800 °C, with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and the reducing gas was composed of 10 % H2 in Ar, with a total flow rate of 50 mL min−1.
TG-DTA analyses of the spent catalysts were performed in a Mettler-Toledo thermobalance (TGA/SDTA 851). Approximately 10 mg of each solid were introduced in the device and heated up to 600 °C under synthetic air flow (50 mL min−1). The heating rate used was 10 °C min−1.
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected using a SPECS spectrometer equipped with an MCD-9 detector and using a non-monochromatic AlKα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source. Spectra were recorded using an analyzer pass energy of 30 eV, an X-ray power of 100 W and an operating pressure of 10−9 mbar. Data processing was performed using the CASA software. Cr2O3 (supplied from Sigma-Aldrich) was used as reference for determining multiplet splitting and spectra deconvolution parameters. For the catalytic XPS studies a high-pressure catalytic reactor (HPCR) connected under vacuum to the XPS chamber was used. The reaction was done in a flow of 30 mL min−1 ethane/N2 (molar ratio of 12/88) or ethane/CO2/N2 (molar ratio of 10/20/70), and the reaction temperature was set to 600 °C or 650 °C with a heating ramp of 10 °C min−1. Once achieved the target temperature, the reaction was kept for 2 h. In an additional experiment, after ethane/N2 flow conditions, the reactant feed was switch to 30 mL/min CO2/N2 (vol% 40/60) and the temperature increased up to 700 °C at a heating ramp of 10 °C min−1.
TPR-C2H6 and TPO-CO2 experiments were conducted using a quartz micro reactor coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Omnistar, Balzers). 180 mg catalyst was preactivated in O2 flow (18 mL min−1) at 300 °C. After pre-activation the sample was cooled down in Ar flow (18 mL min−1) to 25 °C. Once stabilized the temperature, the reactant feed was switched from Ar to 12 mL min−1 (Ethane/N2 molar ratio of 12/88). Reaction temperature was increased up to 600 °C with a heating ramp of 10 °C min−1 and the reaction products analyzed by on line MS. After 1 h at 600 °C, the temperature was decreased to 25 °C in Ar flow. Once stabilized the temperature, the gas was switched from Ar to 12 mL min−1 (CO2/N2 molar ratio of 40/60) and the temperature increased to 700 °C at 10 °C min−1. Again, reaction products were analyzed by MS.
2.3. Catalytic tests
Catalytic tests were carried out under steady state conditions in a fixed bed quartz reactor (i.d. 90 mm, length 400 mm) at temperatures in the range of 600–675 °C and atmospheric pressure. For the ODHE experiments, the feed consisted of an ethane/CO2/N2 mixture with 10/20/70 volumetric ratio and total flow rate of 50 mL min −1. Catalyst mass was 400 mg in all experiments, and it was always diluted in silicon carbide, resulting in a contact time (W/F) of 29.9 gcat h molethane−1. In the experiments in the absence of CO2 (catalytic dehydrogenation, CD), the feed consisted of an ethane/N2 mixture with a 10/90 volumetric ratio, keeping the total flow of 50 mL min−1 and 400 mg of catalyst mass. The catalytic performance was evaluated for a 4.2 h reaction. The reactor was heated at 10 °C min−1 and during this process the catalyst was put in contact with the gaseous mixture, excluding ethane. When the desired temperature was reached, the system was left on hold for 15 min for stabilization purposes and only then was ethane finally put in contact with the catalyst.
Reactants and products were analyzed by gas chromatography using two packed columns: (i) molecular sieve 5 A (3 m); and (ii) Porapak Q (3 m). Blank experiments were also carried out, and null conversions of ethane were found.
The conversion of reactants (X) and yield (Y) and selectivity (S) of products were calculated by the following equations, where F is the molar flowrate of the components.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic results
Fig. 1 shows the catalytic results during the ethane ODH with CO2 (ODHE-CO2) over a supported chromium oxide catalyst in the 600–675 °C temperature range. Both conversion of ethane (Fig. 1a) and yield to ethylene (Fig. 1c) increase when increasing the reaction temperature. On the other hand, the conversion of CO2 (Fig. 1b) and the yield of CO (Fig. 1d) were lower to those achieved for ethane conversion and yield of ethylene, respectively. But, since we are using an ethane/CO2 ratio of 1/2 in the feed, it can be concluded that there is a relatively similar reaction rate for both ethane and CO2 conversion.

Reaction conditions in text.
In addition, a catalyst decay has been observed in all temperature range studied, this effect being more important when increasing the reaction temperature. We noticed that the loss of activity observed in the ODH experiments remained similar in all reaction temperatures, close to 50 %.
For comparison, Fig. 2 presents the catalytic results for the catalytic ethane transformation in the absence of CO2 (i.e., catalytic dehydrogenation, CD) in the same reaction temperature range of 600–675 °C. At short time on stream, both ethane conversion and yield of ethylene increase with the reaction temperature. However, at higher time on streams, a catalyst decay is observed. This catalyst decay strongly increases when the reaction temperature is increased.

Fig. 3 shows the variation of selectivity to ethylene and methane during the transformation of ethane in the presence (Fig. 3a) and in the absence (Fig. 3b) of CO2. In general, the selectivity to ethylene decreases slightly with the reaction temperature, being somewhat lower in the case of experiments in the presence of CO2, due to the increase in methane formation.

On the other hand, as displayed in Fig. 2, the deactivation rate of the catalyst in the absence of CO2 increased with the reaction temperature and was even more severe, showing an important loss of activity. Thus, at a time on stream of 250 min, the loss of activity was of ca. 71% (the ethane conversion varies from 49 % to 14%) or 76% (the ethane conversion varies from 51 % to 12 %), for the experiments conducted at 650 and 675 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the initial conversion of ethane at 625–675 °C were practically the same, but the deactivation rate kept increasing. This shows that increasing the temperature in the CD experiments did not improve ethylene yield, contrary to what was observed for the ODHE-CO2 experiments. A summary of the catalytic results for the experiments in the presence and in the absence of CO2 is presented on Table S1 (supplementary information).
A comparison between results for ethane conversion in the presence of CO2 (Fig. 1a) and in absence of CO2 (Fig. 2a) are shown in Fig. S1a and S1b (supplementary information). A considerable shift in the conversion behavior of ethane can be seen influenced by the presence of CO2.
Comparing the results at 600 and 625 °C, ethane conversion is higher on the CD experiments throughout the whole experiment, however that completely changes at higher reaction temperatures (i.e., 650 and 675 °C), and from that point onwards the conversion on the ODH experiment was kept higher. The same can be seen on the yield of ethylene obtained: the final yield of ethylene (time on stream of ca. 250 min) at 600 °C in the ODH experiments is practically the same at 675 °C for the CD experiments, whereas the final yield of ethylene at 675 °C for the ODH experiment is higher than any yield value found on the CD experiments. In addition, the ODH experiments presented a positive tendency in the overall ethylene yield in regard to temperature; that is, as the temperature increased, the reaction yield also increased. The ethylene yield tendency for the CD experiments do not present the same behavior, as the points overlap with each other. When the experiment starts, ethylene yield is higher at 650 and 675 °C. However, this is altered during the experiment, as the yield of ethylene at 600 °C is the highest close to 3 h of reaction time and remains this way until the end of the experiment. Furthermore, the higher the temperature is, the faster the yield diminishes, as the yield of ethylene at 675 °C is already lower than 650 °C at a reaction time of 30 min.
In order to develop hypothesis about the different reactions that are occurring in each experiment, the mole ratio of H2, CO and CH4 in relation to ethylene were calculated at different reaction temperatures and at a time on stream of ca. 250 min, in the presence (Fig. 4a) or in the absence (Fig. 4b) of CO2. Table S2 (Supplementary information) shows a summary of the mole ratio of side products in relation to ethylene reaction times of 137 and 250 min. The ratio found for the ODH experiments remained practically constant during the experiment. The same cannot be said for the CD experiments, since the initial ratio for both H2 and CH4 in relation to ethylene were much higher than the ones found at 137 and 250 min.

Fig. 4. Variation of the H2/C2H4 and CO/C2H4 ratios with time on stream at reaction temperatures of 600, 625, 650 or 675 °C during the ethane transformation in the presence of CO2 (a), or in the absence of CO2 (b). The catalytic results were achieved at a time on stream of ca. 250 min. The lines were drawn to help visualization.
In the case of ethane ODH with CO2 (Fig. 4a), it can be seen that side reactions become more predominant as the temperature increases, since in addition to the formation of methane (Fig. 3) the H2/C2H4 increases with the reaction temperature. The CO/C2H4 ratio, however, remained somewhat constant, between 0.9 and 1.2. Methane was also identified, possibly related to a non-selective oxidation of ethane in the presence of CO2 [31]. The methane production remained low throughout the experiment, less than five times the production of ethylene at its maxima, while the H2 production was higher but remained lower than the production of CO and ethylene overall. This higher production of H2 might be explained by the increase in the reaction temperature, which favors cracking reactions and the non-oxidative dehydrogenation reaction.
Fig. 4b shows H2/C2H4 ratio during the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane in absence of CO2. It can be observed that the H2/C2H4 ratio tends to 1 at high reaction times, which is in accordance with the catalytic dehydrogenation stoichiometry. The results achieved at low time on stream, with H2/C2H4 ratio of ca. 1.6–2.0, should be related to the yield of hydrogen during the coking reaction.
On the other hand, the absence of CO2 in the feed resulted in a higher quantity of coke found (see Table 1), due to the thermal cracking of ethane and/or ethylene. The small traces of methane found could be due to a non-selective cracking of ethane, generating methane, hydrogen and coke.

From a direct comparison of both systems, it can be noted that the mole ratio of the main side products - CO in the ODHE-CO2 experiments and H2 in the CD experiments - in relation to ethylene is very close to 1 in all cases. This means that the proposed reaction for each case was oxidative dehydrogenation and catalytic dehydrogenation, respectively. Nevertheless, the effects of side reactions were noticeable on all experiments, even more at higher temperatures, in which cracking become more likely to occur.
3.2. Characterization results
The XRD pattern of fresh catalyst is depicted in Fig. 5a. The material shows peaks related to chromium oxide, at 2θ = 24.5°, 33.6°, 36.5°, 50.2° and 54.9°, related to Cr2O3 (PDF# 38–1479) [20], [24], [26], and γ-alumina, at 2θ = 46° and 67° [32]. No distinguishable features between the catalysts can be seen, even on the spent ones. The low chromium peak intensity observed suggests crystals of small sizes of chromium oxide particles well dispersed on the surface of the support.

Fig. 5. Characterization results of fresh catalyst (8CrAl sample): (a) XRD pattern; (b) Raman spectrum; (c) DR-UV–vis spectrum; and (d) H2-TPR pattern.
The Raman spectrum of fresh catalyst, presented in Fig. 5b, shows two small bands related to Cr2O3 at 344 and 550 cm−1 and a higher intensity band related to polymeric CrO3 species at 860 cm−1 [21], [23], [33], [34]. Accordingly, both crystalline Cr2O3 and polymeric Cr6+-species are present in the catalyst.
The structural properties of the support and catalyst were determined by nitrogen adsorption. The γ-alumina support had a surface area of 216 m2 g−1, a pore volume of 0.46 cm3 g−1 and a pore diameter of 7.6 nm. After chromium impregnation and calcination, there is a small alteration in the structure of the catalyst, presenting a surface area (180 m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.38 cm3 g−1) slightly smaller, while the pore diameter (7.9 nm) increases slightly.
DR-UV-Vis results for the fresh catalyst (Fig. 5c) present two intense bands at 260 and 370 nm that represent the Cr6+ state for chromium species with tetrahedral structure and one main band at 470 nm that represents octahedral Cr3+ [18], [21], [33], [35].
TPR- H2 pattern of fresh catalyst is presented in Fig. 5d. One major peak can be seen around 295 °C, which corresponds to the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], in accordance with previous analysis, in which only one reduction state was found. Two minor shoulders can be seen around 450 °C and 550 °C, which could be related to one step reduction of Cr6+ species stabilized on the alumina surface and to the reduction of bulk chromate species, respectively [40].
After reaction, the spent catalysts were analyzed by thermogravimetric analyses in the temperature range of 50–750 °C and the results are shown in Table 1. The catalysts that reacted in the absence of CO2 showed a higher value of coke in its surface, in agreement with characterization results discussed below. Most noticeable, coke deposition during the CD experiments at a reaction temperature 650 °C was higher than the ODH experiments at 675 °C. The loss of catalytic activity at 650 and 675 °C in the absence of CO2 is practically the same, as are the values for coke deposition.
In order to get a deeper understanding of the nature of Cr species and try to correlate them with the reaction mechanism, XPS studies were done on fresh (Fig. 6a) and spent samples (Fig. 7). For the last case the samples were exposed to reaction conditions in a high-pressure catalytic reactor connected under vacuum to the XPS analyze chamber. After reaction the sample were transferred under vacuum conditions to the XPS analyze chamber. For a clear assessment of oxidation states, Cr2O3 was taken as reference and fitted into a main peak and two multiple splitting peaks (details in SI), according to previous works in the literature [41], [42]. Taken into account this deconvolution pattern, two oxidation states of Cr can be detected in the fresh sample, i.e., Cr6+ with BE 580.0 eV and Cr3+ with the main component at 576.9 eV and the two satellites at 578.4 and 580.8 eV, respectively (Fig. 6a). Quantitative analysis point to 34.9% Cr6+ and 65.1 % Cr3+. In fact, the coexistence of both oxidation states is in line with the Raman analysis discussed above.

(iii) After ethane ODH with CO2 at 600 °C (e) or 650 °C (f). Red line corresponds to Cr3+ (main peak and two multiplet splitting peaks at higher BE); and blue line corresponds to Cr6+.
Next, XPS studies were done by exposing the fresh sample to catalytic dehydrogenation (CD) conditions in an ethane/N2 flow and stopping the reaction at two different temperatures, 600 and 650 °C, after 2 h of reaction (details in experimental section). In both cases Cr3+ were only observed in the XPS spectra (Fig. 7a), concluding this as the active specie under CD conditions. While Cr2+ with BE 575.5 eV was not detected in any case, their existence cannot be completely discarded, since it could exist bellow the limit of detection. Interestingly, when submitting both reduced samples to a flow of CO2 and increasing the temperature up to 700 °C, Cr3+ is reoxidized to Cr6+. The reoxidation take place in a higher extension in the sample previously reduced in ethane/N2 at 600 °C (showing ∼ 35 % of Cr6+) than in the one reduced at higher temperature, i.e., 650 °C (with ∼ 16 % of Cr6+) (Fig. 7, spectra c and d, respectively; and Table 1).
The different reoxidation pattern may indicate different types of reduced chromium species, with different reoxidation properties [21], [23], [24], [26], [27], [28], [30], [35]. Thus, some authors postulate a reduction to Cr2+ as being responsible of coke formation [27] while other possibility is sintering of reduced polymeric Cr3+ species into Cr2O3 aggregates. According to some authors Cr2O3 cannot be reoxidized by CO2 [23], behaving less active than polymeric chromium species.
Complementary studies were done using time and temperature resolved in situ Raman. Thus, studies under catalytic dehydrogenation (CD) conditions shows after 30 min of reaction at 600 °C the formation of a set of intense bands at 1350 cm−1 and 1600 cm−1, named bands D and G [43] associated to carbon species or coke, and bands at 303, 344, 551 and 608 cm−1, due to Cr2O3 [21], [27], while the original band at 860 cm−1 due to CrO3 is lost, pointing to Cr6+ reduction and partial sintering of Cr3+ species into Cr2O3 under reaction conditions (Fig. 8a). After 180 min of reaction at 600 °C, the bands at 303, 344, 551 and 608 cm−1, while still present, are less detected (Fig. 8a).

Once achieved the target temperature, the reaction was kept for 30 min and 180 min. Spectra were collected by cooling down in helium flow to 200 °C. a´ and b´ are expanded Raman spectra in low frequency region.
Meanwhile, at 650 °C, while Cr2O3 and carbon are visible at 30 min of reaction, the former bands disappear completely after 180 min, remaining those of carbon only (Fig. 8b). The absence of bands due to Cr species in the Raman spectra can be explained, in line with the XPS data (Table 1), by a higher fraction of carbon species covering the catalyst surface, and inhibiting the detection of chromium species. Notice that Raman is a surface sensitive technique. According to these results, the lower catalytic activity at 650 °C vs 600 °C under CD conditions (see Fig. S1) can be explained by a higher carbon coverage of coke like species at the higher temperature (i.e., 650 °C), as discussed previously.
Next, XPS and Raman studies under ODH conditions, in the presence of CO2, were done using an ethane/N2/CO2 flow and stopping the reaction at 600 or 650 °C. In the XPS study, after 2 h reaction (details in experimental section) at 600 °C, Cr6+ (10 %) and Cr3+ are detected (Fig. 7e). The presence of Cr6+ indicate a redox cycle between Cr3+ and Cr6+ promoted by the presence of CO2, being Cr6+ the active site in ODH mechanism, in line with other authors [20], [21]. However, at 650 °C, only Cr3+ is detected in the XPS Cr 2p peak (Fig. 7f), making a ODH mechanism less favorable, in favor to a CD path.
Based on these results, the prevalence of different reaction mechanism can be proposed in the presence of CO2, being dependent on the reaction temperature. Thus, in the low temperature range (600–625 °C), a ODH mechanism predominate being Cr6+-Cr3+ redox pair the active site, while in the high temperature range (650–675 °C), a CD mechanism predominate, being Cr3+ active specie. Here, an important point to consider is that, while analogous Cr3+ species have been detected in the XPS spectra of the sample exposed to CD conditions (in the absence of CO2) at 650 °C, and the one exposed to ODH (in the presence of CO2) at the same reaction temperature, the higher activity of the last one, may indicate an additional effect of CO2, either in inhibiting sintering of Cr3+ species by reducing their activity, or in promoting or shifting the equilibrium of C-H activation, or in reducing coke formation.
On one hand, TG and DSC analysis of used catalysts at 600, 650 and 675 °C (Fig. S2 and Table 1) shows a lower amount of coke when the catalysts are used in the ethane ODH with CO2, independently of the reaction temperature, while coke formation increases when increasing the reaction temperature. In addition, in situ Raman studies (Fig. 9) suggests that the presence of CO2 slows down the formation of coke, in particular at 650 °C (Fig. 9b), as well as the formation of Cr2O3. This behavior contrast with that observed on the same catalyst in absence of CO2 at the same temperature (see Fig. 8b).

Once achieved the target temperature, the reaction was kept for 30 min and 180 min. Spectra were collected by cooling down in helium flow to 200 °C. a´ and b´ are expanded Raman spectra in low frequency region.
Last, the activity and redox properties of Cr species have been studied by temperature-programmed TPR/TPO experiments done in the presence of ethane and CO2, respectively. TPR studies in a flow of ethane at increasing temperature up to 600 °C (Fig. 10a), shows H2 (m/Z = 2) evolution at 354 °C together with some amount of CO2 (m/Z = 44) (Fig. 10a). At increasing temperatures, H2O (m/Z = 18; at 506 ºC), CO2 (m/Z = 44; at 558 °C) and finally CH4 (m/Z = 15,16; at 586 °C) are also observed due to oxidation and cracking of surface adsorbed species. After reaching 600 °C in ethane/N2 flow, the catalyst is cooled down to 25 °C and submitted to a second TPO process in a flow of 40 % CO2/N2 at increasing temperatures up to 700 °C. As shown in Fig. 10b, a peak due to CO formation is observed with an onset temperature of 431 °C and maxima at 682 °C together with a small peak of H2 (m/Z = 2). CO may come from reoxidation of previously reduced Cr3+ species but can also be formed due to the reverse Boudouard reaction between coke and CO2 [26]. In addition, H2 may come from previous surface species which react with CO2 resulting in CO and H2 formation. In any case, while parallel reaction between surface species and CO2 cannot be avoided, this experiment shows that the reoxidation of reduced surface Cr species is strongly limited taking place at high temperatures, in agreement with previous XPS data.

3.3. General remarks
The catalytic results presented here suggest a positive effect on ethane conversion with the presence of CO2 in the feed specifically when the temperature is 650 or 675 °C and at time on streams higher than 100 min (Figs. S1a and S1b, Supplementary information). A similar conclusion can be proposed in the case of the yield of ethylene (Fig. S1c and S1d, Supplementary information).
These results are quite unexpected and actually differ from the ones found in the literature, in which the presence of CO2 always enhances the catalytic activity in ethane ODH reactions with chromium oxides [21], [24], [26], [27], [30], [35], [44], [45], [46]. The same can be said when other oxides are used [47], [48], [49]. The conversion curves on Fig. 1a indicate that the ethane conversion is already stabilized at 600 and 625 °C for the ODHE-CO2 experiments, while the ethane catalytic dehydrogenation, CD experiments (Fig. 1c), are still under deactivation effects at these temperatures. Based on the fact that the deactivation rate kept increasing at higher temperatures, we can assume that, when stable, the final ethane conversion at 600 and 625 °C for the CD experiments would be higher than the values found at 650 and 675 °C. That means the conversion of ethane for the CD experiments at 600 and 625 °C would still be higher than the ethane conversion for the ODH experiments, even on a longer experiment (see Figs. 1a and c).
Moreover, if we compare with the literature, ethane conversion at 30 min [46], or in the best of the cases below 300 min, ethylene yields of ca. 40 % at 650 °C are reported [45]. In addition, upon close inspection, the major difference found is that these studies used a CO2:C2H6 feed ratio of 5:1, while we used a 2:1 ratio. It is possible that at high CO2 concentrations, catalyst reoxidation is likely to occur even at lower temperatures. Indeed, in this work we found that CO2 participates in limiting the formation of coke and avoiding the sintering of Cr3+ species, Thus, we can assume that both effects can be tuned depending on the concentration of CO2 in the reaction mixture.
Next, in order to verify the different reactions and pathways a careful analysis of the ratio of H2, CO2, CO and CH4 in relation to ethylene was performed in this work. The conversions of ethane and CO2 and yields of ethylene and CO for the ODH experiments are presented on Fig. 2. The conversion of ethane in relation to CO2 (XC2H6/XCO2) remained close to 2 during the experiments. Since the ethane/CO2 ratio in the feed gas is 1:2, the mole ratio (NC2H6/NCO2, mol/mol) should be equal to 1.
After calculation, the values closest to 1 were found for the experiment at 675 °C (1.02 and 0.99, time on stream of ca. 0 and 250 min, respectively), while the furthest were found for the experiment at 625 °C (1.12 and 1.22, time on stream of ca. 0 and 250 min, respectively). Accordingly, these results suggest that ODH reaction is the main reaction occurring. The yield curves of ethylene and CO are very similar. However, strong differences are observed depending on the reaction temperature. At a time of stream of c.a. 250 min, the yield of ethylene at 600 and 625 °C are practically the same, as are the yield values for CO. A similar trend is observed for the experiments carried out at 650 and 675 °C. Based on these results, it can be concluded that changes in the characteristics of used catalysts depended on the reaction temperature and are also likely related to the CO2 concentration used in the experiments. These results confirm that, in addition to ODHE-CO2, there are other reactions involved, such as dry reforming or the Boudouard reaction, which modify the ethylene/CO and H2/CO ratios, depending on the reaction temperature.
In addition to the catalytic studies, a detailed analysis of the nature of the chromium active species and its dependence on the reaction conditions was done based on in situ spectroscopic studies. Thus, under CD conditions (in absence of CO2), XPS data shows the existence of only Cr3+ species, behaving these as active sites (Fig. 11). In addition, Raman studies evidence the formation of coke (Fig. 8), being promoted at increasing temperatures, resulting in catalyst deactivation.

Middle: reduction in ethane flow at 600 and 650 °C resulting in a reduction of Cr6+(B) in Cr3+ (A´). Right: reoxidation of Cr3+(A´) in CO2 flow at 700 °C. Cr3+ is reoxidized to Cr6+ in a more extension in the sample previously reduced in ethane/N2 at 600 °C than in the one reduced at higher temperature, i.e., 650 °C.
In ODH conditions (in the presence of CO2), different chromium species are observed depending on reaction temperature (Fig. 12). Thus, it is shown that at low temperature (600–625 °C), CO2 promote the re-oxidation of Cr3+ to Cr6+, supporting a redox mechanism, where Cr6+ behaves as active specie, in line with previous studies in the literature. However, at increasing reaction temperature (650–675 °C), even in the presence of CO2, only reduced Cr species (i.e., Cr3+) are observed, whereas based on Raman studies, the role of CO2 is in retarding coke formation and inhibiting the sintering of Cr3+ to Cr2O3. (Fig. 9b). Both features explain the higher catalytic performance obtained in the presence of CO2 in the 650–675 °C temperature interval compared to those observed in the absence of CO2 at similar temperatures.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence and absence of CO2 was studied on Al2O3-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the temperature range of 600–675 °C. The increase in the reaction temperature led to an increase in ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity for the ODH-CO2 experiments.
In contrast to these experiments, in the absence of CO2, the ethylene yield did not improve. Thus, after 4 h of experiment, the ethylene yield at 600 °C in the absence of CO2 was higher than the experiment performed at 675 °C. This was due to a severe decay of catalytic activity. While this decay is observed in all experiments, the presence of CO2 was able to mitigate this effect. Meanwhile, in the presence of CO2, secondary reactions, such as RWGS, dry reforming, cracking reaction or the Boudouard reaction appears, as revealed by a modification of the CO/ethylene, H2/ethylene and H2/CO molar ratios.
In parallel, the nature of chromium species under reaction relevant conditions was also studied in this work using in situ spectroscopic studies. XPS analyses revealed the presence of Cr6+ and Cr3+ at the surface of fresh catalysts. In situ studies showed that, when the catalyst was reduced in the absence of CO2, only Cr3+ species were present. This was corroborated by the in-situ Raman analysis, which showed a complete disappearance of bands related to Cr6+ after reduction in the absence of CO2. The latter addition of CO2 was able to re-oxidize some species of Cr3+ back to Cr6+. The degree of reoxidation was dependent on the reduction temperature, as shown by the in situ XPS and the TPR-TPD analyses. This fact suggests the existence of different types of reduced Cr3+ species, capable of influencing the catalytic activity.
The influence of reaction temperature on the role of CO2 was also studied, observing changes in the of role of CO2 depending on the reaction temperature. At lower temperatures (600–625 °C), CO2 promotes the re-oxidation of Cr3+ to Cr6+. In this case, a redox mechanism was observed. On the other hand, at higher temperatures (650–675 °C), the reactions occur predominately via a catalytic dehydrogenation mechanism, as CO2 is no longer capable of re-oxidizing Cr3+ to Cr6+. Moreover, CO2 favors partial elimination of coke, specifically at higher temperatures. This means that, even though ethylene yield is higher when compared to the lower-temperature experiments, it is no longer being generated by the ODH reaction, but via the CD reaction.
