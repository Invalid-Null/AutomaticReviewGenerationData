The document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. It focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant. While both processes involve dehydrogenation reactions to produce alkenes, propane dehydrogenation is not covered in this work.
