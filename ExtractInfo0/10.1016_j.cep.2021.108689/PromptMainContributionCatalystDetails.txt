Abstract
Direct dehydrogenation is one well-established process for the provision of short chain alkenes and suffers from rapid catalyst coking. Kinetic modeling of coke built-up and catalyst deactivation due to coking is essential to optimize the total production process consisting of alternating deactivation and regeneration cycles.
In this contribution two different deactivation approaches will by studied and evaluated. The first one, introduced by Janssens, describes deactivation as a loss of active catalyst mass depending on the conversion of the reactant. The second, an advanced microkinetic approach, was suggested by Dumez and Froment and explains the loss of activity by coke formation during the production process. Thus, a time dependent activity function is derived and correlated with the reaction rate.
Results of experiments performed in a lab scale tubular reactor on a VOx catalyst provided the basis for extending and parametrizing models for reaction kinetics, coke built-up and deactivation, respectively. Temperature and oxygen concentration have been varied to describe the activity dependence on time and reactor position.
Finally, modeling the cyclic operation of deactivation and regeneration was possible and allowed optimizing the individual time intervals to maximize total space time yield. A first proposal of an optimized cyclic process regime is presented.

1. Introduction
Deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts limits the reactor performance of many industrial processes [1]. Hydrocarbons used as the main feedstock in today's chemical industry are known to cause coke deposition, which blocks active centers resulting in a decline of catalyst activity and reactor performance with time on stream. Catalyst regeneration is frequently used to restore catalyst activity [2], [3], [4]. This can be accomplished by subsequent gasification of the carbon deposits, which are usually collectively referred as coke. Especially for processes with rapid deactivation, the mathematical modelling of the deactivation behavior is crucial for the optimization of overall production cycles, consisting of a production phase, where catalyst deactivation occurs and a regeneration phase, where the activity is restored (Fig. 1).

One well known reaction that suffers from catalyst coking is the direct dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, for example of propane to propene (Eq. (1)).
(1)
Commercialized processes that utilize this reaction follow different strategies to regenerate the catalyst. Examples are the Catofin and the Oleflex processes [5], [6], [7]. High propene selectivity can be achieved in these processes. However, the conversion is limited by chemical equilibrium and fast catalyst coking occurs.
An alternative reaction for propene production is the oxidative dehydrogenation.
(2)
Due to the presence of oxygen, coking of the catalyst can be avoided but consecutive oxidations of propene (Fig. 2: R3, R4) lower the selectivity towards propene. In particular consecutive reactions can be suppressed by using a membrane distributor setup to minimize local oxygen concentrations [8,9]. Concepts to combine both dehydrogenation reactions have also been published [10]. These concepts exploit the different reaction enthalpies and try to make use of a potential autothermal operation. Nevertheless, local catalyst deactivation remains a problem in this elaborated reactor setups.

To be able to evaluate the reactor performance and optimize the propene dehydrogenation processes it is necessary to be capable of describing coke built-up and catalyst activity under different operating conditions. Different approaches to describe the decay of catalyst activity are known in literature as discussed in the following.
Voorhies described the carbon formation on a cracking catalyst using a logarithmic function on time for a given feed composition and temperature [11]. With the development of more advanced chemical analytics a description of catalyst coking based on mechanistic considerations has been developed [12], [13], [14]. In many cases a monolayer-multilayer-coke-growth model (MMCGM) has been considered [15], [16], [17], [18]. These models distinguish between a monolayer of coke deposited at the catalyst surface and a secondary multilayer. The monolayer coke growth is in contrast to the multilayer, limited by a monolayer capacity of the specific catalyst. Froment and co-workers successfully connected the amount of coke on the catalyst (Fig. 1 (B)) to the catalyst activity (Fig. 1 (A)) by empirical equations [19,20]. The activity is incorporated in the kinetic equations by using a catalyst activity coefficient
which is defined as the ratio between the current and the initial reaction rate. These approaches have in common, that a profound knowledge about the reaction kinetics is necessary. As a result, such models provide insights into the activity profiles of the catalyst. On the other hand, the models are rather sophisticated and computationally demanding.
Janssens suggested another approach to describe catalyst deactivation by observing that the product distribution of methanol to olefins (MTO) reactors over time can be interpreted as a temporal shortening of the catalyst bed which is equivalent to a hypothetical loss of catalyst mass or increase in flow rate [21]. This model has been later refined and expanded in the field of MTO reactions [22,23].
A common technique during process design is the optimization of operating conditions including feed composition and temperatures [24], [25], [26]. The influence of dead times due to catalyst deactivation is often neglected. After identification and parametrization of deactivation and regeneration models an optimization of the whole production cycle is possible including production and regeneration phases as illustrated in Fig. 1. Optimal cycle times can be estimated to maximize the space time yield [27], [28], [29].
This contribution aims to develop, parametrize and apply deactivation models for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The models developed are based on the mentioned concepts by Dumez and Froment and by Janssens and enable to optimize cyclic reactor operation including production and deactivation phases. A coke burning model is applied together with the deactivation models to optimize cyclic reactor operation and to identify optimal upper and lower boundaries for the activity of the catalyst (Fig. 1,
,
) for varying operating conditions [18]. Combining the sub models provides the basis for simulation and optimization of non-standard reactor concepts, for example membrane reactors [9].
2. Material and methods
2.1. Catalyst
For the experimental investigations a VOx/γ-Al2O3 model catalyst was used. Catalyst systems based on vanadium have proved to be well performing in the field of dehydrogenation reactions [30], [31], [32], [33]. In previous works the used catalyst offered high conversion for both DDH and ODH reactions as well as a high selectivity towards the desired component propene [10,34]. The catalyst was prepared via impregnation of γ-Al2O3 spheres (diameter:
, specific area:
) with vanadyl acetylacetonate in acetone. After impregnation the catalyst was washed, dried and calcinated. The vanadium content of the catalyst is 1.4 % and its specific surface area amounts
(BET) [9,34,35].
2.2. Reactor setup and experimental procedure
For parametrization of the deactivation models, lab scale experiments in a quartz glass fixed bed reactor were conducted. The inner diameter (ID) of the reactor was 6 mm. The temperature range was varied between
and
. A weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of
was applied. The mass of the catalyst used for these experiments was 1.5 g which results in a bed length of around 6 cm. The quartz glass tube was heated by an electric oven and the temperature in the middle of the catalyst bed was measured and controlled with a thermocouple in the middle of the catalyst bed. For safety reasons, the propane and the oxygen concentrations were varied between 0% and the lower explosion limit of around 1% [36]. All gas flows were controlled by MFCs (Bronkhorst). The composition of the gas flows at the reactor inlet and at the reactor outlet were analyzed by GC measurements (Agilent Technologies 7890B GC System).
2.3. Parameter estimation and model discrimination
The objective function (OF) for the parameter estimations was defined as follows
(3)
(4)
In equation (4)
stands for the selectivity of component
and
for the conversion of propane. The evaluated values
have been normalized by the maximum of the corresponding experimental or simulation values, respectively.
All parameter estimations have been realized with a Gauß-Newton algorithm with trust region reflective approach using the lsqnonlin function provided by MATLAB®. Confidence intervals
for all parameter estimations were calculated using the nlparci function in MATLAB®. For an easier interpretation the relative deviations from the optimal value were calculated as illustrated in the following equation for the upper boundaries of the confidence intervals:
(5)
Relative deviations for the lower boundaries were calculated accordingly.
A systematic model discrimination of all tested models has been performed using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). This criterion prevents over parametrization by punishing models with extensive numbers of parameters. For a more convenient interpretation of the results the AIC values have been used to calculate Akaike weights
, which range between 0 % and 100 % for each model [37].
3. Theory
3.1. Reaction network, reaction kinetics and reactor model
The reaction network of the dehydrogenation, as described in the introduction, consists of 5 reactions, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The corresponding stochiometric matrix is presented in the supporting Information (eq. S1).
All reactions of this main reaction network are described by a power law approach (Eq. (6)–(9)). The kinetic equations have been parametrized in a previous publication [18] and have been summarized in the SI. The water gas shift reaction (WGS, R5) has not been considered since previous studies revealed no significant influence of the reaction under the tested conditions.
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)
Coking of the catalyst is described by a MMCGM, which has been derived and extended for the catalyst used. The complete description of that procedure can be found in literature [18]. Model reduction lead to the following kinetic equation
(10)
The optimized kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 2.
In this contribution it was assumed that only propene contributes as the main precursor to the built-up of coke on the catalyst, which is in accordance with the literature [1].
Besides the production phase which is suffering from gradual catalyst deactivation, also the regeneration phase has been simulated. The oxidation of the coke deposits was assumed to be the only reaction during this phase. For that reason, only mass balances for oxygen and coke were solved. At the beginning of the regeneration phase the reactor was exclusively filled with nitrogen. The coke burning kinetics were described by a power law approach. This approach and the parameters estimated are discussed in more detail in a previous publication [18].
For reactor simulations a 1D-PFTR reactor model was assumed which can be described by the following mass balance equations
(11)
All numerical computations for this contribution have been realized using MATLAB®. The reactor models were solved using either the ode45 solver for stationary models or, after space discretization (Finite-Volume-Method), the ode15s solver for time-dependent deactivation models. The specific models for the different deactivation approaches are described in the upcoming chapter in more detail.
3.2. Deactivation models
Literature offers numerous different approaches for the mathematical description of catalyst deactivation. This contribution focusses on an approach introduced by Janssens and an approach that connects coke loading of the catalyst with catalyst activity by Dumez and Froment [20,21] as discussed in the following.
3.2.1. Janssens approach
The Janssens approach is based on the idea that the amount of active catalyst decreases temporally as a function of conversion of the reactor [21]. A loss in active catalyst mass is equivalent to a shortening of the catalyst bed as illustrated in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. Schematic representation of the decrease of the catalyst length as modeled by the Janssens approach [21]
The original approach of Janssens is the following
(12)
In this equation
represents the activity parameter of this specific approach, which is not identical with the activity coefficients used for example in the approaches by Dumez and Froment [20]. By introducing the weight hourly space velocity
and with the assumption of a constant volumetric flow rate Eq. (12) can be rearranged to
(13)
which shows, that a shortening of the catalyst bed is equivalent to change in WHSV, meaning an increase in volumetric flow or gas velocity, respectively.
Expressing the mass of active catalyst with the catalyst bed density (
) allows to rearrange Eq. (13) to
(14)
This reveals that the original approach is equivalent to a gradual shortening of the catalyst bed.
Combining eq (14) with the 1D-PFTR balance equation (eq (11)) gives
(15)
which is the reactor model equation, that is used for the calculations in this contribution. To further generalize the approach, the term
of equation (14) has been replaced by an arbitrary function of the conversion X which gives
(16)
Furthermore, a temperature dependence has been introduced that follows the Arrhenius approach:
(17)
According to Eq. (15) the general form of the Janssens approach is
(18)
The functions of X and extensions of the empirical Janssens approach that have been tested for this contribution are summarized in Table 3.
For model J1 the original Janssens approach was extended with the temperature dependency to account for the different reaction temperatures. Model J2 contains an additional exponent
as a new free parameter for the parameter estimation. For model J3 a regeneration term was added, that depends on the amount of oxygen introduced in the reaction system. For being able to describe more extensive data sets, that contain more than one propane concentration, the propane inlet concentration has been multiplied to the deactivation term.
For simulation studies performed it was assumed that the deactivation starts after reaching the steady state. The stationary values from the steady state model described by
(22)
were used as starting values in Eq. (19).
3.2.2. Dumez and Froment approach
In analogy to the Janssens approach the deactivation in this model applies the results of a steady state simulation without deactivation as starting points. For that reason, Eq. (11) was used to simulate the reactor for a reaction time of 2 s, which is sufficient to develop steady state concentration profiles for the conditions considered. The PDE has been solved with a Finite-Volume-Method. Therefore, the length of the reactor was divided into
segments. After discretization a conventional ODE solver (MATLAB®: ode45) was used.
Deactivation of the catalyst was considered after the initial period. To describe the decay in activity the deactivation coefficient holds
(23)
The development of
over time on stream is shown as an example in Fig. 1 (A). Introducing the activity coefficient leads to a modified reactor model for the production/deactivation phase:
(24)
In addition to the gaseous components the deposition of carbon has been described by Eq. (10). Since the coking of the catalyst is much slower than the other reactions it was assumed that the proportion of propene consumed by coking can be neglected in the mass balance of propene.
Based on the calculated coke loading the current activity of the catalyst was calculated using the equations summarized in Table 4 to provide a relation between coke loading and activity.
Model structure DF1 – DF3 are directly taken from literature [20]. Model DF3 was further extended by introducing an additional exponent. The extended model is designated as DF4.
It is known from previous studies and in accordance to literature, that not all chemical reactions in the reaction network show deactivation to the same extent [1]. Since the WGS reaction (R5) has a neglectable influence according to previous studies, the reaction was not considered for deactivation. In the same way the ODH reaction was ruled out and a loss of activity was not considered for that reaction [18]. The decay in activity for the remaining reactions (R1, R3, R4) was described by individual activity coefficients
. The free parameters
and
were estimated using the procedure described.
With this approach it is possible to obtain spatial coke and activity profiles as a function of the reaction time.
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Experimental results
To illustrate the reactor performance conversion
, selectivity
and yield
have been used as performance parameters.
(29)
(30)
(31)
The selectivity in this contribution (Eq. (30)) is defined using the number of carbon atoms of the respective product in relation to the number of carbon atoms of all products (see Supporting Information (SI) Eq. S2– S4,).
The experiments show that the operational parameters have a significant influence on the deactivation rate of the catalyst. Fig. 4 reveals, that an operation of the reactor without any oxygen and at a temperature of 600°C leads to a severe drop in conversion (Exp. (2)) whereas at 550°C and an oxygen concentration of 0.75 % the conversion does not decrease (Exp. (1)). At both temperatures the selectivity of the main product propene and the side products CO2 and CO do not decrease. With constant selectivity the yields of the different components follow the form of the conversion and decrease in the experiments at 600°C and without oxygen. The yield in presence of oxygen does not decrease.

The results of all deactivation experiments performed can be found in the supporting information (Figure S1 - S3).
4.2. Janssens approach for deactivation
Based on the experimental results, the models following Janssens approach were fitted and the free parameters were estimated. The different approaches J1 – J3 (Table 3) described the deactivation behavior with different precision. The models J1 and J2 were not able to describe the curvature of the measured data as depicted in Figure S4 – S5 in the supporting information. The reason for that is the structure of the applied models. Due to that structure all assessment parameters ultimately go to zero. To be able to describe a residual activity, model J3 was developed and fitted. A comparison of the models J1 – J3 is given in Table 5.
According to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) J3 fits the experimental data best regardless of the higher number of free parameters. The optimized model parameters for model J3 are summarized in Table 6.
Fig. 5 illustrates the agreement between the curvature of the experimental data and the fitted model J3. A significant difference between the conversion at
at experiment (1) stands out. This deviation can be traced back to the literature model for the main and side reactions, which has been fitted to a wide range of experimental conditions (
,
,
). This large parameter space results in a bigger deviation between experiments and simulations for some specific experimental conditions. Generally, experiments without any oxygen at the reactor inlet are described with less accuracy. The scaling of the evaluation parameters according to Eqs. (3)–(4) was carried out to ensure that the simulations accurately describe the shape of the experimental curves despite the absolute differences.

Finally, the parameter estimation shows, that a description of the deactivation behavior with an approach by Janssens is possible. The computational effort to make estimations based on these models is reasonable and the approach is feasible for reactions conducted in plug flow reactors. The main disadvantage is the lack of physio-chemical insights regarding coke loading and activity. It has to be mentioned, that the model used in this contribution could have been simplified for this specific experimental data set. The aim of this study was rather to introduce a versatile model structure than to tailor a model for the specific reaction network.
4.3. Dumez and Froment approach for deactivation
Besides the general approach introduced by Janssens a more complex microkinetic model structure following a concept used by Dumez and Froment among others has been deployed. The model considers the coke built-up and connects the activity via Eqs. (25)–(28) (Table 4). Parameters for all model structures have been estimated and have been compared using Akaikes Information Criterion (AIC), which allows a systematic model discrimination. The results of the model discrimination are summarized in Table 7.
The approach using model structure DF4 offers the smallest value for the residual sum of squares. Due to the additional parameters
the model has 6 free parameters that can be adjusted to minimize the OF whereas the other models have only 3. However, the strong improvement of the OF justifies these additional parameters, which is illustrated by the AIC values. The optimal parameters of model DF4 are presented in Table 8.
Fig. 6 illustrates the average coke loading and the mean activities over time for the experiments (2), (4), (6) and (8) (
,
). All values have been averaged over the length of the reactor. The graphs reveal a shortcoming of the modeling approach. According to Eq. (10) the coke built-up depends solely on the propene concentration. This leads to counterintuitive coke profiles since the simulation predicts more coke built-up up in oxygen rich conditions. This is in contrast to experimental results and experience in industry, where more oxygen leads to less severe coking of the catalyst and a more pronounced deactivation behavior is visible without oxygen.

Based on these results, a functional relationship between overall propene concentration and catalyst coking seems to be an oversimplification. Thus, in the following section the model is modified to be able to describe the real coking behavior of the catalyst more precisely.
4.3.1. Qualitative description of the coke formation
As presented in Fig. 7, only moderate coke formation is expected as long as oxygen is present in the reactor. To suppress unwanted consecutive reactions, the oxygen concentrations in the experiments and the simulations respectively have been kept relatively low. Under such condition oxygen will not penetrate to the end of the reactor. Parts of the reactor without oxygen show more coking than parts with oxygen. The current simple model structure does not represent this behavior properly.

To improve the model, further attempts were made to link the coking process to the DDH reaction. In order to keep the original model structure, a distinction was made between propene produced in the DDH reaction and propene produced via ODH. This assumption is based on the fact that during ODH, coking is almost absent whereas in DDH the catalyst shows fast coking. This separation has to be reflected in the stochiometric matrix. A modified version of the stochiometric matrix is presented in Eq. S5 (SI). Due to this modification, the kinetic equation for the coke forming reaction changes. For the following models, the coke formation is described by Eq. (32).
(32)
Besides the coke forming reaction, other reactions due not distinguish between propene species. For that reason, weighting factors
and
Eq. (33)–((34) have been introduced. The subsequent reactions consume these pseudo species in two specific proportion.
(33)
(34)
To assure that mass balances are fulfilled, the weighting factors add up to 1 and the concentration of both pseudo propene species add up to the total amount of propene.
(35)
(36)
The reactions affected by these changes are the partial and the total oxidation of propene (R3, R4). After introducing the weighting factors, Eqs. (8) and (9) are modified and can be described by Eqs. (37) and (38).
(37)
(38)
In analogy to the analysis performed before, all model structures have been tested again to find the model that describes the measured data with the closest agreement. The AIC values summarized in Table 9 reveal, that model structure DF1 shows better results than structure DF4, which was superior before the modification.
Resulting from the model structure, the number of free parameters has been reduced to 3, which are presented in Table 10.
Fig. 8 illustrates the calculated coke and activity profiles of model DF1 DDH for the experiments (2), (4), (6) and (8) (Table 1). For this model the amount of coke decreases with increasing oxygen concentration, which has been observed in experiments.

On the one hand, due to the distinction between two propene species the coking profiles qualitatively match the experimental results. On the other hand, a discrepancy between the experimentally measured coke profiles and the simulated coking profiles can be observed. Due to these shortcomings, the rate constant of the coking kinetics has been adapted in this contribution. In that way it was possible to maintain the original model structure that proved to fit the experimental data satisfyingly.
4.3.2. Quantitative description of coke formation
In the experiments conducted in a tubular lab scale reactor it was possible to split the catalyst bed into three separate segments. The segments were separated with quartz wool as described in a previous publication [18]. This separation allowed to take catalyst samples of the individual segments and to obtain average values of coke loading in these segments.
In addition to concentrations and evaluation variables, the coke loadings in three separate reactor sections were evaluated in the experiment (2), (4), (6) and (8). The average coke loading of the 3 reactor segments has been measured according to the procedure explained in [18]. Fig. 9 (A) illustrates the segmentation of the reactor with increasing coke depositions over reactor length based on the increasing concentration of formed propene as coke precursor.

The coke loading as additional information allowed to extent the OF as presented in Eq. (39). A weighting factor of 100 is multiplied to the squared differences of the coke loading to enhance the effect on the objective function. This weighting factor is necessary to account for the larger number of values for the key parameters (
,
) in comparison to the lower number of values for the coke loading (
).
(39)
The parameter estimation was conducted following the procedure described above. Fig. 9 (B) shows the measured coke loadings and the simulated values. The modified model including an adjusted rate constant of the coke built-up is denoted as DF1* DDH. The new model is able to describe the average coke loading and the development of coke deposition over length of the reactor for the experiments with good agreement. The unmodified model underestimates the coke loading for all experiments.
Fig. 10 reveals that the calculated performance parameters are in good agreement with the measured values. The model parameters are given in Table 11. All values of
are remarkably smaller than in the previous models. This is caused by the adjusted rate constant of coking which leads to more coking in model DF1* DDH. To keep the activity loss the same, lower values of
are necessary.

To compare model DF1* DDH to model DF1 DDH, the OF described in Eq. (3) has been calculated with the performance parameters of model DF1* DDH. This provides a basis for comparing both models. The value of the OF for model DF1* DDH is 14.13 whereas for model DF1 DDH it is 10.70. That illustrates that the former model DF1 DDH without modified coking kinetics is more accurate in predicting the change in activity than the modified model. The reason for that is the additional term of the OF that has been considered in model DF1* DDH. The decline in precision is acceptable, since a more accurate knowledge of the coke loading provides useful insights with respect to catalyst regeneration.
Fig. 11 illustrates the advantage of the applied modeling approach. It is possible to calculate coke and activity profiles with temporal and spatial resolution. Fig. 11 presents the results for Exp. (1) and (2) and shows activity

Fig. 11. Spatially and temporally resolved coke profiles (A and B) and activity profiles (C and D) for experiment (1) and (2)
A significant difference between the simulation results of Exp. (1) and (2) illustrated in Fig. 11 is the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst surface. At higher temperatures and without oxygen (Exp. (2), Fig. 11 (B)) the amount of coke is higher compared to lower temperatures and small amounts of oxygen (Exp. (2), Fig. 11 (A)). For Exp. (1) it is clearly visible where the oxygen is depleted in the reactor. After the oxygen has been completely consumed, there is a significant increase in coke formation (Fig. 11A). This transition can also be observed in the activity curves (Fig. 11 (C)-(D)), where the activities decrease faster after all oxygen has been consumed.
Due to the spatial resolution of the profiles it is possible to transfer the model to more complex reactor geometries. A 2D simulation would be possible. The calculated coking profiles are used in the next section to simulate the regeneration phase of the reactor. This allows the simulation of both production and regeneration phases and a cyclic reactor operation. In that way an optimization of the whole process is possible.
4.4. Analysis and optimization of the overall production cycle
Based on the model DF1* DDH for catalyst deactivation derived in the previous sections and the coke burning kinetics known from previous work [18], it is possible to simulate the whole production cycle including production and regeneration phases as introduced in Fig. 1. An overview of the kinetic parameters and the power law approach to describe the coke burning kinetics is given in the SI.
At first, different oxygen concentrations during production phase have been tested at
and
to find the most advantageous production conditions (see Fig. 12). The catalyst has been deactivated in a production phase of a certain length. Afterwards the complete activity has been restored by a regeneration phase at 500 °C and 1 % oxygen. The regeneration time was not fixed but defined as a function of the coke loading of the catalyst.

In all simulations after the production phase and regeneration phase an additional
purging phase,
, was included to avoid explosive mixtures of oxygen and remaining reactants or products of the reaction with respect to the experimental realization. This time can also be interpreted as the time needed to reduce the temperature from production level to the regeneration level. The length of the purging phase was not varied in this contribution but has of course influence on the total process optimization.
For analysis and evaluation of the total process including deactivation and regeneration the space time yield (STY) of the reactor has been calculated via Eq. (40).
(40)
This performance parameter includes the times for production as well as regeneration and purging. In that way it provides information about the productivity of the whole production cycle and is suitable to assess the performance of the overall production cycle.
Fig. 12 sums up the results of the simulation under different production conditions and shows, that small amounts of oxygen during the production phase are beneficial for the reactor performance. It is worth to mention that only some production conditions show a maximum in space time yield. Without any oxygen present, the optimal production time at a production temperature of
is around 8 h. That results in a regeneration time of
. The optimal production time at
is
which results in a regeneration time of
. It is clearly visible that higher temperatures lead to more severe coking and therefore demand a more frequent catalyst regeneration.
In addition to production times and production conditions it is possible to further optimize the regeneration conditions (Fig. 13). To study the influence of regeneration temperature and oxygen concentration during regeneration both has been varied. The results reveal that higher oxygen concentrations and higher temperatures during regeneration increase the space time yield. Whether it is suitable to choose a high temperature and a high oxygen concentration cannot be decided based on these calculations since enthalpies of reaction are not considered. A regeneration temperature close to the production temperature can reduce the time needed to cool down and heat up the reactor after the respective phase which can result in shorter purging phases.
Besides a complete catalyst regeneration, it could be more advantageous to regenerate the catalyst up to a certain activity level and start the next production phase with a partially coked catalyst in order to optimize the total process as initially illustrated in Fig. 1. The regeneration model leads to the conclusion that the reaction rate decreases with continued consumption of coke. In that way burning the last bits of coke takes longer in comparison to regeneration of a strongly coked catalyst. To study the effect of partially regenerated catalyst an optimization algorithm was applied to the simulations and optimal activities at the beginning and at the end of the reaction cycle have been estimated. Four complete production cycles including production and regeneration have been simulated. Optimized lower and upper boundaries have been calculated with respect to the averaged activity of Reaction R1
. The activity
has been averaged over the whole length of the reactor.
The average space time yield of cycle 2 to 4 has been considered for comparison because the simulations revealed, that the differences between the cycles 2 – 4 are insignificant (see Figure S8, Supporting Information). The first cycle differs from all following cycles since it starts with fresh catalyst. All other cycles start with the activity and coke profiles of the previous cycle. The results of the optimization for a production temperature of 550 °C and an inlet concentration of 1 % propane during the production phase are presented in Fig. 14. The optimal points outperform the cases where complete regeneration of the catalyst was assumed.

Fig. 15 gives further inside how the coke loading and the activity
change over the course of the optimized process. Fig. 15 (1) depicts the mean coke loading as well as the coke loading at the end of the reactor. As known from the experimental results (Fig. 9) the coke loading increases towards the end of the reactor, which results in a higher coke loading at the reactor outlet than in average. The average coke content of the catalyst shows no significant differences throughout the different production cycles but the coke content at the end of the reactor indicates that the profiles in the reactor differ between the first and the upcoming cycles. The same can be observed for the activity (Fig. 15 (2)). This is caused by the coke content that remains on the catalyst after the incomplete regeneration. More detailed information on the coking profiles is presented in Fig. 16 (1) which offers the coke profiles in the reactor at the end of the production phase and at the end of the regeneration phase respectively. The changes of the coke and activity profiles in the cycles 2, 3 and 4 do not differ significantly. In comparison to that, cycle 1 shows less coking at the end of the reactor. The effect of coke accumulation at the reactor outlet due to incomplete regeneration is clearly visible.

5. Conclusions
In this contribution models for the catalyst deactivation based on a general approach introduced by Janssens and a more complex microkinetic approach by Dumez and Froment were utilized to simulate the activity and deactivation behavior of a VOx catalyst during propane dehydrogenation.
It was possible to show that, based on the models Janssens developed e.g. for MTO reactions, a transfer of the model structure to dehydrogenation reaction networks is possible. Several modifications of the model have been executed to meet the needs of the reaction system. This was successful without compromising the simple and efficient principle of the model structure. The results of the simulations where in good agreement with the experimental data observed for the ODH and DDH of propane. Furthermore, the approach by Froment and Dumez was applied and analyzed. Various correlations between coke loading and catalyst activity were investigated and compared in a systematic model discrimination. The final model revealed a good agreement between experimental and simulated data for various operation parameters. It can be concluded, that both approaches are able to describe the deactivation behavior. They are suitable for different areas of application due to the different advantages and disadvantages of the models. The model presented by Janssens convinces with its simple structure. The disadvantage of Janssens approach is that no knowledge can be gained about the coking inside the reactor. This means that it is not possible to evaluate the overall process, since regeneration cannot be simulated directly without further refinement of the model. In contrast, the more complex model according to Dumez and Froment contains temporally and spatially resolved activity and coking profiles. These permit a transfer to more complex geometries and reactor configurations. Due to the more complex structure, calculations are more time-consuming. It could be shown that this model is suitable for an optimization of the performance of the overall process. This has been realized by optimizing the activities at the beginning and the end of the production cycle, hence an incomplete regeneration of the catalyst. This strategy results in shorter regeneration times and a better space time yield of the overall process.
Consequently, this contribution provides models and parameters as a basis for the design and intensification of cyclically operating deactivation and regeneration processes involving catalyst coking. This makes it possible to evaluate more complex reactor geometries, established production processes (Catofin, Oleflex, ...) for the conversion of propane to propene, innovative reactor concepts, e.g. membrane reactors, and advanced regeneration strategies.
Finally, it can be stated that a significant process intensification can be reached by carefully tuning the production and regeneration times of the overall process. Taking the regeneration into account and choosing adequate termination criteria for the respective phases can lead to more efficient processes and superior performance in comparison to a process where a complete regeneration is conducted.
