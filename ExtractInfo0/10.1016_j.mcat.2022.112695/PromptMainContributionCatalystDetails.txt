Abstract
In the present study, the catalytic performance of Pt nanoparticles in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) over two different supports (Commercial Al2O3 and MgAl2O4) was evaluated using experimental methods combined with Machine Learning. Different characterization techniques, including HAADF-STEM, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, C3H6-TPD, XPS, BET, CO-chemisorption, CO-DRIFT, and TPO, were used to unravel the correlation between catalytic performance of the Pt nanoparticles with the promoter and the supports employed during PDH. Firstly, experimental analyses indicate that Ge modifies the geometric and electronic properties of Pt as the active metal in the reaction. Moreover, using MgAl2O4 instead of commercial Al2O3 support boosted the performance of Pt-Ge nanoparticles due to its anti-sintering nature and fewer acidic centers. Finally, the influence of operation conditions on the reaction rate of the best sample was investigated with machine learning. The gradient boosting tree model was employed to learn from relevant variables, including temperature, partial pressure of propane, and partial pressure of hydrogen and propylene in the feed. The results reveal the importance of the parameters on the reaction rate as Temperature > P(C3H8) > P(C3H6) > P(H2). Even though hydrogen has the least effect on the reaction rate, it is essential to co-feed hydrogen to suppress coke formation in PDH.

Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, used for producing a wide variety of products [1], [2], [3], [4]. Due to this widespread application, there is a growing gap between demand and supply [5,6]. Among all the available methods for propylene production, direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has the highest yield [7]. This reaction is an equilibrium-limited and endothermic reaction which normally happens at a temperature over 450 °C on CrOx-based or Pt-based catalysis [8], [9], [10]. CrOx-based catalysts deactivate rapidly in the reaction environment and must be frequently regenerated [11]. Even with regeneration, the activity of the catalysts does not fully recover [12]. Besides, the toxicity of CrOx species discourages further study and development of this cohort of catalysts for the PDH reaction. Pt-based catalysts are the alternative choice due to being more active than CrOx-based ones in the PDH reaction; however, they suffer from deactivation due to sintering and coke formation [13,14]. Modifying the properties of Pt as the active site in the reaction and modifying the support properties are two adopted strategies to improve the performance of Pt-based catalysts in PDH. Promoters, including Cu, Sn, Au, Ag, Mn, Sb, etc. have been widely used to change the Pt properties [8,[15], [16], [17]]. In the structure of monometallic Pt, many coordinately unsaturated sites are active for C-C bond cleavage, resulting in hydrogenolysis, side reactions, and coke formation. Adding promoters modifies these sites in the structure of Pt, inducing geometric or electronic modification on Pt and making it more robust and resistive against coke formation and sintering [18].
As mentioned above, optimizing support materials can also affect the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts [19]. Structure properties of the support, acidic centers, and interaction of the metal with support are parameters that affect the catalytic performance. Shi et al. reported that unsaturated pentacoordinated Al3+ centers in the support could enhance the interaction of metal clusters (Pt-Sn) with support, resulting in much better durability than conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst [20]. Long et al. modified Al2O3 with Ca and used it in PDH reaction [21]. The reported Ca decreases the acidity of the catalysts, increases Pt dispersion, and prevents Pt sintering. Ren et al. prepared highly stable and active Pt-Cu, Pt-Ag, and Pt-Au catalysts for PDH reaction using anti-sinter MgAl2O4 support [22], which enhanced the interaction with Pt and prevented its aggregation even after successive usages and several regenerations [23]. It was previously demonstrated that adding Ge to Pt can improve Pt catalytic performance for PDH reaction [18]. Moreover, modifying support with Ca proved the catalyst can become even more stable in long time-on-stream (TOS) [7]. However, the observed weakened Pt-Ge interaction with support could be the main drawback of this catalyst for commercialization. Using MgAl2O4 as an anti-sinter support may resolve the problems of Ca-modified Al2O3 support. Furthermore, it was observed that operation conditions, including temperature and feed composition, are very important for the PDH reaction. Nevertheless, the degree of importance has not been studied yet due to the system's complexity. The use of machine learning can be very helpful in understanding this kind of complex system though.
Machine learning (ML) has been introduced as an important data-driven approach in chemical engineering and catalysis due to the complex nature of many systems in this field. ML is a powerful computational approach that learns and finds patterns in the data to develop models by relying on historical data instead of sophisticated rule-based methods [24]. The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with many open-source libraries and algorithms has also made ML more efficient and robust. ML methods can be generally categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning [25]. In supervised learning (used in this study), a set of data that compose input variables (known as features in ML) and output variables (known as labels) are fed to the models to find an existing and meaningful relationship between them. Different models and algorithms have been developed for the supervised learning [25]. Tree-based models are relatively simple but interpretable and powerful models of the supervised learning. Different kinds of tree-based models, including Random Forest (RF) regressor, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), and XGBoost, can be used to predict the reaction rate of PDH [26]. The random forest model is quite easy to train and use; however, the accuracy of this model may not be satisfactory. By reiterating the regression tree and minimizing the loss function in each iteration by reducing the error in weak learners, boosting methods can solve the problem of the RF model [27].
Regarding Pt-Ge nanoparticles’ remaining problem over Ca-modified Al2O3 and the importance of operation condition over reaction rate in PDH, we first proved that the use of MgAl2O4 as anti-sintering support can increase the interaction of Pt-Ge nanoparticles with support in addition to decreasing coke formation. Then, the reaction data were gathered in different operation conditions and fed into a gradient boosting ML model to investigate the importance of different parameters on the reaction rate (Scheme 1). This model was selected as it is simple yet interpretable and powerful. ML-based interpretation and accurate prediction of the model used in this study can help to further optimize the operation condition of PDH and may provide engineering guidelines for further development and even expand the method and approach to other chemical reactions.

Experimental
Catalyst Preparation
Samples were prepared with the incipient wetness co-impregnation method using hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6, sigma-Aldrich, ∼ 38 % Pt basis) and germanium chloride (GeCl4 Alfa Aesar, > 99.9 %) as precursors. The required amount of precursors were dissolved in ethanol and was impregnated into the support to ensure 1%wt Pt and 2%wt Ge loading. After metal loadings, the catalyst was dried at 120 °C overnight and calcined at 550 °C for 3 h. Finally, the catalyst was reduced at 700 °C under 20% H2/N2 for 1 h. Two different supports were used in this study. A commercial Al2O3 and MgAl2O4 was prepared with the hydrolysis of aluminum isopropoxide with magnesium nitrate hexahydrate in ethanol according to the reported methods in the literature [23].
Catalyst Characterization
Samples’ morphology, crystalline size of nanoparticles, and nanoparticles’ chemical composition within the samples were investigated by high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM).
Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained in a Micromeritic ASAP 2420 apparatus and were used to derive the specific surface area of the catalysts. Samples were degassed overnight at 200 °C before the analysis.
The amount of Pt loading on the samples was obtained with ICP-OES. Under microwave digestion, 50 mg catalyst was dissolved in a concentrated sulfuric and phosphoric acid with a 1:1 ratio. Then, water was added to dilute the solution about 400 times. After dilution, the solution was heated to 200 °C and kept at this temperature for 0.5 h.
Metallic surface area and dispersion of the samples were obtained with CO chemisorption. Fifty mg sample was reduced at 700 °C for 1 h under 20% H2/N2 with a 50 ml/min flow rate. After reduction to 300 °C, samples were flushed and evacuated for 0.5 h, and the temperature was decreased to 30 °C for analysis. Pt: CO ratio was 1:1, and obtained percentages of Pt from ICP were used in the analysis.
Hydrogen Temperature Reduction (H2-TPR) profiles of the samples were carried out in a TPDRO 1100 system with a thermal conductivity detector. One hundred mg catalysts were degassed at 50 °C for 0.5 h under helium; then, the temperature was ramped up under 5%H2/95 % He with a flow rate of 50 ml/min up to 900 °C.
IR spectra were measured in a Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) using a Bruker EQUINOX 55 spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector. Samples were placed in the cell and reduced at 700 °C for 1 h under 20% H2/He with a 50 ml/min flow rate. The background was collected at room temperature (r.t.) under He, and samples were saturated with 1% CO/He or 2% C3H6/He for 1 h. Physically adsorbed molecules were removed with flushing with He, and spectra were measured under He.
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a Thermofisher ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with a monochromatized Al Ka X-ray source (1486.6 eV) and a power of 150 W. C1s binding energy 284.8 eV was used as the standard to correct the binding energies.
NH3-TPD was used to study the acidic properties of the samples. 100 mg sample was loaded to the apparatus and degassed at 50 °C for 0.5 h. Then the temperature was ramped up to 700 °C, where catalysts were reduced under 20%H2/N2 for 1 h. After reduction, the temperature was decreased to 100 °C, where after stabilization and degassing for 0.5 h, it was saturated with 10% NH3 (50 ml/min) for 1 h. After saturation, samples were degassed for 1 h with He and TPD profiles were recorded from 100 °C-800 °C under He with a 50 ml/min flow rate. Deconvolution of the peaks was carried out by a Gaussian method.
C3H6-TPD was carried out to study the interaction between propylene and catalysts. 150 mg sample was reduced at 700 °C for 1 h under 20%H2/N2. After reduction, the temperature was decreased to room temperature, and the sample was flushed for 1 h. Then, the sample was saturated with C3H6 for 1 h and flushed for 0.5 h to remove physically adsorbed C3H6. C3H6-TPD spectra were recorded from room temperature to 500 °C with a 5 °C/min ramping rate.
The amount of formed coke on the spent samples was analyzed with the Temperature-Programmed Oxidation (TPO) method. Around 100 mg spent sample was treated under He at 200 °C for 1 h. The temperature was decreased to 100 °C and stabilized for 10 min. Then, the temperature was increased from 100 °C to 800 °C under air with a flow rate of 30 ml/min. Online MS measured CO2 in the outlet stream.
Catalytic Test
A fixed-bed quartz tube reactor with an inner diameter of 6 mm and a length of 500 mm was used for the reactions. Around 200 mg (or 50 mg for ML studies) samples diluted with SiC were loaded into the reactor and held by quartz wool. The temperature was increased with the ramping rate of 10 °C/min to 700 °C where the catalyst was reduced under 20%H2/N2 for 1 h. Then, the temperature decreased to the proper reaction one (600 °C for the initial study, between 450 °C-500 °C for ML studies) and flushed with N2 for 15 min before the reaction. After temperature stabilization, the feed was introduced to the reactor. For initial studies, feed composition was as C3H8: 10 ml/min, H2: 10 ml/min, Ar: 4 ml/min balanced with N2, and a total flow rate of 80 ml/min and atmospheric pressure. For ML studies, partial pressure of C3H8, C3H6, and H2 in feed varied between 1-50 kPa. Argon was used as the internal standard in the reaction, and the following equations were used in the calculations to have accurate carbon balance and reaction data [18]:

Results and Discussion
Characterizations
Textural and Morphological Properties
HAADF-STEM images of the reduced samples are indicated in Fig. 1. In this figure, fine metal nanoparticle formation for both monometallic and bimetallic samples can be observed. The average particle size for Pt1/Al2O3, Pt1/MgAl2O4, Pt1-Ge2/Al2O3, and Pt1-Ge2/MgAl2O4 are 2.19 ± 0.39, of 1.97 ± 0.44, of 2.57 ± 0.47 and of 2.44 ± 0.40 nm, respectively. As inferred, changing support from Al2O3 to MgAl2O4 results in smaller particle sizes. The smaller particle size on the MgAl2O4 support may originate from its anti-sintering nature and capability to trap small nanoparticles [23]. Likewise, Ren et al. observed that altering support from Al2O3 to Mg-modified Al2O3 could result in small particle sizes and sinter resistant catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, which can retain its activity under successive reaction and regeneration processes in contrast to Al2O3 on which metals sinter rapidly [22]. They suggested this feature is due to the capability of MgAl2O4 in stabilizing Pt nanoparticles. Accordingly, smaller particle size on MgAl2O4 support originates from its feature in trapping metal nanoparticles and making strong metal-support interaction. The existence of highly dispersed and uniform particle sizes in the same range suggests that adding Ge does not much affect particle sizes [18].

Textural properties of the bare supports and the ones loaded with Pt and PtGe metals are shown in Table 1. After adding Mg, Pt, and Ge to the support, BET surface area has been slightly decreased, suggesting pore's blockage of the support by these metals [28]. Likewise, it is evident from the table that Pt dispersion and metal surface area have also tangible disparities among all cases. The metal surface area and dispersion for bimetallic samples are lower than for monometallic ones. Adding an inert promoter to a noble metal can decrease its dispersion and metallic surface area due to the geometric effects on the noble metal induced by the promoter [29,30]. Indeed, the decrease in the dispersion and metallic surface area of Pt is due to the geometric modification of Pt by Ge [7], suggesting strong interaction between Pt and Ge. This interaction will be further investigated in the next sections.

Temperature Program Reduction (H2-TPR) of the Samples
H2-TPR profiles were used to investigate the reducibility of the samples, and the results are depicted in Fig. 2. For monometallic samples, there are two peaks at a temperature less than 500 °C related to the reduction of PtOCl2 and Pt species that interact with the support [31,32]. These peaks are slightly higher for Pt1/MgAl2O4 due to the strong interaction of Pt with MgAl2O4 support. This strong interaction impedes the ease of Pt reducibility, hence the reduction peaks shift to higher temperatures [22]. Upon adding Ge, one more peak appears at a higher temperature that is related to the reduction of GeOx species. Moreover, after Ge addition, the peaks belonging to the Pt reduction slightly moves to a higher temperature, suggesting the existence of a Pt-Ge interaction in the bimetallic samples. Spillover of H dissociated by Pt to nearby GeOx promotes the reduction of PtOx species to the higher temperature [33].

Effect of Ge on the Structural Properties and the Chemical State of Pt
CO-DRIFT was used to study the reduced samples’ electronic and geometric properties, and the results are depicted in Fig. 3a. In the monometallic samples’ spectra, two peaks appear around 1800 cm−1 and 2050 cm−1 related to the adsorption of bridge bonded and linear bonded CO on the Pt surface, respectively [34]. For Pt1/MgAl2O4, these peaks appear slightly at a lower wavenumber than Pt1/Al2O3, which can be due to the electron transfer from Mg to Pt, resulting in higher electron density around Pt [22]. The higher electron density around Pt increases electron back donation into the 2p* orbital of CO, which decreases the ν(CO) frequency of the C-O bond [22,29]. It is also worth mentioning that the lower wavenumber peaks ascribed to bridge-bonded CO, have appeared for monometallic samples, suggesting Mg does not induce geometric effects. Upon adding Ge, the emerged peak at lower wavenumber has disappeared, suggesting Ge has induced geometric effects on Pt. Indeed, Ge breaks ensembles of Pt and makes a surface alloy with Pt. Besides this geometric modification of Pt by Ge, there is a redshift in the spectra after introducing Ge to the samples. This redshift is due to the electronic effects of Ge that quenches the unpaired electrons in the metal clusters [35].

Fig. 3. (a) CO-DRIFT of the samples, and (b) XPS spectra of Pt 4d of the reduced samples.
To further elucidate the electronic effects of support and Ge on Pt, XPS analysis was carried out (Fig. 3b). In the XPS study of Pt, the most intense photoemission line corresponds to the Pt 4f core level; however, it overlaps with Al 2p, which challenges the data analysis. To avoid this challenge, XPS spectra of Pt 4d5/2 of the samples were investigated. Even though the intensity of this peak is not the most intensive one, it does not overlap with any peaks in the samples making the data quite reliable. Pt 4d5/2 spectra of the reduced samples after background subtraction and peak fitting using Shirley's method are depicted in Fig. 3b. In this figure, the binding energy in 314-315 eV is ascribed to the metallic Pt. The other one at higher binding energy 317.5-318.5 eV is then related to PtOx species [36,37]. All the reduced samples have peaks in the range of metallic Pt. For monometallic samples, the peak for the MgAl2O4 is lower than Al2O3, suggesting electron transfer from support to Pt which is in line with CO-DRIFT results. After adding Ge, the peaks have shifted to higher binding energies highlighting surface alloy formation between Pt and Ge. Due to this alloy formation, Ge withdraws electrons from Pt, and the binding energies shift to higher values which consequently proves the observation in our CO-DRIFT analysis (Fig. 3a).
Study of Propylene Adsorption on the Samples
C3H6-IR and C3H6-TPD were used to study the interaction of propylene (the main product of PDH) with the samples, and the results are depicted in Fig. 4. As C3H6-IR spectra depicted in Fig. 4a, there are two peaks around 1650 cm−1 and 1450 cm−1 which are ascribed to the stretching of ν(C=C) of propylene and νas(C-H) of methyl [29]. Obviously, the intensity of peaks on MgAl2O4 samples is lower than on Al2O3. This can be due to the electron transfer from Mg to Pt, weakening the electronic interaction between Pt and propylene molecules. Upon introducing Ge to the samples, the amount of adsorbed propylene decreased. It has been reported that geometric modification of Pt with Sn results in weaker propylene adsorption on the surface of Pt due to relaxation effects [38]. In contrast, the electronic effects of Sn on Pt were negligible [38]. On the other hand, it was reported that electronic modification of Pt with Cu (Cu donates an electron to Pt) hinders interaction between Pt and C3H6, resulting in facile desorption of C3H6 and a lower amount of adsorbed propylene on Pt-Cu samples [29]. As Ge electronic effects are quite opposite of Cu electronic effects, the lower propylene coverage on the Ge-modified samples is most likely pertained to a geometric effect of Ge on Pt [3]. In Fig. 4b, the interaction of samples with C3H6 was further investigated with C3H6-TPD. In the TPD profiles of the samples, there are two peaks, one appears at a lower temperature of around 100 °C, and one appears at a higher temperature of around 300-400 °C [13]. The former at the lower temperature is ascribed to weakly adsorbed C3H6 on the samples while the latter at the higher temperature is related to strongly adsorbed C3H6. These desorption temperatures indicate the interaction between Pt and propylene. Indeed, the peaks for samples with MgAl2O4 support modified with Ge have displaced to the lower temperature, revealing weak interaction between Pt and C3H6. This finding also agrees well with the C3H6-IR data exhibiting lower coverage of C3H6 on the surfaces of Pt upon adding Ge. The facile desorption of propylene from the surface of metals has been introduced as a key factor in preventing side reactions and improving selectivity in the PDH reaction. This issue will be more investigated in the next sections with catalytic data.

Support Effects
Ammonia TPD (NH3-TPD) was carried out to analyze the samples’ acidic properties, and the results are reported in Fig. 5 and Table S1. After deconvolution of the NH3-TPD curves, three peaks have appeared at temperatures around 195 °C, 250 °C, and 350 °C, related to adsorbed ammonia on the weak, medium, and strong acidic centers [39,40]. The amount of adsorbed NH3 for Pt1/Al2O3, Pt1-Ge2/Al2O3, Pt1/MgAl2O4, Pt1-Ge2/MgAl2O4 are 448.6 µmol/g, 424.2 µmol/g, 196.8 µmol/g, 172.3 µmol/g, respectively. Indeed, after adding Ge and changing support to MgAl2O4, the amount of adsorbed NH3 has decreased, and the ratio of weak+medium acidic centers to strong ones has been increased. The decrease of the acidic intensity after adding Ge is in line with the previous reports, which have indicated upon adding GeOx to the samples the extent of strong acidic centers, which appear at a higher temperature around 400 °C, will be decreased [40,41]. Besides, considering the basicity of Mg metal, the supports containing this metal will have less acidic intensity, which has been clearly observed here.

Strong acidic centers are harmful to the selectivity of catalysts in PDH reactions as they can promote isomerization and coking reactions. Strong acidic centers will adsorb produced products and will instigate them undergoing side reactions, hence decreasing the selectivity. Weaker acidic centers of MgAl2O4 are favorable to facile propylene desorption from the support and catalyst surfaces (Fig. 4), resulting in better catalytic performance.
Catalytic Results
Effects of Ge Loading
The samples’ catalytic performance, including conversion, selectivity, and yield, are depicted in Fig. 6. Conversion of the monometallic samples, regardless of the support, rapidly drops in the reaction environment. This is due to the coordinately unsaturated Pt sites in these samples that are active for C-C bond cleavage, resulting in side reactions and coke formation [34]. The formed coke deposits on the surface of the active sites and deactivated the catalyst with time-on-stream (TOS). Selectivity increases with TOS for these monometallic samples, showing a decrease in the side reactions due to deactivation of active centers of Pt by the generated coke involved in C-C bond cleavage. For Pt1/MgAl2O4, conversion is slightly lower than that of Pt1/Al2O3. This lower conversion can be due to the modified Pt electronic effects induced by Mg. It has been reported that electron transfer to Pt could decrease its activity in the PDH reaction [42]. According to the CO-DRIFT and XPS, electrons have been transferred from support to the Pt in the monometallic samples. Accordingly, the lower activity of Pt1/MgAl2O4 could be related to the support effect. This issue is not valid for bimetallic samples as we have not observed such electronic support effects for the bimetallic samples. Indeed, in bimetallic samples, Ge plays an important role in modifying the electronic and geometric properties of the Pt. However, in these samples, Mg only modifies the acidic properties of the support. In bimetallic samples, there is alloy formation between Pt and Ge, and due to this alloy formation, the geometry and electronic properties of Pt have been modified. This modification has made Pt less active for side reactions and more active and selective to PDH.

It is also worth mentioning that according to the characterizations, the available Ge in the support withdraws electrons from Pt and shifts the d-band center of Pt near the Fermi level which makes Pt more active for C-H bond activation [43]. Moreover, the metallic Ge modifies the Pt ensembles and decreases their activity to the side and undesired reactions. In contrast to Ge, for Sn (the commonly used promoter in the industry), improved selectivity is achieved at the expense of catalytic activity, resulting in lower conversion (Fig. S4) [35].
Amongst the tested samples, it is seen that Pt1-Ge2/MgAl2O4 sample has the best catalytic performance. For all samples, the amount of formed coke will be analyzed in the next section.
Coke Formation
After running the reaction, the amount of formed coke on the samples was analyzed with TPO. The results are depicted in Fig. 7 and Table S2. The amount of formed coke on Pt1/Al2O3, Pt1/MgAl2O4, Pt1-G2/Al2O3, and Pt1-Ge2/MgAl2O4 is 14.1%, 11.8%, 7.7%, and 5.9, respectively. The amount of deposited coke on the samples is in line with the depicted carbon balance in Fig. S1. Using MgAl2O4 as support has resulted in less coke formation. It is also well-known that strong acid sites promote catalyst deactivation by coke deposition [44]. Accordingly, elimination of the acidic sites by Mg introduction to the support structure will promote coke formation resistivity of the catalyst. On the other side, unmodified Pt sites will cause hydrogenations, and formed products will undergo further dehydrogenation, resulting in more coke formation. Indeed, for the Pt1-Ge2/MgAl2O4 in which both acidic centers of the support and properties of Pt have been modified, the formed coke is less than other samples, which quite matches the reported reaction data in the previous section. As this sample shows the best catalytic performance and best coke tolerance, it will be used to study the effects of reaction conditions on the reaction rate via machine learning technique.

Optimizing Reaction Condition with Boosting Methods
As mentioned previously, PDH is an equilibrium-limited reaction that must be done at a high temperature to reach an acceptable reaction rate. The operation condition of the reaction, including reaction temperature and partial pressure of both reactants and products, can affect the reaction rate. To evaluate the significance of these parameters (features) on reaction rate (labels), reactions with different operating conditions were carried out over Pt1-Ge2/MgAl2O4 catalyst. A dataset including 63 data points was gathered. In the data pre-processing step, 80 % of the data was assigned to train the model and nearly 20 % of these data points were set aside for the model testing (Fig. 8), which will be used to evaluate the model accuracy after training. The available train_test_split function in Python's Scikit-learn library was used for the data splitting. The used features have different scales; thus they should be scaled before feeding into the model. This scaling step is one of the important steps of data pre-processing in machine learning. Most machine learning algorithms calculate the distance between data to make a decision. When data are far apart from each other, the accuracy of the models becomes quite poor. Accordingly, it is vital to standardize the data before feeding it to the model. StandardScaler feature of Scikit-learn library of Python was used to standardize the data. StandardScaler removes the mean and scales each feature/variable to unit variance.

Fig. 8. The process of feeding data to gradient boosting model for optimizing reaction rate.
Boosting methods were selected for optimization. Boosting refers to any Ensemble method which can combine a few weak learners into a strong one. The main idea of boosting methods is to train predictors sequentially so that each is trying to correct its predecessor. One of the most famous boosting methods is Gradient Boosting [26]. Similar to other boosting methods, Gradient Boosting works by sequentially adding predictors to an ensemble, each one correcting its predecessor. However, instead of tweaking the instance weight at every iteration like other boosting methods, it tries to fit the new predictor to the residual errors made by the previous predictor [45].
In the gradient boosting model, first, an initial basic function should be formed, which is a single terminal node tree [26]:

∑

In this equation,

The number of iterations is user-defined, and after M iterations, the final model will be
F
M

. The number of boosting stages, max depth of tree,
α
, and learning rate which controls models changes in each iteration are hyperprameters of the model which should be tuned. For hyper parameter tuning grid search with 5-fold cross validation was used (Fig. 8). Moreover, root mean squared error (RMSE) which defined as follows was used to evaluate the ML model [26]:
(11)

where N is the number of points,
y

is the real values and
y
^

is the output predicted by the model.
After the model was trained, the predicted rates by the model were compared with the real one in the test set, and the results are depicted in Fig. 9. Indeed, the model is quite accurate in predicting the rate. RMSE for the train and test set was 0.26 mol/(g. h) and 0.37 mol/(g. h). These values show overfitting has not happened. In machine learning, overfitting happens when the model learns noise in data and can predict very well on train data but very poorly on the test set. It is also worth mentioning that the average reaction rate was 2.74 mol/(g. h). The RMSE error is in an acceptable range. To decrease error, more data should be gathered to train the model.

Fig. 9. Comparison between real values of the reaction rate with the predicted ones with the model.
The predicted feature importance coefficient with the gradient boosting model for T, P(C3H8), P(C3H6), and P(H2) are 0.46, 0.43, 0.10, and 0.01. The partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed has the lowest effect on the reaction rate.
Propane dehydrogenation is an equilibrium-controlled reaction, and the yield of this reaction can be increased by removing produced hydrogen from the reaction environment using a membrane reactor [46]. On the other side, PDH reaction confronts coke formation. When the rate of coke formation is high, the deposited coke on the metal surface can be partially regenerated (gasified) by hydrogen co-feeding as the in-situ produced hydrogen in the reaction environment would not be enough to prevent catalyst deactivation [7]. This analysis suggests that hydrogen should be co-fed as it does not affect reaction rate (in comparison with other investigated parameters in this study) but it can suppress coke formation.
It is worth mentioning the used approach in this study can be improved by collecting more reaction data. The gathered data from literature for PDH reaction with different catalysts will be evaluated with different machine learning and deep learning models in our upcoming works. We hope this approach can be used for different chemical reactions to provide engineering guidelines.
Conclusion
This work used anti-sintering MgAl2O4 support with decreased and attenuated acidic site centers compared to commercial Al2O3 to prepare bimetallic Pt-Ge catalysts. Alloy formation between the Pt and Ge modified electronic and geometric properties of Pt, and simultaneously, the lower acidic center of the support led to a boosted catalytic performance of the Pt1-Ge2/MgAl2O4 sample. The operation condition of the PDH reaction for this sample was lastly analyzed by employing machine learning technique and a gradient boosting optimizer, which predicted that the temperature and partial pressure of propane to have the highest effects on the reaction rate while hydrogen partial pressure is the least important parameter. However, hydrogen should be co feed-in the PDH reaction to suppress coke formation.
Finally, the used approach in this study can be expanded to other chemical reactions to provide engineering guidelines.
