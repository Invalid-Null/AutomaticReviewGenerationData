The document discusses the reactions and aromatization of propane over Mo2C catalysts deposited on ZSM-5 and SiO2 supports. It does not specifically pertain to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) to produce propylene. The main reaction pathways examined are aromatization of propane over Mo2C/ZSM-5 and dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over Mo2C/SiO2. While propylene formation is mentioned, this appears to be a secondary reaction and the focus is not on optimizing propylene yield through PDH or ODH. Therefore, this document does not meet the criteria for propane dehydrogenation to propylene.
