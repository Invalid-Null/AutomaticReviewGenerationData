The given document does not seem to be relevant, as it does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically for the conversion of propane to propylene. The document examines the adsorption and reactions of propane on Mo2C catalysts supported on ZSM-5 and SiO2, but does not focus on PDH or ODH to produce propylene.
