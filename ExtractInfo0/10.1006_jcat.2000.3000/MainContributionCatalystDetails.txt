 Unfortunately the provided information does not contain enough details to generate a comprehensive XML output on propane dehydrogenation research. The multiple document extracts simply state that the documents are not relevant to propane dehydrogenation, without providing any specific details. 

Since there is no substantive information provided in the extracts, I am unable to synthesize or aggregate any meaningful data. The XML output would reflect that no relevant information was found:

<output>
  <Relevance>No</Relevance>
</output>

Please provide more detailed document extracts containing scientific findings related to propane dehydrogenation catalysts, reaction conditions, performance metrics, etc. in order to generate a complete XML summary. With more substantive information, I can analyze and integrate the key details into a cohesive XML structure.
