 Unfortunately the provided document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses direct propane dehydrogenation in general, but does not provide details about a specific catalyst, its composition, performance metrics, or experimental conditions. Since the key information needed for the structured output is not present, I cannot extract the requested details.
