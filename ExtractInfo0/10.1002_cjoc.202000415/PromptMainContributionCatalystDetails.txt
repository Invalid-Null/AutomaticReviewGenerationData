Catalytic Property and Stability of Subnanometer Pt Cluster on Carbon Nanotube in Direct Propane Dehydrogenation
Main observation and conclusion
The stability of nanosized platinum catalyst in direct propane dehydrogenation reaction is one of most critical challenges, which hinders the further improvements of catalytic performance. The cokes from side reaction covering the active site seriously undermine the catalyst stability. In this work, first principles calculations are performed to explore the catalytic properties of supported subnanometer platinum cluster on carbon nanotube support and focus is put on the inhibition of deep dehydrogenation. The reactivities of metal, interface, and tin promoter are investigated at the same footing. The whole reaction pathway from propane adsorption to propene desorption is revealed for different sites. It turns out that the C—H bond activation in propane is not the catalytic step with the largest barrier. Instead, the desorption of propene is more difficult. The comparison between different sites indicates that the interface between metal and support and Sn promoter is helpful to curb the propene deep dehydrogenation. Moreover, a descriptor is proposed to screen the potential effective propane direct dehydrogenation catalyst. The current work provides important insights on the development of new dehydrogenation catalyst.
Background and Originality Content
The size of supported metal catalyst has apparent importance in various heterogeneous catalytic processes.[1] The metal catalysts show distinct properties and performance in the different range of size. One of the famous examples is the magic catalytic capabilities of gold.[2] Gold is inert in bulk, but it becomes very active in various reactions such as CO oxidation when its size is reduced into nanometer regime. With developments of characterization technique such as high resolution TEM, the sub-nanometer or even single atom metal catalysts have been identified.[3] On the other hand, it is generally considered that sub-nanometer is smaller than 2 nm. One of the pronounced differences for metal particle in different size regime is the related electronic structure. For example, single metal atom mainly has atomic orbitals, subnanometer metal particle consists of molecular orbitals, and nanosized metal particles form continuous energy bands. The remaining intriguing question on metal catalysts is that how to establish the relation among these three parts: size, electronic structure, and performance.
The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) is the industrial route to produce the valuable propylene.[4, 5] The conventional metal catalyst for PDH is platinum. Similar to other reactions catalyzed by Pt, the performance of PDH is very sensitive to size of Pt.[6] In particular, the side reactions such as hydrogenolysis are dependent on Pt size. However, there is still lacking an agreement on the exact relation between Pt size and side reaction. Some studies indicate that the large particle of Pt favors the side reactions and leads to the coke formation,[7] but the opposite observations are also found in literature.[8] On the other hand, the available investigations mostly focus on the Pt catalyst, which is larger than 2 nm. It is rarely reported on the performance of sub-nanometer or single Pt atom in PDH, which is expected to have different properties from nanosized Pt.
The support is indispensable for the application of metal catalysts.[9] The support not only render the mechanical strength but also play an important role to adjust properties of metal catalysts. It is back to 1980s’ that people realized that the interactions between metal and support significantly modify the properties of catalyst for the adsorption of gas molecules such as hydrogen and CO. Strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) is coined to describe the phenomena.[10] The further developments on metal-support interactions lead to the discovery of the electronic metal-support interactions (EMSI).[11] It is found that the electronic structure of supported Pt clusters on ceria is greatly perturbed from the interactions with support. The consequence of EMSI is that the supported Pt shows remarkable performance in water activation. Therefore, a suitable support material will not only stabilize the metal catalysts but also enhance the catalytic performance.
The unique electronic structure and under-coordination of subnano Pt clusters lead to the expectations that it could potentially achieve the further improvements and alleviate the coke formation. In fact, the subnano Pt clusters have already been shown remarkable performance in both direct and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Corma and his co-worker confined subnano Pt clusters in MCM-22.[12] The obtained catalysts not only show impressive thermal stability but also have ability to resist coke formation to some extent. Vajda et al. employ atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique to synthesize the size-selected Pt8-10 cluster, which is deposited on porous Al2O3.[13] The subnanometeric Pt cluster exhibits 40—100 times higher activity compared with conventional Pt and vanadium catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. All these studies clearly indicate the great potential of subnano Pt cluster in propane activation. However, the relation between properties of subnano Pt cluster and catalytic performance is still open for discussions.
On the other hand, the support is of pivotal importance for subnano metal catalysts as they were prone to aggregate and sinister under reaction condition. The carbon materials such as active carbon have a long history to be the metal catalyst support due to their unique properties such as stability, large surface area, easiness to recover precious metal, etc.[14] Furthermore, the nanostructured carbon materials including carbon nanotube, graphene, nanodiamond have more merits besides other appealing properties including good thermal and electronic conductivity, well defined nanostructure, etc. Recently, there are many reports about nanostructured carbon used as metal catalyst support.[15] Moreover, the dopants such as nitrogen or boron, which can enter carbon matrix and replace carbon atom, supply an effective strategy to further tune the catalytic properties of graphene support.[16]
Based on above-mentioned research, there are two purposes in this work, which are contributed to deepen understandings of catalytic properties of subnano Pt and its interactions with support. Firstly, a Pt4 cluster is selected to explore the catalytic performance of subnano sized Pt catalysts in PDH. In particularly, the behavior of subnano Pt cluster in the resistance to coke formation is carefully examined. Secondly, carbon nanotube is chosen to be support for Pt4 cluster. In our previous work, pristine and doped graphene are demonstrated to be excellent support for single Pt atom in PDH.[17] Nitrogen doping is also considered for graphene support, which brings further improvements over pristine one. The analysis is performed to unravel the subtle interactions between Pt and support and the possible perturbation on the electronic structure of Pt induced by this interaction. In end, a narration on the relation between subnano Pt, carbon support, and catalytic performance is presented.
Results and Discussion
A tetrahedral four Pt atom cluster, Pt4, was deposited on the mono-vacancy on carbon nanotube, as shown in Figure 1. The vacancy on carbon nanotube has been demonstrated to be a stable anchoring position for metal catalysts from both experimental and theoretical studies.[25] Two different configurations of Pt4 are considered as shown in Figure 1 and Table S1. Either top (Pt4/CNT_A) or bottom (Pt4/CNT_B) of tetrahedral is placed on the carbon nanotube support with three or one Pt atoms bonding with carbons around vacancy site, respectively. The calculations indicate that Pt4/CNT_B is more stable than Pt4/CNT_A by 0.91 eV. Moreover, COHP analysis as shown in Figure S1 indicates that Pt4/CNT_B has more stronger interactions than Pt4/CNT_A. Therefore, the stability of Pt4/CNT_B can be attributed to the stronger interactions between metal cluster and support. Moreover, Pt atoms in the cluster have distinct charges, which are different from the unsupported cluster. It is found that Pt atoms at

the interface with support are negatively charged and others in cluster are positive charged as shown in Table S2. The charge analysis clearly indicates that the electrons are not evenly distributed among Pt cluster. The interactions between metal cluster and support effectively adjust the electronic properties of metal catalysts.
The propane and propene adsorptions are calculated for Pt4/CNT_A and Pt4/CNT_B, respectively. The optimized structures of propane and propene and binding energies are shown in Figure 2. It is clearly indicated that the adsorption of propene is much stronger than the counterpart of propane, which is expected as propene is more active than propane due to rich pi electron. The strong binding of propene hinders the product desorption, which is closely connected with deep dehydrogenation. Moreover, the adsorptions of propane and propene are not very sensitive to the geometry of active site. It is indicated that single Pt atom can bind propane and propene.

To form propylene, two hydrogens will be abstracted from propane. The reaction pathways from propane to propylene on two different Pt4 clusters are shown in Figure 3. All pathways start from the physisorption of propane and reactions take place at upper layer Pt atoms in cluster, which have no direct interaction with carbon nanotube support. Propane is a non-polar and high symmetry molecule with strong C—H bonding. The breaking of first C—H bond sometimes is deemed as the most difficult step in PDH. As shown in Figures 3 and S2, the first C—H bond in propane is activated on a single Pt atom for all configurations considered in the calculations. At the transition state, the distance between breaking H and C atoms is 1.68 and 1.58 Å for Pt4/CNT_A and Pt4/CNT_B, respectively. The calculated barriers of TS1 is 0.86 and 0.30 eV for configurations Pt4/CNT_A and Pt4/CNT_B, respec-

tively. As only single Pt atom involved in C—H bond activation, the different barrier implied that the intrinsic properties such as charge state could have a direct effect on the catalytic performance. The calculations also indicate that only one Pt atom can be an active site to break C—H bond, which is consistent with our previous work.[26] After first C—H activation, the dissociated fragments H and C3H7 both are attached with same Pt atom. For the second hydrogen abstraction, the first abstracted hydrogen from propane needs to diffuse to the adjacent Pt atom to vacant active site. This process is exothermic for both Pt4/CNT_A and Pt4/CNT_B. After hydrogen diffusion, the second hydrogen is abstracted and propylene is formed as shown in TS2 in Figure 3. This is an exothermic process for Pt4/CNT_B without a barrier and it was calculated to have a 0.22 eV barrier on Pt4/CNT_A. Overall, it is suggested that Pt4/CNT_B is more active towards C—H bond activation than Pt4/CNT_A. Moreover, the barrier on supported Pt4 is also comparable with or even lower than the counterparts on bare cluster without support and other conventional Pt catalysts.[27]
On the other hand, one of the most critical challenges for PDH is to curb the coke formation. The cokes formed during PDH often require regeneration of catalysts, which requires more costs and decreases efficiency. It is generally concluded that most of cokes result from the deep dehydrogenation of propene. Therefore, the competitions between propene desorption and deep dehydrogenation will determine stability of catalyst to some extents. The reaction pathways leading to propylene desorption and deep dehydrogenation are also shown in Figure 3. First of all, both desorption energy of formed propylene and the barrier of deep dehydrogenation on Pt4/CNT_A and Pt4/CNT_B are significantly bigger than the barrier of first, second C—H bond activation in propane. Both are above 1 eV, which seems to be the rate-limiting step along reaction pathways. Unfortunately, the desorption energy of propene is bigger than the barrier of deep dehydrogenation on both Pt4/CNT_A and Pt4/CNT_B. The desorption energy of propene and the deep dehydrogenation are 1.50, 1.49 and 1.34, 1.28 eV for Pt4/CNT_A and Pt4/CNT_B, respectively. Even worse, it is indicated that reaction more easily takes deep hydrogenation pathway than propene desorption which potentially leads to coke formation and reduces stability. Furthermore, the same bare unsupported Pt4 cluster also has the same trend, which favors deep
dehydrogenation rather than desorption as predicted in previous DFT calculation.[27]
The interface between metal cluster and support has pronounced catalytic performance in some catalytic reactions. Therefore, the activities of Pt at perimeter between cluster and support are investigated for cluster A, which is inclined to deep dehydrogenation. The reaction pathway for Pt at perimeter is shown in Figure 4. Firstly, it is noted that the barriers of first and second C—H bond activation are both reduced compared with Pt at upper layer as shown in Figure 3, which is 0.56 and 1.00 eV, respectively. This is a clear indication that Pt at perimeter has a better reactivity towards C—H bond activation. More interestingly, the propene desorption is also facilitated at perimeter Pt compared with deep dehydrogenation. The difference between propene desorption and deep dehydrogenation is 0.51 eV. Hence, the perimeter sites have both good activity towards C—H bond activation and inhibition of deep dehydrogenation.

On the other hand, Pt at perimeter of cluster B is not accessible for propane activation. To further optimize the catalytic performance of Pt4/CNT_B, second metal, Sn, is introduced to be alloyed with Pt cluster. In fact, Sn is the conventional component used for Pt catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.[28] The effect of Sn is sometimes attributed to increase of stability. One of Pt in cluster is replaced by Sn. Moreover, the ratio between Pt and Sn is 3 : 1, which is recommended in literature for propane dehydrogenation. The whole reaction pathway from propane adsorption to product desorption is shown in Figure 5 for Pt3Sn. The calculations indicate that the addition of Sn does not bring down the barrier of C—H activation. The first and second C—H activation barriers are calculated to be 0.46 and 1.24 eV, respectively. However, more significant influence brought by Sn alloying is to facilitate the propene desorption and inhibit the deep dehydrogenation. The desorption of propene is lower by 0.44 eV than the deep dehydrogenation. Therefore, Sn addition is suggested to be also effective to tune catalytic abilities of Pt cluster catalyst and enhance stability.

As discussed above, one of the most critical issues for PDH is the coke formation during reaction. The competition between propene desorption and deep dehydrogenation has a significant effect on the coke formation. On the other hand, the calculations reveal that either propene desorption or deep dehydrogenation has a bigger energy barrier than C—H bond activation in propane on subnanometer Pt cluster. Hence, the most challenging issue pins down to curb coke. Based on the calculation results, it is proposed that the ratio (r) between energy for propene desorption and deep dehydrogenation is a determing factor to calibrate PDH catalyst performance. Propene desorption is more favorable when r is smaller than 1. Moreover, it is found that the ratio is well correlated with the adsorption of propene at different sites investigated in current work. A linear relationship between two
parameters is established, as shown in Figure S3.
Conclusions
In this work, a systematic density functional theory (DFT) study is performed on the propane direct dehydrogenation on subnanometer Pt cluster. A complete reaction pathway is revealed, which covers from propane adsorption to product formation. Single Pt site is sufficient to break C—H bond in propane. It is indicated that C—H bond activation is not the most critical step on pathway. Instead, the propene desorption is more challenging. The reactivities of metal site, interface, and Sn alloying are carefully examined at the same footing. It is found that interface and Sn can boost the stability of catalyst and inhibit deep dehydrogenation. A descriptor is proposed to screen the potential PDH catalyst, which has a linear relation with propene adsorption. The current work not only supplies new insights on the reaction mechanism of PDH but also lays out solid basis for future catalyst design.
Computation Setup
The calculations reported here were performed by using periodic, spin-polarized DFT as implemented in the form of Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).[18, 19] For valence electrons, a plane-wave basis set was adopted with an energy cutoff of 400 eV and ionic cores were described with the projector augmented- wave (PAW) method.[20, 21] The Revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (RPBE)[22] functional was used as the exchange-correlation functional approximation, which showed better performance in barrier estimation, and used zero damping DFT-D3 method of Grimme for van der Waals correlation correction.[23] The supercell is 21.78 × 21.78 × 12.30 Å3 for x, y and z direction and the periodic condition is employed along z direction. The reaction pathways and energy barriers were calculated by using the climbing nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method.[24] The reaction barrier was calculated as difference between initial state (IS) and the highest image along pathway.
In order to analyze the propane adsorbed on catalyst, the adsorption energy (ΔEads) and the reaction energy (ΔE) were defined through following equation (1):

where EA/catalyst is the total energies of the catalyst with the adsorbates (A) including C3H8 and C3H6, Ecatalyst and EA are the energy of clean catalyst and free C3H8 (or C3H6), respectively. EFS and EIS are the total energies of the final state (FS) and the initial state (IS). The stability of catalyst is also explored via ab initio molecular dynamics, as shown in Figure S4.
