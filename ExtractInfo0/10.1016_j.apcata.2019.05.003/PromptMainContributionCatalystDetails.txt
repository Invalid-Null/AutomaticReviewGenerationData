1. Introduction
The conversion of light alkanes to more valuable chemicals is a challenging problem in the chemical sciences [1]. Methane is converted to syngas by catalytic steam reforming [2]. This endothermic reaction is performed at temperatures around 1000 °C and the process produces large amounts of CO2. Ethane is converted to ethylene by non-catalytic steam cracking [3]. Propane is catalytically dehydrogenated to propylene, by several processes [4,5], all of which are equilibrium limited, are plagued by coking, and have low yields (˜50% or less).
The oxidative conversion of methane to ethylene, of ethane to ethylene, or propane to propylene could, in principle, alleviate some shortcomings of alkane dehydrogenation, by using oxygen to react selectively with the hydrogen produced by dehydrogenation. This will shift the dehydrogenation equilibrium favorably, make the overall process exothermic, and reduce coke production [6]. In spite of extensive studies, none of the catalysts examined is adequate for commercial use [4,7,8]. An obvious difficulty is finding a catalyst that will oxidize H2 to H2O without oxidizing the alkane and/or the alkene.
Halogens (X2) can be used, instead of oxygen or together with oxygen, to oxidize alkanes and their use has been reviewed recently [9]. The adoption of halogen-based alkane dehydrogenation technology is hampered by process complexity, corrosion, and inefficiencies associated with HX separation and oxidation [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. Various process schemes have been proposed using halogens as oxidants, generally involving the reactions listed in Table 1 for methane and propane [[22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]]. Oxygen is used to regenerate the halogen from the hydrogen halide (HX) produced by the reaction of the halogen with the alkane. This is one of the reactions that determine which halogen is most useful: a catalyst is required for the oxidation of hydrogen bromide [[31], [32], [33], [34], [35]] or hydrogen chloride [13,[36], [37], [38], [39]], while hydrogen iodide oxidation occurs rapidly in the gas-phase without a catalyst [12,40,41].

In the case of propane conversion to propylene by oxyhalogenation, propylene yields as high as 40% have been reported [42]. Recent studies have demonstrated high selectivities to alkyl halide using VPO [43] and EuOBr [44] and have shown that the mechanism involves heterogeneous HX oxidation followed by gas-phase halogenation [45]. These steps may be physically separated by adding the alkane after HX oxidation, preventing thus carbon oxide formation [23].
The choice of halogen involves a trade-off: strong electrophiles (e.g. Cl2) readily activate the C–H bond, however, they form stronger bonds with hydrogen making the regeneration of the halogen from the hydrogen halide difficult (Table 1) [46]. In contrast, weaker electrophiles (e.g., I2) cannot readily activate C–H bonds, but they form weaker bonds with hydrogen and I2 is easily recovered from HI. The activation energy for HI oxidation is so low, that it can be oxidized back to I2 in the gas-phase in-situ [12,47]. Iodine is the weakest electrophile of the halogens and therefore the most desirable for all steps, except breaking the C–H bond.
In the present work, we show that a mixture of iodine and bromine is much better for processing propane and methane than either halogen used alone.
Previous work using a combination of halogens to process an alkane was limited to gas-phase reactions in the absence of oxygen. In bromine assisted dehydrogenation, adding iodine increases the rate of reaction and decreases the selectivity towards dibrominated alkanes [49,50] (which are unwanted). Dibromomethane has also been used as a source of bromine for iodine-assisted propane dehydrogenation [51] and it was found that the presence of I2 in the feed increases substantially propane conversion. Studies using chlorine, iodine, and methane mixtures suggest that ICl reacts with methyl radicals to form methyl iodide [52] at very low conversion. Other work suggests that BrCl brominates hydrocarbons faster than it chlorinates hydrocarbons [53,54]. ICl iodinates hydrocarbons at very low conversion and ICl chlorinates at higher conversion [[55], [56], [57], [58]]. Stoichiometric HX is produced in each case.
The present work has two themes: first, the use of halogens and oxygen for oxidative dehydrogenation of a propane as a possible route for propylene preparation; second, to document the remarkable synergy between Br2 and I2 -- together these halogens are more effective than either one is separately.
We investigate four aspects of oxihalogenation. (1) The conversion of propane to propylene by using a mixture of Br2, I2 and oxygen. The goal is to establish the best Br2:I2 ratio. (2) The reaction of propane with Br2 and I2 in the absence of oxygen to help clarify the role of oxygen. (3) The reaction of methane with a mixture of Br2 and I2, with the goal of making selectively CH3Br. (4) The kinetic model for methane halogenation and the radical chemistry of mixtures of iodine and bromine.
2. Experimental
2.1. Reactor design and reaction procedure
A flow reactor system was used for reaction studies with an online mass spectrometer (Stanford Research Systems RGA 300) to analyze products. All tubing was made from glass or Hastelloy-C with graphite ferrules or ground glass joints (Fig. 1). A heated glass capillary tube was used to sample and transport the reactor effluent from the mass spectrometer, and a complete material balance including halogens was maintained.

Fig. 1. Schematic of reactor and associated gas supply and product analysis. All materials in contact with halogens were made from glass, PTFE, or Hastelloy.
Iodine and bromine were delivered as vapors from evaporators operating at liquid-vapor equilibrium with argon carrier gas, which was delivered using mass flow controllers. The gases were combined and delivered to a tubular quartz reactor (1.27 cm ID) that was held inside a stainless-steel heating block with two 350 W cartridge heaters. After the reactor heating block, a helium gas stream was introduced to dilute and quench the reactor effluent, i.e., to prevent alkyl halides and halo acids from reacting. The effluent then passed through a Hastelloy junction where a glass capillary tube (0.025 mm ID) delivered gases directly to the mass spectrometer. The temperature was controlled from a k-type thermocouple (1/16 in. inserted into a quartz sleeve in the center of the reactor.
Ruthenium-doped ceria was used as a catalyst for HBr oxidation in the presence of iodine and was prepared according to previous work [59]. Briefly, the combustion synthesis method was used to generate atomically doped ceria with 5% ruthenium atoms. Stoichiometric amounts of cerium nitrate, ruthenium nitrate, and urea were dissolved in solution, dried and heated to 500 °C. The solution burns with a hot flame yielding high surface area atomically doped oxide.
When silica beads were used, Davicat SI 1102 beads were used between layers of quartz wool. When SiC was used, Sigma Aldrich silicon carbide (20–450 mesh) was used with no quartz wool. When salts were used, the preparation, reactor, and procedure was repeated in previous reports [12], where the pure salts were melted in a 12 mm diameter quartz reactor, and gas was introduced via a 3 mm diameter quartz tube immediately above the surface of the salt. Gases were flowed downstream into the same tubing and mass spectrometer described downstream of the reactor in Fig. 1.
Conversions were calculated by dividing the difference in inlet and outlet mass spec values by the inlet values. Selectivities are reported as carbon molar percentages. Carbon accumulation is calculated from carbon not accounted for in the effluent gases. Yields are reported as the product of selectivity and conversion. The space time yield was calculated as follows:
Space time yield (STY):
Volumetric space time yield:
where njoutlet is the molar flow of the product j at the reactor outlet, mjoutlet is the mass flow of the product j at the reactor outlet, and ncatalyst is the number of moles of catalyst in the reactor.
2.2. Microkinetic model
A microkinetic model was constructed using rate constants compiled by the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST). The coupled reaction network of rate equations were solved using Mathematica for isothermal and isobaric conditions for a given set of initial concentrations, temperature, and pressure. Sufficient data were available for reactions between iodine and bromine, and methane halogenation reactions. Complete rate data for the halogenation of propane or propane oxidative dehydrogenation was unavailable, and therefore, the halogenation of methane and the interactions of iodine and bromine radicals in the gas-phase phase are modeled herein.
Reactions with iodine monobromide were unavailable, and therefore rate information was calculated based on experimental data. For pre-exponentials and activation energies for reactions containing iodine monobromide, the averages of the bromine and iodine values were taken (except for reaction 30 in Table 2, “CH3 + IBr → CH3I + Br”). The values used in the calculations are presented in Table 2. Prior work studying interhalogens reported that when an interhalogen reacts with a methyl radical, the less electrophilic halogen forms a bond with the methyl radical. BrCl was reported to form methyl bromide [54], and ICl was reported to form methyl iodide. [52] To assess whether our experimental data suggest the same behavior for CH3 + IBr, the rate constants of reactions 29 (“CH3 + IBr → CH3Br + I”) and 30 were related by k30 = a·k29, and a was adjusted to give the best agreement between the model and our experimental results (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). The experimental data reported in this manuscript is consistent with a model in which k30 = 10·k29, and this value was used for data in Fig. 7, Fig. 9. Our experimental data, therefore, suggest that the reaction between CH3 and IBr forms CH3I more rapidly than CH3Br. In addition, reactions 22–24 did not significantly affect the yields (Fig. 9), and were estimated by taking the arithmetic average of iodine and bromine for iodine monobromide pre-exponentials and activation energies.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Halogen aided oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene
Previous work [12] has shown that the performance of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, C3H8 +1/2 O2 → C3H6 + H2O, is improved if I2 is added to a feed propane and oxygen. The mechanism proposed involves the steps in Table 1. This mechanism suggests that a mixture of Br2 and I2 might be beneficial since the facile dissociation of I2 is a source of radicals, which may initiate the formation of Br, which will aggressively attack propane. The experiments presented here show that using a mixture of Br2 and I2 increases the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene.
When the feed composition was C3H8:O2:I2 = 0.1:0.05:0.05 atm (no Br2 was present), the conversion was ˜40% and propylene selectivity was ˜53% (Fig. 2). When the reaction used C3H8:O2:Br2 = 0.1:0.05:0.043 (see Fig. 3) the conversion of propane was ˜80% and the selectivity to C3H6 was ˜68%. These points demonstrate that I2 is less effective than Br2. However, in considering a process based on Br2 alone, the high conversion must be balanced against the fact that additional expense must be incurred to recover Br2 from HBr.

The partial pressures in the feed were 0.1:0.05:0.043 atm for C3H8:O2:Br2, and the reaction temperature was 500 °C, the space time was 30 s, the total pressure was 1 atm, and the reactor was empty (no packing).
To examine propylene formation in the presence of oxygen, iodine, and bromine, we performed two kinds of experiments. In one, we used a feed of C3H8, O2, and I2 to which we add variable amounts of Br2 (Fig. 2). In the other we used a feed of C3H8, O2 and Br2 to which we add variable amounts of I2 (Fig. 3). Fig. 2a shows an increase in conversion of propane and oxygen with small amounts of bromine addition to the feed of 0.1:0.05:0.05 atm C3H8 at 500 °C and 30 s residence time. The selectivity to propene (Fig. 2b) increases with increasing bromine, and the selectivity to carbon oxide and propyl halide decrease (Fig. 2b).
In many catalytic reactions intended to convert an alkane to an alkene, an increase of alkane conversion is coupled with a decrease of selectivity to alkene. The present results are an exception to this rule: both conversion and selectivity increase with bromine addition. Furthermore, this reaction does not follow the typical trend of halogen reactions with alkanes at Br2:I2 < 0.6, where increasing the halogen-to-carbon ratio results in increased formation of polyhalogenated alkanes. Finally, we note that carbon accumulation increases when Br2:I2 ratio is 0.6 or higher, possibly because of the formation of an unstable dibromopropane intermediate which decomposes to produce coke.
Fig. 3 shows the results of experiments in which I2 was added to a feed containing 0.1:0.05:0.043 atm C3H8:O2:Br2. The reaction was performed at 500 °C, with a residence time of 30 s, which are optimized conditions (Fig. S1). When no I2 was added propane conversion was ˜75% and selectivity to propylene was ˜50%. Addition of I2 causes a minor change in conversion and a large change in selectivity to propylene, from ˜50% in the absence of I2 to ˜68% when a small amount of I2 is present. The presence of I2 also lowers carbon accumulation and the amount of C3H7Br formed. Increasing the concentration of I2 beyond I2:Br2 = 0.05 does not increase its beneficial effect on the reaction. In summary, adding a small amount of I2 to a feed of C3H8, oxygen and Br2 is beneficial: both conversion and selectivity are improved.
The selectivity of oxygen to water, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide indicates how the extents of reaction compare between HI oxidation and hydrocarbon oxidation – HI oxidation produces only water, and hydrocarbon oxidation produces carbon oxides and water. In the experiments in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, more than half of the converted oxygen ended in H2O in all cases when iodine was present, and higher iodine pressures resulted in higher H2O selectivities (Fig. S2). Significantly more CO was produced than CO2, in part due to the fact that the oxygen to propane ratio is substoichiometric for complete combustion. When Br2:I2 was 0, oxygen conversion was lower (Fig. 2(a)), resulting in higher oxygen pressure throughout the reactor and the corresponding ration of CO2:CO was higher (Fig. S2(a)).
In the two cases presented in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, the addition of a second halogen improves performance. However, one should keep in mind using Br2 produces HBr, which must be oxidized to recover Br2, which requires a catalyst and an additional reactor. In contrast, the iodination reaction produces HI, which reacts spontaneously with oxygen to recover I2.
3.2. Halogen assisted oxidative dehydrogenation at 350 °C
To clarify the mechanism of the reaction, and to explore different reaction conditions, we have performed halogen assisted, propane oxidative dehydrogenation at 350 °C, in a fixed bed reactor filled with silica. At this temperature, Br2 breaks the C–H bond but iodine does not.
Part of the motivation for using combinations of bromine and iodine is to reduce the residence time, compared to iodine mediated ODH. The residence time ultimately affects the process cost through reactor volume and catalyst amount. In this gas-phase process, iodine is the catalyst, and the space time yield (STY) is 486 h−1 (486 moleC3H6 × hr−1 × moleI2−1) and the volumetric space time yield is 0.02 kgC3H6 L−1 h−1. The STY is 2 orders of magnitude higher than some high performing oxychlorination catalysts [15], and 2 orders of magnitude higher than some high performing ODH catalysts [2]. The volumetric space time yield is approximately one order of magnitude lower than some high-performing oxychlorination catalysts [15]. The STY must be evaluated in a larger context given the unique nature of this gas-phase catalyst. In addition, higher pressure can be used to reduce reactor volume. Ultimately, since C–H bond cleavage is the rate determining step, we expect the reactor size to be comparable to any process in which bromine radicals break the C–H bond in the gas phase, longer than chlorine based processes, but shorter than iodine-based processes.
3.3. Propane reaction with bromine and iodine in absence of oxygen
The effect of I2 on the reaction of a feed of Br2:C3H8 = 0.1atm: 0.035 atm, in the absence of O2, was studied at 350 °C. In the absence of I2, bromine reacts with propane to make C3H7Br (Fig. 5 ). No propylene or polybrominated propane is produced. At this temperature, all polybrominated propanes are unstable; some are probability formed as intermediates that decompose to produce carbon. The addition of I2 has a small effect on propane conversion but lowers the Br2 conversion. Iodine has a strong effect on selectivity: the amount of C3H7I increases from zero to 50% and the selectivity to C3H7Br decreases.

Propane halogenation in the absence of oxygen at 350 °C, 10 s space time in an empty reactor (no packing) (a) Conversion and (b) selectivity for propane halogenation using constant bromine pressure with various iodine:bromine ratios. The ratio of the partial pressures was C3H8:Br2 = 0.1:0.03 and the reaction was at 350 °C, 10 s space time, and the reactor was empty (no packing).
The absence of propylene is explained by two factors. (1) The reaction C3H7I → C3H6 + HI, which is the step in which propylene is produced, is reversible. When oxygen is present, HI is consumed rapidly by 2HI + ½ O2 → I2 + H2O and this favors the decomposition of propyl iodide. The absence of oxygen helps C3H7I survive. (2) The temperature is too low to decompose the propyl bromide.
To determine which elementary steps iodine participates in, an experiment was conducted to examine the reaction of iodine with propane, in the absence of bromine and oxygen. No reaction was observed 350 °C, for a residence time of 10 s, at 0.1 atm propane, 0.035 atm iodine, and 0.865 atm argon. Under these conditions, I2 dissociates to form I atoms, but these are unable to react with propane: neither the H–I bond nor the C3H7-I bond are strong enough to drive the formation of propyl iodide.
3.4. HBr oxidation in the presence of iodine
The oxidative conversion of propane to propylene, in the presence of I2, generates HI as an intermediate. This reacts rapidly with oxygen in the gas phase, which has two beneficial effects: 1. It prevents the oxygen from burning propane or propylene. 2. It prevents HI from reacting with propylene. Furthermore, because HI oxidation in gas phase is very efficient, it is easy to convert the HI produced by reactions back to I2.
Contrast this with the oxidative bromination. This produces HBr, which does not react with oxygen in the absence of a catalyst. Therefore, if one plans to use bromine assisted oxidative dehydrogenation one must provide for Br2 recovery from HBr using a catalyst. We have tested a HBr oxidation catalyst consisting of CeO2 doped with Ru (5% Ru), which was previously reported and characterized [59,61]. We have also inquired whether addition of I2 to the feed of HBr + O2 will affect HBr conversion. The results of these experiments are shown in Table 3. HBr oxidation was studied for a feed containing HBr: O2: Ar = 0.5: 0.15: 0.35, at 350 °C, at 5 s space time, using 50 mg of catalyst.
Table 3. Results from experiments in which 0.5 atm HBr, 0.15 atm O2, and 0.35 atm Ar were combined in a reactor at 5 s space time with or without 0.05 atm I2 or 50 mg 5%Ru-doped CeO2. Bromine and water were the only products detected.
Catalyst for: HBr + O2 HBr conversion Temperature
RuCeOx + I2(gas) 68% 350 °C
RuCeOx 1% 350 °C
I2(gas) 0% 350 °C
RuCeOx + I2(gas) 77% 500 °C
RuCeOx 75% 500 °C
I2(gas) 9% 500 °C
At 350 °C, HBr does not react with oxygen regardless whether RuCeOx is present or not (Table 3). However, adding I2 (e.g. using a feed HBr:O2:Ar:I2 = 0.5:0.15:0.35:0.05) in the presence of RuCeOx increases HBr conversion to 68%. This is remarkable considering the fact that addition of I2 in the absence of the catalyst has a small effect on HBr oxidation (9% HBr conversion). The behavior of the system is very different at 500 °C. At this temperature the catalyst alone (no I2 added to the feed) is active (75% HBr conversion) and iodine addition has a small effect. These results indicate that there is great synergy between I2 and the catalyst: together they are very effective, even though they are unhelpful alone.
Instead of oxidizing the hydrogen halide in a separate reactor, the use of molten salts have been reported to convert a mixture of oxygen and propane to propylene and iodine in a single reactor [12]. Therefore we tested whether the same concept can be used for combinations of halogens using a mixture of LiI:LiBr = 1:1 as opposed to pure LiI melt (Fig. S3 and Fig. S4). In this system, the oxygen reacts with the salt to produce halogen and an oxide (or hydroxide), the halogen reacts with propane to produce propylene and hydrogen halide, and the latter reacts with the oxide to recover the Li halide. The overall reaction is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The conversion and selectivity to propylene are very similar to those obtained in gas phase (Fig. S3). We conclude that combination of halogens could be used to help the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the gas-phase or in a molten salt.
3.5. Reaction of methane with a mixture of bromine and iodine and comparison to microkinetic model
In the case of propane, the use of halogens facilitates oxidative dehydrogenation and one can obtain better conversion and selectivity to propene by using two halogens. The effect of a combination of halogens is very different from the sum of the effects of each halogen acting separately. In this section, we explore briefly whether a combination of halogens shows this kind of synergy for methane halogenation. The target is the selective formation of the monohalogenated methane, which can be used as a feed for a number of interesting reactions. Of particular interest is the formation of CH3Br without formation of CH2Br2. We investigate whether the bromination reaction is affected by addition of I2 in the feed. Fig. 6 shows the effect of adding I2 to a feed having 0.1 atm of CH4 and 0.03 atm Br2, at 450 °C, at 10 s space time, in an empty reactor (no packing), which are optimized conditions (Fig. S5). Under these conditions I2 alone has no effect on methane. In the absence of I2, methane reacts with Br2, with a conversion of ˜28% and ˜80% selectivity to CH3Br and ˜ 10% to CH2Br2. Gradual addition of I2 reduces the conversion of methane and the formation of CH3Br and increases the amount of CH3I and CH2I2. This happens in spite of the fact that I2 alone has no effect on methane.

Fig. 6. Methane bromination. (a) Conversion and (b) selectivity for methane bromination using constant bromine pressure with various iodine:bromine pressure ratios, in the absence of oxygen. The reaction was carried out at 450 °C, with a feed ratio of 0.1:0.03 atm CH4:Br2, 10 s space time, and an empty reactor (no packing).
In order to understand and interpret the experimental results described above, we have modeled the kinetics of methane halogenation by using the data reported in Table 2. We concentrate on methane halogenation because there is not sufficient kinetic data available for propane reactions with halogens and oxygen. The results of this model are presented in Fig. 7. Side reactions to coke, trihalides, and tetrahalides are not included because they were not observed experimentally (Fig. 6). Note that low bromine-to-methane ratios of 0.3 were used for experiments and for modeling, where polyhalide formation is expected to be minimal.

Fig. 7. Microkinetic modeling result for methane halogenation for (a) conversion and (b) selectivity for methane bromination using constant bromine pressure with various iodine:bromine ratios. The feed ratio was 0.1:0.03 CH4:Br2, the reaction was modeled at 450 °C, and a space time of 10 s.
3.6. Microkinetic model of halogen radical chemistry and sensitivity analysis
Further understanding of the mechanism was investigated using microkinetic modeling of the interaction of halogens with one another, and by using a sensitivity analysis to understand which elementary steps most affected methyl halide yields. The model provides insight into the relative rates of iodine and bromine radical formation (Fig. 8). For example, it suggests that small amounts of iodine significantly increase the bromine radical concentration when Br2 is present (Fig. 8(a) vs. (b)). However, when more iodine is added (Fig. 8(c)), the bromine and bromine radical concentrations decrease. This is due to iodine monobromide formation, which is more stable than iodine. This may be the reason for the increase in methane, propane, and bromine conversions when small amounts of iodine are added to the bromination reaction (Fig. 5, Fig. 6).

Fig. 8. Microkinetic model of bromine and iodine radical concentrations at 450 °C as a function of time (s) in the absence of hydrocarbons. The total bromine atom concentration is 0.2 atm in all cases at all times, initially starting with 0.1 atm diatomic bromine. Cases are (a) Br2 only, (b) 0.01 atm I2 added, and (c) 0.09 atm I2 added.
The formation of iodine monobromide is much faster than reactions between radicals and alkanes (comparing reaction times in Fig. 7, Fig. 8, indicating that iodine monobromide is always in high concentration during halogenation if there are sufficient amounts of each halogen present. For these reasons, alkyl iodides are produced at lower temperatures than previously reported since bromine breaks the C–H bond. In addition, we expect that an increased rate of halogenation would occur for other alkanes such as ethane or butane, because bromine dissociation in the presence of iodine occurs significantly faster than any of the alkane reactions. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that an increased rate was observed for methane halogenation (Fig. 6), propane halogenation (Fig. 5), and propane oxidative dehydrogenation (Figs. 2 and 3).
Optimization of the model to maximum methyl iodide yield trends to higher temperatures and higher halogen concentrations without bound. This is not the case experimentally, because at high temperatures and high halogen concentrations, coking occurs.
A sensitivity analysis was performed using the microkinetic rate constants to understand which elementary reactions have the greatest impact on the overall rate of methyl iodide production (Fig. 9). The rate for methyl iodide formation and decomposition are sensitive to the rate of the following reactions
CH3I + Br → CH3 + IBr
CH3I + I → CH3 + I2

Fig. 9. Sensitivity analysis for the most sensitive 14 elementary steps in the microkinetic model for methane iodination. We plot the change in the methyl iodide yield when a single rate constant is increased by 10%. For example, the yield increases by ˜5% when the rate constant for 2 I → I2 is increased by 10% and the other rate constants were not changed. The feed contained 0.1:0.03:0.03 atm CH4:Br2:I2, temperature 450 °C, and space time 10 s. Table 2 contains the complete list of reactions and rate constants used in the model.
The final product in methane halogenation is methyl halide. In the case of propane, the propyl halide eliminates HX to form propylene. Forming an alkene is not an option for the methane, which has only a carbon atom. The model also shows that CH3Br decomposition is slow, resulting in selectivity towards CH3Br. The kinetic model suggests that without radical-initiated decomposition by I and Br, high selectivities to methyl iodide would be observed (Fig. S6).
Methane halogenation in the presence of oxygen was also studied (Fig. S7). Propane dehydrogenation had higher conversion and less of it was converted to carbon oxides, when oxygen was added (Fig. 4 vs. 5). However, this is not the case for methane, for which a high percentage of methane is converted to carbon oxides when I2, Br2, and O2 are all present. The reason may be that HI cannot be eliminated from C1 to create a double bond. As a result, carbon oxides are formed from oxidation of methyl halides by oxygen. We expect that this situation is unique to methane, and that any other hydrocarbon that can eliminate hydrogen iodide would exhibit improved performance. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that butane dehydrogenation in the presence of iodine and oxygen also makes a small amount of carbon oxides [47].
3.7. The effect of glass and SiC beads on the conversion of alkyl halides to propylene
In many cases, reactions involving radical intermediates are affected by the presence of solid surfaces on which the radicals can adsorb and recombine. The decomposition of a propyl halide, to eliminate the acid and form propylene is slow at temperatures below 400 °C. To determine the role of solid surfaces on these reactions we have use a bed of glass beads (quartz) or of silicon carbide beads. These were chosen because they are unlikely to cause coking. At 320 °C, no conversion was observed without packing (Fig. 10). Quartz beads and silicon carbide beads promote equally the decomposition of propyl iodide, with a yield of ˜40%. If oxygen is added to the feed the yield is ˜80% (Fig. 10), consistent with the observation that the oxygen reacts readily with HI.

Fig. 10. Propyl halide dehydrohalogenation in the presence and absence of glass and silicon carbide beads. The temperature was 320 °C, with 30 s space time. (a) 0.09 atm propyl iodide in argon was sent into a tube that was empty, filled with quartz beads, filled with SiC beads, or filled with quartz beads with 0.5 O2:C3H7I co-fed. (b) Propyl bromide under the same conditions.
The behavior of C3H7Br is different. The yield is much higher (˜75%) and the quartz is slightly more active than SiC. The addition of oxygen has a small effect, essentially because HBr does not react with oxygen. Nearly 100% conversion of propyl iodide and propyl bromide were observed at 500 °C [12]. In addition, the dehydrohalogenation of propyl halides is endothermic and a thermocouple in the center of the bed was used to control the reaction temperature. This temperature was also compared to the reactor heater block temperature to ensure a negligible temperature difference across the reactor. The authors therefore conclude that the difference in reaction rates observed in Fig. 10 was not due to heat transfer across the reactor.
4. Conclusions
Prior work has shown that adding iodine to a mixture of propane and oxygen, improves the yield of propylene above that obtained in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of a halogen. In this work we have shown that adding two halogens to a feed of propane and oxygen improves propane conversion and the selectivity to propylene, above that observed when only one halogen is used. This happens because I2 dissociates more easily to form radicals, which help the formation of Br atoms, which react more aggressively with propane. At the optimum conditions, yields to propylene of 60% were observed, which is higher than the sum of the yields with either halogen alone, and higher than the equilibrium yield for propane dehydrogenation equilibrium. When iodine and bromine are jointly used, the formation of HBr is problematic because it is not readily oxidized to Br2. This means that the recovery of Br2 from HBr has to be performed separately. We have shown that a Ru-doped ceria catalyst performs this task effectively and its performance is improved if iodine is added to the feed of oxygen and HBr. In order to better understand the mechanism, we have also studied the decomposition of propyl iodide and have shown that its decomposition to propylene benefits from the presence of quartz or silicon carbide powder in the reactor. We attribute this to the fact that the presence of a solid surface affects the chemistry of the radical intermediates.
The use of halogens to aid the oxidative dehydrogenation is likely to be applicable to other hydrocarbons that are capable of forming double bonds by dehydrogenation. Methane, having one carbon, cannot react by this route: it can only form methyl halide or dihalide methane. Using two halogens affects the formation of methyl bromide and methyl iodide but overall the results for methane are disappointing.
