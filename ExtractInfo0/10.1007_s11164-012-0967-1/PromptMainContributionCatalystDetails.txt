Autocatalytic dehydrogenation of propane
Homogeneous gas-phase pyrolysis of propane was performed by using continuous CO2 laser irradiation for bulk heating of the reaction mixture. Laser energy was absorbed by ethylene, the main product of propane dehydrogenation, and transferred to the reaction medium via collisional relaxation. A mechanism of propane dehydrogenation is suggested to describe the pyrolysis process. The mechanism involves autocatalysis by ethylene and includes propane–ethylene interaction with the formation of ethyl and propyl radicals.
Introduction
Dehydrogenation of propane with the formation of light olefins has been studied intensively since the 1930s as a basis for high tonnage production [1–3]. In parallel, the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation has been investigated. Kinetic schemes consisting of 10 to more than 1000 reactions [4–7] have been developed for a wide range of conditions: different temperatures and pressures, low conversions of propane, the presence of argon or other gases, etc. Propane dehydrogenation mechanisms comprising many elementary steps were proposed by Starik et al. [5] and Ktalkherman [6] for propane pyrolysis in adiabatic and fast-mixing reactors at temperatures of 1000 and 1250 K. Tomlin et al. [8] analyzed a kinetic scheme for high-temperature pyrolysis of propane [7] comprising 422 chemical reactions. According to these data, when elementary steps are decreased in number to the 50 most important steps, this does not lead to significant divergence between the sets of pyrolysis products. Analysis of the literature on propane dehydrogenation schemes [3, 9–12] with a relatively small number of steps, fewer than 20, showed that the calculated kinetic dependences disagree with experimental data for low-temperature (below 1000 K) pyrolysis at atmospheric pressure with high conversion of propane.
In a study of low-temperature pyrolysis of propane, Lifshitz et al. [4] noted that generation of radicals:
$$ {\text{C}}_{3}{\text{H}}_{ 8}\to {\text{CH}}_{3}^\bullet + {\text{C}}_{2}{\text{H}}_{5}^\bullet $$ (1)
with an activation energy within the range 350–380 kJ/mol, according to the NIST database. This is a high energy barrier in the process of low-temperature pyrolysis of propane. Dissociation of C3H8 into hydrogen and propyl radicals with an activation energy above 400 kJ/mol does not facilitate generation of radicals. An interesting conclusion was made by Dombi et al. [13, 14], who investigated the effect of pyrolysis products of propane. The authors revealed the reaction:
$$ {\text{C}}_{3}{\text{H}}_{8}+{\text{C}}_{2}{\text{H}}_{4}\to{\text{C}}_{2}{\text{H}}_{5}^\bullet +{\text{C}}_{3}{\text{H}}_{7}^\bullet $$ (2)
which is another route of radical generation with an activation energy of 225 kJ/mol. This value is more than 100 kJ/mol lower than the activation energy for the step of propane dissociation into methyl and ethyl radicals. The effect of ethylene on dehydrogenation of another saturated alkane, ethane, was studied by Snytnikov et al. In our recent work [15], we demonstrated that radical generation during ethane pyrolysis in a mixture with ethylene proceeds in two steps. In the first step, collisions lead to the formation, from ethylene, of the ethylene biradical in the triplet state.
$$ {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 4} \to \,{}^{\bullet}{\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 4}^\bullet $$ (3)
The activation energy of this reaction is 253 kJ/mol, which agrees qualitatively with the data reported by Dombi et al. [13, 14]. Subsequent interaction of ethane with the ethylene biradical produces methyl and propyl radicals (Ea = 216 kJ/mol). The autocatalytic route of ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of ethylene is described by the equations:
$$ {\text{C}}_{2}{\text{H}}_{6}+{\text{C}}_{2}{\text{H}}_{4}\to2{\text{C}}_{2}{\text{H}}_{4}+{\text{H}}_{2} $$ (4)
$$ 2 {\text{C}}_{2} {\text{H}}_{6} + {\text{C}}_{2} {\text{H}}_{4} \to 2 {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 4} + 2{\text{CH}}_{4} $$ (5)
The question is whether propane dehydrogenation is also autocatalytic.
The purpose of this work was to develop the kinetic scheme with a limited number of elementary steps for describing the low-temperature gas-phase dehydrogenation of propane proceeding with high conversion at atmospheric pressure.
Experimental setup for studying ethane pyrolysis
The experimental setup for propane dehydrogenation [15] in the presence of ethylene includes a continuous CO2 laser with the wavelength λ = 10.6 μm and radiation power up to 130 W, a laser power recorder, a static quartz reactor with a reaction volume of 7 cm3, a gas flow generator for specifying the composition of the initial propane–ethylene mixture, and gas chromatographs for analyzing the initial gas mixture and the products of pyrolysis. The quartz reactor has three outlets: two are intended for washing the reactor with the initial propane–ethylene mixture, followed by locking, and the third outlet is used for sampling the gas mixture for chromatographic analysis. Thermal insulation of the reactor is not provided. The reaction zone is isolated from the reactor walls by part of gas mixture that is out of the laser beam. In the experiments, the temperature of the reactor walls did not exceed 400 K, which suggests that heterogeneous processes did not occur.
Temperature conditions of the laser reactor
Numerical solution of the problem of radial temperature distribution at bulk heat release with a power of 80 W indicates that the gas temperature at the reactor axis is 900–1050 K [16]. At these temperatures, propane dehydrogenation should be noticeable. The calculated temperature at the reactor axis depends only slightly on the wall temperature, which was varied over the range 300–600 K in the calculations. An increase in the heat release power from 50 to 100 W expands the high-temperature zone along the reactor radius rather than increasing the maximum temperature. At high hydrogen concentrations in the mixture, the thermal conductivity increases and the maximum temperature decreases by more than 100 K. The settling time of a thermal field was estimated to be 0.1–0.2 s [16].
ChemPak simulation
The primal problem of chemical kinetics was solved by using the ChemPak software package [17], which is intended for introducing and changing a set of equations for an unlimited number of chemical reactions. ChemPak enables finding of the right sides of ordinary differential equations (ODE) in universal notation of the algorithms operating on personal computers and parallel supercomputers. Methods for solving the high dimensionality ODE, which are included in the software package, provide sufficiently accurate solutions for rigid sets of ODE [18, 19].
Results and discussion
Gas-phase propane pyrolysis
Laser irradiation introduced directly into the gas made it possible to create gas-phase conditions for investigating the process of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of ethylene. Radiation energy was absorbed by ethylene. The reactants were heated to pyrolysis temperatures via collisional relaxation with other molecules.
The main products of propane dehydrogenation in a mixture with ethylene at atmospheric pressure were ethylene, methane, hydrogen, and propylene. Minor amounts of acetylene, ethane, C4, and heavier hydrocarbons were detected. Figure 1 shows the distribution of reaction products versus contact time for the initial propane–ethylene mixture with ethylene content 10 vol%. As seen from Fig. 1, left, the propane fraction decreased from 90 to 12 vol% by 7.5 s. In the process, the amount of ethylene increased from 10 to 27 vol%. Methane increased to 40 vol%, whereas hydrogen did not exceed 18 vol%. Propylene (Fig. 1, right) went above 8.4 vol% maximum; its fraction decreased to 1 vol% by 7.5 s. This figure also shows the distribution of acetylene and ethane, their fractions not exceeding 2 vol%.

Dehydrogenation of propane in pyrolytic furnaces
Thermal transformation of propane in pyrolytic furnaces is characterized by the prevalence of CH4 and C2H4 in the products. The hydrogen content is ca. 1/3 lower than the ethylene content. The propylene fraction attains 12 vol% at 70 % conversion.
As propane conversion increases, the amount of propylene decreases to 5 vol%. Table 1 lists data on industrial pyrolysis of propane [10] for 30, 70, and 94 % conversion with a contact time of 0.2–1.6 s in the temperature range 958–1100 K. The composition of the reaction mixture is presented in moles of the resulting product obtained from 100 mol of initial propane. The volume percentage composition of these products is indicated in parentheses.

For moderate conversions of propane, experimental data for the gas-phase conditions in the laser reactor were found to be close to those obtained in pyrolytic furnaces. For comparison purposes, Fig. 2 shows the distribution of ethylene and hydrogen versus propane conversion. The similarity of results for conversion up to 70 % gives grounds to suggest that pyrolysis in tube furnaces proceeds mainly in the gas phase.

The kinetics of propane pyrolysis
The mechanism of propane pyrolysis, including the steps of radical generation, chain propagation and termination, is illustrated by Scheme 1 [9]. In other work [10, 12, 20], this scheme is presented with slight variations in the set of chain termination steps.

A large spread of values is observed for both the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy. We used mainly the constants for elementary steps intended for a wide temperature range, 300–2500 K, according to NIST [21]. The elementary chemical steps with reaction constants are listed in Table 2.

Calculation of the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation by Scheme 1 for a temperature of 1000 K showed that the main products of propane pyrolysis were C3H6 and H2, which were produced as equal fractions. Another pair of products, CH4 and C2H4, was produced in smaller amounts, but also as equal fractions (Fig. 3). For a characteristic contact time of 2 s, propane conversion did not exceed 50 %, the fraction of propylene and hydrogen attained 20 vol%, and that of ethylene with methane, 17 vol%. However, this scheme does not agree with the experimental data.

Some changes to the scheme were proposed by Layokun and Slater [12]. They concluded that iso-C3H

need not be distinguished in the kinetic scheme of propane pyrolysis. A similar simplification of the kinetic scheme was made by Hinshelwood [22], who assumed fast transformation of iso-C3H

in the forward and backward directions. Kinetic dependences were calculated by Layokun and Slater [12] with a scheme not taking into account iso-C3H

and for a temperature of 700 °C and contact time up to 3 s. The fraction of each product in the reaction mixture—CH4, C2H4, C3H6, H2, and C2H6—at a contact time of 3 s were 30, 26, 19, 16, and 5 vol%, respectively. In the product distributions, the propylene fraction was overestimated and the amount of hydrogen was insufficient. Laidler [23] assumed that propylene formed from isopropyl radicals and ethylene from n-propyl radicals. Thus, for simulation of Scheme 1 it seems more promising to take into account both iso-C3H

radicals.
Empirically, in pyrolytic furnaces at 30 % conversion, 1 mol propane gives the following amounts of products:
$$ {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} \to 0. 5 2 {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 4} + 0. 5 3 {\text{CH}}_{ 4} + \, 0. 4 2 {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 6} + \, 0. 4 4 {\text{H}}_{ 2} + \, 0.0 4 {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 6} + \, 0.00 3 {\text{C}}_{ 4} {\text{H}}_{ 6} + \, 0.0 1 {\text{C}}_{ 4} {\text{H}}_{ 10} $$ (6)
Close values of the yields, 0.52 mol for ethylene and methane and 0.42 mol for propylene and hydrogen, imply that these paired products are produced in two independent cycles. Methane and ethylene can form in the chain propagation cycle with CH
•

as initial radical:
$$ {\text{CH}}_{ 3}^\bullet + {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} \to {\text{CH}}_{ 4} + \, {\text{n-C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 7}^\bullet$$ (7)
$$ {\text{n-C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 7}^\bullet \to {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 4} + {\text{CH}}_{ 3}^\bullet $$ (8)
Another cycle is suitable for the formation of propylene and hydrogen in reactions with H• as initial radical:
$$ {\text{H}}^\bullet + {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} \to {\text{H}}_{ 2} + {\text{iso-C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 7}^\bullet $$ (9)
$$ {\text{iso-C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 7}^\bullet \to {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 6} + {\text{H}}^\bullet $$ (10)
Scheme 1 includes the reactions that form cycles of ethylene with methane and propylene with hydrogen. The indicated products are obtained in these cycles (Fig. 3). However, the essential difference between calculated and experimental data makes it necessary to refine kinetic Scheme 1 for propane pyrolysis.
Autocatalytic scheme for low-temperature gas-phase dehydrogenation of propane
The radical chain mechanism of propane pyrolysis is initiated on radical generation by dissociation of C3H8 into methyl and ethyl radicals (eq. 1). CH
•

and H• are the initial radicals in chain propagation steps yielding the main products. The ethyl radical serves as a source of H•, dissociation of this radical leading to H• and ethylene. The formation of radicals by the propane dissociation reaction requires high temperatures to overcome the energy barrier (Table 2). A scheme of low-temperature gas-phase dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of ethylene at atmospheric pressure is proposed (Scheme 2):
Scheme 2
Autocatalytic dehydrogenation of propane

According to this scheme, the key reaction of radical generation is the propane–ethylene interaction step, n-propyl and ethyl radicals being produced by the two-step route: formation of the ethylene biradical and its interaction with propane. Generation of radicals via this route is energetically more advantageous compared with propane dissociation into methyl and ethyl radicals or into hydrogen and a propyl radical:
$$ {\text{C}}_{3} {\text{H}}_{8} \to \, {\text{n-C}}_{3} {\text{H}}_{7}^\bullet + {\text{H}}^\bullet $$ (11)
One of the routes of propane pyrolysis with formation of ethylene is recorded as the equation:
$$ {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} + {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 4} \to 2 {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 4} + {\text{CH}}_{ 4} , $$ (12)
which reflects the autocatalytic nature of the propane dehydrogenation mechanism.
During collisions with other molecules, ethylene turns into the active biradical species [15]. In the reaction with propane, the biradical forms propyl and ethyl radicals:
$$ {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} + {}^{\bullet}{\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 4}^\bullet \to \, n{\text{-C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 7}^\bullet + {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 5}^\bullet $$ (13)
The activation energy in this reaction is 268 kJ/mol (Dr S.E. Malykhin, personal communication).
The energy threshold Ea = 253 kJ/mol is related to formation of ethylene biradical. The activation energy for relaxation of the ethylene biradical to ethylene is close to zero.
The reaction of propane with the ethylene biradical proceeds with formation of propyl and ethyl radicals when chemical bonds in propane (C–H or C–C) are attacked by the biradical. In the first case, hydrogen is transferred to the ethylene biradical; in the second case, the C–C bond in propane is weakened and simultaneously the bond between carbon of the propane CH3 group and carbon of the ethylene biradical is formed.
The products of propane pyrolysis included not only CH4, C2H4, C3H6, and H2, but also ethane, acetylene, butane, butylene, and divinyl. The amount of each component in the reaction mixture did not exceed 1–2 vol%. The amount of butane was below 0.1 vol%, because C4H10 was consumed in the dehydrogenation reaction, yielding butylene. The reactions of ethane, acetylene, butane, butylene, and divinyl formation [24–26] and the constants [17] are reported elsewhere. C2H6 and C4H10 are synthesized from two propane molecules in the cycle:
$$ {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{5}^\bullet + {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} \to {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 6} + {\text{iso-C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 7}^\bullet $$ (14)
$$ {\text{iso-C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 7}^\bullet + {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} \to {\text{C}}_{ 4} {\text{H}}_{ 10} + {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 5}^\bullet $$ (15)
C2H
•

serves as a initial radical in this chain. Butene is produced from butane in a two-step cycle with H• as the initial radical:
$$ {\text{C}}_{ 4} {\text{H}}_{ 10} + {\text{H}}^\bullet \to {\text{C}}_{ 4} {\text{H}}_{ 9}^\bullet + {\text{H}}_{ 2} $$ (16)
$$ {\text{C}}_{ 4} {\text{H}}_{9}^\bullet \to {\text{C}}_{ 4} {\text{H}}_{ 8} + {\text{H}}^\bullet $$ (17)
Butadiene (divinyl) is always present in the reaction mixture. It is produced in a cycle with H• as the initial radical:
$$ {\text{C}}_{ 4} {\text{H}}_{ 8} + {\text{H}}^\bullet \to {\text{H}}_{ 2} + {\text{C}}_{ 4} {\text{H}}_{ 7}^\bullet $$ (18)
$$ {\text{C}}_{ 4} {\text{H}}_{ 7}^\bullet \to {\text{C}}_{ 4} {\text{H}}_{ 6} + {\text{H}}^\bullet $$ (19)
H2 is accumulated because of the two latter cycles; this results in deviation of the C3H6 content from the H2 content in the reaction products.
In propane dehydrogenation processes, the C3H6 content was no higher than 12 vol%. The fact that theoretical schemes overestimate the propylene content of the products of propane pyrolysis compared with experiments was noted earlier. Koike and Gardlner [27] transformed propylene to the C3H5 • radical, which then dissociated into acetylene and the methyl radical. Overall, their scheme includes 45 reactions. According to this scheme, the main products are methane, which exceeds 40 vol% maximum and decreases to 36 vol%, and H2, which increases to 36 vol%. In the process, ethylene and propylene, which amount to up to 20 vol% in the initial step, are completely consumed for the synthesis of other products.
In Scheme 2, the transformation of propylene into acetylene occurs in the cycle with a methyl radical:
$$ {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 6} + {\text{CH}}_{ 3}^\bullet \to {\text{CH}}_{ 4} + {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 5}^\bullet $$ (20)
$$ {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 5}^\bullet \to {\text{CH}}_{ 3}^\bullet + {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 2} $$ (21)
Figure 4 illustrates results from the calculation in which reaction of the ethylene biradical and propane yielding the C2H5 • and C3H7 • radicals serves as a radical generation step. The composition of the initial gas mixture used in the calculation was 3 % C2H4 and 97 % C3H8. The calculation describes satisfactorily the data obtained experimentally [10]. In the calculation, by 1.5–2 s the CH4 content reached 34 vol%, C2H4–27 vol%, H2–20 vol%, and C3H6–12 vol%, the fraction of small components not exceeding 2–3 vol%. The induction period was 0.5 s. Lowering the temperature to 900 K increases the induction period to ca. 7 s. In our reactor, it is difficult to obtain the induction period experimentally because it is comparable with the time needed for establishing thermal fields in the reactor after the onset of irradiation.

In the calculation based on Scheme 2, an increase of ethylene content in the reaction mixture facilitates transformation of C2H4 to the biradical, which starts to build up at propane conversions above 60 %. The relaxation constant for the ethylene biradical was obtained by quantum-chemical calculations as 2.08 × T × 1010 s−1 [15]. The transformation of propane does not proceed with such a value of the constant; so, the reaction of biradical relaxation is taken into account with an effective rate constant equal to 10 s−1. The initial ethylene content of 3 vol% and use of atmospheric pressure for the process result in predominant conversion of the ethylene biradical in the reactions with propane before its relaxation to molecular ethylene.
Chain termination steps
The introduction of all chain termination steps according to Scheme 1 suppresses almost completely the cycle leading to ethylene and methane.
$$ {\text{H}}^\bullet + {\text{iso-C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 7}^\bullet \to {\text{H}}_{ 2} + {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 6} $$ (22)
$$ {\text{H}}^\bullet + {\text{H}} ^\bullet \to {\text{H}}_{ 2} $$ (23)
$$ {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 5}^\bullet + {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 5}^\bullet \to {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 4} + {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 6} $$ (24)
$$ {\text{H}}^\bullet + {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 5}^\bullet \to {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 6} $$ (25)
$$ {\text{CH}}_{ 3}^\bullet + {\text{CH}}_{ 3}^\bullet \to {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 6} $$ (26)
$$ {\text{CH}}_{3}^\bullet + {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 5}^\bullet \to {\text{CH}}_{ 4} + {\text{C}}_{ 2} {\text{H}}_{ 4} $$ (27)
As shown by calculations, the fraction of ethylene and methane becomes predominant when the scheme includes two steps of chain termination with CH3 and H radicals in reactions with ethyl radical. When reaction (25) is replaced by reaction (24) of loss of C2H5 by pairwise collision, this does not change the calculation results.
Conclusion
Gas-phase dehydrogenation of propane can be described well as a process involving autocatalysis by ethylene, the catalytic properties of which result from its ability to transform into a biradical, as has been shown elsewhere [15]. Compared with the complex, many-step routes proposed so far [8], the simple kinetic scheme proposed here fits the experimental data well. The scheme consists of 19 elementary steps that form six cycles of chain propagation to yield the products. The autocatalytic feature of the proposed kinetic scheme is shown to be essential for initial radical generation and, therefore, for the radical chain-initiation steps.
