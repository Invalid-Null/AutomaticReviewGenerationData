The document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation, as it does not discuss converting propane to propylene. The abstract mentions investigating the addition of sulfur to Pt/alumina catalysts and its effect on catalyst activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation, but the document does not provide any specific details about propane to propylene conversion.
