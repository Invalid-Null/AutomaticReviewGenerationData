Utilization of e-wastes as a sustainable silica source in synthesis of ordered mesostructured titania nanocomposites with high adsorption and photoactivity
The production of electronic waste (e-waste) is rapidly increasing globally. This waste is not effectively used at present. Moreover, few studies have investigated the synthesis of photocatalytic materials using materials recovered from e-waste. This paper reports the synthesis of a nanosized TiO2 catalyst supported on mesoporous Mobil Composition of Matter No. 41 (MCM-41). Sodium silicate precursor extracted from e-waste was used as a silicon source for the synthesis of an MCM-41 support. Transmission electron microscopy images revealed that TiO2 was successfully embedded in the pores of MCM-41. The particle size and crystalline structure of TiO2 was controlled by the mesostructured MCM-41 support. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms confirmed that TiO2/MCM-41 had uniform pore size (2.83 nm), a large pore volume (0.757 cm3/g), and high surface area (947 m2/g). The purity of TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 was as high as 99.90 wt%. The influences of TiO2 ratio, calcination temperature, and catalyst weight on the efficiency of methylene blue photodegradation were investigated. Different proportions of titanium species deposited on the MCM-41 surface resulted in the formation of differently sized TiO2 particles and strongly influenced the adsorption and photocatalytic activity. The TiO2/MCM-41 composite synthesized from e-waste had higher photocatalytic performance than TiO2/silica gel and pure TiO2. The composite catalyst had a combination of features that ensured high photocatalytic activity: small TiO2 particles, effective dispersion of TiO2 on the mesoporous silica, and high adsorptive efficiency. The proposed method, using an environmentally friendly approach, can reduce the accumulation of e-waste and produce highly valuable photocatalyst composites for environmental uses.
1. Introduction
In the past two decades, the global electronics industry has grown rapidly. However, the generation of waste electrical and electronic equipment (e-waste) has also increased considerably. The global production of e-waste was expected to approach 52.2 million tons by 2021 and is anticipated to double by 2045 [1], [2]. Typical e-waste includes old refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines, televisions, computers, mobile phones, and printers [3]. Conventional practices for treating e-waste are reuse, repair, incineration, and landfilling [4]. Presently, only 13% of e-waste can be reutilized or recycled [5]. E-waste can release toxic matter when incinerated and consumes space when sent to a landfill. To ensure human health and maintain the natural environment, e-waste must be recovered and reused to create a circular economy. Large amounts of electronic packaging materials are used to protect electronic devices such as integrated circuits. The typical components of electronic packaging material include silica, phenol resin, and epoxy resin [6]. Resin residues comprise 30–50 wt% of all raw materials used in packaging for integrated circuits. The increase in demand for electronic products has resulted in an increased amount of resin waste. The efficient treatment of packaging resin waste is thus a major environmental issue. Packaging resin waste is approximately 80 wt% silica and thus an abundant resource of silica for large-scale synthesis of MCM-41 mesoporous molecular sieves [7]. MCM-41 benefits the synthesis of high-quality photocatalyst composites such as TiO2/MCM-41.
Titanium dioxide is a large-band-gap semiconductor and highly efficient photocatalytic agent. This material has numerous applications such as environmental purification of industrial wastewater and hazardous gases [8], [9], generation of hydrogen gas [10], production of photocatalytic fuel cells [11], and production of biosensors [12]. Nevertheless, TiO2 particles are small (~30 nm); their photocatalytic performance is thus limited by the possibility of TiO2 particle aggregation [13]. Additionally, the recovery of such small catalyst particles is difficult when using conventional filtration methods. Therefore, introducing TiO2 into a porous support material has attracted much interest because the composite has higher active surface area than pure TiO2, resulting in higher photocatalytic efficiency. Mesotructured silica, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15, is the most appropriate catalyst support because it has an ordered framework, high pore volume, and large surface area [14], [15], [16], [17]. Typically, smaller TiO2 particles have stronger photoactivity. MCM-41 is a silica molecular sieve material with a hexagonal structure and narrow pore size distribution. The nanopores can confine the growth of TiO2 particles. Small (<10 nm) TiO2 nanoparticles have outstanding photocatalytic activity. MCM-41 can effectively control the uniformity of TiO2 particle sizes and prevent agglomeration of the catalyst.
To enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, scholars have employed various types of support material for dispersing TiO2 particles. Wei et al. [18] prepared a TiO2/SBA-15 nanocatalyst and discovered that the composite had a large surface area. The material had higher photocatalytic efficiency than pure TiO2 because of the outstanding adsorption behavior of SBA-15. Hosseini and Faghihian [19] prepared a TiO2/FSM-16 photocatalyst. They observed that the band gap energy of the TiO2 shifted to a lower energy. Therefore, the photodegradation activity of the material was considerably enhanced. Badvi and Javanbakht [20] used the sol-gel method to disperse TiO2 on the surface of ZSM-5 zeolite. The catalyst was also modified with nickel nanoparticles. The optimal photocatalytic efficiency was observed for the catalyst with calcination temperature of 600 °C and nickel additive amount of 0.5%. Conde-Rivera et al. [21] synthesized TiO2 supported by activated carbon. The activated carbon was prepared from tire waste, and 93% removal of ibuprofen was achieved; this result was mainly ascribed to adsorption. Kadi et al. [22] prepared a Pt-loaded TiO2-Al-MCM-41 photocatalyst by using a multistep route. The incorporation of Pt nanoparticles into the catalyst composite improved the light spectrum response and enhanced the CN− removal efficiency.
A suitable support can be used to control TiO2 particle growth and thus prevent aggregation. In this study, we used MCM-41 silica with an adjustable pore size as the support material. A TiO2 nanocatalyst was then incorporated into the mesopores of the MCM-41 by using a chemical method. Sodium silicate obtained from electronic packaging resin waste through alkali extraction was used as the precursor for the synthesis of MCM-41. The raw materials used in the commercial manufacture of sodium silicate are sodium carbonate and quartz sand. However, the reaction is performed at approximately 1300 °C and thus consumes considerable energy [23]. By contrast, sodium silicate obtained from packaging resin waste is cheap and can be a low-cost source for the mass manufacture of MCM-41. In other studies, packaging resin waste was used as a raw material in the synthesis of MCM-48 and MCM-41 [24], [25]. In this experiment, electronic packaging resin waste was employed to synthesize a TiO2/MCM-41 composite. The influence of various reaction parameters—TiO2 ratio, calcination temperature, and catalyst weight—on the adsorption and decomposition of methylene blue (MB) was examined. Experiments were also conducted to compare the photocatalytic activity of the composite with that of pure TiO2 and that of TiO2 supported by silica gel.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
The raw material used in this study, electronic packaging resin waste, was obtained from an electronic packaging factory (Siliconwave Precision Co., Taiwan). The fundamental components and characteristics of the waste were reported by Liou [6], [7]. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide [C16H33(CH3)3NBr, CTAB], titanium butoxide [Ti(OBu)4], and MB were purchased from Acros Organics. Isopropanol was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Acetylacetone was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Company (Tokyo, Japan). Nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, and sulfuric acid were purchased from Merck. Mixed gas (79% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, 99.995%) was purchased from Sun Fu Company.
2.2. Alkali extraction of silica from packaging resin waste
The process used for extraction of silica followed that used in previous studies [26]. The resin waste was first ground into powder. The powder was burned in air at 800 °C to eliminate organic substances, producing packaging resin ash (PRA). The PRA was heated in hydrochloric acid to eliminate metallic components. A neutral solid was obtained through water washing and filtration. Then, 50 g of PRA was placed in 4.0 M sodium hydroxide solution. The solution was placed in an oven at 100 °C for 6 h under agitation. The ash was transformed into a sodium silicate solution and then collected through filtration. Finally, we used deionized water to dilute the sodium silicate solution to 2.0 M.
2.3. Synthesis of mesoporous MCM-41 support
Hydrothermal treatment was used to synthesize mesoporous MCM-41 [24]. 1.82 g of CTAB was added to 32 mL of deionized water. The sodium silicate (extracted from PRA) was placed in the CTAB solution, and 1.0 M sulfuric acid solution was subsequently added. The solution’s pH was recorded using a S20-k pH meter (Metter Toledo). The pH was then modified using an appropriate amount of sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide. Subsequently, the mixture was placed in an autoclave and heated at 100 °C for 48 h. After the mixture was filtered, washed, and dried, the resultant white precipitate was calcined in air at 550 °C for 6 h. The product, which had the characteristic structure of MCM-41, is denoted PRA-MCM-41.
In the silica gel synthesis process, sodium silicate was added to 2.0 M sulfuric acid solution [26]. The pH was adjusted to 3, and the solution was then heated at 60 °C for 24 h. The sediment was washed, dried, and ground to obtain a gel product.
2.4. Synthesis of TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 photocatalyst
Nanoparticles of TiO2 catalyst in the presence of a PRA-MCM-41 support were synthesized through a sol-gel method [27]. First, a fixed amount of Ti(OBu)4 was dissolved in a mixed solution of isopropanol and acetylacetone under constant stirring. Isopropanol and deionized water were then added slowly to the titanium solution. After the hydrolysis and precipitation reactions had occurred, the white precipitate [Ti(OH)4] was rinsed thoroughly. We added PRA-MCM-41 to a solution consisting of the white precipitate and deionized water. Thereafter, 0.5 M nitric acid was added dropwise, and the mixture was heated with reflux at 85 °C for 12 h. Finally, the solid was washed with water, centrifuged, and dried in an oven. The specimens were collected and then calcined at different temperatures between 300 and 700 °C for 2 h in an air environment. The resultant product is expressed as TiO2/PRA-MCM-41.
TiO2/silica gel and pure TiO2 were synthesized using the same steps, except silica gel was used instead of PRA-MCM-41 or no support was used, respectively.
2.5. Photoactivity testing of the catalyst specimens
MB was used to estimate the photodegradation ability of the synthesized catalyst materials. 250 mg of TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 was placed in 200 mL of 50 μM MB solution. The pH was adjusted to 3.85 by using diluted sulfuric acid solution. The performances of TiO2/silica gel and pure TiO2 were compared with that of the tested catalyst. To reach the adsorption equilibrium, the mixture was agitated in the dark for 15 min. The photodegradation of MB was performed using a 6-W 254-nm ultraviolet (UV) lamp (UVP UVG-54) with an intensity of light of 0.90 ± 0.01 mW/cm2. Suspension specimens were collected at fixed time intervals. After filtration and centrifugation, the concentration of MB (C/Co) was determined using a Genesys spectrophotometer (Thermo Electron Corporation). Co and C are the initial concentration of MB and the concentration at various illumination times, respectively. The maximum absorbance at 666 nm was used to estimate the concentration of MB. A blank experiment was also conducted in which no catalyst was added; the MB concentration was determined using the same procedure. The total organic carbon (TOC) was measured using a Shimadzu TOC-LCPN analyzer. The TOC removal rate (RTOC, %) was evaluated according to the formula [28]:
(1)
To and Tt (mg/L) are the TOC values at the beginning and at time t.
The stability of the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 catalyst was investigated by performing reutilization experiments. The used catalysts were collected by centrifugation after MB photodegradation, washed with deionized water and ethanol. The solids were calcined in air oven to remove any residual organic molecules. The regenerated catalysts were used to degrade a fresh MB solution under the same conditions. The process was repeated four times.
2.6. Surface analysis of catalyst specimens
The metal elements in the catalyst specimens were inspected using inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Kontrin Plasmakon, model S-35). A N2 sorption device (Micrometric, ASAP 2010) was employed at − 196 °C to measure the pore size distribution, pore volume, and surface area. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to evaluate the surface area. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda model was employed to calculate the pore size distribution. We assumed that mesopores have width 2–50 nm.
The mesophase (low angle of 1–10°) and crystalline phase (broad angle of 10–80°) of the specimens were analyzed using powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD; PANalytical, model X′pert pro system) and Cu-kα radiation. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis of the catalyst specimens were performed using a JSM-6700 F (JEOL) microscope. The functional groups in the specimens were determined using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR; Shimadzu, model FTIR-8300). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL, model JEM-1200CX II) images were obtained to estimate the particle size distribution of the TiO2 cached into the MCM-41 support. The weight loss of specimens during calcination was examined using thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (Mettler, model TGA/SDTA851e). The heating rate was set at 10 °C/min. W/Wo expresses the residual mass ratio of a specimen. UV–vis spectra were collected on a Jasco UV/Vis spectrometer (model V-570) in the wavelength range of 250–500 nm. The surface elemental composition analyse was measured based on the EscaLab 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Analysis of the metal components of the catalyst specimens
The metal impurities in the various catalyst samples were identified using ICP-MS (Table 1). Cr, Al, Fe, and Sb were the main components in the resin waste. The concentration of Sb was highest. When MCM-41 was prepared from PRA, the amount of metallic impurities was clearly reduced due to the elimination of metal ions through acid leaching and calcination [24]. The purity of the PRA-MCM-41 sample was 99.82 wt%. The amount of impurities in pure TiO2 was lower than that in PRA-MCM-41. The pure TiO2 had purity of 99.96 wt%. Furthermore, TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 contained more impurities than the pure TiO2. These impurities persisted because residual metals in the PRA were not easily removed. The purity of the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 catalyst was as high as 99.90 wt%.

3.2. Synthesis of mesoporous catalyst support
The influence of solution pH on the BET surface area of the support samples is illustrated in Fig. 1a. The highest surface area, 1033 m2/g, was obtained at pH 11 and the lowest surface area, 193 m2/g, occurred at pH 5. In a strongly basic environment (pH 11), the electrostatic interaction between positively charged CTA+ micelles and negatively charged silica resulted in MCM-41 with mesoporous structure [29]. The high surface area was due to the highly-ordered and hexagonal array of silica pores. When the pH was decreased to 9 and to 7, the surface area was reduced because of the decrease in negatively charged density of silica in the weakly basic environment. Consequently, the surface of the silica was covered with excess CTA+, which obstructed the evolution of the pore structure. The lowest surface area occurring at pH 5 may have been because of the disappearance of micelles under the weakly acidic condition. No mesoporous structure corresponded to low surface area. The increase in surface area when the pH was decreased to 3 or 1 may have been due to reconstruction of a mesoporous framework in the strongly acidic medium [30]. The porous structure began to convert into a regular array, causing an increase in the surface area of the product.

The effect of solution pH on the yield of PRA samples is illustrated in Fig. 1b. The silica yield was expressed as follows: mass of mesoporous silica generated after calcination divided by mass of PRA specimen. In this study, the highest silica yield was obtained at pH 5. A high degree of polycondensation of silicate species occurred in a weakly acidic environment, resulting in more silica [24]. By contrast, the silicate species were partly dissolved when in a strongly basic environment. Thus, the silica yield decreased with increasing solution pH.
The small-angle XRD patterns of specimens at pH 1–11 are presented in Fig. 1c and d. The XRD pattern obtained for the pH 11 specimen has peaks at (100), (110), (200), and (210), which are typical of MCM-41 materials [31]. For the specimens with pH 9 and pH 7, the intensity of the peaks was considerably lower than for pH 11; thus, highly-ordered mesoporous silica forms in a strongly basic environment. The XRD pattern obtained for pH 5 does not contain any characteristic peaks due to degradation of the ordered array of the mesoporous structure. An intense (100) reflection is present in the pattern for pH 1, and this reflection is characteristic of a mesophasic structure. Thus, some atomic rearrangement occurred under strongly acidic conditions. The pores were transferred to an ordered framework [32].
3.3. Observation of catalysts’ crystalline phase, composition, and photoabsorption property
Fig. 2a presents the wide-angle XRD patterns obtained for pure TiO2 and TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 specimens calcined at temperatures between 300 and 700 °C. The XRD pattern of pure TiO2 indicates that rutile was the only titania phase. No phase was detected for TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 samples calcined at 300 or 400 °C; however, a broad peak was present at 2θ = 20–30°, indicating the formation of amorphous silica [33]. For calcination temperatures beyond 500 °C, stronger peaks corresponding to the anatase phase appeared, confirming an increase in TiO2 grain size within the MCM-41 support. No rutile phase was observed for the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 sample calcined at 700 °C. An increase of the calcination temperature generally enhances the formation of TiO2 in the rutile structure. However, the anatase phase of the supported TiO2 samples had relatively high thermal stability. A previous study reported that the critical size of TiO2 for the phase transition from anatase to rutile was in the range 40–50 nm [34]. On this basis, the pore size (<10 nm) of MCM-41 can be concluded to have prevented the formation of rutile TiO2.

Fig. 2. (a) XRD analysis of pure TiO2 and TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 (molar ratio of 3/7) at different calcination temperatures. (b) FTIR spectra of TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 catalysts at different calcination temperatures.
The FTIR spectra of the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 specimens obtained at calcination temperatures of 300–700 °C are presented in Fig. 2b. The wide band between 3200 and 3700 cm−1 is related to the surface silanols and physical adsorption of water [35]. The band at 475 cm−1 corresponds to Si–O–Si vibration. The Si–H stretching band is present at 805 cm−1. The band corresponding to the Si–OH bond is present at 970 cm−1. The band at 1115 cm−1 is related to Si–O vibration, whereas that at 940 cm−1 is related to the Si–O–Ti bond [36]. In all spectra, the intensity of bands was greater for samples with higher calcination temperatures.
The TG curves presented in Fig. 3a indicate that weight loss occurring at lower than 150 °C was due to water evaporation. The weight loss decreased slowly with an increase of the reaction temperature. Thus, longer heating time were necessary for the discharge of volatile substances from the pores of high-porosity MCM-41 structures. The TG curves also reveal that the weight loss of the samples increased with increasing TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratio from 3/7–7/3 because only a small amount of titanium precursor could be retained in the silica matrix at a low molar ratio. The differential TG curves presented in Fig. 3b reveal two mass loss stage with maximum temperatures at 70 °C and 310 °C. The peak height increased with an increase in the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratio. The same observation was reported by Liou et al. [37] for the thermal decomposition of TiO2/SBA-15 in air.

Fig. 3. Thermogravimetric analysis curves of un-calcined TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 specimens.
Fig. 4a shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 with various molar ratios. The photodegradation ability of TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 increases with decreasing TiO2 loading. The TiO2/ PRA-MCM-41 ratios of 3/7 and 5/5 shows a broad adsorption peak in the wavelength region of 250 – 400 nm, indicating the intrinsic band gap absorption of anatase TiO2 [38]. However, a narrow adsorption peak at about 300 nm is observed for TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratios of 7/3 and 9/1. TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratios have a great effect on particle size of TiO2, as seen in later SEM and TEM observations. When TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratio decreases from 9/1–3/7, particle size of TiO2 decreases. The smaller particle size of TiO2 with higher crystallization, which leads to improvement of its photocatalytic activity. Fig. 4b shows the XPS O1s spectrum of TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 composite. The O1s spectrum consists of three peaks: Ti–O–Ti (528.8 eV), Ti–O–Si (532.7 eV), and Si–O–Si (534.3 eV). Based on the results, the peak at 532.7 eV indicates Ti–O–Si formation between TiO2 and MCM-41 and is consistent with the FTIR results. The Ti–O–Si species can increase the TiO2 surface acidity, leading to the formation of numerous surface adsorption sites and enhancement of the photoactivity of the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 catalysts [39].

3.4. Observation of the catalysts’ pore characteristics
The pore characteristics determined through the nitrogen adsorption experiment are presented in Fig. 5. For all samples, the isotherms were of type IV in the international union of pure and applied chemistry (IUPAC) classification, indicating a typical mesostructure [40]. Fig. 5a presents the isotherms of the PRA-MCM-41 and pure TiO2 specimens. That of the pure TiO2 exhibits a hysteresis loop analogous to H1. This observation was probably related to the aggregation of TiO2 particles giving rise to large mesopores. The isotherm of PRA-MCM-41 shows a hysteresis loop of type H2. Capillary condensation of nitrogen was revealed by a sudden increase in the adsorbed volume at P/Po = 0.2–0.3, indicating the formation of a uniform pore structure [41]. Fig. 5b displays the pore size distribution of the PRA-MCM-41 and pure TiO2 samples. The pure TiO2 specimen had a wide range of pore distributions (between 20 and 45 nm) implying the existence of coarse mesopores. PRA-MCM-41 had a narrow peak of 2.73 nm, indicating a uniform mesoporous structure.

Fig. 5c displays the isotherms of the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 specimens obtained using different TiO2 ratios. The adsorbed volume decreased with an increase of the TiO2 ratio, indicating a decrease in pore volume. The isotherms of the samples for TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratios 3/7 and 5/5 have a well-defined step at P/P0 = 0.2–0.3, suggesting uniform pore diameters. No clear differences were observed in the shape of the isotherms between PRA-MCM-41 and TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 for a ratio of 3/7. However, the adsorbed volume of TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 for the ratio 3/7 was smaller than that for PRA-MCM-41. The isotherm of the sample of TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 at the ratio 9/1 has a similar shape to that of the pure TiO2 due to the incorporation of considerable TiO2 into the PRA-MCM-41 resulting in a change in the shape of the hysteresis loop. The pore size distribution of the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 samples is presented in Fig. 5d. The TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 samples obtained using ratios from 3/7–7/3 had a narrow distribution of pore diameters (2.05–2.83 nm). The pore diameters of the sample for the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratio of 3/7 approached those for PRA-MCM-41, suggesting that TiO2 particles were fully dispersed among the pores of PRA-MCM-41. However, the isotherm of the sample obtained using a TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratio of 9/1 has a peak of width approximately 23.49 nm. This observation indicated that the aggregation of considerable TiO2 on the surface of the silica support led to a widening of the pore distribution. The surface area and pore analysis of PRA and the catalyst specimens are presented in Table 2. The pore volume and surface area of PRA were only 0.006 cm3/g and 2.72 m2/g, respectively. The specimen had macropores. The total pore volume of PRA-MCM-41 was 0.887 cm3/g and surface area was 1033 m2/g. The pore volume and surface area of pure TiO2 (0.372 cm3/g and 49 m2/g) were much lower than those of PRA-MCM-41. For TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 samples, the pore volume and surface area increased if the TiO2 ratio was decreased. Some of the TiO2 particles thus moved into the pores of MCM-41, leading to a reduction in pore volume and surface area. The surface area of the sample obtained using a TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratio of 3/7 approached that of PRA-MCM-41, which may be attributed to small-particle TiO2 being introduced into PRA-MCM-41 without destroying the silica’s pore structure (as confirmed by the TEM observation). However, the surface area decreased greatly if the TiO2 ratio was increased to 9/1, which may have been due to large TiO2 particles tending to agglomerate outside the silica pores. This blockage of pore openings may have decreased the catalyst’s surface area. The pure TiO2 had the highest mesoporosity—99.73%. The mesopore fractions of the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 catalysts increased from 87.83% to 98.19% if the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratio was increased from 5/5–9/1.

The lengths of unit cell parameter of TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 samples were in the range between 4.02 and 4.25 nm, decreasing with increasing the TiO2 molar ratio. The observation indicated that an increase in TiO2 content led to a decrease in the lattice parameters. The crystallite size of TiO2 in TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 was calculated according to the Scherrer formula [39]:

3.5. Observation of the catalysts’ surface morphology
Fig. 6 presents FE-SEM micrographs of the catalyst powders. Fig. 6a presents the appearance of PRA-MCM-41 and indicates it had high porosity. The material consisted of irregularly shaped grains of size 200–350 nm, as displayed in Fig. 6b. Fig. 6c reveals that the pure TiO2 had appeared as aggregations of small particles. The pure TiO2 comprised homogeneous grains approximately 30 nm in width, as depicted in Fig. 6d. The surface morphology of the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 samples with molar ratios 9/1 and 7/3 is presented in Fig. 6e–h. Fig. 6e and Fig. 6g indicate that the TiO2 particles were aggregated and compactly covered the exterior of the MCM-41. This covering probably caused the low adsorbable surface area of the silica support and poor TiO2 dispersion. The pure TiO2 particles (Fig. 6d) were larger than the TiO2 particles attached to the PRA-MCM-41 surface (Fig. 6f and Fig. 6h). The surface morphology of the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 samples with molar ratios 5/5 and 3/7 is displayed in Fig. 6i–l. Fig. 6i and Fig. 6k reveal a distinguishable profile of PRA-MCM-41 particles. Fig. 6j and Fig. 6l indicate that small TiO2 grains were well-dispersed on the exterior of the PRA-MCM-41, reducing the degree of TiO2 aggregation and enhance the material’s photoactivity. Fig. 7 presents the EDX analysis for different proportions of TiO2 powder deposited on the PRA-MCM-41 support. The spectra indicate that SiO2 and TiO2 were the major components of the catalyst composites. The intensity of peaks corresponding to silicon decrease with increasing TiO2 loading, whereas the peaks corresponding to titanium exhibit the opposite trend. For lower TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratios of 5/5 and 3/7, the peaks corresponding to titanium could not be clearly observed. This result may be due to the decrease in the TiO2 mass fraction. Table 3 shows the weight and atomic percentages of the O, Si, and Ti elements in the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 composites by using EDX analysis. Results indicate that the weight percentage of Ti element is increased with increasing the TiO2 molar ratio. For all samples, the amounts of TiO2 measured using EDX analysis are obviously lower than the actual loading of TiO2 in the catalyst. The observation is because that EDX analysis only measures the element component on the surface of catalyst. However, most of the TiO2 particles are loaded within the ordered channels of the supports, as seen in later TEM observations.

Fig. 8 displays TEM micrographs of the catalyst samples. Fig. 8a reveals that the PRA-MCM41 particles had hexagonal and large-scale structure (>150 nm) [43]. XRD analysis verified that the pore structure was a regular array of uniform mesopores. A well-ordered array with uniform pore size in the porous framework was also observed in the (100) direction (Fig. 8b) and kept parallel of pore channels in the (110) direction (Fig. 8c). Each pore was encircled by six neighboring pores. The pore diameter of PRA-MCM-41 was 2.50 nm, which approached the calculated value of 2.73 nm when pore size measurement was performed (Fig. 5b). The interaction between silicate species and surfactant micelles through self-assembly established the hexagonal arrangement of pores. A TEM micrograph of the pure TiO2 sample is presented in Fig. 8d; the particle size was almost 30 nm. Fig. 8e and f present TEM micrographs of TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 samples obtained using molar ratios 9/1 and 7/3, respectively. A large amount of TiO2 covered the external surface of the PRA-MCM-41. The approximate size of the TiO2, determined using TEM, was 8–10 nm. Fig. 8g and h present TEM micrographs of the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 samples obtained using the molar ratios 5/5 and 3/7, respectively. Numerous TiO2 particles grew within the silica’s pore structure. The small TiO2 nanoparticles were randomly dispersed in the pores of MCM-41. Furthermore, no destruction of the mesopore framework of MCM-41 was observed. The approximate size of the TiO2 particles was 2–3 nm. The TEM images suggest that bigger TiO2 particles accompanied higher TiO2 loading. Smaller TiO2 particles generally have higher photocatalytic activity. For MCM-41 with a TiO2 ratio smaller than 30%, TiO2 crystal growth can be controlled within the mesoporous channels to obtain optimal photocatalytic performance.

3.6. Photoactivity testing of the catalyst samples
3.6.1. Estimation of photoactivity
Fig. 9 presents the two stages of the activity testing experiment. First, the catalyst was mixed with dye under stirring and without light irradiation for 15 min. UV light or no light was then used to irradiate the mixture for 180 min Fig. 9a depicts the degradation of MB by using various catalyst samples without UV light irradiation. During the initial 15 min, the MB concentration decreased rapidly and then plateaued due to the adsorptive saturation of MB on the surface of the catalyst. The time required to reach the adsorption equilibrium was thus approximately 15 min. For the pure TiO2 sample, consumption of dye was not observed. However, the amount of MB adsorbed was much higher when using a TiO2/silica gel or TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 sample. TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 clearly had higher adsorption capability than TiO2/silica gel.

Fig. 9b presents the degradation of MB by using various catalysts and exposing the mixture to UV light for 180 min. The MB concentration decreased for two reasons: adsorption and photodecomposition of MB on the catalyst’s surface [44]. A blank experiment was conducted in which no catalyst was added; no significant photodegradation was observed in this test. For the pure TiO2 sample, the MB concentration decreased slightly; this result was probably due to the agglomeration of TiO2 nanoparticles. The TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 and TiO2/silica gel catalysts had higher efficiency for elimination of MB than pure TiO2 did. The hybrid catalyst’s high surface area and favorable dispersion of TiO2 particles resulted in high photocatalytic activity [27]. Furthermore, the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 sample, which had greater surface area, exhibited higher capability in elimination of the dye than TiO2/silica gel did.
3.6.2. Photodegradation of MB on TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 catalysts
Fig. 10a displays the effects of the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratio on the degradation of MB. Decreasing the TiO2 ratio significantly improved the adsorption and photodegradation activity of the catalyst. For high TiO2 loading, the large size of the TiO2 particles may have blocked the pores of MCM-41 (as shown by TEM images). This situation resulted in a decrease of the adsorption capacity and photocatalytic activity. Conversely, for low TiO2 content, the TiO2 particles could be effectively dispersed across the MCM-41 support because they were small. PRA-MCM-41, which had large surface area, provided numerous adsorption sites. The MB concentration was highest around the TiO2 particles, resulting in high photocatalytic activity [45]. The sample obtained using a TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratio of 3/7 exhibited the highest photocatalytic efficiency.

The photodegradation of MB on the composite catalysts synthesized at various calcination temperatures is presented in Fig. 10b. An increase in the calcination temperature was discovered to enhance the adsorption efficiency and photocatalytic activity. TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 calcined at 700 °C had the highest ability to photodegrade MB. Both particle size and TiO2 crystal structure may affect photocatalytic ability. XRD analysis (Fig. 2a) revealed that TiO2 with the more stable anatase structure was formed at higher calcination temperatures. Therefore, the catalytic activity could be increased by increasing the calcination temperature. However, increasing the calcination temperature can lead to a slight increase in size of TiO2 particles, causing a reduction of catalytic activity. Despite the large TiO2 particles of samples calcinated at 700 °C, the catalyst’s crystal structure had a stronger photocatalytic effect on MB elimination than its particle size.
Fig. 10c indicates that the MB photodegradation rate clearly increased if the catalyst’s weight was increased. After light irradiation for 180 min, MB was completely eliminated for a catalyst with weight 450 mg. As presented in Fig. 10c, catalysts with higher weight had higher adsorption ability. The amount of MB adsorbed was 65% after the first 15 min of agitation without light irradiation for 450 mg of catalyst. These heavier catalysts had more adsorption sites for elimination of the dye.
Fig. 10d shows the percentage of TOC removal rate of the MB dye at the end of the experiments with different TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratios. The pure TiO2 (molar ratio of 1/0) showed the lowest TOC removal rate of MB (15%). The TOC removal rate of MB increased with decreasing the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratio. Better results of TOC removal rate were observed for sample at TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratio of 3/7. The TOC removal rate of the sample reached 80%.
3.6.3. Evaluation of the degradation rate in the photocatalytic reaction
In a kinetics study, the adsorption of MB onto the photocatalyst’s surface must be considered. The photocatalytic oxidation of organic matter can be expressed using the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model [46], [47]:
(3)
where ka is the adsorption coefficient and kr is the reaction rate constant for MB adsorption on the surface of TiO2/PRA-MCM-41. For low MB concentrations (C) Eq. (3) can be simplified as follows:
(4)
By integrating Eq. (4) from 0 to t, we obtain
(5)
where Co is the MB concentration before photocatalysis, Ct is the MB concentration at time t during light irradiation, and kapp is the apparent rate constant.
Linearity plots of Eq. (5), obtained using the least-squares method, for different photocatalytic conditions are displayed in Fig. 11a and b. We calculated kapp using the slope of the straight line. As presented in Fig. 11c, when the TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 ratio was increased from 3/7–9/1, the photocatalytic rate decreased. Furthermore, increasing the calcination temperature led to an increase in the photocatalytic rate (Fig. 11d). This is because reducing the TiO2 proportion increased the dispersion of TiO2 on the surface of the silica support. Increasing the calcination temperature resulted in the formation of a more stable TiO2 crystal phase, anatase, within the silica mesostructure, thereby achieving higher photodegradation efficiency of the catalyst.

3.6.4. Reutilization and stability tests of TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 catalyst
To examine the stability of the prepared TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 photocatalysts, a recycling experiment on the photodegradation of MB dye in solution is carried out. As shown in Fig. 12a, the high efficiency of photocatalytic degradation of MB dye is maintained even after four cycles. Fig. 12b and c show the adsorption isotherm and pore size distribution of the catalyst after four cycles. The sample still had a type IV isotherm with an H2 hysteresis loop, indicating that the ordered mesoporous structure was unchanged. The results of TEM analysis (Fig. 12d) also show that the small TiO2 nanoparticles were well dispersed in the pores of MCM-41 after four cycles. These results indicate that the catalyst was highly stable and excellent regeneration after reuse.

4. Conclusions
TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 composite photocatalysts were prepared using inexpensive and recoverable silica obtained from PRA waste. The incorporation of TiO2 into the MCM-41 framework can increase the photoefficiency of this catalyst. The high surface area of the MCM-41 support prevents agglomeration of the TiO2 particles; these particles are instead favorably dispersed. The catalyst with calcination temperature of 700 °C and TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 molar ratio of 3/7 had the best photocatalytic performance. The size of TiO2 particles decreased considerably with a decrease in TiO2 loading. The TiO2 in the anatase phase within the mesostructure has relatively high thermal stability at a high calcination temperature. Increasing the amount of catalyst used can effectively increase the number of potential adsorption sites on the support and thus enhance the photodegradation efficiency of the titania nanoparticles. The photocatalytic activity of the catalysts investigated followed the sequence TiO2/PRA-MCM-41 > TiO2/silica gel > pure TiO2. The method of preparing highly photoactive nanocatalyst composites from recovered e-waste will be useful for achieving a circular economy.
