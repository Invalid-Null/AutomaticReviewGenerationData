Abstract
Al2O3 has been demonstrated to possess relatively high activity for alkane dehydrogenation, but there is short of in-depth understanding of the effect of its crystal phase on the dehydrogenation performance. In this study, γ-Al2O3, δ-Al2O3, θ-Al2O3 and α-Al2O3 samples have been synthesized and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation. With the phase transformation from γ-Al2O3 to α-Al2O3, propane conversion decreases gradually, while the selectivity to propene increases except for the inactive α-Al2O3. According to systemic characterization and deep analysis, phase transformation cannot change the type of active components for propane dehydrogenation, but influences its surface density, thus leading to the variation of the catalytic behaviors. Furthermore, the active sites have a close relationship with the difficultly removed hydroxyl groups on the surface of Al2O3, i.e. some specific Lewis acid sites (such as the coordinatively unsaturated AlⅣ species), but abundant acid sites will result in the secondary reactions of propene and decreased selectivity. From this perspective, the difference in propene selectivity with the phase transformation is probably caused by the change in the relative content of the active sites for propane dehydrogenation.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propene have made propane dehydrogenation, one of promising technologies of propene production, gain a lot of attention. Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, the typical supported metal and metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, have been widely used in industry over the past few decades due to their relatively high activity and selectivity for producing propene. However, some shortcomings, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt-based catalyst and environmental problem of CrOx-based catalyst, restrict their application to some extent and promote further research into inexpensive and environmentally friendly alternatives. As reported, some supported non-noble metal catalysts have been proved to efficiently catalyze dehydrogenation of light alkanes to corresponding olefins, such as VOx [1], [2], [3], Co [4], [5], [6], Ni [7], Mo [8], Zn [9,10] and their sulfides [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. The discovery of these novel catalysts inspires further exploration of suitable alternatives for dehydrogenation of light alkanes.
As the study develops in depth, the conventional promoters [16,17] and supports [9,[18], [19], [20], [21]] have been proved to be able to catalyze alkane dehydrogenation. For example, the bare Al2O3 catalyst, noble metal-free catalyst, has been demonstrated to possess relatively high activity for alkane dehydrogenation [19,[22], [23], [24], [25]] and the lattice defects (coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ ions and the surrounding lattice oxygen) on bulk Al2O3 surface are supposed to be the active sites for alkane dehydrogenation [19]. Furthermore, Dixit et al. [22,23] propounded that the local coordination environment of the Al3+ ions is a crucial factor influencing the dehydrogenation performance of Al2O3 catalyst, and the “defect site pair”, AlIII (tricoordination)-OIII (tricoordination) is the most active sites for dehydrogenation reaction. It is well known that the coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ ions are usually obtained by dehydration/dehydroxylation of Al2O3, in which the surface hydroxyl groups are usually located in tetrahedral and octahedral positions [26,27]. Unfortunately, owing to the existence of various crystallographically distinct types (such as γ-, δ-, θ-, and α-Al2O3) and the occurrence of phase transformations of Al2O3 during high temperature treatment [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], the metastable Al2O3 is usually the polymorphic phase rather than a single crystal phase with well-defined crystallographic structure after calcination at high temperature. As a consequence, the Al2O3 with different crystal phases usually possess different types of hydroxyl groups as well as different dehydration/dihydroxylation behaviors [29,33]. Considering the aforementioned issues, we wonder whether the crystal phase of Al2O3 plays a vital role in influencing the dehydrogenation behaviors. Shan et al. have investigated the effect of the crystal phase of Al2O3 on the dehydrogenation performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation, while in which the Al2O3 was regarded as the carriers rather than the active sites [34]. Furthermore, even though the dehydrogenation performances of unmodified γ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3 have been investigated [24], the influence of crystal phase of Al2O3 has not been discussed in details. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to explore the relationship between crystal phase of Al2O3 and its dehydrogenation performance.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation method
Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by sol-gel method. Pseudoboehmite powder (AR, Renping Yutian Catalytic Materials Co., Ltd.) was mixed with distilled water and stirred at 65 °C. Then, HNO3 solution (65 wt%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company) was added dropwise to the above suspended solution to adjusted pH to about 4 under stirring. After stirring vigorously for 4 h, a gel-like mixture formed and then dried at 120 °C overnight. Finally, the as-prepared samples were calcined at different temperature (600, 800, 1000 and 1200 °C) to obtain different phase compositions.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) were conducted to examine the crystal phases on a HAOYUAN DX-2700BH diffraction system. N2 adsorption-desorption characterization was used to examine the specific surface area and pore properties of Al2O3 samples on a Quadrasorb SI instrument. The acidic properties of different catalysts were obtained by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) experiments using a PCA-1200 chemical adsorption analyzer. Here, the in-situ pretreated samples were exposed to NH3 (30 mL• min−1) at 100 °C for about 0.5 h. After removing the gaseous NH3, the temperature was raised to 600 °C (10 °C• min−1) under a He flow (30 mL• min−1). In addition, the type of acid sites on Al2O3 surface was also measured through in-situ FTIR spectra of adsorbed pyridine by a Bruker TENSOR 27 FTIR spectrophotometer equipped with a DTGS detector. In a typical run: before the adsorption of pyridine, the sample was pretreated with N2 (10 mL• min−1) at 600 °C for 3 h. After cooling to 22 °C, the background was recorded and then the sample adsorbed pyridine vapor for 0.5 h. Next, the sample was treated under vacuum at 120 °C for 1 h. Finally, the spectra were recorded at 22 °C. In addition, the same FTIR spectrophotometer was also used to investigated the crystal phases of Al2O3 with different calcination temperature, Here, pure KBr was used as the background.
in-situ reflection FTIR measurements were also conducted to investigate the variation of the surface hydroxyl groups on Al2O3 with different crystal phases. Prior to the measurement, the samples were heated to 600 °C under a N2 flow (5 mL• min−1) and maintained about 3 h. Here, the background spectra were obtained using the pure KBr. In addition, to investigate the variation of the surface hydroxyl groups on Al2O3 with different catalytic activity, in-situ reflection FTIR measurements were conducted by the same apparatus. In a typical process: (1) The γ-Al2O3 was treated under vacuum condition at 22 °C for 0.5 h to remove impurities, and the background spectrum was recorded and assigned as BG-1. (2) The sample was heated to 600 °C under a N2 flow (5 mL• min−1), and immediately the temperature was cooled down to 22 °C. In this condition, a difference spectrum of the hydroxyl groups spectra was obtained, in which BG-1 was chosen as the background spectrum. In addition, a background spectrum was also obtained by recording this pretreated sample and assigned as BG-2. 3) The sample was heated to 600 °C under a N2 flow (5 mL• min−1) and maintained about 3 h, and then the temperature was cooled down to 22 °C. In this condition, two difference spectra of the hydroxyl groups spectra were obtained, in which BG-1 and BG-2 were chosen as the background spectrum separately.
Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha apparatus equipped with an Al Kα X-ray excitation source was used to record the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS).
2.3. Activity test
For the activity test, the feedstock was obtained from Yantai Deyi Gas Co., Ltd.. To explore the effect of phase composition of Al2O3 on its dehydrogenation performance, about 4.0 g catalyst were loaded a fixed bed micro-reactor (12 mm inner diameter) and heated to reaction temperature (600 °C) in a N2 flow (30 mL• min−1), and then propane (8 mL• min−1) was introduced into the reactor without dilution.
To keep the propane conversion below 10%, 0.8 g of catalysts were heated to 600 °C in a N2 flow (30 mL• min−1), and then propane (75 mL• min−1) was introduced into the reactor without dilution.
As for the apparent activation energies of propene formation on different Al2O3 catalysts, the sample (0.3 g) were pre-treated at 700 °C under H2 atmosphere (30 mL• min−1) for 1 h to exclude the effect of induction period and the propane conversion is below 5%. Herein, the dehydrogenation reactions were carried out at 560, 570, 580, 590 °C, and the total flow of the mixture (20 vol% propane in N2) was 55 mL• min−1.
In this study, a Fuli GC9720Plus gas chromatograph was used to analyze the composition of gaseous products and 1HW(T) HF infrared absorption C/S instrument was used to measure the coke amounts of the spent catalysts. The calcination of the propane conversion, products selectivities and yileds are provided in the supplementary material in details.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of as-prepared Al2O3 catalysts
According to the sequences of phase transformations form metastable γ-Al2O3 to the stable α-Al2O3 phase [28,29,35], different crystal phases of Al2O3 can be obtained by adjusting calcination temperature [36], [37], [38]. To identify the crystal phases of the as-prepared samples, XRD and transmission FTIR techniques were conducted. Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of Al2O3 catalysts with different calcination temperatures. Compared with Al2O3 calcined at 600 °C, XRD diffraction peaks of Al2O3 calcined at 800 °C do not change obviously. However, it is not difficult to find that the peak positions are slightly shifted toward the right and the intensities of these peaks are also enhanced to some extent after careful observation, which suggests that phase transformation occurs [29]. In contrary to the subtle difference between the two abovementioned samples, conspicuous changes in both the positions and the intensities of diffraction peaks of the Al2O3 calcined at 1000 and 1200 °C can be observed, indicative of an obvious difference in the phase composition between the Al2O3 samples calcined at 800, 1000 and 1200 °C. Unfortunately, from the crystallographic point of view, the thermal transition from low- to high-temperature transition of Al2O3 is an irreversible and continuous process, so that the coexistence of various crystallographically distinct types of metastable Al2O3 seems to be reasonable. As a consequence, it is hard to obtain the desirable Al2O3 with an only single crystal phase through the thermal dehydration of AlOOH. Taking into consideration the limitations mentioned above, in this study, we merely explored the influence of major crystal phase of Al2O3 on its dehydrogenation performance. According to XRD results, the as-prepared Al2O3 calcined at 600, 800, 1000 and 1200 °C can be preliminarily assigned to γ-Al2O3, δ-Al2O3, θ-Al2O3 and α-Al2O3, respectively.

To further verify the relationship between crystal phase of Al2O3 and calcination temperature, transmission FTIR techniques were carried out. As shown in Fig. 2, for the Al2O3 calcined at 600 °C, two very broad and poorly resolved bands appear from 400 to 1000 cm−1, with the maximum absorbance around 568 and 800 cm−1. As reported, the lower energy band is generally attributed to stretching vibration of AlO6 group and the higher one is connected with AlO4 group [36,39]. In addition, a weaker band at around 381 cm−1 is the result of the bending vibration of AlO6 and AlO4 groups. These spectra of skeletal modes of vibration are characteristics of γ-Al2O3 [29,40]. Similar to the XRD results, no remarkable difference in these FTIR spectra of Al2O3 calcined at 600 and 800 °C can be detected, except for the appearance of a maxima in the latter one. These observations reveal that there are no significant variations in the crystal compositions between γ-Al2O3 and δ-Al2O3. While Al2O3 calcined at 1000 °C possesses the typical characteristic of θ-Al2O3 and exhibit the enhanced absorbance at 323, 370, 567, 625, 765 and 839 cm−1 [39,41]. In contrast to the first three samples, the bands in the low frequency region of Al2O3 calcined at 1200 °C are much better resolved due to the appearance of sharp maxima, such as two strong bands near 593 and 640 cm−1 assigned to the stretching vibration of condensed octahedral AlO6, which is in a good agreement with previous studies about corundum powders [30,41]. In view of the above mentioned, the as-prepared Al2O3 were labeled as γ-Al2O3, δ-Al2O3, θ-Al2O3 and α-Al2O3.

N2 adsorption-desorption characterization was carried out to examine the specific surface area and pore properties of these Al2O3 samples. As listed in Table 1, both the specific surface area and pore volume decline with the phase transformation from the initial γ-Al2O3 to the final α-Al2O3. However, the pore-size distribution displays the opposite pattern. Fig. S1 suggests that the isothermal type of all samples is type IV. Notably, obvious H1-type hysteresis loops typical of the cylindrical-channel mesoporous structure can be observed for the three metastable Al2O3 samples, while that of the stable α-Al2O3 is similar to H3-type loop assigned to the slit-shaped pores generated from the aggregation of plate-like particles [42], [43], [44]. These changes can be interpreted by the shrinkage of Al2O3 lattice at high temperatures [45], [46], [47], [48], which results in the collapse and the combination of the small-channel pores to cause the formation of large-channel pores, decease in the surface area, and formation of highly ordered structure [30]. When the calcined temperature is high enough to transfer the AlO4 group to the condensed AlO6 group, the stable α-Al2O3 forms [49].

3.2. Dehydrogenation performance of Al2O3 with different crystal phases
The catalytic performance of the as-prepared Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation was also evaluated and the results are shown in Figs. 3 and S2. It can be clearly seen that there are some differences in the dehydrogenation performance of Al2O3 catalysts with different crystal phases. Notably, the catalytic activity of the stable α-Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation is poor and shows negligible variation during the whole reaction time. Taking the result of blank experiment into consideration (Fig. S3), it is easy to conclude that the stable α-Al2O3 exhibits an ignorable activity for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. As for the three above mentioned metastable Al2O3, γ-Al2O3, δ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3 catalysts, both the propane conversion and propene selectivity are rather low at the beginning of reaction and increase with rising time on stream, indicative of the existence of an induction period, which is consistent with the previous study [19]. In addition, among metastable Al2O3 catalysts, the conversion of propane decreases with the sequence of phase transformations from γ-Al2O3 to δ-Al2O3 to θ-Al2O3 under the same conditions, while the selectivity to propene increases, at the same time. These observations reveal that the phase compositions not only impact on the formation rate of active sites for propane dehydrogenation, but also influence the catalytic activity of Al2O3 catalysts.

3.3. Exploration of the active component
Fig. 3 have exhibited the catalytic performance of the as-prepared Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, while side reactions occurred severely (see in Fig. S2). To examine whether crystal phase of Al2O3 is a decisive factor influencing its dehydrogenation performance more accurately, the dehydrogenation behaviors of Al2O3 catalysts with different crystal phases were also conducted in the kinetic regime and the formation rate of propene per unit mass per unit time (FRP, mmol• g−1• h−1, the calculation details are given in the supplementary material) over γ-Al2O3, δ-Al2O3, θ-Al2O3 and α-Al2O3 catalysts were also calculated. As shown in Fig. 4, the dehydrogenation behaviors of Al2O3 catalysts with different crystal phases obtained in the kinetic regime exhibit similar patterns with those shown in Fig. 3, and the stable α-Al2O3 was further proved to be inactive. The difference is that propene selectivities in the initial stage of the reaction were enhanced obviously for all the metastable Al2O3 catalysts. Regardless of the reaction conditions, all the metastable Al2O3 catalysts exhibit poor activity propane dehydrogenation at the beginning of the reaction, and their dehydrogenation performances increase with time on stream. This phenomenon indicates that the untreated metastable Al2O3 catalysts are also inactive, while the active sites for propane dehydrogenation can be formed during the reaction. Furthermore, it also can be found that the FRP values reduce with the phase transformation from the initial γ-Al2O3 to the final θ-Al2O3 if the induction period is not considered. In other word, the increased structure orderliness with phase transformation is detrimental to the catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation. According to the above results, we wonder if the active species for propane dehydrogenation change with the phase transformation, and what is the main reason for the change in the catalytic activity of Al2O3. XRD patterns exhibit that no visible change in diffraction peaks can be detected between spent and fresh Al2O3 catalysts with the same crystal phase (Fig. S4). This observation indicates that the crystal phase of Al2O3 catalysts remains unchanged.

To answer the above question that weather the active species for propane dehydrogenation change with the phase transformation, the apparent activation energy (Ea) of propene formation over γ-Al2O3, δ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3 were measured. To ensure the accuracy of the measured value of Ea, the effects of heat and mass transfer should be eliminated (the experimental details are given in the supplementary material and the results are presented in Figs. S5 and S6). To keep propane conversion below 5%, the reaction conditions are as follows: 0.3 g of catalyst, 20 vol% propane in N2 and in the temperature range from 560 to 590 °C. To verify whether the mass transfer and heat transfer limitations are eliminated under these reaction conditions, the highest propene formation rate was analyzed by the Mears criterion and Weisz-Prater criterion (the calculation details are given in the supplementary material) [50], [51], [52], and the calculated results indicated that external and internal diffusion limitation can be ignored. Based on the data shown in Fig. 5, linear Arrhenius plots can be obtained. As illustrated in Fig. 6, even though the formation rate of propene of these catalysts are different, there is no obvious difference in the values of Ea within the margin of error. To verify the accuracy of Ea values, repeated experiments were carried out. It can be clearly seen that the change in the Ea values is ignorable within the experimental error, that is, the experimental results are reproducible and credible. The result means that the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over these metastable Al2O3 samples have not changed with phase transformation, that is, the difference in dehydrogenation performance of γ-Al2O3, δ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3 catalysts may be caused by other reasons.

3.4. Origins for the different dehydrogenation behaviors
3.4.1. Specific activity
Note that the phase transformation is usually accompanied with the change in the textural properties, such as specific surface area and pore morphology. However, compared with the fresh Al2O3 catalysts, both the specific surface area and pore properties of spent Al2O3 catalysts show an ignorable change, except for α-Al2O3 (Table S1). Taking the variation of specific surface area with phase transformation into account, we investigated the correlation between the specific surface area and propane conversion. It can be clearly seen that propane conversion over Al2O3 samples has a linear relationship with the specific surface area (Fig. S7). We defined the formation rate of propene (FRSP, μmol• m−2• h−1, the calculation details are given in the supplementary material) to further check whether the reduction in dehydrogenation performance can be attributed to the decreased specific surface area. As observed in Fig. 7, regardless of the induction period, the maximum value of the FRSP decreases in the following order: δ-Al2O3 > γ-Al2O3 > θ-Al2O3, which is different to those of the FRP (Fig. 4). Taking the same active sites of the three metastable Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation into account, the apparent anomaly implies that there is a difference in the density of active sites per unit area on the three metastable Al2O3 catalysts. Based on the aforementioned discussion, it can be easily concluded that the phase composition of Al2O3 has an ignorable effect on the kind of active sites for propane dehydrogenation, but it can change the density of these active sites.

3.4.2. Formation of the defected Al3+ ions
As is known, the oxygen ions on the surface of metastable Al2O3 usually substituted by hydroxyl groups formed by chemisorption of water [53,54]. It should be noted that these hydroxyl groups can also be removed by chemical and physical means, such as thermal treatment [33,55]. According to reports about the analysis of dehydroxylation process by thermal treatment [27,56], either random combination of adjacent hydroxyl groups or random combination of isolated hydroxyl groups will leave an oxygen ion and an oxygen vacancy on Al3+ ion. As a consequence, the coordination number of Al cations decreases with surface dehydroxylation of Al2O3, meanwhile, new kinds of hydroxyl groups appear [27]. As for these formed coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ ions, it has been proved that they can act as the active sites for some catalytic reactions, such as dehydration of alcohol and dehydrogenation of light alkanes [19,23,57]. Notably, some researchers have also found that the catalytic activity of coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ ions has a close relationship with its coordination environment [22,24]. For instance, Dixit et al. [22] proposed that the AlIII (tricoordination)-OIII (tricoordination) exhibits the high activity for dehydrogenation reaction, compared with other acid-base site pairs, such as the AlV(pentacoordination)-OIII and AlIV(tetracoordination)-OIII. Based on the aforementioned discussion, the catalytic dehydrogenation performance of Al2O3 can be optimized by modifying the coordination environment of Al3+ ions to some extent. As we all know, the relative proportion of tetra-coordinated and hexa-coordinated Al3+ ions, even penta-coordinated Al3+ ions on Al2O3 surface, varies with the thermally induced phase transformation [57,58]. That is, a correlation between the coordination environment of Al3+ ions and the phase transformation obtained by thermal treatment may exist. Given the fact that the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over these mentioned Al2O3 have not changed with phase transformation, the difference in the dehydrogenation performance of these Al2O3 may lie in the variation in the relative content of the different kinds of coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ ions.
In order to deepen our insight into the coordination environment of the Al3+ ions on the surface of Al2O3, in-situ reflection FTIR measurements were conducted. Firstly, the in-situ FTIR spectra in the OH-stretch region of Al2O3 samples pretreated in N2 at 600 °C were recorded, in which the background spectra were obtained using KBr, and the results are shown in Fig. 8a. All the metastable Al2O3 (γ-, δ- and θ-Al2O3) display at least five bonds, near 3788, 3745, 3732, 3683 and 3579 cm−1, separately. However, the spectra of the stable α-Al2O3 is an exception, in which one bond about 3710 cm−1 was detected. The weak band near 3788 cm−1 result from terminal hydroxyl groups on the tetrahedral Al3+ ions [29,31]. However, there still exist a debate about the ascription of the bands around 3745 and 3732 cm−1. The bands at 3745 cm−1 is attributed to the bridging hydroxyl group by Knözinger et al., in which the oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group is attached to two octahedral Al3+ ions [59,60], while the calculated results by Digne et al. suggest that this band is ascribed to a triply-bridging hydroxyl group, which is a combination of a hydroxyl group and three octahedral Al3+ ions [61]. As for the band at 3732 cm−1, on the one hand, both Knözinger et al. and Digne et al. assigned it to the bridging hydroxyl group. The former suggests that it involves a tetrahedral Al3+ ion and an octahedral Al3+ ion, while the latter deems that it contains two octahedral Al3+ ions [59,61]. On the other hand, Busca et al. regarded this band to the terminal hydroxyl group on octahedral Al3+ ion [31]. The assignments of the band at 3683 and 3579 cm−1 are possibly caused by the triply-bridging hydroxyl group and H-bonded hydroxyl groups [62]. Even though they are also under debate, we will not elaborate here. It should be noted that the above mentioned tetrahedral Al3+ ions and octahedral Al3+ ions not only include the coordinatively saturated Al3+ ions, but also contain the coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ ions [27]. According to the results shown in Fig. 8a, the bonds of all metastable Al2O3 are of the same patterns but of different intensities, suggesting that the coordination number of Al3+ ions is possibly the same, but the relative content of these species is different.

In-situ FTIR spectra in the OH-stretch region of Al2O3 catalysts (a: FTIR spectra of Al2O3 with different crystal phases and involving a KBr background spectra; b–e: the FTIR difference spectra of the hydroxyl groups spectra on Al2O3 with different crystal phases and different pretreatments, respectively, in which BG-1 was chosen as the background spectrum; f: the FTIR difference spectra of the hydroxyl groups on Al2O3 with different dehydrogenation activities, in which BG-2 was chosen as the background spectrum).
Since difference spectra can more visually display the variations of surface hydroxyl groups, to acquire more reliable conclusions about relationship between the coordination environment of Al3+ ions and the active sites of Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation, we compared the difference in the hydroxyl groups on Al2O3 with different dehydrogenation activities. The corresponding FTIR difference spectra of the hydroxyl groups on γ-Al2O3, δ-Al2O3, θ-Al2O3 and α-Al2O3 catalysts with different pretreatments are shown in Fig. 8b-e. Herein, all the Al2O3 samples were out-gassed at 22 °C under vacuum for 0.5 h and the background spectra were recorded, separately. Since the FTIR difference spectra of the hydroxyl groups on the metastable Al2O3 samples exhibit the similar patters, we take the γ-Al2O3 sample as an example. It can be clearly seen that three bands below 3700 cm−1, with peaks at 3697, 3595 and 3480 cm−1 are attenuated by thermal treatment (the positive bands) and two other bands appear in the range of 3700 to 3800 cm−1 (the negative bands). The former is mainly caused by the desorption of the absorbed H2O and the removal of H-bonded hydroxyl groups, leading to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ ions, and the latter represents the newly formed hydroxyl groups on these coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ ions. According to the spectra of catalyst pretreated in N2 at 600 °C for 0 h, the low conversion of propane and poor selectivity to propene during the initial stage of reaction indicates that the coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ ions formed by the removal of the weakly adsorbed hydroxyl groups (the broad bands below 3700 cm−1) are inactive for propane dehydrogenation. Therefore, the active sites for propane dehydrogenation may be associated to the defect sites generated after removal of the strongly adsorbed hydroxyl groups. The difficulty in removal of these hydroxyl groups may account for the existence of induction period. To make the change of the hydroxyl groups more distinct, Fig. 8f also gives the FTIR difference spectrum of the hydroxyl groups on Al2O3 with different dehydrogenation activities, herein, the spectra obtained from the catalyst pretreated at 600 °C for 0 h were chosen as the background spectrum. Similarly, the FTIR difference spectrum of the hydroxyl groups on the three metastable Al2O3 samples (Fig. 8f) are of the same patterns but of different intensities, too. As depicted, three bands (3790, 3780 and 3745 cm−1) can be detected on the three metastable Al2O3 samples. In contrast, there is an ignorable change in the hydroxyl groups on the stable α-Al2O3 sample before and after reaction. Combined with their dehydrogenation performance, the phenomena naturally make us draw a conclusion that the change in the hydroxyl groups on the surface Al2O3 samples has a close relationship with their dehydrogenation activity.
Due to the complexity of hydroxyl groups on the surface of Al2O3 as discussed above, it is difficult to give clearly definitive attribution. Even though the types of the hydroxyl groups in the range from 3700 to 3800 cm−1 is still disputed, the infrared peak positions can indirectly represent the coordination environments of coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ ions. Combined with the fact that there are same active sites for propane dehydrogenation on γ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3, these observations suggest that the coordination environment of coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ ions are the same, but the relative content of these species is different. These results indicate that phase transformation makes an influence on the density of the active sites, but little essential effect on the kinds of active components, which is consistent with their dehydrogenation performance.
To further find out the coordination environment of the active Al cations for propane dehydrogenation, the 27Al MAS NMR spectra of Al2O3 catalysts under different pretreatments were recorded, and the results are shown in Fig. 9. The three metastable Al2O3 all exhibit chemical shifts of 27Al in the range of 62–64, 42–44 and 5–7 ppm, which originate from AlⅣ (tetracoordination), AlⅤ (pentacoordination) and AlⅥ (hexacoordination), respectively [4,63,64]. The relative content of the different coordination numbers of Al cations on Al2O3 catalysts under different pretreatments are listed in Table 2. Taking γ-Al2O3 sample as an example, the Al3+ species on the surface of γ-Al2O3 catalyst without pretreatment the Al3+ ions mainly exist in the form of coordinatively saturated tetrahedral and octahedral coordinated Al3+ ions. During the heating process, the relative content of AlV species increases from 3.55% to 5.63%, suggesting that AlV species can be formed easily. While with the increase of the number of AlV species, the dehydrogenation performance of Al2O3 catalyst pretreated under N2 at 600 ºC for 0 h in the initial stage is relatively poor, and no direct relationship between the FRP values and the relative content of AlV species can be observed on γ-Al2O3 samples with different pretreatments. All of these facts indicate that AlⅣ species are not the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. Moreover, it should be noted that the FRP value increases with the content of AlⅣ species. As reported, the content of AlⅣ species is controlled by the compromise between its formation (coordinatively saturated AlⅥ → AlV → coordinatively unsaturated AlⅣ) and consumption (coordinatively saturated AlⅣ → AlIII and coordinatively unsaturated AlⅣ → AlIII) during the dehydroxylation process of Al2O3 [27]. This means that the AlⅣ species on the surface of metastable Al2O3 after heating pretreatment include both the coordinatively saturated and coordinatively unsaturated AlⅣ species. Accordingly, during the dehydroxylation process, the relative content of the coordinatively saturated AlⅣ decreases, while that of the coordinatively unsaturated AlⅣ increases when the total amount of AlⅣ species is increased. Therefore, the coordinatively unsaturated AlⅣ species are probably the active components for propane dehydrogenation on Al2O3 catalyst. The coordination number of Al3+ ions on the surface of α-Al2O3 sample before and after reaction are almost AlⅥ species, which possibly accounts for its poor dehydrogenation behavior.

3.4.3. Surface acidity
Since pyridine can simultaneously interact with both hydroxyl groups and Lewis acid sites, the variation of surface hydroxyl groups is usually accompanied with the change in the type of acid sites [29,31,65], so that relating the kinds of hydroxyl groups to the spectra of pyridine adsorption seems to be reasonable. For instance, as reported by Lundie et al., the 3770 cm−1 band is related to the interaction between the pyridine and the hydroxyl group that is adjacent to the medium-strength Lewis acid sites, while the 3730 cm−1 band is related to the existence of medium-weak Lewis acid sites [65]. The pyridine FTIR spectra of these Al2O3 samples were recorded. As shown in Fig. 10, five bands (1450, 1491, 1578, 1595 and 1614 cm−1) attributed to pyridine species adsorbed on Lewis acid sites, can be detected on γ-Al2O3 without pretreatment, and no band at about 1540 cm−1 caused by Brønsted acid sites can be detected [29,65], indicating that only Lewis acid sites exist on untreated γ-Al2O3 surface and Brønsted acid sites can be neglected. Since the active sites of Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation are formed during the reaction, for sake of accuracy, the samples were pretreated in a N2 flow at 600 ºC to eliminate the induction period prior to adsorption of pyridine. For the γ-Al2O3 pretreated at 600 °C for 3 h in a N2 flow, in addition to the change in intensities of these bands, a new band at about 1623 cm−1 ascribed to the strong Lewis acid site appears and the band at 1450 shifts to 1448 cm−1. This means the formation of new Lewis acid sites and is consistent with the results of FTIR spectra in the OH-stretch region and 27Al MAS NMR spectra. As expected, the kinds of Lewis acid sites on the metastable δ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3 catalysts are the same as those on γ-Al2O3 catalyst, while the acid sites on the surface of α-Al2O3 sample can be neglected. These observations indicate that only Lewis acid sites exist on Al2O3 surface and Brønsted acid sites can be neglected before and after heating to 600 °C, so that the active sites for propane dehydrogenation have a close relationship with the Lewis acid sites rather than the Brønsted acid sites, which is in accord with the opinion of Yue et al. [66]. Combined with the study by Dixit et al. [22], the above discussion leads us to propose that the existence of induction period is ascribed to the variation of the coordination environment of Al3+ ions on Al2O3 surface, or the change in the types of Lewis acid sites. Furthermore, associating the results of pyridine adsorption with catalytic activity of Al2O3 at the beginning of reaction, it can be concluded that only some specific Lewis acid sites are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation, but not all Lewis acid sites. Taking the evolution of the hydroxyl coverage with temperature into consideration [55], the existence of induction period, i.e., the process of the generation of active sites for dehydrogenation, means that the formation of active sites for propane dehydrogenation may be restricted by the difficultly removed hydroxyl groups, which contributes to the formation of some specific Lewis acid sites.

Fig. 10. FTIR spectra of pyridine over Al2O3 catalyst with different crystal phases.
Notably, various Lewis acid sites appear on the Al2O3 surface with time on stream, as reported by Morterra, the 1623 cm−1 band and the 1614 cm−1 band are assigned to the strong and medium strong Lewis acid sites, and the bands below 1600 cm−1 are related to the weak acid sites [67]. These acid sites will not only facilitate the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene, but also give rise to side reactions. As observed in Figs. 3 and S2, not only the selectivity to propene increases with time on stream, but also the formation of undesirable by-products also increases during the induction period. To gain deeper insight into the poor selectivity to propene on Al2O3 catalyst, the correlation between the content of acid sites per unit area and the FRSP was explored. Herein, the content of acid sites was obtained by the de-convoluted NH3-TPD profiles using Lorentzian-Gaussian functions. According to the reported analysis about the NH3-TPD profiles [68,69], the peaks below 210 °C are caused by weak acid sites, and these in the range of 230–310 °C are due to medium acid sites, and the peaks above 340 °C can be considered as strong acid sites, and the results are exhibited in Fig. 11 and Table 3. In addition, the NH3-TPD profiles of spent Al2O3 catalysts were also measured and the results are shown in Fig. S8. It can be clearly seen that there is a decrease in both contents of weak acid sites and strong acid sites compared with those of fresh Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 11). According to the discussion about FTIR and 27Al NMR results (Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10), we can naturally draw a conclusion that the change in the number of weak acid sites is probably caused by the change in the coordination numbers of Al3+ species. However, the decrease in strong acid sites may be due to the coverage effect of deposited coke during dehydrogenation reaction. As seen in Fig. S9, when the mass transfer and heat transfer limitations are eliminated, the FRSP value may largely depends on the medium and strong acid sites, but it is independent of the weak acid sites. The results reveal that the weak acid sites on the Al2O3 surface may not be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation, which is consistent with the above discussion. In addition, the medium and strong weak acid sites are possibly responsible for the dehydrogenation reaction. Whereas, it is opposite to that one obtained under the longer retention time and with a high conversion of propane. This anomaly may be caused by the secondary reactions of propene on the superfluous acid sites. To verify this guess, relationships between propene selectivity and propane conversion and those between by-products selectivity and propane conversion were investigated. As shown in Fig. 12, it can be clearly seen that propene selectivity decreases with increasing propane conversion, while the selectivities of by-products, such as methane, ethane, ethane and coke, exhibit opposite patterns. This phenomenon indicates that propene plays a role as intermediate in sequential reactions. As a result, the propene selectivity can not reach 100% when the selectivity-conversion relationship was extrapolated to zero degree of propane conversion. Therefore, inhibiting the further dehydrogenation of propene may be an efficient way to improve propene selectivity. According to the above-mentioned analysis, that can be achieved by controlling the relative percentage of the active sites for propane dehydrogenation to that for secondary reactions for propene .

Based on the above discussion, the coordinatively saturated AlⅥ species can be converted to coordinatively unsaturated AlⅤ, AlIV and AlⅢ species in turn during the pretreatment process, while the coordinatively saturated AlIV species only can be transferred to coordinatively unsaturated AlⅢ species (Fig. 13). According to the results of 27Al MAS NMR of Al2O3 samples and their dehydrogenation behaviors, we can draw a conclusion that the dehydrogenation activity increases with the degree of coordinative unsaturation of Al3+ ions on Al2O3 surface. Among them, easily formed AlIV species are probably not the active sites for propane dehydrogenation, and the coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ species formed by further dehydroxylation effect of AlIV species are the active sites, such as coordinatively saturated AlIV species.
4. Conclusions
A detailed study was carried out on the effect of crystal phase of Al2O3 on its dehydrogenation performance. For this purpose, a series of Al2O3 samples differing in crystal phase were prepared by sol-gel method and tested for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The results reveal that the phase transformation from γ-Al2O3 to α-Al2O3 has a negative effect on propane conversion and a positive effect on propene selectivity without considering inactive α-Al2O3. To further investigate how the crystal phase influences its catalytic activity, the kinetic analysis of propane dehydrogenation over γ-Al2O3, δ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3, and the systemic characterization of these samples were carried out. It is demonstrated that phase transformation can change the surface density of the active sites for propane dehydrogenation rather than its type, leading to the change in the catalytic behaviors. Furthermore, the active sites for propane dehydrogenation are ascribed to some specific Lewis acid sites (the coordinatively unsaturated AlIV species) and these sites are probably originated from the difficultly removed hydroxyl groups on Al2O3. On this basis, it can be concluded that the difference in the propene selectivity over different Al2O3 may result from the different relative contents of the active component for propane dehydrogenation.
