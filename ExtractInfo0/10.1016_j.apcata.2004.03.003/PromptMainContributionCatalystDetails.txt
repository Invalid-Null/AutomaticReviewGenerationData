Oxidative functionalization of propane over FeMFI zeolites: Effect of reaction variables and catalyst constitution on the mechanism and performance
Abstract
The effect of the iron distribution in steam-activated FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite on their catalytic performance for direct N2O decomposition and for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with N2O and O2 was investigated by means of steady-state and transient pulse experiments. Steam-activated FeZSM-5, containing a large fraction of iron as oligonuclear FexOy clusters, is more active and selective in ODHP and direct N2O decomposition than steam-activated Fe-silicalite, where isolated iron species predominate. This suggests that the same type of iron centers is involved in both conversions. The higher activity of steam-activated FeZSM-5 is associated to the higher mobility of atomic oxygen species attached to oligonuclear iron species, which lead to a faster oxygen desorption in direct N2O decomposition as well as to a faster transfer to propane in the ODHP reaction. Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites were found to be highly effective catalysts for ODHP with N2O, with initial propene yields up to 24%. Relatively high yields of propionaldehyde are also obtained, which mainly originates from the selective oxidation of propene. The unique ODHP performance of iron zeolites requires the use of N2O as monooxygen donor. Such species cannot be created by O2. Only a fraction of oxygen species deposited over iron sites of FeMFI upon N2O activation was found to be active towards propane oxidation under transient vacuum conditions. This is explained by a fast transformation of short-living highly reactive atomic oxygen species into less reactive ones.
1. Introduction
Light olefins are industrially produced by non-oxidative catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), the steam cracking of naphta and metathesis at high temperatures. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an alternative route to olefins. The exothermicity of this reaction enables to operate at lower reaction temperatures than in case of non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The main challenge for oxidative dehydrogenation processes is, however, to minimize formation of carbon oxides (COx). Numerous catalytic systems have been evaluated for ODH and the results in this field have been recently reviewed [1], [2]. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), promising formulations are based on relatively complex systems based on molybdenum and vanadium oxides. The highest propene yields reported in the literature are in the range of 24–30%, which were achieved over V–Mg–O oxide [3], K/Mo oxides supported on SiO2–TiO2 [4], and Ba-promoted Ni–Mo–O oxide [5] catalysts, using O2 as the oxidant. An alternative oxidizing agent, nitrous oxide (N2O), was also applied in ODHP over supported vanadium oxide catalysts [6], resulting in an increased selectivity to partial oxidation products as compared to oxygen. However, relatively low propane conversions were achieved.
The oxidizing properties of N2O in hydrocarbon conversions over Fe-zeolites are unique. This was triggered by the accomplishments in hydroxylation of paraffins to alcohols and of aromatic hydrocarbons to phenols over FeZSM-5 [7]. Previous studies have reported high selectivities of MFI frameworks with iron towards oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O and O2 at a low degree of hydrocarbon conversions (2–10%), thus achieving a low yield of the olefin (<10%) [8], [9]. Recently, Nowińska et al. [10] investigated the oxidation of propane over liquid-ion exchanged M-ZSM-5 zeolites (M=Fe, Co, Mn) using O2 and N2O as oxidants. N2O was found to be significantly more selective for propene formation than O2, and propene yields up to 20% were achieved over FeZSM-5 (the most active catalyst), using a feed mixture of C3H8:N2O:N2=1:5:20. In parallel, we have reported initial propene yields of 21–24% during ODHP with N2O over steam-activated FeMFI zeolites in a feed of C3H8:N2O:Ne=10:10:80 [11]. These significant yields are comparable with the highest values reported over V- and Mo-based oxides with O2. Besides, remarkable yields towards propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been achieved. This novel application of FeMFI leads to the simultaneous functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environmentally harmful gas.
The aim of the present study was to derive relationships between the forms of iron in steam-activated FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite and their catalytic performance in selective propane oxidation with N2O and O2. The nature and distribution of iron species in these catalysts differ strongly, as concluded from detailed characterizations reported elsewhere [11], [12], [13], [14]. In parallel with C3H8 oxidation, direct N2O decomposition was also investigated. Kinetic and mechanistic insights into both reactions derived from steady-state and transient pulse experiments have been correlated with the iron constitution in the catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts
Details on the hydrothermal synthesis of FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite have been described elsewhere [12], [13], [15]. The as-synthesized samples, containing the different metals in the zeolite framework, were calcined in air at 823 K for 10 h and converted into the H-form by three consecutive exchanges with a NH4NO3 solution (0.1 M) for 12 h and subsequent air calcination at 823 K for 5 h. Finally the catalysts were activated in a flow of nitrogen and steam at ambient pressure, using a partial steam pressure of 300 mbar and 30 ml STP N2 min−1 at 873 K for 5 h. Along the manuscript, the steam-activated iron zeolites are denoted as ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite.
2.2. Catalytic tests
The catalytic tests were performed in a U-form continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactor (6 mm i.d.) at atmospheric pressure. The reactor was immersed into a bed of fluidized sand, serving as a source or sink of heat. The catalyst was diluted by quartz particles (three times dilution in volume) of the same fraction (250–355 μm). Thereby quasi-isothermal operation was achieved. The temperature profile in the catalyst bed was measured using a movable thermocouple located inside the quartz capillary in contact with the catalyst. The highest temperature gradient was 15 K. The oxidative conversion of propane was investigated using a feed of 10 vol.% C3H8 and 10 vol.% N2O in Ne (C3H8:N2O:Ne=10:10:80) or 10 vol.% C3H8 and 5 vol.% O2 in N2 (C3H8:O2:N2=10:5:85) at 773 K and 1 bar. For acquiring selectivities at different degrees of propane conversion, the contact time was varied from 3×10−3 to 7×10−2 s g cm−3 by changing the amount of catalyst and the total flow rate. In order to derive additional insights into products formation, catalytic experiments were carried out with addition of propene (1 and 2 vol.% C3H6) to the feed mixture containing C3H8 and N2O. The feed and reaction products were analyzed using on-line gas chromatography (HP 5890) equipped with Porapack Q and Molsieve 5A columns. The yield and selectivity of propene and propionaldehyde were calculated according to

The performance of the catalysts in direct N2O decomposition was investigated in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor (5 mm i.d.) using a catalyst mass of 20–35 mg (250–355 μm), and a feed of 10 vol.% N2O (Pro Narcosis) in neon (Ne 4.5) at a total pressure of 1.5 bar. The total flow rate and reaction temperature were varied between 60 and 240 ml STP min−1 and 673 and 773 K, respectively. The contact times were adjusted to keep the degree of N2O conversion below 5%. This enabled a proper estimation of the initial rates of O2 formation or N2O decomposition according to
where FT is the total volumetric flow, Wcat the catalyst mass, and C(O2) is the measured oxygen concentration at the reactor outlet. The ratio of Wcat/FT is defined as the contact time τ, expressed as s g cm−3. The feed and product components were analysed by on-line gas chromatography (Chrompack CP-2002) equipped with Poraplot Q and Molsieve 5A columns.
2.3. Transient studies
Transient experiments were performed in the temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor, a pulse technique with a time resolution in the sub-millisecond range. The TAP reactor system has been described in detail elsewhere [16], [17]. The catalyst (ca. 50 mg; 250–355 μm) was packed between two layers of quartz particles of the same size fraction in the quartz micro-reactor (6 mm i.d.). Prior to the experiments, the catalysts were pretreated in flowing helium (30 ml STP min−1) for 3 h at 773 K and ambient pressure. The pretreated catalyst was exposed to vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) and pulse experiments were carried out in the temperature range of 573–823 K. Pulses containing a small amount of reactants (ca. 5×1014 molecules per pulse) were injected via two high-speed valves into the TAP micro-reactor. Transient responses were monitored at the reactor outlet using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Hiden Analytical) at atomic mass units (AMUs) related to feed components, reaction products, and inert gas. Two types of transient experiments were performed:
•
N2O decomposition in single pulsing mode: A gas mixture of N2O and Ne (N2O:Ne=1:1) was pulsed into the reactor.
•
Reaction of C3H8 and N2O in sequential pulsing mode: Gas mixtures of N2O/Ne (N2O:Ne=1:1) and C3H8/Xe (C3H8:Xe=1:1) were sequentially pulsed from two different pulse valves at operator-specified time intervals, referred to as the time delay (Δt). Experiments with Δt=0 s correspond to simultaneous pulsing of C3H8 and N2O.
The gases applied in our experiments, Ne (4.5), Xe (4.0), N2O (2.0), and C3H8 (3.5), were used without additional purification. In both types of experiments described, pulses were repeated 10 times for each AMU and averaged to improve signal-to-noise ratio. For mass spectroscopic identification of the different compounds the following AMUs were used: 132 (Xe), 44 (N2O, CO2, C3H8), 42 (C3H6, C3H8), 32 (O2), 30 (N2O), 29 (C3H8), 28 (CO, CO2, N2O, N2), 20 (Ne) and 18 (H2O). The variations in feed components and reaction products were determined from the respective AMUs using standard fragmentation patterns and sensitivity factors.
3. Results
3.1. Iron constitution in the catalysts
A detailed characterization of the steam-activated iron zeolites used in this study, based on a multi-technique approach, has been reported elsewhere [12], [13], [15]. The iron content in ex-FeZSM-5 (Si/Al=31 and 0.67 wt.% Fe) and ex-Fe-silicalite (Si/Al∼∞ and 0.68 wt.% Fe) catalysts was very similar, although the catalyst constitution with respect to iron (nature and distribution of species) differs strongly. Ex-Fe-silicalite does not show a significant degree of iron association, and the majority of extraframework iron species is uniform and well isolated, with a fraction of iron in framework positions. Contrarily, total dislodgment of framework iron and clustering were observed in ex-FeZSM-5. In the latter sample, extraframework isolated iron ions and oligonuclear iron species in the zeolite pores coexist with iron oxide nanoparticles of 1–2 nm. Since activation conditions were identical in both catalysts, the different iron constitution can be attributed to the different composition of the zeolite framework, which determines the extraction of isomorphously substituted iron and the degree of association of extraframework iron species [13], [14].
3.2. Oxidative conversion of propane
3.2.1. Transient experiments
The lifetime of the oxygen species formed on extraframework iron species upon N2O activation and its reactivity towards propane were investigated under transient conditions using sequential pulsing of N2O and C3H8 in the TAP reactor. In this cyclic pump-probe mode, a pulse of N2O is followed by a pulse of C3H8 after a certain time delay (Δt) in the range from 0 to 2 s. This enables to probe the reaction of C3H8 with atomic oxygen species, which was previously deposited by N2O activation over the catalyst surface. By varying the time delay between N2O and C3H8 pulses, the influence of surface oxygen coverage on the propane conversion and products distribution can be determined, providing essential information on elementary (single-event) steps involving propane activation. The operating conditions in the TAP reactor under Knudsen diffusion regime enable to study purely heterogeneous reaction steps, since interaction of molecules in the gas-phase is minimized.
At all the time delays between N2O and C3H8 pulses, CO, CO2, and C3H6 were the only gas-phase products detected by MS analysis at the outlet of the TAP micro-reactor. Fig. 1 shows the transient responses of N2O, C3H8, and C3H6 during sequential pulsing of N2O and C3H8 with Δt (0.1 s) over ex-FeZSM-5 at 673 K. The profiles are normalized to enable a better comparison of the pulse shapes. The signal of propene is broader than that of propane and is shifted to longer times, strongly suggesting primary formation of propene from propane. Fig. 2 shows a decrease in propane conversion and propene yield with an increase in the time delay between N2O and C3H8 pulses at 673 K, revealing the importance of the lifetime of reactive atomic oxygen species deposited by N2O for C3H8 activation and C3H6 formation. It is clear that ex-FeZSM-5 leads to the higher propane conversion and propene yield than ex-Fe-silicalite at all the time delays.

3.2.2. Catalytic performance under continuous flow conditions
The performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the oxidative conversion of propane with N2O and O2 versus time on stream is shown in Fig. 3. The first value in these figure corresponds to the analysis of reaction products after ca. 15 min on stream, denoted hereafter as the initial performance. When N2O is used as oxidant, the degree of C3H8 and N2O conversion continuously declines in a period of 100 min, due to coke formation. The catalysts completely recovered their initial activity after treatment in oxygen at 773 K for 30 min. This was checked by performing various ODHP-reaction and O2-regeneration cycles. Ex-Fe-silicalite deactivates much faster than ex-FeZSM-5. For both zeolite catalysts, C3H6, CO, CO2, and CH3CH2CHO (propionaldehyde) were the main reaction products detected at the reactor outlet by GC analysis. Initial C3H8 and N2O conversions of 52 and 86% respectively were obtained over ex-FeZSM-5. These values are significantly higher than those over ex-Fe-silicalite (26 and 49%). Initial propene and propionaldehyde yields over ex-FeZSM-5 (22 and 5.5%, respectively) were also superior compared to ex-Fe-silicalite (16.5 and 3.6%, respectively).

When O2 was used as the oxidant, a slight catalyst deactivation was observed in the time scale of our experiments (Fig. 3). However, the yield of C3H6, the main coke precursor species, is much lower as compared to the catalytic tests with N2O. Besides, only traces of propionaldehyde were formed with O2, and acrolein was the main oxygenate with selectivity of ca. 3%. Interestingly, ex-Fe-silicalite is more active for ODHP with O2 than ex-FeZSM-5 (Fig. 3). For the former catalyst, O2 conversion is nearly 100%, but a poor selectivity towards propene and thus a low yield is obtained. The above results clearly evidence the specificity of N2O for achieving a high activity and selectivity of FeMFI zeolites in the oxidative functionalization of propane to propene and propionaldehyde.
Further insights into propene and propionaldehyde formation were derived from ODHP tests with N2O at different contact times. Fig. 4 shows the relationship between the degree of C3H8 and N2O conversion (initial, measured after 15 min on stream) and the contact time at 773 K. As expected, the degree of C3H8 and N2O conversion increases with an increased contact time. This activity order for N2O conversion differs from that in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of N2O with propane in the presence of oxygen [13] at temperatures below 673 K, where ex-Fe-silicalite showed higher activity as compared to ex-FeZSM-5. A comparative discussion between the results presented in this manuscript and in [13] is however not straight forward. First of all a near to complete degree of N2O conversion in SCR was achieved over the both catalysts at 700 K, while the ODHP reaction was studied at 773 K. In addition, the presence of excess oxygen prevents coke deposits in SCR, as compared to the strong deactivation by coke in ODHP. Since the first analysis takes place after 15 min on stream, initial activities cannot be strictly determined.

The selectivity–conversion relationship of ODHP over the iron zeolite catalysts is presented in Fig. 5. The selectivity towards propene decreases with an increased propane conversion, while the selectivity towards propionaldehyde increases slightly. In agreement with the TAP results, this further supports that propene is formed via direct dehydrogenation of propane. However, propionaldehyde originates, at least partially, from a secondary transformation propene. This can be concluded from the C3H8–N2O reaction with addition of propene in the feed. As shown in Fig. 6, the selectivity towards propionaldehyde increases with an increased concentration of propene in the feed mixture.

The different catalytic performance of ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite should be associated with the different iron constitution in the zeolites. Ex-FeZSM-5, with a significant degree of iron association in the active form(s) of oligonuclear iron species and even iron oxide clusters of 1–2 nm, is considerably more active and selective than ex-Fe-silicalite mainly having isolated iron ions in extraframework positions. In view of this, our strategy was to carry out a more detailed mechanistic and kinetic analysis of the iron zeolites in direct N2O decomposition, aiming at deriving correlations between the catalytic performance in these two N2O conversions and the forms of active iron in the catalysts.
3.3. Direct N2O decomposition
3.3.1. Transient experiments
Under vacuum conditions in the TAP reactor, ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite decompose N2O without formation of gas-phase O2 in the temperature range of 523–673 K. Significant but non-stoichiometric amounts of oxygen were observed above 773 K. Typical normalized transient responses of N2O, N2 and O2 during single pulsing of N2O at 773 K are shown in Fig. 7. The N2 response follows directly that of N2O, while the O2 response is broader and considerably shifted to longer times. Kinetically, this indicates that during N2O decomposition, nitrogen formation is faster than oxygen formation. This is in agreement with previous transient pulse studies of N2O decomposition over ex-FeZSM-5 in the Multitrack, a TAP-like reactor, where oxygen desorption was concluded to be a rate-limiting step in the reaction [18], [19]. From the oxygen transient response presented in Fig. 7(a) and (b) it is concluded that O2 formation during direct N2O decomposition is faster over ex-FeZSM-5 as compared to ex-Fe-silicalite.

3.3.2. Steady-state kinetics
N2 and O2 were the only observed products during steady-state N2O decomposition over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite at ambient pressure in the temperature range from 623 to 823 K. The ratio of N2/O2 was close to 2, according to
(1)
The rate of O2 formation during N2O decomposition at different temperatures is presented in Fig. 8. The results clearly show that ex-FeZSM-5 is more active for direct N2O decomposition than ex-Fe-silicalite. The apparent activation energy of O2 formation, determined from the slope of the Arrhenius plot in Fig. 8, is significantly higher over ex-Fe-silicalite (226 kJ mol−1) than over ex-FeZSM-5 (190 kJ mol−1). In general terms, this indicates that O2 formation during direct N2O decomposition over ex-Fe-silicalite is energetically less favorable than over ex-FeZSM-5. This result is in good agreement with N2O decomposition experiments in the TAP reactor described above, where, slower oxygen desorption was observed over ex-Fe-silicalite.

4. Discussion
4.1. Role of Fe species in N2O conversions
We have recently reported [11] that steam-activated commercial H-ZSM-5, containing 170 ppm Fe, showed a rather low activity for the ODHP reaction at 723–823 K, with propene yields <10% and only traces of propionaldehyde. The relatively low propene yield over steamed H-ZSM-5 as compared to steam-activated iron zeolites strongly supports that the presence of iron in the formulation is predominantly responsible for the observed performance, as concluded in other N2O conversions over Fe-zeolites [7], [20].
The experimental data presented in this manuscript show that the performance (initial activity and deactivation behavior) of steam-activated FeMFI zeolite catalysts in the oxidative functionalization of propane depends on the nature of the oxidant and the forms of iron in the catalyst. The activity of the zeolites for direct N2O decomposition is iron-site sensitive too. Transient experiments in Fig. 7 can be used to explain the higher activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition compared to ex-Fe-silicalite. In agreement with previous transient studies [18], [19], the present TAP study has shown that O2 formation during direct N2O decomposition is a much slower process than N2 formation. Accordingly, the overall reaction rate of N2O decomposition should be limited by oxygen desorption from the catalyst surface leading to regeneration of the active site. This reaction is initiated by the activation of N2O on a vacant site, leading to O∗ species (Eq. (2)). Two different mechanisms were postulated for regeneration of the active site [21], [22]; the reaction of a second N2O molecule with the oxidized site (Eq. (3)) and the recombination of adsorbed oxygen atoms (Eq. (4)). Some of us concluded that O2 is mainly produced by recombination of atomic oxygen based on transient experiments in the Multitrack, in the temperature range of 573–973 K [18], [19], while Nobukawa et al. [23] obtained experimental evidence for Eq. (3) using an 18O-tracer technique at 693 K and atmospheric pressure. Although, the mechanism of O2 formation is not completely resolved, it is widely accepted that oxygen desorption is a rate-determining step during N2O decomposition over Fe-zeolites [18], [19], [23]:

In Section 3.3, it was shown that oxygen formation during direct N2O decomposition under both vacuum and ambient pressure conditions is faster over ex-FeZSM-5 than over ex-Fe-silicalite. As previously suggested [13], the above results confirm that a certain degree of iron association, in the form of oligonuclear iron oxo-clusters is required to achieve active catalysts for direct N2O decomposition via an improved O2 desorption.
The results of this paper convincingly show that at high temperatures, the activity in direct N2O decomposition and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with N2O correlate, which may suggest the participation of similar iron sites. This may be further discussed if we take into account that the atomic oxygen species in oligonuclear species are more mobile and reactive not only for recombination (Eq. (4)) but also for its transfer to the hydrocarbon molecule:
(5)
Another relevant aspect derived from our study is the fact that not all oxygen species formed upon N2O activation participate on propane activation. This is in line with previous observations on oxygen isotopic exchange [24] and CO oxidation [25] over Fe-MFI catalysts, precovered by oxygen species from N2O. For these reactions, it was observed that the number of deposited oxygen species by N2O largely exceeds the number of reactive oxygen species. Our results of sequential pulse experiments with N2O and C3H8 in Fig. 2 show that the degree of propane conversion decreases with an increased time delay between the N2O and C3H8 pulses. The reason for this observation should be related to an eventual transformation of short-living highly reactive atomic oxygen species into less reactive ones, since no gas-phase O2 was observed in the experiments. Under vacuum conditions of the TAP reactor, the zeolite matrix can be reduced, therefore, oxygen species deposited by N2O over Fe sites can be incorporated into zeolite matrix. Previous experiments on N2O decomposition over Cu- and Fe-zeolites with 18O-labeled N2O support this mechanism [26]. These authors assumed that N2O decomposes over iron sites resulting in 18O species followed by its incorporation into the zeolite matrix. This mechanism is suggested to prevail over ex-Fe-silicalite, where isolated iron ions are mainly present. For ex-FeZSM-5 with highly clustered iron species, an alternative mechanism can also be considered. Iron in oligonuclear iron species may experience reduction from Fe3+ to Fe2+ under vacuum conditions. The reduced Fe2+ species are easily re-oxidized to Fe3+ by oxygen species deposited by N2O. Thus, the conclusion is that the O∗ species deposited on active extraframework iron sites undergo a rapid transformation into oxygen-species (OΔ) with a different identity, loosing its unique catalytic properties:

4.2. Nature of the oxidant in propane functionalization
As shown in Section 3.2, the activity and selectivity (products distribution) of ODHP strongly depends on the nature of the oxidant applied (Fig. 3). Propene was the main olefine with both N2O and O2. However, the selectivity achieved is very low when dioxygen is used as the oxidant. A similar conclusion has been previously reported by Nowińska et al. [10] for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZSM-5 zeolite modified by transition metals. Such an effect of the oxidant on the catalytic performance can be associated to the oxidant active and the nature of the activated oxygen species. The unique ability of oxygen species formed from N2O over FeMFI catalysts for selective oxidation has been previously reported for various oxidative reactions [7], [9], [27]. Concerning dioxygen activation over different catalytic materials, both atomic (O, O− or O2−) and polyatomic adsorbed species (O2−, O22− or O32−) can be formed [28]. Although, direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O−, O2−) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2−, O32−) take part in COx formation [29], [30], [31]. Due to this complex spectrum of oxygen species, FeMFI catalysts are suggested to have lower catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction with O2 as compared to N2O.
Another important feature of the ODHP reaction with N2O is the formation of propionaldehyde as the main oxygenate. In the presence of O2, acroleine is formed in low amount. Panov et al. [32], [33] reported non-catalytic oxidation of different alkenes in the liquid phase using N2O as oxidant. Respective aldehydes and ketons are the main reaction products. In our study we found that the selectivity towards propionaldehyde is increased when propene is added to the C3H8–N2O feed mixture (Fig. 6). This indicates that oxygen species deposited by N2O over certain Fe sites are able to selectively oxidize propene to propionaldehyde. From the selectivity–conversion plots in Fig. 5, the possibility for direct oxidation of propane to propionaldehyde cannot be excluded. However, this reaction route should play a minor role in the formation of this aldehyde, since no oxygenates were observed during TAP experiments. Based on these data, a simplified scheme for selective routes of propane oxidation in the presence of N2O can be suggested, where propane is primarily converted to propene and propionaldehyde, followed by secondary oxidation of propene to propionaldehyde (Fig. 9). From our experiment it cannot be concluded whether propene and propionaldehyde are alternatively formed via fast dehydration or oxidation of intermediate alcohols (n-propanol, i-propanol), respectively. Alcohols have been previously reported to be primary formed from different alkanes over FeZSM-5 in the presence of N2O at room temperature [27], [34], [35]. However, it has to be noted that alcohols were never detected in the gas phase. Therefore, we assume that direct oxidation of propane to propene and propene to propionaldehyde should be the main reaction route of propene and propionaldehyde formation, respectively. When O2 is used as the oxidant, COx is the major product. This means that in comparison to N2O, activation of molecular oxygen on iron species results in formation of other oxygen species, which is not selective and leads to total combustion of propane and propene.

Summarizing, the presence of iron is a precondition for high activity and selectivity of FeMFI zeolites in direct N2O decomposition as well as in the N2O-mediated oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene and propionaldehyde. The structure of iron species is also a crucial feature. A certain degree of iron clustering in the form of extraframework oligonuclear iron oxo-clusters, confined in the zeolite channels, is beneficial to achieve improved ODHP performances. However, assuming that the same oxygen species is formed from N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite, the better catalytic performance of the former as compared to the latter cannot be only explained by the number, structure (nature), and distribution of Fe species. Catalyst acidity may play a role in the selective propane oxidation [11], as have been already postulated for other catalytic reactions [36], [37]. However, no strong conclusion can be drawn based on the present results.
5. Conclusions
The following conclusions can be derived from this study:
•
Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative functionalization of propane to propene and propionaldehyde. The performance of Fe-zeolites in the reaction of propane with O2 is poor, leading to low propane conversions and propene selectivity (mainly COx formation). This further highlights the specificity of N2O as monooxygen donor in selective oxidations and the capability of determined iron species in the zeolites for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species.
A parallel-consecutive reaction scheme for propionaldehyde from propane and propene is suggested for the oxidative functionalization of propane with N2O. The consecutive propene transformation to propionaldehyde is assumed to be the main reaction pathway of propionaldehyde formation. This indicates a unique ability of atomic oxygen species deposited over iron sites upon N2O decomposition for its selective incorporation into more reactive olefines.
•
Compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, ex-FeZSM-5 shows a superior performance (activity and selectivity) in the oxidative conversion of C3H8 with N2O, as well as a higher resistance to deactivation by coking. The same activity order was found in direct N2O decomposition, suggesting that a similar type of iron centers are actively involved in both N2O conversions.
•
The nature and distribution of iron species determines the catalytic performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites. The higher activity of ex-FeZSM-5 is related to the presence of oligonuclear FexOy clusters, which favor the catalytic performance as compared to extraframework isolated iron ions predominant in ex-Fe-silicalite. The latter sample also contains a certain (small) fraction of iron in tetrahedral framework positions, which is not active.
•
The higher activity of ex-FeZSM-5 for direct N2O decomposition is related to the easier recombination of atomic oxygen species (rate-determining step) over oligonuclear iron clusters, which is a difficult step over isolated ions. This is concluded from the lower apparent activation energy of O2 formation in ex-FeZSM-5 during N2O decomposition at ambient pressure and the narrow oxygen response derived from transient experiments in vacuum.
•
Active oxygen species deposited over iron centers in FeMFI zeolites upon N2O activation possess a certain lifetime under vacuum conditions. A fraction of these reactive species transforms into other non-reactive oxygen species. Since no gas-phase oxygen was observed, probably reactive oxygen species fills oxygen vacancies of the zeolite framework.
