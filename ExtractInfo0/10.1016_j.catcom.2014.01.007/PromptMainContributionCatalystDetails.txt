Direct dehydrogenation of n-butane over Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts: Effect of third metal (M) addition




1. Introduction
C4 olefins (butenes and butadiene) have been used as basic materials for the production of plastics, synthetic rubbers, automotive fuel components, and petrochemical products [1]. Catalytic cracking of heavy paraffins over acid catalysts such as silica–alumina and zeolite is a traditional route for the production of C4 olefins [2]. 1-Butene can also be produced via ethylene dimerization over titanium- or nickel-based catalysts, and 2-butene can also be produced through isomerization of 1-butene over sulfate catalysts [3], [4]. However, dehydrogenation of n-butane has attracted recent attention as an economical and promising process for the production of C4 olefins to meet the increasing demand for butenes and butadiene [5]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane and n-butene using oxygen as a reactant is thermodynamically favorable due to the exothermic nature. Transition metals such as magnesium vanadate, pyrophosphate, and nickel molybdate catalysts are usually used for the oxidative dehydrogenation [6]. However, the practical application of this process has some problems such as direct combustion of hydrocarbon and formation of carbon dioxide lowing product selectivity [7]. On the other hand, direct dehydrogenation of n-butane with noble metal or chromium catalysts is operated at high temperature. Although side reactions such as coke formation and cracking are inevitable, high selectivity and yield for n-butene and 1,3-butadiene can be obtained in the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane [8]. Therefore, direct dehydrogenation of n-butane has been recognized as a promising process for producing C4 olefins, which are important raw materials for plastics.
Platinum–tin catalysts supported on alumina have been widely investigated in the direct dehydrogenation processes. It is known that platinum is an active metal and tin is used as a promoter to enhance desired dehydrogenation reactions [9]. Platinum promotes the formation of monoolefins and diolefins from the corresponding feed paraffin. The role of tin as a promoter is to weaken the platinum–olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum–paraffin interaction [10]. Because of the endothermic nature of dehydrogenation of n-butane, however, high reaction temperature is required to obtain high conversion [11]. Under this severe reaction condition, coke formation causing catalyst deactivation is inevitable.
To overcome this problem, addition of alkali metals such as Li, Na, K, and Rb to Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst has been attempted [12], [13]. In particular, the addition of K to Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst resulted in high selectivity toward iso-butene in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane by suppressing strong acidity of support [14]. ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 have also been used as supports due to their high thermal stabilities and their neutral characteristics to enhance the resistance against catalyst deactivation [15]. Nawaz et al. reported the activity integration of Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst by adding Na, La, Ca, Zn, In, or Ce in the propane dehydrogenation, and they found that the catalytic activity was improved over Pt–Sn–Ca/SAPO-34 catalyst [16], [17]. It was also reported that doping of Zn on Pt–Sn/ZSM-5 catalyst resulted in low olefin selectivity and increased deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation [18]. However, systematic investigations on the effect of third metal addition on the catalytic activities of Pt–Sn catalysts supported on Al2O3 in the n-butane dehydrogenation have been rarely reported. Therefore, this work was focused on finding a favorable third metal (M) to produce n-butenes and 1,3-butadiene with an enhanced yield in the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane over Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. Characterization of Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for elucidating their catalytic activities was also investigated.
A series of Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with different third metal (M = Zn, In, Y, Bi, and Ga) were prepared by a sequential impregnation method, and they were applied to the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane. The effect of a third metal addition on the physicochemical properties and catalytic activities of Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane was investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts
A series of Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with different third metal (M = Zn, In, Y, Bi, and Ga) were prepared by a sequential impregnation method [19]. Commercially available γ-Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar, SBET: 220 m2/g) was used as a support. M/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by an impregnation method using an excess aqueous solution of third metal (M) precursor (metal nitrate hydrate, Sigma–Aldrich). After impregnation, it was dried at 80 °C overnight and calcined at 600 °C in air for 4 h. Sn precursor (Tin (II) chloride dihydrate, Sigma–Aldrich) was then impregnated on the prepared M/γ-Al2O3 using hydrochloric acid. It was dried at 80 °C overnight and calcined at 600 °C in air for 4 h. For the preparation of Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, Pt precursor (Chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate, Sigma–Aldrich) was impregnated on the prepared Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, followed by drying at 80 °C overnight and calcination at 550 °C in air for 4 h. The contents of Pt, Sn, and third metal in the Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were fixed at 1 wt.%, 1 wt.%, and 0.5 wt.%, respectively. For reference, Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was also prepared with the above-mentioned procedures in the absence of third metal.
2.2. Characterization
Crystalline phases of reduced catalysts were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (D-MAX2500-PC, Rigaku). In order to examine the metal–support interaction of the catalysts, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out in a conventional flow system equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 900 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. For the TPR experiment, a mixed stream of H2 stream (2 ml/min) and N2 stream (20 ml/min) was supplied for 0.1 g of catalyst. Hydrogen chemisorption experiments (BELCAT-B, BEL Japan) were conducted to measure Pt dispersion and Pt surface area of the catalysts. 50 mg of each catalyst was preliminarily reduced at 570 °C for 3 h, and then it was purged with argon (50 ml/min) at 570 °C for 10 min and cooled to 50 °C. The amount of hydrogen uptake was measured by periodically injecting diluted hydrogen gas (5% hydrogen and 95% argon) into the reduced catalyst. Hydrogen gas can be adsorbed in a different manner compared to pure Pt, either by changing chemisorption stoichiometry of adsorbate on Pt due to the addition of tin and third metal (M) or by forming Pt–Sn alloy [20], [21]. However, change of chemisorption stoichiometry (H/Pt) caused by the addition of tin and third metal (M) is still controversial. It is generally known that Sn, Zn, In, Ga, and Bi hardly adsorb hydrogen molecule [22]. Therefore, Pt dispersion and Pt surface area were calculated by assuming that one hydrogen atom occupies one surface platinum atom [20]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses (ThermoVG, SIGMA PROBE) were conducted to measure binding energies of Pt 4f7/2 and Sn 3d5/2 using C 1s peak (284.5 eV) as a reference.
2.3. Direct dehydrogenation of n-butane
Direct dehydrogenation of n-butane to n-butene and 1,3-butadiene was carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at 550 °C under atmosphere pressure. Each catalyst (0.5 g) was pre-reduced with a mixed stream of H2 (600 ml/h) and N2 (600 ml/h) at 570 °C for 3 h. For the reaction, n-butane was continuously supplied into the reactor with nitrogen carrier. Feed composition was fixed at n-butane:nitrogen = 1:1. Gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was fixed at 600 ml/h g-cat on the basis of n-butane. Reaction gas products were periodically sampled and analyzed with gas chromatographs. Conversion of n-butane and selectivity for total dehydrogenation products (TDP, n-butene and 1,3-butadiene) were calculated on the basis of carbon balance as follows. Yield for TDP was calculated by multiplying conversion of n-butane and selectivity for TDP.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Formation of Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 (M = Zn, In, Y, Bi, and Ga) catalysts reduced at 570 °C for 3 h. No distinctive diffraction peaks were detected in the Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts compared to Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Only characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to γ-Al2O3 were observed in all the catalysts [23]. Any diffraction peaks of platinum and tin species were not observed, due to their small crystalline size or low concentration [24].

3.2. Catalytic performance of Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts
Fig. 2 shows the catalytic performance of Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 (M = Zn, In, Y, Bi, and Ga) catalysts with time on stream in the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane at 550 °C. All the catalysts experienced a catalyst deactivation, which was a typical behavior of direct dehydrogenation of paraffins. However, the catalytic performance and stability strongly depended on the identity of third metal component. Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3, Pt/Sn/Y/γ-Al2O3, Pt/Sn/Bi/γ-Al2O3, and Pt/Sn/Ga/γ-Al2O3 catalysts exhibited a sharp decrease of catalytic activity compared to Pt/Sn/Zn/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/In/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. Catalytic performance of Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts obtained after a 360 min-reaction is shown in Fig. 3. Moreover, conversion of n-butane and selectivity for reaction products obtained after 60 min-reaction and 360 min-reaction are listed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, isobutene, iso-butane, C1–C3 compounds (methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene), and C5–C6 compounds (n-pentane, isopentane, 3-methyl-k1-butene, 2-methyl-1-butene, isopentene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, and n-hexane) were produced as by-products together with target products (1-butene, 2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene). 1-Butene and 2-butene were mainly produced via dehydrogenation of n-butane. Formation of 1-butene and 2-butene through ethylene dimerization and cracking of C5–C6 compounds was negligible. In addition, 1.3-butadiene was mainly produced by the dehydrogenation of n-butene during the reaction. Low selectivity for 1,3-butadiene was due to thermodynamic equilibrium limitation. It is believed that C1–C3 compounds were produced by the hydrocracking while C5–C6 compounds were produced by oligomerization and polymerization of hydrocarbon species. Selectivities for C1–C3 and C5–C6 compounds were not significantly changed with the addition of third metal (M) to Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3. Although selectivity for 1-butene itself was not high in this work, selectivity for 1-butene was definitely increased by the addition Zn to Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Moreover, selectivity for TDP including 2-butene was the highest over Pt/Sn/Zn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Selectivities for 1-butene, 2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene were found to be 20.7%, 42.4%, and 5.2%, respectively, in the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane at 550 °C after a 360 min-reaction over Pt/Sn/Zn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Furthermore, among the catalysts tested, Pt/Sn/Zn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest conversion of n-butane and the highest yield for TDP at the initial and final stage of the reaction. Deactivation rate of the catalysts is also summarized in Table 1. As expected, Pt/Sn/Zn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst showed the lowest deactivation rate. Conversion of n-butane and yield for TDP after a 360 min-reaction decreased in the order of Pt/Sn/Zn/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/In/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/Y/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/Bi/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/Ga/γ-Al2O3. Among the catalysts tested, Pt/Sn/Zn/γ-Al2O3 showed the best catalytic performance and stability in the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane. For comparison, direct dehydrogenation of n-butane over ZnSn/Al2O3 catalyst was also carried out. However, the catalytic performance was quite low; yield for TDP was about 0.6% and selectivity for TDP was about 6% after a 360-min reaction. Low catalytic performance of ZnSn/Al2O3 was due to the absence of active Pt metal.

3.3. Metal–support interaction in the Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts
TPR measurements were carried out to examine the interaction between metal species and support in the Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 (M = Zn, In, Y, Bi, and Ga) catalysts, as shown in Fig. 4. It is known that Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst showed two reduction bands; a reduction band at around 250 °C is ascribed to the reduction of Pt oxide species, while a broad reduction band at around 500 °C is due to partial reduction of Sn4 + to Sn2 + and Sn2 + to Sn0 [25], [26]. When the third metal was added into Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, all the catalysts showed an obviously different reduction band at around 250 °C. This reduction band was attributed to the reduction of Pt oxide, a small fraction of Sn oxide, and the other metal oxide species [27]. However, the reduction band at around 500 °C was not clear due to partial reduction of tin oxide. It is suggested that Pt, Sn, and third metal (M) coexist intimately, and interaction between Pt, Sn, and M affects the spatial distribution of these components on the catalyst surface [28]. It should be noted that the reduction peak temperature at around 250 °C was different depending on the identity of third metal, indicating that the third metal significantly affected the metal–support interaction in our catalyst system. The reduction peak temperature decreased in the order of Pt/Sn/Zn/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/In/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/Y/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/Bi/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/Ga/γ-Al2O3. It is believed that platinum–alumina interaction and tin–alumina interaction increased by the addition of Zn to Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst due to favorable spatial distribution of metal components. This trend was well consistent with the trend of catalytic activity (Fig. 3).

3.4. Pt dispersion and Pt surface area in the reduced Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts
Hydrogen chemisorption measurements were conducted to determine Pt dispersion and Pt surface area in the reduced Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 (M = Zn, In, Y, Bi, and Ga) catalysts. Hydrogen chemisorption results for the reduced catalysts are listed in Table 2. The amount of hydrogen uptake on the reduced catalysts decreased in the order of Pt/Sn/Zn/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/In/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/Y/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/Bi/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/Ga/γ-Al2O3. As a consequence, Pt dispersion and Pt surface area decreased in the order of Pt/Sn/Zn/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/In/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/Y/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/Bi/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/Ga/γ-Al2O3. Pt particle size increased in the order of Pt/Sn/Zn/γ-Al2O3 < Pt/Sn/In/γ-Al2O3 < Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 < Pt/Sn/Y/γ-Al2O3 < Pt/Sn/Bi/γ-Al2O3 < Pt/Sn/Ga/γ-Al2O3. These trends were well consistent with the trends of catalytic activity (Fig. 3) and TPR results (Fig. 4). When the metal–support interaction was strong, Pt species were well dispersed on the support and Pt particle size decreased. That is, strong surface interaction retarded agglomeration of Pt particles and increased Pt surface area by decreasing Pt particle size. Pt/Sn/Zn/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/In/γ-Al2O3 catalysts showed high Pt dispersion because chemical interactions between Pt, Sn, and Zn (or In) affected either the degree of Pt sintering during calcination or the properties of surface of active metal [29]. It is believed that zinc served as an efficient spacer to reduce the size of platinum ensemble as tin acted as a spacer in the Pt–Sn catalyst [30], [31].

3.5. Electronic effect in the reduced Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts
To investigate the chemical state of metal components, XPS analyses were carried out. XPS spectra of Sn 3d5/2 levels for the reduced catalysts are shown in Fig. 5, and the measured binding energies of Pt 4f7/2 and Sn 3d5/2 and surface atomic ratio are summarized in Table 3. All the catalysts showed binding energy of single Pt 4f7/2 component at 71.7-72.3 eV, indicating the presence of zerovalent platinum [32]. In general, Sn 3d5/2 peak can be divided into zerovalent tin, alloyed tin, oxidized tin and chlorinated tin [33]. As shown in Fig. 5, however, only two Sn 3d5/2 components were observed in our catalyst system; the component at lower binding energy of 485.3–486.2 eV corresponded to alloyed tin, while that at higher binding energy of 487.1–487.6 eV was oxidized tin (II, IV) [34]. Any peaks related to zerovalent tin and chlorinated tin were not detected.

When the third metal was added into Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, binding energy of each component was changed. It can be inferred that Pt was alloyed with Sn or electronically modified by the third metal. In case of Pt/Sn/Zn/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/In/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, which showed an excellent catalytic activity, high surface atomic ratio of Pt/Al and high percentage of alloyed tin were observed. In case of Pt/Sn/Bi/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/Ga/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, however, the percentage of oxidized tin species was higher than that of alloyed tin species, blocking zerovalent Pt atom and diluting Pt ensemble [35].
3.6. Correlations between catalytic performance and catalytic properties
Fig. 6 shows the correlations between catalytic performance and catalytic properties. Yield for TDP increased with increasing TPR peak temperature and with increasing Pt surface area. The correlations clearly showed that metal–support interaction and Pt surface area played key roles in determining the catalytic performance of Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. Among the catalysts tested, Pt/Sn/Zn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, which retained the strongest metal–support interaction and the highest Pt surface area, exhibited the best catalytic performance in the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane.

4. Conclusions
A series of Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with different third metal (M = Zn, In, Y, Bi, and Ga) were prepared by a sequential impregnation method for use in the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane to n-butene and 1,3-butadiene. The effect of third metal addition on the physicochemical properties and catalytic activities of Pt/Sn/M/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was investigated. It was found that chemical and electronic properties of the catalysts were affected by the addition of third metal. Yield for TDP decreased in the order of Pt/Sn/Zn/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/In/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/Y/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/Bi/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/Sn/Ga/γ-Al2O3. Metal–support interaction and Pt surface area played important roles in determining the catalytic performance. Yield for TDP increased with increasing metal–support interaction and Pt surface area of the catalyst. Among the catalysts tested, Pt/Sn/Zn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, which retained the strongest metal–support interaction and the highest Pt surface area, showed the best catalytic performance and stability in the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane.

Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
