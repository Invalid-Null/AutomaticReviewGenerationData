Ultrafast Encapsulation of Metal Nanoclusters into MFI Zeolite in the Course of Its Crystallization: Catalytic Application for Propane Dehydrogenation

Graphical Abstract
Overcoming the mismatch between the rapid formation of nanoclusters and the slow crystallization of zeolites allows the in situ encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into zeolites in just a few minutes. The resultant Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 shows excellent activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
Abstract
Encapsulating metal nanoclusters into zeolites combines the superior catalytic activity of the nanoclusters with high stability and unique shape selectivity of the crystalline microporous materials. The preparation of such bifunctional catalysts, however, is often restricted by the mismatching in time scale between the fast formation of nanoclusters and the slow crystallization of zeolites. We herein demonstrate a novel strategy to overcome the mismatching issue, in which the crystallization of zeolites is expedited so as to synchronize it with the rapid formation of nanoclusters. The concept was demonstrated by confining Pt and Sn nanoclusters into a ZSM-5 (MFI) zeolite in the course of its crystallization, leading to an ultrafast, in situ encapsulation within just 5 min. The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibited exceptional activity and selectivity with stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. This method of ultrafast encapsulation opens up a new avenue for designing and synthesizing composite zeolitic materials with structural and compositional complexity.

Functional metallic particles (e.g., Au, Pt and Pd), when downsized to a few nanometers or sub-nanometer, can exhibit superior catalytic activity due to unique electronic structure and increased exposure of active sites.1 These metal nanoclusters, however, are susceptible to high temperature environment and suffer from fast deactivation as a result of severe aggregation.2 Various supports have been developed to stabilize the nanoclusters, among which zeolites are most promising thanks to their well-defined, nanoscale frameworks as well as high thermal and chemical stability.1c, 3 Encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into zeolites enables a synergistic effect in heterogeneous catalysis that combines superior activity of the nanoclusters with high stability and unique shape selectivity of the zeolites.4 The fabrication of such metal-nanocluster-encapsulated zeolites, however, is not straightforward. Due to high surface free energy of the metal species, they tend to agglomerate and precipitate very fast, in particular, under harsh conditions of zeolite synthesis (e.g., strong alkalinity and high temperature);5 whereas the crystallization of zeolites typically takes a much longer time.6 This mismatching in time scale between the fast precipitation of metals and the slow crystallization of zeolites makes an effective encapsulation a daunting challenge (Figure 1 a). Post-synthesis encapsulation can circumvent the mismatching issue in a stepwise manner, where the zeolite synthesis and the introduction of the metal species are carried out in sequence. Nevertheless, this method is not only time-consuming but also restricted to large-pore zeolites whose internal pores/cavities are accessible to metallic precursors. In situ encapsulation methods, in which the metal clusters are encapsulated in the course of zeolite crystallization, is more desirable. In general, the existing in situ encapsulation methods rely on protective strategies that slow down the formation and the subsequent aggregation of metal clusters so as to synchronize with the zeolite crystallization (Figure 1 b). However, such methods come with a high cost in terms of time, energy and consumption of protective agents.

In addressing the low efficiency of the conventional synthesis of zeolites, our group has established an ultrafast route for zeolite synthesis.7 In the ultrafast synthesis, a tubular reactor featuring fast heating is used as the reaction vessel, and approaches such as aging and seeding are adopted to address bottlenecks in the crystallization process, the combination of which leads to the synthesis of a class of important zeolites in only several minutes.8 The ultrafast synthesis of zeolites enabled the establishment of continuous-flow synthesis of zeolites, which could greatly increase the space-time yield of zeolite production.9
We herein report that the ultrafast synthesis of zeolites offers a unique opportunity to address the above-mentioned mismatching issue from a completely different perspective. That is, the crystallization of zeolites can be expedited to accommodate the rapid formation of metal nanocluster, thus enabling an ultrafast in situ encapsulation. In this work, we focus on encapsulating Pt and Sn nanoclusters into a high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite to demonstrate the proof of concept. The in situ encapsulation can proceed very fast and complete in just a few minutes, where ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization. The role of Sn is supposed to modulate the interaction between the Pt precursor and the zeolite precursor, thus affecting size and dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters. The resultant nanoclusters-encapsulated ZSM-5 (Pt/Sn-ZSM-5) catalyst exhibits an excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, an industrially important reaction for propene production. Moreover, the high activity and selectivity of the catalyst can be maintained even after multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration at high temperatures, evidencing that the ultrafast encapsulation of metal clusters in the course of zeolite crystallization is of great success. This facile method enriches the toolbox for the preparation of nanocluster-encapsulated zeolites and opens up a new avenue for designing and synthesizing metal-zeolite composite materials with structural and compositional complexity.
As schematically illustrated in Figure 1 c, the ultrafast in situ encapsulation was achieved through a one-pot synthesis without the addition of any protective agent. Pt(NH3)2(NO3)2 (8.5 wt % in HNO3 solution) and SnCl4 were chosen as Pt and Sn precursors, respectively. The metal precursors were added into an aged aluminosilicate precursor for synthesizing high-silica ZSM-5, which had a composition of 50 NaOH: Al2O3: 300 SiO2: 20 TPAOH: 2300 H2O: 0.55 Pt(NH3)2(NO3)2: 0.92 SnCl4. The resultant mixture was stirred for 10 min, followed by sonication for 30 min, to ensure that the metal precursors were homogenously dispersed. The homogenized mixture was transferred into a tubular reactor, which was then subject to hydrothermal synthesis at 190 °C for a certain time (details see the Supplementary Information and Figure S1).
Figure 2 a shows the XRD patterns of the products synthesized over different periods of time. Highly crystalline Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite was obtained in just 5 min; and, no diffraction peak corresponding to Pt and/or Sn bulk species was observed, indicating the absence of any large metal particles. Figure 2 b and c show a high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and corresponding Pt/Sn particle size distribution of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 synthesized for 5 min, which confirm the presence of nanoclusters of ca. 1 nm in crystalline ZSM-5 zeolite and their distribution. We note that the heavy Pt or Sn nanoclusters can be seen as brighter dot contrasts even embedded within the zeolite because of the Z-contrast nature of the HAADF-STEM image.10 The X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) mapping in Figure S2 indicates that both Pt and Sn were homogenously distributed in the zeolite. The Si/Al ratio of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite was 129; and Pt loading and Sn loading were about 0.32 wt % and 0.75 wt %, as determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). These results demonstrate that the zeolite crystallization synchronized with the formation of nanoclusters, both of which proceeded very fast, leading to the successful in situ encapsulation on the order of minutes. For comparison, the encapsulation experiment was carried out in a conventional autoclave with the same recipe. The TEM image in Figure S3 shows that the product in the autoclave contained large particles. An impregnated sample with the same amounts of Pt and Sn was also prepared. As seen from the TEM image in Figure S4, the impregnated sample contained metal nanoparticles of a much larger size, probably because the pores of MFI zeolite were mostly inaccessible to the metal precursors, resulting in unrestricted growth upon the calcination at high temperature.

Frequency density denotes relative frequency of each bin divided by bin width. d) Relative crystallinity and compositional evolution of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 samples synthesized over different periods. The crystallinity of the solid product was calculated on the basis of the areas of the peaks ranging from 20 to 30° and the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 product synthesized at 190 °C for 5 min was chosen as the standard for the calculation. e) UV-vis spectra of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 samples synthesized over different times.
To understand how the nanoclusters were confined simultaneously during the crystallization of the high-silica ZSM-5, the products synthesized over different times were carefully analyzed. Results of elemental analysis in Figure 2 d indicate that Pt and Sn exhibited very different evolutions in the process of the encapsulation. The Sn loading in the solid products maintained almost identical from the initial point to the completion of the crystallization, which is likely because of the strong interaction between the Sn species and the silica matrix.11 On the contrary, the Pt loading in the solid products experienced an apparent increase. It is worth noting that the sharp increase of Pt loading with the synthesis time displays an analogous tendency to the increase of zeolite crystallinity, strongly evidencing that the formation of Pt nanoclusters and the crystallization of ZSM-5 indeed proceeded in the same ultrafast pace. TEM images in Figure S5 depict that the amount of Pt nanoclusters grew along with the transformation from amorphous precursor to crystalline zeolite. Although the Sn content remained almost constant throughout the crystallization, its speciation evolved considerably as reflected by the UV-vis spectra in Figure 2 e. At the early stage of the synthesis (i.e., 30 s and 1 min), a band centered at ca. 250 nm is observed, which is attributed to SnO2 in amorphous silica.12 Meanwhile, a well-defined band centered at ca. 203 nm was also present, which is assigned to the Sn species in tetrahedral coordination. As discussed in the previous works, a part of the Sn species can be tetrahedrally grafted into the silica matrix, even if the latter is still amorphous in terms of long-range order.13 With prolonging the synthesis time, the intensity of the band around 250 nm declined and the one at ca. 203 nm slightly shifted to left, implying that more Sn species became incorporated in the zeolite framework. While some Sn species continued to be present as extra-framework SnO2 nanoclusters that were highly dispersed, as seen from the TEM image of a Sn-ZSM-5 (Figure S6). The Pt nanoclusters featured adsorption bands at 216 nm and 281 nm; due to overlapping with the bands from the Sn species, the evolution of Pt speciation cannot be identified from the UV-vis spectra.
The in situ encapsulation was conducted at different temperatures to investigate how the synthesis temperature affects the interplay between zeolite crystallization and nanocluster formation. Figure 3 a shows the crystallization curves at different synthesis temperatures, which were derived from the XRD peak areas in Figure 1 a and Figure S7. Both the crystallization of ZSM-5 and the formation of Pt nanoclusters were variant with temperature. As an example, Figure S8 shows the evolution of Pt and Sn contents in the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 samples synthesized at 170 °C, which gives a similar trend to that obtained at 190 °C. Since the in situ encapsulation was dependent on temperature, the crystallization time as well as the Pt content can be tuned by adjusting the synthesis temperature. Figure 3 b displays the composition information of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites synthesized at 150 °C, 170 °C, 190 °C and 210 °C for 20 min, 10 min, 5 min and 2 min, respectively. The Pt content increased with temperature, while the Sn content maintained reasonably identical. Apparently, a higher synthesis temperature shortened the time required for completing the in situ encapsulation. The SEM images in Figure S9 demonstrate that the particle size of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite decreased with the increase of the synthesis temperature. Figure 3 c shows the TEM image of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite synthesized at 210 °C for 2 min. The nanoclusters were of slightly larger size compared to those synthesized at 190 °C, probably due to the faster aggregation at a higher synthesis temperature. The states of Pt and Sn species, however, were not much affected by the synthesis temperature, as indicated by the UV-vis spectra in Figure S10.

The addition of Sn was found to be crucial to regulating the size as well as the dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters. Figure 4 a–d displays the TEM images of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites, which were synthesized with different Sn contents while maintaining the same Pt loading (ca. 0.32 wt %). Without the addition of any Sn, the Pt species tended to agglomerate and form nanoparticles of ca. 4 nm. When an approximately equivalent amount of Sn was added, the size of the Pt nanoclusters was decreased and the dispersion was much improved. An optimal Pt/Sn ratio (in weight) was found to be about 1:2, which resulted in Pt nanoclusters with a size of ca. 1 nm. Further increase in the Sn content led to nanoclusters of a slightly larger size and of a higher amount, probably due to the emergence of the extra-framework Sn species as visible nanoclusters. Fixing the Sn loading at about 0.75 wt %, a Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite with a higher Pt loading (ca. 0.65 wt %) could be obtained, which contained well-dispersed Pt nanoclusters with a size of about 2.5 nm (Figure S11).

To investigate the interaction between Pt and Sn, the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites with different Pt/Sn ratios were characterized by UV-vis, CO infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As seen from the UV-vis spectra of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites differing in Sn loading (Figure 4 e), intensities of the bands attributable to the Sn species increased with Sn loading. In particular, the band at 250 nm was much pronounced for the sample with the highest Sn loading due to the presence of more extra-framework Sn species, which explains the higher amount of nanoclusters observed by TEM (Figure 4 d). Based on the UV-vis spectra, we were not able to quantify the amount of framework Sn but considered it to be low. The fact that only limited Sn species entered the zeolite framework in the synthesis was also confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of adsorbed acetonitrile over a Sn-ZSM-5, where no spectral feature associated with framework Sn sites was observed (Figure S12).
Figure 4 f shows the FTIR spectra of adsorbed CO over the different zeolites, which were obtained by subtracting the background spectra from those measured after the introduction of CO. No band was observed on the Sn-ZSM-5 due to lack of CO coverage on the Sn species. A strong band at about 2076 cm−1 is observed in all Pt-containing samples, which is assigned to linear CO adsorption on metallic Pt with saturated and unsaturated coordination.14 The center of the peak, however, shifts slightly to a lower frequency with increasing the Sn content. This peak shift is primarily due to the electron donation from Sn species to neighboring Pt species, which leads to back donation of electrons from Pt to anti-bonding 2π* orbital of CO and thus weakens its vibration frequency.15 The FTIR band becomes broader with the increase of Sn loading, indicating that electronic environments of the Pt species were more heterogeneous as a result of varying degrees of Pt-Sn interactions. Furthermore, a band at even lower frequency (ca. 1962 cm−1) is observed in the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5. This downward shift by about 100 cm−1 reflects a much stronger interaction likely arising from the formation of Pt-Sn alloys.16 In contrast, the band at 1962 cm−1 is less pronounced in the impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5, indicating that the formation of Pt-Sn alloys was not likely.
Figure 4 g shows the XPS spectra of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites in the region of Pt 4f and Al 2p. Since XPS is a surface-sensitive method, peak intensity in the region of Pt 4f was rather weak. The Pt loading calculated from XPS was about 0.13 wt %, much lower than that determined by ICP-AES, which indicates that the majority of the Pt species existed inside the zeolite.17 Despite the presence of intense peak of Al 2p at ca. 73.6 eV that is attributable to the framework Al atoms (see Figure S13), the Pt 4f peak at ca. 71.5 eV that is assigned to metallic Pt can be observed.18 The Pt 4f peak shifted toward a lower binding energy for the Sn-containing samples as a result of electron donation from Sn to Pt, which evidences that electronic environments around the Pt species were altered due to the presence of Sn species.19 The latter was mainly present as SnOx, as indicated by the XPS spectra in the Sn 3d region (Figure S14). These characterization results collectively demonstrate that the introduction of Sn species to the in situ encapsulation can alter electronic structures of the Pt species, resulting in the formation of nanoclusters in proximity to the Sn species.
The effectiveness of the ultrafast encapsulation was verified by testing the catalytic activities of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, a catalytic reaction of high potential for facilitating propene production and thus attracting a great attention toward catalyst innovation.20 A high-silica ZSM-5 of sodium form (Na-ZSM-5) was first tested and found to be inactive (Figure S15), suggesting that neither Brønsted acid site nor the residual Na+ could catalyze the propane dehydrogenation. The Pt-ZSM-5 prepared through the ultrafast encapsulation was active initially but experienced a fast deactivation (Figure 5 a), with the propane conversion rapidly decreasing from 40 % to 10 % after 3 h. The rapid deactivation is mainly due to the Pt-ZSM-5 contained Pt nanoparticles of large size (ca. 4 nm). Sn has been considered as a promotor in Pt-containing zeolites for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, which can in particular help improve the selectivity.21 The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite prepared by the impregnation method, which was described above (Figure S4), was tested as comparison. As seen from Figure 5 b, a high selectivity of about 98 % was achieved, which is probably due to the suppression of side reactions under an optimal Sn/Pt ratio of about 2.22 However, this catalyst also suffered from fast deactivation, implying that the metal clusters deposited on the zeolite were likely to experience severe aggregation in the high-temperature environment (Figure S16), resulting in a rapid deactivation. In stark contrast, the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 prepared via the ultrafast encapsulation exhibited a much longer lifetime while maintaining high conversion and selectivity. As shown in Figure 5 c, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited a high conversion of about 70 % in the beginning, and the conversion remained as high as 45 % even after running for 24 h. The selectivity was about 99 % throughout the long-time reaction. Furthermore, this Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst presented a high activity and selectivity even after being regenerated through oxidation in air and subsequent reduction in hydrogen, both carried out at 600 °C. After these cycles of reaction and regeneration, the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst still featured well-dispersed nanoclusters, as indicated by the TEM images of the used catalyst in Figure S17. The excellent performance of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 is attributed to the highly dispersed Pt nanoclusters in the Sn-containing zeolite matrix, evidencing that the ultrafast encapsulation was of great success.

Reaction conditions: 100 mg catalyst stuffed in a quartz tube was reduced in H2 atmosphere with a flow of 17.5 mL min−1 at 600 °C for 2 h. After the reduction pretreatment, the system was purged with N2 flow of 5 mL min−1 for 15 min and the feed was switched to a gas containing 1.5 mL min−1 C3H8 and 5 mL min−1 N2 as balance gas. The dehydrogenation reaction was performed at 600 °C with a WHSV of 5.2 h−1.
In summary, taking Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 as an example, we present a novel strategy that overcomes the mismatching in time scale between the formation of nanoclusters and the crystallization of zeolites, leading to the ultrafast in situ encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into zeolites in just a few minutes. The resultant Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 shows excellent stability and activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The concept of ultrafast encapsulation can be extended to the preparation of other composite porous materials (e.g., functional species confined in zeolites or metal-organic framework materials), where mismatching in time scale of different processes often causes problems. As an example, Figure S18 shows TEM images of Pt-*BEA and Pt-ERI zeolites, both of which were synthesized directly from a mixture of an aluminosilicate precursor and the Pt precursor for 1 h at 190 °C and 4 h at 150 °C, respectively. The well-dispersed Pt nanoclusters of approximately 2 nm in the highly crystalline *BEA and ERI zeolites shows that the ultrafast method of in situ encapsulation has promise as a general method. From another point of view, the ultrafast encapsulation foresees a continuous-flow process that further facilitates the preparation of the metal-encapsulated zeolites as a booming class of catalysts. Meanwhile, investigations regarding the manipulation of the particle size and position of metal clusters will be pursued.
