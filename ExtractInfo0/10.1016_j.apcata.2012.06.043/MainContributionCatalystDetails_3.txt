The provided document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) for converting propane to propylene. The document focuses on fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of heavy hydrocarbon feeds to produce light olefins like propylene. While propylene production is discussed, there is no mention of PDH or ODH processes that specifically target propane conversion to propylene. The catalysts and conditions examined are not utilized for selective dehydrogenation of propane.
