Abstract
The addition of iron to the synthesis of ZSM-5 catalysts (Si/Al = 21) was studied in xylene isomerization reactions. Pt impregnation was conducted by partial vacuum impregnation on both the parent and Fe-ZSM-5. XRD, FE-SEM, ICP, BET, XPS, FT-IR, NH3-TPD, and TG analysis have been used to characterize the catalysts. Fe incorporation strongly decreased the weak acid sites and slightly reduced the strong acid sites. Reducing weak acidity led to lower coke formation and more catalytic stability in Fe-containing ZSM-5 catalysts. The presence of Pt on the Fe-supported ZSM-5 illustrated simultaneous high PX yield and high catalyst stability. (0.1 wt%)Pt/(0.4 wt%)Fe-ZSM-5 as an efficient and stable catalyst for xylene isomerization reactions demonstrated high PX yield (25.4 wt%), high EB conversion (61%) and low xylene loss (1.8%).

1. Introduction
Mixed xylenes are produced through catalytic reforming of naphtha, from which the C8 aromatics includes the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution of 24% para-xylene (PX), 46% meta-xylene (MX), 20% ortho-xylene (OX) and 10% ethylbenzene (EB). Xylenes can also achieve from the pyrolysis gasoline stream in a naphtha steam cracker and through toluene disproportionation process.
PX as a most desirable product is applied in the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is used as a polyester fiber, film and resin for a several applications [1]. In order to meet downstream demand, PX production has seen several year-to-year enhancements in the range of 6–8% per year. Separation of PX from C8 aromatics can be carried out through the crystallization or by the adsorption over zeolite adsorbents, the remaining mixture being processed into an isomerization unit in order to achieve more PX as a valuable product [2], [3], [4], [5], [6].
Xylene isomerization is a commendable reaction of acid catalysis that is generally used as a model reaction for acidity adjustment [7], [8], [9], [10] and bifunctional catalysts have to be applied to selective transformation of EB to valuable products [11], [12], [13]. Zeolites are well known for xylene isomerization reactions due to their large surface area, pore volume, acidity and appropriate hydrothermal and chemical stabilities [14]. Xylene isomerization is currently accompanied by side reactions such as dealkylation and disproportionation reactions which lower the catalyst selectivity and lead to creating C6, C7, C9 and C10 aromatics. Therefore reducing these undesirable reactions will affect the final production rate and economics of the plant [15].
Wichterlova et al. [16] synthesized bimetallic HZSM-5 catalyst (Si/Al = 13.6) ion-exchanged with various Ni salts such as: Ni (CH3COO)2, NiCl2, NiSO4 and NiO. Ion-exchange of ZSM-5 with NiCl2 led to decrease of strong acid skeletal OH groups and uniform dispersion of metallic Ni (0.102 mmol Ni/g zeolite) into the zeolite cationic sites which is active for xylene isomerization reaction. Isomerization and dealkylation activity of NiCl2 exchanged ZSM-5 catalyst was obtained to be considerable to that of the parent ZSM-5 zeolite. Rane and coworkers [17] found that addition of 10% HZSM-5 to ZSM-35 catalyst increases EB conversion more than 20% and showed much more catalytic stability and PX selectivity than the pure ZSM-35. Isomerization of xylene over MgO and CaO modified ZSM-5 zeolite was studied by Li and Jun [18]. The molar ratio of MgO and CaO to framework aluminum was equal to 1:1. Results illustrated the strong dependency of MX and OX conversion on zeolite acidity, whereas isomerization of PX can occur in both strong and weak acid sites. Guisnet et al. [19] reported that xylene isomerization reaction can accomplish through intramolecular and/or intermolecular mechanisms which involve methyl shift in benzenium-ion intermediates as well as disproportionation and transalkylation of trimethylbenzenes and xylene molecules, respectively. Bauer et al. [20] modified ZSM-5 catalyst by coking and silica deposition to inactivate the external surface of the zeolite which led to improving PX yield. Akpolat and Gunduz [21] studied kinetics of gas phase isomerization reaction of MX over different modified catalyst. Pt (0.0018 wt%) and Ga (0.00304 wt%)–Pt (0.0018 wt%)-containing ZSM-5 catalysts suggested most selectivity to PX toward OX, respectively, in comparison with Ni, Sn, Re and Zr-modified ZSM-5 catalysts.
Tsai and coworkers [15] studied the effect of Pt and Si modification of HZSM-5 on its catalytic performance in the conversion of EB and MX. They suppressed the disproportionation and transalkylation side reactions by interaction of external surface of ZSM-5 with silica chemical vapor deposition and 5,6-benzoquinoline treatment. Over the 5,6-benzoquinoline treated Pt (300 ppm)/Si (5 wt%)/ZSM-5 catalyst xylene loss, EB conversion and PX approach to equilibrium was found to be 0.7 wt%, 90.6 wt% and 100.8 wt%, respectively. Tukur and Al-Khattaf [22] studied the PX/OX selectivity and isomerization/disproportionation (I/D) ratios over the SSZ-33, TNU-9, mordenite and ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. PX/OX ratio was obtained 2.0, 1.0, 1.28 and 1.18 for ZSM-5, mordenite, SSz-33 and TNU-9, respectively, at 300 °C. I/D ratio over ZSM-5 (3.81) was found to be much more than other catalysts (0.4–0.6) at the same temperature. Toch et al. [23] modified HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 80) with impregnation of Pt (200 ppmw) and reported 17.5 wt% PX yield, 40% EB conversion and 5.8% xylene loss as a maximum molar fractions of the components at the outlet of the reactor for xylene isomerization. Jian et al. [24] prepared hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite [SiO2/Al2O3 = 200] involves sol–gel synthesis and, subsequently, steam-assisted crystallization (SAC) treatment for OX isomerization. The catalyst provided OX conversion and PX yield of 35.7% and 9.2%, respectively.
Despite of different researches, there is no application of iron in the ZSM-5 catalysts for the xylene isomerization reactions. In the present study, the bifunctional Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst with different amount of iron was hydrothermally synthesized, impregnated with platinum and then, for the first time, was applied to investigate the isomerization reactions of mixed xylene and conversion of ethylbenzene in the breakthrough system. Main emphasis was focused on the adjusting catalyst acidity using different amount of iron and the role of Pt active species to develop appropriate xylene isomerization catalyst including high PX yield, EB conversion and low xylene loss.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The parent HZSM-5 catalyst (Si/Al = 21) was synthesized through hydrothermal technique by mixing sodium hydroxide and distilled water at room temperature at the first. Then tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as a source of silica, and tetrapropyl ammonium bromide (TPABr) were added to the obtained solution. The mixture was heated up to 40 °C and aged for 14 h. The value of pH was checked and adjusted with sulfuric acid. The prepared gel was mixed for 48 h in 60 °C. The molar ratio of the prepared solution was obtained 17SiO2:0.4Al2O3:1TPABr:1.5Na2O:200H2O. The crystallization of synthesis gel was poured in the stainless-steel teflon-lined autoclave at 150–200 °C for 48–96 h [25], [26]. The content of autoclave after filtration and washing with deionized water were dried at 110 °C overnight. After the calcination in 530 °C for 12 h the 1 mol/L NH4NO3 solution was applied to ion exchange the Na-ZSM-5 catalyst at 90 °C for 12 h which was followed by filtration and washing. The prepared NH4-ZSM-5 powders exposed to calcination in 530 °C for 12 h to get H-ZSM-5.
Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts were synthesized by controlled hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) in the presence of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH). TEOS was added to TPAOH and mixed for at least 1 h. An appreciate amount of this solution was subsequently drop wise added to solution of FeCl3, Al(NO3)3·9H2O or a mixture of iron and aluminum sources. The mixture was transferred into a teflon lined autoclave and kept at 160–190 °C for a period of 100–150 h. Catalysts were filtered under vacuum and washing process continued several times and dried over the night at 70 °C [26]. The ultimate amount of iron in the catalysts was fixed to be 0.1, 0.4 and 0.8 wt%.
Pt impregnation on the parent and Fe-ZSM-5 supports was conducted through partial vacuum impregnation method by rotarator evaporator device in the following four steps:
(i) 70 °C and 300 mmHg for 60 min, (ii) 75 °C and 260 mmHg for 30 min, (iii) 80 °C and 220 mmHg for 30 min, (iv) 80 °C and 180 mmHg for 30 min.
We dissolved the determined content of H2(PtCl6)6H2O in distilled water (100 ml) and the catalyst was immersed in prepared solution. The impregnated catalysts were filtered and dried at 105 °C overnight and calcined at 550 °C for 12 h (3 °C/min) under air flow. The modified catalysts included 0.1 wt% Pt promoter.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
All samples were digested using a sodium proxide fusion before analysis by ICP-AES. The textural properties of the catalysts such as total surface area (SBET) and total volume (Vtotal) were determined through nitrogen adsorption on BET isothermal equation (Micrometrics, ASAP 2010) at P/P0 = 0.99 and 77 K.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were performed at room temperature using a D8 Advanced Bruker AXS X-ray diffractometer with CuKα radiation in the range of 5° < 2θ < 50° with the scanning speed of 0.1°(2θ) min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were conducted by using an E.S.C.A. spectrometer from V.G. Scientific Ltd at room temperature under 10−7–10−8 Torr, using Al Kα radiation. FT-IR measurements performed in a Perkin Elmer system 2000 spectroscopy in the scanning range of 4000–2500 cm−1 and resolution of 4 cm−1 for a sample disk of powder with KBr. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were determined by ZEISS SIGMA VP-500 electron microscope equipment at a potential difference of 20 kV. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD, Micrometrics, USA) using thermal conductivity detector (TCD) applied to determine the acidity of synthesized catalysts. 100 mg of each sample was pretreated at 500 °C for 5 h before measurements. All the samples were put in the micro reactor and saturated in ammonia for 1 h. Concentration of desorbed NH3 was calculated in the range 100–700 °C. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was applied to estimate the coke content of catalysts after isomerization reactions. The analysis was conducted in TG instrument (Pyris Diamond) in the presence of air (100 ml/min) and the temperature range of 25–750 °C with the heating ramp rate of 10 °C/min. 0.05 g of the powder was heated to 150 °C under inert gas flow (N2: 100 ml/min) until no weight loss observed. Then the samples heated from room temperature to 700 °C (2 °C/min).
2.3. Catalytic performance
All the xylene isomerization reactions were performed in a plug flow reactor. For each experiment about 2 g of the prepared catalyst in 10–20 mesh was packed in a fixed bed stainless steel reactor with an inner diameter of 1 cm. The feed gas components were controlled by mass flow controller. Xylene mixture was injected to the reactor using dosing system (Harvard Apparatus, 0.00044–77 ml/min). Reaction products were sampled and analyzed online on gas chromatograph using capillary columns CP-Silpona CB. The experiments were conducted at temperature in the range 350 450 °C and the pressure of 6–10 bar with a H2/HC of 2–5 mol/min. The xylene mixture containing 65% MX, 23% OX and 12% EB was applied as a feed mixture. PX yield (wt%) was measured as the amount of PX in the products. EB conversion and xylene loss were calculated by Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
3.1.1. Catalyst structure, morphology and textural properties
Fig. 1 shows the XRD spectra of parent and modified ZSM-5 catalysts. The samples were analyzed in order to investigate the influence of Pt impregnation and Fe incorporation on the catalyst structure. It was observed that ZSM-5 retained the crystal structure during metal loading. The intensity of ZSM-5 signals decreased slightly after introducing iron during synthesis which is due to higher adsorption coefficient of Fe oxide for X-ray radiation [27], [28].

However, there was not any detected Fe oxide phase on the XRD profiles of Fe-containing samples (0.1FZ5, 0.4FZ5 and 0.8FZ5). Findings of other literatures indicated similar results that the Fe oxide related phase in Fe-ZSM5 catalyst was not observed with XRD technique when Fe content of catalyst was less than 6.7 wt% [29], [30].
It is obvious that there are no discernible differences between Pt impregnated catalysts and the parent one that is because of the highly dispersion of Pt particles on the external surface of the zeolites [31]. However, the metallic Pt phase is presented for all the Pt impregnated samples (2θ = 42) which is in accordance with literature [32], [33], [34].
FE-SEM micrographs of the parent and Fe-containing ZSM-5 catalysts illustrate the comparatively uniform morphology and distribution of synthesized catalysts with the average crystal size around 1 µm (Fig. 2). Fe incorporation enhanced the ZSM-5 crystallization process and produced strongly uniform and clean particles. The particle size of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts was slightly smaller than parent ZSM-5 catalyst which was due to different synthesis solution. The smaller particle size can be justified by high nucleation rate and slow crystal growth [35], [36].

It is noticeable that analogous morphology and particle distribution of the parent and Fe-containing catalysts indicated no significant changes in the structure and morphology of powders after metal impregnation which confirmed by XRD analysis.
The elemental composition, textural characteristics and abbreviation of all prepared catalysts are listed in Table 1. The calculated data suggest that the introduction of Fe salt into gel at synthesis enhanced the total surface area and total pore volume which ascribed to the Fe promoter's ability to increase crystallization of catalysts. The higher total pore volume of Fe-containing samples with respect to the parent one was possibly due to dealumination and micropore formation during catalyst synthesis [37], [38].

Impregnation of Pt onto the both parent and Fe-containing ZSM-5 slightly decreased the BET surface area of the catalyst. The possible reason for this behavior may be ascribed to that the Pt species entered the inter-crystalline channel and reduced the micropore volume.
3.1.2. XPS analysis
XPS analysis was conducted to investigate the oxidation states of iron and platinum species in ZSM-5 zeolites. Depending on the valence state of surface Fe species, the Fe 2p3/2 peaks appeared at different binding energies. The binding energies of the Fe 2p3/2 usually reported [39], [40] around ≈711 eV and ≈708 eV were attributed to Fe+3 and Fe+2 ions which were not observed in this study (Fig. 3(a)). From the XPS results it can be seen that Fe-containing ZSM-5 catalysts did not show Fe in the analysis which demonstrated that there was no iron species on the external surface region of zeolite. Fig. 3(b) shows the Pt 4d XPS spectra of prepared samples, indicating different dispersion and valence state of Pt according to the amount of Fe loading. The intensity of P/0.8FZ5 was higher than that of P/0.1FZ5, implying the former was higher in Pt dispersion to the latter. The Pt 4d5/2 binding energies of Pt impregnated samples were located between the binding energy of metallic Pt0 (314.6 eV) and that of Pt2+O (317.3 eV), implying the Pt atoms in all the catalysts were mostly in cationic state.

3.1.3. FT-IR
The FT-IR spectra of the parent and Pt–Fe-containing ZSM-5 catalysts in the range 400–4000 cm−1 are depicted in Fig. 4. The band at 454 cm−1 associated for SiO4 and AlO4 internal tetrahedral [41]. The band around 546 cm−1 (double ring vibration) demonstrated the presence of a five-membered ring of the ZSM-5 zeolite for all samples [41]. The FT-IR bands at 792 cm−1 and that in the 800–1300 cm−1 region were related to symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching bands of TO (T = Si, Fe, Pt). The band at 968 cm−1 attributed to asymmetrical stretching bands of TOT. Vibration related to TO bending (T = Si, Fe, Pt), asymmetrical stretching of TO4 tetrahedral vibrations and symmetrical stretching band were indicated at 462 cm−1, 1008 cm−1 and 677 cm−1, respectively [42]. The bands at 3500–3800 cm−1 were assigned to surface hydroxyl groups (hydrogen bonded SiOH groups) which attributed to the disordered hydrogen-bonded groups [43]. The well-defined band at 1654 cm−1 was attributed to OH bending vibration [41]. FT-IR band at 3610 cm−1 and 3728 cm−1 corresponded to Brönsted acid sites and silanol groups inside the zeolite crystals, respectively [44]. The intensity of IR band at 3610 cm−1 for all the bifunctional Fe-containing ZSM-5 slightly decreased in comparison with those for the parent ZSM-5 which is consistent with previous studies [45]. Incorporation of 0.1% Pt into the parent and Fe-containing ZSM-5 frameworks (P/0.1FZ5, P/0.4FZ5, P/0.8FZ5 and P/Z5) influenced the bands of Si(OH)Al (3610 cm−1) and Si(OH) (3740 cm−1) and led to increase in both bonds which is in good agreement with the results of NH3-TPD.

3.1.4. Acidity
The NH3-TPD measurements display similar curves for the parent and metal-containing catalysts (Fig. 5) two desorption peaks at temperature range of 130–280 °C and 300–500 °C corresponded to weak (Lewis acid sites) and strong acid sites (Brönsted acid sites) of catalysts, respectively. The acidity density of samples were determined from the peak area and summarized in Table 2. The parent HZSM-5 contained 0.55 mmol NH3/g and 0.51 mmol NH3/g amount of strong and weak acid sites, respectively. For bifunctional Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst the reduction in both types of acidic sites was illustrated which the main reason for this is that the substitution of iron poisons both the strong and weak acid sites. Incorporation of Fe into parent HZSM-5 catalyst decreased the ammonia desorption at low temperature which corresponds to destruction of weak acid sites while the strong acid sites remained approximately constant. This finding is in agreement with the previous studies that the Fe was substituted on the HZSM-5 support in the forms of bifunctional and bimetallic catalyst [46], [37]. The NH3-TPD curves of catalysts represent the Pt impregnation on the parent and Fe-containing supports increased both types of acid sites which is in consistent with findings of Zhao et al. [47].

Brönsted acid sites are well-known as being the important sites for the catalytic reactions [48] and most of these sites reside within the catalyst pore structure. Lewis acid sites play a dominant role in the coke formation [49]. Whereas increase in Brönsted sites help to catalyze the undesirable side reactions, density reduction of weak acid sites is vital to prevent the coke formation during the reaction. For Pt-impregnated bimetallic Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst less Lewis and more Brönsted acid sites were observed in comparison with the parent and bifunctional Fe-containing samples.
3.2. Catalyst performance
Isomerization of xylenes can occur by two main mechanisms: intramolecular and intermolecular. In the intramolecular isomerization, the key step is a 1,2-alkyl shift in a benzenium ion concluding from protonation of the alkylaromatic [50], [19]. The intermolecular mechanism involves xylene disproportionation and fast transalkylation between trimethybenzene and xylene molecules. The importance of the intra- and intermolecular mechanisms relies on the alkyl group, the intramolecular mechanism being largely distinguished in xylene isomerization and the intermolecular one in the isomerization of diisopropylbenzenes. Cortes and Corma [51] reported that xylene isomerization take place only through the intramolecular mechanism at high reaction temperature, at which isomerization is three to five times faster than transalkylation. Furthermore, no direct isomerization of o-xylene into p-xylene and of p-xylene into o-xylene can proceed through intramolecular mechanism.
Acidity adjustment is an important factor in xylene isomerization reactions. The strong acid sites are known as important sites for the catalytic reactions. The weak acid sites in order to their role in the coke formation can strongly affect the catalytic activity [52], [53]. Csicsery and Hickson [54] reported that Brönsted sites are responsible for intramolecular isomerization and Lewis sites or Brönsted–Lewis site pairs are responsible for transalkylation reactions, and hence for intermolecular isomerization. Thus increase in Brönsted acid sites and decrease in Lewis acid sites increase xylene isomerization and diminish side reactions, respectively.
Fig. 6 represents the p-xylene yield (a), EB conversion (b) and xylene loss (c) with the time on stream for xylene isomerization reactions over the parent and modified ZSM-5 catalysts. HZ5 sample illustrated somewhat poor reactivity and stability. After reaction for 15 h on stream PX yield diminished markedly from 12.5% to 4.5% and the catalyst deactivated in order to the coke formation [55].

Fig. 6. (a) PX yield, (b) EB conversion, (c) xylene loss on different catalysts.
It can be clearly seen that PX yield increased slightly by introducing Fe into gel synthesis in comparison with that of parent ZSM-5 zeolite. This phenomenon can be interpreted by the fact that incorporation of Fe in zeolite structure acted as nuclei for crystal growth of ZSM-5 catalyst, therefore, enhanced the nucleation rate and subsequently decreased the particle size of the zeolite. Reduction of catalyst particle size led to higher surface area which was favorable to catalytic reactions and is in consistent with SEM photos [35], [36]. For all Pt impregnated supports a remarkable increase in PX yield was observed with respect to those of Pt-free catalysts, but Pt–Fe-containing catalysts (P/0.1FZ, P/0.4FZ and P/0.8FZ) showed much improved stability toward P/Z5 catalyst. This finding clearly illustrated that the presence of Fe acted as important factor in xylene isomerization stability for the platinum Fe-containing ZSM5 catalysts with the reaction time prolonged.
From Fig. 6(a) the initial PX yield onto catalysts P/0.1FZ, P/0.4FZ and P/0.8FZ demonstrated to be 21.8%, 25.4% and 25.9%, respectively. The deactivation rate D (described as D = [Xi − Xf] × 100%/Xi, where Xi is the initial PX yield and Xf is defined as final PX yield) for the mentioned catalysts obtained to be 12.9%, 7.4% and 20.8%, respectively. It is obvious that the P/0.4FZ-5 catalyst showed the highest reactivity and lowest deactivation rate among all the platinum Fe-containing catalysts.
The reasons for the improvement in stability on Fe-containing catalysts were investigated. The NH3-TPD curves of the catalysts (Fig. 5) show that both types of acid strength reduced in all Fe-containing supports, while Lewis acid sites indicated much more reduction than that of Brönsted acid sites. Fe operated as tetrahedrally coordinated metal atom (T atom) in the structure of ZSM-5 support which reduced both the weak (Lewis) and strong (Brönsted) acid sites [37].
Results of coke quantitative analysis (Table 3) suggest that amounts of coke deposition over Fe-containing samples were much lower than that over the Fe-free catalysts (HZ5 and P/Z5). According to the importance of Lewis acid sites in coke formation [[56], [49]], reduction of Lewis acidity by introducing Fe decreased the amount of coke formed in pores of catalyst which led to enhancement in stability of Pt/Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts (P/0.1FZ5, P/0.4FZ5 and P/0.8FZ5). PZ5 catalyst indicated the highest initial PX yield toward other catalysts while the fast reduction was observed during 15 h of TOS. The reason for this is due to high level of strong and weak acid sites which are main sites for xylene isomerization and coke formation, respectively.

P/0.4FZ5 6.93 0.46
P/0.8FZ5 6.51 0.43
P/Z5 14.56 0.97
Note: The amount of coke deposited was calculated after TOS of 15 h by the weight loss of catalysts upon the thermogravimetric analysis. The coke deposition rate was determined in order: total coke quantity (wt%)/15 h.
Among different iron content on ZSM-5 support P/0.4FZ5 indicated lowest xylene loss (Fig. 6(c)). P/Z5 catalyst exhibited the highest PX yield, whereas, xylene loss decreased significantly when the Fe-doped supports were used (Fig. 6(c)). Moreover, the content of iron on ZSM-5 catalyst had an important effect on creating undesirable side reactions. It is generally accepted that adjusted acidity is needed for the high PX yield in the xylene isomerization reactions [57]. It should be considered that two active centers, including acid site and metal particle, exist on the platinum supported catalyst which act cooperatively [58] and considerably affect the catalyst performance. Iron can act as a spacer to decrease the Pt particles and the most uniform distribution of Pt particles can be achieved over the P/0.4FZ5 catalyst. Furthermore, the high acidity and strong to weak acid ratio of P/0.4FZ5 sample strongly controlled xylene isomerization reaction which led to low xylene loss and high PX yield. Increase in Fe loading (0.8 wt%) on the support illustrated lower activity and stability which can be inferred by the fact that higher Fe loading reduces surface area, acidity as well as catalyst activity [59].
According to NH3-TPD curves (Fig. 5) it is obvious that incorporation of Fe in the support strongly decreased the weak acid sites of catalyst. Therefore, the acidic centers of the catalyst depended on strong acid sites. Hence, appropriate accommodating between the Fe particles and acidic sites of bifunctional Fe-Z5M-5 support could be achieved.
The EB conversion of the catalysts is presented in Fig. 6(b) EB conversion strongly depends on catalysts acid sites. Three main EB reaction pathways are known as reforming, dealkylation and disproportionation which produce xylene mixture, benzene and ethylene/ethane and, benzene and diethylbenzenes, respectively [60], [61], [62], [63], [64]. EB reforming mainly occur on bifunctional catalyst while EB disproportionation and dealkylation strongly depends on acid function of catalyst [65]. Hence, balance between metal and acid function of bifunctional catalyst is required for optimum catalytic activity.
As can be seen in Fig. 6(b) P/Z5 indicated higher EB conversion (69 wt%) because of higher acidity while the fast reduction was observed during the reaction time. The reason for this reduction is attributed to undesirable side reactions such as EB disproportionation and dealkylation catalyzed by acid function of catalyst and also higher coke formation due to high level of Lewis acid sites [66]. Fe-containing ZSM-5 catalysts (0.1FZ5, 0.4FZ5 and 0.8FZ5) indicated somewhat less EB conversion with respect to Pt impregnated samples (P/0.1FZ5, P/0.4FZ5, P/0.8FZ5 and P/Z5). The lower EB conversion ascribed to the lower total acid sites of Pt-free catalysts. Increase in Fe content of catalyst decreased EB conversion which was due to reducing total acidity. Fig. 6(b) also shows that EB conversion onto P/Z5 catalyst markedly decreased after 3 h on stream while the Fe-containing catalysts indicated approximately stable behavior with TOS. When total acidity of catalyst was enhanced, the production of light alkane was increased as a result of acid hydrocracking and metal hydrogenation reactions. In this circumstance, P/Z5 catalyst mainly dealkylated EB which resulted in lower xylene yield. Despite significantly less undesirable side reactions, the lower weak acid sites of Fe-containing supports prevented the coke formation and pore blockage in catalysts that can be an acceptable reason to its stability.
High strong to weak acid ratio of P/0.4FZ5 catalyst indicated high level of EB conversion with low amount of xylene loss (Fig. 6(c)) in comparison with the other platinum Fe-containing catalysts (P/0.1FZ5 and P/0.8FZ5). P/0.4FZ5 catalyst in particular maintained a high level of stability (PX yield = 25.4 wt%) even at TOS of 15 h, high EB conversion as well as low xylene loss. However, Fe alone was not active toward PX yield because 0.1FZ, 0.4FZ and 0.8FZ, in both of which Pt was absent, were far inferior in PX yield to any Pt impregnated catalyst. Results demonstrated that xylene loss on Pt/Fe-containing samples was much less than those of alone Pt impregnated and Fe-containing catalysts which illustrated the synergistic effects of Fe incorporation and Pt impregnation. The comparison between the values of the PX yield (wt%) for the isomerization of xylenes on different catalysts used in the literature and the present study are summarized in Table 4. Although direct comparison of the prepared sample with other catalysts is difficult, due to the differences in experimental conditions, it was observed that the PX yield of P/0.4FZ5 was much higher than that of other catalysts. From the test results addressed so far, it could be deduced that Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolite is an agreeable support for stabilizing Pt active metals and to obtain its optimum catalytic activity for the xylene isomerization.

4. Conclusions
Fe and Pt were introduced to the ZSM-5 framework by hydrothermal and partial vacuum impregnation methods, respectively. The catalysts were characterized for the xylene isomerization reaction. The uniform distribution of Pt was achieved due to new wet incipient impregnation technique. It was observed that incorporation of Fe into ZSM-5 zeolite structure strongly decreases the weak acidity which leads to lower coke formation rate. Fe-containing catalysts indicate a little lower EB conversion but much more catalytic stability than Fe-free samples with time on stream.
Characterization data demonstrated incorporation of Fe in the zeolite framework reduces total acidity as well as the reduction of Lewis acid degree was much greater than that of Brönsted acid. Therefore, it has been proposed that Fe interacted mainly with Lewis acid sites. The diminishment of weak Lewis acid sites explained the reduction of coke formation and the increase of catalyst stability in our experiment. Results obtained from this study enhance economy and efficiency of xylene isomerization process for PX production.
