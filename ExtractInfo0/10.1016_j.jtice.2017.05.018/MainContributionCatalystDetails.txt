 Unfortunately the provided documents do not seem to contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation research. The documents all discuss xylene isomerization using Pt/Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts, with no mention of propane, propylene, PDH, or ODH. Since there is no pertinent information provided, I cannot provide a synthesized summary.
