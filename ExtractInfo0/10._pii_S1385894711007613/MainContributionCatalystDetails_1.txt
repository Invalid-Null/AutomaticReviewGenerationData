 Unfortunately the provided document does not seem to be related to propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The document discusses modeling of a catalytic membrane reactor for dehydrogenation of propane, but does not focus on advancing any specific catalyst for this reaction. Since no catalyst details are provided, I am unable to extract the requested information.
