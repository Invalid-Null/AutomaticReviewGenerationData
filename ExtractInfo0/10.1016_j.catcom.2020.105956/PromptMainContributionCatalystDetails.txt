Catalytic non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation over promoted Cr-Zr-Ox: Effect of promoter on propene selectivity and stability




1. Introduction
The demand for propene is continuously increasing, while the traditional oil-based steam and fluid catalytic cracking cannot fulfil the gap between the supply and the demand of this particular olefin [1,2]. Therefore, alternative technologies have been developed and commercialized. The non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene (PDH) is one of the most promising methods owing to the vast reserves of propane-containing shale gas [3,4].
A significant drawback of the PDH technology is coke formation [2,5,6]. To hinder this undesired reaction product, various approaches were examined upon catalyst preparation. Promotion with oxides of alkali and/or alkaline-earth metals to neutralize acidic sites is the most frequently used strategy [7,8]. In addition, controlling the structure of PDH active sites is also adopted widely. For example, two-dimensional-VOx species are more resistant against coke formation than three-dimensional VOx nanoparticles, thus resulting in higher propene selectivity [9]. Isolated-VOx species show the lowest ability towards coke formation [2,10]. For supported metal-based catalysts, alloying or forming intermetallic compounds are effective routes to suppress coke formation [[11], [12], [13]].
Recently, bulk Cr-Zr-Ox catalysts were demonstrated to be highly active for propane dehydrogenation owing to a synergy effect between CrOx and ZrO2 [14,15]. However, they suffer from rapid deactivation and low propene selectivity caused by coke formation. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports focused on improving stability and selectivity of these novel materials.
Thus, the objective of this study was to hinder the tendency of Cr-Zr-Ox for coking and to increase propene selectivity without significant loss of the high activity. To this end, we elucidated the potential use of promoters based on Cs, Ca or P. Our intention to use the latter promoter was to check if the known negative effect of basic promoters on the activity of CrOx-based catalysts can be compensated when co-adding basic and acidic promoters. The catalysts with a single promoter or their binary combinations were prepared. A reference K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalytic material was also studied to directly benchmark the present catalysts. Selectivity-conversion dependences were analyzed in order to establish reaction pathways leading to the target and side products, and to check if and how the presence of a modifier influences their formation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Bulk binary Cr-Zr-Ox(CZ) with a Cr/Zr molar ratio of 1/9 was prepared by the co-precipitation method using aqueous solutions of Cr(NO3)·9H2O (99%, Sigma Aldrich), ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O (99%, Sigma Aldrich) and ammonia (25 wt%, Carl Roth GmbH Co. KG). The obtained gel was dried at 100 °C for 6 h and then calcined at 550 °C (heating rate of 3°C·min-1) for 4 h. Promoted CZ materials were prepared by the impregnation of the binary oxide with aqueous solutions of CsNO3 (99.8%, Alfa Aesar), Ca(NO3)2·4H2O (99%, Fluka) and/or NH4H2PO4 (99%, Merck). The amount of Cs, Ca and P was 1.5, 0.6 and 1.25 wt%, respectively. After impregnation, the catalyst precursors were dried at 100 °C for 6 h and then calcined at 500 °C for 4 h (heating ramp of 3 °C·min-1). The catalysts promoted with Ca, P, Cs as well as with Ca and P or Cs and P were denoted as Ca/CZ, P/CZ, Cs/CZ, Ca-P/CZ and Cs-P/CZ, respectively. The apparent surface density of Cs, Ca and P in these catalysts is given in Table S1, and this was calculated according to SBET values and promoter weight concentration. An analogue of commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared according to a patent of SüdChemie [16].
2.2. Catalysts characterization
All as-prepared catalysts were characterized by BET measurements, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD), CO2 (CO2-TPD) as well as temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR). Before the desorption tests, the catalysts were pre-reduced in a flow of 50 vol% H2/Ar gas mixture to mimic their state under reaction conditions; the same gas treatment was also applied before PDH catalytic tests. The heating ramp used was 10 °C·min-1. Experimental details and used setups have been published earlier [14,15]. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) measurements were applied for characterizing spent catalysts for coke formation after 1-h PDH run (see section 2.3).
2.3. Catalytic performance tests
Catalytic performance tests were conducted in a setup equipped with 15 continuously operating fixed-bed reactors at 550 °C using a the feed 40 vol% C3H8/N2. The kinetic rate of propene formation was determined after 4 min on reaction stream. The degree of propane conversion was below 10% to ensure differential reactor operation. Reaction pathways of products (including coke) formation were derived from selectivity-conversion relationships obtained from catalytic tests carried out upon varying the amount of catalyst (80–95 mg) and the feed gas flow rate (6–40 mL·min-1). The catalysts were pre-reduced in a flow of 50 vol% H2/N2 at 550 °C for 1 h. The feed components and the reaction products were quantified by an on-line gas-chromatograph (Agilent 6890) equipped with flame-ionization and thermal-conductivity detectors.
Propene formation rate, propane conversion, product selectivity and space-time-yield of propene were calculated according to Eqs. (1), (2), (3), (4), where ṅC3H6 and mcat are the molar flow rate of C3H6 (mmol·min-1) and catalyst amount (g), respectively. The ṅC3H8 with superscripts “in” or “out” is the molar flow rate of propane at the reactor inlet or outlet, β is the number of carbon atoms in product i or propane and MC3H6 is the molecular weight of C3H6.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalysts composition and textural properties
The specific surface area (SBET) of the fresh catalysts is given in Table 1. The CZ catalyst possessed the highest value of 134 m2⋅g-1, which decreased to about 120–130 m2⋅g-1 after introducing the various modifiers. Such decrease may be caused by sintering processes upon catalyst calcination following the impregnation procedure, or by blockage of pores by the added modifiers.

The crystallite size of t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2 was determined by the Scherrer equation.
XRD patterns of as-prepared catalysts are shown in Fig. S1. No reflections ascribed to crystalline Cr2O3 could be identified, likely due to high dispersion and/or low loading of CrOx species. A part of chromium could also be dissolved within the lattice of ZrO2 forming a solid solution (not determined by XRD). All the catalysts consist of a mixture of tetragonal (t-ZrO2) and monoclinic (m-ZrO2) ZrO2 phases (PDF 01-73-1441 and 03-65-1024). The size of crystallites of each individual phase is given in Table 1. This parameter for m-ZrO2 decreased slightly after addition of modifiers, while the size of t-ZrO2 crystallites largely increased in the case of the P-, Cs- or Cs-P-promoted materials, and to a less extent for the Ca- or Ca-P-promoted catalysts.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy images are shown in Fig. S2. The particles of CZ, P/CZ, Cs/CZ and Cs-P/CZ are composed of irregular small crystals. The size of crystallites determined from these images is similar to that determined by powder XRD.
3.2. Acid-base and redox properties of promoted Cr-Zr-Ox
NH3-TPD was applied to analyze catalyst acidic properties. The obtained desorption profiles are shown in Fig. S3a. From a mathematical viewpoint, these profiles can be described by a combination of Gaussian functions (Fig. S4). On this basis, at least three kinds of acidic sites of different strength could be identified. Such sites are characterized by the maximum of NH3 desorption rate at 239–273 °C (weak sites), 287–349 °C (medium sites) and 377–462 °C (strong sites) (Table S2). The overall density of acidic sites was calculated under the assumption that one molecule of NH3 is adsorbed on one site and this is given in Table 1. The density for each specific acidic site is listed in Table S2. The addition of a basic promoter (Cs or Ca) decreased the number of acidic sites and weakened their strength. The overall density also decreased but to a less extent after P addition. The effect of this particular promoter on surface acidic properties seems to be complex. Its presence affected negatively the density of weak acidic sites, while the density of strong acidic sites increased (Table S2). The strength of acidic sites is also increased. This could be due to the fact that P-containing species cover the acidic sites of CZ and create new ones with a higher strength [17].
The density of basic sites was determined from CO2-TPD profiles (Fig. S3b) under the assumption that one CO2 molecule is adsorbed on one site and this is given in Table 1. The addition of Cs- or Ca-containing promoters resulted in the creation of new basic sites strongly adsorbing CO2, while the presence of P inhibited CO2 adsorption. However, the density of basic sites on the surface of Cs-P/CZ or Ca-P/CZ does not practically differ from that for CZ. This might be explained when assuming that Cs or Ca species tend to interact with P species.
It has been reported that redox properties of ZrO2 strongly influence PDH performance of ZrO2-based catalysts [18]. Thus, H2-TPR experiments were conducted to determine the effect of the type of promoter on the reducibility of the promoted CZ catalysts. The profiles of H2 consumption obtained in these tests are given in Fig. S5. For all the catalysts, a broad H2 consumption peak could be identified with a maximum at ~355–370 °C. This peak can be ascribed to the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+. In addition, a small peak observed with a maximum between 445 and 525 °C (Fig. S5) can be attributed to the removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2. The latter process is improved by the presence of CrOx species [19]. The amount of consumed H2 and the Tmax-H2 values (temperature of maximum H2 consumption rate) are given in Table 1. The presence of Cs promoter slightly increased consumption of H2, while P and Ca promoters led to a decrease in H2 consumption. No obvious effect on Tmax-H2 could be established.
3.3. Catalytic performance
The highest rate of propene formation of ~3.2 mmol⋅g-1⋅min-1was achieved over the CZ catalyst(Fig. 1a). It decreases after this catalyst was promoted with Ca, Cs or P. The strongest decrease was achieved after promotion with Cs. The addition of P to CZ has a less pronounced effect. The rate of reaction determined for P/CZ is 2.5 mmol⋅g-1⋅min-1. Promotion of CZ with Ca led to a minor negative effect on the rate, i.e. 3.1 vs. 3.2 mmol⋅g-1⋅min-1. The different negative effects of the promoters may be related to their different ability to interact with or to cover catalytically active sites. When Cs/CZ and Ca/CZ are additionally promoted by P, the activity of the former does not change, while the activity of the latter decreases slightly.

Fig. 1. (a) The rate of propene formation (r(C3H6)) and (b) the amount of propene produced after 1 h of PDH over 1 kg of catalyst. r(C3H6) test conditions: catalyst amount = 25 mg, WHSV(C3H8) = 113.1 h-1, T = 550 °C; Time-on-stream stability test conditions: catalyst amount = 120 mg, WHSV(C3H8) = 5.89 h-1, T = 550 °C. All catalysts were reduced in a flow of 50 vol% H2/N2 at 550 °C for 1 h before reaction.
The stability of the catalysts with time-on-stream was compared with that of an analogue of commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst tested under the same reaction conditions. Temporal changes of propane conversion and propene selectivity are shown in Fig. S6. The initial conversion over all CZ catalysts was higher than over K-CrOx/Al2O3, i.e. ~35 vs. 20%. It decreased with increasing time on propane stream. The highest deactivation rate was determined for the CZ catalyst. Propane conversion over this catalyst decreased from ~35 to 8.5% within 1 h on propane stream. The presence of Cs and/or P significantly improved the catalyst's stability. The conversion over the Cs-P/CZ catalyst decreased from 30.6 to 16.9%. The latter value was comparable with that determined for the K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst after 1 h on propane stream. The positive effect of Ca and/or P on catalyst's stability was not so pronounced as in the case of the Cs-P/CZ catalyst (Fig. S6).
Propene selectivity was also improved through the use of promoter(s). For example, the initial selectivity over Cs-P/CZ catalyst was 93.7 vs. 85.9% over the CZ material. To benchmark the catalysts with respect to propene production, the amount of this olefin (m(C3H6)) produced after 1 h on propane stream (Fig. 1b) was calculated (by integrating space-time-yield of propene (Fig. S7) over time) and it was ~0.89 kgC3H6⋅kgCat-1 for CZ. For all modified catalysts, higher m(C3H6) values were obtained. The highest value of 1.11 kgC3H6⋅kgCat-1 was established for the Cs-P/CZ catalyst, and even exceeded the value of 1.02 kgC3H6⋅kgCat-1 determined for K-CrOx/Al2O3.
3.4. Coke analysis
TPO tests were performed over spent catalysts to determine (i) the amount of coke accumulated after 1 h PDH cycle, and (ii) the temperature range where coke can be oxidatively removed. The TPO profiles in the form of CO2/Ar ratio are shown in Fig. 2. For all the catalysts, the Tmax-CO2 value (temperature of maximum CO2 formation rate) is between 310 and 330 °C.

Fig. 2. CO2 profiles determined upon TPO of spent catalysts. The numbers stand for the ratio (m(coke)/m(C3H8)) of the total amount of carbon to that of propane converted after 1 h of PDH at 550 °C.
To compare an average selectivity to coke for the different catalysts, the ratio (m(coke)/m(C3H8)) of coke amount (determined from the amount of CO2 formed in the TPO tests) to the total amount of converted propane after 1 h PDH cycle was calculated, and this is shown in Fig. 2. This ratio for the catalysts modified with Cs and/or P is about half of the ratio determined for the non-modified CZ catalyst.
3.5. Reaction pathways and effect of modifiers
To obtain some insights into the primary and secondary reaction pathways in the course of PDH reaction, and into the effect of the kind of promoter on these pathways, selectivity-conversion relationships were determined. Fig. 3 and Fig. S8 show the obtained relationships for propene (Fig. 3) and cracking products (CH4, C2H6, and C2H4) and coke (Fig. S8). The selectivity to propene decreases with an increase in propane conversion as a result of consecutive propene chemical transformation(s) to other products. In comparison with the CZ catalyst, this selectivity over the modified catalysts is higher at the same degree of propane conversion, and the negative influence of the conversion on the selectivity is less pronounced.

Fig. 3. Dependence of selectivity to propene (S(C3H6)) on propane conversion (X(C3H8)) obtained over CZ (●), P/CZ (●), Cs/CZ (●) and Cs-P/CZ (▲) catalysts.
For all the modified catalysts, extrapolation of propene selectivity to zero degree of propane conversion gives 100%, i.e. propene is the only product formed directly from propane. On the contrary, non-100% propene selectivity at zero propane conversion can be achieved over the CZ catalyst. This means that in addition to propene, at least one another product should be formed directly from propane. The selectivity to cracking products over all catalysts increased from nearly zero with increasing propane conversion (Fig. S8a). Thus, they should originate through sequential reaction(s) involving propene. The selectivity to coke also increased (Fig. S8b). However, whereas this selectivity over all the modified catalysts is about zero at nearly zero propane conversion, non-zero value is expected for the CZ catalyst.
Based on the above analysis, we suggest two possible reaction networks of product formation over CZ and its modified counterparts (Scheme 1). For the former catalyst, there are two primary products: propene and coke. The olefin can be transformed to cracking products and coke. For the modified catalysts, propene is the only primary product, while cracking products and coke are formed through sequential reaction(s) involving the desired olefin.

Scheme 1. Proposed reaction networks over (a) non-modified CZ and (b) CZ modified with Cs and/or P.
The following discussion is focused on the effect of promoters on coke formation. It is well-known that the addition of alkali or/and alkaline-earth metal oxide to typical PDH catalysts could decrease coke selectivity, e.g. K is a suitable promoter for CrOx/Al2O3 or Na can be used for Pt-Sn/Al2O3 [20,21]. Those authors proposed that the promoters neutralize acidic sites on the surface of Al2O3, where coke formation takes place. For the present catalysts, promoting CZ with Cs led to a decrease in the concentration of acidic sites, while an opposite effect was obtained upon promotion with P. Despite the different effects of these promoters on acidic properties, they improved catalyst stability with time-on-stream and selectivity to propene.
Analyzing the r(C3H6) values in Fig. 1a, we can assume that the lower activity of the modified CZ-based catalysts in comparison with CZ is due to the fact that some active sites are covered by the modifier(s). Thus, their surface density in the CZ catalyst should be higher than in the modified materials. Under these considerations, the coverage of adsorbed propene species directly formed from propane should also be higher for the CZ catalyst. Such species can desorb to yield gas-phase propene or interact with each other towards coke formation. Therefore, owing to the higher coverage of adsorbed propene species over the CZ catalyst, the latter process becomes evident for this catalyst. As in this process no re-adsorption of propene is required, non-zero propene selectivity will be obtained at zero degree of propane conversion, thus suggesting that coke is a primary product of propane conversion (Scheme 1a). As the modifiers block the active sites for propane activation, the surface coverage of adsorbed propene species will be lower, i.e. they become isolated. Consequently, the probability for recombining two neighboring adsorbed propene species decreases, and they thus tend to appear as gas phase propene.
4. Conclusions
In comparison with previous studies using basic promoters for inhibiting coke formation, the present study demonstrated that the usage of an acidic P-based modifier helped to improve the performance of binary Cr-Zr-Ox solid catalysts in the PDH reaction. Thus, both catalyst's propene selectivity and stability with time-on-stream were significantly enhanced. A further improvement could be achieved when combing this promoter with a basic promoter, e.g. Cs or Ca. The positive effect of the promoters was related to blocking Cr-Zr-Ox sites responsible for coke formation. New acidic sites generated through catalyst modification with P did not significantly contribute to this undesired process.
