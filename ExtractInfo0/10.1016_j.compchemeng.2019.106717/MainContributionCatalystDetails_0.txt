The given document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for converting propane to propylene. It focuses on separating propane and propylene using pressure swing adsorption, rather than catalyzing the dehydrogenation reaction. Therefore, there is no relevant information to extract about a catalyst that enhances selectivity, conversion, or stability of propane dehydrogenation.
