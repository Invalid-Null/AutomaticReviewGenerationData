 Based on the detailed analysis of the document, this does not appear to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation catalyst research. The document focuses on separation of propane/propylene mixtures using pressure swing adsorption, and does not discuss any specific catalysts. As such, I am unable to extract the requested information about a propane dehydrogenation catalyst.
