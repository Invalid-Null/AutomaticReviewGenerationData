 Based on the multiple document extracts provided, it appears they all refer to the same study on propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile over V-Sb-P-W/Al2O3 catalysts. Since ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile is different from propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) to propylene, these documents are not directly relevant to PDH/ODH research.

The documents focus on a different reaction than PDH/ODH to propylene. As such, I have indicated they are not relevant and did not include the <IfRelated> section in the output. Please let me know if I have misunderstood the objective or if you would like me to modify the response.
