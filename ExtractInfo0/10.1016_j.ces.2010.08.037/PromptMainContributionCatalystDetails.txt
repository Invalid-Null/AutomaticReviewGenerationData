Demonstration of a packed bed membrane reactor for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
Abstract
An experimental demonstration of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) in a lab-scale packed bed membrane reactor has been performed. Experiments were carried out with both premixed and distributed oxygen feed over a Ga2O3/MoO3 catalyst and compared, and the influence of the gas composition, flow rate and the extent of dilution was investigated. The experimental results were found to compare very well with detailed reactor simulations. The results revealed that, in comparison with conventional reactor concepts for the ODHP (fixed bed with premixed reactants feed), a significantly higher propylene yield can be achieved at higher propane conversions in a packed bed membrane reactor.
1. Introduction
Light olefins are important chemicals in synthesis processes because of their high chemical activity in the reactions. The total amount of ethylene and propylene consumed in 2005 by the global chemical industry have been estimated to be about 107 and 67.1 Mton, respectively (Eramo, 2005). Propylene, one of the most valuable petrochemicals, is nowadays produced either by steam cracking of liquid feedstocks such as naphtha as well as LPGs, where propylene comes out as a by-product (Aitani, 2005), or is recovered from off-gases produced in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units in refineries (Walther, 2003). The remainder of propylene (currently only 3%, but growing) is produced via on-purpose technologies such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH) and metathesis.
Typical processes for the commercial production or having a great potential for light olefins production are those using petroleum distillates as a feedstock. The processes can be classified into four groups: (1) thermal cracking, (2) catalytic pyrolysis, (3) catalytic cracking and (4) catalytic dehydrogenation. These processes suffer from thermodynamic limitations, coke formation and require costly heat exchange at high operating temperatures because of the endothermicity of the reaction.
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, often referred to as ODHP, has been proposed as a promising process and a good alternative to traditional propylene production processes (Leveles et al., 2002, Schuster et al., 2001, Trionfetti et al., 2006, Davies and Taylor, 2004b, Kürten et al., 2004). However, the development of ODHP is still in its infancy. This is mainly related to low propylene yields, which are still insufficient for an economically viable industrial process. At the same time, the promising features of a reactor system with catalytically active or inert membranes are also explored for heterogeneously catalyzed gas phase reactions in order to improve on the already existing conventional production processes, such as the production of formaldehyde and methanol from methane (Lu et al., 1996, Liu et al., 1996), methane oxidative coupling (Lafarga et al., 1994), or the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (López et al., 2008, Hamel et al., 2008, Tonkovich et al., 1996). The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was also studied in membrane reactors: in the work of Pantazidis et al. (1995), the porous catalytic membrane (V–Mg–O) was used, while the research of Alfonso et al. (1999) reports on
‐
membrane for the same reaction. The benefits of a packed bed reactor with inert membrane have also been theoretically examined for the ODHP process (Kürten et al., 2004, Kotanjac et al., 2010).
In this paper, the potential of a packed bed membrane reactor has been experimentally demonstrated for the application in the process of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. First, the experimental set-up is described and membrane permeation experiments are described. Subsequently, the reactor model and the validity of its assumptions is shortly outlined. Then the experimental results are described focusing on the influence of the gas composition, flow rate and the extent of feed dilution.
2. Experimental
For the experimental demonstration of the performance of a packed bed membrane reactor for the ODHP process, an experimental setup was constructed, equipped with a single membrane tube of desired characteristics in terms of mechanical and physical properties.
2.1. Setup and operation
The experimental setup used for the experiments described in this paper is schematically shown in Fig. 1. Propane enters the tube side of the reactor (R1) through a pipeline equipped with mass flow controller MFC2. If distributive feed of oxygen is used, the three way valve V2 is set in the position such that the stream is directed towards the shell side of the reactor and a porous membrane is installed. For operation with premixed reactants, this valve directs the stream to the junction point in front of valve V3 and a dense ceramic tube was installed. The three way valve V3 is used to allow bypassing of the reactor to analyze the feed composition on a gas chromatograph GC. Nitrogen can either be added to the shell or tube side, by setting valve V1 into the desired position. After cooling to room temperature and removing condensed water from the stream (C1), the reaction products were analyzed using a Varian MicroGC 4900. A molsieve 5 Å column was used for the detection of oxygen, nitrogen, methane and carbon monoxide, while a Al2O3/KCl column measured the ethane, ethylene, propane and propylene concentrations. Thermal conductivity detectors were attached to both columns and absolute concentrations were obtained from the chromatogram peaks. The relative accuracy of the gas concentrations measured with the chromatograph was within 2% and it was regularly checked by analyzing a gas mixture of known composition.

A thermocouple was inserted in the catalyst bed, inside the membrane tube. Pressure indicators were placed at the inlets of both tube and shell side of the reactor and the difference between the pressures was in all the cases positive
. This ensures that the cross-permeation (diffusion of the chemical species from the tube side towards the shell side, against the total pressure gradient and the convective flow) is minimized and that no bypassing of the tube side stream can occur.
A bed consisting of 10 g of Ga2O3/MoO3 catalyst (molar ratio Ga2O3:MoO3=1:1) was used for all experiments. A detailed description of the preparation method of catalyst is given elsewhere (Davies and Taylor, 2004b, Davies and Taylor, 2004a).
All experiments were carried out at 733 K and near atmospheric pressure.
It is important to mention that mixtures of hydrocarbons and oxygen are flammable and may explode within certain composition limits (Lewis and von Elbe, 1987). Mixtures of propane and air are flammable between propane/oxygen ratios of 0.10 and 0.49 (see Fig. 2) and as the amount of nitrogen diluent decreases, the flammability limits widen. Mixtures of propane and (pure) oxygen are flammable between propane/oxygen ratios of 0.02 and 0.72. Some experimental data on auto-ignition of propane/air mixtures at atmospheric pressure can be found in the work of Mullins (1955), while high pressure data can be found in the research of Kong et al. (1995), Norman et al. (2006) and Cadman et al. (2000).

Since the operation of the reactor within the flammability limits may lead to a severe hazard, special care has been taken. The experiments may either be performed in the propane-rich regime, where propane/oxygen ratios are greater than the upper flammability limit, or in the oxygen-rich regime, where propane/oxygen ratios are lower than the lower flammability limit.
2.2. Membrane properties
The membrane used in this research is a porous alumina (Al2O3 + 5–10% SiO2, purchased from Gimex technische keramiek B.V., Geldermalsen, The Netherlands) with an internal diameter of 8 mm. The results of an XRD measurement on the material composition are shown in Fig. 3. Squares represent the characteristic peaks for Al2O3, obtained from the database of The International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD). Silicium dioxide peaks are almost invisible here. Together with the XRD pattern, the SEM photo of a membrane cross section has been shown.

One of the most important characterization routines in membrane related operations using porous membranes is certainly the characterization of the membrane permeability as a function of the transmembrane pressure drop. In this particular case, when no membrane layer is applied on a porous support (inside or outside), but the entire wall acts as a membrane/distributor, the permeability can be related to either inner, or outer diameter. Here, all the fluxes are calculated based on the outer tube diameter.
The porous alumina tube used in the membrane reactor was 42 cm in length, equal to the length of the reactor. However, only the part of this tube which was located in the oven (25 cm, middle part of the tube), was permeable. The remaining of the tube was made non-permeable by sealing. The flow through this membrane was examined as a function of the transmembrane pressure difference at different temperatures ranging from 298 to 773 K.
Results from these experiments, presented in Fig. 4, show that the highest flux is obtained at low temperatures and large transmembrane pressure differences. As the temperature was increased, the flux of oxygen (expressed in
) for the same
decreased. Comparing the fluxes at 773 and 298 K at
bar, it can be seen that the permeability decrease is about 65%.

As shown in Fig. 3, the membrane used in this research has large pores, so the mean free path of the gas molecules is much smaller than the membrane pore size. In that case, the prevailing transport mechanism of ideal gas is viscous flow and for transport in one dimension can be described by Darcy's law
(1)
where N is flux, B0 a structure parameter and
the viscosity. This equation explains also why the fluxes decrease with temperature.
2.3. Cross-permeation
The extent of cross-permeation of propane from the tube side of the membrane reactor to the shell side due to the concentration difference has also been examined. The gas stream to the tube side consisted of pure nitrogen, and to the shell side pure oxygen was fed. The oxygen flow rate was set to 200 ml/min (all volumetric flow rates mentioned are in normal milliliters per minute), while the transmembrane pressure difference was regulated by the valve at the outlet of the shell side. It is also important to mention that in these experiments the shell side was open ended.
From Fig. 5 it can be clearly seen that the cross-permeation is very significant at lower nitrogen flow rates and at higher operating temperatures. An increase of the flow rate to the tube side increases the amount of nitrogen found in the shell side, however, if this is quantified as percentage of nitrogen (initially) present in the tube side, the extent of cross-permeation actually reduces.

It is also noticeable that the operating temperature significantly affects the extent of cross-permeation: cross-permeation at 733 K is significantly higher in comparison to cross-permeation at 298 K. However, increasing transmembrane pressure difference to 0.2 bar leads to significant decrease of cross-permeation.
3. Modeling
A multi-compartment, multi-component reactor model was developed for a tube-in-tube configuration, where the number of compartments could be varied. If the number of compartments is equal to one (ncpt=1), then the model simulates a single tube reactor with premixed reactants flow, while for the case of ncpt=2, a model of a membrane reactor with distributed feed of reactant(s) is obtained.
For both compartments, i.e. membrane shell and tube side, plug-flow behavior can be assumed. The importance of axial mass dispersion, already included in this general model, was checked using the criterion suggested by Mears (1971),
(2)
and it has been found that the axial mass dispersion in the laboratory reactor used in this research indeed does not play an important role. The existence of temperature gradients inside catalyst particles was tested applying the criterion developed initially by Anderson (1963)
(3)
which showed that the catalyst particles are practically isothermal. Possible radial mass dispersion effects were examined using the modified Thiele modulus concept proposed by Kürten et al. (2004) and van Sint Annaland et al. (2007) and confirmed that for the catalyst particle size used, the bed effectiveness factor,
, is close to one
. Concluding, a 1-D model approach is satisfactory to describe the packed bed membrane reactor.
Furthermore, mass transfer limitations from the gas bulk to the catalyst surface and intraparticle diffusion resistances can be neglected, so that the reaction rates can be described as a direct function of the gas-phase concentrations, or partial pressures. The reaction rates, expressed as
, have been measured separately in a micro-fixed bed reactor (Kotanjac et al., 2010). The coefficients k, m and n are summarized in Table 1. The structure of the packing is characterized by a single parameter, the bed porosity. Thus, the packed bed membrane reactor can be well described with a 1-D pseudo-homogeneous reactor model. Non-isothermal calculations have shown that axial temperature gradients can be ignored for the cases studied in this work. Due to the relatively large transmembrane pressure drop relative to the pressure drop over the bed, the membrane flux was virtually constant along the reactor length.

4. Results and discussion
4.1. Premixed feed
First, experiments with premixed reactants were performed in the experimental setup using a dense alumina tube. To be able to compare the results from these experiments and the experiments in the membrane reactor discussed later, an identical amount of catalyst was used. In Fig. 6 the results of two experimental series for two different inlet flow rates are shown. In these experiments the total volumetric flow rate (thus also the contact time) as well as the propane inlet concentration were kept constant, while the oxygen inlet concentration was varied. In order to maintain the same flow rate for different oxygen concentrations, the inlet stream was diluted with the appropriate amount of nitrogen.

As expected, the propylene selectivity decreases strongly with increasing propane conversion. For low propane conversions, the experimentally obtained selectivities are in a very good agreement with the conversion-selectivity curve obtained from numerical simulations, indicated with the dashed lines. Moving towards higher conversions, the calculated selectivity to propylene is slightly higher in comparison to the experimentally obtained values. This could be attributed to possible formation of acrolein at lower propane over oxygen ratios (see Davies and Taylor, 2004b, Davies and Taylor, 2004a), since this reaction has not been included in the reaction model.
Decreasing the inlet flow rate, the selectivity to propylene increases, when compared at the same propane conversion. The explanation for this result can be found by examining the oxygen concentration levels for these two cases. The amount of oxygen needed for achieving a certain propane conversion differs for different contact times; higher flow rates mean shorter contact times and therefore more oxygen is needed to reach a certain conversion, in which case the propane/oxygen ratio is lower, which favors side reactions and explains the observed lower selectivity to propylene.
4.2. Distributed oxygen feed
Similar to the cases with premixed reactants feed, experiments with distributed feed of oxygen were performed. Dilution of the feed stream was used to keep the overall contact time unchanged, when the concentration of one of the reactants was varied. In case of distributed oxygen feed, there are two possibilities, either to dilute the shell side stream (oxygen), or to dilute the propane feed in the tube side of the reactor.
4.2.1. Tube side dilution
Experimental examination of the ODHP was performed in the reactor setup described previously with the porous alumina membrane tube installed. The membrane tube was inserted in the steel tube with a diameter of 25 mm, so that oxygen was fed via the annular space (closed end!), while propane and nitrogen were fed through the tube side of the membrane reactor.
Having in mind that the oxygen concentration was targeted to be low, the pressure difference between the shell and tube side was also kept low. The addition of nitrogen in the tube side contributed to a slight increase of the pressure difference over the catalyst bed, thereby decreasing the pressure difference between the shell and tube side of the reactor.
In these experiments, the contact time was kept constant, while the oxygen concentration was altered, comparable to the experiments where the shell side stream was diluted. The effects of the inlet composition variation are shown in Fig. 7.

Fig. 7. Selectivity to propylene as a function of the propane conversion in a packed bed membrane reactor: cross-permeation imposes serious problems in the system where the tube side stream was diluted. Reaction composition contained 30% of propane, while the contact time was kept constant by adjustment of inert (symbols—experiments; line—model).
Unlike the experiments with dilution from the shell side, discussed later, these experimental results showed much larger deviations from the numerically predicted values for the conversion and selectivity. Even at low conversions, the difference was reasonably large. For a given propane conversion, the selectivity to propylene was over predicted. At higher conversions, this difference becomes somewhat lower, however, still a large amount of propane is involved in side reactions. This is most likely caused by the relatively high extent of propane cross-permeation to the shell side of the membrane reactor. Propane which cross-permeates to the shell side of the reactor can also react with oxygen present there and form COx. Although the rate of the gas phase reaction of propane with oxygen at moderate temperatures, such as used in this work (733 K) is low, one should keep in mind the following:
1.
The oven heats the steel shell side of the reactor, so the membrane tube is heated indirectly by convective heat transport. As a consequence, the temperature in the shell side is somewhat higher than 733 K.
2.
The annular space is confined by the alumina membrane and by the steel reactor wall. Steel, under these conditions, may act as a catalyst for propane oxidation, while alumina remains inert, especially having in mind that its temperature is lower and close to 733 K.
Thus, the low transmembrane pressure difference and the low amount of oxygen fed can explain why the experimental results obtained were in large discrepancy with the model. Of course, the model could be extended to include cross-permeation effects. However, industrial reactors should be operated such that cross-permeation effects are negligible. In this work, this was achieved via shell side dilution.
4.2.2. Shell side dilution
In previous experiments, the reactants stream was diluted from the tube side. The other possibility, dilution from the shell side, was examined as well. Experiments were performed where the oxygen concentration was varied (at constant contact time) as well as where the total flow rate was varied, while the feed composition was kept constant. The influence of the oxygen concentration on the performance of the packed bed membrane reactor is shown in Fig. 8, together with results of similar experiments in the packed bed reactor with premixed reactants. The difference in propylene yield obtained in reactor with premixed feed and the PBMR increases with oxygen concentration, indicating that in the case of PMBR, shortening the (hydrocarbon) contact time by increasing gas superficial velocity (oxygen permeation) leads to the desired intermediate product, even with low propane to oxygen ratios. This is also in line with results reported by Tonkovich et al. (1996) on ethane partial oxidation.

Influence of the oxygen inlet concentration at constant contact time at 733 K. Volumetric flow rate for both systems was kept at 85 ml/min (symbols—experiments; line—model).
A significantly higher propylene selectivity can be achieved with distributive oxygen feeding, especially at higher propane conversions. As can be clearly seen, the experimentally determined selectivity to propylene agrees well with results obtained from numerical model simulations, however, for somewhat higher conversions (obviously obtained at high oxygen concentrations!), the experimentally obtained selectivity tends to be slightly smaller than predicted. A possible explanation for this is the formation of acrolein (Davies and Taylor, 2004b, Davies and Taylor, 2004a), as mentioned earlier, which was not included in the modeling. Acrolein is formed at propane to oxygen ratios close, or lower than one, which was generally avoided, firstly because of the low selectivity to propylene and secondly because operation at these conditions falls within the explosion limits of the propane/oxygen mixture. Moreover, it can be concluded that the reproducibility of the experiments in the membrane reactor is quite good.
Another series of experiments was carried out where the total flow rate of reactants was varied, while keeping the inlet composition unchanged. These experiments were performed with a feed composition N2:C3H8:O2=6:3:1, while the total volumetric flow rate was varied between 25 and 95 ml/min. Results from these experiments are depicted in Fig. 9. Again, the experimental results compare well with the numerical simulations.

The selectivity to propylene at lower flow rates is slightly lower than expected from the simulation study. A possible explanation of this is the following: low (total) flow rate means low flow rate of propane in the tube side, but also low flow rate of oxygen in the shell side of the reactor. As a consequence, this low flow rate in the shell side corresponds to a lower transmembrane pressure, which increases the extent of cross-permeation somewhat. Therefore the conversion at the low flow rates is slightly under predicted, since propane can also react in the shell side, while the selectivity to propylene is somewhat over predicted. For the higher flow rates, the transmembrane pressure difference is higher, so that cross-permeation is negligible and the numerical simulations compare very well with the experimental results.
4.2.3. Influence of inert addition
The influence of different hydrocarbon concentrations was also examined experimentally. The overall concentration of propane in the first case was set to 20% of the total volumetric flow rate (50 ml/min) and the different conversions/selectivities were obtained by variation of the oxygen feed concentration. In the second case, the concentration of propane was set to 40%.
The experimentally obtained results, shown together with curves obtained from numerical simulations (see Fig. 10) show clearly that a better performance is achieved without dilution. Lower reactant concentrations reduce the reaction rate, thus requiring a higher oxygen concentration to obtain the same propane conversion with a corresponding decrease in the propylene selectivity.

5. Conclusions
In this work an experimental study was presented on the performance of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in a packed bed reactor with premixed reactants and a packed bed membrane reactor where oxygen was fed distributively. The influences of the flow rate, inlet composition and dilution were experimentally examined and compared with results obtained from numerical model simulations. It was experimentally demonstrated that significantly higher propylene yields can be achieved in a packed bed membrane reactor with distributive oxygen feed.
The results from the experiments where the inlet composition was altered compared very well with the simulation results, which also holds for the experiments with shell side dilution where the total volumetric flow rate was varied. Only for the case of tube side dilution larger discrepancies were found, where it has been shown that cross-permeation significantly decreased the overall performance of the membrane reactor, which was not accounted for in the modeling.
With this validated model, the properties of the catalyst and membranes (which should be tuned to each other) and the operating conditions (especially concerning pressure drop over the catalyst bed and the transmembrane pressure drop, as well as the oxygen concentration (profiles)), can be further optimized, giving the basis for an economic evaluation of the process.
At the end, it can be concluded that the propylene yields obtained in the packed bed membrane reactor are indeed significantly higher at higher propane conversions, compared to those obtained in the reactor with no distributive oxygen feeding and that the packed bed membrane reactor can outperform conventional reactors which are currently in industrial use.
