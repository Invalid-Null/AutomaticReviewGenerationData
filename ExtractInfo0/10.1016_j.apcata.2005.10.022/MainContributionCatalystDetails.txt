Based on the provided extractions, the document does not seem to contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) catalysts. The extractions indicate the document focuses on the synthesis and characterization of ZSM-48 zeolite catalysts for cracking C4 olefins to produce propylene. Since propane dehydrogenation is not discussed, I have marked the document as not relevant and did not include any details in the <IfRelated> section. Please let me know if I have misunderstood the document relevance based on the provided extractions.
