 Based on my analysis of the document, this does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document focuses on the synthesis and characterization of ZSM-48 zeolite catalysts for cracking C4 olefins to produce propylene. It does not discuss converting propane to propylene via PDH or ODH specifically.
