1. Introduction
Propylene, one of the most important building block in petrochemical industry, is used for production of a wide variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, 2-propanol, among others [1,2]. Due to its widespread applications, there is a growing gap between the supply and demand for the propylene [3,4]. Besides, largely available and cheap shale gas has motivated companies to shift the feedstock of steam crackers, the main source of propylene, to lighter feedstock, resulting in less propylene [5,6]. Among all of available technologies for production of propylene, direct Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) has the highest yield [7]. However, due to the endothermic nature of the reaction, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields [8,9]. Harsh reaction condition causes sintering of active metal and accelerates thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as coke formation [10,11]. All of these problems decrease the efficiency of the reaction and more importantly result in catalyst deactivation.
CrOx based catalysts, one of the commonly used commercial catalysts, are highly active for propane dehydrogenation but they suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke formation [12,13]. More importantly, the toxicity of Cr limits the application of these kind of catalysts [14]. Pt based catalysts are also widely used in commercial plants, being the most promising ones [15]. Pt based catalysts show higher activity along with lower rate of coke formation than CrOx catalysts. However, they exhibit quite poor selectivity, less than 50%, to propylene [16]. Therefore, it is vital to modify the properties of Pt for PDH reaction to improve selectivity and coke resistant. For this purpose, promotors such as tin, zinc, gallium and indium are commonly used [[17], [18], [19], [20]]. The role of Sn, the most commonly used promotor for Pt, can be attributed to either ensemble or electronic effects [[21], [22], [23]]. In the case of electronic effects, Sn donates electron to Pt [21,24]. This increases the energy barrier for dissociative adsorption of light alkanes and reduces the activity of platinum for coking [17,25]. In addition, the addition of Sn decreases the adsorption heat of propylene, resulting in an improved selectivity [26]. In the case of geometric effect, Sn can modify the Pt ensembles, reducing the availability of ensembles that favors hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in catalyst deactivation [27]. Thus, adding Sn mitigates deactivation. Sn can even isolate Pt atoms, in an ideal case into isolated single atoms, which results in better catalytic performance [28]. Besides Sn, other elements have also been used as promotor for Pt in PDH reaction. Han et al. [29] used copper to modify Pt properties. They observed higher propylene selectivity, lower deactivation rate, and enhanced anti-coking ability upon Cu addition [30,31]. Ren et al. [32] reported that IB group metals (Cu, Ag, Au) act as promotors in PDH reaction over an anti-sintering Mg-Al2O3 support. These elements show different modification on Pt. Cu and Ag dilute the surface of Pt and at the same time donate electron to Pt, while Au shows poor geometry modification and withdraws electrons from Pt. As a result, better catalytic performance was obtained when Cu and Ag were used as promotor. Recently, a research group [33,34] studied the roles of intermetallic compounds of Pt with Mn and Sb on the performance of Pt in PDH reaction. Their work revealed the importance of both alloy formation and geometric effect for PDH reaction.
Germanium, a well-known promoter, has been broadly used to modify the properties of Pt in the reforming process [35,36]. Borgna et.al. showed a promotional role of Ge in naphtha reforming resulting in higher sulfur resistance catalysts [37,38]. It was clearly shown that the reduction temperature plays a vital role in promoting the interaction between Pt and Ge. Bownam et al. [39] also claimed formation of Pt-Ge alloy using XPS. They reported that high temperature treatment with H2 is required for better interaction between Pt and Ge.
Although Ge has been extensively used to modify Pt, to the best of our knowledge there is no reports on the Ge effect for PDH reaction. In this work, we demonstrate the positive effect of germanium on enhancing propene selectivity and suppressing coke formation on Al2O3 supported Pt catalysts. The effect of reduction temperature and Ge/ Pt ratio were investigated. Fresh and spent catalysts were thoroughly characterized to establish a correlation between the active site, structure and electronic properties with the catalytic performance.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalyst
Ge-promoted Pt catalysts, denoted as Pt0.5-Gex/Al2O3, were prepared by sequential incipient wetness impregnation method using GeCl4 and H2PtCl6 as precursors. After each element impregnation, the sample was calcined at 550 °C for 3 h. Pt loading was fixed at 0.5 wt% and Ge loading was varied between 0–2.0 wt% (x = 0, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 wt%). Al2O3 (Aluminum oxide, anhydrous, γ-Al2O3, Merck, Particle size ≤ 0.2 mm) was used as support. Other chemicals were provided from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further treatment.
2.2. Catalyst characterisation
The Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) specific surface areas were obtained from N2 isotherms obtained using a Micromeritic ASAP 2420. The sample was first pre-treated at 300 °C for 5 h under vacuum, and then the isotherms were recorded at 77 K. BJH method was used for the calculation of pore volumes. Metal dispersion was obtained via CO-chemisorption in a micrometrics ASAP 2020 automated adsorption analyser. 50 mg of sample was loaded in a U-shape quartz tube. The sample was heated up at 10 °C/min to 600 °C under H2 and kept at this temperature for 90 min. Then, sample was cooled down to 350 °C and evacuated for 30 min before being cooled to 35 °C for CO chemisorption. Vacuum set point was 5 μmHg and the adsorption stoichiometry of CO/Pt was 1:1. Pt weight loadings measured from ICP were used in analysis.
The actual content of Pt was measured by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Before the measurement, around 100 mg of sample was dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid (1:1 ratio) using microwave digestion. Then it was diluted with water 400 times.
TEM images were taken on a Thermo Scientific™ Talos F200X scanning/transmission electron microscope (S/TEM). The microscope was equipped with a high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). The reduced catalysts were prepared prior to the analysis using similar procedure to the one for catalyst activation for the catalytic studies. Spent catalysts were also characterized. 10 mg powder was dispersed in 1 ml ethanol, sonicated for 20 min and dropped on a carbon grid for analysis.
TPR profiles of the samples were obtained using TPDRO 1100 system (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. First, 100 mg of the catalyst was outgassed under argon at 150 °C for 60 min and then cooled down to the room temperature. Then TPR profiles were obtained under 50 ml/min flow of 5% H2/95% Ar from room temperature to 900 °C using heating rate of 5 °C/min.
FT-IR spectra of chemisorbed CO were obtained on a Frontier MIR (PerkinElmer) equipped with a mercury–cadmium–telluride (MCT) detector. The reduced samples were placed in a closed dome fitted with ZnSe windows. First, the samples were pre-treated in flowing 10% H2/He (50 ml/min) for 90 min at 600 °C. Then, the sample was cooled down to 30 °C under helium. After the background was collected at room temperature under He, samples were saturated with 2% CO/He for 30 min. Subsequently, the physically adsorbed CO was removed using flowing He. For reduction temperature analysis samples were reduced at 400 °C and 800 °C, respectively.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a VG ESCALAB 250 spectrometer equipped with monochromatic Mg Kα radiation. All of the samples were reduced with 40% H2/60% N2 (flow rate: 50 ml/min) for 90 min prior to charecterization. Reduction treatments prior to XPS analysis were carried out ex-situ. In order to study the effect of Ge loading, the samples were reduced at 600 °C, while the effect of the reduction temperature was investigated on the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 sample reduced at 400 °C, 600 °C and 800 °C, respectively. Precautions were taken to avoid exposure of the samples to air. After reduction in the TPR system, the samples were transferred to a glovebox filled with Ar, using closed TPR tubes to avoid any contact with air. Then the reduced samples were unloaded from TPR tubes and loaded in XPS holder inside the glovebox. The XPS holder was quickly transferred into the XPS chamber under protection with inert gas and then evacuated for 120 min prior to XPS analysis to ensure removal of surface species. The binding energies were calibrated using C1s level at 284.8 eV as an internal standard.
X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) at the Ge-K edge and Pt-L3 edge were recorded at the XAFCA beamline at the Singapore Synchrotron Light Source [40]. Sample wafers were in situ reduced for 90 min under 40% H2/60% He (flow rate:50 ml/min) at 600 °C. Spectra were collected when temperature was cooled down to room temperature. Data was processed by winXAS software.
NH3-TPD was carried out to evaluate acidic properties of the samples. For this analysis, 100 mg of the catalyst was loaded in the TPD system and flushed with N2 for few minutes at room temperature. Temperature was ramped up to 600 °C and the catalyst reduced at this temperature under 5% H2 (50 ml/min) for 90 min. Temperature was cooled down to 100 °C, and the sample was saturated with NH3 (50 ml/min) for 60 min. Finally, the sample was flushed under He using a flow rate of 50 ml/min for 60 min at 100 °C and the profiles were recorded by heating up the sample from 100 °C to 900 °C under 50 ml/min flow of He.
Raman spectra were obtained under ambient conditions using a Renishaw inVia Reex Raman spectrometer with a 532 nm Ar-ion laser beam. Data acquisition was conducted with an exposure time of 10 s and 1 accumulation. Carbon deposition on the spent catalyst was investigated by TGA analysis. The samples were first pre-treated in N2 at 80 °C for 30 min. Then, the spectra were recorded from 30 °C to 900 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min under flowing 40 ml/min air and 60 ml/min N2 (total flow rate 100 ml/min).
2.3. Catalytic test
A fixed-bed quartz tube reactor (5 mm ID, 600 mm length) was used for PDH experiments. 200 mg of the catalyst (particle size between 250 μm – 500 μm) was loaded into the reactor and held by quartz wool. The temperature was ramped up in nitrogen environment to the favorite reduction temperature (400 °C, 600 °C or 800 °C), and then 40% H2 in N2 with total flow rate of 50 ml/min was introduced for in-situ catalyst reduction. After reduction, the catalyst was purged with N2 for 30 min. Then, the reaction mixture was introduced into the reactor. The reaction temperature and total pressure were 600 °C and 1 atm, respectively. The molar ratios of C3H8/H2/N2/Ar in feed were fixed at 1:1.5:18.24:1 and a total flow rate of 50 ml/min was used. The outlet gases were analyzed by an on-line GC (Shimadzu, 2014). A flame ionization detector was used to detect hydrocarbons (Column: GS-GASPRO 30 m length, 32 mm ID) while a thermal conductivity detector was used for H2 detection (Column: HayeSep D), using N2 as carrier gas. Argon was used as the internal standard in the calculations of the out let total flow rate and the following equations were applied in the calculation of conversion, selectivity, deactivation parameter and conversion rate for propane:
Where Fi is flow rate of hydrocarbon (L/min), ni is the number of carbon atom, t is the reaction time (h), Xend is the conversion at end of reaction, Xin is the initial conversion, mcat is the loading of catalyst (g), and wpt is the weight percentage of Pt.
After reaction, the catalysts were purged with N2, cooled down to room temperature and removed from the reactor for further characterisation.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Catalytic results
3.1.1. Effect of Ge loading
The catalytic performance of Pt0.5/Al2O3 catalysts with different Ge loading reduced at 600 °C is depicted in Fig. 1(a) and (b). As shown in the Fig. 1(a), the initial propane conversion is quite high for the monometallic Pt0.5/Al2O3 catalyst (81.1%); however, it rapidly decreases to 42.3% at end of the reaction. Adding Ge lowers propane conversion at the begging of the reaction (62.3% for Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3). However, the catalyst remains relatively stable throughout of the reaction, showing only a slight decrease of the propane conversion at the end of the TOS (52.9% for Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3). After 245 min of TOS, selectivity of Pt0.5/Al2O3, Pt0.5-Ge1/Al2O3, Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3, Pt0.5-Ge2/Al2O3 to propylene are 56.9%, 94.8%, 97.2%, 95.9%, respectively. This suggests a positive effect of Ge, resulting in an improved selectivity of the catalyst. The deactivation constant kd (1/h) is used to determine the catalyst deactivation [41]. The kd values for Pt0.5/Al2O3, Pt0.5-Ge1/Al2O3, Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 and Pt0.5-Ge2/Al2O3 are 0.42 1/h, 0.21 1/h,0.10 1/h, and 0.16 1/h, respectively. A higher deactivation constant for the monometallic catalyst clearly indicates the rapid deactivation of this sample. These results highlight the promoting effect of Ge on improving catalytic performance during PDH reaction. In addition, Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 sample shows the lowest deactivation rate and the highest propene selectivity. Therefore, this sample will be investigated in more detail in the following sections.

3.1.2. Effects of the reduction and reaction temperature
Since Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 showed the best catalytic performance among the Pt-Ge samples, it was further investigated. Firstly, the effect of the reduction temperature was investigated by reducing the sample at three different temperatures and then tested in PDH reaction. The catalytic data are depicted in Fig. 2(a). After reducing the catalyst at the lowest reduction temperature (400 °C), the initial selectivity is quite low (82.5%) but increases rapidly to around 96.4%, while the conversion is initially high (71.9%), then it decreases quite fast. Increasing the reduction temperature to 600 °C leads to a better catalytic performance, showing a selectivity of 97.2% and lower deactivation. Further increasing the reduction temperature from 600 °C to 800 °C increases propylene selectivity from 97.2% to 98.1%. However, the propane reaction rate decreases from 3.86 mol/ (gpt. h) at 600 °C to 2.40 mol/ (gpt. h) at 800 °C.

The effect of reaction temperature was also investigated on the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 sample reduced at 600 °C and the catalytic data are depicted in Fig. 2(b). As discussed in the previous section, performing the reaction at high temperature (600 °C) results in high conversion and reaction rate. Decreasing reaction temperature to 550 °C, initial conversion and selectivity become 38.6% and 95.0% respectively. After 245 min TOS these values become 35.7% and 98.6% respectively. The catalyst is quite stable at this temperature (kd = 0.03 1/h). With running reaction at 500 °C, conversion decreases more to 19.8% and selectivity increases further to 97.4% at the beginning of the reaction. The values of conversion and selectivity at the end of the reaction are 18.2% and 98.9% respectively (kd = 0.02 1/h). Better stability of the catalyst at lower reaction temperatures is due to less coke formation which is more favorable at high temperature because of cracking [42].
3.2. Characterization of fresh and spent catalysts
3.2.1. Textural properties
Textural properties of the samples with different Ge loadings and reduced at different temperatures are summarized in Table 1. The changes in both BET surface area and pore volume of the Al2O3 support are not significant after adding Pt and Ge. It suggests that most of the nanoparticles are in the external surface of the support and thus accessible to the reactants. The metallic Pt surface area, obtained by CO-chemisorption, decreases after introducing Ge. Monometallic Pt0.5/Al2O3 shows 0.71 m2/g of Pt surface area, but it decreases when Ge was added to catalyst, especially at high Ge loading and at the high reduction temperature. This decrease of metallic Pt surface area upon adding Ge indicates that Ge species partly cover Pt surface sites [37], resulting in a lower metal surface area and a lower dispersion. The interaction between Pt and Ge will be further studied in section 3.2.5.

3.2.2. TEM images
To further investigate metal dispersion and particle size distribution of two selected samples (Pt0.5/Al2O3 and Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3), dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was used. As shown in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b), both reduced samples show uniform and highly dispersed small metal particles. Besides, the particle size in both samples are in the same range, suggesting the presence of Ge does not affect the particle size significantly.

One of the challenges of PDH reaction is the sintering of active metals at high reaction temperatures. Sintering will decrease the accessible surface area of Pt, at the same time, structure-senstive side reactions such as hydrogenolysis and carbon deposition will be enhanced, accelerating catalyst deactivation [43]. STEM images of Pt0.5/Al2O3 and Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 samples after 245 min of TOS are shown in Fig. 3(c) and 3(d). There is no obvious change in particle size of Pt for both spent catalysts.
3.2.3. Temperature-programmed reduction studies
The reduction profiles of the samples with different Ge loadings are shown in Fig. 4. There are two peaks located at 250 °C and 369 °C in the TPR profile of the Pt0.5/Al2O3 catalyst. These two peaks are attributed to the reduction of PtOCl2 species on the surface and Pt species strongly interacting with the support, respectively [44,45]. In the absence of platinum, only one broad reduction peak centered at 650 °C is observed on the TPR profile of Ge1.5/Al2O3 sample. The reduction profiles change significantly when Ge is added to Pt. The reduction of Pt is shifted to higher temperature. Meanwhile, the reduction peak related to Ge species appears at lower temperature. The changes in the reduction profiles of Pt and Ge in the bimetallic Pt-Ge catalysts point out the existence of an interaction between Pt and Ge. Spillover of H dissociated by Pt can continuously promote the reduction of Ge oxides at lower temperature [46].

To quantify the extent of GeOx reduction, samples were reduced at different temperatures (600 °C for loading analysis) and TPR analysis was repeated. The following formula was used to calculate reduction degree (Rdeg) [47]:
TPR profiles of calcined and reduced samples are shown in Fig. 5. After deconvolution of the peaks, three peaks are available in the calcined spectra of Pt-Ge samples (dash dot lines). First one is related to Pt, and the remaining two, appearing at higher temperatures, are related to Ge. After reduction and performing TPR experiments, the first peak totally disappears due to the full reduction of Pt. Accordingly, the peaks at higher temperatures are used for calculating degree of reduction, and summary is presented in Table 2.

Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-800 180192 51102 71.6 %
According to Table 2, extent of reduction for Ge loading is Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 > Pt0.5-Ge2/Al2O3 > Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3. However, as Ge loading is higher for Pt0.5-Ge2/Al2O3 the amount of metallic Ge should be higher in this sample. Evidently, with increasing reduction temperature the extent of reduction increases.
3.2.4. DRIFT studies of adsorbed CO
DRIFTS spectra of adsorbed CO was used to study both electronic properties and surface structure of the samples. The CO adsorption bands on the monometallic Pt0.5/Al2O3 sample and the Ge-promoted Pt catalysts with different Ge loadings are shown in Fig. 6. Two IR bands are observed; one located at around 1820 cm−1 is assigned to the adsorbed bridging CO on the adjacent Pt-Pt sites [17] and a higher wavenumber band, between 2000 cm−1–2100 cm−1 is ascribed to linearly adsorbed CO on Pt atoms. This higher wavenumber band can be deconvoluted into three different peaks corresponding to linearly adsorbed CO on highly coordinated Pt sites (2075 cm−1), on terrace (2055 cm−1) and on corners (2031 cm−1), respectively [29,32]. On the Pt-Ge catalyst with 1.0% Ge, the intensity of the broad band at lower wavenumber ascribed to bridged CO is reduced significantly. This band disappears when the Ge loading is further increased to 1.5% and 2.0%. In addition, the intense band at 2055 cm−1 on Pt catalyst shifts to 2062 cm−1, 2069 cm−1, and 2066 cm−1 with the addition of 1.0% Ge, 1.5% Ge and 2.0% Ge, respectively.

CO adsorption on the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 catalyst reduced at different temperature was also investigated. Although the bridged CO does not exist on the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 reduced at 600 °C and 800 °C, it appears at 1844 cm−1 on the sample reduced at 400 °C. The linearly adsorbed CO bands for 400 °C and 800 °C also appear at 2066 cm−1. This CO adsorption study clearly shows the existence of an interaction between Pt and Ge. Indeed, the electronic properties and the structure of Pt have been modified by the addition of Ge. Upon adding Ge, the peaks of linear CO shifted to upward frequencies. This upward shift can be related to an electronic effect of Ge, withdrawing electron from Pt. As a result, Pt is electron deficient and the back donation of electrons from Pt to the antibonding 2π-orbitals of adsorbed CO is decreased. Accordingly, the strength of the CO bond decreases, resulting in an increase of the CO frequency [48,49]. This demonstrates that the electronic properties of Pt atoms in the monometallic catalyst compared to the bimetallic Pt-Ge ones are significantly different. This electronic effect will be further investigated by XPS and XANES.
3.2.5. XPS and XANES studies
XPS was used to measure the chemical state of Pt and Ge in both the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. For Pt, the most intense photoemission line corresponds to the Pt 4f core level. However, this peak overlaps with the Al 2 P peak, resulting in a challenging analysis of the Pt chemical state, which requires an accurate deconvolution of the peaks. The deconvoluted spectra of the Pt 4f and Al 2 P are shown in Fig. 7. The binding energies (BE) for Pt0.5/Al2O3 and Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 are 71.15 eV and 71.40 eV, respectively. The standard binding energy for Pt in metallic state is 71.0 eV [50]. While the BE of the monometallic sample is only slightly shifted to higher BE values, the shift is significantly higher for the bimetallic catalyst, suggesting electronic effects of Ge on Pt [39,49].

In order to shed more light on the electronic state of Pt, the chemical shift of the Pt 4d5/2 peaks of the samples with different Ge loadings and reduced at different temperatures was also investigated. Although the Pt 4d line is weaker, it does not overlap with any other peak, making the data more reliable. The binding energy between 314.0–315.0 eV is ascribed to metallic Pt, while the higher binding energy, between 317.5–318.5 eV, is attributed to oxidized Pt species [51,52]. The Pt 4d5/2 binding energy for all samples, after background subtraction and peak fitting using the Shirley’s method, are depicted in Fig. 8(A) and (B). All reduced samples show the Pt 4d5/2 peak in the range of metallic Pt. However, all bimetallic samples exhibit this peak shifted to higher binding energy in comparison with the monometallic Pt catalyst. The higher binding energy is significantly lower than the one corresponding to Pt oxide species [28] and is higher than metallic Pt peaks. This binding energy shift of the Pt peak suggests an electron transfer from Pt to Ge, most likely due to formation of a Pt-Ge surface alloy. The extent of the electron transfer as a function of reduction temperature is in the following order: 600 °C > 800 °C > 400 °C, while the extent of the transfer as a function of loading is: 1.5% > 2.0% > 1.0%. The existence of different amount of metallic Ge and GeOx species can be ascribed for the different binding energy shifts. To investigate the relative amount of metalic Ge and GeOx species, XPS spectrum of the Ge 3d was analysed. In the Ge 3d XPS spectrum, the lower BE peak is attributed to metalic Ge, while the higher one is related to Ge (II–IV) species [52]. In Fig. 9(A) and (B), XPS spectra of the Ge 3d of all samples are depicted. With increased loading and reduction temperature, the relative amount of metalic Ge to GeOx species increases, as indicated by the different ratio of metallic Ge and GeOx species reported in Table S3, which results in different binding energy shifts of Pt XPS peak.

Since XPS binding energy can be affected by particle size effects, the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy will be further elucidated by XAS. Accordingly, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of Pt L3-edge was used to investigate the alloy formation and the electron transfer from Pt to Ge. The XANES spectra are depicted in the Fig. 10. Clearly, the white line intensity of the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/ Al2O3 reduced at 600 °C is higher than those of Pt-foil and Pt0.5/Al2O3 catalyst, but much lower than that of PtO2, indicating the Pt is in an electron-deficient state in the bimetallic Pt-Ge sample. This can be explained by the electron donation to Ge due to alloy formation.

3.2.6. NH3-TPD studies
It has been reported that upon addition of GeOx to Al2O3 support, the distribution of acidic centers will change. The amount of strong acidic centers, which appear at higher temperature, will decrease and the amount of lower and medium acidic centers, appearing at lower temperatures will increase [35,36]. Regarding this issue, NH3-TPD was carried out. The related results are shown in Fig. 11 and the amounts of adsorbed NH3 are tabulated in Table 3. For all of the samples, there are only NH3 desorption peaks appear at low temperatures around 170 °C and 240 °C related to weak and medium acidic centers respectively, suggesting addition of Ge doesn’t change the acidic strength of Al2O3. With addition of Ge, the amount of total adsorbed NH3 is decreased about 12%. However, the differences in the acidity among the Ge modified catalysts are not significant. As the used support does not have strong acidic centers, and the reduction of acidic amount with adding Ge is not significant, the role of acidic centers in this study is negligible.

3.3. Coke analysis
Fig. S2 shows the carbon balance for Pt0.5/Al2O3 and Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 samples. At the initial step of the reaction the mass balance results suggest that propane is converted to carbon species and deposited on the Pt0.5/Al2O3 catalyst, resulting in a poor carbon balance [3]. The lower selectivity of this catalyst is also consistent with its poor carbon balance. Upon adding Ge, the properties of Pt are modified, significantly impacting on the catalytic performance. Clearly, the carbon balance is strongly improved due to the much less coke formation.
TGA and Raman were used to analyse the nature of the carbon species deposited on the catalyst after PDH reaction at 600 °C. TGA profiles for both Pt0.5/Al2O3 and Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 12. Generally, three peaks can be ascribed to the TGA profile. The first one observed at lower temperature, around 160 °C, is related to the combustion of adsorbed H on the catalyst [53]. The two other peaks at higher temperatures are respectively attributed to the burning of carbon species on the metal site, and on the support, respectively [29]. In this study second and third peaks are obvious in the samples. Clearly, the addition of Ge decreases the amount of carbon deposition. Indeed, the amount of carbon between 400 °C–500 °C have been greatly reduced (50%) on the Pt-Ge catalyst compared to the Pt catalyst. This carbon species are attributed to coke on the metal particles [54]. Since large ensembles of Pt are required for the formation of these carbonaceous compound at higher temperatures on the metal sites [55], the addition of Ge reduces the number of these ensembles, decreasing carbon formation on the metal sites and thus improving the anti-cocking ability of the Ge promoted catalyst.

In addition, according to the Raman spectra of Pt0.5/Al2O3 and Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 shown in the supplementary information (Fig. S3), the I value (D/G ratio) is 0.80 for Pt0.5/Al2O3, and 0.89 for Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3. The smaller I value for Pt0.5/Al2O3 suggests that the coke is further dehydrogenated, resulting in a more graphitic type carbon on this sample [5].
4. Discussion
Ge modified Pt catalysts with different Ge loadings and reduced at different temperatures were used in the PDH reaction. Clearly, the catalysts reduced at 600 °C show the best catalytic performance. This better catalytic performance upon adding Ge is due to alloy formation between Pt and Ge, which has been strongly indicated by different characterization techniques. Upon alloy formation, both the geometric and electronic properties of Pt are significantly modified. However, the reduction temperature plays a key role in the formation of Pt-Ge alloy, and higher reduction temperatures are required to enable the interaction between Pt and Ge.
According to the TPR profiles (Fig. 4), at a lower reduction temperature at around 400 °C, all of the Pt reduces. However, Ge reduction at such a low temperature hardly takes place and just a tiny fraction of Ge might be reduced to metalic phase while the vast majority remains as an oxide phase and most propably as Ge4+. Therefore, alloy formation at such a low temperature does not necessarily take place. Furthermore, DRIFT data presented in Fig. 6 indicates that adsorbed CO on adjacent Pt-Pt exhibits a sharp peack for this sample, suggesting poor interaction between Pt and Ge. The catalytic performance of this sample at the beginning of the reaction reflects the initial state of Pt and Ge. As shown in Fig. 2(a), from 0 to 40 min, this sample shows higher conversion and lower selectivity due to the lack of Pt-Ge interactions and the existence of coordinatively unsaturated Pt sites, which exhibit higher activity toward cracking [56]. Therefore, the coking rate for this sample should be higher than the one observed on the samples reduced at higher temperatures, at least at the initial stage of the reaction (Fig. S4). Since the reaction takes place at 600 °C, Ge starts to be reduced further, resulting in the formation of Pt-Ge interactions. Thus, the coordinatively unsaturated Pt sites will be inhibited by the formation of Pt-Ge interactions, leading to an increase of selectivity with TOS. After a short period of TOS, the selectivity of the sample reduced at 400 °C is almost the same as the one on the sample reduced at 600 °C. When reduction temperature is increased to 600 °C, the degree of Ge reduction increases, resulting in a Pt-Ge alloy formation and a better catalytic performance [37]. Thus, the sample reduced at higher temperature exhibits lower coking rate as compared to the one reduced at 400 °C, resulting in higher activity and conversion in the long term. Further increase of the reduction temperature to 800 °C leads to Ge mostly in metalic state. Upon reduction at 800 °C, the catalytic activity of the catalyst is significantly lower. As previously reported, the alloy formation with Ge decreases the dehydrogenation activity of Pt [57,58]. Besides, according to the CO chemisorption data reported in the Table 1, the reduction at high temperature results in lower active metal surface since Pt surface sides are covered by Ge in metallic state [59]. These two combined effects can certainly explain the lower activity exhibited by the Pt-Ge sample reduced at 800 °C.
Ge loading shows a similar trend. At lower Ge loading (1.0%), the extent of the Pt-Ge interaction is limited (Fig. 6). Increasing the Ge loading leads to an increase in the extent of the Pt-Ge interaction, resulting in improved catalytic performance. However, when the Ge loading is increased beyond 1.5%, the activity starts to decrease due to excess of Ge, suggesting the existance of an optimum loading.
The shift in the binding energy of Pt in the XPS spectra (Fig. 7, Fig. 8), along with the increase of white line intensity observed in the XANES spectra (Fig. 10), clearly demonstrates the existance of a close interaction between Pt and metallic Ge atoms. This close interaction is most likely ascribed to the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, where Pt is electron-deficient. In addition, the alloy formation also decreases the number of Pt ensembles, thus decreasing the activity for CC bond cleavage. Hence, the decrease of the number of Pt ensembes inhibits both hydrogenalysis and coke formation [18], leading to an increase of selectivity to propylene and a decrease of catalyst deactivation [29]. On the other hand, because of the electron transfer to Ge, Pt is in electron deficient state. According to DFT calculations by Sun et al. [60], when Pt is electron deficient, the d band center is closer to the Fermi level, resulting in a more active Pt for CH bond cleavage. Fig. S5 shows selectivity to C3H6 and CH4. The lower selectivity of Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 to CH4, clearly demonstrate that adding Ge to Pt suppress CC bond cleavage, most likely due to the increase of the activation energy [29]. At the same time, high selectivity to C3H6 highlights its good activity for CH bond cleavage.
5. Conclusion
Ge exhibits positive effect for PDH Pt catalyst in terms of stability and propylene selectivity. The sample with 0.5% Pt 1.5% Ge loading reduced at 600 °C shows the best catalytic performance, leading to a conversion of 55.7% and selectivity of 96.5%. Proper reduction temperature and Pt to Ge ratio are vital to have good interaction between Pt and Ge. The improved catalytic performance can be ascribed to a Pt-Ge alloy formation, resulting in a modification of the catalytic properties of Pt via geometric and electronic effects. Ge withdraws electron from Pt, making it electron deficient and, therefore, more active for CH cleavage. In addition, dilution of Pt surface by Ge favors propylene selectivity and increase catalyst stability.
