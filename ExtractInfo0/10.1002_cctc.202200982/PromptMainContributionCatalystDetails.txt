Revealing the Catalytic Role of Sn Dopant in CO2-Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane over Pt/Sn-CeO2 Catalyst
Graphical Abstract
A Pt/Sn-CeO2 catalyst shows a higher catalytic activity in CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane than a Pt/CeO2 catalyst. It derives from the crucial role of Sn dopant. The Sn doping not only increases the electron density of Pt species via PtSn alloy formation but also enhances oxygen vacancy concentrations of CeO2 support, leading to the enhancement of propane adsorption and CO2 dissociation.
Abstract
CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) provides a promising route for propylene production. Sufficient propane conversion and propylene selectivity remain a great challenge due to the difficulty in activating inert propane and CO2 simultaneously. Herein, a Sn doped CeO2 supported Pt (Pt/Sn-CeO2) catalyst in CO2-ODHP reaction is reported. Sn doping appears to kill two birds with one stone for propane and CO2 activation. On the one side, it increases the electron density of Pt species via PtSn alloy formation, promoting propane adsorption and C−H bond cleavage. On the other side, it enhances oxygen vacancy concentrations of CeO2 support, facilitating CO2 dissociation. A higher propylene selectivity (63.9 % vs 22.3 %) was obtained on 0.1 wt % Pt/1.0 wt % Sn-CeO2 than that on 0.1 wt % Pt/CeO2 with a comparable propane conversion (15.1 % vs 14.3 %) at 550 °C after 240 min on stream. This work provides a reference for designing efficient catalysts.
Introduction
Propylene, as one of the important industrial raw materials, has been widely used as building blocks for the production of various value-added chemicals, such as polypropylene and polyacrylonitrile.1 Much attention has been paid to the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene because of its superior selectivity. However, this endothermic dehydrogenation process suffers from high energy consumption due to the thermosdynamically limited process, as well as a rapid deactivation of catalysts from the coke formation.2 Although the O2-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane could overcome the abovementioned disadvantages, it generally proceeds along with the excessive oxidation of propane to CO2 derived from the high oxidizing ability of O2, decreasing the propylene selectivity.3-5 Alternatively, CO2, as a soft oxidant, has been widely used in many reactions.3 The CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) has been identified as a promising process for propylene production.1, 6, 7 It is still a great challenge to achieve high propylene selectivity and propane conversion due to the thermodynamical and chemical stability of both propane and CO2.8 Therefore, developing efficient catalysts with excellent catalytic activity in the selective cleavage of C−H bond and CO2 activation is in a great demand.
Two typical reaction mechanisms of CO2-ODHP reaction have been reported: 1) MvK mechanism over reducible catalysts (such as CrOx, and VOx); and 2) two-step mechanism involved propane dehydrogenation and reverse water-gas shift processes over non-reducible catalysts (such as GaOx, and InOx) (Scheme 1).1, 7 Both of them suggest the necessity for the C−H bond cleavage and CO2 activation. Supported Pt materials are well-known propane dehydrogenation catalysts, because of their excellent selectivity in C−H bond cleavage accompanying with limited C−C bond cleavage.9 Nonetheless, introduction of a second metal as a promoter is generally essential and fascinating to further enhance the propylene selectivity and stability of Pt catalysts.10, 11 In particular, tin, as the most studied promoter so far, shows both geometric and electronic effects on the catalysis of Pt species in the propane dehydrogenation.12, 13 It not only promotes the dispersion of Pt species, but also modify the electronic properties of Pt species.2, 14 When CO2 was applied as a soft oxidant in the oxidation dehydrogenation of propane, a MvK mechanism is generally involved which is related to a redox process including CO2 dissociation (Scheme 1).15 CeO2, which possesses excellent redox properties, has been considered as an attractive catalyst for CO2 dissociation.15-22 Its superior capability derives from the unique oxygen-releasing ability, which is closely linked to its defective structure with oxygen vacancies.23 Rich oxygen vacancies on CeO2 will facilitate CO2 dissociation. Previous work in propane dehydrogenation over ceria supported catalysts primarily focuses on the interaction between Pt and Sn species, which were introduced into ceria supports by conventional co-impregnation method.24 And the effects of Ce as promoter on supported PtSn catalysts were also reported.25, 26 However, understanding of the interaction among Pt, Sn species and ceria support is still limited. For CeO2-based catalysts, metal-doping has been used as an efficient way to enhance the formation of oxygen vacancies and it was found that Sn doping significantly improves the oxygen vacancy concentrations of CeO2 in our previous work.23, 27-30 Inspired by the direct dehydrogenation property of Pt, CO2 activation ability of CeO2, and doping effects of Sn, designing a supported Pt catalysts with Sn doped CeO2 as support would show a great potential to realize the multiple functions required to activate C−H bonds and inert CO2 simultaneously in CO2-ODHP, contributing to the further understanding of the interaction of Pt, Sn metals and ceria supports.

In this work, a multifunctional Sn doped CeO2-supported Pt (Pt/Sn-CeO2) catalyst was prepared, achieving a high propylene selectivity of 63.9 % with propane conversion at 15.1 % in CO2-ODHP reaction over 0.1 Pt/1.0Sn-CeO2 at 550 °C for 240 min. Enhanced selectivity was attributed to the influence of Sn doping on the activation of propane and CO2. Further characterizations reveal that Sn doping could improve the electron density of Pt species and oxygen vacancy concentration of CeO2 support simultaneously, resulting in the enhancement of propane adsorption and CO2 dissociation. At last, a MvK reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of the in situ IR results.
Results and Discussion
Catalytic performances of 1.0 Pt/CeO2 and 1.0 Pt/n Sn-CeO2
1.0 Pt/n Sn-CeO2 catalysts with various Sn doping amounts (0.5 wt %, 1.0 wt %, 2.0 wt % and 5.0 wt %) were prepared and applied in the CO2-ODHP reaction at 550 °C. 1.0 Pt/CeO2 was also prepared and evaluated for comparison. 1.0 Pt/CeO2 showed 98 % propane conversion which is the highest in the initial 20 min (Figure 1a) and the CO2-ODHP reaction did not occur without catalysts (Table S1, entry 1). Prolonging the reaction time, propane conversion on 1.0 Pt/CeO2 decreased and maintained at around 70 % after reaction for 280 min. Considering the fact that the equilibrium conversion of propane in CO2-ODHP is 33 % under this reaction condition, the transformation of propane and CO2 over 1.0 Pt/CeO2 proceeded not only via CO2-ODHP but also other routes such as dry reforming of propane via C−C bond cleavage, which has a high equilibrium conversion (>99 %) under this reaction conditions.35 Instead of pristine CeO2 by Sn-CeO2 as the support, the propane conversion decreased remarkably. The initial propane conversion dropped to 75 %∼90 %, and then continued decreasing to 43∼57 % over 1.0 Pt/n Sn-CeO2 catalysts after reaction for 280 min. In addition, the ceria-based catalysts (1.0 Pt/CeO2 and 1.0 Pt/n Sn-CeO2) exhibited high CO2 conversions (56–96 %), suggesting the excellent ability of these catalysts for CO2 activation and reduction (Figure 1b). Although the Sn doping decreased the propane conversion, it improved the selectivity of propylene significantly (Figure 1c). The highest selectivity of propylene was obtained over 1.0 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 (27.8 %), which was superior to that over 1.0 Pt/CeO2 (<2.5 %) and other 1.0 Pt/n Sn-CeO2 catalysts (<23.9 %).

The major by-products are CH4, C2H6 and CO, which were produced via cracking and dry reforming processes (Figure 2a). A comparison of catalytic performances over 1.0 Pt/CeO2 and 1.0 Pt/n Sn-CeO2 suggested that Sn doping with moderate Sn amounts (1 wt % Sn) contributed to the selective generation of propylene with a comparable propane/CO2 conversion in the CO2-ODHP reaction (Figure 2b). Propylene yield was calculated on the basis of propane conversion and propylene selectivity and it increased during the reaction and leveled off after reaction for 200 min over all catalysts (Figure S1). The highest propylene yield (14.5 %) was obtained over 1.0 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 catalyst. Therefore, 1.0 Sn-CeO2 was selected as the optimal support for the subsequent investigation.

Effects of Sn-doping on Pt chemical states and ceria properties in 1.0 Pt/n Sn-CeO2
The catalytic performances of supported PtSn catalysts could be regulated by both the geometric effect and electronic effects of Pt species induced by Sn modification. Firstly, the geometric or size effect of Pt species induced by Sn doping was investigated by elemental mapping. Typically, the catalysts of 1.0 Pt/CeO2, 1.0 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2, and 1.0 Pt/5.0 Sn-CeO2 were chosen as the representative ones and their results are shown in Figure 3. It shows that most of Pt species were homogeneously distributed over the ceria-based supports, particularly over Sn doped ceria supports. Some bright part was observed from Pt elemental mapping in certain locations, suggesting that part of Pt sites tend to be aggregated. No obvious difference in Pt particle size was observed between 1.0 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 and 1.0 Pt/5.0 Sn-CeO2. This indicates that the differences in catalytic performances are not so closely associated with geometric effects of Pt species induced by Sn doping.

Further study was focused on the chemical states of Pt species induced by Sn doping. XPS was firstly conducted to investigate the effects of Sn doping on the chemical states of Pt species over 1.0 Pt/CeO2, 1.0 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2, and 1.0 Pt/5.0 Sn-CeO2, respectively (Figure 4). From the 4f Pt XPS spectra, both positively charged Pt (Ptn+) and metallic Pt (Pt0) species were observed on all these samples, which verified by the presence of two peaks located at the binding energy of 71.9 eV and 70.85∼71.53 eV, respectively.36 It was known that the Pt0 species was generally located at a binding energy of 70.5∼70.9 eV and would shift to a higher binding energy (71.2∼71.5 eV) when it was supported on reducible metal oxides due to the strong metal-support interaction via electron transfer from metal to supports. Here, the binding energy associated with Pt0 species on 1.0 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 (70.85 eV) is lower than those on 1.0 Pt/CeO2 (71.53 eV) and 1.0 Pt/5.0 Sn-CeO2 (71.48 eV) and this demonstrates that Sn doping with moderate Sn amount weakens the interaction between Pt and Sn-CeO2 support, leading to the formation of Pt0 species with rich electrons.

Figure 5 shows the 3d Sn spectrum of 1.0 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 which indicates that the Sn species mainly consists of tin oxide (Snn+) and metallic Sn (Sn0), as demonstrated by a binding energy at 485.5 eV and 486.2 eV, respectively. The formation of Sn0 along with the formation of electron-rich Pt0 species reveals the possibility of the formation of alloyed Sn0 with Pt (PtSn alloy), which is consistent with the reported results.37, 38 The proportion of Sn0 species was estimated to be ∼26 %, while the other ∼74 % tin species which present as Snn+ was probably anchored into CeO2 matrix and maintained its oxidation states during the activation via reduction.

The chemical states of Pt species on 1.0 Pt/CeO2, and 1.0 Pt/n Sn-CeO2 were also studied by FTIR with CO as a probe (Figure 6a). It confirmed the co-existence of Ptn+ and Pt0 sites on these samples, which was consistent with XPS results. For 1.0 Pt/CeO2, the band located at 2122 cm−1 was assigned to the vibration of CO adsorbed on the Ptn+ sites, while the bands at 2085 and 2070 cm−1 could be attributed to that on Pt0 sites.36, 39, 40 With 0.5∼1.0 wt % Sn doping, there was only one major band located at around 2070 cm−1. With increasing the Sn doping amount to 2.0∼5.0 wt %, this band blue-shifted from 2070 cm−1 to 2080 cm−1 again, suggesting lower electronic density of Pt sites on 2.0 Sn-CeO2 and 5.0 Sn-CeO2.41, 42 These abovementioned results confirmed the presence of Pt species with rich electrons over 1.0 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2. It was in a good agreement with XPS results. A relationship between the wavenumbers of CO adsorption from CO-IR and the catalytic activity was established (Figure 6b). It indicates that the presence of Pt0 sites with rich electrons induced by Sn doping might contribute to the superiority of 1.0 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 in the selective conversion of propane and CO2.

Sn as dopant was introduced into CeO2 and might affect the structure and defect properties of CeO2 matrix. Thus, a series of characterizations were performed to investigate the structures of CeO2-based catalysts before and after Sn doping. From the XRD patterns of pristine CeO2, the diffraction peaks at 2θ=28.5°, 33.0°, 47.4°, 56.3° were corresponded to the planes (111), (200), (220) and (311) of CeO2 fluorite-type structure, respectively31, 43 (Figure S2). With Sn doping, no new diffraction peak and remarkable shift was observed, indicating that a low Sn doping amount made it highly dispersed into CeO2 matrix and exceeded the limit of XRD detection, which was consistent with the elemental mapping results.
Raman spectra showed two obvious bands located at 462 cm−1 and 595 cm−1 on CeO2 and 1.0 Sn-CeO2 (Figure 7), which were assigned to F2g vibration of CeO2 lattice and vibration associated with oxygen vacancies, respectively.44, 45 The ratio of peak intensity at 595 cm−1 to that at 462 cm−1 was calculated to evaluate the concentration of defects.44 It is 0.02 for pristine CeO2 and increases with Sn doping. It reached 0.44 when 5 wt % Sn was doped into ceria matrix, indicating the promotion of oxygen vacancies formation on CeO2 by Sn doping.

Optimization of Pt loading amounts of m Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2
Optimization of Pt loading amounts with 1.0 Sn-CeO2 as the support was performed and a series of Pt loading amounts including 0.1 wt %, 0.3 wt %, 0.5 wt %, 0.8 wt % and 1.0 wt % were investigated. These catalysts were applied in the CO2-ODHP reaction and the results are shown in Figure 8. With increasing the Pt loading amounts from 0.1 wt % to 0.8 wt %, the propane conversion increased from 15.1 % to 79.0 %. Continuing to increase it to 1.0 wt %, the propane conversion decreased to 52.0 % (Figure 8a). For m Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 catalysts, the CO2 conversion showed similar changing trend as propane conversion. Higher CO2 conversions than that of propane were observed, indicating the propane activation might be the determination step in the presence of enough oxygen vacancies on ceria-based supports (particularly 1.0 Sn-CeO2) for CO2 activation. Although a low Pt loading amount (particularly 0.1 wt % Pt) showed a negative effect on the conversion of propane, it exhibited a high propylene selectivity. It showed a 63.9 % propylene selectivity over 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 catalyst, which was higher than that that of other catalysts (<37 %) (Figure 8b and Table S1, entry 2).

From the products distribution after reaction for 200 min, it indicated that the propylene selectivity decreased from 62.2 % to 5.3 % with increasing the Pt loading amounts from 0.1 wt % to 0.5 wt %, which was accompanied by the generation of CO and CH4 as by-products via C−C bond cleavage. With increasing the Pt loading amount to 0.8 wt % and 1.0 wt %, the propylene selectivity was improved to 25.5 % and 50.1 %, respectively, with CO, CH4, and C2H6 as the by-products (Figure 9a). These results showed that 0.1 wt % of Pt loading amount was the optimal one when 1.0 Sn-CeO2 was applied as the support. For comparison, 0.1 Pt/CeO2 showed a comparable propane conversion (14.3 %), but a lower propylene selectivity (22.3 %) (Table S1, entry 3), suggesting the crucial role of moderate Sn doping. In addition, the poor activity of 1.0 Sn-CeO2 support verified the critical role of Pt species, which acts as active sites for dehydrogenation (Table S1, entry 4). Furthermore, considering the high price of noble metal Pt, relative catalytic performance (mol/mol) was calculated based on the Pt loading amounts to evaluate the utilization of Pt sites (Figure 9b and Figure S3). It was estimated to be 0.55 mol/mol on 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2, which was much higher than that on the other m Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 catalysts (0.05∼0.30 mol/mol). These results revealed that 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 could act as efficient catalyst in the selective conversion of propane and CO2 to propylene.

The elemental mapping results were shown in Figure 10. The Pt species dispersed uniformly when Pt loading amount was lower than 0.5 wt %. Increasing the Pt loading to 1.0 wt %, Pt clusters were observed, indicating the aggregation of Pt species during the reduction. It might be the reason why the propane/CO2 conversion decreased when the ceria-based catalysts with a high loading amount of Pt species.

Effect of Sn doping on the activation of C3H8 and CO2
To better understand the effect of Sn during CO2-ODHP, the adsorption of propane on the optimized catalyst 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 along with the control catalyst were tracked by in situ FTIR spectroscopy (Figure 11). From the in situ IR spectra of both 0.1 Pt/CeO2 and 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2, two regions located at 2870–2965 cm−1 and 1300–1450 cm−1 were observed, which could be assigned to the vibration of C−H bond of the adsorbed propane on the surface.46-48 With propane desorption, the intensity of these bands decreased and completely disappeared after 30 min of desorption on 0.1 Pt/CeO2. In contrast, they were still observed on 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2, suggesting a stronger adsorption of propane on Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 than that on 0.1 Pt/CeO2.

Then the in situ Diffuse Reflectance FTIR was applied to track the propane desorption at various temperatures ranging from 150 °C to 350 °C after propane adsorption at room temperature (Figure 12). The signal associated with adsorbed propane (2965 cm−1) over 0.1 Pt/CeO2 disappeared completely after desorption at 350 °C, while it was still maintained over 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 confirmed the stronger interaction of propane and 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2. In addition, the intensity of the peak associated with the adsorbed propane on 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 was significantly higher than that on 0.1 Pt/CeO2 under the same conditions, indicating the strong adsorption of propane over the Sn modified catalysts. It was also confirmed by the C3H8-TPD, where the peak area of desorbed propane from 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 was significantly increased compared with that on 0.1 Pt/CeO2 (Figure S4). These results confirmed that the Pt species with rich electrons induced by Sn doping could enhance the adsorption of propane and contribute to the activation of propane.

Before the detection, these samples were reduced at 450 °C for 1 h in H2 (25 mL/min).
The promotion effect of Sn doping on propane activation was also verified by the direct dehydrogenation of propane (Figure S5). The propane conversion on 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 achieved 19 %, which was higher than that on 0.1 Pt/CeO2 (8 %) with a similar propylene selectivity (∼80 %) for both catalysts. It revealed that enhancement of propane adsorption on 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 might contribute to the superior catalytic activity in the activation of C−H bonds of propane.
H2-TPR was conducted to evaluate the donating oxygen abilities of 0.1 Pt/CeO2 and 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2, which was crucial for the redox process involved in the CO2-ODHP reaction (Figure 13). Two reduction peaks located at 478 °C and 792 °C were observed on pristine CeO2, which could be attributed to the reduction of surface oxygen and bulk oxygen, respectively.33, 34 After Sn doping, the reduction peak assigned to bulk oxygen showed no obvious change, however, the reduction peak assigned to the surface oxygen shifted to a lower temperature (348 °C). It was concluded that the introduction of Sn dopant probably led to the formation of SnCe solid solution and activated the surface oxygen of CeO2-based support, resulting in lowering the reduction temperature.49 It was also in a good agreement with our previous work.30 The impregnation of Pt sites on 1.0 Sn-CeO2 further decreased the reduction temperature of surface oxygen to 223 °C. It might result from the hydrogen spillover between noble metals and reducible metal oxide supports.50, 51 For comparison, 0.1 Pt/CeO2 catalyst also showed a shift of reduction peak to lower temperature (from 478 °C to 299 °C) after supporting Pt sites, but it was still much higher than that on 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2. These results revealed the excellent oxygen releasing capability of 1.0 Sn-CeO2 support after supporting 0.1 wt % Pt sites. The excellent capability of 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 for donating oxygen would promote the formation of oxygen vacancies and make a superiority in a redox process, which was involved in the catalytic CO2-ODHP reaction.

The donating oxygen abilities facilitated the formation of oxygen vacancies on defective CeO2, which generally acted as active sites for CO2 dissociation. The dissociation of CO2 on defective CeO2-based catalysts would release CO and active oxygen. Here, CO2-TPO was conducted to detect the generation of CO via CO2 dissociation on CeO2, 1.0 Sn-CeO2, 0.1 Pt/CeO2, and 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 after reduction (Figure 14). For pristine CeO2, CO was released at around 434 °C, while it decreased to 412 °C on 1.0 Sn-CeO2, indicating that Sn doping showed a positive effect on CO2 dissociation. It further decreased to 317 °C on 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2, revealing that the oxygen vacancies on defective CeO2 could be replenished by CO2 dissociation and this process proceeds easier on 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2 than that on CeO2 and 1.0 Sn-CeO2 as well as 0.1 Pt/CeO2. In addition, it was noteworthy that the intensity of CO signal (m/z=28) decreased remarkably after the introduction of Pt sites. It suggested that the electron-rich Pt sites were likely anchored on defect sites of Sn-CeO2 support, partially blocking the CO2 dissociation. This phenomenon was also observed on CeO2 support before and after supporting Pt (Figure 14b and 14d).

Proposed reaction mechanism
Finally, the reaction between propane and CO2 was tracked by in situ IR spectroscopy under reaction conditions (Figure 15). After the activation of propane on 0.1 Pt/1.0 Sn-CeO2, which was verified by the presence of bands at 2870–2965 cm−1 and 1300–1450 cm−1, CO2 was introduced to the reaction system (Figure 15a). The bands located at 2121 cm−1 and 2174 cm−1 were observed, which could be assigned to the vibration of the released gaseous CO, while another band at around 3600 cm−1 was assigned to hydroxyl group (−OH)36, 43, 44 (Figure 15b–c). During the reaction, the signals attributed to adsorbed propane decreased and then disappeared completely. Meanwhile, the bands associated with −OH and CO increased initially and then decreased with the conversion of propane (Figure 15d). This result suggested that a MvK reaction mechanism was probably involved.

On the basis of in situ IR results, a MvK reaction mechanism was proposed as follows: 1) Propane strongly adsorbed on electron-rich Pt species to release active hydrogen and adsorbed propylene, and the generated active hydrogen transferred to ceria-based support surface via hydrogen spillover, generating hydroxyl group; 2) Sn-CeO2 support donated surface oxygen to promote the surface species desorption as water and propylene, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies simultaneously; 3) CO2 was dissociated on the oxygen vacancies, generating adsorbed CO and active oxygen species, subsequently replenishing these oxygen vacancies; 4) The generated CO was released and the catalysts returned to the initial states for the next catalytic cycle (Scheme 2).

Proposed reaction mechanism of CO2-ODHP over Pt/Sn-CeO2.
Conclusion
In summary, Sn doped CeO2 supported Pt catalyst was successfully prepared and applied in the CO2-ODHP. It showed a superiority in the selective production of propylene with a 63.9 % selectivity under optimal conditions. A combination of XRD, Raman, H2-TPR, CO2-TPD, CO-IR, and in situ IR studies suggested that Sn doping played an essential role in the selective production of propylene. The Sn doping could not only improve the electronic density of Pt species, promoting the propane adsorption and C−H bond cleavage, but also enhance the capability of releasing oxygen, contributing to the dissociation of CO2. The evolution of propane and CO2 during the reaction was tracked by in situ IR which implied a MvK reaction mechanism. This work not only developed an efficient catalyst for the selective conversion of CO2 and propane to value-added chemicals, but also provided a comprehensive understanding of the metal doping effects in the catalytic reactions.
Experimental Section
Preparation of catalysts
Pristine CeO2 was prepared by the precipitation method, which was according to the process reported previously.31 Sn doped CeO2 (Sn-CeO2) was prepared by co-precipitation.32, 33 Typically, a certain amount of SnCl4 ⋅ 5H2O and Ce (NO3)3 ⋅ 6 H2O were dissolved in 100 mL of water, respectively. 50 mL of ammonia (25 vol %) was added into 50 mL of water to get a solution as the precipitating agent. These three solutions of SnCl4, Ce(NO3)3, and ammonia were added into a big beaker drop by drop under stirring at room temperature. The generated mixture was filtered and dried at 100 °C overnight. At last, a Sn-CeO2 support was obtained after calcination it at 500 °C for 4 h in a muffle furnace. Pt metal was introduced into CeO2 or Sn-CeO2 support by wet impregnation method. Typically, a certain volume of H2PtCl6 solution (7.692 mM) was dispersed in 10 mL of water, and then 5 g of CeO2 or Sn-CeO2 support was added into the H2PtCl6 solution under stirring. After stirring for 4 h, the mixture was evaporated at 100 °C on a hotplate. At last, CeO2 or Sn-CeO2 supported Pt catalysts (denoted as Pt/ CeO2 or Pt/Sn-CeO2) were obtained by calcination at 550 °C in air for 1 h. The Pt/Sn-CeO2 with various Pt and Sn amounts are denoted as m Pt/n Sn-CeO2, where m, and n represent the percentage loading amount for corresponding metal species.
Characterizations of catalysts
H2-TPR was conducted on a home-built catalyst characterization system with a mass detector at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with a flow of H2 (10 %)/ Ar. Before the H2-TPR detection, the samples were pretreated in Ar (50 mL min−1) at 550 °C for 1 h. CO2-TPO was conducted on an Automated Chemisorption Analyzer (Autochem II 2920, Micromeritics, USA). Before the detection, the catalysts were activated by reduction in H2 (10 mL/min) at 450 °C for 30 min. After the reduction, the catalysts were cooled down to room temperature. Then, CO2 was introduced into the system with a 10 mL/min of feeding speed. The generation of CO (m/z=28) was detected by an online- mass spectrometer. The signal of CO2 (m/z=44) was also tracked to exclude the CO signal derived from the dissociation of CO2 itself during the ionization in MS. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a Thermofisher Escalab 250 Xi+ (Thermo, USA), equipped with an Al-Kα (1486.6 eV) as the exciting source.
CO-IR spectra were collected from an infrared spectrometer (Tensor 27, Bruker, Germany). The sample was pressed into a self-supporting disk (13 mm in diameter) and placed in a quartz IR cell. Before CO adsorption, the disk was reduced by H2 (10 mL/min) at 450 °C for 30 min, and then cooled to room temperature. Then the CO gas was introduced into the sample disk, and maintained for 30 min. The IR spectra of the CO adsorption were recorded after evacuation at room temperature for 30 min. It recorded by 32 scans for per IR spectrum. The in situ IR of propane adsorption or step adsorption of propane and CO2 were conducted at the reaction temperature (550 °C) for tracking the propane activation and the reaction between CO2 and propane. Prior to adsorption, the sample disk was also activated by reduction in H2 (10 mL/min) at 450 °C for 30 min. Then the propane (2.4 ml/min) or/and CO2 (4.8 mL/min) were introduced into the system. After adsorption or reaction for 30 min, the corresponding spectra were recorded.
Evaluation of catalytic performances
The catalytic CO2-ODHP was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor equipped with a vertical quartz tube. 1.0 g of powder catalyst was pressed into pellets and crushed to 40–60 mesh particles. Then they were loaded into the quartz tube and fixed with quartz wools. Before the reaction, the catalyst was activated by reduction in H2/N2 (10 mL/min, and 10 mL/min, respectively) at 450 °C for 1 h. After the reduction, the H2 was shut down and the temperature was increased to 550 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C/min with a flow of N2 (10 mL/min).Then, propane and CO2 were introduced into the reaction system with a feeding speed of 2.4 mL/min and 4.8 mL/min, respectively. N2 was applied as the carrier gas (10 mL min−1). The total gas flow rate is estimated to be 17.2 mL min−1. Due to the small volume of catalyst loaded (<0.5 mL) and reaction temperature difference, the mass and heat transport limitation was not considered in this work. The reaction was conducted at 550 °C except additional instruction. On-line gas chromatography (GC) equipped with TCD and FID detectors was used to analyze the products, including CO, CH4, and C2-C3 hydrocarbons as well as unreacted propane and CO2. The conversion and selectivity were calculated by the normalization method. The conversion [Equations (1–2)], and selectivity [Equations (3–7)] were defined as follows:34
Where, F(C3H8)in is the flow of propane into the reactor; F(C3H8)out is the flow of propane out of the reactor; F(CO2)in is the flow of CO2 into the reactor; F(CO2)out is the flow of CO2 out of the reactor; the CO selectivity here was defined to estimate the proceeding of dry reforming reaction; it was noteworthy that when the CO selectivity was calculated, the CO generated via CO2-ODHP has been deducted. F(CO)out,1 is the flow of carbon in all CO out of reactor; F(CO)out,2 is the flow of carbon in CO out of reactor via CO2-ODHP which calculated based on the flow of propylene; F(CH4)out, F(C2H4)out, or F(C2H6)out is the flow of carbon in CH4, C2H4, C2H6 out of reactor, respectively; F(C1–C3 products)out is the flow of all carbon from products out of reactor.
