 Unfortunately there are no details about a specific catalyst composition or preparation method provided in the document. The document appears to be focused on modeling propane dehydrogenation kinetics and evaluating different kinetic models against experimental data. No specific catalyst details are provided beyond mentioning the use of a commercial Pt-Sn based catalyst from a confidential supplier. Without any catalyst details or composition information provided, I am unable to extract the requested information about catalyst type, composition, structure, enhancement details etc.
