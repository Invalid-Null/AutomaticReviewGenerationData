The provided document does not appear to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on the plasma-catalytic conversion of CO2 and CH4 into higher value products like syngas, C2+ hydrocarbons and C1+ oxygenates. While it does discuss catalysts and conversion processes, propane is not mentioned as a reactant. Therefore, I do not believe this document pertains specifically to PDH or ODH processes for converting propane to propylene.
