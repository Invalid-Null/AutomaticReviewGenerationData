The document discusses oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH), but does not present a specific catalyst that represents a main scientific contribution. The document provides a computational study on tuning the conjugation between carbon nanotube (CNT) Ï€ orbitals and oxygen functional groups to optimize CNT catalyst performance for ODH of propane. However, it does not report performance results for a specific CNT catalyst.
