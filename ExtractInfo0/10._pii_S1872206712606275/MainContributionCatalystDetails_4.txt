The provided document discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene using carbon nanotube (CNT) catalysts. It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) without the presence of an oxidant. Since the document focuses on ODH and not PDH, I have indicated that it is not relevant.
