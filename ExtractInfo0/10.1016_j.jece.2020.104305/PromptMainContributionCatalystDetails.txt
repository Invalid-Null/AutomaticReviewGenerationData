1. Introduction
Nanotechnology covers the synthesis of nanomaterials and its wide applications in catalysis, sensing, optical electronics and information storage [[1], [2], [3]]. The nanoparticles were synthesized by physical, chemical and biological method. Due to its small size, shape and distribution, it exhibits unique properties compared with their bulk form [4,5]. NPs synthesized by physical methods including ball milling require expensive procedures and it also leads to the loss of substrates [3]. The NPs synthesis by chemical reduction method was found to be less expensive than physical method [6].
The environmental pollution has been increasing in last few decades, among which the contamination of heavy metal in water bodies are quite high which causes hazardous effect to the living organisms [7,8]. The environmental mercury contamination mostly arises from industrial waste, land mining, smelting and fossil fuel refining [9]. Mercury occur in three different forms depending upon the environment as Hg° (vapor), Hg+ (mercurous ion), Hg2+ (mercuric ion) and methyl mercury [10]. Mercury can cause tumor, neural disorder and epithermal tissue damage [11,12]. The environmental Hg accumulation contributes 15 % in terrestrial environment, 80 % as mercuric vapor and 5 % in the water bodies [13]. HGASS, ETAAS, HGAFS, CVASS, CVAFS, AFS and AAS are the methods currently used for the estimation of mercury [14,15]. The available instrument for the quantification of Hg2+ is found to be expensive and it is difficult to apply in rural area for on-site detection. The mercury in the drinking water causes DNA damage and it affects cell division [16,17]. Mercury present in the water can cause nervous disorder, kidney damage and damage to the epithermal cells [18]. The minimum amount of mercury present in the drinking water by USEPA was 0.002 mg/L [19]. Few researchers used gold nanoparticle (Au NPs) as a nanosensor for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of mercury present in the water sample [20,21] and this method was found to be expensive.
Organic dye effluent released from the textile industry causes major water pollution, which is hazardous to the living organism present in the water bodies [22,23]. The azo dyes can causes damage in brain, muscle tissues, lung, kidney, spleen and heart [24]. The azo dye also causes biological oxygen demand in environmental water and it will prevent the light to pass through the water [24]. The treatments of organic dye bearing effluents include UV radiation technology and hydrogen peroxide methods were not effective to remove the dyes [24,25].MB is the standard International Standard Organization (ISO) test contaminant used for photocatalysis both under UV and visible light [26]. Silver nanoparticles exhibits excellent surface plasma resonance, fascinating electrical properties and the free radicals generation which helps the degradation of dyes [27]. Recent research on bimetallic nanocomposite reveals that the particle showed effective photocatalytic and enhanced antimicrobial activity [28,29].
Here, Ag-Fe nanocomposite probe was fabricated for the quantification of mercury from aqueous samples and for on-site detection. Additionally, the photocatalytic and antimicrobial activities of the nanocomposite were also studied to understand its wide application in various sectors.
2. Material and method
2.1. Materials
AgNO3, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, K2CrO4, MgSO4·7H2O, FeSO4·7H2O, ZnSO4, CuSO4, C12H10O14Pb and CoCl2 was produces from Himedia Mumbai, India. 3-(Trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate was purchased from Sigma Aldrich, USA. Phenylalanine was purchased from SD fine Chem. Limited (Mumbai, India). Methylene blue, LB broth and agar-agar were procured from Himedia (Mumbai, India). E. coli (14,948) ATCC and B. subtilis (11,774) ATCC were used for the evaluation of antibacterial property of the particles.
2.2. Synthesis of Ag-Fe nanocomposite
The equal ratio of AgNO3 (1 mM) and FeSO4 (1 mM) solutions were mixed in a 250 mL conical flask. In an another beaker, 2 mL of 3-(Trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate (0.1 %) was mixed with 30 mL of sodium borohydride solution (2 mM) and stirred for 5 min. Thereafter, 20 mL of AgNO3 and FeSO4 mixture was added drop wise to the above mixture. The formation of yellowish brown indicates the formation of Ag-Fe nanocomposite [30].
2.3. Characterization of Ag-Fe NPs
The absorption spectra of Ag-Fe nanocomposite was recorded using UV–vis absorption spectrophotometer (Systronics, India). Transmission electron microscope (Jeol/JEM 2100, Japan) was used to understand the morphology of Ag-Fe nanocomposite. The EDS analysis was used for the elemental analysis of prepared particles. The X-Ray diffraction pattern of prepared particle was recorded using BRUKER using Cu K radiation as X-ray diffractor. Particles size analyzer (Malvern, UK) was employed to understand the polydispersity and hydrodynamic size distribution of the particles. The surface charge of Ag-Fe nanocomposite was determined by using zeta sizer (Malvern, UK). Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) of Ag-Fe nanocomposite was performed to determine the loading of TMPM with Ag-Fe nanocomposite (Netzsch STA 2005, Inida). The surface area of Ag-Fe nanocomposite was measured by using Smart Sorb 93 Single point (Smart Instruments Co. Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India). BET method is considered as a promising tool to evaluate the surface area of nanocomposite and the nitrogen adsorption-desorption studies were performed to understand the porosity of the materials.
2.4. Colorimetric detection of Hg2+
A novel colorimetric detection of mercury by Ag-Fe nanocomposite was studied by adding 1 mL different metal ions (Mg2+, K+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Na+, Cr3+, Ni2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Fe2+ and Ba2+) with 2.5 mL of Ag-Fe nanocomposite-glycine conjugate to determine the selectivity. Additionally, varying volume of Hg2+ (0.1–1 mL) was added with Ag-Fe nanocomposite-glycine conjugate and UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded from 200 to 700 nm. Different concentrations (1 nM to 1 mM) of Hg2+ were augmented with NPs in order to understand the wide sensing range. The presence of other metal ions in the analyte can influence the detection of Hg2+ and it was investigated by adding metal ions to a solution contain Hg2+ and the experiment was repeated as per the methodology described above. The zeta potential and particle size were also measured in each case.
2.5. Sensitivity of analytical process
To the Ag-Fe nanocomposite-glycine conjugate, varying Hg2+ concentrations from 10 to 50 nM was added separately to study the sensitivity towards Hg2+ detection. The practical applicability was tested with the flittered Noyyal river water, Karur, Tamil Nadu, India and the amount of Hg2+ was estimated using Ag-Fe nanocomposite. To determine the accuracy of the Hg2+ detection by the Ag-Fe nanocomposite-glycine conjugate, known concentrations of Hg2+ (15 nM, 35 nM and 150 nM) was added with various metal ions and it was tested along with unknown sample. AAS analysis was performed with unknown sample to compare the efficiency of detection. The mercury detection on different environmental conditions was performed by varying temperature (15–50 °C), pH (5–9) and saline concentrations (0.1 to 0.8 %) and the range was studied by previously reported on mercury detection [[30], [31], [32]].
2.6. Photocatalytic activity of Ag-Fe nanocomposite
Here, the photocatalytic effect of Ag-Fe nanocomposite was studied as follow. Aqueous solution of Ag-Fe nanocomposite of 3 mg L−1 was sonicated for 30 min. To the above solution 25 mg L−1 of Methylene blue (MB) dye was added and the get the overall solution volume was maintained to 20 mL. The reaction solution was irradiated under visible light source and the light sourced used in the study was tungsten lamp (500 W). Then 2 mL of sample was collected at every 20 min and the solution was examined by using UV–vis spectrophotometer at 670 nm. The amount of MB dye degradation was calculated by the Equ. 1
(1)
where A0 and At were the initial concentration and the concentration of MB at time t.
2.7. Antimicrobial activity of the Ag-Fe nanocomposite
The antimicrobial effect of the Ag-Fe nanocomposite was studied against Escherichia coli ATCC 14948 and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 11774. Briefly, the bacterial cultures were allowed to grow in nutrient broth for 18 h in an incubator shaker at 37 °C. Thereafter, the bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation. Then the cells were washed twice by using 0.75 mM saline solution and the bacterial cell number was adjusted to 1 × 10 8 cells per mL. The different concentrations of Ag-Fe nanocomposite such as 0.1, 10, 25 and 50 mgL−1 were interacted with E. coli and B. subtilis separately for 4 h. The number of cells present in the sample was determined after the interaction by dilution plate count method.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of Ag-Fe nanocomposite
The Ag-Fe nanocomposite showed the maximum absorption at 448 nm in UV–vis absorption spectra (Fig. 1a). The polydispersity nature and particle size distribution of Ag-Fe nanocomposite is shown in Fig. 1b. The hydrodynamic diameter of Ag-Fe nanocomposite was determined to be 18 ± 2 nm. Ag-Fe nanocomposite possess a surface charge of -34.17 ± 2.7 mV. The TEM image Ag-Fe nanocomposite is shown in Fig. 1c. The EDS analysis confirmed the presence of Ag and Fe (Fig. 1d). The ratio of the Ag to Fe in weight % was determined by EDS analysis, 61.98 % of Ag and 38.02 % of Fe used for the synthesis of Ag-Fe nanocomposite. The specific surface area of Ag-Fe nanocomposite was determined to be 15.31 m2 g−1. The pore diameter and pore volume of the prepared nanocomposite was determined to be 2.1 nm and 0.037 cm3 g−1 respectively. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the prepared particle is shown in Fig. 1e. The diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 38.14°, 44.33°, 64.46° and 77.42° were assigned to the Ag diffraction planes. During the synthesis, the reduction of Ag ions on Fe NPs via transmetallation or deposition reaction acts as a seed for further growth to form Ag masked Fe nanoparticles. The Fe peaks were not reflected probably as the result of Ag layer on Fe core which shows enhanced scattering from Ag [33,34]. When Fe core is covered by Ag, the peaks of heavier metals are only depicted in XRD [33]. The size of the nanocomposite was calculated by Scherrer equation [35] by XRD pattern and it was determined to be 19 nm. The XRD pattern confirms the crystalline nature and purity of the composite.

The TGA of 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate functionalized Ag-Fe nanocomposite was showed in the Fig. 1f. The first stage of degradation (evaporation of water molecules) takes placed from 96 °C to 110 °C [36]. The second stage of the degradation was observed at 320 °C–340 °C due to the degradation of the 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate which was caped with Ag-Fe nanocomposite. The amount of particle left after the degradation at 700 °C was 83.18 %. The amount of 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate loaded on to the Ag-Fe NPs was found to be 7.953 %.
3.2. Detection of Hg2+
Addition of Hg2+ ion solution to the Ag-Fe nanocomposite resulted in the disappearance of brownish yellow colour. Firdaus et al. [15] observed the disappearance of pale yellow colour after the addition of Hg2+ with unmodified Ag NPs. The Ag NPs stabilized with 5-sulfosalicylicacid was also showed similar colour change after Hg2+ addition [37]. Recent development including the application of vesicles for the detection of Hg2+ ion from environmental water were reported previously [38,39]. Application of silver nanoparticle (Ag NPs) in Hg2+ detection was reported previously [[40], [41], [42], [43]]. The effective detection was studied with different volume of Hg2+ and 1 mL of Hg2+ solution showed complete disappearance of nanocomposite colour and UV–vis absorption spectra (supplementary materials Fig. 1a & b).
The UV–vis absorption spectra of Ag-Fe nanocomposite-glycine conjugate was recorded after interaction with different Hg2+ concentrations (1 nM to 1 mM) and it is shown in supplementary materials Fig. 1c. The peak intensity of Ag-Fe nanocomposite decreased with increase in the concentration of Hg2+. The result was confirmed by the particle size and zeta potential measurement. The results indicated that the particle size increase corresponds to increase in concentration of Hg2+ ions and correspondingly the decrease in zeta potential of nanocomposite was noted (Supplementary materials Fig. 1d). After the interaction of Ag-Fe nanocomposite with glycine, the solution was centrifuged and the presence of glycine in the supernatant and pellet were estimated separately. The results showed that the amount of glycine present in the pellet was around 96 % and amount of glycine in the supernatant was found to be 3%, indicated the Ag Fe-glycine nanoconjugate formation.
3.3. Selectivity of Hg2+
The selectivity of prepared probe towards the detection of Hg2+ was studied and the result showed that only Hg2+ caused disappearance of UV–vis absorption spectra (Supplementary materials Fig. 2a). Supplementary materials Fig. 2b shows that Hg2+ added solution changed into colourless and all the other metal ions added solution showed negligible colour change. The results indicated the selectivity of prepared probe towards the detection of Hg2+. Fig. 2a represents UV–vis spectra and Fig. 2b represent the particle size and zeta potential of particles after Hg2+ with other metal ions exposure. The results show that the presence of these competitive metal ions did not interfere with the sensing ability of the probe. Here, the solution containing Hg2+ showed low absorbance than the other metal ion added solution. The aggregation of nanocomposite was supported with particle size and zeta potential measurement. Higher particle size and lower zeta potential was observed in the solution which was added with Hg2+ and there was not much change was observed in the absence of Hg2+ in solution (Supplementary material Fig. 3). The results showed that there is no prominent peak was observed in presence of mercury Hg2+ by Ag-Fe nanocomposite-glycine conjugate and it is selective to mercury.

3.4. Sensitivity towards Hg2+
Sensitive study of the mercury detection by Ag-Fe nanocomposite was performed with various concentration of Hg2+. The absorbance spectra of Ag-Fe nanocomposite with different concentrations of Hg2+ (10 nM to 50 nM) is shown in Fig. 3a. Here, decrease in absorbance with increase in concentrations of Hg2+ can be seen very clearly. A graph was plotted between the concentrations of Hg2+ and the absorbance of Ag-Fe nanocomposite at 448 nm (Fig. 3b). The unknown concentration of the mercury from the environmental water was estimated based on the linear graph plot. Ag NPs stabilized with starch was developed by Buduru et al. [44] and the quantification limit for mercury detection was from 20 to 200 mgL−1 in aqueous media. Table 1 shows the comparison of the present work on the detection of Hg2+ with published literature. Several studies were reported the limit of Hg2+ detection from 1 μM to 0.8 μM [[45], [46], [47], [48], [49]]. The synthesized Ag-Fe nanocomposite was found to be effective on Hg2+ detection at nano molar level. The limit of detection (LOD) of Hg2+ was calculated to be 1.84 nM. The amount of mercury estimated in the Noyyal river water sample by the probe was 113 ± 1.9 nM. The AAS analysis was performed to validate the result obtained from the probe and it was found to be almost same (Table 2). Additionally, the efficiency of mercury quantification in spiked samples was studied in presence of other metal ions and the result is shown in Table 2. The amount of mercury was estimated was almost similar to the spiked quantity.

3.5. Possible mechanism
The Supplementary material Fig. 4 shows the schematic representation of the detection process. TMPM form the surface interaction with Ag-Fe nanocomposite and due to the high surface charge variation. The TMPM and glycine forms hydrogen bonding and it form Ag-Fe-glycine conjugate. When Ag-Fe -glycine conjugated reacted with Hg2+ the changing in the colour to colouless, which is due to the formation of Ag-Hg-Fe amalgam. The zero valent Ag NPs possess a standard potential of 0.8 V and divalent mercury possess standard potential of 0.85 V [53]. The difference in the standard potential of silver and mercury leads to the formation of Hg0 and Ag+ due to redox reaction [53]. The Hg0 attached on the surface of the Ag-Fe nanocomposite causes the formation of the Ag-Hg-Fe amalgam; this causes the loss in the absorbance and decrease in the zeta potential and increase in the particle size [54,55,15].
3.6. Effect of environmental condition
The influence of temperature was studied by varying the temperature form 15–50 °C. The result showed that the effective temperature for the detection of Hg2+ was observed at 30 °C (Supplementary material Fig. 5a). Similar work was performed by using Au NPs and the effective detection was observed be at 30 °C [56]. The effect of pH for the detection was also investigated and at pH 5 the detection was found to be effective (Supplementary material Fig. 5b). The influence of pH on Hg2+ detection was studied by Su et al. [57] using thioctic acid functionalized Au NPs and at pH 5 the detection was found to be effective. The different NaCl concentrations (0.1 % to 0.8 %) was maintained to study the impact of salinity on Hg2+ detection and 0.2 % NaCl was found to facilitate the detection (Supplementary material Fig. 5c). Chen et al. [20] studied the influence of salinity on detection by using the Rhodanine stabilized Au NPs and 0.1 % NaCl facilitate the detection of Hg2+ effectively.
3.7. Photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic degradation of the MB dye by Ag-Fe nanocomposite was shown in the Fig. 4a&b. The absorption spectra of Ag-Fe nanocomposite and MB dye was gradually decreased with increasing in time. The half-life period of the Ag-Fe nanocomposite was calculated from the plot of C/C0 and 1- C/C0 against time and it is found to be 86 min. The photocatalytic property of Ag nanoflower was previously reported by Molina et al. [58] and they reported Ag nanoflower degraded azo dye under visible light irradiation. The % of degradation of MB dye by Ag-Fe nanocomposite was determined to be 82.3 %. The degradation of the MB dye by Ag-Fe nanocomposite might due to the production of reactive oxygen species [59]. Further, the ratio of Ag to Fe can have impact in the degradation efficiency which was studied by Shojaie et al. [34].

The possible mechanism for the photodegradation of MB by Ag-Fe nanocomposite is as follows. The band gap, the efficiency in separation of photogenerated holes and electrons in prepared particle and the oxidation potential of photogenerated holes determines the photodegradation efficiency of Ag-Fe nanocomposite [60]. When the particles were irradiated under visible light, the electrons move from valance band to the conduction band. Thereafter, superoxide radicals (O2−) was formed when, the electron reacts with O2, which is an electron acceptor. Thereafter, the holes react with water to forms OH- [60]. The MB degradation might be due to the primary oxidant hydroxyl radicals, formed due to the oxidation of adsorbed water molecules or adsorbed OH- [61].
Ag-Fe + hν → h+ + e−
H2O + h+ →OH + H+
O2 + e− → O2-
O2− + e- → HOO
e− + HOO + → H+H2O2
H2O2 + e− →OH + OH-
OH− + h+ →OH
MB + ·OH → CO2 + H2O
Linear relationship was obtained by plotting ln(Ct/C0) verses time and it is shown in the Fig. 4c. Here, the plot of ln(Ct/C0) verses time gave regression value of 0.9864 and degradation rate constant (k) was determined to be 1.52 × 10−3 min-1. The results show that the particle follows pseudo-first order kinetics [62]. Few studies were reported that the rate of reaction varied with reaction conditions [[63], [64], [65]]. The studies by Barghi et al. [64] revealed that an increase in the water content enhancing the catalytic activity of particles. The kinetic study of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over a vanadium-graphene catalyst was reported by Fattahi et al. [65] and they found that propane to air ratio was found to be a critical parameter for optimization of the reaction.
3.8. Antimicrobial activity of Ag-Fe nanocomposite
The antimicrobial activity of Ag-Fe nanocomposite was studied against E. coli and B. subtilis and the result is shown in Fig. 5. The % toxicity at different concentration of nanocomposite on E. coli was calculated to be 39, 59, 73, 90 and 98 % for 0.1, 1, 10, 25 and 50 mg/ L respectively and on B. subtilis it was calculated to be 27, 52, 70, 85 and 92 % respectively. Hassanien et al. [66] studied the antimicrobial activity of Ag-cellulose nanocomposite on E. coli and B. subtilis and they found that the particle exhibits substantial antimicrobial activity. In their study, the zone of inhibition was observed to be 9 mm and 13 mm for E. coli and B. subtilis respectively. The present study suggests that Ag-Fe nanocomposite can also be used as an efficient agent to inhibit the growth of E. coli and B. subtilis.
