Kinetic Isotopic Effects in Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane on Vanadium Oxide Catalysts
Abstract
Kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs) for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were measured on 10 wt% V2O5/ZrO2. Normal KIEs were obtained using CH3CH2CH3 and CD3CD2CD3 as reactants for primary dehydrogenation (2.8) and combustion (1.9) of propane and for secondary combustion of propene (2.6), suggesting that in all cases C–H bond dissociation is a kinetically relevant step. CH3CH2CH3 and CH3CD2CH3 reactants led to normal KIEs for dehydrogenation (2.7) and combustion (1.8) of propane, but to a very small KIE (1.1) for propene combustion. These results show that the methylene C–H bond is activated in the rate-determining steps for propane dehydrogenation and combustion reactions. The rate-determining step in secondary propene combustion involves the allylic C–H bond. In each reaction, the weakest C–H bond in the reactant is cleaved in the initial C–H bond activation step. The measured propane oxidative dehydrogenation KIEs are in agreement with theoretical estimates using a sequence of elementary steps, reaction rate expression, and transition state theory. The much smaller KIE for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (2.8) than the maximum KIE (6) expected for propane thermal dehydrogenation indicates the participation of lattice oxygen. The different KIE values for propane primary dehydrogenation and combustion suggest that these two reactions involve different lattice oxygen sites.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
