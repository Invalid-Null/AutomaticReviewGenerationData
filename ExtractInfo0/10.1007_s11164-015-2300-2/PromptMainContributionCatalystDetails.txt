Effect of oxychlorination treatment on the regeneration of Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation
Propane dehydrogenation and regeneration of Pt–Sn/θ-Al2O3 catalysts was evaluated with oxychlorination treatment. It was observed that the catalytic activity was not fully recovered after coke burning followed by hydrogen reduction process because of the unsatisfying recovery of Pt sintering. In this study, oxychlorination treatment was additionally employed between coke burning and hydrogen reduction. Oxychlorination used diluted HCl at the range of 625–7000 ppm. The best recovery of catalytic activity was achieved at the HCl concentration of 5000 ppm. The effective redispersion of Pt was also examined by CO chemisorption, XRD, XPS, CHSN analysis, and STEM.
Introduction
Propylene and ethylene are the most useful light olefins and they have been produced by traditional cracking of hydrocarbon feedstock, such as refinery naphtha, condensate-derived naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas, ethane, and propane. When propane is used as a feedstock, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) can produce propylene. Propane dehydrogenation reaction is shown in (Eq. 1) [1, 2].
$$ {\text{C}}_{3} {\text{H}}_{8} \leftrightarrow {\text{C}}_{3} {\text{H}}_{6} + {\text{H}}_{2} ,\quad\Delta H_{298}^{^\circ } = + 129\,{\text{kJ/mol}} $$ (1)
Since PDH is an endothermic reaction requiring higher temperature, noble metal or heavy metal catalysts are used to achieve economically attractive conversion. While PDH needs high reaction temperatures in the range of 500–700 °C, reaction pressures are not severe, but near atmospheric pressure. PDH at higher temperatures may increase the propylene yield, however, also leads to unfavorable side reactions and accelerates catalyst deactivation as well. It was known that dehydrogenation catalysts should be regenerated regularly [2, 3]. The regeneration process includes coke burning to remove the deposits blamed for catalytic deactivation and hydrogen reduction to redisperse sintered Pt (or Pt–Sn) particles in part. The sintering of Pt (or Pt–Sn) particles can gradually become worse because of the repeated use of dehydrogenation and coke burning [4]. Ideally, the catalyst used would restore the original activity and original selectivity through a well-chosen regeneration process. Among the various regeneration processes, it is noticeable that attractive restoration of catalytic activity and selectivity was achieved by either coke burning/oxychlorination or chloride addition/metals reduction [5].
Air has been often used as an oxygen source. Even a small amount of oxygen can be critical to trigger coke burning. Temperatures must be carefully maintained in order to prevent an uncontrollable exothermal reaction. If not, an exothermal reaction will result in serious damage to metal crystallites as well as catalyst support. Coke from dehydrogenation can be removed in a series of steps, where the temperature or oxygen concentration is increased until there is no trace of coke on the catalyst. It was reported that exothermic temperature was minimized by controlling oxygen contents and heater programs [4, 5]. In addition, even with controlled coke removal, the metal crystallites may become unavoidably sintered during regeneration processes. As metal crystallites become larger in diameter, the activity will be decreased. It was reported that metal redispersion can be affected by appropriate amounts of oxygen, chloride, temperature, and reaction time [4, 5]. It was also presented that oxychlorination induced the formation of oxychloridic platinum compounds and motivated the effective redispersion of platinum during the regeneration of naphtha reforming catalyst. Postulated was that the greater mobility of chlorinated metal species can induce the redispersion of Pt effectively [4, 5]. If this is true, redispersion can reduce the size of metal crystallites and also result in the overall increase of metal surface area. In general, naphtha reforming catalyst can be used after periodic regeneration by coke burning combined with oxychlorination. Nevertheless, there is no attempt to investigate the activity and the characterization of catalyst in detail when the oxychlorination option was used to catalyst regeneration for PDH reaction.
In this study, oxychlorination was proposed to increase the mobility of Pt on PDH catalyst. Proposed oxychlorination was performed by HCl addition diluted in purified air at 500 °C. After oxychlorination reaction, hydrogen reduction process was followed. Reduction temperature and reduction time were selectively conducted for economic purpose. Evidences of redispersion were verified by CO chemisorption, XRD, XPS, CHSN analysis, and STEM.
Experimental
Preparation of catalyst
Pt–Sn/θ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by two separate stages of impregnation method. The θ-alumina supports were prepared by temperature-programmed calcination of gamma-alumina pellets (provided by Axens) under air atmosphere. The temperatures were raised from 278 to 1273 K at a rate of 10 K/min and then held at 1273 K for 8 h. At first, a designated amount of Tin(II) chloride (SnCl2, Sigma-Aldrich, >98 %) was impregnated on the support, θ-Al2O3. Drying and calcination were performed at 120 °C for 12 h and 873 K for 3 h, respectively. Then, a counted amount of hydrogen hexachloroplatinate (IV) hydrate (H2PtCl6, Kojima Chemical Co., Ltd., >99 %) was consecutively deposited on Sn/θ-Al2O3. Another cycle of drying and calcination were carried out at 393 K for 12 h and 853 K for 3 h, respectively.
Catalytic activity measurements
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) of catalysts was attempted. For hydrogen reduction, the calcined catalysts were individually reduced in a pure hydrogen (99.99 %) flow (32 mL min−1). Reduction temperature was increased gradually from room temperature to 893 K (10 °C min−1). PDH reaction was performed in a fixed-bed quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure and 893 K for 5 h. After hydrogen reduction, C3H8:H2 feed gases with a molar ratio of 1:1 were introduced into the quartz reactor. Total gas flow rate was maintained at 64 mL min−1. The products and reactants were analyzed by an on-line GC (FID detector, Series M600D, Younglin Co.) equipped with a capillary column (GS-Alumina, Agilent Technologies, USA, i.d.: 0.53 mm, length: 50 m). Propane conversion, propylene selectivity and propylene yield were monitored and calculated by the following formulae:
$$ {\text{Propane}}\,{\text{conversion}}\,(\% ) = \left( {1 - \frac{{n\left( {{\text{C}}_{3} {\text{H}}_{8} } \right){\text{out}}}}{{n\left( {{\text{C}}_{3} {\text{H}}_{8} + {\text{C}}_{3} {\text{H}}_{6} + {\text{C}}_{2} {\text{H}}_{6} + {\text{C}}_{2} {\text{H}}_{4} + {\text{CH}}_{4} } \right){\text{out}}}} } \right) \times 100 $$
$$ {\text{Propylene }}\,{\text{selectivity}}\,(\% ) = \frac{{n\left( {{\text{C}}_{3} {\text{H}}_{6} } \right){\text{out}}}}{{n\left( {{\text{C}}_{3} {\text{H}}_{6} + {\text{C}}_{2} {\text{H}}_{6} + {\text{C}}_{2} {\text{H}}_{4} + {\text{CH}}_{4} } \right){\text{out}}}} \times 100 $$
$$ {\text{Propylene}}\,{\text{yield}}\,(\% ) = \frac{{{\text{Propane}}\;{\text{conversion}} \times {\text{Propylene}}\;{\text{selectivity}}}}{100} $$
where, n(C3H8)out is the moles of propane from outlet, and n(CH4), n(C2H6), n(C2H4), and n(C3H6) is the moles of methane, ethane, ethene, and propene from outlet, respectively.
After first-run PDH, the used catalyst was regenerated and evaluated again to determine if active catalyst was fully recovered. The regeneration process was composed of three serial steps: coke burning, oxychlorination, and hydrogen reduction. Table 1 summarizes the regeneration processes we examined. Coke burning was performed at 893 K for 3 h. The pressure was controlled at 1 atm and air flow was set to 60 mL/min. Oxychlorination was followed by coking process. Oxychlorination included the following steps; (a) heating in flowing air up to 823 K (b) feed of the chloriding mixture of hydrogen chloride (1 % HCl/99 % N2) with the air stream during 2 h at the same temperature, (c) termination of the chloriding mixture feed, and (d) purging by N2 flow for 30 min. The concentration of HCl was varied from 625 to 7000 ppm. The pressure was controlled to atmospheric pressure. The total gas flow was set to 360 mL/min and 2 g of catalyst were placed to the reactor. Hydrogen reduction of used catalyst was performed by the same procedure as mentioned above.

Catalyst characterization
The measurements of BET surface area and N2 adsorption–desorption were performed at 17 K using an automated gas sorption system (Belsorp II mini, BEL Japan, Inc.). The Barrett–Joyner–Halanda (BJH) method was used to obtain pore size distribution. CHNS analysis (Fisons EA1108) was carried out to determine the carbon contents accumulated on the catalyst surface during PDH reaction. In order to evaluate metal dispersion, CO chemisorption was performed with a pulse chemisorption mode (BELCAT, BEL Japan, Inc.). Prior to measurements, 0.05 g of a catalyst sample was thermally treated under a He stream at 773 K for 50 min to remove physically adsorbed water and other impurities. Catalyst sample was cooled down to room temperature and heated to 823 K with a heating rate of 10 K/min using pure H2 at a flow rate of 50 mL/min. The sample was then reduced in a pure H2 flow at 823 K for 2 h. After reduction, the sample was purged with helium (He) gas at the same temperature for 1 h. After cooling to 323 K, the 10 % CO/He (10 % v/v of CO diluted in He) gas was introduced for CO chemisorption. CO loop gas was used for each pulse, and the pulse injections were repeated until saturation. The amount of CO was measured using a thermal conductivity detector. The metal dispersion of each catalyst was then calculated from the amount of CO adsorbed, taking the stoichiometry factor (SF) as one for CO/Ptatm:
$$ {\text{Dispersion}}\;(\% ) = \frac{{100 \times V_{\text{S}} \times S_{\text{F}} \times M_{\text{W}} }}{{S_{\text{W}} \times F_{n} \times 22.414}} $$
where, V s is the cumulative volume of adsorbed CO (cm3 at STP), MW is the molecular weight of Pt metal (g mol−1), SW is the weight of the sample, and F n is the Pt fraction in relation to the total catalyst sample weight.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared Pt Sn/Al2O3 catalysts were recorded by a diffractometer (M/S, Shimadzu Instruments, Japan) with Ni-filtered Cu Kα (λ = 1.540,600 nm). The operating voltage was 40 kV, and the current was 40 mA, with a 2θ scanning rate of 3° min−1. XPS analyses were performed using an Ulvac-PHI spectrometer [PHI 5000 Versa Probe; Minimum X-ray beam size: ≤10_m, energy resolution: ≤0.50 eV, sensitivity: ≥1,000,000 CPS, scanning electron gun (AES/SEM) and UV light source] using a non-monochromatized Mg K_radiation (1253.6 eV). The vacuum in the analysis chamber was controlled to less than 1 × 10−7 Pa. The peaks of Pt and Sn were deconvoluted using a sum of Lorentzian–Gaussian functions. The high resolution TEM images of Pt and Sn nanoparticles were characterized by FEI (Technai F20 G2, The Netherland) microscopy working in a STEM mode (Accelerating voltage: 50–200 kV, Image resolution: <0.23 nm, Electro probe size: <0.3 nm, Magnification: 25–1,030,000×, Specimen double tilting: ±40°/±20°). The catalyst sample was prepared by dispersion and suspension in ethanol solution and ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. Consequently, the treated solution was deposited on copper grid coated with a carbon film, and evaporated. Finally, the sample containing copper grid was used for TEM and HRTEM/HAADF STEM analysis.
Results and discussion
Catalytic activity after regeneration: effect of oxychlorination conditions
Recall that the proposed regeneration of used catalysts includes three serial treatments: coke burning, oxychlorination, and hydrogen reduction. For the identification of catalysts, refer to Table 1. Propane conversions of catalysts were determined for 300 min and are presented in Fig. 1. The conversion of propane was evaluated in the presence of fresh catalyst (1Pt0.5Sn-C) at first and used as a reference value. The coke-burned catalyst (1Pt0.5Sn-B) led to much lower conversion values than 1Pt0.5Sn-C. This is not surprising because coke-burning can remove cokes; however, this may lead to unfavorable metal sintering. It was observed that sintered metal particulates were not redispersed effectively even though hydrogen reduction was employed, which will be discussed later. Oxychlorinarion was evaluated by increasing the amount of HCl. The concentration of HCl was varied from 625 to 7000 ppm. In case of 1Pt0.5Sn-OC625, propane conversion was not improved but lowered than 1Pt0.5Sn-B. The recovery of propane conversion was gradually improved when oxychlorination increases the amount of HCl from 2000 to 7000 ppm in this work. Return to Fig. 1, the initial conversion values of 1Pt0.5Sn-C, 1Pt0.5Sn-B, 1Pt0.5Sn-OC625, 1Pt0.5Sn-OC2000, 1Pt0.5Sn-OC3300, 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000, and 1Pt0.5Sn-OC7000 were 42.2, 35.9, 37.4, 40.9, 40.5, 41.7, and 41.0 %, respectively. And after 300 min of PDH reaction, the conversions were decreased to 33.9, 26.8, 24.8, 31.6, 32.3, 34.2, and 34.0 %, respectively. The highest conversion was obtained in the presence of 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000, which is as high as the conversion obtained by fresh catalyst (1Pt0.5Sn-C). In case of 1Pt0.5Sn-OC7000, the conversion values were more or less similar to 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000. In Fig. 2, selectivity data were presented. Highest selectivity was observed when 1Pt0.5Sn-C was used. Competitive data to 1Pt0.5Sn-C were obtained when 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 and 1Pt0.5Sn-OC7000 options were attempted. As similar to conversion results, less HCl concentration up to 3300 ppm did not show the full restoration of catalytic performance when compared to 1Pt0.5Sn-C.

Table 2 shows the initial and final conversion (X i and X f, measured at 20–300 min time on stream), selectivity, and yield. The deactivation parameters of monometallic and bimetallic catalysts are also represented in Table 2 (ΔX = 100 × (X i − X f)/X i, where X i is the initial and X f is the final conversion, respectively). The stability will be improved when ΔX values becomes lower. The trend of deactivation was same as shown in propane conversion in Fig. 1. It should be noted that the activity becomes stable as the concentration of HCl was increased. Characteristic trend of lower values in 1Pt0.5Sn-B and 1Pt0.5Sn-OC625 was also shown in selectivity and yield as well. Lower concentration of HCl during oxychlorination leads even worse than the regeneration option without oxychlorination. Gradual improvement of selectivity and yield were obtained in same manner when oxychlorination option increased the concentration of HCl from 2000 to 7000 ppm.

Characterization of catalysts
BET surface area and coke amount
Table 3 shows the pore characteristics of catalysts and the coke content formed during PDH reaction. Pore characteristics includes BET surface areas, pore volume, and average pore diameter. BET surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter of 1Pt0.5Sn-C catalyst were 77.575 m2 g−1, 0.3153 cm3 g−1, and 7.592 nm, respectively. The surface area of 1Pt0.5Sn-B catalyst was 89.363 m2 g−1, which is greater than that of 1Pt0.5Sn-C catalyst. In case of oxychlorination option was included in regeneration, surface areas were increased when compared with 1Pt0.5Sn-C. The pore volumes were more or less similar even oxychlorination option was included (0.3153–0.3405 cm3 g−1). In the case of pore diameters, there is no significant change between with and without oxychlorination. It is interesting that the 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 catalyst has a similar pore diameter to 1Pt 0.5Sn-C (7.614 vs. 7.592 nm). The regeneration of catalyst may restore the pore structures as well even a clue is not confirmed.

Full size table
The first run of PDH reaction, the coke was formed to 7.14 wt%. Coke burning decreased the coke amount down to 0.08 wt%. To see the effect of oxychlorination, coke contents were measured individually after PDH reaction. The coke content of 1Pt0.5Sn-OC2000, 1Pt0.5Sn-OC3300, 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000, and 1Pt0.5Sn-OC7000 was 6.54, 6.00, 5.91, and 4.98 wt%, respectively. Coke amount generated during PDH reaction was also decreased as oxychlorination option increased the concentration of HCl.
CO chemisorption
Table 4 shows the CO chemisorption data. Metal dispersion, metal surface area, and average particle size of Pt particles were presented. As a reference catalyst, 1Pt0.5Sn-C showed 12.6 % of metal dispersion, and 0.311 m2 g−1 cat−1 of metal surface area, and 9.0 nm of average particle size. After PDH reaction, 1Pt0.5Sn-C (used) had very low values in dispersion (0.63 %) and metal surface area (0.016 m2 g−1 cat−1), but very high value in average particle size (178.8 nm). This provides the clue that cokes may cover metal sites and block the pores, which eventually prevents CO from being adsorbed on Pt active sites. Coke burning helped the restoration of metal dispersion (2.14 %) and metal surface area (0.053 m2 g−1 cat−1), but these were only marginal. Unfavorable sintering of particle size was occurred by coke burning. The effect of oxychlorination are also presented in Table 4. Overall restoration of metal dispersion, surface area and particle size were achieved when oxychlorination was employed in regeneration process. It is noticeable that 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 had 13.23 % metal dispersion, 0.053 m2 g−1 cat−1 metal surface area, and also 8.6 nm average particle size. These values were even superior to 1Pt0.5Sn-C (fresh catalyst). In the case of 1Pt0.5Sn-OC7000, the effect of oxychlorination was not as high as 1Pt0.5Sn-C. Veldurthi et al. [7] reported that the improvement of catalytic activity was mainly related to the metal dispersion, metal surface area, and particle size of the catalysts. This supports why 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 showed the superior activity in PDH reaction to 1Pt0.5Sn-C (Ref. Fig. 1).

X-ray diffraction (XRD)
Crystallographic changes of catalysts without oxychlorination are presented in Fig. 3. XRD pattern of θ-Al2O3 was used as a reference in Fig. 3a. The 2θ values of θ-Al2O3 appeared at 31.5, 32. 8, 36.7, 38.9, 39.9, 44.9, 47.6, 50.7, 59.9, 62.3, 64.1, and 67.4. XRD peaks of 1Pt0.5Sn-C, 1Pt0.5Sn-C/reduced, and 1Pt0.5Sn-C/used looked almost identical to θ-Al2O3 and did not reveal any traces of Pt/PtO or Sn particles. We interpret that the sizes of Pt and Sn were too small to be detected by XRD measurement. This also provides evidence of high dispersion of Pt and Sn particles on the θ-Al2O3 support. Similar interpretation was shown elsewhere [8, 9]. After coke burning of 1Pt0.5Sn-C/used catalyst, the existence of Pt particles was detected by XRD patterns in both cases of 1Pt0.5Sn-B (Fig. 3e) and 1Pt0.5Sn-B/reduced (Fig. 3f). This can be implied that coke burning induced the larger size of Pt agglomerate by sintering.

In Fig. 4, XRD patterns were presented to show the effect of oxychlorination options. Recall that oxychlorination was followed by coke burning. Concentration of HCl during oxychlorination was varied from 2000 to 7000 ppm. The detection of Pt particles was observed clearly when oxychlorination was performed (Fig. 4a, c, e, g). The effect of Pt sintering still remained even when oxychlorination was additionally employed right after prior coke burning. However, the crystallography of catalysts was distinctively changed when hydrogen reduction was performed. The Pt peaks in XRD patterns disappeared (Fig. 4b, d, f, h). It can be interpreted by the redispersion of Pt agglomerates after hydrogen reduction was performed. This redispersion occurred only after three stages of coke burning, oxychlorination, and hydrogen reduction was applied. The result was confirmed by CO chemisorption in advance as shown in Table 4. In Fig. 4h, Pt3Sn phases were generated on 1Pt0.5SnOC7000 catalyst. The atomic composition of Pt3Sn alloy is often detected on bimetallic Pt–Sn catalysts although all types of Pt–Sn alloys are possible [10–14]. Even though there is no clue about how Pt3Sn alloy was formed during the regeneration of PtSn/θ-Al2O3, the mobility increases of both Pt and Sn may be destined by oxychlorination [19–22]. It is suspect that the formation of Pt3Sn may also induce the nanosize redispersion of sintered Pt agglomerates. In terms of catalytic activity, there are arguments about the superiority between PtSn and Pt3Sn [21, 22]. However, Pt3Sn showed the positive effect of catalytic activity during PDH reaction in this study.

X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS)
XPS was employed to examine the chemical shifts of Pt and Sn during the various regeneration options. Although the most intense photoemission lines of platinum were revealed from the Pt 4f levels, these energy regions were overshadowed by the presence of a very strong Al 2p peak in this case. Pt 4d lines were analyzed instead. In Fig. 5, there was an asymmetric broad of Pt 4d peak. It could be resolved after curve fitting procedures into two components with binding energies of 315.2 and 317.6 eV. The Pt 4d binding energy for Pt and PtO is usually reported in this region [15], respectively. The components at higher binding energies can be attributed to PtO species that created after calcination process, meanwhile the band at lower binding energies can be assigned to the presence of Pt species. The chemical changes in the platinum particles after reduction in H2 were also investigated by XPS. Figure 5a, b present the XPS of 1Pt0.5Sn-C (fresh catalyst) after calcination and additional reduction, respectively. In the cases of 1Pt0.5Sn-B and 1Pt0.5Sn-B/reduced, there was no significant traces of Pt4d peak (Fig. 5c, d). Later, the broad bands were reappeared after oxychlorination was applied, in both cases for 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 and 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000/reduced (Fig. 5e, f), which supports the implication that the platinum was redispersed. The binding energy of Pt 4d shifts to lower values as 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 catalyst was reduced.

In Fig. 6, XPS of Pt 4f shows the doublets corresponding to zero-valence of Pt. The peak separation of Pt 4f7/2 (ca. 71.3 eV) and Pt 4f5/2 (ca. 74.6 eV) was 3.3 eV and the area ratio of Pt 4f7/2 to Pt 4f5/2 was 1.33 as fitting procedures were presented in literature [16]. In Fig. 6b, the peak intensity of Pt 4f was increased after reduction, which was comparable to the peak intensity of Al 2p (dashed line). In Fig. 6f, the peak intensity of Pt 4f was also increased after reduction. Fig. 6c, d show no distinctive changes.

In Fig. 7, the Sn 3d peaks indicated at the region of 485–487 eV. It is reported that the peaks at 486.5 and 488.6 eV are designated to oxidized states of Sn (II, IV) and SnClx species bound to the support, respectively [17, 18]. The intensity of 486.5 eV was increased after hydrogen reduction of 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000. We suspect that Sn attached to Pt may migrate to the surface of θ-Al2O3, which results in the increase of SnClx/Al peak. This should be examined in future work.

HAADF STEM and corresponding EDS mapping
Returning to Fig. 4f, the XRD pattern of 1Pt 0.5Sn-OC5000/reduced catalyst did not show any metal or metal oxides peaks (Pt/PtOx or Sn/SnOx), but a sole θ-Al2O3 phase appeared. To identify the structures of Pt particles, 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 was characterized by FEI microscopy in STEM mode. Figure 8a, b shows typical high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF STEM) images and their corresponding EDS maps of two catalysts; 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 and 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000/reduced. In Fig. 8a, the distribution of Pt particles in 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000 shows the evidence of agglomeration caused by sintering. However, in Fig. 8b, the Pt particles of 1Pt0.5Sn-OC5000/reduced were distributed in fine scales, in other words nanoscales. This result is consistent with CO chemisorption results (shown in Table 4) and confirms that oxychlorination option regenerated the nanoscale dispersion of Pt again.

Conclusions
Bimetallic Pt–Sn catalysts were employed for propane dehydrogenation. It is well known that coke is easily formed as a reaction proceeds. In order to restore catalytic activity, coke burning is routinely used and followed by hydrogen reduction. However, coke burning also induces to Pt sintering. In this study, oxychlorination right after coke burning was included to aid the regeneration of bimetallic catalyst. Diluted HCl concentration was examined at a range of 625–7000 ppm. In terms of catalytic activity, oxychlorination clearly enhanced the catalytic activity to be as high as a fresh catalyst. Catalytic activity was the greatest when oxychlorination was performed at a HCl concentration of 5000 ppm. In other words, the full restoration of catalytic activity was achieved by three combined regeneration processes: coke burning, oxchlorination at 5000 ppm of HCl, followed by hydrogen reduction. We interpret that catalyst regeneration is mainly attributed to the successful redispersion of Pt. Evidence of effective redispersion was confirmed by CO adsorption, XRD, HAADF STEM, and EDS mapping. In addition, Pt3Sn was formed during oxychlorination followed by hydrogen reduction. The formation of Pt3Sn during the regeneration process resulted in positive restoration of catalytic activity as well as the nanosize redispersion of sintered Pt agglomerates.

    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
