Unveiling the catalyst deactivation mechanism in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes on Rh(111): Density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo study
Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (NOPDH) selectively converts propane to value-added propylene, and is therefore being evaluated as an industrial alternative to commercial propylene-production processes. Rh-based catalyst is being evaluated as a replacement for the state-of-the-art PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. Rh has a high catalytic activity for C-H bond dissociation, but low NOPDH selectivity due to the side reactions including cracking reactions and deep-dehydrogenation. The present study uses density functional theory (DFT) calculations in conjunction with kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations to identify the key descriptors of NOPDH selectivity and mechanisms by which the Rh(111) surface can be deactivated. Ab-initio kMC simulations allow quantitative analysis of kinetic parameters in the operating conditions while explicitly considering lateral interactions, which cannot be done using only periodic DFT calculations. The kMC simulations consider all reaction elementary steps rigorously, so the overall reaction can be represented explicitly. Our theoretical analysis of the Rh(111) system suggests the deactivation mechanism and will provide design principles to achieve a highly active and selective Rh catalyst for NOPDH.
1. Introduction
Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (NOPDH) is a way to convert inexpensive and abundant propane to value-added propylene [1]. The commercial Oleflex NOPDH process uses PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst [2], but it is endothermic and conducted at high temperature in a reductive environment, and these conditions can readily deactivate the catalyst by cracking and deep-dehydrogenation. Catalyst deactivation by coke formation and sintering remain great challenges for NOPDH. To overcome this issue, the development of highly selective and active NOPDH catalysts has been a major focus of research to reduce the cost of propylene production [3], [4]. Many studies that combined experiment and theory have been conducted to increase understanding of the complex process of propane dehydrogenation on Pt catalysts [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].
Density functional theory (DFT) has been used extensively to study the reaction mechanism of NOPDH theoretically, and to obtain key descriptors that can be used to guide design of novel transition-metal catalysts. The activity descriptor has been identified as the first dehydrogenation step, whereas the selectivity is determined by the energy difference between thermodynamic propylene desorption and the kinetic barrier of deep-dehydrogenation [10]. These straightforward descriptors have been applied to screen potential materials. For example, Gong and coworkers examined 3:1 ratio of Pt alloys using periodic DFT calculations in conjunction with micro-kinetic modeling (MKM). Among the alloy combinations investigated, Pt3In alloy showed the best performance, exhibiting a good balance of activity and selectivity measured by the each descriptor score [11]. Miller, Greeley, and co-workers provided insights into structural effect and electronic structures of Pd-based alloy surfaces, and used the accurate MKM to suggest a new selectivity descriptor [12], [13]. High-throughput DFT calculations in conjunction with MKM have been widely used to identify highly active and selective noble-metal-free catalysts, then validated their evaluations experimentally [14], [15], [16], [17].
While the aforementioned pioneering computational and experimental studies have provided the important insights on NOPDH that uses Pt or Pd catalyst [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [18], [19], [20], [21], Rh-based catalyst has not yet been unveiled despite its high C-H activation demonstrated by experimental evidences [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Recent studies on NOPDH demonstrated that Rh-based catalysts have high activity for NOPDH and moderate selectivity, which are comparable to the state-of-the-art Pt catalyst. Rh atoms dispersed in Cu have high C-H activation ability and propane-production rate that is superior to that of Pt/Al2O3, and achieve 100% propylene selectivity [24]. Jung and coworkers found that adding Sn to the Rh increases the selectivity and activity to as high as state-of-the-art PtSn alloys; the optimal ratio of Sn in RhSn alloy may be different from the one in PtSn [25]. However, high NOPDH efficiency of Rh-based catalysts has not been achieved, partly due to a lack of understanding of the complex NOPDH reaction network at the atomic scale.
Furthermore, reaction conditions, lateral interactions and resulting spatial inhomogeneity cannot be adequately evaluated if the surface coverages of reaction intermediates are not considered [14], [15], [16], [27]. Yang and coworkers have provided insight into the importance of surface coverages of reaction intermediates in various reactions on metal surfaces by considering the coverages in MKM [28], [29], [30]. Combining the coverage-dependent DFT calculations and MKM using their iterative algorithm, they identified the most probable mechanisms of the methanol synthesis under reaction conditions, which showed strong consistency with reported experiments. Although both kMC and MKM provide similar quantitative macroscopic insights in realistic systems, we chose kMC because it explicitly considers dynamic spatial inhomogeneity of the system whereas MKM relies on the mean-field approximation [31]. kMC simulations of NOPDH on Pt(111) suggested plausible NOPDH mechanisms and deactivation scenarios [32], and have revealed the origin of the high catalytic activity of a Pt/Cu single-atom alloy (111) surface [33].
In this study, DFT calculations are used in conjunction with kMC simulations to acquire a thorough understanding of the NOPDH reaction under the operating conditions, and to make unbiased predictions about NOPDH activity and selectivity on Rh(111) (Fig. 1). Examination of possible elementary reaction steps of dehydrogenation and cracking on Rh under realistic NOPDH conditions revealed several selectivity-limiting steps and deactivation mechanisms. This understanding of the molecular mechanism of NOPDH on Rh(111) will provide design principles to achieve Rh catalysts that have high selectivity and activity for NOPDH.

2. Methods
2.1. DFT
The Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) was used for all DFT calculations [34]. The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method was employed for electron-ion interactions [35]. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was used for the exchange-correlation function [36]. The zero damping DFT-D3 method was used to accurately describe van der Waals interactions [37]. Convergence criterion was 2 × 10-4 eV/atom for energy and 0.03 eV/Å for force convergence. Bulk configurations were optimized with a volume-relaxing condition with an energy cut-off of 520 eV. A 10 × 10 × 10 Monkhorst–Pack (MP) k-point meshes were chosen to sample the Brillouin zone.
The Rh(111) surface was modeled using a 3 × 3 hexagonal supercell with four-layer slab with its bottom two layers fixed, and vacuum layers > 15 Å were applied. For geometry optimizations, energy cut-off was set to 400 eV and the k-points were set to 3 × 3 × 1 MP. The simulations searched for the most stable configurations of the adsorption sites of intermediates (Fig. S5). To calculate the gas-phase molecules, a box of 15 × 15 × 15 Å was used considering the gamma point of the k-space. Transition states (TS) of all reaction pathways were sought using the climbing nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method [38], [39]. The vibrational frequencies of TS structures were analyzed to ensure that each of the TS states has only one imaginary frequency; this condition is one evidence of the rigorousness of the NEB calculations [40]. All calculated energies of adsorption and transition states are corrected by zero-point energy calculations using harmonic oscillator approximations.
2.2. kMC
Graph-theoretical kMC simulations were performed using Zacros software [31], [41], [42]. The Rh(111) surface was modeled as a 2D 10 × 10 supercell composed of two types of active sites per a unit cell, which correspond to top and face-centered cubic (fcc) sites, for a total of 400 (2 × 2 × 10 × 10) active sites (Fig. 4). A 2D 20 × 20 supercell was also modeled to verify that the kMC simulation results are not dependent on the lattice size or random seed. The reactants are considered as an ideal mixture of propane and hydrogen gases.
The cluster expansion algorithms provided in Zacros software consider the noticeable interactions between an adsorbate and the first nearby co-adsorbed species [42], [43]. For the computationally efficient description of lateral interactions between the co-adsorbed species, only first-nearest-neighbor two-body interactions were considered. Overall, the cluster expansion model considers 44 pairwise interactions consisting of 25 carbon-hydrogen pair and 19 carbon-carbon pair. (Table S4).
The NOPDH reaction mechanisms entailed 112 elementary steps including gas adsorption/desorption, and 51 reversible surface reactions. All 34 reaction intermediates were considered as either mono-dentate or bi-dentate according to the adsorption configurations (Fig. S5). The reaction conditions to match conditions used in industry were temperature 873 K, pressure 1 bar, and propane and hydrogen-cofeeding ratio 1:1.
All elementary reaction prefactors were determined using vibrational partition function, in the same manner as in previous kMC studies [32], [33], [44], [45]. The cutoff value was set to 100 cm-1 so that only high-frequency vibrational modes were included in computations of vibrational partition function; consequently, the degree of freedom of nuclear motions frequency smaller than 100 cm-1 is ignored. This decision was made because harmonic approximations often fails to compute low-frequency modes of vibrational motions, and such errors can significantly affect calculated reaction rates [40]. The prefactors for gas adsorption and desorption were extracted from previous work [33]. The calculated reaction rates vary consistently compared to previous studies, which differ by negligible orders of magnitude [32], [33], [44]. Turn-over frequency (TOF) was measured as the number of propylene molecules per area and time, whereas selectivity was determined by production rates of each gas [12], [46].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. DFT calculations
3.1.1. Binding strength of reactants and products on Rh(111)
First, the adsorption trends of gas-phase reactants and products were explored under 1/9 ML coverage, considering the dispersion correction by DFT-D3 method. Light alkanes were generally physisorbed on the metal catalyst surface, whereas alkenes and alkynes were chemisorbed on the surface; these results agree with previous studies [32], [33]. In accordance to general trend, the binding energies of fully-saturated hydrocarbons - propane, ethane and methane - on Rh(111) were − 0.70, − 0.22 and − 0.28 eV, respectively (Table 1, Fig. S5). This propane binding energy is much stronger than previously reported adsorption strengths of − 0.31 eV on Pt(111) and − 0.25 eV on Pt/Cu SAA(111); this difference could imply that NOPDH will be initiated faster by Rh(111) than by Pt(111) or Pt/Cu SAA(111) [32], [33]. In contrast, NOPDH gas-phase products such as propylene, propyne, ethylene and ethyne are strongly chemisorbed on the surfaces, and this could retard the desorption of those species (Table 1, Fig. S5).

3.1.2. Elementary reactions for NOPDH on Rh(111)
NOPDH is a reaction between catalyst surface and propane/hydrogen mixture, so possible elementary reaction steps can be simply classified as C-H dissociation (dehydrogenation) and C-C dissociation (cracking) of CxHy (x = 1–3; y = 1–8), referred as 1 A to 7 A (Table S1, Fig. 2). Among the dehydrogenation steps, deep-dehydrogenation refers to the side reactions that do not lead reaction intermediates to gas products but rather lead them to coke precursors including 3B-G, 4 A and 5B-C. The physisorbed gas species are considered as non-activated adsorption on the surface due to the very weak binding strength, thus their dehydrogenation steps are regarded as Eley-Rideal reaction for the simplicity of simulation [44].

Fig. 2. Considered surface reactions of NOPDH, (a) C3 (b) C2 and (c) C1 reactions (labels Nx, N = 1–7, x = A - H defined in Table S1). Color code: gray, carbon; white, hydrogen.
Generally, dehydrogenation barriers are lower than cracking barriers, so the dehydrogenation of C3 and C2 intermediates will predominate over cracking (Fig. 3). Furthermore, as the number of C-H bonds decreases, the dehydrogenation barriers decrease; this change implies that deactivation by deep-dehydrogenation is faster than deactivation by cracking. The C2 and C1 products such as ethane and methane require the cracking of C3 species with the sequential hydrogenations by the deposited H atoms on the surfaces. Barriers to cracking are higher for 2 A and 2 F than for 3 A, 3E, and 3H (Table S1), so the C2 and C1 precursors will not be generated until more C-H bonds are removed so that cracking barriers becomes lower than that of dehydrogenation. The 5th dehydrogenation barriers (5B and 5 C) are higher than cracking barriers (5D), so the cracking of C3H4 intermediates will predominantly generate C2 and C1 (Fig. 3). Methane precursors can be formed by cracking of C2 intermediates.

Fig. 4. Top view of Rh(111) (a) 3 × 3 DFT surface and (b) 10 × 10 kMC surface. Four surface sites (fcc hollow, hcp hollow, top and bridge) were considered in the DFT surface, whereas only two (fcc hollow, top) were considered in the kMC surface. Color code: gray, carbon; white, hydrogen; blue, rhodium.
Each of the reaction path requires unique number of active sites. For example, reaction path 1 A (Table S1) requires only two neighboring fcc sites, whereas cracking reactions require at least three active fcc sites. Therefore, in a large-scale heterogeneous system, the availability of active sites will affect the reaction frequencies. Although DFT simulations can provide helpful insights into the NOPDH on Rh(111), several significant limitations prevent further understanding of the reaction: 1) the reaction condition is not taken into account; 2) the precursors of the products are elusive, and 3) the importance of the local environment is overlooked (e.g., intermediate coverage and lateral interactions between co-adsorbed species). To overcome these limitations, we performed kMC simulations using the DFT-calculated energetics in conjunction with the reaction conditions of reactant pressure, temperature, reactant cofeeding, and NOPDH uncertainty under experimental conditions (Fig. 1).
3.2. kMC results
We applied kMC simulations at typical NOPDH operating conditions of 873 K and 1 bar of reactant in an initial 1:1 ratio of propane to hydrogen. To provide unambiguous insight into the NOPDH reactions, this analysis covers the entire network of NOPDH reactions, including all routes reported in the literature [32], [33], [47].
3.2.1. Kinetic inputs for kMC simulations: prefactors, lateral interaction and convergence of simulations
The input data for the kMC simulations were taken from all of the ZPE-corrected reaction energies and activation energies (EA) of the most stable adsorption configurations (Fig. S5; Tables S1-S3). The rate constants were evaluated using Arrhenius equations and calculated prefactors, and the EA of each elementary step. Furthermore, lateral interactions between intermediates were considered using cluster expansion. The interactions among the first-nearest neighboring species were considered (Table S4).
The convergence of the kMC simulations with regard to the size of the kMC lattice was tested by performing the same kMC simulations using a 20 × 20 kMC surface (four times the size of the 10 × 10 surface). The calculated kinetic parameters including turnover frequency (TOF), selectivity, and coverage were not affected by the size of the lattice or by the random seed (Fig. S3, S4). Therefore, we chose the 10 × 10 lattice in subsequent calculations.
The total number of kMC steps was 7,651,399 (0.2 s simulation time), at which the steady state is reached with almost identical coverage of the intermediate species. In addition, due to the total deactivation of the catalytic surface, most of the elementary reactions achieved steady state and the system reached the chemical equilibrium without producing any additional products. (Fig. S3). Previous studies reported 0.02 s simulation time for equilibrated NOPDH on Pt(111) and 2000 s simulation time on Pt/Cu SAA(111) [32], [33]. Rh(111) and Pt(111) surfaces have higher ability than Pt/Cu SAA(111) surface to activate C-H, so the reaction time required to achieve equilibrium for NOPDH reaction is very short on Rh(111) and Pt(111) surfaces [14]. A minor variation in reaction energy may cause the reaction to proceed several orders of magnitude faster than it would in other instances. Additionally, the kMC slab used here is smaller than those used in the two previous studies [32], [33].
3.2.2. Catalytic pathways of NOPDH on Rh(111)
To understand the catalytic pathways of NOPDH on Rh(111), the event frequency of the each elementary reaction step was first calculated, then the reaction flow diagram was constructed using the net event frequencies of each step (Fig. 5, Fig. 6a, Appendix A Supplementary material, Fig. 2). The simulation visits most of the dehydrogenation elementary reaction steps under the reaction conditions, but does not visit some of the cracking steps such as those of CH3CH and CH3CHC (Fig. 6a, Appendix A Supplementary material, Fig. 2). This trend is entirely consistent with the observation that cracking barriers are typically higher than dehydrogenation barriers. Some of the elementary reactions equilibrated but produced no net species. The first dehydrogenation steps of C3H8 gas species are rate-limiting for the overall NOPDH process, with execution frequencies several orders of magnitude lower than the second and third dehydrogenation steps. Between the two first-dehydrogenation steps, the CH₃CHCH₃-mediated path is dominant over the CH₃CH₂CH₂-mediated path for propylene generation. The second dehydrogenation paths to side reaction precursors such as CH₃CH₂CH and CH₃CCH₃ did not occur, because the reverse reaction has almost zero energy barrier, so the reaction is perfectly equilibrated so no net change occurs. The propylene on the surface then undergoes one of three pathways that determine the selectivity of overall NOPDH: deep-dehydrogenation, cracking and desorption of propylene. Given 113 adsorbed propanes, 15 propylenes are produced, and most of the remaining propylenes undergo deep-dehydrogenation (84) and cracking (24). The most probable path for propylene and its coke precursors is C3H8 → CH3CHCH3 → CH3CHCH2 → CH3CHCH → CH3CHC → CH3CC. Ethane is mostly formed by hydrogenation of CH3CH, which is formed during propylene cracking. Thus, the most probable pathway to ethane is CH3CHCH2 → CH3CH → CH3CH2 → CH3CH3. Of the produced CH4, 60% is produced by sequential hydrogenation of CH2 intermediates; the rest are formed directly from cracked C intermediates, mainly CH3CC, but also CH3CCH3 and CH3CHCH3. As a result, the most probable pathway to methane is CH3CHCH2 → CH2 → CH3 → CH4. Given that the formation of ethane and methane requires multiple hydrogenation steps, a high-coverage hydrogen environment at the very early stages of the reaction by H2 co-feeding seems to be critical for the formation of ethane and methane. Alkynes are not identified in our simulations, due to the strong binding of alkyne species to Rh(111).

Color code: gray, carbon; white, hydrogen.
3.2.3. Kinetic parameters: TOF, selectivity and coverage
To acquire kinetic insight into the NOPDH reaction, the rate of propane consumption, the TOF and the coverage were determined. These parameters are highly dependent on the accuracy of the DFT input, but the calculated DFT inputs of Rh(111) were almost identical to reported MKM studies that used different functionals for the DFT calculations, and the resulting kinetic parameters were consistent with the previous experimental results [17], [25], so the DFT input can be reasonably considered to be at least nearly correct [14]. The rate of propane consumption on Rh(111) at the initial state of the reaction was 475/s/site after the kMC time of 0.001 s, and 247.5/s/site after 0.002 s; these are similar to the value of ~300/s/site in the initial state on Pt(111) (Fig. 6b, Table S5) [32]. Most of the propane is spent during the initial stage of the reaction and the propane consumption rate drops rapidly as the surface-active sites become covered by reaction intermediates as reaction time proceeds.
The TOF for Rh(111) was ~20/s/site after 0.001 s, which is smaller than ~25/s/site on Pt(111) and larger than the ~0.5/s/site on Pt/Cu SAA(111) [32], [33]. These comparisons indicate that high activity for NOPDH can be attributed to the lower reaction barriers for most of the elementary steps on Rh(111) than on the two catalysts. Although the reaction barrier toward propylene is lower on Rh(111) than on Pt(111), side reactions such as deep-dehydrogenation and cracking on Rh(111) are easier than on Pt(111), so TOF is lower on Rh(111) than on Pt(111), and Rh(111) surface is easily deactivated by further dehydrogenation of cracking reactions.
The selectivity of propylene on Rh(111) was ~47% after 0.2 s, followed by ethane, methane and ethylene (36%, 11% and 6% respectively) (Fig. 6d). At the initial stage when hydrogen coverage is high, the selectivity toward ethane and methane is higher than for propylene, then propylene production exceeds other products as surface sites become covered. In addition, under high hydrogen coverage during the early state of the kMC simulation, propylene on the surface was not likely to fall into side reactions rather being desorbed, which is the prominent H2 co-feeding effect on the selectivity of NOPDH. [47], [48] However, Rh(111) can break the C-C bond easily to prepare C1 and C2 precursors on the surface, so H2 co-feeding could increase the selectivity of ethane and methane. Therefore, intrinsic C-C bond dissociation ability and deep-dehydrogenation ability should be manipulated when designing highly selective Rh-based catalysts.
3.2.4. Origin of catalyst deactivation
Rh(111) was deactivated quickly during the early stage of the reaction, then remained in a steady state that produces only small amounts of products. Most of the active surface sites were covered in the early stage of the reaction (~0.002 s) mostly by prominent dead-end species such as CH3CC and CH3C (Fig. 6c). This behavior was also captured in previous experiments, which determined that the lower conversion by Rh than by RhSn alloy catalyst is a result of the fast deep-dehydrogenation of Rh [25]. Most of the deep-dehydrogenated C3 species are further dehydrogenated until the catalytically dead-end species CH3CC forms, which will be finally cracked into small C2 and C1 species. Although CH3CC could be easily cracked into C and CH3C (Fig. 5), CH3CC is still the most dominant coking species, because the cracking requires several active sites considering less available sites for the reaction, which is consistent with the case of Cr2O3 where the CH3CC is a major coke species [44]. We identified that most of the cracking of C3 species occurs when CH3CC is formed, whereas CH3CCH has been identified as a major cracking precursor on the Pt(111) surface [12], [47], [48]. The most probable scenario of coke formation on Rh(111) is CH3CHCH2 → CH3CHCH → CH3CHC → CH3CC → CH3C.
3.2.5. Strategy to improve Rh-based catalysts
Direct comparison of simulation results to experimental ones is contentious because of the fundamental difference between simulation and reality, mostly due to the assumptions in the simulations and intrinsic error of the DFT calculation. Nevertheless, our kMC simulations could provide several informative insights into the mechanisms and contributing factors in NOPDH reactions. Although Rh(111) displays higher activity for C-H bond activations than other platinum-group metals, its selectivity is not satisfactory due to the facile formation of deep-dehydrogenated dead-end species [14]. Furthermore, cracking and deep-dehydrogenation require a cluster of at least three Rh atoms, so structurally decreasing the size of the Rh catalyst could increase the selectivity of the Rh-based catalyst without losing its high C-H cleavage activity. We also found that the C-C activation of C3 intermediates occurs when C-H bonds are almost removed, so deep-dehydrogenation is a key factor to induce cracking. Therefore, controlling its intrinsic C-H activation ability by alloying with non-active metals is a promising strategy to increase the activity of Rh-based catalyst. For example, Natarajan et al. found that NOPDH on RhSn alloy catalyst has higher conversion and selectivity than state-of-the-art PtSn alloy catalyst [25]. The RhSn alloy with the large ratio of Sn (larger than 1:1) showed high activity and selectivity, whereas PtSn is known to have optimal Pt:Sn ratio between 3:1 and 1:1 [2], [24]. Furthermore, Ga-Rh catalyst for NOPDH in the form of the single Rh atoms in liquid Ga, is selective and stable [22]. Recently, a highly active and selective RhCu SAA catalyst has been identified using first-principles predictions and experiments [24]. Singly-distributed Rh atom in 1:100 ratio on the Cu metal showed superior propane production rate with 100% selectivity.
4. Conclusion
DFT calculations and kMC simulations were performed to reveal the overall mechanism of NOPDH on a Rh(111) surface with regards to the reaction path, catalytic efficiency and coke formation. kMC simulations provided unbiased insights into NOPDH in industrial operating conditions by considering a complete reaction network that included 112 elementary steps.
We identified that the first dehydrogenation step is the rate-determining step, as has been reported on surfaces such as Pt and Pd. We also identified that the propylene is by far the most important intermediate species to determine selectivity. A close inspection of reaction-flow directions suggested that C3H8 → CH3CHCH3 → CH3CHCH2 → CH3CHCH → CH3CHC → CH3CC is the most probable route for production of propylene and its coke precursors.
However, the selectivity of Rh(111) for propylene is unsatisfactory, mainly due to fast deep-dehydrogenation and strong CH3CHCH2 binding strength on the surface. The carbon source for ethane and methane evolution is the most predominantly cracking of CH3CHCH2, whereas the formation of C2 and C1 gas products requires high coverage of H2 on the surface. Deactivation of the catalyst starts in the early stage of the reaction by the accumulated CH3CC and C2 coking species. The results are strongly consistent with previous experiments. We suggested several strategies to design Rh-based catalyst considering the perspective of reducing deep-dehydrogenation while keeping the C-H activation ability. Most of deep-dehydrogenation requires more than three neighboring active sites, so we recommend covering some of the active sites with non-active inert metals. One such way is to alloy the active metal with inactive carbophobic elements such as Sn and Ga.
The present DFT calculations in conjunction with highly accurate kMC simulations have identified key selectivity, activity limiting-steps and deactivation mechanisms by investigating possible elementary reaction steps of dehydrogenation and cracking on Rh in realistic NOPDH conditions. Our theoretical analysis on the Rh(111) system will provide many informative insights into the deactivation mechanisms and will guide development of principles to design highly active and selective NOPDH catalyst. However, realistic experiment environments still have elusive aspects that are not included in this simulation, such as dependence on the morphology Rh nanoparticles, and possible synergic effects between Rh particles and the support. These possibilities should be examined in future studies on the NOPDH.

    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
