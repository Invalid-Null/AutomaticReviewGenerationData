1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important commodity chemicals and precursors in the petrochemical for the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, cumene [1,2]. Traditionally, propylene has primarily been produced through pyrolysis of gaseous alkanes and liquid petroleum products [3]. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a potential alternative for on-purpose propylene formation due to its favorable thermodynamics and negligible coke formation. However, low propylene yield restricts its commercialization, despite of significant energy saving of ODHP [4,5].
Various catalysts and oxidizing agents, such as O2, NO2, or CO2 have been explored for the ODHP reaction [6]. The competing side-reactions such as propylene and propane over-oxidation to COx instead of the desired dehydrogenation pathway, becomes more favored in the presence of O2. Recently, catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 as a soft oxidant instead of oxygen has been investigated by various research groups from academia and industry. Utilizing CO2 can prevent the formation of hot spots on the catalysts as it has a high heat capacity (846 J/kg.K), thereby allowing absorption of the generated heat from the exothermic oxidation/dehydrogenation reaction [7]. Furthermore, CO2 is a greenhouse gas whose accumulation in the atmosphere contributes to climate change [8] and, through utilizing CO2, a value-added chemical commodity can be generated from a harmful anthropogenic emission. This being stated, it is also important to consider the ODHP catalyst, as the balance of acid and basic sites is the larger contributor to overall performance [9].
Of the many studies on ODHP catalysts, V, Ga, and Zr, doped on H-ZSM-5 have shown some of the most interesting results. Such catalysts have been extensively studied over the past decade, as H-ZSM-5 provides the necessary acidity to drive dehydrogenation, while these particular oxides contain the appropriate basic sites for CO2 reduction [10,11]. For example, Ren et al. reported a propane conversion of 45 % and a propylene selectivity of 47 % over the Ga3O2/HZSM-5 catalyst and demonstrated that the acidity of the zeolite plays an important role on the products selectivities [12]. Presently, the easiest and most common method to synthesize these types of catalysts is to produce them in the form of nanopowders via mechanical mixing or incipient impregnation [13]. This being stated, such a method is not appropriate for industrial processes, as the high flow rates in reactor systems lead to scattering of the catalyst powders. For this reason, the catalysts should be formed into structured contractors before use in scaled ODHP reactors.
Rapid prototyping, or additive manufacturing, which is undergone by 3D printing has been a transformative technology in many fields, enabling structures with unique properties. The ability to 3D print catalyst structures will enable new functional catalytic materials that unite the appealing material properties of catalysts with tailored catalytic spices [[14], [15], [16]]. This being stated, our previous approach utilized wet-impregnation to impregnate the catalyst component and, because hydrophobic behaviors were observed at high loadings, the oxide concentrations were limited to ∼10 wt.%. Because of this, it was impossible to study the effects of mixing different oxides and high loadings on catalytic performance. However, as shown in literature, one way of overcoming this limitation would be to directly print metal oxides, thereby circumventing the rheological limitations associated with dissolved nitrates. For example, Jakus et al. demonstrated manufacturing 50 wt.% of Fe2O3 on nickel through direct 3D printing of insoluble oxides [17]. By utilizing this technique, we theorized that the catalytic oxide loadings could be expanded beyond 10 wt.% and the effects of higher loading as well as oxide mixing could be investigated.
Motivated by this possibility, we embarked on a study that employed direct 3D printing of insoluble oxides to investigate the effects of oxide mixing on catalytic performance. Specifically, we formulated 3D-printed monoliths whose active components were comprised of 15 wt.% Ga/15 wt.% V (15Ga-15V@ZSM-5), 15 wt.% Ga/15 wt.% Zr (15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5), 15 wt.% V/15 wt.% Zr (15V-15Zr@ZSM-5), and 10 wt.% Ga/10 wt.% V/10 wt.% Zr (10Ga-10V-10Zr@ZSM-5) all balanced with 70 wt.% H-ZSM-5 to study the effect of metal oxide loading on the catalytic performance in the presence and absence of CO2. Binary and ternary metal oxides were used in this study to investigate the capability of the new printing method for incorporating multiple oxides at a high concentration into a single structure. Overall, the current study provides the results of employing appropriate 3D-printed metal oxides/H-ZSM-5 for the ODHP reaction to produce propylene that opens up new avenues for synthesizing other catalysts with potential availability of propylene production through ODHP.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
The H-ZSM-5 used in this study (SiO2:Al2O3 = 50) was purchased from Zeolyst International. All the other materials used for the synthesis of mixed oxides/zeolite catalyst monoliths via 3D printing including Ga2O3 (99.99 %), V2O5 (98 %), ZrO2 (99 %), bentonite clay (Sigma), and methylcellulose (99 %) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and were used without any further modification. All the ultra-high purity gases used for the catalytic assessment tests were provided by Airgas.
2.2. Monolith formulation
In this study, we selected Ga, V, and Zr metal oxides because of their various oxidation states and redox capabilities [[18], [19], [20]]. As the catalyst support, H-ZSM-5 was used on account of its high surface area and pore volume besides its appropriate acidity [21]. The monoliths were 3D-printed using the paste ratios in Table 1. Water was the only solvent needed to form a homogeneous paste. The prepared pastes were manufactured into the monoliths using the same setup reported in our previous works [14,16,22]. Briefly, the pastes were mixed inside of a PTFE bottle with 10 mL of DI water. The bottle was then vigorously shaken to disperse all the powders. The resulting slurry was rolled for 48 h at ambient temperature and 20 rpm to achieve homogeneity. Thereafter, it was densified at 50 °C and 300 rpm to generate a printable paste. The paste was then formed into structured monoliths using our established setup [16,22,23]. After printing, the monoliths were dried overnight at 25 °C and, finally, were calcined in air at 750 °C for 6 h, using a ramp rate of 10 °C/min, to burn out the methylcellulose.

2.3. Characterization
The morphology of the synthesized monolithic catalysts was analyzed by the Zeiss Merlin Gemini field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The elemental mapping of the samples was obtained through energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) by a Bruker 5030 X-Flash diffractometer with an accelerating voltage of 25 kV. The monoliths’ textural properties and surface area were investigated by N2 physisorption at 77 K on a Micromeritics (3Flex) gas analyzer. Prior to analysis, the monoliths were degassed at 350 ℃ for 6 h under vacuum by a Micromeritics Smart VacPrep system. The Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) model was utilized to calculate the surface area of the sample while the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) method was used for the calculation of pore volume. The catalysts’ crystallinities were assessed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using zero-noise silicon substrates (SIL’TRONIX) on a PANalytical X’Pert multipurpose X-ray diffractometer. The scan step size was 0.02°/step with 5° ≤ 2θ ≤ 90° at the rate of 137.2 s/step. H2-TPR and NH3-TPD were performed on the Micromeritics (3Flex) gas analyzer by using the method explained in our previous works [14,15].
2.4. Catalytic tests
To assess the monolithic catalysts’ performances, an in-house reactor setup was used as explained in our previous works [14,15]. The reactor was equipped with a furnace to provide homogenous heating and a K-type thermocouple was employed in the middle of the reactor to measure and monitor the temperature of the bed. The ODHP reaction over all the monolithic catalysts was ran in the presence and absence of CO2 as the oxidant. For each test, 0.2 g monolithic catalysts were packed into the reactor. Prior to the ODHP reaction, the catalysts were activated with air at a flow rate of 150 mL/min and 750 ℃ for 1 h. After this step, the air line was closed and the reactor was set to cool down to the desired temperature under 60 mL/min of N2. After 1 h, the N2 line was closed and the feed gas was flown into the reactor at a flow rate of 60 mL/min and a space velocity of 4500 mL/gcat.h. The outlet stream of the reactor was fed to an SRI 8610C gas chromatograph (GC) which was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID). For the ODHP reaction in the presence of CO2, the feed gas composition was 2.5 mol% propane and 5 mol% CO2 balanced with N2. The stream was analyzed every 30 min to find out the composition of the products stream. Initially, ODHP over the catalysts was performed at 500, 550, 600, and 650 ℃ for 2 h to assess and screen the reaction. Among these temperatures, 550 ℃ showed the best balance of propane conversion and propylene selectivity and, thusly, was used in the prolonged stability experiments with 6 h on-stream. The stability tests were ran and analyzed in the absence of CO2, as well, for 6 h at 550 ℃ with the same procedure and with the feed gas composition of 5 mol% propane balanced with N2. All the connecting lines for the feed and products stream were equipped with heating tapes to prevent any condensation. The propane and CO2 conversions were calculated by Equations S1 and S2, respectively. The turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated by the same method previously used in the literature [24]. The propylene, ethylene, and methane selectivities were calculated by Equation S3.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. 3D-printed monolith structures
Fig. 1 shows the 3D printed monoliths. As evident, the samples have open channels without any structural defect, however, the 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 monolith (Fig. 1c) showed slight swelling. This was attributed to a slightly lower viscosity during printing. The colors of the monoliths are consistent with the constituting metal oxides, as gallium oxide and zirconium oxide are both white powders and vanadium oxide is in yellow-brown. Given that the monolith colors were homogeneous, it was suggested that the oxides had distributed evenly throughout the entire structures, instead of forming pockets of individual metals.

3.2. Monoliths textural properties
The N2 physisorption isotherms at 77 K and pore size distributions of the 3D-printed monolithic catalysts are observed in Fig. 2, while Table 2 summarizes their textural properties. The pore size distributions have been vertically shifted for clarity. From the physisorption isotherms (Fig. 2a), all the monoliths followed type II physisorption behavior, which is consistent with nonporous or macroporous materials with unrestricted monolayer and multilayer adsorption according to IUPAC [25]. It is also worth noting here that all monoliths exhibited type H4 hysteresis, which is consistent with microporous and mesoporous zeolites such as H-ZSM-5 [25]. This was further evidenced by 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5′s increase in N2 physisorption capacity compared to pristine H-ZSM-5, which indicated that new structures had formed in that particular sample. Indeed, this was further evidenced by the pore size distributions (Fig. 2b), where 15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5 and 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 showed profiles similar to H-ZSM-5 powder, while 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5 and 10Ga-10V-10Zr@ZSM-5 showed enhanced porosity between 2 and 10 nm.

Table 2 shows the textural properties of the 3D-printed monolithic catalysts. In agreement with the N2 physisorption isotherms, all the samples experienced a reduction in surface area and pore volume compared to the bare H-ZSM-5. These reductions in textural properties were to be expected, as they are consistent with the oxide and bentonite concentrations within the 3D-printed monolithic catalysts. In 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5, however, a profound decrease in both surface area and pore volume compared to the other monoliths and H-ZSM-5 powder was observed. It could be attributed to the interactions between the metal oxides and the zeolite surface that led to the change in the H-ZSM-5 structure. This is later approved by XRD analysis.
3.3. XRD
Fig. 3a shows the XRD patterns for the manufactured monoliths while Fig. 3b demonstrates the corresponding NIST data for the various oxides and zeolite. The zirconium-containing samples showed peaks at 2θ = 42° which is related to the (120) index of ZrO2 particles [26]. Also, the increased intensity of the peak at 2θ = 27° compared to the H-ZSM-5 pattern could be attributed to the ZrO2 (111) plane that exists at the same angle [27]. The samples containing gallium experienced diffractive peaks at 2θ = 39° and 65° which are attributed to the (-310) and (403) plains of the gallium oxide rods, respectively [28]. Also, samples containing vanadium have a peak at 2θ = 22° which corresponds to the (001) plane of crystalline V2O5 [29]. The most significant observation in the diffractive pattern for 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5 is the loss in peaks at 2θ = 7° and 46° which indicates that the H-ZSM-5 underwent structural changes during calcination. This was attributed to the interactions between Si−OH group at high temperature and formed V2O5 during the calcination that lead to dealumination of the zeolite and a change in the material’s structure [30]. Notably, this did not occur in 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5, however, that particular monolith exhibited a new peak at 2θ = 21°, which can be attributed to the formation of orthorhombic ZrV2O7 superstructures [[31], [32], [33]], and indicates that the V2O5 preferentially reacts with ZrO2 over H-ZSM-5 during the calcination step. The same peak with less intensity is observable in the mixed metal oxide pattern, further confirming this conclusion. Moreover, the mixed metal oxide monolith experienced peak losses at 2θ = 28° and 32° compared to the other monoliths that are found in both monoclinic ZrO2 nanostructures and heated vanadium oxide [26,34]. This could be attributed to the interactions leading to the change in the crystallinity of ZrO2 and vanadium oxide in the presence of all three metal oxides. Overall, the XRD patterns agreed with the textural properties and further indicated the formulation of new structures in 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5 and the mixed metal oxide sample.

3.4. Morphology and elemental mapping
The SEM images and elemental maps for 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 are shown in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4a, the monoliths had channels with a diameter of around 300−350 μm and no visible cracking. The monolith had a rough surface topology with an observable macropore size of ∼2 μm (Fig. 4b-c), where the macropore formation was attributed to methylcellulose removal during calcination [23]. Also, a good dispersion of an amorphous phases alongside crystalline phases could be observed across the monolith’s surface (Fig. 4d), while most of the crystallites are in trapezoidal-like structures and ∼1 μm in diameter. From the elemental maps (Fig. 4e-f), which correspond to the SEM image in Fig. 4b, both of the metal oxides have high dispersion across the surface. This could be attributed to the superstructure formation, as the interactions between ZrO2 and V2O5 likely led to the energetic mobilization of both oxide components during coordination. It is also worth noting here that Fig. 4f revealed isolated clusters of high V2O5 concentrations, which likely could have been caused by the partial substitution of VOx into the H-ZSM-5 structure [35]. Overall, the SEM images and EDS maps in Fig. 4 indicate the presence of multiple crystalline structures in 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 and show high dispersion of both metal components.

The SEM images and elemental maps for 15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5 are shown in Fig. 5. From Fig. 5a, that the monolith had similar channel sizing and mechanical stability to 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5. Here, however, the surface showed macropores of ∼5 μm, which is larger than 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5, and could be attributed to the absence of vanadium oxide that enters the reaction with −OH clusters of the zeolite (Fig. 5b) [36]. At higher magnification (Fig. 5c-d), both a well-defined and rod-like crystalline phase were observed. Using EDS, the elemental mapping images show that the rod-like crystallites are corresponding to the gallium oxide phase, which is in line with the results obtained from XRD. Also, it is evident from the elemental maps in Fig. 5e-f, which correspond to the micrograph in Fig. 5b, that both zirconium oxide and gallium oxide are distributed well across the surface, although some heterogeneous distribution of Ga2O3 is observed which is attributed to the rod-like crystallites. Concerning this high dispersion, it was expected to observe a good catalytic activity for the ODHP reaction.

The SEM images and elemental maps for 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5 are shown in Fig. 6. The channels of the monolith have a diameter of ∼500−600 μm, which is larger in comparison with 15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5 and 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 monoliths, and could be attributed to the previously discussed lower paste viscosity (Fig. 6a). It is also worth noting that a small crack is observed on the sample’s surface. While it appears only in one region, the crack is likely to be occurred when cutting the sample for mounting on the SEM stub. Looking at the sample’s surface topography (Fig. 6b-c), small particles are distributed evenly while some rod-like crystallites are also present (Fig. 6b-c). The rod-like crystalline phase could be attributed to the gallium oxide presence, as the same evidence was previously observed in 15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5 SEM and EDS analyses. Looking at the image acquired in high magnitude (Fig. 6d), a trapezoidal crystalline phase of ∼2−4 μm in diameter was observed. It could be attributed to the vanadium oxide presence as the same structure was observed in 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 monolith. The elemental maps, which relate to the micrograph in Fig. 6b, indicated homogeneous vanadium dispersion across the monolith with reduced agglomeration compared to 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 (Fig. 6f). Moreover, the gallium map in Fig. 6e confirmed that the rod-like crystallites were due to the gallium oxide presence. Overall, although some gallium oxide clusters are observed in Fig. 6e, the elemental maps show that the distribution of both vanadium and gallium are more homogenous than the other counterparts with less agglomeration, which could suggest a probable interaction between vanadium oxide and gallium oxide. Concerning this even distribution, it was anticipated to observe a good catalytic performance from this catalyst monolith for ODHP reaction due to highly dispersed active sites. An important feature observed for this material is the different appearance of the structure in Fig. 6c as it shows pores with greater diameter compared to the other samples.

The SEM images and elemental maps for 10Ga-10V-10Zr@ZSM-5 are shown in Fig. 7. From Fig. 7a-b, it is evident that the monolith has open channels with a diameter of ∼400 μm with and even dispersion of phases across the surface. At higher magnification, Fig. 7c reveals that all the structural species and properties observed in the previous monoliths were retained in 10Ga-10V-10Zr@ZSM-5 (Fig. 7c). More specifically, both amorphous and crystalline phases were observed in the high magnification image (Fig. 7d), which were consistent with those in the other monoliths. Using EDS, the elemental maps (Fig. 7e-h) indicated that gallium oxide was dispersed evenly across the structure of the monolith, while zirconium and vanadium oxides both exhibited clustering behavior, which could be attributed to the aforementioned ZrV2O7 superstructure formation [31,32]. As noted in the literature, this kind of superstructure could potentially affect the catalytic activity of the sample [33].

3.5. Redox capability
Fig. 8 illustrates the H2-TPR measurements for the manufactured monoliths. The initial H2 reduction temperature follows the order of Ga-Zr < Ga-V < Ga-V-Zr < V-Zr whereas the H2 reduction peak follows Ga-V-Zr > V-Zr > Ga-Zr > Ga-V. In 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5, 15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5, and 15Ga-15V-15Zr@ZSM-5, a small peak centered at 640 ℃ was observed which is attributed to the reduction of bulk Ga2O3 into bulk Ga2O [37]. The observed peak at 670 ℃ is also attributed to the reduction of ZrO2 into Zr.

Fig. 8. H2-TPR results of the monolithic catalysts.
The most significant peak observed in all the samples except 15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5 is the wide one centered at 590 ℃ which is attributed to the reduction of V2O5 to V6O13 [38]. Small shoulders in the same samples existing at ∼680 ℃ is also ascribed to the reduction of as-formed V6O13 to V2O4 [38]. That being stated, the variety of peaks related to the different oxidation states of vanadium show the capability of the vanadium-containing samples for an oxidation reaction. The low-temperature surface reduction peak at around 160 ℃ for 15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5 could be attributed to the −OH clusters of the zeolite structure while it is not observed for the other samples as the result of the aforementioned interaction between vanadium oxide and −OH groups of the zeolite [36]. Furthermore, 10Ga-10V-10Zr@ZSM-5 exhibited a reduction in a wide range of temperatures between 350 ℃ and 750 ℃, which includes the oxidation states of all three constituting metal oxides. Overall, based on the H2-TPR results, vanadium was present with the oxidation states of +3, +4, and +5, while gallium had the oxidation states of +2 and +3 and zirconium was in its predominant +4 oxidation state. The metal oxide loading affects the reduction behaviors and density of lattice oxygen removal from the metal oxide doped ZSM-5 monolithic catalysts.
3.6. Acid surface sites
Fig. 9 presents the NH3-TPD profiles of 3D-printed catalyst monoliths. As evident, all the contain a peak below 250 ℃, which is correlated to the weak acidic sites [39]. These weak acidic sites are mainly attributed to the structure of H-ZSM-5 as reported previously. In 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5, however, this peak is of lesser intensity, which likely could be attributed to the decomposition of −OH sites of the zeolite, as previously observed with XRD. It is also worth noting here that all samples also contained a peak at ∼550 ℃, which correlates with strong acid sites [39]. Among the monoliths, 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5 exhibited a wider temperature range for the strong acid sites, which corresponds to different acidic sites of gallium and vanadium oxide with a wide range of strength. In addition, zirconium containing monoliths experienced a shoulder between 300℃ and 350 ℃ which is ascribed to the acidic sites with medium strength [40]. A unique peak at 650 ℃ was observed for 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 that could be attributed to the high-strength acidic sites provided by the formation of the aforementioned ZrV2O7 superstructures [31,32]. Overall, 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 and 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5 had a greater concentration of strong acidic sites, while weaker acidic sites were mostly observed in 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 and 15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5. Also, 15Ga-15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 had all of the low-strength, medium-strength, and high-strength acidic sites observed in the other monoliths, except that observed at 650 ℃ for 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5, which is in agreement with the mixture of all three metal oxides. That being stated, 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 monoliths had the most diverse acidic sites among all the monoliths as it has a good concentration of weak-strength, medium-strength, and high-strength acidic sites. This diversity in the strength of acidic sites could be beneficial for the monolith’s catalytic ability for the ODHP reaction as the Brønsted sites are the agents for dehydrogenation reaction.

3.7. Catalytic performance
The ODHP catalytic activities of the prepared monolithic catalysts are shown in Fig. 10. All monolithic catalysts demonstrate different trends. It can be seen from the catalytic evaluation results, both propane and CO2 conversion were increased by enhancing reaction temperatures, while propylene selectivity was favored at lower temperatures. These results could be attributed to the propane and propylene cracking and are in good agreement with thermodynamic data analysis [41]. It is also evident that the propane conversion is in the same range for all the monoliths, which shows the good ability of all the 3D-printed catalysts for ODHP reaction as a result of appropriate active sites distribution. Also, it confirms that the addition of metal oxides mixture and the manufacturing method did not affect the catalytic ability of H-ZSM-5. The notable point here is that no BTX was observed over these catalysts which suggests that they are not good candidates for aromatization reactions. Amongst all the catalysts, 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5 (Fig. 10a) and 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 (Fig. 10c) showed the best performance in terms of propylene selectivity. This could be attributed to the presence of vanadium oxide that provides a variety of oxidation states and enough lattice oxygen, which are advantageous for the ODHP reaction through consecutive cycles of redox reactions with propane and CO2. Also, the high amount of acidic sites in these samples could be the reason for higher propylene selectivity since the Brønsted acidity is the agent for dehydrogenation reaction [42]. This is while 15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5 monolith that has no vanadium showed a significant drop in propylene selectivity (Fig. 10b) that could suggest the presence of Lewis acidic sites, prompting the re-adsorption of olefins [43]. In addition, the monolith containing the mixture of all three metal oxides exhibited a worse performance compared to 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5 and 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 in terms of propylene selectivity (Fig. 10d), which could be attributed to the interactions between the metals and oxides affecting their redox capabilities [44], and indicates that coming all three components may deteriorate the performance of vanadium-containing catalysts. Those being stated, coupling acidic sites of the zeolite with lattice oxygen of the metal oxides play the pivotal role in conversion of the propane and CO2 and selectivity of propylene. Specifically, acid sites are the agents for dehydrogenation of propane, resulting in production of propylene and carbon oxides [42]. Briefly, acid sites donate their H+ cation that interacts with the propane molecule and a carbonium ion is produced as the transition state. Since CHH bond is not as stable as CCH bond, it is cracked and the propane molecule loses one of its H atoms. The same occurs for the second hydrogen atom on the propane that results in the formation of a propylene and a H2 molecule [42]. On the other hand, lattice oxygen of the metal oxides are the agents for the ODHP reaction. Namely, according to the proposed Mars van Krevelen mechanism, lattice oxygen of the metal oxide oxidizes the propane molecule, resulting in the production of propylene and hydrogen [7,45,46]. The present oxidant, which is CO2 in this study, re-oxidizes the reduced metal oxide that leads to the replenishment of the lattice oxygen and helps the subsequent ODHP reaction [46]. That is why vanadium-containing catalysts displayed an outstanding performance in ODHP reaction, as it imparts multiple oxidation states and is capable of transmitting from one state to the other [7]. Concerning the conversion of propane and the selectivity of propylene, 550 ℃ was selected for further study of ODHP reaction over the catalyst monoliths for prolonged tests. This is while a significant drop was observed in propylene selectivity after this temperature. Overall, considering the performance at 550 ℃, the catalysts were ranked by their performance in ODHP reaction in the following order: 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 > 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5 > 10Ga-10V-10Zr@ZSM-5 > 15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5.

Conversion and selectivity as a function of reactor temperature for (a) 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5, (b) 15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5, (c) 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5, and (d) 10Ga-10V-10Zr@ZSM-5 after 2 h at each temperature with the feed composition of 2.5 mol% propane, 5 mol% CO2 balanced with N2, flow rate of 60 mL/min, and space velocity of 4500 mL/gcat.h.
The results from the catalytic stability experiments in the presence of CO2 at 550 °C for 6 h are shown in Fig. 11. All the monolithic catalysts exhibited a stable performance during the prolonged ODHP reaction with a negligible change in propane conversion and propylene selectivity. As discussed in the previous section, the propane conversion is roughly in the same range (30–40 % conversion), where the highest conversion was observed in 15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5. In agreement with the short-term catalytic tests, 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5 (Fig. 11a) and 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 (Fig. 11c) showed the highest propylene selectivity with the values of 87 % and 90 %, respectively, which could be attributed to the various oxidation states of vanadium and its redox capabilities [47]. Fig. 11b illustrates that, although the propane conversion was slightly higher over 15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5, propylene selectivity was significantly reduced, which was likely caused by cracking over ZrO2. So it would be concluded that 15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5 catalyst is potentially not a desirable one for the ODHP reaction. The mixed metal oxide catalyst (10Ga-10V-10Zr@ZSM-5) also showed a prominent performance for ODHP reaction with ∼85 % propylene selectivity and ∼37 % propane conversion (Fig. 11d). The smooth drop in the propylene selectivity compared to 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5 and 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 could be a result of the simultaneous presence of all three metal oxides in the same total wt. % that leads to the fewer acidic sites presented by vanadium oxide. Overall, the results from Fig. 11 show that all the manufactured catalysts monoliths exhibited an improved performance for the ODHP reaction in comparison with the other works with comparable catalysts [6]. Also, the 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 catalyst had the best performance among the four 3D-printed catalysts.

Table 3 shows the calculated TOF and reaction rate per catalyst weight for the ODHP reaction in the presence of CO2. The reaction rate is in the same range over all the monoliths while 15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5 had provided a relatively higher rate as a result of containing more acidic sites (sum of both Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites). The roughly equal values of TOF and reaction rate suggests that the reaction mechanism was diffusion-limited [48]. But investigating the selectivity of propylene shows that the Brønsted/Lewis acidic sites ratio is the least in 15Ga-15Zr@ZSM-5 as the selectivity of propylene is lower. Since the reaction rate over 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5 was the lowest, considering the results from NH3-TPD analysis, it could be suggested that the weak acidic sites are the determining factor in the rate of reaction. This is confirmed by the higher rate of reaction over zirconium containing monoliths. These values of TOF are higher than many of the catalysts used for ODHP reaction in the presence of CO2 that shows the high activity of the monoliths manufactured by the current method.

The results from the catalysis stability experiments in the absence of CO2 at 550 °C are shown in Fig. 12. As with the experiments in the presence of CO2, the catalytic performances of the monoliths were stable during the reaction. However, a small reduction in propane conversion and propylene selectivity was observed across all samples, which could be attributed to coke formation over the catalyst surface which would not be removed in the absence of CO2. As the tests in the presence of CO2, 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5, and 15V-15Zr@ZSM-5 showed the best performance for the propane dehydrogenation reaction in the absence of CO2. This is while CO2 enters the reverse Boudouard reaction and removes the formed coke by producing CO that is confirmed by the produced syngas composition (CO/H2 ratio) presented in Table S1 [49].

Table 4 shows the calculated TOF and reaction rate per catalyst weight for the propane dehydrogenation reaction in the absence of CO2. Like the reactions in the presence of CO2, the reaction rate without CO2 is in the same range for all the monoliths. As a comparison with CO2-assisted ODHP, the reaction rate was doubled in the absence of CO2, which could be attributed to the increase in propane concentration in the feed stream for the reactions without CO2. As before, all reaction rates were similar across the various monoliths, which again could be attributed to the mechanism being diffusion-limited [48]. The increase in the values of TOF is attributed to the increase in the initial propane concentration in the absence of CO2. All the TOF values are at a good level showing the potential catalytic activity of the 3D-printed monoliths for ODHP reaction even without CO2 as the oxidant.

4. Conclusions
This work demonstrated the applicability of 3D printing technology for producing highly active mixed metal oxide catalysts in a monolithic form that overcome the drawbacks associated with those manufactured by incipient impregnation, such as low propane conversion and poor active site availability. Dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the absence and presence of CO2 was investigated over 3D-printed gallium-, vanadium- and zirconium oxide doped HZSM-5 with different metal ratios. The best performance was observed in 15Ga-15V@ZSM-5 showed ∼40 % of propane conversion and ∼90 % of propylene selectivity, however, all of the monoliths investigated in this work exhibited a good performance in terms of stability. Moreover, there was no BTX produced in any of the samples examined herein, even without the use of CO2 as an oxidizing agent. The stability of all monolithic catalysts is also improved in the presence of CO2 due to the suppression of coke.
