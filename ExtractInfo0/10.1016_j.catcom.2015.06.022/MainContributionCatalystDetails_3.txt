 Unfortunately, this document does not appear to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document discusses aromatization of n-hexane over modified H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts, which is not directly related to converting propane to propylene. Since it does not pertain to PDH or ODH processes, I will not extract catalyst information or performance enhancements.
