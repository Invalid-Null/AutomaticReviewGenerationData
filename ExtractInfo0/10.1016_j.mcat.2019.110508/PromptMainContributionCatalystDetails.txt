1. Introduction
Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Up to now, PtSn [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]] and CrOx [[10], [11], [12], [13]] catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process. However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications. Besides, severe coke formation and sintering of active sites of them always need frequent regeneration. Therefore, the exploitation of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH is necessary and urgent.
Zn is generally regarded as an effective promoter of Pt based catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation to help improve the catalytic activity and stability [[14], [15], [16], [17]], and the independent catalytic activity of Zn catalysts in light alkane dehydrogenation reactions has only recently come to receive attention. Gong’s group [18] employed the Pt-modified ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst in PDH reaction, wherein the ZnO serving as Lewis acid sites (LAS) were the active phases while Pt only acted as promoter, which showed promising catalytic activity. Stair et al. [19] reported single-site Zn2+ supported on silica was an active catalyst for PDH, demonstrating that isolated Zn2+ species were the active sites in spite of weak catalytic activity. Our group [20] recently found that the ZnO nanoclusters in Al-free SiBeta support showed great catalytic activity in PDH, confirming that the Lewis acidic ZnO clusters possessed admirable catalytic ability. In short, isolated Zn2+ species and small bonded ZnO clusters were both reported to serve as LAS which were able to facilitate the heterolytic CH bond cleavage and simultaneously depressed the rupture of CC bond [[21], [22], [23]], and bulk ZnO was considered to be inactive in dehydrogenation reactions [24,25].
It is widely known that the catalytic activity of transition metal catalyst is greatly determined by the properties of supports, while the researches on ZnO catalysts supported on various materials in PDH are not enough. Thus, more in-depth investigations are needed to develop ZnO catalysts in PDH reaction. Gong et al. [26] found that ZnO modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites could catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane to some extent, and indicated that the framework Zn2+ and small bonded ZnmOn species were catalytically active sites while bulk ZnO was almost inactive. Thus, the Zn/ZSM-5 system is of great potential to be used for PDH. Unfortunately, Zn-modified regular HZSM-5 catalysts are mostly employed in the reactions of small alkane conversion to aromatics, wherein framework Zn2+ and Brønsted acid sites (BAS) have a synergy resulting in an enhanced catalytic activity in alkane conversion toward aromatics [22,23,[27], [28], [29]]. In alkane dehydrogenation reactions, the BAS in HZSM-5 are counterproductive by promoting the occurrence of side reactions [18,26,30,31]. Gao’s group [32] investigated the influence of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 zeolite on the catalytic performance of GaO in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (OPDH). It was concluded that rationally raising the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio had a positive effect on the propylene selectivity and reaction stability. They also demonstrated the superiority of ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 in OPDH [33], while they just put attention on the acid sites distributions of HZSM-5 and lacked analysis to Zn species. Herein, we put forward that this catalyst may similarly be of potential for PDH under oxygen-free condition [34,35], and focus on the comprehensive analysis of the ZnO catalyst supported on high-silica HZSM-5 in terms of active Zn species and the properties of HZSM-5.
In this work, ZnO catalysts supported on HZSM-5 zeolites (Zn/xHZSM-5, where x represents SiO2/Al2O3 ratio) were prepared by using impregnation method and tested in PDH. As a result, ZnO supported on the HZSM-5 zeolite with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (250) exhibited much better selectivity toward propylene and stability compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. The obtained Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts were systematically characterized by N2 sorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning and transmission electron microscopes (SEM and TEM), diffuse reflectance UV–vis (DR UV–vis), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), C3H6 and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (C3H6-TPD and NH3-TPD) and thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). The superiority of high-silica HZSM-5 in terms of structural and acidic properties were clearly clarified. Besides, the distribution and existent forms of Zn species as well as the nature of active Zn species were thoroughly analyzed. The facile and highly effective ZnO catalyst supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is environmentally friendly, low-cost and easy to be prepared, representing a promising propane dehydrogenation catalyst.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalyst preparation
HZSM-5 zeolites with varying molar SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (30, 50, 80 and 250) were provided by Tianjin Shenneng Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. The preparation procedure of Zn/xHZSM-5 catalyst as follows: 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 (Zn nominal loading is 10 wt%) catalysts were prepared by conventional impregnation method. At first, the powder HZSM-5 zeolite with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were impregnated with an aqueous solution of calculated Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, followed by stirring for 12 h under ambient temperature. The mixtures were then dried at 80 °C in air overnight. The as-prepared samples were calcined at 600 °C for 6 h in air atmosphere. The resultant catalysts were named as 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 (x = 30, 50, 80, 250, where x represents the ratio of SiO2/Al2O3). Three additional 10 wt% Zn supported on silicalite-1 (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio = 1500), Al2O3 (230 m2 g−1) and SiO2 (300 m2 g−1) samples were prepared for comparison purposes, being named as 10%Zn/S-1, 10%Zn/Al2O3 and 10%Zn/SiO2, respectively.
The preparation method of Zn/250HZSM-5 catalysts with different Zn loadings as follows: The Zn/250HZSM-5 with different Zn loadings named as yZn/250HZSM-5 (y represents the nominal Zn loading amount) were also prepared by conventional impregnation method. 1 g of powder 250HZSM-5 zeolite was impregnated with a solution of calculated amounts of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (the nominal weight of Zn is 3%, 7%, 10%, 15% of the HZSM-5 zeolites), the following steps were the same as above preparation processes of Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts.
2.2. Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were carried out on a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5406 Å). N2 adsorption − desorption isotherms were tested on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 sorption analyzer at 77 K. Before the analysis, the samples were degassed at 200 °C for 8 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted on JSM-7800 at 15 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was tested on a Jeol JEM-2800 microscope at 200 kV. Diffuse reflectance UV–vis (DR UV–vis) spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV2450 spectrometer by using BaSO4 as white standards. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were obtained on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer, which was equipped a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray source. The reported binding energies have been corrected by referring to C1s at 284.8 eV. The ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) profiles were obtained on a Quantachrome ChemBET-3000 analyzer. 100 mg of sample was pretreated at 600 °C for 1 h in He atmosphere, and then the sample was saturated with NH3 at 80 °C for 30 min. After that, the experiments were conducted in He from 80 °C to 750 °C. Similarly, the property of obtained catalysts to desorb propylene was tested by C3H6-TPD on the Quantachrome ChemBET-3000 analyzer, Samples (0.1 g) were pretreatment in Ar atmosphere at 600 °C for 1 h then cooled down to 70 °C. The catalysts were kept in pure propylene gas flow (30 ml min−1) for 30 min at 70 °C, and then were washed with flowing He for 1 h. Afterwards, C3H6-TPD experiments were conducted in He atmosphere from 70 °C to 550 °C. The thermogravimetric thermal analysis (TGA) were performed on a TA SDT Q600 instrument from ambient temperature to 750 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min-1 in flowing air.
2.3. Activity test
The activity test was carried out in a fixed-bed quartz tube microreactor (inner diameter, 6 mm) at atmospheric pressure, which is packed with 0.1 or 0.2 g of catalyst particles in the isothermal zone of the reactor by using two quartz wool plugs. A thermocouple inserted into the catalyst bed was employed to measure the reaction temperature. The reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (SP-6890) with a GDX-01 column and a flame ionization detector (FID). The optimum propane dehydrogenation temperature with respect to thermodynamic constraints was observed to be 600 °C. The other reaction conditions were established in the activity tests: the operation pressure, 0.1 MPa; the total flow rate of gas reactant, 20 cm3 min−1 (5 vol% propane in N2). The propane conversion (Cpropane), propylene selectivity (Spropylene) and propylene yield (Ypropylene) were calculated by using the following equations based on a carbon atom balance method:
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Properties characterizations of Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts
The structural properties of bare HZSM-5 zeolites with varying SiO2/Al2O3 ratios and 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts were analyzed by using of powder XRD patterns, wherein all the samples exhibit typical MFI diffraction peaks of ZSM-5 zeolite. The crystallization degree of bare HZSM-5 increases with the increasing SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, as proved by the intensification of XRD patterns in Fig. 1a. Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of pure ZnO, bare 250HZSM-5 and the 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts. The characteristic MFI structure preserves well in 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts, suggesting the introduction of Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites has little effect on the geometric structure of HZSM-5 support. In addition, no diffraction lines related to ZnO crystallite (JCPDS card No. 36-1451) are seen in 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts, attributed to the highly dispersed Zn species [29]. The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 is taken as the representative sample to observe the structural change of bare HZSM-5 after loading Zn species. Unavoidably, a slight decrease of crystallinity of the 250HZSM-5 zeolite is observed in the presence of Zn species. As to the Zn/250HZSM-5 catalysts with different Zn loadings (Fig. S1), three crystalline phase signals (2θ = 31.7, 34.5 and 36.2°) of ZnO can be noticed when the Zn loading reaches 15%, indicating the growth of ZnO as raising the Zn loading. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distribution curves of Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts are presented in Fig. S2. And the pore structure parameters of bare HZSM-5 and 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts are listed in Table 1. All of bare HZSM-5 zeolites with the specific surface areas higher than 320 m2 g−1 and total pore volumes larger than 0.31 cm3 g−1. A slight reduction of surface area and total pore volume is observed for 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts after loading with Zn, because that the introduced zinc species block a partial of nanopores [36]. Noticeably, the specific surface area of 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 increases with the elevated SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support, so is the total pore volume, which are favor of dispersing Zn species.

Fig. 2a-b display the SEM images of bare 250HZSM-5 and 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst, respectively. The regular cubic morphology of 250HZSM-5 presented in Fig. 2a is favor of dispersing the Zn species [31]. No agglomerated ZnO particles are observed on the surface of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst under high magnification after loading with 10% of Zn (Fig. 2b). The slightly low crystalline degrees of 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratios can be determined from the irregular morphology structures presented in Fig. S3, in consistence with above XRD results. Clearer structure information of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 is seen in the TEM image (Fig. 2c), wherein few ultrafine nanocrystals with the sizes of approximately 4–6 nm are dispersed on the catalyst. The high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image in Fig. 2c (inset) shows the lattice fringe with interplanar distance of 0.248 nm, ascribed to the (101) plane of ZnO crystalline [37]. The contrastive TEM images and the corresponding particle size distributions of 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 are exhibited in Fig. S4. Zn species on the HZSM-5 with higher SiO2/Al2O3 ratio possess smaller particle sizes and better dispersity, especially for the 10%Zn/250HZSM-5. The particle sizes of Zn species in 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 (30/50/80/250) catalysts are mainly distributed in 15.37 ± 3.3, 9.58 ± 2.3, 8.86 ± 1.7 and 4.53 ± 2.7 nm, respectively. This indicates that the distribution and particle sizes of Zn species are related to the structure of HZSM-5 support. Small and well dispersed Zn species are obtained on the high-silica HZSM-5 support, which is further exhibited by SEM-EDS elemental mapping images (Fig. 2d-h). Clearly, four kinds of elements, including Si, O, Al, and Zn, distribute well throughout the whole selected area, revealing a good dispersion of Zn species.

Fig. 3 presents the DR UV–vis spectra of the prepared catalysts, three main absorption bands located at 195, 230 and 368 nm are clearly identified. The band at 195 nm becomes more stronger as the decreasing SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, and is taken as the distinguishing proof of the incorporation of Zn into the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite via isomorphous substitution, because higher content of Al atoms in low-silica HZSM-5 easily lead to the formation of ion-exchanged Zn2+ [38]. The band of around 230 nm is assigned to the Zn species interacted with framework O atoms of the zeolite [34,38], so the strongest intensity of it in 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 indicates the presence of massive bonded ZnO clusters with small sizes [39]. The band at 368 nm is ascribed to the O2−→Zn2+ ligand to metal charge transfer transition, related to the band gap width of bulk ZnO [34]. With the decrease of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, the band at 368 nm is stronger that indicates more bulk ZnO forms on the low-silica HZSM-5 support.

The Zn 2p XPS spectra of 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts in Fig. 4a present characteristic peak located at around 1023 eV without any obvious tendency, and the corresponding surface Zn content are listed in Table S1. The surface Zn content obtained from Zn 2p XPS results decreases from 61.68% for 10%Zn/30HZSM-5 to 17.93% for 10%Zn/250HZSM-5, in spite of the same nominal Zn loading, indicating that more Zn species are located inside the high-silica zeolite channel which is in line with previous report [36]. The Zn LMM spectra of 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts were recorded and displayed in Fig. 4b, which can easily discern the different Zn chemical environments compared with Zn 2p spectra [40]. These spectra are divided into two peaks of around 986 and 989 eV over all samples, due to the Zn2+ species in different chemical environments. The peak at about 986 eV is attributed to the interaction between Zn species and lattice O in the framework of HZSM-5 [28,41]. In line with previous reports, metal oxides or ions could partially insert into the scaffold of HZSM-5 framework by forming -O-M-O- or M(OH)+ bridge in the locations of BAS [42,43]. For comparison purpose, two kinetic energy peaks of Zn in pure ZnO located at 988.60 and 991.90 eV are depicted in Fig. S5. The kinetic energy peaks of 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 shift toward lower position with the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, indicating more bonded Zn species are obtained on high-silica HZSM-5 support [44]. At present, Al2O3 and SiO2 are the most prevailing supports in many catalyst systems. As exhibited in Fig. 4c, the kinetic energies of Zn over 10%Zn/Al2O3 catalyst are 987.00 and 990.38 eV, and over 10%Zn/SiO2 are 986.28 and 989.54 eV. Obviously, they are above than that of the 10%Zn/250HZSM-5, due to the lack of tightly bonded ZnO species.

NH3-TPD curves were measured to detect the strength and distribution of acid sites in samples. The NH3-TPD profiles of the 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts are presented in Fig. 5, and the corresponding quantified titration results are tabulated in Table S2. All the NH3-TPD profiles of bare xHZSM-5 (Fig. S6a), presenting a low-temperature peak (LT, T < 300 °C) and a high-temperature peak (HT, T > 300 °C). Generally, the LT and HT peaks are related to weak and strong acidic sites, respectively [34,42]. After loading with Zn species, the kinds and strength of acidic sites have obviously changed. As shown in Fig. S6b, the LT peak of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 is widened to form a new shoulder peak located at around 300 °C, which is ascribed to the NH3 desorption from medium acidic sites [36]. In the same time, the intensity of NH3 desorption peak of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 in HT region is lower than that of bare 250HZSM-5, indicating that the impregnated Zn species poison the strong acidic sites of HZSM-5. The acidity of 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 in Fig. 5a decreases as increasing the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, in accordance with that of bare xHZSM-5 (Fig. S6a). The NH3 desorption amounts as a function of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio are exhibited in Fig. 5b. The total acidity declines from 0.1616 to 0.0527 mmolNH3 g−1 with the increasing SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 from 30 to 250. The decrease of total acidic sites can lead to the suppression of side reactions and coke formation. The α, β and γ peaks, corresponding to weak, medium and strong acidity respectively, present parallel trends. The decrease trend is more evident for strong acid sites, because that the strong acid sites on Zn/HZSM-5 are directly related to the number of framework Al atoms. While, the decrease trend of NH3 desorption is milder for medium acidic sites, similar phenomenon was seen on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalyst [32], because the strong interaction between ZnO species and the HZSM-5 zeolite with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio enhances the Lewis acid strength with medium acidity.

The propylene selectivity is directly related to the interaction of C3H6 with the 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 catalyst, which can be examined by the mean of C3H6-TPD. The C3H6 desorption profiles are displayed in Fig. 6. The C3H6 desorption curves of all catalysts exhibit the main peaks at different temperatures, and the desorption temperature can be used to evaluate the interaction strength between C3H6 and catalyst. Evidently, the desorption peak with maximal temperature is more intensive and shifts to higher temperature with the decreasing SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support, suggesting the high content of Al atoms increases the amount of absorbed C3H6 and strengthens the adsorption which can favor the aromatization of C3H6 molecules [45]. The C3H6 desorption peak in the spectrum of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 at about 254 °C is weak, indicating most of C3H6 immediately desorbed as soon as it was produced. So, the ZnO catalyst on high-silica HZSM-5 support with weak ability of interacting with the C3H6 molecule can greatly improve the C3H6 selectivity and reaction stability for PDH.

3.2. Catalytic performance
The activity tests of the 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts in PDH were carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 7, Fig. 8 and Table 1. The activity test results over the contrastive catalysts (10%Zn/SiO2 and 10%Zn/Al2O3) are depicted in Fig. S7, and both of them are almost inactive for PDH. In Fig. 7, the propane conversions of all catalysts increase to the maximum values in the first 30 min, and then decrease at different deactivation rates. 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratios possess high propane conversions in the beginning of reaction, wherein most of propane convert to side products (methane, ethane and ethene). As shown in Fig. S8, the selectivities of side products of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 are evidently lower than that of low-silica 10%Zn/xHZSM-5. By contrast, the propylene selectivity of the 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 is significantly high and very stable during the reaction progress. The 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 shows the lowest propane conversion from the onset of reaction, whereas its propylene selectivity is the best among all the as-prepared samples. As reported in Table S1, the max propylene yields during the reaction process of 27.70%, 32.94%, 36.00% and 52.09% can be achieved over the 10%Zn/30HZSM-5, 10%Zn/50HZSM-5, 10%Zn/80HZSM-5 and 10%Zn/250HZSM-5, respectively, showing the influence of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 on the overall catalytic performance of PDH. Additionally, increasing the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio leads to the reduction of deactivation rate. For the 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst, the conversion decreases from an initial value of 74% to 45% after 10 h of reaction, 25% lower, while the conversion of 10%Zn/30HZSM-5 changes from 85% to 15%. Thus, the high-silica HZSM-5 employed to support ZnO catalyst results in a great reaction stability.

Fig. 8 presents the propane conversions and propylene selectivities of Zn/250HZSM-5 catalysts in PDH with different Zn loading amounts. The reference sample of bare 250HZSM-5 shows low propane conversion and propylene selectivity in Fig. S9: less than 30% of propane is reacted at 600 °C, and the corresponding propylene selectivity is also lower than 30%. At low Zn loading amounts, the propane conversion (Fig. 8a) increases with the increase of Zn loading amounts, and reaches the maximum conversion (75%) in 30 min when Zn loading reaches 10 wt%. However, once the Zn loading exceeds 10 wt%, the initial propane conversion decreases with the elevated Zn loadings probably due to the formation of crystallite ZnO. The propylene selectivities of these samples possess similar variation tendency in Fig. 8b, tending to be stable at about 90% as the reaction goes on. Besides, 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst shows slightly enhanced propylene selectivity in comparison with the other Zn/250HZSM-5 catalysts. The result indicates that 10 wt% is the optimal loading for Zn of Zn/250HZSM-5 catalysts, which shows the best overall catalytic performance. In comparison with those reported Pt and CrOx based catalysts (Table S3), this optimal catalyst is upper middle level.
The used catalyst was refreshed at 600 °C for 2 h in air, intending to get rid of the formed coke. The cycling testing results of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 in PDH are presented in Fig. 9a. After three times cycling experiments, a slight decrease of initial propane conversion from 72.9% to 60.7% is observed. Noticeably, the propylene selectivity of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst keeps steady in a high position of around 90% without obvious loss, suggesting the good reuse performance of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst. Also the main factor for the deactivation of Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst is coking deposition, which can cover active sites and block pore channels [42,46,47].

In order to clarify the high stability of high-silica HZSM-5 support, the coke contents on the spent 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts were investigated by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air from ambient temperature to 750 °C. The coke deposited on all the samples is reported in Table 1. Two weight loss stages for all catalysts can be seen in Fig. 9b. The first weight loss stage at about 100 °C is ascribed to the physically adsorbed water, while the major weight loss in the range of 450 to 655 °C can be attributed to the coke combustion. The coke content decreases with the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, the sample of 10%Zn/250 HZSM-5 shows the least coke content of around 6.7% after 10 h time on stream, while the coke content of 10%Zn/30HZSM-5 is about 13.8%. Consequently, the high-silica HZSM-5 with low acidity greatly minimizes coke deposition during the reaction of PDH at high temperature, and thus, obtaining a long-term reaction stability in PDH.
3.3. Discussion
Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts prepared in this work possess an extensive heterogeneity of Zn species, which are mainly divided into small Zn species (include ion-exchanged Zn2+ and bonded ZnO clusters) and bulk ZnO [26]. The well-crystalline structure of high-silica HZSM-5, with high specific surface area and large pore volume, greatly promotes the Zn distributions and minimizes the sizes of ZnO particles. Also, the DR UV–vis and Zn 2p XPS results evidenced that high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite accommodate more Zn species inside the zeolite channel and result in less ZnO aggregates existing on the external surface. The maximum propylene yield during reaction process and surface Zn content are depicted as a function of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in Fig. S10. With the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, the maximum propylene yield increases while the surface Zn content decreases. Therefore, small ZnO bonded to the zeolite framework or localized inside the channel are active sites, while bulk ZnO only present on the external surface is inactive for PDH [26].
In addition to the Zn species distribution, the acidity of Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst is equally crucial to the catalytic behavior for PDH. The Zn/HZSM-5 with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio has low acidity, which is really helpful for improving propylene selectivity by depressing side reactions [5,48]. Noticeably, the Zn species introduction can reduce total acidic sites of Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst, and meanwhile, create Lewis acidic sites which are derived from the Zn species bonding to the zeolite framework [5,14]. The C3H6-TPD result reveals that the high-silica 10%Zn/250HZSM-5 catalyst has weak interaction with propylene, which can facilitate propylene desorption and thus improve propylene selectivity and reaction stability [45,49]. The evident proof can be seen from the catalytic performances of 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts with lower propane conversions in a higher WHSV, as shown in Fig. S11, in which the propylene selectivity constantly increases as increasing the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. No Al atoms in silicalite-1 support leads to much lower propane conversion than the 10%Zn/250HZSM-5, in spite of the high propylene selectivity (Fig. S12). So, the presence of Al atoms may have two contrary roles for PDH: The positive role is to increase the chance of bonding metal species, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalysts deactivation due to the strong acidity.
The activity test results show that the catalytic performance of Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst is enhanced as raising the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. Further increasing the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio to 1500 results in a decrease of propane conversion, suggesting there is a trade-off between framework Al atoms and active Zn species. The ZnO supported on the silicalite-1 without Al sites still shows a certain of catalytic activity for PDH, indicating the intrinsic activity of bonded ZnO species, which is inconsistent with the reports that only the Zn2+ at ion-exchange position has the catalytic ability for PDH [21,26]. ZnO supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports are inactive for PDH, which can be clarified with the lack of bonded ZnO clusters based on above XPS result. Also, the DR UV–vis spectra of 10%Zn/Al2O3 and 10%Zn/SiO2 in Fig. S13 show the significant characteristic band of bulk ZnO, which is very different from that of 10%Zn/250HZSM-5. The catalytic activity of the small ZnO clusters interacted with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite is thus confirmed, in line with some precedent reports [20,50], although the clear reaction mechanism needs in-depth investigation. In combination with above characterizations, the high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support, with low Al content and good structural properties, shows positive effects on the catalytic performance of ZnO in PDH by providing appropriate acidic condition, dispersing Zn species and having strong interaction with the supported Zn species.
4. Conclusions
In this work, a series of ZnO catalysts supported on HZSM-5 (Zn/HZSM-5) with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were prepared for PDH reaction by simple impregnation method. The structural and acidic properties of xHZSM-5 were varied and had great influence on the catalytic performance of Zn/HZSM-5 in PDH. ZnO supported on the high-silica HZSM-5 was found to be an efficient catalyst for PDH as compared to the ZnO catalysts on other supports (e.g. low-silica HZSM-5, silicalite-1, Al2O3 and SiO2). The high specific surface area and large pore volume, well-defined structure and sparse Al sites in the high-silica HZSM-5 cause Zn species distribute well throughout the support, which is directly related to the catalytic activity, while ZnO supported on low-silica HZSM-5 is prone to aggregate into bulk ZnO on the zeolite external surface. Also, the well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 can significantly improve the propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting the propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions. Moreover, the catalytic activity of small bonded ZnO clusters in the PDH reaction is proposed. This catalyst system of ZnO loaded on high-silica HZSM-5 exhibits great catalytic activity and reaction stability, offering a thinking for designing highly-efficient transition metal catalysts for PDH reaction.
