Abstract
Ethane direct dehydrogenation (EDH) is of great importance for shale gas utilization. However, the development of highly active and stable catalyst is still challenge in this process. Here, to guide the establishment of a desired Rh-based catalyst for EDH to ethylene, fifteen catalysts RhxM (M=Cu, Ag, Au) (x=1, 2, 3, 6, 9) are designed and their catalytic performance for EDH are systematically studied by using density functional theory calculations. The computational results disclose that the aggregation form of active Rh atoms (ensemble effect) dominates the catalytic performance, rather than the d-band center, electron transfer and the effects of the second metal substrate. The catalysts Rh1Cu, Rh1Au, and Rh2Ag show the best catalytic performance among the catalysts with different metal substrate. Typically, the low-cost catalyst Rh1Cu with surface single-atom Rh in the non-noble metal Cu not only performs improved activity and selectivity for forming ethylene but also resists the coking. Interestingly, the catalyst Rh3M (M=Cu, Ag, Au) has poor C2H4 selectivity and coking resistance due to itself ensemble effect. This study gives a theoretical guidance for regulating the catalytic performance through the ensemble effect of active site metal atoms in ethane direct dehydrogenation.

1. Introduction
In recent years, as a rich resource, shale gas has been widely developed due to its high methane content of 80−90 mol% [1], [2], [3], [4], in which ethane is also the main associated gas component that can be converted to ethylene as a valuable chemical precursor for various chemical and polymer products. Meanwhile, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODH) is thermodynamically favorable and anti-coking, which can be proceed at a lower temperature [5,6], while once the C–H bond of alkane is activated, its oxidation products are difficult to be suppressed, as the excessive oxidation to CO or CO2 is more thermodynamically advantageous, leading to the decreasing selectivity of olefin. Ethane direct dehydrogenation (EDH) can achieve high ethylene selectivity. However, EDH is thermodynamically limited and generally must be carried out at high temperature [7,8].
Nowadays, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively used in industry because of their excellent catalytic performance in EDH to ethylene. However, coke formation was still a major drawback of this process, leading to the catalyst deactivation [9], [10], [11]. Thus, it is of great significance to develop highly active, low-temperature catalysts to produce ethylene via EDH and improve coking resistance and keep better ethylene selectivity. In recent years, although Rh was not a typical catalyst used for alkane dehydrogenation, it has potential activity toward alkane dehydrogenation at low temperature. For example, the theoretical and experimental studies [12] proved that single-atom Rh1Cu alloy could exhibit a low energy barrier for the activation and dissociation of C–H bonds and avoid propane over-dehydrogenation that leads to coke formation, which makes propane direct dehydrogenation at lower temperature and the high conversion rate. Maestri et al. [13] investigated CH4 steam reforming and dry reforming on the Rh catalyst, which could directly break the C–H bond of methane. Kwon et al. [14] synthesized a single-atom Rh catalyst dispersed over ZrO2 surface, which could effectively activate the first C–H bond of methane. Chang et al. [15] investigated propane direct dehydrogenation over Rh13-Ls (low-symmetry Rh13 cluster), Rh13-Ls/UGO (Rh13-Ls cluster supported on a sheet of unzipped graphene oxide), and Rh13-Ls/TiO2 catalysts, indicating that Rh13-Ls/UGO could facilitate the C–H bond activation in the dissociation of the alkanes. Jay et al. [16] investigated the variations in the oxidation state, valence-orbital energies, and character, ranging from the femtosecond Rh-alkane bond formation to the nanosecond C–H bond cleavage, which revealed how the metal-to-alkane back-donation facilitates the C–H bond cleavage via oxidative addition. Raman et al. [17] found a strong boost of Rh-induced C–H bond cleavage activity was under the reaction conditions.
As mentioned above, Rh atoms dispersed in the Cu crystal could realize propane direct dehydrogenation at low temperature and achieve high propylene selectivity and high stability, meanwhile, RhCu alloy has a better anti-carbon deposition and anti-coking ability compared to the pure Cu [12]. Moreover, the tunability of the binding capacity of adsorbed species on the alloy mainly depends on the ensemble effect [18,19]. The surface ensemble form of Rh-based bimetallic catalysts, i.e., the aggregation of active site, obviously affects catalytic performance [20,21]. These studies suggested that Rh-based catalysts may be acted as an available alternative of Pt-based catalysts.
Both Ag and Au alloy has a similar anti-carbon deposition and anti-coking ability with Cu alloy. Numerous reported studies showed that RhAg and RhAu catalysts could be prepared using microwave-assisted methods [22], [23], [24]. García et al. [25] showed that the ensemble effect leads to thinner and more active Rh aggregates when forming alloys with Ag or Au. Li et al. [26] demonstrated that the ensemble and electronic effects of RhAu alloy NPs could be used to tune the binding energy of oxygen and hydroxyl groups, and the Rh1Au2 triatomic aggregates were active in the oxidation–reduction reaction. Li and Henkelman [27] found that the initial selectivity on the surface of X/Au (X=Pd and Rh) alloys toward EtOH dehydrogenation mainly depended on the size and shape of atomic group, and the clique effect can effectively control the selectivity of EtOH dehydrogenation. Li et al. [28] found that the atomic ensemble effect was the main factor that affects the surface catalysis of strongly and weakly-bound alloys, which determined catalytic activity and selectivity of the reactions. Thus, it is possible to dope Rh with different aggregation form into the surface of Cu, Ag and Au to improve their catalytic performance toward ethane dehydrogenation. Meanwhile, Rh has higher activity than Pt in the direct dehydrogenation of alkanes at low temperature, but it still exhibits similar anti-coking ability and selectivity to Pt. Thus, the introduction of Cu, Ag or Au as a second metal substrate may effectively avoid carbon deposition and exhibit good anti-sintering and anti-coking performance in the alkane dehydrogenation. Furthermore, the aggregation state of the active metal atoms on the surface of alloy catalyst was crucial for the adjustment of catalytic activity, selectivity, and anti-coking ability. However, up to now, in the catalytic system of ethane direct dehydrogenation over RhxM (M=Cu, Ag, Au) surface alloy catalyst, the influence of surface Rh aggregation form on the activity, selectivity, and stability is still unclear; moreover, the intrinsic nature of surface Rh aggregation form in tuning catalytic performance of EDH is desired to be clarified [29], [30], [31].
To solve above issues, this study fully investigated the underlying mechanism of EDH over fifteen types of RhxM (x=1, 2, 3, 6, 9; M=Cu, Ag, Au) surface alloy catalysts, in which different aggregation states of Rh atoms are considered as active sites to identify the role of Rh aggregation effect in tuning catalytic performance of EDH and obtain the most suitable aggregation state of Rh with the best catalytic performance in the RhxM surface alloy catalysts. Our results are expected to provide valuable structural clues for designing the catalysts with high activity, high selectivity, and high stability in EDH at low temperature.
2. Computational methods and models
2.1. Calculation methods
Dmol3 module in Materials Studio 8.0 software was used for all DFT calculations [32,33]. The exchange-correlation function Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) were used to calculate the electronic structure [34,35]. The k-points in the Brillouin zone were set to 2×2×1. The convergence accuracy and SCF iteration error of the basic functions were at the medium level; the corresponding convergence criteria for the energy, maximum displacement, and maximum force were 2.0 × 10−5 Ha, 5.0 × 10−3 Å, and 4.0 × 10−3 Ha/Å, respectively. The smearing width was set to 0.005 Ha. The H, CH2, CH3 and C2Hx (x = 3–6) species adopt an all-electron basis set; Rh, Cu, Ag and Au adopt an effective core potential (ECP) [36]. The valence electron wave function adopted a double numerical plus polarization (DNP) [37]. At the same time, the complete linear synchronous transit (LST) and quadratic synchronous transit (QST) methods were used to search for the transition states [38], [39], [40]. The methods of Frequency Analysis and TS Confirmation were performed to verify the reliability of transition state. Furthermore, EDH to ethylene is usually carried out at a temperature ≥873 K [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]. Thus, the temperature 873 K was considered in this study.
2.2. RhxM catalyst models with different aggregation states
For the face-centered cubic metal M (M=Cu, Ag and Au), the (111) crystal plane is the most stable and primary exposed surface [48], [49], [50], [51]. Thus, the four-layer and p(4 × 4) M(111) supercell size with sixteen surface M atoms was adopted to present the metal M catalyst, in which the bottom two layers were fixed, and the top two layers with the adsorbed species were relaxed. To remove the layer-to-layer interactions in the surface model, a vacuum thickness of 15 Å was set.
To explore the role of surface Rh aggregation state in tuning the activity, selectivity, and anti-coking ability during ethane direct dehydrogenation over RhxM (M=Cu, Ag, and Au) catalysts, the M atoms on the M(111) catalyst with sixteen surface M atoms were replaced by the corresponding 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 Rh atoms to form different types of surface Rh aggregation state, as presented in Fig. 1, which were used to model RhxM (M=Cu, Ag and Au) catalysts, and named as Rh1M, Rh2M, Rh3M, Rh6M, and Rh9M catalysts, respectively.

3. Results and discussion
The possible reaction pathway for ethane dehydrogenation on the catalyst is shown in Fig. 2. First, for EDH to ethylene, C2H6 was adsorbed on the catalyst surface, then, the first dehydrogenation step C2H6→C2H5+H produces C2H5*, followed by its dehydrogenation to form C2H4*. Finally, the desorption of adsorbed C2H4* generates gas phase C2H4. All the calculated energy of elementary reactions involved in EDH were listed in Table 1. The results show that the energy barriers of C–C bond breaking of C2H6, C2H5, and C2H4 were much higher than those of their dehydrogenation reactions, namely, the influence of C–C bond cleavage on C2H4 selectivity over RhxM (M=Cu, Ag and Au) catalysts was negligible. Thus, along EDH to ethylene, two processes affect C2H4 selectivity, one is C2H5* dehydrogenation to form CHCH3* or C2H4*, the other is C2H4* desorption or C2H4* dehydrogenation to C2H3*.

It should be noted that the production of CHCH3*, C2H3*, and CHx* (CH2* and CH3*) all can reduce the selectivity and yield of ethylene. Previous studies also showed that the CHCH3* and C2H3* intermediate were the precursors of coking formation in EDH, in which the C–C bond cleavage to form CHx* will result in carbon deposition [52,53]. Namely, three possible formation pathways exist for coking precursor: one is the dehydrogenation of C2H5 intermediate to CHCH3*, the second is the dehydrogenation of C2H4* to C2H3*, and the third is the C–C bond cleavage of C2H6, C2H5, or C2H4 to generate the coking precursors CHx* (CH2* and CH3*). However, our results show that the energy barriers of C–C bond breaking reactions for C2H6, C2H5 and C2H4 were much higher than those of their dehydrogenation reactions over RhxM (M=Cu, Ag and Au) catalysts, as shown behind, thus, only two reactions of C2H5→C2H4→C2H3 and C2H5→CHCH3 were considered as the main coking pathways. If C2H4* was difficult to desorb and easily dehydrogenated into C2H3*, the main coking pathway was C2H5→C2H4→C2H3; if C2H3* formation was difficult, that was C2H5→CHCH3.
3.1. Hydrogen adsorption on the RhxM surface
Previous studies by Li et al. [54] found that strong-binding transition metals such as Pd and Rh tend to over-bind H, leading to the difficult of H desorption that hinders the formation of ethylene, while weak-binding transition metals (e.g., Ag, Au, Cu) bind H too weakly, thus, alloying these strong and weak-binding elements together could tune the adsorption strength of H, providing the ideal H binding ability for ethane dehydrogenation. Zheng et al. [55] demonstrated that certain bimetallic atomic ensembles significantly lower the kinetic barriers of hydrogen associative desorption, and an ensemble alloy rich in Au/Ag/Cu with a small proportion of strong-binding metal effectively promote the hydrogen associative desorption. Furthermore, Zheng et al. [56] also suggest that H adsorption at the metal-atop site is not determined only by the D-band center.
Based on above analysis, the combination of metal Rh with the second metal M (M=Cu, Ag, Au) form the surface alloy catalyst, on which H atom will have different adsorption energy due to different types of metal promoter and different aggregation of active sites. In our present study, when H atoms have large adsorption energy, it is difficult to combine and desorb to form H2(g), their accumulation will occupy active sites of RhxM and affect the activity, as shown in Fig. 3, the relationship between Rh aggregation number of active sites and H adsorption energy showed that at 873 K and 1 atm, with the increasing of Rh aggregation number of active sites, the more energy is required for H desorption, the adsorbed H is difficult to combine and desorb to form H2(g), namely, that the larger surface Rh aggregation state on the catalysts RhxCu, RhxAg and RhxAu (x=1, 2, 3, 6, 9) was unfavorable for hydrogen migration. Meanwhile, H adsorption energy increases with the proximity of d-band center to the Fermi level, in which only Rh3Cu and Rh3Ag exhibited an exception, showing a weak H adsorption energy, deviating from the established pattern. Thus, H adsorption is not solely influenced by electronic properties but also affected by the aggregation effect. Our results agree with those of above three reported studies [54], [55], [56].

3.2. Ethane dehydrogenation on the catalysts RhxM (x=1, 2, 3, 6, and 9)
On Rh1Cu, as shown in Fig. 4, the activation and reaction free energies of C2H6→C2H5+H are 63.8 and 16.1 kJ∙mol−1, respectively. Then, the activation free energies of C2H5→C2H4+H and C2H5→CHCH3+H are 22.1 and 97.2 kJ∙mol−1 with the corresponding reaction free energies of −25.1 and 38.1 kJ∙mol−1, respectively, which means that C2H4 formation is favored both kinetically and thermodynamically than CHCH3 formation. Meanwhile, C2H4 desorption energy is 12.6 kJ∙mol−1, the activation and reaction free energies of C2H4→C2H3+H are 133.7 and 48.9 kJ∙mol−1, respectively, as a result, C2H4 desorption is kinetically easier than its dehydrogenation. Furthermore, the activation free energies for the C–C bond cleavage of C2H6, C2H5 and C2H4 to generate CH2 and CH3 are 238.4, 206.2 and 222.7 kJ∙mol−1, respectively, which are much higher than their dehydrogenation reactions, that is, the C–C bond cleavage is more difficult; thus, the C–C bond cleavage of C2H6, C2H5 and C2H4 to form coking precursors CH2 and CH3 is not favored compared to their dehydrogenation reactions.

Fig. 4. Potential energy diagram of ethane direct dehydrogenation with the structures of the initial, transition and final states over Rh1Cu catalyst.
Above results show that the Rh1Cu catalyst not only promotes the formation of gaseous C2H4, but also inhibits the formation of coking precursors C2H3, CHCH3, CH2 and CH3, which facilitates EDH to ethylene. Meanwhile, the reactive species over Rh1Cu catalyst mainly interacts with the Rh atom as active site.
Similarly, the detailed descriptions over other fourteen catalysts are described in the Supplementary Material. The results reveal that C2H4 formation over eleven types of catalysts Rh2Cu, Rh6Cu, Rh9Cu, Rh1Ag, Rh2Ag, Rh6Ag, Rh9Ag, Rh1Au, Rh2Au, Rh6Au, and Rh9Au is kinetically favored in comparison with CHCH3 formation. However, CHCH3 formation over other three types of catalysts Rh3Cu, Rh3Ag, and Rh3Au is more beneficial both kinetically and thermodynamically compared to C2H4 formation. On the other hand, C2H4 desorption over twelve types of Rh2Cu, Rh3Cu, Rh6Cu, Rh9Cu, Rh1Ag, Rh2Ag, Rh3Ag, Rh6Ag, Rh9Ag, Rh1Au, Rh2Au and Rh6Au catalysts is easier than C2H4 dehydrogenation. However, C2H4 desorption over catalysts Rh3Au and Rh9Au is difficult in comparison with its dehydrogenation. Furthermore, for all catalysts, the C–C bond cleavage of C2H6, C2H5 or C2H4 to form coking precursors CH2 and CH3 is not favored compared to their dehydrogenation.
Based on above analysis, eleven types of catalysts Rh1Cu, Rh2Cu, Rh6Cu, Rh9Cu, Rh1Ag, Rh2Ag, Rh6Ag, Rh9Ag, Rh1Au, Rh2Au and Rh6Au not only promote the formation of gaseous C2H4, but also inhibits the formation of coking precursors C2H3, CHCH3, CH2, and CH3, which facilitates EDH to produce ethylene. However, four types of catalysts Rh3Cu, Rh3Ag, Rh3Au and Rh9Au neither produce gaseous C2H4 nor inhibit the formation of coking precursors CHCH3 and C2H3, which present the poor catalytic performance toward EDH to ethylene. Meanwhile, for the Rh1M catalysts, the adsorption and reaction of C2Hn (n = 3–6) always occur at the single Rh atom as active site. In the system with multiple Rh atoms, C2Hn (n=3–6) is still mainly adsorbed at the top site or bridge site consisted of one or more Rh atoms.
3.3. Catalytic activity of EDH over RhxM catalysts
Over fifteen types of catalysts RhxM, the total activation free energy of EDH to ethylene (C2H6→C2H5→C2H4) was used to evaluate C2H4 formation activity. The smaller total activation free energy means the higher C2H4 formation activity.
As shown in Fig. 5, C2H4 formation activity (kJ∙mol–1) follows the order of Rh1Cu (63.8)>Rh2Cu (83.2)>Rh6Cu (85.3)>Rh3Cu (86.2)>Rh9Cu (94.1) in the RhxCu catalysts. Rh2Ag (63.3)>Rh6Ag (72.1)>Rh3Ag (85.6)>Rh1Ag (96.8)>Rh9Ag (107.0) in the RhxAg catalysts; Rh1Au (45.3)>Rh9Au (59.8)>Rh6Au (71.7)>Rh2Au (80.0)> Rh3Au (104.5) in the RhxAu catalysts. Thus, the catalysts Rh1Cu, Rh2Ag, and Rh1Au show the highest C2H4 formation activity among each type of RhxCu, RhxAg and RhxAu catalysts, respectively. Generally, the single-atom or double-atom Rh over the surface of RhxCu catalysts can present better C2H4 formation activity, while more Rh atoms to form aggregation state over the surface of RhxCu catalysts would decrease C2H4 formation activity. Thus, the aggregation of active site metal atoms on the catalyst surface was a direct factor to affect catalytic activity of EDH to ethylene.

Fig. 5. The overall activation energy for ethane direct dehydrogenation to produce ethylene on the RhxM (M=Cu, Ag and Au) catalysts.
For the same aggregation form of metal Rh at the active site over RhxM (M=Cu, Ag, Au) catalyst, the highest C2H4 formation activity occurs over Rh1Au catalyst among the Rh1M catalysts; that is Rh2Ag among the Rh2M catalysts, Rh3Ag among the Rh3M catalysts, Rh6Au among the Rh6M catalysts, and Rh9Au among the Rh9M catalysts. Meanwhile, since C2H4 formation activity over Rh1M catalysts with a surface single atom Rh or over Rh9M catalysts with a surface close to the pure Rh will not be affected by the aggregated form, C2H4 formation activity (kJ∙mol–1) over Rh1Cu, Rh1Ag and Rh1Au catalysts or Rh9Cu, Rh9Ag and Rh9Au catalysts is compared, and following the order of Rh1Au (45.3)>Rh1Cu (63.8)>Rh1Ag (96.8) in the Rh1M catalysts and Rh9Au (59.8)>Rh9Cu (94.1)>Rh9Ag (107.0) in the Rh9M catalysts. Namely, the RhxM (M=Cu, Ag, Au) catalyst with Au as the substrate shows the highest C2H4 formation activity, followed by Cu and Ag as the substrate.
In summary, fifteen types of RhxM (x = 1, 2, 3, 6, 9; M=Cu, Ag, Au) catalysts, Rh1Cu, Rh2Ag and Rh1Au were screened out to exhibit the highest C2H4 formation activity in each RhxM system with different substrate, C2H4 formation activity is Rh1Au>Rh2Ag>Rh1Cu.
3.4. C2H4 selectivity in EDH over RhxM catalysts
As mentioned above, since two processes, the desorption or dehydrogenation of C2H4*, and the dehydrogenation of C2H5* to CHCH3* or C2H4*, mainly determine C2H4 selectivity over the catalysts RhxM (x=1, 2, 3, 6, 9; M=Cu, Ag, Au), the energy barrier difference between two competitive reaction is used to identify the controlled step of C2H4 selectivity.
As presented in Fig. 6, the energy barrier difference between the reactions of C2H5* to CHCH3* and C2H5* to C2H4* (ΔG1) was 75.1, 19.6, −59.0, 48.5 and 72.4 kJ∙mol–1 over Rh1Cu, Rh2Cu, Rh3Cu, Rh6Cu and Rh9Cu catalysts, respectively; the values of ΔG1 were 53.5, 78.9, −3.1, 4.6 and 10.6 kJ∙mol–1 over Rh1Ag, Rh2Ag, Rh3Ag, Rh6Ag and Rh9Ag catalysts, respectively; the values of ΔG1 were 46.3, 77.2, −21.4, 6.9 and 22.1 kJ∙mol–1 over Rh1Au, Rh2Au, Rh3Au, Rh6Au and Rh9Au catalysts, respectively. On the other hand, the energy barrier difference between the reactions of C2H4→C2H3+H and C2H4→C2H4(g) (ΔG2) was 121.1, 48.7, 66.6, 66.9 and 88.7 kJ∙mol–1 over Rh1Cu, Rh2Cu, Rh3Cu, Rh6Cu and Rh9Cu, respectively; the ΔG2 values were 97.5, 55.4, 50.8, 31.2, and 38.6 kJ∙mol–1 over Rh1Ag, Rh2Ag, Rh3Ag, Rh6Ag and Rh9Ag catalysts, respectively; the ΔG2 values were 110.5, 40.2, −3.6, 24.0 and −0.5 kJ∙mol−1 over Rh1Au, Rh2Au, Rh3Au, Rh6Au and Rh9Au catalysts, respectively. Thus, the values of ΔG1 are smaller than those of ΔG2 over twelve types of RhxCu (x = 1, 2, 3, 6, 9), Rh1Ag, Rh3Ag, Rh6Ag, Rh9Ag, Rh1Au, Rh3Au and Rh6Au catalysts, namely, C2H4 selectivity was mainly determined by the dehydrogenation of C2H5* to CHCH3* and C2H4*. However, the values of ΔG1 are greater than those of ΔG2 over three types of Rh2Ag, Rh2Au and Rh9Au catalysts, hence, the dehydrogenation of C2H4* to C2H3* and the desorption of C2H4* dominantly determined C2H4 selectivity. Previous studies found that the energy barrier difference of competitive reaction from the same initial reactants can be used as the basis for the quantitative evaluation of selectivity [57,58].

As shown in Fig. 7, among different RhxM (M=Cu, Ag and Au) catalysts, Rh1Cu, Rh2Ag and Rh1Au are screened out to present higher C2H4 selectivity and formation activity. The catalysts Rh3M (M=Cu, Ag and Au) are all not conducive to the production of C2H4. Namely, the aggregation state on the surface of RhxM (M=Cu, Ag and Au) catalysts significantly affected EDH catalytic performance.

3.5. Active sites and anti-coking ability
As shown in Fig. 6, since C2H4 selectivity was mainly determined by the dehydrogenation of C2H5* to CHCH3* and C2H4* over twelve types of RhxCu (x=1, 2, 3, 6, or 9), Rh1Ag, Rh3Ag, Rh6Ag, Rh9Ag, Rh1Au, Rh3Au and Rh6Au catalysts, the coking pathway on them was mainly carried out by the reaction of C2H5 dehydrogenation to CHCH3. Thus, the energy barrier difference between the reaction of C2H5* to CHCH3* and C2H5* to C2H4* (ΔG1) could be used to reflect the coking resistance of the catalyst. Adversely, the coking pathway over Rh2Ag, Rh2Au, and Rh9Au catalysts dominantly occurs by the reaction of C2H4 dehydrogenation to C2H3, and the energy barrier difference between the reactions of C2H4→C2H3+H and C2H4→C2H4(g) (ΔG2) could be used to reflect the coking resistance of the catalyst.
The results of Fig. 7 show that the Rh1Cu, Rh2Ag, and Rh1Au catalysts present the best anti-coking ability among the RhxCu, RhxAg, and RhxAu catalysts, respectively. The anti-coking ability follows the order of Rh1Cu (75.1 kJ∙mol–1)> Rh2Ag (55.4 kJ∙mol–1)>Rh1Au (46.3 kJ∙mol–1), namely, the RhxCu and RhxAu catalysts with the single Rh atom as active site, as well as RhxAg catalyst with two connected Rh atoms as active site exhibits an excellent anti-coking ability. This result is consistent with that of the catalyst with the highest activity and selectivity of C2H4 formation. Meanwhile, the RhxM (M=Cu, Ag and Au) catalysts with three atom Rh3 aggregated state on the surface easily generated CHCH3* coking precursor and their anti-coking ability was poor. Thus, all fifteen types of RhxM (M=Cu, Ag and Au) catalysts could inhibit the C–C bond cleavage reaction in C2 molecules and the formation of coking precursors, such as CH2 and CH3; meanwhile, the catalysts Rh1Cu, Rh2Ag and Rh1Au effectively inhibited the formation of coking precursors CHCH3 and C2H3.
Based on above analysis, among RhxM (M=Cu, Ag and Au) catalysts, taking the catalyst cost, C2H4 formation activity and selectivity, and better anti-coking ability into consideration, Rh1Cu should be the most suitable catalyst to achieve highly reactive and selective with less catalyst sintering and good stability, followed by Rh1Au and Rh2Ag. Meanwhile, previous studies have shown that the Pt or Pt3Sn catalysts have been widely applied to the dehydrogenation of alkanes [53]. Zhang et al. [59] fully investigated the catalytic performance of ethane direct dehydrogenation on the Pt and Pt3Sn catalysts, thus, the comparisons of the catalytic performance between Rh1Cu catalyst and the previously reported Pt or Pt3Sn catalysts was carried out. C2H4 formation activity (kJ∙mol–1) follows the order of Pt (45.8)>Rh1Cu (63.8)> Pt3Sn (87.7), namely, C2H4 formation activity of Rh1Cu is between Pt and Pt3Sn. C2H4 selectivity (kJ∙mol–1) is Rh1Cu (75.1)>Pt (18.7)>Pt3Sn (17.5), namely, compared to Rh1Cu catalyst, the Pt and Pt3Sn catalsyts are prone to deep dehydrogenation to form coking precursor CHCH3, indicating that C2H4 selectivity and anti-coking ability over Rh1Cu catalyst are much higher than those over Pt3Sn and Pt catalysts. Moreover, previous experimental study [12] also proved that Rh1Cu alloy could realize propane direct dehydrogenation at low temperature, and the temperature required for propane dehydrogenation over Rh1Cu catalyst was lower than that over PtCu catalyst, which could effectively alleviate high-temperature sintering (agglomeration) of the catalysts and significantly improve the catalyst stability. Furthermore, ethane direct dehydrogenation over Pt1Cu catalyst was considered (see details in Section 3.4 in the Supplementary Material), and the catalytic performance between Pt1Cu and Rh1Cu catalysts was compared (Fig. S21). The results show that compared to Pt1Cu catalyst, the Rh1Cu catalyst not only exhibits better C2H4 selectivity and anti-coking ability, but also presents higher C2H4 formation activity, enabling ethane dehydrogenation to be operated at lower reaction temperature, which agree with previously reported experiment results [12].
In conclusion, Rh1Cu was cherry-picked to be a potential low-cost and low-temperature catalyst for EDH to exhibit high C2H4 formation activity and selectivity, and better anti-coking ability.
3.6. Relationship between D-band center/Bader charge and catalytic performance
In the catalytic system, different metal dopants into the transition metals would cause the change of d-band center and binding energy of adsorbed substances, which could be attributed to the electron interaction based on ligand effect [60,61]. The projected state density (pDOS) over fifteen types of RhxM catalysts as presented in Fig. 3b showed that the d-band centers of surface atoms approached the Fermi level with the increasing of Rh aggregation atoms at the active sites.
Fig. 8 presents the change trend of C2H4 formation activity, selectivity, and anti-coking ability with the change of d-band center, the catalytic performance of EDH on the RhxM catalysts does not change regularly with the increasing number of Rh aggregations, namely, the catalytic performance exhibited by specific aggregation states has no apparent correlation with the variation of d-band center. Thus, the d-band center of the catalysts RhxM (M=Cu, Ag and Au) was not the main factor for the change of catalytic performance.

Table 2 lists the average Bader charge and the range of Bader charge of Rh atoms at the active sites on the RhxM catalyst surface. On the RhxCu and RhxAg catalyst, the electrons were transferred from the Cu and Ag to Rh atoms, and the average Bader charge of Rh atoms decreased with the increasing number of the aggregation metal atoms. However, on the RhxAu catalysts, the electrons transfer from the Rh to Au atoms, the average Bader charge of Rh atoms also decreased with the increasing number of the aggregation metal atoms.

Fig. 9 presents the relationship of C2H4 formation activity, selectivity, and anti-coking ability with the Bader charge, the catalytic performance of RhxM catalysts does not alter regularly with the increasing number of the aggregation metal atoms. The catalytic performance exhibited by specific aggregation states has no apparent correlation with the average Bader charge of Rh atoms on the surface. Thus, it can be considered that the change in the electron transfer of metal atoms on the catalyst surface is not the main factor for the change of catalytic performance observed for the RhxM catalysts in EDH.

Overall, the electronic effects of these catalysts, such as the changes in the d-band center and electron transfer of metal atoms on the surface of RhxM, were not the dominant factors to affect the catalytic performance of EDH. At the same time, C2H4 formation activity and selectivity on the Rh1M and Rh9M are consistent, and the activity is Rh1Au>Rh1Cu>Rh1Ag and Rh9Au>Rh9Cu>Rh9Ag, and the selectivity is Rh1Cu>Rh1Ag>Rh1Au and Rh9Cu>Rh9Ag>Rh9Au. The reason is that Rh1M surface is a monoatomic alloy, and the Rh9M surface is close to the pure Rh surface. Their surfaces can be seen as having no aggregation, so the order of catalytic performance will not be affected by the change of aggregation form, which is completely dominated by different metal substrates. However, the situation on the Rh2M, Rh3M and Rh6M is different, the order of C2H4 formation activity and selectivity is disrupted, and the order is different from that on the Rh1M and Rh9M. The reason is that there are obvious 2, 3, and 6 aggregations active sites on the surface of Rh2M, Rh3M and Rh6M. The change of the aggregation form of active sites has a significant impact on the catalytic performance, and they are also affected by different metal substrates. However, the influence of different forms of aggregation is still dominant, and the aggregation effect is greater than that of different metal substrates. Thus, the existence of aggregation effect disrupts C2H4 formation activity and selectivity that should be caused by different metal substrates.
Above result just confirms that the aggregation of surface Rh atoms on the active sites (ensemble effect) of RhxM catalysts are the main factors to affect the catalytic performance of EDH, the previous study also supports our results, for example, Li et al. [20] used density functional theory calculations to probe into the ensemble, ligand, and strain effects of the surfaces of transition element alloys considering the ordered and random combinations of PdAu, RhAu and PtAu alloys on the (111) surfaces, when compared with the ligand and strain effects, the ensemble effect significantly influenced the adsorption capacity of adsorbed species. Their study was extended to other bimetals, including PdCu, RhCu, PtCu, PdAg, RhAg, PtAg, which obtained a similar conclusion; the ensemble effect could determine the adsorption capacity of adsorbed species on the alloy. García et al. [25] suggested that the activity of alloyed nanostructures with an optimized Rh: M composition used as a hydrogenation catalyst was significantly higher than that of Rh, and the enhanced catalytic performance results from the ensemble effect formed by a few metal atoms on the surface. Li and Henkelman [27] calculated the dehydrogenation selectivity toward EtOH on the surfaces of X/Au (X=Pd and Rh) with close-packed single-metal atoms, suggesting that the dehydrogenation selectivity toward EtOH on the X/Au surface mainly depended on the size of surface X-atom aggregation, meanwhile, the existence of specific aggregation states on the surface of alloy catalyst could effectively regulate the selectivity of EtOH dehydrogenation. Thus, C2H4 formation activity, selectivity, and anti-coking ability in EDH process can be regulated by adjusting the ensemble effect of Rh atoms in the catalyst at the atomic level. By constructing the aggregation form of the optimal doped catalyst surface, the catalytic performance could be promoted more effectively to produce more oriented product ethylene.
4. Conclusions
In this work, the catalytic performance of RhxM (M=Cu, Ag, and Au) (x=1, 2, 3, 6, and 9) catalysts for EDH to ethylene was systematically studied by using density functional theory. Meanwhile, the influences of the second metal substrate and the aggregation form of Rh atoms on the catalytic performance are analyzed. The computational analysis also finds that the changes in the atomic d-band center and electron transfer (electron effect, ligand effect) on the surface of RhxM catalysts or the influences of the second metal substrate are not the main factor affecting catalytic performance. While the different aggregation states of the active Rh atoms (ensemble effect) are the main factors for regulating the catalytic performance. Catalysts Rh1Cu, Rh2Ag and Rh1Au show the highest catalytic performance in each system for different metal substrate based on C2H4 formation activity, selectivity, and anti-coking ability. Rh1Cu exhibits the best catalytic performance and could achieve highly reactive and selective with less catalyst sintering and good stability, followed by Rh1Au and Rh2Ag. This study may guide the synthesis of desired catalysts for the industrialization of EDH at low temperature from a theoretical viewpoint.
