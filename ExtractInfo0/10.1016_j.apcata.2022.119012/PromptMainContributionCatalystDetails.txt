Active sites formation of molybdenum oxide catalyst for hydrocarbon conversion
The catalytic properties of molybdenum-alumina systems depend on the synthesis conditions. Herein, we considered the effect of MoO3/Al2O3 catalyst pretreatment conditions on their activity in propylene and propane conversion. MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized by wetness impregnation of the support with a solution of molybdenum citrate complex and activated in different atmospheres at 550–590 °С. The maximum conversion of propylene and yields of metathesis products were observed for the sample activated in an inert gas flow. This is caused by the formation of precursors of the metathesis active sites in this sample, i.e. isolated surface monomolybdate species. Activation of the catalyst in hydrogen leads to the reduction of Mo6+ to Mo5+/Mo4+, which ensure the increased activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. Therefore, it was shown that make it possible to purposefully change the properties of the same molybdenum-alumina catalyst to suit the problems of the specific reaction (metathesis, oligomerization, dehydrogenation, aromatization, cracking).
1. Introduction
Systems based on molybdenum oxide on different supports (Al2O3, SiO2, SiO2-Al2O3 and etc.) are one of the most important classes of heterogeneous catalysts, which are widely used in commercial oil refining and petrochemical processes such as hydrotreatment [1], [2], [3], [4], hydrocracking [5], [6], and metathesis [7], [8], [9]. Among them, the molybdenum-alumina catalysts are of particular interest, which possess high thermal stability and mechanical strength as well as the developed pore structure.
It is well known that the catalytic properties of molybdenum-alumina systems are determined by the dispersion and structure of the active phase, which in turn depend on its content and synthesis conditions. The structure of surface molybdenum species in supported MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts in the oxidized state was studied using various spectral methods (Raman and IR spectroscopy [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], UV–Vis spectroscopy [10], [13], [14], [16], X-ray absorption spectroscopy [11], [12], [17], [18]), and density functional theory calculations [19], [20]. Based on the results of previous studies, the following conclusions can be drawn. Highly dispersed compounds are present on the surface of catalysts predominantly as isolated MoO42− monomolybdates in the tetrahedral coordination at a low content of molybdenum oxide (< 1 Мо atom/nm2). At a moderate content of MoO3 (1–4.6 Мо atom/nm2), along with isolated molybdenum compounds, oligomeric structures are also formed in which Mo6+ ions are coupled to each other via the bridging oxygen atoms and are in the octahedral coordination. Thus, molybdenum oxide is well dispersed over the alumina surface up to the concentration of ca. 4.6 Мо atom/nm2, which corresponds to complete coverage of the support surface with a monolayer of the active component [9], [10]. A further increase in the molybdenum content results in the formation of MoO3 and Al2(MoO4)3 crystal phases.
However, when a catalyst based on molybdenum oxide is contacted with a hydrocarbon feedstock, Mo6+ can be reduced to lower oxidation states under the process conditions [21], [22]. It is known also that supported molybdenum oxide catalysts demonstrate a wide range of catalytic properties depending on their pretreatment conditions (temperature, pressure, and the gas nature) and are active hydrogenolysis [23], [24], hydrogenation [25], [26], isomerization [27], [28], as well as such practically important reactions for obtaining light alkenes as metathesis [29], [30], [31], [32] and alkane dehydrogenation [12], [18], [33], [34].
As already mentioned, attempts to relate pretreatment conditions of molybdenum catalysts to their catalytic properties have been made in earlier reports. But different conclusions were made. For example, it was shown that higher activity in the reaction of propylene metathesis was observed over the MoO3/Al2O3 [32], [35], [36], [37], [38] or MoO3/SiO2 [30] catalysts, but lower conversion was found over the MoO3/alumina-silica [39] or MoO3/zeolite-alumina [40] after pretreatment by hydrogen, alkenes, or CO. Dimeric Mo5+ species [35] or distorted square pyramidal Mo5+ species [30] were proposed as metathesis active sites on the basis UV-Vis DRS, EPR, XPS investigations of the oxidized and reduced molybdenum-containing catalysts surface structure. Grünert et al. [32], [41] concluded that on the reduced surface the active sites may be formed from coexisting Mo6+ and Mo4+ precursors while Mo5+, Mo2+, and Mo0 are not active in the metathesis. According to the authors [38], the precursors active sites of propylene metathesis in MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts obtained both by anchoring Mo complexes and by the conventional impregnation method are Mo4+ species, while the initial form of the catalyst and Mo5+ containing catalysts are inactive in propene metathesis. On the other hand, studies [42] of molybdenum-alumina catalysts have shown that the catalytic activity does not depend on pretreatment conditions (air or He). This leads to the conclusion that activation of catalysts takes place under the propene atmosphere in the first minutes of the reaction, and Mo6+ species were proposed as metathesis active sites. Correlations between Mo states and activity in metathesis of various butenes were also discussed in the paper [31]. It was shown that partially reduced Mo5+ or Mo4+ species from octahedrally coordinated Mo species contributed to the selective promotion of 2-butene and isobutene metathesis, while the activity in 2-butene and 1-butene metathesis decreased after the reduce pretreatment of the catalysts.
The catalytic behavior of molybdenum-alumina catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation also depends on the activation conditions. For dehydrogenation of butanes and ethane [18], [33], [34], [43], it has been reported that the dehydrogenation activity increases after reductive treatment. XPS, TEM, and XAFS studies were used to establish the correlation between catalytic activity and the surface state of MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts. However, the nature of the active sites of the MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation has not been finally established. It is assumed that the active sites contain the Mo4+ [18], [34], [43] and/or Mo5+ [33], [43] ions.
Thus, the question of the active sites configuration, the role of the molybdenum oxidation state of MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts is still open and needs additional investigation. It should also be noted that there are very few modern studies of the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over molybdenum-alumina catalysts, although this process is very promising to produce highly valuable propylene.
Our main thought was the use of the molybdenum-alumina catalyst in a single propane processing process to produce various alkenes. We assume that it is possible to to carry out propane dehydrogenation (in one reactor) followed by metathesis of the resulting propylene (in another reactor) over one MoO3/Al2O3 catalyst, but with different pretreatment. Currently the MoO3/Al2O3 catalyst is not a commercial propane dehydrogenation catalyst, and information about its use for this process is limited. Therefore, information about the effect of pretreatment conditions on the state of the molybdenum-alumina catalyst surface and catalytic behavior is very important.
In our previous works the series of MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts with a molybdenum oxide loading from 2 till 10 wt% for propylene metathesis has been studied [44], [45]. The influence of the reaction conditions on the catalytic activity has been also investigated. The catalyst loaded 7 wt% MoO3 was the most active in the propylene metathesis reaction. It exhibited propylene conversion of 30% and metathesis product selectivity of 96% at 200 °C. This catalyst was chosen for further study.
This study is focused on the impact of pretreatment atmosphere (air, argon, hydrogen) at heat treatment (550–590 °С) on the formation of MoO3/Al2O3 active sites. The catalyst structure was characterized by several techniques, including Power X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV–Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, the relation of the formed surface molybdenum structures with and their activity in various conversion processes of propylene (oligomerization, metathesis) and propane (dehydrogenation, aromatization, cracking) was also discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
γ-Alumina support was obtained by calcination of pseudoboehmite (JSC Promcatalys, Ryazan, Russia) at 550 °С for 16 h. The MoO3/Al2O3 (MoAl) catalyst was prepared via a impregnation of the support with a solution of molybdenum citrate complex (NH4)4[Mo4(C6H5O6)2O11] followed by drying at 120 °С for 12 h and calcination at 550 °С for 4 h. The content of molybdenum oxide in the catalyst was 8.2 wt%.
To investigate the effect of pretreatment conditions on the structure of surface molybdenum compounds and catalytic properties of samples, the initial MoAl catalyst was activated under the following conditions: 1) in an air flow at 550 °C for 1 h (MoAl-O2); or 2) in an argon flow at 590 °С for 1 h (MoAl-Ar); or 3) in a hydrogen flow at 590 °С for 1 h (MoAl-Н2). The samples were then cooled to room temperature in the same atmosphere.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The MoO3 content in the catalyst was measured on a Varian 710-ES (Agilent Technologies, USA) inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). Power X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a D8 Advance (Bruker, Germany) powder diffractometer with Cu kα radiation in the range of 5–80° with a scanning step 0.05° a scanning rate of 2° min−1. Raman spectra were recorded on a DXR Smart Raman dispersion spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) equipped with an attachment for recording the backsсattered light in the range of 50–3500 cm–1. The wavelength of the exciting laser radiation was 780 nm. The laser power was 24 mW. UV–Visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS) were registered relative to a BaSO4 standard in the region of 180–900 nm on a UVV 2501PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) with an ISRR-240A diffuse reflectance attachment. The edge energy (Eg) for allowed transitions was determined by finding the intercept of the straight line for the low-energy rise of a plot of [F(R)E]2 versus E, where E is the incident photon energy [10]. A graph containing an example of the determination of Eg can be found in Fig. S1. The number of bridging Mo–O–Mo bonds NMo–O–Mo is related to the UV–Vis DRS edge energy by the following equation: NMo–O–Mo = 11.8 – 2.6Eg. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a SPECS photoelectron spectrometer (SPECS Gmbh, Germany) using an AlKa (hν = 1486.6 eV) source. The binding energy scale (Eb) was preliminarily calibrated using the positions of gold and copper core level peaks: Au4f7/2 at 84.0 eV and Cu2p3/2 at 932.67 eV from gold and copper foils. The residual gas pressure did not exceed 8·10−7 Pa during the measurements. Al2p, Mo3d, C1s and O1s regions were examined to reveal the chemical (charge) state of elements on the surface of samples. In order to take into account the effect of surface charging, the Al2p at binding energy (BE) of 74.5 from the support (Al2O3) was used as an internal standard. Acidic properties of MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts were determined by IR spectroscopy of absorbed pyridine with an IRTracer-100 spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) in the region of 400–6000 cm−1 with a 4 cm−1 resolution and accumulation of 200 scans. The samples pressed into thin pellets were placed in a cell and evacuated in situ at 550–590 °C for 1 h. The pyridine adsorption was carried out at room temperature, and the sample was then heated at 150 °C for 20 min. Then pyridine was desorbed successively at 150 and 350 °C in a vacuum for 30 min, the sample was cooled to room temperature, and an IR spectrum was recorded. Concentrations of Brӧnsted and Lewis acid sites (BAS and LAS, respectively) were found from the integrated intensities of characteristic absorption bands using the integrated absorption coefficients: the band at 1540 cm−1 for BAS, and the band at 1450 cm−1 for LAS [46]. The structure and microstructure of the samples were studied by HRTEM using a ThemisZ electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and a limiting resolution of 0.07 nm. Images were recorded using a Ceta 16 CCD array (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). High-angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF STEM image) was performed using a standard ThemisZ detector. The instrument is equipped with a SuperX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) energy-dispersive characteristic X-ray spectrometer (EDX) with a semiconductor Si detector with an energy resolution of 128 eV.
2.3. Catalytic test
Propylene conversion was carried out in a fixed-bed flow reactor (the catalyst weight of 4.0 g) at a temperature of 200 °C, atmospheric pressure and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) 1 h−1. Propylene (99.9 wt%) was used as the feedstock.
Propane conversion was performed in a fixed-bed flow reactor (the catalyst weight of 2.0 g) at a temperature of 590 °С, atmospheric pressure, molar ratio Ar/С3Н8 = 4 and WHSV 0.5 h−1. Propane (99.9 wt%) was used as the feedstock.
Quantitative analysis of the reaction products was made by online gas chromatography (GC) using a Tsvet 500 (Russia) gas chromatograph equipped with a J&W DB-1 column (60 m, 0.25 mm, 1 µm) and a flame-ionization detector. Internal normalization method was used to calculate the concentration of the reaction products. Conversion of the initial reagent (Х), yields of products (Y), and weight fractions of component groups in the reaction mixture (W) were calculated by the following equations:

3. Results and discussion
X-ray diffraction analysis of the MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts activated in different atmospheres demonstrated the presence of only the γ-Al2O3 phase (ICDD PDF-2). Diffraction peaks of MoO3 and Al2(MoO4)3 crystalline phases were not detected (Fig. 1). This indicates that molybdenum is amorphous MoO3 species or sizes of MoO3 crystallites are below the XRD detection limit (5 nm). This is due both to the low loading of active component in the catalysts (8.2 wt%, which constitutes about one third of a monolayer capacity) and to the use of citric acid in the impregnating solution. The preparation of industrial MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts is classically realized by impregnation of a support with an aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate followed by calcination. But this method does not really control the distribution and dispersion of the active phase and can also lead to the formation of molybdenum oxide and aluminum molybdate crystallites, which are considered inactive in the metathesis reaction. These unwanted processes can be avoided by reducing the interaction between Mo and Al2O3. In this work, an approach to reduce the interaction between Mo and support was to use citrate ligands that form stable molybdenum complexes. These complexes are homogeneously distributed on the surface and inside the pores of the support and promote the formation of highly dispersed MoOx species [47].

Fig. 1. XRD patterns of MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts after different pretreatments.
To confirm the assumption about the highly dispersed MoO3 and its homogenous distribution, MoAl-O2 sample was additionally characterized by HRTEM. Fig. 2 shows HRTEM micrographs of the MoAl catalyst activated in air flow. The typical needle-shaped aggregates of γ-Al2O3 crystallites with 0.140, 0.198, 0.241, 0.296 nm lattice spacing were observed on micrographs of the catalyst. In addition, the HAADF-STEM image of the MoAl-O2 catalyst present brighter particles of about 0.4–1.8 nm in size homogeneously dispersed over the support surface (Fig. 2b) with 0.159, 0.238 (0.241), 0.250 nm lattice spacing of MoO3. The average particle size of molybdenum oxide is 0.7 nm. Analysis of the HRTEM images and elemental mapping of the MoAl-O2 catalyst (Fig. 2e and f) showed homogeneous distribution of molybdenum oxide species over the support.

The results of the catalyst study by HRTEM are in good agreement with XRD data.
Information on the structure of molybdenum compounds in the catalysts was obtained by means of DRUV-Vis and Raman spectroscopy.
UV-Vis DRS spectra of the obtained samples (Fig. 3) contain the absorption bands at 231 and 291–309 nm occurring due to O2– → Mo6+ charge transfer transition of surface isolated molybdenum species in tetrahedral coordination and oligomeric molybdates in octahedral coordination, respectively [10], [16], [48]. The UV-Vis DRS spectrum of the MoAl-H2 catalyst contains additional low-intensity bands in the spectral region of 400–480 nm, which correspond to the reduced molybdenum ions, such as Mo5+ and/or Mo4+ [35], [49].

Fig. 3. UV-Vis DRS spectra of MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts after different pretreatments.
The obtained UV-Vis DRS spectra were used to estimate the number of covalent Mo–O–Mo (NMo-O-Mo) bonds around the central Mo6+ cation (Table 1) according to the method described by Tian [10]. Calculations show the predominant formation of isolated surface molybdate ions in MoAl-O2 and MoAl-Ar catalysts. After reduction treatment of the catalyst, the edge energy (Eg) decreases to ∼4.19 eV, whereas the number of molybdenum covalent bonds increases to 0.91, which indicates an increase in the concentration of oligomeric molybdate structures.

Catalyst Eg, eV NMo-O-Mo Predominant compounds
MoAl-O2 4.41 0.34 Monomolybdate
MoAl-Ar 4.38 0.40 Monomolybdate
MoAl-H2 4.11 0.91 Monomolybdate and polymolybdate
In the Raman spectra of the catalysts (Fig. 4), the bands typical of both the terminal Мо= О and bridging Мо–О–Мо bonds were observed. Particularly, the spectra of MoAl-O2 and MoAl-Ar samples contain the band at 320–333 cm−1 assigned to the bending mode of Mo–O–Mo bridging bond [10], [14]. Combining with band at 1004–1006 cm−1 assigned to symmetric stretching vibrations of Мо= О bonds, this band suggests the presence of isolated surface (О2 =)МоО2 molybdenum species in tetrahedral coordination [10], [14], [15]. Raman bands at 246, 281, 446 and 660 cm−1 are also observed. These bands are attributable to vibrations of the Мо–О–Мо and Мо–О–Al bridging bonds in oligomeric МоОх species [10], [50], [51].

Fig. 4. Raman spectra of MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts after different pretreatments.
The frequency of Мо= О bond vibrations for the MoAl-Н2 catalyst is shifted to ∼1014 cm−1 due to formation of surface oligomeric monoxo species (O=MoO4)n during the reduction treatment of the sample [12], [14], [15], [33]. This is well consistent with the UV-Vis DRS data. The Raman spectra of MoAl-Ar and MoAl-Н2 samples, along with the bands described above, contain broad band at 799 and 791 cm−1, which correspond most likely to vibrations of the Мо5+–О bonds in the structures similar to Мо4О11 [52].
It is known that during impregnation of the alumina support from molybdenum precursor solutions molybdate anions exchanges with surface OH groups of Al2O3 [53], [54]. First basic and neutral OH groups interact, leading to the formation of tetrahedral molybdenum species on the alumina surface. As the density of support hydroxyl groups decreases with an increase in the molybdenum loading, polymeric surface molybdate species is formed.
Thus, in obtained MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts activated in the oxidizing or inert atmosphere the isolated surface dioxomolybdates are predominant, although a part of molybdenum is also present as the МоОх surface oligomeric species. In the MoAl-H2 catalyst, the fraction of polymolybdate structures increases. The data of spectral methods indicate that the coordination of Mo species already present in oxidized samples remain almost unchanged during thermal treatment in Ar flow. Partial structure changes of the supported molybdenum species may occur as a result of rearrangement of the tetrahedral/octahedral species during the high-temperature reduction of the catalyst in a hydrogen flow. The formation of polymeric species in the MoAl-H2 catalyst occurs due to the condensation of adjacent monomeric MoO4 species with the change of the molybdenum coordination. However, isolated tetrahedral MoO4 species do not completely consume and are still present in the catalyst, although the fraction decreases.
The charging state of molybdenum in the catalysts with different pretreatment was examined by XPS (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5. Mo3d XPS spectra of MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts after different pretreatments.
The analysis of XPS spectra revealed that the MoAl-O2 sample contains mostly the Mo6+ ions with the Mo3d5/2 binding energy of 232.8 eV [31], [43], [55]. The presence of Mo5+ in the catalyst is likely due to the partial reduction of Mo6+ species during evacuation of the sample prior to the study and/or during measurements under influence of X-ray irradiation. Thermal treatment of the catalyst under argon flow leads to the reduction of a part of molybdenum on the catalyst surface to the oxidation state + 5 (BE = 231.2 eV) [31], [43]. In the XPS spectrum of MoAl-H2 catalyst, in addition to the two states described above, one can see the additional species with the binding energy 230.2 eV corresponding to Mo4+ species [31], [43], [55], the content of which are 25% (Table 2). Activation of the catalyst in a hydrogen atmosphere also decreases the surface Mo/Al atomic ratios (Table 2), which indirectly indicates the agglomeration of molybdenum species as a result of the reduction of surface molybdenum species and breaking their bond with the alumina surface [41].

The pretreatment conditions affect also the acidic properties of the obtained catalysts. Concentrations of acid sites calculated from IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine are listed in Table 3. Variation of the pyridine desorption temperature makes it possible to differentiate acid sites by their strength: at 150 °С pyridine is adsorbed on sites of different strength, whereas in increasing of the desorption temperature to 350 °С pyridine remains in the adsorbed state only on strong acid sites.

The MoAl-O2 catalyst has been shown to have the highest content of Brӧnsted acid sites. Treatment of the sample in an inert gas flow leads to a twofold decrease in the total amount of BAS and a minor decrease in the total amount of LAS. Reduction of the catalyst in hydrogen produces a further decrease in the BAS density (more than 3.5-fold as compared to the MoAl-O2 sample) at a simultaneous increase in the LAS density by 1.4 times.
Tests of MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts in the propylene conversion showed that the sample pretreated in a flow of inert gas exhibits the highest activity (Fig. 6). The propylene conversion over this catalyst reaches 42%. The maximum yield of the metathesis products (ethylene and butenes) about 35% is observed over the MoAl-Ar catalyst as well. Activation of the catalysts in air and hydrogen decreases the propylene conversion and the yields of metathesis products.

The pretreatment conditions of MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts affect the product composition too (Table 4). The main products of propylene conversion over the catalysts activated in air or argon are ethylene and butenes, the total content of which is 83–86 wt%. The predominant formation of C5+ hydrocarbons is observed over MoAl-H2 catalyst, their content in the reaction products reaches 57.6 wt%.

Thus, propylene conversion over MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts proceeds by two routes: 1) metathesis with the formation of ethylene and butenes and 2) oligomerization with the formation of С5+ hydrocarbons. It is accepted that precursors of the metathesis active sites in molybdenum oxide catalysts are isolated Мо6+ species [9], [56], [57]. The metathesis active sites themselves are the molybdenum carbene complexes formed in situ at high temperatures in the presence of alkenes during the initiation step [9], [15], [56], [57], [58]. In the catalysts activated in air or argon, mostly the highly dispersed surface monomolybdate species are formed, so they exhibit a pronounced metathesis activity. Therewith, high-temperature treatment of the catalyst in an inert gas flow prior to the interaction with propylene promotes the formation of active sites and enhances its activity in the metathesis reaction as compared to the initial MoAl-О2 catalyst. Activation of the catalyst in hydrogen leads to the partial reduction of molybdenum species and increases the degree of their agglomeration, i.e. decreases the number of metathesis active sites, thus lowering the propylene conversion and facilitating an intense oligomerization on the catalyst acid sites.
MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts activated in different atmospheres were also tested in conversion of propane. The MoAl-H2 sample is the most active (Fig. 7) and provides the propane conversion about 73%. The maximum yields of propylene, light hydrocarbons С1-С2 and benzene-toluene-xylene fraction (BTX) are observed for this catalyst. Propane conversion over MoAl-O2 and MoAl-Ar samples does not exceed 50%, and yields of the products are lower than over MoAl-H2 catalyst, except for the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons С10+ (Y С10+).

The pretreatment conditions of the catalysts exerted also affected the composition of products (Table 5). The highest contents of propylene and light hydrocarbons С1-С2 in the reaction products were observed for the MoAl-H2 catalyst. Activation of the catalysts in the oxidizing or inert atmosphere increases nearly twofold the fraction of С4-С6 hydrocarbons in the reaction products and sixfold the fraction of aromatic hydrocarbons С10+.

Active sites of the molybdenum-containing catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes are assumed contain Mo4+ and/or Mo5+ ions [18], [43]. Under the reaction conditions, molybdenum with the oxidation state + 6 are reduced by propane to lower oxidation states. Therefore, all catalysts are active in the conversion of propane mainly toward its dehydrogenation and aromatization of the resulting propylene with the formation of monoaromatic hydrocarbons. Higher activity of MoAl-H2 catalyst can be attributed to the formation of a greater amount of Mo4+ cations on its surface during the activation in hydrogen.
The content of Lewis acid sites, particularly the strong ones increases during the reduction pretreatment of catalyst. In its turn, this increases both the depth of the cracking side reaction and the fraction of С1-С2 hydrocarbons in the reaction products over MoAl-H2 catalyst. Whereas the fraction of high-molecular products is greater over MoAl-O2 and MoAl-Ar catalysts having a higher density of Brӧnsted acid sites, over which oligomerization and condensation of dehydrogenation products occur.
4. Conclusion
Thus, it has been shown that MoO3/Al2O3 catalyst to depend on the pretreatment conditions can be used for both hydro/dehydrogenation processes and acid-controlled reactions, as well as for specific reactions of hydrocarbon metathesis. High-temperature treatment of the MoO3/Al2O3 catalyst in the oxidizing or inert atmosphere leads to the predominant formation of isolated surface monomolybdates on its surface, which serves as the precursors of active sites for alkene metathesis. Therewith, activation of the catalyst in an inert gas flow before the interaction with alkene promotes the formation of metathesis active sites, namely, the molybdenum carbene complexes. Pretreatment of the catalyst in hydrogen results in the reduction of surface Mo6+ to Mo5+ and Mo4+, as well as an increase in the fraction of polymolybdate structures due to condensation of isolated monomolybdates. The reduced molybdenum compounds (Mo4+ and/or Mo5+) ensure high activity in dehydrogenation and aromatization of alkanes. The catalyst activation conditions affect also its surface acidic properties and accordingly the depth of the acid-controlled reactions of cracking, oligomerization, etc.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
