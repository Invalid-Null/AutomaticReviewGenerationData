Abstract
Bimetallic catalysts have attracted increasing attention in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to the synergistic effect of metal species and considerably improved catalytic performance, but they often suffer from severe sintering and poor stability. Here, well-dispersed and ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters encapsulated in silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites (named PtZn@S-1) are prepared via a facile in situ synthesis strategy. It is indicated that the PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters with ultrasmall size are homogeneously dispersed within the channels of S-1 zeolites. The 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst shows excellent catalytic performance in PDH with a propane conversion of 45.3% and a propylene selectivity of >99%, and no visible sintering of PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters is observed in the long-term PDH reaction at 550 °C. The excellent catalytic properties and high stability of the ultrasmall bimetallic nanoclusters confined in zeolites create new prospects for PDH.

1. Introduction
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has attracted extensive attention in recent years owing to growing demand for propene and increasing production of shale gas [1], [2]. Currently, Pt-based catalysts are widely used in commercial PDH processes due to their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity in CC cleavage, as well as environment-friendly properties [3], [4]. The size of metal particles is the key factor determining the performance of Pt-based catalysts [5], [6]. Generally, metal species, especially those of subnano metal clusters and/or single atoms, have different catalytic properties than metal particles due to the fact that the more exposed active sites in small metal clusters could enhance the charge transfer between the metal species and supports and/or other metals [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. It has been demonstrated that the addition of secondary metal elements to Pt-based catalysts could decrease the number of multiple adsorption sites through partially blocked surface (ensemble effect) and/or change the electron density of states (ligand effect) [12], [13], [14], [15]. These changes affect the adsorptive performance of the substrate on the surface of the catalyst, producing a unique catalytic effect. Thus, introducing promoters (Sn [16], [17], [18], [19], In [20], Ga [21], [22], [23], Mn [24], Cu [25], Zn [26], [27], etc.) into Pt can not only decrease the size of Pt clusters but also increase the electron density of Pt atoms, consequently affecting the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts in various catalyses. However, these small bimetallic nanocatalysts, especially nanoclusters containing non-noble metals, tend to suffer from severe aggregation, metal leaching, and sintering during high-temperature reactions due to their high surface free energy [4]. Thus, the exploitation of bimetallic catalysts with ultrasmall cluster size and excellent stability is of great significance but challenging to accomplish.
Zeolites with high surface area, well-defined channels, high thermal stability, and adjustable acidity have been widely used as ideal supports for synthesis of metal nanocluster catalysts [11], [28], [29]. Recently, metal nanoparticles encapsulated in zeolites have been developed as an efficient method for confining nanocluster growth, decreasing sintering and eliciting shape selectivity [11], [12], [30], [31], [32], [33]. Several new methods for encapsulating nanoclusters into zeolites have been exploited, such as introducing the stabilized metal species during the crystallization of zeolites [7], [34], covering the shells of zeolites [35], [36], and adding metal species into the expanded precursors of two-dimensional zeolites [33]. Nevertheless, in some cases, the zeolites containing Al may limit the reaction range of these materials due to the existence of acidity related to aluminum sites.
Silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite, a purely siliceous zeolite, is MFI-type, featuring a channel of 5.6 × 5.1 Å (a little larger than propane, ~4.7 Å), which is beneficial for propane adsorption and activation. Guo and co-workers prepared Cu-Pt@S-1 catalyst through a one-pot method for encapsulating Pt–Cu alloys into microporous cavities of S-1 zeolites [37]. However, during the crystallization of zeolites, most metal cations are easily precipitated in the form of bulk hydroxides in alkaline synthetic gels, leading to the formation of large particles on the surfaces of the zeolite crystals. Therefore, it is essential to develop more protective strategies for encapsulating ultrasmall metal clusters in the zeolite framework during the in situ synthetic process. Sun et al. developed a ligand-stabilized approach for encapsulating hybrid bimetallic clusters Pd––M(OH)2 (M = Ni, Co) into S-1 zeolites, which showed excellent catalytic activity and superior thermal stability [38]. However, there has been no report of ultrasmall bimetallic nanoclusters confined in S-1 in situ that can improve catalytic performance and stability.
Here, ultramall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters encapsulated in S-1 zeolites (PtZn@S-1) were prepared under direct hydrothermal conditions and used for PDH. Most significantly, 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 exhibits superior activity, high selectivity, and stability. For comparison, PtZn species supported on S-1 zeolites were also prepared by an impregnation method, showing much lower catalytic performance and stability than 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 for PDH. In addition, the PtZn@S-1 catalyst also showed excellent shape-selective catalytic performance. This work not only opens up a new perspective on the formation of propene in the PDH process but also provides more possibilities for their application in other high-performance catalytic reactions.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
All the reagents and chemicals were used as received without further purification. Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide solution (TPAOH, 25 wt%), tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), ethylenediamine, chloroplatinic acid, and zinc nitrate were obtained from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chem. Co. 1,3-Dimethyl-5-nitrobenzene and p-chloronitrobenzene were purchased from Tianjin Shenneng Sci-Tech Co.
2.1.1. Preparation of silicalite-1
Silicalite-1 zeolites were synthesized with molar composition 1.0 SiO2:0.4 TPAOH: 5 H2O under conventional hydrothermal conditions at 170 °C for 4 days as described previously [38]. Afterwards, the as-synthesized solid was centrifuged and washed several times with deionized water, and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h. After that, it was calcined at 550 °C for 8 h in air with heating rate 3 °C min−1 to obtain the final product.
2.1.2. Preparation of 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst
The 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst was synthesized in situ with molar composition 1.0 SiO2:0.4 TPAOH:35 H2O:0.00225 [Pt(NH2CH2CH2NH2)2]Cl2:0.011 [Zn(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](NO3)2 (the detailed preparation of [Pt(NH2CH2CH2NH2)2]Cl2 and [Zn(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](NO3)2 solutions is shown in the Supplementary Material) under conventional hydrothermal conditions at 170 °C for 4 days [38]. Then the as-synthesized solid was centrifuged and washed several times with deionized water and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. After that, it was calcined at 550 °C for 8 h in air to remove the template and then reduced at 550 °C to obtain the final product, denoted as 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1. A series of xPtyZn@S-1 catalysts (x and y represent the weight ratio of Pt and Zn in the synthesized samples) were also prepared by the same method with an appropriate molar ratio of Pt and Zn. For comparison, 0.3Pt@S-1 and 0.5Zn@S-1 catalysts were also prepared using a similar synthesis procedure without the addition of [Zn(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](NO3)2 and [Pt(NH2CH2CH2NH2)2]Cl2, respectively. The 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 catalyst was also synthesized via an incipient wetness co-impregnation method, as described in the Supplementary Material.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were performed on a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 (Mini FlexII) diffractometer using CuKα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer equipped with an AlKα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). N2 adsorption–desorption analysis was carried out on a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer at 77 K, and all the samples were degassed in vacuum at 200 °C for 8 h before the measurement. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a Jeol JEM-2800 microscope at 200 kV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on a TGA/DSC1 analyzer in air with a 10 °C min−1 heating rate and a 100 mL min−1 airflow rate. The platinum and zinc content were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on a ThermoFisher iCAP7400 instrument, and all the samples were digested in the mixed solution of H3PO4 and aqua regia. Hydrogen–oxygen titration measurements and propene temperature-programed desorption (C3H6 TPD) were carried out on a Quantachrome CHEMBET3000 analyzer with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) analyzer. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of chemisorbed CO on activated catalysts were performed on a BRUKER TENSOR II using a resolution of 4 cm−1. The detailed measurement methods of hydrogen–oxygen titration, C3H6 TPD, and FT-IR spectra of the CO adsorption are described in the Supplementary Material.
2.3. Catalytic testing
Propane dehydrogenation was performed in a quartz fixed-bed reactor (i.d. 5 mm). In a typical experiment, a certain amount of catalyst was put into the quartz tube. Then a reaction gas mixture (C3H8 and N2) with an appropriate volume ratio was passed through the fixed-bed quartz reactor. Finally, the reactor was heated to the desired temperature and the outlet products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC, SP-6890) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The C3H8 conversion, selectivity of the C3H6, and carbon balance were defined based on the total number of carbon atoms balance method [15], [16], [27]:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst synthesis and characterization
3.1.1. Synthesis and structural information
The synthesis process of bimetallic PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters encapsulated in S-1 zeolites (PtZn@S-1) is illustrated in Scheme 1. First, the Pt and Zn complexes interact with the initial zeolitic gel via electrostatic interactions and are encapsulated inside the zeolite framework through self-assembly during crystallization. After calcination in air and reduction by H2, the ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters are confined inside the S-1 zeolites. For comparison, monometallic 0.3Pt@S-1 and 0.5Zn@S-1 catalysts were also prepared under similar procedures. The Zn and Pt loadings of the synthesized samples were defined by ICP-OES and the obtained results are displayed in Table S1 in the Supplementary Material. The Pt and Zn loadings of 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 are 0.23 and 0.42 wt%, respectively.

Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the synthesized samples. All the metal-containing S-1 samples show characteristic peaks of MFI structure, indicating that the structure of MFI is maintained during the synthesis process [7]. No peaks corresponding to Pt and Zn crystalline phases are detected, indicating no large metal nanoclusters in the synthesized samples. Notably, with Pt loading increased to 3 wt% and Zn loading increased to 5 wt%, the peaks at 39.7° and 46.2° corresponding to metallic Pt and the peak at 40.9° corresponding to PtZn alloy can be observed in 3Pt@S-1 and 3Pt5Zn@S-1 samples, respectively (Fig. 1b) [12], demonstrating that the PtZn alloys are formed through in situ synthesis.

XPS spectroscopy was carried out to characterize the elemental composition of the synthesized samples (Figs. 2 and S1). In the Pt4f and Zn2p XPS spectra of 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1, no XPS signals of Pt and Zn species are detected. However, Pt4f7/2 and Pt4f5/2 peaks at 74.5 and 71.8 eV corresponding to typical zerovalent Pt, as well as Zn2p1/2 and Zn2p3/2 peaks at 1045.1 and 1021.8 eV corresponding to Zn0 and/or Zn2+, are observed on the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst after depth profile (Figs. 2 and S1), confirming that the PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters are completely encapsulated into S-1 zeolites [12]. To further verify the existing states of Zn species in 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1, the Zn LMM spectrum was recorded, which can easily distinguish the Zn chemical environments compared with the Zn2p spectrum. As shown in Fig. S2, 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 shows two kinetic energy peaks related to two kinds of Zn species. The kinetic energy of the Zn2+ species located at a lower position (986.6 eV) is attributed to the bonding of Zn with lattice O atoms of S-1 zeolite. Additionally, the LMM peak of Zn0 (988.7 eV) shows the existence of metallic Zn possibly derived from PtZn alloy [27], [28].

Meanwhile, a small shift of binding energies of Pt4f core levels to higher binding energy can be found for 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 (71.8 eV) compared with 0.3Pt@S-1 (71.2 eV), which further indicates that the PtZn alloy nanoclusters are formed during the H2 pretreatment. Alloying of Zn with Pt enhances the electrostatic field around the Pt nuclei with depletion of Pt5d density of states near the Fermi level and redistribution of charge involving (6s, 6p) electrons, which results in a binding energy shift of the Pt4f core levels to higher energies [13], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. A similar result was obtained for PtZn alloy nanoclusters encapsulated inside MFI zeolite micropores [12]. Thus, the XRD and XPS characterization results reveal that most of the Zn species have been doped into Pt species, forming PtZn alloy nanoclusters, and a fraction of Zn species are incorporated into the framework of S-1 zeolite during the synthesis process.
3.1.2. Morphology and textural properties
The textural properties of the synthesized samples were detected by N2 adsorption–desorption (Fig. S3 and Table S2). All the samples show isotherms of type I, typical for microporous materials [39], [44]. For metal-containing S-1 zeolites, the slight decreases in BET surface area and pore volume from those of S-1 zeolites could be attributed to the occupation of the channels of S-1 zeolites by metal species, in accordance with the XPS results. Nevertheless, the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 sample still has enough space (246 m2/g) for the transfer of reactants (Table S2). Fig. 3 shows TEM images and EDS elemental mapping images as well as the size distributions of metal clusters in the synthesized catalysts. As to 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 (Fig. 3a–c), no metallic nanoparticles can be seen in the channels of S-1 zeolites. The corresponding EDS mapping images show that the Zn and Pt species are uniformly located at nearly identical positions, showing the formation of PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters at the nanoscale [43]. However, some large PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters (~6.1 nm) can be seen in 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 catalyst (Fig. 3d–f). The high-resolution TEM image of these large nanoclusters possesses clear lattice fringes of 0.226 nm, corresponding to the (1 1 1) plane of Pt3Zn (Fig. 3e) [12]. To further explore the dispersion degree of Pt-based catalysts, H2–O2 titration experiments were carried out (Table S2). The degree of Pt dispersion of 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 is higher than that of 0.3Pt@S-1 and 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1, which is in line with the results of XRD and TEM.

The local environment of platinum species was further investigated by FTIR spectroscopy with CO adsorption (Fig. 4), which was used to distinguish the highly dispersed metal nanoclusters and large metal particles. It has been reported that the FT-IR spectra of chemisorbed CO on reduced Pt generally consist of three ʋ(CO) types: Pt(CO)2 gem-dicarbonyl species, linear-adsorbed CO on Pt nanoparticles, and bridged adsorption on two neighboring Pt atoms [15], [45], [46], [47]. As shown in Fig. 4, two peaks at 2088 and 2009 cm−1 attributed to the symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching of CO from the isolated mononuclear Pt(CO)2 gem-dicarbonyl species are observed in 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1. However, only the peak at 2050 cm−1 ascribed to the linear-adsorbed CO on Pt nanoparticles in 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 is detected, but this peak barely exists in 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1, which is possibly attributable to the overlapping of the high-intensity peak centered at 2009 cm−1 [8], [16]. It is indicated that the bimetallic nanoclusters growth can be effectively confined by the in situ synthesis method, thus forming the ultrasmall diameter and high dispersion of PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters within S-1 zeolites.

3.2. Catalytic performance
The duration-of-PDH tests were performed over all the synthesized catalysts at low temperature (450 °C) with high WHSV value (13 h−1) to determine the intrinsic activity of the catalysts for PDH. The catalytic performance and carbon balance of these catalysts are displayed in Fig. S4 and Table S3. It can be observed that the monometallic 0.3Pt@S-1 catalyst exhibits little catalytic activity, and the mixture catalyst of 0.3Pt@S-1 and 0.5Zn@S-1 also shows activity similar to that of the monometallic catalysts (Fig. S4). The 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 catalyst prepared by impregnating Pt and Zn precursor solution on S-1 zeolites shows improved activity compared with that of the monometallic catalysts, suggesting that the PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters could be active sites to improve the catalytic activity significantly for the formation of propene in PDH. Notably, the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst shows the best catalytic performance in PDH with 14.4% propane conversion and 99.8% selectivity to propene (Fig. S4). This could be attributed to the ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters, which can expose more active sites than large PtZn nanoparticles. Moreover, the electron-rich Pt species of the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst could be beneficial to improve propene selectivity, as proved by the XPS analysis (Fig. 2) [48]. As shown in Fig. 5a, the activity of 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst attains 74.7 min−1, which is higher than that of 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 catalyst (69.1 min−1) and 0.3Pt@S-1 catalyst (4.8 min−1). These indicate that high dispersion of Pt nanoclusters can ensure maximum utilization of Pt atoms during the PDH reaction.

The activation energies of PDH over these Pt-based catalysts are obtained by fitting an Arrhenius plot and the results are shown in Fig. 5b. All activation energies obtained here are in the range 50–70 kJ/mol, consistent with those of reported Pt-based catalysts [48], [49], [50]. The apparent activation energies (Ea) of 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1, 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1, and 0.3Pt@S-1 catalysts are 51.4, 56.8, and 63.1 kJ/mol, respectively. Moreover, the decreased Ea value of 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 compared with 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 further explains the higher catalytic activity of the ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters.
The effect of Pt and Zn loading on PDH catalytic performances over PtZn@S-1 catalysts was further investigated. It is indicated that Zn loading of PtZn@S-1 has an important influence on the PDH reaction (Fig. S5a). The influence of Zn loading on these catalysts should be ascribed to the Pt–Zn interactions [51]. In addition, the loading of Pt is increased from 0.05 to 0.35 wt% while the loading of Zn (0.5 wt%) remains unchanged, which keeps the structure unchanged. The result shows that the initial activity correlates linearly with the Pt content, demonstrating the formation of highly dispersed PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters (Fig. S5b). Notably, the intersection of the fitting line with the Y-axis is not zero due to the weak catalytic ability of Zn species [27], [52]. Combining the results of TOF values for catalytic performance and the effect of Pt loading, it can be concluded that the intrinsic active sites of the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst for PDH may be ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters.
3.3. Stability measurement
Pt sintering is a common problem in many supported catalysts in high-temperature reactions, and their stabilities and recyclabilities are very critical for industrial applications. During the PDH at 525 °C, the initial propylene formation rate for 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 is 1.4 times that for 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1, while the conversion of propane increases to 37.1% for 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 compared with 30.1% for 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 (Fig. 6a). Under such reaction conditions, the propylene formation rate decreases dramatically from 16.6 to 14.0 mol g-1Pt h−1 for 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 after 20 h of reaction. In contrast, the deactivation of 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 is not seen after 20 h of reaction. In order to further verify the stability of the catalysts, the reaction temperature was increased to 550 °C. After 20 h on stream, the propylene formation rate drops from 21.5 to 17.9 mol g-1Pt h−1 for 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1, while for 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1, the formation rate of propene only drops from 28.2 to 27.4 mol g-1Pt h−1. Moreover, the propylene formation rate only drops from 28.2 to 26.7 mol g-1Pt h−1 even after 60 h of reaction (Fig. 6b). In the case of deactivation, a first-order deactivation model for estimating catalyst stability is shown in Fig. 6c. The detailed specific activity and deactivation rate of some representative Pt-based catalysts from the literature and this work are described in Table S4. A lower deactivation rate of 0.002 h−1 and a higher specific activity of 1.53 s−1 for the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst at the WHSV value of 6.5 h−1 demonstrate its higher catalytic activity and stability than the 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 catalyst (0.015 h−1, 1.16 s−1). It is confirmed that the stability of metal clusters can be improved significantly by the confinement effect of zeolites.

(c) Specific activity and deactivation rate of some representative Pt-based catalysts represented in the literature and in this work (see Table S4). (d) Catalytic performance on the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst for four successive PDH cycles at 600 °C. Each cycle includes a 5-h PDH step at 600 °C, followed by treatment in air at 500 °C for 0.5 h to remove the deposited coke and then under H2 at 500 °C for 0.5 h. The reactor is flushed with N2 between these steps. Reaction conditions: 200 mg of sample, atmospheric pressure, WHSVpropane = 6.5 h−1, C3H8:N2 = 11:19 with flow rate 30 mL min−1.
The recycling stability of PDH over 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst was also investigated in successive oxidation–reduction cycles. As shown in Fig. 6d, the activity obtained over the catalyst is almost the same as that of the fresh catalyst during four cycles. Additionally, H2–O2 titration measurement for the spent 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst (Table S2) shows that the high dispersion of Pt in 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst is well maintained during the PDH reaction. Furthermore, the crystallinity and the metal loading amount of 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst remain almost unchanged (Table S1 and Fig. S6), further confirming its cycle stability.
3.4. Coke formation
The other main factor in catalyst deactivation is coke formation [1]. To measure the coke amount on the surface of spent catalysts, TGA analysis was performed (Fig. 7). There are two weight loss steps in the temperature ranges of 30–250 and 250–500 °C, attributed to the evaporation of adsorbed water and the decomposition of coke, respectively [53]. 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst shows a slight weight loss of 0.2% after 5 h of reaction. In particular, 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst after 60 h of reaction only has a weight loss of 0.8%, indicating that it possesses strong carbon deposition resistance ability due to the low acidity of S-1 zeolites. This is in line with the high catalytic stability of 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst (Fig. 6).

3.5. Shape-selective catalytic reaction
As an important high-value-added reaction, selective reductions of p-chloronitrobenzene (CINB) and 1,3-dimethyl-5-nitrobenzene (DMNB) were selected as the model reactions over the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 and 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 catalysts (Scheme 2). Under identical reaction conditions, the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst shows catalytic activity in selectivity and conversion similar to those of the 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 catalyst in the reduction of CINB. However, the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst exhibits much lower conversion for the reduction of DMNB than the 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 catalyst, which is attributed to the fact that DMNB cannot enter the S-1 zeolite channels because of its bulky molecular size (7.2 × 6.6 Å) [54]. This further demonstrates that the PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters are encapsulated into the S-1 zeolites rather than on the surface of S-1 zeolites. Moreover, the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst shows excellent shape-selective catalytic activity.

3.6. Discussion
3.6.1. Size effect of PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters
Referring to the previous studies, the highly dispersed Pt-containing catalysts with small size can effectively catalyze PDH, which is due to the fact that the smaller Pt-containing clusters with more coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms on steps and corners have higher dehydrogenation activity because of attractive interaction between the undercoordinated Pt and propane [55], [56]. Simultaneously, the Zn sites tend to selectively cover low-coordination Pt sites, likely the Pt–Sn catalyst system [46], [50]. As expected, the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst with ultrasmall size exhibits better catalytic performance than that of the 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 and 0.3Pt@S-1 catalysts (Fig. 5, Fig. 6), proving that the propylene production rates are enhanced by the small PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters.
On the other hand, the smaller Pt-containing clusters may bear a higher electron charge because of their higher unsaturation degree, so other metals could transfer more electrons to the Pt species [55]. To analyze the influence on the electronic environment of nearby Pt atoms caused by the size effect of PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters and its effect on C3H6 desorption and the formation of coke, the Zn2p XPS spectra and C3H6 TPD experiments were carried out over the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 and 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 catalysts and then discussed. As displayed in Fig. S8a, it can be seen that the binding energy of Zn in 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 is increased by 0.5 eV from that in 0.3Pt@S-1 due to the Pt–Zn interactions, indicating that electrons are transferred from Zn to Pt. In comparison, for the 0.3Pt/S-1 and 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 (Fig. S8b), the Pt–Zn interaction in 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 increases the binding energy for Zn by 0.2 eV. It is demonstrated that Zn sites in smaller 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalysts could contribute more electrons to Pt sites.
The interactions of propene with the synthesized catalysts were studied by C3H6 TPD, and the results are shown in Figs. S7 and 8. It is notable that no evident desorbed propene signal is detectable in S-1, indicating weak interaction between propene and S-1 support, thus improving the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst stability for PDH (Fig. S7). It has been demonstrated that the desorption temperature can be used to evaluate the interaction strength between propene and catalyst [26], [57]. As shown in Fig. 8, the C3H6 TPD desorption curves of these catalysts could be fitted into three peaks located at ~290, ~390, and ~460 °C, attributed to the weak adsorption of propene (I), medium adsorption of propene (II), and strong adsorption of propene (III), respectively [57]. Obviously, the desorption peaks of both 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 and 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 catalysts shift to lower temperatures, in comparison with those of 0.3Pt@S-1. The Zn species could reduce the interaction between propylene and Pt-based catalysts, thus reducing the adsorption of propylene. Especially, the propylene desorbed temperature of 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 is much lower than that of 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1, revealing a weaker interaction between propylene and Pt species in the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst. The promoted desorption of propene is ascribed to increased electron donation from Zn species to Pt species in the smaller 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 catalyst, as proved by XPS spectra (Fig. S8). It is concluded that the electron-rich Pt species in ultrasmall 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalysts are beneficial to repel the electron-rich propene and coke precursors and thereby increase the stability of catalyst and propylene selectivity in PDH [58]. This is in line with the results of catalytic performance (Fig. 5, Fig. 6) and TG experiments (Fig. 7).

3.6.2. Confinement effect of S-1 zeolites
It has been reported that small bimetallic nanocatalysts, especially non-noble-metal-containing nanoparticles, tend to suffer from severe aggregation, metal leaching, and sintering during high temperature reaction due to their high surface free energy [50], [59], [60]. In this work, the ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters inside S-1 zeolites prepared by in situ synthesis show excellent stability. During the 60 h on stream at 550 °C, the propylene formation rate only decreased from 28.2 to 26.7 mol g-1Pt h−1 and no visible sintering of PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters was observed (Fig. S6). Note that the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst also exhibited exceptional cyclic stability during four PDH cycles after oxidation–reduction treatment at 600 °C (Fig. 6d). Combined with the results of characterization analysis over the spent catalysts, it can be concluded that the stability of the encapsulated metal clusters can be significantly enhanced by the confinement effect of zeolites.
4. Conclusions
Well-distributed and ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters inside S-1 zeolites have been synthesized via a facile in situ synthesis approach. The 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst shows outstanding catalytic performance in PDH, with a 45.3% propane conversion and a >99% selectivity to propene at 550 °C due to ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters with a higher dehydrogenation activity. In addition, the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst exhibits excellent stability during PDH as well as good shape selectivity because of the good confinement of PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters within the S-1 zeolites. The superior catalytic activities and high stability of these ultrasmall metal clusters confined in zeolites not only create a new option for the generation of propene during PDH but also provide more possibilities for application in other high-performance catalytic reactions.
