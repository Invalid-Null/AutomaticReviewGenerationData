Characterization of redox and acid properties of mesoporous Cr–TiO2 and its efficient performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
Abstract
Mesoporous Cr–TiO2 materials with chromium content from 0.02 to 0.30 (Cr/Ti molar ratio) were synthesized using a nonionic Pluronic F127 surfactant, and the mesostructure was confirmed by BET, SAXS and TEM. The stability of the mesoporous structure under the atmospheres of propane oxidative dehydrogenation (PODH) and air was investigated. The variety in valence states and the distribution of Cr species on the surface were also evaluated by WXRD, XPS, UV–vis and H2-TPR methods. The acid properties including kinds, number and strength were measured by NH3-TPD and IR-Py experiment. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene employed as a probe reaction suggested that the catalytic performance relates closely with the content of Cr, the easily reducible soluble Cr species, and the modification of the acid properties on the surface, while TiCr0.15 catalyst performs good conversion and selectivity, with a yield of propylene near 19%.

1. Introduction
After the discovery of M41S silicate materials, the extension of the surfactant templating procedure to form non-silica mesoporous oxides has never been stopped, due to their various applications such as catalysis, sorption, chemical and biological separation, photonic and electronic devices and drug delivery [1], [2]. Among these materials, TiO2 is one of the most important metal oxides in heterogeneous catalysis because of its broad functionality, long-term stability and nontoxicity. High-quality mesoporous TiO2 can now be easily and reproducibly prepared [3], [4], but there are still some disadvantages such as the limited active sites on its surface and the aggregation of its mesostructure under high temperatures [5], [6]. Thus, the incorporation of various heteroatoms into the mesoporous or nano-sized structure to embed a catalytic function is of tremendous interest [7], [8], [9], [10].
Catalytic dehydrogenation represents a route to obtain olefins from low-cost alkanes, especially propane and ethane, and possesses both theoretical and industrial significance [11]. For propane dehydrogenation, vanadium and molybdenum catalysts have been extensively studied, while supported chromium catalysts also show competitive performance. The oxidation state of chromium, structure (amorphous or crystalline, chromate or dichromate) and the interaction of chromium with the support are the main factors that determine its catalytic performance. More interestingly, these factors could be controlled by varying the metallic content, the precursor, the support characteristics and calcination conditions [12].
Catalysts using TiO2 as the support have been extended to the PODH reaction as well [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Moreover, for chromium catalysts, TiO2 even appears to be the most suitable support compared by the dispersion amount of chromium oxide on different supports and the catalytic performance in PODH [18].
However, despite having great potential, reports about the application of mesoporous Ti–Cr materials are still seldom. Mesoporous structure allows the reactants access additional active sites in the pores and has advantages in mass diffusion and transportation, as well as other unpredicted beneficial properties, which may improve catalytic activity.
In view of the above, it is quite interesting for us to synthesize mesoporous materials and test their catalytic performance in PODH reaction. In this work, we prepared a series of Ti–Cr oxide catalysts and studied the influence of Cr content on mesopores (surface area, pore volume and stability), surface properties (chromium valence distribution, reducibility, and acid property of the chromium species) and catalytic performance (propane conversion, yield to propylene) of these catalysts. Attempts have been made to correlate the PODH results with the composition of the catalysts and the nature of the active sites.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
All catalysts are prepared by solvent evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) method, similar to the procedure previously reported [7]. Ti–Cr catalysts with different Cr contents are denoted as TiCrx, where x represents Cr/Ti molar ratio. In a typical synthesis of TiCr0.15, 15 mmol of Ti(OBu)4, 60 mmol of HOAc, 18 mmol of HNO3, 0.75 mmol of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, and 2.4 g of F127 (EO96PO70EO96, MW = 12,000 g/mol) were dissolved in 45 ml ethanol solution. After vigorously stirred for 60 min, the transparent blue solution was transferred to a Petri dish (diameter 90 mm), and evaporated at 40 °C for 12 h until a blue transparent membrane formed. Then the temperature increased to 65 °C and maintained 24 h. The obtained dried blue membrane was calcined at 350 °C in air for 5 h with a ramping rate of 2 °C/min. Another TiCr0.15 catalyst was calcined at 540 °C for 5 h in air for comparison, and it was denoted as TiCr0.15 calcined at 540 °C in air mentioned in the after part. The as-synthesized materials were ground into fine powders before reaction, and all catalysts are dark gray except for mesoporous TiO2 which shows white color. For the synthesis of TiCr0.15-impregnation catalyst, commercial TiO2 (from Shanghai Chemicals, China, AR) with BET surface area of 45 m2 g−1 was used as the support. Corresponding amount of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (molar ratio of Cr/Ti = 0.15) was dissolved in appropriate ethanol solution. The resulting solution was added dropwise to the supports. After impregnation for overnight, the sample was dried at 65 °C for 12 h and calcined at 350 °C in air for 5 h with a ramping rate of 2 °C/min.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
Powder XRD patterns of the samples were obtained on an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku-D/Max-B automated powder X-ray diffractometer) operating at 45 kV and 40 mA using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The pore structure was determined by small angle scanning in 2θ range of 0.6–10°, and the crystal phase was obtained by wide-angle scanning in 2θ range of 10–80°.
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded on a TriStar II 3020 V1.03 instrument at 77 K. Before the measurement, the samples were evacuated at 473 K for 2 h. The total surface area was determined by the Braunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and the pore size distributions were calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halender (BJH) model.
Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images were obtained over a JEM-2100 instrument operating at 200 kV.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were carried out on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 system with Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV). The X-ray anode was run at 150 W, and binding energies were calibrated using the C 1s line as a standard (284.8 eV).
The ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra of the samples in the range of 200–800 nm were measured on a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV 2450) using BaSO4 as standard.
H2-temperature programed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out in a flow reactor system using 20 mg of catalysts. The sample was reduced in a 10% H2/Ar stream (40 ml/min) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 100 to 600 °C. H2 consumption was measured by TCD.
The acid character of the catalysts were studied by the temperature-programed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD). All catalysts were pretreated in Ar at 300 °C for 30 min and chemisorbed under NH3 when the temperature cooled to 50 °C. After purging the reactor with Ar for 1 h, the experiments were carried out with a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 50 to 600 °C. The desorption of NH3 was analyzed by TCD. Surface acidity properties were also determined by FT-IR monitoring of adsorption of pyridine in a Perkin-Elmer 16PC spectrometer. After outgassing, the probe molecule was adsorbed at room temperature and a spectrum was recorded. Further spectra were recorded after outgassing at increasing temperature from room temperature to 573 K.
The PODH reaction was carried out in a tubular fixed bed flow quartz reactor (i.d. 7.4 mm, 270 mm long) under atmosphere pressure. In a typical condition, the reaction was tested at 540 °C, GHSV = 4500 ml (g h)−1, Propane/O2 molar ratio = 2:1. The feedstock and reaction products were analyzed on-line by gas chromatography with two column types: Porapak QS (4.0 m × 1/8 in.) and TDX-01 (2.0 m × 1/8 in.).
3. Results
3.1. Catalytic performance for PODH
Table 1 presents the performance for PODH reaction on mesoporous Ti–Cr catalysts. It can be seen that the conversion of propane increases from 19.2% to 57.3% as the Cr/Ti ratio increases from 0.02 to 0.20, while in TiCr0.30 the conversion decreases. The selectivity of propylene shows almost the reverse trend as conversion, but is always above 40% before TiCr0.15. These results indicate that Cr species in the mesoporous Ti–Cr catalysts have a great effect on the reaction. In TiCr0.15-impregnation catalyst, the conversion is extremely high to 65%, but the selectivity of propylene is considerably low. Evolution of catalytic performances with time for TiCr0.15 catalyst is presented in Fig. 1A. The propylene selectivity increases slightly at the first 100 min and then reaches a steady state. Averaging the experimental point, the propylene selectivity is 43.2% with propane conversion of 43.8% over the TiCr0.15 catalyst.

Fig. 1B shows propylene selectivity as a function of propane conversion varied by contact time on TiCr0.15 and TiCr0.15-impregnation catalysts. As can be seen, the propylene selectivity decreases with the increase of propane conversion, which testifies the consecutive reaction of propylene degradation. It is also apparently that the mesoporous sample is favored for higher propylene selectivity at the same conversion.

(C) Catalytic performance of TiCr0.15 as a function of propane: oxygen molar ratio, GHSV and reaction temperature in the PODH reaction: conversion of propane (□), selectivity of propylene (●), yield of propylene (○), COx (▾) and C1–C3 (■).
Fig. 1C presents the catalytic performances of TiCr0.15 catalyst under the different reactive conditions (propane/oxygen ratio, GHSV and temperature). High oxygen partial pressure leads to great activity but COx dominating in the products. Increasing the propane/oxygen molar ratio to 3:1 favors selective oxidation products. In addition, catalysts in low GHSV and high temperature show high activity but low selectivity of propylene. Based upon the activity and selectivity, propane/oxygen molar ratio of 2:1, GHSV of 4500 ml (g h)−1 and the reaction temperature of 540 °C have been chosen to be the best reaction conditions.
3.2. Formation of mesopores
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and BJH pore-size distribution of several Ti–Cr catalysts are presented in Fig. 2. The hysteresis loop between partial pressures (p/p0) of 0.4 and 0.8 for the as-made TiO2 shows typical type-IV isotherm, indicating mesoporous TiO2 has been successfully synthesized. Cr-incorporated samples also display type-IV isotherm and they are of mesoporous materials too. As can be seen from Table 2, all the samples exhibited reasonably high BET surface area in the range of 200–330 m2 g−1. The doping of Cr causes a considerable increase of the surface area from TiCr0.06 to TiCr0.30, and the pore volumes increase except for TiCr0.06. The above results suggest that appropriate incorporation of Cr makes no perturbation on the mesostructure of TiO2. The surface area and pore volume of the TiCr0.15 catalyst decreased after used for the PODH reaction, which illuminates aggregation occurs in the reaction conditions and some channels are blocked. However, the mesostructure is largely preserved as it still keeps type-IV isotherm. Compared with that of the above catalyst, surface area of the TiCr0.15 catalyst calcined at 540 °C in air reduced greatly (56 cm2 g−1), indicating the mesopores are largely destroyed.

b
TiCr0.15-C is the catalyst of TiCr0.15 prepared by calcining in air at 540 °C.
In order to give more information about the mesopores, small angle X-ray diffraction spectra (SAXS) was progressed. As can be seen in Fig. 3, TiCr0.15 used before the catalytic reaction shows strong reflections at 2θ = 1.18, 1.42° with d values of 7.45, 6.20 nm, indicating the presence of mesopores. The weak reflections on the edge illuminate the coexistance of disordered pores. After the catalytic test at 540 °C, the main reflections can still be detected with d values of 7.11, 5.73 nm, which means the mesopores are largely reserved. However, these reflections are broad and less resolved, making us to believe that the mesopores suffered certain degree of aggregation or collapsing during the high temperature of the catalytic test. Meantime, the decrease of the d-values is indicative of the contraction of the TiO2 lattice. The above results suggest that the mesopores of the as-made Ti–Cr catalysts are mainly preserved, while part of them suffered aggregation or collapsed in the PODH reaction atmosphere, consolidating the BET results. Reflections for TiCr0.15 catalyst calcined at 540 °C in air is weak and broad, illustrating that most of the mesostructure are destroyed, resulting in low surface area.

3.3. Bulk and surface structural characterization
Wide-angle XRD patterns of the samples are shown in Fig. 5. The diagrams of the mesoporous Ti–Cr catalysts show the characteristic diffractions at 2θ = 25.36°, 37.82°, 48.06° and 55.10°, which can be indexed to the TiO2 anatase phase (JCPDS No.: 86-1157). No rutile or brookite impurities were detected, and no measurable crystalline Cr2O3 diffractions at 2θ = 33.62°, 36.34°, 41.56°, 54.88° (JCPDS No.: 84-1616) were observed until TiCr0.30. After the PODH reaction, only anatase was detected (Fig. 5g) in the mesoporous TiCr0.15 catalyst, indicating no transformation from anatase to rutile occurred during the catalytic process. The anatase peaks of the sample prepared by impregnation are sharp and intense (Fig. 5a), while those of the mesoporous samples are relatively broad and less resolved, illustrating that the mesoporous samples possess worse crystal phase of anatase. Typical crystal Cr2O3 is detected in the TiCr0.15-impregnation catalyst, but the phase is only detected in the mesoporous sample with Cr/Ti molar ratio of 0.30, indicating that the EISA method is propitious to Cr dispersion and less organized stacking arrangement of the Cr species.

XPS results of the mesoporous Ti–Cr catalysts reveal the presence of only Cr, Ti, O, and C on the surface. As shown in Fig. 6A, the deconvoluted Cr 2p3/2 profiles of the four catalysts indicate there are multiple oxidation states. Binding energies of 579.6, 578.9, 578.0, 577.1, 576.1 eV were obtained and could be accounted for Cr(VI, V, IV, III, II), respectively [19]. The Cr/(Cr + Ti) atomic ratios on the surface are also displayed in Table 3. It is observed that the value of Cr/(Cr + Ti) increases greatly from TiCr0.06 to TiCr0.15 and then retains immovability basically between TiCr0.15 and TiCr0.30. Fig. 6B summarizes the distribution of different Cr valance states with increasing Cr content. In all the catalysts, Cr(VI) and Cr(III) are dominating on the surface. However, on the surface of TiCr0.06 catalyst, the sum of Cr(V), Cr(IV) and Cr(II) states still accounts for almost 25%, while on the surface of TiCr0.20 catalyst, Cr(V) and Cr(IV) disappear.

The Unit Cell Volume is calculated by V = a2c, where a and c are the unit cell parameters for the catalysts with mainly anatase phase.
Fig. 7 shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of the samples with increasing Cr content. Similar to previous report [20], the absorption edge of mesoporous TiO2 is at around 400 nm. Reports have shown that crystal Cr2O3 gives main absorptions at around 450–465 nm, and 601 nm. For Cr2O3, the 450–465 nm bands are related to the OCr(III) charge transfer, and 580–600 nm are related to d–d transitions of Cr(III) in octahedral symmetry, respectively [21]. However, the former band may be overlapping with the absorption caused by symmetry forbidden Cr(VI) in Td coordination when Cr(VI) coexist.

From Fig. 7, all catalysts show UV absorptions of TiO2 and additional bands of 455–470 nm and 600 nm or 710 nm. The bands of the mesoporous samples (from c to g) are broad and less resolved, indicating the forming of oxygen vacancies or the distortion of the polymeric chromate species [22]. The band of 370 nm is characteristic of the Cr6+O2− charge transfer transition [23]. Nevertheless, it may be masked by the strong absorption of TiO2 in this region. The assignment of the 455–470 nm bands in Cr catalysts has been a point of discussion [24], [25]. In this experiment, we consider it to be caused by both symmetry forbidden Cr(VI) in Td coordination and Cr(III) in octahedral coordination, as they are difficult to be excluded. The absorption of symmetry forbidden Cr(VI) depends upon the distortion of surface Cr species, and it appears when the degree of aggregation increases. Compared with the impregnated one, the band at 580–600 nm, which is indicative of polymerized Cr(III) in high Cr content catalyst, vanishes in all mesoporous samples, and the band at about 710 nm appears. It could suggest that absorption of Cr(III) species in the mesoporous samples has a red-shift as the interaction of Cr(III) species with Ti oxide. All of the mesoporous catalysts show this band, indicating Cr species easily aggregate on the surface.
3.4. Reducibility behavior and acid properties characterization
Fig. 8 shows the H2-TPR profiles of the mesoporous Ti–Cr catalysts. The high valance states of Cr(VI, V, IV) can be reduced to Cr(III) by H2 [12]. As mesoporous TiO2 gives no reduction in this region, there are mainly Cr(III) on the surface after the H2-TPR experiment. TiCr0.06 catalyst contains two reduction peaks at 295 °C (low temperature reduction peak, LR) and 336 °C (high temperature reduction peak, HR). They are attributed to the reduction of two kinds of Cr(VI) species, the soluble and the grafted Cr(VI), respectively, to Cr(III) [23]. The soluble Cr(VI) are easier to be reduced than the grafted Cr(VI), since the latter always present as isolated chromates on the surface of catalyst and offer greater interaction with the bulk TiO2 [25]. Based on the above, the HR corresponds to the reduction of grafted Cr(VI) species and the LR may result from reduction of soluble Cr(VI).

It can be seen that with the increase of Cr, the HR shifts to lower temperature, while LR hardly moves. Meanwhile, the amount of H2 consumption by TPR increases up to TiCr0.20 catalyst (Table 3). It may be that the degree of aggregation increases as the Cr/Ti molar ratio increases and results in larger amount of soluble Cr(VI) species. The amount of H2 consumption for the TiCr0.20 catalyst is almost equivalent to that of TiCr0.30 catalyst. As Cr(III) can hardly be reduced by H2, the relative constant value of H2 consumption could speculate out that the excess Cr (compared with Cr/Ti = 0.20) in this region are more favorable to form Cr(III).
The total amount of surface acidity could be detected by ammonia TPD method as displayed in Fig. 9. The broad and weak desorption band of TiO2 (band b) ranged from 180 to 480 °C indicates its wide acid strength distribution, in accord with previous report [20]. Mesoporous Cr doped samples have desorption band mainly lied between 160 and 400 °C. The acid amount in this region increases greatly with the addition of Cr and arrives almost the maximal in TiCr0.30, while there is hardly change in the acid strength. The TiCr0.15-impregnation catalyst shows mainly desorption temperature between 500 and 580 °C, suggesting its much stronger acid strength. A weak peak at temperatures above 470 °C unfolds in the mesoporous sample. Compared with the TiCr0.15-impregnation catalyst and TiO2, the peak may be produced by Cr species. It moves to higher temperature with the addition of Cr, indicating the increase of its acid strength. While the intensity gets weaker, indicating the quantity of such acid sites decrease in high Cr/Ti molar ratio.

In order to give some information about the nature of the surface acid sites, FT-IR spectroscopy was progressed using pyridine (Py) as a probe molecule. Fig. 10 shows the FTIR spectra recorded after adsorption of pyridine at room temperature on the mesoporous samples and followed outgassing at different temperatures. In the r.t. outgassing one, all the catalysts show four bands at 1605, 1575, 1489 and 1445 cm−1, which can be ascribed to the stretching modes of pyridine ring coordinated to surface Lewis acid sites [26]. In addition, two peaks at 1640 and 1540 cm−1 exist and the intensity increases from TiCr0.06 to TiCr0.20. As Ti oxide sample has negligible Brønsted acid sites, the peaks demonstrate the addition of Cr leads to the formation of Brønsted acid sites, in accord with the reports [27] [28]. In the 300 °C outgassing ones, the intensity of the 1445 and 1605 cm−1 bands is quite similar with the r.t. outgassing samples, while the intensity at the 1575 cm−1 is much weaker. It indicates that the sites locating at 1445 and 1605 cm−1 are strong Lewis acid centers and at 1575 cm−1 is weak or medium ones. Similarly, sites at the 1540 cm−1 and 1640 cm−1 are largely absent in the 300 °C outgassing samples, indicating they are weak Brønsted acid sites. A new band at 1473 cm−1 appears in the spectra of 300 °C outgassing one, this can be attributed to the decomposition products of pyridine coordinated to surface sites at high temperature [27].

4.1. Stability of the mesostructure
Based on the BET, SAXS and TEM results, it can be concluded that the as-synthesized materials have high surface area and disordered mesopores, which can still be detected in Cr content as high as Cr/Ti = 0.30 (molar ratio). Mesoporous TiO2 was always calcined at temperatures below 400 °C during the preparation process and was employed to a reaction at the temperature below [29]. In this experiment, the best catalytic performance was obtained at reaction temperature of 540 °C, while the TiCr0.15 catalyst was prepared only calcined at 350 °C. Despite the high reaction temperature, the mesoporous structure is mainly preserved as can be seen from the BET and SAXS results, although certain degree of aggregation may block some of the pores. The incorporation of Cr may have an effect on the phase transformation from anatase to rutile, as well as the stability of the mesopores [30]. All of the catalysts are calcined and mainly tested below 550 °C, which is considered to be the beginning phase transformation temperature [31], and the transformation from anatase to rutile has not been detected in our experiment (Fig. 5). In order to expound why the mesostructure is stable under the reaction conditions, the catalyst with the same Cr content was prepared at temperature of 540 °C in air. SAXS and BET results showed that the catalyst suffered largely aggregation of the mesopores and had low surface area (Table 2). It indicates the reaction atmosphere may have a beneficial effect on stabilizing the structure, which means mesostructure of TiO2 can be stable at high temperature in certain conditions. Specific and exact mechanism for stabilizing mesoporous titanium oxide still need deducing, and such result has an implication for the synthesis of stable mesoporous transition metal oxides and enlarge their application to high temperature reactions.
4.2. Characterizations of Cr on the surface of mesopores and in the bulk
It is generally accepted that the nature of Cr oxide depends strongly on its surface density and the specific support used [32]. In this experiment, several methods were applied attempting to elucidate the existent form of Cr species. WXRD results reveal the general features of the catalysts, and the patterns showed only anatase TiO2 diffraction until up to TiCr0.30, which exhibited slight evidence of σ-Cr2O3. It means Cr species are well dispersed in large range of Cr/Ti molar ratio. In view of the synthesis approach, it is reasonable to estimate that part of the doping ions are incorporated into the framework during the self-assembly of the surfactant. Because the ionic radii of Cr(III) and Ti(IV) are very close (0.615 Å and 0.605 Å, respectively), Ti(IV) in the bulk may be replaced by the incorporated Cr ions during calcination. The substitution of Cr(III) with Ti(IV) in the anatase structure would cause an expansion of the Unit Cell Volume. As for Cr(VI), given the small radius of Cr(VI) (0.44 Å), an appreciable decrease of the Unit Cell Volume should be produced with the substitution of Ti(IV) by Cr(VI). To prove this point, the Unit Cell Volumes of the samples analyzed by XRD results are shown in Table 3. It can be seen that except for the value of TiO2 which is slightly smaller, all the other samples are larger than TiO2, indicating the substitution of Ti(IV) by Cr(III) occurs. The amount of Cr that can dissolve into the TiO2 structure are rather small (<Cr/Ti = 0.02, molar ratio) [33], while the doping amount are large in our materials. The Unit Cell Volumes of the Cr doped catalysts are relatively constant, possibly illuminating that the substitution reaches the limit amount in all of the Cr-doped mesoporous samples, coincide with previous reports [33], [34]. The substitution can be electrically compensated for by oxygen vacancies, as have been discussed in Section 3.3 (UV–vis part), that oxygen vacancies may lead to the broad band of the UV–vis absorption in Fig. 7.
According to reports, Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species easily aggregate on the surface of TiO2 due to the characteristic interaction of Cr with Ti oxide [35]. Moreover, increasing doping amount leads to the larger quantity of reducible Cr(VI) species. In our catalysts, Cr(VI) are polymerized as can be seen from the H2-TPR measurements (soluble Cr(VI) exist in all the samples) (Fig. 8).
Compared with the TiCr0.15-impregnation catalyst, σ-Cr2O3 forms in the latter one as showed in Fig. 5 (WXRD). This means that such doping amount of chromium on the surface is far above the monolayer requirement. The amount of monolayer coverage was obtained to be ∼4% Cr2O3 on TiO2 (Cr/Ti molar ratio ≈0.04) by detecting Cr2O3 microcrystals, which can be considered to form when the molar ratio of Cr/(Cr + Ti) on the surface kept a constant value as the doping ions increased [18]. In this experiment as the XPS results show, the ratio of Cr/(Cr + Ti) in the TiCr0.15 and TiCr0.20 catalysts are nearly the same. This is one of the evidences that such doping amount achieves approximately the monolayer coverage of polymerized Cr species on the surface. It may also be consolidated by the H2-TPR results, as the hydrogen consumption remained almost constant between TiCr0.20 and TiCr0.30 (Table 3), indicating that the increased doping of Cr mainly forms hardly reducible crystal Cr(III) species from TiCr0.20. The monolayer coverage is determined to be in TiCr0.15, and Cr species in TiCr0.06 is about 40% of the monolayer coverage, in which polymerized Cr(III) species are difficult to be excluded. As Cr2O3 has been detected in TiCr0.30, the degree of polymerization for Cr(III) should be increasing from Cr/Ti = 0.06 to 0.20.
Thus the likely picture is that before the formation of Cr2O3, some of the Cr species are polymerized, randomly dispersed and possibly amorphous on the surface of the mesopores, while a solid solution is formed inside the walls. Such structure may be significant for its performance in the PODH reaction especially when it reaches monolayer coverage of the doping species.
4.3. Correlation of catalytic performance with Cr species
In propane direct dehydrogenation using Cr species as the catalysts, the active species are believed to be coordination unsaturated Cr(III) ions, whereas the bulk Cr(III) ions with a perfect and stable octahedral surrounding are inactive [36]. With oxidant, the complicated reactions make it difficult to find a straightforward correlation between catalytic performance and specific properties of the mesoporous materials.
As discussed above, polymerized Cr species (CrOCr) gradually forms on the surface of the samples and then σ-Cr2O3 is detected. Correlated with the increased catalytic performance presented in Table 1, it may be suggested that the active sites are closely related to the degree of polymerization of Cr species on the surface. The conversion of propane increases gradually from 19.2% to 57.3% with the addition of Cr content from TiCr0.02 to TiCr0.20. Meantime, polymerized Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species on the surface also augment, indicating they should be beneficial for the catalytic performance. The catalyst of TiCr0.15-impregnation which contained relatively amount of σ-Cr2O3 (Cr(III)) on the surface exhibits the highest conversion of propane and the value is larger than the mesoporous TiCr0.15 catalyst by 20%, although its selectivity of propylene is lower. It implies that Cr(III) species is responsible for the conversion of propane. The higher degree of polymerization of the Cr(III) species, the better for the conversion of propane. Contrarily, the selectivity of propylene decreases gradually from 55.3% to 33.2% with the addition of Cr content. It also indicates that the polymeric Cr(III) species is disadvantageous to the selectivity, and the higher degree of polymerization of the Cr(III) species, the worse for the selectivity of propylene.
As can be seen from XPS results, Cr species is present in multiple oxidation states, while Cr(VI) and Cr(III) account for over 75%. In low Cr content catalysts as TiCr0.06, Cr(VI) species is prevailing on the surface and the catalyst has high selectivity of propylene. The selectivity descends with the decreasing proportion of Cr(VI) species on the surface when the addition of Cr content increases, which suggests that high dispersive Cr(VI) species is propitious to the selectivity. So the best performance of the catalysts needs appropriate Cr(III)/Cr(VI) molar ratio.
The redox cycle between Cr(VI) and Cr(III) played an important role in the PODH reaction [37]. The polymerized Cr(VI) species are easily reducible as confirmed by the TPR results, possibly because of the weak CrOTi bond [38]. On the other hand, Cr(III) species on TiO2 are easily oxidized to higher oxidation states, due to low activation energy of the oxidation and strong capability of electron transfer over CrOx/TiO2 [39]. Therefore, the polymeric chromate species on the surface of the mesoporous CrOx/TiO2 catalysts are of better redox capability. During the PODH reaction, the redox process in which large amount of polymerized chromium species were reduced by propane and were oxidized by oxygen made the reaction carry out more facile, which could be one of the reason why high catalytic activity can be obtained after Cr added into mesoporous TiO2.
In addition to the redox capability, the acid properties exhibited on the surface of the catalysts were believed to have considerable effect on the performance in PODH reaction. In our experiments, TiCr0.15-impregnation catalyst exhibited much higher catalytic activity than the mesoporous TiCr0.15 catalyst in the same test condition. It seems inconsistent with the discussion above as σ-Cr2O3 is mainly detected in the TiCr0.15-impregnation catalyst and coordination saturated Cr in σ-Cr2O3 is believed to be inactive. This may be explained by the acid properties: the existence of extremely strong acid sites results in a large number of cracking products (Table 1). Combined with the discussion above, we may speculate that such acid sites are related to the Cr(III), though it needs further deducing. The case is quite different in the mesoporous catalysts, since the nature and strength of the acid sites have been greatly modified by the interaction of Cr and Ti in mesoporous structure, leading to the change of catalytic performance. A large amount of Lewis acid sites with relative weak acid strength, possibly caused by the high surface area and better dispersion of the active sites, augment with the addition of Cr. At that time, the conversion of propane also rises. Although the addition of Cr produces Brønsted acid sites which are always considered beneficial for desorption of propylene, the low strength and the small amount of these sites make it difficult to availably affect the selectivity of propylene, especially at high temperature. Therefore, the amount and strength of Lewis acid are one of the reasons, which are responsible for the increase of the propane conversion and decrease of the propylene selectivity.
5. Conclusion
The as-synthesized materials exhibit large surface area of 200–300 m2 g−1 and the mesostructure is relatively stable in large incorporation of Cr content (TiCr0.30) and high temperatures (as high as 540 °C). The doping Cr ions dispersed well as CrOCr polymerized species on the surface, while in the bulk they form a solid solution with Ti oxide. TiCr0.15 catalyst with around monolayer coverage of Cr species gives the best catalytic performance, and the propylene selectivity was significantly enhanced compared with the one prepared by impregnation. Prevailing proportion of Cr(III) on the surface seems favorable for the conversion of propane, while Cr(VI) could make for the selectivity of propylene: the best performance needs appropriate Cr(III)/Cr(VI) molar ratio. The reaction is affected by complicated factors, and the acid properties seem crucial as well. The Lewis acid sites whose amount increased with the doping ions may account for the high activity, but also cause the relative low selectivity to propylene. Our next interest is the quantitative import of alkali metals to modulate the acid amount. In addition, it may be meaningful to explore effective steps to increase the strength of the Brønsted acid sites produced by the incorporated Cr species. As TiO2′ electronic property is greatly affected by the doping ions, the as-synthesized mesoporous materials could also exhibit advantage in photocatalytic reactions, such as the photodegradation of phenol, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of nitric oxide by ammonia.
