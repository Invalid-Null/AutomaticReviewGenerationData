Abstract
Germanium has emerged recently as a potential promoter for Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) . However, its general practicality with other noble metals remains unexplored. Herein, the catalytic performance of Pd-Ge/SiO2 was investigated in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), wherein a significant improvement of the catalytic performance was obtained by Ge addition. Pd2/SiO2, the unpromoted sample, shows an initial conversion and selectivity of 21.0% and 53.6% at 550 °C, respectively. In addition, it deactivates rapidly with a deactivation constant (kd) of 1.7 × 10−2 min−1. Ge-promoted samples exhibit a slight decrease in activity, while catalyst selectivity and stability significantly increase. Upon adding 1 wt.% Ge (Pd2-Ge1/SiO2), the initial conversion decreases to 15.2%, whereas the initial selectivity increases to 91.9%. Further addition of Ge (2 wt.%, Pd2-Ge2/SiO2) leads to an initial conversion of 12.5% and an initial selectivity of 95.0%. Regarding catalyst stability, the deactivation constant is almost one order of magnitude lower for Ge-promoted catalysts (i.e., with 1 wt.% and 2 wt.% Ge); 2.9 × 10−3 min−1 and 2.0 × 10−3 min−1, respectively. The characterization results indicate that Ge imposes geometric and electronic modifications on Pd, decreasing catalytic activity for structure-sensitive side reactions and facilitating propylene desorption from surface. Hence, both the selectivity and stability of the catalysts have been significantly enhanced.

1. Introduction
Propylene (C3H6) is the second most important starting material in the petrochemical industry for producing a variety of products such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, among others, resulting in a high-demanded chemical commodity [1], [2], [3]. Despite the major production route of propylene is from naphtha cracking, direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH reaction) to form propylene has recently taken up a significant share of industrial propylene production [4, 5]. There are a few factors as to why propane dehydrogenation is gaining popularity. Firstly, it is due to decreasing fossil oil resources which are widely utilized for olefin production, while the demand of propylene, being a key raw material for the petrochemical industry, has continuously increased. In addition, the newfangled shale gas revolution has provided huge sources of propane, which can be used as an inexpensive feedstock to produce propylene [6, 7]. Moreover, propane dehydrogenation has the highest propylene yield among all the different available technologies [8].
Commercially, PDH reaction is carried out by the Catofin process on chromium-based catalysts in multiple parallel fixed bed reactors or by Oleflex process on Pt-based catalyst using a fluidized bed reactor [9, 10]. Because of the endothermic nature of the reaction, high reaction temperatures are required to achieve acceptable yields [11], which cause catalyst deactivation by sintering and coke formation [12]. For example, CrOx-based catalysts are highly active but conversion drops over time since the catalyst deactivates due to coke deposition on the catalyst [13, 14]. Hence, the catalyst has to be regenerated over time; However, even with regeneration, the loss of catalyst activity is not entirely recovered [15]. In addition, the toxicity of Cr(VI) in Cr-based catalysts discourages any further application of such catalystst [16]. Pt-based catalysts have been widely used by the Oleflex process due to their superior C–H bond activation [17, 18]. However, undesirable side reactions such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coke formation still occur [1]. Even though the catalyst can be regenerated by oxidative processes, these treatments usually lead to the sintering of the Pt nanoparticles, which causes the loss of active metal surface. [19]. Similarly, other noble metal catalysts usually exhibit poor selectivity in PDH reaction and rapidly deactivates due to coke formation [20]. Accordingly, it is essential to develop robust and active catalysts by tailoring the structure and fine-tuning the surface chemistry in order to inhibit coke deposition and prevent metal sintering  [21].
The use of Pd-based catalysts has shown potential for PDH reaction in recent years. Childers et al. have investigated the catalytic performance of Pd and PdZn nanoparticles in propane dehydrogenation [21]. They reported high selectivity for propane hydrogenolysis (i.e., the undesired side reaction in PDH) and accordingly poor propylene selectivity over the monometallic Pd catalyst. Adding Zn to the structure of this catalyst, however, resulted in the formation of an intermetallic alloy. At high Zn loading or higher reduction temperature, the whole catalyst surface was covered by PdZn alloy, which was highly active for PDH reaction, while it was inactive for structure-sensitive side reactions. Such geometric modification of Pd was the reason behind the superior catalytic performance of PdZn in PDH reaction. Yang et al. reported a catalyst with Pd3Fe particles of about 2 nm that exhibited outstanding catalytic performance in PDH reaction, achieving 94% selectivity toward propylene, while the monometallic Pd showed only 45% selectivity. Since the electronic modification of the Pd environment was not significant to be considered as the main reason for the improved selectivity, the geometric modification of Pd by inactive Fe atoms was reported to be the origin of the improved selectivity [20]. Zhang et al. utilized a kinetic control diffusion route to synthesize Pd1Sn1 and Pd1Sb1 intermetallic compounds for PDH reaction. For the monometallic Pd sample, the selectivity decreased quickly from 95% to 60% with increasing propane conversion, while for bimetallic samples, the selectivity remains higher than 95% regardless of propane conversion. In good agreement with other reports, a geometric modification, which deacreased propane hydrogenolysis, was invoked as the origin of the improved catalytic performance [22].
Metals such as Ge, Co, Bi, and many others have also been studied as promoters, showing improved stability and selectivity of Pt-based catalysts in PDH reaction. However, the effect of these promoters on Pd Pd in PDH reaction has not been reported yet [23], [24], [25], [26]. Previously, we have experimentally demonstrated that the interaction between Pt and Ge resulted in outstanding catalytic performance in PDH [23, 27]. Furthermore, our experimental work was supported with earlier density functional theory (DFT) calculations, predicting a positive effect of Ge for boosting the catalytic performance of Pt in light alkane dehydrogenation [26]. Apart from these reports, interaction between Ge and other metals than Pt in PDH reaction is still lacking. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Ge promotion on Pd nanoparticles and to determine the effectiveness of Pd-Ge as a catalyst in PDH reaction (scheme 1). The as-synthesized catalysts have been thoroughly characterized to establish a correlation between the nature of active sites and their electronic and geometric properties with catalytic performance in PDH. Ultimately, the positive role of Ge promotion in suppressing coke formation and increasing selectivity and stability of Pd catalysts was elucidated.

2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalyst
A high surface area SiO2 (Silica Gel 60, KANTO CHEMICAL CO, 751 m2/g and 1.2 ml/g pore volume) was used as support. GeCl4 (Alfa Aesar, > 99.9%) and palladium nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as the source of Ge and Pd, respectively. The support was first calcined at 700 °C for 2 h before catalyst preparation. For the synthesis of the monometallic sample, denoted as Pd2/SiO2, Pd(NO3)2 was dissolved in 50 ml DI water. The required amount of NH3 was added to the solution to adjust pH to 11 to ensure uniform particle size distribution as a result of the strong electrostatic adsorption on the support. Once a clear solution was obtained, the support was added to the solution and stirred for 8 h, filtered, and washed with DI water. The sample was dried at 110 °C for 12 h and then calcined at 250 °C for 3 h. For the synthesis of bimetallic samples, prior to Pd loading, the support was first impregnated with a solution of Ge precursor to ensure 1 wt.% Ge for Pd2-Ge1/SiO2 and 2 wt.% Ge for Pd2-Ge2/SiO2. After Ge loading, samples were dried at 110 °C for 12 h and calcined at 550 °C for 3 h.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The morphology and crystalline size of the nanoparticles along with the chemical composition within the samples were investigated using a high-resolution TEM with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (HRTEM/EDX, JEM-2100F).
The specific surface area of the samples was obtained by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms employing a Micromeritic ASAP 2420 apparatus. Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method was used to determine the pore size distribution. Prior to analysis, the samples were pretreated at 200 °C for 12 h.
CO chemisorption was used to measure the metal dispersion and metallic surface areas of the samples. Prior to chemisorption, 50 mg of the sample was reduced at 300 °C for 0.5 h and then at 600 °C for another 0.5 h under flowing 40% H2/N2 (50 ml/min). After reduction, the sample was evacuated at 350 °C for 0.5 h and then cooled down to 35 °C for analysis. A pressure of 5 µm Hg was used as the set point for vacuum. For the calculations, a Pt:CO adsorption stoichiometry of 1:1 was assumed and the metal loading was determined by ICP-OES analysis.
Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) was utilized to measure actual metal content in the samples. 100 mg sample was dissolved in a concentrated solution of sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid (1:1 ratio) under microwave digestion. Next, this solution was diluted 400 times with DI water. Then, it was heated up to 200 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C/min and kept at this temperature for 20 min.
A TPDRO 1100 system (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector was used for hydrogen temperature reduction (TPR) analysis. 100 mg sample was heated up under 5% H2/95% Ar (50 ml/min) from room temperature to 950 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min, after a degassing treatment at 50 °C for 0.5 h under argon.
in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was carried out on a Frontier MIR (PerkinElmer) fitted with a mercury−cadmium−telluride (MCT) detector and a ZnSe cell. Samples were heated under 10% H2/He (50 ml/min) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min to 300 °C and kept at this temperature for 0.5 h. Then, temperature was increased to 600 °C and the samples remained at this temperature for another 0.5 h. After reduction, the system was cooled down to room temperature, before recording the background.. After background collection, the sample was saturated with 2% CO/He or 5% C3H6/He for 0.5 h. Physically adsorbed CO or C3H6 was removed by flowing He and then the spectra were collected.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a VG ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with a monochromatic Mg Kα radiation. Samples were ex-situ reduced at 300 °C for 0.5 h and then 600 °C for 0.5 h with 40% H2/60% N2 (50 ml/min). After reduction, samples were loaded in XPS holder in a glovebox under inert gas protection, and then transfered to the XPS chamber. Prior to measurements, the samples were evacuated for 2 h to remove surface species. C1s binding energy at 284.8 eV was used as standard to calibrate the binding energies.
Temperature programmed desorption of propylene (C3H6-TPD) was carried out to investigate the interaction between C3H6 and the metal surface. 50 mg of the sample was reduced at 300 °C for 0.5 h and then at 600 °C for 0.5 h under 5% H2 (50 ml/min). After reduction, the sample was cooled down to room temperature and saturated with 5% C3H6/He for 0.5 h. Then, physically adsorbed C3H6 was removed with flowing He for 0.5 h. The spectra were recorded from room temperature to 300 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Coke deposition of the spent samples was analyzed using a thermal gravimetric analysis device (TGA Q500 V6.7 Build 203). TGA measurements were carried out from room temperature to 850 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min under a flowing mixture of 40% Air/N2 (100 ml/min).
2.3. Catalytic tests
PDH reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor with a length of 600 mm and an inner diameter of 5 mm. 50 mg sample was loaded into the quartz tube and held by quartz wool. Prior to reaction, samples were reduced at 300 °C for 0.5 h and 600 °C for 0.5 h with flowing 40% H2/N2 (50 ml/min). Catalytic tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure, while the reaction temperature was varied between 500 °C and 575 °C. After reduction, samples were purged with nitrogen and then the reactants were introduced into the reactor with total flow rate of 80 ml/min. The feed consisted of a mixture containing C3H8/H2/N2/Ar with molar ratio of 1:1:5:18:24:1. Argon was used as an internal standard to estimate the outlet total flow rate. The gas products were analyzed on-line using a Gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, 2014) equipped with 2 detectors, Flame Ionization Detector (FID) for hydrocarbon detection (Column: GS-GASPRO 30 m length, 32 mm ID) and Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) for H2 and Ar detection. After the catalytic test, the catalyst was removed from the reactor for the characterization of spent samples. The following equations were used in the calculations:

3. Results and discussions
3.1. Characterizations
3.1.1. Textural and morphological properties
As shown in Fig. 1a-c, HRTEM images of the as-synthesized samples (in reduced form) demonstrate the formation of fine metal nanoparticles on both monometallic (Pd2/SiO2) and bimetallic (Pd2-Ge1/SiO2 and Pd2-Ge2/SiO2) catalysts, with particle sizes of 3.83 ± 0.8, 4.56 ± 0.9, and 4.99 ± 0.6 nm, respectively. Expectedly, as Ge is added to the samples, the particle size is increased in which the size of nanoparticles for the sample with 2% Ge are 30% biggerincreased, being 30% bigger for the sample with 2% Ge than the one for the sample without Ge. Concerning alloy formation for bimetallic samples, the captured high-magnification HRTEM images are displayed in Fig. 1d,e. These images show lattice fringes of a rather large nanoparticle in the Pd2-Ge1/SiO2 sample, exhibiting two segregated regions, including a small Ge crystallite attached to a bigger Pd nanoparticle, probably forming a relatively long alloy interface. Such alloy formation might occur for the rest of Pd surface by forming a Pd-Ge surface alloy and resulting in the dilution of Pd surface; although, the lattice fringes would not be clearly observed. However, HRTEM-EDX line scan pattern of another particle (Fig. 1f) further supports such Pd surface dilution by Ge (or alloy formation) since deposited Ge (red line) in small amount on the Pd particle (cyan line) isdetected. HRTEM/EDX elemental mappings of the Pd2-Ge1/SiO2 sample also indicates a fairly uniform distribution of Pd and Ge over the SiO2 surface without major localized aggregation of the elements (Fig. 1g).

Textural properties of the calcined SiO2 support as well as-synthesized monometallic and bimetallic samples, with different Ge loadings, are summarized in Table 1. After calcination, SiO2 surface area becomes 427 m2/g. However, after adding Pt and Ge, the surface area slightly decreases. Panpranot et al. similarly reported a decrease in the SiO2 surface area after Pd decoration [28]. They related such a decrease in the BET surface area to the blockage of the pores by Pd nanoparticles. Accordingly, the same reason could be invoked to explain the observed decrease in the BET surface area and the reduction in pore volume of SiO2.

Pd2/SiO2 1.97 0.75 359 8.3 33.3 3.0
Pd2-Ge1/SiO2 2.13 0.76 367 8.4 17.9 1.6
Pd2-Ge2/SiO2 2.03 0.78 401 8.6 10.5 0.90
CO chemisorption was used to investigate Pd dispersion and metallic surface area of the samples. The metallic surface area and the dispersion of the monometallic Pd2/SiO2 are 33.3% and 3.0 m2/gcat, respectively. The values for the Pd2-Ge1 and Pd2-Ge2 catalysts are significantly decreased upon introducing Ge into the samples. It has been widely reported that the interaction between a noble metal and a promoter, which does not adsorb CO, can decrease the dispersion and metallic surface area of the noble metal since the promoter could induce a geometric effect, diluting the surface of the noble metal [6, 29]. Indeed, such an effect was already reported in our previous works on Al2O3 supported Pt-Ge catalysts [23, 27, 30]. Therefore, the decrease in the dispersion and metallic surface area of Pd can be attributed to a geometric effect induced by Ge and the existence of an interaction between Pd and Ge. Such an interaction was indeed shown by HRTEM/EDX characterization. However, this interaction will be further elucidated in the next sections.
3.1.2. Study of the reducibility of the catalysts
The reducibility of the samples was studied by H2-TPR and the results are depicted in Fig. 2a. For the monometallic catalyst, a sharp peak at 95 °C is observed, which is attributed to the reduction of Pd species on the surface [31]. After adding Ge, the peak ascribed to Pd reduction is shifted to higher temperatures; 117 °C and 119 °C for Pd2-Ge1/SiO2 and Pd2-Ge2/SiO2, respectively. Moreover, a reduction peak at 570 °C appears on Pd2-Ge1/SiO2 catalyst, which is assigned to the reduction of GeOx species. This reduction peak is more noticeable and shifts to higher temperature (601 °C) when the Ge loading is increased to 2%. It was reported that the reduction temperature of Ge is around 650 °C [23]. Obviously, the addition of Ge marginally changes the reduction profiles. The reduction peak ascribed to the Pd appears at a slightly higher temperature, while the one related to Ge species is shifted to lower temperature. Spillover of H dissociated by Pd can facilitate the reduction of GeOx species, resulting in a lower reduction temperature of such species [32]. On the other hand, the interaction between Pd and Ge may shift the Pd reduction temperature to slightly higher temperatures.

The differences in the TPR profiles of the samples with and without Ge suggests the existence of an interaction between Pd and Ge. Certainly, such an interaction may change the chemical state of the active metal and needs to be studied in detail.
3.1.3. Effect of Ge on the structural properties and the chemical state of Pd
Fig. 2b shows the in-situ DRIFTS spectra of absorbed CO over the samples. These spectra provide key information on the surface composition and the structural properties of Pd. Two infrared bands are observed, namely bridge-bonded CO adsorbed on adjacent Pd-Pd sites, which appears between 1700 cm−1 and 2000 cm−1, and linear CO adsorbed on single Pd sites between 2000 cm−1 and 2200 cm−1 [22]. For the Pd2/SiO2 sample, both bands are clearly observed. The intensity of the bridge-bonded CO is significantly decreased upon adding Ge. This is in line with literature studies where the disappearance of these adsorbed species on the Pd surface was reported after introducing a second metal [33]. Pei et al. reported a band at 1870 cm−1 related to CO adsorbed on a 3-fold site on Pd, which was ascribed to the existence of large Pd ensembles. These bands totally disappeared after adding Cu to the surface due to the breakage of Pd-Pd bonds and  subsequent decrease in the concentration of Pd ensembles [33]. Similarly, the disappearance of the bridge-bonded CO in this study can be explained by the dilution of the Pd surface, breaking the Pd ensembles. Thus, a geometric effect can be invoked to explain the Ge effect.
Besides the geometric modification upon adding Ge, the linear-bond CO is slightly shifted to higher frequencies. This upward shift can be related to an electronic effect of Ge, withdrawing electrons from Pd. When Pd is in an electron deficient state, the electron back-donation into the 2π anti-bonding orbitals of CO is decreased. Consequently, the strength of the C–O bond increases, resulting in a higher the C–O bond frequency [30]. In order to verify the existence of an electronic effect induced by Ge, XPS analysis was also carried out.
XPS spectroscopy was used to determine the chemical and electronic states of Pd in the samples and the related results are depicted in Fig. 3. For monometallic Pd2/SiO2, the Pd 3d binding energy (BE) appears at 335.01 eV, which matches the BE of metallic Pd [34]. After adding Ge, the binding energies are slightly shifted to higher binding energies. This can be attributed to an electronic effect of Ge on Pd. Previously, it has been demonstrated, both theoretically and experimentally, that adding Ge to Pt can quench the electrons of Pt, resulting in an electron deficient Pt, and consequently shifting the binding energy to higher levels [26, 27]. The results reported in this contribution clearly indicate that Ge induces a similar electronic effect on Pd, leading to an electron deficient Pd, most likely due to alloy formation between Pd and Ge. This finding is also consistent with the slight wavenumber shift observed in the DRIFT spectra of adsorbed CO.

Fig. 3. XPS spectra of Pd 3d of the catalysts.
In summary, both CO-DRIFTS and XPS results clearly show the interaction between Pd and Ge, resulting in geometric and electronic modification on Pd. This interaction can certainly modify the adsorption of C3H6, the desired product of PDH, on Pd as well. Since the interaction of C3H6 with metal surface plays a key role in determining catalyst selectivity and stability in PDH [35], this needs to be further elucidated.
3.1.4. Study of propylene adsorption on Pd
In-situ DRIFT spectroscopy was used to study interaction between propylene and the Pd surface with and without the Ge (Fig. 4 and Fig. S1-S3). The positions of the bands along with the related vibration modes of propylene are summarized in Table 2. As shown in these figures, before purging of the samples, several peaks appear in the DRIFTS spectra of the samples. However, after flushing for 0.5 h, most of these peaks disappear except the ones located at 1380 cm−1, 1445 cm−1, 1465 cm−1 and 1637 cm−1. These bonds are related to the following vibrations: deformation of methyl group, C–H in plane deformation, stretching vibration of C–C bond in surface intermediates, and C=C stretching, respectively. Interestingly, after flushing for 0.5 h, a new peak appears at 1703 cm−1. Luo et al. reported a peak at the same position after adsorbing of C3H6 on the surface of a VOx/Al2O3 sample and ascribed it to the reaction of C3H6 with surface O2 in the structure of the support and the appearance of carbonyl intermediate derived species [36]. After adding Ge to the samples, the amount of adsorbed C3H6 on the samples decreases. Similar behavior has been reported on other alloys. Nykänen et al. theoretically predicted that a geometric modification of Pt with Sn results in a weaker adsorption of propylene due to relaxation effects while electronic modifications were negligible [37]. On the other hand, Han et al. reported that the interaction between Pt and Cu modifies electronic properties of Pt increases the electron density around Pt, resulting in a facile desorption of C3H6 and a lower amount of adsorbed propylene on the samples [29]. Since Ge induces an opposite electronic effect as compared to Cu, the lower propylene coverage in the Ge-modified samples is most likely due to a geometric modification of Pd. This lower propylene coverage will be further investigated . Accordingly, C3H6-TPD experiments were carried out to shed light on the interaction between Pd and C3H6.

C3H6 adsorption on the surface of the samples are further examined using C3H6-TPD and the results are depicted in Fig. 5. The C3H6 desorption peak for Pd2/SiO2, Pd2-Ge1/SiO2, and Pd2-Ge2/SiO2 are located at 78 °C, 91 °C, and 114 °C, respectively. It is well known that the desorption temperature of C3H6 from the metal surface indicates the strength of the propylene-Pd interaction. The higher desorption temperature, the stronger the adsorption of propylene on the metal surface. Thus, the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pd surface is in the following order: Pd2/SiO2 > Pd2-Ge1/SiO2 > Pd2-Ge2/SiO2. This is consistent with the DRIFTS results of adsorbed C3H6 which revealed a decrease in the intensity of the bands of adsorbed C3H6 on the metal surface after adding Ge. Accordingly, adding Ge to Pd facilitates propylene desorption.

Indeed, the facile desorption of propylene from metal surface seems to be a key factor in improving propylene selectivity as it hinders its involvement in side reactions. On the other hand, geometric modification decreases the Pd activity for any possible side reaction, resulting in an improved selectivity. To gain more insights into these effects, a detailed catalytic performance during PDH will be discussed in detail in the next section.
3.2. Catalytic results
3.2.1. Effect of Ge loading
The catalytic performance of the catalysts at 550 °C is depicted in Fig. 6a. The monometallic Pd2/SiO2 sample shows an initial high conversion (21.0%) and low selectivity (53.6%) as compared to the bimetallic samples. However, its conversion decreases rapidly and reaches to 6.2% after 210 min of Time-On-Steam (TOS), while selectivity becomes 79.8%. For Pd2-Ge1/SiO2 (1% Ge), the conversion slightly decreases from 15.2% (initial value) to 14.5%, while the selectivity increases to 91.9%. When Ge loading increases to 2% (Pd2-Ge2/SiO2), the initial conversion further decreases 11.7%, whereas the selectivity increases to 95.4%.

The deactivation constant (kd) was estimated to obtain an indication of the deactivation rate on both monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. Assuming first order kinetics for the main reaction and the deactivation rate, kd can be determined as follows [38, 39]:
(5)
However, the conversion seems to reach a pseudo steady state activity as previously reported for Pt-Ge catalysts [23]. Therefore, the activity decay can only be fully described using a deactivation model with residual activity (DMRA) [40]. Nevertheless, Eq. (5) can still be employed to determine the initial deactivation rate. As an example, Table 3 summarizes the kd values obtained from the catalytic data at 575 °C. A similar trend is also observed at the other reaction temperatures as well (Fig. S6-S8).
Table 3. Deactivation Constants (kd) at 575 °C.
Sample Kd (min−1) R2
Pd2/SiO2 1.7 × 10−2 0.9286
Pd2-Ge1/SiO2 2.4 × 10−3 0.9545
Pd2-Ge2/SiO2 2.0 × 10−3 0.9705
Table 3 clearly shows a steady decrease of the deactivation rate upon adding Ge. The kd values decreases by almost one order of magnitude for Ge-promoted catalysts compared to the unpromoted one.
The changes in the catalytic performance of the catalysts should be related to interaction between Pd and Ge. During PDH reaction, the main reaction pathway of propane dehydrogenation is competing with side reactions such as propane hydrogenolysis and carbon deposition [41]. Since these side reactions are structure-sensitive, unsaturated high energy sites such as terrace and step sites are required for them to take place [42]. In contrast, propane dehydrogenation pathway is structure-insensitive and geometric effects do not affect it significantly [43]. Moreover, detailed characterization has also revealed that geometric modification of Pd with Ge can facilitate propylene desorption from the surface, which also plays a positive role in increasing selectivity. Accordingly, the increase of selectivity along with the decrease of activity can be ascribed to the geometric modification of Pd by Ge.
As discussed, adding Ge to Pd decreases activity but leads to a more selective and stable catalytic performance. Accordingly, an optimal Ge loading may exist in order to obtain the best performance. To find the catalyst with the best selectivity and activity, the yield values were calculated and depicted in Fig. 6b. Indeed, the sample with 1% Ge shows the highest yield, suggesting this sample has the optimal Ge loading.
The Turnover Frequency (TOF) was calculated to determine the intrinsic activity of the catalysts. For this purpose, the reactions were carried out at lower conversion to achieve kinetic regime. Fig. 7a clearly shows an increase of the intrinsic activity upon addition of Ge, being the highest for the Pt2-Ge2/SiO2 sample. This increase of TOF can be undoubtedly ascribed to the electronic and geometric effects induced by Ge. As shown in Fig. 7b, the Ge-promoted catalysts also exhibit superior performance in terms of TOF as a function of TOS. Similar observations have also been reported for other intermetallic alloys such as PdZn, Pt3In, and Pd3Fe [6, 20, 21]. Yan et al. reported increase in turnover rate (TOR) after introducing Fe to the structure of Pd. They related the observed increase of TOR to a decrease of the strength of Pd–C and Pd–H bonds due to a weaker adsorption of propylene on the surface, resulting in faster turnover of active sites [20]. Cybulskis et al. reported variation in energy of the 5d electrons of Pt by Zn promotion during ethane dehydrogenation. This variation reduces the adsorption energies of adsorbates, resulting in an increase of TOR. Our C3H6-TPD data show that propylene desorbs faster in the Ge-modified samples, which can hasten the turnover of active sites, resulting in higher TOF [44].

3.2.2. Effect of the reaction temperature
The effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of the samples was investigated from 500 °C to 575 °C. Fig. 8a shows the results for Pd2-Ge1/SiO2, while the results for the other two samples are displayed in Fig. S4 and S5. As expected, the catalytic activity increases with reaction temperature. On the other hand, with increasing reaction temperature, selectivity decreases as the catalysts are also more active for side reactions at higher temperatures. Therefore, the catalysts are more stable at a lower temperature with TOS and lesser amount of coke is formed.

The Arrhenius plots of the catalysts in the temperature range between 500 °C to 575 °C are reported in Fig. 8b. All these apparent activation energies are in good agreement with the reported ones in the literature for light alkane dehydrogenations [45]. The apparent activation energy for the monometallic Pd2/SiO2 is 45.3 kJ/mol. Upon adding Ge, the apparent activation energy is increased to 60.6 for Pd2-Ge1/SiO2 and to 65.8 kJ/mol for Pd2-Ge2/SiO2. The increase in the activation energy after adding promoters have also been reported for other bimetallic systems such as PtIn, PtGe, and PtZn [6, 23, 44]. Cybulskis et al. determined the activation energies of PtZn between 570 °C and 600 °C and reported activation energies of 72 ± 4 kJ/mol and 99 ± 5 kJ/mol for the monometallic Pt/SiO2 catalyst and the bimetallic Pt-Zn/SiO2 one, respectively [44]. Wang et al. reported that weakening the adsorption strength of C3 hydrocarbons on the metal surface and suppressing bond breaking reactions will result in increased activation energies for C–H bond cleavage in dehydrogenation reactions [45]. Accordingly, the increased activation energy upon adding Ge is attributed to the faster desorption of propylene from Pd surface, as clearly shown by our C3H6-TPD data.
The differences in selectivity and apparent activation energy suggest a weakened adsorption energy of propylene and an increased energy barrier for the C–C bond activation on PdGe as compared to unpromoted Pd catalyst, mainly due to a geometric modification of Pd by Ge. This leads to a higher selectivity towards propylene by lowering the probability of forming of deeply dehydrogenated intermediates. Accordingly, coke formation is expected to be significantly different after adding Ge to the samples. This will be thoroughly investigated by performing carbon deposition analysis in the next section.
3.3. Study of carbon deposition on the catalysts
TGA analysis was used to study coke deposition on the samples and the results are depicted in Fig. 9a. The amount of coke deposition for Pd2/SiO2, Pd2-Ge1/SiO2 and Pd2-Ge2/SiO2 are 6.8%, 4.7%, and 3.8%, respectively. As revealed by DRIFTS and TPD results, propylene desorbs more easily from the Pd surface once Ge is added to the samples. The facile desorption of propylene from the Pd surface decreases the probability of propylene deep dehydrogenation and polymerization reaction, resulting in less amount of coke formation. This is consistent with the catalytic data reported in the previous section, showing an enhancement of propylene selectivity and stability of Ge-promoted catalysts. Moreover, this finding is also supported by other studies, where less amount of coke formation was reported after adding a promoter [27].

Fig. 9. (a) TGA and (b) DTG profiles of samples after reaction at 550 °C and 210 min TOS.
The nature and location of coke were further scrutinized using the DTG analysis (Fig. 9b). In DTG profiles, weight loss peak in the range of 400–500 °C is related to the burning of the coke located on the metal surface and its vicinity, while the peak between 500 and 600 °C is ascribed to the burning of deposited coke on the support [46]. For monometallic Pd2/SiO2 sample, a broad peak is seen in the range of 400–600 °C, suggesting existence of coke deposited on both the metal surface and the support. After adding Ge, the peak intensity is significantly decreased and it appears in the range between 500 and 600 °C. This implies two facts. First, the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst is significantly decreased after adding Ge. This fact is acribed to a geometric modification of Pd, which suppresses C–C bond activation and facilitates C3H6 desorption, resulting in less amount of coke formation on the metal surface. Second, the coke is now mainly located on the support. Wang et al. reported that promoters can shift the coke deposition from the vicinity of the active metal to the support [47]. This is known as a “drain-off” effect, which keeps metal surface clean by hindering the coke formation on the metal surface and transferring it to the support [48, 49]. In our case, indeed, Ge clearly induces a “drain-off” effect on the catalysis by shifting the coke to the support and keeping the Pd surface clean. This “drain-off” effect, along with the facile desorption of C3H6 from metal surface after adding Ge, can accelerate the turnover of active sites [20], which is in good agreement with the increase of TOF after adding Ge reported in Fig. 7.
4. Conclusion
Catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction over Pd2/SiO2 and Ge-promoted catalysts (Pd2Ge1/SiO2 and Pd2Ge2/SiO2) was investigated. It was found that adding Ge to Pd modifies both electronic and geometric properties of Pd. Ge quenches electrons of Pd (electronic effects) and at the same time breaks ensembles on the surface of Pd forming an alloy and diluting the Pd surface (geometric effects). The geometric modification decreases the activity of Pd for structure-sensitive side reactions and, at the same time, facilitates the desorption of propylene from the surface, resulting in an improved selectivity and stability on the Ge-modified samples. Besides, geometric modification of Pd by Ge weakened adsorption energy of propylene and increased energy barrier for the C–C bond activation, leading to a modification of the apparent activation energy. Moreover, Ge induces a “drain-off” effect on the samples, shifting the coke from metal surface and its vicinity to the support. This “drain-off” effect, alongside with facile desorption of propylene from metal surface, can increase turnover of active site, resulting in higher TOF after adding Ge to the samples.
