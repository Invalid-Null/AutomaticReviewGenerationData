The role of the compositions of HZSM-5 zeolites modified with nanosized anatase in propane and ethanol conversion
For the first time catalytic systems based on HZSM-5 zeolites (Si/Al=12, 25, 40) with nanosized anatase (NA) were obtained in situ by a modified hydrothermal method and a sol-gel method. Initial HZSM-5 and NA/HZSM-5 were characterized (XRPD, XAS, FT-IR, DSC, BET, XPS, SEM, TPD) and analyzed in the reactions of propane (liquefied petroleum gas) conversion (РС; temperature range 200–870 °С) with the formation of the main products propylene (C3H6, PP) and ethylene (C2H4, ETH) and liquid ethanol conversion (EC; temperature range 150–360 °C) with the formation of diethyl ether ((C2H5)2O, DEE) and ETH. In the PC reaction the maximum selectivity (SETH = 75%) and conversion (αP = 65%) were obtained on HZSM-5(40) (650 °С). With an increase in the NA content in NA/HZSM-5 SETH value increases up to 85%. In the EC reaction SDEE/ETH~98–99% was reached on HZSM-5(25) (200 °C) and HZSM-5(40) (300 °C); the αE to ETH is comparable (94%) for all HZSM-5 (300 °C). Modification of HZSM-5 with NA leads to a shift in the EC reaction temperature to lower temperature region (αE to ETH ~98% at 280 °C) with SDEE/ETH~94–100% for NA/HZSM-5(25) and NA/HZSM-5(12) obtained by a modified hydrothermal method. It was established the relationship between HZSM-5 and NA/HZSM-5 catalytic activity and their characteristics: Si/Al, NA content and Ti coordination number (NA/HZSM-5), the content of "zeolite water" with OH groups, specific surface area, meso- and micropores volume and spherical particles size (HZSM-5), surface energy of adsorption centers (HZSM-5 and NA/HZSM-5), and hence the content of acid sites, the strength of which is also determined by the temperature of the catalytic reaction. The reaction mechanisms have been presented. The obtained NA/HZSM-5 catalysts have a higher or comparable catalytic activity to commercial ones, but low cost, ease of preparation, and versatility.
1. Introduction
Due to the growing demand for propylene and ethylene, much attention is paid to technologies of their obtaining from propane, owing to the increase in its production from shale gas. Currently, the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is carried out in the presence of metal oxides (in particular, Cr2O3, MoO3, V2O5, TiO2, GeO2), platinum deposited on activated (20% chromium) Al2O3 [1], [2], titanium in the composition of the modifying element of oxide systems [3]. The catalytic dehydration of ethanol is considered as a promising research direction in the search for alternative sources of fuel and chemicals, since during this reaction two products, valuable for the industry, are formed: ethylene and diethyl ether. In the dehydration of ethanol, catalysts such as alumina [4] and heteropolyacids [5] are applied.
However, from the entire variety of currently used catalysts, it is difficult to choose the one that works flawlessly, since each, along with the general advantages of increasing the conversion degree, has its inherent disadvantages. Among them a low selectivity, instability of operation, high reaction temperatures and temperature instability, coke formation on the catalyst surface and sintering of particles at high temperatures, complexity of preparation, high cost (for example, platinum), harmful influence (for example, Cr(VI)) on the environment [1]. These problems are solved either by a transition to new materials, or by modifying the known ones. In addition, it is of particular interest to use in fundamentally different catalytic processes a universal material that can change its activity depending on the composition, modification method, temperature while maintaining the structure. Zeolites satisfy all these conditions.
Zeolites are considered to be the most promising catalytic systems for the conversion of natural gas and ethanol. The use of MFI type zeolites, to which HZSM-5 belongs, in the reactions of ethanol dehydration can allow the reactions to be carried out at lower temperatures, which makes such systems promising and competitive along with metal oxides and heteropolyacids [6]. In addition, catalysts based on aluminosilicalite HZSM-5 are used in the conversion of propane to aromatic compounds [7], as well as in the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene [8].
Aluminosilicalites with a general composition of Hx[Al3+xSi4+12−xO24]×wH2O and Si/Al from 8 to ∞ (space group Pnma or P21/n, z = 8; MFI type) are used in various catalytic processes due to its composition, textural and structural characteristics. Depending on Si/Al (silicalites: defect-free [SiO2]×wH2O, defective [(Si,□)O2-х(OH)x]×wH2O, □-vacancies), and the coordination environment of Si4+(Al3+) ions by oxygen-containing groups, active acid sites of Brønsted or Lewis are formed in HZSM-5, with which the catalytic properties of zeolites are associated [9], [10]. Additionally, the catalytic activity of HZSM-5 zeolites is influenced by such factors as the bulk and surface composition, the size ratio of zeolite crystal structure voids and channels and reacting molecules, as well as micro structural characteristics (crystallinity degree, specific surface area, total pore volume and pore size distribution).
The HZSM-5 zeolite matrix is promising as a stable inert "host" for various nanoobjects, in particular nanoscale anatase (NA), with is used as catalysts in "green" chemistry (for example, aldol condensation of furfurol with acetone) due to high oxidizing power, thermal and moisture resistance, and possibility of repeated use [11]. According to [12], [13], the formation of composites in the system of HZSM-5 (with different Si/Al) - NA leads to a change in textural characteristics (total pore volume, total surface of all particles [12], specific surface area [13]) and can enhance the demonstrated properties as a result of combining individual components into a single system.
The purpose of this work is to relate the structural and textural characteristics of HZSM-5 zeolites (SiAl = 12, 25, 40) and composites with NA with their catalytic activity in the reactions of high-temperature propane (liquefied petroleum gas) and moderate temperature (liquid ethanol) conversion.
The choice of the modifying component is caused by the experimental data available [14], [15], [16]. Catalysts (various types of oxides and zeolites) modified with TiO2 nanoparticles shift the oxidative conversion of propane to propylene to a lower temperature range, from 800 °C to 600 °C [14], [15]. The use of TiO2 as a carrier in catalytic systems makes it possible to increase the selectivity for hydrocarbons in the reactions proceeding by the redox mechanism [16].
In this study, catalytic systems based on HZSM-5 zeolites (Si/Al=12, 25, 40) with NA were obtained in situ by a modified hydrothermal method and a sol-gel method. Various characterization techniques, such as XRPD, XAS, FT-IR, DSC, BET, XPS, SEM, TPD are conducted. Furthermore, the catalytic properties of the initial HZSM-5(12, 25, 40) and nanocomposites NA/HZSM-5(12, 25, 40) are compared in reactions of ethanol and propane conversion.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of zeolites
Zeolite HZSM-5(12) (SiO2/Al2O3 = 12) was purchased from Zeolite International (USA). Zeolites ZSM-5 with SiAl = 25 and 40 in Na-form were prepared by the hydrothermal method with gel compositions 10 mol% Na2O – 12 mol% Butanol-1 (BuOH) – 1 mol% Al2O3 – 50 mol% SiO2 – 1500 mol% H2O (Na-ZSM-5(25)) [17], [18] and 11 mol% Na2O – 8 mol% TEABr – 1 mol% Al2O3 – 80 mol% SiO2 – 1200 mol% H2O (Na-ZSM-5(40)) [19]. To convert into the H-form, zeolites were treated with 0.1 M aqueous solution of NH4NO3, followed by annealing of the precipitate at ≥ 500 °C for 2 h. The silicate module (Si/Al) was calculated from the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in the reaction gel in the obtained zeolite without taking into account the possible presence of the molecule species and precursor residues.
2.2. Synthesis of nanocomposites NA/HZSM-5
NA/HZSM-5(12, 25, 40) nanocomposites were synthesized by two methods. Method 1: introduction of HZSM-5 into the reaction mixture during the process of NA synthesis using an aqueous solution of TiOSO4 × хH2O (Sigma-Aldrich) at t = 95( ± 2) °C, short-term (4 min) hydrolysis, separation of the obtained solid phase, washing, and drying. Method 2: introduction of HZSM-5 within the process of NA synthesis using an alcohol (С4H9OH) solution of Ti(С4H9O)4 (Sigma-Aldrich) at t = 25 °C, holding for 168 h, separation of the obtained solid phase, washing and drying. The abbreviated names of the studied samples are presented in Table 1.

2.3. Characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRPD) patterns were recorded on HZG-4 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54051 Å). High-accuracy synchrotron measurements were performed at X-ray structural analysis beamline of Kurchatov Synchrotron Radiation Source (λ = 0.78971 Å). X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) spectra (EXAFS and XANES) at the K-edge of Ti were measured in fluorescence mode using an Amptek X123 silicon drift detector at the "Structural Materials Science" (STM) station of the Kurchatov synchrotron radiation source (Si (111) single-crystal monochromator, energy resolution ~ 1 eV). The content of elements in the samples was monitored using a nitrogen-free energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer EDAX. The surface composition was investigated by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) using Thermo Fisher Scientific Escalab 250Xi spectrometer (Al Kα line, ultrahigh vacuum conditions with a base pressure no worse than 2 × 10−9 Torr). Infrared spectroscopy investigations were performed on an IR Fourier spectrometer (FSM 2201, Infraspec, Russia) in KBr pellets (frequency range 400–4000 cm−1); thickness of samples ~ 1 mm. The thermal effects were observed under dynamic heating conditions and were measured on a Netzsch DSC 204 Phoenix differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) in argon atmosphere (99.99%) at a flow rate of 100 mL/min in the temperature range of − 60 to 600 °C with double heating. The results were processed using the Netzsch Proteus software. Temperature determination accuracy was 0.1 °C.
Surface morphology of nanoparticles and their agglomerates was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (FEI Scios, USA). The nitrogen adsorption measurements were performed on an ASAP 2020-МР Micromeritics automatic high vacuum setup (United States) at –196 °С. Prior to nitrogen adsorption, the samples (0.1 g) were degassed at 450 °С and a residual pressure of 0.1 Pa for 8 h. Specific adsorption surface was assessed by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method; pore volume was determined by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method; average pore hydraulic radius was evaluated by the micropore analysis method (MP method). The acid sites concentration (C, μmol/g) of the initial zeolites Z and nanocomposites N-2 was studies by the temperature prоgrammed desorption (TPD) of ammonia and IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine (Py-IR). Prior to the TPD measurements, the samples were held at 550 °С in a helium stream for 1 h and then cooled to 100 °С for ammonia adsorption. TPD was conducted in the temperature range of 100–600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and the amount of desorbed ammonia was detected by using a mass spectrometer. Total acidity (N, mmol/g) of all samples (Z, N-1 and N-2) was studied by the adsorption of pyridine (Py) spectrophotometrically using a Specord spectrophotometer, UV–VIS (initial concentration of pyridine solution in octane 0.3 μmol/L, samples weighing 10 mg, solution volume 5 mL).
2.4. Catalytic reactions
The propane (P; C3H8) conversion reaction (t = 200–870 °С) was carried out using a flow-through unit with a U-shaped quartz reactor according to the procedure described in [20] (99.98 wt% high purity of P was used as a feedstock, the flow rate was 1.25 mL/s, the contact time with the catalyst was 0.6 s). The experimental results presented in the work are the average value obtained from three successive analyzes of P dehydrogenation products. The holding time between analysis of products was 40 min to achieve a steady state.
The ethanol (E; C2H5OH) conversion reaction (temperature range 135–380 °C) was performed using a flow quartz reactor with a fixed layer [21]. A gas chromatograph Chromatech Crystal 5000 was used to test the catalytic properties, separation on a column packed with Porapak Q at 135 °С, FID detector. Prior to experiment, samples were subjected to the standard thermal treatment in a helium flow at 400 °C for 1 h. E vapors in the argon flow (Ar 25 mL/min) were fed from the barboters to the quartz reactor with the catalyst powder, which was distributed in a thin layer on a wide-porous filter. To check the stability, the catalytic experiment was repeated for several days.

Depending on the Si/Al, zeolites crystallize in the orthorhombic (Z12 and Z25) or monoclinic (Z40) symmetry; sample with Z12 contains an impurity of MOR zeolite (~ 7%, indicated by a black arrow in Fig. 1).
The tetrahedra in Z structure are connected by vertices of oxygen atoms to form a framework of two 5-membered rings, one 6-membered and one 10-membered rings, forming a three-dimensional system of intersecting rectilinear (Fig. 2A) and sinusoidal (Fig. 2B) channels, which can contain atoms, groups of atoms, molecules, water, etc.

Combination of rings along < 010 > - rectilinear channels (A) and < 100 > - sinusoidal channels (B) of Z; relationship between the silicate module (Si/Al) of Z and the unit cell volume (V, Å3) (С) and the diameter of "windows" of rectilinear (▲) and sinusoidal (•) channels (D) in spherical approximation [22].
The unit cell volume of Z decreases with an increase in Si/Al (Fig. 2C). The relationship between Z unit cell volume and silicate module (Si/Al) can be described by the linear dependence (Eq. (1)):
(1)
V (Å3) = 5412·1 – 1·17(6)(Si/Al)
In the orthorhombic phases, the "effective" size of voids, defined as the largest total area in both 10-membered channels, is almost a circle with a diameter of ~ 5.3 to ~ 5.4 Å. These voids can contain such molecules as ethanol (critical diameter ~ 4.5 Å), propanol (4.56 Å), 1-butanol (4.63 Å), etc. The dimensions of Z channels decrease with an increase in Si/Al for samples with an orthorhombic symmetry (Fig. 2D). The dimensions of channel "windows" are bigger in Z of monoclinic symmetry, and in the monoclinic phase structure there are two types of sinusoidal channel "windows" sizes (Fig. 2D). The "window" profile in monoclinic phases is more elliptical with larger cavities in each of the 10-membered channels (maximum sizes ~ 5.9 and ~ 6.0 Å), which makes them more accessible for diffusion of molecules with large sizes.
An increase in Si/Al of Z is accompanied by an increase in the intensity of absorption bands in the regions ~ 450–620 cm−1 and ~ 1090–1102 cm−1 on IF-IR spectra (Fig. 3А), and a shift of ~ 1080–1105 cm−1 and ~ 1220–1250 cm−1 bands to the high-frequency region (Δv, cm−1) (Fig. 3А) (consistent with [23]). The relationship between Si/Al values and Δv, cm−1 can be described by linear dependences: Eq. (2) (~ 1100 cm−1) and Eq. (3) (~ 1230 cm−1):
(2)
Δv = 0.203(Si/Al) + 1·029
(3)
Δv = 0.035(Si/Al) + 0.435

(2), (3) make it possible to evaluate HZSM framework composition (Si/Al) from IR spectroscopy data and Eq. (1) from the structural ones.
Additionally, an increase in Si/Al of Z is followed by a decrease in the intensity of ~ 1650 cm−1 and ~ 3160 cm−1 absorption bands (Fig. 3A), which belong, respectively, to the bending vibrations of water molecules and OH groups of "zeolite water" in the voids of the framework connected by hydrogen bonds [24], and an increase in the intensity of ~ 3450 cm−1 band, which is responsible for the bending vibrations of OH groups [24], [25], [26] (Fig. 3А).
These results of FT-IR spectroscopy are confirmed by the data of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. 3B) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Table 2). With an increase in Si/Al of Z there is a decrease in the intensity of DSC peaks at 57–74 °C and 426–460 °C responsible, respectively, for physically adsorbed water on the surface of Z particles [27] and "zeolite water" with OH-groups in their voids [28] (Fig. 3B). According to XPS data, with an increase in Si/Al of Z, the content of water molecules on the surface of zeolite particles decreases, but the content of OH groups increases (Table 2).

Analysis of stretching vibrations intensity on the FT-IR spectra of Z in the regions of ~ 3650–3680 cm−1 and ~ 3720–3740 cm−1 allows us to judge Brønsted acid sites the amount of which decrease in the row Z25 > Z12 > Z40 (Fig. 3A). The content of bridging hydroxyls Si4+-OH-Al3+ (~ 3650–3680 cm−1 [24], [29]) in the large framework cavities as well as weak terminal silanol groups Si-OH (~ 3720 cm−1 and ~ 3740 cm−1, respectively, in the inner and outer frame [30]) is maximum in Z25 (Fig. 3А). Bridging hydroxyls and silanol groups are practically absent in the Z40 (Fig. 3А).
The high content of bridging hydroxyls in Z25 is probably caused by the presence in it of a higher impurity Fe3+ ions content (Si4+-OH-Fe3+) (Table 3), which together with Al3+ ions (Si4+-OH-Al3+) are responsible for the formation of OH-groups in zeolite framework [31].

According to the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of Z12, Z25 and Z40 (Fig. 3С) all the samples show a typical type-IV curve with a sharp uptake at the low relative pressure P/P0 < 0.02, indicating the mesoporous nature of the samples with a small amount of micropores, and a hysteresis loop type-Н3, if we consider adsorption in an individual pore of the simplest form. Since the point at the base of the hysteresis loop corresponds to the beginning of capillary condensation in the thinnest pores, a decrease in the amount of adsorbed nitrogen at low pressures indicates a decrease in the number of narrow pores. The discrepancy between the volume of mesopores calculated from the adsorption and desorption branches of the isotherms (Table 3) indicates the presence of open cylindrical mesopores with a small content of slit pores [33].
An increase in the Si/Al of Z is also accompanied by an increase in their specific surface area and mesopores volume (no relationship was found with micropore volume, particle size and average pore hydraulic radius), but a decrease in the surface energy of adsorption centers (Table 3).
SEM images (Fig. 4) show that the morphology of the initial Z12 and Z25 is formed by faceted prisms with a small number of spherical particles, the minimum size of which (~ 20 nm) is approximately the same for both zeolites (coincide with Table 3 data).

According to FT-IR spectroscopy data, the bands responsible for Ti-O-Ti and Ti-O natural fundamental vibrations of NA (~ 400–700 cm−1), as well as for the bending (~ 3420 cm−1) and stretching (~ 3200 cm−1) vibrations of the Ti-OH groups [35], [36], [37], are superimposed on the corresponding bands of the initial zeolites (Fig. 3A). It can be judged by the appearance of additional shoulders in the range of 400–550 cm−1 vibrations, most noticeable in the N-2 spectra (Fig. 6B).

The content of water (~ 1650 cm−1) and OH groups (~ 3420 cm−1) increase in N as compared to Z (Fig. 3A), but the content of "zeolite water" with OH-groups in the voids of the framework, connected with "zeolite water" by hydrogen bonds (~ 3200 cm−1, [24] ) decreases (Fig. 6A, B).
DSC results confirm the FT-IR data on the increase in physically adsorbed water (bands at 69–110 оС) in nanocomposites compared to the initial zeolites (the maximum content is in N25–2) (Fig. 6C, D). The content of "zeolite water" with OH groups in the framework voids (bands at 389–419 °С) is lower in all the nanocomposites compared to the corresponding zeolites except for N40-2 (Fig. 6C, D). At that the maximum content of "zeolite water" among N-1,2 is in N25-1 (Fig. 6C). NA addition to the system with zeolites leads to an increase in the removal temperature of adsorbed water together with OH groups from the particle surface. The desorption temperature decreases in the row N12 > N25 > N40 (Fig. 6C, D), regardless of the method of N-1,2 obtaining. It may indicate a decrease in the binding strength of active groups on NA nanoparticles surface with water molecules and OH groups on the zeolites surface in this series. The content of OH groups on the surface increases in N (N-2 > N-1) compared to Z (XPS, Table 2).
N12-1,2 and N40-1,2 XAS spectra at the Ti K-edge (Fig. 7) coincide with each other in the absorption edge position while N25-1,2 spectra are shifted towards higher energies. It may mean a lower formal titanium charge in NA in N12-1,2 and N40-1,2 as compared to N25-1,2. The XANES spectra of all samples (Fig. 7A, B) contain a single pre-edge peak, which is not typical of crystalline titanium dioxide and was observed for nanosized anatase. In the EXAFS Fourier transforms (Fig. 7C, D), the most intense peak at R ~ 1.5 Å corresponds to the Ti atoms oxygen environment. The results of the simplest EXAFS simulation (single Ti-O scattering path) are shown in Table 4.

The oxygen peak intensity in N25-1,2 spectra (Fig. 7C, D) is significantly lower compared to N12-1,2 and N40-1,2, but according to the simulation results, the differences in coordination numbers (CN) are within the error. Without taking into account the determination error, CN Ti = 6 in NA local structure, CN Ti = 4 in N40-1, CN < 4 in N12-1 and N25-1 (Table 4). Due to the fact that the XAS method in this experiment determines the averaged coordination environment of titanium atoms by oxygen atoms, it is quite likely that the СN Ti ~ 3 in N12-2 and N40-2 (Table 4) refers not to NA, but to titanium-containing phases, for which the diffuse reflection at 2θ ~ 5° (Fig. 5B) is responsible. CN ~ 5 in N25-2 is most likely a superposition of the local Ti environment in NA and in titanium-containing phases. The method and conditions for nanocomposites obtaining affect the local environment of titanium atoms by oxygen atoms in titanium-containing formations, including nanosized anatase in N.
The specific surface area of nanocomposites decreases in comparison with the initial Z (most pronounced for N-2) (BET method, Table 3), due to the location of nanosized anatase on the surface of zeolites in the composition of nanocomposites, leading to blocking of micropores.
The micro- and mesopore sizes of nanocomposites also decrease as compared to Z (Z > N-1 > N-2, Table 3), while the surface energy of adsorption centers increase (Z < N-1 < N-2, Table 3). The average pore hydraulic radius (rp, nm) is larger for Z compared to N (except for N40–2) and varies within nanocomposites without any regularity (Table 3).
SEM images of N-1,2 (Fig. 8) differ from Z (Fig. 4) by the absence of faceted zeolite particles in N-1 and the "blurring" of N40-1 and N-2 (to a greater extent) SEM images, which is caused by an increase in the content of water and OH groups on N surface (N-2 > N-1) compared to Z (FT-IR, XPS, DSC).

3.3. Catalytic properties
3.3.1. Propane (P) conversion (temperature range 200–870 °С)
There are two major mechanisms of propane conversion which are considered to be beneficial in terms of commercial use. The first one implies the production of propylene C3H6 (PP) (reaction A on Scheme 1), the most favorable outcome of the process, by the dehydrogenation mechanism taken place at the temperature ≥ 620 to ~1000 °С [29]. Along with the temperature increase, the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction shifts to propylene formation.

Scheme 1. Conversion of propane into propylene (A) and ethylene and methane (B); conversion of ethanol into diethyl ether (C) and ethylene (D).
The second mechanism of the decomposition reaction leads to the formation of ethylene С2Н4 (ETH) (reaction B on Scheme 1) and occurs at relatively moderate temperature (> ~ 420 to ~ 650 °C).
In the temperature ranges 250–450 °С, 450–650 °С, and ≥ 650 °С the maximum ETH selectivity (SETH,%) is observed for Z40 (Fig. 9A), and maximum PP selectivity (SPP,%) is for Z12 (Fig. 9B) among the initial zeolites. Propane conversion (αP,%) in the temperature range 250–450 °С and ≥ 650 °С is comparable for Z40 and Z25, and in the range 450–650 °С it is higher for Z40 (Fig. 9A).

Thermal cracking (reaction without a catalyst) begins after 620 °C. In case of Z12 and Z25, the αP,% of correspondingly 30% and 48% was observed up to 650 °C, which is inferior to the Z40 (αP = 65% at 650 °C) (Fig. 9A). These data are in good agreement with the obtained values of the activation energy (Ea) of the propane decomposition process (Table 5). During the thermal cracking, the Ea value decreases in the row: Z12 > Z25 > Z40 (Table 5).

The data obtained indicate different catalytic processes of propane cracking occurring on Z:
–
Z12 catalyst results in the formation of PP (Z12 > Z25 > Z40), thereby provoking the propane cracking reaction according to the dehydrogenation mechanism (reaction A, Scheme 1);
–
Z40 catalyst is responsible for the formation of ETH (Z40 > Z25 > Z12) by a destructive mechanism (reaction B, Scheme 1).
The high ETH release rate (w, μM/(g×s)) represents clear evidence of the free radical mechanism of propane cracking, close to thermal decomposition. The high w value of PP indicates a carbene catalytic cracking.
Together with Si/Al increase, the content of strong acid Brønsted sites (FT-IR, Fig. 3A) and Si(Al)-O in Z decreases (XPS, Table 2) which correlates with a decrease in strong, medium and low acid sites concentration in the row Z12 > Z25 > Z40 (Table 6). At the same row the SPP,% (~ 250 to ~ 870 °C) and propylene formation rate decrease (Fig. 10B, Table 5) while the αP,% increases (Fig. 9A). With αP,% increase (Z12 < Z25 < Z40) the specific surface area, and mesopores volume increase, but the surface energy of adsorption centers decrease (Table 3).

Fig. 10. XRPD patterns of Z (A), N-1 (B) and N-2 (C) (• - nanosized anatase; ∎ - carbon-containing formations) after propane conversion reaction (λ −1.54051 Å) and the amount of free carbon on the catalysts surface at 730 °C (D). The asterisk denotes the samples after propane conversion reaction.
In the temperature range ~ 250 to ~ 870 °C Z zeolites contain only medium (~ 250–450 °C) and strong (≥ 450 °C) acid sites (Table 6).
There are several points of view on the mechanism of alkane activation on acidic zeolites: the activation occurs either at the Brønsted acid sites or at the Lewis ones [38]. The acid site (in particular, of propane) and the carbonium ion resulting from various transformations lead to the dehydrogenation of the initial alkane (propane) or its cracking with the formation of PP or ETH, respectively [39].
It should be noted that the thermal dehydrogenation of propane by the reaction A produces PP (ΔН = - 125.7 kJ/mol) with a low conversion, as compared to the destruction process by the reaction B (ΔН = −67.5 kJ/mol), which proceeds with the formation of methane and ETH. The prevailing formation of methane during the thermal cracking of propane could be explained by the cleavage of the C-C bond requires significantly less energy (261.9 kJ/mol) than that one of the C-H bond (364.5 kJ/mol for the primary carbon atom) [40].
If the temperature does not exceed 450 оС, then, in the presence of water molecules, Lewis acid sites can transform into Brønsted sites [41]. At ≤ 450 °C the values of αP,% and SPP,% are low, but SETH,% is the highest for all the samples with the maximum (SETH =100%) for Z40 (Fig. 9) with minimum concentration of medium acid sites (Table 5).
At temperature range 450–650 °C the samples contain strong acid sites with the maximum concentration in Z12 (Table 6). The dehydroxylated samples exhibit the properties of a Lewis acid due to the transformation of Brønsted acid sites into Lewis ones. The maximum number of Lewis acid sites is formed at 600 °C. The Brønsted sites located on the inner surface of the channels are thermally stable and do not collapse even at high temperatures [42]. At the temperature range 450–600 °C the values of αP,% and SPP,% increase while SETH,% decrease (Fig. 9).
At t ≥ 650 °С the concentration of strong acid sites in Z decreases (Fig. A6), which is accompanied by a decrease in SPP,% for Z12 (Fig. 9B).
After modification with nanosized anatase, the wETH of Z40 catalyst increases from 346 μM/(g×s) to 440 μM/(g×s) (N40-1) and 540 μM/(g×s) (N40-2) (650 °C, Table 5) at SETH(max) = 85% (Fig. 9C). The αP,% and wETH, μM/(g×s) values decrease in the row: N40-2 > N40-1 > Z40 (Fig. 9A, Table 5). Modification of Z12 with nanosized anatase reduces the SPP,% and wPP,% in the row Z12 > N12-1 > N12-2 with a slight increase in αP,% for N12-2 (Fig. 9B, Table 5).
As can be seen from Fig. 9A, the αP,% goes up followed by an increase in the content of NA in the composition of N-1,2: the NA content in the N-2 is higher as compared to N-1 (EDX, XPS, Table 2) and αP,% as well is higher for N-2 than for N-1 (Fig. 9A) over the entire temperature range (~ 250 to ~ 870 °C). The minimum concentration of acid sites and minimum СN Ti correspond to the maximum value of αP,% (Table 4, Table 5, Fig. 9A), which indicates Lewis acid sites.
With an increase in the content of NA in N-2, the SETH,% becomes higher (Fig. 9C). At the same time, the SPP,% decreases for N12-1,2 at t ≥ 620 °С (Fig. 9B) together with a decrease in the concentration of strong acid sites in N12-1, 2 compared to Z12 (Table 6).
Modification of Z25 with NA does not change the reaction mechanism, the amount of PP produced does not change, while within the destruction reaction the equilibrium shifts towards the formation of ETH (Fig. 9C). The SETH,% at 650 °C is slightly higher for N25-2 compared to Z25 and N25-1 (Fig. 9C).
A significant problem in the analysis of catalytic activity together with physicochemical characteristics is the change in the composition of the samples under the reaction conditions. This is confirmed by the X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples before (Fig. 1A, Fig. 5) and after catalysis (Fig. 10).
XRPD data after propane conversion reaction at tmax ~ 870 °С confirm the presence of diffraction peaks series assigning to typical MFI structure on Z X-ray patterns (Fig. 10A). However, according to [43] Z are stable when heattreated up to 800 °C, and degrade slowly at higher temperatures.
On N-1,2* XRPD patterns peaks of nanosized anatase at 2θ ~ 25, 38, 48° (JCPDS No. 89–4203) are present (marked with black circles in Fig. 10B, C). Anatase crystallite sizes (DNA, nm according to Scherrer) is lower for N-1*(DNA = 7.0 nm, 7.5 nm, and 9.0 nm, respectively, for N12-1*, N25-1*, and N40-1*) compared to N-2*(DNA = 14.0 nm, 11.5 nm and 12.0 nm, respectively, for N12-2*, N25-2* and N40-2*). The diffuse peak at 2θ ~ 5° (Fig. 5B) is absent in the XRPD patterns of N-2*, indicating the decomposition of the X-Ray amorphous titanium-containing phase with the formation of nanosized anatase (Fig. 10C).
The diffuse peak at 2θ ~ 11°, most noticeable on the XRPD pattern of Z12* (Fig. 10) refers to amorphous hydrated silicon dioxide of the probable composition SiO2–x(OH)2x·yH2O [44]. The same peak at 2θ ~ 11° on N25-1,2* and N40-2* XRPD patterns (Fig. 10) is caused by the presence of X-ray amorphous hydrated titanium dioxide with the total composition TiO2-x(OH)2x×yH2O (y ~ 1) [45]. For N-2*, an appearance of carbon-containing formations was revealed (peak at 2θ ~ 22° marked with a black square in Fig. 10C), which is consistent with N-2 synthesis conditions.
As shown in Fig. 10, the carbon balance was 95–100% over the entire temperature range. Water removal as a result of propane conversion temperature increase (t ≥ 620 - ~ 870 °С) contributes to Z12 acidity: the maximum concentration of strong acid sites is in Z12 (Table 5). At the same time the presence of strong acid sites results in the side reaction with the formation of free carbon (C3H8 →3C + 4H2). The coke formed on the cracking catalysts surface remains there, causing an abrupt loss of the catalyst activity (the minimum αp,% value is for Z12, Fig. 9A). At that, the contribution of the destruction mechanism increases, leading to the additional methane formation in the reaction, as a supplemental non-target product which is also as a negative factor for further reaction: CH4→C + H2 (∆Н = +74,8 kJ/mol °С).
However, a tendency to some decrease in the carbon balance values with an increase in the temperature was observed, which can be explained by an experimental error, the contribution of which is larger at small amounts of reaction products. The maximum fraction of surface carbon was revealed at the maximum temperature of the propane cracking process (t ~ 870 °C). Fig. 10D demonstrates the carbon accumulation on all the catalysts. It should be noted that a decrease in temperature by 100 °C suppresses the process of the reaction CH4→C + H2 and reduces the fraction of free carbon by a factor of 10. The highest carbon deposits formation was found in N-2 (Fig. 10D) with the carbon-containing precursor Ti(С4H9O)4, that complies with the results of XRPD (Fig. 10C). The data obtained on carbonization have an antibate correlation with the catalytic activity: the least carbon accumulation on the catalyst surface contributes to the highest activity.
The catalytic systems regeneration takes place in an air stream at ~ 300 °C for 10 h. At that, the amount of carbon remained does not exceed 10 wt% and does not affect the catalytic activity of these systems.
The industrial processes (cracking of straight-run gasoline, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and Oleflex process, in which propane dehydrogenation takes place in the presence of Pt/Sn/Al2O3 [46]) are carried out at the t ~ 600 °C with PP selectivity on catalysts of 75–85% and propane conversion of 50–80%. These catalytic systems are highly unstable to carbonization, therefore, there is currently a trend towards industrialization of catalytic systems based on zeolites.
3.3.2. Ethanol (E) conversion (temperature range 150–360 °C)
A different situation is observed in the conversion of ethanol (C₂H₅OH) in the temperature range ~ 150 to ~ 360 °C (lower compared to propane conversion) on the same catalysts (Z, N-1 and N-2): there are no carbon-containing formations in samples after catalysis (Z**, N-1,2**) (Fig. 11).

Fig. 11. XRPD patterns of Z (A), N-1 (B) and N-2 (C) after ethanol conversion reaction (• - nanosized anatase) (λ −1.54051 Å). Double asterisks indicate samples after ethanol conversion.
The peaks of nanosized anatase at 2θ ~ 25, 38° (JCPDS No. 89-4203) are present on N-1,2** XRPD patterns (Fig. 11B, C) similar to N-1,2* XRPD ones. Anatase crystallite sizes (DNA) are lower for N-1** (DNA = 5.0 nm and 6.0 nm, respectively, for N25-1** and N40-1**) compared to N-2** (DNA = 5.5 nm and 6.5 nm, respectively, for N25-2** and N40-2**) and less than for the corresponding nanocomposites N-1,2* (Fig. 10).
The reaction products of E conversion are diethyl ether ((C2H5)2O, DEE, reaction C) and ETH (C2H4) (reaction D), by-product is H2O. It is considered that in the reaction D of ETH formation at ~ 300 °C ethanol interacts with the Lewis acid site [47], while in the formation of DEE by the reaction C at ~ 200 °C with the proton (H+) of the Brønsted acid site [29]. According to TPD data (Table 6, Fig. A6), at ~ 200 °C both weak and medium acid sites present in Z and N and at t ~ 300 °C only medium one.
The catalytic experiments show that at low temperature (~ 220 to ~260 °C) and conversion the reaction occurring in all cases with almost total selectivity is dehydration of E to DEE. This shows that in low-temperature conditions DEE formation is much faster than ETH formation.
At higher temperature (~ 240 to ~360 °C) and conversion, instead, the reaction observed, also with high and almost total selectivity, is the dehydration of E to ETH (Fig. 12).

More important differences are found for αE,% to DEE and ETH and SDEE/ETH,%. Wherein the SETH,% at 300 °C is significantly less for Z25 as compared to Z12 and Z40, and the SDEE,% at 200 °C for all Z is almost the same (Fig. 12B). The concentration of weak and medium acid sites decreases with an increase in Si/Al (Z12 > Z25 > Z40) (Table 6).
αE,% to DEE decreases in the row Z12 > Z25 > Z40 (240 °C) (Fig. 12A), coinciding with a decrease in the concentration of all kinds of acid sites (Table 6). At that Z12 has the maximum content of Si(Al)O groups (XPS; Table 2), physically adsorbed water and "zeolite water" with OH groups in the framework voids (FT-IR, DSC, XPS; Fig. 3, Table 2) and the maximum concentration of strong, medium and weak acid sites (Table 6).
SDEE,% (240 °C) is higher for Z25 (Fig. 12B) with maximum content of bridging hydroxyls Si-OH-Al(Fe) and terminal silanol groups Si-OH (IF-IR; Fig. 3A). The same sample has a maximum micropores volume and average pore hydraulic radius at minimum particle size (Table 3).
αE,% to ETH is comparable for all Z (Fig. 12A) with the SETH(max),% (300 °C) for Z40 with maximum values of specific surface area, mesopores volume (Table 3), size of spherical particles associates (Fig. 4), but minimum content of bridging hydroxyls Si-OH-Al (IF-IR, Fig. 3A), Si(Al)O groups (XPS; Table 2), physically adsorbed water and "zeolite water" with OH groups in the framework voids (FT-IR, DSC, XPS; Fig. 3, Table 2) and minimum concentration of medium acid sites (Table 6).
The trend of E conversion is N25–1 ≈ N12–1 ≈ Z12 > Z25 > N40–1 ≈ Z40 ≈ N12–2 ≈ N25-2>> N40-2. There was no deactivation under the reaction flow, the total conversion increases in repeated experiment, except the sample N12-2 (Fig. 12A, light blue dotted line).
The modification of Z with NA (Method 1) leads to a shift in the reaction temperature of the conversion of E to DEE and ETH to lower temperatures (220 °C and 280 °C correspondingly for DEE and ETH, most pronounced in N25-1 and slightly lower in N12-1), while maintaining the αE,%, SDEE,% and SETH,% comparable to those of zeolites (Fig. 12). Fabrication of nanocomposites by Method 2 has no significant effect on the samples obtained catalytic activity.
N12-1 and N25-1 have the maximum surface energy of adsorption centers (apart from Z25-2) (Table 3) and the total acidity from all studied samples (Table 5), which indicates the effect of NA in the composition of nanocomposites on the acidity of N12-1 and N25-1 (NA crystallite size is smaller for N-1 compared to N-2, Fig. 10, Fig. 11). It is known that on the NA surface there are Lewis acid sites [39], which enhance the nearby Bronsted sites [48], leading to an increase in the selectivity for hydrocarbons in reactions proceeding via the redox mechanism [16].
The catalytic activity of the obtained catalysts is higher or comparable to the commercial NKC-03A (α = 98% at Т = 533 K, SETH = 98%) [49] and Al-B (aluminum catalyst obtained by the solvothermal method and modified with boron) (SETH = 92% at Т = 673 K, SDEE = 57% at Т = 573 K) [50].
4. Conclusion
In summary, catalytic systems based on HZSM-5 zeolites (Si/Al=12, 25, 40) with NA were obtained in situ by a modified hydrothermal method and a sol-gel method. NA/HZSM-5 nanocomposites differ from the initial zeolites in composition (the content of bridging hydroxyls, terminal silanol groups, physically adsorbed water and "zeolite water" with OH groups), textural characteristics (specific surface area, meso- and micropores volume, surface energy of adsorption centers and average pore hydraulic radius), and, therefore, in the content of acid sites. The nanocomposites obtained demonstrate a higher catalytic activity compared to the initial zeolites: NA/HZSM-5 (sol-gel method) with the highest NA content and the lowest CN Ti - in the reaction of propane conversion; NA/HZSM-5 (hydrothermal method) with the maximum surface energy of adsorption centers and the total acidity - in the reaction of ethanol conversion.

2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
