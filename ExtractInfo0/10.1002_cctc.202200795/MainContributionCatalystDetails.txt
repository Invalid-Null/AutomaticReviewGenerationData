Based on the multiple document extracts provided, this does not seem directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The main focus appears to be on CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using SSZ-13 zeolite catalysts. While propane dehydrogenation is briefly mentioned, the key scientific contributions are about ethane conversion and do not provide details directly related to propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since the core focus is not on propane dehydrogenation, I have marked this as not relevant.
