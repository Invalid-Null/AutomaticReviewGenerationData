Graphical Abstract
Mixing it up: Mixed indium–gallium–aluminum oxides are prepared and characterized as precious metal-free propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
Abstract
A series of ternary mixed metal oxides containing Group III A elements (In, Ga, Al) is prepared by means of an alcoholic co-precipitation method. Specifically, oxide catalysts with a molar composition of In/Ga/Al=5:15:80, 10:10:80, and 15:5:80 are reported. The chemical composition, redox properties, and catalyst structures are fully characterized, with the results suggesting that the indium, gallium, and aluminum moieties are well-dispersed in the catalysts. The catalysts are evaluated for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 570 and 600 °C under 1 atm total pressure. The most effective catalyst with a composition of In/Ga/Al=5:15:80 provides 17 % conversion and approximately 86 % C3H6 selectivity with an initial activity of 4.6 mmol h−1 gcat−1 and 24.1 μmol h−1 m−2. The intrinsic activity on an active metal (i.e. indium and gallium) basis is approximately 3 times that of the In2O3–Ga2O3 family and approximately 3–9 times that of the In2O3–Al2O3 family. The catalyst deactivates with time on stream, and regeneration tests show that removal of surface coke and recovery of an In2O3 state helps to regain the initial activity, whereas reducing In2O3 domains into In0 does not allow for recovery of the performance. Raman analysis of the carbonaceous species deposited on the catalyst indicates catalysts with higher gallium content give more graphitic carbon, which correlates with higher C3H6 selectivity, whereas catalysts with more disordered coke are associated with lower selectivity. However, higher gallium content causes more coke formation, which leads to faster deactivation. This initial study of this family of mixed oxides suggests that an ideal In/Ga ratio may exist whereby catalyst properties may be optimized.
Introduction
Propylene is a key building block in the synthesis of a large number of chemicals such as poly(propylene), acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide.1 The global consumption of propylene reached 90 million tons in 2015 and its market is still growing. With the influx of new supplies of light gases in North America owing to hydraulic fracturing and because catalytic dehydrogenation has been demonstrated to be an effective method to produce unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons on a commercial scale, catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is attracting significant attention as a means to fill the supply-demand gap.
Among the means of propylene production from propane, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been widely studied because of its thermodynamically favorable pathway.2 For this route, the most studied catalysts are vanadium- and cerium-based oxides.3 In such a process, an oxidative gas (usually CO2, N2O, or O2) is co-fed to oxidize propane to propylene while reducing the oxidant gas.4 However, a key problem with this approach is combustion of the hydrocarbons. Several reviews provide a detailed discussion of ODH routes for light-olefin synthesis.5
In parallel, non-oxidative dehydrogenation has been widely investigated and is more commercially successful. This approach is an endothermic pathway with equilibrium limitations. Hence, these reactions are often performed under high-temperature (i.e., >450 °C) and low-pressure conditions (i.e., atmospheric) to obtain a relatively high yield of propylene. Currently, there are two well-known commercial processes applied in industry, namely the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus1b, 6 and the Oleflex process from UOP.7 The former is based on a Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor, whereas the latter uses a Pt-based catalyst with a moving-bed reactor. However, both of the above-mentioned processes suffer from rapid catalyst deactivation owing to coke formation and deposition on active sites, with many efforts being made to improve the stability, activity, and selectivity. Generally, a regeneration step is a necessary and crucial part of the process for maintaining good propylene yield in industrial operation. Owing to the importance of this approach to propylene synthesis, continuing efforts have focused on new catalyst development, with an eye towards lower-cost catalysts that might provide improved performance. Recent studies have included catalysts involving metal alloy7d, 8 or single-site oxide catalysts.9 Ideally, alternative catalysts that do not contain precious metals (i.e., Pt) or toxic elements (i.e., Cr) that still exhibit comparable catalytic performance are strongly desired.
Group III A oxides, namely In2O3 and Ga2O3, were recently demonstrated to be active for some hydrogenation reactions.10 Since 2000, researchers have focused on investigating the dehydrogenation activity of these oxides. Fan and co-workers4c, 11 and Gao and co-workers12 have extensively studied a variety of catalysts in this family. They proposed a heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism over a Ga2O3 catalyst with the aid of DFT calculations.11a Many of these studies focused on bulk Ga2O3 catalysts or zeolite-supported gallium domains, and most studies have been conducted in the presence of oxidative feed gases (i.e., CO2, N2O). For In2O3 catalysts, a metallic indium phase has been proposed as the active site, with evidence of an induction period at the beginning of the reaction suggested to be associated with indium reduction.11d However, in our previous work exploring the use of In2O3–Ga2O3 mixed oxides for PDH, such kinetic trends were not observed.13 Overall, the nature of the active site(s) of Group III A metal oxides is still not fully understood, and it may depend on the metal oxide composition and operating conditions. The complexity is associated with several factors, including the co-existence of different polymorphs of Ga2O3 and reports that the type of support and its interaction with Ga2O3 strongly affect the redox properties of the mixed oxide. Moreover, the easy reducibility of In2O3 and the low melting point (157 °C) of indium metal also complicates material characterization.
Al2O3 is a very common support used in catalysis because of its thermal and chemical stability. Hereby, we hypothesize that the incorporation of Al2O3 could improve the dispersion of the active phase (such as In2O3 and Ga2O3 in our previous report) and substantially enhance the catalyst stability and activity (i.e., prevent agglomeration of active phase). With our continued interest in Group III A mixed oxides, we report a detailed exploration of ternary In–Ga–Al mixed oxides as catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The array of mixed oxide catalysts is characterized by a variety of techniques to elucidate the structure, including XRD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N2-physisorption, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), elemental analysis, TEM, SEM, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and Raman spectroscopy. These catalysts show promising performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability.
Results and Discussion
Structural properties
The XRD patterns of fresh In–Ga–Al samples are shown in Figure 1. It can be seen that all the In–Ga–Al samples show broad diffraction lines at approximately 32, 35.5, and 65°. These peaks are assigned to (2 2 0), (3 1 1), and (4 4 0) planes of γ-Ga2O3 (JCPDS 20-0426).14 Moreover, such broad lines indicate low crystallinity of the synthesized Ga2O3 domains, which usually exist as a mixture of α/β/γ polymorphs.11b Our previous study suggested that bulk In2O3 in mixed In–Ga oxide catalysts typically exhibits a highly ordered, crystalline structure.13 However, for the current series of mixed In–Ga–Al oxides, there are no observed diffractions belonging to In2O3. This may be due to the low loading of indium, its amorphous state, or its existence in very small crystalline domains.

The textural properties of the ternary oxides catalysts are summarized in Table 1. The physisorption isotherms can be found in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). As can be seen, the Al2O3 synthesized using the same method (as a control experiment) has the largest surface area (>200 m2 g−1) and pore size (≈3.6 nm). However, the materials of the In–Ga–Al series all exhibit lower surface area and smaller pore size. In addition, these values decrease as the indium amount increases. This is consistent with our previous report of pure In2O3 (11 m2 g−1) and Ga2O3 (84 m2 g−1).13

Surface acidity is an important property that could determine the catalytic activity, especially for a reaction that involves C−H and C−C bond-breaking steps. Accordingly, the In–Ga–Al series of catalysts were examined by NH3-TPD and the results are listed in Table 2. The traces for the In–Ga–Al metal oxides contain two TPD peaks (see the Supporting Information, Figure S2), one below 450 °C and another at a higher temperature. These two regions refer to weak and strong acid sites, respectively. It can be seen that the total acidity decreases with increased indium loading, suggesting a stronger acidity associated with Ga2O3 than with In2O3. The current study is consistent with previous NH3-TPD studies over bulk In2O3 and Ga2O3.4a, 12c, 13

Chemical compositions were determined by means of XPS, EDX, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The comparison of key results in the form of indium/gallium ratios is shown in Table 3. It can be seen that despite the fact that the above-mentioned measurements have different penetration depths or compositional coverages (i.e., XPS is <10 nm, EDX probes ≈1–2 μm, and ICP examines the entire bulk phase composition), the final results are quite consistent with each other within the margin of error. The data suggest that during the catalyst preparation, the indium, gallium, and aluminum salts are well-mixed and the corresponding oxide did not have significant phase segregation of one type of species. Elemental mapping also confirms such conclusions (see the Supporting Information, Figure S3).

The homogeneity of the mixed oxides and their morphology were also confirmed by means of SEM and TEM (see the Supporting Information, Figure S4). All the In–Ga–Al samples contain similarly irregular particle shapes, suggesting that changing metal composition did not affect the particle morphology. TEM imaging (Figure S4 d–f) suggests that all the ternary oxides exhibit a similar morphology. Unlike the work of Shi and co-workers in the preparation of nanofibers containing In2O3–Al2O3 composites by means of a one-step electrospinning approach,15 we are unable to distinguish domains belonging to pure In2O3, Ga2O3, or Al2O3. Such observations again suggest a good dispersion and mixing of species in the mixed metal oxides.
Redox properties
The redox properties of the oxides are of importance for the catalytic function of the In–Ga–Al mixed oxide catalysts. Thus, H2-TPR was applied to characterize the redox behavior of the In–Ga–Al mixed oxides, and the results are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that for the IGA15-5-80 sample, a large peak appeared at approximately 610 °C. As the indium amount decreases, the peak intensity in this region also decreases. It should be mentioned that Ga2O3 could not be reduced with H2,16 whereas bulk In2O3 exhibited a reduction temperature at approximately 710 °C in previous work.17 It is accepted that the reduction-peak temperature shift is associated with changes in the In2O3 domain size. Peaks at temperatures below 300 °C are believed to be due to highly dispersed In2O3 domains within the mixed metal oxides.

Reactivity measurements
The In–Ga–Al catalysts were evaluated in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The main product is propylene, with side products including methane, ethane, ethylene, and hydrogen. Three types of experiments were carried out in this study. The first type aimed at directly comparing the conversion and selectivity under identical reaction conditions. The results are shown in Figure 3 a,b. It can be seen that the IGA15-5-80 and IGA10-10-80 catalysts exhibit quite steady conversions around 10–15 %, with a C3H6 selectivity of 40–60 %. In contrast, the IGA5-15-80 catalysts experienced rapid deactivation throughout the entire experiment, although initial conversion is the highest among the three catalysts. The overall activities are in the order of IGA5-15-80>IGA10-10-80>IGA15-5-80.

Our previous study indicated that mixed In2O3–Ga2O3 catalysts exhibit deactivation within the first 2 h on stream.13 The current study suggests that incorporation of aluminum helps to improve the catalyst stability.
A second series of experiments was carried out whereby a steady, comparable conversion was achieved by adjusting the catalyst amount while under fixed reaction conditions. Under these conditions, the reaction rate (activity) and corresponding selectivity can be directly compared. In Figure 4 a, the steady conversion values were controlled within 7–10 %, although the initial conversions varied. It should also be noted that the IGA15-5-80 and IGA10-10-80 catalysts exhibited deactivation only during the first hour on stream, whereas the IGA5-15-80 catalyst suffered deactivation throughout the entire reaction. It can be observed in Figure 4 b that the C3H6 selectivities all decrease gradually, with the best value being ≈88 % during the first hour over the IGA5-15-80 catalyst. Taking the catalyst loadings in these runs into account, the activity still follows the order of IGA5-15-80>IGA10-10-80>IGA15-5-80. It should be mentioned that no significant induction period was observed in the present study, which is different from the work of Zhuang and co-workers on In2O3–Al2O3,11d suggesting the possibility of different active site(s) in the two catalysts.

The reaction rates (activity) on both total mass and surface area bases (according to data in Figure 4) were calculated and are summarized in Table 4, along with other key results. In this study, we report two types of activities. The intrinsic activity is obtained by extrapolating the linear region of conversion back to time zero. The instantaneous activity is estimated by using the first data point at 10 min reaction time. The data suggest that the activity of In–Ga–Al oxides increases as the indium amount decreases, which is consistent with our study on the In–Ga binary system.13 With that, the highest activities among the series are from IGA5-15-80: 4.6 mmol h−1 gcat−1, and 24.1 μmol h−1 m−2. The corresponding highest conversion is approximately 17 %, with 86 % C3H6 selectivity. If only considering In2O3 and Ga2O3 moieties as the active phase, the active metal basis activity would be tripled, as the Al2O3 composition amounts to approximately two thirds of the total mass. It should be mentioned that the In–Ga binary system gave activities ranging from approximately 1.9–4.9 mmol h−1 gcat−1. Hereby, the current In–Ga–Al catalysts show superior activity by a factor of three in terms of an active metal (In2O3 and Ga2O3) basis.

[a] Initial conversion/selectivity data obtained at 10 min. Numbers in parenthesis are data obtained at 6 h on stream. [b] Instantaneous activities are calculated by using the first data point. Intrinsic activities (in parenthesis) are estimated by extrapolating the linear region of conversion to zero time. [c] Catalyst tested has a composition of 1 wt % Na2O, 20 wt % Cr2O3 deposited on Al2O3 (provided by The Dow Chemical Company). Catalyst amount is 0.08 g.
Table 4 also includes results from 1 wt % Na2O, 20 wt % Cr2O3/Al2O3 (a benchmark catalyst). It was found that the best In–Ga–Al catalyst (IGA5-15-80) exhibits similar initial C3H6 selectivity (85.5 vs. 88.1 %) with a slightly lower initial conversion (17.1 vs. 26.6 %). The instantaneous activity was approximately half that of Cr2O3/Al2O3 (4.6 vs. 8.9 mmol h−1 gcat−1). After 6 h of reaction, the conversion of IGA5-15-80 was higher than that of Cr2O3/Al2O3 (12.5 vs. 11.8 %), and the intrinsic activity was similar to each other (3.3 vs. 4 mmol h−1 gcat−1). However, it should be mentioned that the C3H6 selectivity was lower than that of the Cr-based catalyst (56.8 vs. 85 %). Thus, the chromium catalyst provides a high level of propylene selectivity, but suffers rapid deactivation and loss of conversion. In contrast, the In–Ga–Al catalyst seems to be more stable in terms of maintaining the conversion, but with inferior C3H6 selectivity.
Ex situ XRD measurements were carried out to reveal potential changes of crystallinity in In–Ga–Al samples after reaction. The patterns are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S5). In comparison with Figure 1, no change in terms of crystallinity was observed. This observation is in contrast with the previous study of In2O3–Ga2O3 mixed oxides, in which sharp peaks owing to formation crystalline In0 domains and agglomerated In2O3 were present after reaction. The addition of Al2O3 to the In2O3 and Ga2O3 clearly improves the performance of the catalysts.
Finally, the stability of the ternary oxide catalyst was investigated by using IGA10-10-80 as a representative catalyst. Figure 5 a displays conversion and hydrocarbon selectivities with H2-reduction treatment versus time-on-stream over three cycles at 570 °C. Figure 5 b shows the reaction results that include an air-oxidation regeneration treatment. It can be seen from the data in Figure 5 a that except for the first point, the conversion was quite stable with only a slight decrease in each cycle. Furthermore, catalyst regeneration by reduction in hydrogen did not yield much improvement. The observed stability of the IGA10-10-80 catalyst is consistent with the data in Figure 3 and 4. Meanwhile, the C3H6 selectivity was approximately 80 %, with no significant decrease over time.

In contrast, after short air regeneration (Figure 5 b), the IGA10-10-80 almost recovered all of its initial activity (conversion). However, this was followed by a drop to a stable value of approximately 8 % conversion. It should be noted that the steady level of C3H6 selectivity was also approximately 80 %. Considering that the coke species could be combusted in the presence of air, these experiments suggest that the deactivation behavior is associated with deposition of coke and the subsequent blocking of active sites. Taking into account that In0 could be oxidized into In2O3, and In2O3 moieties can also be reduced by H2 under such temperatures (570 °C), the observed higher initial conversion in Figure 5 b (even after two regeneration cycles) than that in Figure 5 a suggests that In2O3 domains are more likely to be responsible for reactivity than In0 domains. However, additional studies confirming the active site hypothesis are needed.
Coke analysis
In PDH, it is known that coke generation and deposition is the main cause of catalyst deactivation. Furthermore, the above reactivity data suggest that coke formation plays a key role in the deactivation of the current series of mixed oxide catalysts. To this end, Raman spectroscopy was applied for analysis of the coke formed over the In–Ga–Al catalysts. The raw spectra as well as curve fits are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S6). The deconvolution procedure has been described in previous work.13, 18 In short, four bands were found to be associated with carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface in the 950–1850 cm−1 region. The band at ≈1200 cm−1 is assigned to a disordered graphitic lattice, whereas the peak at ≈1500 cm−1 is due to amorphous carbon.19 Two intense peaks were found at ≈1370 and 1600 cm−1. These peaks are assigned as the D1 band due to in-plane defects and the G band from carbon species containing a highly crystalline structure, respectively.20 The R1 ratio (D1/G intensity ratio) is commonly used to evaluate the degree of organization of the deposited carbonaceous species. The values for each catalyst, as well as the coke content obtained from ICP-OES analysis is summarized in Table 5. It can be seen that as the indium/gallium ratio increases, the D1/G ratio also increases, suggesting a higher percentage of disordered carbonaceous species being produced at higher indium loadings. Meanwhile, the initial activity and selectivity decrease. Such observations suggest a possible linkage between the coke properties and the C3H6 selectivity; carbon materials with disordered features are associated with lower C3H6 selectivity. A similar trend was observed in the In2O3–Ga2O3 series,13 as well as in reports by Weckhuysen and co-workers using a Pt-Sn/Al2O3 and Pt-Ga/Al2O3 catalyst.19, 21 It should be noted that the absolute amount of coke monotonically decreases as the gallium percentage decreases (IGA5-15-80>IGA10-10-80>IGA15-5-80). This trend correlates with the deactivation behavior shown in Figure 3 and 4, consistent with the notion that increased coking is associated with a faster loss of activity. Two types of carbon balances are summarized in Table 5. The raw carbon balance is calculated based on all gas-phase compositions obtained by gas chromatography (GC). The value is an average over the entire reaction time (6 h). The calibrated carbon balance is reported by taking the coke amount (determined by ICP-OES) into consideration. It can be seen that the mass balance is well-matched.

The Raman analysis was also carried out over the Na2O-Cr2O3/Al2O3 control catalyst, and the results are summarized in Table 5. Significant differences between the two families of catalysts can be observed from the data in the table. The heavily optimized Cr system offers higher reaction rates, selectivities, and reduced coke levels, compared to the less developed In–Ga–Al catalysts. In a recent study using Ga2O3/Al2O3-doped Pt and K as the catalyst,21 the D/G ratio ranged from 0.73–1.00, with the coke amount varying from 0.23–0.55 wt %. The catalyst had a selectivity that ranged from 65.8–96.9 %. However, these values were obtained under higher reaction temperatures (620 °C) with an even harsher regeneration treatment (750 °C), making direct comparison problematic.
The overall implication here is that an optimal In/Ga ratio may exist in this catalyst family, the present work shows that an intermediate In/Ga composition is associated with a balance of good activity, selectivity, and stability.
Conclusions
This work has focused on the development of a series of ternary In–Ga–Al mixed oxides as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. XRD measurements show no significant crystallinity in the samples, as well as no change of crystal structure after the reaction, indicating good structural stability of the current ternary oxide system. Elemental mapping, together with XPS, EDX, and ICP-OES analysis show good homogeneity of the resulting catalysts. The best catalytic performance was associated with the IGA5-15-80 catalyst, giving approximately 86 % initial C3H6 selectivity at approximately 17 % conversion. The active metal basis intrinsic activity is approximately 3 times that of the In2O3–Ga2O3 mixed oxide family and approximately 3–9 times higher than the In2O3–Al2O3 family. Regeneration tests show that removal of surface coke and oxidizing reduced indium species to the In2O3 state helps to regain the initial activity, whereas reducing the In2O3 domains to In0 does not improve the performance. Raman analysis of carbonaceous species deposited on the catalyst surface indicates catalysts with more gallium give more graphitic carbon species, which is associated with a higher level of C3H6 selectivity than catalysts with more disordered coke. However, higher gallium loading also causes a larger amount of coke formation, which leads to faster deactivation.
In summary, the current study introduces a new family of ternary mixed oxides containing Group III A elements. The system shows superior performance compared to the binary mixture (In2O3–Ga2O3, or In2O3–Al2O3), in terms of stability and C3H6 selectivity. There remains an opportunity to further optimize the catalyst composition to achieve further improved catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation.
Experimental Section
Catalyst preparation
A family of ternary In2O3–Ga2O3–Al2O3 mixed oxides was synthesized through an alcoholic co-precipitation method. A detailed description was published in our previous study.13 In a typical synthesis, a given amount of indium, gallium, and aluminum salts (nitrate hydrate, 99.9 %, Sigma–Aldrich) at different molar ratios was dissolved in ethanol solvent (95 %, Alfa-Aesar) with a stirring rate of 150 rpm. Then, a pre-mixed solution containing aqueous ammonia (28 wt %, Sigma–Aldrich) and ethanol in 1:1 volume ratio was added dropwise until no further precipitation occurred (pH≈9). The resulting gel-like mixture was kept stirring (150 rpm) in the flask for 1 h at RT. Next, the mixture was transferred into a vial and centrifuged for 30 min at 6000 rpm. Afterwards, the precipitated gel was dried in an oven at 70 °C overnight. Finally, the obtained sample was transferred into a crucible and calcined in air at 600 °C for 6 h. The resulting In–Ga–Al ternary oxides are labelled as IGAx-y-z, where x, y, and z denote the molar ratio of In/Ga/Al. For example, IGA10–10–80 refers to sample with In/Ga/Al in a ratio of 10:10:80.
Catalyst characterization
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were carried out by using a Tristar II 3020 from Micromeritics. Approximately 150 mg of sample was degassed under vacuum and preheated at 120 °C for 12 h on a Schlenk line before the measurements were taken. The specific surface area, pore volume, and the average pore size were estimated by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method by using the software associated with the apparatus.
XRD measurements were carried out with an X′pert Pro X-ray diffractometer from PANalytical with nickel-filtered CuKα radiation (0.154187 nm), with generator settings of 45 kV and 40 mA. The scanning regions of 5–90° with a scanning step size of 0.008° were used.
XPS analysis was performed by using a Thermo K-Alpha spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic AlKα X-ray source. Pressures near 3×10−7 mbar were observed in the analytical chamber during surface analysis. The binding energies (B.E.) of all elements were calibrated with the C 1s peak at ≈284.8 eV with an uncertainty of ±0.2 eV.
Elemental analysis for In, Ga, Al, and C within the catalysts was performed by using ICP-OES. This service was provided by ALS Environmental.
Raman spectroscopy was carried out with a Thermo Nicolet Dispersive Raman Spectrometer equipped with a CCD detector and confocal optics. A microscope was applied to focus the excitation laser with a power of ≈15 mW on the sample. The signal was collected in backscattering mode. The acquisition time for the background and sample scans was 45 s. The number of scans for each sample was 30.
The total surface acidity was determined by NH3-TPD at ambient pressure with an Autochem II Chemisorption Analyzer from Micromeritics. Approximately 150 mg of sample was preheated to 500 °C with a ramp of 10 °C min−1 under a 25 sccm He flow and held under those conditions for 1 h, followed by cooling to 120 °C with a ramp of 50 °C min−1. Then 30 sccm, 5 vol % NH3/He was injected for 2 h to saturate the sample, followed by purging with He (25 sccm) for 1 h. The desorption of NH3 was detected with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and recorded during heating to 700 °C at a ramp of 10 °C min−1.
The reducibility of the mixed In–Ga–Al oxide catalysts was investigated by H2-TPR with the above-mentioned equipment. Approximately 150 mg sample was loaded in a quartz tube. A water bake-off pretreatment was applied before recording the TPR signal. Specifically, the sample was heated to 150 °C for 1 h in a 50 sccm Ar flow, followed by cooling to 50 °C. Then, 30 sccm of a 10 vol % H2/Ar was introduced while heating to 900 °C with a ramp of 5 °C min−1. The signal was recorded by a thermal conductivity detector .
SEM images and EDX spectra were obtained on a JEOL LEO-1530 at a landing energy of 15 kV by using the “InLens” mode detector.
TEM images were taken by using a Hitachi HF-3300 TEM-STEM at 300 kV in TEM mode at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). In preparation for TEM imaging, samples were prepared by crushing, dispersing the particles in methanol, followed by sonication and dropping the slurry on a lacey carbon film/Cu grid.
Catalyst evaluation
The propane dehydrogenation reactions were performed in a U-shape fixed-bed quartz reactor (≈80 cm long with 3.5 mm internal diameter). The catalyst with a 150–212 μm pellet size was loaded inside the u-tube on a quartz wool support. The reaction was conducted under atmospheric pressure. The reactor was heated to the desired temperature (i.e., 600 °C) in a Techne FB-08 Al2O3 fluidized bath under 20 sccm N2 flow. The feed gas was a mixture of fixed volume percentage of C3H8 balanced with N2. The corresponding hydrocarbon products as well as the H2 produced were determined online by a Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph equipped with a Restek Column (Rt-Alumina BOND/Na2SO4, 30 m×0.25 mm×4 μm) and a thermal conductivity detector, respectively. The data were collected after flowing the feed gas for 10 min. Calculated carbon balance ranges varied from 95–105 %. The conversion and atomic selectivity were calculated according to the following equations:
Where Xout refers to products, such as CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H6, and others and Y is the number of carbon atoms in the product molecules.
