The given document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation, as it does not mention propane or propylene. The document appears to discuss dehydrogenation of an unspecified compound using a Ga2O3 catalyst supported on HZSM-5 zeolite. Since propane and propylene are not explicitly mentioned, I cannot extract the requested information about propane dehydrogenation. I have indicated that the document is not relevant.
