Conversion of propane to propylene in a proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell
Abstract
The feasibility of conversion of propane to propylene in a fuel cell using yttrium-doped barium cerate as the proton-conducting electrolyte and platinum as anode and cathode catalysts was investigated. The distribution of gas products from anode outlet was analyzed by gas chromatography and, discussed under open circuit conditions and when discharging the fuel cell. Under open circuit conditions, because there were only chemically catalytic reactions and thermal reactions in the anode chamber, the gas slate was little selective to propylene. However, the propylene selectivity was obviously enhanced when discharging the fuel cell, through activating the electro-catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. The propylene yield obtained from the electro-catalytic reaction reached 70–80%. In addition, relatively good fuel cell performances were achieved. The influences of the operating temperature and propane flow rate on the fuel cell performances were also discussed.
1. Introduction
Propylene is a major industrial chemical used as a feedstock in the production of polypropylene, acrolein, propylene oxide, glycerine, isopropanol, refinery feed stock to improve the octane rating of gasoline [1] and other chemicals. Propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene is an important industrial process because propylene is economically more essential than propane. Currently there are four different commercial technologies that can be licensed for propane dehydrogenation [2], [3], [4]. These routes differ primarily in the types of catalyst, the reactor designs, and the methods used to increase the conversion, but they are involved in same reaction:

Because reaction (1) is equilibrium limited and higher temperatures are usually needed [5]. Unfortunately, at these temperatures hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation are also favored.
A novel method for producing propylene is electro-catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in proton-conducting fuel cells. Studies have shown that dehydrogenation of propane to propylene occurs through a dissociative chemisorption process on catalyst surface [5], [6]. So in principle, use of fuel cells overcomes equilibrium limitations as hydrogen atoms from dehydrogenation chemisorb at the catalyst surface, and are then rapidly conducted through the proton-conducting electrolytes in proton form to the cathode side, where they recombine with oxygen and electrons to produce water. The electrodes reactions can be described as following.

The proposed transport mechanism ensures the continuous production of propylene from propane, and the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the electrochemical system is not equilibrium limited. More importantly, it can obtain both propylene and power in this process, without green house gas CO2 or other pollutant gases emission.
Although some researcher have mentioned the idea of dehydrogenation of paraffin to olefin in fuel cell [7], [8], [9], there was very little work dedicated to put it into application, especially for dehydrogenation of propane. The Fuel Cells Group at the University of Alberta is developing fuel cells for highly selective dehydrogenation of propane. Early modes that used H3PO4-doped PBI polymer as proton conductor in C3H8–O2 fuel cells operating at 200–250 °C showed that formation of very stable intermediate species on the surface of noble metal catalysts blocks propylene production, and very small and unsustainable current flow was obtained [6]. The results also indicated that high temperature fuel cells are more suitable for generating larger current flow and producing propylene. So it was necessary to investigate propane dehydrogenation in a proton-conducting fuel cell that can be operated at relatively high temperatures (550–650 °C).
In this study, the feasibility of converting propane to propylene in the solid oxide fuel cell was investigated, using 15% Y-doped BaCeO3 as the proton-conducting electrolyte and platinum as electrodes.
2. Experimental
2.1. Fuel cell system fabrication
A schematic diagram of the experimental C3H8–O2 fuel cell system with planar cell geometry is shown in Fig. 1. The cell comprises a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) having anode and cathode compartments sealed to the respective faces of the MEA. The anode and cathode compartments were constructed using two co-axial alumina tubes. The inner tube extended from outside the heated reaction zone to a position close to the respective electrode of the cell. The outer perimeter of each outer tube was sealed to the membrane with a thin layer of ceramic adhesive (Aremco 503). Platinum gauze (52 mesh) was applied as the current collector for both electrodes.

The assembled cell was placed in a tubular furnace (Thermolyne F79300) having a uniform temperature zone: ±0.6 °C over the central 7.62 cm length of the cell and ±3.0 °C to distances up to 7.62 cm each side of the MEA. The seals were cured as the cell was heated to the prescribed temperature for testing, prior to operation of the cell under reaction conditions. Pure C3H8 (Praxair, grade 2.0) was introduced into the anode compartment as the fuel via the inner tube. Spent gas exited the anode compartment via the gas outlet in the outer tube. The cathode compartment was supplied with pure O2 (Praxair, grade 2.6).
2.2. Electrolyte
BaCeO3-based perovskite oxides are the kind of protonic conductor studied intensively since high temperature strontium cerate based ceramics with high proton conductivity was reported by Iwahara et al. in 1985 [10]. This kind of material contains no significant concentrations of protons within the host component, but they can incorporate protons via equilibrium reactions involving defects in the oxide lattice with hydrogen or humidity from the atmosphere.

and h are oxygen vacancy, oxide ion at normal lattice site, proton and hole, respectively [11]. Doping by aliovalent cations is necessary for proton conductivity, giving rise to electron holes and oxygen ion vacancies that play an important role in the formation of protons. Among this series of oxides, Y-doped barium cerate ceramics shows almost the highest proton conductivity, especially for 15% Y-doped BaCeO3 (BCY15) [12], [13], [14]. So we initiated our research using BCY15 as proton-conducting electrolyte for the fuel cell.
The BCY15 electrolyte was prepared by mixing and thermally treating prescribed amounts of BaCO3 (99.9%, Aldrich), CeO2 (99.9%, Aldrich), and Y2O3 (99.99%, Koch) using a procedure adapted from literature methods [15]. The materials were intimately mixed and then calcined in air at 1550 °C for 15 h. The product was then ground in ethanol using a planetary ball mill (Fritsch P-5) with a zirconia mill container and zirconia balls at 160 rpm for 24 h. The composition and crystallinity of the product were determined using a Rigaku Rotaflex X-ray diffractometer. The powder was pressed into a pellet, 1 mm thick and 20 mm in diameter, followed by sintering at 1600 °C for 15 h. Pellets were polished using an abrasive paper. The surface morphology and microstructure of the resulting BCY15 electrolyte disks were determined using a Hitachi S-2700 scanning electron microscope (SEM).
2.3. Electrodes
Platinum was used for both cathode and anode catalysts because platinum is active and stable in oxidative and reductive atmosphere, as well as it is also active catalyst for propane dehydrogenation at the anode side [2], [3], [4]. The electrodes were prepared by screen-printing platinum paste (Heraeus CL11-5100) onto the corresponding surfaces of the BCY15 electrolyte disk. The platinum paste was dried in air at 120 °C for 30 min and then fired at 1000 °C for 60 min to remove the organic binder and to increase adhesion to the electrolyte. The superficial surface area of each electrode was approximately 0.7 cm2.
2.4. Electrical measurements and gas analysis
The open circuit voltage, overpotential and impedance spectrum between the two electrodes were recorded with a Gamry electrochemical measurement system (PC4-750). The relation between spectra and conductivity of electrolyte is described in Ref. [16].
The anode outlet gas was analyzed with a gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard Model 5890 II), using a molecular sieve column at 80 °C and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) connected to an HP3396 series II integrator.
Based on the inlet and outlet gas concentration, the conversion, selectivity and yield were defined as

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Analysis of anode outlet gas
3.1.1. Open circuit conditions
Ideally, the anode outlet products are only propylene and unreacted propane. However, in addition to the propane dehydrogenation some other side reactions can also occur in the anode chamber, especially under the open circuit conditions. Under this situation, there was no current drawn from the fuel cell, so the gas products were only caused by the chemically catalytic reactions and some thermal reactions rather than electro-catalytic dehydrogenation. Studies [5] have shown that reactions of propane primarily involved two pathways on some dehydrogenation catalysts: dehydrogenation and cracking.

The two parallel reactions are not independent but in competition with each other from absorbed intermediate on the catalyst surface [17]. Thermodynamic analysis also indicated that the products of the two reactions interacted and secondary reactions occurred among them. For example, ethane could also exist as the product of hydrogenation of ethane:
(12)
In addition, at high temperatures the hydrocarbons easily form carbon in an irreversible process, especially for alkenes [18]:
(13)
So under open circuit conditions, all these factors make the reactions and the products slate very complex. C3H6, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and H2 were detected by gas chromatograph at the anode outlet. Compared to C3H6, CH4 and C2H4, the concentrations of C2H6 and H2 were much less, especially for H2. The reason for the low concentrations of C2H6 and H2 was that C2H6 was the product of a secondary reaction and H2 was mostly consumed in secondary reactions. Therefore, C3H6,CH4 and C2H4 were the predominant gas products. The gas distributions at different operating temperatures and different propane flow rates were shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3. It was obvious that under open circuit conditions, the gas products were less selective to propylene.

3.1.2. Discharging fuel cells
Although some thermal reactions still could not be avoided even when drawing current from the fuel cell, because the two hollow co-axial fuel cell tubes provided space to enable thermal reactions to occur. However, discharging fuel cells could obviously improve the gas distribution through activating the electro-catalytic reaction.
Fig. 4 shows propane conversion and selectivities of C3H6 and the combination of CH4 and C2H4 at different discharging current density. Compared to the open circuit condition (zero discharging current density), the selectivity of propylene increased by 6% at discharging current density of 40 mA/cm2 with propane flow rate of 10 mL/min and operating temperature of 600 °C. Discharging the fuel cell improved propane dehydrogenation by conducting hydrogen atoms through the proton-conducting electrolytes. On the other hand, the reactions of propane intramolecular C–C bond breaking were inhibited during fuel cell discharging, and the total selectivity of CH4 and C2H4 apparently decreased. The propane conversion slightly increased with discharging the fuel cell, but low discharging current density (e.g. 10 mA/cm2 in Fig. 4) propane conversion was even below the level at the open circuit conditions. The phenomena may be due to the suppression of the reactions of propane intramolecular C–C bond breaking and other side reactions during discharging the fuel cell. With the further increase of discharging current density, propane dehydrogenation became more important and the total conversion came to increase.

To analyze of the impact of reaction parameters on the process of electro-catalytic dehydrogenation to propylene, side reactions that occurred to a significant degree only at the open circuit conditions were excluded, and only the electro-catalytic reaction was correlated with discharging current density. Fig. 5 shows the propylene yield by electro-catalytic dehydrogenation during discharging the fuel cell. Propylene yield obtained from experiments was a little less than the theoretical values, which were calculated based on Farady’s law for the anode side reaction (2).

So it indicated that during the process of discharging fuel cell, some other side reactions in addition to propane dehydrogenation also occurred on the anode catalysts and, a portion of hydrogen ion transported through the protonic electrolyte was contributed by these side reactions.
3.2. Fuel cell properties
3.2.1. BCY15 electrolyte
The identity and high crystallinity of the synthesized BCY15 after sintering at 1600 °C was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 6). Disks formed by pressing BCY15 comprised a dense mass of cubic crystals (Fig. 7).

3.2.2. Fuel cell performances
Fig. 9 shows the current density as a function of cell voltage and power density for the C3H8–O2 fuel cell at a propane flow rate of 10 mL/min at 600 and 650 °C. The current density increases quasilinearly with decrease in potential generated, and even in the high current density region there is no apparent slope deviation, showing that mass transfer is not a limitation for the system [19]. At the same propane flow rate, the fuel cell performance strongly depended on operating temperature. The maximum power density doubled, from about 17 mW/cm2 at 600 °C to 35 mW/cm2 at 650 °C. The maximum current density also increased, from 85 to 176 mA/cm2. The position of the peak increased from 44 to 73 mA/cm2. The cause of this behavior is that higher temperature not only facilitated the propane dehydrogenation but also increased the proton conductivity of the electrolyte.

Propane flow rate also influenced the performances of C3H8–O2 fuel cell. At 600 °C increasing propane flow rate from 10 mL/min to 30 mL/min, the maximum current density and power density also slightly increased (Fig. 10). Because the increase of propane flow rate meant higher propane concentration in the anode compartment, the reaction rate of propane dehydrogenation also accelerated.

3.3. Conclusions
