The provided document does not seem to be related to propane dehydrogenation to propylene. It discusses desulfurization of thiophene using propane as a hydrogen source, but does not mention conversion of propane to propylene specifically. Since it does not pertain to PDH or ODH processes, I have indicated "No" for relevance and did not include the <IfRelated> section.
