1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of short-chain hydrocarbons such as light alkanes is an effective way to increase the value of light alkane streams from fossil-based sources. Dehydrogenation is of renewed interest due to the large availability of new feedstocks derived from hydraulic fracturing (‘fracking’) operations [1]. Among this family of reactions, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is of particular interest, since propylene is a crucial feedstock for polymer production [2]. Total propylene consumption was 83 million tons in 2013 and the global demand is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.8% during 2013–2018 [3].
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is an alternate way to produce propylene. In this scenario, an oxidative gas (O2 or CO2) is co-fed with propane. This process has several advantages, such as being exothermic and offering no thermodynamic limitations. However, this approach is faced with problematic over-oxidation (combustion), which can decrease propylene productivity. The most extensively studied catalysts involve Mo/V/Ce based oxides [4], [5], [6], [7]. An array of alternate catalysts also continue to be explored, such as metallic alloy (i.e., Cu–Al) catalysts [8] and intermetallic (i.e., Cu–Sn, Cu–Fe–Al) fibers [9]. Several reviews focus on discussing ODH approaches in detail [10], [11], [12].
Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited process that requires relatively high temperature and low pressure conditions to obtain a high yield of propylene. The main issues associated with PDH under such conditions are undesired thermal cracking of the feedstock and products (producing short-chain hydrocarbons) as well as coke formation, which blocks active sites and causes rapid catalyst deactivation [13]. Currently, commercial industrial PDH processes are based on Cr [14], [15] (CATOFIN® from CB&I Lummus) and Ptcatalysts [16], [17], [18] (Oleflex from UOP) catalysts. However, these catalytic systems are impacted by rapid deactivation due to coke formation and competitive CC bond cracking, which causes loss of propylene yield. Hence, a periodic catalyst regeneration step is important in the above-mentioned industrial operations [19]. Many efforts have been made in improving the catalytic performance, including the addition of a second metal such as Sn, In, or Ga into Pt-based catalysts [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], or the modification of Cr-catalysts with alkali additives [31], [32], [33], [34]. Meanwhile, other parallel investigations were devoted to systems involving MoOx [35], VOx [36], [37], and Zn2+ [38]. However, improved PDH catalysts are continuously sought.
Recently, PDH catalysts involving group IIIA metal oxides have attracted attention. It has been reported that supported Ga2O3 and bulk Ga2O3 show promising catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation [39], [40], [41]. However, the nature of the active site in Ga2O3 is still unclear, in part because of its structural complexity and the co-existence of several polymorphs of Ga2O3 in mixed oxide materials. Also, the reducibility of Ga2O3 strongly depends on its interaction with the support material as well as the potential presence of metals such as Pt [42] and Pd [43]. A proposed reaction mechanism involves heterolytic dissociation, in which H− adsorbs on a Ga+ site (gallium hydride) and a C3H7+ carbocation bonds with a neighboring O atom to form a gallium alkoxide [44]. Supported In2O3 as a catalyst in presence of weak oxidative gases (i.e., CO2, N2O) was also investigated, and was found to be of interest as a potential new PDH catalyst [45], [46], [47], [48]. The authors proposed that reduced metallic indium at the catalyst surface was the active site due to observation of an induction period.
However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports investigating binary In2O3–Ga2O3 mixed oxide catalysts for PDH. Since each single oxide component exhibited some activity, we hypothesized that the mixed In–Ga oxide catalysts could show interesting PDH properties different from the two individual oxide catalysts. To this end, in this work we have prepared a series of mixed In–Ga oxides and evaluated them in detail for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. The structural properties of these mixed-oxide catalysts were also elucidated via characterization by a range of techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), N2-physisorption, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) with H2, and elemental analysis by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The deposited carbonaceous species were examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Raman spectroscopy. The resulting mixed-metal oxides exhibit a considerably higher activity in terms of propane conversion than previously reported mixed In2O3–Al2O3, as well as compared to γ-Ga2O3, on both a catalyst mass basis and surface area basis. The origin of this behavior is discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A series of binary In2O3–Ga2O3 mixed oxides was synthesized by an alcoholic co-precipitation method [49]. In a typical synthesis, specific amounts of the indium and gallium precursors (nitrate hydrate, Sigma–Aldrich, 99.9%) at different molar ratios were dissolved in ethanol (Alfa-Aesar, 95%). Then, a mixture containing concentrated aqueous ammonia (Sigma–Aldrich, 28 wt%) and ethanol (1:1 in volume) was added dropwise to the precursor solution until no further precipitation occurred (pH ≈ 8.5). After aging for 1 h while stirring at 250 rpm at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 6000 rpm. Then the recovered, precipitated gel was dried at 70 °C overnight. Finally, the obtained sample was calcined in air at 600 °C for 6 h. The resulting In–Ga binary oxides are labeled as IGx-y, where x and y denote the molar ratio of In2O3/Ga2O3 in the catalyst (e.g., IG10-90 denotes a material with In and Ga in a 10:90 ratio).
2.2. Catalyst characterization
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured with a Tristar II 3020 apparatus from Micromeritics. The samples were degassed and preheated at 110 °C under vacuum on a Schlenk line for 12 h before the measurements. The specific surface area (by the BET method), pore volume (by T-plot method), and the average pore size (by the BJH method) were obtained with the software of the apparatus.
Elemental analysis for indium and gallium within the catalysts was performed using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) by ALS Global.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a PANalytical X’pert Pro X-ray diffractometer operating with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (0.154187 nm), with generator settings of 45 kV, 40 mA, a scanning step size of 0.008°, and scanning regions of 6–80° 2θ.
The reducibility of catalysts was assessed with H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) in a flow-type fixed bed reactor using an Autochem II Chemisorption Analyzer from Micromeritics. A mixture of 10 vol% H2/Ar was used as the reducing gas with a total flow rate of 30 sccm. About 100 mg sample was heated from room temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min after being pretreated at 150 °C for 1 h in Ar gas flow (50 sccm). The reducing gas was cooled by a cold trap filled with a mixture of acetone and liquid nitrogen to remove the water generated from reduction of catalyst. The reduction signal was recorded by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
The surface acidity was assessed by temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) at ambient pressure with the above-mentioned equipment. About 100 mg sample was preheated to 500 °C with a ramp of 10 °C/min and maintained for 1 h, followed by cooling to 120 °C under He flow (25 sccm). Then sufficient NH3 (5 vol% in He, 30 sccm, 2 h) was injected until a saturated sample was obtained, followed by purging with He (25 sccm) for 1 h. After obtaining a stable baseline, the sample was heated to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. The desorbed NH3 was detected by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
Raman spectroscopy was performed using a Thermo Nicolet Almega XR Dispersive Raman Spectrometer, equipped with confocal optics before the spectrometer entrance, and a CCD detector. A microscope was used to focus the excitation laser beam (488 nm) with a laser power of ∼15 mW on the sample and to collect the Raman signal in the backscattered direction. The acquisition time was 30 s and 30 spectra were recorded for each sample. Moreover, each sample was analyzed by collecting data at 3–5 points to eliminate the effects of the heterogeneity of the sample.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out by using Netzsch STA 409 TGA-DSC. About 30 mg sample was loaded in a pan. Then it was heated from 20 °C to 900 °C in air with flow rate of 90 mL/min.
XPS analysis was carried out using Thermo K-Alpha spectrometer employing a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. Pressures near 5 × 10−8 Torr were observed in the analytical chamber during surface analysis. The binding energies (BE) of all elements were referenced to the C 1s peak of contaminant carbon at 284.6 eV with an uncertainty of ±0.2 eV.
XAS measurements were carried out at the beamline of the materials research collaborative access team (MRCAT, 10BM-A,B) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. Samples were measured in transmission mode using ion chambers with 2% N2 in Ar. Data were collected with a cryogenically cooled double-crystal Si (1 1 1) monochromator. The X-ray beam size was ca. 1.5 × 1.5 mm2. An indium foil spectrum was measured simultaneously to calibrate the energy. The XANES pre-edge energy analysis of indium was performed using WinXAS 3.2 software package according to standard data analysis procedures.
2.3. Catalyst evaluation
The PDH reaction was performed in a U-shape fixed bed quartz reactor (ca. 3.5 mm i.d., 80 cm long) with a measured amount of catalyst (pellet size 150–212 μm) under atmospheric pressure at 600 °C. The sieved powder was held in the reactor by quartz wool. The reactor was then heated to 600 °C in an Al2O3 fluidized bath (Techne FB-08) under 20 sccm N2 flow. The reactant flow contained C3H8 with balancing N2. The hydrocarbon products as well as H2 were analyzed on line by a gas chromatograph (SHIMADZU GC-2014) equipped with a RESTEK Column (Rt-Alumina BOND/Na2SO4, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 4 μm) and a TCD, respectively (see supporting material, Fig. S1). The data were collected after flowing the reactant mixture for 10 min. The mass balance based on carbon had a maximum deviation of 10%. The conversion and molar selectivity were calculated by using the following equations:
After reaction, the catalyst was purged with N2, cooled down to room temperature under its protection and removed from the reactor for ex situ measurements.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characterization
Fig. 1 depicts the diffractograms for three In2O3–Ga2O3 mixed oxides as well as synthesized bulk In2O3 and Ga2O3 samples for comparison. The bulk In2O3 exhibits a well-crystallized structure. The 2θ angles at 21.7°, 30.6°, 35.6°, 37.7°, 41.9°, 45.7°, 51.2° and 60.8° are characteristic of the cubic bixbyite phase of In2O3 (JCPDS 6-0416) [50]. In contrast, the broad diffraction lines of the as-synthesized Ga2O3 indicate a mostly amorphous structure. The peaks at 31.9°, 35.4° and 64.6° are assigned as (2 2 0), (3 1 1) and (4 4 0) planes of γ-Ga2O3 (JCPDS 20-0426) [51]. Such low crystallinity is common in the γ-polymorphs of gallia, although other phases (i.e., α-, β-) may also coexist [52]. For the series of IG mixed oxides, no obvious diffraction lines are observed, suggesting the low concentration of indium precludes the formation of large crystalline domains. The patterns suggest the indium oxide may be well-dispersed during the co-precipitation and calcination process.

Table 1 summarizes the textural properties (BET surface area, pore volume and average pore size) of the IG catalysts. The physisorption isotherms are shown in the supporting information (Fig. S2). The bulk In2O3 has the largest pore size but lowest surface area, while the bulk Ga2O3 exhibits the opposite behavior, a large surface area with a small pore size less than 4 nm. As the indium-gallium ratio is adjusted within the mixed oxide samples, the properties follow the above trend within the limits of instrumental error.

Among the surface properties of the catalysts that affect catalytic performance, acidity plays a key role in many reactions [53]. Hence, the surface acidity of the In–Ga catalysts was examined by NH3-TPD (see supporting material, Fig. S3). The results are summarized in Table 2. All the mixed metal oxides exhibit two TPD peaks: one broad peak at 120–450 °C, and a smaller peak between 450 and 600 °C. These two peaks correspond to acid sites with weak and medium strength, respectively. It is difficult to explicitly correlate the acid properties of binary oxide systems, since the resulting acidity can be influenced by many factors such as the type of metals, the synthetic method, and the relative population of metals [54]. However, it is widely accepted that the combination of two metal oxides can usually generate more acidic sites than that of a single component oxide [55], [56], [57]. It can be seen from Table 2 that the In–Ga samples contain more acid sites (normalized by the mass of catalyst) than pure In2O3 and Ga2O3. Pure In2O3 exhibits the most acid sites based on surface area, and the value monotonically decreases when increasing the Ga2O3 percentage.

3.2. Redox properties characterization
The redox properties of the IG mixed oxides were characterized by H2-TPR. Fig. 2 shows the H2-TPR profiles of the bulk In2O3, Ga2O3, and various In2O3–Ga2O3 mixed oxides. A broad peak centered at ∼710 °C is assigned to the reduction of bulk In2O3 to In0 [58], [59]. The calculated H2 uptake is ∼8.9 mmol/gcat, indicating ∼80% of the In2O3 species were reduced to indium metal under these conditions. Similarly, the reduction extents for In–Ga binary oxides samples containing indium are calculated and listed in Table 1. In contrast, no peaks are observed for reduction of bulk Ga2O3, suggesting Ga2O3 could not be reduced in H2 in the current temperature region [60]. For the case of In–Ga mixed oxides, the reduction peak appears at a lower temperature (ca. 500–600 °C) with much weaker intensity, although no peak was observed for the IG2-98 sample, possibly due to the extremely small amount of indium in the sample. The shift of the reduction peak is generally accepted for reduction of supported In2O3 with different particle sizes. Smaller particles lead to lower reduction temperatures. Taking into account that highly dispersed In2O3 could be reduced in the range of 200–500 °C [58], [59], the observed shift suggests the formation of moderately dispersed In2O3 in the mixed oxide. The appearance of a single reduction peak suggests that only one type of In2O3 phase may exist in the IG samples, an observation that is different from the previous study on In–Al mixed oxides [46].

3.3. Propane dehydrogenation reactions
Propane dehydrogenation over the In–Ga mixed oxides was carried out at 600 °C under 1 atmosphere total pressure. The main products were propylene and hydrogen. Other side products formed include short chain hydrocarbons, such as methane, ethane, and ethylene. Trace amounts of higher hydrocarbons (i.e., butane, pentane) were also observed. Prior to the reaction, blank tests were carried out under the same conditions (i.e., temperature, gas mixture composition, residence time, etc.) to investigate the extent of thermal cracking. The results indicate that less than 4.5% conversion can be associated with thermal reactions (see supporting material, Table S1).
Two ranges of reactivity were investigated in this study. First, the reactions were run such that the initial propane conversion was less than 10% to assess the intrinsic reactivity of the catalysts. The gas mixture composition was fixed at 5 vol% C3H8 balanced with N2, with a total flow rate of 20 sccm, while the catalyst amount was varied. The residence time was ca. 4 s. As can be seen in Fig. 3a, a deactivation was observed for the three catalysts during the initial 90 min, after which the conversion became stable. The IG2-98 catalyst showed a constant C3H6 selectivity ranging from 30 to 40%, while for the IG5-95 and IG10-90 catalysts, the selectivity decreased to ca. 20% after 150 min. However, the initial selectivity during the first 30 min of reaction was higher for these catalysts than for the IG2-98 material (Fig. 3b). Fitting the reactivity data from the steady-state region and extrapolating back to time zero, an extrapolated initial conversion (‘intrinsic activity’) was estimated for each catalyst. Our data suggest the In–Ga mixed oxides exhibit higher intrinsic activity as the indium percentage decreases (on both catalyst mass basis and surface area basis). Given the observed trend, it is worthwhile to examine whether bulk Ga2O3 would be the most active catalyst. Hence, a control experiment was carried out under the same conditions with γ-Ga2O3 (see supporting material, Fig. S4). Interestingly, the calculated initial activity for this material was similar to IG5-95. The initial reaction rates on both catalyst mass basis and surface area basis are summarized in Table 3. The highest values for IG2-98 are 25.5 μmol/h/m2 and 2.1 μmol/h/gcat, respectively. To have an accurate comparison with the literature, the instantaneous activities associated with the first data point were also calculated and are reported in Table 3. For an alternate comparison, the mass based activity of the reference catalyst IA10-90 was calculated by considering only In2O3 species as active. While for the current IG series, both In2O3 and Ga2O3 are considered to provide activity. The results suggest the catalysts of the IG series exhibit higher activity than the Al2O3-supported In2O3 catalysts reported previously by a factor of 12–28 (surface area basis) and 1–3 (active metal basis) at the same reaction temperature [46], noting that the current WHSV is 4 times that used in the previous literature report (0.54 h−1 vs. 0.135 h−1). In addition, the superior activities of IG5-95 and IG2-98 compared with γ-Ga2O3 suggest a synergistic effect due to incorporation of indium into a dominant Ga2O3 phase.

A second series of experiments was aimed at reaching a higher conversion regime that is more relevant to industrial operation. For these runs, the reaction conditions were fixed for all three catalysts, giving the results shown in Fig. 4. The residence time was ca. 8 s. As before, a deactivation period was observed in the initial 90 min of reaction, as shown in Fig. 4a. Subsequently, a steady activity was obtained over the In–Ga mixed oxides in the order of IG2-98 > IG5-95 > IG10-90. The calculated intrinsic activities were 0.9, 0.7, and 0.5 μmol/h/gcat, respectively. Regarding the C3H6 selectivity data shown in Fig. 4b, IG2-98 provided a value of ∼25% over the course of the reaction. For the case of IG5-95 and IG10-90, although the initial selectivity value was higher (ca. 28%) it dropped to a lower steady-state selectivity (ca. 13% and 10%, respectively) with the following order: IG2-98 > IG5-95 > IG10-90. The main side-products were CH4, C2H6 and C2H4. The product distributions are shown in Fig. 5. The quantities are in the following order: C3H6 > CH4 > C2H4 > C2H6.

Zhuang et al. previously proposed that metallic In0 generated from highly dispersed In2O3 over Al2O3 support is the active site for PDH [46], [47], based on evidence of an induction period in terms of conversion. In contrast, in the current study, no such phenomenon was observed. Taking into account the fact that metallic indium has a melting point at ca. 157 °C, at the current reaction temperature the generated In0 could be highly mobile, leading to sintering of the indium domains. Given the catalytic performance of the IG catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with no observable induction period, one may surmise the active sites may be different from the proposal for the In2O3/Al2O3 system.
The most active catalyst (IG2-98) was chosen to evaluate the effect of the reaction temperature with the aim of finding an optimal operating condition. As shown in Fig. 6, the steady values of conversion decreased along with a decrease of reaction temperature. Meanwhile, a rough trend of C3H6 selectivity was observed: lower temperature led to higher selectivity, as expected (although the data in Fig. 6b have relatively larger scatter than those in Fig. 6a). This observation can be rationalized by the fact that lower hydrocarbon (C1–C2) byproducts formed through cracking and pyrolysis processes become kinetically and thermodynamically unfavorable at lower temperature [61]. Thus, an optimal temperature needs to be carefully chosen to suppress the side reactions while keeping the desired route kinetically active.

Ex situ XPS measurements were carried out to reveal the surface In/Ga ratio of the catalysts. The results for the series of catalysts before and after reaction are summarized in Table 4. It can be seen that the In/Ga ratio at the surface increased after the reaction. This may be due to the migration and agglomeration of indium from the bulk phase to the surface during the reaction. In addition, considering the redox properties of indium oxide, the dispersed In2O3 species at the surface can be simultaneously reduced by the formed H2 during the dehydrogenation, which leads to removal of surface oxygen and consequently causes an increase of the indium mass percentage at the surface.

Indium K-edge XANES was used to evaluate the electronic state of the In–Ga catalysts before and after reaction, and the fitting results are summarized in Table 4 as well. The raw XANES data and fitting curves are available in the supporting information as Figs. S5 and S6. From the data, it is clear that no metallic indium exists in the as-synthesized In–Ga catalysts. However, after dehydrogenation, all the In–Ga catalysts contain metallic indium to varying extents, suggesting that indium oxide domains are easily reduced under the reaction conditions employed. There is no obvious trend that correlates the In0/In3+ ratio with the overall In–Ga composition. This is possibly due to the complexity of the binary metal oxide system (i.e., how the guest indium oxide disperses in the primary Ga2O3, the domain size of indium oxide, etc.). It should be mentioned that metallic indium is quite stable to oxidation at room temperature and could hardly be oxidized to In2O3 under an ambient air environment, though it has been reported to form a ∼4 nm oxide layer after heating at 130 °C in air for 120 min [62]. In addition, although metallic indium can exhibit intermediate oxidation states at high temperature, in the current study, it is unlikely to occur as a stable species, since preparation of In2O from In2O3 was reported to require heating at 700 °C under vacuum conditions, while InO was only detected in the vapor phase [63].
In parallel with the XANES investigation, ex situ XRD measurements were carried out to examine any changes in crystallinity of the In–Ga catalysts after the reaction, with the results summarized in Fig. 7. For the IG10-90 and IG5-95 samples, characteristic peaks assigned to In2O3 (JCPDS 6-0416) appeared after the dehydrogenation reaction, consistent with indium sintering during reaction. Moreover, it is noteworthy that some diffraction peaks associated with metallic indium (JCPDS 85-1409) also appear [64]. This is due to the partial reduction upon exposure to reducing reaction conditions (600 °C with H2 and hydrocarbons). Such a conclusion is also supported by the H2-TPR experiments. Along with the XPS and XANES results, this provides evidence for the formation of In0 during the reaction. No obvious change is observed for the IG2-98 sample in the XRD pattern, likely due to the low indium loading, although the XANES spectra support the formation of some In0 domains in this material as well.

To gain insights into the stability and recyclability of the In–Ga catalysts, a re-oxidation step at 600 °C was added and IG10-90 was investigated over the course of two re-oxidation cycles after an initial period of activity. From Fig. 8, it is clear that after the re-oxidation step, the activity modestly increased during the first 20 min. However, overall, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst remained mostly unchanged, even after re-oxidation. An XRD measurement for IG10-90 catalyst after the re-oxidation step was also carried out and is shown in Fig. 7, where it can be observed that after exposing to air at the reaction temperature for 1 h, the main peak for the (1 0 1) plane of In0 slightly decreases in intensity, suggesting the In0 domains could be partly re-oxidized. Aside from this, the overall pattern is almost identical to that of the sample before re-oxidation. This observation suggests that during the reaction, the agglomeration of well-dispersed In2O3 to larger domains occurs and may be responsible for the loss of activity. Such a process, at least under the current re-oxidation treatment, is believed to not be completely reversible.

Regeneration conditions: re-oxidation step with air flow rate of 30 sccm, N2 purge before and after re-oxidation step with flow rate of 30 sccm.
H2 pretreatment was also applied to an example of IG10-90 prior to the reaction at 600 °C, with the results shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that the initial conversion was ∼16%, and dropped to a steady conversion of ∼12.5% after 70 min. After a 1-h H2-regeneration, the IG10-90 catalyst regained its original activity and decreased to the steady state conversion again within 70 min. Meanwhile, it should be noted that for this IG catalyst after the H2-treatment, the C3H6 selectivity was poorer than in the case of the O2-treatment. A H2-pretreatment (reducing some In2O3 to In0) could significantly change the surface properties (acidity, surface area) of the solid. Therefore, an H2-TPR followed by NH3-TPD over bulk In2O3 was investigated. After reduction by H2, the produced In0 showed a weak NH3 desorption signal, indicating the sample lost most of the surface acidity (see supporting material, Fig. S7). Our findings indicate that reduced In0 under reaction conditions may melt and migrate/agglomerate as a non-porous material, causing a dramatic loss of surface area and acidity, which is proposed to contribute to the loss of activity. In addition, the increase of In2O3 domain size (from ex situ XRD) might be another reason for loss of catalytic performance.

3.4. Coke analysis
As the main issue associated with deactivation in the PDH process is coke formation, Raman spectroscopy was used to examine the deposited carbonaceous species at the catalyst surface. The spectra were deconvoluted into a combination of 4 bands. The individual peak parameters (position, intensity, FWHM) were set based on visual inspection. Then the residuals between the raw data and overall fit were minimized in a least squares regression. The G band was fitted by a Lorentzian function, while a Gaussian function was used to fit other bands. Fig. 10 shows the stack of obtained Raman spectra as well as the fitted results for the spent IG catalysts that were used for the experiments shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, four distinguishable bands appear in the region of 1000–1800 cm−1. The most intensive band at ca. 1590 cm−1 is assigned as the G band, which is due to a highly crystalline carbonaceous material (i.e., a graphitic lattice) [65]. The second most intense band at ∼1360 cm−1 is the D1 band due to in-plane defects and heteroatoms in the carbon lattice. In addition, the D3 band at 1500 cm−1 and the D4 band at 1220 cm−1 are assigned as amorphous carbon (out-plane defect) and a disordered graphitic lattice, respectively [66]. A previous study tried to correlate the G band position to the graphite particle size, (1575 cm−1 for larger and perfect graphite crystals, while a blue shift to 1590 cm−1 indicated a decrease of the crystallite size) [67]. For the catalysts studied here, a clear correlation of the band position vs. the In–Ga ratio is not observed. However, the G band positions for the IG samples are all around 1590 cm−1, suggesting small graphite crystals amongst the deposited coke. An important parameter to describe degree of organization of the carbonaceous materials is the intensity ratio of the D1/G bands (R1 ratio). These values are listed in Table S2, where it can be seen that a decrease in the In/Ga ratio corresponds to the D1/G ratio dropping from 0.88 to 0.70. This indicates that a catalyst with a lower indium percentage tends to produce coke with a more ordered and graphitic nature. This might suggest a correlation between the nature of the coke formed and the steady state value of the C3H6 selectivity: coke with more graphitic nature is correlated with catalysts that yield a higher C3H6 selectivity, perhaps by suppressing side reactions that lead to low molecular weight (cracking) products. This would be consistent with Weckhuysen's previous study over Pt-based catalysts [66].

(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
It should be mentioned that the accurate quantitative analysis of coke in the catalysts by TGA is difficult in the current In–Ga–O system because the indium species reduced under reaction conditions are reoxidized during TGA experiments aimed at assessing the coke content on the catalysts. In this study, two methods were applied to estimate the total amount of formed coke: (i) direct TGA measurements with simplifying assumptions to deconvolute indium oxidation vs. carbon combustion, and (ii) examination of the carbon percentage of the remaining spent catalyst by elemental analysis. The TGA results are shown in the supporting information (Fig. S8). It should be noted that the mass loss during the 350–600 °C ramp range is the overall effect of mass loss due to the coke decomposition and mass gain due to oxidation of metallic indium produced under PDH conditions. In this way, the coke percentage was estimated by subtracting the indium re-oxidation (assuming all In0 atoms are oxidized. The indium content in each sample was measured by elemental analysis). The calculated deposited coke percentage as well as the carbon balance from both methods are summarized in Table 5. It can be seen that the general trend suggests that higher gallium content leads to more coke formation. In general, calibrated results based on these methods show good consistency, although method 1 provides a little higher coke estimate than method 2. The carbon balance after calibration using these methods is generally higher than 90%.

4. Conclusions
In this work we have explored In2O3–Ga2O3 mixed-oxide catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation reactions. This family of catalysts is shown to exhibit high intrinsic activity in terms of C3H8 conversion. Among the In–Ga catalysts, we report that IG2-98 provides maximum activity of 58.6 μmol/h/m2 (28-fold) and 4.9 μmol/h/gcat (3-fold) higher than the previously studied In2O3/Al2O3 catalysts even at a 4 times higher WHSV, although the steady value of C3H8 selectivity is less than half of that observed in In2O3/Al2O3 (ca. 35% vs. 85%). For the best catalyst operating at higher conversions, a stable conversion of ca. 25%, was achieved with a modest ca. 25% C3H6 selectivity. As expected, a lower reaction temperature helps to suppress side reactions (cracking) to enhance C3H6 selectivity, while suppressing overall productivity. H2-TPR measurements suggest the incorporation of In–O–Ga linkages improves the dispersion and reducibility of In2O3 domains. NH3-TPR experiments demonstrate a generation of acidic sites in the mixed oxides compared to the single component oxides. Raman analysis indicates that catalysts with deposited coke with more disordered structures have lower C3H6 selectivity, while catalysts with graphite-like coke better suppress side reactions and maintain higher level of C3H6 selectivity. Ex situ XPS, XRD, and XANES analysis illustrates the agglomeration of dispersed In2O3 domains and production of In0 are responsible, at least in part, for the loss of activity during use. These processes are not completely reversible under O2/H2 regeneration treatments.
The present study indicates that the In/Ga binary oxide system has potential as a new catalyst for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. However, due to the low/moderate propene selectivity and catalyst deactivation, substantial improvements in catalyst preparation would have to be achieved to reach a performance comparable to commercial Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts for this reaction.
