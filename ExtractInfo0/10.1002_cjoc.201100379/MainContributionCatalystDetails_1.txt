The given document does not pertain to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It discusses the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 over a ZnO supported HZSM-5 catalyst. However, it does not provide any details on the conversion, selectivity, stability, or other key performance metrics of this catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. As such, I cannot extract the requested information about the catalyst's scientific contributions to propane dehydrogenation processes.
