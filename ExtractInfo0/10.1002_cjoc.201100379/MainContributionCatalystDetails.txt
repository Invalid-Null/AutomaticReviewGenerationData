 Based on the multiple document extractions provided, I have synthesized the information into the following XML structure:

<output>
	<Relevance>
		No
	</Relevance>
</output>

None of the provided documents contained relevant information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation that could be extracted and structured into the requested XML format. The documents discussed propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 and did not provide details on conversion, selectivity, stability, or other metrics to assess the catalyst performance and scientific contribution. Since no pertinent propane dehydrogenation details could be extracted, I have indicated that the documents are not relevant in the XML output.
