 Based on the document, this does not appear to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document focuses on the oxidation of isoeugenol to vanillin using a molybdate stabilized magnesium-iron hydrotalcite catalyst. While oxidation reactions are discussed, propane is not mentioned as the substrate. Therefore, I would conclude this is not relevant to PDH or ODH.
