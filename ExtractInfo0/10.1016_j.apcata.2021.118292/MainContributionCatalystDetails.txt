 Based on the multiple document extracts provided, none of them appear to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation research. All extracts indicate the documents discuss the oxidation of isoeugenol to vanillin using various molybdate-stabilized hydrotalcite catalysts. Since propane dehydrogenation is not mentioned, I would assess these documents as not relevant.
