 Based on my analysis, the document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses the oxidation of isoeugenol to vanillin using molybdate-intercalated magnesium-iron hydrotalcite catalysts. It does not mention propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically.
