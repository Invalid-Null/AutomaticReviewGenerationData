Kinetics of propane dehydrogenation over Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst
Abstract
Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic models for catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Pt -Sn/Al2O3 are proposed based on the reaction mechanisms that take into account the one step or two-step dehydrogenation and are evaluated by fitting the experiments. When taking into consideration the fitting accuracy, the number of fitting parameters and the rigorousness of the reaction mechanism, the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation based on the assumptions of step-wise dehydrogenation, the first step dehydrogenation as the rate-determining step, and low surface coverage of C3H7 outperforms other kinetic models. The change of catalyst activity with time-on-stream is related to the rate of coke formation that depends on the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen. Finally a complete kinetic model, which includes propane dehydrogenation and cracking and catalyst deactivation because of coking, is developed, which is found to agree well with the changes of propane conversions with time-on-stream under different operating conditions. Direct measurement of coke formation is avoided by the approach employed in this study for the prediction of catalyst deactivation by coke deposition.

1. Introduction
Nowadays the world demand of propene is fast increasing [1], [2], [3] because of the heavy increase in the demand of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propene oxide, cumene, phenol, isopropylic alcohol and many other propene derivatives. The propene obtained as a co-product from steam crackers or FCC units does not satisfy the growing demand. Consequently, there is a great interest in developing alternative routes for propene production. Propane dehydrogenation is one of the techniques for on-purpose propene production, and several propane dehydrogenation processes, such as Oleflex and Catofin, have been commercialized.
Propane dehydrogenation is equilibrium limited and highly endothermic, which is usually carried out at 500–600 °C and atmospheric pressure on platinum or chromium catalysts. However, the dehydrogenation reaction is also accompanied with cracking and coking reactions at such conditions. While cracking decreases the propene yield, coking deactivates catalyst. As a result, periodic regeneration of the catalyst is required in industrial operation. Developing dehydrogenation catalysts with high activity and selectivity as well as good stability against coke formation remains a challenge.
Up to now, investigation on the reaction of propane dehydrogenation has been mainly focused on improving the catalytic performance. Many efforts have been devoted to improving the activity and selectivity by adding alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, transition metal and also Ga and Sn in the catalyst [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], understanding the mechanism of coke formation on the catalyst that causes catalyst deactivation, and building reliable reaction kinetics for process design and optimization [10], [11], [12], [13]. Compared with the investigation on the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation and coke formation and the study to improve the activity and stability of the catalyst, much less efforts have been made to establish complete and reliable kinetic models under industrial operating conditions and taking into consideration side reactions and catalyst deactivation. These models are essential for optimization of the reactor and the process to increase the propene yield and reduce the deactivation. Moreover, most of the kinetics reported in the literature are not complete because the catalyst deactivation is not considered, or the activity of the catalyst is not related to the rate of coke formation [14], [15], [16], [17]. Among the few complete kinetics published, Larsson et al. [18] combined the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation, which was a simple power law model, with the kinetics of coke formation. Thereafter, Lobera et al. [19] employed the generalized monolayer–multilayer coke growth model (MMCGM) [20], [21] to describe the kinetics of coking on Pt–Sn catalyst. Gascón et al. [22] used a similar approach to establish the kinetics for Cr2O3 catalyst. Moreover, in previous publications on propane dehydrogenation, only the temperature was considered to be responsible for catalyst deactivation. However, the gas compositions, including the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen, also have significant influences on the rate of coke formation and therefore catalyst deactivation.
For dynamic simulation and optimization of the process of propane dehydrogenation, a transient reaction kinetics, which takes all the important reactions into consideration is required. In this study, a kinetic model for propane dehydrogenation including propane cracking and catalyst deactivation over Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst is presented. Moreover, the rate of catalyst deactivation is related not only to temperature, but also to gas composition, i.e., C3H6 and H2 concentrations.
2. Kinetic model
2.1. Propane dehydrogenation
The mechanisms of dehydrogenation on several catalysts have been studied in a number of investigations. Jackson et al. [16] studied the dehydrogenation of propane over a chromium catalyst using isotopic labeling techniques coupled to transient flow methods and identified the rate determining step as the elimination of β-hydrogen from propyl radical. Biloen et al. [23] studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum and platinum–gold alloys, and also concluded that the subsequent conversion of the propyl radical into π-bonded propene via β-hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while the desorption of π-bonded propene had a comparatively low activation energy. Suzuki and Kaneko [24] investigated the dehydrogenation of propane over chromium–alumina–potassium oxide catalysts and proposed that the rate determining step of the reaction was the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane.
Recently we [25] studied the adsorption of the possible intermediates and the pathways of propane dissociation on Pt(1 1 1) by density functional theory. The results revealed that propane is physically adsorbed on Pt because the propane molecule has no unpaired electron and cannot bind with Pt atom. Trapping-mediated dissociative chemisorption indicated that the gas phase molecule is trapped in the potential field of the surface in the form of alkane, which accommodates to the temperature of the surface [26]. The physically adsorbed molecule may then either desorb or dissociate. Propene is chemically adsorbed on Pt by binding two surface Pt atoms through its unsaturated C–C bond. More interestingly, it was found that surface hydrogen has a remarkable influences on the overall reactions by promoting propene desorption and hindering propene dehydrogenation. However, it is still difficult to establish the reaction kinetics for a complex heterogeneous catalyst reaction such as propane dehydrogenation based solely on theoretical calculations due to the material and pressure gaps between theoretical calculations and experiments under practical operating conditions. Therefore, in this study the conventional Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) approach is employed to establish the kinetic models by assuming different reaction mechanisms and rate-determining steps.
In the first mechanism, direct dehydrogenation of gas phase molecule to propene on Pt surface, hydrogen dissociative adsorption, and propene desorption are involved.
(I1)
(I2)
(I3)
In fact, this is a simple mechanism that lumps up all the possible dehydrogenation steps. By assuming the surface reaction (I3) as the rate-determining step, the rate of propane conversion is:
(M1)
where [27]:
(1)
If the hydrogen adsorption is weak, the rate expression (M1) can be simplified to (M1-1):
(M1-1)
In another mechanism, both propene and hydrogen adsorption are considered but dehydrogenation is assumed to proceed step by step, i.e.
(II1)
(II2)
(II3)
(II4)
If the first C–H bond cleavage of propane (II1) is the rate-determining step, the rate expression can be derived as:
(M2)
If the second step with second C–H bond cleavage of propane (II2) is the rate-limiting step, the rate expression is:
(M3)
By assuming negligible surface coverage of C3H7, or C3H6 as the only dominating surface species, or H atom as the only dominating surface species, the rate expression can be further simplified to (M2-1), (M2-2) and (M2-3), respectively.
(M2-1)
(M2-2)
(M2-3)
2.2. Propane cracking
In preliminary propane dehydrogenation experiments on the Pt–Sn catalyst, only methane and ethene were detected as cracking products, which is in good agreement with the results reported by Wu et al. [28]. Therefore in addition to propane dehydrogenation, the side reaction considered is the cracking of propane to methane and ethylene, i.e.
(2)
The cracking rate is assumed to be first order with respect to propane,
(M4)
2.3. Coke formation and catalyst deactivation
Coke on the catalyst could form from several routes, such as deep cracking of propane, polymerization of olefins (mainly propene) and condensation of large molecules. The coke is mainly formed by two mechanisms, i.e., deep cracking of propane that leads to graphitized carbon, and polymerization, condensation etc., that lead to polyaromatics [29], [30], [31], [32]. These two mechanisms are represented by
(3)
(4)
The deep propane cracking Eq. (3) and the propene polymerization Eq. (4) can be assumed to be first order with respect to propane and propene. As H2 has definite influences on the coking rate, it should be included in the coking rate equation. Our DFT study showed H2 inhibits coke formation mainly by promoting propene desorption and decreasing the surface coverage of propene, which lowers the rate of deep cracking or polymerization of propene. Based on our DFT analysis, propene can be considered as the precursor for deep cracking and polymerization, and the influence of hydrogen on the coking rate is assumed the same for both deep cracking and for polymerization. Therefore, the coking rate on fresh catalyst is defined as:
(5)
where
and
are the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen. On partially coked catalyst, the coking rate is
(6)
where ac is the activity of the catalyst for coke formation.
As usual, the rate of propane dehydrogenation is written as
(7)
where r0 is the rate on fresh catalyst, and a is the activity of the catalyst. The change of catalyst activity with time generally takes the form [33]
(8)
where d is the deactivation order and ψd the “deactivation function”, usually expressed in a LHHW form [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]. By assuming that coke formation takes place on the same site for propane dehydrogenation, and only one site is involved in the rate determining steps for both propane dehydrogenation and coke formation, we have a first order catalyst deactivation and the same deactivation rate for propane dehydrogenation and coke formation, i.e.
(9)
where Cc is the concentration of the active sites occupied by the coke and Cm is the total concentration of the active sites. Therefore, Eq. (6) is rewritten as
(10)
Replacing Cc with Cm(1 − a) yields

3. Experimental
3.1. Catalyst preparation
The Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst used for kinetic study was prepared by incipient impregnation of Al2O3 (Pural 200) with H2PtCl6 and SnCl4 solutions, respectively. The catalysts were calcinated at 530 °C and treated with steam to remove chlorine.
3.2. Catalyst characterization
The catalyst was characterized by N2 physisorption on ASAP 2010 (Micromeritics, USA) at −196 °C after out-gassing the samples for at least 5 h at 190 °C and 1 mm Hg vacuum. The specific surface areas were calculated with BET equation, and the pore volumes and pore size distributions were determined from the N2 desorption isotherms by using the BJH method. Prior to the kinetic experiment, the catalyst was ground and sieved to particle sizes between 0.1 and 0.15 mm.
3.3. Experimental set-up
The tubular reactor for the kinetic experiments was a stainless tube with an inner diameter of 6 mm, the temperature of which was maintained by an electrical furnace jacketed outside the reactor. Inside the catalyst packing inserted was a thermocouple for indication of the real temperature for reaction. Silica sands as inert packing were used for a uniform flow distribution. An online gas chromatography (Agilent 4890D) was used to measure the outlet gas concentration (Agilent 4890D). The propane conversion and the selectivity to propene were calculated, respectively, by
(11)
(12)
where F0 and F are the inlet and outlet molar flow rate. yi0 represents the molar ratio of specie “i” in the feed gas and yi represents the molar ratio of specie “i” (i = Ar, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, C3H8 and H2) in the outlet gas.
3.4. Blank test
In order to check whether the wall of the reactor and inert packing (mainly quartz particles) catalyze the reaction, several blank tests were carried out at different temperatures with a flow rate of 80.0 ml/min and the results are shown in Table 1. A very small amount of propane was converted, which was possibly due to thermal cracking. The even smaller amount of C3H6 formed at 600 °C might also come from thermal cracking. In this study, however, C3H6 is considered to be formed only by catalytic dehydrogenation. The formation of propene from propane by thermal cracking or catalyzed by the wall of the reactor or by the inert packing can be neglected. To elucidate whether the reactor has an influence on the conversion of propene, both propene and hydrogen with equal molar fractions were fed into the reactor at 600 °C. About 1.0% of the propene is converted to methane, ethene and propane and, based on the carbon balance, 0.1% of the propene is estimated to be converted into coke.

600 1.4 2.33
n.d.: Not detected.
3.5. Kinetic experiments
The kinetic experiments were carried out in the fixed bed reactor at temperatures ranging from 530 to 600 °C and under 100 kPa. The total feed flow rate was kept 80.0 ml/min for all the runs. The partial pressures of propane, propene and hydrogen were varied by adjusting balance flow. In each experiment 100 mg catalyst was used. After being loaded in a tubular reactor, the catalyst was reduced in situ in a flow of H2 (10 ml/min) for 100 min at 500 °C.

4.2. Effects of mass and heat transports on the reactions
Catalysts with four different averaged diameters were used to investigate the influences of internal mass diffusion. The experiments were carried out at 600 °C, the highest temperature in the interested temperature region. The W/F was kept 30 g min/mol constant. Fig. 1 shows that the initial propane conversions of propane did not change remarkably when the size of the catalyst was smaller than 0.3 mm. Therefore, catalyst with an averaged size of 0.15 mm was employed in the experiments to eliminate the influences of pore diffusion.

The catalyst with an averaged size of 0.15 mm was used to study the influences of the effects of external mass and heat transport on the reactions. Experiments with 0.10 g and 0.20 g catalyst, respectively, were carried out. The flow rate was varied to change the gas velocity through the catalyst bed. Fig. 2 shows the changes of initial propane conversions of propane with W/F ratios. The conversion at any space velocity should be independent of the linear velocity through the bed in the absence of interphase transport limitations [17]. As seen in Fig. 2, for the same W/F ratio, the conversion will be different when the W/F ratio is large (>50 g min/mol), which is because of the large difference in the linear velocity and the external mass and heat transport. When the W/F ratio is smaller than 50 g min/mol, the influence of external transport can be neglected. In our kinetic experiments, the W/F ratios were less than 30 g min/mol to eliminate the influences of transport limitation.

4.3. Propane conversions at different conditions
The effects of temperature, propane, propene and hydrogen pressures on propane dehydrogenation are shown in Fig. 3(a–d), respectively. Propane conversion increases remarkably with temperature (Fig. 3(a)) as expected. The conversion decreases with time on stream and more rapidly at higher temperatures owing to faster catalyst deactivation. The propane conversion decreases with increasing propene concentration (Fig. 3(c)), but is only slightly influenced by hydrogen concentration (Fig. 3(d)). It indicates a strong adsorption of propene, which occupies most of the surfaces. High propene concentration decreases the free site for adsorption of the reactant molecules, and thus lowers the reaction rate. Although no significant effect of hydrogen on propane dehydrogenation is observed, the deactivation rate is lower at higher hydrogen concentration. It indicates an inhibition of coke formation by hydrogen. The deactivation rate depends more strongly on propene (Fig. 3(c)) than on propane (Fig. 3(b)). It implies that propene instead of propane is possibly the coking precursor.

5. Model discrimination and parameter estimation
Referring to the rate Eqs. (M1), (1), (M1-1), (II1), (II2), (II3), (II4), (M2), (M3) corresponding to the different reaction mechanisms or different assumption of rate determining step, one can see that if the adsorption terms and the reversible reaction are negligible, (M1) and (M2) can be reduced to one rate equation which is the first order with respect to propane and zero order to hydrogen, while (M3) can be reduced to a rate equation which is the first order with respect to propane and −0.5 to hydrogen. Therefore it is possible to discriminate (M3) from the other kinetic models based on the determination of the reaction order of hydrogen. For this reason, some experiments were carried out at very low propane and hydrogen partial pressures (smaller than 10 kPa) and a high space velocity to guarantee negligible adsorption and reversible reaction. The rates of propane consumption shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 indicate that the reaction is indeed first order to propane but zero order to hydrogen. Therefore, the kinetic experiments clearly exclude (M3) from the mechanisms. As it will also be shown later, this model cannot fit experimental data well.

(M1) and (M2) are supposed to be better than (M1-1) because both of them have taken into account of hydrogen adsorption, which is important in propane dehydrogenation [25]. The simplified models (M2-1), (M2-2) and (M2-3) will certainly not able to fit the experiments as accurately as (M2), but they have less parameters and some of them may outperform (M2) if the number of parameters is also an account. To compare the different kinetics compromising the fitting accuracy and number of fitting parameters, the criteria suggested by Akaike [41] was used,
(13)
This criterion takes into consideration the span of independent data set and the number of experiments points for parameter estimation and has been normalized to be independent of the scale of data. For the same data set for parameter fitting, the MSC value depends only on the fitting accuracy and the number of fitting parameters. The MSC value is therefore a good indication of the usefulness and appropriateness of the model because it is a good balance between under-fitting and over-fitting. The best model is the one with the largest MSC value.
By assuming plug-flow, the reactor models with different reaction kinetics and rate constants are integrated by Runge–Kutta method to give the outlet concentrations under different operating conditions. To simplify the discrimination of the kinetic models, the coking rate equations and catalyst deactivation is temporarily not considered, and for each run of the experiments with a series of time dependent concentration profiles, only the first analysis data (i.e., the propene and methane concentrations), which indicate the initial rates of dehydrogenation and cracking, are used for the data fitting. In the fitting, the reaction constants (k1, k2, fc, K1, K2, K3) are expressed as the reparametrized form of Arrhenius equations (Eqs. (14) and (15)) and a reference temperature Tm (565 °C) is employed.
(14)
(15)
The parameters are determined by the least-square method to minimize the SSR,
(16)
where Y is the outlet concentration and i represents propane, propene, hydrogen, methane and ethene.
Listed in Table 3 are the MSC and SSR values for all the seven kinetic models. (M1) emerges as the best one according to the MSC value; however, it involves the lumping of the elementary steps. (M2) has the least SSR value, and is the best model to fit the experiments; however, it has more parameters than (M1). (M1-1), as expected, is worse than (M1) and (M2) since it has not taken the adsorption of hydrogen into account. Among the three models derived from (M2), (M2-2) and (M2-3) have large fitting residuals, indicating the assumption of negligible coverage of either propene or hydrogen is not appropriate. It indicates that hydrogen also adsorbs relatively strongly at high hydrogen pressures, which reduces significantly not only the rate of propane dehydrogenation but also the rates of coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Although (M2-1) has a fitting residual slightly higher than (M2) and (M1), it is considered as the best kinetic model for propane dehydrogenation because the underline reaction mechanism is reliable, the rate equations are simple, and the predictions are acceptable.

The model (M3) cannot well describe the experimental results, which is in accordance with the above discussions that the second dehydrogenation, namely propyl dehydrogenation could not be the rate-determining step. However, this is in disagreement with the results of Biloen et al. [23]. The contraversial results were also observed on Cr catalysts [16], [24]. This implies that the rate determining step may be dependent on the structure of the catalyst, e.g. the size and surface orientation. A systematic study is necessary in the future to test this hypothese.
The kinetic parameters in dehydrogenation (M2-1), cracking (M4), and deactivation (M5), are then estimated by fitting the changes of propene and methane concentrations with time on stream (about 400 data points). It is noted here that, because of the small conversion of propane, the activity of the catalyst is assumed to be independent of the axial position. The kinetic parameters in (M2-1) and (M4) obtained by fitting to initial experimental data are used the initial values for the model fitting. No significant change in parameter values is found by re-fitting all the data. Table 4 summarizes the values of all the parameters of the reaction kinetics.

The predictions made by the established reaction kinetics (M2-1) are shown in Fig. 3 (dashed line), displaying a good agreement with the experimental data.
Table 5, Table 6 summarize the reported activation energies of propane dehydrogenation and also the adsorption energies of propane, propene and hydrogen on platinum determined by experiments and DFT calculation. The activation energy for propane dehydrogenation varies from 30 to 170 kJ/mol, while it is determined to be 44.7 kJ/mol in the present work, which agrees with the results reported by Lobera et al. [19] and Gascón et al. [22]. However, high activation energies were obtained by Biloen et al. [23] and Chen et al. [42]. Although there was no mention about the Pt particle sizes in these references, we still regard that the differences of the activation energies are resulted by the differences in the particle sizes of the Pt catalysts. It is believed that the surface is mostly terminated by steps and edges on smaller particles, while the surface is mostly terminated by terraces on larger particles [44], [45]. In addition, reactions proceeding on stepped surfaces tend to have smaller activation energies than those proceeding on terrace surfaces [46].

The experimental adsorption energies of propene reported by Chen et al. [42] and Lobera et al. [19] were 32.02 and 85.82 kJ/mol, respectively, and the difference was mainly due to the different catalysts employed in the experiments. The calculated adsorption energy of propene was in the range of 38.5–89.7 kJ/mol [25], [43], and the differences among these adsorption energies of propene were mainly because of the different models employed for calculation. The adsorption energy of propene determined in our study is 94.3 kJ/mol, which is reasonable according to the results of both experimental and DFT calculation.
However, the adsorption energy of hydrogen (238.9 kJ/mol) in our model is higher than that reported by Chen et al. [42], indicating the adsorption of hydrogen is stronger in our study. It is also probably contributed by the corners and steps on smaller Pt particle size [47], [48]. On Pt with silica-supported, the heats of hydrogen adsorption determined by microcalorimetric measurement [49], [50] were 95 and 93 kJ/mol at 300 K and 403 K, respectively. The initial differential heats were essentially the same for the 1.2 wt.% Pt, 6:1 Pt/Sn and 6:1 Pt/Sn catalysts, while for the 1:3 Pt/Sn catalyst, the initial heat was approximately 75 kJ/mol [50]. It seems that the present model overestimated the adsorption heat of hydrogen.
6. Conclusion
In this study, propane dehydrogenation experiments are carried out on Pt–Sn catalyst at different temperatures and with different inlet propane, propene and hydrogen concentrations. A reaction kinetic model of propane dehydrogenation including cracking and deactivation is established following the LH approach. The first C–H cleavage in propane molecule is identified as the rate-determining step. The underline reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the kinetic model agrees with experiments and quantum chemistry calculations.
The kinetic model of coke formation taking into account the effects of propene and hydrogen is integrated into the deactivation model. The propene is identified as the main precursor for the coke formation and hydrogen suppressed coke formation and thus deactivation. The model describes well the kinetics of catalyst deactivation, which is related to the rate of coke formation and takes into consideration the facts that propene promotes while hydrogen depresses coke formation, is proposed. The changes of propane conversion with time-on-stream under different operating conditions are well predicted by the deactivation model. The strategy for kinetic modeling employed in the present work is to directly integrate the coking formation kinetic model into the deactivation model, making it possible to avoid measurement of coke content in situ. It makes the modeling relatively simple but still keeps a good predictive capability.
