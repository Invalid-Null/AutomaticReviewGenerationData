The provided document does not contain any discussion of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) to convert propane to propylene. The document focuses on industrial hydrogen production processes like methane steam reforming, methanol steam reforming, ethanol steam reforming, water-gas shift reaction, and dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, ethylbenzene, ethane, and propane. But there is no specific mention of propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene. Therefore, this document is not relevant for extracting information about catalysts for PDH or ODH processes.
