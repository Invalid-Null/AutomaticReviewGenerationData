 Based on the given document, this does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document discusses improved selectivity and coke resistance of core-shell alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide details on conversion to propylene specifically. Since it does not contain information about converting propane to propylene through PDH or ODH processes, I cannot extract the requested details about catalyst performance.
