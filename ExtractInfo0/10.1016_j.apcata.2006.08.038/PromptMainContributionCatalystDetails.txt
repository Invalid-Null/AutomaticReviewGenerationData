Effects of Ce addition on the Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation to propylene
Abstract
The effects of Ce addition on the Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation to propylene have been investigated by reaction tests and some physicochemical characterizations like XRD, BET, NH3-TPD, H2-TPD, H2-TPR, H2-chemisorption, CO-FTIR and TPO. The results show that the Ce addition could greatly improve the catalytic performance and catalytic stability of the Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3, which is reported as the optimal catalyst for propane dehydrogenation to propylene. We could keep >38% of propane conversion, >98% propylene selectivity and >37% propylene yield over 50 h in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propylene over Pt-Sn/Ce-Al2O3 catalysts at 576 °C, 3800 h−1 and H2/C3H8/Ar = 1/1/5. The presence of Ce in the Pt-Sn/Ce-Al2O3 catalysts could not only stabilize the active states of Pt, Sn and support, but could also suppress the coke accumulation on the catalyst during reaction, and further improve the catalytic performance of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3.

1. Introduction
Recently, the dehydrogenation of light paraffin has acquired importance due to the growing demand for light olefins such as propylene and isobutene. Nowadays, most of the propylene is obtained as by-product of gasoline production by both thermal and catalytic cracking processes, thus, the gasoline market demands determine the availability of olefins. Propane dehydrogenation is believed to have a great potential as a propylene booster in the future [1].
The platinum-tin-alumina-supported catalysts have been widely used not only in the petroleum industry for naphtha reforming, but also in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions. Over these platinum-supported catalysts, the stability and selectivity for paraffin dehydrogenation to olefins increases while cracking process, isomerization reactions and coke formation process are suppressed [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Important progresses in the PtSn catalyst have been reported in a large number of papers [7], [8], [9], [10]. Sergio et al. [10] reported that, over PtSnGa/ZnAl2O4 catalyst, a high dehydrogenation performance was obtained. At reaction conditions: T = 580 °C, H2:C3H8:He = 9:10:81, WGHSV = 0.037 h−1, and reaction time: 80 min, the mean yield of propylene reached 33%. However, the dehydrogenation performance of PtSn catalysts is still not satisfactory, especially regarding the stability of the catalysts. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the stability of PtSn catalysts during light paraffin conversion.
The catalytic properties of the PtSn bimetallic catalysts strongly depend on the interaction between Pt and Sn, and on the state of Sn. When Sn exists in a metallic state, it may be a poison; when it exists in a nonmetallic state, it acts as a promoter [11], [12]. It has been reported by Del Angel et al. [13] that the addition of lanthanum to PtSn/Al2O3 can strongly influence the states of Pt and Sn.
Rare earth elements, such as lanthanum and cerium, have unique properties which are related to the thermal stabilization of the alumina support and to strong metal–rare earth oxide interaction [13], [14]. It has been reported that the main role of CeO2 in CeO2/γ-Al2O3 is to improve the thermal stability of the support, which is attributed to the CeAlO3 formation [15]. Metal–ceria oxide interaction could strongly modify the structural and electronic properties of the supported noble metal. Therefore, the promotion effects of cerium on the catalytic performance of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst were studied in this research.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A commercial γ-Al2O3 (SBET: ≥250 m2 g−1), previously 40–60 mesh sieved and calcined in air at 550 °C for 4 h, was used as support. Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by impregnating γ-Al2O3 with excess aqueous solution of the Pt precursor (H2PtCl6). After impregnation, the catalyst was dried at 110 °C overnight and then calcined at 500 °C in air for 4 h. For Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/Ce-γ-Al2O3 catalysts, Sn or Ce was first deposited by impregnating SnCl2 ethanol solution or Ce(NO3)3 aqueous solution, then dried and calcined, and finally the Pt component was added from aqueous Pt solution in a similar way. In the case of Pt-Sn/Ce-γ-Al2O3 catalysts, Sn and Ce were first deposited by co-impregnating SnCl2 and Ce(NO3)3 ethanol solution, then dried and calcined. Finally, the Pt component was added as described previously. In all cases, the loadings of Pt and Sn were 0.3 and 0.9 wt.%, respectively. The catalysts were labeled as follows: Pt/Al for platinum supported on alumina, Pt-Sn/Al for platinum-tin supported on alumina and Pt-Sn/Ce-Al for platinum-tin-cerium supported on alumina. Catalysts were marked as 0.55Ce, 1.1Ce, 2.2Ce and 3.3Ce, indicating the wt.% amount of Ce loaded in the catalyst.
2.2. Catalyst characterizations
2.2.1. BET surface area
The surface area was obtained from N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms determined at liquid nitrogen temperature on an automatic analyzer (NOVA 4000, Quantachrome, USA). The samples were outgassed for 1 h under vacuum at 300 °C prior to adsorption.
2.2.2. X-ray diffraction
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Philips CM-1 (Cu Kα, λ = 0.1543 nm) powder X-ray diffractometer. The X-ray tube was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. Spectra were scanned at a rate of 5° min−1 (in 2θ).
2.2.3. NH3-TPD
The acidity of some samples was measured by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) on an ASAP 2010C chemisorption analyzer. Samples (0.2 g) were placed into a quartz U-type reactor between two quartz wool plugs. The samples were treated by flowing dry argon (99.99%) at 500 °C for 1 h prior to adsorption of ammonia. Then, samples were saturated by an ammonia pulse at room temperature. Before the run, the baseline was stabilized in dry argon (30 ml/min) at the same temperature for 2 h. Subsequently, the temperature was raised up to 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The NH3 desorption profile was registered with a thermal conductivity detector.
2.2.4. H2-TPR
Temperature-programmed reduction experiments were carried out in a conventional setup, consisting of a programmable temperature furnace. Samples (0.08 g) were filled in the quartz reactor. Prior to TPR analysis, the samples were treated in situ by flowing dry argon (30 ml/min) at 500 °C for 1 h. Before the run the baseline was stabilized in the gas flow at 25 °C for 60 min. The reactor was heated in a temperature-programmed furnace from room temperature to 800 °C (10 °C/min). A 5% (v/v) H2 in Ar mixture was used as a reducing gas. The hydrogen consumption as a function of reduction temperature was continuously monitored with a TCD cell and recorded. The apparatus was calibrated by the reduction of pure CuO.
2.2.5. H2-TPD and H2-chemisorption
Temperature-programmed desorption of hydrogen and hydrogen pulse chemisorption experiments were carried out in the same setup as TPR. Before pulse chemisorption experiments, the samples (0.2 g) were reduced under flowing pure H2 (12.6 ml/min) at 576 °C for 2.5 h, then purged in Ar at 550 °C for 120 min and cooled to 25 °C in flowing Ar. The pulse size was 0.32 ml 5% (v/v) H2 in Ar mixture and the time between pulses was 3 min. Before TPD experiments, the samples (0.2 g) were reduced under flowing pure H2 (12.6 ml/min) at 576 °C for 2.5 h. After the reduction the catalyst was cooled to 25 °C in flowing H2. The gas stream was switched to Ar and subsequently a TPD experiment was performed (10 °C/min up to 540 °C).
2.2.6. IR CO adsorption
For IR studies, infrared spectra of 4 cm−1 resolution were recorded by a FTIR spectrometer (EQUINOX55) with a Pyrex glass IR cell equipped with CaF2 windows, using 64 scans for each spectrum. For the FTIR study, the catalysts were compressed to disks (Ø = 1 cm, about 15 mg) which were placed in the sample holder of the IR cell. This IR cell enabled in situ treatments (0–500 °C) of the solid with a gas flow at atmospheric pressure. Prior to CO adsorption, the samples were reduced under a flow of H2 (50 ml/min) for 90 min at 400 °C. After the sample was cooled to room temperature in the flow of H2, the IR cell was evacuated to 2 × 10−2 Pa for 6 h. Then the CO was introduced into the cell (CO pressure: 2.7 × 103 Pa) and maintained for 1 h at 25 °C. The excess of CO was evacuated and the CO adsorption spectra were recorded. The adsorptions by the windows and by the blank powdered sample were subtracted from all the spectra.
2.2.7. TPO
In temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of carbon experiments, the reacted samples (0.2 g) were purged in a He flow (40 ml/min) at 500 °C for 30 min and then the temperature lowered to 25 °C prior to the TPO in a 2 vol.% oxygen/98 vol.% helium mixture flow of 40 ml/min. The temperature was ramped up at 10 °C/min while the CO2 generated was monitored by an on-line mass spectrometer (Omnisorp. Corporation).
2.2.8. O2-pulse
The amount of carbon formed on catalysts during the reaction was determined by O2-pulse experiments on a gas chromatograph flow system. The pulse experiments were carried out at 800 °C by injecting pulses of pure oxygen (pulse volume: 0.3 ml STP) to the carbon deposited catalysts (0.03 g), which was maintained under flowing Ar (30 ml/min) between two successive pulses. The CO2 generated was continuously monitored with a TCD cell and recorded. The pulses of pure oxygen were stopped when the deposited carbon was entirely converted to CO2.
2.3. Catalytic test
Catalysts were tested in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in a flow reactor at atmospheric pressure. A sample (0.3 g), placed in a quartz fixed-bed reactor, was previously reduced under flowing pure H2 (12.6 ml/min) at 576 °C for 2.5 h. Then the reaction mixture composed of H2, C3H8 and Ar (H2/C3H8/Ar molar ratio = 1:1:5) was fed to the reactor. The total GHSV was 3800 h−1. Five minutes after the beginning of the reaction, the gas compositions of reactant and products were analyzed by an FID chromatographic system (Shimadzu GC14-C) with a Porapak-Q packed column.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The performance of the catalysts
The performance of the catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is shown in Fig. 1. The initial conversions of propane catalyzed by Pt/Al, Pt-Sn/Al, Pt/1.1Ce-Al and Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalysts are 34.10, 42.27, 43.26 and 43.78%, respectively; after 150 min, the conversions decrease to 18.65, 32.47, 24.06 and 39.76%, respectively. It can be seen that the Pt/Al catalyst shows the poorest activity and stability. Addition of Ce to Pt/Al catalyst results in the increase of propane initial conversion from 34.10 to 43.26%. However, the propylene selectivity (initial: 64.10%; final: 88.18%) markedly decreases, which suggests that the rates of hydrogenolysis and coke reactions are significant for the product distribution. The highest dehydrogenation activity, selectivity and stability are obtained over Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst. The initial and final selectivities for propylene over Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst are 92.54 and 97.19%, respectively. The effect of Ce on the Pt/Al catalyst is only the improvement of the initial activity. However, one notable effect of Ce on Pt-Sn/Al catalyst is the improvement of overall dehydrogenation performance, especially with respect to the stability.

3.2. Effect of cerium concentration
Fig. 2 shows the propane conversion and propylene selectivity over Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalysts with various cerium loadings. When the cerium loading is in the range of 1.1–3.3 wt.%, the propane conversion and catalytic stability are greatly improved. However, the higher cerium concentration (≥3.3 wt.%) leads to a decline in the activity and selectivity. It is possible that higher Ce concentration changes the support structure and properties, and further changes the catalytic performance. Over Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al catalyst the propane conversion reaches its maximum. The initial and final conversions of propane are 47.09 and 44.00%, respectively, which means the deactivation rate is at the minimum.

3.3. Effect of temperature
Fig. 3 shows the temperature dependence of conversion and selectivity of the Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al catalyst. The initial conversions of propane are 18.59, 32.65, 47.09 and 62.46%, at 516, 546, 576 and 606 °C, respectively, and the final conversions are18.16, 32.18, 43.98 and 52.91%, respectively. The initial selectivity decreased with the increase of temperature. It can be seen that the Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al catalyst exhibits the highly efficient dehydrogenation performance above 576 °C. The mean yield of propylene reaches 53% during 155 min reaction at 606 °C.

3.4. Regeneration and stability test
To further assess the performance of the Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al catalyst, we made a comparison with the conventional Pt-Sn/Al catalyst by using a recycle reaction. The results are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the initial propane conversions increase after catalyst regeneration. However, propane conversion decreases with increasing reaction time. It is obvious that the deactivation rate of the Pt-Sn/Al catalyst is much faster than that of the Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al catalyst with the increase of recycle number. In the fourth cycle reaction, the initial and final conversions over Pt-Sn/Al catalyst are 58.00, 17.00%, respectively; over Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al catalyst, the initial and final conversions are 53.00, 41.00%, respectively. A remarkable stability of dehydrogenation in recycle reaction is obtained over Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al catalyst.

Regeneration conditions: catalyst regeneration was performed by oxidative treatment using pure air (12.6 ml/min) for 1 h at 580 °C. Then, the catalyst was reduced in flowing pure hydrogen (12.6 ml/min) for 2 h at 580 °C.
A stability test of the Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst was also carried out. The propane conversion and the selectivity to propylene as a function of the reaction time are shown in Fig. 5. On one hand, the selectivity increases quickly from 86.00 to 93.00% in the initial period, then a high value (over 94.00%) is obtained in the overall process. On the other hand, only a small deactivation rate is displayed in the overall process. The mean yield of propylene is about 39% during the course of reaction for 50 h.

3.5. Characterization of the catalysts
3.5.1. Textural property
Table 1 gives the physicochemical properties of the fresh catalysts after reduction. It is seen that the surface area of the Pt/Al catalyst is slightly higher than that of the promoted catalysts. The surface area of Pt-Sn/Al catalyst is much smaller than that of Pt/Ce-Al catalyst. The surface area of Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalyst is slightly higher than that of Pt-Sn/Al catalyst. The variation of the surface area could be related to the influence of CeO2 on the thermal stability of alumina. It has been reported [16], [17] that CeO2 could stabilize γ-Al2O3 against surface area loss by preventing the transformation of γ-Al2O3 to α-Al2O3, which depends on CeO2 loading. Low CeO2 loading is most effective in promoting the thermal stability of alumina while high CeO2 loading is almost ineffective. Platinum dispersion estimates, which were calculated from pulse chemisorption at 25 °C using the assumption H:Pt = 1 [18], [19], are listed in Table 1. The chemisorption results indicate that the addition of Sn or Ce to Pt/Al increases platinum dispersion, which implies that the presence of Sn or Ce over Pt/Al catalyst could decrease the size of platinum particles and further promote the reactivity (as is indicated by Fig. 1) because previous studies have shown that the active site for propane dehydrogenation to propylene is the single platinum atom [20]. Addition of Ce to Pt-Sn/Al does not result in an obvious change in platinum dispersion, which may be responsible for the almost identical initial reactivity values for Pt-Sn/Al and Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalysts. However, with higher cerium loading, for the Pt-Sn/3.3Ce-Al catalyst, a decrease in platinum dispersion is observed. An explanation could be that ceria species block the platinum particles, and further decrease the dispersion of platinum and the initial reactivity (Fig. 2).

3.5.2. X-ray diffraction spectra of catalysts
The catalysts after reduction were investigated by X-ray diffractometer. No catalysts show any diffraction peaks of Pt and Sn species, due to their small crystallite size or low concentration of Pt and Sn. Only the spectrum of Pt-Sn/3.3Ce-Al catalyst is shown in Fig. 6. For comparison, the spectra of CeO2 and γ-Al2O3 are also presented. On one hand, small characteristic diffraction lines at 2θ = 28.5°, 33.3°, 47.5° and 56.4° of CeO2 fluorite structure [21] are detected in the Pt-Sn/3.3Ce-Al catalyst. On the other hand, very small diffraction lines of CeAlO3 at 2θ = 23.5°, 33.5°, 41.4° and 60° [22] are also observed in this catalyst. Catalysts with cerium loading at ≤3.3 wt.% do not show any clear diffraction peaks of crystalline CeO2 and CeAlO3, which is related to the low concentration of cerium or the small crystallite size below the XRD detection limit. Using XPS, Bak and Hilaire [23] reported, on a low cerium content Pt-CeO2/Al2O3 sample after reduction, that part of the cerium species could exist in the form of CeAlO3.

The above BET and XRD analyses show that, although the presence of cerium could not promote the dispersion of platinum, it leads to a slight increase of surface area of the catalysts. Cerium could promote the thermal stability of alumina against surface area loss in the elevated temperature dehydrogenation conditions, which is connected to the formation of Ce3+ as CeAlO3 under reducing atmosphere. Thus, the surface diffusion of catalyst components for sintering could be inhibited. According to a model proposed by Humber et al. [24], the geometrical arrangement between CeAlO3 and CeO2 favors the formation of microdomains that act as barriers for surface diffusion. Shyu and Otto [25] have also reported that, over Pt/Ce-Al2O3 catalyst, the strong interaction between dispersed Ce and alumina results in the formation of surface CeAlO3 by Ce3+cations occupying vacant octahedral sites on alumina surface. This initial occupation of octahedral sites by cerium cations blocks the transition of Al3+cations from tetrahedral to octahedral sites during high-temperature treatment, which causes the loss of the surface area of alumina [26]. The high stability values of Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalyst at elevated temperature and in regeneration conditions partly profit from the improvement in the thermal stability of alumina.
3.5.3. NH3-TPD analysis
The dehydrogenation performance of the catalyst is strongly related to the acidity of the catalyst. The acidity of some catalysts was examined by NH3-TPD experiments. The profiles of NH3-TPD are shown in Fig. 7. A semi-quantitative comparison of the adsorption strength distribution was achieved by the deconvolution of the peaks using normal distribution functions. The semi-quantitative results after the multi-peak fitting are illustrated in Table 2. On all catalysts, a broad desorption peak with a maximum at 172–182 °C and a shoulder at higher temperature (260–290 °C) are clearly visible. The low temperature peak could be ascribed to weak and medium strength acid sites, whereas the peak above 260 °C is typical of strong acidity sites. Although the addition of Sn or Ce to Pt/Al catalysts could reduce the intensity of the strong acidity sites, judging from the higher temperature desorption peak of NH3, the presence of Ce results in an increase in the strong acidity peak fraction and the total amount of acidity in Pt/Ce-Al system. The strong acidity sites are needed for the formation of highly dehydrogenated species through isomerization and coking reactions on the surface of the catalyst [27]. The poor stability and selectivity for Pt/Al and Pt/Ce-Al catalyst would be related to the comparatively high acidity. The addition of Ce to Pt-Sn/Al catalyst dose not result in a substantial change in the total acidity of the system.

3.5.4. H2-TPR analysis
Previous studies have shown that the presence of ceria can strongly influence the oxidation and reduction properties of supported noble metals (Pt, Rh and Pd) [28]. The effects of ceria on the reduction properties of catalysts were measured by TPR. The TPR profiles of all samples are shown in Fig. 8 (A–B). All samples exhibit a sharp reduction peak at about 700 °C. The origin of the 700 °C peak is not clearly known. When Pt is present, this peak shifts to a low temperature and becomes broad. The 1.1Ce-Al2O3 sample, Fig. 8(A-b), exhibits a very small H2 consumption over a large temperature range. According to literature data [29], the first one at about 472 °C could be attributed to the reduction of surface oxygen over CeO2, and the second one at 598 °C could be either the result of the formation of a nonstoichiometric oxide CeO2−x or due to the formation of CeAlO3 which becomes thermodynamically possible at this temperature.

Pt/Al catalyst, Fig. 8 (A-c), displays two reduction peaks, one near 241 °C and the other near 467 °C. Two types of Pt oxides are generally considered in the literature: one in a weak interaction with the support and the other in a strong interaction with the support [30], [31], [32]. The former can be reduced at low temperatures and the latter requires higher temperatures. Therefore, we could associate the hydrogen consumption at 241 and 467 °C to the reduction of the two types of platinum species.
Concerning Pt-Sn/Al catalyst, Fig. 8(A-d), two low temperature reduction peaks are present, one at 263 °C, and the other at 436 °C. The amount of H2 consumed in this process is much higher than that required for the reduction of Pt oxides, as reduction of SnO2 occurs concurrently at this low temperature. The presence of Pt can notably assist the reduction of SnO2 and can even lead to the formation of PtSn alloy [33].
The TPR profile for Pt/1.1Ce-Al catalyst, Fig. 8(A-e), is dramatically different from that of 1.1Ce-Al sample. On one hand, the presence of Pt effectively promotes the reduction of surface oxygen and ceria species, judged by the shift of TPR peaks to lower temperatures. Previous studies [34] show that deposition of Pt on the surface of ceria causes easier reduction of the surface of CeO2. This is because the presence of noble metals can increase the oxygen storage capacity of CeO2 due to noble metal–CeO2 interaction [35]. On the other hand, due to the presence of ceria, the second reduction peak of Pt oxides shifts to lower temperatures, from 467 to 432 °C. It indicates that Pt may interact preferentially with CeO2 rather than with Al2O3 [36], [37]. The phenomenon that the presence of CeO2 on Al2O3 promotes the reduction of Pt oxide species is also reported by others [34].
It can be seen, from the curve of Fig. 8(A-f), that when the three components of Pt, Sn and Ce coexist, the profile of Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al is different from that of Pt-Sn/Al catalyst. Only one broad main reduction peak, from 260 to 560 °C, is observed. The continuous reduction peaks indicate that strong interactions between the three components take place. The overall hydrogen consumption of Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al (about 0.058 mmol H2/g cat), in the low temperature range (from 190 to 580 °C), is much lower than that of Pt-Sn/Al (about 0.084 mmol H2/g cat). These results could mean that the presence of CeO2 inhibits the reduction of SnO2, which is consistent with former analysis results that CeO2 can promote the reduction of platinum-oxide species. According to previous studies that if SnO2 is reduced to metal Sn and forms PtSn alloy, the activity of Pt will decrease [11], [12]. Therefore, over Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst, the reduction hindrance of SnO2 may help to maintain the activity of Pt.
The TPR profiles of Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalysts with different cerium loading are shown in Fig. 8(B-g–i). It is seen that the position of the TPR peaks depends on the amount of CeO2 and therefore on the type and strength of the interactions between supported Pt-oxide species, promoters and support. It becomes very difficult to resolve the profiles of those complicated systems. With the increase of cerium loadings, the maximum reduction peak for Pt oxide species shifts to lower temperatures. The intensity of this peak also increases with the increase of cerium concentration.
The TPR results show that addition of Ce to Pt-Sn/Al catalysts results in the strong surface interactions which affect the surface reducibility. Although, it is very difficult to correctly analyze the reducibility of each component of the complicated Pt-Sn/Ce-Al system, the strong surface interactions could increase the ability of Pt particles to resist agglomeration. Therefore, the high stability of Pt-Sn/Ce-Al was maintained at elevated temperature and regeneration conditions.
3.5.5. CO adsorption analysis
The interactions between platinum sites and promoters should change the electronic environment of the surfaces of Pt atoms. The electronic state of the surface of platinum atoms was characterized by CO probe molecules via adsorption. The IR spectra of CO chemisorbed on the Pt-supported catalysts are shown in Fig. 9. According to some observations in literature [38], [39], the bands in the frequency region of 2100–1950 cm−1 can be related to CO linearly bonded to one surface-exposed metal Pt atom. The infrared spectra for all Pt-supported catalysts show a main peak in the range of 2074–2060 cm−1. From Fig. 9, it is clear that addition of Sn results in a shift of +13 cm−1 compared to Pt/Al (from 2060 to 2073 cm−1). This result is in agreement with IR results already published [40]. A similar trend is observed for the Pt/1.1Ce-Al catalyst. That wave numbers shifted to a higher frequency due to addition of Ce to Pt/Al was also reported by other authors [41]. The highest frequency of 2074 cm−1 is observed for the Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst.

The modification of the main band can be caused by the changes of electronic environment and morphology of the surface of the platinum particles. There are different factors which influence the change in the electron density of platinum metal. According to the classic model of Blyholder [42] about the bonding of CO molecules to metal surfaces, in smaller platinum particles the average number of platinum bonds per platinum atom is lower than in larger particles. Therefore, a higher metal electron density is available for back-donation into the 2π orbital of CO molecules, leading to a decrease in the CO bond strength and a lowering of the CO adsorption frequency. This model was confirmed by other studies on a mono-Pt/Al2O3 sample [43]. Wave numbers shifting to a higher frequency can be interpreted as a decrease in electronic density of the platinum atoms. However, according the data of dispersion, the Pt particles over Pt-Sn/Al and Pt/1.1Ce-Al catalysts are smaller than those of the Pt/Al catalyst. The IR result is divergent because the electron density is higher for larger Pt particles (for Pt/Al) and the electron density is lower for smaller Pt particles (for Sn-Pt/Al). One reasonable explanation would be that the electronic environment of surface Pt atoms is affected not only by the size of Pt particles but also by the interactions between Pt and the promoters. The interactions between Pt and Ce oxides and/or Sn oxides lead to Pt atoms in a more unsaturated coordination state (Ptδ+). The lowest electron density of Pt atoms is observed over Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst, which is probably caused by electron transfer from Pt atoms to promoters. A change in the electronic properties of the Pt via electron withdrawal by the Sn(II) ions leading to the positively charged Pt, was also reported by other authors [44], [45], [46].
3.5.6. Coke analysis
Coke is one of the most important factors for the dehydrogenation performance of the catalyst. Coke over used catalysts was characterized by TPO and O2-pulse experiments. The typical TPO profiles for three coked catalysts are shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen that although three samples show mainly one peak of CO2, the temperature for each main peak is greatly different. The lowest temperature of 393 °C is observed over the Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst, which means that the deposited carbon is the most reactive over the Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst. The amount of coke on each catalyst is shown in Table 3. The highest amount of coke is observed over the Pt/1.1Ce-Al catalyst. It shows that addition of Ce to Pt/Al catalyst could not decrease the amount of coke, but the presence of Sn could suppress the reaction of coke, which is related to the above conclusions that the amount of strong acidity sites on Pt/1.1Ce-Al catalyst is higher than that on Pt-Sn/Al catalyst. The poor stability and selectivity of propylene over Pt/Al and Pt/1.1Ce-Al catalysts is related to the high amount of coke over those catalysts. Coke can physically block active sites, resulting in the loss of activity. The Pt-Sn/3.3Ce-Al catalyst shows the lowest amount of coke.

The amount of coke also depends on the cerium loading. Higher cerium loading tends to decrease carbon deposition. A similar result was reported by Wang and Lu [47]. It was reported that the high oxygen storage capacity of ceria, caused by the oxygen vacancies at the metal–oxide interface of reduced ceria can decrease the coke formation over the catalyst surface [48]. The high reactivity of coke over the Pt-Sn/3.3Ce-Al catalyst may be responsible for the low amount of coke. With the prolongation of reaction time, an increase of coke is observed. Over Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst, when reaction time reaches 50 h, the amount of coke increases to 50 mg C/g cat. The TPO and O2-pulse investigations imply that the presence of cerium over Pt-Sn/Al catalyst can increase the reactivity of coke and reduce the accumulation of coke.
3.5.7. H2-TPD analysis
The H2-TPD profiles of the fresh and recycled catalysts are shown in Fig. 11. Usually, low temperature desorption peaks are assigned to hydrogen on metallic Pt [49]. High temperature desorption peaks are assigned to spillover hydrogen [50], [51], strong chemisorbed hydrogen [52] and hydrogen in subsurface layers of the platinum [53]. It can be seen that, over the fresh samples, addition of Ce to Pt-Sn/Al catalyst can greatly promote its ability to adsorb hydrogen, especially in the high temperature range. After the fourth recycle reaction, the ability of metallic Pt in Pt-Sn/Al catalyst to adsorb hydrogen drastically decreases. The amounts of hydrogen on metallic Pt in the recycled Pt-Sn/Al catalyst are 22% of those in the fresh Pt-Sn/Al catalyst and 20% of those in the recycled Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al catalyst. On the Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al catalyst, the amounts of hydrogen on metallic Pt do not show obvious changes before and after the recycle reaction. The important reason for the decrease in amounts of hydrogen on metallic Pt is the sintering of Pt particles. It is obvious that Pt particles in the Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al catalyst are much more stable than those in the Pt-Sn/Al catalyst during recycle reactions. This indicates that the agglomeration of Pt particles on the Pt-Sn/Al catalyst is more serious than that on the Pt-Sn/2.2Ce-Al catalyst. The reason for the poor activity of the Pt-Sn/Al catalyst after the third cycle should be related to the low accessible metal surface area. Pt-ceria and Ce-alumina interactions could affect the degree of Pt sintering during calcination and reaction. Previous studies show that base-metal oxides additives such as CeO2 can increase the dispersion of a noble metal on Al2O3 and prevent the agglomeration of dispersed Pt into discrete particles [54]. This phenomenon has been attributed to a Pt–CeO2 interaction, which helps to maintain Pt in an oxidized state leading to more difficult to sinter than metallic Pt [55]. It has been postulated [34] that an interaction between Pt and cerium results in withdrawal of electrons from the noble metal similar to Rh on CeO2 [56], which are consistent with our IR results.

4. Conclusions
Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalysts, with cerium loadings in the range of 1.1–3.3 wt.%, exhibit a highly efficient performance for propane dehydrogenation to propylene. Over Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst, we could keep >38% of propane conversion, >98% propylene selectivity and >37% propylene yield over 50 h for the reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propylene at 576 °C. Furthermore, Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalysts display the remarkable stability in elevated temperature and regeneration conditions. BET and XRD measurements show that the presence of cerium could stabilize the texture of the support. TPR, CO adsorption and H2-TPD measurements further reveal that surface interactions take place over the Pt-Sn/1.1Ce-Al catalyst, which could stabilize Pt particles. The low amounts of coke and high thermal stability of Pt-Sn/Ce-Al catalysts are mainly responsible for the high stability of dehydrogenation.
