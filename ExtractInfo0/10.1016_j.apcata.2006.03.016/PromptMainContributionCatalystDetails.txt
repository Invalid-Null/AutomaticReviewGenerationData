The combination of propane partial oxidation and of WGS reaction in a single catalytic bed, and the self-adapting catalytic properties of vanadium oxide catalyst
Abstract
The gas-phase oxidation of propane catalyzed by unsupported vanadium oxide was studied under the reaction conditions that are usually employed for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. It was found that considerable amounts of H2 are produced above the temperature at which oxygen is totally consumed. Hydrogen formed in part by propane dehydrogenation to propylene and by coke formation, in part by the water–gas-shift reaction, in the fraction of catalytic bed that operated in the absence of gas-phase oxygen. V2O5 catalyzed the oxidation of propane to propylene, CO, CO2 and H2O in the first part of the bed, whereas reduced vanadium oxides (VO2, V2O3) formed in the anaerobic section of the reactor and catalyzed the reaction between CO and H2O to produce H2 and CO2. It was also found that the selectivity to oxygenates (acetic acid mainly) and to propylene at low temperature was affected by the vanadium oxide type: while V2O5 was poorly selective to these compounds, higher selectivity was reached with V2O3. The latter oxide was also more active than V2O5 in propane oxidation. The role of ionic oxygen in V2O5 was studied by feeding propane in the absence of gas-phase oxygen and following the non-steady catalytic performance along with the increasing time-on-stream. Fully oxidized vanadium oxide was very active but non-selective to propylene; the progressive reduction of V2O5 led to a decrease of conversion and to an increase of the selectivity to the olefin, due to the higher contribution of dehydrogenation with respect to oxidative dehydrogenation.
1. Introduction
Vanadium oxide is a key component in the preparation of catalysts for oxidation reactions [1], [2], [3], [4]. It is used either as a supported active phase, to increase its surface area, or in combination with other ions to form mixed oxides, in order to obtain a system with modified and enhanced oxo-reductive properties. Bulk vanadium oxide is known to possess a reservoir of oxygen that becomes highly mobile when the oxide is in a partially reduced state. This mobile lattice oxygen is capable of selective oxidation, but at the high temperature normally used for alkanes activation it causes over-oxidation, mainly to CO and H2O [5], [6], [7].
In the case of alkanes oxidation, catalysts based on supported vanadium oxide are often studied for the synthesis of light olefins by means of oxidehydrogenation (ODH) [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. The selectivity achieved is generally low, and therefore it is necessary to implement the catalytic properties either through the addition of dopants, or through the formation of mixed oxides. It is believed that the reaction mechanism includes the dehydrogenation of alkanes with co-production of water (ODH), while no attention is usually given to the formation of H2. Indeed, in most cases ODH is carried out using O2 as the limiting reactant, since hydrocarbon-rich conditions lead to a better selectivity to the olefin. This implies that total conversion of oxygen is reached, especially when temperatures higher than 500 °C are used. Under these conditions, a relevant contribution of catalytic dehydrogenation to the alkene and H2 formation cannot be excluded. Recent papers confirm that considerable amounts of H2 are produced with vanadium oxide-based catalysts, under conditions typically employed for propane ODH [13], [14], [15], [16], [17].
In the present work, we report about the investigation on catalytic properties of bulk, unsupported vanadium oxide in the oxidation of propane, with the aim of finding the conditions that lead either to the formation of chemicals (propylene and oxygenates), or to the formation of COx, with co-production of H2O or H2.
2. Experimental
Commercial vanadium pentoxide was supplied by Aldrich (>99.6%). Catalytic tests were carried out in a quartz, fixed-bed reactor loading 1.8 cm3 of catalyst in powder form (30/40 mesh particles), at atmospheric pressure. Catalytic tests of propane oxidation under co-feed conditions were carried out by feeding a mixture containing 20% propane, 20% oxygen, remainder He. Catalytic tests under redox-decoupling conditions were made by feeding 20% propane in He and following the catalytic performance along with the increasing reaction time. Gas residence time was equal to 2 s. Catalytic tests of WGS were carried out by feeding a mixture containing 9% H2O, 9% CO, remainder N2.
Products of propane oxidation were carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, light hydrocarbons (ethane, ethylene, methane), oxygenates (acetic acid, acrolein, acetaldehyde, acrylic acid, propionaldehyde, acetone, propionic acid), water (not analysed), molecular hydrogen and propylene. The effluents were analysed by a gas chromatograph equipped with three packed columns: (i) Carbosieve G (TCD) for the analysis of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide; (ii) fused silica Al2O3/KCl (FID) for the analysis of methane, ethane, ethylene, propylene and propane; (iii) Econopak/EC-Wax (FID) for the oxygenated compounds.
The catalyst was characterized before and after reaction by X-ray diffraction (Phillips PW 1050/81, radiation Cu Kα). The amount of residual C content in samples was determined by combustion in pure oxygen at 1300 °C, with detection of the CO2 formed by infrared analysis (instrument ELTRA 900CS).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The oxidation of propane over V2O5: the effect of temperature
Results of catalytic tests carried out with V2O5 are plotted in Fig. 1, as functions of the reaction temperature. Propane and oxygen conversions are reported in Fig. 1 (top), while the selectivity to each product (propylene, oxygenates, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide), and the H2 molar percentage in the outlet flow, are shown in Fig. 1 (bottom). It is worth saying that at 550 °C, with the empty reactor, propane conversion was lower than 3%, with selectivity to propylene around 50%; the by-products were lighter hydrocarbons (methane, ethane and ethylene).

Fig. 1 shows that two temperature zones can be identified: (i) below 400 °C and (ii) above 400 °C, each one with a different distribution of the products. In the range between 250 and 400 °C, propane and oxygen conversions increased when the temperature was raised; at 400 °C, oxygen attained total conversion. The products were propylene, CO and CO2, with minor amounts of oxygenates. Selectivity to propylene decreased from 20% at 275 °C to 6% at 400 °C; the selectivity to CO and CO2 correspondingly increased. The carbon atomic balance (calculated as the ratio between the sum of yields to C-containing products and the conversion of propane) was around 70–85% at 275–350 °C. This was likely due to the low conversions achieved, which made the errors in products quantification more relevant; however, the formation of other undetected products cannot be excluded. Thereafter, C balance improved, reaching values higher than 95% at 400 °C. The analysis of sample downloaded after reaction in this temperature range indicated that no coke had been accumulating on the catalyst.
Therefore, in the range of temperature comprised between 275 and 400 °C the catalytic behavior was that typical of an oxidation catalyst. The main reactions occurring in this temperature range were the following:
Above 400 °C, oxygen was totally consumed. In between 400 and 450 °C, propane conversion was constant; then, it progressively increased up to 50% at 550 °C, while C balance decreased from 95 to 75–80%. Propylene selectivity slightly increased, but never reached values higher than 12%. In this interval, hydrogen was produced in non-negligible amount; at 550 °C, it reached a concentration of 9.1% in the outlet stream. Selectivity to CO reached a maximum at 400 °C, and then decreased, while the formation of CO2 increased when the temperature was raised up to 500 °C, notwithstanding total oxygen conversion. In this temperature range, also minor amounts of aromatics (mainly toluene), heavy (e.g., dimethylheptane) and light (methane, ethane and ethylene) hydrocarbons formed, with a maximum selectivity close to 8–10% above 500 °C.
For the identification of the reactions giving rise to hydrogen formation above 400 °C, a balance between the amount of each product must be considered. In our conditions, part of hydrogen was produced by dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (in fact, the conversion of propane increased even after total oxygen conversion had been reached), and by coke formation (an accumulation of coke on catalyst explains the decrease in C balance above 400 °C):
The amount of coke accumulated on the catalyst was equal to 0.65 wt.% C, as inferred from the analysis of the sample downloaded after reaction at 550 °C. The accumulation of coke on catalyst was responsible for an initial unsteady catalytic performance at temperatures higher than 450 °C. Data reported in Fig. 1 were taken, at each temperature, after approximately 1 h time-on-stream, but the performance was not yet stable at that time; in fact, the C balance indicated that the catalyst was still accumulating coke.
Nevertheless, the amount of hydrogen obtained was higher than that expected on the basis of propane dehydrogenation and coke formation only. Other contributions to hydrogen formation may derive from:

However, these reactions should all lead to an increase of CO formation, while on the contrary the selectivity to CO decreased when the temperature was increased. The only reaction that can justify the additional amount of hydrogen formed and, at the same time, the opposite trends of CO and CO2, is WGS:
For instance, if we consider the variation of yield between 400 and 500 °C for the formation of coke, propylene and CO2, and assume that in this interval of temperature these compounds are formed by reactions that co-produce H2, an overall increase of H2 molar concentration equal to 6.0% would be expected, which well corresponds to the experimental one (
 = 5.4%). The disproportion of CO to C and CO2 could explain the decrease of CO and the contemporaneous increase of coke and CO2 formation; in this case, however, the formation of H2 would not be fully justified.
Vanadium oxide was characterized by X-ray diffraction after catalytic tests made at different temperatures: (i) at 370 °C, that is, at yet not complete oxygen conversion; (ii) at 400 °C, when total oxygen conversion was reached; and (iii) at 550 °C, the highest reaction temperature. Corresponding XRD patterns of samples are shown in Fig. 2, compared with that of the fresh catalyst. The diffraction patterns of the fresh sample and of the catalyst after reaction at 370 °C were identical, corresponding to that one of V2O5. After reaction at 400 °C, instead, the presence of vanadium oxides in different oxidation states (namely V2O5, VO2, V2O3, with also possible traces of V6O13 and V4O7) was observed. Finally, after reaction at 550 °C, the reflections typical of V2O5 were no longer present, and the only crystalline compounds were VO2 and V2O3.

The formation of reduced vanadium oxides was a consequence of the development of a reductive environment that occurred at high temperature after total oxygen conversion had been attained. This implies that the catalyst contained in the part of the bed that operated under anaerobic conditions was different from that one which worked in the presence of gas-phase oxygen, and that the relative amount of these two fractions was a function of reaction conditions, i.e., feed composition and temperature. This may also have implications on catalytic performance, since the modification of the catalyst characteristics may favour reactions different from those occurring in the initial part of the bed. It is possible that while V2O5 was able to oxidize propane to propylene, CO, CO2 and H2O, the reduced vanadium oxide dehydrogenated propane to propylene, formed coke and catalyzed WGS, with the co-production of H2. Both reactants for WGS, i.e., CO and H2O, were produced in the first part of the catalytic bed, in the presence of O2.
If this hypothesis is correct, the WGS reaction requires a substantially oxygen-free environment, otherwise vanadium oxide is in its oxidized form. This implies that oxygen has to be fed in a sub-stoichiometric amount with respect to that required for the partial combustion of the hydrocarbon itself to CO and H2O. The propane/O2 stoichiometric ratio for CO/H2O production is equal to 1/3.5; however, this ratio is flammable (unless very diluted systems are used). A molar ratio 1/1 (like the one employed in tests of Fig. 1) was out of the flammability area, and O2 was the limiting reactant. The consequence of this is that the maximum propane conversion achieved was low. On the other hand, the presence of unconverted hydrocarbon under anaerobic conditions generated the reducing environment that was necessary for the in situ formation of the reduced vanadium oxide.
3.2. The oxidation of propane over V2O5: the effect of residence time
Tests were carried out with variation of the residence time, at 430 °C, in order to confirm the existence of a complex reaction network. Feed composition was the same as for tests reported in Fig. 1; results are reported in Fig. 3.

The total conversion of oxygen, under these conditions, was obtained already at residence time 0.6 s. At low residence time, and very low conversion, the selectivity to propylene was close to 30%, but then rapidly decreased for increasing values of propane conversion, due to the consecutive reactions of CO and CO2 formation. Therefore, the latter were secondary products; however, the experimental trend also suggests possibly direct contributions to COx formation, deriving from propane combustion.
The formation of hydrogen became relevant in correspondence of total oxygen conversion; therefore, the effect was analogous to that one observed in the case of tests done with variation of temperature (Fig. 1). Two possible interpretations can be argued: either (i) the formation of H2 was consecutive to the formation of other products and/or (ii) a change in the nature of the active phase, under conditions of total oxygen conversion, rendered the catalyst active in those reactions that led to the generation of H2. Another important effect was that, despite the lack of molecular oxygen, the selectivity to CO showed a maximum, while that to CO2 progressively increased for increasing residence times. This phenomenon confirms the existence of a consecutive reaction upon CO, which became relevant for residence times higher than 1.5 s.
Also in this case, the catalyst was downloaded after reaction under different conditions, and characterized by XRD; Fig. 4 reports the corresponding patterns. It is confirmed that the nature of the vanadium oxide was a function of the gas-phase composition. The catalyst that had been operating with shorter residence times still showed the pattern typical of V2O5, while for increasing residence time and oxygen conversion, the formation of reduced vanadium oxides became evident. For a residence time of 2 s, the downloaded catalyst did no longer hold V2O5 at all; this suggests that in this case the great majority of the catalytic bed worked under anaerobic conditions.

3.3. The activity of V2O3 in the WGS reaction
In order to investigate the catalytic properties of the different vanadium oxides that developed inside the catalytic bed, as a consequence of the total consumption of oxygen, tests were carried out by feeding a gaseous mixture containing 9% H2O, 9% CO and 82% N2. Specifically, the reaction was first carried out with V2O5 (test a); then, the reaction of propane oxidation was carried out under conditions that led to total oxygen conversion (T 550 °C, feed 20% propane and 20% oxygen), in order to develop reduced vanadium oxides, and finally the CO/H2O/N2 mixture was fed on the pre-reduced catalyst (test b, shown in Fig. 5). The nature of the vanadium oxide used for each run was then confirmed by XRD characterization of catalysts downloaded after catalytic tests. In the case of test (a), the catalyst was still V2O5, while in the case of test (b) the compound present was V2O3.

With V2O5 (test a), the conversion of CO at 450 °C was 2–3%, with total selectivity to CO2 and no formation of H2; this indicates that V2O5 had very low activity in the WGSR. On the contrary, data of Fig. 5 show that V2O3 was active in this reaction; the conversion of CO was equal to 32–35%, with total selectivity to CO2 and a molar concentration of H2 equal to 2.7% that corresponds to a H2 yield of 30%. The performance was substantially constant during the elapsing time-on-stream.
These data confirm that the catalytic behavior illustrated in Fig. 1, Fig. 3 derived from the development of reduced vanadium oxides in the fraction of catalytic bed operating under anaerobic conditions. Therefore, WGS was a consecutive reaction, as also suggested by data obtained by variation of residence time (Fig. 3), since it did occur on CO and H2O. H2O was co-produced, together with CO and CO2, by both direct and consecutive reactions in the fraction of bed operating in the presence of oxygen.
The catalytic performance of V2O3 in the WGSR is shown in Fig. 6 as a function of temperature; the reaction approached equilibrium only at temperature higher than 500 °C, while under conditions more favourable from a thermodynamic point of view the catalyst had poor activity.

The formation of H2 with V oxide-based catalysts under conditions typically employed for alkanes ODH has also been mentioned by other authors. For instance, it was found that when running ethane ODH, Mo19V5Nb1Ox and V5Nb1Ox were active to a certain extent in the WGS reaction at 440–500 °C [18]. Sinev et al. [13] considered non-oxidative dehydrogenation and coking as the most important hydrogen formation pathways in propane oxidation. Moreover, it was supposed that other reactions were involved, generally indicated as free-radical oxidations; however, due to the lack of data reporting CO and CO2 separately, it is difficult to understand if WGS occurred at all. Burch and Crabb [19] have shown that over unsupported vanadium oxide at 500 °C, the CO/CO2 ratio decreased with the increase of propane/oxygen ratio, as a consequence of a constant selectivity to CO2 and a decreasing selectivity to CO; contributions of specific reactions other than combustion were not reported, but are likely. In a recent paper, Millet and co-workers [20] showed that the doping of iron oxide with V considerably enhanced the catalyst activity in WGS; a promotion effect of V4+ and V3+ ions on iron oxide was hypothesized, but a direct role of these ions on catalytic performance should not be excluded.
The addition of oxygen to reformers or WGS reactors has also been claimed as a tool to increment the hydrogen concentration obtained by transformation of hydrocarbons in a single catalytic bed [21], [22]. Specifically, patents claim the use of supported Rh catalysts for the catalytic generation of H2 by the self-sustaining combination of partial oxidation and steam reforming of hydrocarbons. The heat generated in the first part of the bed sustains the reforming reaction. Supported Rh is also claimed as the catalyst in an oxygen-assisted WGS reactor, in which the addition of oxygen causes an improvement of CO removal by oxidation to CO2. These approaches are, however, clearly different from that one described in the present work.
3.4. The activity of V2O3 in propane oxidation
Results of Fig. 1, Fig. 3 indicate that bulk vanadium oxide is not a selective catalyst for propane ODH. At low temperature, that is under conditions at which oxygen was not totally converted, the selectivity to propylene was lower than 20%. This was due to the low intrinsic selectivity of V2O5 (the active compound under these conditions, see Fig. 2), rather than to the contribution of consecutive combustion reactions, since propane conversion achieved was low. At 430 °C, the selectivity to propylene was good only for low propane conversion, but as soon as the latter increased, the selectivity fell down (Fig. 3).
The characterization of catalysts downloaded after reaction (Fig. 2) evidenced that the permanence of V2O5 at temperatures higher than 400 °C and under a reducing atmosphere leads to the formation of VO2 and V2O3. The latter compounds were not re-oxidized by treatment in the oxygen-containing reactive atmosphere, when temperatures lower than 400 °C and reaction times of a few hours were used. This is shown in Fig. 7, that reports the XRD patterns of downloaded samples, when first were used as catalysts under conditions that caused the preservation of V2O5 (T 350 °C, sample 1) or the development of either VO2 (T 450 °C, sample 2) or of V2O3 (T 550 °C, sample 3), and then were tested in propane oxidation at temperatures lower than 400 °C, that is under conditions at which oxygen conversion was not total. It is shown that samples 2 and 3 were still reduced. This also implies that we should expect, in the same temperature range, a catalytic behavior that is different from that one of V2O5.

Fig. 8 reports the results of catalytic tests done with sample 3, in the entire range of temperature investigated. Surprisingly, V2O3 was more active than V2O5. In fact, the curves relative to propane and O2 conversion were shifted towards lower temperature with respect to corresponding curves obtained with V2O5 (Fig. 1), and total oxygen conversion was reached already at 325 °C. Since V2O3 is a hardly reducible compound, the high conversion achieved must be related to its ability in the activation of molecular oxygen, with generation of adsorbed species particularly active in propane oxidation. Even though the formation of an oxidized layer over bulk V2O3 under reaction conditions is not excluded, nevertheless the performance of the sample was clearly different from that one of bulk V2O5. Moreover, the coke formed on catalyst surface during the high-temperature pre-treatment might also play a role in the reaction.

For what concerns the selectivity to products, H2 began to form at 400 °C, that is, well beyond the temperature at which total O2 conversion was reached. This indicates that below 400 °C reactions giving rise to H2 production were not yet kinetically relevant, and that propylene was produced by ODH only in the fraction of bed that operated in the presence of gaseous oxygen.
However, the most relevant difference between V2O5 and V2O3 concerned the distribution of products at temperature lower than 350 °C. The selectivity to propylene was higher with V2O3 than with V2O5; moreover, while the latter gave very low amounts of oxygenates (comparable quantities of acetic acid, acetone, acrolein and acrylic acid), with V2O3 the selectivity to oxygenates was close to 30% in the 250–300 °C temperature range, and then declined when the temperature was raised. The predominant compound was acetic acid, which contributed to more than 80% to the oxygenates selectivity.
At temperatures higher than 400 °C, V2O5 (Fig. 1) and V2O3 (Fig. 8) had similar performance, as a consequence of the transformation of the former into the latter in the absence of molecular oxygen.
The data obtained indicate that the oxidation level of vanadium oxide is of great importance in determining the catalytic performance. One of the most important factors in the control of selectivity in the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, and in alkanes ODH as well, is the surface concentration of oxidizing sites [2], [23], [24], [25]. This has been described in the “Site Isolation” concept [23], which relates the selectivity to partially oxidized products with the surface density of sites: the most oxidized is the metal oxide, the most selective it is to products of combustion, while the opposite is true for reduced oxides and for the selectivity to the products of partial oxidation. Of course, too low oxidation levels are also detrimental for selectivity, since a proper concentration of oxidizing sites is nevertheless necessary to obtain the desired product.
In our case, however, it is more likely that the different catalytic performance derived from different reaction mechanisms and types of active oxygen species involved. While V2O5 uses bulk O2− to form water from H-abstraction, with V2O3 the generation of other types of adsorbed oxygen species is responsible for the higher activity, the better selectivity to propylene and the remarkable formation of acetic acid. In previous papers, the high selectivity to oxygenates was improperly attributed to the catalytic properties of V2O5, but was indeed due to the in-situ development of reduced vanadium oxides [26], [27], [28].
3.5. The activity of V2O5 in propane oxidation under redox-decoupling conditions
In order to investigate the role of bulk ionic oxygen on catalytic performance, we run the reaction of propane oxidation in the absence of molecular oxygen, at 550 °C. Starting from V2O5, the presence of the hydrocarbon implied the progressive removal of ionic oxygen, to produce O-containing compounds (i.e., CO, CO2, H2O), and hence the corresponding reduction of vanadium oxide. This also had the consequence of a progressive variation of catalytic performance, and of an unsteady performance along with the increasing time-on-stream. This operation in practice simulates the first reductive step in the Mars–van Krevelen redox mechanism [29]; due to this reason, such operation is often referred to as “cyclic” or “redox-decoupling” procedure, when the reductive step is alternated with the oxidizing one [15], [16], [17]. Tests were made at 550 °C, in order to operate under conditions at which those reactions responsible for H2 formation were kinetically relevant.
Fig. 9 plots the instantaneous propane conversion and the selectivity to the various products as functions of the reaction time. The catalyst was downloaded after the test, and characterized; the XRD pattern corresponded to that of V2O3, with minor amounts of V4O7; the amount of coke accumulated was equal to 0.15 wt.% C.

Temperature 550 °C, residence time 2 s, feed composition 20 mol% propane, balance He. Catalyst: V2O5. Symbols as in Fig. 1, except C atomic balance (+).
The following considerations can be done:
(1)
The progressive reduction of the catalyst from V2O5 to V2O3, due to the removal of ionic oxygen, led to a decrease of propane conversion. Therefore, in the absence of molecular oxygen the more reduced was the catalyst, the less active it was in propane conversion. This confirms that the higher activity shown by V2O3 under co-feed conditions (Fig. 8) was due to the generation of a very active adsorbed oxygen species.
(2)
The fully oxidized catalyst, that is the one present for shorter reaction times, was non-selective to propylene; fresh V2O5 exclusively yielded CO and CO2. The nil selectivity to propylene was due to the high conversion achieved, and hence to the important contribution of consecutive combustion reactions. It is worth noting that at 550 °C and under co-feed conditions, the same catalyst gave approximately 10% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1); in the latter case, however, the vanadium oxide was reduced, due to total oxygen conversion. Moreover, propylene was formed mainly by dehydrogenation, while under redox-decoupling conditions the fully oxidized catalyst released ionic oxygen to co-produce the olefin and water.
(3)
The progressive increase of catalyst reduction led to an increase of the selectivity to propylene, as a consequence of both the lower propane conversion, and of the increased contribution of propane dehydrogenation. In correspondence, the selectivity to carbon oxides lowered. The progressive decrease of C balance pointed out for a higher coke formation; on the most reduced catalyst (after 30 min reaction time), more than 50% of the propane converted was transformed to coke.
(4)
The concentration of H2 in the outlet stream increased, up to a value of 4 mol% after 10 min reaction time. In this case, the WGS reaction likely did not occur; in fact, water was obtained as the co-product only with the oxidized catalyst (that is, for short reaction times); the latter was non-active in the WGS reaction.
(5)
Results demonstrate that the bulk ionic oxygen in V2O5 is the species involved in propane oxidation, and in propylene, CO, CO2 and H2O formation. A progressive reduction of vanadium oxide, due to the continuous release of O2−, leads to a catalyst less active than V2O5.
4. Conclusions
Under the reaction conditions typically employed for propane ODH, vanadium oxide modifies its characteristics in function of the reaction conditions, and specifically of gas-phase composition and temperature. This makes the vanadium oxide stoichiometry to change along the catalytic fixed-bed, from V2O5 in the aerobic section of the reactor, to reduced vanadium oxide (V2O4 and V2O3) in the fraction of bed that operates in the absence of molecular oxygen. This corresponds to a change of the type of reactions occurring inside the reactor. In the first part of the catalytic bed, propane is oxidized to propylene, CO, CO2 and H2O, with minor formation of oxygenates. In the reducing section, instead, propane is dehydrogenated to propylene and to aromatics/coke; however, one important contribution to H2 generation also derives from WGS, which is efficiently catalyzed by V2O3. Therefore, these self-adapting properties of vanadium oxide make possible to combine the formation of CO and H2O with the WGS reaction, and to obtain H2 and CO2 as the main products. Other products are however present in the exit stream, including CO (not completely transformed, due to the unfavourable thermodynamics for WGS), and propylene, that is a product of propane ODH and/or dehydrogenation.
The activity and the distribution of products in the presence of gas-phase oxygen are functions of the oxidation level of vanadium oxide. V2O3 is much more active, more selective to acetic acid and slightly more selective to the olefin than V2O5. This is attributed to the generation of adsorbed oxygen species on the surface of V2O3, responsible for the activation of the alkane and its transformation to oxidation products. Bulk ionic oxygen in V2O5 is instead involved in the redox mechanism of propane oxidation.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
