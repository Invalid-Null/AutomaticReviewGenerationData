Zeolite-encaged Ultrasmall Pt-Zn Species with Trace Amount of Pt for Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation
Propane dehydrogenation(PDH) has become a globe-welcoming technology to meet the massive demand for propylene, but the most commonly used Pt-based catalysts suffer from quick sintering, poor selectivity for propylene, and unsatisfied Pt utilization. Herein, a series of Silicalite-1(S-1) zeolite-encaged ultrasmall Pt-Zn clusters with a trace amount of Pt[40–180 ppm(parts per million)] were developed by using a one-pot ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method. Interestingly, the extremely low amount of Pt can significantly promote the activity of zeolite-encaged Zn catalysts in PDH reactions. Thanks to the high Pt dispersion, the synergy between Pt and Zn species, and the confinement effect of zeolites, the optimized PtZn@S-1 catalyst with 180 ppm Pt and 1.88%(mass fraction) Zn, exhibited an extraordinarily high propane conversion(33.9%) and propylene selectivity(99.5%) at 550 °C with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 8 h−1, affording an extremely high propylene formation rate of \(340.7\,{\rm{mo}}{{\rm{l}}_{{{\rm{C}}_3}{{\rm{H}}_6}}} \cdot {g_{{\rm{Pt}}}}^{ - 1} \cdot {{\rm{h}}^{ - 1}}\). This work provides a reference for the preparation of zeolite-encaged metal catalysts with high activity and noble metal utilization in PDH reactions.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
