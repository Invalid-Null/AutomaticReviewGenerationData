Abstract
This study investigated the effects of Zn and Fe metal oxide species as promoters on NiO-Bi2O3/γ-Al2O3 in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane to produce butadiene. Ni-Bi-O, Ni-Zn-Bi-O, Ni-Fe-Bi-O, and Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi-O catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated in a packed bed flow reactor at different temperatures and O2/n-butane molar ratios. Substituting 50 wt.% of Ni with one or both promoters were found to enhance both the butadiene selectivity. Among the synthesized catalysts, Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi-O/γ-Al2O3 (10 wt.% Ni-5 wt.% Zn-5 wt.% Fe-30 wt.% Bi) showed the highest butadiene selectivity of 49.0% with 18.6% n-butane conversion at 450 °C and a molar feed ratio of O2/n-butane = 2.0. This enhanced performance was attributed to the synergetic effects of Ni, which simultaneously improved the first-step dehydrogenation selectivity via a promotion with Zn and the second-step dehydrogenation selectivity by the incorporation of Fe. Moreover, Zn allowed the surface reduction to occur at lower temperatures, while Fe balanced the densities of strong basic sites with weak and moderate acid sites (0.183 mmol CO2/g-cat and 0.188 mmol NH3/g-cat, respectively). The aforementioned results were confirmed with CO2/NH3 temperature-programmed desorption and H2 temperature-programmed reduction experiments. Under this reaction condition, the catalyst maintains good stability over 15 h of time-on-stream.

1. Introduction
The rapid growth in automotive manufacturing, which uses butadiene rubbers in tires, is mainly responsible for the ever-increasing global demand for butadiene [1]. Butadiene is an essential petrochemical di-olefin for the production of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polybutadiene rubber, and styrene-butadiene rubber. All these butadiene-based materials are extensively employed in the synthetic rubber industry [2]. Conventionally, butadiene and other C4 olefins are obtained as by-products of naphtha steam cracking processes, which mainly produce ethylene and propylene. However, the current supply of butadiene from ethylene/propylene plants is insufficient to meet the increasing global demand. Thus, there is an urgent need to obtain butadiene from lighter feedstocks such as n-butane (natural gas liquids, liquefied petroleum gas, etc.) [3]. The abstraction of two hydrogen molecules from n-butane in two steps gives butadiene. Unfortunately, this dehydrogenation of n-butane is an equilibrium-limited endothermic reaction that requires considerable energy input to achieve appreciable n-butane conversion and butadiene/butene selectivity [4].
In this regard, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is a promising alternative because it involves the exothermic partial oxidation of n-butane to produce butadiene/butene and water. The formation of water molecules also helps overcome thermodynamic limitations compared to the classical dehydrogenation processes. The presence of oxygen and the formation of water further suppress catalyst deactivation [5,6]. Therefore, efficient catalysts could allow the large-scale production of butadiene through n-butane ODH with lower energy requirements compared to existing processes.
According to the literature, the performance of ODH catalysts is mainly affected by the following factors: (i) the nature of the support [7], (ii) moderate acidic-basic surface characteristics [8], (iii) redox properties [9], (iv) dispersion of the active metal oxide [10], (v) type of lattice oxygen species [11], (vi) metal-support interactions [12], (vii) method used for catalyst synthesis [13] and (viii) type of oxidant in ODH [14]. Many supported and unsupported catalysts have been investigated to achieve the desirable properties [15], [16], [17]. The commonly studied ones are VOx/Ce‑meso-Al2O3 [18], Mg3V2O8/(MgO, SiO2, MgO–SiO2) [8], V2O5/MO-Al2O3 (M = Mg, Ca, Ba, Sr) [19], VOx/(CeO2–ZrO2, TiO2–ZrO2) [20], VOx/ZrO2/SiO2 [9], V/Ti-SBA-15 [21], V-MCM-41 [10], MO-TiO2 (M = Cr, V, Mn) [11], and Mo-V-MgO [22].
In most of these catalytic structures, vanadium is the active metal because of its favorable properties for dehydrogenation reactions. Efforts have also been made in a majority of cases to balance the acidity-basicity and enhance the formation of desirable amorphous vanadium phases, because both factors favor olefins selectivity [23]. However, despite their success in the ODH of ethane and propane, vanadium-based (V-based) catalysts still face challenges in maximizing the selectivity of 1,3-butadiene over other C4 olefins [8,9,11]. The V-based catalysts also suffer from low n-butane conversions (∼10%) at lower reaction temperatures (<500 °C), even though lower temperatures are desirable for minimizing thermal cracking of the butene intermediate. Moreover, there are no clear definitions for the selectivity of V-based catalysts in the 1st dehydrogenation step (n-butane to butene isomers), the 2nd dehydrogenation step (butene to butadiene), and the combination of both steps.
To address the challenges faced by V-based catalysts, our research group had investigated Ni-based supported catalysts for the ODH of n-butane. The Ni-based catalysts demonstrated high n-butane conversions, although the butadiene selectivity was low owing to the oxidation of butene. Partial replacement of Ni with Bi improved the butadiene selectivity over a Ni-Bi-O/γ-Al2O3 catalyst [24]. In addition to the promotional effects of Bi, the catalyst synthesis and pre-treatment steps also affect the butadiene selectivity. For example, a two-step calcination process (from room temperature to 350 °C and then to 590 °C) is critical for controlling the formation of β-Bi2O3 over α-Bi2O3 phases, which enhances the selectivity towards butadiene [25]. To investigate the effects of the support, Bi-Ni oxides were also dispersed over various supports including TiC, SiC, and zeolites. The Bi-Ni-O/TiC catalyst exhibited relatively higher butadiene selectivity, owing to the synergetic effects of reducibility and strong basic sites [26].
Another attractive strategy to improve the ODH of n-butane is modifying bimetallic Ni-Bi by partially substituting Ni with Co and Fe oxides. The Ni-Co-containing catalysts displayed good n-butane conversion, but they were not selective towards butadiene because of the complete oxidation of butanes to COx. On the other hand, the combination of Ni-Fe led to both good n-butane conversion and relatively higher butadiene selectivity, indicating that Fe minimizes the oxidation of butene and therefore enhances the 2nd step dehydrogenation to produce more butadiene [27].
Recent studies on enhancing the oxygen mobility in high-efficiency Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalysts via promotion with V, Cr, Cu, Mn, Co, Ni, and Zn have been applied towards the ODH of 1-butene to butadiene [28]. A relationship was established between the catalyst activity and oxygen mobility. It was concluded that the reaction requires the Lewis acid sites of γ-Al2O3, the α-Fe2O3 phase activates O2, and the primary role of the ZnFe2O4 phase is activating butene. Hence, the biphasic catalyst of α-Fe2O3 and ZnFe2O4 showed improved overall catalytic performance [29], [30], [31]. This outcome indicates that more research is required, especially in improving butadiene selectivity in the 2nd ODH step.
Here, we investigated how substituting Fe, Zn, and Fe-Zn promoters affects the catalytic activity and selectivity of a Ni-Bi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for the direct oxidative conversion of n-butane to 1,3-butadiene. Zn-Bi, Fe-Bi, Ni-Zn-Bi, Ni-Fe-Bi, and Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 were prepared and characterized by XRD, BET, SEM-EDX, HR-TEM, ICP-OES, H2-TPR, and NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD. The obtained physical and chemical characteristics were correlated with the catalytic performance, and the catalysts were finally evaluated in a packed bed reactor.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Mesoporous γ-Al2O3 (obtained from the Catalysis Society of Japan) was used as a support after calcination at 550 °C for 5 h. The specific surface area of the calcined support was 241 m2/g, with a pore volume of 0.72 cm3/g and an average pore diameter of 8.15 nm. The precursors of Ni, Bi, Zn, and Fe were, respectively nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni (NO3)2·6H2O; 99%, Fisher Scientific), bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi (NO3)3·5H2O; 98%, Fluka Garantie), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O; 98%, Sigma Aldrich), and ferric nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O; 99%, Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc.). All chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used without additional purification.
The supported catalysts were prepared using the co-impregnation technique to ensure consistency. Fig. 1 shows the main steps used to prepare the Ni-doped Bi-O/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, in which the loadings of Ni and Bi were 10 and 30 g/g, respectively. To synthesize the multicomponent catalysts, required amounts of the metal oxide precursors were dissolved in 80 ml of deionized water in a conical flask with fixed amount of 0.696 g of the bismuth precursor followed by stirring for 30 min at room temperature. A homogeneous mixture was produced by adding 1.0 g of the γ-Al2O3 support and stirring for 3 h at 55 °C. The slurry was then kept overnight at room temperature for the deposition of active metals. Afterwards, the flask containing the sample was placed on a hotplate at 55 °C to evaporate the water. To remove any remaining moisture, the sample was placed in an oven at 120 °C for 3 h. The dried sample was calcined in two steps. First, it was heated from room temperature to 350 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and held for 1 h. Then, the temperature was raised again at a rate of 15 °C/min to 590 °C and held for 2 h. This two-step calcination approach help stabilize the β-Bi2O3 phase, which is believed to be selective for butadiene formation [25].

2.2. Catalyst characterization
To understand the effects of different promoters on the unmodified Ni-Bi catalyst, physical and chemical properties of various synthesized catalysts were determined using various techniques. The surface morphology and elemental composition were determined using field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (FESEM-EDX, Tescan Mira 3 LMU). The scanning speed was adjusted from 20 ns to 10 ms per pixel, and the accelerating voltage was maintained between 50 V and 30 kV. HR-TEM (JEM-2100 F model) was used to investigate the internal morphologies of metal oxide crystals. The applied acceleration voltage was 200 kV. Bulk elemental compositions of the doped catalysts (wt.% of Zn, Fe, Ni, and Bi) were measured using ICP-OES (Ultima 2, HORIBA Scientific).
The specific surface area and pore structure of the support and supported catalysts were determined by N2 adsorption-desorption analysis (Micromeritics equipment ASAP 2020, Norcross GA). Before analysis, 0.05 g of calcined sample was degassed at 240 °C for 3 h under He flow to remove any adsorbed species from the sample. The BET method was used to calculate the total specific surface area, t-plot method with Harkins and Jura model was used to calculate the microporous surface area, while the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) technique was used to measure the pore volume, and average pore diameter. Crystalline phases of the catalysts were detected via powder XRD (Rigaku Mini Flex II) at the operating parameters of 30 kV and 15 mA with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The measurements were recorded within 2θ = 5–90° at a speed of 2°/min and a step size of 0.02° The obtained diffraction patterns were analyzed using the JCPDS file package to identify the phases.
Basicity and acidity characteristics of the samples were, respectively analyzed using CO2-TPD and NH3-TPD, on a chemisorption apparatus built into a BELCAT-A-200 reactor system. The equipment consisted of a sample quartz holder fixed within a high-temperature furnace, and an attached mass spectrometer and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For analysis, 0.1 g of calcined catalyst sample was loaded and preheated at 500 °C for 1 h under He flow (50 ml/min). The system was then brought back to 100 °C while maintaining the He flow. Next, the sample was exposed to CO2 (for basicity) or NH3 (for acidity) by circulating a mixture of He/CO2 (0.95:0.05 v/v) or He/NH3 (0.95/0.05 v/v) for 30 min at 100 °C. After reaching adsorption saturation, the system was purged with He (50 ml/min) to remove any residual CO2 or NH3 in the gas phase. Finally, CO2 or NH3 desorption was carried out by heating the sample from 100 to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min, and the data were recorded with the TCD detector.
The H2-TPR experiments were conducted using the same BELCAT-A-200 reactor system. The reducibility of supported metal catalysts was measured by circulating a gas mixture containing 10% H2 (balanced Ar) at 50 ml/min. H2-TPR profiles were recorded with the TCD detector between 100 and 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Thermogravimetric (TG) and derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) analyses were used to characterize the spent catalyst after the catalytic test, using a Q600TA Instrument apparatus, under dry air, with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 800 °C.
2.3. Catalyst evaluation for oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane
All catalysts were evaluated for the ODH of n-butane to butadiene in a fixed bed flow reactor supplied by Microtrac Bel Company, Japan. It consists of a quartz tubular reactor fixed in a stainless-steel furnace and connected to a thermowell, as shown in Fig. 2. For the ODH experiments, freshly calcined catalyst (0.3 g) was trapped with quartz wool on both sides in the middle of the tube. In order to eliminate the impact of mass transfer limitations (if there is any) on n-butane conversion and product selectivity - all catalyst tests were conducted by using same total gas flow rate of 31.2 ml/min, same size range of catalyst particles and constant catalyst to n-butane ratio of 0.42 h·gcat/mol-C4.

Fig. 2. Schematic diagram of the fixed bed reactor used for n-butane ODH to butadiene.
The reactions were conducted at three different temperature temperatures (400, 450 and 500 °C). A thermocouple inserted in the thermowell was used to monitor the catalyst bed temperature. The reaction temperature was increased by ramping the heating of the reactor. Therefore, same catalysts sample was used to investigate the effects of reaction temperature. Before product analysis, the reactor was allowed to reached steady state condition (the variation of the reactor temperature was within ±2%).
The products were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (Agilent GC, 7890 N) equipped with a GC-Gas Pro-capillary column (i.d: 0.32 mm, length: 60 m) and flame ionization detector (FID) to identify the oxygenates and hydrocarbon products, while the permanent gasses O2, CO, CO2, H2, and N2 were analyzed using a TCD detector. The GC analyzed data was further process to calculate n-butane conversion, products selectivity and products yields – according to Eqs. (1) – (3). For each run, at least three (3) readings were taken to ensure the consistency of the experimental data points. The mass balance was done based on carbon balance, which was approximately 100% for all experiments.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physical and chemical characteristics
3.1.1. N2 adsorption isotherms
All catalysts showed type IV isotherms (Fig. 3), which was due to the formation of a monolayer followed by multilayer capillary condensation initiated at a relative pressure of approximately 0.60. This behavior indicates the mesoporous nature of the catalysts [18]. The H2-type hysteresis loops suggest a bottleneck-like shape of the mesopores [32]. Specific surface area (total) was calculated using the Brunauer‒Emmett‒Teller (BET) equation. Micropore surface area and micropore volume were obtained from the t-plot analysis by applying the Harkins and Jura thickness curve. More details on the BET (Fig. S1 and S2) and t-plot (Fig. S3) calculations are provided in the supplementary information (SI).

Table 2 summarizes the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm data for all catalysts. The specific surface areas (total surface areas) were calculated with the Brunauer‒Emmett‒Teller (BET) equation using the linear region of the isotherms (P/P○ = 0.05–0.3). The pore surface area, average pore diameter, and volume distribution were determined using the BJH method. The calcined γ-Al2O3 support had a BET surface area of 241 m2/g and an average mesopore size of 8.15 nm. After loading metals onto this support, the specific surface area decreased significantly as expected. The Ni-Bi catalyst showed a specific surface area of 133 m2/g and a reduced average pore size of 7.78 nm due to filling and blocking a large extent of the mesopores of alumina starting with those located at the lower end of the distribution without significantly altering its span as supported later in Table 3 [27]. Moreover, impregnation with 20 wt.% Ni enhanced the meso‑porosity by stabilizing the dispersed Bi species. This process created new mesopores in the space between agglomerated Ni-Bi crystals, resulting in a 5% reduction in the average pore diameter and a 50% reduction in surface area compared with the bare support. This agrees with the results by Jermy et al. [33,24]. Therefore, the pore volume of the γ-Al2O3 support decreased after impregnation with Ni and Bi.

After fully substituting Ni in the Ni-Bi catalyst with Zn or Fe, there was no significant change in the pore diameter, which remained similar to that of γ-Al2O3. However, impregnation of both Zn and Fe promoters in the Ni-Bi catalyst resulted in a significant reduction in pore size compared to catalysts containing only one promoter (Ni-Zn-Bi and Ni-Fe-Bi). A reduction in catalyst pore size due to the addition of iron species was also reported by Yan et al. [34].
Fig. 4 displays the pore size distributions in various catalysts calculated from the isotherm data. It is evident that compared to Ni-Zn-Bi and Ni-Fe-Bi, the simultaneous addition of Zn and Fe shifted the peak near 10 nm in Fig. 4(b) to a smaller size for the Ni-Fe-Zn-Bi catalyst, which supports the observation described above. To further uncover the effect of metal nanoparticle impregnation in the mesoporous region, the pore volume was divided into three regions according to the mesopore size, namely 2–5, 5–10, and 10–50 nm (Table 3).

It is evident that most of the dopant effects occurred in the smaller mesopores (2–5 nm) that made a large contribution to the pore volume. For example, compared to Zn-Bi, Ni-Zn-Bi showed a higher pore volume of 0.033 cm3/g in the range of 2–5 nm which is higher the support pore volume in the same mesoporous region. Moreover, after further adding Fe to Ni-Zn-Bi, there was an interesting change in the textural properties: the pore volume in the region of 5–10 nm was moderately reduced (from 0.204 to 0.142 cm3/g in Ni-Fe-Zn-Bi) due to coverage by the dispersed species, while that in the 2–5 nm region increased significantly instead (from 0.033 to 0.061 m2/g). Fig. 5 shows that the Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi catalyst has the largest mesoporous (2–5 nm) pore area, compared with other Ni-Bi-based catalysts without or with only one promoter (Zn or Fe).

3.1.2. XRD results
Fig. 6 presents the XRD patterns of calcined γ-Al2O3 support and various supported catalysts. All samples displayed a diffraction peak at 27.4° between the α-Bi2O3 and β-Bi2O3 phases [24], and therefore the 2θ range of 25–55° was selected for the XRD analysis. It has been reported that β-Bi2O3 is a metastable phase while α-Bi2O3 is the most thermodynamically stable phase [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. This heterojunction of α-/β-Bi2O3 is required for dehydrogenation reactions, because it creates a high oxygen mobility cycle in the bandgap interface layer between the two phases, which facilitates the adsorption and desorption of the reactants and products, respectively [40].

The diffraction pattern of calcined γ-Al2O3 support with primary peaks at 2θ = 37° and 46° [41] was maintained and distinguished in all the samples. The Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was reported to include both NiO and bulk NiAl2O4 particles at 2θ = 37°, 43°, 63°, 37°, 45°, and 59°, respectively [42]. Here, diffraction peaks at 37° and 43° for the Ni-Bi catalyst were attributed to the (111) and (200) interplanar planes of NiO, respectively, with a small portion of the bulk phase NiAl2O4 detected at 45.5° The Ni-Bi catalyst showed α- and β-Bi2O3 phases, with the respective characteristic peaks at 27.4° and 30.7° for the (120) and (002) planes [43]. For the Zn-Bi and Ni-Zn-Bi catalysts, the former (without Ni) showed minor peaks at 31° and 36.8° for ZnAl2O4, while the diffraction peaks of ZnO were absent in both catalysts due to the similar ionic radii of Ni2+ (0.69 Å) and Zn2+ (0.74 Å) [44]. The substitution of Zn2+ for Ni2+ did not cause any noticeable lattice distortion, so no shift was observed in their diffraction peaks. This could be due to the low coordination of the Zn geometry, which helps minimize the incorporation of Al3+ from γ-Al2O3 in the NiO lattice during nucleation, as proven experimentally and explained computationally in previous studies [45], [46], [47], [48].
The major XRD peaks of the α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (JCPDS #33-0664, hematite) are located at 2θ = 24.14°, 33.15°, 35.61°, 40.85°, 49.48°, 54.09°, and 62.45° and assigned to the (012), (104), (110), (113), (024), (116), and (214) planes, respectively [49]. In the calcined Fe-Bi catalyst, there was only a weak peak of α-Fe2O3 at 2θ = 54.09°, while no α-Fe2O3 peaks were found for either Ni-Fe-Bi or Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi due to the detection limit of the XRD equipment. Moreover, doping 5 wt.% α-Fe2O3 in Ni-Fe-Zn-Bi caused the disappearance of some low-intensity peaks of the β-Bi2O3 phase and the production of more amorphous agglomerated particles, due to the interaction of Ni and Fe species with the γ-Al2O3 support [50].
3.1.3. FESEM-EDX and ICP-OES analyses
To confirm the loadings of all the elements (Ni, Fe, Zn, Bi) in the calcined Ni-Bi and Ni-doped-Bi catalysts, ICP-OES and EDX analyses were used to quantify the bulk elemental compositions, respectively. Even though some crystallographic peaks of the prepared metallic oxides were missing from the XRD patterns (Fig. 6), Table 4 confirms that all elements used in the synthesis were incorporated into the prepared catalysts. Fig. 7 further reveals that the elements were well dispersed in the areas imaged by EDX. It is known that the energy dispersive X-ray is resolved in photon energy, and the detector signals can pass through a thin film of 1–3 μm. Therefore, elemental compositions measured using this analysis method are generally confirmed by the bulk compositions of the catalysts and is verified in Table 4.

The EDX results suggests that Ni not only works as the main active species in Ni-doped-Bi catalysts but also plays an important role in stabilizing the Bi species on the γ-Al2O3 support. Moreover, EDX analysis proves that the Ni-Zn-Bi crystals have the highest ratio of oxygen species in their lattices (48.1 wt.%), which can be utilized in the dehydrogenation reaction process.
High-magnification FESEM images were also acquired to show the morphology of prepared samples and observe the effects of Fe and Zn on the structural characteristics of promoted Ni-doped-Bi catalysts (Fig. 7(f)). SEM image of the Ni-Bi catalyst clearly shows clouds of crystal-like spherical particles with faces that might contain small crystalline grains (Fig. 7(a)). In contrast, the SEM images of both Fe-Bi and Zn-Bi showed amorphous and agglomerated clusters (Fig. 7(b) and (c), respectively). Therefore, the formed α-Fe2O3 and ZnO are very small nanoparticles compared to NiO and Bi2O3. The smaller nanoparticles could increase the surface energies of Fe-Bi and Zn-Bi compared to that of Ni-Bi, which explains the formation of more agglomerated particles with a reduced Gibbs free energy and higher stability [51]. It is widely accepted that the Gibbs Free Energy (GFE) increases with decreasing of particle size [52].
After incorporating Fe or Zn in the Ni-doped Bi (Fig. 7(d) and (e), respectively), the samples contained some fine undefined clusters. The addition of Ni stabilized the Fe and Zn nanoparticles and created small dispersed islands of amorphous particles, without forming a structured network like that in the Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi catalyst (Fig. 7(f)) [53].
3.1.4. HR-TEM analysis
Detailed structural properties of the supported Ni-Bi, Ni-Fe-Bi, and Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi catalysts were further characterized by TEM analysis (Fig. 8). The TEM image of Ni-Bi reveals flower-like clusters, with some dark round spots representing the Ni and Bi crystalline particles due to their high electron densities (Fig. 8(a)). The surface morphology of Ni-Fe-Bi is a more amorphous connected network without clear electron densities, as shown in Fig. 8(b). This change in surface properties suggests that the small Fe metallic nanoparticles fill the gaps between large Bi2O3 crystals and moderately sized NiO oxides in the nano regime, thereby enhancing the dispersion of active Ni and selective Bi metallic species on the surface of γ-Al2O3 support [27]. This observation is also in agreement with the pore size characterization.

Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi displayed almost identical surface morphology to that of Ni-Bi except for a smooth crystallographic profile, as shown in Fig. 8(c). This finding indicates that the crystalline phases of both NiO and ZnO have the same crystal orientation and form a coherent lattice interface, as characterized by high-resolution TEM images (Fig. 9(c)) and XRD patterns (Fig. 6). The HR-TEM image of the Ni-Bi catalyst (Fig. 9(a)) shows lattice fringes with interplanar d-spacings of 0.37, 0.29, and 0.24 nm, which, respectively correspond to the (120) plane of the most stable monoclinic α-Bi2O3 phase [40], the (002) plane of the metastable tetragonal β-Bi2O3 phase [54], and the (111) plane of NiO [55]. These observations agree well with the XRD results. The Ni-Fe-Bi catalyst showed only two d-spacings of 0.21 and 0.18 nm, corresponding to the (200) plane of NiO and (024) plane of α-Fe metal, respectively (Fig. 9(b)) [56].

The Ni-Fe-Zn-Bi catalyst only showed one d-spacing of 0.18 nm in Fig. 9(c), corresponding to the (024) plane of α-Fe. A comparison of the HR-TEM images of Ni-Bi and Ni-Fe-Bi suggests that the crystallinity of β-Bi2O3 decreased dramatically after incorporating the Fe promoter. Diffused regions were clearly observed when Zn was introduced into the Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi catalyst. This observation suggests that (i) α-Fe2O3 enhanced the dispersion of NiO and ZnO small crystals (which were not seen in the XRD pattern of Ni-Fe-Zn-Bi due to instrument limitations) and (ii) α-Fe2O3/β-Bi2O3 functions as a p-n type heterojunction interface to enhance spinodal decomposition of the metastable β-Bi2O3 phase [57].
3.1.5. Acidity and basicity of catalysts
The catalyst acidity plays an important role in controlling the hydrocarbon conversion and product selectivity. The nature, density, and strength of the acid sites affect the activity and selectivity of the catalyst under the reaction conditions. Moderate acid sites are responsible for dehydrogenation and deoxygenation, whereas strong acid sites are responsible for cracking and aromatization [58].
Acidic sites induce cracking (such as the cleavage of C–C, C–H, and C–O bonds) while basic sites trigger olefin desorption and restrain coke formation [59]. Generally, the density and strength of acidic (or basic) sites can be measured using the desorption of NH3 (or CO2). Mild (including weak and moderate) and strong sites are reflected by desorption at lower and higher temperatures, respectively.
Tanimu et al. reported that for the conversion of n-butane to butadiene, the Ni-Bi catalyst needs to have moderate acid sites and weak basic sites for the adsorption of n-butane and the 1st α-H elimination to form the 1-butene intermediate. On the other hand, a combination of weak acidic sites and strong basic sites is needed for the adsorption of the intermediate, the 2nd α-H elimination, and desorption of the butadiene product [41]. Doping the Ni-Bi catalyst with Zn or Fe metallic promoters is expected to influence both the acidic and basic characteristics of the catalyst surface, which may have a significant impact on n-butane conversion and product selectivity. Therefore, it is important to understand the acid-base properties of Ni-doped-Bi catalysts.
The CO2-TPD profiles of all samples followed similar trends, although the peak positions shifted according to the metal contents as shown in Fig. 10(a). The presence of more than one peak at low temperature (∼190 °C) and high temperature (>400 °C) and the peak intensity suggest the presence of both weak and strong basic sites in different amounts. The amount of strong basic sites on the Ni-Bi catalyst was 0.173 mmol/g, and their density increased after the incorporation of Zn and Fe to 0.254 and 0.266 mmol/g in Ni-Fe-Bi and Ni-Zn-Bi, respectively. Table 5 summarizes the amounts of acidic and basic sites (unit: mmol/g-cat) obtained from the desorbed quantities of NH3 and CO2.

The NH3-TPD profiles (Fig. 10(b)) show that substituting 50 wt.% of Ni with dopant (Zn, Fe, or Zn-Fe) eliminated the second strong acid peak of the Ni-Bi catalyst and converted most of these strong acid sites to mild acid sites. This observation signifies that the acidity of Ni-doped-Bi catalysts is almost entirely due to the moderate acidic sites, which is important for enhancing dehydrogenation and suppressing catalytic cracking. Moreover, addition of the bimetallic Zn-Fe promoter in Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi not only reduced the strong acidity at higher temperatures but also provided a balance between the available basicity and acidity (0.183 mmol CO2/g-cat and 0.188 mmol NH3/g-cat, respectively) as reported in Table 5.
This synergistic effect from the combined Zn and Fe promoters results in a unique balance of basicity/acidity (Fig. 11), between the basic sites required for desorbing the butene intermediate and the weak acidic sites for the 2nd step of dehydrogenation reaction to form desired butadiene. So far, there have been no concrete reports on how the relative number of total acidic sites to basic sites affects the ODH capability of n-butane to form butadiene [12]. Based on the acidity and basicity characteristics, we anticipate that this catalyst incorporating both Zn and Fe as promoters will differ in dehydrogenation performance from the Ni-Bi catalysts without or with only one promoter.

3.1.6. Reducibility of catalysts
Reducibility is an essential characteristic of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen (MVK) mechanism. The reducibility of oxides can be enhanced by doping and/or nano-structuring the catalytic surfaces [60]. Removing oxygen atoms from interfacial sites (rather than other surface regions) can completely alter the reactivity of solid catalysts. Reducibility of the calcined catalysts was measured using H2-TPR profiles shown in Fig. 12.

To better understand the impact of Zn and Fe on the reduction of NiO species, H2 uptake was divided into four regions according to the reduction temperature (Table 6). It is widely accepted that the interaction between NiO species and γ-Al2O3 support can be classified into three main types: α-, β-, and γ-type NiO [61]. A weak interaction (free α-type NiO or bulk NiO) occurs when γ-Al2O3 only works as a dispersal platform, and these NiO species are usually reduced in the temperature region below 400 °C. Moderate interaction (bounded β-type NiO), which takes place due to the interaction of γ-Al2O3 with NiO species, causes NiO reduction in the temperature range of 400–600 °C. This moderate-type NiO can be further divided into two subcategories: β1-type (highly reduced Ni-rich phase at around 400 °C) and β2-type (less reduced Al-rich phase above 500 °C). A third category is the strongest interaction between γ-Al2O3 support and Ni-containing species, forming the most stable γ-type NiO species that reduces at temperatures exceeding 600 °C. The high stability of γ-type NiO is due to the migration of Ni ions into octahedral or tetrahedral Al+3 sites in the lattice, resulting in the most stable nickel aluminate NiAl2O4 spinel [47].

Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi 0.361 0.681 0.264 0.094 1.400
Fig. 12 shows that the major hydrogen uptake (3.300 mmol/g) on the surface of Ni-Bi catalysts occurs at approximately 700 °C due to the highly stable lattice oxygen of γ-type NiO. This observation agrees with the XRD patterns that include the diffraction peaks of NiAl2O4. In addition, a small portion of the total hydrogen (∼33%) was consumed at the reduction temperature of 500 °C, which is attributed to the formation of β-type NiO as reported in Table 6. It is evident that after substituting 10 wt.% Ni with Fe, the H2-TPR profile of Ni-Fe-Bi shifted to the left, and almost 80% of the H2 consumption occurred in the moderate temperature range of 400–600 °C. Moreover, the H2-TPR profile of Ni-Fe-Bi clearly included two hydrogen reduction peaks around 450 and 550 °C, which are assigned to the reduction of Ni-rich phase (β1-type NiO) and Al-rich phase (β2-type NiO), respectively. Therefore, adding the Fe promoter enhanced the reducibility cycle of the Ni-Fe-Bi catalyst at a moderate temperature (<600 °C), which was not achievable in the case of Ni-Bi (without Fe).
Apparently, the H2-TPR profiles of Ni-Zn-Bi and Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi both featured a new peak at the lowest reduction temperature of approximately 300 °C, owing to the existence of the highly reducible α-NiO species. Hence, we assumed that impregnation with ZnO reduced the NiO-support interaction and increased the availability of reducible oxygen in the lower reduction temperature range of 100–400 °C. The amount of H2 consumed in this reduction temperature range was 0.242 and 0.361 mmol H2/g for Ni-Zn-Bi and Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi, respectively. In conclusion, H2-TPR analysis confirms that doping the Ni-Bi catalyst with Zn and Fe helps the nickel oxides lose their oxygen or donate it to an adsorbed hydrocarbon species, with a consequent change in the surface composition from MnOm to MnOm−x at low reaction temperatures. In fact, this is a prerequisite for the ODH of n-butane at a reaction temperature lower than 500 °C, a condition that reduces energy consumption and side cracking reactions. Also, ZnO plays a crucial role in eliminating the first hydrogen from the n-butane feed and forming the butene intermediate for selective conversion to butadiene in the next step with the help of α-Fe2O3.
3.2. ODH of n-butane to butadiene
3.2.1. Effect of reaction conditions
The catalytic ODH of n-butane experiments were conducted in the temperature range of 400–500 °C to avoid competing cracking and deep oxidation reactions - both of which are favored at higher reaction temperatures [27,62]. The experiments were also conducted to be free from both external and internal mass transfer limitations, which was confirmed by mass transfer assessments based on experimental data. The calculations are performed for worst case conditions and using Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi/γ-Al2O3, which has least external surface area (114.1 m2/g) and lowest pore diameter (6.47 nm). A summary of the calculated parameters is presented in Table S7 and Table S8 of the SI document.
The difference between the catalyst surface and bulk concentration of n-butane (ΔCfilm) was found to be negligible, as compared to bulk concentrations (Table S7). The small values of ΔCfilm suggest that in the context of the present study, the external mass transfer limitation is not significant. On the other hand, the calculated Weisz–Prater parameters (CWP) under worst case conditions were much smaller than 1 (one) (Table S8). Thus, the concentration gradient within the catalyst particles are expected to be negligible. Therefore, it can be concluded that in the studied reaction conditions, the chemical reaction is the limiting resistance for all the runs developed in the fixed bed reactor.
Fig. 13(a) shows the conversion of n-butane at different reaction temperatures. Predictably, conversion over all Ni-Bi and Ni-doped-Bi catalysts increased linearly with increasing reaction temperature. On the other hand, the selectivity for butadiene (Fig. 14(a)) increased up to 450 °C and then decreased at 500 °C at a fixed O2/n-butane ratio of 2.0 mol/mol. As shown in Fig. 14(b), as the temperature increased, the total C4 olefin dehydrogenation selectivity decreased owing to a higher selectivity for the cracking products (Fig. 14(c)).

(a) Butadiene (BD) selectivity, (b) dehydrogenation (DH) selectivity, (c) cracking (OC) selectivity, and (d) partial oxidation (PO) selectivity.
It is widely accepted that a proper ratio between the oxidant and n-butane in the feed can enhance the oxygen mobility cycle on the catalyst surface during ODH [63]. Co-feeding of molecular O2 can easily restore lattice oxygen vacancies of the Ni-based catalysts involved in the reduction and re-oxidation dehydrogenation reaction, which follows the MVK mechanism. This also overcomes some drawbacks such as the low reactivity and catalyst deactivation due to active metal sintering and carbon deposition [14]. As shown in Fig. 13(b), n-butane conversion over the Ni-doped-Bi catalysts depends strongly on the capacity for O2 storage/release.
Fig. 15 demonstrates that the dehydrogenation and butadiene selectivities (DH and BD, respectively) decrease sharply when the O2/n-butane ratio exceeds 2.0 mol/mol, while the cracking selectivity (OC) improves significantly. This observation indicates that co-feeding a larger amount of molecular oxygen (O2) could trigger the production of non-selective electrophilic oxygen species. These are unsaturated surface oxygen species (such as peroxide (O22−), superoxide (O−2), and oxide (O−)) that are responsible for deep oxidation by attacking the electron-rich sites of available intermediate hydrocarbons such as C = C bonds [64]. Therefore, the high surface oxygen concentration at a higher O2/n-butane ratio increases cracking reactions over the promoted Ni-Bi-based catalysts as well as the partial oxidation products, as shown in Fig. 15(d). Overall, Figs. 14 and 15 reveal that the optimum reaction temperature is 450 °C with an O2/n-butane ratio of 2.0 mol/mol.

3.2.2. Effect of dopant loading

It is generally accepted that butadiene is formed in the 2nd dehydrogenation step, when the catalyst surface has the capacity to adsorb the butene intermediate formed in the 1st hydrogen abstraction step of n-butane. However, butadiene formation has to compete with side reactions that produce undesired OC and PO products. Each dopant has its own activity and dehydrogenation selectivity according to its physical and chemical features, mainly the specific surface area of dispersed species, acid/base characteristics, and reducibility.
It is apparent from Table 7 that n-butane conversion over the bimetallic catalysts (Ni-Bi, Zn-Bi, and Fe-Bi) is in the order of Zn ≥ Ni > Fe, while the butadiene selectivity follows the inverse order of Ni > Fe > Zn. Even though the highest overall dehydrogenation selectivity (75%) was obtained with the Ni-Bi catalyst, the Fe-Bi catalyst gave the best selectivity of 88% towards butadiene from the 2nd dehydrogenation step, owing to its ability to suppress the PO reaction (CO formation). Generally, the C4 olefin yield over the Ni-Bi catalyst is much greater than that over Zn-Bi and Fe-Bi. Therefore, both Zn and Fe could improve the catalytic performance of the Ni-Bi catalyst, but they cannot replace Ni as the main active species.
After doping 10 wt.% of Zn or Fe in the Ni-Bi catalyst, the total C4 olefin dehydrogenation selectivity and butadiene selectivity are in the respective orders of (Ni-Zn-Bi > Ni-Fe-Bi) and (Ni-Fe-Bi > Ni-Zn-Bi) according to Table 7. The promoted Ni-Zn-Bi catalyst contained the highest density of strong basic sites (0.266 mmol CO2/g-cat) among all the Ni-doped-Bi catalysts, which enhanced the desorption of the formed C4 olefins. The addition of Fe to Ni-Bi enhanced the selective dehydrogenation of the butene intermediate to butadiene, because a large amount of available lattice oxygen species (1.600 mmol H2/g-cat) is required for the 2nd dehydrogenation step in the reaction temperature range of 400–500 °C as reported in Table 6.
Fig. 16 shows that there is a clear difference in the product selectivity distribution over various Ni-doped-Bi catalysts, while their conversions are almost similar to that of the unpromoted Ni-Bi catalyst. After adding combined Zn-Fe promoter into the Ni-Bi catalyst, the butadiene selectivity increased to a maximum of 49% due to the availability of highly reducible α-NiO and moderately reducible β-NiO species at lower reduction temperatures (Fig. 12), which contribute to deep dehydrogenation of both n-butane and butene intermediates to generate more butadiene. This Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi catalyst displays a characteristic balance between the basic sites and mild acid sites. These sites play an essential role in the selective abstraction of hydrogen from both n-butane and butene intermediates during the 1st and 2nd steps of dehydrogenation, respectively (Fig. 11).

3.2.3. Catalyst stability
Stable catalytic performance for a longer time under reaction conditions is highly important, especially from an industrial point of view. Therefore, the thermal stability test of Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi/γ-Al2O3 (best performing catalyst) was conducted under the optimum reaction conditions of 450 °C and O2/n-butane of 2.0 mol/mol, and the results are shown in Fig. 18.

Fig. 18. Stability test of 10Ni-5Zn-5Fe-30Bi-O/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with time-on-stream (15 h TOS).
The catalyst is stable for 15 hours’ time-on-stream (TOS) with a minimal decrease in its performance. The total time-on-stream is 15 h. The catalysts performance was taken for each 1 h at a total feed flowrate of 31.2 ml/min and the mass balance was done based on carbon balance which is approximately 100% for all the tested catalysts. The catalyst showed a highly stable conversion with a small decrease in the butadiene selectivity (Fig. 18(b)) at the initial stage due to a decline in the 2nd step dehydrogenation selectivity as demonstrated in Fig. 18(c). Moreover, the overall dehydrogenation selectivity is almost constant which indicates that the butenes selectivity was slightly increased with time as complementary to the slight decrease in butadiene selectivity, also there is a constant trend in the side products of oxygenate formation and partial oxidation as presented in Fig. 18(b). This further confirms that the catalyst is more selective towards the dehydrogenation pathway even after 15 hours’ time-on-stream.
Also, TGA analysis was conducted on the spent catalyst after 15 h TOS to obtain information about the carbon content via weight loss. The result showed that this catalyst is highly stable against thermal and coke deactivation, as carbon content lower than 5.0 wt.% was recorded as presented in Fig. 19(a). Also, the inflection point (Fig. 19(b)) in the first derivative of TG at 61 °C is attributed to the desorption of the adsorbed water [65] produced during the formation of butadiene. Additionally, N2 adsorption analysis was performed for the spent catalyst and compared with the fresh catalyst. The average pore diameter was slightly increased from 6.47 to 7.18 nm due to the partial blocking of less than 5.0 nm mesopores as shown in Fig. 19(c). This result suggests that the catalyst activity decay was due to coke formation and pore blockage during catalytic cracking of n-butane to light olefins [66].

Table 8 compares the catalytic performance of the best evaluated catalyst (Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi /γ-Al2O3) with the performance of various catalysts reported in the literature. D. Bhattacharyya et al. improved the n-butane conversion and butadiene selectivity over the V-Mg-O catalyst coupled with highly active promoter Cr2O3 and selective TiO2 synthesized by addition of the proper amount of the respective promoter oxide with magnesium oxide to the solution of ammonium vanadate. The study revealed that the redux cycle of the promoted V-Mg-O, Cr2O3, TiO2 catalyst was enhanced, but the reaction temperature was exceeded 550 °C to reach the best n-butane conversion and butadiene selectivity of 53% and 63%, respectively [67]. Recently, Sánchez-García et al. improved the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over VOx catalyst supported over conversional SiO2 by coating the silica with a highly reducible interface of ZrO2. They concluded that the highly acidic ZrO2 sites covered by the vanadium grafting form weaker sites and undergo further dehydrogenation at lower Zr loadings (10 wt.% Zr). The butadiene selectivity over VOx/ZrOx/SiO2 was 44% at n-butane conversion of 15% [68].

According to Venkata D.B.C. et al., the activity of the Ni-Mo catalyst supported over γ-Al2O3in the n-butane ODH was excellent with a highest conversion of 71% at 450 reaction temperature with an O2/n-butane ratio of 2.0 mol/mol. However, the highly acidic nature of Mo active species activated the partial nickel/molybdenum oxidation resulting in more COx formation (COx selectivity exceeds 35%) and lowered the butadiene selectivity to 25% [14]. In another study, Zn was used as a promoter for the ZnFe2O4 catalyst prepared by coprecipitation method. The results showed that the promoted ZnFe2O4-ZnO catalyst enhances butadiene production via increasing the isomerization of butene-2 to butene-1 due to the presence of ZnO phase while the associated α-Fe2O3 phase promoted the selectivity of carbon dioxide to 65%. Overall, the n-butane conversion and butadiene selectivity over ZnFe2O4-ZnO catalyst were 10% and 28%, respectively [69]. Therefore, the performance of the best promoted Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi /γ-Al2O3 in this study could be a competitive and potential catalyst for conversion of normal butane to butadiene in terms of activity (n-butane conversion:18.6% and butadiene selectivity: 49%), energy efficiency (industrial reaction temperature of 450 °C with air as resource of O2) and the environment (COx selectivity: 16%).
4. Conclusions
This study confirmed the capability of Ni-doped-Bi catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to produce butadiene, an important feedstock for the synthetic rubber industry. The conversion of n-butane and butadiene selectivity over Ni-Bi, Zn-Bi, Fe-Bi, and Ni-doped-Bi (dopant: Zn, Fe, Zn-Fe) catalysts were investigated at different O2/n-C4H10 molar ratios (1–4 mol/mol) and temperatures (400–500 °C). Performance of the bimetallic catalysts (Fe-Bi and Zn-Bi) revealed that Fe or Zn alone without Ni species enhanced the side reactions of oxidative cracking of n-butane to form light C2C3 olefins instead.
Partial substitution of 50 % Zn by Ni (Ni-Zn-Bi) improved the 1st step dehydrogenation selectivity to form butene, owing to an increased basic character with highly reducible α-type NiO species. Conversely, adding Fe enhanced the butadiene selectivity for the 2nd step dehydrogenation over Ni-Fe-Bi, because of the higher density of weak acid sites with moderately reducible β-NiO in the considered reaction temperature range.
The introduction of combined Zn-Fe promoter into the Ni-Bi catalyst, in comparison, improved the dispersion of NiO, ZnO, and α-Fe2O3 nanometallic particles in the 2–5 nm mesoporous region, which minimized the Ni-support interaction. In addition, Zn-Fe shifted the reducibility profile of the Ni-Zn-Fe-Bi catalyst to the optimum reaction temperature of 450 °C. Consequently, the catalyst containing 10 wt.% Ni, 5 wt.% Zn, 5 wt.% Fe, and 30 wt.% Bi supported on γ-Al2O3 showed remarkable catalytic performance, with a butadiene selectivity of 49.0% at the n-butane conversion of 18.6%. Zn-Fe increased the butadiene selectivity because Ni improved both the 1st step dehydrogenation selectivity by Zn and the 2nd step dehydrogenation selectivity by Fe.
