Effect of H2O presence on the propane decomposition reaction over Pd in a proton conducting membrane reactor
Abstract
The reaction of C3H8 decomposition was studied in a proton conducting cell-reactor in the presence of H2O vapor in the feed gas. The proton conductor was a strontia–ceria–ytterbia perovskite disk of the form: SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3−α. Reaction temperature varied between 873 and 1023 K and a polycrystalline palladium film was used as the working electrode-catalyst. The H2 produced by the reaction was electrochemically transported through the walls of the proton conducting disk to the outer reactor-chamber. Upon increasing the H2O partial pressure from 0.3 to 2.8 kPa, a 4-fold increase on the reaction rate was observed. Upon proton “pumping” to the outer chamber, an up to 90% of the produced hydrogen was electrochemically separated from the reaction mixture.
1. Introduction
The decomposition of propane is catalyzed on Pt-based [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10] or Cr-based [11], [12], [13], [14] catalysts and involves primarily the following two reactions:
(1)
C3H8 → C3H6 + H2, ΔΗ° = 124 kJ/mol (at 298 K)
(2)
C3H8 → C2H4 + CH4, ΔΗ° = 83 kJ/mol (at 298 K)
Both reactions are favored at high temperatures (773–973 K) and low pressures (0.3–1 atm). Reaction (1) is of major industrial importance because it is a potential method for the production of C3H6, a key chemical in the polymerization and organic synthesis industries. Additionally, this reaction produces H2 which tends to become the energy “currency” of the future.
All new developments in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane have to take into account the limited thermodynamic conversion of reaction (1). Along these lines and taking into account the increasing interest in hydrogen production from hydrocarbon fuels, novel reactor designs included the use of membrane reactors [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Materials that have been used in the construction of these membrane reactors include PdAg and PdRu alloys as well as silica-based membranes. Hydrogen is selectively removed from the propane stream through the solid membrane resulting to a moderate increase in propylene yield.
In the last 20 years, solid electrolyte proton conductors, i.e. materials that exhibit proton conductivity (H+) in the solid state, have been utilized in catalytic studies [23]. These proton conductors could be useful in catalysis, since they can operate at temperatures in which many hydro- and dehydrogenation reactions take place. The prominent advantage that such an electrochemical reactor could offer is that the dehydrogenation reaction and the subsequent separation of hydrogen from the reaction mixture occur at the same time, since the catalytic reaction takes place at the anode, while high purity H2 is recovered at the cathode. The main difference between an electrochemical reactor and a conventional membrane reactor is that in the latter, the driving force for the removal of hydrogen is the difference in the partial pressure of hydrogen at the two sides of the membrane. In the proton conducting electrochemical reactor, the driving force is the difference in the electrochemical potential of protons at the two sides of the solid state proton conductor. Therefore, by using an external power source (e.g. a galvanostat or a potentiostat), it is possible to increase, decrease or even reverse the proton flux, if desirable. In addition, proton conducting membrane reactors can be used to electrochemically promote catalytic reaction rates. If the catalyst to be promoted is one of the electrodes of the cell, protons can be electrochemically “pumped” to or away from the catalyst during reaction. This can cause a dramatic change in catalytic activity and the rate enhancement can be orders of magnitude higher than the rate of proton transport through the electrolyte. So far, a large number of reactions exhibiting this Non-Faradaic Electrochemical Modification of Catalytic Activity (NEMCA) effect, has been reported [24], [25].
Propane decomposition in either conventional or membrane reactors exhibits the problem of gradual catalyst deactivation due to carbon formation. Carbon deposition causes gradual blocking of the active sites and under these conditions, the dominant reactions are:
(3)
C3H8 → 3C + 4H2
(4)
C3H8 → 2CH4 + C
while reactions (1), (2) may be totally suppressed. In order to restrict carbon formation and sustain the catalytic activity, one could add either H2 or H2O in the feed gas. According to various studies [2], [7], [9], the addition of gaseous H2 in the reaction mixture (typically hydrogen-to-carbon ratio 0.8) could significantly decrease the problem of catalyst deactivation. Nevertheless, the presence of hydrogen would thermodynamically lead to a decrease in the rate of propane dehydrogenation according to reaction (1). Alternatively, a well-known practice for the elimination of carbon deposition in several hydrocarbon reactions is the addition of water vapor in the feed gas [26], [27], [28], [29]. Kogan et al. [3] studied the effects of hydrogen and steam addition on the performance of Pt-based catalysts. They concluded that steam is a more effective medium, allowing significantly higher propylene yields and overall propane reaction rates. The presence of H2O in the system causes partial reforming of propane and the following two reactions can be added to the overall reaction scheme:
(5)
C3H8 + 3H2O ↔ 3CO + 7H2
(6)
CO + H2O ↔ CO2 + H2
In a previous study of propane decomposition in a proton conducting membrane reactor, the catalytic and electrocatalytic activities of Pt and Pd were compared [30]. It was found that Pt exhibited higher overall reaction rates while the product selectivities were similar to those on Pd. The electrocatalytic effect, on the other hand, was much more pronounced on Pd electrodes. At 923 K, however, substantial carbon deposition was observed on Pd resulting to a remarkable decrease of the catalytic activity [30].
In the present work, the reaction of propane decomposition is studied on Pd electrodes in the presence of steam. The effect of steam addition on the rates of propylene and hydrogen formation as well as on carbon deposition is examined. The reaction is studied under both, open and closed circuit and the effect of imposed current on reaction rates and product selectivities is evaluated.
2. Experimental
A schematic description of the cell-reactor, utilized in the present study, is shown in Fig. 1. The proton conductor was a strontia–ceria–ytterbia perovskite disk of the form: SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3−α (SCY). The procedure followed for the construction of the SCY disk was that described by Iwahara et al. [31]. The cylindrical SCY disk of 24 mm diameter and 1.5 mm thickness was sealed at the bottom of a 150 mm long ceramic tube (16 mm i.d., 19 mm o.d.). The sealing material was a BaO–SiO2 glass. The ceramic tube was enclosed in a 20 cm long, closed at its bottom end, quartz tube (37 mm i.d., 40 mm o.d.).

A porous Pd film was deposited on the outside surface of the SCY disk (outer chamber) and served as the cathodic electrode. Similarly, a Pd film was deposited on the inside surface of the SCY disk (inner chamber) and served as the anodic-working electrode (catalyst). Prior to the experiments, the electrodes were exposed to an air stream for 1 h at 800 °C. A more detailed description of the preparation of the electrodes can be found elsewhere [32]. The catalyst loading for the Pd porous film was approximately 30 mg. SEM photographs showed an average particle size of approximately 5 μm for the Pd crystallites. Using this crystallite size, the total surface area for Pd was estimated at 30 cm2. Additionally, the superficial surface area of the working electrode was 1.5 cm2. The C3H8/H2O (diluted in He) feed gas was flowing over the anode (inner chamber), where H2 was produced. By imposing electrical currents between the Pd electrodes (closed circuit operation of the cell), hydrogen was electrochemically transported – in the form of H+ – via the solid electrolyte from the anode to the cathode (outer chamber), where gaseous H2 was formed.
Analysis of the inlet and outlet gases was performed by on-line gas chromatography, using an HP 5890 Series 2 chromatograph equipped with a Molecular Sieve 5A and a Hayesep Q column. Constant currents and voltages across the cell were imposed using a 2053 AMEL Galvanostat–Potentiostat.
3. Results and discussion
The catalytic and electrocatalytic experiments were obtained at 873–1023 K and at atmospheric total pressure. The reaction mixture was prepared by bubbling a C3H8He stream through a vessel that contained liquid water. The outlet stream of the vessel was a C3H8/H2O/He mixture and was fed into the inner chamber of the cell-reactor, i.e. over the anodic electrode. The total flowrate of the reacting mixture was kept at 20–40 cm3 (STP)/min. Pure Ar was introduced over the cathodic electrode, i.e. in the space between the ceramic and the quartz tube, at a flowrate of 20–40 cm3 (STP)/min. All catalytic results were obtained after approximately 24 h on stream. The products observed, under both open and closed circuit operation, were C3H6, H2, CH4, C2H4, CO, CO2 and traces of C2H6. Additionally, at T = 923 K, substantial carbon deposition on the catalytic surface was observed.
In order to better illustrate the effect of water vapor content in the feed gas, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 5, also contain results of our previous study [30], in which the water content was minimal (
 = 0.3 kPa).

Fig. 2a and b contain open circuit results. Under open circuit (i.e. with no current passing through the solid electrolyte), the cell-reactor of Fig. 1 operates as a regular catalytic reactor and the anodic electrode serves as the catalyst for the reaction under study. Fig. 2a and b show the effect of reaction temperature on the selectivity to H2 and C3H6, respectively. The H2 selectivity is defined as 1/4 of the moles of produced hydrogen over the moles of reacted propane. Similarly, the C3H6 selectivity is defined as the moles of produced propylene over the moles of reacted propane. Fig. 2a shows that for
 = 0.3 kPa (H2O/C3H8 = 0.15), there is a strong negative effect of temperature and the H2 selectivity drops from 45% at 923 K to 16% at 1023 K. On the contrary, for
 = 2.8 kPa (H2O/C3H8 = 1.4), the H2 selectivity is kept between 20 and 30%. Fig. 2b shows that, regardless of the steam content in the reacting mixture, the C3H6 selectivity decreases with temperature. Also, at all temperatures examined, the addition of steam results into lower C3H6 selectivities.
Fig. 3 contains closed circuit data. Under closed circuit, the cell-reactor of Fig. 1 can operate as an electrochemical hydrogen “pump”. In Fig. 3, the rate of carbon deposition is plotted versus the imposed current, or equivalently I/2F, which is the rate of hydrogen electrochemically pumped out of the reaction chamber (expressed in moles H2/s). The rate of carbon deposition was calculated from a carbon balance. The reaction temperature was kept at 923 K. Fig. 3 shows clearly that by using a high steam to propane ratio (H2O/C3H6 = 1.4), a significant decrease (10–18 times) in the rates of carbon deposition is observed. As expected, the rate of carbon deposition is reduced because of the reaction of carbon with water vapor:
(7)
C + H2O → CO + H2
Reaction (7) can explain the big difference in the rates of carbon deposition with
 = 0.3 and 2.8 kPa in the feed stream (Fig. 3 at I/2F = 0). Furthermore, “pumping” H2 away from the catalyst results in further suppression of carbon formation at any steam content of the reacting mixture. This phenomenon can be attributed to various reasons. First, the rate of the reaction (7) is expected to increase because of the continuous removal of H2. Another reason could be the partial water vapor electrolysis, which produces O2 molecules that react with carbon. Finally, under closed circuit and at the conditions employed in this study (low concentration of H2 over the anode, presence of water vapor, etc.), it is possible that the SCY electrolyte also exhibits oxygen ion conductivity [33].
In Fig. 4, SEM photographs of carbon deposited on the catalytic surface are presented. The photographs were obtained after 24 h on stream at T = 923 K and for
 = 0.3 kPa. It can be seen that carbon particles are in the form of nanotubes or nanofibers, in a variety of sizes ranging from <0.5 μm to approximately 5 μm in diameter. These nanoparticles seem to be interconnected to form larger irregular structures. It should be mentioned that there is no difference in the form of carbon nanotubes when the high
(2.8 kPa) is used.

 = 2 kPa and
 = 0.3 kPa).
The formation of carbon nanotubes is in agreement with a previous study on propane decomposition, over alumina supported binary catalysts, by Wang et al. [34]. It is important to note that by stabilizing carbon in the form of nanotubes or nanofibers, there is no chemical alteration of the active catalytic sites and carbon can be easily removed from the palladium surface.
In Fig. 5a–d, the rates of formation of H2, C3H6, COx and the overall rate of propane decomposition are plotted versus I/2F at 973 K and for two different
values, i.e. 0.3 and 2.8 kPa. It can be seen that all reaction rates attain considerably higher values at
 = 2.8 kPa. There is a 3–4 times increase in H2 production (Fig. 5a). The increase in COx production rates, however, is less profound (Fig. 5c). Fig. 5b and d show that there is a 2–2.5 times increase in the rate of C3H6 formation and an almost 4-fold increase in the rate of propane decomposition. The relatively higher increase in the rate of propane decomposition can explain the negative effect of water vapor on the selectivity to C3H6 (Fig. 2b).

The enhancement in propylene production can be attributed to the fact that hydroxyl groups – derived from water – interact with hydrogen atoms of adsorbed propane [3]. Hence, the dissociative adsorption of propane on the metallic sites, which is considered to be the rate-determining step in the dehydrogenation reaction [3], [6], is accelerated. As far as the effect of the imposed current is concerned, it is clear that the rates of formation of H2 and COx increase substantially as hydrogen is “pumped” away. On the contrary, the rates of C3H6 production and C3H8 decomposition are virtually not affected by the imposed currents. These observations indicate that only the side-reactions (5) and (6) are affected by hydrogen pumping.
In the present membrane reaction–separation process, it is important to evaluate the efficiency of the imposed current, i.e. the percentage of the imposed current that is actually effective in transferring H2 – in the form of protons – from the reaction chamber to the outer chamber. In the present case, the current efficiency is quantitatively expressed by the Proton Transport Number (PTN), defined as:
(8)
Fig. 6 shows the dependence of PTN on the imposed current, for the four different temperatures examined. In all cases, PTN is below unity, i.e. the imposed current is not fully exploited into hydrogen ‘pumped’ to the outer chamber. However, the values of the parameter vary between 0.70 and 0.90, depending on the imposed current and the reaction temperature. In the previous study of propane decomposition over Pd [30], the PTN values varied between 0.40 and 0.60. Hence, the increase in
causes a significant improvement on the current efficiency. This is in agreement with the work of Matsumoto et al. [35], where it was found that the increase in water vapor content improves significantly the PTN of the SCY proton conductor.

Fig. 6 also shows that at all temperatures, there is a gradual decrease in PTN with current. This decrease in PTN is temperature dependent and is “delayed” at higher temperatures. In other words, the higher the temperature the broader the range of I/2F values within which PTN is maintained high (e.g. above 0.80 at 1023 K). This can be attributed to the fact that both H2 production and proton conductivity increase with reaction temperature.
In order to determine the effect of propane presence on PTN, experiments were run without propane in the feed gas (i.e. H2O/He mixtures with
 = 2.8 kPa) and results were compared to those obtained with C3H8/H2O/He mixtures. Fig. 7 contains these results plotted versus the absolute temperature with the current held constant at I = 4 mA (I/2F = 2.1 × 10−8 mol H2/s). It can be clearly seen that the propane containing mixtures exhibit higher PTN values. This indicates that proton pumping cannot be solely attributed to water electrolysis and that there is a considerable contribution by hydrogen produced via the decomposition of propane, especially at temperatures below 923 K.

The presence of propane affects positively not only PTN but also the overall cell conductivity. This is illustrated in Fig. 8a and b, in which the imposed current is plotted versus the cell voltage for the two different reaction mixtures. With propane present (Fig. 8b), the overall cell conductivity is 4–5 times higher. Hence, in the presence of propane, the higher PTN values combined with the substantially higher overall cell conductivity, result to a significant enhancement of the molar flow of hydrogen pumped towards the outer chamber.

Fig. 9 shows the dependence of ‘Hydrogen Removal’ on the imposed current, for three different reaction temperatures. This parameter represents the percentage of H2 produced that is electrochemically pumped away from the reaction chamber:
(9)
An almost linear increase in ‘Hydrogen Removal’ with the imposed current is observed at all temperatures examined. For a certain current value, the higher the temperature the lower the value of ‘Hydrogen Removal’. This is because the effect of temperature on the rate of hydrogen production is stronger than on the rate of proton transport through the solid electrolyte. As seen in Fig. 9, the maximum ‘Hydrogen Removal’ (about 90%) is attained at T = 973 K and I = 20 mA, i.e. approximately 90% of H2 produced is pumped away from the catalyst and separated from the reaction mixture.

4. Conclusions
The increase of H2O vapor content in the feed gas has a major effect on both product distribution and the process of H2 removal from the reacting mixture. An approximately 4-fold increase in the overall rate of propane decomposition was observed when
increased from 0.3 to 2.8 kPa. At the same time, the rate of H2 formation was enhanced by a factor of 3–4, while the enhancement in both C3H6 and COx formation rates was less profound. Additionally, at
 = 2.8 kPa, a significant decrease (10–18 times) in the rate of carbon deposition was observed.
During the electrochemical pumping of hydrogen towards the outer chamber of the reactor-cell, PTN values as high as 0.75–0.90 were measured indicating a considerable increase in comparison to our previous study [30], in which the PTN values varied between 0.40 and 0.60. The presence of propane in the feed gas has a positive effect on both PTN and overall conductivity of the solid electrolyte. Finally, in terms of ‘Hydrogen Removal’, the values measured were substantially high, reaching approximately 90% at T = 973 K and I = 20 mA.
