Dehydrogenation of C3–C4 paraffin's to corresponding olefins over slit-SAPO-34 supported Pt-Sn-based novel catalyst
Abstract
The objective of this work is to discuss the performance of Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34 novel catalyst for selective C3–C4 dehydrogenation to corresponding light olefins. The metallic contents, acidity, active metallic sites and metallic dispersion were determined using a number of physico-chemical techniques as it gives a justification for superior catalytic activity for dehydrogenation reaction. The Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34 catalyst was analyzed for dehydrogenation activity under optimized operating conditions; at atmospheric pressure, hydrogen to alkane (feed) molar ratio is 0.2, weight hourly space velocity 5 h−1 and temperature 585 °C. Around 40% light alkane conversion and above 95% of total olefins selectivity with 94% propene, 92% n-butene and about 84% iso-butene selectivity were achieved over Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34 novel catalyst. The catalyst was parametrically characterized over the above said operating conditions and effects of operating conditions on product distribution were discussed. The coke formation was inherently related to catalyst activity in dehydrogenation reaction and related to surface intermetallic ensemble effects; and ultimately the prominent stakeholder in catalyst deactivation. The novel catalysts also showed very good hydrothermal stability in a continuous reaction–regeneration cycles due to silica-based acidic structure of support. The results obtained over Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34 novel catalyst were compared with other Pt-Sn-based ZSM-5 and SAPO-34 supported catalysts of similar active metallic content under identical operating conditions.
1. Introduction
Catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes (particularly propane and butane) to corresponding olefins is important because of growing demand for olefins as intermediate raw material to commodity and specialty chemicals. Propylene is one of the key petrochemical building blocks for numerous derivatives like polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, oxy-alcohols, acrylic acid, isopropyl alcohols, oligomers and other miscellaneous intermediates. iso-Butene is the feedstock for oxygenates (MTBE, ETBE, etc.) and butane-1 is an important polymer grade intermediate (for butadiene, butyl rubber, polybutene, and isoprene). Most of these olefins come as a by-product of crackers and FCC units [1], [2], [3], [4]. While the major portion is propane, butane and iso-butane, thus, dehydrogenation of the said light paraffin is the prevailing production route to desired olefins [5], [6], [7], [8]. In order to enhance desired olefin like iso-butene, this route comprises two steps; first n-butane is isomerized to iso-butane and then dehydrogenated to corresponding olefin, i.e. iso-butene. Many attempts have been made to combine these two steps by designing a catalyst for direct n-butane to isobutene conversion (hydroisomerization); but still not found economical due to a number of reasons. Recently, the mixed hydrocarbon (associated petroleum gas and natural gas liquids) dehydrogenation without preliminary separation is an interesting process to intensify the olefin production.
Direct dehydrogenation is an endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction that requires selective catalyst, relatively high temperatures and low pressures. This high process temperature favors side-reactions and generates coke precursors. The process of light alkane dehydrogenation does not enjoy the plethora of mechanistic subtleties that have engaged researchers’ attention in developing robust catalysts; those are stable at high temperatures, and selective toward dehydrogenation. It is generally believed that over a bifunctional catalyst the dehydrogenation occurs on metal-site in first step followed by isomerization over the Brönsted acid sites [7].
Dehydrogenation of light alkane process was first developed and commercialized by UOP (then Universal Oil Products) together with ICI [9]. Houdry designed a unique process Catadiene for higher conversions to butenes using chromia-alumina catalyst, later in late 1980s they modified the design (to Catofin) for propane and isobutene dehydrogenation [10]. Most of the direct dehydrogenation technologies differ in operational schemes in order to meet the endothermic requirement of reaction. Both Pt and Cr supported alumina catalysts were extensively studied for light alkane dehydrogenation with a number of promoters [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. The deactivation in less than 10 min and excessive coke formation were the prominent drawbacks of alumina supported catalysts. It further brings in operational complexities. Hence, the more robust catalyst that has better control on stereo-chemistry of butane dehydrogenation reaction is needed.
In last two decades environmentally friendly, non-corrosive, shape selective and hydrothermally stable, solid acid catalysts; zeolites and zeolite supported metal catalysts became famous in petrochemical industries. The zeolites have Brönsted and/or Lewis acid sites and well defined pore structures. The well known initiation step is direct protonation of alkane by Brönsted acid sites form pentavalent carbonium ion mechanism [20], [21]. It has been noticed experimentally and theoretically that zeolite acid sites are not sufficient for light alkane protonation to make alkoxy species [22]. The role of zeolite is to regulate mass transport and to provide a surface for physical adsorption of active hydrocarbon species near Brönsted acid sites. In contrast, support's acidic sites activities have recently been shown to have systematic role in controlling stereo-chemistry of light alkane dehydrogenation reaction [22]. Another possibility for initiating cracking and dehydrogenation is the presence of Lewis acid sites of zeolites, those some how involved in hydride abstraction from alkanes and generate carbenium ion activated complexes. The initial monomolecular processes, carbenium ion complexes are then involved in bimolecular hydride transfer, oligomerization and β-scission reactions. Many researchers have carried out experimental and theoretical studies of light alkane catalytic dehydrogenation kinetics over zeolites, because the primary reaction pathways are relatively simple to identify. However, in this paper, we emphasize to design suitable zeolitic support for dehydrogenation. As the crystal structures of these zeolites differ considerably and hence access to active sites varies, but the strengths of the sites were almost similar. Pore sizes for ZSM-5 tridimensional zeolite are order 0.51–0.56 nm, 0.35–0.48 nm for bidimensional ferrierite and 0.65–0.70 nm for one-dimensional mordenite [23]. By comparison the Lennard-Jones diameter of the reactants, isobutane is 0.53 nm which is bigger than the pore diameter of SAPO-34 [24].
Pt-Sn-based catalysts supported on amorphous supports and/or zeolites for light alkane dehydrogenation have been discussed in many studies [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. The selection of Sn as a promoter has been explained in terms of beneficial geometric and/or electronic effects [13]. In geometric effects size of platinum ensembles decreases. In Pt-Sn contact in a solid solution or an alloy, Sn fills up 5d band of Pt which leads to a decreased hydrocarbon interaction with Pt, thus, lowering the contribution of hydrogenolysis and coke formation. Sn also modifies the electronic density of Pt by positive charge transfer from Snn+ species [15]. Presence of Sn also helps in desired Pt sites for dehydrogenation at reaction temperatures and retard Pt-Sn alloy formation. Sn also reduces the acidity of the support and stabilizes the surface area. Therefore we can infer that the dehydrogenation performance of Pt-Sn-based catalysts depends on Pt, Sn and support interactions [22]. The deactivation of Pt-based catalyst during propane dehydrogenation is mainly due to the aggregation of Pt particles and carbon deposition [14], [15]. Presence of Sn as promoters facilitates transfer of coke from active Pt sites to support and stabilizes catalytic activity for longer durations. Number of additional promoters like Na, Zn, Ca, Cu, Mo, Ru, K, La, Mg, etc. were also studied, however, their role is controversial and the reaction results were not conclusive [15], [22], [25], [26].
Previously Pt-Sn/Al2O3, Pt-Sn/ZSM-5 and Pt-Sn/SAPO-34 were extensively studied for light alkane dehydrogenation, while much attention has been given to metallic contents modifications, characterization and combinations. In this study we introduced a novel modified support slit-SAPO-34 for Pt-based catalyst that has more robust control on stereo-chemistry of alkane dehydrogenation reaction. Moreover, in our extensive experimental study it was observed that the intensification of support has more dominant influence on the performance of dehydrogenation reaction than metallic modifications. This paper discusses the performances of different zeloite supported Pt-Sn catalysts for a broader picture in understanding the role of support on light alkane dehydrogenation. The catalyst was characterized using number of physico-chemical techniques and parametrically characterized in order to understand the reaction dynamics.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The slit-SAPO-34 was prepared using a non-mesopore template, i.e. kaolin (a combined source of aluminum and silicon), phosphorus, template, and de-ionized water mixed together and stirred to obtain a uniform crystallization solution [27], [28], [29], [30]. This structure was introduced by Dr. Jie Zhu of Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing in 2008 [27]. The kaolin:P2O5:H2O were mixed in the molar ratio of ∼1.5:1:500, later the mixture was stirred, aged, autoclaved, filtered, washed, dried, and calcined at 600 °C. Finally, a silico-alumino phosphate catalyst with a slit shape was obtained. The nano-scaled confinement environment provided by the naturally layered starting material allowed the zeolite crystals to grow in a novel hierarchical structure with high crystallinity and excellent hydrothermal stability [27], [28], [29], [30]. The detailed recipe of ZSM-5 and SAPO-34 support manufacturing is well known and discussed in many studies [3], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35].
The bimetallic catalyst Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34 was prepared at 70 °C by sequential co-impregnation method [22]. The SAPO-34 was first impregnated with promoter Sn; 0.16 M SnCl2·2H2O aqueous solution at 80 °C in order to ensure 1 wt.% Sn content in the final catalyst. After the impregnation, the catalyst was dried at 100 °C for 3 h and finally calcined at 500 °C for 4 h. Then Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst was co-impregnated again with Pt; 0.03 M H2PtCl6 aqueous solution at 70 °C. Afterwards the catalyst was dried at 100 °C for 3 h and calcined at 500 °C for 4 h. Pt-Sn/ZSM-5 and Pt-Sn/SAPO-34 were prepared in similar manner using powdered ZSM-5 of Si/Al ratio 140 and SAPO-34 respectively. In this study we did not emphasize on optimization of the metallic content, operational optimization and support formation as we have already studied this in previous studies with Pt-Sn based catalysts. The catalysts were used in pure form without pelletization.
2.2. Catalysis characterization
The prepared Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34 catalyst was characterized using number of physico-chemical techniques. Pt and Sn metallic content of catalyst was verified using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) on a Shimadzu XRF 1700 fluorimeter.
The BET surface area of support and impregnated catalyst were measured using N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and determined using an automatic analyzer (Autosrb-1-C). The surface areas were calculated using BET equation.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of slit-SAPO-34 supported catalyst was obtained using a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku-2500), in order to ensure texture of support. The XRD was performed with Cu Kα radiation and the X-ray tube was operated at 40 kV. The spectrum was scanned at a rate of 5°/min, from 5° to 35° (an angular range 2θ).
The acid properties of Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34 catalyst were determined by NH3-TPD, using an Autochem-II 2920 analyzer. The sample (0.2 g) was treated first by flowing dry argon at 500 °C for 1 h and then passed ammonia for adsorption at room temperature. Then temperature was raised and kept at 100 °C for 0.5 h to desorb the physically adsorbed ammonia. Later raised to 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and ammonia desorption profile was recorded by thermal conductivity detector.
The IR spectrum of adsorbed ammonia on catalyst was recorded using a NEXUS apparatus (Nicolet, USA). The sample was first degassed (<10–6 mbar) at 300 °C for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature. Afterwards, ammonia was passed and ammonia adsorption spectrum was recorded at 100 °C. The concentration of Brönsted and Lewis acid sites were estimated from the areas of the bands, using the molar absorption coefficients of the bands of adsorbed ammonia, set equal to those determined for zeolites.
Coke deposited on catalyst during light alkanes dehydrogenation were determined by oxygen-pulse experiments using gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD. Pulses of pure oxygen (99.99%) were injected at 750 °C. The pulses of oxygen were continued until deposited coke converted to carbobdioxide completely, which was measured by TCD detector and amount of coke was calculated.
Ability of catalysts to adsorb hydrogen was determined by pulse chemisorptions of hydrogen using conventional setup attached to gas chromatograph (7890-II) having a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) [36]. Moreover it's the direct measurement of active Pt sites available for dehydrogenation. Sample was reduced under flowing hydrogen (5 mL/min) at 400 °C for 2 h, then purged with nitrogen at 500 °C for 1 h and were successively cooled to room temperature. Samples were saturated by hydrogen pulses of 5 ml/min of 5% (v/v) at 25, 300 and 500 °C. The time between pulses was 3 min and pulses were countinued until no further gas uptake was observed. The total amount of adsorption was calculated by adding gas uptake observed in the series of gas injections.
The active metal dispersion was obtained using a JEM 2010 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (operated at 120.0 kV). The samples were prepared using a common sonication method, while thick samples were dispersed in ethanol. The support was characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM) JSM7401F, respectively.
2.3. Catalyst performance evaluation
The performance of Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34 novel catalyst for light alkane dehydrogenation to corresponding olefins was investigated in a continuous plug-flow quartz micro-reactor at atmospheric pressure. For present study 99.95% propane, n-butane and iso-butane feed was provided by Zhong Ke Hui Jie (HJAT), Beijing, China. The measured amount of samples was loaded into the reactor in order to maintain desired weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) between 1 and 8 h−1. Before the reaction test each catalyst was first reduced under flowing H2 (10 ml/min) at 500 °C for 4 h. The reaction mixture was composed of H2/C3H8, H2/i-C4H10 and H2/C4H10 (molar ratio 0.2) and product compositions were continuously monitored by an on line gas chromatograph (GC7890II), i.e. equipped with FID detector.
Hydrothermal analysis of the Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34 catalyst was carried out in a same reactor up to three consecutive runs; each run had 8 h reaction time. The catalyst was regenerated at 640 °C for 1 h with a nitrogen–steam mixture (50 ml/min) and a steam partial pressure of 20 kPa. After regeneration the catalysts were dried in flowing nitrogen for 30 min and then reduced in hydrogen at 500 °C for 4 h before the next dehydrogenation reaction, similar procedures was adopted for next runs.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
The metallic content was confirmed after successful impregnation of Pt and Sn on support, by using XRF analysis (see Table 1). The surface area of prepared support slit-SAPO-34, and metallic doped catalyst were calculated and results were also shown in Table 1. It is quite conclusive form the results that after metallic doping the surface area of catalyst (Pt(0.5 wt.%)-Sn(1 wt.%)/slit-SAPO-34) was decreased from 520 to 479 m2/g. This decline in surface area was due to the metals layering over the surface of the support. X-ray diffraction patterns of the slit-SAPO-34 and slit-SAPO-34 supported catalysts were explained that the metal incorporation did not destroy the structural topology and texture of novel support. The pattern of the prepared catalyst is identical to the support and XRD structural pattern of Pt(0.5 wt.%)-Sn(1 wt.%)/slit-SAPO-34 is shown in Fig. 1; that is also similar to SAPO-34 pattern. After sequential impregnation of metals, the original structure of the slit-SAPO-34 zeolite remained unchanged. This indicates that the metallic doping during catalyst preparation did not destroy the slit-SAPO-34 structural topology. Most of the Pt metal particles were located on the surface of slit-SAPO-34 due to their large diameter, i.e. 1.4–2.5 nm [37], [38]. Furthermore, no PtO2 species were found in XRD as Pt is well dispersed/interacted on the slit-SAPO-34 [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54]. Interestingly, the intensities of the corresponding peaks of slit-SAPO-34 supported catalyst with SAPO-34 supported catalyst, in particular at angle 2θ = 8–10° decreased a lot that indicates decline in crystallinity, while no peak shift was observed.

It has been long known that the dehydrogenation of light alkanes is dependent on the acidity of the catalyst/support but later it was elaborated that the acidity of support enhances metallic interactions [6], [15], [22]. The weak surface acidity of support and lager surface area is the potential requirement for selective conversion of alkane without taking part in cracking. The influence of Sn on the acidity of the Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34 was determined by NH3-TPD analysis and results are shown in Table 2. Both Lewis and Brönsted acid sites of novel catalysts obtained from the ammonia absorption bands at 1620–1630 cm−1 (peak I) and 1430–1450 cm−1 (peak II) respectively. Generally, Lewis acid sites were consumed by promoter and Brönsted acid sites were consumed by active metals, and somehow blocked by these [22]. The decrease in intensity of Brönsted acid sites makes the catalyst least active toward cracking and improves stereo-chemistry control over olefins [22]. Ammonia adsorption IR spectroscopy analysis of slit-SAPO-34 supported catalyst is in accordance with the NH3-TPD results. Intensity of Lewis and Brönsted acid sites were obtained from the ammonia absorption bands at 1620–1630 cm−1 and 1430–1450 cm−1, respectively, together with many trailing peaks after evacuation at 100 °C (shown in Table 3). This confirms the acid sites presence after metallic incorporation, which is necessary for selective conversion of intermediates to desired product. The reduction properties of the novel catalyst Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34 were found similar to Pt-Sn/SAPO-34 reduction peak [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54]. Oxidation state of promoter is important in elaborating surface density, while its higher concentration leads to alloy formation and results permanent deactivation [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]. The Pt attached to slit-SAPO-34 through SnO is believed to be active for dehydrogenation reaction (Table 4).

It is apparent form the results, that the catalyst shows a relatively less amount of H2 adsorbed at room temperature, in comparison with the adsorbed H2 at higher temperatures (300 and 500 °C), evidently this suggests strength of interactions between Pt and SnOx. That is the active Pt interaction (Pt–SnO–slit-SAPO-34), needed for light alkane dehydrogenation to corresponding olefins. The oxidized Sn species can block zero-valent Pt atoms and/or dilution of the active centers. This may lead to a decrease in concentration of Pt ensembles necessary for the hydrogenolysis reactions and the coke formation. In the hydrothermally treated sample (after iso-butane dehydrogenation reaction) the amount of adsorbed H2 is almost similar to fresh catalyst at different temperatures; it has linear relationship with the intensity of treatment. The catalyst demonstrates remarkable resistance to hydrothermal treatment, therefore, the surface characteristics remains same due to novel support. The results of the hydrogen chemisorptions analysis of catalyst were also consistent with the TEM analysis as shown in Fig. 2. The TEM picture also confirms uniform dispersion of active metal over the novel support surface.

3.2. Catalyst performance analysis
The performance of Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34 catalyst for propane, n-butane and iso-butane dehydrogenation were shown in terms of conversion and corresponding light olefin selectivity in Fig. 3. Catalyst demonstrates initial conversions of light alkanes near to thermodynamical equilibrium limits, i.e. 38.2, 42.5, 40.1 wt.% for propane, n-butane, iso-butane respectively, at optimum operating conditions. The initial lower selectivity of corresponding olefins and higher conversion are due to cracking. Later the reaction shifts toward dehydrogenation and olefins will become prominent product, and selectivity reached above 90%. This dehydrogenation activity enhancement to olefins was not only due to the support control on reaction, but also due to better Pt dispersion and interaction on slit-SAPO-34 support. The results were consistent with our previous study of Pt-Sn/SAPO-34. In overall dynamics of alkane dehydrogenation reaction, the desired product selectivity is important than conversion. As if the cracking products will become selective it is more difficult to re-convert them into olefins. Details of by-product distribution of light alkane dehydrogenation reactions were listed in Table 5. A prominent side reaction that frequently competes with dehydrogenation is hydrogenolysis. Moreover, Platinum based catalyst has higher activity for activating CH bonds and inferior activity for the rupture of CC bonds, resulting in intrinsically higher olefins selectivity.

Table 6 shows the activity decay and olefin's product selectivity w.r.t. time-on-stream over Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34. The deactivation rate was calculated by using the relationship Dr = (X0 − Xf)/X0 × 100, where X0 is the initial alkane conversion at 1 min and Xf was the final conversion at 8 h of the continuous dehydrogenation reaction. It is observed that the catalyst deactivation was mainly due to coke formation and the amount of coke is proportional to the catalyst activity. The coking is due to formation of carboxylates, aliphatic, unsaturated/aromatic hydrocarbon species and large residence time propagate their formation. Furthermore, higher deactivation rate was observed in case of iso-butane dehydrogenation compare with n-butane as most of the iso-butane cant reach to the pores directly owing to larger dynamic molecular diameter.

SAPO-34 and slit-SAPO-34 supported Pt-Sn based catalysts were also found suitable for n-butane and/or iso-butane to propylene with higher olefins content. The higher olefin's/desired alkene product selectivity was achieved between 23 and 25% conversion over slit-SAPO-34 supported catalyst as observed from olefins performance envelop (OPE) in Fig. 4. The data were obtained at varying WHSV and TOS values for each reaction. The reaction mechanism could also be speculated from the product distribution. Over Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34, the first hydrogen was abstracted by reduced metal site via β-carbon of light alkane to form propoxy species; those were selectively converted to corresponding olefins.

Table 7 shows propane conversion over Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34 catalyst and total olefins selectivity for three continuous reaction–regeneration runs at 585 °C and 5 h−1 WHSV. The catalyst exhibits strong stability in hydrothermal regeneration process. As before the second run, the catalyst was regenerated with nitrogen mixed steam for 1 h at 640 °C, evacuated, and then reduced in hydrogen environment again. The similar results were achieved in the next runs after consecutive regenerations. The slight increase in total olefins conversion was noted due to decrease in corresponding conversion. The structure and acidic properties of slit-SAPO-34 is similar with SAPO-34, depends upon the number and distribution of Si in the framework, and make it stable during hydrothermal treatment. These facts give superiority to slit-SAPO-34 support over ZSM-5 and Al2O3, where dealumination occur frequently [22].

Comparison of ZSM-5, SAPO-34 and slit-SAPO-34 supported Pt-bases catalysts with various light alkanes feed shown in Table 8. The result clearly demonstrates the superiority of SAPO-34 and slit-SAPO-34 supported Pt-Sn-based catalysts for dehydrogenation over ZSM-5 supported catalyst. Moreover, higher conversion of light alkane over ZSM-5 is due to higher surface acidity, also most of the feed reaches the pores as their pore diameter is about 0.51 nm × 0.56 nm [55]. On the other hand SAPO-34 and slit-SAPO-34 has 8 ring structure and smaller pore diameter i.e. 0.43 nm [55]. It is obvious from the product distribution that slit-SAPO-34 has similar conversion for propane over SAPO-34, but higher conversion than SAPO-34 for butanes. This superiority in performance is due to better surface diffusion opportunities and shape selective effect. Also slit-SAPO-34 support was inert toward light alkane cracking due to weak surface acidity and higher conversion of light alkanes to corresponding olefins was obtained over Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34.

4. Conclusion
The higher conversion of light alkanes to corresponding alkenes was obtained over Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34 novel catalyst. The catalyst functionality was characterized experimentally by number of physico-chemical techniques, to explain superiority of novel support. The structural topology of support was ensured after metallic in corporation by XRD and its topology is found similar to Pt-Sn/SAPO-34. The acidic profiles confirm the acid sites availability and provide justification for strong metallic interactions. About 96.24% total olefins selectivity with above 90% propylene selectivity, with higher propane conversion was obtained over Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34 during propane dehydrogenation; which is better than Pt-based ZSM-5 and SAPO-34 supported catalysts. It was further noted from product distribution and OPE that the initial higher conversion was due to higher cracking rate than dehydrogenation. The coke formation was inherent problem and related to the catalyst activity, but slit-SAPO-34 supported catalyst managed it in robust manner. Excellent stereo-chemistry control was observed to produce olefins using Pt-Sn/slit-SAPO-34 at 585 °C and WHSV 5 h−1 for light alkane dehydrogenation. The optimum operating space for higher olefins selectivity was obtained between 22 and 25% alkane conversions. The slit-SAPO-34 supported catalyst showed good stability during continuous hydrothermal treatment during consecutive reaction–regenerations. This stability is related to support robustness.
