The supplied document does not relate to propane dehydrogenation to propylene. It focuses on the formation of propane from propanol over platinum catalysts via dehydration-hydrogenation and alcohol hydrogenolysis pathways. While it discusses dehydrogenation steps as part of these reaction mechanisms, the overall process converts propanol to propane rather than propane to propylene. As such, it does not contain information relevant to improvements in propane dehydrogenation catalysts, selectivity, conversion, or stability.
