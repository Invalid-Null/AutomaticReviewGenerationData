Formation of Propane in the Aqueous-Phase Processing of 1-Propanol over Platinum: A DFT Study
Graphical Abstract
Propanol hydrodeoxygenation: Alkane formation in the aqueous-phase processing of propanol over platinum is explored computationally. The reaction pathway varies with the acidity of the system. The catalytic reactions can involve acidic protons, the metal catalyst, and the substrate to give rise to various mechanisms.
Abstract
The reaction pathways for alkane formation from alcohols in aqueous-phase (AP) processing was studied computationally for the model system 1-propanol over flat and stepped surfaces of Pt. We examined the dehydration–hydrogenation (DH) mechanism in an acidic environment and alcohol hydrogenolysis (AH) under neutral conditions. The highest (relative) barrier of the DH mechanism was calculated at approximately 90 kJ mol−1 on Pt(1 1 1), which occurs in the hydrogenation step after cleavage of the CO bond. The highest relative barrier of the AH mechanism, if the CO bond is cleaved on Pt(1 1 1), is slightly higher, 105 kJ mol−1. The corresponding elementary reaction step does not start from the alcohol, but a dehydrogenated intermediate. On Pt(2 2 1), transition state geometries differ somewhat and the highest relative barriers of both mechanisms, AH and DH, are lower by 8–40 kJ mol−1, than the corresponding barriers on Pt(1 1 1).
Introduction
Biomass in (almost) any form is often claimed as “the only practical source of renewable liquid fuel”.1 Therefore, the development of industrial processes for the production of fuels from biomass is of great interest. For such technology, the so-called aqueous-phase (AP) processing of biomass-derived oxygenates is a promising approach.2 It is typically performed in aqueous solution over appropriate catalysts at temperatures around 500 K and pressures of 15–50 bar in a single reaction vessel. H2 and alkanes may be produced, which depends on the reaction conditions.2d, 2i, 3 Alkane formation is typically favored by acidic conditions. The catalyst metal plays an important role. The selectivity for alkanes was found to decrease in the order Ru≈Rh>Ni>Pt≈Pd≈NiSn.2i
Several theoretical studies have explored the reactions involved in biomass processing. Some studies are based on tracking reaction pathways4 and others focus on key reaction steps.5 In this work, we will derive plausible reaction pathways for the conversion of alcohols to homologue alkanes, keeping in mind that there is always a competing reforming pathway that yields H2 and CO2, which was studied earlier.4a We will use 1-propanol as a model for biomass-derived oxygenates to explore their reaction pathways over transition metal catalysts. The catalyst is approximated by Pt(1 1 1) or Pt(2 2 1) surfaces, despite the low activity of Pt for alkane formation shown experimentally.6 However, together with earlier studies on Pt-catalyzed reactions,4a the current work will allow a better understanding of an extended reaction network and allow us to better interpret the parameters of biomass processing over Pt observed experimentally.
Various mechanisms are possible for the removal of the OH group from alcohols. A mechanism often proposed2j, 6b is the acid-catalyzed elimination of water followed by the hydrogenation of the olefinic intermediate (Figure 1 a). We will refer to this mechanism as dehydration–hydrogenation (DH). As the dehydration step is acid catalyzed, this mechanism seems to be in line with the increasing selectivity for alkanes with decreasing pH in the AP processing of oxygenates.2i However, the formation of homologue alkanes in small amounts from various alcohols has also been observed in experiments under neutral conditions;2k, 6 this observation may hint at an alternative mechanism that is not acid catalyzed. To follow up this lead, we also considered the direct reaction of propanol with hydrogen over Pt, which we refer to as alcohol hydrogenolysis (AH; Figure 1 b).

Pathways for propane formation from 1-propanol. a) DH pathway, b) AH pathway. Note that [H+] denotes a proton as a catalyst, which is regenerated after the reaction.
Acid-catalyzed reactions in the context of AP reforming are normally thought to occur at the acidic support (e.g., SiO2-Al2O3) or at the metal–support interface.3a However, we were curious to see whether these reactions can also proceed at the metal surface if acidity is provided by a mineral acid. Indeed, our model was constructed in analogy to experiments over Pt supported on nonacidic alumina in which HCl is added to the solvent.3a
Parts of the proposed mechanisms have been examined in earlier studies. The hydrogenation of propylene is known from studies on propylene isomerization and propane dehydrogenation.7 The catalytic hydrogenation of a double bond using a heterogeneous Pt catalyst has been often explored in experimental8 and theoretical studies.9 The scission of the CO bond of alcohols in the AH mechanism was discussed in the context of alcohol decomposition on Pt5 and various other transition metals.4b, 4d, 4e, 10 In contrast, the dehydration step in the vicinity of a metal surface as well as CO bond cleavage in the presence of H2, which are typical conditions of AP processing, have not yet been discussed in the literature. This mechanistic study will cover all reaction steps for the formation of propane from 1-propanol, thus presenting an overview of possible pathways for the formation of propane.
Results and Discussion
We will first discuss the results of reactions on Pt(1 1 1). We start by presenting structures of pertinent local minima and transition states (TSs) of the DH and AH pathways. Then we describe the resulting energy profiles and present the reaction energies Er and activation barriers Ea. Subsequently, we will examine the effects of stepped defect sites, restricted to the steps with highest relative barriers on the Pt(1 1 1) surface.
The nomenclature used for the complexes and TSs is described in the Computational Methods section.
Reactions on flat surfaces: Pt(1 1 1)
Intermediates of 1-propanol dehydration
The first step of the DH pathway is the dehydration of propanol to form water and propylene. Three intermediate structures were identified for the dehydration pathway. The initial state 1 features 1-propanol, in which a HCl molecule is attached by its H atom to the OH group; the hydroxyl group does not interact with the Pt surface (Figures 2 and S1). Pertinent intermediates of the dehydration pathway are the (formally charged) 1-propyl cation 2 at a top site and the dehydration product, propylidene 3, adsorbed in the di-σ mode in which each olefinic C center is bonded to a Pt atom. A charge analysis of 2 shows that the charge on the alkyl moiety is only 0.1 e, whereas the remaining positive charge is mostly located on the Pt slab. Thus 2 should be interpreted as a propyl radical rather than as a propyl cation.
Transition states of 1-propanol dehydration
We examined two reaction mechanisms for acidic dehydration: an E1- and an E2-type mechanism (Figure 2). The E1-type mechanism comprises two steps. First, the protonated OH group is eliminated (1→2), followed by a deprotonation, or rather a dehydrogenation, at C2 (2→3). In the TS structure 1_2 (Figure 3; Table 1), the elongated distances CO=211 pm and CPt=263 pm indicate activated bonds (equilibrium distances: 147 and 211 pm, respectively). Additionally, C1 lies in the plane defined by its two hydrogen substituents and the neighboring C2 center. Thus this TS structure is similar to that of an SN2 reaction if the metal surface is viewed as the attacking nucleophile and the protonated OH as the leaving group. TS 2_3 features the typical structure of a TS for the (de)hydrogenation of an organic moiety on Pt.9 The alternative E2-type mechanism contains a single step, the concerted reaction 1→3 in which both bonds, CO and C2H, are simultaneously cleaved. For 1_3, we calculated elongated distances CO=223 pm and C2H=136 pm (CH equilibrium distance: 111 pm). These results indicate simultaneous bond cleavage, as expected for an E2-type mechanism. In contrast to 1_2, there is essentially no interaction between the propylene moiety and the available Pt sites; all CPt distances are above 400 pm.

Intermediates of propylene hydrogenation
Next in the DH mechanism, two hydrogenation steps transform propylene 3 into propane 6. These elementary reactions were explored for a model adsorption complex 3’ of propylene without the additional water and HCl molecules (Figure 2). The two intermediates from 3’ to 6 are 4 (1-propyl) or 5 (2-propyl).
The propylene moiety 3’ exhibits essentially the same geometry as 3 (ΔCPt=1.3 pm; ΔCC, ΔCH≤0.4 pm). Although experimental studies suggest at least four surface species derived from propylene on a Pt(1 1 1) surface (V-shaped, di-σ adsorbed, π-adsorbed propylene and, after (de)hydrogenation, propylidyne),7a, 8c, 8d this work continues with the di-σ adsorbed structure as in 3’, which directly evolves from the preceding dehydration reaction and has been shown computationally to be the most stable structure of propylene.7a, 11 The propyl moieties of 4 and 5 are bound at top sites by CPt bonds of ≈210 pm, whereas the propane 6 interacts only weakly with the surface. The shortest HPt distance of 6 is 217 pm.
Transition states of propylene hydrogenation
Structure 3’_4 for the propylene hydrogenation at C2 exhibits C2H=182 pm and HPt=159 pm. It is nearly identical to the structure 2_3, except for the additional HCl and H2O molecules in the latter model, as characteristic atomic distances differ by less than 3 pm. This is consistent with the interpretation of 2 as a propyl radical; see above. In 3’_4 the C2 center that is hydrogenated no longer interacts directly with the surface; in contrast, 3’_5 (hydrogenation at C1) remains adsorbed at a top site through an activated C1Pt bond of 226 pm, which is elongated from 211 pm in the initial state 3’. The structure 3’_5 also features an activated C1H bond of 152 pm, which is 30 pm shorter than the CH bond formed in 3’_4. The C1H distance of 3’_5 is comparable to the TS structure reported for the hydrogenation of di-σ adsorbed ethylene, for which CH distances of 151–154 pm have been calculated.9, 12 In the hydrogenation TSs of both 1-propyl 4 and 2-propyl 5 (4_6 and 5_6), the alkyl moiety and a hydrogen atom are coadsorbed at the same Pt center. Both bond lengths, CH=148 pm and CPt=229 pm, of 4_6 are shorter, by ΔCH=8 pm and ΔCPt=5 pm, than the corresponding values of 5_6.
Energetics of the DH mechanism
All steps involved in the dehydration are reactions in which bonds of the substrate are broken and new PtH and/or PtC bonds are formed. All these reaction steps are exothermic, Er=−26 to −50 kJ mol−1 (Table 1, Figure 2). In contrast to our results for the surface reaction, theoretical studies have shown that alcohol dehydration in an aqueous medium13a or in the gas phase14 is endothermic. Thus, stabilizing the products of bond cleavage by metal–substrate interactions significantly affects the energy profile of the elimination reaction.
We calculated activation barriers Ea(1→2)=61 kJ mol−1 and Ea(2→3)=82 kJ mol−1 for the E1-type dehydration steps. Apparently, the elementary step of dehydration with the highest relative barrier is not CO bond cleavage, but the subsequent CH bond scission, in contrast to the situation in the solvent bulk.15 The highest relative barriers on the surface and in bulk solution differ by approximately 20 kJ mol−1. For the elimination of water from tert-butanol, a barrier of approximately 100 kJ mol−1 has been calculated, related to the formation of an intermediate with an activated CO bond.13a Dehydration at the surface and in the solvent may differ in the nature of the rate-limiting step as the formal propyl cation lacks charge if adsorbed on the metal surface. The alternative one-step E2-type mechanism 1→3 for the acidic elimination in the vicinity of a Pt surface has a calculated barrier of 87 kJ mol−1, similar to the highest relative barrier of the E1-type mechanism. Notably, primary carbenium ions are normally considered unstable in bulk solvent, rationalizing why the E1 mechanism is unlikely for primary alcohols.15 However, we have shown that a system such as 2, in which the metal slab and the carbon moiety can interact, is even more stable than the reactant propanol. This indicates that the energetics and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation step are affected by the presence of the Pt cocatalyst.
The calculated results for barriers show that the dehydration step may occur at the solvent–Pt interface if acidic protons are present in the aqueous phase. The olefin can be formed on the metal surface and be hydrogenated directly. Experimental studies did not detect olefins in the effluent,3a consistent with strongly bound olefins at the Pt catalyst right after their formation. Indeed, the desorption of propylene is calculated to be highly endothermic, Er=114 kJ mol−1 (Figure S2).
We close with some remarks on the model for the dehydration step as the applied approach is somewhat special. Chloride ions in an aqueous medium are known to interact with more than one or two water molecules.16 Therefore, a chloride ion in a realistic situation is better stabilized than in our model. The latter can thus be assumed to underestimate the acidity of HCl. This, in turn, may result in overestimated barrier heights of the reactions 1→2 and 1→3. In that regard, the calculated Ea values could be considered as upper bounds. Modeling hydrogen bonds with generalized gradient approximation functionals (e.g., PW91) may also restrict the accuracy of our results.
The two hydrogenation pathways of propylene, via 1- or 2-propyl intermediates, have rather similar energy profiles. The absolute energies of analogue TSs and intermediates along the two pathways differ at most by 6 kJ mol−1; the reaction energies and relative activation barriers agree within 12 kJ mol−1.
The addition of the first hydrogen atom to propylene was calculated to be slightly endothermic, Er(3’→4)=24 kJ mol−1, Er(3’→5)=19 kJ mol−1. In contrast, the hydrogenation of 1-propyl, 4→6, and 2-propyl, 5→6, were calculated to be essentially thermoneutral (Table 1, Figure 2). On both pathways over flat Pt surfaces, the relative activation barriers of the first hydrogenation step were determined at Ea(3’→4)=97 kJ mol−1 and Ea(3’→5)=85 kJ mol−1, respectively. The relative barriers of the second hydrogenation steps are approximately 20 kJ mol−1 lower, calculated at ≈70 kJ mol−1. Therefore, the hydrogenation of propylene to 1- or 2-propyl has the overall highest relative activation energies of the DH mechanism on flat Pt surfaces. The difference of 12 kJ mol−1 between Ea(3’→4) and Ea(3’→5) suggests the reaction pathway via the 2-propyl 5 intermediate is preferred. Yet, this variation is partly related to the changed stability of the adsorption complexes with coadsorbed propylene and H, which are required for the hydrogenation at C1 or C2, respectively. In absolute energies, the TS structures 3’_4 and 3’_5 differ by 6 kJ mol−1 only (Figure S2).
Intermediates of alcohol hydrogenolysis
During hydrogenolysis, the alcohol will be directly hydrogenated to form alkane and water. We considered various adsorption complexes of propanol as starting structures, which include up to two coadsorbed H atoms; see structures 7 to 11 in Figures 4 and S1. In some of these structures, the propanol molecule interacts through the propyl group (7) or the hydroxyl group (8, 9) with the Pt surface. In other structures, the alcohol interacts only with H atoms adsorbed on the surface (10, 11; Figures 4 and S1). In addition, we characterized the adsorption complexes of 1-hydroxy-1-propyl (CH3CH2CHOH, 12) as well as propylidene (CH3CH2CH, 13’) on a bridging site and on a top site (14). Label 13 refers to the adsorption complex of propylidene in which OH is coadsorbed (Figures 4 and S1). These structures, 12 to 14, are potential intermediates of a reaction pathway in which propanol is dehydrogenated before the CO bond is cleaved. Also 1-propyl 4 and propane 6 occur on these pathways; for their structures, see the discussion of the hydrogenation of propylene. Scission of the alcohol CO bond yields a carbon moiety (propyl or propane) and an O moiety (OH or water), depending on whether the CO bond scission is coupled to a hydrogenation reaction. The structures 15 to 18 correspond to adsorption complexes of coadsorbed cleavage products (Figures 4 and S1).
Transition states of alcohol hydrogenolysis
For the AH mechanism we studied five reaction pathways, which are referred to as AH-I to AH-V (Figure 4, Table 1). AH-I represents the reaction sequence that consists of the dehydrogenation of propanol at C1 (7→12), cleavage of the CO bond in 1-hydroxy-1-propyl (12→13) followed by the hydrogenation of the cleavage products propylene (13’→4, 4→6) and OH to yield propane and water. The other pathways differ from AH-I only in the mechanism of the CO cleavage step on the reaction path. AH-II considers the cleavage of the propanol CO bond without a preceding dehydrogenation (8→15). Pathways AH-III and AH-IV include hydrogen-assisted CO scission steps, in which the CO bond scission and the hydrogenation of C1 (9→16) or O (10→17), respectively, occur simultaneously. In addition, the simultaneous hydrogenation of C1 and O to trigger the scission of the CO bond (11→18) is explored by pathway AH-V. The hydrogenation of an OH group, although part of the overall transformation, has not been covered in the present study. Rather, we refer the reader to Ref. 17, in which this complex topic has been covered in the context of water splitting over Pt.
The TS structures 7_12 and 13’_4 of AH-I describe the (de)hydrogenation at carbon atoms. CH atomic distances of approximately 160 pm, as found in these structures, are typical for these types of TS structures.7b, 9, 12 TS structure 12_13 (Figure 3, Table 1) represents CO cleavage of 1-hydroxy-1-propyl; this structure features an OH group atop a Pt center, PtO=202 pm, similar to the situation in the product 13. Together with the long distance CO=292 pm, this indicates a late TS in which the CO bond is already cleaved and the hydroxyl group is close to its final position. The carbon moiety is attached to a single Pt atom, with CPt=191 pm. This bond is notably shorter than the CPt σ-bonds in the initial state and the product structures 12 and 13, >207 pm, but slightly longer than in top-adsorbed propylidene 14, CPt=189 pm, which can be interpreted as a CPt double bond (Figures 4 and S1).
Compared to 12_13, the TS structure 8_15 features a shorter CO and a longer CPt distance, 217 and 260 pm, respectively (Figure 3, Table 1). The latter distances compare better with those found in 1_2 (Figure 3), which is the TS of the proton-catalyzed scission of the propanol CO bond in the DH mechanism, CO=211 and CPt=263 pm. The main difference between 8_15 and 1_2 is the pertinent bond angle OC1Pt, which is close to 180° in 1_2 but only 81° in 8_15.
In variant AH-III, the structure of 9_16 is comparable to that of 8_15. The CO and PtO distances are similar in both TS structures (Table 1, Figure 3). The distance C1H=175 pm of the adsorbed H is still rather long compared to TS values of approximately 160 pm typical for CH formation/cleavage.7b, 9, 12 Similar to the angle OC1Pt in 8_15, the angle formed by O, C1, and the attacking H atom is also quite narrow, 67°. The structure 10_17 of AH-IV, the simultaneous CO bond cleavage and OH hydrogenation, features a 1-propyl moiety and a H2O molecule (Figure 3). The distances CO=279 pm and CPt=369 pm indicate that propyl neither interacts with the leaving OH group nor with the Pt surface. The distance OH=98 pm shows that the hydroxyl moiety OH has already been hydrogenated to form a water molecule that, in the TS, is not yet adsorbed at the metal surface. Similar features as discussed for the TS structures above also apply for 11_18 of AH-V; the angle OC1H=71° is narrow and the 1-propyl moiety interacts weakly with both the leaving OH group and the attacking H atom, CO=285 pm and C1H=250 pm (Table 1, Figure 3).
Energetics of the AH mechanism
On pathway AV-I, the dehydrogenation of propanol at C1 stabilizes the system by Er(7→12)=−29 kJ mol−1, followed by the endothermic cleavage of the CO bond, Er(12→13)=54 kJ mol−1. The two remaining hydrogenation steps of this mechanism, 13’→4 and 4→6, are thermoneutral. As mentioned, propylidene adsorbs in various ways; however, the adsorption complex 14 at a top site is significantly less stable by 58 kJ mol−1 than complex 13’ at bridging sites (Figure 4). Thus we refrained from considering the former structure in the present study.
The alternative pathway AV-II starts with an O-adsorbed propanol 8 that is approximately 10 kJ mol−1 more stable than structure 7, the H-adsorbed initial state of AH-I. The scission of the CO bond of 1-propanol is also endothermic, Er(8→15)=36 kJ mol−1, as the CO cleavage step 12→13 of AH-I. As mentioned above, in the context of the DH mechanism, the hydrogenation of 1-propyl (4→6) is thermoneutral. Thus it is not surprising that reaction 9→16 of AH-III, which couples CO scission with the hydrogenation of the C-moiety, features a comparable Er=32 kJ mol−1 as reaction 8→15.
All CO cleavage steps discussed so far are endothermic processes that lead to the formation of a surface hydroxyl. This agrees with the fact that water splitting on Pt into coadsorbed OH and H is also endothermic with calculated reaction energies in the range 15–70 kJ mol−1, which depend on whether and how solvation effects are considered.17 The models used in this work do not account for the possible stabilization of the cleavage products, especially OH, by the solvent. From studies on water cleavage over Pt, it is known that surrounding water molecules can stabilize the resulting hydroxyl,17c, 18 which thus renders its formation thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable. Therefore, barriers of CO scission steps to yield OH in the aqueous phase, 12→13, 8→15, and 9→16 (with calculated activation energies of 105–206 kJ mol−1) may well be even lower than the values presented here. At variance with these reactions that yield OH, CO cleavage, if coupled with the hydrogenation of the OH moiety as in AH-IV or AH-V, is slightly exothermic: Er(10→17)=−29 kJ mol−1, Er(11→18)=−28 kJ mol−1. On one hand, this is related to the fact that the initial states 10 and 11 are 15–20 kJ mol−1 less stable than 8 (Figure S3); on the other hand, the direct formation of a stable water molecule is thermodynamically favorable.
The CO bond cleavage step exhibits the highest relative barrier on all AH pathways considered. The lowest of these barriers, Ea(12→13)=105 kJ mol−1 of AH-I, is notably higher than the barriers of the (de)hydrogenation steps, which are 72 kJ mol−1 (4→6) or lower. The barrier of 12→13, the cleavage of the CO bond of 1-hydroxy-1-propyl, is lower than the barriers of the cleavage of the propanol CO bond, irrespective of whether the reaction is hydrogen assisted or not; the latter barriers fall into the range 158–206 kJ mol−1. These findings agree with those of earlier studies on ethanol and other alcohols over Pt(1 1 1)5, 19 and also on reactions over other metals.4d, 4e, 10 These studies show uniformly that CO scission becomes kinetically more accessible once the saturated substrate has been dehydrogenated.
In contrast, coupling of CO bond cleavage with a hydrogenation step has only a limited positive effect on the activation barrier. Compared to the unassisted CO cleavage of propanol, Ea(8→15)=177 kJ mol−1, only the relative barriers of the exothermic reactions 10→17 and 11→18 are reduced, by at most 19 kJ mol−1. However, the absolute energies of the TS structures 10_17 and 11_18 are equal to or higher (i.e., less stable) than that of 8_15. Therefore the lower barriers of 10→17 and 11→18 are a result of less stable initial states, as already mentioned in the context of reaction energies (Figure S3).
In summary, pathway AH-I, which implies an initial dehydrogenation step, seems to be the most likely AH mechanism. Yet, the highest relative barrier of this pathway is approximately 20 kJ mol−1 higher than that of the DH mechanism. Thus the AH mechanism will only be relevant for alcohol processing in a neutral environment. Under these conditions, direct alcohol hydrogenation may be responsible for the formation of (small amounts of) homologue alkanes.6b
Reactions on stepped surfaces: Pt(2 2 1)
Next, we will explore effects of stepped sites on the structures and energetics of pertinent intermediates and transition states. We will demonstrate this on the example of those reactions with the highest relative barriers identified for the mechanisms studied on Pt(1 1 1), that is, for the hydrogenation of propylene in the DH mechanism and for the five CO cleavage steps in the AH mechanism.
Intermediates of propylene hydrogenation
At step sites of Pt(2 2 1), we considered two initial states for the hydrogenation of propylene, to 1-propyl (3 s→4 s) or 2-propyl (3’’s→5 s; Figure S1). In the structure 3 s, C1 is adsorbed at a top site of a (1 1 1) terrace, whereas C2 is bound to a Pt center at the step edge; in structure 3’’s the role of the two sites is exchanged. The attacking hydrogen atom is also bound at the same Pt center at the edge. This structural feature is the major difference to the corresponding initial states on Pt(1 1 1), in which coadsorption of H and C at a single Pt center is not stable. The product moieties 1-propyl 4 s and 2-propyl 5 s are adsorbed on the (1 1 1) terraces of the (2 2 1) surface with structures similar to those of the adsorption complexes 4 and 5 on Pt(1 1 1).

In the TS structures 3 s_4 s and 3’’s_5 s (Figure 3), we note the similar lengths of crucial bonds as on Pt(1 1 1): CPt=231, 227 pm; CH=163, 159 pm, respectively. These values in complexes on Pt(2 2 1) are slightly larger than those of 3’_5 on Pt(1 1 1), but both distances, CPt and CH, fall into the typical range of transition states of hydrogenation reactions on Pt.7b, 9, 20
Energetics of propylene hydrogenation
Similar to the situation on Pt(1 1 1), the hydrogenation of propanol to form 1- or 2-propyl on Pt(2 2 1) can be considered as energetically equivalent (Table 1, Figure S2). Absolute energies of analogous stationary points of the two pathways differ by less than 5 kJ mol−1. Both reaction energies and barriers of the two hydrogenation steps 3’s→4 s and 3’’s→5 s differ by 40–55 kJ mol−1 from the analogous values of the reactions 3’→4 and 3’→5 on Pt(1 1 1). As the barriers decrease notably to Ea(3’s→4 s)=50 kJ mol−1 and Ea(3’’s→5 s)=48 kJ mol−1, the reactions, which are endothermic on Pt(1 1 1), become exothermic on the stepped surface, Er=−20 and −21 kJ mol−1. These changes in the reaction energies and activation barriers from Pt(1 1 1) to Pt(2 2 1) are related to the energetically higher lying initial states of the reactions at steps because of intermediates with C1 or C2 (of propylene) and H centers coadsorbed at a single Pt center (Figure S2). Whereas the energy to reach the coadsorbed structure of propylene and H on Pt(1 1 1) (from a formally infinite separation) is less than 9 kJ mol−1, the corresponding value on Pt(2 2 1) is approximately 25 kJ mol−1 (Figure S2). In view of this difference, it is worth inspecting the values of Ea,inf and Er,inf (Table S1), for which the species are assumed to be initially at infinite separation. For reactions at steps, 3’s→4 s and 3’’s→5 s, we determined Ea,inf to be 76 and 72 kJ mol−1, respectively, whereas Er,inf is slightly endothermic. For the corresponding reactions 3’→4 and 3’→5 on Pt(1 1 1), we calculated Er,inf=27–28 kJ mol−1 and Ea,inf=94–100 kJ mol−1. Thus, the reactions at step sites are both thermodynamically and kinetically favored over the same transformations at terrace sites.
Intermediates of alcohol hydrogenolysis
All TS structures of CO cleavage within the AH mechanism were determined to have rather small angles OCPt/H (Table 1). One may wonder whether the reaction at stepped sites enables larger OCPt/H angles along with presumably lower activation barriers. Therefore, we examined reactions in which the OH group moves to a site at the step edge and the hydrocarbon moiety is formed on the lower terrace.
The adsorption complex 12 s of 1-hydroxy-1-propyl has a similar structure to the analogous complex 12 on the flat surface; the adsorbate binds at a top site on the terrace. As a result of the step, the distance OPt=270 pm is notably shorter than that in 12, in which the shortest OPt distance is 314 pm. In the initial states 8 s of AH-II and 9 s of AH-III, the alcohol is adsorbed through the O center at a top site on the step edge. The H atom that attacks the C1 center in the reaction 8 s→15 s is placed on the terrace to get it close to the C1 center. In the structures 10 s and 11 s, from which the pathways AH-IV and AH-V start, propanol does not interact with the surface, as in the structures 10 and 11 on Pt(1 1 1). The H atom to be added to the hydroxyl group is adsorbed at a top site at the step edge where we assume the water molecule to be formed. The adsorption complexes of the coadsorbed cleavage products on Pt(2 2 1) (13 s, 15 s to 18 s; Figure S1) show OH or H2O at a top side at the edge, whereas the carbon moiety (propylidene/propyl/propane) is located at the terrace of the (2 2 1) surface. For the propylidene moiety in 13 s, only the top-adsorbed structure has been considered as we were unable to locate a stable structure with propylidene in a bridging mode near the step edge.
Transition states of the AH mechanism
Structure 12 s_13 s (Figure 3) of the pathway AH-I is similar to the product structure 13 s with a hydroxyl moiety in the vicinity of propylidene. The distances CPt (191 versus 190 pm) and OPt (203 versus 200 pm) of 12 s_13 s and 13 s are very similar. The only significant difference between these structures is the CO distance, which increases from 241 pm in the TS to 343 pm in the product 13 s. All bonds to be altered in this reaction are readily formed or cleaved at this TS. Structure 8 s_15 s of the pathway AH-II differs significantly from the analogous structure 8_15 on Pt(1 1 1). Although the atomic distances, CO=212 versus 217 pm and CPt=256 versus 260 pm, are similar, the angle OC1Pt=125° is much larger than that in 8_15, 81° (Table 1). A larger OC1Pt or OC1H angle than in the corresponding structures on Pt(1 1 1) (9_16, 10_17, 11_18) is also found for 9 s_16 s, 10 s_17 s, and 11 s_18 s of the pathways AH-III to AH-V (Table 1). The difference between the structure at the step and on the surface is up to 88°. Additionally, in the TS structures 9 s_16 s, 10 s_17 s, and 11 s_18 s at steps the distance from C1 to the attacking H atom or the Pt surface are significantly shorter than in the analogue structures 9_16, 10_17, and 11_18 on Pt(1 1 1). Thus the propyl moiety interacts more strongly with the surface or the attacking hydrogen atom if the reaction occurs at step defects.
Energetics of the AH mechanism
The general trends observed for the reactions on Pt(2 2 1) are similar to those found for the reaction on the flat surface. Reaction steps that involve the formation of surface hydroxyl (8 s→15 s, 9 s→16 s, 12 s→13 s of AH-I to AH-III) are endothermic and those that yield water directly are exothermic (10 s→17 s and 11 s→18 s of AH-VI and AH-V; Table 1, Figure 4). If one uses propanol and H2 in the gas phase, together with bare surfaces as a reference, all TS structures at the step considered are more stable, by 6–65 kJ mol−1, than the corresponding structures on Pt(1 1 1); there is no clear trend for the effect of steps on the stability of initial and product states (Figure S3).
The presence of steps lowers the barriers of the five CO cleavage reactions to different extents (Table 1). With by far the lowest barrier on Pt(1 1 1), CO scission of 1-hydroxyl-1-propyl in AH-I, 12→13 is reduced by only 8 kJ mol−1 to 97 kJ mol−1 for 12 s→13 s on Pt(2 2 1). Despite the strong endothermicity, Er(12 s→13 s)=90 kJ mol−1, and the low barrier of 7 kJ mol−1 of the reverse reaction, this pathway is not unlikely. A rearrangement of the top-adsorbed propylidene in 13 s from the site close to the step edge to a bridging site of the terrace entails a stabilization by approximately 60 kJ mol−1, as estimated by the difference in stability between the structures 13’ (propylidene at a bridging site) and 14 (at a top site) on Pt(1 1 1) (Figure S3).
The barriers of 8 s→15 s (AH-II) and 9 s→16 s (AH-III) are notably lower, by approximately 55 kJ mol−1, than those of the corresponding reactions 8→15 and 9→16 on Pt(1 1 1), 122 and 150 kJ mol−1, respectively. This is in line with the larger OCPt/H angles that indicate less strained TS structures at the step. In 9 s_16 s, the stronger interaction between propyl and the attacking H atom, indicated by the shorter distance C1H=165 pm, compared to 175 pm in 9_16, may also contribute to the reduction of the barrier at the step. At variance, the reaction energies of 8 s→15 s and 9 s→16 s do not change significantly compared to the reaction on the flat surface.
The mechanisms AH-IV and AH-V at step defects, 10 s→17 s and 11 s→18 s, are favored in two ways compared to the analogous reactions on Pt(1 1 1): reaction energies are more exothermic and the barriers are significantly lower. For AH-IV these values are Er(10 s→17 s)=−51 kJ mol−1 and Ea(10 s→17 s)=86 kJ mol−1. This is the lowest relative barrier calculated for any AH mechanism on Pt(2 2 1). This reduced barrier is in part a result of the significantly less stable initial state 10 s compared to structure 10 on Pt(1 1 1) and also to the initial states of other mechanisms, AH-I to AH-III, on Pt(2 2 1), 8 s, 9 s, and 12 s (Figure S3). Similarly, structure 11 s is less stable than 11, which induces analogous changes in the energetics of the variant AH-V on going from a flat to a stepped surface for which Er(11 s→18 s)=−70 kJ mol−1 and Ea(11 s→18 s)=123 kJ mol−1. As the intermediates 10 and 11 are unstable, it is worth considering the activation energies Ea,inf(10 s→17 s)=137 kJ mol−1 and Ea,inf(11 s→18 s)=185 kJ mol−1. These values are significantly higher than the Ea values (Table S1). Thus, these two reactions can be ruled out as the preferred AH pathway at stepped sites.
Similar to the situation on terraces, the CO cleavage reaction at stepped sites with the lowest barrier is 12 s→13 s for which Ea=97 kJ mol−1. As the TS of this reaction does not involve coadsorbed species, Ea,inf and Ea are equal.
Conclusions
For the model system of 1-propanol over Pt, we examined the formation of alkanes from homologous alcohols in an aqueous phase by the dehydration–hydrogenation (DH) mechanism and direct alcohol hydrogenolysis (AH).
On the AH pathway over a close-packed surface, CO bond scission was calculated to feature the highest relative barrier, 105 kJ mol−1; this transformation may occur in a neutral environment. CO cleavage is kinetically easier from the intermediate 1-hydroxy-1-propyl, that is, after the dehydrogenation of propanol. Dehydrogenation will benefit from a low hydrogen concentration, but the overall reaction to yield water and propane will require at least one equivalent H2 per alcohol, which will make the initial dehydrogenation step less likely, which thus hinders the AH mechanism. The dehydrogenation step, required in the AH mechanism, may rationalize why alkane formation is hardly observed under neutral conditions even if high H2 pressure is applied; instead, reforming, to produce H2 and CO2, is the dominant reaction.2g, 3b
In the alternative DH mechanism, the highest relative (rate-limiting) barrier, approximately 90 kJ mol−1 (hydrogenation of propylene), is slightly lower than the corresponding crucial barrier of the AH mechanism. However, the DH mechanism requires acidic conditions to occur; therefore this mechanism is the most likely at low pH. These conclusions also hold for alcohol transformations over stepped Pt surfaces for which pertinent barriers of the most likely variants of both the DH and AH mechanisms are reduced by 10–40 kJ mol−1 compared to those of flat surfaces.
If comparing the crucial barriers of the DH mechanism to those previously calculated for the reforming pathway,4a one can conclude that H2 formation is the dominant reaction over Pt even under acidic conditions, as found experimentally.2i, 2k, 3a The highest barriers of the dehydrogenation of alcohols to form carbonyl compounds (or even further dehydrogenated species) are approximately 60 kJ mol−1,4a that is, notably lower than the barriers of the dehydration step. Once the alcohol OH group is transformed to a carbonyl moiety, the CO bond becomes significantly harder to break.
Computational Methods
We performed plane-wave-based DFT calculations on periodic slab models employing the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP, version 5.2.12).21 We used the PW91 generalized gradient approximation exchange-correlation functional22 together with the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method,23 a cut-off energy of 400 eV, and first-order Methfessel–Paxton smearing,24 with a width of 0.15 eV. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a Monkhorst–Pack mesh25 of 5×5×1 k-points for geometry optimization, whereas energies were evaluated in single-point fashion at the resulting geometries, which invoked a grid of 7×7×1 k-points. The threshold of self-consistent field convergence was set to 10−6 eV for the total energy. Geometries were optimized until the force on each relaxed atom was less than 2×10−4 eV pm−1.
The Pt(1 1 1) surface was modeled by five layers, with the top two layers relaxed, in a 3×3 hexagonal unit cell with more than 1.5 nm spacing between the slabs. The other three Pt layers were kept at the optimized bulk geometry, with PtPt=282 pm. The Pt(2 2 1) surface was modeled in an analogous fashion by a slab in a monoclinic 3×1 unit cell. At its narrowest position, this slab also has five closed-packed layers. Molecular species in the gas phase were calculated using a cubic unit cell of size 1.5×1.5×1.5 nm3, sampling the Brillouin zone at the Γ point only.
We preoptimized transition state (TS) structures with the nudged elastic band method (NEB)26 and the dimer method.27 These approximate TS structures were refined using a quasi-Newton algorithm. All stationary points were verified by a normal-mode analysis.
The charge distribution in selected structures was analyzed by the atoms-in-molecules (AIM) approach.28
In the hydrogenation steps on the DH mechanism and in the complete AH mechanism, no special measures were taken to approximate the aqueous phase over the Pt surface. For the acid-catalyzed dehydration step, we approximately modeled crucial features of the solvent to account for the autoprotolytic character of water. Acidic proton centers are not fixed at specific O centers, but may occur in the whole solvent phase. To reflect this, we included two explicit water molecules in our model in addition to a dissociated HCl molecule (Figure 5). If a HCl molecule releases its proton in aqueous solution, the remaining chloride ion can accept a proton from water molecules in the vicinity, which in turn can accept protons from other water molecules. In this model, the two water molecules represent a proton shuttle, which, in an elementary reaction step, formally transfers H+ from a proton donor to an acceptor at a distant location through the chain of water molecules (Figure 5).29 Such solvent chains as proton shuttles have been used to study the autoprotolysis of water29 and reactions that involve proton transfer/rearrangement in protic solvents.13 In our model, the proton to be transferred originates from a second, dissociated HCl molecule at the Pt surface. The resulting chloride ion does not participate in the transformation of propanol. It is included in the model to ensure a neutral unit cell, fixed at a hollow site of the Pt surface, the preferred adsorption site based on theoretical studies.30 To confirm that results obtained with the proton-shuttle model are comparable to those calculated with a standard model, we analyzed for selected reaction steps not catalyzed by an acid, how the presence of the molecules required for the proton shuttle affects the results of Er and Ea. These quantities changed at most by 9 kJ mol−1. Thus one may consider the data obtained with both types of models as comparable.
