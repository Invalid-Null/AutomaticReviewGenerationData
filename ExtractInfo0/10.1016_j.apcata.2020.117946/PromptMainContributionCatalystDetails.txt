1. Introduction
Ethylene is the main monomer for producing polyethylene, the most widely used plastic in our daily life. Due to its high demand, global production of ethylene is beyond any other organic compounds [1]. Moreover, the demand for ethylene is expected to increase continuously along with population growth. Currently, steam cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons and natural-gas is commercially employed to produce ethylene with ∼85 % selectivity and ∼60 % conversion rate. However, steam cracking has apparent disadvantages: (1) it is an endothermal reaction, demanding for high reaction temperature (800−1000 °C) and leading to considerable energy consumption; (2) the high reaction temperature gives rise to carbon deposition on the surface of catalysts, causing coke deactivation [2,3]; and (3) the complexity of reaction products including acetylene, carbon dioxide, methane and others. As such, it is of immense interest to develop alternative technologies for ethylene production.
Owning to its advantages of exothermal property and less complex by-products [4], oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) to produce ethylene at relatively low reaction temperatures is of great potential. V2O5/Al2O3 [5,6], VOx/SBA-15 [7,8], VPOx [9], Fe-Mn Oxides [10],Ni-Zr-O [11] and many other metal oxide catalysts were developed and found to have promising catalytic performance for ODE reaction. However, the main drawback of ODE reaction is the low selectivity of ethylene at high conversion rate of ethane, which deters its industrial application.
Among all the catalysts used in ODE reaction, MoVTe(Sb)NbOx complex metal oxides exhibit better catalytic performances. Typically, MoVTe(Sb)NbOx contains two major phases: orthorhombic M1 phase with Pba2 space group, and hexagonal M2 phase with P6mm [12]. Among these two phases, M1 is the active phase in ODE reaction. The structural building blocks of M1 phase are pentagonal bipyramidal rings surrounded by five corner-sharing MO6 (M = Mo, V) octahedrons. These pentagonal building blocks assemble in [001] plane to form six- and seven-ring channels [13]. M1 phase nanocrystals grow along the c-axis to form rod-like morphology with [001] acting as the terminal plane, which was reported as the primary catalytic plane for ODE reaction [14].
Over the past two decades, various mechanisms were proposed to explain the high catalytic activity of molybdenum-vanadium based complex metal oxide catalysts. Grasselli et al. suggested “site isolation principle”, in which the orderly arranged metal framework of M1 phase is considered to keep active sites close enough to serve the catalytic function, but also sufficiently apart to prevent reactants and desired products from overoxidation [15]. They proposed that V5+ located in the M1 phase framework takes part in abstracting hydrogen from alkanes, which is the rate-determining step in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. However, Trunschke et al. later performed a series of in-situ experiments on propane dehydrogenation to acrylic acid using pure M1 phase MoVTeNbOx catalyst [[16], [17], [18], [19]]. Her findings suggested that significant changes occur on the surface of M1 phase catalyst during catalytic reaction, including oxidation state and chemical composition. Based on the results, the isolated VxOy embedded in the surface matrix was proposed to be the active species for this reaction. As such, the concentration and oxidation states of vanadium element on the surface of catalysts should have direct impact on catalytic performance. The complex framework of M1 phase may only serve as a support for active surface layer. Then, Chu et al. synthesized pure M1 phase MoVTeNbOx catalysts from the same precursor used in Trunschke’s study, but with different post-treatments, such as steam, hydrogen peroxide and oxalic acid treatments [20]. It was found that hydrogen peroxide treatment increases V5+ concentration on the surface, which improves ODE catalytic performance when compared to other post-treatments. In addition, Ueda et al. proposed another reaction mechanism emphasizing on the functionality of heptagonal rings on the [001] plane of M1 phase MoVOx catalyst [[21], [22], [23]]. His work demonstrated that ethane oxidation dehydrogenation (ODE) reaction mainly occurs in the seven-membered rings channels. Based on this mechanism, the surface areas and micropore volume of the M1 phase catalysts can be closely related to their catalytic performances.
Despite the favorable catalytic performance of MoVTeNbOx catalyst, there is one apparent limitation with regards to its stability. The Te in MoVTeNbOx catalyst is volatile under high reaction temperature, leading to its structural destruction [1,20,24,25]. Compared to MoVTeNbOx, MoVSbOx catalyst that has a similar crystalline structure but without volatile Te element was also found to be active for ODE reaction [[26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]]. However, the stability and mechanism of ODE reaction over MoVSbOx catalyst has not been extensively investigated.
In this study, we investigated ODE reaction over a series of M1 phase MoVSbOx catalysts. Experimental results show that the V5+ in the surface layer of M1 phase MoVSbOx catalyst strongly correlates with the catalytic reactivity. Furthermore, it is interesting to find that overwhelming vanadium content in M1 phase would lead to significant drop in catalytic performance. The pure M1 phase MoVSbOx catalysts synthesized by hydrothermal method were found to have a high catalytic stability. The understanding gained in this study can be applicable in designing other molybdenum-vanadium based complex metal oxide catalysts for ODE reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
In this work, 6 samples with different amounts of vanadium were prepared by hydrothermal method. For convenience, samples with Mo/V/Sb atomic ratios of 1/0.20/0.15, 1/0.24/0.15, 1/0.26/0.15, 1/0.28/0.15, 1/0.34/0.15 and 1/0.36/0.15 were designated as Samples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. The synthesis followed the previously reported procedure [32]. It can be briefly summarized as follows: ammonium heptamolybdate and antimony sulfate were dissolved in water in Beaker A, and vanadyl sulfate aqueous solution was prepared in Beaker B. The two solutions were stirred at 80 °C for 10 min. Then, the solution in Beaker B was transferred into Beaker A with stirring for another 10 min. Afterwards, the resulting mixture solution was introduced into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and hydrothermally reacted at 175 °C for 48 h. The resultant solid was centrifuged, washed and dried at 80 °C overnight. MoVSbOx catalyst containing M1 and M2 phases was obtained after annealing the solid at 600 °C for 2 h in N2 atmosphere. In order to acquire pure M1 phase catalysts, all samples were treated by 15 % hydrogen peroxide solution for 6 h. After centrifuging, washing and drying, six samples with pure M1 phase were prepared.
For comparison, another M1 phase catalyst was synthesized by self-assembly method [33]. The complex (NH4)42[Mo132(OAc)30O372(H2O)72] (Mo132) was first prepared. It was then decomposed into pentagonal bipyramidal rings which are the building blocks of M1 phase catalyst in the presence of vanadyl sulfate and antimony sulfate under hydrothermal condition. Thus, M1 phase was self-assembled without purification and calcination steps. The catalyst synthesized by this method is termed as self-assembled sample.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
All the characterizations were carried out on fresh samples, except for special mentions in the article. Morphology and structures of the catalysts were investigated using SEM (JSM6700 F) and TEM (JEOL-2010). An X-ray Si (Li) ultrathin window EDS spectrometer from EDAX was coupled to SEM for detection of chemical composition. XRD analysis was performed on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kɑ radiation (λ =1.5418 Å). ICP-OES (SCG Fresenius GmbH) was used for elemental analysis. XPS measurements were conducted on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi) with monochromatic Al Kɑ as excitation source. The binding energy data were referred to C1s (284.5 eV) from surface carbon. The surface atomic ratios were calculated according to relative peak areas together with Wagner sensitivity factors [34]. Specific surface area and pore volume were measured using BET method (NOVA 2200e), calculated from N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The Raman spectra were collected using Raman microscope system (Horiba Jobin Yvon Modular Raman Spectrometer) with laser excitation wavelength of 455 nm. The UV–vis DRS spectra was measured by UV-3600 (shimadzu).
The active surface oxygen capacity of MoVSbOx catalysts were measured by ethane pulse injection method. The procedure is summarized in the following: The sample (0.2 g) was loaded into the reactor and then heated to 400 °C in the atmosphere of O2 (5 mL/min) and He (45 mL/min) for 1 h. Subsequently, He gas flow was kept to remove residual O2 in the system for 0.5 h. Afterwards, 250 μL ethane was pulsed into the reactor along with He gas flow for twelve times. Ethylene product was detected by on-line mass spectrometer (QGA Hiden Analytical Ltd). The active surface oxygen capacity of catalyst was calculated by ethylene production.
2.3. Catalytic testing
Ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODE) reaction was conducted in a fixed-bed tubular reactor at atmospheric pressure in a temperature range of 400−550 °C. Typically, 0.2 g catalyst diluted with SiC was loaded into the reactor. The feed comprising of C2H6, O2 and N2 (molar ratio of 3/3/94) was introduced at a total flow rate of 50 mL/min. N2 was used as internal standard for calculating conversion of ethane and selectivity of ethylene. Reactants and products were analyzed by online gas chromatograph (GC 9790Ⅱ, FuLi). Capillary column (Plot Molesieve) connected with TCD was used to analyze N2, CO and CO2, while another capillary column (KB-Al2O3/Na2SO4) connected with FID for ethane and ethylene. Carbon balance was over 95 % based on calculation. The ethane conversion rate and ethylene selectivity were calculated by the following formula:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physical and chemical properties of catalysts
Physiochemical properties of the MoVSbOx catalysts are illustrated in Table 1. A careful analysis reveals that all samples (Samples 1−6) synthesized by hydrothermal method have similar BET surface areas (8.2-10.5 m2 g−1) and pore volumes (11.3–12.8 × 10-3 cm3 g−1). From the results of EDX, the ratio of vanadium/molybdenum increases consistently from Sample 1 (V/Mo = 0.20) to Sample 6 (V/Mo = 0.36), approximately following the trend of elemental ratio in the starting materials. The small ratio variation between the starting materials and the final synthesized samples might be caused by the structural differences of M1 and M2 phases as the M2 phase was dissolved in hydrogen peroxide and washed away. The bulk compositions of samples determined by ICP are also listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the results obtained from ICP are similar to results from EDX. Those results suggest that surface areas and pore volumes of the samples have no clear relationship to their chemical compositions. In comparison, the self-assembled sample that synthesized by assembly method has a larger BET surface area (15.1 m2 g−1) and micropore volume (17.1 × 10-3 cm3 g−1) than the samples synthesized by hydrothermal method. One possible reason might be that the self-assembled sample does not go through the high temperature calcination step in the synthesis process, thus avoiding aggregation.

XRD patterns of the MoVSbOx catalysts without (black line) and with (red line) H2O2 treatment are shown in Figure S1. It can be inferred that the MoVSbOx catalyst without H2O2 treatment contains both M1 (ICSD 55,097) and M2 (ICSD 55,098) phases. The characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ = 6.6, 7.7, 8.9, 22.1 and 27.1˚ are assigned to M1 and 2θ = 22.1, 28.1 and 36.1˚ to M2. After the treatment by H2O2, M2 phase is selectively removed, and thus only M1 phase (red line) is retained in the MoVSbOx catalysts. Fig. 1 illustrates XRD patterns of Sample 1−6 and self-assembled sample. All the samples exhibited diffraction signals that originate from pure M1 phase. This result also shows that the pure M1 phase can be directly obtained in the self-assembled sample without H2O2 treatment.

In Fig. 2a, rod-like morphology is presented for Sample 1. In fact, the SEM images of Samples 2–6 (Figure S2) are similar with a length around 2.5 μm. The self-assembled sample also displays rod-like shape. In comparison to samples synthesized by hydrothermal method, the surface of self-assembled sample (Fig. 2b) is evidently smoother, which may be attributed to the fact that it was synthesized without the heat-treatment step.

As shown in the inserted image of Fig. 3A, the M1 phase catalyst has rod-like morphology. In Fig. 3B, interplanar distances presented in Fourier transform image of M1 phase are consistent with literature values [35]. Combining these TEM results with the above-mentioned XRD patterns, the M1-phase samples exhibit good crystallinity, which are further confirmed by Raman and UV–vis DRS spectra (Figures S3 and S4).

The bulk and surface chemical compositions of M1 phase catalysts were measured by ICP and XPS, respectively. As the surface layer is part of the whole catalyst, there might be a correlation between surface composition and bulk composition. As illustrated in Fig. 4, surface concentrations of both vanadium and antimony have positive correlation with their bulk chemical compositions. Similar results were also reported in MoVTeNbOx catalysts by Sanfiz [36]. Further analysis of Fig. 4 reveals that both bulk and surface vanadium contents increase from Sample 1–6, following the trend in starting materials. For antimony composition, surface concentrations of samples are generally much higher than bulk composition. Since antimony atoms are located in the hexagonal rings of M1 phase crystals, a higher antimony composition on the surface might be a result of steric hindrance effect in these rings, leading to the migration of antimony to the surface of catalysts [25]. The location of antimony might also lead to the flexible content of antimony, which has little relation with the content of other elements, such as vanadium.

In addition to the chemical compositions, XPS also provides valence states of constituent elements on the surface. Fig. 5 shows V 2p3/2 core level spectra of all samples (Mo3d5/2 and Sb3d3/2 spectra of the samples are given in Figure S5 and Figure S6 in Supporting Information, respectively). Binding energies of V2p3/2, Mo3d5/2 and Sb3d3/2, as well as surface metal atomic ratios are listed in Table 2. The data show that both V5+ and V4+ are present in all samples and the ratio of V5+/Vtotal increases from Sample 1–6. It is noticed that only Mo6+ was observed in Sample 1–5, while both Mo6+ and Mo5+ were detected in Sample 6 and the self-assembled catalyst. Interestingly, Sample 6 was synthesized by the same hydrothermal method as Samples 1–5, the emergence of Mo5+ in Sample 6 may imply the charge re-distribution and transfer occurring in Sample 6, possibly leading to the formation of different active matrix on its surface. As regard to Sb element, self-assembled sample only contains Sb3+, while Samples 1−6 have both Sb3+and Sb5+. This can be attributed to the oxidation of H2O2 during purification step in the hydrothermal method [37].

3.2. Catalytic properties
For all MoVSbOx catalysts used in ODE reactions in this work, only ethylene, CO and CO2 were detected as products regardless of reaction conditions. Yielding comparative simple products is an advantage of M1 phase MoVSbOx catalyst as it requires less steps for products separation, thus saving costs [20,38].
For evaluating catalytic performance, the reactions were conducted under the same experimental conditions (Ftotal = 50 mL/min, reactor inlet C2H6/O2/N2 molar ratio of 3/3/94). Fig. 6a illustrates the selectivity of ethylene as a function of ethane conversion over Samples 1−6. These samples show a similar trend, the selectivity drops as ethane conversion increases along with increasing reaction temperature. Higher reaction temperature gives a higher conversion, but a lower ethylene selectivity. It can be found that the catalytic performance improves from Sample 1 to Sample 5 in entire temperature range of the experiments. At a low temperature of 400 °C, Samples 1–5 show a low ethane conversion (<17 %), but a high selectivity to ethylene (>94 %). However, the performances of the catalysts are not very different. With the increase of reaction temperature, ethane conversions become higher along with the decrease in ethylene selectivity for ODE reaction over Sample 1–5. Moreover, the performance differences become more significant at higher temperatures. At 550 °C, ethylene yield of Sample 1 is only 39.9 % (ethane conversion of 51.8 % with ethylene selectivity around 77.0 %). The value reaches 50.0 % over Sample 5 (77.6 % ethane conversion with ethylene selectivity about 64.1 %). It is noticeable that the catalytic activity of Sample 5 is comparable to that of MoVTeNbOx catalysts. For comparison, the catalytic performance of MoVTeNbOx and modified MoVTeNbOx catalysts are listed in Table S1. However, Sample 6 shows the lowest performance for the whole temperature range.

Besides, Samples 1−6 render a continuous increase of ethane conversion with reaction temperature. This property is distinct from the ODE reaction with MoVTeNbOx catalysts on which ethane conversion does not increase or even decreases with increasing reaction temperature [1,20,24,25]. The continuous increase of ethane conversion indicates that the M1 phase MoVSbOx catalysts can preserve their active sites under high reaction temperatures. However, this catalytic performance was not found for self-assembled sample. As shown in Fig. 6b, although the self-assembled sample displays significantly better catalytic performance (32.7 % ethane conversion with ethylene selectivity of 82.3 %) at 400 °C compared to Samples 1−6, its ethane conversion drops with the increase of reaction temperature. Considering the physicochemical properties shown in Table 1, this better performance at lower reaction temperature may be attributed to the larger surface area and micropore volume of the self-assembled sample [[39], [40], [41]]. However, the self-assembled catalyst is not structurally stable under high reaction temperature, evidenced by the formation of inactive MoO2 phase after ODE catalytic reaction at 550 °C, shown in XRD patterns (Figure S7) and Raman spectra (Figure S8). Furthermore, self-assembled sample after 550 °C reaction had slightly lower surface area (12.8 m2/g), which might also lead to the decrease of catalytic performance of self-assemble sample.
In order to study the stability of M1 phase MoVSbOx catalysts, the catalytic performance of Sample 5 was monitored for 36 h at 550 °C under the same reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 7, ethane conversion changes in a small range of 77.6 %- 72.8 % in the first 6 h and is almost sustained for the entire period on stream. Similarly, ethylene selectivity is also quite stable in the test. Furthermore, the XRD pattern of used sample does not change compared with fresh Sample 5 (Fig. S9), which also proves the thermal stability of Sample 5. This stable performance of Sample 5 differs from MoVTeNbOx catalyst, of which ODE catalytic performance is limited by the volatility of Te element [1,4]. Thus, M1 phase catalyst containing Sb element exhibits a higher catalytic stability. XPS patterns of V 2p3/2 of Sample 5 before and after catalytic reaction are shown in Figure S10. XPS spectrum analysis of Figure S10 reveals that the V5+/Vtotal of Sample 5 slightly increased from 0.45 to 0.46 after catalytic reaction. This slightly increase of percentage of V5+ after the ODE reaction agrees with V5+ increment during ODE reaction using in-situ XPS reported by Trunschke’s reports [16,17].

For better understanding the performances of Samples 1−6 for ODE reaction, Arrhenius plots of ODE reaction are shown in Fig. 8. Samples 1–5 give a similar activation energy of 48 ± 4 kJ/mol, while Sample 6 displays a much higher activation energy of 78.6 kJ/mol. This observation possibly suggests that Samples 1–5 may have the same active sites, different from those on Sample 6 [42]. It should be noticed that the activation energies here are lower than reported value (around 80 KJ/mol) using other M1 phase MoV-based catalysts [43,44]. The difference of activation energy can be attributable to the different catalysts employed in our experiments. Besides, over packed catalysts in reaction tube might result in mass diffusion problem, which could also lead to low activation energy.

3.3. Discussion
According to XRD patterns and TEM images, all samples consist of pure M1 phase with good crystallinity. Although Samples 1−6 have similar surface areas and micropore volumes, their catalytic performances are different. This indicates that the surface areas and micropore volumes may not be the only factors affecting ODE reaction over MoVSbOx catalysts.
In this study, we found that the catalytic performance of ODE reaction has a strong correlation with V5+ present on the surface of catalysts. Fig. 9a shows the plot of ethane consumption rate at 400 °C normalized to the weight of catalyst (using ethane consumption per gram of catalyst per second (mol/gcat∙s) as the unit) as a function of the percentage of surface V5+. A positive linear relationship is clearly evidenced for Samples 1–5, except for self-assembled sample and Sample 6. The self-assembled sample exhibits a higher performance, while Sample 6 gives a lower value. To exclude the factor of surface area, we normalized the consumption rate to the surface area of catalyst (mol/m2cat∙s). Indeed, the linear plot can be extended to cover Samples 1–5 and self-assembled sample (Fig. 9b). This observation suggests that the better catalytic ability of the self-assembled sample shown in Fig. 9a can be at least partially attributed to its larger surface area. However, Sample 6 is still located at a very low value although its surface concentration of V5+ is high. The above data demonstrate that ODE catalytic activity of the catalysts arises along with surface V5+of the catalysts within a certain limit. This can be understood because V5+ on the surface of M1 phase MoVSbOx catalyst is involved in the formation of active matrix for ODE reaction. However, further increase of surface vanadium leads to the significant chemical changes in Sample 6. Based on the XPS results, the overwhelming of V5+ and appearance of Mo5+ might indicate the re-distribution of electron density on the surface of catalyst. This would lead to the formation of another type of active sites, consistent with the much higher activation energy of Sample 6 in ODE reaction.

It is well known that the ODE reaction pathway using MoV-based catalysts follows Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [1,17,29,45,46]. The C–H bond in ethane molecule is activated by active surface oxygen to form ethylene, and the reduced catalyst is then re-oxidized by O2 gas molecule. In this work, the capacity of active surface oxygen that involved in ODE reaction was measured by ethane pulse method at 400 °C as depicted in Catalyst Characterizion Part. Fig. 10 shows a postive correlation between ethylene yield rate and active surface oxygen capacity. Sample 6 has the lowest active surface oxygen capacity (0.55 × 10−5 mol/gcat) with a lowest ethylene yield rate (1.38 × 10-7 mol/gcat∙s). Based on the charge re-distribution we have discussed above, lowest active surface oxygen capacity of Sample 6 may be associated with metal-oxygen bonding changes attributed to the overwhelming of vanadium content in the framework. On the other hand, self-assembled sample gives the highest active surface oxygen capacity (4.44 × 10−5 mol/gcat) and the best ethylene yield rate (14.08 × 10-7 mol/gcat∙s). As metioned above, such ethylene yield rate is partially due to its larger surface area. The understanding on the correlation between catalytic performance of the M1 phase MoVSbOx catalysts and surface V5+ concentration and active surface oxygen gained in this study can be useful in developing the new ODE catalytic systems.

4. Conclusion
In this work, a series of pure M1 phase MoVSbOx catalysts with different chemical compositions and oxidation states were synthesized by hydrothermal method. For comparison, the catalyst was also synthesized using self-assembly method. Although catalysts synthesized by hydrothermal method have excellent M1 phase crystallinity, similar surface area and micropore volume, their catalytic performances were found to be significantly different. The MoVSbOx catalyst with the best performance (Sample 5) has a comparable catalytic ability (ethane conversion rate is 77.6 % and ethylene selectivity rate is 64.1 %) to MoVTeNbOx catalyst. Moreover, its excellent catalytic stability was evident when operating under a reaction temperature of 550 °C for 36 h. In contrast, the sample synthesized by self-assembly method shows a better catalytic performance at low reaction temperatures (400 °C), but dropping along with reaction temperature, indicting a poor thermal stability.
The relationship between the chemical states of surface layer and catalytic activity was established in this work. It is further confirmed that V5+ on catalyst surface plays critical roles in the catalytic process. The catalytic performance arises with the concentration of surface V5+. However, the high surface vanadium content together with existence of Mo5+ may lead to the formation of another type of less active sites, resulting in a substantial drop in catalytic reactivity. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to control the chemical composition of M1 phase catalysts for developing highly efficient catalytic ODE technologies.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
