Abstract
Praseodymium incorporated AlPO-5 was synthesized hydrothermally in fluoride medium using triethylamine as template. PrAlPO-5 could be bi-functional in nature since the isolated praseodymium sites acted both as redox and acid sites. The framework incorporation of praseodymium in AlPO-5, and the absence of separate praseodymium oxide phase were confirmed by laser Raman and fluorescence studies. The chemisorbed oxygen on praseodymium sites were identified by ESR. The ex-situ pyridine adsorbed IR spectrum confirmed the presence of Lewis acid sites. The catalytic activity of PrAlPO-5 was evaluated in the synthesis of campholenic aldehyde from α-pinene. The epoxidation of α-pinene through chemisorbed oxygen followed by isomerisation of α-pinene oxide over Lewis acid sites on PrAlPO-5 yielded campholenic aldehyde selectively. PrAlPO-5 was proved to be an active, selective and reusable catalyst.

1. Introduction
α-Pinene is a cheap and renewable source for the manufacture of many fine chemicals [1]. Oxidation of α-pinene yielded products such as α-pinene oxide, verbenol and verbenone, the key precursors for the synthesis of artificial flavors, fragrances and drugs [2], [3], [4]. Acid catalyzed isomerisation of α-pinene oxide produced campholenic aldehyde, trans-carveol and trans-sobrerol, and they are found to be important ingredients in flavor industry [5], [6]. Further, campholenic aldehyde is also an important precursor for the preparation of industrially important compound santalol (sandalwood frangrance) [7]. Hence, selective oxidation of α-pinene is an industrially important reaction. Several researchers reported the selective epoxidation of α-pinene using a variety of oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide [8], [9], [10], t-butylhydroperoxide [11], [12], [13], [14] and molecular oxygen [15], [16]. Eimer et al reported α-pinene oxidation over TS-1 using H2O2 as the oxidizing agent [17]. Timofeeva et al studied the α-pinene oxidation using molecular oxygen over vanadium containing nickel phosphate catalyst [18]. They evaluated the effect of vanadium content on the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Aerobic oxidation of α-pinene is not only a cheap and clean method but also industrially important. Metal oxides and other homogeneous oxidizing agents were non-selective and led to generation of large volume of organic and inorganic wastes [19], [20]. Transition metals and lanthanide incorporated molecular sieves were found to be good catalysts as they exhibited high activity, selectivity and reusability [21], [22], [23], [24]. Lanthanide incorporated molecular sieves attracted much attention as the lone pair of electron interacted with paramagnetic oxygen species and activated it [25]. van der Waal et al reported bi-functional nature of Ti4+ ions in the liquid phase Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) reduction of 4-tert-butylcyclohexanone to 4-tert—butylcyclohexanol [26], [27]. The isolated Ti4+ ions performed the role of both redox and acid sites. Hence, solid catalysts with both redox and Lewis acidic functions could convert α-pinene to campholenic aldehyde via α-pinene oxide. PrAlPO-5 with (Al+P)/Pr ratios 25, 50, 75 and 100 were already reported for the selective oxidation of ethylbenzene using molecular oxygen in air as oxidizing agent [28]. The chemisorption behavior of Pr sites and its role in the benzylic oxidation were mainly focused in that article. The mild acidic nature of PrAlPO-5 favored the side chain (benzylic) oxidation rather than ring hydroxylation.
The catalytic activity of PrAlPO-5 (75, 100, 150 and 200) in the synthesis of campholenic aldehyde from α-pinene is reported in this study. This study revealed that PrAlPO-5 is not only a redox catalyst but also a mild Lewis acid catalyst for the formation of isomerised products. The active sites aided one pot synthesis of campholenic aldehyde from α-pinene.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of PrAlPO-5
PrAlPO-5 molecular sieves were synthesized by hydrothermal crystallization of a gel with the following molar composition: xPr(NO3)3.6H2O: 1.0Al2O3: 1.3P2O5: 1.6TEA: 1.3HF: 425H2O [29]. The typical synthesis procedure is as follows: Aluminum isopropoxide (7.15 g, Merck) was soaked in 50 ml double distilled water and aged for 24 h. In a polypropylene bottle 0.493 g praseodymium nitrate hexahydrate (Indian rare earths Ltd.) was dissolved in ortho-phosphoric acid (4.9 g, Merck), double distilled water (15 ml) and triethylamine (2.8 g, Merck), and stirred for 2 h. This was labeled as solution A. The aged aluminum precursor stirred for 2 h was added to solution A and the resultant mixture was stirred for 2 h. This was labeled as solution B. Then, hydrofluoric acid (0.98 g, Merck) diluted with 5 ml double distilled water was slowly added to solution B and stirred for another 2 h. Finally, the gel was transferred to a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 12 h. The hot autoclave quenched in ice-cold water gave crystallized product, which was filtered and washed several times with water. The crystalline product was dried in an air oven at 120 °C and calcined at 550 °C in air for 6 h at a heating rate of 1 °C/min. The same procedure was adopted for the synthesis of AlPO-5 without praseodymium precursor.
2.2. Synthesis of praseodymium oxide
Praseodymium nitrate hexahydrate (2.18 g) was dissolved in 20 ml double distilled water and then 5 ml aqueous ammonia solution was added to it slowly with constant stirring. A pale greenish precipitate was formed, and it was stirred for another 2 h. The precipitate was filtered, washed thoroughly with double distilled water and dried at 120 °C. The dried sample was crushed well and calcined at 550 °C for 12 h at a heating rate of 1 °C/min.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
The Raman spectra were recorded from 100 to 800 cm−1 using Renishaw inVia Micro-Raman microscope equipped with a near infrared diode laser source (300 mW) for excitation at 785 nm. The fluorescence spectra were recorded using Perkin Elmer LS-45 fluorescence spectrometer. The PrAlPO-5 samples were excited by a light of wavelength 210 nm using a Xenon flash lamb and the emission spectrum were recorded between 450 and 650 nm. 27Al and 31P MAS-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-700 NMR spectrometer. The sample for acidity measurement was prepared in the form of a pellet. The pellet was saturated with pyridine followed by degassing at 150 °C for 1 h. The FTIR spectra in absorbance mode after pyridine adsorption were subtracted from that of the untreated catalyst to obtain the peaks due to interaction between pyridine and acid sites only. The ESR spectra were recorded using Bruker EMX Plus spectrometer at 300, 200 and 110 K with a microwave power of 3 mW and a modulation frequency of 100 kHz. The chemical composition of the samples was performed using Inductively coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES Perkin Elmer OPTIMA 7000 DV instrument).
2.4. Typical procedure for the synthesis of campholenic aldehyde
PrAlPO-5 (100 mg), α-pinene (5 mmol) and chloroform (10 ml) were taken in a three necked round bottom flask (50 ml) fitted with a condenser, and a magnetic pellet was placed inside the flask for stirring. To this heterogeneous reaction mixture, air was purged through aerator maintained at a flow rate of 5 ml/min for 12 h. After completion of reaction, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by filtration and washed with ether. The filtrate was poured into ice cold water and extracted with ether. The ether layer and washings were combined and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The ether layer was evaporated to obtain the product. The product was analyzed by gas chromatograph (Shimadzou GC-17A model) and also identified by gas chromatograph coupled with mass spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Clarus 500) using helium as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1.
3. Results and discussion
The framework incorporation of praseodymium species in the AlPO-5 framework and the nature of active sites resulted by the framework incorporation were explained in our previous work [28]. In this study the framework incorporation of Pr in AlPO-5 is further supported by fluorescence and Raman spectra of PrAlPO-5 molecular sieves.
3.1. Fluorescence spectroscopy
The fluorescence spectrum of PrAlPO-5 is an additional diagnostic tool to establish the framework incorporation. As AlPO-5 framework accepted low concentration of either transition metals or lanthanides, the intrinsic fluorescence of each metal ion was not blocked by concentration. Hence, praseodymium in AlPO-5 framework is expected to fluoresce with significant intensity. Non-framework Pr6O11 is incapable of exhibiting fluorescence exclusively due to concentration quenching. In order to verify these facts PrAlPO-5 was irradiated with UV light of 210 nm and the corresponding fluorescence spectra of PrAlPO-5 (75, 100 and 200) are shown in Fig. 1. The spectra showed three fluorescence maxima at 479, 510 and 625 nm covering the visible and near IR region [30]. The peak at 479 nm was narrow while the peaks at 510 and 625 nm were broad. The appearance of fluorescence peaks unambiguously established framework incorporation of Pr3+ in AlPO-5. The peaks around 479 and 510 nm assigned to the fluorescence emission of Pr3+ electrons from excited 3P0 to ground state 3H4 and 3H5 respectively. The fluorescence peak around 625 nm is assigned to transition between excited 1D2 and 3H4 energy states. The appearance of sharp peak attributed to the shielding of 4f subshells by the outer 5d orbitals. The same materials did not show any absorbance peak from 450 to 650 nm region but the maxima were observed only in the fluorescence spectrum. The DRSUV–Vis spectrum of PrAlPO-5 showed absorption maxima at 210 and 250 nm [28]. But excitation of the material with a light of wavelength 210 nm, the fluorescence was not observed as a mirror image of such excitation as fluorescence was not observed until 450 nm. This established vibrational cascade due to surrounding oxygen sites. The fluorescence peak at 479 nm was sharp and Gaussian compared to the peak at 510 nm. So the potential well of high energy fluorescence peak at 479 nm was shorter and deeper than that of the second one at 510 nm. The transition between 3HJ (J = 4–6) and 3P0 energy states can also be estimated by Judd–Ofelt theory.

3.2. Raman spectroscopy
The Raman spectra of Pr6O11, assynthesized PrAlPO-5 (75 and 200) and calcined PrAlPO-5 (75) were recorded between 100 and 800 cm−1 and the spectra are shown in Fig. 2. The Raman spectrum of Pr6O11 showed characteristic bands around 158, 243, 279 and 543 cm−1. Naydenov et al reported Raman spectrum for AFI type materials which showed typical bands around 248 cm−1 due to T–O ring breathing and distortion modes at 403 and 502 cm−1 corresponding to T–O–T bending modes [31]. The Raman spectrum of as-synthesized PrAlPO-5 samples showed bands around 259, 410 and 498 cm−1 which is concurrent with characteristic peaks of AFI framework vibration. The band at 410 cm−1 is attributed to breathing vibration mode of the six membered rings [32]. The calcined PrAlPO-5 (75) showed peak between 398 and 407 cm−1 corresponding to T–O–T bending mode vibrations while the characteristic features of Pr6O11 were absent. The calcined PrAlPO-5 (75) showed intense fluorescence in the visible region. The origin of such fluorescence itself confirmed the framework incorporation of Pr in AlPO-5. If praseodymium was not incorporated in the framework, then the Raman spectrum of calcined PrAlPO-5 revealed the characteristic features of Pr6O11. The intense fluorescence exhibited by Pr3+ ions suppressed some of the bands corresponding to T–O ring breathing vibration and T–O–T bending vibration.

3.3. Electron Spin Resonance spectroscopy (ESR)
The ESR spectra of PrAlPO-5(75, 100, 150 and 200) recorded at room temperature are shown in Fig. 3. All the four spectra showed signals around g values of 1.9 and 3.4 due to paramagnetic praseodymium species. PrAlPO-5 (200, 150 and 100) showed sharp ESR signals due to oxygen chemisorbed on Pr3+ sites whereas PrAlPO-5 (75) showed broad and resolved signals for free Pr3+ and Pr4+ sites. The ionic radii of Pr3+ (99 pm) is greater than Pr4+ (85 pm) which is still larger than the ionic radii of Al3+ (39 pm). When Pr3+ replaces the Al3+ in the AlPO-5 framework it might create a ring strain though there is no structure collapse. In order to avoid such a ring strain, part of Pr3+ species was oxidized to Pr4+ by chemisorbed oxygen. Hence well resolved signals for Pr3+ and Pr4+ appeared in the ESR spectrum of PrAlPO-5 (75). The ESR signal close to g value of 2.0 is attributed to oxygen chemisorbed on praseodymium species. Similar observations were already reported for metal incorporated aluminophosphates [33], [34].

Lu et al reported that the signal with similar g value of 2.0 was assigned to framework defects in AlPO-5 (γ- irradiated). The defective sites will not remain as such and it chemisorbed atmospheric oxygen easily [35]. Hence the ESR peak observed in γ- irradiated AlPO is essentially due to chemisorbed oxygen on the defective framework. Kathleen et al reported the magnetic behavior of pthalocyanine ligands that exhibited a strong magnetic interaction with lanthanide f-electrons and trivalent Pr in bis(pthalocyaninato) complexes which showed a spin resonance signal at g equal to 2.0 [36]. The low temperature ESR spectra of PrAlPO-5 (75) recorded at 200 and 110 K (Fig. 4) showed two distinct peaks at g equal to 2.0 and 2.045. The former g value suggested magnetic interaction of Pr species with paramagnetic oxygen molecule, and the later suggested the presence of defective AlPO-5 sites. Thus the magnetic interaction of oxygen with Pr species was confirmed and also supported the framework incorporation of Pr in AlPO-5

3.4. 27Al and 31P magic angle spinning – NMR
27Al MAS-NMR spectrum of PrAlPO-5 (75) is shown in Fig. 5. AlPO-5 exhibited a chemical shift close to 35 ppm for tetrahedral aluminum species [37]. PrAlPO-5 (75) showed an intense peak at 37.63 ppm due to tetrahedral aluminum, and a weak peak at 6.04 ppm due to aluminum in distorted trigonal bipyramidal co-ordination. The broad peak around −15 ppm is assigned to aluminum in octahedral co-ordination. The paramagnetic praseodymium species present in the framework delocalized the unpaired electron through oxygen linkage which led to the appearance of negative signals in the spectra.

The 31P MAS-NMR spectrum of PrAlPO-5 (75) (Fig. 6.) exhibited a strong peak at −27.52 ppm along with a shoulder peak at −31.21 ppm in contrast to a peak at −24.6 ppm for AlPO-5 [38]. The appearance of two resonance signals confirmed the framework substitution of Pr for Al.Further, 31P MAS-NMR spectrum showed spinning side bands due to dipolar interaction with paramagnetic praseodymium species. The MAS-NMR spectral study thus confirmed the framework incorporation of praseodymium by replacing both Al and P ions in the framework of AlPO-5

3.5. Characterization of acid sites
The pyridine adsorbed IR spectra of PrAlPO-5 (75, 100 and 150) are shown in Fig. 7. The adsorption of pyridine on PrAlPO-5 led to the formation of coordinated bands around 1445, 1490 and 1598 cm−1 [39], [40]. These are the characteristic bands of Lewis acid sites present in a solid acid catalyst. The very weak band around 1547 cm−1 suggested the presence a few Bronsted acid sites in PrAlPO-5.

3.6. Catalytic activity
Liquid phase aerobic oxidation of α-pinene was carried out in chloroform solvent with a view to obtain selective oxidation products over PrAlPO-5 molecular sieves in the temperature range of 30–70 °C. Campholenic aldehyde was found to be the major product after 12 h reaction time whereas α-pinene oxide, verbenol and verbenone were identified as the minor products in the liquid phase oxidation. The influence of reaction parameters such as temperature, reaction time, solvent and Pr content in AlPO-5 was also studied. The formation of campholenic aldehyde exemplified the dual nature of the catalyst. α-Pinene was first converted to epoxide by the chemisorbed oxygen present on the praseodymium sites in PrAlPO-5. The praseodymium sites also contained Lewis acidity which in turn isomerised α-pinene oxide to campholenic aldehyde. Based on the sequence of reaction and product selectivity, a plausible mechanism is proposed as depicted in Scheme 1. In this mechanism molecular oxygen is chemisorbed on the praseodymium sites and the distant oxygen site of chemisorbed oxygen homolytically cleaved the carbon-carbon double bond to form the radical intermediate (1). The radical intermediate (1) rearranges to form α-pinene oxide. Pr-O· (2) formed during the catalytic epoxidation of α-pinene abstracts the allylic hydrogen to form α-pinenyl radical (3). This α-pinenyl radical (3) is acted upon by the distant oxygen site of chemisorbed oxygen to form metal α-pinene peroxide species (5). The peroxide species (5) decompose to form α-pinene oxy radical (6) which abstracts allylic hydrogen of α-pinene to form trans-verbenol and α-pinenyl radical (3). The trans-verbenol formed in the reaction is further oxidised by Pr-OH (4) species to form verbenone. This reaction is essential to generate Lewis acidic Pr sites for the isomerisation of α-pinene oxide to campholenic aldehyde. PrAlPO-5 co-ordinates with epoxide oxygen and forms a carbocation (7). This six membered ring carbocation rearranges to form a less stable five membered ring carbocation (8). The desired campholenic aldehyde is formed by the rearrangement of carbocation (8). The isomerisation of α-pinene to camphene and limonene in acid catalysis requires Bronsted acid sites [41]. The PrAlPO-5 catalyst has very weak Bronsted acidity to isomerise α-pinene in the given reaction conditions. Further praseodymium sites have more tendency to interact with lone pair of electrons in oxygen atom rather than the pi-electron cloud of α-pinene. The proposed reaction pathway is supported by absence of camphene, limonene and generation of campholenic aldehyde in the later stage of reaction. The homogeneous acid catalyzed epoxide ring opening of α-pinene oxide has already been reported [42]. The direction of ring opening is attributed to the stability and conformation of the products formed. In a heterogeneous solid acid catalysed reaction, the surface behavior and porosity control the isomerisation of α-pinene oxide. The PrAlPO-5 catalyst has a small pore opening which restricts the formation of fencholenic aldehyde. Hence, the selective isomerisation α-pinene oxide to campholenic aldehyde is achieved.

3.6.1. Effect of temperature and (Al+P)/Pr ratios
α-Pinene undergoes rapid and non-selective auto-oxidation above 100 °C without the presence of any catalyst [16]. Liquid phase oxidation of α-pinene in the presence of air was carried over PrAlPO-5 (75, 100, 150 and 200) catalysts in the temperature range 30–70 °C using chloroform as the solvent and the experimental results are presented in Table 1. α-Pinene conversion and campholenic aldehyde selectivity increased with increase in temperature. The selectivity to α-pinene oxide decreased with increase in temperature whereas selectivity to verbenol increased slightly. The reaction temperature was maintained at 70 °C for 12 h to obtain the highest α-pinene conversion with high selectivity to campholenic aldehyde. It is concluded that 70 °C is the optimum temperature for the synthesis of campholenic aldehyde from α-pinene.

PrAlPO-5 with (Al+P)/Pr ratio 75 showed higher selectivity to campholenic aldehyde than others at 70°C. Since Pr content in PrAlPO-5 (75) was high, it possessed large number of Lewis acid sites. The high concentration of Lewis acid sites increased the isomerisation of α-pinene oxide to campholenic aldehyde. It was found that α-pinene conversion increased with increase in praseodymium content. Hence, it was concluded that PrAlPO-5 (75) was better than others for the synthesis of campholenic aldehyde from α-pinene The 1H NMR spectra of campholenic aldehyde (Fig. S1), α-pinene oxide (Fig. S2) and verbenone (Fig. S3) confirmed the structure of the products.
3.6.2. Effect of reaction time
The influence of reaction time on α-pinene conversion and selectivity to α-pinene oxide and campholenic aldehyde was studied between 1 and 14 h over PrAlPO-5 (75) at 70 °C using chloroform as the solvent and the results are depicted in Fig. 8. The percentage conversion of α-pinene increased steadily from 1 to 12 h reaction time and thereafter stabilized. The selectivity to α-pinene oxide was found to be maximum upto 5 h reaction time beyond that slow decomposition of α-pinene oxide by Lewis acid sites present on PrAlPO-5 (75) yielded campholenic aldehyde. After 5 h reaction time the selectivity to campholenic aldehyde increased suddenly at the expense of α-pinene oxide. This result also supported the proposed mechanism. It was clearly evident that α-pinene oxide was the precursor for the formation of campholenic aldehyde in this reaction. The selectivity to campholenic aldehyde below 5 h of reaction time was low (≤ 12 %) when compared to epoxide selectivity. The high concentration of α-pinene in the initial stage of the reaction was oxidized by chemisorbed oxygen. When the concentration of α-pinene oxide reached sufficient amount it was acted upon by Lewis acid sites on PrAlPO-5 to form campholenic aldehyde.

3.6.3. Effect of solvents
The aerobic oxidation of α-pinene was carried over PrAlPO-5 (75) at 70 °C using different solvents and the results are presented in Table 2. Among the solvents, chloroform and dichloroethane exhibited good selectivity to campholenic aldehyde. Although polar solvents like acetonitrile, acetone, dimethylacetamide enhanced the formation of α-pinene oxide, these solvents favored the isomerisation of α-pinene oxide in to products like trans-pinocarveol and trans-carveol. trans-Carveol was formed as a major product along with campholenic aldehyde when dimethylacetamide was used as the solvent. Non-polar solvents like hexane and cyclohexane aided the formation of campholenic aldehyde with a slower reaction rate than chloroform. Chloroform is more polar solvent than hexane and increase the α-pinene oxide concentration inside the pores which results in easier access to the acid sites [5]. From this study, it is concluded that polarity and basicity of the solvents played a key role in the isomerisation of α-pinene oxide [43].

3.6.4. Catalyst recycling
The reusability and recyclability of the catalyst was checked by dissolving 5 mg each of fresh and spent catalyst in aqua regia and analyzed using ICP-OES. The results showed almost same praseodymium content in the fresh and spent catalyst. The recovered catalyst after the reaction was washed with acetonitrile and dried at 200 °C. The recycled catalyst showed almost same activity upto 5 reaction cycles. This confirmed that leaching of Pr from AlPO-5 did not happen during the catalytic reaction. This result not only confirmed the stability of the catalyst but also the recyclability of the same catalyst upto 5 reaction cycles without loss of activity.
4. Conclusion
PrAlPO-5 with different (Al+P)/Pr ratios were successfully synthesized under hydrothermal condition in fluoride medium. Spectroscopic and other characterization studies clearly evidenced the incorporation of praseodymium into AlPO-5 framework. The decrease of (Al+P)/Pr ratio increased the conversion and selectivity to campholenic aldehyde. The oxidation of α-pinene occurred via chemisorbed oxygen on the praseodymium sites. It is also concluded that Lewis acid sites created by the framework incorporation of praseodymium in AlPO-5 favored the isomerisation of α-pinene oxide to campholenic aldehyde. These results correlated the bi-functional nature of PrAlPO-5. The weakly basic and non-polar solvents favored the isomerisation of α-pinene oxide to campholenic aldehyde. This study concluded that campholenic aldehyde could be selectively synthesized from α-pinene over bifunctional PrAlPO-5 catalysts at 70 °C using non-polar solvents.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
