The given document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation as it discusses properties of nickel oxide and its reactivity towards oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It does not provide any specific details on conversion, selectivity, yield, or other catalytic performance metrics for propane dehydrogenation. Since the document does not pertain to PDH or ODH of propane to propylene, I have indicated "No" for relevance and did not extract any additional information.
