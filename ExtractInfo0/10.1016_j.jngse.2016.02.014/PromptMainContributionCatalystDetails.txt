Temperature-programmed propane dehydrogenation over Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst: Application in kinetic and catalyst deactivation studies
Abstract
The kinetics of propane dehydrogenation and catalyst deactivation over Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst was studied by temperature-programmed reaction. Catalytic runs were performed in a fixed-bed quartz micro-reactor both under constant (620 °C) and rising temperature. The reaction temperature was increased from 600 to 650 °C in such a way that the propane conversion remained the same with time over the deactivating catalyst. A model based on single reversible main reaction and first-order concentration-independent deactivation was used. The model was solved and optimized numerically to obtain the kinetic parameters of the main reaction and catalyst deactivation. Activation energies of 72 and 21 kJ/mol were obtained for the main reaction and catalyst deactivation, respectively. Within 150 h-on-stream, both temperature histories showed the same propylene yield, however the constant temperature operation gave this yield at lower propane consumption. The simulated temperature-time profiles for constant propane conversion showed an upward curvature (that is, accelerating type).

1. Introduction
The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is an important process due to ever-increasing demand for propylene (Heinritz-Adrian et al., 2008):
(1)
The reaction is highly endothermic and is equilibrium limited, consequently, high operating temperatures and low pressures are required for commercially feasible conversions. These conditions, however, enhance side reactions such as cracking, hydrogenolysis and coke formation which reduce the selectivity and bring about catalyst deactivation (Li et al., 2011a).
In commercial practice, chromia-alumina and Pt-based catalysts are employed (Sanfilippo and Miracca, 2006, Bhasin et al., 2001, Andy and Davis, 2004). Platinum shows high activity in dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and is typically supported on high-surface area carriers such as alumina. However, the selectivity is low due to side reactions such cracking and hydrogenolysis. Pt/Al2O3 dehydrogenation catalyst is commonly promoted with tin and alkali metals. Tin improves activity, selectivity and stability since it interacts electronically with Pt, and reduces the “ensemble effect” that favors coke formation (Sanfilippo and Miracca, 2006, Zhang et al., 2006). Tin decreases the adsorption of hydrogen on platinum by electronic effects (Kogan et al., 2001). Tin reduces charge transfer into the empty σ* antibonding orbital of hydrogen thus reducing hydrogen destabilization, hence the chemisorption activity (Aguilar-Ríos et al., 1995). Alkali metals neutralize the acidity of the support thereby reducing cracking side reaction.
Hydrogen is used in some commercial dehydrogenation technologies using Pt-based catalyst to prevent extensive coking despite a slight decrease in the equilibrium conversion. Steam was also found to be a very effective coke inhibitor. Additionally, its function as inert diluent enhances conversion in the equilibrium-limited system by lowering the partial pressure of the reactants (Bhasin et al., 2001).
In some technologies, the reaction is operated in adiabatic reactors and therefore high temperature changes could occur along the reactor bed. As a consequence, the UOP Oleflex process employs 3–4 moving-bed reactors with inter-stage heaters to achieve near-isothermal operation; although the temperature drop could be as high as 80 °C per reactor (Bhasin et al., 2001). This highlights the importance of temperature effects in designing such highly non-isothermal reactors.
In many large-scale reactors, such as those used for hydrocracking and desulfurization of gas oil, and reaction systems where deactivation by poisoning occurs, the catalyst decay is relatively slow. In these continuous-flow systems, constant conversion is usually necessary in order that subsequent processing steps (e.g. separation) are not upset (Fogler, 2006). One way to maintain a constant conversion with a decaying catalyst in a packed or fluidized bed is to increase the reaction rate by steadily increasing the feed temperature to the reactor (Krishnaswamy and Kittrell, 1979, Ho, 1984, Pacheco and Petersen, 1986, Sapre, 1997).
In order to maximize the time-averaged conversion in a flow reactor, constant outlet conversion should be achieved through temperature adjustment with time (that is, by applying a temperature-time trajectory) for an irreversible main reaction and concentration-independent deactivation, provided that the deactivation is more temperature sensitive than the main reaction (Ho, 1984). In the case of concentration dependent deactivation, this strategy can be still an optimum policy for flow reactors under quasi-steady condition. Operating the batch-wise reactor at the maximum allowable temperature would be optimal when the activation energy for deactivation is less than that for the main reaction.
The temperature-time trajectory approach has been used in dehydrogenation of higher (normal C10–C14) paraffins in the UOP Pacol process. In the case of lower paraffins such as propane dehydrogenation, in which deactivation is more rapid and the catalyst is continuously regenerated, this approach is not applied. However, it could be still useful for kinetic studies of the main reaction and catalyst deactivation. Earlier works dealt with simple irreversible reactions giving the temperature-time relationship to maintain constant conversion (Krishnaswamy and Kittrell, 1979, Sapre, 1997).
The kinetics of propane dehydrogenation and catalyst decay over Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst has been studied by both integral and differential methods of analysis (Sahebdelfar et al., 2012, Zangeneh et al., 2013). However, the analysis was restricted to constant temperature operation from which temperature effects cannot be elucidated with a single test run. To the best of our knowledge, the activation energy of catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over Pt-based catalysts has not been reported in the open literature. In this work, the temperature-time programmed results of propane dehydrogenation on commercial Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts are studied and analyzed numerically. Using appropriate kinetics, the rate constants and activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and catalyst deactivations are obtained and compared with those reported in the literature.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Experimental
The commercial Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (Pt = 0.58 wt.%, Sn = 0.7 wt.% and surface area = 187 m2/g) with the trade name DP-803 was supplied by Procatalyse company. Catalyst performance tests were carried out in a fixed–bed quartz reactor (ID = 15 mm) under atmospheric pressure using a mixture of propane and hydrogen as the feed. In each run, 2 g of the catalyst was loaded. The reactor effluent was analyzed for C1–C3 hydrocarbons with an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N), equipped with TCD and FID detectors. The propane conversion, XC3H8, propylene selectivity, SC3H6, and propylene yield, YC3H6, were defined, respectively, as:
(2)
(3)
(4)
where i includes all the components with carbon atoms in the exit gas stream, ni is the number of carbon atoms of component i and Fi is its molar flow rate.
The operating conditions were specified close to commercial plants. The test run durations were between 100 and 150 h being close to catalyst service time between two successive regenerations (i.e., 3–5 days) in Oleflex process.
Two series of test runs were performed. In the first series, a constant reaction temperature (620 °C) was used to study deactivation behavior and catalyst lifetime. In the second series, a step-wise temperature-time program was used to achieve nearly constant propane conversion with time. The test began at 600 °C and then the temperature was increased to compensate catalyst deactivation such that the initial conversion was maintained.
2.2. Method of analysis
For the case of irreversible reactions and an n-th order concentration-independent deactivation,
(5)
the following condition must be satisfied for constant rate or reactant conversion over a deactivating catalyst (Fogler, 2006):
(6)
where a is catalyst activity and k and kd are the rate constants for the main reaction and deactivation, respectively, exhibiting Arrhenius temperature dependences and k0 is the initial rate constant for the main reaction.
In this simple case, the model can be solved analytically to predict the temperature-time relationship in order to maintain constant conversion of reactants (Krishnaswamy and Kittrell, 1979, Sapre, 1997):
(7)
where Ad is pre-exponential factor for deactivation rate constant in the Arrhenius equation, T0 and kd0 the initial (or starting) temperature and initial rate constant of deactivation; and EA and Ed are activation energies of the main reaction and catalyst deactivation, respectively. Eq. (7) shows how the reaction temperature should be increased with time in order for the reaction rate to remain constant. In the case of reversible reactions, however, an increase in temperature will change the rate (and conversion) of the reaction both by kinetic (rate constants) and thermodynamic (equilibrium constant) factors and the resulting model cannot be solved analytically.
A number of kinetic models have been proposed for propane dehydrogenation (Li et al., 2011b, Loc et al., 1996, Lobera et al., 2001). A simple yet fairly accurate one is based-on power-law expressions (Sahebdelfar et al., 2012, Zangeneh et al., 2013):
(8)
where –r' is the reaction rate per catalyst weight, C is concentration, and the subscripts A and B represent propane and propylene, respectively. KC is the equilibrium constant in terms of concentrations under reaction conditions. Eq. (8) shows that the rate increases with temperature both due to thermodynamic and kinetic factors. The high temperatures and low pressures, typically applied in catalytic propane dehydrogenation, shift the equilibrium towards gas phase (that is, nearly empty surface approximation (Cherkendorff and Niemantsverdriet, 2003). Then, some rate expressions such as those developed by Li et al. (2011b) based on a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism simplify to Eq. (8). The propane conversion could be calculated by integrating the rate law over the length of fix-bed reactor by calculating activity from Eq. (5) with n = 1 (Sahebdelfar et al., 2012).
The time-dependent activity can be estimated by numerical integration of Eq. (5) in combination with Arrhenius equation for kd or approximated by Eq. (9) for small temperature rises by ramp:
(9)
where β is the average rate of temperature ramp. Eq. (9) was used in this work for modeling deactivation under varying temperature conditions.
Implicit in above formulations is the assumption of quasi-steady state conditions, that is, the deactivation time scale is much larger than the characteristic time scales of the main reaction and reactants flow rate.
The kinetic parameters were determined by using the model to fit experimental propane conversion data obtained under temperature-time trajectory for nearly constant conversion. This was done by minimizing the square sum errors for conversion using the lsqnonlin routine in Matlab. The aim was to fit the θ = [k kd EA Ed]T vector by minimizing the cost function Fc(θ) defined as:
(10)
At each time tk, Xobs is the observed experimental value and Xpred is the predicted propane conversion obtained by solving the model using ode45 routine in Matlab. To avoid physically unacceptable results, optimization was performed by limiting kinetic parameter evaluations to positive values.
The influence of the reverse reactions on propane dehydrogenation rates was taken into account through the approach to equilibrium (η) which depends on thermodynamic data and on the partial pressures (P) of the reactants and products:
(11)
where KP is the equilibrium constant in terms of pressures. The value of (1 − η) represents the fractional distance from equilibrium (Waku et al., 2004).
The equilibrium constant at reaction temperature was evaluated from Gibbs free energy of formation of the reacting species as reported in the literature (Yaws, 1999).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst test results
Fig. 1 shows long-term performance results of the catalyst at 620 °C. While the activity (in terms of propane conversion) decreased rapidly within the first 100 h on stream, the selectivity remained fairly constant with time-on-stream. The latter can be explained by the structure-sensitivity of the side reactions (e.g. hydrogenolysis) occurring over platinum sites with low co-ordination numbers which are preferably suppressed by coke deposits acting as site-diluents, unlike the structure-insensitive dehydrogenation reaction which can occur over all Pt sites (Resasco, 2003). Similarly, the initial rapid decrease in activity and increase in selectivity can be expressed by preferential deactivation of hydrogenolysis sites on platinum.

To maintain a constant propane conversion, the temperature was increased in three steps from 600 to 650 °C within 150 h Fig. 2 shows typical temperature and conversion plots versus time-on-stream when temperature-time trajectory was applied. Overall, the conversion of propane was fairly well controlled around 0.31 as shown in Fig. 2. Meanwhile, the equilibrium conversions increase with temperature due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. The divergence of experimental and equilibrium conversions with time-on-stream increases the driving force of the reaction.

A careful look at Fig. 2 reveals that within each temperature step a small “exponential decay” similar to that in Fig. 1 is observed in conversion which is compensated by an increase in temperature in the next step.
Fig. 3 shows the effect of increasing time-on-stream, and consequently temperature, on propylene selectivity and propylene yield when temperature-time program was applied. A steady decline is observed in both plots. The selectivity to ethylene (a measure of cracking activity-not shown) increased sharply from ca. 0.7% at the start of run to 21% after 150 h on stream, whereas that of ethane (a measure of hydrogenolysis activity) declined from 6% to 5% under similar conditions. Above 620 °C side reactions become extensive. This can be explained by the ever-increasing role of the non-catalytic thermally-induced side reactions such as cracking which are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction (Resasco, 2003). This figure also account for the limitation in implementation of temperature-time trajectory method. Too high temperatures reduce the selectivity below an acceptable level and also enhance other types of deactivations such as sintering and component volatilization which, unlike coking, are irreversible. A comparison of Fig. 2, Fig. 3 with Fig. 1 shows that when temperature-time trajectory is implemented, the selectivity decreases while the activity remains constant which is in contrast to what was observed in constant temperature operation.

3.2. Modeling results
The applicability of the kinetic models to deactivating Pt-based catalyst could be firstly checked by fitting the constant temperature run data with the model. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the calculated and experimental propane conversions with the estimated values of k = 6.4 m3/(kg h) and kd = 0.015 h−1 (Fc(θ) = 0.0089) at 620 °C. A fair agreement is observed. The constant temperature conversion data could, alternatively, be analyzed by both integral and differential methods of analysis giving similar results (Zangeneh et al., 2013). Earlier works have shown that the reaction is not mass transfer limited under these conditions with Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst pellets of 1.6–1.8 mm in diameter (Zangeneh et al., 2013, Mohagheghi et al., 2007). Therefore, the resulting kinetic parameters could be considered as intrinsic ones.

Table 1 shows the kinetic parameters obtained from fitting the propane conversions under temperature-time trajectory to the model using numerical optimization. The table shows higher activation energy for the main reaction compared with that for catalyst deactivation. Consequently, an increase in temperature increases the rate of the main reaction much more than that of catalyst deactivation which accounts for the applicability of temperature-time trajectory strategy for constant conversion. The endothermic nature of the reaction along with equilibrium limitation further favors this strategy.

From Table 1, the rate constants k and kd could be estimated as 4.6 m3/(kg h) and 0.0058 h−1, respectively, at 620 °C. These values are lower than those obtained directly from the constant temperature run given above (6.4 m3/(kg h) and 0.015 h−1, respectively). This could be due to the strong start-of-run effects in the latter (Fig. 1), as well as, the different rates of side reactions and coke formation under different temperature-time histories as mentioned in Sec. 3.1.
Also presented in Table 1 are the estimated parameters based on the assumption of irreversible kinetics for the main reaction using numerical optimization, which corresponds to the analytical solution given by Eq. (7); although direct fitting of temperature-time data with Eq. (7) could not give the rate constant for the main reaction. The goodness of the fit is comparable to that of Fig. 5. With irreversible reaction assumption, the activation energy values represent the “apparent” ones as they were based on the application of the reaction rates rather that rate constants in Arrhenius equation. The lower apparent rate constant for the main reaction could be accounted for by the occurrence of the reverse reaction.
The fair fits by using irreversible model could be attributed to the small values of approach to equilibrium; which decreased from ca. 0.4 (start of run) to 0.08 (end of run) rendering irreversible assumption as a reasonable approximation. Despite the fair fit, one should note that the irreversible model results could not be extrapolated to higher contact times which shift the reaction to equilibrium-limited regime.
The resulting good fits with an irreversible kinetics allows one to use some of the previous findings for irreversible reactions in the literature to the reversible propane dehydrogenation reaction. As a consequence, although constant-conversion strategy could be implemented with propane dehydrogenation, it would not be the optimum one from economic (i.e. total propylene yield) point of view due to a larger value of apparent activation energy for the main reaction (73 kJ/mol) compared to that for catalyst deactivation (36 kJ/mol). The optimum policy would be working at the highest allowable temperature, along with frequent catalyst regenerations, as is implemented in commercial practice.
Fig. 6 shows the cumulative propane conversion and propylene yield per catalyst weight versus time-on-stream for the different temperature histories with same time-averaged temperature (i.e. 620 °C) using the respective experimental data of Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3. The total propane converted over time (that is, its cumulative conversion) versus time showed nearly a straight line for varying temperature operation which was expectable due to constant propane conversion with time (Fig. 6a). The cumulative propane conversion under constant temperature was relatively higher at earlier times on stream which was due to higher reaction temperature; however, it became lower at the end of catalyst life (150 h). The propylene cumulative yields, in contrast, followed the same trends and were nearly identical at the end of catalyst life (Fig. 6b). On a comparative basis, the constant temperature strategy was superior as it produced same amount of propylene at lower propane consumption. This was consistent with the higher selectivity of this operation mode compared with temperature-programmed operations (Fig. 1, Fig. 3).

Saeedizad et al. (2009) obtained the numerical values of 90 and 140 kJ/mol for activation energies of the main reaction and catalyst deactivation, respectively, for dehydrogenation of higher (C10–C14) alkanes. While the activation energies of the main reactions in dehydrogenation of propane and higher alkanes are rather close, the activation energy for catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation of higher alkanes is larger than that for main reaction and much larger than that of catalyst deactivation in propane dehydrogenation showing that catalyst deactivation is strongly temperature-sensitive in dehydrogenation of higher alkane. This allows commercial implementation of constant conversion policy (e.g. in UOP Pacol process), unlike dehydrogenation of lower alkanes as mentioned above. The deactivation pathways, as well as, coke precursors are very different for lower alkanes and higher alkanes over Pt–Sn–K/Al2O3 catalysts (Praserthdam et al., 2000), which could result in different deactivation parameters. Furthermore, higher alkanes are highly prone to side reactions and coke formation compared with lower alkanes (Bhasin et al., 2001). This accounts for the much lower operating temperature in dehydrogenation of higher alkanes compared to propane (about 150 °C lower in the case of higher alkanes).
The comparatively slower catalyst deactivation in longer chain alkane dehydrogenation is a mere a consequence of working under less severe conditions (lower temperatures and higher H2/HC ratio in the feed).
The results presented in Table 1 imply that the deactivation time scale (≈1/kd0 = 180 h) was much larger than the time scale of the main reaction (e.g. 1/(k0.ρbed) = 5 × 10−4 h) and flow (e.g. residence time within the reactor, Vvoid/v = 3 × 10−4 h), confirming the applicability of quasi-steady state assumption for analyzing the experimental data. In above calculations, ρbed, Vvoid and v are catalyst bed density, bed void volume and volumetric feed flow rates, respectively.
3.3. Activity change with time
Fig. 7 illustrates the calculated catalyst activity versus time with and without temperature-time trajectory application with starting temperature of 600 °C. The former was estimated both with numerical solution of Eq. (5) using the second-order modified Euler method, and the approximate analytical solution (Eq. (9)) using experimental data and the fitted parameters with β = 0.3935 K/h. The results are very close which could be due to relatively short time on stream and low activation energy of catalyst deactivation. The catalyst deactivation is more rapid when temperature time trajectory is applied despite a constant propane conversion, which is due to a higher average operating temperature. The deviation of approximate solution from numerical solution is negligibly small within the range shown, illustrating that the use of approximate solution in parameter estimations could not result in significant error. The curves, however, diverge with increasing time-on-stream.

3.4. Temperature-time profile
Different temperature-rise histories for constant conversion can be obtained according to the kinetic parameters and operating conditions for irreversible reactions, e.g., constant ramp, and accelerating or decelerating rises (Ho, 1984). We obtained the temperature program shape for constant propane conversions by fitting temperature-time dependence with a cubic equation:
(12)
Fig. 8 shows the results for starting temperatures of 580, 600 and 620 °C. The profiles exhibit slight upward curvatures (i.e., accelerating rises). The initial slope and curvature of temperature-time trajectories increases with the starting temperature. The depicted profiles are undesirable as they rapidly increase the temperature to a level beyond which catalyst sintering and support phase-transformation rates becomes appreciable (ca. 650 °C).

3.5. Effect of side reactions
Because of side reactions, propane dehydrogenation selectivity is rather low even in commercial operations (90% in Oleflex process; Bhasin et al., 2001). The dominant side reaction is propane cracking (to ethylene and methane) over Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, especially at higher temperatures and longer times on stream (Sahebdelfar et al., 2012). This was also observed in our data obtained under temperature-time trajectory. Therefore it is noteworthy to evaluate the effect of side reactions on model results for this case study.
The above formulations imply that side reactions were lumped in the main reaction. This seems reasonable because of thermodynamic and kinetics similarities of both reactions (they are both endothermic, first-order in propane concentration and follow first-order decay laws (Sahebdelfar et al., 2012). This can be further verified by the analytical method outlined below.
Eq. (7) could be written as:
(13)
For catalysts of practical interest, kd0 should be very small. Noting that Ed and EA have same order of magnitude, the Taylor series expansion of the logarithm using the first term and further algebraic manipulations results in:
(14)
The same correlation could be obtained when the range of temperature rise is small, which is also often the case in practice. Eq. (14) gives a simple correlation for changing the temperature with time to achieve a constant conversion. It shows, surprisingly, that the required temperature-time trajectory is independent of order of deactivation and activation energy for catalyst decay.
Fig. 9 shows a plot of Eq. (14) for our temperature-time experimental data. Reasonably good fit is observed, from which, the results of nonlinear regression could be checked. Form the slope of the fitted line a value of 1.8 × 106 K h is obtained for EA/(kd0R) which compares well with the calculated value of 1.5 × 106 K h from Table 1 based on non-linear regression results.

With increasing the temperature (moving from right to left in Fig. 9), the role the endothermic cracking side reaction progressively increases. If the lumping assumption was not appropriate over the temperature range shown, i.e., a sharp shift in overall kinetics occurred, then a change in the slope of the line would be observed. However, no transition or change in the slope of the line is observed confirming the lump approximation as a reasonable one.
3.6. Applicability and limitations
It should be reminded that temperature-time trajectory method has been commercially implemented in some processes to compensate long-term catalyst deactivation. However, it is also a useful method to obtain the kinetic parameters and the dependence of the rate to temperature. The method presented in this work is equally applicable for the analysis of long-term conversion data of commercial plants to estimate the kinetic parameters of the catalytic reaction under real industrial reaction environment (Saeedizad et al., 2009).
Although the aim of this work was to maintain a constant conversion of propane with time to investigate the applicability of temperature-time trajectory to propane dehydrogenation reaction, the method presented is also applicable even when the conversion is not constant under the temperature program profile applied. More complex kinetic expressions can also be employed. However, they introduce more adjustable parameters in parameter estimation calculations necessitating larger number of experimental data accordingly.
Finally, it should be pointed out that too wide temperate ranges impact the accuracy of the results. Higher temperatures could result in increasing involvement of side reactions, mass transfer limitations and other mechanisms of catalyst deactivation (e.g. thermal sintering).
4. Conclusions
The analysis of temperature-time trajectory data of deactivating catalysts can be successfully extended for kinetic parameter estimation of reversible reactions with more complex kinetics such as propane dehydrogenation over Pt-based catalysts. The main conclusions are as follows:
•
The activation energy of the main reaction and catalyst deactivation are 72 and 21 kJ/mol, respectively.
•
Compared with temperature-programmed constant-conversion propane dehydrogenation, constant temperature operation results in higher efficiency at the same time-averaged temperature.
•
To achieve a constant conversion, the temperature-time profile shows slight upward curvature. The slope and curvature increase with the starting temperature.

    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
