1. Introduction
Ethylene, an important chemical in the petrochemical industry, is converted to fundamental chemicals such as polyethylene, ethylene oxide, vinyl chloride, and vinyl acetate. Steam cracking of naphtha is mainly used for ethylene production in Europe and Japan. However, ethane is a main feedstock to produce ethylene in the United States and the Middle East because ethane is cheaply available by virtue of the development of shale gas and associated petroleum gas, respectively [1,2]. Steam cracking of ethane, a non-catalytic process, requires high reaction temperatures (1023−1148 K) to achieve high ethylene yield [2]. Additionally, it is necessary to remove carbonaceous deposits from the cracking coils frequently to prevent plugging and increased thermal resistance [3]. As a result, steam cracking of ethane is an energy-intensive process. The reaction temperature can be lowered and coke formation can be suppressed if a catalyst for dehydrogenation of ethane is introduced to the cracking coils.
In general, supported Cr, Ga or Pt catalyst is used for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane [[4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]]. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane is an endothermic reaction, and co-feeding of steam is an effective way for supplying reaction heat. So, the catalyst introduced to the cracking coil is required to inhibit side reactions such as steam reforming. Coke resistance is expected to achieve high ethylene selectivity. Furthermore, an inexpensive catalyst is preferred, rendering Pt and other noble metals unsuitable for these purposes. Moreover, Cr catalysts are cheaper catalysts, but they are known to be deactivated at the initial stage of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane [19,20]. Our earlier study demonstrated that Ga-Al2O3 catalyst showed high activity for dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of steam [21]. Zheng et al. reported tetrahedrally coordinated Ga sites in Ga2O3 as active sites for propane dehydrogenation indicates that CH bond cleavage in light alkanes proceeds at tetrahedrally coordinated Ga sites [9]. The K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) results obtained for Ga showed that β-Ga2O3 exists on the γ-Al2O3 support. The supported β-Ga2O3 catalyst had a greater amount of tetrahedrally coordinated Ga than the unsupported one. Therefore, tetrahedrally coordinated Ga sites in β-Ga2O3 are effective active sites for the dehydrogenation of ethane [21]. Considering the practical use of the catalyst together with a famous cracking coil AFTALLOY (Kubota Corp.) [22], the use of the α-Al2O3 support is desirable for application of the Ga catalyst because the inner wall of AFTALLOY consists of α-Al2O3. In this work, we use α-Al2O3 support as a model of its inner wall to reflect the real situation. To achieve high catalytic activity, we added a second metal to Ga-α-Al2O3 catalyst to improve its catalytic performance. Results demonstrated that Ba-modified Ga-α-Al2O3 showed higher activity, ethylene selectivity and lower carbon deposition than Ga-α-Al2O3. Various characterizations including theoretical investigation have been conducted to elucidate the effects of Ba addition on catalytic activity, selectivity, and coke formation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
To obtain α-Al2O3, γ-Al2O3 (JRC-ALO-6; Catalysis Society of Japan) was calcined at 1573 K in static air for 3 h. Then Ga and a second metal (M) were loaded on α-Al2O3 using a co-impregnation method. The metal precursors of the second metals are summarized in Table S1. First, α-Al2O3 in distilled water (ca. 15.8 mL g−1) was stirred with a rotary evaporator for 2 h in vacuo. Subsequently, an aqueous solution of Ga(NO3)3·nH2O (n = 7−9) and a second metal precursor were added to the slurry. The Ga content was fixed at 5 wt%. The M/Ga molar ratio was 0.20. Then, the slurry was stirred for 2 h at atmospheric pressure. After the solvent was evaporated with a hot stirrer, the catalyst was dried overnight at 393 K with an oven, and then calcined at 1323 K in static air for 3 h. The catalysts for catalytic activity testing were sieved to 425–850 μm. Samples of Ba-modified Ga-α-Al2O3 with various Ba/Ga molar ratios were prepared using the same method.
2.2. Catalytic activity tests
Catalytic activity tests were conducted at atmospheric pressure in a fixed bed flow-type quartz tube reactor (i.d., 4 mm; o.d., 6 mm). The catalyst (100 mg) was charged in the reactor with SiC (ca. 392 mg). The reaction gas composition was C2H6 : H2O : N2 = 1.0 : 1.4 : 5.5 at a total flow rate of 143.3 mL min−1. The catalyst bed was heated to 973 K in N2 before the reaction gas was introduced. Products including CH4, CO, CO2, and C2H4 were analyzed using GC-FID (GC-8A; Shimadzu Corp.) equipped with a Porapak Q packed column. No other product such as C3 hydrocarbons was detected. CO and CO2 were converted to CH4 through methanation catalyzed by Ru/Al2O3 to detect them using FID. Ethane conversion was calculated as shown below.

In those equations, XC2H6 represents ethane conversion; r denotes the formation rate of each product (CO, CH4, CO2, and C2H4) represented by the subscripts, and ethane feed rate and product selectivity are denoted respectively as fC2H6 and S.
2.3. Characterizations
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using an X-ray diffractometer (Smart Lab-III; Rigaku Corp.) at 40 kV and 40 mA with Cu-Kα radiation. The specific surface area was measured by nitrogen adsorption using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method (Gemini VII 2390a; Micromeritics Instrument Corp.). The samples were heated to 473 K for 2 h under N2 atmosphere before the measurements. The loaded amounts of Ga and Ba were measured using an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) optical emission spectrometer (iCAP-6500; Thermo Scientific).
For the ICP measurements, each sample (ca. 10 mg) was mixed with Li2B4O7 (ca. 1.5 g) and the mixture was heated to 1273 K and hold the temperature for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained transparent material was dissolved in HNO3 aqueous solution (HNO3 : H2O = 3 : 50). To quantify Ga and Ba content, Ga and Ba standard solutions (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) were mixed with HNO3 and Li2B4O7 solutions. The concentration of HNO3 and Li2B4O7 in the prepared standard solutions was the same as the sample solutions.
The amount of carbon deposition was measured by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO). The catalysts (ca. 30 mg) were used after reaction at 1073 K for 24 h. The sample was heated to 873 K for 30 min to remove water in Ar. After the sample was cooled to 373 K, it was heated to 1173 K in 5% O2/Ar at a ramping rate of 10 K min−1. The amount of carbon deposition was calculated based on the weight loss measured using thermogravimetry (TGA-50; Shimadzu Corp.).
To evaluate the electronic state and coordination environment of Ga, Ga K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements were conducted at the BL14B2 of SPring-8 in Japan. The catalysts were mixed with BN. Then 7-mmφ pellets were formed. As a reference, β-Ga2O3 (99.99%; Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corp.) mixed with BN was used to prepare a pellet. XAFS measurements were conducted in transmission mode using a Si (111) crystal monochromator. Analyses of X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) were conducted using software (Demeter ver. 0.9.025; Bruce Ravel).
The electronic state of surface Ga in the fresh samples was measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with an XPS instrument (VersaProbeII; Ulvac-Phi Inc.). XPS measurements were conducted with an Al-Kα X-ray source. The binding energy in the spectra for the Ga 2p peak was referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV.
Phase identification of Ga oxide was conducted using a field emission-scanning transmission electron microscope (FE-STEM) with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer (JEM2100-F; JEOL Ltd.).
Hydrogen adsorption was observed using Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy with a FT-IR spectrometer (FT/IR-6100; Jasco Corp.). The catalyst (130 mg) was shaped to a 10 mmφ self-supported disk placed into an IR cell. First, the disk was heated to 873 K in Ar to remove the adsorbed water. Subsequently, the background spectrum was measured at 323 K. Next, the disk was heated to 873 K again. The IR spectrum was measured in Ar as a reference spectrum. Then, H2 was fed to the disk. The IR spectrum was measured after the peak intensity became stable. The reference spectrum was subtracted from the spectrum after H2 adsorption. The resolution was 2 cm−1. The number of scans was 500 times. The ratio of surface tetrahedrally coordinated Ga to octahedrally coordinated Ga was estimated based on peak areas of Ga-H peaks (2003 cm−1 and 1980 cm−1) [23].
2.4. Computational method
All density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) ver. 5.4.1 [[24], [25], [26], [27], [28]]. The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method [26,28] was used for core electrons. Plane wave basis sets with cutoff energy of 400 eV were used for valence electrons. The adopted exchange-correlation functional was re-parameterized Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (RPBE) out of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The k-point separation in Monkhorst–Pack reciprocal space was 0.04 Å−1. The tetrahedron method with Blöchl correction (σ =0.2 eV) was applied to band occupations around the Fermi level. The van der Waals corrections were calculated using zero damping DFT-D3 method of Grimme. Geometry optimizations were conducted with the conjugate-gradient algorithm. Convergence was assumed to be reached when the total energy change was smaller than 10-5 eV. In all calculations, the spin was polarized.
We constructed β-Ga2O3(111) and β-Ga2O3(002) slab models using four layers containing 16 gallium atoms and 24 oxygen atoms with a 15 Å vacuum layer. The top two layers were relaxed for structure optimization. These surfaces were confirmed by TEM and XRD pattern of β-Ga2O3. β-Ga2O3(111) slab models were considered to be of two patterns: one containing the tetrahedral Ga atoms (Ga(T)-(111)) and the other containing the octahedral Ga atoms (Ga(O)-(111)) in the top layer. β-Ga2O3(002) slab models contained the tetrahedral Ga atoms in the surface (Ga(T)-(002)) and the octahedral Ga atoms in the surface (Ga(O)-(002)). Details are shown in Fig. S1 (Supporting Information). The adsorption energy of ethane and ethylene (ΔE) was defined as
(2.2)
where Emolecule/slab, Eslab and Emolecule respectively represent the energy of the β-Ga2O3 slab with an adsorbed molecule such as ethane and ethylene, the clean β-Ga2O3 slab, and the molecule. The energies of ethane and ethylene molecules were calculated in the 10 × 10 × 10 Å cubic box. In addition, ethylene adsorption energy on BaO(111) and BaO(111)/Ga(T)-(111) was calculated. Structure models are shown in Fig. S2. In case of BaO(111)/Ga(T)-(111), only the top layer was relaxed for structure optimization. All calculation models were drawn using VESTA [29].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Screening for high activity catalyst
First, we conducted screening tests for finding better second metal addition to enhance the performance on ethane dehydrogenation over Ga-α-Al2O3 catalyst in the presence of steam at 973 K. Various M-Ga-α-Al2O3 catalysts with M/Ga molar ratio = 0.20 (M = Ba, Bi, Ce, Co, Cu, Fe, La, Mn, Mo, Ni, Sn, Sr, W, or Zr) were prepared. The ethylene formation rate in a kinetic region (i.e. low conversion condition) versus ethylene selectivity over these catalysts is presented in Fig. S3, and specific values are presented in Table S2. Results demonstrate that an addition of Fe or Ba on Ga-α-Al2O3 shows a higher ethylene formation rate or higher ethylene selectivity than Ga-α-Al2O3, respectively. Each product selectivity over Ga-α-Al2O3, 0.20Fe-Ga-α-Al2O3, and 0.20Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 is presented in Fig. S4. Catalyst with Fe-addition showed higher CO and CO2 selectivity than Ga-α-Al2O3, this phenomenon indicates that the Fe-addition promoted steam reforming of ethane. However, 0.20Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 showed lower CO and CO2 selectivity than Ga-α-Al2O3. Therefore, we assumed that Ba was the best additive for Ga-α-Al2O3 catalyst.
To ascertain the optimum amount of Ba, we prepared xBa-Ga-α-Al2O3 catalysts with various Ba/Ga molar ratios (x = 0, 0.070, 0.10, 0.20, 0.33, and 1.0) and 5 wt% Ba-α-Al2O3 catalyst and evaluated their catalytic activities. Structural and textural characterizations were conducted using XRD, BET, and ICP as presented in Fig. S5 and Table S3. From XRD results, no peak for Ga species was observed, indicating that Ga was highly dispersed on α-Al2O3. However, peaks for BaAl2O4 and BaCO3 were observed with the increase in the loading amount of Ba. As shown in Table S3, the BET surface area of the catalysts was almost identical (about 6.0 m2 g−1). The Ba/Ga molar ratio of the prepared catalysts was almost equal to the desired value. The activity test results are presented in Fig. 1. Specific values of the catalytic performance are presented in Table S4. Although ethylene selectivity increased by Ba addition, the ethylene formation rate decreased concomitantly with increasing Ba loading amount more than 0.1. The result suggests that the excess Ba covered Ga active sites in the catalysts with a high Ba/Ga molar ratio. In addition, 5 wt% Ba-α-Al2O3 showed comparable activity to that of α-Al2O3, indicating that the supported Ba is inactive. However, 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 showed a high ethylene formation rate and ethylene selectivity. Therefore, we found 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 as the optimal catalyst for dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of steam. After the reaction, little changes in XRD pattern and BET surface area of the spent 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 were verified (Fig. S6 and Table S5), indicating 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 is stable even under a hydrothermal condition.

3.2. Catalytic stability and coke formation
The catalyst stability was evaluated by long-term reaction tests. The time courses of the ethylene formation rate and ethylene selectivity are summarized in Fig. 2. For this study, α-Al2O3 was used as a model of the AFTALLOY inner surface (i.e. cracking coil). Thermal cracking of ethane, which is non-catalytic and radical reaction in gas phase, occurred at temperatures higher than 883 K [30]. In the case of α-Al2O3, ethylene formation was attributed to the gas phase reaction because α-Al2O3 shows no catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of ethane. As portrayed in Fig. 2(a), ethylene formation rate on Ga-α-Al2O3 is much higher than on bare α-Al2O3 (i.e. gas phase reaction). Further improvement in the ethylene formation rate was achieved by Ba addition. In addition, 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 catalyst showed higher ethylene selectivity than Ga-α-Al2O3 (Fig. 2(b)) by virtue of the decrease in CO and CO2 selectivity (Fig. S7). These results demonstrate that Ba addition to Ga-α-Al2O3 suppressed CO and CO2 formation, improving not only stability but also ethylene selectivity.

In the present reaction system, possible CO and CO2 formation pathways are ethane steam reforming (3.1), gasification of carbonaceous deposit (3.2), and water gas shift reaction (3.3), as shown in the following reaction formula.
(3.1)
C2H6 + 2H2O → 2CO + 5H2
(3.2)
C + H2O → CO + H2
(3.3)
CO + H2O → CO2 + H2
No report of the relevant literature describes that Ga or Ba catalyst shows catalytic activity for steam reforming of ethane. Therefore, CO and CO2 formation were attributed to gasification of carbonaceous deposits (3.2) and a subsequent water gas shift reaction (3.3). Considering these pathways, Ba addition can be expected to contribute to the suppression of carbon deposition. Also coke formation is attributable to ethylene oligomerization or decomposition. Thus, 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 exhibited higher ethylene formation rate than Ga-α-Al2O3.
The amounts of carbon deposition on spent α-Al2O3, Ga-α-Al2O3, and 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 catalysts were quantified using temperature programmed oxidation (TPO). To evaluate their coke resistance, dehydrogenation of ethane was conducted under severe conditions (at 1073 K for 24 h) because the amount of carbon deposition was too small to quantify at 973 K. The amounts of carbon deposition on the spent catalysts are shown in Table 1. In the case of α-Al2O3, no carbon deposition was observed. The amount of carbon deposition on Ga-α-Al2O3 was 20.6 mg gcat−1, demonstrating that carbon deposition occurred mainly on Ga sites. No carbon deposition on 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 was observed. These results indicate that carbon deposition at Ga sites was suppressed by Ba addition. Therefore, we concluded that the suppression of carbon deposition on 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 contributed to the inhibition of COx formation and stable catalytic activity.

To assess the effects of Ba addition on ethylene decomposition experimentally, the amounts of carbon deposition via ethylene decomposition on Ga-α-Al2O3 and 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 were compared. Instead of ethane, ethylene was fed to the reactor at 1073 K for 7 h; the spent Ga-α-Al2O3 and 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 were obtained. The amounts of carbon deposition on the spent catalysts are shown in Table S6. Although the amount of carbon deposition on Ga-α-Al2O3 was 196.3 mg gcat−1, no carbon deposition was observed over the spent 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3. These results revealed that ethylene oligomerization/decomposition on Ga sites was suppressed by Ba addition.
3.3. Electronic state and structure of Ga
To elucidate the effects of Ba addition on the electronic state of the supported Ga species, Ga-α-Al2O3 and 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 were characterized by XPS. XP spectra of Ga-α-Al2O3 and 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 are shown in Fig. S8. In the spectrum for the Ba-added catalyst, two peaks for Ba 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 were observed at 780 and 795 eV, respectively, corresponded to Ba2+ [31,32]. From the results of XRD (Fig. S5), we observed BaCO3 and BaAl2O4 in xBa-Ga-α-Al2O3 (x = 0.20–1.0). Generally, Ba3d5/2 peaks for BaCO3 and BaAl2O4 are observed at similar binding energy around 780 eV [31,32]. Therefore, these peaks would be attributable to BaCO3 or BaAl2O4. In the Ga2p spectra, peaks for Ga2p3/2 and 2p1/2 were observed at 1118 and 1145 eV, respectively, corresponded to Ga3+ [33,34]. Binding energy for both peaks was not affected by Ba addition, indicating that the electronic state of Ga was not varied whether Ba was added to the catalyst or not.
Ga K-edge XANES spectra and their enlarged spectra around the white lines are presented in Fig. 3. β-Ga2O3 was used as a reference sample of Ga3+ species. The E0 values were calculated as the zero-crossing of 2nd derivative, and these of β-Ga2O3 (10371.2 eV), Ga-α-Al2O3 (10371.6 eV) and 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 (10371.6 eV) were almost the same, indicating the presence of Ga3+ in Ga-α-Al2O3 and 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3. Reportedly, the two peaks for β-Ga2O3 at 10375 eV and 10379 eV are attributed to the tetrahedrally coordinated Ga species (GaO4: called as “Ga(T)”) and the octahedrally coordinated Ga species (GaO6: called as “Ga(O)”), respectively [35]. Although the peak intensity around white line was slightly different, Ga K-edge XANES spectra of Ga-α-Al2O3 and 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 showed two peaks at the same position as that of β-Ga2O3. This indicated that Ga species in Ga-α-Al2O3 and 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 had β-Ga2O3 structure. The Ga(T)/Ga(O) ratio could be calculated from each peak intensity [35]. Compared with the spectrum of β-Ga2O3, a high peak intensity of Ga(T) was observed in the spectra of Ga-α-Al2O3 and 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3. To the contrary, the peak intensity of Ga(O) in the spectra of supported Ga catalysts was lower than that in the spectrum of β-Ga2O3. These indicate the high Ga(T)/Ga(O) ratios of Ga-α-Al2O3 and 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 in comparison with β-Ga2O3. Moreover, since XANES spectrum of 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 was almost the same to that of Ga/α-Al2O3, the coordination environment of Ga in the bulk was hardly affected by the Ba addition.

TEM images and EDX mappings of 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 were also measured to observe Ga oxide. Concentration of each component (O, Al, Ga, Ba) quantified by EDX are summarized in Table S7. As shown in Figs. 4(a) and (b), Ga oxide nanoparticles were observed on the α-Al2O3 support. The interplanar d-spacing shown in Fig. 4(b) is 0.255 nm, corresponded to β-Ga2O3(111) facet [36]. The existence of β-Ga2O3 was verified using TEM in addition to XAFS. EDX mapping for Ba revealed that Ba was highly dispersed on β-Ga2O3 and α-Al2O3. This would indicate that coverage of β-Ga2O3 with Ba affects the catalytic performance because Ba addition had little influence on the electronic state and crystalline structure of Ga.

3.4. Coordination environment of surface Ga
To investigate the coordination environment of surface Ga, observations of hydrogen adsorption by FT-IR were conducted. Collins et al. reported that the surface Ga(T)/Ga(O) ratio can be estimated using FT-IR after adsorption of hydrogen on Ga2O3 [23]. The subtracted FT-IR spectra of hydrogen adsorption at 873 K are presented in Fig. 5. A broad absorption band attributed to Ga-H was observed around 2000 cm−1. To estimate the surface Ga(T)/Ga(O) ratio, peak deconvolution was conducted. In our case, the absorption band was deconvoluted with Gaussian. The results of peak deconvolution of the IR spectra are presented in Table 2.

According to the literature [23,37], band 2 (Ga-α-Al2O3: 1974 cm−1, 0.070Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3: 1975 cm−1, 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3: 1964 cm−1, 0.20Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3: 1951 cm−1) was assigned to Ga(O)-H, and band 3 (Ga-α-Al2O3: 2003 cm−1, 0.070Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3: 1999 cm−1, 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3: 2001 cm−1, 0.20Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3: 1992 cm−1) was assigned to Ga(T)-H. Then, the peak area ratio of band 3 over band 2 (Area3/Area2 in Table 2) shows the exposed Ga(T)/Ga(O) ratio at the catalyst surface. The Area3/Area2 ratios decreased with the increase in the Ba/Ga molar ratios (3.30 → 1.06 → 0.98 → 0.89), indicating that the amount of surface Ga(T) sites decreased by coverage with Ba. Therefore, we deduce from the results of TPO and FT-IR that the surface Ga(T) sites cause carbon deposition. The surface Ga(T) sites would be covered with Ba, leading to the suppression of coke formation. Considering that 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 exhibited the highest ethylene formation rate, the coverage of Ga(T) sites with Ba would be insufficient in case of 0.070Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3. Although the Area3/Area2 ratio of 0.20Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 was smaller than that of 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3, the catalytic activity decreased with the increase in the Ba/Ga ratios (0.10 → 0.20). As shown in Fig. S5, addition of the excess amount of Ba induces the formation of BaCO3 and BaAl2O3. These impurities would be deposited on the active sites, resulting in the decrease in the intrinsic activity.
3.5. Ethane and ethylene adsorption energy and ethylene decomposition
To evaluate the properties of Ga(T) and Ga(O), the respective adsorption energies of ethane and ethylene were calculated using first principles calculation. For this study, β-Ga2O3 was used as a structural model of the Ga catalysts because we experimentally verified that β-Ga2O3 exists in Ga-α-Al2O3 and Ga-0.10Ba-α-Al2O3. We calculated ethane and ethylene adsorption energy on the Ga(T) site in the (111) facet (Ga(T)-(111)), the Ga(O) site in the (111) facet (Ga(O)-(111)), the Ga(T) site in the (002) facet (Ga(T)-(002)), and the Ga(O) site in the (002) facet (Ga(O)-(002)), as shown in Fig. S1. As shown in Fig. S9, two models for dissociative adsorption of ethane (models (a) and (b)) and one model for molecular adsorption of ethylene (model (c)) were investigated. Details are presented in Supporting Information.
The calculated adsorption energy is presented in Table 3. At the Ga(O)-(111) sites, all calculated values of adsorption energy were positive, indicating that Ga(O)-(111) sites are inert for activation of ethane and ethylene, probably because of the highest coordination number of Ga(O)-(111). Of the models (a) and (b), only model (a) at Ga(T)-(002), Ga(O)-(002), and Ga(T)-(111) sites were preferable to dissociative adsorption of ethane because their adsorption energy showed negative values. Adsorption energy of ethylene (model (c)) was negative at Ga(T)-(002), Ga(O)-(002) and Ga(T)-(111) sites, where activation of ethane (model (a)) also occurred. However, tendencies of adsorption energy on active sites were quite different if comparing the adsorption energy of model (a) and (c) at Ga(O)-(002) sites with those at Ga(T)-(002) and Ga(T)-(111). Specifically, the adsorption energy of model (a) was lower than that of model (c) at Ga(O)-(002) and vice versa at Ga(T)-(002) and Ga(T)-(111). Generally, strong ethylene adsorption causes carbon deposition via ethylene decomposition. Therefore, these results indicate that Ga(T)-(002) and Ga(T)-(111) sites are likely to cause carbon deposition rather than dehydrogenation of ethane, and vice versa for Ga(O)-(002) sites. In other words, Ga(O)-(002) sites are suitable for selective ethylene formation without carbon deposition.

Ethylene adsorption energy on BaO(111) and BaO(111)/Ga(T)-(111) was also calculated to verify the effect of Ba addition. Because alkaline earth metal carbonates are easy to be decomposed to alkaline earth metal oxides in the water vapor atmosphere [38], ethylene adsorption on BaO would properly reflect the real situation. Results are shown in Fig. S10. Ethylene adsorption on BaO(111) is unfavorable because its energy was positive values. On the other hand, ethylene adsorption energy on BaO(111)/Ga(T)-(111) was slightly negative. However, the bond length between Ba-C2H4 on BaO(111)/Ga(T)-(111) is comparable to that on BaO(111), indicating that ethylene would physically adsorb on BaO(111)/Ga(T)-(111). Compared with ethylene adsorption on Ga(T)-(111), the adsorption energy greatly increased by the coverage with BaO. Therefore, ethylene re-adsorption would hardly occur on BaO(111)/Ga(T)-(111), resulting in the suppression of coke formation.
The theoretical and experimentally obtained results led us to infer that 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 showed high selectivity and coke resistance by virtue of the coverage of Ga(T) sites with Ba. Based on these results, a schematic image of the effects of Ba addition on surface Ga sites is depicted in Fig. 6.

4. Conclusion
Dehydrogenation of ethane over various M-Ga-α-Al2O3 catalysts was performed in the presence of steam. Results show that 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 (Ba/Ga molar ratio = 0.10) exhibited high ethylene selectivity and stability by virtue of the suppression of carbon deposition. Subsequently, XRD, XAFS, TEM and XPS measurements revealed highly dispersed β-Ga2O3 with numerous Ga(T) sites in Ga-α-Al2O3 and 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3. FT-IR measurements demonstrated that the surface Ga(T)/Ga(O) ratio decreased by Ba addition because surface Ga(T) sites were covered with Ba. First principles calculations revealed that surface Ga(T) sites were more likely to cause carbon deposition via ethylene decomposition than ethane dehydrogenation while surface Ga(O)-(002) sites preferentially promote ethane dehydrogenation. Results show that 0.10Ba-Ga-α-Al2O3 exhibits high ethylene selectivity and durability without carbon deposition by virtue of covering unfavorable Ga(T) sites with Ba.
