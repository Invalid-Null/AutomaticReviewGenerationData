Abstract
Cryogenic separation is an energy extensive process in chemical industries and compression refrigeration (CR) is the most common refrigeration technology with huge energy consumption and carbon emission. Based on the principle and thermodynamic analysis of absorption refrigeration (AR) and CR, this paper puts forward serial AR-CR combined absorption-compression hybrid refrigeration (ACHR) technology as a substitution for traditional CR to conserve both power consumption and carbon emission. Industrial propane dehydrogenation is employed and the ACHR is introduced to accomplish the cryogenic separation by refrigerating temperature and load division. The phase transition of refrigerated streams encompassed by AR is crucial to the performance of ACHR. When the inter-connected temperature is determined to be 6 °C, the optimal refrigeration scenario is obtained. Through partial substitution of AR driven by waste heat for CR, the results show that the hybrid refrigeration can save 48.73% of power consumption and 110.8 GW h of energy per year, which is equivalent to the annual reduction of 39.8 kt standard coal and 0.12 Mt carbon emission. This work demonstrated that absorption-compression hybrid refrigeration is prospective in energy consumption and emission reduction industrially.

1. Introduction
The chemical industry plays an important role in world economic development. In recent years, with the increasing productivity of oil and chemical products, the corresponding energy consumption is also increasing, especially refrigeration capacity for cryogenic separation. Quantitatively, the total energy consumption for ethylene and propylene separation accounts for 0.3% of the global energy consumption (Sholl and Lively, 2016). Specifically, propane dehydrogenation is a significant process to obtain propylene in China, accounting for about 20% of the total domestic productivity. Thus, the refrigeration capacity consumed in propylene separation is very huge. Compression refrigeration (CR) is the most widely used refrigeration method in industry. As the most common refrigeration method, CR almost consumes 80% of the refrigeration industry in the world (Bhatkar et al., 2013). Energy consumption, carbon emission, and equipment investment are the key issue to economic and environmental performance. Therefore, seeking new refrigeration is an important work to improve the technological and economic performance of the process and achieve industrial energy conservation and emission reduction.
The main principle of CR is that the compressed refrigerant absorbs the heat in streams to achieve the purpose of cooling. Specifically, power generation in most developing countries mainly relies on coal combustion and such a situation cannot be changed shortly. Therefore, CR is expensive in operation costs and serious carbon emission (Lin and Li, 2015; Zhang et al., 2020). Dudar et al. (2013) dealt with theoretical analysis of the efficiency increase of CR cycles by the application of a two-phase ejector, which reduces the exergy loss occurring in the throttling valve and diminishing the losses produced in the compressor. Joybari et al. (2013) for a household refrigerator system using R134a as refrigerant, the analysis showed that the most exergy loss equipment is the compressor. Under the condition of minimal exergy loss, the amount of R600a is 66% lower than R134a. To change the traditional on-off control mode of CR, Bandarra et al. (2016) studied the use of adaptive fuzzy hybrid control and design of experiments techniques, as well as the application of the response surface methodology, in a 5 ton vapor compression system with a variable speed compressor and an electronic expansion valve. Results showed that the knowledge of the most relevant parameter of the system allowed for the control system to seek high coefficient of performance (COP) zones. It has been found that this type of technique does not jeopardize the control performance, which remains robust. Considering the large energy loss and low overall efficiency in the adiabatic isentropic compression process. Sun et al. (2020) discussed the application feasibility of a CO2 two-stage CR system with parallel compression and solar absorption partial cascade refrigeration system, a CO2 two-stage CR system was proposed for commercial supermarket applications. Applying of CO2 two-stage CR system in commercial supermarkets provides a theoretical basis. Hu et al. (2021) proposed a modified vapor compression refrigeration cycle with an isothermal piston to realize near-isothermal compression of a refrigerator to significantly reduce the energy loss in the compression process and improve the system performance. Bilen et al. (2022) presented the effect of nano refrigerants on the vapor compression refrigeration system performance, the results showed that the usage of nano refrigerants in the vapor compression refrigeration systems improves the coefficient of performance up to 43.93% and 56.32% in the theoretical and experimental studies, respectively. González et al. (2023) studied the vapor compression refrigeration cycle driven by the organic Rankine cycle and analyzed eight fluids. The results show that the combination of n-pentane and R1233zd has good COP performance.
As an energy conservation refrigeration technology, absorption refrigeration (AR) mainly adopts low-grade waste heat as a driving force to generate cooling capacity and then acquire the refrigeration effect through refrigerant evaporation. At present, the two main industrialized AR technologies are LiBr-H2O and NH3-H2O solution system (Srikhirin and Aphornratana, 2001). Kaynakli and Kilic (2007) discovered that the use of solution heat exchangers and refrigerant heat exchangers can improve the COP of absorption refrigerators. Kalinowski et al. (2009) employed the waste heat of a gas turbine and applied AR to the liquid natural gas recovery process and the results indicate power energy conservation of 1.9 MW with 5.2 MW of refrigerating load. Karamangil et al. (2010) compared the theories of AR and concluded that the refrigerating temperature level, refrigerating load, and performance parameters should be comprehensively considered to increase COP. Garimella et al. (2011) coupled single-stage LiBr-H2O AR and subcritical CO2 CR cycles together to supply intermediate temperature refrigerant for ship system. Compared to a vapor-compression system, it was found to avoid up to 31% of power consumption. Ouadha and El-Gotni (2013) introduced AR into the fishing boat engine and analyzed the influence of operating parameters on the system performance. Results showed that the higher temperature of the generator and evaporator and lower temperature of the condenser and absorber will result in higher system performance. Suleman et al. (2014) conducted energy and exergy analysis for the integrated solar energy and heat pump system, and the results showed that exergy efficiency will be decreased with increasing ambient temperature while increasing with higher condenser pressure. Aman et al. (2014) built a thermodynamic model to analyze the application of an NH3-H2O absorption refrigerator on a solar air conditioner and concluded that the exergy is mainly lost on the absorber. Kaynakli et al. (2015) performed a parameter study of AR with different heat sources and discovered that hot air has the most exergy loss while hot water has the least and thus it is the best heat source medium. Using COP and exergy efficiency as evaluation indexes, Wang et al. (2017) obtained the best match between AR and heat source temperature. Sah et al. (2016) studied the application of refrigerants and absorbents to ice makers to improve the performance of refrigeration systems. Salmi et al. (2017) set up a steady-state thermodynamic model for LiBr-H2O and NH3-H2O cyclic absorption refrigeration applied to ships. Exhaust gas or jacket water can be the heat source to satisfy 61% refrigerating load for 70% of power energy consumption, equivalent to 46.8 tonnes of fuel conservation. He et al. (2019) set up a LiBr-H2O absorption and compression coupling refrigeration system. COP analysis reveals that 50% of power energy consumption can be conserved when the coupling system is used in the case of low-grade heat loss. In recent years, AR has been widely used in food frozen, air-conditioning, and many other industrial production processes. Pan et al. (2021) introduced a data center into the silica-H2O adsorption refrigerator driven by the waste heat of the server. Solar energy driving counterpart is also employed as a comparison and the silica-H2O adsorption refrigerator is superior in the payback period. Xu et al. (2021) proposed a cascade absorption refrigeration for use in hot summer and cold winter areas. Aiming at moisture removal rate, humidity efficiency, and COP, the optimized design pioneered an efficient dehumidification method for recovering low-temperature waste heat. AR has low requirements on the temperature of heat source and thus low-grade waste heat sources, such as flue gas, hot air, hot water, etc., can all be used to save power energy. Consequently, the aforementioned foundational and applied research has demonstrated that AR technology is very prospective in the industrial refrigeration process for energy conservation and emission reduction.
As a mature refrigeration technology, CR takes the advantage of any low-level refrigerating temperature and high energy efficiency. However, its investment cost and power consumption are both huge. By contrast, the advantage of AR technology is being able to use low-temperature waste heat instead of power while its refrigeration temperature is limited. Therefore, serial AR driven by waste heat and CR driven by power can fully develop strengths and avoid weaknesses to simultaneously achieve waste heat utilization and power consumption. Based on the above observation, this paper proposes a novel absorption-compression hybrid refrigeration (ACHR) system as a substitution for industrial CR systems in refrigeration application. Firstly, CR, LiBr-H2O AR, NH3-H2O AR principles, and thermodynamic analysis of ACHR are carried out from theoretical points of view. The cryogenic separation in propane dehydrogenation is employed to demonstrate the application of ACHR. Flue gas is used as the heat source for AR and full process simulation is performed under both CR and ACHR cases. Next, the inter-connected temperatures among AR and CR units in ACHR are optimized for total cost minimization. Finally, economic performance, energy conservation, and carbon emission reduction are all employed to assess the superiority of ACHR over CR. The ACHR system proposed in this paper is prospective for future industrial application for energy conservation and emission reduction.
2. Refrigeration technologies
2.1. Principle of compression refrigeration
As illustrated by Fig. 1, CR is composed of a compressor, condenser, valve, and evaporator (Pita, 1984). The refrigerant is firstly pressurized by the compressor to be fluid with high temperature and high pressure. Whereupon such fluid is cooled down to a certain level through a condenser and then sent to throttle for depressurization. After the throttle, the boiling point of the refrigerant will be below the condenser output level because of the pressure drop. Finally, the overheated refrigerant evaporates to achieve refrigeration in the evaporator. As evaporated refrigerant returns to the compressor, the refrigeration cycle is closed to realize continuous operation. Therefore, high-grade power energy is consumed to generate refrigerating load in CR. Specifically, the refrigerating temperature is determined by the boiling point of the refrigerant selected.

In CR, COPCR is the key performance parameter and it is the quotient of the refrigerating load(CDUTY) and the power energy consumed(E) (Pu, 2000), as shown in Eq. (1).
(1)
When the refrigeration temperature is lower, the cascade refrigeration cycle is then needed, and it is composed of single or multistage refrigeration systems working with different refrigerants. As shown in Fig. 2, it is a cascade system consisting of two-stage compression refrigeration. An inter-heat exchanger is placed between the two stages as a shared condenser and evaporator for the two refrigerants. The cascade connection of the two cycles can achieve lower refrigeration temperature through the connection of refrigerants with different boiling points.

2.2. Principle of absorption refrigeration
The principle of AR is shown in Fig. 3, and the refrigerator is composed of a generator, condenser, throttle, evaporator, absorber, and solution exchanger (Wu and Li, 2009). Compared with CR, AR substitutes the section of the absorber, solution heat exchanger, generator, and distillation column for the compressor, so the refrigeration is driven by low-grade heat instead of power. The key issue to AR is the working pair and common industrial pairs are LiBr-H2O and NH3-H2O. Specifically, H2O is the refrigerant and LiBr-H2O concentrated solution is the absorber for the former one while NH3 is the refrigerant and H2O is the absorber of the latter. In the AR process, the LiBr-H2O solution is first pumped to the generator for heat absorption from the heat source stream. Next, the heated solution is fed to the flash and split to the refrigerant overhead and absorber at the bottom of the tower. The flashed refrigerant is then successively cooled down through the condenser, depressurized through the throttle, and finally sent to the evaporator to generate refrigerating load by evaporation. The evaporated refrigerant will be absorbed by the absorber again to form the concentrated solution, which can be pumped to the generator to close the cycle. The heat energy of the heat source stream is the driving force of the absorption refrigerator. Different from the LiBr-H2O AR process, the refrigerant NH3 in the NH3-H2O absorption refrigerator should be separated through a distillation column. In the LiBr-H2O absorption refrigerator, the heat source directly heats the feed LiBr-H2O in flash while in the NH3-H2O system, the heat source indirectly heats the feed solution by driving the reboiler.

For absorption refrigerators, exergy efficiency (ηE) and COPAR are important indicators to evaluate their performance, as formulated in Eqs. (2) and (3). The power consumption(AL) of the pump in the AR process is quite small and thereby can be ignored (Li, 2018).

(3)
where, QE is the refrigerating load, QS is the heat provided by a heat source, AL represents the power consumption of the pump, Ein is exergy input, and Eout is exergy output, respectively.
Consequently, COPAR indicates the refrigerating ability of per unit waste heat input, and ηE is exergy utilization efficiency.
3. Thermodynamic analysis of absorption-compression hybrid refrigeration
Based on the principles and technical characteristics of CR and AR, absorption-compression hybrid refrigeration (ACHR) is proposed to achieve the current refrigeration capacity by adopting both AR and CR instead of a single CR.
3.1. Energy analysis
In the industrial cryogenic separation process, the refrigeration temperature span is generally wide. The stream to be refrigerated is from temperature T0 to Tn, and the temperature range is divided into n intervals, and the corresponding connecting temperatures of each interval are T1, T2 ... Tn-1. The lowest refrigeration temperature that can be achieved by AR is Tm(T0<Tm<Tn), and AR is selected in the temperature from T0 to Tm. Afterwards, CR is adopted in the temperature from Tm to Tn. Tm is the connecting temperature between AR and CR, as shown in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4. Temperature interval division of absorption-compression hybrid refrigeration.
The corresponding refrigeration load in each temperature interval is Q1, Q2...Qn. The total refrigeration load is formulated in Eq. (4).
(4)
3.2. Exergy analysis
Exergy is an important parameter reflecting the energy conversion efficiency. Electricity is of an extremely high grade compared to other forms of energy. Thus, it is crucial to save power energy. Traditional CR is adopted in the refrigeration process for temperature decrease from T0 to Tn. It is assumed that the exergy efficiency of each CR corresponding to different refrigeration intervals is COPCRi, so the total exergy balance is formulated in Eq. (5).
(5)
When ACHR is adopted in the refrigeration process to perform the same temperature region. The AR refrigeration temperature is from T0 to Tm, and the exergy supplied by flue gas represented by EQg is formulated in Eq. (6). Since the power consumption of the AR is almost 0, the total power consumption of the ACHR is formulated in Eq. (7), and the total exergy of the process is formulated in Eq. (8).
(6)
(7)
(8)
As "high-level energy", the production of electricity needs to consume a large number of resources, such as coal and/or natural gas. The exergy analysis of the refrigeration process shows that the ACHR saves a certain amount of electricity compared with the traditional CR, and the electricity-saving potential is related to the temperature region of AR and CR.
3.3. Refrigeration load distribution analysis
When the stream is reduced from T0 to Tn, its vapor fraction and refrigeration load change with temperature as shown in Fig. 5. Mi and Qi represent the molar fraction of the vapor phase and the refrigeration load corresponding to Ti. Specifically, the refrigeration process can be divided into three stages, T0∼TC as stage Ⅰ, TC∼Td as stage Ⅱ, and Td∼Tn as stage Ⅲ. Primarily, in stage I, the stream is vapor phase, and the refrigeration load rises slowly. In stage Ⅱ, the phase transition starts from the temperature TC, and the refrigeration load increases sharply. Afterwards, in stage Ⅲ, no phase change occurs, and the refrigeration load rises steadily. In a word, the majority of refrigeration load distributes in stage Ⅱ, and thus AR covering stage Ⅱ is the crucial way to energy conservation of ACHR.

Fig. 5. Phase transition of a mixture during refrigeration.
Based on the above energy, exergy, and refrigeration load analysis, the placement of ACHR encompassing both AR and CR can be put forward as follows: (1) AR and CR should be serial connected to divide the refrigerating temperature region; (2) the phase transition temperature of the stream to be refrigerated should be covered by AR units and the lower refrigerating temperature limit of AR sub-system is, the better; (3) LiBr-H2O and NH3-H2O are different in waste heat temperature requirement and exergy efficiency, so their placement and waste heat utilization need optimization to form the most efficient scenario.
3.4. Model assumptions
The CR and AR system and refrigerators are all based on existing research and industrial application. Since it has been widely used in many industrial occasions, it can also be used in the refrigeration of propane dehydrogenation. This paper focuses on ACHR technological application and neglects other aspects. Thus, the following assumptions should be stated in advance.
(1)
The number of refrigerants and safety requirements of operation in AR are not taken into consideration.
(2)
Pipelines, modules and other infrastructure can be commonly used.
(3)
The data of LiBr-H2O and NH3-H2O absorption refrigerators are all from industrial applications.
(4)
Both LiBr-H2O and NH3-H2O absorption refrigerators are conservative single-effect so that the influence of refrigerating load, occupied area, etc. of refrigerators on propane dehydrogenation can be neglected.
4. Process simulation
The cryogenic separation process of propane dehydrogenation products needs a huge refrigeration load and thus is well suited for the application of ACHR. Detailed process simulations of propane dehydrogenation and ACHR are established in this chapter.
As shown in Fig. 6, the industrial propane dehydrogenation process generally consists of four blocks, including propane dehydrogenation reaction (a), compression (b), refrigeration (c), product cryogenic distillation, and reactant recycling (d).

Firstly, makeup and recycled propane are mixed to be the reactant, which is first heated up by a pre-heater (S1) and then a heat exchanger (C1). Next, propane dehydrogenation takes place in a plug flow reactor (R1), and the main reaction is propane dehydrogenation, and side reactions are formulated as Eqs. (9)–(11). The product is the mixture (a-5) of propylene, methane, ethylene, ethane, hydrogen, and unreacted propane.
(9)
(10)
(11)
Although by-products including hydrogen, methane, ethylene, and ethane are produced, their total amount is very small and they cannot be liquefied in the refrigeration process. Therefore, the separation only takes propane and propylene into consideration in this paper.
The product mixture is quenched through a pre-heater (S1) and then sent to block b for compression. Afterwards, the compressed mixture is cooled down to 20 °C by cold water first and then refrigerated by several refrigerators. The target refrigerating temperature is −90 °C. Next, the cold product mixture enters block d for separation. Component H2 is concentrated in the vent gas of flash (F1) and other components at the bottom are sent to columns (T1 and T2) for distillation. The heavy key component propane is concentrated (h-5) at the bottom of T1 and then recycled back to reactor (R1) to increase its conversion. Finally, the propylene and entrained ethylene mixture (h-6) is further fractionated in T2 to obtain highly purified propylene as a final product (h-8).
4.1. Process simulation of propane dehydrogenation
A 498 kt propane dehydrogenation to propylene enterprise in China is used as a demonstration. The process simulation is performed by Aspen plus V12 software and all process units except absorption refrigerators still adopt the SRK property method while absorption refrigerators employ the ELECNRTL method because LiBr and NH3 are electrolytes and polar components, respectively.
In industrial propane dehydrogenation, multi-stage compression refrigeration is employed for cryogenic separation, as shown in Fig. 7. The refrigeration temperature is divided into 20∼−30 °C, −30∼−40 °C, and −40∼−90 °C, respectively. In the previous two regions 20∼−30 °C and −30∼−40 °C, a single-stage compression refrigeration cycle is used. The pressure of refrigerant gas rises from the evaporation pressure to the condensation pressure through the compressor (COM2-2) and then cooled down in the condenser (C2-4) by heat transfer with water. Afterward, the refrigerant liquid drops to the evaporation pressure through the throttle valve (V2-1). Finally, it is recycled to the evaporator (C2-3) to absorb heat. When the refrigeration temperature drops to −40∼−90 °C, a cascade refrigeration cycle is used. In this cycle, the refrigerant gas is heated up initially through the regenerator placed after the evaporator (C2-5), and then pressurized through the compressor (COM2-3) to enter the condenser (C2-6) that is cooled by the compression refrigeration cycle. Next, the condensed refrigerant liquid enters the regenerator (C2-9) to exchange heat with the refrigerant gas, and then goes through the throttle valve (V2-3) in an undercooled state. The depressurized refrigerant liquid circulates to the evaporator (C2-7) to provide cooling capacity. Finally, the dehydrogenation product mixture enters the separation system to obtain high-purity propylene at −90 °C.

Fig. 8. Phase transition process and refrigeration duty of propane dehydrogenation product mixture.
The entire refrigeration temperature region is from 20 °C to −90 °C. Since the operation pressure is 10 bar, the phase transition point of the mixture is 11.7 °C. Starting from such temperature level, the refrigeration load gradient is changing sharply in the earlier period and then slowly as temperature decrease. Noting that the refrigeration temperature Tm of AR can be as low as −30 °C, it can be found that the molar vapor phase fraction of the mixture is 100% at 11.7 °C while 29.36% at −30 °C, and the corresponding refrigeration load is 28,874 kW, accounting for 73% of the total load 39,638 kW in the refrigeration region of 20 °C∼−90 °C. Therefore, in this paper, ACHR is worthy to be employed in cryogenic separation for energy conservation.
Specifically, the refrigeration temperature region within 20 °C and −30 °C can be accomplished by serial LiBr-H2O and NH3-H2O absorption refrigeration. Furthermore, the remaining region of −30 °C and −90 °C should be achieved by single-stage compression refrigeration from −30 °C to −40 °C and cascade refrigeration cycle from −40 °C to −90 °C. Such placement is the ACHR scenario for propane dehydrogenation.
4.3. Process simulation of absorption-compression hybrid refrigeration
4.3.1. Flue gas as a heat source
A huge amount of flue gas generated by coal combustion power plants is very suitable to be the heat source because of its sufficient temperature level (up to 200 °C) and remarkable waste heat. The flue gas composition of some coal combustion-based power plant in China is listed in Table 3.
Table 3. Flue gas properties of some coal-combustion power plant in China.

600 75.58 4.10 0.62 16.64 3.06 4271 200.0 1.00
Although flue gas is the heat source of AR in this work, hot water is industrially the direct heat source to drive LiBr-H2O absorption refrigerator, so the heat should be firstly transferred from flue gas to water. Nevertheless, NH3 and H2O are easy to evaporate, so flue gas can be the direct heat source to drive the NH3-H2O absorption refrigerator. Given the heat source temperature level requirement of the NH3-H2O absorption refrigerator is higher than that of the LiBr-H2O counterpart, flue gas first enters the former one and then goes through the latter to release energy, as shown in Fig. 9. Specifically, flue gas stream f-1 first heats the reboiler of the distillation column in the NH3-H2O absorption refrigerator. Afterward, the outlet flue gas f-2 is sent to the generator in the LiBr-H2O unit. In such a way, flue gas is utilized to serially drive NH3-H2O and LiBr absorption refrigerators according to their different temperature requirements on a heat source.

4.3.2. Process simulation with ACHR
Since generally, the minimum refrigeration temperature of LiBr-H2O is 5 °C while that of NH3H2O is −30 °C, and meanwhile −40 °C is the boundary of single and cascade compression refrigeration, then the refrigeration temperature region 20∼−90 °C is divided into 20∼5 °C, 5∼−30 °C, −30∼−40 °C and −40∼−90 °C, which are performed by LiBr-H2O, and NH3-H2O absorption refrigerators, single-stage and cascade compression refrigeration cycles successively to form the ACHR scenario. Usually, the lowest refrigeration temperature that can be achieved by single-stage compression refrigeration is −40 °C. When the refrigeration temperature is −40∼−90 °C, which can share a set of refrigerators with the refrigeration temperature at −30∼−40 °C. The specific refrigeration process is shown in Fig. 10.

The LiBr-H2O absorption refrigerator is illustrated as block c in Fig. 10 with an industrial 50% LiBr-H2O solution of the mass fraction. The LiBr-H2O solution is first pumped to the heat exchanger (C13), whose heat source is the hot stream from the flash (F2) bottom. The preheated LiBr-H2O solution (c-4) is then heated by the part flow of f-2 in the heat exchanger (S2) and the outlet stream (c-7) enters flash (F2) to be split into refrigerant water (c-8) flowing out overhead and the concentrated LiBr-H2O solution at the bottom. After successively cooling down in the condenser (C14) and depressurizing in the reducing valve (V6), the refrigerant water stream (c-10) enters an evaporator (C3) to perform refrigeration through its evaporation. Meanwhile, the concentrated LiBr-H2O solution is also cooled down and depressurized in C13 and reducing valve (V5). Finally, the concentrated LiBr-H2O solution from V5 is as absorbent to absorb the evaporated refrigerant water in absorber M3 to form the initial LiBr-H2O solution. The regenerated LiBr-H2O solution consequently closes the refrigeration cycle.
After the first stage of refrigeration, the NH3-H2O solution absorption refrigerator is then placed as block d in Fig. 10. Flue gas is the heat source to heat the water at the bottom of the distillation column (T3). After being pumped to the heat exchanger (C18), the NH3-H2O solution with an industrial 28% mass fraction is heated up and then sent to the distillation column (T3) for separation of refrigerant NH3 and absorbent H2O. The refrigerant NH3 flowing out overhead is successively cooled down through a condenser (C19) and depressurized by a reducing valve (V7) so that the low-temperatund refrigerant can evaporate to perform refrigeration in the evaporator (C4). The absorbent water (d-8) at the bottom of T3 first preheats the feed solution to T3 through exchanger (C18) and then it (d-9) enters absorber (M4) to absorb the evaporated refrigerant NH3. Finally, the regenerated NH3-H2O solution is cooled down by C20 and then pumped into the generator again to close the cycle. When the refrigeration temperature is −30∼−90 °C, the refrigeration process is the same as traditional compression refrigeration.
The results of streams and process units in reaction, separation processes, and ACHR of propane dehydrogenation to propylene are listed in Table 4, and more detailed data are summarized in Tables S2 and S3.

Note that, the industrial single-effect LiBr-H2O absorption refrigerator can supply refrigerating load of 20,000 kW at most, and the result in this case requires 12,052.04 kW. Thus, only one such refrigerator is enough. Similarly, single-effect NH3-H2O can supply 12,000 kW at most, so 16,822.68 kW capacity requires 2 such refrigerators.
The total flow rate of heat source flue gas is 8542 Nm3/h, which can just be supplied by 2 same coal combustion power generators with a capacity of 600 MW from some plant in China. All results, including flow rate, inlet and outlet temperatures, pressures, and heat duty of heat source flue gas, are summarized in Table 5.

5. Optimization and results analysis
5.1. ACHR optimization
In ACHR, the absorption refrigeration units should encompass both investment and operation costs. However, the power consumption has been neglected as aforementioned and the driving energy is waste heat, so there is no operation cost. Consequently, only investment cost minimization is enough to perform the optimization. Note that, the more refrigerating load is, the more investment cost will be. Thus, when the COPAR and ηE are at the highest level, the load will be the lowest, and so does the investment cost. Therefore, the investment cost of the two absorption refrigerators is decided by temperature region and refrigerating load.
On one hand, the refrigerating temperature of the LiBr-H2O refrigerator is 5 °C, which is also the input temperature of the NH3-H2O refrigerator. The inter-connected temperature of the two serial absorption refrigerators used above is an industrial limiting value, not guaranteed to be optimal. On the other hand, the inter-connected temperature divides the refrigerating temperature region into 20 °C∼5 °C and 5 °C∼−30 °C sub-regions, also thereupon stipulates their refrigerating loads. In a word, the inter-connected temperature is the key issue to the total investment cost of AR. As shown in Fig. 8, the phase transition temperature is 11.7 °C, and thereby the inter-connected temperature should be below it so that there is trade-off between the two refrigerators. Otherwise, the refrigerating load will be mostly on the NH3-H2O refrigerator and LiBr-H2O will be useless.
Since the refrigerating temperature of LiBr-H2O absorption refrigerator should be above 5 °C and lower than 11.7 °C. To reserve temperature difference for phase change of propane and propylene, the upper limit is set as 9 °C in this work. As a result, the inter-connected temperature cases of 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 °C will be respectively analyzed to perform optimization and identify the optimal scenario with minimum investment cost.
The detailed simulation results of heat and exergy input and output data for LiBr-H2O refrigerator within 5–9 °C are listed in Tables S4–S9. It can be seen that for each given refrigerating temperature and load, QE, and Eout are both fixed. Meanwhile, the heat source temperature change does not cause QS variation, so COPAR is constant. Furthermore, it can be seen that on different inter-connected temperatures, QE and QS are proportional so that COPAR is constant for LiBr-H2O absorption refrigerators as the LiBr-H2O solution flow rate is adjusted to satisfy the refrigerating load. However, since Ein is gradually increased with increasing heat source temperature, so ηE will be lower at higher heat source temperature. Besides, COPAR under the same flashing temperature is almost constant and the peak level appears at 93 °C.
Illustratively, the corresponding variation tendency for COPAR and ηE are plotted in Fig. 11. In Fig. 11a, ηE will be gradually lower if the heat source temperature is above 100 °C while evaporation cannot take place if such temperature is below 100 °C. Thus, the case below 100 °C has not even been analyzed. Meanwhile, Fig. 11b and c show that when the heat source is fixed as 100 °C, COPAR and ηE are nearly constant at each flashing temperature level among 89–97 °C with 1 °C as increment. Therefore, Fig. 11 concludes that heat source 100 °C and flashing temperature 93 °C determine the highest COPAR and ηE, so they are optimal parameters of LiBr-H2O absorption refrigerator. After the aforementioned analysis, parameter optimization should also be performed for the NH3-H2O absorption refrigerator. However, the NH3-H2O solution should be heated up to 148 °C and the fluctuation should not exceed 2 °C as both technological and safety considerations. Thus, the optimization for the NH3-H2O absorption refrigerator is not carried out in this work. Thus, operation temperatures of NH3-H2O refrigerators are not optimized, and industrial data is directly employed.

In summary, the simulation results of LiBr-H2O and NH3-H2O absorption refrigerators are listed in Tables 6 and 7. Since the refrigerating temperature region is specified, the total refrigerating load of absorption refrigerators is fixed and as a result, the amount of energy saving is also constant.

As supplementary, the capital cost (CTCI) of an absorption refrigerator is estimated by Eq. (12) belo (Seider et al., 2009).

where, CTCI is the total capital investment, CTDC is the total depreciable capital investment, Cstant is stand-up cost, and which is taken as 2% of the total depreciable capital investment, CWC is working capital, and which is the 15% of total capital investment.
However, the capital costs of the two refrigerators wane and wax as inter-connected temperature changes. Quantitatively, their total cost is compared by Fig. 12 and 6 °C is the optimal inter-connected temperature corresponding to minimum total capital cost. In such a case, a set of LiBr-H2O and two sets of NH3-H2O absorption refrigerators (has been placed in Fig. 10) with 10,889.69 kW and 8992.22 kW per set are placed to be the optimal AR scenario. Specifically, the optimal stream and unit results for absorption refrigerators of LiBr-H2O and NH3-H2O refrigerators are listed in Tables S10, respectively. The flue gas is shown in Table 8, where the waste heat can be supplied by 2 coal-combustion power plants with a capacity of 600 MW. More specific flow and equipment parameters can be found in Table S10.

5.2. Contrastive analysis
In the refrigeration separation process of propane dehydrogenation, Fig. 13 shows exergy analysis of CR and ACHR, the exergy is represented by EQ´ and EQ”, respectively. In compression refrigeration, when the refrigeration temperature is 20∼−30 °C, although the COPCR of single-stage compression refrigeration with R22 is the highest, the power consumption is also huge. When adopting ACHR, the corresponding refrigeration load is provided by the waste heat of AR. In a word, the exergy analysis shows that the use of ACHR can reduce the demand for power energy. Quantitatively, annual power consumption of 110.8 GW h, corresponding to area A in Fig. 13, can be conserved.

Fig. 13. Exergy analysis of CR and ACHR in connection temperature is 6 °C.
In addition, Table 9 lists the annual power consumption, cost reduction, standard coal consumption, and the corresponding CO2 emission.
Table 9. Annual power consumption and CO2 emission comparison of ACHR and CR.
scenario Power of CR (GW.h) Power cost (MM$) Coal consumption (kt) CO2 emission (Mt)
F1 115.5 12.1 41.49 0.125
F2 226.3 23.7 81.30 0.245
The results in Table 9 quantitatively declare that by comparison, CR annually consumes power energy 226.3 GW h while ACHR only needs 115.5 GW h. In other words, the ACHR in the propane dehydrogenation process can annually conserve power consumption of 110.8 GW h, accounting for 48.72% of total consumption by CR. The reason for such huge energy conservation potential is the substitution of flue gas waste heat from a coal-combustion power plant with 2 sets of 600 MW capacity for power to drive refrigeration. Theoretically, process simulation quantifies that the refrigerating load (28,874.7 kW) in temperature region 20∼−30 °C takes up 73% of total capacity (39,638.2 kW) within 20∼−90 °C. Thus, the practical energy conservation potential is consistent with such theoretical level and also the maximum potential. In addition, such energy conservation is equivalent to an annual 39.8 kt standard coal usage cut down and 0.12 Mt CO2 emission mitigation. Therefore, Although the performance parameters of CR are better, it consumes high-grade power energy. It can be concluded that although ACHR is less efficient than CR in energy efficiency, its waste heat driving mode can not only conserve energy but also reduce investment cost and emission, revealing wide application prospect.
6. Conclusions
This paper proposes an absorption-compression hybrid refrigeration (ACHR) technology to reduce the power energy consumption and its caused emission of industrial refrigeration. The thermodynamic analysis is performed first and serial AR and CR way is put forward. By using flue gas waste heat as the driving heat source of AR units, hybrid refrigeration is applied in the cryogenic separation of propane dehydrogenation and then the whole process simulation and optimization are carried out. The results show that when the connecting temperature of the LiBr-H2O AR unit and NH3-H2O AR unit is 6 °C, the system can achieve the best economic benefit. Compared with CR, the flue gas drives the refrigeration load of 28,874.7 kW with low-grade heat, which accounts for 73% of the total refrigeration load. Such load reduction can save 48.73% of electricity, reduce the standard coal consumption by 39.8 kt, and reduce carbon emission by 0.12 Mt. The research performed in this work indicates that when phase transition can be covered by AR, waste heat driving low exergy efficient absorption refrigeration is superior to power driving high exergy efficient compression refrigeration in resource conservation, carbon emission, and investment reduction. Therefore, serial AR and CR formed ACHR is prospective in future industrial application. Note that, since absorption refrigeration can not be used for refrigeration cases with very low temperatures, it cannot completely replace compression refrigeration.
