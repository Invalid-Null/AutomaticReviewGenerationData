Amorphous silica-alumina as robust support for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane: Effect of Si/Al ratio on nature and dispersion of Cr active sites
The effect of amorphous silica-alumina (ASA) with Si/Al ratios of 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 3 on the catalytic performance of chromium catalysis in the propane dehydrogenation reaction were studied. The characterization results reveal that the Si/Al ratio significantly affects the nature and dispersion of chromium species, reducibility, the surface concentration of Cr3+, and acidity. ASA catalysis with Si/Al ratios of 0.1 and 0.01 showed a remarkable increase in Cr6+ species and the lowest α-Cr2O3, which have the highest propane conversion (with initial propylene yield of 60 and 57, respectively) due to the reduction of surface monochromate Cr6+ species, which are the precursor of coordinatively unsaturated active sites (c.u.s.) to active Cr3+ species. Si/Al increase to the values of 1 and 3 can restrict the access of reactants to active Cr species due to the decrease in chromium reduction and increase in α-Cr2O3.
1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the most prominent gases due to some valuable products and derivatives such as polymers, solvents, dyes, etc., which makes it one of the most important building blocks in the chemical industry. Due to the limitations of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes in terms of low selectivity, energy consumption, and significant CO2 emission, these processes cannot fulfill the growing demand for propylene [1], [2], [3]. Compared with traditional methods, catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has grabbed the attention of researchers due to the high yield of propylene, safety, and low operational cost. Pt and CrOx-based catalysts are commercial catalysts for PDH processes in Oleflex and CATOFIN technologies, respectively, and can achieve high activity and selectivity to olefins. In commercial PDH technologies, CrOx-based catalysts have been widely used due to their low cost, good mechanical stability, and outstanding performance [4], [5], [6].
The exact nature of the active site of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is controversial due to the presence of chromium in several oxidation states and different molecular structures. The distribution of chromium species in different oxidation states on the support surface is complicated and highly dependent on the catalyst support, the amount of chromium loading, and the calcination temperature. Determining the contribution of each Cr species and Cr coordination number to the catalytic performance is challenging and vital to understand the reaction mechanism. Cr(III), Cr(V), and Cr(VI) are three stabilized oxidation states of chromium species in oxidized alumina-supported chromium oxide catalysts. Recent studies on the PDH process have found that the dispersed Cr3+ species are responsible for the catalytic dehydrogenation activity [7], [8]. In addition, although the Cr6+ species are not active for dehydrogenation reaction, the Cr6+ sites are the precursors of active Cr3+ species. Several types of Cr3+ species exist on catalysts, including:
1.
redox Cr3+ formed in the reduction of Cr6+ and Cr5+
2.
non-redox Cr3+ in amorphous chromium phase
3.
Cr3+ in crystalline chromium, which is present in reduced and oxidated samples.
These Cr3+ species can be achieved by changing the sample properties and treatment conditions [9], [10]. The presence of redox Cr(III) is vital for the high activity of PDH catalysis. A correlation between the number of redox Cr sites, oxidation sites, chromium reduction, and activity is observed, especially at low Cr loadings. However, at high Cr loadings, the effect of non-redox species on the catalytic activity cannot be neglected. Much attention has been grabbed to opt for a support with appropriate chemical properties and surface area to achieve a high amount of chromium oxidation and reduction sites with the highest chromium loading due to the significant role of chromium reductants in the propane dehydrogenation process [11], [12].
One of the challenging issues in the PDH process is achieving appropriate support. The catalyst support is a critical factor in catalytic performance due to its role as a scaffold providing a complex microenvironment. The catalyst support should be thermally stable enough to retain the morphology of the catalyst since it not only can provide an open structure to easily access the reactants and prevent pore blockage by coke formation [13]. Adsorption of propane in CrOx and other metal oxides catalyst depends on distribution of acidic sites in particular Lewis’s acid sites. These sites vary with M-O coordination, cluster sizes, and transition states [14]. Therefore, to increase the activity, selectivity, and stability of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, different modifiers based on compounds of potassium, copper, and zinc, and various calcination processes are widely used to control the structure, nature, and concentration of acidic sites, have been carried out[15], [16], [17], [18]. Different amorphous silica-alumina (ASA) on the surface structure and state of chromium active species in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) have not been investigated. Amorphous silica-aluminas (ASAs) showed an exceptional class of porous materials with high surface area, adjustable pore size and acidity which are extensively applied in the petroleum refining process [19]. Amorphous silica-aluminas are attractive since their structural, textural, and acid properties can be easily manipulated by changing the synthesis method, Si/Al ratio, and calcination temperatures.
In this research, novel CrOx-based catalysts on ASA+Alumina composite as support with different Si/Al ratios were synthesized and successfully evaluated in the PDH process for the first time. The structure and physicochemical properties of the catalyst were studied using XRD, FT-IR, BET, FESEM, XPS, Raman, UV-Vis, TGA, H2-TPR, and NH3-TPD analysis. The impacts of structure, acidity, and Si/Al ratio of the synthesized catalysts on the distribution, oxidation states of Cr species, and catalyst activity were investigated in detail, which revealed that the Si/Al ratio highly affects the distribution and oxidation states of Cr species. The results of this research are useful for understanding the nature of active chromium species and synthesizing catalysts with high activity and stability.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
In this study, the reagents used were nitric acid (HNO3, Merck Chemical Co.), Hydroxyethylcellulose (CH2CH2OH, Aldrich Chemical Co.), Chromium (III) nitrate nonahydrate (Cr(NO3)3·9 H2O, Merck Chemical Co.), Pseudo-boehmite powder (AlOOH, Condea (Sasol)), Sodium silicate (8% Na2O and 26.5% SiO2, Merck Chemical Co.), Aluminum sulfate octa decahydrate (Al2(SO4)318 H2O, Merck Chemical Co.), Ammonia (NH3 (25 wt%), Merck Chemical Co.). All materials were laboratory-grade and utilized without any further treatment.
2.2. Synthesis of amorphous silica-alumina (ASA)
Amorphous silica-alumina (ASA) was synthesized by the successive precipitation of aluminum and silicon-containing precursors from Al2(SO4)318 H2O and sodium silicate (28% SiO2, 8.5% Na2O) solutions, respectively. The amounts of the salts were adjusted to obtain ASA with mole Si/Al ratios of 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 3. Initially, an aluminum hydroxide sol was precipitated from an aqueous aluminum sulfate solution at pH 9.0 by adding aqueous ammonia (25 wt%). An appropriate amount of an aqueous sodium silicate solution was added to the resulting suspension under vigorous stirring. The acidity of the mixture was adjusted to pH 9.5 by adding aqueous ammonia or sulfuric acid (98 wt%). The precipitated product was collected on a filter and was multiply washed with distilled water until the washings were free of the sulfate anion. The resulting solid was dried at 120 °C (16 h) and was then calcined at 700 °C (4 h).
2.3. Preparation of supports and catalysts
Composite support ASA+Al2O3 was obtained by peptizing pseudo-boehmite as a binder and mixing with Amorphous silica-alumina (ASA) with Si/Al ratios of 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 3. The weight ratio of ASA/binder was set to 70:30 for all samples. The prepared supports were shaped by a cylindrical extruder and passed through a die with a 2 mm diameter to form a smooth cylindrical shape. The shaped samples were dried at 100 °C overnight. Next, the samples were calcinated in a muffle furnace at 823 K for 3 h to gain permanent shape and strength. A desired amount of Cr(NO3)3·9 H2O (based on 20 wt% of Cr2O3 on support) was dissolved in deionized water and added to supports by dry impregnation. The prepared catalysts were heated in a muffle furnace at 873 K for 4 h at the rate of 3 °C/min. A catalyst on alumina support (A0) was synthesized to investigate the effect of Amorphous silica-alumina on the catalysts. The prepared catalysts were denoted as A1, A2, A3, and A4 for ASA with Si/Al ratios of 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 3, respectively. The composition of prepared catalysts is reported in Table 1.

2.4. Characterization
The crystal structure and phases were determined by X-ray diffraction pattern (X′Pert Pro XRD spectrometer PANalytical Co.) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) as the X-ray source. The data were obtained in the angle range of 5–90° with a step size of 0.02°. The Micromeritics ASAP2000 (Micromeritics, USA) was utilized to calculate the average pore size, pore volume, and specific surface area of prepared supports and catalysts. Prior to the adsorption-desorption of N2, all samples were degassed at 300 °C for 3 h. The specific surface area was calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method with N2 as the adsorption and desorption gas at 77 K. Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) and t-plot methods were employed to estimate the mesopore volume and pore size distribution, respectively. Raman spectroscopy was performed by XploRA Plus (HORIBA, Japan) with wavelength radiation of 532 nm in the range of 50–1050 cm−1 to study the chemical composition and chromium oxidation state of catalysts. Temperature-programmed analyses were conducted by Micromeritics TPR/TPD 2900 with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR) was used to determine the reduction temperature and reduction rate of the metal oxide phase on the catalysts. While temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was conducted to calculate the supports' density and total acidity sites. In H2-TPR analysis, catalysts were pretreated in a mixture of Argon and Helium flow (v:v = 3:1) at 550 °C for 1 h. After that, the catalysts were cooled in Ar flow to 50 °C. Then, the samples were heated until 750 °C with the rate of 10 °C/min in H2 flow and kept for 30 min. The TCD detector recorded the consumption rate of H2. To determine the chemical state of surface species and the oxidation state of atom metals on the surface, X-ray photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (SPECS - UHV analysis system) was utilized. All spectra with characteristic binding energy (BE) in C1S were calibrated at 284.6 eV. The UV/VIS DRS analysis (UV-2550, Shimadzu) was conducted in the range of 200–700 nm to investigate the electron transition between atoms and ions, besides confirming the presence of metals on the surface of catalysts. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in Mettler Toledo, TGA/SDTA-851 at 800 °C with the rate of 20 °C/min in atmospheric flow to calculate the coke formation of catalysts after the reaction test.
2.5. Catalyst evaluation
The performance of the synthesized catalyst in propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH) was evaluated in a fixed bed quartz reactor at 580 °C and atmospheric pressure. The 0.67 g of catalyst (30–50 mesh) diluted by 0.33 g quartz (w:w = 2:1) was loaded between quartz wool. The mixed gas stream (40% C3H8 and 60% N2) was fed to the reactor with a flow rate of 28.4 ml/min. The rate of inlet gases was controlled by a mass flow controller (Alicat MC-50SLPM-D-PCV65/5 M) and the composition of the product gas stream was analyzed by online gas chromatography (Agilent 7820 A GC). The schematic representation of the experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. S1.
Propane conversion, propylene selectivity, propylene yield, deactivation constant, and specific activity were calculated, followed by the following equations:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization result
3.1.1. X-ray phase analysis
The X-ray diffraction patterns of alumina and ASA composite with different Si/Al ratios are illustrated in Fig. 1(a). According to standard JCPD Card No.10–0425, alumina has three major peaks at 2
= 37.8,45.7, and 66.9°, which were a reflection of plates with miller indices 311, 400, and 440, respectively [20], [21], [22]. A broad peak at 2
= 20°− 30° was observed for all samples, which show alumina-silicate amorphous structure. In addition, the mentioned peaks were broadened by increasing the Si/Al ratio [23].

The Cr2O3 diffraction peaks were demonstrated in Fig. 1(b) based on JCPD Card No. 84–1616. As is evident, the chromium corresponding peaks were decreased in the catalysts, consisting of the ASA with low Si/Al ratio (A1 and A2 catalysts), which shows high dispersion of Cr2O3 particles, decrease the number of crystalline Cr2O3, and increasing microcrystalline. On the other hand, the intensity of Cr2O3 peaks grew by increasing the Si/Al ratio, which indicates an enhancement in crystal size [24], [25].
3.1.2. FT-IR analysis
The FT-IR spectra in a frequency range of 400–4000 cm−1 were conducted to investigate the surface groups of the obtained catalyst, displayed in Fig. 5. In the case of Al2O3 support, the broad bands of the Al–O stretching within the range of 500–1000 cm−1 indicate the γ-Al2O3 phase. The bands around 581 and 730 cm−1 are attributed to the AlO4 and AlO6 stretching vibrations of the Al–O bond in alumina, respectively. The bands around 1100 cm−1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of the Si-O group on silanol (Si-OH) and Al-O on Al-OH. The absorption peak at wave numbers 1450 cm−1 showed the presence of O-Al-O stretching vibrations and Si-O groups in the siloxane group (Si-O-Si). In addition, absorption peaks at 1650 and 3500 cm−1 originate from the symmetric stretching vibration and bending vibration of OH groups of the adsorbed water, respectively. As evident in Fig. S2 (a), the intensity of hydroxyl groups in the A1 and A2 samples is higher than in other samples, which shows more hydroxyl groups in the Al2O3 support.
To understand the influence of chromium species in the surface groups on ASA and Al2O3 supports, the FT-IR spectra with a frequency range from 500 to 700 cm−1 are displayed in Fig. S2 (b) The peaks appeared around 550 and 630 cm−1 could be designated to the Cr–O distortion vibrations and the characteristic of α-Cr2O3 phase, respectively[26], [27]. The FT-IR analysis showed higher α-Cr2O3 band intensity in the A0, A3, and A4 samples, which are consistent with the results of the XRD analysis.
3.1.3. Texture analysis
The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K of catalysts were demonstrated in Fig. S3. The results containing BET surface area, average pore size, and pore volume were reported in Table 2.
Table 2. Textural properties of the catalyst.
Samples A1 A2 A3 A4 A0
Specific surface area (m−2g−1) 292.2 310.2 255.1 248.3 152.2
Pore volume (cm3·g−1) 0.45 0.44 0.41 0.36 0.31
Pore diameter (nm) 9.14 8.34 8.9 8.1 8.1
According to the IUPAC classification, all samples showed type IV isotherm with H4 hysteresis loop. The hysteresis loop in the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm in the relative pressure range of 0.45–1 indicates large mesopores for all samples. Among synthesized catalysts, A0 and A4 exhibited the lowest specific surface area and pore volume. The more specific surface area, the more available active metal site (Cr) for guest molecules (Propane). However, all samples containing ASA were devoid of micropores. According to Table 2, the Si/Al ratio significantly impacts the surface and pore structure of catalysts [28]. With the increase in Si/Al ratio, the BET surface area and pore volume decreased, which can be ascribed to a change in Alumina-Silica interaction in the ASA structure and the amount of crystalline chromium. The specific surface area and pore volume of A1 were lower than the A2 sample, which indicates a higher amount of Al was included in the ASA structure. Active metal loading can lead to partial pore blockage and natural reduction in specific surface area and pore volume of samples. The chromium species is mainly distributed in pores with a diameter of 5–20 nm. When the chromium is placed in narrow and wide pores, it increases and decreases in average pore size, respectively [28], [29]. The FESEM was performed to investigate the morphology of support, the distribution of Cr species, and the amount of accumulation of chromium oxide species, showed in Fig. S4 Notably, in the catalysts with high Si/Al ratios (such as A3 and A4), the crystalline particles of Cr2O3 increase significantly[18], [23]. While, the dispersion of chromium species increases by decreasing Si/Al ratio. However, due to low representation of SEM analysis, the Cr3+ distribution on the surface and in the bulk of catalysts has to be determined through indirect characterizations and theoretical analysis, which will be further investigated in XPS analyses.
3.1.4. Raman spectroscopy analysis
Raman spectroscopy is a strong probe for investigating vibrational and structural properties, which can give exclusive information about structural analysis. The Raman spectroscopy results were demonstrated in Fig. 2. Cr3+ and Cr6+ are the most prominent oxidation state for chromium/alumina catalysts. Raman peaks at 303 cm−1, 348 cm−1, 548 cm−1, 607 cm−1, and 648 cm−1 could be ascribed to the Raman states of Cr2O3 (A1 g, Eg), which are consistent with previous results [30], [31]. Raman peak at 548 cm−1 with A1 g state shows the presence of Cr (III) in octahedral symmetry, which can be attributed to α-Cr2O3 species. A1 and A2 samples with low Si/Al ratio showed a lower Raman peak intensity for the A1 g state rather other samples. With the Si/Al ratio increase, Cr2O3 layers rose and showed a crystal lattice with higher crystallinity [32]. Furthermore, the presence of oxidated chromium with higher oxidation states (700–950 bands) declined. The Shift toward higher bands in Raman spectroscopy rather than chromium ion in aqueous solution is due to the strong interaction between chromium species with alumina surface [30].

Fig. 2. Raman spectra of the catalysts.
In A3 and A4 samples with higher Si/Al ratios, the intensity of Cr(VI) Raman peaks decreased and made a stronger A1g bound. These results reveal that increase in Si/Al ratio can lead to decrease in monochromate species, which probably increases the formation of polychromate species [33], [34].
For further investigation of chromium (VI) species on the catalysis surface, the Raman spectroscopy of A0 to A4 samples in the range of 700–1000 cm−1 with more details was shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, peak deconvolution at 850 cm−1 exhibits 5 peaks, which can be ascribed to Cr6+ with different polymerization degree. In detail, bands at 850 and 860 cm−1 could be attributed to symmetrical tensile and bending modes of the mononuclear tetrahedral species of "isolated" Cr6+ on the surface. The peaks at 900 and 960 cm−1 showed di-Cr2O72- and tri-Cr3O102- from mono-chromates' polymerization, while peaks at 720 and 787 cm−1 demonstrate the υs Cr-O-Cr and υas Cr-O-Cr bonds, respectively [35], [36], [37]. Although with an increase in Si/Al, the peak at 850 cm−1 shifts toward higher Raman shifts, the intensity of the Raman peak declined, which shows that Si/Al ratio increase can lead to lessen monochromate species and probably the formation of polymeric chromate on the surface.

Fig. 3. Deconvolution of the Raman band from 700 to 1000 cm−1.
According to Fig. 3, an increase in the Si/Al ratio contributes to the formation of Cr6+ with a higher degree of polymerization, which is further investigated by UV-DRS and H2-TPR analysis. The obtained results of XRD and Raman spectra revealed that chromium crystal peaks (α-Cr2O3) of A1 and A2 samples were strongly weaker than A0, A3, and A4 catalysts, which can be concluded that adding ASA with lower Si/Al ratio can effectively prevent polymerization of monomeric and/or oligomeric chromate species, which leads to the distribution of chromium species on the support surface in the form of amorphous or microcrystalline Cr2O3 [38], [39].
3.1.5. Temperature-programmed hydrogen reduction
The H2-TPR profile of prepared catalysts is illustrated in Fig. 4, which contains a Hydrogen absorption signal in the range of 300
℃
to 500
℃
. Gaussian deconvolution of H2-TPR profiles exhibits two states of chromium (VI) in which the former corresponds to more straightforward polychromates reduction. The second one is attributed to the formation of “isolated” mono-, di-, and tri-chromates, which are firmly bound to the Al (III) on the support surface and contribute to the hindered reduction of chromate anions [40], [41]. According to reaction
(based on the quantity of Hydrogen absorption), the amount of Cr (VI) stabilized on the surface was reported in Table 3.

Cr3+ species have not appeared in H2-TPR profiles since H2 is not consumed for Cr3+ reduction. In the catalysts, consisting of the ASA with a low Si/Al ratio, the number of sites capable of the reduction of Cr6+ rose and the H2 absorption signal increased. Therefore, in A1 and A2 catalysts, the amount of CrO3 is higher than in other samples, while the reduction temperature shifts toward higher temperatures, which reveal that Oxygen bond with sparse chromium on the support surface. The results show that with the increase of Si/Al ratio, the amount of chromium (VI) decreased, which can reduce the number of reversible oxidized CrOx due to the formation of mixed chromium –alumina phases, its agglomeration with stabilization in the inactive α-Cr2O3 state that can lead to irreversible catalyst deactivation [17], [42], [43]. However, the reduction of oxidate chromium (VI) (the first peak of Gaussian deconvolution) in A3 and A4 samples was relocated to lower temperatures. This result is consistent with Raman spectroscopy, which leads to enhance in chromium degree of polymerization, which is simply reduced rather than mono-chromates. In the A0 sample, the H2-TPR profile contains only one peak at 428
℃
.
3.1.6. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy analysis
The UV-DRS spectrum of prepared catalysts is shown in Fig. 5, which confirms the presence of Cr (III) and Cr (VI) on the surface of all samples. All catalysts showed four absorption bands in the range of 240–260, 350–370, 450–470, and 590–600 nm. Two strong bands were detected in 270 nm (1A1
1T2 [(1 t1
7 t2 and 6 t2
2e]) and 365 nm (1A1
1T2 (1 t1
2e)), which can be ascribed to
charge transfer of monochromate species [44], [45]. A1 and A2 samples have the highest intensity of mentioned peaks and the magnitude was reduced by increasing the Si/Al ratio. Other bands were perceived at approximately 460 and 600 nm, which can be assigned to the transition of octahedral Cr3+ in the amorphous cluster of Cr2O3. These results are in line with the consequences of XRD and Raman shifts. Due to the low charge transfer, samples with higher Si/Al ratios (A3 and A4) have lower bond intensity at 270 and 365 nm. These results reveal that A3 and A4 samples have lower Cr6+ species than other samples, which are compatible with the results of H2-TPR analysis. In addition, the intensity of two bands at 460 nm (d-d transition (A2 g
T1 g)) and 600 nm (4A2 g
4T2 g) for A1 and A2 samples are significantly lower than A3 and A4. In other words, a low Si/Al ratio can effectively prevent crystalline phase formation, according to the results of XRD and Raman spectroscopy. Thus, the Si/Al ratio can affect the coordination state of chromium species.

3.1.7. XPS characterization
The effect of Si/Al on the oxidation state of chromium species on catalysts has been studied by XPS analysis, which is illustrated in Fig. 6. As is obvious, Cr2p signal deconvolution of all catalysts has two prominent peaks at roughly 576 and 579 eV, which belongs to Cr3+ and Cr6+, respectively [18], [46]. Relative percentages of Cr3+ and Cr6+ based on the peak area of XPS analysis have been reported in Table 4. It was found that the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio of A2 (SiAl = 0.1) was increased by 0.43 compared to the pristine catalyst (A0), which indicates the enhancement in the Cr6+ active sites in the catalyst. Moreover, the binding energy of A1 and A2 samples relocate to higher values, indicating a strong interaction between Cr6+/Cr3+. These results reveal that the surface property of support can affect chromium species distribution on the catalyst surface, which agrees with XRD and H2-TPR consequences. The dispersion of transition metal oxides on supports can also be studied using XPS analysis. The surface atomic ratios of the active metal elements to the element of the support (Cr/Al) are frequently used by researchers to evaluate the dispersion of catalysts. According to Table 4, the atomic ratio of Cr/Al increases in the A1 and A2 catalyst, revealing that the low Si/Al ratios have improved particle dispersion and facilitated the presence of Cr6+ species[47].

In addition, O 1 S spectrum has been shown in Fig. S5, which has two peaks indicating lattice oxygen (OL) and absorbed oxygen (OA) on the catalyst's surface. According to Fig. S5, the A2 sample has the highest OL/OA relative percentage among others, which can be ascribed to more unoccupied oxygen sites in the catalyst. Compared to the A0 sample, ASA with a low Si/Al ratio can enhance the Cr6+/Cr3+ and Cr6+/Al ratios, which reveals that ASA can be useful for stabilizing Cr6+ species. As can be seen in Fig. S5, the relative oxygen content of the surface lattice in A1 and A2 catalysts are higher than other samples. Thus, the alumina lattice is shrunk in low Si/Al ratios enhancing acidic sites and dehydrogenation reactivity. α-Cr2O3 can penetrate alumina lattice because of similar lattice crystallinity [18], [36], [48]. Therefore, the formation of chromium-alumina solid solution is inhibited by ASAs with a low Si/Al ratio. These ASAs can reduce interaction between chromium and support and lead to the formation of polychromate and agglomeration of Cr2O3 crystals, which are also discussed in XRD and Raman results.
3.1.8. Temperature-programmed ammonia desorption analysis
Investigation of acidic sites was performed by NH3-TPD analysis, shown in Fig. 7. The synthesized samples profile indicates a diverse distribution of different acidic sites. For further investigation of acidic site distribution, the deconvolution of patterns was performed by Gaussian function. The profiles demonstrate three ammonia desorption peaks in the temperature ranges of 100–300, 300–450, and 450–700
℃
, which can be ascribed to weak, medium, and strong acidic sites. The amounts of different acidic sites for all samples are reported in Table 5. The Si/Al ratio remarkably impacts the amount and intensity of the catalyst’s acidic site. However, the trend of acidic sites changes by varying Si/Al ratio is not predictable for all samples. An increase in Si/Al ratio can shift weak and medium acidic sites toward higher temperatures. Compared to Al2O3 support, the acidity of the A1-A4 catalyst's surface was changed significantly. The peak related to strong sites was not observed in the A0 catalyst. The total amount of acidic sites increased with enhancement in Si/Al ratio, which is consistent with previous results [49]. In the low Si/Al ratio, the amount of strong and medium acidic sites was lower than A3 and A4 samples. While the amount of weak acidic sites was higher than A3 and A4 catalysts. According to the obtained results, a higher Si/Al ratio can lead to a decrease in AlV due to the increase in the number of Bronsted acidic sites [50], [51], [52], [53]. The acidity reaches the apex and decreases in the higher Si/Al ratio since the Al atoms on the surface are gradually covered with silicone. The trend of total acidic sites of the supported catalyst was A3 >A4 >A2 >A1 >A0. The acidity amount of A3 and A4 catalysts are close, but their weak and strong acidity is different.

3.2. Activity and performance
3.2.1. Reactivity of the catalyst
The synthesized catalysts were evaluated under mentioned conditions. The yield percentage is shown in Fig. 8; while propane conversion and propylene selectivity versus time are illustrated in Fig. S6. As is evident, an upward trend in propane conversion and selectivity to propylene is observed with decreasing Si/Al ratio. The selectivity should decrease with time at high Si/Al ratios, but almost no change was found at low ratios.

Fig. 8. Propylene yield of different catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.
Although A1 and A2 catalysts have a similar trend in yield percentage vs. time, the initial propane conversion for A1 is higher than the A2 sample. A1 and A2 have different deactivation rates; after 90 min the deactivation rate of A1 increased. According to Raman, XPS, H2-TPR analysis, the increase of activities in the early stages of the reaction can be attributed to the reduction of Cr6+ by the reactants to Cr3+, which has higher activity. Although the A0 sample has a lower propylene selectivity than A3 and A4, it showed a higher propane conversion. By increasing the ratio of Si/Al to 1 and 3, the propane conversion decreased significantly, which shows that a high Si/Al ratio has a negative impact on the performance of the PDH catalysts. After 180 min, the activity of the catalysts decreased due to the coating of active Cr species with carbon deposition during the reaction. It is noteworthy that, as can be seen in Fig. 8, in the 180 min, the yield of A3 and A4 is higher than that of A0, and the high activity of A1 and A2 is still maintained.
3.2.2. Effect of Si/Al ratio on the nature of surface Cr species
The oxidation states and coordination number of chromium species play an essential role in the PDH reaction and the reaction mechanism. Due to the presence of chromium in several oxidation states and different molecular structures, it is challenging to determine the contribution of each species to the catalytic performance. The distribution of active chromium sites and the relative amounts of these oxidation states, in addition to sample synthesize conditions such as calcination temperature and chromium loading percentage, are strongly influenced by the surface properties and acidity of the surface. Furthermore, Cr sites encounter complex changes in the oxidation state during catalyst preparation. Cr3+ and Cr6+ are the dominant oxidation states on Cr2O3/Alumina catalysts. Characterization of catalysts by different analyses discussed in the previous section showed the presence of different species of Cr6+ and Cr3+, which the nature and distribution of Cr species are related to support and Si/Al ratio. The active sites of chromium-based catalysts are defective Cr3+ sites. Thus, the dehydrogenation activity of chromium catalysts is usually attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ ions (c.u.s.) [8], [54].
The precursor of the Cr3+ active species is Cr6+, which is reduced in situ by propane or during the initial processing stage. The precursor Cr(VI) is formed during the calcination with a coordination number of 4. However, during the reduction, the formed Cr(VI) is changed to a pseudo-octahedron Cr(III) site. In low Si/Al ratios, due to the electronic properties, highly defective Cr(III) and Cr(II) species are formed, and chromium is strongly dispersed on the surface, leading to a more significant. H2-TPR results showed that A1 and A2 catalysts with low Si/Al ratios are more reducible than other catalysts, which contributes to the stronger interaction between the active site and the surface. Due to the stronger interaction of Cr3+, it is dispersed in the channel pores as small particles. The isoelectric point (IEP) of Al2O3 is more significant than that of SiO2. Therefore, at low ratios of SiO2/Al2O3, the amount of dichromate increases with the decrease of the surface IEP. In addition, the basicity of the adsorbed surface layer increases and acidic Cr2O4 quickly reacts with the primary hydroxyl group [55], [56], [57].
Increasing the Si/Al ratio can not only lead to reducing the amount of Cr6+ but can form a large amount of α-Cr2O3. There are polymeric Cr species in the form of clusters or crystalline Cr2O3, which restrict the access of the reactants to the active sites of Cr, which are harmful to the reaction. According to Fig. 9, the specific activity of propylene increases with the Si/Al ratio decrease. Comparing catalysts A1 and A2, almost a linear increase in the formation rate of C3H6 was observed with an increase in the Si/Al ratio from 0.01 to 0.1. Therefore, it is possible that after increasing the Si/Al ratio to 1, the dispersion of Cr species will increase and less crystalline Cr2O3 will be formed, leading to the active sites increase. These results were confirmed by XPS and Raman spectra.

Fig. 9. Relationship between Si/Al and specific activity.
The deactivation behavior of the catalyst during PDH was different from Si/Al ratio. As evident in Fig. 10, the deactivation rate of A0 catalysts is much higher than A1 to A4 catalysts. By comprehensive analysis of catalytic activity and XPS data, increasing the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio leads to higher propane conversion due to the reduction of monochromate Cr6+ as the precursor of active coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ sites (c.u.s.) to Cr3+ species. Therefore, in the dehydrogenation of the propane (DHP) process, Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+. This indicates that Cr6+ species are essential for the PDH reaction. Based on the mentioned results, it can be concluded that the activity of catalysts A1 and A2 is mainly caused by the participation of active Cr3+ species from more reduction of Cr6+ species, which shows that there is little relationship between the catalytic activity and the amount of Cr3+ reduced from Cr6+ species. This indicates that Cr6+ species are important for the PDH reaction. Based on the mentioned results, it can be concluded that the activity of catalysts A1 and A2 is mainly caused by the participation of active Cr3+ species from more reduction of Cr6+ species, which shows that there is little relationship between the catalytic activity and the amount of Cr3+ reduced from Cr6+ species.

The reduced Cr3+ is dispersed and can be catalyzed with higher activities. However, the role of the Cr6+ species as an active site is very significant for the dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst. There are different types of Cr3+ in the reduced catalysts, which include: (a) redox Cr3+ obtained from the reduction of Cr6+, (b) non-redox Cr3+ in the amorphous chromium phase, which was identified in both redox and oxidate samples, (c) Cr3+ present in crystalline chromium. Both redox and non-redox Cr3+ are active in dehydrogenation and crystalline α-Cr2O3 is the least active among Cr3+ phases. According to these results, the sequence of chromium activities is described as redox Cr3+ from the reduction of the Cr6+ species > non-redox Cr3+ in dispersed amorphous > crystalline Cr2O3.
Based on acid-base and d-band theory, the unsaturation of d orbitals on transition metals and Lewis’s acid M-O sites on metal oxides determine the reactivity of the PDH process. Bronsted acid sites can cause propane cracking [2]. According to the studies, increasing Si/Al ratio increases the amount of Bronsted acid sites. At high ratios of Si/Al, the Cr3+ on the surface mainly exists in inactive crystalline form, which reduces the content of Cr3+ in the channel pores. Therefore, catalysts A3 and A4 showed low activity. After TOS of 180 min, almost all species on the surface have been reduced to Cr3+. However, the high activity is still maintained, which provides important evidence of the effect of the support properties on the active chromium species. Thus, the active species can be tuned by modifying the support properties.
3.2.3. Stability
Among synthesized catalysts, the A2 sample showed the highest specific activity due to the high amount of Cr6+ species and dispersion. Despite high catalyst activity, after the reaction, some Cr6+ species were reduced to Cr3+ and the dispersion of Cr decreased. Four cycles of oxidative regeneration and reductive activation were performed to investigate the catalyst regenerative ability and stability of the A2 sample. Propane conversion and selectivity for cycles were demonstrated in Fig. 11. Compared to the fresh catalyst, the Cr species dispersion was recovered after regeneration. However, all Cr3+ cannot completely convert to Cr6+. According to Fig. 11, although high initial propane conversions were not achieved, high propane conversion and propylene selectivity remained almost unchanged, which showed the superior regenerative ability of catalyst A2.

3.2.4. Coke deposition
The coke deposition of the used catalyst after a 180-minute reaction was analyzed by thermal gravimetry analysis (TGA), which showed in Fig. 12. Previous studies reveal that many factors affect coke deposition and the amount of coke on the catalyst is not directly related to the strong acid sites. Coke deposition on chromium catalysts is related to some factors such as strong acid sites, catalytic reactivity, chromium oxidation state, the apparent density of Cr sites and catalyst structure architecture such as shape and pore size. The Si/Al ratio affects the amount of Lewis and Bronsted acids and the distribution of active Cr species. Although deactivation, especially in the micropores caused by coke accumulation is inevitable, the decreased tendencies of PDH activity indicate that there are other deactivation factors besides coke deposition. Surface Cr6+ species with a high oxidation state may have more tendency to crack and apparent surface density of Cr sites than unsaturated Cr3+ and induce the formation of more coke precursors. High propane conversion can produce more propylene and decrease the amount of Cr3+ species from Cr6+, which can affect the coupling reaction of the adsorbed olefin with each other to produce polymerization compounds, indicating that the amount of coke formation is directly related to the propane conversion and the different states of Cr6+ species oxidation with different degrees of polymerization and catalytic activity [18], [56], [58]. Therefore, the high number of active sites enhances the rate of coke formation. As is obvious in A1 and A2 catalysts, the coke formation increased with the reduction of the Si/Al ratio, which is caused by the high activity and the higher amount of Cr6+ species. According to Fig. 12, after 180 min of reaction, the yield of catalyst A2 is higher than the initial yield of catalyst A4 and still active. More coke formation in the A2 sample can be justified by its high activity.

4. Conclusion
To conclude, a novel strategy for the increase in active chromium site and propane yield was employed. ASA catalysis with different Si/Al ratios (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 3) was synthesized, composited by alumina and used as support of chromium catalysis for PDH reaction. ASA illustrated the significant impact on active chromium species. The activity evaluations show that the ASA catalysts with a low Si/Al ratio significantly improve catalytic performance compared to those based on ordinary alumina supports (A0). Different Si/Al ratios can change the distribution of Cr6+ species, reduction and surface concentration of Cr3+ on the support confirmed by H2-TPR, Raman, and XPS analysis. A1 and A2 catalysis not only showed a remarkable increase in Cr6+ species, which is known as a precursor of c.u.s. and a decrease in inactive α-Cr2O3 sites, but the highest initial propylene yield than other samples (with the value of 60% and 57%, respectively) due to the reduction of surface Cr6+ species to active Cr3+ species. A high Si/Al ratio decreased propane conversion even lower than Cr/Al (A0 sample). Si/Al increase can restrict the access of reactants to active Cr (VI) species due to the decrease in chromium reduction and increase in α-Cr2O3. Therefore, a high Si/Al ratio has a negative impact on catalysis performance. The deactivation constant (Kd) of ASA catalysis was decreased and A3 and A4 samples with Si/Al ratios of 1 and 3 were the highest stable catalysts due to the formation of α-Cr2O3 species and having the lowest Kd. The obtained results are important for improving the performance and synthesis of industrial catalysts with high activity and stability for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes.
