Regulating Ni–O–V bond in nickel doped vanadium catalysts for propane dehydrogenation
Supported vanadium catalysts are commonly investigated in industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) but still remain a great challenge to achieve high propylene selectivity and productivity. Here, Ni species were adopted to regulate the micro-structure of V2O5 supported by γ-Al2O3 via incipient wetness impregnation method. The Ni-doped vanadium catalyst exhibits an optimal propylene yield of 31.88% with a superior propylene selectivity of 85.91% compared to undoped catalyst with a propylene yield of 20.49% (propylene selectivity of 80.77%). Experimental characterizations (such as XPS, XAFS and Raman studies) and DFT calculations were combined to support that the Ni–O–V bonds are active sites for PDH and could promote the charge redistribution from Ni to V based in the Ni–O–V bonds, which greatly strengthens the adsorption of C3H8 over V sites. This endows the Ni-doped vanadium catalyst high propane conversion and superior propylene selectivity.
1. Introduction
Propylene (C3H6), as a significant feedstock in petrochemical industry, is extensively employed in fabricating a series of value-added products, such as oxygenates, polymers as well as personal care products [1], [2], [3]. Currently, commercially vast manufacture of propylene is still predominantly achieved by the steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts. As the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for the on-purpose propylene production [4]. Compared with other approaches of manufacturing propylene, direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene is emphasized by its traits of relatively high propylene yield, high profitability as well as less by-products [5]. In industrial PDH production, Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts involved correspondingly in the Oleflex and CATONFIN technologies are on behalf of the commercial and efficient strategies of propane dehydrogenation. However, problems of high price due to the scarcity of Pt resources and environmental toxicity of Cr element still remain intricate and unsolved for such traditional catalysts, thus restricting their practical application [6], [7]. Therefore, developing non-precious and environmentally-friendly catalysts is of great urgency.
The supported vanadium oxide catalysts display relatively superior activity in response to the C–H activation in converting light alkanes into olefins [8], [9], [10]. However, high deactivation rate of vanadium oxides catalysts was investigated by researchers due to both the enormous coke deposit and active lattice oxygen depletion, showing relatively low selectivity to propylene. Furthermore, on account of the variety of valence states and coexistence of complex structures, the intrinsic active site of supported vanadium oxides is still under debate. To give further insight into the nature of VOx-based catalysts, scientists made numerous endeavors to enhance the catalytic performance of the monotonous VOx with diverse modifications [11]. For example, U. Rodemerck and coworkers investigated that the extent of coke formation was directly related to the polymerization-degree of VOx species, where the highly polymerized three-dimensional V2O5 nanoparticles lead to more severe coke deposit than monomers and trimers of VOx species, suggesting that the well dispersion and suitable loading of VOx species on support can help sustain the catalytic performance and improve stability [12]. Another feasible strategy to facilitate the catalytic performance is by adding promoters to the metal oxide-based catalysts with metal elements such as Cu, Mo, Mg, Co and non-mental elements like S, P [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. Implementing such elemental doping strategies to VOx-based catalysts can tremendously modulate the chemical environment of V atoms and thus give rise to the optimization of structure-performance relationship. Gong’s group reported a newly developed VOx/Al2O3 with Mo modification, and the Mo doping in the alumina-supported structure was found to greatly activate the lattice oxygen and strengthen the V–O bond, contributing to the enhanced selectivity and stability in more than 100 reaction loops [19]. Yun et al. reported the improved catalytic performance of xCo-yV catalysts catalyst in PDH. The improved performance was associated with the fact that the presence of the V component led to the modification of the interaction of Co species with Al2O3 support [15]. The correlations between bulk V2O5 and doping elements have not been revealed clearly and their refinery structure still remained elusive. Therefore, understanding how to precisely manipulate the electron structure of V atoms, as well as elaborate the hidden nature of inter-relationships, is critical to the further development of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. Up to now, the vanadium oxide supported on γ-Al2O3 with doping nickel for the dehydrogenation of propane has been scarcely investigated.
In order to properly design the nickel doped VOx catalyst, first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were firstly conducted. Herein, nickel doped V2O5, one vanadium atom was replaced by one nickel atom, supported by γ-Al2O3 was chosen as the model catalysts, which pure V2O5, as the VOx spices, supported by γ-Al2O3 was taken as the counter catalyst. We systematically investigated their possible configurations, charge transfer, and the potential adsorption of propane on the catalysts. It can be obviously observed that pure V2O5 exhibits poorer interaction with γ-Al2O3 support, while Ni doped V2O5 crystal shows stronger interaction with γ-Al2O3 support. Furthermore, when propane was adsorbed on the catalysts, the charge density of V active site in Ni doped V2O5 surface became larger, which tends to adsorb the hydrogen atom in the terminal methyl group of C3H8, exhibiting more actively dehydrogenation of propane, compare to undoped V2O5.
The experimental investigation confirms this calculation. A series of Ni-doped V2O5 catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. The Ni-doped vanadium catalyst with the Ni/V molar ratio of 1:10 achieves an optimal propylene yield of 31.88% with a superior propylene selectivity of 85.91%. Experimental characterizations, such as XRD, TEM, FITR, Raman, XPS, XAFS, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, were applied to confirm the evolution of the micro-structure of V2O5 catalysts and the formation of Ni–O–V bonds in Ni-doped catalysts. DFT calculations furtherly support that the Ni–O–V bonds are active sites for PDH and could promote the charge redistribution from Ni to V based in the Ni–O–V bonds, which greatly strengthen the H-adsorption of C3H8 over V sites.
2. Experiment
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Ni-VOx/Al2O3 samples were synthesized via an incipient wetness impregnation method. The synthesis of 40 wt% VOx/Al2O3 was accomplished by dissolving NH4VO3 (Aladdin, 99.5%) and oxalic acid dihydrate (Aladdin, 99.0%) in deionized water (3 mL/1 g Al2O3), in which the molar ratio of NH4VO3/H2C2O4∙2 H2O was 0.5. Then, the mixture was stirred by a magnetic rotor in 1000 rpm at room temperature for 4 h when γ-Al2O3 (Aladdin, 99.0%) support was immersed in the solution. After impregnation, the sample was dried at 90 °C for 12 h in vacuum drying oven and subsequently calcined at 500 °C in ambient atmosphere for 2 h with a heating rate of 10 °C per minute. Ultimately, the VOx/Al2O3 was collected and marked as precursor (denoted as N0V40Al) for further doping of Ni.
As for the nickel modification of the precursor, a sequential incipient wetness impregnation experiment was conducted via using NiCl2∙6 H2O (Aladdin, 99.0%) to prepare the final Ni-doped catalysts. We labeled the Ni-doped catalysts as N4V40Al, N5V40Al, and N10V40Al, which represent the catalysts with the molar ratios of Ni/V of 1:10, 1:8, and 1:4, respectively. The synthetic condition of introducing Ni to VOx/Al2O3 was identical to the preparation procedure of precursor except that the stirring time was reduced to 30 min
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed with 2θ values from 5° to 80° with a scanning speed of 5°/min via utilizing a D/max 2500 diffractometer in which was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA with the graphite-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 nm). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and High-resolution TEM (HETEM) were conducted to confirm the morphology of catalysts using a Tecnai G2 F20 microscopy operated at 200 kV. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings were adopted to identify the chemical component of the catalysts. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on a Hitachi S-4800 operated at 3 kV. Raman spectra of catalyst sample were obtained from the LabRAM HR Evolution HORIBA Laser Microscopic Confocal Raman Spectrometer from 50 to 1400 nm−1 with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Fourier transform transmission infrared (FTIR) spectra profile were acquired from a TENSOR-27 infrared spectrometer. KBr was used as self-supporting wafer for characterization. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) measurements were conducted to detect the reducibility of samples on a chemisorption apparatus (Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920) equipped with thermal conduction detector (TCD). Prior to the experiments, 100 mg catalysts were pretreated at 400 °C in He atmosphere for 1 h and then spontaneously cooled down to 50 ℃. Subsequently, samples were placed in mixed gaseous flow of 10 vol% H2 and 90 vol% Ar (40 mL/min) in which temperature was ranging from 50 °C to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min for further reduction. NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) measurements were carried out to observe the acidity of samples on a chemisorption apparatus (Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920) equipped with thermal conduction detector (TCD). Prior to the experiments, 100 mg catalysts were pretreated at 300 °C in He flow (30 mL/min) for 1 h and then naturally cooled down to 50 ℃. Subsequently, samples were placed in mixed gaseous flow of 10 vol% NH3 and 90 vol% He (40 mL/min), allowing the acid site to be saturated with ammonia. The temperature was ranging from 50 °C to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min for ultimate desorption analysis. X-ray photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on an ESCALAB 250Xi instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), incorporating an 18.2 W laser of monochromatic Al Kα radiation. Binding energy 284.8 eV of C1s was taken as reference for experimental calibration. The data of different valance binding energy and surface atomic proportion were analyzed by the software of XPSpeak41. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements at Ni K-edge and V K-edge were performed at beamline 1W1B at Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). Ni foil, Ni2O3, and NiO for Ni spectra and V foil, and V2O5 for V were employed as the reference samples. XAFS analyses on Ni K-edge and V K-edge spectra were carried out with Athena and Artemis in the Demeter software package.
2.3. Catalytical test
A continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor was used to test the catalytic performance of our samples. Generally, 0.5 g of catalyst loaded on quartz wool was foisted into the middle of the quartz tube equipped with a thermoelectric couple inside to monitor the temperature in real- time. Prior to the test, the reactor was heated to 560 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min under ambient pressure, simultaneously pumping the pure gas N2 into the reactor with a flow rate of 9 mL/min. Then, the system was fed with a mixed gaseous flow containing a combination of N2 flow (9 mL/min) and C3H8 flow (1 mL/min) for further evaluation. In order to thoroughly reduce the propane, the whole reaction was conducted under relatively low weight hourly space velocity (WHSV=0.25 h−1). Converted product was analyzed by the online GC (Agilent 7890B) incorporated with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a mass selective detector (MSD). Catalytic stabilities of different doping ratio samples were measured via a 3-hour continuous test and integrated into the deactivation curve. The conversion and selectivity of propane were determined by the instantaneous peak area of various gas phase products detected on different time points on stream and subsequently revised by the correction factor. The results of propane conversion, propylene selectivity, propylene yield, and carbon balance were finally calculated by the following concrete equations [20]:

2.4. Computational details
First-principles calculations were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) implemented in the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP) [21], [22]. The valence electronic states were expanded on the basis of plane waves with the core-valence interaction represented using the projector augmented plane wave (PAW) approach [23] and a cutoff of 520 eV. A Γ-centered k-mesh of 2 × 2 × 1 was used for the surface calculations. Convergence is achieved when the forces acting on ions become smaller than 0.02 eV/Å.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Experimental validation
A series of Ni-doped catalysts with various Ni/V molar ratios of Ni-doped catalysts, including N0V40Al (undoped), N4V40Al (1:10), N5V40Al (1:8), and N10V40Al (1:4), were prepared. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared catalysts were showed in Fig. 1a, which was utilized to identify the crystalline phases in the catalysts. As can be seen in the XRD patterns (Fig. 2a), the prominent peaks at 15.4°, 20.3°, 21.7°, 26.1°, 31.0°, 32.4°, 34.3°correspond to the (200), (001), (101), (110), (301), (011), and (310) crystallographic plane reflections of crystalline V2O5 (JCPDS card No. 41–1426), respectively. Furthermore, crystalline phase of γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS card No. 46–1131) is also verified from XRD pattern. The (220), (040), (041), and (042) planes of γ-Al2O3 can be observed in all XRD patterns of the as-prepared catalysts. Neither NiOx species nor NiAl2O4 spinel structures can be monitored in the XRD pattern for catalysts with all Ni/V molar ratios, while three unnoticeable peaks at 27.8°, 28.9°, and 29.8°, assigned to the (200), (022), and (210) planes of Ni2V2O7 (JCPDS card No. 29–0945), become stronger with the ever-increasing Ni doping [24], [25]. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-prepared catalysts were shown in Figs. S1–S4 and Fig. 2b. We can clearly discern that the size of nanoparticles grows with the ever-increasing Ni/V molar ratio. In addition, the morphology of catalyst is transformed from nanoparticle (N0V40Al, N4V40Al, and N5V40Al) to nano-prism (N10V40Al). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) technology was further utilized to confirm the crystalline structure of the as-prepared catalysts. As shown in Figs. S5-S8 and Fig. 2c, the morphologies of Ni-doped catalysts maintained during the doping process, and the size of nanoparticle increases with the ever-increasing content of Ni element. In Fig. 2c, the TEM images of N4V40Al show that the size of nanoparticle is around 40–80 nm. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image (Fig. 2d) of N4V40Al catalyst shows obvious diffraction rings, which could be assigned to (301) plane of V2O5 and (122), (200), and (041) planes of γ-Al2O3 support, respectively. The data is consistent with that obtained from XRD patterns. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of N4V40Al catalyst is shown in Fig. 2e. The lattice space of 0.198 nm is corresponded to the (220) plane of γ-Al2O3 support; while the lattice space of 0.288 nm of a small nanoparticle can be assigned to the (301) plane of V2O5. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping results (in Fig. S5) indicate that Ni element has been successfully doped and uniformly distributed in N4V40Al catalyst. We assume that Ni atoms are uniformly distributed in the catalysts when the Ni doping is lower (for N4V40Al), while crystalline Ni2V2O7 species with abundant Ni–O–V bonds are formed with the increasing Ni doping (especially for N10V40Al).

To verify the configuration of the catalyst, Raman spectroscopies using a spectrometer with a 532 nm laser beam were carried out. This technique has been widely utilized to distinguish the VOx species in supported vanadium-based catalysts [9]. As shown in Fig. 3, all samples exhibit a set of broad bands in the range of 100–600 cm−1, which could be ascribed to various vibrational modes of segregated amorphous VOx species [26], [27], [28]. Meanwhile, A band around 705 cm−1, which is attributed to the V−O−V stretching vibration shows a slightly blue shift compared with the undoped N0V40Al precursor (702 cm−1). In addition, the band around 994 cm−1 could be assigned to the crystalline V2O5. Furthermore, a blue shift of VO stretching (994 cm−1 to 997 cm−1) can be observed with increasing loading of Ni element, confirming the modification and distortion of V−O bonds generated by the anchored Ni species. Besides, though γ-Al2O3 phase can be barely detected by visible Raman spectroscopy, a relatively weak band near 929 cm−1 ascribed to V−O−Al antisymmetric stretching can be observed in Raman spectrum of the N10V40Al sample [9], [29]. We assume that there is probably a reconstruction of surface nature, and the formation of Ni2V2O7 species at lower Ni doping could reinforce the interaction between the active sites of VOx and the support of γ-Al2O3. It is notable that the intensity of a novel set of bands at approximately 841 cm−1 and 861 cm−1 gradually magnifies as the Ni/V molar ratio increases. The emerging band at 841 cm−1 and 861 cm−1 indicates the presence of particular interaction among the Ni−O−V mixed oxide, which is ultimately validated to be the Ni−O−V stretching [30]. Generally, the consequence of Raman spectra can attest the effectiveness of our doping endeavor and modulation strategy to some extent. Together with XRD and TEM data, it can be concluded that the dominant VOx species in our catalysts is crystalline V2O5, and Ni2V2O7 species was formed during the doping procedure. When the Ni doping increases, V2O5 nanocrystal and crystalline Ni2V2O7 species coexists.

3.2. Catalytic performance
The undoped and Ni-doped catalysts with different Ni/V molar ratios were tested for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The PDH catalytic performances regarding conversion, selectivity and yield of all catalysts under specific experimental circumstance were exhibited in Fig. 4a. There was a semblable but brief induction period in the reaction initiation step, which was investigated in almost all catalyst samples. Thus, in order to conduct a more conspicuous comparison as well as analysis, only the consequences of the highest catalytic performance were recorded and calculated. As presented in the Fig. 4a, the undoped catalyst of N0V40Al exhibit a propane conversion of 28% at the initial catalytic stage but underwent remarkable decrease to approximately 14% after three-hour test. By contrast, after Ni modification, the conversion of propane over catalysts with different Ni/V molar ratios displays obvious promotions during the time on stream. All Ni-doped catalysts possessed propane conversions exceeding 30% at the preliminary point, in which the most eminent and outstanding conversion of 43% was particularly obtained by the N4V40Al catalyst. Despite undergoing time on stream of 3 h, all Ni-doped catalysts still sustain a relatively high propane conversion of over 20%. For catalytic stability, it is also notable that the most stable performance with 30% initial propane conversion and 21% at the end was observed over the N10V40Al catalyst during the test. However, remaining catalytic samples correspondingly showed unequal and relatively high deactivation rates. Such vulnerable response to continuous propane flow in elevated temperature was attributed to the severe coking which triggered the coverage and consumption of active sites [9], [25]. The propane conversion of N0V40Al precursor was common and nearly identical to the previous work.[11] However, the Ni-doped catalysts introduced here were superior to the non-doped sample, illustrating that the Ni content anchored on precursor was crucial for activating the catalytic sites as well as regulating the electronic state of vanadium.

PDH catalytic performance of the as-obtained catalysts. a) Conversions of C3H8 of as-obtained catalysts over 180 min, respectively; b) Selectivity to C3H6 of as-obtained catalysts over 180 min, respectively; c) C3H6 yields of as-obtained catalysts over 180 min, respectively d) Catalytic performance as a function of Ni/V molar ratio.
Furthermore, selectivity to C3H6 was another pivotal parameter to identify the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation. As shown in the Fig. 4b, profiles of propylene selectivity exhibit a completely reversible trend compared with propane conversion. From the perspective of changing trends, the propylene selectivity of non-doped catalyst of N0V40Al initiates at approximately 80%, which is higher than all of the Ni-doped catalysts, then the propylene selectivity fluctuated and finally maintained at around 83% after three-hour test, indicating the limited selectivity over the dehydrogenation reaction. Though with a relatively low initial propylene selectivity of 72%, the catalysts of N5V40Al and N10V40Al exhibit steady increasing propylene selectivity to 84% after 100 min and sustained as time on stream lapsing. In addition, the propylene selectivity of N4V40Al is of a moderately higher initial data of 79%, and then increases to 89% after 60 min and maintains in the following procedure. The C3H6 yields of Ni-doped catalysts are higher than that of undoped vanadium catalyst, indicating that Ni doping effectively improve the propane dehydrogenation. However, all the Ni-doped catalysts exhibit obvious yield decay in the stream reaction, which is shown in Fig. 4c.
3.3. Structure-performance correlation
It has been proved that the dehydrogenation reaction activity mainly depends on the oxidation state of vanadium species, in which V5+, V4+, and V3+ are crucial for the selective reaction [31]. In our vanadium system, the introduction of Ni species greatly improve the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation. As shown in Fig. 4d, Ni-doped catalyst with low Ni/V molar ratio (N4V40Al) achieves the optimal propane conversion and propylene selectivity. With ever-increasing Ni/V molar ratios, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of N5V40Al and N10V40Al are relatively lower, which suggests that suitable Ni doping could regulate the oxidation state of vanadium species, which may effectively tune the catalytic performance. To further uncover the structure-performance correlation of supported vanadium catalysts, H2-TPR experiments were performed to confirm the reducibility. As presented in Fig. 5, for the undoped sample of N0V40Al, a low-temperature peak at around 494 °C corresponds to the formation of V4+ from V5+, while the high-temperature peak appeared at around 556 °C is attributed to the reduction of V valance state from V4+ to V3+ [27], [32]. After embedding Ni, the predominant peaks of the catalyst undergo significant shifts to lower temperature, which are in the range of 300–400 °C and 400–500 °C respectively. With the increment of Ni doping, lower reduction temperatures are remarkably observed, indicating the enormously enhanced reactivity of lattice oxygen and reducibility of vanadium oxide on account of the Ni doping. Total reduction area and H2 consumption amount (given in Table S1) of Ni-doped catalysts are consistent with N0V40Al, establishing the carrying capacity of lattice activated oxygen is not implicated by the weakened V-O bond [12], [33]. Furthermore, another minor reduction peak located between 500 and 550 °C gradually emerges as Ni/V molar ratio increases from N4V40Al to N10V40Al, in which the temperature interval is highly conformed with the reduction profile of Ni species coordinated vanadium content and alumina support [34], [35], [36], [37], [38]. However, compared with these previous works, the peaks of as-synthesized samples exhibit a trend towards low temperature, revealing the excellent dispersion of Ni content on support and the existence of Ni-triggered intensive interaction between the VOx species and the support.

Fig. 5. H2-TPR profiles and of the as-prepared Ni-doped V2O5 catalysts.
The FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. S9) was further conducted to give an insight into the structure of the catalysts. The dominant broad band at 570 cm−1 belongs to bare γ-Al2O3 [39]. The peaks located at 830 and 1020 cm−1 correspond to the asymmetrical stretching of V-O-V units and VO respectively, establishing the presence of crystalline V2O5 phase in the as-synthesized catalysts [40], [41]. Meanwhile, all samples exhibit pronounced peaks at the wavenumber of approximately 3460 cm−1 and 1640 cm−1, which can be ascribed to the stretching of hydroxyl group from either the water adsorbed on the surface and the hydroxyl group bonded to the vanadium, respectively [42]. Notably, with the increasing concentration of Ni species, the gradually emerging band around 940 cm−1 related to asymmetrical VO4 unit stretching suggests the emergency of Ni-O-V bridging bonds [41], which is consistent with that obtained by XRD and Raman spectra.
In order to evaluate the surface acidity of the as-prepared catalysts, NH3-TPD investigations were carried out. The surface acid properties would be changed when Ni is loaded onto support surfaces [43]. In this case, it is essential to research the acidity of Ni-doped catalysts. The semi-quantitative NH3-TPD data are shown in Table S1, which are collected by the deconvolution of peaks using the Gaussian deconvolution method. The profiles of NH3-TPD for all catalysts exhibit three desorption peaks (Fig. S10). The peak centered at 170–190 °C corresponds to weak acid sites. The peak centered at 230–250 °C is attributed to medium acid sites, and the high temperature desorption peak at 350–410 °C represents strong acid sites on catalyst surface [44]. The percentage of acid sites is calculated according to their corresponding peak area. It can be observed that the Ni-doped catalysts exhibit a larger total peak area compared to pure N0V40Al catalyst. This suggests that more acid sites are formed on the surfaces of Ni-doped samples with the introduction of Ni species. The content of weak acidity for Ni-doped catalysts increases with the increment of Ni content.
X-ray photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was further performed to explore the surface elemental nature of catalyst sample as well as verify the latent promotional effect of Ni on VOx. As displayed in Fig. 6a, according to the deconvolution results, the binding energies situated at 517.7, 517.1, 516.0 eV were ascribed to the V 2p3/2 of V5+, V4+, V3+ ions in XPS V 2p spectra, respectively [26], [45]. Compared with previous work, a remarkable trend towards higher binding energy level was observed here, establishing the oligomerization of surface VOx species over alumina support [46]. With an incremental Ni loading, the binding energy of different valance states of V species exhibited to be barely discrepant (Table S2), which demonstrated the electron cloud density of V was faintly altered by Ni doping. Since V3+ and V4+ functioning increasingly active in catalytic performance, the proportion of different valance state vanadium species plays a vital role in selective dehydrogenation reaction [13], [19], Combining with the peak resolving results, V 2p3/2 peak of N4V40Al was deconvoluted to increasing V4+ and V3+ ratios which accounted for 55% and 10% compared with other catalysts. This indicates the ability of suitable anchored Ni content in regulating the average oxidation state of vanadium species. The spectra of Ni 2p was also depicted in Fig. 6b. In the case of N4V40Al catalyst, two pronounced shake-up fitting peaks of binding energy located at 856.5 eV and 874.1 eV were assigned to the Ni2+ 2p3/2 and Ni2+ 2p1/2, respectively [34], [47]. Simultaneously, two satellite peaks for Ni 2p were also appeared on account of spin-orbit coupling, in which one was deconvoluted at 862.4 eV and another at 880.5 eV [48]. The peak locations shown here were highly unmatched to the typical binding energy of NiO species (855 eV of Ni 2p3/2) with an intensive shift to higher level. Integrated with the fact that the vanadium content could increase the electron cloud density of Ni atoms, these results illustrated that a brand new chemical environment was adopted by Ni species due to the co-presence of Ni and V [49]. It can be concluded that Ni interacted with V species with bridging Ni-O-V bond, which modulates the charge density of V, which is consistent with that of XRD and Raman spectra. The band located around 74.5 eV on Al 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S11) is certified to be the γ-Al2O3 phase in our catalyst [50], [51]. Based on the O 1 s XPS spectra (Fig. S12), the three predominant peaks approximately at 530.5 531.9, 533.4 eV can be correspondingly ascribed to the oxygen environment of VOx, γ-Al2O3 as well as the O2 loosely bounded on the catalysis surface [52], [53].

The coordination environment of V and Ni species was intensively investigated via X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS). Fig. S13 exhibits the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra in the Ni K-edge of N4V40Al and N10V40Al, using Ni foil, Ni2O3 and NiO as the references. The near-edge spectra of N4V40Al and N10V40Al locate near that of NiO, implying that the valence states of those Ni species in N4V40Al and N10V40Al are of oxidized (Ni2+) status. The Fourier transform (FT) k2-weighted χ(k) function of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra (Fig. S14) of N4V40Al and N10V40Al exhibit dominant peaks at 1.62 Å for Ni–O coordination, consistent with that of NiO, which could be attributed to Ni2V2O7. By contrast, Ni foil shows a typical Ni-Ni pair at 2.20 Å. [54] The V K-edge XANES spectra of these catalysts were compared to V foil and V2O5 reference. As shown in Figs. S15, and S16, the intense pre-edge feature and edge position of both N4V40Al and N10V40Al suggest vanadium has an oxidation state between 0 and 5+, which is consistent with the XPS results [47].
DFT calculations were conducted to gain further insight into the structure of Ni-doped catalyst (N4V40Al) and its influence on catalytic performance. The propane dehydrogenation barriers over Ni-doped catalyst (N4V40Al) and non-doped N4V40Al were simulated and transition state (TS) geometries are shown in Fig. 7. The adsorption energy of propane on vanadium active in N4V40Al is − 0.37 eV, lower than that of N0V40Al (−0.12 eV), which is consistent with that of the DFT prediction and experimental data. In addition, the energy barriers of C3H8 * to TS1 (1.22 eV) and C3H6 * to TS3 (1.26 eV) for N4V40Al are lower than those of N0V40Al (1.49 eV and 1.60 eV, respectively), further implying that Ni doping facilitates propane dehydrogenation.

4. Conclusions
In summary, Ni-doped vanadium catalyst was prepared via a facile incipient wetness impregnation method with the formation of active Ni–O–V bonds for enhanced propane dehydrogenation. Combining experimental analysis, such as Raman, XPS, and XAFS, and DFT calculations show that the formed Ni–O–V bond have a profound effect on both regulating the micro-structure and electronic structure of the composite and thus resulting in improved C3H8 adsorption and C3H6 desorption free energy over V sites to achieve enhanced propane conversion and propylene selectivity. It is anticipated that this doping insight can be easily adapted for large-scale catalyst production, and for the wide spread application toward alkane dehydrogenation.
