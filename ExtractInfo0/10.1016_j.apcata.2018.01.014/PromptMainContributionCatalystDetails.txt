1. Introduction
Propylene is an important petrochemical intermediate in the manufacture of various products, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid and propylene oxide [[1], [2], [3]]. In recent years, the catalytic dehydrogenation process whereby propane is converted to propylene has become ever more important due to the growing demand for propylene and its derivatives. Propane dehydrogenation can be classified into non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The latter are still associated with various problems in actual industrial applications, such as low propylene yield and safety issues [4]. Various catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) have been studied, such as Pt-, Cr-, and Fe-based systems, with the aim of investigating the relationships between catalytic performance and structure [[5], [6], [7]]. Cr- and Pt- based catalysts are mainly used commercially for PDH. However, both types have serious insufficiency with respect to their deactivation as well as the pollution problems of Cr-based catalysts, which limit the development of PDH. Nevertheless, many novel Pt-based and other catalysts have been demonstrated to improve these shortcomings [[8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]].
V-based catalysts can be considered as one potential alternative due to their reasonable cost and environmental friendliness [16,17]. Although V-based catalysts have mostly been applied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane [[18], [19], [20], [21]], a few studies on PDH have also demonstrated attractive catalytic performance [[22], [23], [24], [25]]. For example, Ovsitser et al. reported that a dispersed VOX catalyst supported on silica showed stable catalytic performance for PDH under oxygen-free and oxygen-lean conditions, and presented 80% propylene selectivity and 45% propane conversion at 550–570 °C [22]. Sokolov et al. reported that a VOX/MCM-41 catalyst maintained high stability during regeneration cycles in comparison with CrOX/MCM-41 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3, which was ascribed to its stable structure [23]. The effects of VOx species and the support on the coke formation and stability of V-based catalysts for PDH have also been studied [[26], [27], [28]]. Bai and co-workers reported that the catalytic performance of VOX species loaded on mesoporous alumina maintained a high level, and no obvious change was observed after a second dehydrogenation (DH) cycle. The crystallization temperature of the catalyst influenced the proportion of V4+ species, which was identified as the main factor influencing catalytic activity [25]. Additionally, for V-based catalysts, it is well known that the support has a crucial influence on the surface structure and catalytic performance of vanadium species [17,29].
Mesoporous silica monoliths possess large specific surface area, highly ordered mesostructure and narrow pore size distribution, and metal ions are easily doped into their channels, demonstrating potential applications in catalysis. Mesoporous silica monoliths can also fully replicate the shape of an reactor [[30], [31], [32]]. However, there are some problems associated with the synthetic process for silica monoliths, such as the lengthy reaction period (at least 6 weeks) and low yield [33]. Fortunately, Yang et al. proposed a facile synthesis route to shorten the solvent evaporation process of silica gels for preparing host silica monoliths, using a liquid-paraffin medium to protect solvent evaporation [34]. Moreover, mesoporous silica materials loaded with different metal oxides have been extensively studied because of their uniform pore sizes and ordered pore structures, but silica monoliths have rarely been applied into the PDH process [35,36]. Yang et al. also presented a simple one-step synthetic method to obtain mesoporous silica monoliths by doping with various nanocrystals, including Co3O4, NiO, Cr2O3, SnO, In2O3 and so on. Methane conversions over Co3O4 nanoparticles loaded on mesoporous silica monoliths were higher than with other conventional supports in its combustion [32]. However, to the best of our knowledge, little information is available in the literature concerning silica monoliths doped with vanadium species and their application in the PDH process.
Herein, we describe the synthesis of vanadium-doped porous silica materials (V-SiO2) by a facile one-pot synthesis method based on the above preparation of mesoporous silica monoliths. The method is simple and environmentally friendly. Importantly, there is no loss of vanadium precursor (NH4VO3) in the preparation process. The synthesized V-SiO2 catalysts have been applied to PDH. Various characterization techniques, namely X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, low-temperature N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm measurement, UV–Vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), H2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and thermo-gravimetry (TG), have been employed to elucidate the structure and catalytic performances of the V-SiO2 catalysts in PDH. The unique structure of vanadia active sites by using the silica-based monolith causes good catalytic performance and long-term stability of the resulted catalysts. This work may provide new insight into practical applications of vanadium-doped porous silica materials.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Vanadium-doped porous silica materials were prepared by a facile one-pot synthetic method based on a previous report [32]. The preparation process is illustrated in Scheme 1. Briefly, NH4VO3 and anhydrous oxalic acid in a certain mass ratio (1:1) were dissolved in ethanol (20.00 g) and the mixture was stirred for 1 h at 45 °C. The solution was then cooled to 30 °C, P123 (EO20PO70EO20, Mw = 5800 g mol−1; 4.0 g) was added, and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 1 h. Thereafter, TEOS (8.64 g) and 1 M aqueous HCl solution (1.0 g) were respectively added dropwise, and the resulting mixture was stirred until a clear solution was obtained. The homogeneous solution was then poured into a porcelain crucible, and aged for 20 h at 30 °C to form a vanadium-doped silica gel. The gel was sealed by a 2–3 mm thick liquid paraffin layer and heated for 16 h at 60 °C to completely remove the ethanol solvent, leaving a transparent vanadium-doped porous silica solid. After heating treatment, the liquid paraffin medium was collected for reuse. Finally, the solid was calcined at 550 °C in air for 6 h to remove the block copolymer surfactant, as shown in Scheme 1. At a heating rate of 0.5 °C/min, the macromorphology of the material was retained. Herein, the obtained vanadium-doped porous silica materials (V-SiO2, diameter: 38.44 mm, height: 3.24 mm) with different mass ratios of vanadium to silicon of 1:24, 1:12, 1:6, and 1:3 are denoted as V(1)-SiO2, V(2)-SiO2, V(3)-SiO2, and V(4)-SiO2, respectively. Before catalytic tests in a reactor (8 mm diameter), the porous materials were ground and then tested in powder form (average particle size ca. 0.25 mm).

2.2. Catalyst characterizations
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were recorded on a Bragg-Brentano diffractometer (Rigaku D, Max-2000) using a monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å).
Low-temperature N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured to analyze the textural properties of samples with NOVA4000 (Quantachrome, USA) at liquid nitrogen temperature. Before measuring, the samples were degassed in vacuum at 300 °C for 4 h. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was employed to calculate the specific surface areas. The total pore volumes were calculated at the maximum relative pressure. The pore size distributions were obtained from the desorption branch of the isotherms with the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of samples were achieved with Shimadzu MPC-3100 spectrophotometer in the range of 220–600 nm, using BaSO4 as the reference. FESEM (HITACHI, S-4800) was used to observe the morphologies of samples at 5.0 kV. The FETEM images were obtained with a JEM-2010 ﬁeld emission transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. XPS spectra of samples were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA instrument, employing an Al Kα radiation source. The binding energy was calibrated with the C1s level at 284.8 eV. Raman spectra were acquired with a JobinYvon confocal laser Raman system (SuperLabRam II). The spectra were equipped with a 632.8 nm He–Ne laser source. H2-TPR curves of samples were collected on an autosorb-iQ (Quantachrome Instruments) by a thermal conduction detector (TCD). The samples were reduced in a mixture of H2 and Ar (10% H2) from 40 to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. NH3-TPD measurements of catalysts were performed on a TP-5080 adsorption instrument. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was employed to analyze the surface acidity of sample. Prior to NH3-TPD analysis, sample (∼0.1 g) was pretreated at 400 °C for 1 h under a dry He flow (30 ml/min). When cooling to 120 °C, sample was adsorbed and saturated by high purified NH3 at 120 °C for 30 min. Then, sample was blown within 45 min to remove the absorption of NH3. During desorption, NH3-TPD analysis was carried out from 120 to 800 °C (10 °C/min). TG analysis was carried out by a DTG-60H thermogravimetric analyzer (Shimadzu, Japan) to evaluate the coke deposition of spent samples under air atmosphere. The analysis was conducted from 30 °C to 800 °C (10 °C/min) using a ceramic crucible as reference.
The details of characterizations could be referred to our previous works [37,38].
2.3. Propane dehydrogenation reaction
Propane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a ﬁxed-bed quartz reactor (8mm in diameter) with 0.3 g of fresh catalyst (average particle size ca. 0.25 mm) at 580 °C and 0.1 MPa. Prior to the reaction, the reactor should be preheated under an Ar flow. The feed flow including C3H8 and Ar (C3H8/Ar molar ratio = 1/10, inlet flow = 16.5 mL min−1, propane WHSV = 0.61 h−1) was added to the reactor. The products were analyzed by a gas chromatography (GC, SP-6980) equipped with a FID detector. Propane conversion and product selectivity were calculated upon carbon atom conservation principle by formulas as:

where the subscripts of “in” and “out” represent feed flow and products respectively.
The turnover frequency (TOF, s−1) value per V species was calculated as:

where ni° is the molar flow rate of component i (mol/s), Xi is the conversion of component i, MV is the atomic mass of vanadium (50.94 g/mol), mcat is catalyst mass (g) and cV is the mass fraction of vanadium doping in the sample.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterizations
The powder XRD patterns of V-SiO2 samples with different amounts of vanadium doping are shown in Fig. 1. One broad peak centered at around 22° is observed for all of the samples, which can be attributed to the amorphous feature of mesoporous silica [39]. As can be seen, no significant diffraction peaks of crystalline V2O5 are detected below the V doping content of V(3)-SiO2 sample with a V/Si mass ratio of 1:6, indicating that the vanadium species are highly dispersed in the channels of the porous silica. However, V(4)-SiO2 sample with massive V doping, that is, a V/Si mass ratio of 1:3, shows the characteristic peaks of the crystalline V2O5 phase, implying that the vanadium species is gradually aggregated at such a high doping level [40].

The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of V-SiO2 samples with different vanadium doping levels are shown in Fig. 2a. The values of V/Si mass ratio measured by ICP are close to the real vanadium loading. The isotherms show type IV behavior, accompanied with an H-2 hysteresis loop at low pressures in the range 0.4–0.6, indicating that these materials are ink-bottle mesoporous structures, except for V(4)-SiO2 sample, and that the vanadium species influence the mesoporous structure of the pure porous silica material (a steep H-1 hysteresis) [32]. The length of the hysteresis in the isotherms of V-SiO2 samples gradually decreases with increasing vanadium doping, which is associated with the decrease in pore volume in Table 1. The corresponding pore size distribution of V-SiO2 samples is shown in Fig. 2b. The pore size, pore volume, and specific surface area of V-SiO2 samples are shown in Table 1. The pore size ranges from 3.525 to 3.507 nm. With the increase of vanadium doping, the pore volume and specific surface area gradually decrease, implying that the VOX species are located inside the pore channels of the porous silica. In particular, V(3)-SiO2 and V(4)-SiO2 samples with high vanadium doping show remarkable decreases since the effective mesoporous channels are partly blocked by vanadium species [40]. For V(4)-SiO2 sample with the high V/Si mass ratio of 1:3, the textural properties are significantly influenced by the presence of bulk crystalline V2O5. Similar observations of textural change have also been reported for V-doped mesoporous MCM-41 materials [41]. These textural properties have a significant influence on the catalytic performance towards PDH, as discussed below.

The UV–vis spectra of V-SiO2 samples with different vanadium doping levels are shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, the ligand-to-V charge-transfer (CT) bands at 200–280 nm can be attributed to isolated vanadium species (monomeric VOX species) and low-polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated VOX species with VOV bridges [42,43]. The CT band at 280–410 nm can be attributed to high-polymerized VOX species with tetrahedral and octahedral coordination. In addition, the CT band between 410 and 540 nm can be ascribed to highly polymerized VOX species (V2O5-like species) with octahedral coordination. V(1)-SiO2 sample shows only a very weak CT band at 240 nm, indicating that it predominantly contains highly dispersed monomeric VOX species at this low vanadium doping level. V(2)-SiO2 sample shows no obvious CT band after 280 nm, suggesting that it may mainly contain monomeric and low-polymerized VOX species. V(3)-SiO2 sample starts to show a slight absorbance between 280 and 410 nm, indicating the increasing of polymerization degree of vanadium species. At the high mass ratio of vanadium to silicon in V(4)-SiO2 sample of 1:3, a relatively intense CT band at about 350 nm and an obvious CT band at about 480 nm are observed, which can be attributed to a higher degree of polymerization of vanadium species and the appearance of bulk crystalline V2O5, in agreement with the XRD pattern in Fig. 1. The UV–vis edge energies (Eg) of V-SiO2 samples are shown in Table 1. These values were calculated by the Kubelka-Munk function to estimate the polymerization degree of the VOX species [44]. With the increase of vanadium doping level, the Eg values of the samples gradually decrease, implying that the ratio of high-polymerized to monomeric and low-polymerized VOX species increases [45]. According to a previous literature [46], monomeric and low-polymerized VOx species are the main active sites for PDH, but the former are easily deactivated by coke deposition. The UV–vis spectrophotometric results reveal that the degree of polymerization of vanadium species increases with increasing vanadium content.

Fig. 3. UV–vis spectra of V-SiO2 samples.
Raman spectroscopy is more sensitive than XRD for identifying crystalline V2O5, since some crystalline clusters of vanadium species (<3 nm) cannot be detected by XRD [41]. The Raman spectra of V-SiO2 samples and the pure porous silica are shown in Fig. 4. The pure silica displays characteristic bands at 428 and 492 cm−1, similar to those of amorphous SiO2, and the band at 602 cm−1 can be attributed to the symmetric stretching of SiOSi bonds [47]. The typical Raman band observed at 1015–1035 cm−1 is consistent with that of hydrated vanadium species supported on silica, and can be ascribed to symmetric vanadyl (VO) stretching of monomeric and low-polymerized VOX species with tetrahedral coordination [48]. The weak vibrational band at 915 cm−1 can be assigned to the distinctive vibration of VOSi bonds [49]. These two bands at 1015–1035 and 915 cm−1 appear for all of V−SiO2 samples except V(4)−SiO2 sample, indicating the presence of highly dispersed vanadium species, in agreement with the findings from UV–vis spectroscopy. V(4)−SiO2 sample, with a V/Si ratio of 1:3, exhibits obvious vibrational bands at 283, 303, 404, 480, 527, 701, and 995 cm−1, corresponding to the characteristic bands of crystalline V2O5, indicating the presence of bulk vanadia crystallites. Again, this is consistent with the XRD results. In Fig. 4, it can be seen that V(3)-SiO2 sample with a 1:6 V/Si mass ratio also shows weak characteristic bands of crystalline V2O5, demonstrating that the vanadium species are gradually aggregated to form vanadia crystallites with increasing vanadium doping. The results demonstrate that at moderate vanadium doping the vanadium species are highly dispersed in the materials in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOX.

Fig. 4. Raman spectra of V-SiO2 samples.
To understand the real-space morphology of the V-doped porous silica materials, the prepared V(2)-SiO2 sample was examined by TEM, as shown in Fig. 5. The TEM images in Figs. 5a exhibit a disordered worm-like pore structure, where the fine stripes indicate the pore channel network and the dark region indicates the silica matrix [50]. Selected area (electron) diffraction (SAED) is a crystallographic experimental technique that can be performed inside a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The corresponding SAED image in Fig. 5b shows no spots related to crystal structure, indicating this sample does not contain V2O5 crystallites. However, for V(3)-SiO2 and V(4)-SiO2 samples with high V/Si ratios, the formation of V2O5 crystallites is evident from the TEM images in Fig. S1 (Supporting Information), due to the presence of V2O5 lattices. These findings are in agreement with the results of XRD analysis and UV–vis and Raman spectroscopies. The EDS pattern of V(2)-SiO2 sample shows the presence of V element in Fig. 5c. Furthermore, in Figs. 5d and 5e, the EDS element mappings of V and Si display the vanadium species to be uniformly distributed on the porous silica materials. These results further indicate that the vanadium species achieve good dispersion in V(2)-SiO2 sample in this work.

The H2-TPR results of V-SiO2 samples and bulk V2O5 are shown in Fig. 6. All of V-SiO2 samples display a reduction peak between 528 and 572 °C. The reduction peaks in the TPR curves of the samples with low vanadium doping can be ascribed to monomeric or low-polymerized VOX species with tetrahedral coordination, which are essential active species for catalytic dehydrogenation [45]. This is again consistent with the results of Raman and UV–vis spectroscopies. The reduction peak shifts to higher temperature with increasing vanadium doping, suggesting that vanadium species are gradually aggregated, and the presence of bulk V2O5 at high vanadium doping retards the reduction [51]. In the H2-TPR curve of pure V2O5 shown in Fig. 6, three reduction peaks are observed at 636, 651, and 753 °C, corresponding to the three-step reduction V2O5 → V6O13 → V2O4 → V2O3 [52]. With a higher V/Si mass ratio of 1:6, V(3)-SiO2 sample exhibits a shoulder peak at 634 °C, which may be attributed to the presence of V2O5 crystallites. For V(4)-SiO2 sample, the shoulder peak at 634 °C increases markedly, and another shoulder peak can be discerned at 716 °C in Fig. 6, indicating the appearance of massive crystalline V2O5, in accordance with the UV–vis and XRD results. The H2 consumptions, H2/V ratios, and average oxidation states (AOS) of V in V-SiO2 catalysts are shown in Table 2. Both the H2 consumptions and H2/V ratios increase with increasing V-doping, but the AOS of V decreases. The results indicate that polymeric or crystalline vanadium species may be reduced to a greater degree than isolated vanadium species [53,54].

The XPS spectra of V-SiO2 samples are displayed in Fig. S2 and the valence distributions of vanadium species on the surfaces of the porous silica materials are presented in Table 3. Since V3+ species are oxidized after calcination in air, the V2p3/2 peaks can be deconvoluted into two peaks at around 517.6 and 516.6 eV attributable to V5+ and V4+ species, respectively [55]. The Si/V mass ratios of the material surfaces determined by XPS are much higher than the ratio of the actual vanadium doping, indicating that vanadium species are dispersed into the channels of the materials (Table 3). The peak area ratio of V4+/V5+ obviously decreases at high vanadium doping, suggesting that crystalline V2O5 is gradually formed with the aggregation of vanadium species, in agreement with the UV-vis and Raman results [40]. It is noteworthy that V-SiO2 samples with moderate vanadium doping contain highly dispersed vanadium species following the one-pot synthetic method. Moreover, it has been reported that V4+ species show better activity for PDH [46].

The surface acidity of catalysts influences their catalytic performance, which is closely related to the adsorption and activation of propane [37]. To determine the acidity of vanadium species on V-SiO2 catalysts, NH3-TPD measurements were conducted, and the results are shown in Fig. S3. Semi-quantitative NH3-TPD results obtained using the Gaussian deconvolution method are presented in Table 4. As can be seen, all of V-SiO2 catalysts display a similar desorption peak (peak I) centered at 165–185 °C, which corresponds to weak acid sites. The weak acid sites are ascribed to the monomeric or low-polymerized VOX species [47]. The porous silica material and the corresponding V-SiO2 catalysts display a desorption peak (peak II) at 215–250 °C ascribed to sites of medium acid sites and other desorption peaks (>300 °C) attributable to strong acid sites on their surfaces [37]. It has previously been reported that the content of vanadium doping affects the polymerization degree and surface acidity of catalysts [47]. With increasing vanadium doping, the peak due to weak acid sites shifts to higher temperature, concomitant with the increase of polymerization degree of vanadium species. Its intensity increases up to the V doping content of V(3)-SiO2 sample, and then decreases for V(4)-SiO2 sample. Also, the peak due to medium acid sites shows the similar trend, and its intensity clearly increases with increasing vanadium content. The total peak area due to acid sites increases obviously, except for V(4)-SiO2 catalyst. These results indicate that the surface acidity of V-SiO2 catalysts increases with increasing polymerization degree of vanadium species at higher vanadium doping. The bulk V2O5 has almost no strong acid sites, and its total amount of surface acidity is low in Table 4. Therefore, for V(4)-SiO2 catalyst with a 1:3 V/Si mass ratio, the total amount of surface acidity is obviously decreased, which can be attributed to the presence of bulk crystalline V2O5.

3.2. The catalytic performances of V-SiO2 catalysts for PDH
The propane conversions and propylene selectivities of V-SiO2 catalysts with different V/Si mass ratios are shown in Fig. 7. The propane conversions of all of V-SiO2 catalysts slowly decrease with time on stream. In Fig. 7, it can be seen that the propane conversions with V(2)-SiO2 and V(3)-SiO2 are obviously higher than that with V(1)-SiO2, which can be attributed to more vanadium active sites in the channels of the porous silica with increased doping. However, V(4)-SiO2 exhibits the lowest propane conversion among all of the samples, concomitant with its lowest specific surface area (Table 1) and extensive formation of crystalline V2O5 (XRD results). Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity maintains good stability and slightly decreases with increasing vanadium content. However, the propylene selectivity of V(4)-SiO2 sample is the highest among all of the catalysts [25,56]. This may be attributed to its lowest propane conversion, which results in a low propylene partial pressure and consequently low rates of consecutive reactions (cracking and coke formation). V(2)-SiO2 catalyst with a V/Si mass ratio of 1:12 shows the optimal catalytic performance for PDH, achieving a superior propane conversion from 64% to 40% and a stable propylene selectivity of about 90% over 6 h at 580 °C. Given the influence of different reaction temperatures on PDH, this V(1)-SiO2 catalyst is selected to achieve optimal reaction temperatures. Fig. 8 shows the propane conversions and propylene selectivities of V(2)-SiO2 catalyst at different temperatures. With the increase of reaction temperature, the propane conversion gradually increases at the expense of propylene selectivity. It can be observed that the catalyst reacted at 580 °C shows the best catalytic performance, where its propene selectivity maintains around 90%. The turnover frequency (TOF) values and propylene selectivities of V-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation are compared in Table 5. The TOF values of V-SiO2 catalysts used in this work are obviously higher than those of the VOX/MCM-41 catalysts studied previously under similar conditions, which can be attributed to their highly dispersed vanadium species. Although the TOF values are slightly lower than that for VOX/Al2O3 catalysts, this does not dissemble the superiority of V-SiO2 catalysts in this work. Similarly, for the ODH process, the TOF values of the supported V-based catalysts are markedly lower than those of Al2O3-supported catalysts [41,51]. It should be noted, however, that the TOF value is calculated based on the total V content, which will appear lower than the actual value when crystalline V2O5 is formed, since V species inside the crystals are not accessible. Thus, a TOF value for V(4)-SiO2 sample is not presented in this work. Additionally, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of V(2)-SiO2 catalyst at 580 °C over 21 h are shown in Fig. S4. The propane conversion over V(2)-SiO2 catalyst slowly decreases, but maintains a level of around 30% conversion after 10 h. This result suggests that V-SiO2 catalysts used in this work have good stability. Fig. S5 shows the TG curves of spent V(2)-SiO2 catalysts at 580 °C, utilized for 6, 10 and 21 h (denoted as V(2)-SiO2-6h-D, V(2)-SiO2-10h-D, and V(2)-SiO2-21h-D, respectively) in the PDH reaction. With increasing reaction time, the amount of deposited coke evidently increases between 6 and 10 h (inset table in Fig. S5). Nevertheless, the spent catalysts after 10 and 21 h of operation show have similar amounts of coke deposition. The XRD patterns of the spent V(2)-SiO2 catalysts in Fig. S6 (Supporting Information) indicate that they do not undergo any obvious structural change and that no crystalline V2O5 is formed. This may explain why V-SiO2 catalysts show good catalytic stability. The carbon balances and coke formations of the spent V-SiO2 catalysts in Fig. 7 (denoted as V(1)-SiO2-6h-D, V(2)-SiO2-6h-D, V(3)-SiO2-6h-D, and V(4)-SiO2-6h-D) are summarized in Table S1. The TG results for the spent V-SiO2 catalysts are displayed in Fig. S7. The calibrated results indicate that the carbon balance is higher than 97% [57,58]. It can be seen that the mass balances are well-matched.

3.3. Reaction-regeneration cycles
V(2)-SiO2 catalyst is selected for testing in reaction-regeneration cycles for the PDH process. The results are shown in Fig. 9. Each regeneration is conducted after PDH reaction for 6 h. The spent catalysts are calcined in situ at 580 °C under flowing air for 2 h. They are then purged with flowing Ar for another 30 min [37]. As shown in Fig. 9, the initial activity of the catalyst cannot be fully restored. The initial propane conversion is about 63% in the first DH cycle, and shows a slight decrease by 6% in the second DH cycle, possibly due to aggregation of partial VOX species and a structure change of the catalyst [59]. After the second DH cycle, the propane conversion shows no great difference, decreasing from 47% to 39%, and the propylene selectivity is maintained at a high level of around 94%, implying that the structures of the VOX species and porous silica materials have been rendered stable.

To elucidate the variation of catalytic activity, the pore sizes, pore volumes and specific surface areas of the fresh V(2)-SiO2 catalyst and the regenerated samples (V(2)-SiO2-2/6h-D and V(2)-SiO2-6/6h-D) after the 2nd and 6th DH cycles are measured, as shown in Table S2. It can been that specific surface area of the catalyst has an obvious decrease from 748.1 to 681.8 m2 g–1 and the pore volume also shows a decline from 0.58 to 0.51 m3 g–1 after second DH cycle. The result can partially explain the decrease of initial propane conversion with first two cycles. However, the textural properties are not obviously changed for the regenerated catalysts between the 2nd and 6th cycle. H2-TPR results for the fresh V(2)-SiO2 catalyst and regenerated samples are shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen that the reduction peaks are not significantly different, implying that the active VOX sites after regeneration are just as highly dispersed in the channels of the porous silica [47]. In the Raman spectra of the fresh and regenerated samples in Fig. S8, the characteristic vanadyl (VO) band at 1021 cm−1 is present in the both of the fresh and regenerated catalysts, indicating the catalyst still has good dispersion after DH reaction. Therefore, the structure change of catalysts is the main reason to the decrease of initial conversion in first two DH cycles. These results indicate that the catalyst can reach a stable state and has excellent regeneration stability after two DH cycles.

4. Conclusions
Vanadium-doped porous silica materials (V-SiO2) with different vanadium contents have been successfully prepared by a facile one-pot synthetic method, and then employed in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The prepared catalysts exhibit superior catalytic activity and good stability for PDH, which expands the possible applications of V-SiO2 materials based on the synthetic method for obtaining mesoporous silica monoliths. For V-SiO2 samples with moderate vanadium doping levels, the vanadium species are highly dispersed in the channels of the materials. Monomeric vanadium species and low-polymerized VOX species with tetrahedral coordination are the main active catalytic sites for selective PDH. Compared the VOX/MCM-41 catalysts, the catalysts exhibits relative better catalytic performance. Although the TOF values (Table 5) are slightly lower than that VOX/Al2O3 catalysts, it cannot detract the superiority of V-SiO2 catalysts. V(2)-SiO2 catalyst with a V/Si mass ratio of 1:12 displays optimal catalytic activity, providing a good propane conversion that decreases from 64% to 30% and a stable propylene selectivity of about 90% over 21 h at 580 °C. Following its regeneration behavior, it exhibits only an 8% decrease in propane conversion and stable 94% propylene selectivity after the 2nd dehydrogenation cycle, suggesting that this catalyst has excellent long-term stability. The structures of the vanadium species and porous silica materials apparently attain a stable state after the second regeneration.
