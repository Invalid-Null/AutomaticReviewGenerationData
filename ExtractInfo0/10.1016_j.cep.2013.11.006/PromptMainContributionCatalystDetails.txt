Abstract
In the isobutane dehydrogenation process, coupling reaction and separation and optimization of the intensified process can improve the isobutane conversion and selectivity, reduce operational costs and lets to produce pure hydrogen. In this research, the radial flow moving bed reactors in the Olefex technology have been supported by Pd–Ag membrane plate to remove hydrogen from the reaction zone. The reactions occur in the tube side and the hydrogen is permeated from the reaction zone to the sweep gas stream. The proposed configuration has been modeled heterogeneously based on the mass and energy conservation laws considering reaction networks. To prove the accuracy of the considered model, the simulation results of the conventional process have been compared against available plant data. The Genetic algorithm as an effective method in the global optimization has been considered to optimize the operating condition of membrane reactors to enhance isobutene productivity. In this optimal configuration, the isobutene production has been enhanced about 3.7%.

1. Introduction
Isobutene as one of the unsaturated hydrocarbons is a colorless and extremely flammable gas at standard pressure and temperature. It is used as a feedstock to produce a variety of chemical components and additives such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE) to increase the octane number of gasoline. Also, isobutene is used as a monomer or copolymer to produce synthetic rubber and various plastics. Alkylation of isobutene with butane produces isooctane as another fuel additive.
In the past, the isobutene was separated from products of naphtha steam cracking or fluidized catalytic cracking as a secondary product. Currently, because of increasing demand for olefins, some of commercial technologies have been developed for dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as isobutane, which differ in catalyst, reactor type and the utilized regeneration system. The Catofin isobutane dehydrogenation technology commercialized by ABB Lummus, is a cyclic process to produce isobutene over chromia–alumina catalyst in the adiabatic fixed-bed reactors [1], [2]. The FBD technology, commercialized by Snamprogetti, uses fluidized bed reactors followed by a continuous regenerator for isobutane dehydrogenation so deactivated catalyst is circulated continuously from bottom of the reactor to top of the regenerator [3]. In the Olefex process commercialized by UOP, the dehydrogenation reaction occurs in the several adiabatic radial flow moving-bed reactors over modified Pt–alumina catalyst considering continuous catalyst regeneration [4].
There are few articles in the literature about modeling of isobutane dehydrogenation process. Cortright et al. presented a rate equation for isobutane dehydrogenation over Pt–Sn catalysts over a wide range of temperatures [5]. Bakhshi et al. modeled a bench scale fixed bed reactor for selective dehydrogenation of isobutane at steady state condition, homogeneously [6]. Sahebdelfar et al. modeled the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene in adiabatic radial-flow moving bed reactors without considering side reactions [7]. Farsi et al. modeled the Olefex process for isobutane dehydrogenation considering reaction network at steady state condition [8]. Isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity were obtained at about 38.53% and 90.76%, respectively, which had good agreement with the plant data.
The integration of membrane separation and reaction in a vessel has attracted much attention in the recent years [9]. A membrane reactor is a piece of chemical equipment that couples a reactor with membrane layer to add reactants or remove products from the reaction zone. Removing product from reaction zone in a membrane reactor increases residence time in the reactor and shifts thermodynamic equilibrium limitations toward the higher conversion. Also, simultaneous occurrence of reaction and separation leads to the lower cost in the separation stages compared to the conventional processes. Casanave et al. studied isobutane dehydrogenation over Pt–In catalyst in a packed-bed zeolite membrane reactor [10]. Higher dehydrogenation yield was observed due to the hydrogen removal from the reaction zone. Farsi et al. modeled and optimized isobutane production in the hydrogen-permselective membrane fixed bed reactors [11]. The simulation results showed that the isobutane production can be improved about 16% in the optimized membrane configuration. Liang and Hughes studied isobutene synthesis from isobutane in a membrane reactor over Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, experimentally [12]. Also, they modeled the considered palladium/silver membrane fixed bed reactor under similar operating conditions.
In this work the adiabatic reactors in the Olefex process have been supported by Pd/Ag hydrogen permselective membrane plate at the same catalyst loading. The object of this study is heterogeneous modeling and optimization of radial flow moving bed hydrogen-permselective membrane reactors to enhance isobutene selectivity, isobutane conversion and hydrogen production. The sum of isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity has been considered as the objective function that should be maximized using genetic algorithm as a powerful method in the global optimization considering feasible decision variables. The performance of the optimized membrane reactors is compared with the conventional Olefex process. The clear advantages of this catalytic membrane reactor include: pure hydrogen production, improving isobutene productivity and selectivity and lower purification cost in the next stage.
2. Kinetics model
In the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane, side reactions such as cracking, oligomerization, isomerization, aromatization, alkylation and coking occur in the process. In the Olefex technology to increase dehydrogenation rate and minimize the effect of complex side reactions, a Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst is used. The isobutane dehydrogenation is a reversible and an endothermic reaction. Although increasing temperature and decreasing pressure shift the reaction toward completion, it promotes main side reactions and catalyst deactivation. The isobutane dehydrogenation over Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts is as follow:
(1)
i − C4H10 ↔ i − C4H8 + H2
Hydrogenolysis, propane dehydrogenation and coke formation reactions are the main side reactions that take place over the catalyst surface. The high temperature and residence time cause isobutane cracking (hydrogenolysis reaction) as the main side reaction.
(2)
i − C4H10 + H2 ↔ C3H8 + CH4
Other side reactions (propane dehydrogenation and coke formation from isobutene reactions) are as follow:
(3)
C3H8↔H2+C3H6
(4)
i − C4H8 ↔ 4C + 4H2
In this work, the kinetic models and reaction rate parameters have been selected from literature [13], [14]. The rate equations combined with the equilibrium constant provides enough information about kinetics of isobutene synthesis.
3. Process modeling
3.1. Reaction side
The conventional dehydrogenation process consists of three moving bed radial flow reactors in series that the feed stream is heated and entered to the reactors. The reactors are two concentric tubes that feed is entered from inner tube and flows along the radial direction. The outlet product from the first reactor is fed to the second reactor. Due to coke formation on the catalyst surface, the outlet catalyst from third reactor is sent to the regeneration section. In the regeneration reactor, formed coke is burnt and the regenerated catalyst is recycled to the first reactor and flows along the axial direction of reactors. Since the outlet temperature from each reactor drops due to endothermic reactions, the inter-stage heaters are placed between rectors to increase temperature. Fig. 1(a) shows the schematic diagram of the conventional Olefex process.

In this study, the conventional reactors in the Olefex technology have been supported with Pd–Ag hydrogen-permselective membrane layer. The membrane plates have been inserted in the reactors vertically along the radial direction. The produced hydrogen in the reaction zone permeates toward sweep gas. Fig 1(b) shows an elemental view of proposed membrane reactors.
In this research, a two-dimensional heterogeneous model, based on mass and energy conservation laws, has been developed to simulate Pd–Ag based hydrogen-permselective membrane reactors at steady state condition. In the heterogeneous model, temperature and concentration gradient between solid and fluid phases is considered. In the considered mathematical model, the following assumptions are adopted:
•
The gas mixture is in ideal condition (low pressure and high temperature condition).
•
Radial diffusion of mass and energy is negligible.
•
Temperature gradient in the solid phase is negligible (Biot number is less that 0.1).
•
The feed flows uniformly in the radial direction of reactors.
•
The system is well isolated.
•
The membrane is completely selective.
Subject to these assumptions, gas phase mole and energy balances are expressed by:
(5)
(6)
The mole and energy balances in the solid phase are expressed by:
(7)
(8)
Since sum of stoichiometric coefficients in right and left sides of each reaction is not same, thus the total mole changes in the radial direction. The total mole balances are expressed by:
(9)
The axial temperature and concentration gradients have been inserted in the model due to axial velocity of catalyst. Since the catalyst to gas velocity ratio is very low, total and component mole balance equations can be simplified to below:
(10)
(11)
(12)
The energy balance equations can be simplified to below:
(13)
(14)
Due to axial velocity of catalyst, the coke mass balance should be written in axial direction. In this equation, w is mass fraction of coke to the catalyst.
(15)
The pressure drop through the radial direction of the catalytic beds is calculated based on Tallmadge equation that is usable in laminar and turbulent regimes [15].
(16)
(17)
Temperature gradient and axial velocity of catalyst result an activity profile in radial and axial direction of reactors. The catalyst activity has been calculated from [16]:

3.2. Membrane side
Recently, hydrogen energy has attracted much attention due to its potential to reduce environmental burdens and the viewpoint of energy security. Hydrogen gas is highly flammable and burns in air at a very wide concentration range. The selection of processes which generate high purity and cost efficient hydrogen is a major challenge in energy supplier systems. One of the highly efficient systems to produce hydrogen is dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the membrane reactors. Generally, the Pd based membranes are completely selective and hydrogen can permeate through the layer. In this research, the isobutane dehydrogenation reactor has been supported by membrane plates to remove hydrogen from the reaction zone. Hydrogen mole flow rate increases in the sweep gas side due to hydrogen permeation from the reaction zone to the sweep gas stream. Also, heat transfer between the endothermic reaction and sweep gas stream results decreasing temperature of the sweep gas along the reactors. Mass and energy balance equations are written for sweep gas side as follows:

where the hydrogen permeation constant is [18]:

3.3. Auxiliary equations
To complete the considered mathematical model of the process, auxiliary correlations should be inserted to the model. In the heterogeneous model, heat and mass transfer coefficients between gas and solid phases, physical properties of chemical species and overall heat transfer coefficient should be estimated from proper correlations. The source of used correlations to calculate physical properties, mass and heat transfer coefficient are summarized in Table 2.

4. Optimization problem
4.1. Genetic algorithm
Genetic algorithm (GA) is an adaptive heuristic search algorithm premised on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetic [26]. It is a programming technique that mimics biological evolution as a problem-solving strategy such as inherence, mutation, selection and crossover. GA proceeds first by randomly generating an initial population of individuals. At every generation, the individuals in the population are tested according to some quality criterion that called fitness function. To form a new population in the next generation, individuals are selected according to their fitness. Selection alone cannot introduce new individuals into the population. New individuals in the search space are generated by crossover and mutation. Crossover concerns two selected individuals (parents) that exchange parts of their genomes to form two new individuals (children). Mutation consists in flipping bits of individual's strings at random. In practice, over successive generations, the population moves toward an optimal solution in the feasible domain. The main steps of the GA are given below:
•
Initialization and randomly initialize population
∘
Evaluate the objective and fitness function
∘
Apply genetic operators
∘

∘

•

In this paper, GA has been employed to obtain the global optimal condition of considered membrane reactors to enhance the isobutene production.
4.2. Objective function and constraints
In this study, the sum of isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity is considered as the operational objective function that should be maximized. Due to severe effect of temperature on reaction synthesis kinetics, optimal temperature policy is a key to optimal operation of reactors. Nine decision variables namely, feed temperature of reactors (T01, T02 and T03), inlet sweep gas temperature (T04, T05 and T06) and inlet flow rate of permeation side (F01, F02 and F03) are considered in the optimization problem. Because of thermodynamic equilibrium limitations, dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane is conducted at temperature around 600 °C to achieve reasonable commercial yields, hence an upper bound of 700 °C is chosen for feed temperature [27], [28]. The environment temperature (30 °C) is selected as the lower bound for inlet temperature of the permeation side and reactor feed. The bounds of decision variables are:
(24)
Also, three constraints are considered for optimization due to catalyst deactivation that should be satisfied along the reactors:
(25)
These constraints are incorporated into the objective function using penalty function. Penalty method is a class of optimization algorithms for solving constrained problems. The penalty method replaces a constrained problem by an unconstrained problem whose solution ideally converges to the solution of the original constrained problem. The considered objective function for minimization, finally, is thus:
(26)
5. Numerical solution
The mass and energy governing equations combined with the kinetic expressions and auxiliary correlations are comprised nonlinear algebraic, ordinary differential equations. The formulated model consists of some ordinary differential equations as an initial value problem, which is not solved analytically. This set of differential equations is solved numerically with 4th order Runge–Kutta method. At the end of this procedure, it is possible to plot the concentration of components and temperature versus reactor length.
6. Results and discussion
The mathematical model of the process that is a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations is solved numerically at steady state condition. To demonstrate the accuracy of the considered model and assumptions, the model of isobutene synthesis side is validated against the conventional Olefex process in the Imam Khomeini Petrochemical Complex (I.R. Iran) [28]. The comparison between simulation results and available plant data for the industrial case is presented in Table 3. It is observed that the simulation results of the conventional process have a good agreement with the observed plant data.

The produced coke in the heterogeneous catalytic processes involving hydrocarbon is deposited on the catalyst active sites and reduces catalyst activity. Coke deposition deactivates the catalyst by covering the active sites and pore blocking. Conventionally, to the reduce coke formation and increasing catalyst activity, the hydrogen rich feed is fed to the hydrocarbon process. Fig. 2 shows the isobutane concentration along the radial and axial direction of the third radial flow reactor in the Olefex process. In this reactor, as well as decreasing isobutane concentration in the radial direction of the reactors, catalyst activity reduction in the axial direction due to coke formation on the catalyst surface and axial velocity of catalyst result an axial profile for isobutane concentration. Thus, in the presented results, the axial average of temperature and mole fractions along the radial direction is presented. The average component mole fraction in the radial direction is as follows:

In this section, the optimal operating condition of membrane reactors is analyzed and the predicted mole flow rate, selectivity, conversion and temperature profiles are presented. Genetic algorithm is applied to determine the optimal operating conditions of the process. The goal of optimization approach is to maximize the sum of isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity. The calculated optimal value for decision variables and obtained conversion and selectivity have been summarized and compared in Table 4. This table shows that the isobutane conversion and selectivity in the optimized process is increased about 3.1% and 0.5% compared to the conventional process. Simultaneous improvement in the conversion and selectivity means higher isobutene and lower by-products production in the optimized condition.

Fig. 3 shows the isobutene molar flow rate along the optimized membrane and conventional reactors at steady state condition. According to this figure, isobutane mole flow rate at the outlet of the first, second and third optimized configuration is calculated about 80.2, 149.2 and 189.1 kmol h−1. In the optimized process, the isobutane production has been increased about 3.7% compared to the conventional process. This configuration leads to delay in thermodynamic equilibrium, while conventional reactors approach to the equilibrium in the second half of reactors, particularly in the second reactor. According to Le Châtelier's principle, when an independent variable of an equilibrium system changes the equilibrium shifts in the direction that tends to reduce the effect of the change. Hydrogen transfer from the tube side to the sweep gas decreases hydrogen concentration in the reaction zone, which shifts isobutane dehydrogenation reaction to the right side and higher isobutane is converted to isobutene. While, there is a difference between hydrogen partial pressure in the reaction and permeation sides, hydrogen can continuously pass through the membrane layer into the sweep gas side. Although lower feed temperature in the first reactor results lower isobutene production in this stage compared to the conventional reactor, productivity has been compensated and improved in the second stage due to higher feed temperature and hydrogen permeation.

According to this figure, isobutane conversion at the outlet of the first, second and third optimized configuration is calculated about 16.1%, 30.87% and 39.73%. Hydrogen permeation has a positive effect on the isobutane dehydrogenation and a negative effect on the isobutane cracking (dissociation). Hydrogen permeation from the reaction zone to the sweep gas through the membrane layer results decreasing hydrogen mole fraction in the reaction zone and shifts dehydrogenation reaction to the right side and increases isobutane conversion. Also, it shifts the dissociation reaction to the left side and decreases isobutane conversion to the methane and propane and increases isobutene selectivity.

Fig. 5(a) and (b) shows the rate of isobutane dehydrogenation and cracking reactions along the optimized membrane and conventional processes at steady state condition. Near the reactor entrance, the rate of isobutane dehydrogenation reaction is fast due to high temperature and reactant composition in the feed stream. According to this figure, methane mole flow rate as a undesired by-product is decreased about 2.25% in the optimized membrane reactors compared to the conventional process. This figure shows that a reduction in the rate of isobutane cracking is significantly higher compared to the isobutane dehydrogenation rate reduction in the first reactor. The isobutene selectivity in the membrane process has approached to 91.22% and it has been enhanced about 0.5% compared to the conventional process at the same catalyst loading (Table 5).

Fig. 6 shows the axial temperature profiles in the optimized and conventional reactors, respectively. In the isobutene production process, temperature decreases along the reactors due to the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction. In the optimized membrane configuration, the reaction side is surrounded with hydrogen permselective tube and sweep gas supplies part of heat in the reaction zone. The hydrogen permeation and heat transfer effect on the process selectivity and conversion, respectively. The sweep gas temperature has approached toward the reactor temperature due to heat transfer. The low temperature in the first reactor has improved process selectivity and high temperature in the second reactor has enhanced the isobutane conversion. The difference between temperature profile in the third conventional and membrane reactors is negligible.

The hydrogen mole flow rate in the reaction side of membrane and conventional reactors is shown in Fig. 7. Hydrogen permeation from reaction zone decreases hydrogen content in the reaction side. Although in the conventional process hydrogen content increases along the reactors, hydrogen mole flow rate decreases and its slope changes at the last part of membrane reactors due to increasing hydrogen permeation from reaction side toward sweep gas and lower rate of hydrogen production. At the initial part of membrane reactors, the lower hydrogen permeation rate and higher hydrogen production through the dehydrogenation reaction result increasing hydrogen content along the reactors. This figure shows that because of hydrogen transfer from the second reactor and hydrogen production, the rate of permeated hydrogen in the third reactor is more significant compared to other reactors. The lower permeation can be seen in the first reactor due to the low conversion and hydrogen content. According to this figure, permeated hydrogen in the optimized membrane configuration is about 70 kmol h−1.

Fig. 8 shows the coke content profile along the axial direction of the membrane and conventional reactors. The axial velocity of catalyst results a coke profile along the reactors. Produced coke in the catalytic hydrocarbon processes is deposited on the catalyst active sites and reduces the reaction rate. Coke deposition deactivates the catalyst by covering the active sites and pore blocking. The higher temperature at the reactors entrance causes the lower catalyst active sites and decreasing temperature along the radius direction results the higher catalyst activity. Therefore, the catalyst activity changes in the radial and axial directions due to reactant and catalyst movement, respectively. To reduce the coke formation and increasing catalyst activity, the hydrogen reach feed is always fed to thermal hydrocarbon processes. The predicted coke to catalyst mass fraction at the outlet of the third reactor is about 1.84%.

7. Conclusion
In this study, the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene in the Pd/Ag based hydrogen permselective membrane reactors was modeled and optimized at steady state condition. Genetic algorithm was employed to determine the optimal operating conditions of the membrane reactors considering the sum of isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity as the objective function. Also, feed temperature of reactors (T01, T02 and T03), inlet sweep gas temperature (T04, T05 and T06) and inlet flow rate of permeation sides (F01, F02 and F03) are considered as decision variables in the optimization problem. The results of mathematical simulation of an industrial case were compared with the plant data and the accuracy of the proposed model was proved. Then, it was shown that the isobutane conversion is enhanced about 3.1% in the optimized membrane process compared to the conventional process. Also, as well as 70 kmol h−1 hydrogen production, isobutene productivity in the optimized membrane process was increased about 3.7%. This optimized configuration represents some important improvements compared to the conventional process as follows: higher isobutene production rate and its selectivity, lower purification cost and hydrogen production.
