Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as an efficient complementary process for producing propylene. The fundamental understanding of reaction mechanism of traditional CrOx-based catalysts is important for designing novel PDH catalysts. Here, the evolution of surface Cr species was investigated by means of steam pre-treatment to introduce a certain amount of hydroxyl groups on deeply reductive Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts without influencing the valence states and aggregated states. The surface structural features of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts were investigated by FT-IR, TGA, XPS, NH3-TPD, and Py-IR characterization techniques. It demonstrated that more hydroxyls were produced on the surface of catalysts under steam treatment. Subsequently, hydroxyl groups were mostly removed during the H2 thermal treatment and abundant oxygen defect sites were generated. These defect sites showed an increasing number of acidic sites, thus exhibiting a relatively high PDH activity. This strategy of introducing hydroxyl groups to construct oxygen defect sites is also applicable to other oxide materials, which offers a novel perspective for rational catalyst design.

Hydroxyl group as active intermediate is helpful to construct thermally unstable oxygen defective sites of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts for catalyzing propane dehydrogenation.
1. Introduction
As an essential chemical raw material, propylene is widely utilized for producing bulk chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and acrylic acid [1]. Affected by the recent economic fluctuation, conventional processes that include not only steam cracking process but also fluidized catalytic cracking process of naphtha cannot bridge the great supply-demand gap, which provokes the urgent demand to discover an alternative method for producing propylene [2,3]. Thanks to breakthroughs in hydraulic fracturing and the rapid rise of the shale gas industry, large quantities of shale gas can be extracted in an economically efficient way, supplies of feedstock for the production of propylene have been well secured [4]. Nowadays, propane dehydrogenation has become a promising procedure for the production of propylene [3], which has superior development space and huge potential economic benefits [5].
Pt-based catalysts [6] and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts [7] are the traditional catalysts utilized in commercial PDH reactions due to their superior catalytic activities [3]. While the former is costly and the latter has potential environmental problems, thus these drawbacks greatly limit their future development [8,9]. To date, various novel catalysts have been successfully tested, such as VOx [10], Ga2O3 [11], ZnO [12], ZrO2 [13], carbon-based catalysts [14], etc. Despite this, these novel catalysts still have several drawbacks, such as low activity and rapid coking [3]. Therefore, the breakthroughs in designing an efficient, economical, and eco-friendly catalyst are still an issue to be solved.
Understanding the relations of structure and catalytic activities of CrOx-based catalysts is conducive for designing and synthesizing novel dehydrogenation catalysts. So far several valence states of Cr species were found on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, including Cr6+ species, Cr5+ species, “oligomeric” or “isolated” Cr3+ species with unsaturated coordination, “isolated” non-redox Cr3+ species, Cr3+ species over amorphous Cr2O3 or on α-Cr2O3, and Cr2+ species [15], [16], [17]. In previous studies, Cr6+ species were thought to act as key roles for enhancing the PDH catalytic activity [15]. However, in situ spectroscopy analyses revealed that Cr6+ can be instantly reduced to Cr3+ species under the strongly reducing atmosphere of the PDH reaction [18]. In addition, some research groups ascribed Cr2+ species as active sites for alkane dehydrogenation, while other research groups casted doubt on this opinion [1,16,17]. In general, various CrOx species (isolated CrOx species, dimers, trimers, polymeric CrOx species, large Cr2O3 clusters, and crystalline α-Cr2O3) with different oxidation states could coexist on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which can be attributed to an aggregation phenomenon [[19], [20]]. It has been considered that higher Cr loadings could result in the generation of polymeric species with lower activity as well as crystalline Cr2O3 [21,22]. However, Kumar et al. [19] proposed that oligomeric CrOx species possessed higher PDH activity than isolated CrOx species stabilized on xCr-Al2O3. In addition, Yi and co-authors [20] found that polymeric CrOx species are more reducible compared with isolated CrOx species, and initial reduced components of CrOx polymeric species primarily enhance catalyst's activity for PDH. Lugo [23] and Fridman [17] also proposed that α-Cr2O3 had comparable dehydrogenation activity on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts. These studies indicated that the valence states and aggregated states of the CrOx species were critical to the dehydrogenation activity of propane. However, due to the special physicochemical properties of CrOx, such as abundant valence states and the aggregation or migration of high valence CrOx, it is difficult to form a single and stable Cr species, which affected the unified understanding of PDH reaction mechanism of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts.
Here we introduced a method of steam pre-treatment on deeply reductive Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, which is not only an equivalent strategy for studying the evolution of surface CrOx species without influencing the valence states and aggregated states but also a beneficial means of clarifying the catalytic mechanism of PDH. What's more, the surface physicochemical changes and PDH activity were studied via a series of characterizations to elucidate specific active species. This work validates a novel strategy for manipulating activities and directly identifies the types of active species.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst Preparation
(1) Materials and Chemicals: Manganese acetate tetrahydrate (Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O, 99.0 %), ammonium dichromate (AR, (NH4)2Cr2O7) and hydrated gallium nitrate (Ga(NO3)3·xH2O, 99.0 %) were obtained from Shanghai Maclin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd, China. Nano titanium dioxide (AR, TiO2) was acquired from Rhawn. The γ-Al2O3 powder was obtained from Alfa Aesar. Each reagent was used as received with no further purification.
(2) Preparation of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts: Fresh catalysts were synthesized via a traditional incipient wetness impregnation process by mixing γ-Al2O3 powder and (NH4)2Cr2O7 aqueous solution with an intended 5 wt.% loading of Cr2O3. The wet samples were dried at 80 °C overnight in an oven and subsequently annealed in air at 750 °C (heating rate: 5 °C min−1) for 5 h (labeled as Cr-Ox). Then the above samples were reduced in 10 vol.% H2/Ar under 750 °C (heating rate: 5 °C min−1) for 5 h (marked as Cr-R750). Afterwards, 2.0 g of Cr-R750 were loaded in a 20 ml glass vial and transferred into an autoclave containing 2 ml of deionized water, which was then flushed with Ar for three times to remove the residual O2. After sealing, the autoclave was treated at 120 °C, 160 °C and 200 °C (heating rate: 5 °C min−1) for 6 h, designated as Cr-S120, Cr-S160 and Cr-S200, respectively. The powder samples were then annealed in 10 vol.% H2/Ar (heating rate: 2.5 °C min−1) at 550 °C for 1 h, labeled as Cr-120, Cr-160 and Cr-200, respectively.
For comparison, Cr-R650, Cr-R600 and Cr-R550 were obtained by the reduction of Cr-Ox in 10 vol.% H2/Ar for 5 h at 650 °C, 600 °C and 550 °C, respectively. And Cr-H550 was obtained by the reduction of Cr-Ox in 10 vol.% H2/Ar at 550 °C for 1 h. For other comparisons, the Cr-S200 samples were separately treated at 250 °C and 750 °C for 1h in 10 vol.% H2/Ar, designated as Cr-200-R250 and Cr-200-R750, respectively. Table 1 provides a list of the preparation conditions of various CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts.

The catalysts listed in the table were all first calcined in an air atmosphere at 750 °C for 5 h.
(3) Preparation of TiO2 catalysts: The as-received TiO2 samples were firstly calcined at 600 °C in air for 2 h (heating rate: 2.5 °C min−1) followed by a reduction procedure at 600 °C for 2 h in 10 vol.% H2/Ar.
(4) Preparation of MnOx/Al2O3 and Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalysts: MnOx/Al2O3 catalyst was produced by impregnation with the aqueous manganese acetate tetrahydrate solution as the precursor over γ-Al2O3. The aimed loading of Mn was 15 wt.%. After impregnation, the samples underwent a drying process at 80 °C in oven overnight. Finally, they were calcined at 750 °C for 5 h in 10 vol.% H2/Ar (heating rate: 2.5 °C min−1). For the synthesis of the 15 wt.% Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, the process was the same as represented above.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was operated on an X'Pert Pro Multipurpose diffractometer (PANalytical, Inc.), with the aid of a Cu Kα radiation source.The step size was 0.05°.
N2 adsorption measurements were performed on the Micromeritics ASAP-2020 analyzer. Before sorption, the adsorbed gas was removed by heating at 150 °C for 6 h in vacuum.
The SEM images of samples were performed on Gemini 300 SEM. The images of high-resolution TEM, HAADF-STEM, and EDS were obtained by Gatan977, operating at 200 kV.
XPS spectroscopies were collected over a photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) based on monochromatic Al Kα source (hν=1486.6 eV). For calibrating the electron binding-energy (BE) of the elements, the BE of the C1s was set to 284.8 eV.
The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a RIGAKU, Thermo plus EVO2 instrument in pure N2 with temperatures increasing from 50 °C to 1000 °C (10 °C min−1).
FT-IR measurements were measured on a Nicolet Magna 750 spectrometer with resolutions of 4 cm−1 and 300 scans were collected, in order to accumulate signals. Before measurement, samples were diluted with KBr (msample: mKBr = 1: 50) and pressed to discs. FT-IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine (Py-IR) was obtained using a Brooks TENSOR2 instrument. After pressing to a disc, the sample was degassed at 350 °C for 2 h. Then it was cooled down to 200 °C to adsorb pyridine, and heated to the determined temperature (fixed point temperature is 200 °C) for desorption under vacuum (1 × 10−3 Pa) for 30 minutes. The infrared spectroscopy of 1350-1650 cm−1 was recorded under vacuum at different temperatures after removing the physically adsorbed pyridine.
H2-TPR measurements were performed on BSD-Chem C200 using a flow of 30 ml min−1 of 10 vol.% H2/Ar as the reductant. The sample (0.10 g) was firstly pre-treated in a dry air stream at 600 °C for 60 min followed by cooling to room temperature. After that, it was heated to a final temperature of 850 °C (heating rate: 5 °C min−1).
NH3-TPD measurements were performed on a XCC-10 instrument. Before experimentation, 0.10 g of the sample was treated under a dry He flow (35 ml min−1) at 550 °C for 1 h (heating rate: 10 °C min−1), followed by the cooling of the sample to 120 °C for adsorbing NH3 (30 min, 20 ml min−1). Then, a He stream was purged (45 min, 20 ml min−1) to get rid of physically adsorbed NH3 from the sample. Lastly, the NH3-TPD profile was recorded with the aid of a TCD. The temperature increased from 100 °C to 500 °C (10 °C min−1).
2.3. Catalytic PDH evaluation
The catalytic experiments were conducted in a temperature-controlled quartzose fixed-bed reactor (ID: 6 mm) under atmospheric conditions. 0.50 g catalyst (0.3-0.45 mm particle size) was packed into the reactor. Then the catalyst was heated to 580 °C in a H2/N2 mixture (10 vol.%, 50 ml min−1). Prior to the PDH reaction, the fixed bed was purged with N2 flow (50 ml min−1) for an additional 10 min to remove remaining hydrogen. Afterward, the inlet gas was switched to a pure C3H8 flow (WHSV: 1 h−1). The composition of outgas mixture was collected for online analysis using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 8890) with a FID detector and a PLOT Al2O3/S quartz capillary column. Eqs.

The apparent activation energies (Ea) of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH were evaluated in separate experiments using the Arrhenius function (Eq. 4). To investigate internal and external diffusion, the particle size and flow rate were varied in the reaction in order to guarantee both internal and external diffusion were eliminated. After this, the Ea was determined under low propane conversions (0.2-10.3 %) by adjusting the test temperatures (470-570 °C) with 0.3 g of sample (WHSV: 5 h−1). Thermodynamic equilibrium conversions of PDH over a range of temperatures were also calculated for comparison. The measured conversions were far below the equilibrium conversions, indicating negligible heat and mass transfer effects.
In other comparative experiments, 0.50 g of TiO2, MnOx/Al2O3, or Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalysts were loaded into the reactor at a temperature of 600 °C. The samples were pre-treated in advance for 30 min under a mixture of flowing gases (N2: H2: H2O = 3: 2: 5, total flow: 50 ml min−1), followed by purging with N2 flow (flow rate: 50 ml min−1) for 40 min. The pure C3H8 flow was then fed into the reactor for PDH reaction (WHSV = 1 h−1). The remainder of the operations is the same as those mentioned above.
3. Results and discussion
As mentioned before, the valence states and aggregated states of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are critical for activating PDH reaction. Firstly, the propane dehydrogenation activities over Cr-Ox catalysts with different reduction temperatures were investigated (Fig. 1a). Notablely, Cr-Ox that without reduction procedure exhibited high activity (∼ 40 %). It is obvious that increasing H2 pre-treatment temperatures led decreasing of propane conversions, showing that the activities of Cr-Ox catalysts were significantly influenced by the reductive temperatures. This revealed the importance of high valence Cr species for the reaction. However, the H2-TPR profile (Fig. 1b) of Cr-Ox catalysts exhibited a reduction peak from 300 to 400 °C centered at 352.6 °C, no other peaks could be as detected in the higher temperature region, which indicates that high-valence Cr species can be easily reduced with hydrogen at high temperatures. Fridman et al. also noticed that Cr6+ species can be instantaneously converted to Cr3+ species in PDH reduction [16]. From the performance evaluation results, Cr-R750 with deep reduction showed a low PDH activity (∼ 10 %). It is considered that certain active intermediates were formed in situ during the reduction of higher-valence Cr species that are conducive for activating PDH reaction. In addition, these active species were thermally unstable and declined rapidly under high temperatures.

The pre-reduction procedure of Cr-Ox catalysts was performed in a hydrogen atmosphere where OH groups were certainly generated. Direct steam exposure is the most straightforward method for achieving surface hydroxylation of oxide materials [24]. To analyze the effect of steam on catalyst activity, additional PDH tests were performed on Cr-Ox catalysts in the presence of steam. The results is shown in Fig. S1, which reveal that the presence of steam in the reaction feed resulted in a significant activity drop, such a negative effect is mainly ascribe to the competitive adsorption of H2O and propane on the acidic site [25]. In addition, the deep reductive Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts were treated with steam for the purpose of investigating the influence of surface hydroxylation on the PDH reactions’ performance. Interestingly, the catalytic results revealed that the propane conversion over Cr-R750 after a two-step treatment (steam treatment and H2 thermal treatment) has improved significantly. The physical and chemical changes of surface Cr species were further explored by a variety of characterization methods.
3.1. Catalytic properties of PDH reaction
The dehydrogenation activities of propane over deeply reductive Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts with steam treatment were evaluated (Fig. 2a). As expected, compared to the untreated Cr-R750 catalysts, the PDH performance of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts with steam treatment obviously improved and changed regularly with the increasing of steam treatment temperature. Cr-200 achieved the highest propane conversion (∼ 26 %), which was approximately three times higher than that of Cr-R750. Besides, the values of Ea (calculated from an Arrhenius plot of the rate coefficient of dehydrogenation) for Cr-R750, Cr-120, Cr-160, and Cr-200 were estimated to be 233.2, 194.4, 178.0, and 168.4 kJ mol−1, respectively (Fig. 2b). It can be noticed that these data demonstrated good consistency with the results in Fig. 2a. Cr-200 showed a lowest value of Ea, thus is expected to exhibit the highest catalytic activity.

It is worth pointing out that the H2 atmosphere in the thermal treatment process is not a necessity. The performance results of Cr-S200 carried out with thermal treatment under N2 or Ar atmosphere were shown in Fig. S2, which shows that the performance of Cr-S200 with thermal treatment under H2, N2 or Ar atmosphere displayed similar catalytic activity. H2 as the thermal treatment atmosphere was to exclude the possibility of introducing high-valence Cr species induced by trace O2 in the gas.
3.2. Physicochemical properties of catalysts after steam treatment
The FT-IR spectrum was employed to get information concerning the surface OH-groups properties of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 3). An obvious and expansive band appeared at around 3450 cm−1, which is attributed to the stretching vibration of the surface hydroxyls, presumably from adsorbed water [26]. The quite intensity band at 1640 cm−1 is attributed to the bending vibration of the molecular water characteristic H-O-H [27]. The band appeared at 1070 cm−1 for Cr-120-R250, Cr-160-R250 and Cr-200-R250 is related to bending vibration modes of -OHAl-OH [28]. The weak bands at 731, 608, and 490 cm−1 resulted from combined adsorption of Al-O stretching vibration and Al-OH rocking librational modes of molecular water [26]. Additionally, the two characteristic bands at 3290 and 3080 cm−1 in the spectra of Cr-120-R250, Cr-160-R250, and Cr-200-R250 are attributed to the hydroxyl groups bonded differently to surface Cr ions (Cr-OH) or surface Al ions (Al-OH), and the two peaks became more prominent with the increase of steam treatment temperature, demonstrating that a certain quantity of hydroxyl groups were anchored on the catalysts’ surfaces. Based on these findings, certain amounts of M-OH (M stands for Cr or Al) species were formed after steam treatment.

3.3. Physicochemical properties after H2 thermal treatment
To obtain the phase composition information of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, XRD was performed (Fig. 4). All samples showed characteristic peaks belonging to γ-Al2O3, according to the standard card PDF#10-0425. Additionally, no discernible characteristic peaks of Cr species could be found in the XRD spectrum, manifesting that Cr species were highly distributed throughout the γ-Al2O3 support.

The images of SEM in Fig. S3a-d suggest that there were no obvious collapsing on the surfaces of the original shape of rice grain clusters following reduction treatment, steam treatment, and thermal treatment. Fig. S4a-h shows the TEM images of Cr-Ox, Cr-R750, Cr-S200, and Cr-200 catalysts. No large particles or aggregations can be clearly observed. Additional STEM-HAADF and EDS-mapping are shown in Fig. 5. The results indicate that the initial Cr species were uniformly dispersed on Al2O3 support and remained homogeneously dispersed with different treatments.

The N2-sorption method was applied to determine textural properties of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts. Cr-R750, Cr-120, Cr-160, and Cr-200 showed a similar BET surface area (177.3-194.3 m2 g−1) and a similar total volume of pores (0.48-0.56 cm3 g−1) (Table 2), revealing that the pore structure was well preserved upon the two-step treatment. Therefore, the effect of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts' skeleton structure on the catalytic properties could be excluded.

The TGA spectroscopy was employed to verify the high-temperature instability of the hydroxyl groups. Fig. 6 displays the TGA and DSC results of Cr-S200 and Cr-R750. The mass loss of Cr-S200 increased significantly in the temperature range of 250-700 °C compared with the TG results of Cr-R750, indicating that a certain amount of hydroxyl groups were introduced on the surface of Cr-R750 after steam treatment. Combined with the results of FT-IR and DSC, the first stage of mass loss is assigned to physically adsorbed water. And the second stage of mass loss is associated with the removal of chemisorbed water or surface hydroxylated species, which includes Cr-OH and Al-OH species. This dehydroxylation behavior is fundamentally corresponded well with the conclusions proposed by Gomes and co-authors [29]. Furthermore, DSC data shows an obvious endothermic peak occurred at 400-550 °C, demonstrating that the hydroxyl group introduced by steam treatment was unstable at high temperatures. This result is qualitatively consistent with the results detected by the FT-IR spectrum (Fig. 3). According to the FT-IR characterization data, new species of Cr-OH and Al-OH emerged after steam treatment. However, in the FT-IR spectroscopy of Cr-200 (Fig. 3), the peaks corresponding to -OHCr-OH and -OHAl-OH disappeared after the thermal treatment (up to 550 °C) of Cr-S200, which is credited to the elimination of hydroxyl groups at high temperatures. In addition, the hydroxyl groups were largely removed at around 500 °C (Fig. 6a), providing additional evidence that the hydroxyl groups were unstable under high-temperature atmosphere.

The surface state of Cr and O elements present on the samples were probed by XPS technique (Fig. 7). According to literature, the binding energy in the range of 576.6-578.0 eV corresponds to Cr3+ [30], and in the range of 579.9-580.2 eV is ascribed to Cr6+ in accord with the values reported in the literature [31]. In Fig. 7a, the fitting curve of the Cr 2p3/2 showed that Cr3+ and Cr6+ species were coexisted in Cr-Ox, and the content of Cr6+ species was less than that of Cr3+ species, indicating that there were still more Cr2O3 species that has not been completely oxidized. After reduction, the Cr6+ species was not detected on Cr-R750, demonstrating that H2 treatment led to a complete reduction of Cr-Ox back to Cr3+ species. In addition, Cr6+ species were absent in Cr-120, Cr-160, and Cr-200, showing that the two-step treatment did not result in the oxidation of Cr3+ species to Cr6+ species.

Fig. 7. Cr 2p XPS spectra (a) and O 1s XPS spectra (b) of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts.
The O 1s spectrum from XPS is illustrated in Fig. 7b. In general, it can be deconvoluted to three peaks and assigned to the oxygen of the lattice (OL, ≈ 530.0-530.6 eV), surface hydroxyl oxygen [27] or oxygen species adsorbed on the surface OH defects [28] (O-OH, ≈ 531.5-532.0 eV), and oxygen species on the adsorbed water (OS, ≈ 533.0-533.5 eV), respectively [32]. Based on the XPS O 1s fitting, the three kinds of oxygen species of these catalysts are listed in Table 3. The ratio of O-OH/(OL+OS) for Cr-R750, Cr-120, Cr-160, Cr-200, and Cr-200-R750 are 1.31, 1.67, 1.92, 2.06, and 1.30, respectively. The overall amount of detected O-OH showed regular changes with the increasing steam treatment temperature. According to thermogravimetric data (Fig. 6a), hydroxyl groups on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst have been largely removed above 500 °C. These results confirmed that there were more surface oxygen defect sites generated on the catalysts after two-step treatment. In previous investigations, it is indicated that abundant surface oxygen defects are critical for giving rise to Lewis base and acid center that activating heterogeneous catalysis [33]. In addition, the surface oxygen defects content of Cr-200-R750 is similar to that of Cr-R750, and the conversion rate is about one-third of that of Cr-200 (Fig. 2a), which could be due to the recovery of defect locations caused by high-temperature treatment. According to the previous analysis, there was no high-valence Cr presented on the catalysts after the two-step treatment. Thus, the displacement of binding energy could be assigned to the oxygen defects on the surface, which also suggested that more oxygen defect sites were formed during the dehydroxylation process.

The techniques of NH3-TPD and Py-IR were employed to assess the surface acidity. NH3-TPD curves are plotted in Fig. 8a and the results of peak fitting are presented in Table 4. According to Luo et al. [34], the desorption peak in the temperature scope of 120-250 °C represents weak acid, the peak appeared within 250-350 °C is due to a medium strong acid, and the desorption temperature higher than 350 °C is attributed to strong acid. All samples showed three major desorption peaks centered in the ranges of 199-233 °C, 304-317 °C, and 387-428 °C, revealing the existence of three different acid sites mentioned above. In comparison to Cr-R750, the CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts showed a decreased weak acid sites after the two-step treatment. What's more, the quantity of strong acid exhibited a varying degrees of increase accompanied with gradual increasing of total acid quantity. It indicated that the two-step treatment evidently affected the acid property and acid content of CrOx/Al2O3 samples. Admittedly, the nature of acidity essentially influenced the catalytic PDH performance of CrOx/Al2O3. The corresponding spectra of Py-IR are demonstrated in Fig. 8b. Quantitative information for the concentration of acid sites is summarized in Table 5. The adsorption peak close to 1540 cm−1 in the spectra is due to the characteristic spectral band of Brønsted acid, while the adsorption peak close to 1450 cm−1 represents the characteristic spectral band of Lewis acid [35]. Py-IR spectra show that both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites could be found in Cr-R750, Cr-120, Cr-160, and Cr-200. Notably, the content of Lewis acid sites slightly increased with the increasing of steam pre-treatment temperature. Additionally, the content of Brønsted acid for Cr-R40 was undetectable. However, Cr-R40 still displayed a high catalytic activity after 40 minutes of PDH reaction (Fig. 2a), indicating that the activities of these catalysts should not be attributed to Brønsted acid. In general, coordinatively unsaturated cations that locate on the exterior of ionic oxides typically generate external Lewis acid sites [36]. And Lewis acid sites maybe probably derived from the unsaturated structure formed after the removal of hydroxyl groups at high temperatures. Combined with the analysis of TGA, IR, and XPS, the removal of Cr-OH induced the generation of more oxygen defect sites, and the presence of rich oxygen defect sites showed higher Lewis acidity, which promoted the improvement of PDH performance.

To summarize, the steam treatment led to an increasing amount of hydroxyl groups being anchored to the surface of Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. The elimination of the surface hydroxyl groups during H2 thermal treatment would form a certain amount of oxygen defect sites. The oxygen defect sites displayed the enhancement of Lewis acidity and improved the catalytic PDH activities. Furthermore, experiments at different reduction temperatures of Cr-Ox catalysts showed that the oxygen defect sites are thermally unstable (Fig. 1a), which means fresh catalysts tend to exhibit higher activities. These findings contribute to a deep comprehension regarding the state-of-the-art for the active Cr species in PDH reactions.
As the PDH reactions are carried out under a strong reduction atmosphere, the calcined CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts contain a certain amount of high-valence Cr species, thus the hydroxyl species could certainly generate on the exterior of calcined CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts during the reduction of high-valence Cr ions [37,38]. The performance test and characterization analysis for Cr-H550 (Cr-H550 stands for Cr-Ox treated with 10% H2/N2 at 550 °C for 1 h) were added to analyze the Cr-Ox in a preliminary stage of H2 reduction. Comparing the PDH activity (Fig. S5) of Cr-200, Cr-R750, and Cr-H550 and NH3-TPD analysis (Fig. S6) of Cr-200 and Cr-H550, Cr-H550 exhibited a higher proportion of medium to strong acids as well as greater PDH activity than Cr-200. According to our present work, a plausible catalytic mechanism of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH is proposed (Fig. 9). High-valence Cr species are considered to induce the formation of a greater number of Cr-OH species at the preliminary stage of PDH reactions, with surface Cr-OH species serving as an intermediate to form a certain amount of coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ active sites, which therefore provide more sites to facilitate the PDH reactions and consequently exhibit high catalytic activities. Moreover, the formation of defect sites is in relation to the valence states and aggregated states of CrOx species. In addition, the unsaturated coordination structure is proposed to be thermally unstable that could be recovered to the catalytically inactive Cr3+ species under the long-term high-temperature reaction conditions, thereby causing the decreased activity for the PDH reactions. During the regeneration step, a certain amount of Cr3+ species could be reoxidized to Cr6+ species, and unsaturated coordination Cr3+ species are regenerated by in situ reductions of high-valence Cr species, which may be the reason why CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts can recover most of their activities. Therefore, a key factor to design catalysts with high activities for PDH reactions is to construct renewable defect sites. Relevant studies are under research.

3.4. Effect of steam treatment on other oxide catalysts for PDH reaction
Steam treatment strategies may be effective for other oxide catalysts. Fig. 10 provides the PDH results of MnOx/Al2O3, TiO2, and Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalysts without and with steam pre-treatment at 600 °C. Compared with the catalysts without steam pre-treatment, as expected, the PDH reaction activities were generally improved for all the catalysts with steam treatment. In particular, a propane conversion of 29.6 % over MnOx/Al2O3 with steam pre-treatment was obtained, which was approximately three times higher than the one without steam pre-treatment. These results illustrated that steam pre-treatment of the oxide catalysts could promote the catalytic PDH performance. It maybe that more surface defect sites on oxide catalysts were constructed by the strategy of steam pre-treatment for H2 activation and these surface defect sites could efficiently catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane.

4. Conclusions
In this work, the evolution of surface Cr species was investigated by means of two-step treatment on the deeply reductive Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. The steam treatment employed allows hydroxylating of the surface of Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. Subsequently, the H2 thermal treatment led to the removal of hydroxyl groups and induced the formation of thermally unstable oxygen defect sites, manifested as the increase of Lewis acid content and acidity, which effectively improved the activity of propane dehydrogenation. These results revealed the importance of oxygen defect sites for the catalytic activity in PDH reactions, and provided a new perspective for exploring the active sites of CrOx based catalysts. What is more, it's demonstrated that the steam treatment strategy is also effective to construct the surface defect of other oxide catalysts.
