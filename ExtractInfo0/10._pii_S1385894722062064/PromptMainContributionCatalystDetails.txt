Abstract
With BEA (Si/Al = 20) zeolite and dealuminated Si-BEA as supports, the non-noble metal Co catalysts are prepared by vacuum impregnation method to study the correlation between the catalyst structure and catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction . The optimal 0.5 wt% Co@Si-BEA catalyst exhibits over 93 % selectivity to propylene, high single-pass yield and great regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions at 590 °C. The isolated Co2+ cations are anchored in the micropores of Si-BEA zeolites through interacting with the silanol groups generated by dealumination treatment, and serve as the catalytically active sites to selectively activate the CH bonds of propane rather than dissociate the CC bonds. Furthermore, Co@Si-BEA catalyst adsorbs propylene in a favorable configuration, leading to desired adsorption features with respect to less amount and weaker strength in comparison with that on non-dealuminated Co@BEA catalyst. Therefore, the facile propylene desorption can be achieved on Co@Si-BEA catalyst, which is responsible for its high propylene selectivity, activity, and long-term stability in PDH reaction. By contrast, Co@BEA catalyst with higher density of surface Brønsted acid sites, facing with severe issues of propane CC bond scission, strong propylene adsorption and coke deposition-caused deactivation.

1. Introduction
Propylene has a great commercial value in industrial production of different kinds of chemicals and raw materials, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, etc. Its steadily increasing demand requires further capacity expansion through efficient production processes not limited to the conventional fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha. Benefited from the mass exploitation of shale gas resource, catalytically nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been recently developed as an available complement to produce propylene [1]. For propane dehydrogenation (PDH), two main groups of commercial catalysts have been applied, including PtSn/Al2O3- and CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts from Oleflex and Catofin craft, respectively [2], [3], [4]. However, considering of their existing drawbacks, i.e., high cost, high toxicity, and low cycling life, it is necessary to screen the alternative catalysts with rationally designed structure and satisfactory performance [5], [6]. Among a series of low-cost transition metals, Co-based catalysts can be one of the promising candidates for PDH reaction in view of their activity for selective activation of CH bond of light alkanes and other hydrocarbon compounds [7], [8], [9], [10], [11].
The challenges still exist for Co-catalyzed PDH reactions with respect to structural stability and catalytic activity of Co-relevant active site in the catalysts. An effective strategy to stabilize the active Co site is to select proper support and synthesis method through well regulating the interaction between Co and support sites [12], [13]. For instance, either pre-reduction of Co@MCM-41 with H2 or modification of Co@ZSM-5 with Ti4+ additive has been approved effective for stabilization of Co nanoparticles by the zeolite supports [14], [15]. It has also been reported that subnanometric Co or CoO nanoclusters encapsulated within zeolites are responsible to high activity and stability in PDH reaction due to the confinement effect of zeolites [16], [17]. When the dimension of Co site reduces from ∼ 10 nm for nanoparticle to ∼ 1 nm for nanocluster and even to single atom, not only the dispersion degree (or atomic efficiency) of Co increases, but also its interaction with supports becomes stronger. The tetrahedral Co2+ isolated site embedded in γ-Al2O3 nanosheets reveals a superior catalytic stability in comparison with the assembled Co3O4 nanoparticle due to the formation of stable spinel local structure [18]. Stabilized by SiO2 nanomeshes consisting of open channel and oxygen vacancy, the single-atom Co site also exhibits high propylene selectivity and anti-sintering stability [19]. However, the zeolite-stabilized isolate Co cations as active sites are rarely reported for PDH reaction because several factors affect the substitution of hetero metal cations in zeolites and their catalytic properties, including the topology structures, pore geometries and compositions for diverse zeolites [20], [21]. Specifically, the post-treatment (e.g., dealumination) of zeolites can regulate the pore structure and acidic property and change the accommodation of various introduced metallic sites, determining the catalytic properties in the reactions [22], [23], [24]. The Co cations introduced into zeolites can act as catalytically active Lewis acid sites (LAS) for selective PDH reaction into propylene, and they also may contribute to dehydroaromatization of C2-3 alkene intermediates to form aromatic hydrocarbons [25], [26]. On the other hand, if excessive Brønsted acid sites (BAS) are present in the modified zeolites, undesirable side reactions might be promoted for reducing propylene selectivity and forming coke species in PDH reactions [27], [28]. Therefore, fine tuning the location and chemical state of isolated Co cations in the zeolites is significant for providing in-depth insight into the structure-performance relationship of Co@zeolite PDH catalysts.
In this work, BEA zeolite with connected 12-membered rings is adopted as the ideal support of Co sites in consideration of the advantages of its higher stability at high Si amount and larger pore size than MFI-type zeolites [29], [30], [31], [32]. With the BEA (Si/Al = 20) zeolites with/without dealumination treatment as the supports (Si-BEA and BEA), a vacuum impregnation method is used to induce and anchor Co cations in the zeolite micropores with strong interaction and high dispersion [33], [34]. Structural properties of as-obtained Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts and particularly the Co-related sites are first characterized. Their catalytic performances in PDH reactions are evaluated and the key steps such as propane CH activation, propylene desorption and coke formation are further investigated by temperature-programming measurements and in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
High silica Si-BEA zeolite was obtained by dealumination treatment of commercial BEA sample (Si/Al ratio = 20, Nankai University Catalyst Co., ltd., Tianjin, China). After constantly stirring in 13 M HNO3 solution at 100 °C for 20 h, the sample was filtrated, washed several times with distilled water and dried at 100 °C in air overnight. The Co@Si-BEA catalysts with given Co loadings were prepared by a vacuum impregnation method. The zeolite support was pretreated in vacuum (10−6 torr) for 5 h. A certain amount of Co(NO3)2·6H2O solution was injected into the support powder followed by stirring in vacuum for 5 h. After drying at 80 °C for 3 h, the impregnated sample was calcined at 550 °C for 3 h in air with a heating rate of 2 oC min−1. The resultant catalysts were denoted as xCo@Si-BEA, where x represented the mass loading of Co from 0.1 to 5.0 wt%. In addition, 0.5 wt% Co@BEA catalyst as reference was obtained via same preparation method using pristine BEA zeolite as support.
2.2. Characterizations of catalysts
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping analyses were performed on a FEI Talos F200X instrument equipped with super X-spectrometer system operating at an operation voltage of 200 kV. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired with a Bruker AXS D8 Focus diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm), operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at –196 °C on a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ3 nitrogen adsorption instrument. Prior to the measurements, all samples were outgassed at 200 °C for 8 h under vacuum. Using the Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET) method and the Dubinin-Radushkevich equation, the specific surface area and the micropore volume of the catalysts were calculated. Based on the desorption branch of isotherms at a relative pressure P/P0 of 0.98, the total pore volume was also determined. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer Avio 200) was employed to quantify the contents of Al, Co, and Si elements of the catalysts. For coke measurement, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of coke was conducted under an air flow on a Mettler Toledo TGA2 instrument from 30 to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
Using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrometer with a 150 mm integrating sphere, the ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance (UV-vis-DR) spectrum was recorded from 200 to 800 nm. X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra were obtained on a Thermo Fisher Nexsa instrument with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray radiation source (1486.6 eV). The reported binding energies were calibrated using the C1s peak at 284.6 eV as a reference. The Raman spectra of samples were obtained on a Horiba HR Evolution spectrometer with 325 nm excitation laser, performed at 1 s exposure time and 3 accumulations. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured at room temperature on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 spectrometer with a mercuric cadmium telluride (MCT) detector with 128 scans at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Prior to the analysis, all samples were pretreated in Ar stream (30 mL min−1) at 300 °C for 30 min. The environmental information of Si in each sample was determined from the 29Si magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectra on a Bruker 400 M NMR instrument (4 mm rotors at resonance frequency of 79.5 MHz). The obtained chemical shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS) standard at 0 ppm.
Acidic properties of zeolite samples were determined by adsorption–desorption of pyridine followed by the transmission infrared spectroscopy on a Thermo Nicolet iS50 spectrometer with 32 scans and 4 cm−1 resolution. The sample with a certain using amount was compressed into a self-supporting wafer and placed on an in-situ IR cell. The wafer was pretreated in vacuum at 300 °C for 1 h and cooled to room temperature (25 °C). After adsorption of pyridine for 30 min, degassing was then performed for 1 h for removal of the gaseous and the weakly adsorbed pyridine. The spectrum of pyridine desorption was recorded at 300 °C. The spectrum was plotted after mass normalization.
The X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments, including X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), were performed at BL-11B, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facilities (SSRF). For the Co K edge signals, transmission mode was adopted using gas ion chamber detectors and the X-ray beam photon energy was calibrated with 7709 eV E0 for Co foil spectrum. The sample was pressed into a thin pellet and the collected spectrum was analyzed with standard protocols [35]. From fitted Fourier transform (FT) EXAFS spectrum of Co foil, the amplitude reduction factor (S02) was set as 0.772. The coordination number (CN), bond distance (R) and Debye-Waller factor (σ2) were refined for the fits of both bonds. The wavelet transformation (WT) EXAFS processing was conducted with HAMA Fortran package from ESRF (Parameters: Morlet function, κ = 10, σ = 1) [36], [37].
The temperature-programmed measurements, including reduction with H2 (H2-TPR-MS), propylene desorption (C3H6-TPD-MS) and hydrogenation (methanation, TPH-MS), were performed on a chemisorption analyzer (Micromeritics AutoChem 2920) connected with a mass spectrometry (MS, QGA from Hiden). For H2-TPR, 200 mg of catalyst was pretreated at 500 °C for 1 h and cooled down to 30 °C under 30 mL min−1 of Ar stream. Then the sample was reduced by 1 vol% H2/Ar gas (20 mL min−1) in the temperature range of 30–1100 ℃ (heating rate of 10 ℃ min−1) for recording the signal. In the C3H6-TPD-MS experiment, the catalyst (150 mg) was pretreated in Ar stream (30 mL min−1) at 300 °C for 1 h and cooled down to 30 °C. Adsorption of propylene on the sample was lasted for 1 h. After purging with Ar for another 1 h, the C3H6-TPD-MS signal was acquired with 10 °C min−1 raising rate. With the spent catalysts after 22 h PDH reactions, TPH-MS was carried out to analyze the hydrogenation and methanation activity of the deposited coke species. Generally, 100 mg of sample was pretreated in Ar flow (30 mL min−1) at 100 °C for 1 h. With feeding 10 vol% H2/Ar gas (30 mL min−1), the MS signal of CH4 formation was monitored from 50 to 1050 °C at 5 °C min−1 heating rate.
The in-situ DRIFT spectra of C3H6 adsorption and desorption were obtained using a Thermo Nicolet iS10 spectrometer equipped with a mercuric cadmium telluride (MCT) detector and a low-temperature Harrick cell with ZnSe windows and liquid nitrogen cooler. The background spectra using dry KBr reference were recorded in N2 flow at set temperatures. Prior to the measurement, the catalyst was placed into the cell and pretreated at 500 °C for 1 h under 30 mL min−1 of N2 followed by cooling down to –20 °C. Subsequently, propylene (20 mL min−1) was absorbed on the sample for 30 min and flushed with N2 (50 mL min−1) for another 30 min. The spectra of propylene desorption were recorded under N2 (50 mL min−1) as increasing temperatures.
2.3. Catalytic PDH reactions over catalysts
Catalytic PDH reactions over the catalysts were performed under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed reactor with a quartz tube (8 mm in inner diameter). 150 mg of catalyst (40–60 mesh) was diluted with 1.5 g of quartz sand. The real catalyst bed temperature was measured using a K-type thermocouple. The catalyst was pretreated in N2 from room temperature to 590 °C (heating rate of 10 °C min−1). After reaching the steady state and removing the impurities in N2 for 30 min, the PDH reaction was started with the feeding gas of C3H8/H2/N2 (5/4/5 mL min−1). The reaction products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a TCD detector channel with a 3 m TDX-1 column and a flame ionization detector (FID) channel with a KB-Al2O3 capillary column (60 m × 0.32 mm × 10 mm). The calculations of propane conversion (Conv.(C3H8)) and propylene selectivity (Selec.(C3H6)) were based on the following equations:
Conv.(C3H8) (%) = [ Fin(C3H8) -Fout(C3H8) ] / Fin(C3H8) × 100 %
Selec.(C3H6) (%) = [ (ni) ×(Fout(i)) ] / Σi [ (ni) ×(Fout(i)) ] × 100 %
where i represented the hydrocarbon product in the effluent gas, ni was the number of carbon atom of component i, and Fin(i) and Fout(i) were the corresponding flow rate for inlet and outlet gas i, respectively.
The turnover frequency (TOF) per Co atom for the catalyzed PDH reaction with low conversion levels was also calculated according to the following equation:
TOF = [ nin(C3H8) × Conv.(C3H8) ] / nCo
where nin(C3H8) and nCo were the molar number of the feeding C3H8 and Co in the catalyst, respectively.
The temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) for PDH reaction was performed in the same fixed-bed quartz tube reactor. The products including C3H6, C2H6, C2H4, CH4, C6H6 and C7H8 were monitored by an online MS. 150 mg of catalyst was pretreated in 30 mL min−1 of N2 at 300 °C for 1 h to remove impurities on the surface. Subsequently, a mixture gas of N2, H2 and C3H8 (5/4/5 mL min−1) was co-fed into the fixed-bed reactor from 300 to 680 ℃ (heating rate of 10 ℃ min−1) to collect the MS signals.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural properties of the catalysts
The Si-BEA zeolite without Al species was obtained from the dealumination treatment of the commercial BEA zeolite with a Si/Al ratio of ∼ 20. The Co catalysts of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA were prepared through the vacuum impregnation method using supports of the BEA zeolites with/without Al species. According to the ICP-OES results of the digested zeolite samples, the Si/Al ratios were near 1000 for the dealuminated Si-BEA and Co@Si-BEA, confirming the removal of Al species from the zeolite frameworks. The Co loadings of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts were also identified as 0.49 and 0.40 wt%, respectively, as listed in Table 1.

In the XRD patterns as shown in Fig. S1, typical diffraction peaks of BEA zeolite were observed on all samples, indicating that neither the dealumination treatment nor the introduction of Co species could significantly change the zeolite topological structures. Furthermore, the signals of Co– or CoOx-related phases were absent in the patterns of the Co-containing Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts, which might be attributed to the low content of Co species or their high dispersion degree. Specifically, the d302 spacing values were estimated according to the position information of the peak at 22.6° (2θ), which were summarized in Table 1. The d302 values of BEA and Si-BEA zeolites were 3.9469 and 3.9058 Å, respectively, and such decrease was caused by the dealumination of the zeolite frameworks [17]. After inducing the Co species into the zeolites, in comparison with the Co-free samples, the d302 values were correspondingly increased to 3.9504 and 3.9211 Å for Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalyst, respectively. Such variation in the d302 value indicated the incorporation of Co cations into the BEA zeolites [29].
The HR-TEM images in Fig. 1 showed the zeolite morphology of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts, and the Co-relevant particles could not be observed. The EDX element mapping images in Fig. 1 further confirmed the high dispersion of various species in the zeolites at nanoscale for both two catalysts as well as the dealumination-caused significantly reduced Al/Si intensity ratio for Co@Si-BEA. N2 physisorption isotherms and texture information of these samples were shown in Fig. S2 and Table 1. All samples exhibited type I isotherms corresponding to the characteristic of microporous zeolite materials. The metal (Co, Al)-contained samples showed similar values in terms of BET surface area (ca. 450 m2 g−1), total pore volume (ca. 0.60 cm3 g−1) and micropore volume (ca. 0.17 cm3 g−1), whereas the metal-free Si-BEA sample possessed relatively larger surface area and pore volume, clarifying that the dealumination treatment was effective. It also suggested that the incorporation of a small amount of Co species in the zeolites could not significantly affect the texture structure.

The DRIFT spectra of these samples in the hydroxyl vibration range (4000–3000 cm−1) were presented in Fig. 2. For the Al-contained BEA zeolite, four distinguished bands were observed, including those of Al-OH groups (3779 and 3663 cm−1), Al-O(H)-Si groups (3607 cm−1) and Si-OH groups (3732 cm−1) [38], [39]. After the dealumination treatment, three bands of the Al-related hydroxyl groups were disappeared for Si-BEA zeolite, and there only was the Si-OH band at 3732 cm−1, which evidenced the removal of Al species from the zeolite frameworks. Furthermore, a broad band centered at ca. 3520 cm−1 was emerged, which was attributed to the formation of the silanol group at vacant T-sites [40], as illustrated in Scheme 1. For the Co-loaded Co@Si-BEA catalyst, the relative intensities of both bands at 3732 and 3520 cm−1 were decreased in comparison with those of Si-BEA, illustrating that the interaction existed between the induced Co species and diverse silanol groups (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1. Local structure evolution of BEA zeolite during dealumination and Co2+ introduction.
The 29Si MAS NMR spectra were shown in Fig. S3 for exploring the chemical environment of Si species. For the raw BEA zeolite, four peaks were at around –115, –111, –106 and –103 ppm, respectively. The peaks at –111 and –115 ppm were assigned to two different crystalline Si sites in the Si(OSi)4 environment. The peak at –106 ppm was related to the Si(OSi)3(OAl) environment, while the peak at –103 ppm was corresponded to the Si(OSi)3(OH) environment [41], [42]. The dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite showed a similar spectrum except that the peak at –106 ppm disappeared, which further proved the removal of Al species from the zeolite frameworks. Furthermore, Co@Si-BEA catalyst exhibited a weakened intensity of the peak at –103 ppm in comparison with the Co-free Si-BEA zeolite, indicating again the interaction between the Co species and silanol groups [i.e., Si(OSi)3(OH)], which was consistent with the above DRIFT spectral observation.
The state of the Co species in these zeolite-supported catalysts were characterized by XPS and UV-vis-DR spectra as well as H2-TPR profiles. The XPS Co 2p spectra further evidenced that Co2+ acted as the primary state of Co in these two catalysts, as shown in Fig. 3A. Despite the relative low signal-to-noise ratios caused by the low Co loading amounts, the spectra at Co 2p3/2 orbits could be deconvoluted into doublet of Co2+ and Co3+ as well as their satellite peak. The binding energy (BE) values of Co2+ and Co3+ states were 782.6 and 779.7 eV, respectively [18], [20]. Specifically, by analyzing the fitting peak areas, the relative ratio of Co2+ to Co3+ was estimated as 82/18 and 90/10 for Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalyst, respectively, confirming again that Co2+ was the predominant state.

The UV-vis-DR spectra in the range of 300 to 800 nm were shown in Fig. 3B, revealing the difference in Co coordination environment between Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts. A broad band centered at approximately 525 nm was obtained on Co@BEA catalyst, which might be related to the contributions of both the octahedral Co2+ species with the 4T1g→4T1g(P) transition (at 516 nm) and the tetrahedral Co2+ with 4A2→4T1(P) transition (at 537 nm) [43], [44]. For Co@Si-BEA catalyst, in addition to the band of the octahedral Co2+ species at 516 nm, a weak band at ca. 365 nm was also attributed to the octahedral Co2+ species, while the emerged strong bands at ca. 590 and 650 nm were assigned to 4A2(F)→4T1(F) and 4A2(F)→4T2(F) transition modes of the tetrahedral Co2+ species, respectively [21], [43]. Therefore, the divalent Co2+ species dominated over both Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts, and nonetheless their coordination environments depended on the varied zeolite structures caused by the dealumination treatment.
The XAS analyses of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts as well as references of Co foil and CoO afforded the structural information of Co sites in the aspect of electronic property and coordination environment. In the Co K-edge XANES spectra, the edge line and corresponding peak energy (7725 eV) for two catalysts was like CoO reference but not to Co foil, as shown in Fig. 4A, indicating that Co2+ state played a dominant role in distribution of Co species. From the FT-EXAFS spectra and fitting data, as represented in Fig. 4B and Table 2, the single main peak at R = ca. 1.6 Å was present on Co@BEA catalyst, which was attributed to the first shell Co-O bond with coordination number (CN) of 5.8 ± 0.4. For Co@Si-BEA catalyst, in addition to the Co-O bond with CN = 5.7 ± 0.7, the peak at R = ca. 2.3 Å was observed, which was corresponded to the second shell Co-(O)-Si coordination with CN = 1.2 ± 0.8. According to the WT-EXAFS spectra in contour plot, as shown in Fig. 4C-F, the differences in the coordination atoms could be visually distinguished among all samples. By compared with the feature of Co foil reference with Co-Co coordination at R = 2.2 Å, both two catalysts were not consisting of the metallic Co0 species. Furthermore, since the characteristics of neither CoO reference (R = 2.6 Å for Co-(O)-Co bond) nor spinel Co3O4 reference (R = 2.5 and 3.0 Å for Co-(O)-Co bonds) were matched with the spectra of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA, the aggregated Co oxides could also be absent in the catalysts [18]. By performing the post-synthesis method of vacuum impregnation, the Co atoms might be induced into the zeolite, existing as the isolated Co2+ cations that were incorporated in the micropores rather than into the frameworks. For Co@Si-BEA catalyst, it also evidenced that the formation of Co-(O)-Si bonds was originated from the interaction between Co and high-density silanol species of Si-BEA zeolites.

The H2-TPR-MS profiles of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts were measured for investigating the reduction behavior of the oxidative CoOx species and their interaction with the zeolite supports. As shown in Fig. 5A, a single reduction peak with starting temperature of ca. 1030 °C and peak center temperature of 1080 °C was observed on Co@BEA catalyst. As presented in Fig. 5B, a shifted reduction peak started from ca. 930 °C and centered at 1025 °C was observed on Co@Si-BEA catalyst. Such extremely high reduction temperatures generally corresponded to the isolated Co2+ cations linked to the Si atoms in the zeolite framework or cobaltous silicate species, which were originated from the reaction between Co2+ and the silanol groups in the T-sites of the zeolite [33], [45]. The absence of the low-temperature reduction signals (e.g., 400–500 °C) suggested that there were neither the clusters nor particles of CoOx located in the extra-frameworks of Si-BEA zeolites [14], [15], [46]. Furthermore, it was noted that the Al3+-contained BEA zeolites showed a higher interaction with the Co cations in comparison with the dealuminated Si-BEA zeolites.
The surface acid property of the catalysts was evaluated by the FTIR spectra of pyridine adsorption–desorption. The normalized spectra were recorded after the desorption at 300 °C, providing the amounts of LAS and BAS with relatively high strength, as shown in Fig. 6 and Table 3. Typically, the characteristic bands of LAS were found at 1450, 1490 and 1615 cm−1, while that of BAS were 1490 and 1540 cm−1 [47]. For two Al-contained samples, strong BAS and LAS bands were co-existed. The amount of BAS was 160 and 131 μmol g−1 and that of LAS was 104 and 123 μmol g−1 for BEA and Co@BEA, respectively. As a contrast, remarkably weak BAS bands were observed on two Al-free samples of Si-BEA and Co@Si-BEA (3–5 μmol g−1), indicating again removal of the Al-OH-Si species during dealumination treatment. Furthermore, the LAS bands were barely observed on Si-BEA zeolite, whereas LAS bands with higher intensity were observed on Co@Si-BEA catalyst (1 vs 14 μmol g−1), suggesting that the Co cations introduced into the zeolites could act as high-strength LAS sites.

3.2. Catalytic PDH performances
The catalytic performances of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts were evaluated in temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) of PDH in the temperature range of 300 to 650 °C. The MS signals for formation of propylene (C3H6), methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), benzene (C6H6) and toluene (C7H8) were monitored with increasing reaction temperature, as shown in Fig. 7A. For Co@BEA catalyst, C3H6 were hardly detected as the selective PDH product within whole temperature range, as presented by the blue column chart in Fig. 7B. Only small amount of C6H6 and C7H8 was formed above 600 °C. CH4 served as the primary product with a light-off temperature at approximately 500 °C (blue columns in Fig. 7C). It suggested that formation of CH4 through CC cleavage of C3H8 dominated the reaction pathway in the initial stage over either formation of C3H6 via selective CH activation or aromatization into toluene or benzene with C2-3 alkene-relevant intermediates. As a contrast, Co@Si-BEA catalyst preferred selective production of C3H6 even at the reaction temperature as low as ca. 450 °C (red columns in Fig. 7B). The reaction rate to form C3H6 was increased markedly with the temperature, whereas the CC cleavage and aromatization byproducts (i.e., CH4, C2H6, C6H6 and C7H8) could be detected at over 600 °C and at relatively low reaction rate levels (red columns in Fig. 7C), highlighting a superior C3H6 selectivity of Co@Si-BEA than Co@BEA catalyst in PDH reaction.

From above TPSR results, 590 °C could be adopted as the optimized temperature for the PDH reaction over Co@Si-BEA catalyst to achieve a maximum C3H6 yield as well as minimal yields of the byproducts. In PDH reactions at 590 °C and 3.66 h−1 WHSV, C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity of Co@Si-BEA and Co@BEA catalysts were shown in Fig. 7D. For Co@BEA catalyst, C3H6 selectivity was only 38–60 % within the initial 1 h, and CH4 and C2 molecules (C2H4 and C2H6) were the main products, which was in well agreement with the TPSR observation. With increasing time on stream, C3H6 selectivity was maintained at ca. 70 %, reflecting severe CC cleavage of C3H8 occurred during the reaction. C3H8 conversion of Co@BEA catalyst was rapidly declined from 10 % initial value (<1h) to ca. 2 % (1 ∼ 22 h). By comparison, Co@Si-BEA catalyst could steadily catalyze the selective PDH reaction for 22 h, exhibiting of 25–20 % C3H8 conversion and > 93 % C3H6 selectivity.
A high single-pass C3H6 yield could be reached by regulating the space velocity in the PDH reaction at 590 °C, and the recycling stability of Co@Si-BEA catalyst was further evaluated. The initial C3H8 conversion could reach up to 53 %, which was close to the equilibrium conversion under identical reaction conditions, and the conversion at 20 h was slightly dropped to 46 % in the first cycle, as shown in Fig. 8. In the following regeneration process, the spent catalyst was calcined in air at 600 °C for 2 h for the next cycle. In the eight reaction-regeneration cycles, the catalytic activity of Co@Si-BEA catalyst could be recovered to the initial level and high C3H6 selectivity could also be kept, illustrating a high structural stability of the active sites in the catalyst. The repeating deactivation might be mainly caused by the reversibly deposited coke species that could be removed during oxidative regeneration treatment. The identification of the structure for catalytically active sites of Co@Si-BEA catalyst as well as the coke formation would be discussed in the following sections.

3.3. Identification of catalytically active sites
Based on the above-mentioned discussions about the Co@Si-BEA-catalyzed PDH reaction, it could be speculated that catalytically active sites should be isolated Co2+ cations incorporated in zeolite micropores. To prove this speculation, the Co@Si-BEA catalysts with different Co loadings (0.1–5.0 wt%) were prepared by identical vacuum impregnation method for evaluating the relationship between their intrinsic activity and Co loading/state.
The structural characterization results on a series of Co@Si-BEA catalysts were first analyzed to acquire the information of loading-determined Co state. The XRD patterns in Fig. S4 suggested that the BEA zeolite structure was well maintained for all Co@Si-BEA catalysts. Neither Co0 nor CoOx phase was observed on the catalysts with low Co loadings (0.1–3.0 wt%), whereas the weak signal of spinel Co3O4 particles [(3 1 1) plane at 36.8°] was found on 5.0 wt% catalyst. Based on the value of full width at half maximum (FWHM) and Scherrer formula, the crystalline size of Co3O4 was estimated at ca. 10.6 nm. The dispersion of Co3O4 nanoparticles on the zeolites was also evidenced by the TEM images, as shown in Fig. S5A-C, and the lattice fringes with d value of 0.24 nm were attributed to Co3O4 (3 1 1) planes. Furthermore, the average size of the nanoparticles was approximately 10.9 nm, as presented in Fig. S5D. The UV-vis-DR spectra in Fig. 9A showed that triplet signal of Co2+ cations at ca. 520, 590 and 650 nm were observed on 0.1–1.0 wt% Co@Si-BEA catalysts. For 3.0 wt% catalyst, the feature of Co3+ species in Co3O4 phase was emerged at above 700 nm, suggesting the co-existence of Co2+ and Co3+ in the catalyst [43], [44]. Only the Co3O4 characteristics were present on 5.0 wt% catalyst, indicating that Co3O4 particles were the principal Co species supported on the Si-BEA zeolites, which was well matched with the XRD and TEM observations. As illustrated by the H2-TPR profile in Fig. S6A, 0.3 wt% Co@Si-BEA catalyst showed only one reduction peak at a high temperature (ca. 1020 °C), which was identical to that of 0.5 wt% Co@Si-BEA catalyst, confirming the single distribution of Co2+ cations. However, the low-temperature reduction signal (280–680 °C) with strong intensity was co-existed in the H2-TPR profile of 5.0 wt% Co@Si-BEA catalyst, as shown in Fig. S6B, suggesting that this high Co loading catalyst was consisted of a large amount of Co3O4 species. Limited by the capability of the zeolites for accommodation of Co2+ cations, low Co loadings of the Co@Si-BEA catalysts allowed the Co atoms to be highly dispersed as isolated Co2+ cations, whereas high loadings led to aggregation of Co atoms into Co3O4 assembles.

Fig. 9. (A) UV–vis-DR spectra, (B) specific reaction rates (r) and (C) TOFCo values in PDH reactions at 590 °C over Co@Si-BEA catalysts with different Co loadings (0.1–5.0 wt%).
The different existing states of Co could not significantly affect the high C3H6 selectivity in PDH reactions (Fig. S7), and nonetheless caused distinct catalytic activities. At controlled low-conversion (ca. 5 %) levels in the reactions at 590 °C, the specific reaction rates of various Co@SiBeta catalysts were measured, and the plot as a function of the Co loading was shown in Fig. 9B. The reaction rate raised linearly as increasing of the Co loading within 0.1–0.5 wt% range (0.57–2.94 mmol g−1 min−1) and reached the maximum (4.14 mmol g−1 min−1) at 1.0 wt% (with a nonlinear increasement from 0.5 to 1.0 wt%). Further increasing Co loading to 3.0 and 5.0 wt% resulted in remark declines of the reaction rates (2.07 and 2.35 mmol g−1 min−1). As revealed in Fig. 9C, the TOF values of 0.1–0.5 wt% catalysts were estimated at 0.6 ± 0.1 s−1, which was at a higher level in comparison with 1.0 wt% catalyst (ca. 0.4 s−1) and 3.0 and 5.0 wt% catalysts (∼0.1 s−1). Such variation trends in the reaction rates and TOF with Co loading were corresponded to the structural change of the Co-relevant active sites in the catalysts. At low loading levels (i.e., <1.0 wt%), most of Co species existed in isolated Co2+ cations and linear relationship between Co2+ amount and specific reaction rate could be achieved. At high loading levels (≥1.0 wt%), the Co species preferred to be aggregated into small Co3O4 nanoparticles with reduced active sites on the surfaces, leading to the dropped catalytic activity. Therefore, as evidenced by the linear correspondence with intrinsic activity, the Co2+ cations of Co@Si-BEA catalyst could act as the primary active sites in PDH reaction.
Furthermore, the structural stability of the zeolite catalysts, especially Co2+-related active site was investigated, with using the spent Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts after 22 h PDH reactions. The XRD patterns of two spent catalysts were shown in Fig. S8, and only diffraction peaks of BEA zeolite were observed, indicating well-maintained zeolite crystalline structure. The absence of Co-relevant phases further suggested that no over-large particles were formed through significant sintering process.
To clarify whether state of the Co-related active sites in the catalysts changed within PDH reactions, XAS analyses were conducted on the spent Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts (Table 2). The Co K-edge XANES spectra demonstrated that Co2+ state still dominated over two spent catalysts due to unchanged edge energy value (7725 eV), as shown in Fig. 4A. In addition, slightly reduced edge height reflected that the Co electron density was increased, which might be related to the partial reduction of Co2+ species during the reaction. According to the FT-EXAFS and WT-EXAFS spectra of the spent Co@BEA catalyst (Fig. 4B and 4G), there still was a single signal corresponding to the first shell Co-O bond with an almost unchanged coordination environment (CN = 5.7 ± 0.3), which confirmed that the incorporated Co2+ cations, acting as predominant Co active sites, were structurally stable against the PDH reaction. For the spent Co@Si-BEA catalyst, the FT- and WT-EXAFS spectra revealed almost unchanged CN and distance values for the first shell Co-O bond (R = 1.6 Å, Fig. 4B and 4H). Nonetheless, the scattering signal of the second shell Co-(O)-Co coordination at R = 2.7 Å and with CN = 3.0 ± 0.5 was emerged for replacing or covering the signal of Co-(O)-Si coordination that was obtained on the fresh catalyst, which suggested that ultra-small CoO nanocluster was formed through reductive structuring of Co2+ cations within the PDH reaction. It should be emphasized that only small amount of Co2+ cations were redispersed, which was evidenced by the significant gap in the strength of contours between Co-O and Co-(O)-Co bonds from the WT-EXAFS spectra (Fig. 4H). By fitting CoO structure model with the CN value of Co-(O)-Co bond, the average size of the in-situ formed CoO nanoclusters was estimated as 0.2 nm.
With the spent Co@Si-BEA catalysts after regeneration in O2/N2 at 590 °C as well as after following reduction in H2/N2 at 590 °C, the UV-vis-DR spectra were shown in Fig. S9 for exploring the co-existence of the isolated Co2+ cations with a small amount of CoO nanoclusters. For the regenerated but unreduced catalyst, the absorbance signals of Co2+ species and octahedral Co3+ of Co3O4 phase were both observed. For the reduced catalyst, there existed the feature of Co2+ species only, suggesting that the isolated Co2+ cations were stable against the regeneration process. The variation in the spectral signals also indicated that an oxidation–reduction cycle from CoO to metallic Co0 or CoO via Co3O4 intermediate state might occur during the two-stage regeneration-reduction processes. Such small-size oligomeric CoO species could be completely confined and stabilized by the micropores of the Si-BEA zeolites for therefore preventing the sintering-caused severe catalytic deactivation in the PDH reaction [17]. Furthermore, the great stability of Co@Si-BEA catalyst in the long-term reaction-regeneration recycling test could support the conclusion, eliminating the possibility that the large CoOx particles were existed in the catalyst.
3.4. Coke formation and propylene desorption property
The coke species deposited on Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts during PDH reactions were comprehensively analyzed. Based on the TGA curves in Fig. 10A, the spent Co@BEA catalyst exhibited a significantly higher amount of deposited coke species than Co@Si-BEA catalyst (15.5 % vs 4.1 %), even the former showed remarkably less C3H8 conversion within 22 h reactions. The molar ratio of formed coke to totally conversed C3H8 could be estimated to quantitatively define the selectivity for coke formation processes, which was 0.16 and 0.007 for Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalyst, respectively. Co@BEA catalyst faced a severe coke deposition issue for its deactivation within 2 h, whereas there was only small amount of coke formed on Co@Si-BEA catalyst. Raman spectra in Fig. 10B further provided the distributions of coke species and graphitization degrees. The typical G and D bands of carbon were observed on two catalysts, which could be deconvoluted into four bands with certain functions, including G (ideal graphitic layers, 1600 cm−1, Lorentzian function), D4 (disordered graphitic layers, 1495 cm−1, Gaussian function), D1 (graphitic layers with in-plane defects, 1380 cm−1, Lorentzian function), D3 (amorphous carbon, 1225 cm−1, Gaussian function) [48]. By calculating the fitted band areas, the ratios of ID1/IG were obtained as 0.77 and 0.95 for the spent Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalyst, respectively. A higher ID1/IG ratio of Co@Si-BEA catalyst highlighted its lower graphitization degree for the coke species.

The TPH-MS profiles were also acquired to evaluate the hydrogenation (methanation) activity of coke species deposited on these two catalysts. As shown in Fig. 10C, although both two catalysts exhibited similar starting temperatures for methane formation at approximately 675 °C, the methanation peak with the maximum rate was located at ca. 910 and 850 °C for Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalyst, respectively. Furthermore, a dramatically weak intensity of CH4 formation was obtained on Co@Si-BEA catalyst. Therefore, evidently higher hydrogenation activity of the coke species with less deposition amount illustrated superior coke resistance ability of Co@Si-BEA in comparison with Co@BEA catalyst.
Previous studies demonstrated for PDH reaction that over-transformation of C3H6 as intermediate could trigger sequential reaction steps, such as deep dehydrogenation and oligomerization, to produce coke precursors until graphitic coke species [5], [6], [49]. From this point of view, the interaction with C3H6 played a critical role in determining the anti-coking stability of a catalyst. The C3H6-TPD-MS profiles were plotted in Fig. 11 for analyzing adsorption–desorption property of C3H6 on the zeolites and Co catalysts. For both BEA and Co@BEA, the beginning temperature for C3H6 desorption was ca. 120 °C, while the maximum desorption temperature was 230 °C. The remarkably weaker C3H6 desorption intensity was observed on dealuminated Si-BEA and Co@Si-BEA, and specifically, their adsorption capabilities were one-thirteenth of that of Al-contained samples. Furthermore, relatively lower maximum desorption temperature was also obtained at ca. 190 °C, suggesting that C3H6 was adsorbed at dealuminated zeolites in low adsorption strength and easier to desorb as final product. Therefore, facile desorption of C3H6 could apparently enhance the PDH selectivity of Co@Si-BEA as well as the turnover frequency of catalyst active sites because they could be efficiently devoted to the next catalytic cycle [50], [51].

Fig. 11. C3H6-TPD-MS profiles of the zeolites and supported Co catalysts.
The capability and strength of C3H6 adsorption on catalysts were directly depended on its adsorption configuration. Thereby, the in-situ DRIFT spectra of temperature-programmed C3H6 desorption were monitored to explore the interaction between C3H6 and two Co catalysts in the temperature range of 30–330 °C. As shown in Fig. 12A, several clear peaks corresponding to C3H6 adsorption were observed on Co@BEA catalyst. The peaks at 1465 and 2862 cm−1 were assigned to asymmetric deformation vibration [δas(CH3)] and its overtone [2δas(CH3)] of the methyl moiety, respectively [52], [53], [54]. The peaks at 2956 and 2931 cm−1 were the feature of νas(CH3) and νs(CH2) vibration of methyl, respectively [55]. These prominent peaks exhibited gradually decreasing intensity with the raising temperature, and they were disappeared at around 310 °C, indicating the complete desorption of C3H6 from the catalyst surfaces.

Fig. 12. In-situ DRIFT spectra of temperature-programmed C3H6 desorption from catalysts of (A) Co@BEA and (B) Co@Si-BEA.
In comparison with Co@BEA catalyst, Co@Si-BEA catalyst displayed C3H6 chemisorption peaks with both reduced intensities and shifted positions in its DRIFT spectra, as presented in Fig. 12B. Weaker peak intensity revealed a relative lower capability of C3H6 adsorption on Co@Si-BEA than on Co@BEA catalyst, which agreed with the C3H6-TPD-MS observation. The δas(CH3) vibration peak was located at 1455 cm−1 with 10 cm−1 shift relative to that for Co@BEA. In the CH vibration range of 3000–2800 cm−1, the peaks corresponding to various vibrations of methyl were observed at different positions of 2995, 2953 and 2830 cm−1, while the peak at 2872 cm−1 was attributed to ν(CH) vibration of methyl or methene [52], [55]. Such peak shifts suggested that the C3H6 species adsorbed on the surfaces of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts in distinct chemisorption configurations, causing the variation in the vibration modes of CH bonds. Not only the capability and configuration, the strength of C3H6 adsorption also became weak. On Co@Si-BEA catalyst, the δas(CH3) vibration peak at 1455 cm−1 was vanished at 180 °C, remarkably lower than 330 °C observed on Co@BEA catalyst. At above 120 °C, further increasing temperature allowed those stretching vibration peaks in 3000–2800 cm−1 were gradually shifted to the same peak positions observed on Co@BEA catalyst, and subsequently disappeared at ca. 270 °C, which was still a lower desorption temperature than Co@BEA catalyst.
Combining C3H6-TPD-MS and DRIFT results demonstrated that the C3H6 chemisorption in terms of capability, strength and configuration was determined by the structural properties of BEA zeolite-supported Co catalysts, specially the Co2+ active sites as well as the surface acid sites [56]. The previous DFT calculation reports also demonstrated that the desorption of C3H6 on isolated Co models located in either SiO2 lattices or silicate zeolites was thermodynamically favorable, whereas the CC cracking into C1-2 byproducts and the deep dehydrogenation into C3H5* species were both unfavorable in view of relatively high reaction free energies [19], [21]. By well tuning the structure of both these two kinds of sites via the dealumination treatment, desorption property of C3H6 intermediates could be significantly facilitated, and therefore the comprehensive catalytic performance (i.e., C3H6 selectivity, activity, anti-coking stability) could be promoted for Co@Si-BEA-catalyzed PDH reaction.
4. Conclusions
With BEA (Si/Al = 20) and dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite as supports, the supported Co2+ catalysts are prepared by vacuum impregnation method and attempted in nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The effects of dealumination pretreatment on the BEA zeolite support are investigated with respect to structural property of Co2+ active sites and surface acid sites as well as the catalytic PDH performance. The isolated Co2+ cations, which are anchored in the zeolite micropores through interaction with the silanol generated within dealumination process, dominate over the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst, as evidenced by a series of infrared, X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectral characterizations. The stable and unreducible Co2+ cations serve as the catalytically active sites exhibiting a high propylene selectivity of over 93 % in the PDH reaction at 590 °C. The temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) result further reveals their preference to the activation of CH bonds with suppressing the cleavage of CC bonds in propane. Co@Si-BEA catalyst also demonstrates a great long-term catalytic stability in eight-time reaction-regeneration recycling test, not only highlighting the high structural stability of the catalyst active sites but also illustrating the reversible deactivation phenomenon caused by coke deposition. As a contrast, the non-dealuminated Co@BEA catalyst is consisting of a varied Co2+ coordination environment and a higher density of surface Brønsted acid sites (BAS), and displays severe issues in terms of propane CC bond scission and coke formation due to the catalytically competitive advantage of BAS on these side-reactions over the Co2+-catalyzed selective PDH process. Based on the combined propylene desorption measurement profiles, propylene chemisorbed on Co@Si-BEA catalyst in favorable configuration mode leads to a superior property in terms of less adsorption amount and weak strength in comparison with that on Co@BEA catalyst, and therefore this is responsible for a high propylene selectivity, stability, and activity in PDH reaction.
