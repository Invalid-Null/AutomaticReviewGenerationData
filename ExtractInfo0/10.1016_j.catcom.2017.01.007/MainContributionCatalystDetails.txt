The provided extracts do not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The documents focus on the conversion of ethylene to propylene using various nickel catalysts supported on silica-alumina. There is no mention of PDH, ODH, or the conversion of propane to propylene. Since the extracts do not discuss PDH or ODH processes, catalysts, or results, I have indicated that they are not relevant by specifying "No" under <Relevance>. The rest of the XML structure is left empty since no pertinent details can be extracted from the given text.
