The given document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). It focuses on the direct conversion of ethylene to propene using nickel catalysts supported on silica-alumina. While propylene is produced, this is done by conversion of ethylene, not by dehydrogenation of propane. Therefore, this document is not relevant to PDH or ODH catalyst advancements.
