The given document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). It focuses on the direct conversion of ethylene to propene using Ni-based catalysts. While propylene (propene) is produced, this is done through the conversion of ethylene, not propane. There is no mention of PDH or ODH processes or propane as a feedstock.
