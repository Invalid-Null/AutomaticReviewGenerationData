Highlights

Abstract
Optimizing the structure of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts is of utmost importance toward improving the propane dehydrogenation performance. It is challenging to precisely synthesize uniform PtFe alloy nanoparticles without excess unalloyed Fe species on the support as these Fe species lead to low propylene selectivity, coke deposition, and poor stability. Herein, we report an effective strategy to optimize the structure of PtFe bimetallic catalysts with minimal coke and high turnover frequency (8.2 s−1). For the optimized catalyst, 1Pt3Fe@S-1, most Fe species is in the framework of the zeolite S-1, which significantly suppresses the formation of coke. In addition, the extra-framework Fe and Pt species encapsulated in the channel of zeolite form uniform PtFe alloy nanoparticles, which significantly improves the C3H6 selectivity, catalytic stability, and recycling performance. These findings provide insights into the structure-performance relationship of PtFe bimetallic catalysts and shall be beneficial to future design and optimization of similar catalytic materials.

1. Introduction
Pt-based catalysts have been widely used in the industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process because of their low toxicity, superior activation of C–H bonds, and suppression of C–C bond cleavage (Atanga et al., 2018, Carter et al., 2021, Chen et al., 2021a, Chen et al., 2020, Dai et al., 2021a, Liu et al., 2021, Sattler et al., 2014b, Wang et al., 2023, Yang et al., 2018). The introduction of promoters into Pt-based catalysts is an effective strategy to combat the formation of coke and significantly improves the stability and C3H6 selectivity. Various 3d-transition metals and main group metals, such as V (Purdy et al., 2020), Cr (LiBretto et al., 2019), Mn (Fan et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2022, Rochlitz et al., 2022, Wu et al., 2018), Fe (Bian et al., 2022, Wegener et al., 2020), Co (Cesar et al., 2019), Cu (Han et al., 2014, Li et al., 2018, Sun et al., 2018), Zn (Chen et al., 2021b, Cybulskis et al., 2017, Rochlitz et al., 2019, Sun et al., 2020), Ga (Nakaya et al., 2021, Searles et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2022b, Zhang et al., 2021), Sn (Chen et al., 2021c, Liu et al., 2019a, Liu et al., 2019b, Lobera et al., 2010, Shi et al., 2015, Xiong et al., 2017, Yang et al., 2012, Zhang et al., 2019), In (Escorcia et al., 2020, Sripinun et al., 2021), Sb (Ye et al., 2018), Bi (Zhu Chen et al., 2019), etc., have been studied as promoters. Catalytic structures of intermetallic compound (IMC), single atom alloy (SAA) and core–shell bimetallic alloy have been successfully synthesized. The addition of promoters separates the multi-Pt ensembles, which inhibits the structure-sensitive side reactions, including hydrogenolysis and carbon deposition (Chen et al., 2021c, Xiong et al., 2017, Zhang et al., 2019). From the aspect of electronic effect, alloying modulates the orbital energy of Pt, which changes the heats of adsorption/desorption for propylene and/or intermediate species on the active sites and suppresses the deep dehydrogenation to form coke (Cybulskis et al., 2017, Sun et al., 2020, Ye et al., 2018).
When group VIII (Fe, Co, and Ni) promoters are used in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, an excessive amount of the promoter is usually added (Dai et al., 2021b, Estes et al., 2016, Hu et al., 2015, Hu et al., 2022, Yang et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2018a). For instance, Wegener et al. compared the catalytic performance of PtFe IMCs in PDH reaction, where the PtFe alloy with an Fe-rich structure showed a higher C3H6 formation rate (Wegener et al., 2020). However, the excessive amount of Fe species forms unalloyed metallic Fe nanoparticles during reduction and PDH reaction, which promotes the hydrogenolysis and carbon deposition reactions (Bian et al., 2022, Pérez-Ramírez et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2019, Yang et al., 2020). Precisely synthesizing well-defined and uniform alloy sites while eliminating the excessive unalloyed promoters have been challenging for the development of Pt-based PDH catalysts with group VIII promoters, and numerous efforts have been made to address this. Cai et. al. prepared a core–shell structure of Pt@PtM alloy by acid treatment of PtM (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) bimetallic catalysts (Cai et al., 2018). The Fe, Co and Ni on the surface of the catalysts are removed during the acid treatment, which suppresses the side reactions such as coking and cracking. These results have shown the potential impact of fine-tuning the surface structure on improving the catalytic performance and inhibiting the formation of coke. In addition, we previously reported another strategy to optimize the PtFe bimetallic structure by introducing the soft oxidant of CO2 to PDH process (Bian et al., 2022). The coking active sites of unalloyed metallic Fe species are selectively oxidized to Fe3O4 under reaction conditions, which significantly inhibits the carbon deposition. Meanwhile, the preserved PtFe alloy shows a high C3H6 selectivity. One drawback of this strategy is that propane and CO2 may competitively adsorb on the catalytic surface, which leads to a decreased C3H6 formation rate. Therefore, it is desirable to develop other strategies to further optimize the structure of PtFe bimetallic catalysts to achieve better PDH catalytic performance without using CO2.
Herein, we report another effective tactic to optimize the structure of PtFe bimetallic catalysts by tuning the state of Fe species, which significantly improves the PDH performance. Based on the previous understanding of PtFe bimetallic catalyst for the PDH reaction, the formation of coke can be significantly inhibited by transforming the excess unalloyed metallic Fe species into FeOx species (Yang et al., 2020). In addition, Liu found that the Fe species can get integrated into the framework of the zeolite during synthesis and in turn anchor the noble metal species to form isolated Pt sites (Liu et al., 2023), providing opportunities to prepare high performance PDH catalyst with ultra-small Pt cluster. In this manuscript, we focus on the structural optimization of PtFe bimetallic alloy. Three PtFe bimetallic catalysts with different structures were synthesized, among which the presence of both framework and extra-framework Fe species leads to the significantly inhibited coke deposition and long-term stability.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalyst Synthesis
Pt/S-1 and 1Pt7Fe/S-1: The Silicalite-1 support (S-1) was synthesized via the hydrothermal crystallization method at 170 ℃ for 3 days with a molar ratio of 1 tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS): 0.27 tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH): 35 H2O in the precursor (Dai et al., 2015). After washing and centrifugation, the product was dried at 100 ℃ and calcined at 540 ℃ for 6 h in air to remove the template, denoted as S-1. 1.0 wt% of Fe and/or 0.5 wt% of Pt were sequentially introduced onto the S-1 support via the charge enhanced dry impregnation (CEDI) method (Yang et al., 2019). For example, 1.0 wt% of Fe was loaded onto S-1, and after drying and calcination at 400 ℃ for 4 h, the product was obtained and denoted as Fe/S-1. 0.5 wt% of Pt was then impregnated onto the S-1 or Fe/S-1 samples, and after drying and calcination at 250 ℃ for 4 h, these samples were obtained and denoted as Pt/S-1 and 1Pt7Fe/S-1 (the molar ratio of Pt/Fe is 1:7), respectively.
1Pt@7FeS-1: The FeS-1 (1.0 wt% of Fe) and 1Pt@7FeS-1(1.0 wt% of Fe, 0.5 wt% of Pt) catalysts were synthesized in-situ via the hydrothermal crystallization method, and the detailed procedures are as follows. 16.5 g of TEOS, 17.5 g of 25 wt% TPAOH solution and 31.0 mL of H2O were mixed and stirred for 3 h. 1.05 g of H2PtCl6 solution (0.06 wt%) mixed with 0.18 g of ethylenediamine was added dropwise into the solution and stirred for 1 h. Then 0.29 g of EDTA-2Na and 0.34 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were both completely dissolved in 3 mL of H2O, and added dropwise into the mixture solution and stirred for 1 h. The final solution was crystallized at 170 ℃ for 3 days. After centrifugation, washing and drying overnight at 100 ℃, these products were denoted as FeS-1 and 1Pt@7FeS-1 (the molar ratio of Pt/Fe is 1:7), respectively.
Pt@S-1 and xPtyFe@S-1: The synthesis processes of Pt@S-1 (0.5 wt% of Pt) and xPtyFe@S-1 are similar. In a typical synthesis process (1.0 wt% of Fe, 0.5 wt% of Pt), the solution containing ethylenediamine and H2PtCl6 was added dropwise into the Si-containing solution and stirred for 1 h. Then 0.18 g of ethylenediamine was added into 3 mL of the solution with 0.34 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, and was quickly added dropwise into the Si-containing solution and stirred for 1 h. The final solution was transferred into a steel autoclave and crystallized at 170 ℃ for 3 days. After centrifugation, washing and drying overnight at 100 ℃, these products were denoted as Pt@S-1 and xPtyFe@S-1 (the x/y represents the molar ratio of Pt/Fe, such as 3Pt1Fe, 1Pt1Fe, 1Pt3Fe and 1Pt7Fe), respectively.
2.2. Catalytic testing
The catalytic reactions were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor. 0.15 g of catalyst powder was placed in the isothermal zone of a quartz tube reactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm. Each catalyst was first reduced with pure H2 (30 mL/min) at 550 ℃ for 1 h and purged with pure N2 (30 mL/min) for 15 min. The reactant gas (C3H8/N2 = 1:7) was then continuously fed into the reactor, and the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was maintained at 16000 mL·h−1·gcat−1. The PDH reaction was performed at 550 ℃ and ambient pressure. During the successive oxidation–reduction PDH test, each cycle includes a step of PDH for 5 h, followed by a treatment in air (30 mL/min) at 550 ℃ for 0.85 h to remove the deposited coke and then reduction via pure H2 (30 mL/min) at 550 ℃ for 0.5 h. The products were analyzed by using an online gas chromatography integrated with double detectors: a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) for N2 and CH4, and a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) for hydrocarbons, including CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H8, C3H6, C4H10, C4H8 and C4H6. The conversion of C3H8 (XC3H8), selectivity of hydrocarbon product i (Si) and carbon balance (BC3H8) were calculated according to Eqs. (1), (2), (3). The turnover frequency (TOFC3H6) and deactivation constant (Kd) of 1Pt3Fe@S-1 were calculated via Eqs. (4), (5) respectively.

2.3. Characterization
A Rigaku Smartlab 9 kW X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation was used to characterize the crystalline structure for the reduced samples (treated in pure H2 at 550 °C for 1 h). The pore structure was determined by Ar adsorption–desorption on a Quantachrome AUTOSORB-1-MP sorption analyzer at −186 °C. Prior to the measurements, the reduced samples were degassed at 300 °C for 6 h. The specific surface area and micropore volume were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) and Saito-Foley (SF) model, respectively, and the total pore volume was estimated at P/P0 = 0.99. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), high angle annular dark field-scanning TEM (HADDF-STEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) images were obtained on an FEI Tecnai F30 instrument, and the samples were prepared using ethanol suspension of reduced samples dispersed on copper grids. UV-Raman measurements were carried out using a 266 nm excitation source to characterize the framework Fe species. UV–Vis spectra were collected on a Jasco UV-550 spectrometer to investigate the Fe species in PtFe bimetallic catalysts and the hydrogenation product of 3-Nitrotoluene with NaBH4. The content of Pt, extra-framework Fe and framework Fe species were determined respectively by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) on a PerkinElmer AVIO 500 instrument. The Fe species dissolved by dilute HNO3 (10 vol%) were considered as the extra-framework Fe species and its amount was determined using ICP analysis. After removing the extra-framework Fe species, HF and aqua regia were both added to dissolve the framework Fe and Pt species for ICP analysis. The 57Fe Mössbauer spectra of reduced samples were measured on a Topologic 500A spectrometer and a proportional counter at room temperature. 57Co (Rh) moving in a constant acceleration mode was used as a radioactive source. The in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were conducted on the bending magnet beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MR-CAT) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory at the Pt LIII Edge (11,564.0 eV) and the Fe K edge (7,112.0 eV). All the samples were pre-treated at 550 °C with 5% H2 in He, and the spectra were collected at room temperature in He post-reduction without exposure to air. The in-situ CO diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (CO-Drifts) were collected on a Thermo Nicolet iS50 spectrometer with a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector cooled by liquid nitrogen. Prior to the test, the sample was reduced at 550 °C and ambient pressure under pure H2 for 1 h. After that the reduced sample was exposed to 10 vol% of CO/N2 at 30 °C for 30 min, and the spectra were collected after purging with N2 for 30 min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed over a spectrometer (Model Max 200, Leybold, Germany) using Al Kα radiation as an excitation source. Vis-Raman spectroscopy was performed to investigate the coke formation for the spent samples on a DL-2 microscopic Raman spectrometer with a 532 nm Ar-ion laser beam. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was obtained on an SDT Q600 apparatus to measure the carbon deposition of the spent catalysts, scanning from 30 to 800 ℃ with a heating rate of 10 ℃/min in air. H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), and volumetric CO chemisorption experiments were carried out on a Quantachrome ChemBET Pulsar analyzer. Before the test, about 0.1 g of the sample was pretreated in He at 400 °C for 1 h and then cooled to 30 °C. For the H2-TPR test, the 1Pt7Fe/S-1 and reduced 1Pt7Fe@S-1 as well as 1Pt@7FeS-1 were tested from 30 to 900 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min in 5 vol% H2/Ar. For the NH3-TPD test, the reduced catalysts were pre-adsorbed with 8 vol% NH3/He for 30 min at 120 °C and purged by pure He before conducting TPD from 120 to 650 ℃ at 10 ℃/min. For the volumetric CO chemisorption, 0.15 g of reduced 1Pt3Fe@S-1 (msam) was tested at room temperature, and the dispersion of Pt species (DPt) was calculated by the adsorbed volume of CO (VCO = 23 μL) in Eq. (6).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure design and characterization
To optimize the structure of the Fe species, three synthetic methods were proposed. In the previous work (Bian et al., 2022), the catalyst with low Pt/Fe ratio (Pt/Fe = 1:7) showed the highest stability and propylene yield than the other PtFe bimetallic catalysts in the steady state, since it has sufficient Fe atoms around the Pt species, which makes it easier to form the PtFe alloy highly active for PDH. Thus 1Pt7Fe/S-1 was synthesized using a similar method, where PtFe alloy and Fe(0) nanoparticles are both expected. In the presence of EDTA with strong complexing ability, the coordinated Fe species tends to integrate into the framework of the zeolite during the synthesis (Yang et al., 2020), and thus Pt and framework FeOx are expected in 1Pt@7FeS-1. It is noteworthy that high PDH activity and selectivity require PtFe alloy nanoparticles, instead of Pt(0) nanoparticles, so we next synthesized 1Pt7Fe@S-1, where ethylenediamine was used during the synthesis, aiming to obtain both framework Fe and extra-framework Fe, the latter of which is expected to be uniformly dispersed and alloyed with Pt during the reduction step (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1. Structural conjecture of three PtFe bimetallic catalysts with different Fe distribution and states after reduction.
To verify our hypotheses and investigate the states of Fe species, a series of characterizations to determine Fe speciation were carried out. As shown in the Fig. 1A and 1B, minimal framework Fe species (520, 1020, 1120 and 1172 cm−1) was observed in the UV-Raman spectrum of 1Pt7Fe/S-1, while it is present in 1Pt@7FeS-1 and 1Pt7Fe@S-1 (Dai et al., 2016, Fan et al., 2009). After H2 reduction, the framework iron species remains. Besides, a wide band from 300 to 700 nm in the UV–Vis spectra was observed on 1Pt7Fe/S-1, as shown in Fig. 1C, which could be attributed to extra-framework Fe species, such as Fe2O3 nanoparticles (Lari et al., 2015, Luo et al., 2016). There is no absorption peak in this range for 1Pt@7FeS-1. A sharp peak appears below 300 nm, which typically corresponds to the vibration of tetrahedrally coordinated framework Fe species (Yang et al., 2020). For 1Pt7Fe@S-1, both framework and extra-framework Fe species were observed. After H2 reduction, the signal of extra-framework Fe species in 1Pt7Fe/S-1 and 1Pt7Fe@S-1 decreased, as shown in Fig. 1D. However, the framework Fe species of 1Pt@7FeS-1 and 1Pt7Fe@S-1 remained, without observable reduction peaks in H2-TPR (Fig. S1A), which is in accordance with the UV-Raman results. In addition, the ICP results show similar Pt content among the three PtFe bimetallic catalysts, but the content of Fe species is significantly different. 0.95 wt% of Fe species was determined using the dilute HNO3 treatment in Table 1, indicating that most of the Fe species on 1Pt7Fe/S-1 are extra-framework. No extra-framework Fe species was detected with the dilute HNO3 treatment on 1Pt@7FeS-1, while 0.96 wt% of Fe species was determined using the HF and aqua regia pickling, indicating that the majority of the Fe species is in the zeolite framework. 0.05 wt% of extra-framework Fe and 0.88 wt% of framework Fe were determined for 1Pt7Fe@S-1, which consists with the mixed states of Fe species in UV–Vis.

The Mössbauer spectra are shown in Fig. 2, and the fitting results are displayed in Table S1. The reduced 1Pt7Fe/S-1 contains super-paramagnetic Fe3+, Fe2+ and large amounts of metallic Fe0 species (39.2%) in Fig. 2A (Bian et al., 2022, Fierro et al., 2011, Zhu et al., 2022). Metallic Fe0 species are absent in 1Pt@7FeS-1, while the super-paramagnetic Fe3+ species is observed, as shown in Fig. 2B, which implies that most of the Fe species remains stable in the framework of zeolite after H2 reduction (Luo et al., 2016). For the reduced 1Pt7Fe@S-1, a majority of FeOx and small amount of metallic Fe species (3.3%) were both detected (Fig. 2C), which agrees with the UV–Vis and ICP results. These results demonstrate that the states of Fe species among three reduced PtFe bimetallic catalysts are significantly different via tuning the synthesis methods.

To investigate the electronic structure and coordination environment of the Pt and Fe species, the PtFe bimetallic catalysts were analyzed using in-situ XAS and CO-Drifts in Fig. 3. The in-situ Fe K edge XANES (Fig. 3A) spectrum of the reduced 1Pt7Fe/S-1 lies between metallic Fe foil and Fe2O3, indicating the presence of both Fe0 and oxidized Fe species (Bian et al., 2022, He et al., 2023). The reduced 1Pt@7FeS-1 shows a pre-edge feature of Fe3+ species and a higher edge energy than metallic Fe0 species, which conforms with the results of framework Fe species in UV-Raman and UV–Vis. For 1Pt7Fe@S-1, there is a similar pre-edge feature characteristic of Fe3+ species, but a lower edge energy was observed, indicating the presence of both framework Fe and metallic Fe0 species, consistent with the Mössbauer and ICP results. In Fig. 3B, the Pt LIII edge XANES spectrum of three PtFe bimetallic catalysts are similar to that of the Pt foil, indicating that the Pt species are in the metallic form (Pt0 in the PtFe alloy) (Wegener et al., 2020). Although the Fe K edge EXAFS spectra are of low quality and do not allow detailed analysis, while the Pt LIII edge EXAFS spectra (Fig. 3C and Table 2) provided structural information. The wavelet analysis of the Pt LIII edge EXAFS is shown in Fig. S3. For the Pt foil, the Pt scattering features are centered at R ≈ 2.7 Å and k ≈ 9.5 Å−1, whereas for 1Pt7Fe/S-1 the main scattering paths produce features centered at R ≈ 2.2 Å and k ≈ 6.6 Å−1. The rise of the contribution at lower k and R indicates the presence of lighter (than Pt) scatterers, and in this case, Fe, within bonding distance surrounding Pt. The scattering features of 1Pt@7FeS-1 and 1Pt7Fe@S-1 are centered at R ≈ 2.4 Å and k ≈ 6.9 Å−1, again indicating the presence of Fe scatterers within bonding distance. 1Pt@7FeS-1 has the smallest number of Pt-Fe bonds (2.59 Å with a CN of 0.9 ± 0.7), since most of the Fe species are in the framework of the zeolite. In the in-situ CO-Drifts, the Pt/S-1 shows one peak located at 2080 cm−1 (Fig. 3D), which is usually attributed to the linear-adsorbed CO on terrace Pt sites (Sun et al., 2020). This peak shifts to a lower wavenumber at 2076 cm−1 after the introduction of Fe, which indicates the formation of PtFe alloy after H2 reduction (Bian et al., 2022). The linear CO adsorption peak of 1Pt@7FeS-1 splits into two peaks located at 2062 and 2080 cm−1, and the latter indicates the existence of unalloyed Pt. For 1Pt7Fe@S-1, the peak located at 2080 cm−1 disappeared and only one peak at 2064 cm−1 was observed, indicating a fully alloyed surface structure (Soares et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2016). These results demonstrate that the structures of Pt species among three PtFe bimetallic catalysts are influenced by tuning the states of Fe species.

The distribution of metallic species among three PtFe bimetallic catalysts was also investigated. As shown in the XRD results in Fig. S4A, only the diffraction peaks of the typical MFI topology were observed for all three catalysts, without any observable diffraction peaks from metal species, indicating that the metal species are all well dispersed. Fig. 4 and S5 provide the HR-TEM, HADDF-STEM and EDS mapping images for three PtFe bimetallic catalysts after reduction, respectively. Uniform zeolite crystal size with a diameter of about 200 nm was observed for all samples, which agrees with the typical MFI topology diffraction peaks in Fig. S4A (Han et al., 2022, Yang et al., 2017). Large amounts of metal nanoparticles with an average size of 3.3 nm are on the surface of the zeolite crystals in the reduced 1Pt7Fe/S-1, as shown in Fig. 4 and S5, and a lattice spacing of 2.23 Å was observed, suggesting the presence of the Pt3Fe1 alloy phase after H2 reduction (PDF#89–2050). On the contrary, large amounts of highly-dispersed metal nanoparticles with an average size of 1.5 nm are encapsulated inside the zeolite crystals in the reduced 1Pt@7FeS-1 and 1Pt7Fe@S-1, which is well supported by the near zero activity for the hydrogenation of 3-Nitrotoluene with NaBH4, as shown in Fig. S6 (Huang et al., 2023, Sun et al., 2019).

3.2. Catalytic performance
Fig. 5 shows the catalytic performance of the monometallic Pt and the three PtFe bimetallic catalysts with different Fe states, and the TGA results of each spent catalyst are displayed in Fig. 5D. Due to the monometallic FeS-1 (framework Fe species) and Fe/S-1 (extra-framework Fe species) show less than 1% of C3H8 conversion, as shown in Fig. S7, thus their contributions in PDH are negligible. The monometallic Pt/S-1 shows a poor PDH activity and stability. The initial C3H8 conversion was 37% and rapidly decreased to 2% in 280 min. Although the Pt@S-1 has higher initial C3H8 conversion (49%), a comparable deactivation trend with Pt/S-1 and lower initial C3H6 selectivity of 82% were observed. Both of the monometallic Pt catalysts produced about 2.0 wt% of coke after 280 min on stream. The initial activity and stability increase dramatically after introducing 1.0 wt% of Fe species. The C3H8 conversion of 1Pt7Fe/S-1 increased to 58% and stabilized at 53% after 280 min. The initial C3H6 selectivity was 73%, and increased above 92% within 60 min. The carbon balance was 81% at the initial stage, and increased to 92% with progress of the reaction. The TGA result shows that the 1Pt7Fe/S-1 produces about 15.4 wt% of coke after 280 min on stream. In addition, the TEM images (Fig. S8) and the more intense carbon signal located at 1335 and 1602 cm−1 in Vis-Raman spectra (Fig. S9) also confirm the presence of more amorphous coke on the surface of spent 1Pt7Fe/S-1 (Sattler et al., 2014a). In contrast, 1Pt@7FeS-1 only produced 1.1 wt% of coke, the stability is noticeably worse compared to the 1Pt7Fe/S-1 catalyst. The initial C3H8 conversion was 50% and decreased to 20% after 280 min. The initial C3H6 selectivity and carbon balance reached 85% and 91%, respectively. It should be noted that the 1Pt7Fe@S-1 achieved the best catalytic performance among three PtFe bimetallic catalysts. The initial C3H8 conversion reaches 60% and stabilizes at 55% in 280 min. The carbon balance and initial selectivity of propylene are both above 91%, and the latter gradually increases to 98% after 280 min on stream. In addition, the TGA results and TEM images both show that the spent 1Pt7Fe@S-1 only produces about 4.0 wt% of coke, much less than 1Pt7Fe/S-1 (15.4 wt%).

To ascertain differences in catalytic performance among three PtFe bimetallic catalysts, Fe-2p and Pt-4f XPS were used to characterize three PtFe bimetallic catalysts after PDH reaction. The spent 1Pt7Fe/S-1 shows two peaks located at 707.7 and 711.8 eV after deconvolution in Fe 2p3/2 range (Fig. 6A), which are attributed to metallic Fe and Fe3+ species, respectively (Ji et al., 2020, Yuan et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2018b, Zhu et al., 2020). For the spent 1Pt@7FeS-1 and 1Pt7Fe@S-1, a majority signal of Fe3+ species at 711.8 eV was observed. Since the metallic Fe species having a stronger coking and C–C bond breaking ability than FeOx and PtFe alloy (Wang et al., 2022a, Yang et al., 2020), besides the metallic Fe species transforms into FeCx with a weaker ability on cracking during the reaction, a lower initial C3H6 selectivity and much coke are obtained on the 1Pt7Fe/S-1, which well conforms with the TGA and Mössbauer results. While the Fe species in spent 1Pt@7FeS-1 and 1Pt7Fe@S-1 mainly exist as Fe3+ in the framework and remains stable, which effectively eliminates the excess unalloyed metallic Fe0 species and greatly inhibits the formation of carbon deposition. In addition, the formation of PtFe alloy in 1Pt7Fe/S-1 and 1Pt7Fe@S-1 show high stability in steady state, which indicates that the well-defined PtFe alloy is the major active phase for PDH reaction. While the Fe species in 1Pt@7FeS-1 tends to integrate into the framework of zeolite, rather than stays extra-framework, the insufficient PtFe alloy finally leads to the poor stability and C3H6 selectivity, which is supported by the in-situ XAS and CO-Drifts. Because the excess Fe species are incorporated into the zeolite framework, the remaining extra-framework Fe and Pt species form well-defined and uniform PtFe alloy nanoparticles. Thus, the 1Pt7Fe@S-1 achieves excellent PDH catalytic performance and greatly inhibits the formation of coke among three PtFe bimetallic catalysts with different Fe states.

The regeneration stability of 1Pt7Fe/S-1 and 1Pt7Fe@S-1 was investigated by successive oxidation–reduction PDH cycles, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. The initial C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity of fresh 1Pt7Fe/S-1 reach 62% and 73%, respectively. Across multiple regeneration cycles, the initial propane conversion and stability of 1Pt7Fe/S-1 gradually decrease and show an irreversible deactivation during each regeneration. The initial C3H8 conversion dramatically decreases to 18% in the fourth cycle. In contrast, the initial activity and C3H6 selectivity of fresh 1Pt7Fe@S-1 are 62% and 91%, respectively. After four cycles, the initial C3H8 conversion of 1Pt7Fe@S-1 remains high at 56%, and the C3H6 selectivity stabilizes above 97%, similar to the fresh catalyst. Combined with the TEM results (Fig. 4) and absent signal of Pt 4f-XPS (Fig. 6B), the well-defined PtFe alloy in 1Pt7Fe@S-1 are encapsulated at the interior of the zeolite, which significantly improves the anti-sintering ability of metal particles, thus showing the excellent recycling stability during the successive oxidation–reduction PDH test (Sun et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020).

Reaction conditions: T = 550 ℃, ambient pressure, 0.15 g of the catalyst, C3H8/N2 = 5/35 mL/min, GHSV = 16000 mL·h−1·gcat-1. Each cycle includes a step of PDH for 5 h, followed by a treatment in air (30 mL/min) at 550 ℃ for 0.85 h to remove the deposited coke and then reduced via pure H2 (30 mL/min) at 550 ℃ for 0.5 h.
3.3. Structure and performance optimization
To further optimize the structure and its PDH catalytic performance, a series of PtFe@S-1 bimetallic catalysts with similar nanoparticle sizes (Fig. S10) but different Pt/Fe molar ratios were prepared and tested in Fig. 8, and the relevant results of UV–Vis spectra and in-situ CO-Drifts are shown in Fig. 9. The initial C3H8 conversion of 3Pt1Fe@S-1 is 46 % and decreases to 5% within 280 min, which shows a similar deactivation trend to the Pt@S-1. The initial C3H6 selectivity and carbon balance reach 91% and 94%, respectively. The TGA result shows that it produces 1.1 wt% of coke after reaction. As observed in the UV–Vis spectra, the Fe species mainly integrates into the framework of zeolite with a low Fe content in Fig. 9A. Meanwhile, a signal of CO linearly adsorbed on Pt (2080 cm−1) is observed on 3Pt1Fe@S-1 in Fig. 9B, which indicates that the incomplete PtFe alloying on the surface leads to a poor stability and low initial activity. While the activity and stability significantly increase with increased Fe content. The C3H8 conversion of 1Pt1Fe@S-1 reaches 53% and decreases to 35% in 280 min. The carbon balance reaches 94% and gradually increases to 96%. In addition, it shows a similar C3H6 selectivity and coke amount (1.1 wt%) with 3Pt1Fe@S-1. When the Pt/Fe ratio decreases to 1:3, more extra-framework Fe species appears in Fig. 9A. At the same time, the signal of CO linearly adsorbed on Pt (2080 cm−1) disappears in Fig. 9B, indicating the formation of PtFe alloy in 1Pt3Fe@S-1, which is related with the significantly enhanced catalytic performance in Fig. 8. The C3H8 conversion further increases to 59% and stabilizes at 54% after 280 min. The initial C3H6 selectivity reaches 90% and gradually improves to 99%. The carbon balance is above 93%, and 1.0 wt% of coke is produced after 280 min on stream. Further increasing the nominal Fe content, the catalytic performance of 1Pt7Fe@S-1 is similar with that of 1Pt3Fe@S-1. However, due to the presence of less unalloyed Fe species (3.3%, from the results of Mössbauer spectrum), its carbon deposition slightly increases to 4.0 wt%.

The long-term stability test for PDH reaction over 1Pt3Fe@S-1 was investigated in Fig. 10. After 50 h on stream, the propane conversion remains at 42% with a low deactivation constant of 0.010 h−1. The propylene selectivity maintains above 99% and forms 2.8 wt% of coke in TGA results. In addition, the 1Pt3Fe@S-1 shows a high TOF of C3H6 in Fig. S11, reaching 8.2 s−1. Therefore, the optimized catalytic structure is achieved with 1Pt3Fe@S-1, which displays the best catalytic performance and less coke among various nominal Pt/Fe ratio samples.

4. Conclusion
In this manuscript, we offer an effective strategy to obtain optimized catalytic structure and PDH catalytic performance by integrating excess unalloyed metallic Fe into the FeOx species in the zeolite framework meanwhile obtaining well-defined and uniform PtFe alloy nanoparticles. Excessive unalloyed Fe0 species produces much coke in PDH reaction. When the Fe species completely integrates into the framework of the zeolite, it produces less carbon, but the incomplete PtFe alloying on the surface leads to a poor propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation. Due to the unique structure of 1Pt3Fe@S-1, most of the Fe species integrates into the framework of zeolite, which effectively eliminates the excess unalloyed metallic Fe0 species and greatly inhibits the formation of carbon deposition. Meanwhile, the remainder of extra-framework Fe and Pt species encapsulated in the channel of zeolite form well-defined PtFe alloy nanoparticles, which significantly improves the C3H6 selectivity and catalytic stability. This work provides insight into the structure–activity relationship of the PDH reaction, and will advance future structural design and optimization of PtFe bimetallic catalysts.
