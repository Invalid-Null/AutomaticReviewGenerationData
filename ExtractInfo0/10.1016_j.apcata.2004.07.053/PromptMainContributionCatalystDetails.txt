Pt0.02Sn0.003Mg0.06 on γ-alumina: a stable catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane
Abstract
The advantages of two-step oxidative dehydrogenation as an alternative method for manufacturing small alkenes are outlined. In a nutshell, the process is based on separating the gaseous oxygen and hydrocarbon feeds in time. In the first step, alkanes are dehydrogenated in the presence of a solid oxygen carrier (without gaseous oxygen). Subsequently, the carrier is reoxidised using a gaseous feed. This process requires a dehydrogenation catalyst that is selective and stable under severe redox cycling. In search for such a catalyst, we prepare and study various platinum/tin catalysts supported on alumina. The catalysts are doped with either magnesia or potassium oxide. The activity, selectivity, and stability of these catalysts in the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene are then investigated under severe redox cycling conditions (600 °C and 10% (v/v) oxygen in the regeneration step). Pt0.02Sn0.003Mg0.06 is found to be the most stable combination. The catalysts’ dispersion and the metal–support interactions are studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and temperature-programmed hydrogen desorption (TPD). The effects of the (earth)alkali promoter and the interaction between the metal catalyst and support are discussed.
1. Introduction
Ethylene, propylene, and (iso)butylene are the building blocks for most of the plastics around us, with a correspondingly huge world demand. Global ethylene demand was 48 Mton in 1984 [1], 91 Mton in 2000, and is projected to exceed 160 Mton in 2012 [2]. Propylene demand in 2000 was 53.5 Mton, and is projected to reach 70 Mton in 2005. These alkenes are produced either by cracking or by catalytic dehydrogenation [3], both of which are mature technologies [4].
Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is strongly endothermic and limited by equilibrium (Scheme 1, left). In situ removal of hydrogen will shift the equilibrium to the product side. This can be carried out either physically, using membranes [5], [6], or chemically (Scheme 1, right). Single-step oxidative dehydrogenation of light paraffins is attractive because of the higher alkene yields [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], but its main problem is the hazard of mixing transition-metal catalysts, hydrocarbons, and dioxygen or air at high temperatures.1 Due to the flammability of the alkane-alkene-hydrogen-oxygen gas mixture safe operation requires dilute feeds. Another safety issue is the formation of hot spots in the reactor, caused by the exothermic over-oxidation of hydrocarbons (alkanes and alkenes) to CO and CO2 [18], [19], [20].

Scheme 1. Catalytic dehydrogenation equilibrium (left) and two-step oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (right).
An alternative is the two-step oxidative dehydrogenation, where the hydrogen by-product is removed using solid oxygen carriers (SOCs). One industrial example of such a process is the mild oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [21]. In this study, we use a conventional dehydrogenation catalyst that is mixed with a SOC in a fixed bed. The advantage of this strategy is that the hydrocarbons and the oxygen are separated in time, reducing explosion hazards (see Fig. 1). Recently, we showed that group IIIA–VIA metals [22], [23] and doped cerias [24] are suitable SOCs. In this paper, we focus on the dehydrogenation process of ethane itself, with the aim of finding a catalyst that is stable under the severe redox cycling conditions required for the SOC regeneration.

In conventional catalytic dehydrogenation two transition metals are used: chromium (oxide) or platinum. Due to its volatile nature, chromium oxide [25] is unsuitable for our process. Therefore, we focussed on Pt-based catalysts. These catalysts are known to deactivate rapidly due to coke deposition [26], [27] and must be regenerated by controlled coke burn off [28], [29]. The selectivity of these catalysts can be improved by adding alkali metals, or tin [28], [30], [31], [32]. Addition of tin also lowers the adsorption energy of the coke precursors on the Pt surface, thereby rendering these catalysts more stable. Presently, we investigate the influence of severe redox cycling on the performance of Pt–Sn catalysts [28], [33]. Only a stable dehydrogenation catalyst can make the two-step oxidative dehydrogenation reaction feasible.
2. Experimental
2.1. General remarks
GC analysis was performed at 50 °C on a Carlo Erba 4300 instrument modified with a 16-way valve to enable fast sampling and a 3 m Alltech Unibead 1S column, using 1 ml min−1 N2 (99.5%, Hoekloos) as internal standard. All gas streams were dried using a Perma Pure MD-050-72S membrane prior to analysis. MS analysis was performed using a Pfeiffer QMA 200 instrument (m/z range 0–100). BET surface areas and pore volumes were determined by nitrogen physisorption using a Sorptomatic 1990 (CE Instruments). Elemental composition was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using a multi-channel Thermo Jarrel Ash ICAP 957 spectrometer, upgraded to model ICAP 61. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Philips CM30T electron microscope with a LaB6 filament as the source of electrons, operated at 300 kV. C2H4 (99.7% pure), He (99.996%), O2 (99.5%, dried over molecular sieves before use), and H2 (99.999%, purified by a BTS column and dried over molecular sieves before use) were purchased from Praxair. C2H6 (99.3%) was purchased from Ucar. Ar and Ar/H2 (67% H2, 33% Ar) for TPD experiments were purchased from Praxair (99.999%). Ketjen CK-300 alumina (surface area 208 m2/g, pore volume 0.68 ml/g) was ground and sieved to 106–221 μm. Mg and K supported oxides were prepared from the corresponding nitrates. Hexachloroplatinic acid (Aldrich, 99.995%) solution was prepared using double distilled water. Tetraethyltin (97%) was purchased from Aldrich.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
γ-alumina was dried overnight in an oven at 110 °C. The support was pore volume impregnated with a hexachloroplatinic acid solution. The sample was aged for 6 h at 25 °C and then dried overnight at 110 °C. This procedure was repeated four times (for a better dispersion of the metal on the support) to obtain the final 2 wt.% Pt loading. The Pt catalyst was placed in a quartz cell and calcined in 20 ml min−1 synthetic air at 5 °C min−1 upto 500 °C, dwell time 4 h. The cell was cooled to 25 °C and purged. The light orange catalyst precursor was then reduced in 20 ml min−1 Ar/H2 (67 vol.% H2), 5 °C min−1 upto 500 °C, dwell time 1 h. The cell was cooled to 25 °C and sealed with a septum. The catalyst was deposited at the top part of the cell by gentle shaking. Sn(Et)4 dissolved in dry hexane was then added using a syringe. The catalyst was contacted with the organometallic solution, and the sample was kept under a hydrogen flow (10 ml min−1) to start the hydrogenolysis. After 2 h, the cell was placed in a water bath at 50 °C for 1.5 h. The temperature was then raised to 60 °C and hereafter raised every hour by 10 °C upto 90 °C. Finally, the catalyst was reduced in a H2/Ar mixture with a 5 °C min−1 ramp upto 500 °C, dwell time 1 h.
The magnesium-containing catalyst was prepared using the above procedure with γ-alumina impregnated with magnesium nitrate (1 h calcination at 500 °C) as the support. The potassium-containing catalysts were prepared by depositing potassium nitrate solution on the catalyst via pore volume impregnation. The sample was then calcined in air at 5 °C min−1 upto 500 °C, dwell time 1 h. The Pt, Sn, Mg, and K content of all catalysts was determined by ICP-AES.
2.3. Procedure for TPD experiments
About 50 mg catalyst was mounted on loosely packed quartz wool in a quartz reactor tube (5 mm i.d.). Prior to the TPD run, the sample was reduced in a H2/Ar mixture (67 vol.% H2, 50 ml min−1) at 10 °C min−1 to 600 °C. The sample was kept at 600 °C for 1 h and then cooled under the hydrogen/argon flow to 25 °C. The sample was flushed with Ar for 45 min to remove all excessively adsorbed hydrogen. The TPD runs were performed using 20 ml min−1 Ar. The sample was heated at 5 °C min−1 to 600 °C, dwell time 1 h. Hydrogen desorption was determined using a thermal conductivity device detector.
2.4. Procedure for two-step oxidative dehydrogenation
The reactor set-up was described in detail previously [22], [23]. About 100 mg catalyst sample was exposed in a flow reactor at 600 °C to alternating oxidising (O2) and reducing (C2H6) streams. The oxidation step in (10 vol.% O2 in He) took 2 min, and the reduction step (20 vol.% C2H6 in He) 2 min. Oxidation and reduction steps were separated by a purge step (1 min). In each experiment, the catalyst was subjected to 60 redox cycles.
2.5. TEM
Samples were mounted on Quantifoil® carbon polymer supported on a copper grid by placing a few droplets of a suspension of ground sample in ethanol on the grid, followed by drying at ambient conditions. Particle diameter distributions were obtained measuring 150 metal particles on the negatives. The width of the particle size classes was 0.4 nm. EDX elemental analysis was performed using an Oxford Instruments LINK EDX system. EDX of individual metal particles was unsuccessful. All areas of the sample where these particles were visible showed some EDX elemental analysis signal for Pt and very weak signals for Sn and K.
3. Results
3.1. Catalyst synthesis
Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts can be prepared via successive impregnation [26], [34], [35], [36], sol–gel methods [37], co-impregnation [38], [39], [40], impregnation followed by reaction with an organotin compound [34], [41], [42], [43] or impregnation with bimetallic complexes [39], [44]. We synthesised Pt-Sn catalysts using controlled surface reactions (Eqs (1) and (2), where a is the amount of tin to be grafted on the Pt, and b is the number of ethyl groups that are stripped from the tetraethyltin during the grafting process) to anchor the tin to the platinum. With this method, the tin was primarily deposited on the platinum particles instead of randomly on the Pt and the support. We prepared five different catalysts on γ-alumina: Pt2% (A), Pt2%Sn0.6% (A–Sn), Pt2%Sn0.3%K1% (B), Pt2%Sn0.6%K1% (C), and Pt2%Sn0.3%Mg6% (D). Table 1 gives the exact elemental composition and the surface parameters for A–D. The A-type materials were used as references, to study the effects of the redox cycling on undoped Pt particles and examine the differences in hydrogen adsorption on fresh Pt–Sn catalysts.

3.2. Redox cycling
We tested catalysts B, C and D under rapid reaction cycling. The thermodynamic maximum ethane conversion (i.e. when only dehydrogenation occurs, no hydrogenolysis or coke formation) was 38%. Fig. 2 shows the selectivity/conversion curves obtained with catalyst B. At the start of the dehydrogenation step the conversion was high, but the selectivity was poor. With increasing time-on-stream the conversion dropped, but selectivity increased. The amounts of CO2 formed were negligible (<0.1 vol.%). Minor amounts (<0.5% (v/v)) of CO and CH4 were detected, but only in the first minute of the reaction. The main by-product was coke. Coking of the catalyst is known to decrease with increasing metal areas covered with coke precursor and the covering of the most acidic sites of the catalyst [30]. We observed a rise in selectivity and drop in conversion of the dehydrogenation of ethane with time. Regeneration of the catalyst in the oxidation step shifted the curve to lower conversions and higher selectivities (conversions of 38 and 12% at the beginning of cycle 5 and 25, respectively). The results for catalyst C (Fig. 3) were similar to those for B. The higher concentration of tin in C did not change the catalyst's performance.

Catalyst D was different. It remained stable even after ten reaction/regeneration cycles (Fig. 4). The conversion per cycle remained unchanged—D outperformed the activity of the K-promoted catalysts. Its selectivity, however, was lower than that of B and C. This indicates different metal–support interactions for the potassium-doped and the magnesium-doped carriers.

3.3. Transmission electron microscopy
The decrease in conversion for the catalysts B and C hinted at sintering of the platinum catalyst particles. To verify this we studied the platinum dispersion on fresh and spent catalysts using TEM. Fresh catalysts B and C showed very small metal particles dispersed on the support (no visible difference). The surfaces of the spent catalysts B and C clearly showed metal particles, though still fairly small (see Fig. 5, top for spent catalyst C). No visible differences between the B and C spent catalysts were observed. We could not measure EDX elemental analysis on single metal particles. All areas where these particles were visible showed, however, Pt signals and very weak signals for Sn and K. Bariås et al. observed less tin at the surface than present in the overall composition [45]. They suggested the remaining tin is probably highly dispersed. We did not observe the required amount of tin either in the fresh or the spent catalyst using EDX.

Fig. 5. TEM micrographs of spent catalyst C, (top, the dark spots are Pt particles), MgO on support (middle), and fresh catalyst D (bottom).
The fresh catalyst D contained many very small particles (<1 nm). These were too small for EDX elemental analysis on a single particle, so instead we compared the catalyst to its platinum-free MgO/γ-alumina support. Although, MgO can wet γ-alumina [46], the support we used to make D showed very small “dark spots” homogeneously spread on the alumina (Fig. 5, middle). These particles differed from the somewhat larger dark particles observed for D (Fig. 5, bottom). Therefore we assumed that the particles in the latter are Pt particles. These Pt particles sintered into larger particles when subjected to rapid redox cycling.
Fig. 6 shows the particle size distributions of the platinum-tin catalysts after 60 rapid reaction cycles. The average particle diameters for A, B, C and D were 4.3, 4.7, 4.4 and 4.5 nm, respectively, with respective standard deviations of 1.1, 1.3, 1.2 and 1.6 nm. There were no significant differences in particle size distributions between the catalysts after the rapid redox cycling.

3.4. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)
We performed hydrogen TPD measurements to study the influence of the K and Sn additives on the platinum catalyst. We performed these measurements on the γ-Al2O3 support, the platinum impregnated support, the tin modified catalyst and the potassium platinum tin catalyst. The TPD patterns (Fig. 7) show the bond strength between the physisorbed and chemisorbed hydrogen and the catalyst. Hydrogen bound on the metal surface of the catalyst prevents dissociative chemisorption of the hydrocarbons [40]. Catalysts with stronger hydrogen sorption will suffer less from carbonization of the metal surface. The support itself strongly binds hydrogen. The maximum desorption occurred at 350 °C. However, the peak is broad, indicating a variety of binding sites. Catalyst A binds slightly more hydrogen than the pure support material, but at a lower binding strength (Table 2). Two additional and larger desorption peaks appear, at 120 and 180 °C. The pattern shows the contributions of the platinum (the low temperature desorption) and the support (high temperature desorption). The total amount of hydrogen directly desorbed from the support is lowered, due to the presence of the platinum. The addition of tin has two effects: (1) a significant increase in the adsorption capacity of the catalyst and (2) a decrease in the hydrogen binding energy. Though the onset of the desorption peak starts at a slightly higher temperature, more hydrogen is desorbed at lower temperatures. Addition of potassium to the catalyst lowers the onset of the desorption peak, but the hydrogen binding capacity remains the same. The hydrogen binding capacities of our catalysts and trends herein are in fair agreement with results obtained by Casella et al. [35].

4. Discussion
A good two-step oxidative dehydrogenation catalyst must be stable and selective under rapid redox cycling. We observed differences in selectivity and conversion between K-and Mg-promoted Pt–Sn catalysts. There are several possible explanations for this different behaviour: differences in preparation, in the tin concentration of the platinum particles, in the particle size distribution, or in the metal–support interaction.
Casella et al. showed that the initial dispersion of platinum on γ-alumina was lower when a Li dopant was added before the platinum precursor [35]. This restructuring of the support did not occur for our catalysts. TEM measurements on our fresh as well as spent catalysts also did not show separate K2O particles, while EDX showed a weak K-signal over the whole sample, indicating a good dispersion. The catalysts with MgO doping exhibited tiny MgO particles. Though, MgO and alumina can show good interaction [46], here at least a part of the MgO was poorly distributed on the surface in clusters. After severe redox treatments all our catalysts exhibited similar particle size distributions, independent of the order of addition. The catalysts looked indistinguishable, except for small MgO particles on catalyst D.
The oxidation state of Sn in Pt–Sn catalysts depends on the interaction with the support. Sn can be easily reduced when it is supported on silica, but not on γ-Al2O3. Sn can interact with platinum to form an alloy, and with the alumina support to form Sn(II)aluminate. On alumina, Sn is stabilised in a positive oxidation state. Under reduction/regeneration cycles Sn2+ is oxidised to Sn4+, but some Sn0 is also formed. When Pt/Sn on MgO is subjected to reduction, the tin readily forms SnO2 and Sn0 [40]. Sn can also increase the hydrogen adsorption capacity [34]. Our TPD measurements on catalyst C showed significant differences in hydrogen adsorption and release, before and after addition of tin to the catalyst (Fig. 7).
The initial platinum dispersion on the fresh catalysts was very good, yielding only small metal particles for all catalysts. TEM measurements on the spent catalysts showed no large differences in particle size distributions between A, B, C and D (Fig. 6). Only the distribution of platinum on spent catalyst D was slightly broader than on the other spent catalysts. Reoxidation with 10 vol.% oxygen led to severe sintering of the catalyst particles on the support. The differences in catalytic behaviour are probably unrelated to variations in particle size distribution.
The interaction between the support and the metal catalyst influences the selectivity [44], [45], [47]. It is not surprising that modifying the alumina surface influences the catalytic behaviour. As all catalysts have similar platinum particle size distributions, the electronic interaction with the support will determine their activity and selectivity. A strong metal–support interaction was observed for platinum-tin deposited on MgO [40], [44], [47], [48]. This is not present on a ‘bare alumina’ support. Bednarova et al. [47] showed that for propane dehydrogenation the catalytic activity depends on the amount of Pt in the metal particles, rather than on the particle size. The interaction with the support determined the Sn distribution between Pt alloy metal particles and the support. There is a strong interaction between MgO and SnO2, where γ-Al2O3 stabilizes SnO [40]. The support influences the distribution of Pt–Sn over the metal particles and the electronic properties of these particles. Particles that are rich in Sn will exhibit low dehydrogenation activity.
To combine the benefits of MgO (basicity) and γ-alumina (high surface area), we prepared catalyst D. We used just enough MgO for monolayer coverage. As mentioned above, part of this MgO did not spread out on the surface, but rather formed small particles. However, the remaining amount was sufficient to make a difference between the Mg-doped and the K-doped alumina supports. The basic (earth)alkali metal is more than just a poison on the alumina acid sites [49].
The product selectivity at the start of the dehydrogenation step using catalyst D was similar to that obtained with B and C. The activity of D was barely affected by the redox cycles, contrary to the catalysts B and C. This is remarkable, as its particle size distribution changed similarly to the other platinum catalysts. This may reflect a better stabilization of Sn in an oxidic reduction state, limiting the amount of Sn in the alloy particles. A small amount of Sn is needed to decrease the deactivation rate, but too much will render the catalyst particles inactive. Conversion can be limited by coke poisoning of the platinum catalyst [30]. The migration rate of coke from the Pt particle to the support influences the catalytic activity. This process is less efficient in the case of the K-doped catalyst, probably due to the different metal–support interactions.
5. Conclusions
Two-step oxidative dehydrogenation presents in principle a cleaner alternative for the classic dehydrogenation of small alkanes. Due to its stability, Pt2%Sn0.3%Mg6% is a good candidate to be used to prove the process concept. Working under simulated process conditions, we see that catalyst coking is a major problem. In the case of alumina-supported catalysts, this coking can be partially prevented by eliminating acid sites. However, doping γ-alumina with group IA or IIA metals does more than just poison the acid sites on the support—it also modifies the interaction between the support and the Pt–Sn catalytic sites. A different interaction exists between the metal catalyst and the magnesia doped support on one hand, and potassium oxide doped support on the other. Because of this, the selectivity and the conversion in ethane dehydrogenation differ from what would be expected based on Pt particle size.
