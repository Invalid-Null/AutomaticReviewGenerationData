Kinetic investigations of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on boron oxide in confined spaces
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising process for on-purpose propylene production with favorable thermodynamics. Boron-based catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity in ODHP, but the understanding of catalytic mechanism remains incomplete, especially regarding the observed supra-linear reaction order of alkanes. In this work, we studied the impact of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures. The formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support. Intriguingly, the apparent activation energy increases with the ODHP activity, and exhibits a positive correlation with the apparent propane reaction order. The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane. The trend in propane reaction order and apparent activation energy on B2O3 can be rationalized by the rate expression derived based on the proposed radical chain mechanism with three distinct pathways of propane activation.
1. Introduction
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been widely commercialized to meet the increasing demand of propylene (C3H6) [1]. However, the unfavorable thermodynamics and rapid catalyst deactivation caused by carbon deposition limit the propane (C3H8) conversion in PDH. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which is free of thermodynamic limitations and carbon deposition, has been regarded as a promising technology for next-generation on-purpose C3H6 production process [2]. The main bottleneck in the development of commercial ODHP technology is the poor C3H6 selectivity of the ODHP catalysts. On conventional ODHP catalysts, such as vanadium- and chromium-based materials, the C3H6 selectivity is typically less than 70 % at C3H8 conversion higher than 10 % [2].
In 2016, Hermans and co-workers reported high alkene selectivity and mass activity of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotube in ODHP [3], though the ability of boron-based catalysts to active alkane was reported decades ago [4], [5]. A boron oxyhydroxide (B(OH)xO3−x) layer was identified on the surface of h-BN after the induction period, indicating that the active sites on h-BN and B2O3 are likely similar in nature [6]. Rather than CO or CO2, ethylene (C2H4) is the main by-product on h-BN, which is distinct from non-boron-based ODHP catalysts [3]. Aside from h-BN and boron oxide, other boron-containing materials, including borosilicate zeolites, metal borides and boron carbide, have also been reported for high alkene selectivity in ODHP [7], [8], [9]. Another interesting property of most boron-based catalysts is that the ODHP rate is approximately second-order dependence with respect to the partial pressure of C3H8 [3], [10]. The supra-linear reaction order of C3H8 is inconsistent with the conventional understanding of alkane activation based on the classic models in heterogeneous catalysis, e.g., Langmuir-Hinshelwood, Eley-Rideal and Mars-van Krevelen mechanisms, implying that surface-mediated mechanisms are unlikely to account for the ODHP activity on boron-based catalysts. Considering the high reaction temperature and the propensity of boron oxide species to form radical species [11], gas-phase radical reaction could be a key, if not dominant, component in the reaction network on the boron-mediated alkane conversion. Recent experimental and computational results lend support to the importance of gas-phase reactions in the oxidative dehydrogenation catalyzed by boron-based catalysts [10], [12], [13], [14]. Venegas et al. found that C3H8 conversion was proportional to the volume of catalyst bed, rather than the mass of h-BN, in the h-BN catalyzed ODHP [12]. Kraus et al. showed that the high alkene selectivity of h-BN was consistent with the gas-phase radical reaction network via microkinetic modeling of gas-phase C3H8-O2 reaction [13]. Our recent kinetic studies on oxidative co-dehydrogenation of ethane and propane on h-BN deconvoluted two roles of alkanes in oxidative dehydrogenation catalyzed by h-BN, i.e., radical generator and substrate [14]. These studies indicate the important contribution of gas-phase radical reactions in ODHP catalyzed by boron-based catalysts.
A key aspect in the gas phase radical mechanism is the termination of radicals, which typically involve the collision or radicals with a quenching agent such as a solid surface. Wall effect refers to the influence of solids on homogeneous radical reactions by enhancing quenching of gas phase radicals via collisions with the solid “wall” [15], which has been widely studied in the combustion literature [16], [17], [18], [19]. Under the reaction conditions of ODHP, the mean free path of gaseous molecules is estimated to be ∼150 nm (See Supporting information for detail). Therefore, spatial confinement of boron species, such as in mesopores of SBA-15 and MCM-41, would lead to the enhanced gas-solid collisions, and in turn significantly impact the kinetics of ODHP.
In this work, we supported B2O3 on SiO2 with different pore structures, i.e., SBA-15, MCM-41 and fumed SiO2 (f-SiO2), to study the impact of spatial confinement on ODHP. The ODHP activity decreases by nearly 50 % in confined space. The apparent activation energy (Eapp) exhibits a positive correlation with the apparent C3H8 reaction order, regardless of the pore structure of SiO2. The apparent C3H8 order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is influenced by many factors, such as pore structure and density of silanol groups of support, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of C3H8. The observed kinetic properties are attributed to the influence of enhanced gas-solid radical reactions in confined space, i.e., radical quenching via collisions with SiO2 and generation of additional branching radical pathways on B2O3. The rate expression derived from the proposed mechanism is able to rationalize the observed trends of reaction order and Eapp.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of supported B2O3 materials
SBA-15 and MCM-41 were purchased from Nanjing Xianfeng NANO Material Tech Co., Ltd. Fumed SiO2 (f-SiO2) was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Supported B2O3 catalysts with different mass boron loadings were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method. H3BO3 (99.8 %, Alfa Aesar) was used as the boron source. After incipient wetness impregnation, samples were dried at 95 ºC for 12 h. Then, the samples were calcined at 600 ºC in flowing N2 (20 mL‧min−1) for 5 h.
2.2. Characterization of supported B2O3 materials
Nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiments were carried out on a Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 analyzer at −196 ºC. Before the tests, the samples were evacuated at 300 ºC for 3 h to remove adsorbed molecules. The specific surface area of samples was calculated based on the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and the pore size distribution were obtained by using the density functional theory (DFT) method included in the Tristar II software (version 3.03) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. When pore diameter is less than 10 nm, it has been shown that the methods based on the Kelvin equation, such as the BJH method, underestimate the pore size for narrow mesopores by 20–30 % [20]. Pore diameters calculated based on DFT method are used for discussion in this study. The mean pore diameter was determined by Eq. (1).

dA/dD is the derivative of surface area A to pore diameter D, calculated by using DFT model. D is the pore diameter, ranging from 2 nm to 200 nm.
Solid-state 11B magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) was performed on a JOEL JNM-ECZ600R 600 MHz spectrometer at resonance frequency of 128.42 MHz for 11B, with a 3.2 mm MAS probe at a spinning rate of 12 kHz. Before the NMR tests, the samples were dehydrated at 100 °C for 24 h.
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy experiments were performed on a Bruker Invenio-S spectrometer in a custom transmission cell. The samples were pressed into self-supporting wafers (∼10 mg) and loaded into a sample holder for vertical alignment in the infrared beam. Spectra presented are 64 coadded scans per spectrum at a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1. Vacuum levels of < 0.01 mTorr in the transmission cell were achieved by connecting to a vacuum manifold equipped with a mechanical pump and a diffusion pump. The transmission cell was heated by heating rings controlled by a PID controller. Prior to all experiments, the samples were evacuated at 550 °C for 1 h to remove adsorbed molecules. The samples were then cooled down to room temperature under vacuum.
The element compositions of supported B2O3 catalysts were measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) over Teledyne Leeman Labs Prodigy 7 after digestion with 2 vol. % HF.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a PANalytical X-Pert3 Powder equipped with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). 2θ of X-ray diffraction pattern was recorded from 10° to 80° with a scan speed of 10°/min.
2.3. Rate measurements for oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8
Catalytic properties of supported B2O3 in ODHP were evaluated in a quartz fixed-bed tubular reactor with an inner diameter of 6 mm under atmospheric pressure. In a typical experiment, mixed supported B2O3 catalysts and SiC (an inert diluent) with a mass ratio of 1:3 was used. The catalyst bed was supported by 1 cm quartz wool lug. The induction period of boron-based catalysts has been observed in previous studies.[21], [22], [23] To exclude the influence of the induction period, catalysts were pretreated in a stream containing C3H8 (10 mL‧min−1),O2 (5 mL‧min−1) and N2 (25 mL‧min−1) at 550 ºC, until the reaction rates reached steady-state. The reactor effluent was analyzed by an online Agilent 8890 gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). O2, CO, CO2 and N2 were separated by 5 A column (Agilent) and quantified by the TCD. Hydrocarbons (C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, CH4) were separated by HP-PLOT Al2O3 column (Agilent) and quantified by the FID. The C3H8 conversion was determined by Eq. (2).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physicochemical properties and catalytic performance
To investigate the ODHP kinetics on B2O3 in confined space, a series of supported B2O3 catalysts were prepared and characterized. B2O3 loadings determined by ICP-AES is in line with the nominal B2O3 loadings. (Table S1) Surface area and distribution of pore size of synthesized catalysts were characterized by the N2 physisorption (Table 1, Fig. 1 and Figs. S1 to S4). For B2O3 supported on SBA-15 (B2O3/SBA-15), as B2O3 loading increases, surface area and pore volume decrease simultaneously. The mean pore diameter of B2O3/SBA-15 also decreases from 8.7 to 6.8 nm, when B2O3 loading increases from 0 to 20 wt. %. In addition, the pore size distribution of B2O3/SBA-15 broadens as the B2O3 loading increases (Fig. 1a). These characterization results indicate that B2O3 is incorporated into the mesopores of SBA-15 [24]. Similar results were also observed on B2O3/MCM-41. At the same 5 wt. % B2O3 loading, the mean pore diameter of B2O3/MCM-41 is 3.1 nm, as compared with 3.2 nm for MCM-41. For B2O3/f-SiO2, the pore size distribution remains broad and largely unchanged with increased B2O3 loading (from 1 wt. % to 20 wt. %), which is expected as f-SiO2 does not have well-defined pore structures.

Introduction of ordered mesoporous support suppresses the ODHP activity of B2O3. C3H6 formation rate normalized to the boron loading (rC3H6) on 20 wt. % B2O3/SBA-15 is about 50 % lower than that on 20 wt. % B2O3/f-SiO2 (Fig. 2a), suggesting a negative impact of spatial confinement of B2O3 on the ODHP activity. The ODHP activity on 5 wt. % B2O3/MCM-41 is about half that on 5 wt. % B2O3/SBA-15 (Fig. 2b), and the mean pore diameter in the former is 5.2 nm smaller than that of the latter. These results indicate that the ODHP activity of B2O3 decreases as it is increasingly spatially confined, which could be attributed to the “wall effect” of SiO2 to induce the quenching of gas-phase radicals needed in the homogeneous activation of C3H8 [25]. rC3H6 on B2O3/SBA-15 exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the B2O3 loading (Fig. 2c). The initial increase in rC3H6 (normalized by the boron loading) with the B2O3 loading is unusual for a surface mediated reaction, as the dispersion of the supported species typically drops with increasing loading due to the increase in the particle size. If ODHP on B2O3 is a surface-mediated reaction, the results in Fig. 2c indicates that increased B–O–B connectivity exhibits higher catalytic activity. The crystallinity of B2O3 species increases with B2O3 loading, as evidenced by the appearance of diffractions peaks characteristic of the α-B2O3 phase in XRD patterns. (Fig. S5) Alternatively, C3H8 could be activated in the gas phase via a radical mechanism and B2O3 provides sites to generate radicals at the beginning of the reaction. This is a more likely scenario with B2O3’s ability of producing radicals [10], which will be further supported by results presented below.

Triangle (1 wt. %), rhombus (5 wt. %), pentagon (10 wt. %), hexagon (15 wt. %) and circle (20 wt. %) represent supported B2O3 sample with different loading. The hollow point represents the support is SBA-15, the half-filling represents f-SiO2, and the full-filling represents MCM-41.
Although the ODHP activity of B2O3 is dependent on support and its loading, product distribution on all supported B2O3 samples investigated in this work follows the same general linear correlations with the C3H8 conversion (Fig. 2d). When the C3H8 conversion approaches zero, the C3H6 selectivity is close to 100 %, indicating that C3H6 is the primary product in ODHP. As the C3H8 conversion increases, selectivity for by-products, i.e., C2H4, CO, CH4 and CO2, increases at the expanse of C3H6. > 80 % C3H6 selectivity is achieved at 10 % C3H8 conversion, and the product distribution appears insensitive to variations in the pore diameter of supported B2O3 (Fig. 2d). The correlation between conversion and product distribution among all supported B2O3 catalysts suggests that either B2O3 has the identical catalytic property regardless of supports and loading or product distribution is determined in the gas phase reaction network rather than on the B2O3 surface. The correlation is also in line with that on h-BN,[3], [10] which is consistent with the hypothesis that the active sites on h-BN is oxidized boron species.[22], [26].
Interestingly, the ODHP activity of supported B2O3 catalysts in confined space appears to increase with the apparent activation energy (Eapp). In Fig. 2b, Eapp on 5 wt. % B2O3/MCM-41 (169 kJ‧mol−1) at pC3H8 = 0.25 atm is less than that of 5 wt. % B2O3/SBA-15 (218 kJ‧mol−1), while rC3H6 on the former is roughly half of that on the latter. Meanwhile, Eapp on B2O3/SBA-15 with different boron loadings are generally consistent (Fig. 2c). It seems that support have a significant impact on the properties of B2O3 catalysts, such as surface coverage of active sites and the coordination environment of boron species. The cause of the varied Eapp will be discussed in the next section.
3.2. Effect of boron loading and support on reaction order of C3H8
The apparent C3H8 reaction order of B2O3/SiO2 is dependent on pC3H8 and B2O3 loading, ranging from 1 to 3 (Fig. 3 and S6 to S8, Table S2). On 1 wt. % B2O3/f-SiO2, the apparent C3H8 reaction order increases from 1.30 to 1.85 as pC3H8 increases beyond 0.15 atm (Fig. S7a). A C3H8 reaction order of ∼2 is determined throughout the pC3H8 range investigated (0–0.25 atm) on 20 wt. % B2O3/f-SiO2, which is consistent with most reported boron-containing catalysts without spatial confinement (Fig. S7b) [3], [26]. This has been rationalized by the dual role of alkane, i.e., radical initiator and reactant, in our recent work [14]. The general trend that the C3H8 reaction order tends to increase with pC3H8 and B2O3 loading also holds for B2O3/SBA-15. At low B2O3 loadings (1 wt. % and 5 wt. %), there are clearly two regions with distinct reaction orders of C3H8 on B2O3/SBA-15, with the higher order observed at higher pC3H8 (Fig. 3a and S6a). Taking 1 wt. % B2O3/SBA-15 as an example, the reaction order of C3H8 is 1.17 at pC3H8 below 0.1 atm, before rising to 2.27 above 0.15 atm (Fig. 3a). First order dependence of rC3H6 on pC3H8 has been attributed to the activation of C3H8 on the active boron sites through an Eley-Rideal mechanism with O2.[9], [27] At B2O3 loading above 5 wt. %, only one C3H8 reaction order is present, and the reaction order increases with the B2O3 loading up to 3.12 on 20 wt. % B2O3/SBA-15 (Fig. 3b, S6b and S6c). To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of C3H8 reaction order substantially above 2 on boron-based catalysts. The fact that this higher reaction order is present when the support is SBA-15 but not f-SiO2 suggests the spatial confinement of B2O3 in the mesoporous support is likely a key cause. 5 wt. % B2O3/MCM-41 shows a similar trend of increasing C3H8 reaction order with pC3H8 but to a much lesser extent, which will be discussed in more details below.

The gray column represents the C3H8 order is in the range of “low partial pressure of C3H8” (pC3H8 ≤ 0.1 atm). The diagonal white column represents the C3H8 order is in the range of “high partial pressure of C3H8” (0.15 atm ≤ pC3H8 ≤ 0.25 atm). The diagonal white column with “pf” represents the C3H8 order is in the range of full C3H8 partial pressure (pC3H8 ≤ 0.25 atm).
Intriguingly, Eapp exhibits a positive correlation with the apparent propane reaction order (Fig. 4 and S9–11). On B2O3/SBA-15 with two distinct C3H8 reaction orders, i.e., 1 wt. % and 5 wt. % B2O3, Eapp were measured at low (0.075 atm) and high (0.25 atm) pC3H8, corresponding to two different C3H8 reaction orders observed (Fig. 3a). When the reaction order of C3H8 is less than 1.5, Eapp is in the range of 125–150 kJ‧mol−1, while Eapp is around 200 kJ‧mol−1 when the C3H8 reaction order exceeds 2, as on h-BN [3]. Importantly, this correlation also holds for B2O3/f-SiO2 and B2O3/MCM-41 with various B2O3 loadings (Fig. 4), indicating that this correlation is likely independent of the dispersion of boron and the support.

3.3. Mechanistic interpretation of B2O3-catalyzed ODHP
Measured C3H8 reaction order and Eapp on B2O3 in confined space could be interpreted by a gas-phase radical chain mechanism initiated on the solid catalyst. In our previous study, the observed second reaction order of alkanes on h-BN was rationalized with two roles played by alkanes in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, i.e., reaction substrate and radical generator [14]. Considering the similarity of the active site on h-BN and B2O3 [6], it is reasonable to interpret the ODHP kinetics of B2O3 using the proposed free radical mechanism of h-BN (Steps 1–5) [14]. In (Step 1), (Step 2), O2 is activated on the boron site to form BOO•, which reacts with C3H8 to generate •C3H7 and HOO• radicals, thus initiating the radical chain reactions in gas phase [10]. The hypothesis of O2 activated on boron sites is in line with the Langmuirian dependence of rC3H6 on pO2 (Fig. S12). The O2 reaction order remains close to zero when pO2 > 0.10 atm, indicating that Step 1 is quasi-equilibrated under the reaction condition in this study (pO2 = 0.125 atm). Then HOO• acts as a H-abstractor to react with C3H8 (Step 3), which has been established in the combustion literature [28]. The activation energy of the reaction between HOO• and C3H8 to form •C3H7 and H2O2 was determined to be 43.9 kJ‧mol−1.23 •C3H7 is a highly active radical species, which is readily oxidized by O2 with nearly no energy barrier to form C3H6 and HOO• (Step 4) [29]. (Step 3), (Step 4) constituted the chain propagation cycle and were proposed to account for the majority of the ODHP activity of h-BN.[13], [14] Unreacted HOO• is quenched through gas-solid collision (Step 5), as the termination stage of the radical mechanism.
(Step 1)
B + O2 ↔ BOO•
(Step 2)
C3H8 + BOO• → •C3H7 + B + HOO•
(Step 3)
C3H8 + HOO• → •C3H7 + H2O2
(Step 4)
•C3H7 + O2 → C3H6 + HOO•
(Step 5)
HOO• + * → H* + O2
By applying the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) to HOO•, the reaction mechanism outlined above could account for the apparent second order dependence of ODHP on pC3H8 on h-BN [14]. However, this mechanism could not explain the C3H8 reaction order above 2 on supported B2O3 catalysts (Fig. 3). The mean free path of gaseous molecules is about 150 nm (See Supporting Information for detail) at the ODHP reaction condition, which is 1–2 orders of magnitude greater than the pore size of the mesoporous supports employed in this work. This indicates that quenching of radical species via collision with pore walls could be an important factor in slowing down ODHP and impacting the C3H8 reaction order.
To rationalize the influence of pore structure on the observed C3H8 reaction orders, we propose that the spatial confinement of B2O3 could introduce an additional radical species capable of activating C3H8 in the ODHP network (Scheme 1). When B2O3 is not confined in micro- or meso-pores of the support, reactions between radicals and reactants in the gas phase is the dominant pathway for alkane conversion while reaction at gas-solid interface has a minor contribution to the observed rates. In this case, ODHP on B2O3 proceeds via primarily a gas-phase radical chain mechanism at the steady state, which is similar to that on h-BN. This hypothesis is supported by the second order dependence of rC3H6 on pC3H8 on 20 wt. % B2O3/f-SiO2. As a comparison, 1 wt. % B2O3/f-SiO2 showed an apparent C3H8 order of 1.30–1.85, which is less than that of 20 wt. % B2O3/f-SiO2. The decreased C3H8 order implies the inhibition of gaseous radical chain reactions occurs, which could be attributed to quenching of radicals via collisions with SiO2. This hypothesis is supported by the decreased ODHP activity of B2O3 in confined space (Fig. 2a and b), and the experimental results on the influence of inert surface on radical quenching [25], [30]. On B2O3/SBA-15, supra-second C3H8 order on B2O3 in confined space was also observed, which could not be explained by radical quenching. A possible cause for the supra-second C3H8 order is the introduction of a chain branching reaction, which tends to increase the concentration of radicals and influence the kinetics [31]. We propose that the decomposition of H2O2 on B2O3 to generate •OH (Step 6), which is a strong H-abstractor to activate alkane as proposed in previous studies [32], [33], [34], is a likely chain branching reaction. The produced •OH could activate C3H8 via H abstraction (Step 7), or quenched by collision with the solid surface (Step 8). The introduction of a second radical species, i.e., •OH, capable of activating C3H8 in the reaction network could help rationalize the measured range of C3H8 reaction order (1 − 3) on B2O3 in confined space.

Combine Eqs. (10) and Eq. (11), the concentration of [HOO•] at steady-state is given by

As shown in Table 1, the mean pore diameter of SBA-15 and MCM-41 is 8.7 and 3.2 nm, respectively, which is much less than that of mean free path of gaseous molecules at reaction conditions (∼150 nm, see Supporting Information for detail), indicating that reactants and gas phase intermediates collide frequently with the pore walls when confined in mesoporous materials. Since the activation energy of radical quenching through gas-solid reaction is close to zero [35], the rate constants of quenching, i.e., k5 and k8, are expected to be significantly higher than those of other elementary reactions. (k8 >> k7, k5k8 >> k5k7 >> k3k7) Therefore, Eq. (12) could be simplified to:
(13)
Substituting the concentration of [HOO•] in Eq. 13 into Eq. 11, and taking k5k8 > > k5k7 into account, an expression of [•OH] could be obtained:
(14)
Substituting the expressions for [HOO•] and [•OH] into Eq. 6, we obtain the rate expression for C3H6 formation:
(15)
Eq. 15 contains terms that are 1st, 2nd and 3rd orders with respect to
. The 1st and 2nd order terms correspond to C–H bond activation on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase by HOO•, respectively, as proposed in the recent literature [10], [14]. While the 3rd order term corresponds to C3H8 activation on •OH, the concentration of which is 2nd order in
(Eq. 14). The C3H8 reaction order (nC3H8) could be obtained by Eq. 16:
(16)
Since quenching of radicals is proposed to occur on SiO2 (Scheme 1), θ* is proportional to the fraction of catalyst surface not covered by B2O3. The variation of θ* with B2O3 loading could be estimated by the relative intensity of the infrared band of silanol (SiOH, ν(O–H) = 3735 cm−1) and boron hydroxyl (=BOH, ν(O–H) = 3695 cm−1) [36]. The area ratio of silanol to boron hydroxyl decrease with the increase in the B2O3 loading on SBA-15 (Fig. 5), indicating the monotonic decrease in θ*.

The observed dependence of the reaction order of C3H8 on B2O3/SBA-15 and B2O3/MCM-41 with low B2O3 loadings could be rationalized with (15), (16). At low B2O3 loadings, SiO2 is the most abundant species on the catalyst surface, i.e., θ* ∼ 1. When pC3H8 is low, the terms containing pC3H8 are expected to be small compared to those that do not, k5k8θ*2 > > (2k3k8θ*pC3H8 + 4k3k7pC3H82) and k5k8θ*2 > > (2k3k8θ*pC3H8 + 8k3k7pC3H82). Thus, the 2nd term on the right-hand side of Eq. 16 becomes insignificant, and the C3H8 reaction order approaches unity, which is in line with the gray columns in Fig. 3c. The first order dependence of the rate on pC3H8 indicates that the gas-phase radical chain reactions are inhibited by fast gas-solid quenching (radicals are colliding with quenching sites more frequently than other gas phase molecules). As pC3H8 increases, k3k8θ*pC3H8 gradually becomes large compared to k5k8θ*2 and k3k7pC3H82, leading to the rise of the reaction order of C3H8 from 1 to 2. At high pC3H8, k3k7pC3H82 becomes significantly larger than k5k8θ*2 and k3k8θ*pC3H8, bringing the reaction order of C3H8 to 3 (gray diagonal columns in Fig. 3c). Variation in the observed reaction order of C3H8 reflects change in the most prominent mechanism in C3H8 activation (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2. Schematic illustration of the relationship between C3H8 reaction order and ODHP mechanism over B2O3 in confined space.
The dependence of the observed C3H8 reaction order on pC3H8 can also be explained by the proposed mechanistic framework. At high B2O3 loadings, catalyst surface is increasingly covered by B sites, and the value of θ* decreases towards 0. Thus, the contribution from the term containing θ*2 in Eq. 16, i.e., k5k8θ*2, is diminished the most, followed by terms containing θ* (k3k8θ*pC3H8). This effectively reduces the range of pC3H8 with first order kinetics of C3H8 to ensure that the 2nd term on the right-hand side of Eq. 16 insignificantly less than 1. A similar reduction in the pC3H8 range is expected for the second order kinetics with respect to C3H8, though likely to a lesser extent. These predictions are consistent with the experimental observations. Reaction orders of C3H8 below 2 were only observed at B2O3 loadings at or below 5 wt. % on B2O3/SBA-15, suggesting that the pC3H8 range for the first order kinetics at higher B2O3 loadings is likely below the lowest pC3H8 employed in this study. At B2O3 loadings above 10 wt. %, the measured C3H8 reaction orders approach to 3, indicating that C3H8 is mainly activated by the H-abstractors formed in the radical branching reaction.
The correlation between C3H8 reaction order and Eapp is also supported by the proposed reaction mechanism. From the discussion above, it is clear that the observed reaction order of C3H8 is indicative of the main pathway through which C3H8 is activated, which is equivalent to identify the dominant term in the expression on the right-hand side of Eq. 15. When nC3H8 is close to unity, it suggests that C3H8 is primarily activated on the surface, corresponding to the term that is linear with respect to pC3H8. It follows that the measured Eapp at this condition should be close to the activation energy of C3H8 on the surface, which is denoted as Eini (Table 2). When nC3H8 is close to 2, the 2nd term in the expression on the right-hand side of Eq. 15 is dominant. The measured Eapp is expected to be Eini + Ea3 − Ea5 (Table 3). Similar reasoning leads to the expression of Eapp at the C3H8 reaction order of 3 to be Eini + Ea3 + Ea7 − Ea5 − Ea8 (Table 3). Endothermic elementary reactions which generate radicals typically occur through a late transition state [37], so the activation energy is close to the enthalpy change of the reaction, i.e., Ea3 = E3 and Ea6 = E6 [38], [39], [40]. Quenching of radicals is typically barrierless,[41], [42] i.e., Ea5 = Ea8 = 0. Values of activation energy are obtained from previous studies on gas-phase kinetic modelling (Table 2) [29], [35], [43]. The predicted Eapp based on the analysis above at nC3H8 = 1, 2 and 3 are Eini, Eini + 43.9 kJ‧mol−1 and Eini + 53.2 kJ‧mol−1, respectively (Table 3). The measured Eapp values at increasing nC3H8 show a similar trend, i.e., Eapp increases with the reaction order, which supports the validity of our kinetic analysis. Although it would be desirable for obtaining a quantitative or analytical relationship between pore size and kinetic parameters, this effort is complicated by the dependence of kinetic parameters of ODHP on the local environment of boron sites. The local environment of boron sites changes with the nature of the support and the B2O3 loading (Fig. 6), and thus such a mathematical correlation between pore size and kinetic parameters cannot be obtained with results presented in this work.

Fig. 6. 11B MAS NMR spectra of B2O3/MCM-41 and B2O3/SBA-15.
The markedly lower C3H8 reaction order observed on 5 wt. % B2O3/MCM-41, in comparison with 5 wt. % B2O3/SBA-15 (Fig. 3c), could be attributed to facile quenching by surface silanol in confined space and less active boron species. Surface area of MCM-41 is 40 % larger than that of SBA-15, which is expected to increase θ* and decrease the contribution from the fractional term in Eq. 15, and in turn decrease the reaction order of C3H8. The difference in surface area also influences the amounts of surface silanol (Fig. S13). The normalized area of silanol with respect to the thickness of pellet on bare MCM-41 is ∼75 % larger than that of SBA-15, further facilitating the quenching of gas-phase radicals and suppressing the ODHP activity. The local bonding environment of boron species is also influenced by the properties of support, which would in turn affect the ODHP activity. The 11B solid-state NMR spectra of 5 wt. % and 20 wt. % B2O3/SBA-15 exhibit a single band at ∼10 ppm, corresponding to boron atoms in B2O3 and hydroxylated boron oxide with trigonal coordination [36]. In contrast, in addition to the ∼10 ppm band, there is another band at ∼0 ppm on 5 wt. % B2O3/MCM-41, corresponding to tetrahedrally coordinated boron species [36]. 35 % of boron species in B2O3/MCM-41 is present in the tetrahedrally coordinated environment, which has been correlated with the first order dependence on pC3H8 and lower ODHP activity.[9], [27] Thus, the higher density of surface silanol groups and the significant fraction of tetrahedrally coordinated boron species could be major causes for the lower reaction order of C3H8 and ODHP activity on B2O3/MCM-41.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated the substantial impact of spatial confinement of boron species on the kinetics of ODHP, and proposed a radical chain mechanism capable of rationalizing key experimental observations. Confined environment enhances the gas-solid collision, leading to more effective quenching of radicals and the generation of additional radical species. The promotion in radical quenching decreases ODHP activity of B2O3, while the branching radical reaction increases apparent C3H8 reaction order and Eapp. The competition between radical quenching and radical branching leads to a wide range of apparent C3H8 order (1 − 3) and Eapp (120–220 kJ∙mol−1). These experimental results could be rationalized by the rate expression based on the proposed radical chain mechanism.
