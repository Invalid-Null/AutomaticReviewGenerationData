Synthesis and characterization of fluorinated polyimide/TiO2 nanocomposites: enhancement of separation of four gases, thermal, optical and mechanical properties
Nanocomposite gas transport and thermally stable membrane-based fluorinated polyimide/TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared via in situ sol–gel fabrication. PI/TiO2 nanocomposites containing 4, 8, and 12% TiO2 were successfully fabricated by in situ sol–gel fabrication. The obtained PI/TiO2 nanocomposites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetry analysis, X-ray powder diffraction, field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermogravimetric analysis data indicated an increased thermal stability of the PI/TiO2 nanocomposites compared to the pure polymer. The results of gas permeation showed the permeability of ethylene and propylene increased in PI/TiO2 nanocomposites compared to the pure PI. The diffusion coefficients of prepared hybrid membranes were determined by the time lag method. The results showed an increase in the solubility coefficient and a decrease in the diffusion coefficient of gases while increasing the TiO2 nanoparticle mass fraction.
Introduction
Improving the performance of polymeric nanohybrid membranes for gas separation is considered to be a main factor in the field of membrane technology. For this purpose, the factors that need to be addressed for improving the nanohybrid membrane performance are permeability and selectivity [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Membrane separation in this respect is a formidable approach. The performance of membranes can be improved by incorporating inorganic materials such as TiO2 particles into the polymeric matrix. Addition of TiO2 particles in the polymer matrix may disrupt the polymer chain packing leading to enhanced permeability [7,8,9,10,11].
Aromatic polyimides (PIs) are considered as one of the most important classes of high-performance polymers with a wide variety of applications from engineering plastics in aerospace industries to membranes in gas separation due to their exceptional mechanical strength and thermal stability, good electrical and optical properties as well as chemical resistance to many solvents [12,13,14,15]. However, one of the problems with high-performance PIs is their poor solubility or processability, in comparison with metals and ceramics, which limits their applications as engineering materials. To round this problem, different methods such as synthesis of copolymers or modified polymers by introduction of special groups into the polymer backbone were employed [16]. PIs bearing trifluoromethyl group (–CF3) substituent have drawn much attention because of significant improvements in the PIs’ properties. Actually, the presence of a bulky –CF3 group in the polyimide structure has been shown to impart steric congestion which leads to producing soluble PIs with more free volume. This also decreases the overall dielectric constant of the polymer. Taking this into consideration, the CF3-substituted PIs are potentially suitable candidates as membrane for gas separation. Therefore, by incorporation of NPs into the tailored-polymeric matrix it is expected that the obtained NC membrane exhibits high gas separation properties compared to conventional polyimides [17,18,19].
It is common to divide petrochemicals into two general sections, olefins and paraffins with their derivatives [20]. The most important olefins are ethylene and propylene. Olefins are mainly used for production of plastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene as well as chemicals such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, acetaldehyde, acrylonitrile and acrylic acid. Ethylene is produced primarily by steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstock with propylene as a byproduct. Propylene is produced by the on-purpose method including fluid catalytic cracking, propane dehydrogenation, methanol to olefin and olefin conversion. Olefin (ethylene and propylene) purification is the most significant and difficult section of olefin production. Currently purification of olefins is carried out by distillation. The separation of propane from propylene requires more than 200 trays if a grade of propylene with more than 99.5% gas purity is required. This process is highly energy intensive due to the low relative condensability of the components (1.09–1.15) [21, 22]. Due to the complexity and difficulty of the separation process, several attempts have been made to develop different separation methods such as extractive distillation, adsorption, absorption and membrane. Polymeric membranes are attractive alternatives for conventional separation methods because of some advantages such as low cost, good mechanical stability and ease of processing [23, 24]. But the separation factor of membranes, especially rubbery polymers, for olefin/paraffin separation is low and should be improved. Facilitated transport membranes have high selectivity but they have a stability problem and separation process has to be carried out under humid conditions [26]. Ito and Hwang [25] studied the separation of propane and propylene through cellulose acetate, polysulfone and silicon rubber hollow fiber membranes. The ideal selectivity of PPO was also reported to be 9.1 at 323 K and 2 atm feed pressure. Bickel and Koros [24] studied the pure and mixed gas ethylene/ethane and propylene/propane separation performance of polyimide base on 6FPA. The ideal selectivity of propylene over propane is higher than ethylene over ethane. The ideal separation factor of 15 and 3.8 was reported in polyimide based on 6FDA–IPDA for propylene/propane and ethylene/ethane, respectively.
In the present investigation, the preparation of high-performance PI/TiO2 nanocomposite membranes for separation of ethylene/ethane and propylene/propane had been reported. The hydroxyl groups of TiO2 formed linkages with PI chains, improved the compatibility between TiO2 and PI, and enhanced the mechanical strength and thermal stability of nanocomposite membranes. The addition of inorganic particles may improve the gas selectivity in two ways. First, nanoparticles make pathways for gases which could enhance the solubility and diffusivity selectivity of gases in polymer. Second, nanoparticles strengthen the anti-plasticization effect by restricting the thermal motion of the polymer chain. Therefore, in this study I have evaluated the effect of TiO2 nanoparticles on the separation of olefin/paraffin gases in pure polymer membranes.
Experimental
Materials (reactives)
5-Bromo-2-methylisoindoline-1,3-dione, p-toluidine and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (0) were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received. Commercially available N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), m-cresol, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and other reagents were all used as received. NMP and DMF were purified by distillation under reduced pressure over barium oxide before used in polymerization. DMAc and DMSO were distilled under reduced pressure and stored over 4 A molecular sieves before use. Research-grade ethane, ethylene, propane and propylene gases (purity 499.95%) were purchased from Technical Gas Service. Tetraethyl orthotitanate (Ti(OEt)4) and acetylacetone (acac) were employed as received. All the materials and solvents that were used were obtained from the suppliers without further purification.
Synthesis
Monomer synthesis [29]
The diimide compound 1 obtained from double N-arylation reactions of p-toluidine with 5-bromo-2-methylisoindoline-1,3-dione was carried out in the presence of palladium (II) acetate, rac-2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-binaphthyl (rac-BINAP), and cesium carbonate in toluene. The resulting diimide compound (1) was then hydrolyzed with aqueous potassium hydroxide, giving the corresponding tetracarboxylic acid, which in turn was converted to the new dianhydride monomer 2 by chemical cyclodehydration with acetic anhydride (Scheme 1). Elemental analysis, FT-IR, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopic techniques were used to identify structures of the dianhydride monomer. The carbonyl groups of diimide compound exhibit two characteristic bands at around 1721 and 1657 cm−1 which could be attributed to imide C=O asymmetric and symmetric stretching, respectively. After hydrolyzed and cyclodehydrated to dianhydride monomer, the carbonyl groups shifted to around 1825 and 1715 cm−1. Figure 1 illustrates the 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the dianhydride monomer 2 and these spectra agree well with the proposed molecular structure. Thus, the results of all the spectroscopic and elemental analyses suggest the successful preparation of the target dianhydride monomer 2.

Polymer synthesis [29]
PI was prepared by the one-pot, high-temperature solution polymerization of dianhydride monomer with aromatic diamine in m-cresol at 200 °C in the presence of isoquinoline as the catalyst (Scheme 1). Polymerization reaction proceeded homogenously and led to the formation of highly viscous polymer solutions that can be precipitated into tough fiber-like forms when slowly trickling into methanol. The resulting PI exhibited inherent viscosities of 1.67 dL/g in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) and can afford transparent/self/standing films via solution casting, indicating this is high molecular weight polymer. Moreover, the number average molecular weight (M n), weight average molar weight (M w) and polydispersity index (PDI) of the synthesized polymer were further supported by GPC measurements. The structure of these PIs was also confirmed with IR and 1H-NMR spectroscopic techniques, and the spectra agree well with the proposed molecular structures. The IR spectra of PI exhibit characteristic imide absorption bands at around 1775 (imide asymmetrical C=O), 1727 (imide symmetrical C=O), 1355 (C–N), and 755 cm−1 (imide ring deformation) (Fig. 2a). A typical 1H-NMR spectrum of PI shown in Fig. 2b reveals that all the peaks could be readily assigned to the hydrogen atoms of the recurring unit.

Fabrication of nanocomposite films
Absolutely dried dianhydride monomer (2) was added to a DMF solution of diamine (with the same molar ratios) in several portions and stirred for 1 h at 0 °C (Scheme 2). The temperature was raised up to 25 °C and stirred for 2 h to form corresponding poly(amic acid) (PAA) solution. According to the desired TiO2 percentages the required quantities of Ti(OEt)4 (dissolved in acac with a molar ratios of 1:4) were added and continuously stirred for 15 h. Thin films of pure PAA and mixed PAA with different percentages of TiO2 precursor were fabricated by casting onto dust-free glass plates. Resulted thin films were annealed using an electric air-circulating oven at 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 °C for 1 h each and 300 °C for 10 h and then were cooled and removed from glass surface using a sharp-edged blade [30]. The TiO2 percentages were 4, 8, and 12 wt%.

Characterization
FT-IR spectroscopy was performed on a FT-IR spectrometer (NICOLET 5700, Thermo Electron Co., USA). The test specimens were prepared using the KBr-disk method. The samples were ground into powder and then vacuum dried at 40 °C for 24 h before measurements. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) experiments were carried out on a Bruker 510 spectrometer using deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide as a solvent. The thermal behavior of PI and PI/TiO2 nanocomposite membranes was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) PerkinElmer DSC-7 from 50 to 400 °C at the heating rate of 10 °C/min and sample weights of about 5 mg. All DSC analyses were conducted under N2 atmosphere. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on a PerkinElmer Pyris-1 thermal analyzer system was employed to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymers. To remove water, the membranes were dried and kept in the TGA furnace at 150 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 15 min before testing. The samples were evaluated in the range of 100–800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere. Mechanical properties of the membranes were evaluated at room temperature on SHIMADZU AG-I 1KN at a strain rate of 2 mm min−1, and a 500 N load cell was used. The samples were prepared by cutting the membranes in dumbbell shapes of 15 mm × 4 mm. At least three measurements for each membrane were taken and the average value was calculated. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed with a Waters instrument (Waters 2414) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) was used as eluent (flow rate 0.5 mL/min). Polystyrene was used as standard and RI detector was used to record the signal in GPC. The gas permeability of the polymer/nanocomposite membranes with thickness around 30 mm was measured with an automated Diffusion Permeameter (DP-100-A) manufactured by Porous Materials Inc., USA, which consists of upstream and downstream parts separated by a membrane. Elemental analysis on carbon was conducted with a Heraeus CHN–O rapid elementary analyzer with benzoic acid as a standard. The cross section and surface morphology of mixed-matrix nanocomposite membranes were observed by scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Rather unexpectedly, the silica-filled PIM-1 membrane samples were more readily fractured under ambient conditions, whereas they were more flexible in liquid N2. All photos were taken using an accelerating voltage of 30 kV.
Gas permeability measurement
The pure gas permeability of ethane, ethylene, propane and propylene, and transport properties (see Table 1) of prepared membranes were determined using a constant volume/variable pressure method. [27]. The feed side gas pressure was 10 bar (gauge) and the active area of the membrane cell was 13.1 cm2. The specifications of the constant volume/variable pressure setup are also described in detail elsewhere. The gas permeability of membranes was calculated using the following equation [28]:

$$P = \frac{{273.15{\text{LV}}}}{{76p_{0} {\text{AT}}}} \;\frac{{{\text{d}}p(t)}}{{{\text{d}}t}}$$
where P is the permeability of barrier (1 barrier = 1 × 1010 cm3 (STP) cm/cm2 s cmHg), V the volume of the downstream chamber (cm3), A the effective membrane area (cm2), L the membrane thickness (cm), T the experimental temperature (K), dp(t)/dt the steady rate of pressure measured by a pressure transducer in the downstream chamber and p 0, the feed pressure with the same unit of p(t). The diffusion coefficient (D) was calculated by the time lag method as below:
$$D = \frac{{L^{2} }}{6\theta }$$
where θ is the time lag (s), the intercept obtained from extrapolating the linear region of the p (t) versus the time plot to the time axis D is the diffusion coefficient (cm2/s).
The solubility coefficient (S) (cm3 (STP)/cm3 cm Hg) was calculated as:
$$S = \frac{P}{D}$$
The ideal selectivity of membranes (α A/B) was determined from pure gas permeability as follows:
$$a_{\text{A/B}} = \frac{{P_{\text{A}} }}{{P_{\text{B}} }}.$$
Results and discussion
X-ray diffraction of nanocomposite membranes
Figure 3 shows the XRD patterns of the pristine titania, PI matrix and NCs with different TiO2 percentage. The XRD analysis for the pure PI film exhibits a typical amorphous structure, which is associated with the broad peak of 2θ at 20° in the range from 15° to 25° (Fig. 3a) [30]. The PI/TiO2 films, on the other hand, show additional sharp diffraction peaks superimposed on top of the broad amorphous background. The XRD patterns of PI/TiO2 NCs with 4, 8 and 12 wt% of TiO2 NPs indicate that the morphology of TiO2 NPs has not been disturbed during the process. The intensity of peaks corresponding to TiO2 NPs increased with higher concentration of TiO2 in the obtained NCs. All these data indicated that TiO2 NPs were dispersed in the polymer matrix.

FT-IR of nanocomposite membranes
The structures of the PI and hybrid composites were characterized by FT-IR spectra. Figure 4 shows the FT-IR spectra of the PI and NC materials with different amounts of TiO2 NPs. TiO2 showed the characteristic peak of hydroxyl group at 3444 cm−1 and the Ti–O–Ti bands appeared in the range 450–750 cm−1 (Fig. 4). The bands at 2880–2930 cm−1 can be ascribed to the C–H symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching absorptions of the CH3 group of the PI, respectively. In addition, the Ti–O–Ti bands are appeared in the range of 450–750 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectra of the NC films (Fig. 4b, c). This result verifies that inorganic TiO2 NPs were successfully formed in the hybrid PI composites by in situ sol–gel fabrication [29].

Electron microscope characterization of PI and NC films
The morphology of the PI with 4 and 12 wt% of TiO2 NPs was monitored with FE-SEM technique as shown in Fig. 5. The TiO2 loading and reinforcement binding with PI matrix are confirmed by the morphology. From FE-SEM images, any aggregation or phase separation has not been observed. This shows that the method for the preparation of PI/TiO2 NCs used in this study could make the inorganic part well dispersed into polymer matrix and give uniform and homogeneous distribution of TiO2 NPs in these NCs. As discussed above, the surface hydroxyl groups of TiO2 can inhibit strong phase separation tendency between organic PI and inorganic TiO2 NPs [30]. Even for the high TiO2 concentration, PI/TiO2 NC12% still can prevent the significant phase separation of TiO2 and lead to a homogenous distribution of TiO2 NPs (Fig. 5c, d).

Figure 6 shows the TEM micrographs of PI with 4 and 12 wt% of TiO2 NPs. In these images, no aggregation is visible between the TiO2 NPs and PI polymer matrix. The above observation confirms that surface hydroxyl groups introduced by the reaction with PI are important to counter-balance the phase separation tendency when the TiO2 content is too high [31]. As shown in TEM images, it was estimated that the particle size of the TiO2 NPs in the NC material PIs is around 25–40 nm with spherical shapes.

Thermal properties of nanocomposite films
The thermal stability of PI/TiO2 NCs and pure PI as references was investigated at the heating rate of 20 °C min−1 from 20 to 800 °C. Figure 7 shows TGA curves for the four samples: pure PI, PI/TiO2 NC4%, PI/TiO2 NC8% and PI/TiO2 NC12%. The pure PI film is quite stable up to 465 °C. The weight of the pure PI film remained around 98% under 505 °C and then substantially decreased from 525 to 600 °C (Fig. 7). The PI/TiO2 NC film showed a similar pattern of weight loss but at temperature (over 500 °C) higher than that of pure PI films and the decomposition was completed at around 600 °C [28]. The decomposition temperature at 5% (T5%) weight loss for these composites increases with the TiO2 nanofiller loading. At about 70 °C, improvement in T5% is found with 12 wt% TiO2 nanofiller loading. Excellent thermal stability should be attributed to the contribution of the covalent bonding interaction that existed between PI and TiO2 nanofillers. The 10% weight loss temperatures (T10%) of the PI is 540 °C and for NC materials with 4, 8 and 12 wt% of TiO2 nanofillers, it is 560, 575 and 580 °C, respectively. The char yields at 800 °C of the NCs with different TiO2 contents are higher than that of pure PI which provided more evidence of completely organic–inorganic bonding [31]. The char yield of NCs was from 52 to 65% at 800 °C. Comparison of the thermal properties of these hybrid materials with different NCs with similar structures shows that these hybrids had higher thermal stability because of the good interaction between PI and TiO2 NPs. Hence, TiO2 was incorporated into PI due to the strong covalent and partial hydrogen bonding networks formed during the process and the thermal properties were enhanced [29].

Mechanical properties of nanocomposite films
The effects of TiO2 NP loading on the tensile properties of PI/TiO2 NP films were investigated and the results are presented in Fig. 8. Filler consisting entirely of TiO2 generally increases the ultimate strength, but decreases the maximum extensibility. The mechanical properties of NCs largely depend on the external load transfer between the reinforcing nanofiller phase and the matrix [31]. According to the previous study [32], the strength should be reduced if there are no bonding sites between the organic polymer phase and the inorganic TiO2 phase due to the inert nature of the PIs and the weak interactions between these polymers and the TiO2. In this case, the TiO2 acts as nonreactive and non-reinforcing filler. It is generally believed that external stress on a polymer composite is transferred from the continuous phase (polymer matrix) to the discontinuous phase (filler). Therefore, the ultimate properties of the NCs are dependent on the extent of bonding between the two phases, the surface area of the TiO2, and the arrangements between the TiO2 particles. As can be seen in Fig. 8, the tensile strength of PI/TiO2 NPs films is significantly increased compared to the pure PI. The maximum stress at break (ultimate strength) was found to increase initially with increase in TiO2 content and at 8 wt% TiO2 showed a maximum value of 114.55 MPa (relative to the 97.12 MPa of the neat PI) representing considerable improvement in tensile strength. As the TiO2 content increases (12 wt%), the tensile strength of PI/TiO2 films decreases, but still better than the pure PI film because of increasing brittleness. According to Fig. 8, ultimate strength and initial modulus were increased with TiO2 contents, but ultimate elongation decreased with the increase of TiO2 contents, especially at higher TiO2 content. For elongation at break, the sample geometry (most importantly the film thickness) is an additional factor to consider and may be the determining factor for why the 8 wt% TiO2 sample shows the best result [33]. The above results showed that the interactions between PI and TiO2 are very important.

Gas permeation
Effect of addition of TiO2 nanoparticles on the gas permeability and selectivity of membranes
To investigate the effect of adding TiO2 nanoparticles to PI matrix, the permeation of pure ethane, ethylene, propane, and propylene was measured in both pure PI membrane and nanocomposite membranes at a temperature of 35 °C and at a feed pressure of 2 bars through the method described in the experimental section. The results show that in both these groups of gases, ethylene/ethane and propylene/propane, olefins possess greater permeation than the paraffins with the same number of carbons. The reason for this is that olefins have smaller molecule size (σ LJ) than paraffins. In addition, the length of the C–C bond in olefins is smaller than in paraffins (the length of the single and double bonds is 1.534 and 1.337 Ǻ, respectively). This induces the olefin to pass the membrane more easily. In other words, the permeation of such gases in polymers increases. The hybridization of carbon atoms in olefins and paraffins is sp2 and sp3, respectively, leading to a flattening of the olefin molecules compared to the paraffin molecules [34,35,36,37]. The order of permeation of ethane, ethylene, propane and propylene in pure membranes and nanocomposite membranes is the same as glassy membranes:
$$P_{\text{C3H8}} < P_{\text{C2H6}} < P_{\text{C3H6}} < P_{\text{C2H4}} .$$
Figure 9 a shows the effect of TiO2 nanoparticles on the permeation of ethane, ethylene, propane, and propylene in the nanocomposite films. As shown in this figure, the permeation of ethylene and propylene increases and the permeation of ethane and propane changes slightly by adding TiO2 nanoparticles to pure PI matrix. When we compared the permeation of ethylene and propylene through a pure polymer membrane to the permeation of these same gases through a nanocomposite membrane consisting of 12 wt% TiO2 nanoparticles, the following result was found. The propylene permeated through the nanocomposite membranes 120% more than it permeated through the pure polymer membrane and the ethylene permeated through the nanocomposite membranes 125% more than it permeated through the pure polymer membrane. In other words, their values rise from 0.053 and 0.064 to 0.11 and 0.14 barrier, respectively. In this regard, the permeation of ethane increased only by 13.5%, from 0.028 to 0.033. Meanwhile, the results indicate a reduction of 10% in permeation of propane in nanocomposite membranes with 12 wt% TiO2 nanoparticles, compared to the pure polymer, and its value decreases from 0.016 in the pure polymer to 0.013 in nanocomposite containing 12 wt% TiO2 nanoparticles. The considerable increase in the permeation of olefins through the nanocomposite membranes comes from three factors: structural changes that occurred due to the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles, changes in the permeation coefficient and changes in the solubility in polymer matrix. In the following, the reasons for such changes are evaluated by expressing the diffusion and solubility coefficients of the gases. The effect of the TiO2 nanoparticles on the selectivity of C2H4/C2H6 and C3H6/C3H8 pair of gases showed that the selectivity of the C2H4/C2H6 and C3H6/C3H8 increases from 2.10 and 2.66 in pure polymer to 4.55 and 7.44 in nanocomposite membranes containing 12 wt% TiO2 nanoparticles, respectively (see Table 2). We have compared the gas selectivities C2H4/C2H6 and C3H6/C3H8 in pure polymer membrane and nanocomposite membrane consisting of 12 wt% TiO2 nanoparticles. The result shows an increase of 80 and 150% in selectivity of these gases when we go from pure polymer membrane to nanocomposite membrane. As shown, the permeability of olefin gases increases in nanocomposite membranes because these molecules are smaller than that of paraffins and their solubility is higher than that of paraffins. The following section will discuss the fact that when we increase TiO2 nanoparticles, the sorption of more soluble olefin gases would increase more than the sorption of paraffins and then the gas selectivity would increase in advance.

Diffusion coefficient
Contrary to normal gases such as oxygen and nitrogen, the Kinetic diameter and the Leonard–Jones diameter for olefins and paraffins differ much. The Leonard–Jones diameter is the molecular space between two molecules that bump into each other with the primary kinetic energy of zero, while the kinetic diameter (σ Kt) is calculated using the minimum diameter of a cross section (r min) in which the maximum attraction energy occurs:
$$\sigma_{\text{kt}} = \frac{{r_{ \hbox{min} } }}{{2^{1/6} }}.$$
Kinetic diameter can be calculated using the minimum diameter of a cross section. Kinetic diameter only indicates the minimum required diameter of a molecule while diffusion happens; however, the length of a permeating molecule is not considered. So, there is not a proper relation between this diameter and the diffusion coefficient of long molecules. According to diffusion theory, a gas molecule can permeate only when the Brownian movement of polymer chains creates enough space. So these spaces have been created in the glassy polymers as freeze-free volumes in polymer matrix. The required space depends on the minimum cross section and length of diffusing molecule [38,39,40]. It is why the relation between Log D and σ LJ (R 2 = 0.98) is linear. This is shown in Fig. 9b for a pure PI and in Fig. 9c for nanocomposite membranes. The results in Table 2 show that the order of the diffusion coefficient of gases is proportional to the Leonard–Jones diameter as follows:
$$D_{\text{C3C8}} < D_{\text{C3C6}} < D_{\text{C2C6}} < D_{\text{C2C4}} .$$
The diffusion coefficient of gases is reduced by adding the TiO2 nanoparticle to the pure PI membrane. The reduction in the diffusion coefficient for ethylene, ethane, propylene, and propane is equal to 39.5, 34.5, 9.9, and 17.8%, respectively. The presence of TiO2 nanoparticles in the polymer matrix creates physical barriers against the path of the gas diffusion and makes that path long and twisty. In addition, as observed, there will be good interaction between the TiO2 nanoparticles and the polymer chains, and since the dynamics of TiO2 nanoparticles is lower than that of polymer chain, the overall dynamics of polymer chain will reduce. The occurrence of these two events in the nanocomposite membranes results in the reduction of the diffusion coefficient of gases in the polymer.
Solubility coefficient
Considering the results in Table 2, the order of the solubility coefficients in the investigated membranes is:
$$S_{\text{C2C6}} < S_{\text{C2C4}} < S_{\text{C3C8}} < S_{\text{C3C6}} .$$
The sorption of gases in the polymeric membranes depends on the condensability of gases, the interaction between polymer and gas, the rate and amount of free volumes in glassy polymers. The solubility in hydrocarbons increases as the number of carbon atoms increases. This can be attributed to the increase of condensability (increasing the critical temperature) and the interaction between molecules and polymer (increasing Leonard–Jones constant ε/K). But when carbon atoms are equal, olefins show greater solubility than paraffins, even though they have less critical temperature. This is due to the high polarity, flat structure and the presence of the electron cloud on the double bond. This polarity increases the affinity of olefins which leads to its interaction with the polymers and enhances their solubility in the membrane. The presence of the electron cloud on the double bond results in the increase in the formation of instant bipolarity and consequently better interaction between the polymer and the gas. Moreover, the entrance of olefins into the empty spaces of polymers is facilitated due to the small size of the olefin molecule [37]. The results in Table 2 show that the solubility coefficient of gases increases when the TiO2 nanoparticles increase in PI membranes. The presence of TiO2 nanoparticles increases the density of the polar group OH in the polymer matrix, and as a result, it also creates polar spaces in the interface of particles and polymer. This formation of polar spaces causes the increase in the solubility coefficient of condensable gases [38]. In addition, the results show that the solubility coefficient of olefins increases than that of paraffins. This is due to the higher polarity of olefins compared to that of paraffins. As the amount of TiO2 nanoparticles in membrane increases, the distribution of particles approaches to micron sizes. According to FE-SEM pictures, it has been concluded that the weak interaction between TiO2 nanoparticles and polymer occurred at the interface of the agglomerated micron-distributed TiO2 nanoparticle. This weak interaction creates voids at the interface. Therefore, these new voids would provide good sites for the absorption of gases through the membrane. The increase of TiO2 nanoparticles increases these vacant sites. It has been shown experimentally that if the TiO2 nanoparticles are incorporated into the polymer membrane at 12 wt%, solubility coefficient of ethylene, ethane, propylene, and propane increases by 220, 63.6, 133.4, and 4%, respectively. As mentioned before, the solubility coefficient of olefins increases more than that of paraffins with the same number of carbon atoms. Table 2 shows the diffusivity, solubility and ideal selectivities of membranes measured at a temperature of 35 °C and feed pressure of 2 bar. As expected, the results show the domination of solubility selectivity in increment of gas selectivity in glassy pure PI–polymer matrix. Addition of TiO2 nanoparticles increases the solubility selectivity and consequently leads to higher ideal selectivity. This increase in ideal selectivity can be attributed to the increase in the solubility coefficients of ethylene and propylene gases.
Effect of feed pressure on separation performance membranes
The effect of pressure of feed gas on the permeability coefficient, solubility coefficient, and diffusion coefficient of studied gases is given in Fig. 10a–d, respectively. As observed, the permeability and solubility of gases through the membranes are reduced as the pressure increases, whereas the diffusion coefficient is increased. The permeation behavior of glassy membranes follows the model of dual mode sorption. According to such a model, the gas sorption in glassy polymer is composed of the sorption in dense media of polymer (Henry’s model) and the sorption in empty spaces in polymer (Langmuir’s model). Langmuir’s model which is associated with the free volume in the glassy polymer plays an important role in the permeation variation of pressured gases in the glassy polymers. Langmuir’s absorption is about the trapping and sorption of gas molecules in available sites; therefore, low driving force is needed for sorption here. As a result, it is performed easily in low pressures compared to Henry’s site. In high pressure, the sorption in Henry’s regions plays an important role due to the saturation of Langmuir’s regions. Henry’s sorption includes the diffusion and solubility of gas molecules in polymer chains, so it is influenced more difficult compared to the sorption in Langmuir’s regions and more driving force is needed. As a result, the solubility coefficient decreases as the feed pressure increases. This reduction is more for gases with higher solubility. According to the partial immobilization theory expressed by Koros and Paul [41], the gas molecules absorbed in Langmuir’s regions possess less diffusion coefficient than that absorbed in Henry’s regions. So, in lower pressures, the diffusion coefficient is lower because most of the absorption occurs in Langmuir’s regions. But, by increasing the pressure, more gases are absorbed in the Henry’s regions; therefore, the diffusion coefficient increases. The permeability coefficient is calculated by multiplying the solubility coefficient by diffusion coefficient. As the pressure increases the solubility coefficient decreases and the diffusion coefficient increases. However, the decrease in the solubility coefficient is greater than the increase in the solubility coefficient; therefore, the permeability coefficient reduces as the pressure increases. This reduction is in agreement with the dual mode sorption model and indicates that a plasticization phenomenon does not occur in PI membranes for studied gases up to a pressure of 8 bar. It indicates the reliability of values related to the selectivity of studied gases. Table 3 presents the changes in the ideal selectivity of ethylene/ethane and propylene/propane by feed pressure for pure PI membrane at 35 °C. The results in the table show that the changes in feed pressure have little effect on the values of ideal selectivity.

Conclusions
In this study, two multi-purpose materials (PI and TiO2) are the fundamental constituents for fabrication of new series of functional NC thin films. PI matrix has provided a powerful media, for generation of TiO2 nanoparticles via a sol–gel manner, beside its effective role in the distribution of TiO2 nanoparticles. On the other hand, TiO2 nanoparticles have increased the gas transport and thermal stability of resulted materials as well as improved UV–Vis blocking efficiency. As TEM photographs confirmed, the TiO2 nanoparticles sizes were below 40 nm, well dispersed in the PI matrix, and also enjoy the favorable spherical shapes which are attributed to the relatively strong polymer–inorganic interactions. According to the XRD patterns, TiO2 nanoparticles possess the expected crystalline portion structures. The thermal analysis (TGA and DSC) of fabricated NCs showed the elevated heat resistance by increase in TiO2 nanoparticle contents. NCs with higher TiO2 nanoparticle contents absorbed UV–Vis more efficiently. The results of the gas permeability experiments indicated that olefins have greater permeation than paraffins with the same number of carbon. Also the permeability of ethylene and propylene increases as the weight fraction of TiO2 nanoparticles in membranes increases. The comparison of the selectivity of C2H4/C2H6 and C3H6/C3H8 indicates an increase in gas selectivity with increasing TiO2 nanoparticle content in composite membranes. The diffusion and solubility coefficients were determined by the time lag method. The results showed an increase in solubility coefficient and decrease in diffusion coefficient of gases with increase of TiO2 nanoparticle weight fraction.
