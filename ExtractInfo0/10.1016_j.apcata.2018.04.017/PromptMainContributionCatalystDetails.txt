1. Introduction
Propylene is an important chemical intermediate in petrochemical industry, which is usually used in the production of a number of chemicals such as epoxypropane, acrylonitrile and polypropylene [1,2]. Over the past few decades, propylene is mainly sourced from fluid-catalytic-cracking and steam cracking [3]. However, these methods cannot satisfy the ever-increasing demand of propylene. The catalytic conversion of propane into propylene has thus particularly drawn much attention and been regarded as one of the most promising ways for propylene production since it is economical to covert the low-value propane to high-value propylene. The supported Pt and CrOx catalysts have been used as active catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions [[4], [5], [6], [7]]. However, some questions such as catalyst deactivation, the high price of Pt, and the toxicity of Cr species hinder their wide application. So, the development of new efficient, low-cost and environmental-friendly catalyst systems for dehydrogenation reactions is of great significance.
Nanocarbon materials, such as nanodiamond, carbon nanotube and mesoporous carbon, are regarded as the promising metal-free catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis [[8], [9], [10]]. From an environmental point of view, nanocarbon catalysts enable a clean disposal by combustion after a certain life-time, making them attractive alternatives to noble metal or metal oxide catalysts for a more sustainable catalytic reaction. Also, nanocarbon catalysts exhibit many advantages such as large surface area, rich porous structure and tunable functional groups. To date, many efforts have been dedicated to dramatically scale-up the utilization of nanocarbon materials in various applications, such as supercapacitor [11], dye-sensitized solar cell [12,13] and electrocatalytic water splitting [14,15], and the functional groups and structure properties of the nanocarbon catalysts could significantly affect the catalytic performance. It has been demonstrated that the nanocarbons (e.g. carbon nanotubes, nanodiomand and ordered mesoporous carbon) are highly active for oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (ODH), and the oxygen-containing groups played important roles in the activation of CH bonds [[16], [17], [18]]. Very recently, several groups found that nanocarbons were active catalysts for direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. For instance, Zhao et al. [19,20] reported that the nitrogen-doped carbon materials exhibited high catalytic performance for dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene. While, our group [[21], [22], [23]] found that the ordered mesoporous carbons could be used as promising PDH catalysts, exhibiting higher activity and longer stability than the industrial catalysts. However, the active sites of nanocarbon catalysts for the direct PDH reaction have not been clearly certified due to the lack of fundamental understanding of the surface properties of the nanocarbons at high temperature. It remains a great challenge to look for a convincing evidence to demonstrate the active sites of nanocarbon catalysts for PDH reaction.
Herein, to evaluate the above considerations, the pristine multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were oxidized by HNO3 and H2SO4 and used as the catalyst for PDH. The contents of the surface oxygen-containing groups of MWCNTs were successfully adjusted by different acid oxidation and thermal treatments. The experimental results revealed that the activities of the nanocarbon catalysts were strongly affected by the oxidation process, and the oxidized MWCNTs showed higher catalytic performance than the pristine MWCNTs. The oxygen-containing groups especially carbonyl (CO) groups played important roles in PDH reaction.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and sample preparation
The MWCNTs (GT-350; diameter, 12–15 nm; length, 0.5–5 μm) were supplied by Shandong Dazhan Nano Materials Co., Ltd. Concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4 were purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Chemical Co. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Weakly oxidized MWCNTs: 2 g of raw MWCNTs was stirred with 200 mL of 65% HNO3 in a 500 mL round-bottom flask at room temperature for 2 h. Then, the mixture was slowly dropped into plenty of water (Vmixture/Vwater = 1:10) under ice-bath. Afterwards, the diluted mixture was filtrated and washed with excessive deionized water until the pH ≈ 7. The resulting sample was dried at 120 °C overnight, and denoted as wo-MWCNTs.
Mildly oxidized MWCNTs: 2 g of raw MWCNTs was stirred with 200 mL of 65% HNO3 in a 500 mL round-bottom flask at 75 °C for 5 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the mixture was slowly dropped into plenty of water (Vmixture/Vwater = 1:10) under ice-bath. Then, the diluted mixture was filtrated and washed with excessive deionized water until the pH ≈ 7. The resulting sample was dried at 120 °C overnight, and denoted as mo-MWCNTs.
Strongly oxidized MWCNTs: 2 g of raw MWCNTs was stirred with 50 mL of 65% HNO3 and 150 mL of 98% H2SO4 in a 500 mL round-bottom flask at 75 °C for 5 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the mixture was slowly dropped into plenty of water (Vmixture/Vwater = 1:10) under ice-bath. Then, the diluted mixture was filtrated and washed with excessive deionized water until the pH ≈ 7. The resulting sample was dried at 120 °C overnight, and denoted as so-MWCNTs. Note: many NO2 and SO2 would be produced during the oxidation process.
Thermally treated so-MWCNTs: Thermal treatment of so-MWCNTs was performed under a nitrogen flow (60 mL min−1) at 400, 600 and 900 °C for 2 h, respectively, with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. After that, the sample was cooled down to room temperature without further treatments, and denoted as so-MWCNTs-400, so-MWCNTs-600 and so-MWCNTs-900, respectively.
2.2. Sample characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained from Joel JSM7500F at 5.0 kV and Jeol JEM-2100F at 200 kV, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Brucker D8 Focus diffractometer with monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation (incident wavelength λ  = 0.15418 nm). N2 adsorption-desorption experiments were performed on a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer at 77 K. Before the measurement, every sample was degassed at 200 °C overnight. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) was performed on a TA SDT Q600 instrument at a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1 using α-Al2O3 as the reference. Temperature-programmed desorption-mass spectrometer (TPD-MS) experiments were tested in He with 10 °C min-1 from ambient temperature to 1000 °C. 0.1 g sample was degassed at 300 °C for 1 h prior to the measurement, and the product gases were analyzed by an online mass spectrometer (Shimadzu MS-QP2010 SE). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD (delay line detector) spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). Before the tests, all the oxidized MWCNTs were pretreated in N2 at 400 °C for 1 h. The O 1 s spectra were deconvoluted into three Gaussian peaks. And every spectrum was determined by C 1 s (284.8 eV).
2.3. Catalytic tests
The PDH reactions were tested on a fixed-bed quartz reactor packed with 0.2 g catalyst at various temperatures from 300 to 600 °C under atmospheric pressure. Before the tests, all the nanocarbons were treated in N2 flow at 400 °C for 2 h. The reaction gases consist of 5 vol% propane balanced with nitrogen at a typical gas flow rate of 6000 mL h−1 gcat−1. The reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (SP-6890) with a flame ionization detector (FID). And the type of the column is GDX-01. Experiments with blanks showed that the reaction rates were negligible without carbon catalyst. C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity expressed on mol% carbon atom basis were calculated as follows:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
The oxidized MWCNTs were obtained by different acid oxidation of commercial MWCNTs. During the oxidation process, a number of defects and oxygen functional groups can be introduced onto the surface of the MWCNTs [24]. Fig. 1 presents the SEM and TEM images of the raw MWCNTs and oxidized MWCNTs. From Fig. 1a–c, it can be seen that the as-received MWCNTs present a typical tubular structure with a width of 8–12 nm. While, the high-resolution TEM images reveal that the morphologies of the MWCNTs samples are maintained after oxidation, and only a few of amorphous carbons can be observed on the surface of the so-MWCNTs (Fig. 1d–g). This can be attributed to the formation of hydrophilic carboxylic groups and defects on the surface of the MWCNTs [25,26]. Furthermore, the structure integrities and the morphologies of the oxidized MWCNTs samples are similar to the raw MWCNTs (Fig. S1), suggesting that the oxidized process does not significantly destroy the microstructure of the MWCNTs.

The XRD patterns of the raw, wo-, mo- and so-MWCNTs are shown in Fig. 2. It can be clearly observed that all the samples show two characteristic peaks at 2θ = 26.1 and 43.1°, corresponding to the (002) and (100) graphitic diffraction peaks, respectively [27]. Obviously, the characteristic peaks of the oxidized MWCNTs are similar to those of the raw MWCNTs, indicating that the graphene layers of these oxidized MWCNTs are almost intact after oxidization by strong acid.

To further investigate the effect of oxidation process on the MWCNTs’ structure, Raman spectroscopy is selected to characterize these four samples (Fig. 3). Clearly, all the samples consist of two prominent bands, namely D (∼1340 cm−1) and G (∼1570 cm−1) bands. The G-band is characterized in-plane tangential stretching of the carbon-carbon bonds in graphene sheets, whereas the D-band is typical for the disordered part on the surface of the carbon materials [13,28]. And the intensity ratios of D-band to G-band (ID/IG) can be used to characterize the graphitization degree of the carbon materials. The higher of ID/IG value indicates the more defects, vacancies or amorphous carbon on the CNTs walls, whereas a lower ID/IG suggests less disorder in the graphitic plane. As depicted in Fig. 3, the ID/IG values of the raw, wo-, mo- and so-MWCNTs are 1.21, 1.22, 1.28 and 1.32, respectively, suggesting a progressive increase of the defects of the MWCNTs. This may be caused by a number of oxygen-containing groups introducing onto the MWCNTs walls after sequential acid oxidation process [29].

Fig. 3. Raman spectra of the MWCNTs samples.
The porosities of the oxidized MWCNTs are investigated by N2 adsorption-desorption analysis (Fig. 4 and Fig. S2), and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. From Fig. 4, the isotherms of all the samples are identified as type II according to the IUPAC classification [30]. The amount adsorbed increases gradually as the relative pressure increases. When the relative pressure is greater than 0.9, a very strong increase of N2-adsorbed volume can be observed, which is characteristic of the presence of many macropores [31]. It represents unrestricted monolaye-multilayer adsorption, and suggests a macroporous material whose pores and voids communicate with the surface of the particles [32]. Noticeably, all the samples exhibit well-defined hysteresis loops of Type H3, indicating the materials comprised of aggregates of plate-like particles [30,32]. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of wo-MWCNTs (387 m2/g) are similar to that of the raw MWCNTs (393 m2/g), suggesting that almost no structural changes during the weak oxidation process. While the surface areas of mo-MWCNTs and so-MWCNTs are decreased obviously. Similar results were reported on the oxidized CNTs that tended to form many oxygen-containing groups on the surface of the MWCNTs [33,34]. During the oxidation process, many oxygen-containing groups would be introduced onto the surface of MWCNTs. Even though the oxidative treatments are known to open a large fraction of the nanotube ends, some of the tubes remain partially or totally blocked by surface functional groups and structural defects [34,35]. After thermal treatment, the surface areas of the 600 and 900 °C-calcined so-MWCNTs samples are a little higher than that of the so-MWCNTs. This is probably due to the decomposition of some oxygen-containing groups of the so-MWCNTs, increasing the surface areas and pore volumes.

The TG curves of the nanocarbons are shown in Fig. 5, and all the samples are tested in N2 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. From Fig. 5a, the raw MWCNTs shows only 3.3% weight loss from room temperature to 900 °C. And the TG curve of wo-MWCNTs is similar to that of raw MWCNTs, indicating that HNO3 has little influence on the surface of the MWCNTs at low temperature. While, the weight losses of mo-MWCNTs and so-MWCNTs are 15.3 and 35.8% from 30 to 900 °C, respectively, which are much higher than that of raw MWCNTs and wo-MWCNTs. The thermal degradations of the oxidized MWCNTs are a multistage process [29,36,37]. Noticeably, the weight losses of mo-MWCNTs and so-MWCNTs are much higher than those of raw MWCNTs and wo-WMCNTs, indicating that numerous oxygen-containing groups are successfully attracted on the surface of the MWCNTs. Furthermore, the TGA experiments of these samples in air were also tested (Fig. S3). It is shown that the antioxidant capacity of the samples decreases with the oxidation degree rise, especially for so-MWCNTs. The thermal decomposition of so-MWCNTs can be completed at 634 °C, about 30 °C lower than that of the raw MWCNTs, due to the presence of a large amount of oxygen functional groups in so-MWCNTs. Noticeably, the TG curves of all the samples are similar to the corresponding curves in Fig. 5a when the temperature is blow 400 °C, corresponding to the decomposition of the carboxylic group and lactone groups.

The TG curves of the so-MWCNTs pretreated at different temperatures (400, 600 and 900 °C) are shown in Fig. 5b. The weight loss of 400 °C-calcined so-MWCNTs starts at 300 °C. While the TG curves of 600 and 900 °C-calcined so-MWCNTs show almost no weight loss before 600 °C, demonstrating that the low-temperature-decomposition groups on the nanocabon surface are almost decomposed by thermal treatment [38,39]. At higher temperature range (over 600 °C), the TG curves of 400 and 600 °C-calcined so-MWCNTs are similar to each other (inset), indicating the existence of similar amounts of quinone and carbonyl groups. Furthermore, no obvious weight loss can be observed in 900 °C-calcined so-MWCNTs, probably caused by the decomposition of most of the oxygen-containing groups after 900 °C calcination.
Fig. 6 depicts the TPD-MS profiles of raw, wo-, mo-, and so-MWCNTs, and the corresponding parameters are listed in Tables S1 and S2. From Fig. 6a and b, it can be observed that the intensities of CO and CO2 desorption peaks of these samples follow: so-MWCNTs > mo-MWCNTs > wo-MWCNTs > raw MWCNTs, suggesting that a large number of oxygen-containing groups are successfully introduced onto the surface of the CNTs by sequential acid oxidation. It was reported that the CO desorption mainly resulted from the phenol, carboxylic anhydride, and quinone/carbonyl species, whereas the CO2 desorption was attributed to the carboxylic anhydride at lower temperatures and lactones at higher temperatures [40,41]. Herein, the CO desorption peaks can be deconvoluted into five peaks, corresponding to carboxylic groups (peak #1), carboxylic anhydrides (peak #2), phenols (peak #3), and carbonyls/quinones (peak #4 and #5) [40,41]. The CO2 desorption peaks can be fitted into five peaks, corresponding to strong acidic (peak *1 and *2) and less acidic (peak *3), carboxylic groups/carboxylic anhydrides (peak *4), and lactones (peak *5) [42,43]. As to the raw MWCNTs, the signals of the CO and CO2 desorption peaks are so weak, suggesting the presence of a small number of oxygen functional groups in the raw MWCNTs. After oxygenation, the CO and CO2 desorption signals increase sharply, demonstrating many oxygen-containing groups are introduced onto the oxidized MWCNTs surface. These results are consistent with the TGA results in Fig. 5.

To further investigate the changes of the surface oxygen-containing groups of the so-MWCNTs after different-temperature treatment, the TPD-MS techniques were performed (Fig. 6c and d). As mentioned above, the CO and CO2 peaks in the TPD spectra of the so-MWCNTs sample can be deconvoluted into five peaks. Differently, the 600 and 900 °C-calcined so-MWCNTs samples exhibit no signal before 600 °C, indicating that many oxygen-containing groups including carboxylic anhydrides, carboxylic groups and phenols are decomposed after high-temperature calcination. The higher temperature peaks (peak #4, #5 and *5) of the 600 °C-calcined so-MWCNTs sample are similar to those of the 400 °C-calcined sample, indicating the presence of a number of the carbonyls/quinone groups in the so-MWCNTs after 600 °C-calcination. As to the 900 °C-calcined so-MWCNTs, no desorption peaks can be observed in the CO2 evolution curve, and only a small peak #5 can be observed in the CO evolution, demonstrating that most of oxygen functional groups are wiped out after 900 °C-calcination.
The XPS spectra of the raw, wo-, mo-, and so-MWCNTs are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. S4. From the general survey spectrum of these samples (Fig. S4), we can see that C and O are the only two elements which can be detected on the surface of MWCNTs. Especially, no signal of heteroatoms such as N and S can be observed, indicating the absence of heteroatoms in the activated MWCNTs. The surface atomic contents of O element are 2.3, 2.4, 4.0 and 9.9% for raw, wo-, mo-, and so-MWCNTs samples, respectively. Obviously, the values of O content are progressively increased after oxidation process, indicating that a lot of oxygen-containing groups are successfully introduced onto the surface of the MWCNTs. Fig. 7 shows the high resolution XPS O1s spectra of these four samples. And all the XPS spectra can be fitted into three main peaks, corresponding to quinone/carbonyl groups (O1, 531.2–531.5 eV), COC and COH groups (O2, 532.5–533.6 eV), and adsorbed water (O3, 533.9–535.6) [44,45]. Noticeably, the O concentration increases sharply after sequential acid oxidation, typically for CO, e.g. 0.36, 0.43, 0.90, 2.19% for raw, wo-, mo- and so-MWCNTs, respectively. This suggests that the acid oxidation processes can effectively introduce oxygen-containing groups onto the MWCNTs surface [46,47].

3.2. Catalytic activity
Previous reports have indicated that the nanocarbons are active for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (Table S3). However, there has been no systematic study about the active sites for direct PDH reaction so far. To study the catalytic active sites of the nanocarbons in direct PDH reaction, the propane dehydrogenation tests were carried out at low propane conversion (lower than 15%). Fig. 8 shows the catalytic activity and stability of the nanocarbons in propane dehydrogenation reaction. In addition to propylene being the target product, methane, ethane and ethylene are also formed over all the MWCNTs catalysts. In PDH reaction, two unwanted side and secondary reactions can occur, hydrogenolysis and cracking: In hydrogenolysis, the addition of hydrogen into CC bond results in the formation of two smaller alkanes; catalytic cracking results in radical intermediates, which rearrange into an alkane and an alkene [3]. These two side reactions lead to lower propylene selectivity. As shown in Fig. 8a, the initial catalytic activity of the oxidized MWCNTs increases with the increasing of the oxidation degree, exhibiting a progressive enhancement of the propane conversion. And the so-MWCNTs sample exhibits the highest catalytic activity with the propane conversion of 11.0% at 600 °C, which is much higher than that of raw MWCNTs (0.4%), wo-MWCNTs (2.8%) and mo-MWCNTs (7.6%). Noticeably, the selectivity of all the oxidized MWCNTs decreases with the reaction temperature rise, especially at high temperature range (over 550 °C). This is caused by the secondary reactions such as cracking and hydrogenolysis increasingly occurring at high reaction temperature [3]. The catalytic stabilities of the oxidized MWCNTs were also investigated (Fig. 8b), and the reaction temperature was kept at 600 °C. It is shown that the catalytic activities of the samples decrease obviously at the first one hour. Then, all the samples show a stable catalytic performance during the last time. Noticeably, the catalyst stability obeys the following order: mo-MWCNTs > so-MWCNTs > wo-MWCNTs. And the final propane conversion of so-MWCNTs is about three times higher than that of wo-MWCNTs. This is presumably caused by the increasing of the oxygen-containing groups.

Fig. 8. (a, b) The catalytic activity and selectivity over the oxidized MWCNTs, (c, d) the catalytic activity and selectivity over the thermal treated so-MWCNTs.
The catalytic activity and selectivity of the so-MWCNTs after different temperature treatments are shown in Fig. 8c and d. It can be observed that the so-MWCNTs shows decreased catalytic activity with the calcination temperature rise. Specifically, the propane conversion of so-MWCNTs-600 is 9.5%, which is a little lower than that of the uncalcined so-MWCNTs. While the so-MWCNTs-900 shows lower catalytic activity than raw MWCNTs and so-MWCNTs-600, with the initial propane conversion of 6.4%. However, the so-MWCNTs exhibits enhanced propylene selectivity with the elevated calcination temperature, e.g., the propylene selectivity of 86.8, 90.8 and 92.0% for uncalcined so-MWCNTs, so-MWCNTs-600 and so-MWCNTs-900, respectively. Moreover, the so-MWCNTs-900 exhibits the highest stability with almost no conversion decrease after 1 h reaction. Previous studies reported that the presences of carboxylic acid groups on nanocarbons might bring the subsequent deep cracking or prevent propylene desorption, resulting in the lower propylene selectivity [[21], [22], [23]]. The so-MWCNTs possess high content of carboxylic acid groups (as shown in Fig. 6), and thus, exhibiting low propylene selectivity. After calcination at 600 and 900 °C, most of the carboxylic acid groups would be decomposed. Furthermore, the surface area and pore volume of so-MWCNTs are improved after calcination (as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1), and the high porous structure favors the transmission of propylene and can improve the propylene releasing from the pore system [22]. So, the so-MWCNTs-600 and so-MWCNTs-900 show higher propylene selectivity than so-MWCNTs.
3.3. Discussion
Previous study reported that the nanocarbons containing a large number of oxygen-containing groups exhibited high catalytic activity in PDH reactions [[19], [20], [21], [22], [23]]. For instance, Zhao et al. [19,20] prepared N-doped nanocarbons and used for dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, exhibiting enhanced catalytic activity, and the outstanding catalytic performance was attributed to the CO groups and surface defects. Liu et al. [21] synthesized OMCs based on organic-organic self-assembly method and found that the sample exhibited high catalytic activity and stability in PDH. Lately, Liu et al. [23] found that oxidized OMCs exhibited higher catalytic performance than the pristine ones, demonstrating the importance of the oxygen-containing groups. However, the identification and quantification the active sites of the nanocarbons in the PDH reaction have not been clearly certified due to the complex surface structure and coexistence of different kinds of functional groups in the carbon materials. And systematic study of the surface properties of the nanocarbons at high temperature (over 600 °C) is still a great challenge.
In this work, the MWCNTs were oxidized by concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4. The oxygen-containing groups were successfully introduced and adjusted by the oxidation processes and thermal treatments. After treated at 400 °C, the main oxygen-containing groups in so-MWCNTs are lactone, phenol, anhydride, quinone and carbonyl groups [36]. After treated at 600 °C, the main oxygen-containing groups are quinone and carbonyl groups. When the calcination temperature is up to 900 °C, only a small number of quinone and carbonyl groups are attached onto the MWCNTs. As shown in Fig. 5, the weight losses of the oxidized MWCNTs increase with the oxidized degree, demonstrating a continuous increase of the oxygen-containing groups. And the antioxidant abilities of the oxidized MWCNTs decreased with extent of the oxidation degree, further confirming the increase of the surface oxygen-containing groups. Also, the XPS spectra of the raw MWCNTs and oxidized MWCNTs (Fig. 7 and Fig. S4) illustrate that the oxygen-containing groups progressively increase after sequential acid oxidation, e.g., the CO groups are 0.36, 0.43, 0.90, 2.19% for raw, wo-, mo- and so-MWCNTs, respectively. To selectively reduce some kinds of the oxygen-containing groups, the so-MWCNTs were calcined at 600 and 900 °C for 2 h. From Fig. 6, the TPD-MS results suggest that the 900 °C-calcined MWCNTs possess the lowest oxygen-containing groups with almost no CO2 signals. While the so-MWCNTs-600 possesses similar CO desorption signals at high temperature range. These results illustrate that the concentration and distribution of the oxygen-containing groups can be controlled by different oxidation processes and thermal treatments [[36], [37], [38]].
To further understand the effect of the CO groups in the catalyst performance, the linear relationship between the PDH activities (propylene formation rates) and the contents of oxygen-containing groups are correlated (Fig. 9). Fig. 9a shows the propylene formation rates versus the amount of the carbonyl groups calculated from the XPS analysis. It is shown that the propylene formation rates exhibit a good linear relation (R2 = 0.9981) with the contents of the CO groups, indicating that the CO groups are the active sites. This also suggests that amounts of the oxygen-containing groups can be adjusted by the controlled oxidation processes.

Fig. 9b shows the relation between PDH activity and the amount of carbonyl groups calculated from the TPD-MS results. It is shown that the carbonyl group amounts exhibit a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9788) with the propylene formation rate. This result is in good accordance with the XPS analysis, and further demonstrates the active sites of the carbonyl groups. As reported previously, the CO groups are regarded as the main active sites for ODH reactions [[16], [17], [18],48]. This conclusion can also be suitable for the PDH reaction, where the CO groups act as the main active sites. In the dehydrogenation of propane, CO activates propane as the electron donor. Propylene is produced and hydroxyl groups (COH) remain as intermediates. The reaction cycle is closed by the thermal decomposition of COH to CO and molecular hydrogen, which is thermodynamically favorable at high temperature [49].
The Arrhenius plots of the oxidized MWCNTs (ln r versus 1/T) are shown in Fig. 10, and the resultant apparent activation energy (Ea) are shown in Table 1. Noticeably, the Ea of the oxidized MWCNTs decrease with the extent of oxidation treatments, e.g., wo-, mo-, so-MWCNTs are about 75.8, 55.8 and 44.3 kJ/mol. This could be attributed to the enhanced oxygen-containing groups. During the oxidation process, many oxygen-containing groups (such as lactone, phenol, anhydride, quinone and carbonyl groups) are introduced onto the surface of so-MWCNTs, which could act as the active sites to decrease the Ea. After treated at 600 and 900 °C, many oxygen-containing groups such as lactone, phenol and anhydride are decomposed. So, the main oxygen-containing groups in so-MWCNTs-600 and so-MWCNTs-900 are carbonyl groups. Correspondingly, the Ea values of the 600 and 900 °C-calcined so-MWCNTs are similar to each other with 72.7 and 75.3 kJ/mol to so-MWCNTs-600 and so-MWCNTs-900, respectively. This result confirms that the active sites in so-MWCNTs-600 and so-MWCNTs-900 are carbonyl groups [48]. As shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, some oxygen-containing groups including carboxylic, lactone, phenol and anhydride groups are decomposed after high-temperature calcination (over 600 °C), leaving a number of CO groups, and the contents of CO groups can be adjusted by the controlled calcination process. From Fig. 9, the propane formation rates exhibit a good linear relation with the amounts of the CO groups. Considering these information, it can be concluded that the main active sties on the MWCNTs are the CO groups over the PDH reaction.

4. Conclusions
Oxidized MWCNTs with different amounts of oxygen functional groups were successfully controlled by sequential acid oxidation and thermal treatment. The oxidized MWCNTs were used as the model catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, exhibiting higher catalytic activity than raw MWCNTs. The oxidation process and thermal treatment would significantly affect the oxygen-containing groups of the nanocarbons, thus affecting their catalytic performance. And the amount of carbonyl/quinones groups shows a good linear relation to the initial propylene formation rate, confirming that the carbonyl/quinones groups are the active sites in the PDH reactions. This study provides a direct evidence of the active sites for the carbon catalysts in PDH, suggesting that nanocarbon materials containing abundant oxygen-containing groups can be used as promising catalysts in PDH reaction.
