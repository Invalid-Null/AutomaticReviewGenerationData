Impact of Heteroatom Speciation on the Activity and Stability of Carbon-Based Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation
Graphical Abstract
Oxygen lives matter: Comparison of carbon catalysts integrating distinct oxygen and nitrogen species shows that the content of carbonyl and phenol groups governs the activity in propane dehydrogenation. The higher stability of oxygen functionalities in polyaniline-derived materials than activated carbons reveals a critical role of the local atomic structure, while KOH-treatments to boost oxygen content and surface area further retard deactivation.
Abstract
Metal-free carbon catalysts represent attractive alternatives to platinum and chromium-containing systems for the on-purpose production of propylene, a crucial chemical building block, via non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. However, the role of heteroatoms in determining reactivity and stability is poorly understood. Here, the study of a platform of polyaniline-derived and activated carbons, with distinct porous properties, and heteroatom type, content, and speciation, enables establishing improved structure-performance relationships. In-depth characterization reveals that, while several oxygen species potentially catalyze the reaction, carbonyl groups are the main functionality governing the activity. Oxygen loss via propane-driven water evolution is the main deactivation path. Six-fold enhanced stability evidenced over carbon catalysts derived from KOH-post-treated polyanilines demonstrates the importance of controlling the nanostructure for enhancing longevity.
Introduction
Abundant conventional and unconventional natural gas reserves are rich in propane (≤10 mol.%) and can potentially serve as a feedstock for propylene, one of the most relevant platform molecules of the chemical industry.1 Currently, propylene is produced via the steam- and catalytic cracking of naphtha or other oil fractions in quantities of over 100 million tons per year for the manufacture of polymers, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.2 However, these technologies are energy intensive, with steam cracking alone accounting for up to 8 % of primary energy consumption in the chemical industry.3 Furthermore, these processes mainly yield ethylene, resulting in a growing gap between the increasing demand for propylene and its limited supply capacity, which calls for more sustainable and versatile production routes.1a Consequently, considerable research efforts are devoted to developing “on purpose” technologies that exclusively yield this olefin.4 Among various catalytic approaches investigated,5 the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) finds commercial implementation in the Catofin™ and Oleflex™ processes over supported chromium oxide (CrOx)- and platinum-tin (Pt−Sn)-based systems.6 Still, rapid deactivation due to the deposition of coke as well as particle sintering requires regeneration of the catalyst as often as every 12 minutes on stream.1a Although these effects can be alleviated by using several reactors in parallel in reaction-regeneration cycles, such configurations hinder the implementation of PDH technologies at small scales,7 which is a relevant strategy to valorize stranded natural gas reserves.8
Aiming at extending the scope of PDH technologies, several studies have attempted to control the nanostructure of Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, for example, by modification with alkali as well as transition metals.9 Different catalyst formulations have also been disclosed,10 among which nanostructured carbons have emerged as promising metal-free alternatives. In particular, activated,11 mesoporous,12 and heteroatom-doped carbons,13 as well as carbon nanotubes14 demonstrate promising reactivity for the on-purpose generation of propylene from propane. Carbonyl groups were proposed as the active sites for PDH almost a decade ago based on the enhanced activity of ordered mesoporous carbons pre-treated with nitric acid, which increased the amount of these groups.11a, 12b Linear correlations between the amount of surface carbonyl and the reaction rate have since been reported,11b, 12a, 14 but typically over limited sets of samples. In the study of other heteroatoms, phosphorus was also shown to promote PDH activity, while the role of nitrogen and boron has not been fully established.13b Notably, the stability of these systems has been scarcely discussed, and an in-depth analysis of distinct surface functional groups is lacking, hampering the derivation of structure-performance relations. This hurdle arises from the complexity of controlling and characterizing the large variety of functional groups present in carbons, which renders the precise and systematic evaluation of carbon-based systems challenging.
To address this, we synthesize a platform of carbon catalysts with distinct porous properties and heteroatom type, content, and speciation and assess their performance in propane dehydrogenation. Characterization by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature-programed techniques enables the identification of the active surface functional groups and monitoring of their evolution under reaction conditions. The findings permit rationalization of the enhanced activity and stability of polyaniline-derived compared to HNO3-activated carbons. They also explain the beneficial role of KOH post-synthetic treatments, which yield six-fold enhanced stability.
Results and Discussion
Synthesis and characterization of carbon catalysts
To refine property-performance relations in PDH, a platform of metal-free carbons with tailored textural properties and heteroatom speciation was prepared based on polyaniline precursors (Figure 1). In particular, a two-step synthetic approach was followed, including (i) polymerization of aniline at a molar oxidant:aniline ratio of 1 under acidic conditions and (ii) carbonization of the thus derived polyaniline at 873, 1073, and 1273 K, following a reported method.15 The resulting catalysts were labeled PAC-873, PAC, and PAC-1273, respectively. Based on this approach, two additional systems, namely PAC2 and PAC3, were synthesized by varying the oxidant:aniline ratio to 0.5 and 0.25, respectively, to tune the porosity of the derived N-doped carbons. Accordingly, Ar sorption revealed that, while the PAC sampled possessed a specific surface area (SBET) of ca. 620 m2 g−1, a change in carbonization temperature or oxidant:aniline led to a considerable reduction in textural properties (≤343 m2 g−1; Table S1).

The sample codes and the surface area (SBET, color coded) are indicated. Four additional PAC samples were synthesized varying the oxidant:aniline ratio during polyaniline synthesis (PAC2 and PAC3) or the subsequent carbonization temperature (Tcarb, PAC-873 and PAC-1273), as described in the Experimental section. Atom coloring: C: gray, H: white, N: blue.
To increase the porosity of the polyaniline-derived carbons,16 an additional post-treatment by secondary carbonization at 1073 K in the presence of KOH was applied, resulting in the sample PAC-K1. Furthermore, another N-doped carbon with increased porosity, named PAC-K2, was prepared by (i) polymerizing aniline in the presence of phytic acid, (ii) carbonization at 673 K, and (iii) post-treatment in the presence of KOH at 1073 K, following a reported method.17 Accordingly, this resulted in an increased SBET of over 1400 and 4000 m2 g−1 for PAC-K1 and PAC-K2, respectively (Table S1), consistent with previous studies.17 The type I isotherms are typical of materials exhibiting predominantly microporosity (Figure 2a).18 Besides, characterization of the N-doped carbons by Raman spectroscopy enabled assessment of the degree of disorder in their carbon lattice by evaluating the ratio between the intensity of the bands located at 1340 cm−1 (ID) and 1595 cm−1 (IG), originating from the stretching vibrations of disordered and graphitic carbon, respectively (Figure S1).19 In particular, PAC, PAC-K1, and PAC-K2 showed similar ID/IG ratios (0.94–1.08), indicating that the KOH treatment did not affect the defect structure of the carbon.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the PAC and PAC-K1 materials also shared a similar granular morphology, while PAC-K2 was composed of much larger and more continuous fragments containing curled single-carbon layers enclosing micropores (Figures 2b and S2). Quantification of the bulk heteroatom content by elemental analysis (Table S2), showed that PAC contained large amounts of both oxygen (10.8 wt.%) and nitrogen (10.1 wt.%). Interestingly, the nitrogen content was strongly reduced in the KOH-treated samples PAC-K1 (5.2 wt.%) and PAC-K2 (1.6 wt.%), while the oxygen content almost doubled (21.7 wt.% and 17.8 wt.%, respectively). These findings demonstrate the broad control of the heteroatom type and content attainable in polyaniline-derived carbons. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in an oxygen atmosphere was conducted to assess the thermal stability of the N-doped carbons. Comparison of the temperature of 50 wt.% decomposition (T50), showed that this was considerably lower in PAC-K1 (T50=786 K) and PAC-K2 (T50=758 K) compared to PAC (T50=942 K, Figure S3), revealing their lower thermal stability, which is likely caused by the increased amount of bulk oxygen (Table S2).20
For comparison, commercial activated carbon (AC) was also studied and subjected to standard oxidative treatment with HNO3 (AC-O) and subsequently doped using dicyandiamide (AC-N) to assess effects of additional surface oxygen and nitrogen groups, respectively.21 Ar sorption revealed that all AC-based samples possessed a total surface area of≥1490 m2 g−1 comparable to PAC-K1 (Table S1), originating primarily from micropores (Figure 2a). Characterization by elemental analysis revealed that while the first oxidative treatment in AC-O considerably increased the oxygen content from 3 to 20 wt.%, comparable to that of PAC-K1 and PAC-K2, the subsequent doping with dicyandiamide in AC-N decreased the amount of bulk oxygen to values similar to those of AC and introduced nitrogen in a similar amount to that in PAC-K1 (ca. 6 wt.%, Table S2). As observed for the PAC samples, the introduction of oxygen in AC-O led to reduced thermal stability (T50=929 K), whereas the subsequent nitrogen doping slightly increased stability (T50=1015 K) compared to pristine AC (T50=981 K). The thermal stability of these samples was superior to PAC and especially to PAC-K1 and PAC-K2 (Figure S3), likely due to differences in carbon nanostructures. Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the activation or N-doping of ACs did not generate disordered carbon (Figure S1, ID/IG=1.14–1.33). The morphology of the distinct activated carbons also remained unaltered, as evidenced by TEM (Figure 2b).
Investigation of the PAC- and AC-derived materials by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) provided further insights into the types of oxygen and nitrogen functionalities present (Figures 2c and S4–S6). The N 1s spectra evidenced four distinct peaks which could be assigned to pyridinic (398.4±0.2 eV), pyrrolic (400±0.2 eV), quaternary (401.2±0.1 eV), and pyridine-N-oxide (403.1±0.2 eV) species, consistent with previous reports.22 For nitrogen-rich samples, the main contribution arose from pyridinic and pyrrolic groups and the derived surface concentrations agreed with the bulk contents determined by elemental analysis. The O 1s spectra were fitted with three components assigned to double-bonded species such as carbonyl (C=O, 531.1±0.1 eV), single-bonded species such as ethers or alcohols (C−O, 532.8±0.1 eV), and adsorbed water (H2Oads, 535.1±0.1 eV), based on literature values.11c, 13b Despite exhibiting almost double the bulk oxygen content, for the highly porous PAC-K1 and PAC-K2 samples, the surface concentration was lower than for PAC. XPS showed that only a small proportion of oxygen resulted from absorbed water and the vast majority could be attributed to C=O or C−O type groups.
Another approach to probe surface oxygen groups is the temperature-programed decomposition in helium monitored by mass spectrometry (Figures 2d and S7), which permits discrimination of different species based on characteristic decomposition products (CO2 or CO) and associated temperatures.23 Consistent with previous reports,24 strong and weak carboxylic acid sites were detected at around 520 K and 670 K, respectively; carboxylic anhydride at 850 K; phenol and lactones at 930 K; and carbonyl groups at around 1090 K. Comparing the samples, AC-O, which has the highest bulk and surface oxygen content, stands out since it contains much larger amounts of O-groups with low thermal stability (carboxylic acid, carboxylic anhydride) than the other catalysts. This was caused by the fact that the sample did not undergo another treatment at high temperature after oxidation by nitric acid. The polyaniline-derived samples PAC, PAC-K1, and PAC-K2 mainly showed contributions from phenol, lactone, and carbonyl groups, while AC and AC-N show only very little signal, consistent with their low oxygen content, as evidenced by XPS and elemental analysis. After the AC-O sample was exposed to 850 K for 30 min, virtually all groups with low thermal stability were removed (Figure S8). The remaining oxygen species closely resembled those of the PAC-based samples, but in higher amounts. Interestingly, while temperature-programed decomposition evidenced a similar oxygen content and speciation for PAC-K1 and PAC-K2, an approximately 40 % higher oxygen content in PAC-K2 was observed by XPS compared to PAC-K1. This discrepancy suggests a significant surface enrichment of oxygen in PAC-K2, which might arise due to the use of phytic acid in the synthesis of this material.
Evaluation in propane dehydrogenation
Catalytic tests in PDH were conducted in a fixed-bed tubular reactor at 873 K and 1 bar. The reactivity was compared by analyzing the initial propane conversion (X0C3H8), determined after 0.3 h on stream (Figure 3, Table S3). In general, polyaniline-derived samples PAC, PAC-K1, and PAC-K2 displayed higher activity (X0C3H8=19–31 %) than those based on activated carbons (X0C3H8=9–15 %), with the samples containing higher oxygen contents showing improved performance (for example, AC-O>AC). The initial product distribution was broadly similar over all samples, confirming the high selectivity to propylene (SC3H6=79–100 %), the other products comprising the cracked products ethene (SC2H4<13 %) and methane (SCH4<17 %). Among all the catalysts studied, PAC-K2 showed the highest propylene selectivity at comparable conversion, resulting in a three-fold improvement in initial propylene yield compared to the least active catalyst (AC), which is comparable to state-of-the-art metal-free PDH catalysts.11b AC-N displayed a higher initial conversion than AC (X0C3H8=15 versus 9 %), indicating that the presence of nitrogen might also boost the activity, but the selectivity to propylene was significantly lower over AC-N at comparable conversion (SC3H6=79 versus 100 %). The observed differences in product selectivity between the samples could be related to nitrogen-containing groups, since the initial propylene selectivity decreases with increasing nitrogen content in all samples (Figure S9). Although the role of nitrogen functionalities in cracking reactions is not well understood, reduced selectivity due to cracking was previously reported over nitrogen-doped carbons in the dehydrogenation of isobutane.25

Filled symbols show the initial activity (tos=0.3 h), whereas open symbols are averaged over similar conversion. b) Relation between the initial propylene yield (tos=0.3 h) in propane dehydrogenation and the combined surface C=O and C−O concentrations, calculated by factoring the sum of molar contents determined by XPS with SBET. The gray line shows a linear least-squares fit considering only polyaniline-derived samples. Conditions in a) and b): C3H8:Ar : He=10 : 4.5 : 85.5; Ftotal/Wcat=100 cm3 STP min−1 g−1; T=873 K; P=1 bar.
To further rationalize the effect of heteroatom speciation on the observed differences in initial activity and unravel the origin of the enhanced performance of polyaniline-derived carbons, correlations between the specific surface area (SBET), the surface content of all functional groups identified by XPS, and the initial propylene yield were considered. A strong correlation between SBET and the yield is observed (Figure S10), consistent with the higher amounts and likely increased accessibility of oxygen functionalities in these materials. To enable a fair comparison of the effect of individual heteroatom functionalities, the atomic concentrations obtained from XPS were factored by SBET, which provides an estimate of the amount of sites available per gram of catalyst with the unit m2 g−1 (Figures 3b, S9, and S10). If all atoms on the surface (C, H, or N) are assumed to occupy a similar area, the obtained value corresponds to the total area occupied by the specific group (determined by XPS) available per gram of catalyst. Hence, if one group constitutes an active site, a larger available area of active sites should increase the reaction rate. Distinct trends were observed for PAC compared to AC materials in all cases, suggesting differences in the structure of heteroatoms groups in these samples and their impact on the performance.
Hence, we focus on the development of structure-performance relations for polyaniline-derived samples. Within these, a strong linear correlation (R2=0.92) was evidenced between the total amount of oxygen and the propylene yield. Adsorbed water was not considered since these species are readily removed under reaction conditions. Consistent with previous observations,11b, 12a, 14 C=O-type groups were a good descriptor of activity (R2=0.87). However, C−O-type groups also showed a significant correlation (R2=0.90). The individual contributions of C−O and C=O could be decoupled since no correlation between them was observed (Figure S11). As indicated by temperature-programed decomposition (Figure 2d), at the reaction conditions these groups constitute phenol or lactone, and carbonyl groups, respectively. Most likely, their reactivity is related to their nucleophilic character, enabling them to react with electron-poor saturated hydrocarbons as it was suggested for the oxidative propane dehydrogenation.26 Assuming a similar mechanism, it is also conceivable that C=O groups may react through an O−H group intermediate, suggesting that O−H groups can be converted to C=O groups, which possibly explains the observed trend for both types of oxygen. For nitrogen-containing groups, no clear correlation could be identified except for pyridine-N-oxide species (R2=0.78), which is likely due to the corresponding electron-rich oxygen atoms. In summary, the results suggest that multiple oxygen functionalities might be responsible for or promote PDH activity over carbon-based materials. However, since the presented correlations are only based on initial activity, it is important to consider the evolution over time to judge if a site can enable actual catalytic turnover.
Catalyst stability and propane-driven water evolution
To evaluate the catalyst stability, the performance of the distinct carbons was compared for at least 5 h on stream with a propane conversion of≤31 %. No H2, which is often co-fed to alleviate deactivation over Pt-based systems by favoring propylene desorption,27 was added. While all catalysts exhibited a loss in activity, differences in the extent of performance degradation were observed (Figure 4a). In general, among the catalysts with high oxygen contents, polyaniline-derived carbons displayed higher stability than AC-based catalysts, as evidenced by comparing the deactivation constants. PAC-K2 was identified as the most stable catalyst, exhibiting a deactivation constant of kD=0.1 h−1, half that of the least resistant catalysts, AC-O (Figure 4b). As expected, activity losses were accompanied by a gradual increase in propylene selectivity, which followed a similar trend for all catalysts (Figure 3a).

Conditions C3H8:Ar : He=10 : 4.5 : 85.5; Ftotal/Wcat=100 cm3 STP min−1 g−1; T=873 K; P=1 bar.
To shed light on the structural changes leading to the activity losses, a detailed analysis of the porosity and heteroatom speciation was undertaken on used catalysts collected after 5 h on stream. Ar sorption indicated that most materials presented similar or slightly increased total surface area and pore volume after use in the reaction, suggesting that blockage of the active sites by coke deposition is not the dominant deactivation pathway (Table S1). Comparatively, the Raman spectra also remained unaltered, displaying similar ID/IG values to the fresh catalysts in all cases, implying the absence of further graphitization (Figure S1). TEM micrographs of the best performing catalyst, PAC-K2, indicated that the general morphology, as well as the microporous carbon structure, was unaltered after the reaction (Figure S2). In contrast, comparison of the XPS spectra of fresh and used samples (Figures S4 and S6) revealed a strong reduction in the surface content of heteroatoms after use in the reaction. To probe the type of oxygen species before and after propane dehydrogenation without exposing the samples to atmospheric conditions, we performed temperature-programed decomposition experiments in He after thermal treatment at 873 K and after a 60 min exposure to propane (Figure S8). Notably, a significant loss of oxygen was observed, which was more prominent for AC-O than for the PAC samples. The smallest losses were evidenced in KOH-treated samples (PAC-K1 and PAC-K2), which agrees with the trend in the deactivation constant (Figure 4b), suggesting that oxygen depletion might be responsible for the observed deactivation. The higher robustness of these samples was confirmed by testing them for prolonged durations (Figure 4c). Interestingly, while the activity of PAC dropped by ca. 90 % compared to its initial value, PAC-K1 and PAC-K2 retain six times greater normalized activity after 20 h on stream, suggesting that the oxygen groups introduced by the KOH treatment are significantly more robust under reaction conditions. TGA analysis of the used catalysts evidenced no significant differences between fresh and used materials (Figure 4d), which is consistent with the negligible loss in porosity after 5 h on stream (Table S1), further suggesting that coking is not the dominant deactivation pathway.28
To gain insight into the mechanism of oxygen loss, a propane-pulsing experiment was conducted over the best performing PAC-K1 and PAC-K2 and benchmark PAC and AC-O catalysts, while monitoring the evolution of products by mass spectrometry (Figure 5a). Catalytic turnover in PDH was evidenced by the formation of C3H6 (m:z 42) and H2 (m:z 2) over all samples. During the first few pulses of propane, the formation of propylene is gradually increased, which is most notable for PAC and AC-O, suggesting that there is an induction period for the reaction. Due to the different timescales, this could not be observed in the catalytic tests in flow. Interestingly, upon propane pulsing, water formation (m:z 18) was observed over all catalysts, which was above the background contribution (Figures S12 and S13) even after 20 pulses of propane, suggesting that oxygen loss occurs via H2O evolution. Notably, PAC and AC-O exhibit considerable H2O formation during the first 5–10 pulses, which coincides with the activation period in these samples. The amount of H2O evolved remains consistently higher than that of the PAC-K2 and PAC-K2 samples after the activation, which is consistent with the higher rates of deactivation observed in these systems. These results suggest that KOH treatment is highly beneficial for catalyst stability, as it results in the formation of more durable oxygen species. To shed light onto the role of oxygen functionalities on H2O formation, the PAC system was characterized by temperature-programed desorption in He after being exposed in situ to either a series of pulses or a continuous flow of propane at 873 K to simulate the reaction conditions (Figure 5b). This approach permits more precise assessment of the oxygen speciation under reaction conditions, compared to the ex-situ evaluation by XPS. After thermal treatment in He in the absence of the alkane, the pristine material revealed the presence of substantial amounts of phenol or lactone, and carbonyl type functionalities, as evidenced by the temperature at which CO (m:z 28) and CO2 (m:z 44) evolved. Interestingly, upon pulsing propane, a sharp decrease in the content of lactone or phenol groups was observed, while carbonyl functionalities were less strongly reduced. Continuous feeding of C3H8 for 10 min depleted virtually all phenol and lactone groups and strongly diminished carbonyl groups, and these changes were further emphasized upon treatment for 60 min (Figures 5b and S8).

Phenol-like, lactones, and carbonyl containing species present in the catalysts at high temperatures exhibit distinct stability during PDH. Atom coloring: C: gray, H: white, O: red.
By combining the information gathered from the different temperature-programed experiments, we hypothesize that the lower stability of phenol and lactone type groups during PDH could potentially result from their stoichiometric reaction with propane. The intrinsic presence of a proton in the phenol groups facilitates water formation, explaining the fast depletion (Figure 5c). The removal of carbonyl groups after prolonged exposure to propane could be caused by the creation of surface hydrides or hydroxyl groups via hydrogen abstraction from propane, which can recombine with active sites to evolve water, explaining the observed deactivation of PAC.
Conclusions
The synthesis of a platform of carbon catalysts with distinct properties permitted the determination of the impact of O and N dopants on their performance in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Insights into the heteroatom content and speciation gained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature-programed decomposition of surface functional groups coupled to porosity assessment revealed that several oxygen functionalities, including carbonyl, lactone, and phenol groups, could contribute to the activity. In contrast, nitrogen doping of activated carbons alone did not lead to an appreciable promotional effect. All catalysts evidenced progressive deactivation with time-on-stream, which could be related to the loss of active surface oxygen groups promoted by the presence of propane, as evidenced by monitoring the products evolved after pulsing propane. Due to the improved stability of oxygen species, polyaniline-derived carbons generally retained higher yields compared to activated carbons. The post-synthetic treatment of polyaniline with KOH before carbonization to boost the microporosity and oxygen content led to a remarkable six-fold enhanced stability compared to unmodified samples, linked to the introduction of abundant carbonyl groups that are more robust than other functionalities. These findings highlight the importance of controlling the speciation and local atomic structure of heteroatoms in carbons for advancing the design of metal-free catalysts for propylene production via propane dehydrogenation.
Experimental Section
Catalyst synthesis
A simplified scheme for the synthesis applied in this work is depicted in Figure 1. Polyaniline-derived carbons were prepared by the oxidative polymerization of aniline followed by carbonization in nitrogen atmosphere as adapted from a reported protocol.15 A precooled solution (277 K) of ammonium persulfate (114.1 g, 0.5 mol, Acros, 98 %) in deionized water (200 cm3) was mixed with a precooled solution (277 K) of aniline (47 cm3, 0.5 mol, Acros, 99.5 %) in deionized water (400 cm3, pH=0.4, adjusted with HCl (Sigma Aldrich, 37 %)). The resulting mixture was stirred for one hour kept at room temperature for 24 h to complete the polymerization. The precipitate was filtered and washed with deionized water until the pH was neutral. The resulting polymer was then dried in static air at 393 K for 12 h and carbonized at Tcarb=873 K, 1073 K, or 1273 K (heating rate 5 K min−1, 1 h) in static nitrogen. The resulting materials are referred to as PAC-873, PAC (Tcarb=1073 K), and PAC-1273. Two more materials, labeled PAC2 (0.25 mol ammonium persulfate, pH 3.5) and PAC3 (0.125 mol ammonium persulfate, pH 7.0) were synthesized following the same protocol (Tcarb=1073 K) but applying different amounts of oxidant and pH values during the polymerization. The synthesis of the KOH-treated samples PAC-K1 and PAC-K2 was also adapted from a literature procedure.17 A precooled solution (277 K) of ammonium persulfate (0.25 mol, Acros, 98 %) in deionized water (100 cm3) was mixed with a precooled solution (277 K) of aniline (0.5 mol, Acros, 99.5 %) and hydrochloric acid (1.25 M, 400 cm3) or phytic acid (0.1 mol, Tokyo Chemical Industry, in 200 cm3 of deionized water) were added for PAC-K1 and PAC-K2, respectively. The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h and kept at room temperature for 24 h to complete the polymerization. After washing with deionized water until the pH was neutral, the solid was dried at 373 K in vacuum for 12 h. The resulting polymer was pre-carbonized in static nitrogen at 673 K (heating rate 2 K min−1, 1 h), thoroughly mixed with a threefold amount of KOH (Fisher Chemical, 85.9 %) on a mass basis and carbonized again in static nitrogen at 1073 K (heating rate 5 K min−1, 1 h). After cooling, the samples were washed repeatedly with deionized water to remove residual KOH until the pH was neutral and finally dried in vacuum. Activated Carbon (Norit ROX 0.8) was heated at 1073 K (heating rate 5 K min−1, 12 h) in flowing nitrogen (20 cm3 STP min−1) prior to the catalytic tests and characterizations resulting in the sample referred to as AC. Activated carbons with distinct amounts of heteroatoms were synthesized following a previously reported doping procedure.29 Activated Carbon (Norit ROX 0.8, 10 g) was mixed with HNO3 (0.8 mol, diluted to 200 cm3, Sigma Aldrich,≥65 %). To obtain the sample labeled AC-O, the resulting slurry was stirred at 383 K for 16 h, filtered, washed with deionized water (1000 cm3 g−1), and finally dried at 338 K for 48 h. To synthesize nitrogen-doped carbon, AC-act (2 g) and dicyandiamide (6 g, 71 mol, Sigma Aldrich, 99 %) were dispersed in deionized water (40 cm3) and sonicated at 333 K for 1 h. The liquid was evaporated overnight at 353 K and the resulting solid was heated to 723 K (heating rate 5 K min−1, 2 h) and subsequently to 1023 K (heating rate 5 K min−1, 3 h) in flowing nitrogen (20 cm3 min−1). The resulting sample was labeled AC-N.
Characterization
Argon sorption at 77 K was measured using a Micrometrics 3Flex instrument. Samples (ca. 0.03 g) were evacuated to 0.1 mbar at 423 K for 12 h prior to the measurement. The specific surface area, SBET, was estimated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. The total pore volume, Vpore, was calculated at a relative pressure of p/p0=0.95. Raman spectroscopy was performed on a WITec CRM200 confocal Raman system using a 532 nm diode laser with 6 mW power and 5×25 s acquisition time, a 100× objective lens with numerical aperture NA=0.9 (Nikon Plan) and a fiber coupled grating spectrometer (2400 lines per mm), giving a spectral sampling resolution of 0.7 cm−1. For data evaluation the intensities were normalized by the highest observed intensity after subtraction of a linear background. The content of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen as well as that of oxygen were measured using a LECO TruSpec Micro and a LECO 628 Micro analyzers. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted in a Linseis STA PT 1600 instrument using an alumina crucible. The sample (ca. 20 mg) was heated to 1273 K (heating rate 10 K min−1) in 6 vol.% O2 in Ar atmosphere (300 cm3 STP min). To account for residual water adsorbed in the samples, the signal obtained at 423 K was set to zero. Transmission electron microscopy was performed using FEI Tecnai F30 or GrandARM JEOL JEM-ARM300F (electron gun: cold-field emitter) microscopes, which were both operated at an acceleration potential of 300 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured using a Physical Electronics Quatera SXM spectrometer, featuring monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV), generated from an electron beam operated at 15 kV and 49.3 W, acquiring data of a spot size of 200 μm. All samples were mounted onto the sample holder by pressing the finely ground powders onto indium foil (Alfa Aesar, 99.99 %). To suppress sample charging during analysis, an electron and an ion neutralizer were operated simultaneously. The residual pressure during measurements was below 5×10−8 Pa. For high-resolution spectra, pass energies of 55.00 eV were used. At these conditions, the full width at half maximum for the Ag 4f7/2 signal was 1.0 eV. The elemental concentrations were quantified based on the measured photoelectron peak areas (C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s) after Shirley background subtraction using the Casa XPS software and relative sensitivity factors provided by the manufacturer, which are corrected for the system transmission function. Temperature-programed decomposition and experiments with propane pulses were conducted in a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 machine equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and a Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320 O mass spectrometer (MS). In all analysis ca. 100 mg of catalyst was loaded into a U-shaped quartz reactor. For the treatments with propane pulses, as presented in Figure 5a, the sample was first heated to 873 K in He (20 cm3 STP min−1, heating rate 10 K min−1). Subsequently, while keeping the He flow, it was exposed to 20 pulses of propane (0.5 cm3 STP) in time intervals of τ=4 min while recording the MS signal. For the temperature-programed decomposition of oxygen-containing groups the sample was first dried in He (423 K, 30 cm3 STP min−1, PanGas, purity 4.6, heating rate 10 K min−1) and subsequently heated to 1273 K in He (20 cm3 STP min−1, heating rate 10 K min−1) while recording TCD and MS signals. For the measurements of samples pre-exposed with propane, as presented in Figures 5b and S8, instead of the drying step prior to analysis, the sample was heated to 873 K in He (20 cm3 STP min−1, heating rate 10 K min−1) for 30 min, exposed to the specified number of propane pulses (0.5 cm3) or time propane flow (PanGas, purity 2 .5, 10 cm3 STP min−1).
Catalyst tests
Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, PDH, was performed at ambient pressure in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor setup. The gases C3H8 (PanGas, purity >2 .5), Ar (PanGas, purity 5.0; internal standard), and He (PanGas, purity 4.6; carrier gas) were fed using digital mass-flow controllers (Bronkhorst®) to the mixing unit. A quartz reactor (internal diameter, di=8 mm) was typically loaded with the catalyst (weight, Wcat=0.5 g; particle size, dp=0.4–0.6 mm), and placed in a homemade electrical oven. Prior to testing, the bed was heated in a He flow to the desired temperature (T=873 K) and allowed to stabilize for at least 30 min before the reaction mixture was fed at desired total volumetric flow to achieve a space velocity of F/Wcat=6000 cm3 h−1 g−1. Silicon carbide (SiC) was tested at the same conditions as an inactive blank. Carbon-containing compounds (C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, and CH4) and Ar were quantified on-line via a gas chromatograph equipped with a GS-Carbon PLOT column coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS, Agilent GC 6890, Agilent MSD 5973 N). The conversion of propane in PDH, XC3H8, the selectivity, Sj, the yield, Yj, of product j (j: C3H6, C2H4, and CH4), and the error of the carbon mass balance, ϵC, were calculated using Equations (1)–(4), respectively, in which nC3H8inlet and nC3H8outlet are the molar flows of the propane at the reactor inlet and outlet, respectively, njoutlet is the molar flow of product j at the reactor outlet, and NC,C3H8 and NC,j are the number of carbon atoms in propane and in the compound j, respectively. The error of the carbon mass balance was less than 5 % in all experiments. Note that none of the reported selectivities Sj are normalized. The sum of selectivities towards observed products was 100±5 % in all tests, which is within experimental error. The deactivation coefficient was calculated according to Equation (5), where Xstart and Xt are the conversions at 0.08 h and 5 h time-on-stream, respectively.
