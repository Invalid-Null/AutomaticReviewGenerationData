 Unfortunately, the given extractions do not contain enough relevant details to generate a comprehensive summary related to propane dehydrogenation research. The extracts seem to focus on the dehydrogenation of higher alkanes like iso-pentane, n-pentane etc. and do not provide specifics on propane dehydrogenation to propylene. Since there is no pertinent information directly related to propane dehydrogenation, I am unable to populate the requested XML structure. The output is as follows:

<output>
  <Relevance>No</Relevance>

Based on the extracts provided, I could not find enough relevant details directly related to propane dehydrogenation research to synthesize a meaningful summary in the requested XML format. The extracts appear to be describing dehydrogenation of other alkanes and do not focus on propane dehydrogenation specifically. Please provide extracts with more relevant information on propane dehydrogenation if you need a summary in the requested XML structure.
