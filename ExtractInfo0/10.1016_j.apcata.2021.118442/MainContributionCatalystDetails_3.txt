 Unfortunately, this document does not appear to discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propaneation specifically. The focus seems to be on the dehydrogenation of higher carbon alkanes like iso-pentane, n-pentane, and n-butane to produce C4 and C5 olefins. No direct relevance to conversion of propane to propylene is indicated.
