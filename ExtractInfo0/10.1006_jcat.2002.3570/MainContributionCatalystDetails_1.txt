 Based on my analysis of the document, this does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for converting propane to propylene. The document discusses oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane on alumina-supported vanadia catalysts. It does not focus on propane dehydrogenation specifically.
