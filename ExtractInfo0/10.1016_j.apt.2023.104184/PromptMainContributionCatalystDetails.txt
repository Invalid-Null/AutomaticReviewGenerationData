Abstract
Industrial ZSM-5 catalysts suffer from coke deposition and loss of activity in methanol to propylene conversion. Developing zeolites with a better diffusion path, which is essential for the design of high-efficiency catalysts, is still a challenge to be achieved. The synthesis of seed-induced ZSM-5 zeolite with a short diffusion path could be a solution to reduce coke accommodation and have a higher catalytic lifetime. However, it would not be beneficial with current methods as far as the industrial aspect. Herein, we have proposed a successful and industrially-feasible approach for decreasing the costs of seed-induced ZSM-5 synthesis as well as improving the lifetime and catalytic performance of ZSM-5 zeolites in the methanol to propylene (MTP) reaction. This modified seeding route includes a physical factor (ball milling) and a chemical factor (alkaline treatment). Compared to a conventional seed-induced route, this new technique allowed us to increase catalyst lifetime (from 159 h to 265 h), propylene/ethylene selectivity (from 5.23 to 8.19), and amount of produced propylene per gram of catalyst (from 182
to 443
). This modified seed has a high potential for use on an industrial scale, based on the results.

1. Introduction
In the petrochemical industry, light olefins such as propylene are the key building blocks for the production of many petrochemical derivatives such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, isopropyl alcohol, acrylonitrile, cumene, and phenol. Nowadays, various processes such as propylene recovery from refineries, propane dehydrogenation, and natural gas or coal conversion to propylene via methanol are employed for propylene production. However, due to the growing demand for propylene derivatives (especially polypropylene) and the rapid reduction of oil resources, new processes with a high yield of propylene from non-petroleum resources have attracted significant attention. Among all of these processes, the Methanol to propylene (MTP) process developed by Lurgi has gathered momentum in recent years because of the accessible and economical nature of methanol.
It is well known that the choice of a suitable catalyst is the most important issue in a catalytic process like MTP [1], [2]. Based on its unique channel structure, excellent thermal stability, high selectivity towards propylene, and coke resistance, high silica H-ZSM-5 zeolite has been recognized as the preferred catalyst for the MTP process. Despite these superior properties, enhancing the resistance to deactivation of ZSM-5 due to coke deposition is still an ongoing challenge in the petrochemical processes [3], [4]. Deactivation mainly occurs because of the presence of micropores in the ZSM-5 structure along with the strong acidity of ZSM-5 [5], [6]. Moreover, the long diffusion path of conventional ZSM-5 often causes diffusion limitations, extending the contact time of the produced aromatics with the active acid sites, resulting in coke formation. Earlier works have demonstrated that diffusion can be improved by introducing mesopores into the structure, post-synthesis modifications, and synthesis of nano-sized zeolites [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19].
Seeding is a cost-effective and eco-friendly method for manufacturing zeolites with well-controlled structures by accelerating the nucleation step [12], [20], [21]. Compared with the conventional ZSM-5 catalysts, the catalytic performance of seed-induced ZSM-5 has dramatically improved and indicated the advantages of easier diffusion [9], [13], [22], [23]. In a typical seed-induced synthesis of ZSM-5, different types of seed could be applied but mainly silicalite-1 zeolite with MFI topology has been used due to the simplicity of the reaction system and the absence of alumina and inorganic cations [24], [25]. However, its long synthesis time and high cost of synthesis have restricted industrial applications, so several measures should be taken to modify the seeding method [12], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30].
Although different zeolites can be prepared by template-free methods, at least a source of silica and a template of tetrapropyl ammonium (TPA) salts are usually needed to synthesize silicalite-1 [31]. Tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide (TPAOH), one of the quaternary ammonium hydroxides, is a conventional structure-directing agent (SDA) for the synthesis of silicalite-1 but considering that the product cost of the TPAOH is exceptionally high and had reached up to ∼ 420 $/kg, it could be substituted by a cheaper SDA like Tetrapropyl ammonium bromide (TPABr) [32]. Nevertheless, the substitution of TPABr instead of TPAOH might result in a large particle size which affects the catalytic performance of primary seed-induced zeolite due to higher diffusion limitation [4], [5], [6]. Also, it is well known smaller crystals are more appropriate for the seeding of synthesis gels [33].
In searching for an industrially applicable solution, Xing [34] and co-workers prepared nanosheet-like ZSM-5, in which two kinds of calcined seeds after ball milling (dry milling) were added to the initial gel. It was found that ball-milled seeds showed better catalytic activity for the MTP reaction than untreated seeds as a result of their higher surface area, which provided more entry and diffusion paths for the reactants to reach the active sites. In another approach, Chen [9] and co-workers used various alkali-treated calcined seeds, including nano-sized ZSM-5 aggregates and commercial bulk ZSM-5 zeolites in the seed-induced synthesis of ZSM-5 catalysts. Some insightful results were obtained, but the catalytic performance improved less significantly.
To overcome the disadvantages of conventional synthesis, we recommend a facile and economic approach for seed-induced ZSM-5 synthesis considering high catalytic lifetime and propylene selectivity. In the present study, the synthesis of silicalite-1 seed was performed in a shorter crystallization time then the composition of reactant gel was optimized to reduce the particle size. Although seeding has been established for a long time, adjusting the size of the seeds could optimize the zeolite's properties and enhance its catalytic performance. In the present work, two factors were introduced for improving seeding technique; a physical factor (ball milling) and a chemical factor (alkaline treatment). Using the combination of mentioned factors, it is expected that the prepared seeds would have a decreased particle size and enhanced solubility, which is favorable for the synthesis of zeolites. Textural properties (reduction in diffusion pathway) and acidity (desirable acidity towards MTP reaction) were found to be affected by this modified seeding technique. Also, compared with conventional seed-induced zeolite (159 h, 5.23, 33%), it could increase catalyst lifetime (159 to 291 h), propylene/ethylene ratio (5.23 to 8.19) and propylene selectivity (33% to 44%). This research has focused on finding an efficient seed-induced catalyst with an industrial-feasible route to increase propylene selectivity and catalyst lifetime. Over the past years, our group has investigated the different routes for modifying ZSM-5 zeolite to obtain an efficient catalyst for MTP reaction [12], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41]. This work is part of an extensive effort to prepare a suitable ZSM-5 catalyst for the methanol conversion to light olefins, especially with high propylene selectivity on a commercial scale, implemented by the Petrochemical Research and Technology Company.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All the reagents, including sodium aluminate (NaAlO2, Al2O3, 55 wt%), silicic acid (SiO2·xH2O, ≥ 99 wt%), ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3, 99 wt%), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 99 wt%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 99.6 wt%), boric acid (H3BO3, 99.8 wt%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98 wt%), Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 40 wt%), and tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr, ≥ 99 wt%) were purchased from Merck Company (Germany).
2.2. Silicalite-1 synthesis
The silicalite-1[Br] samples were prepared with different amounts of the reactants (SiO2: X Na2O: Y TPABr: Z H2O) to investigate the effect of compositions and synthesis conditions on particle size. In the first step, the solution of NaOH, and deionized water was stirred. Coincidentally, we added TPABr and silicic acid. After being stirred for 8 h at room temperature, the gel was transferred into a Teflon-lined steel autoclave and crystallized at different conditions as shown in Table S3 (Temperature and time). After cooling, obtained silicalite-1[Br] suspensions were used for further investigation. All of the experiments are listed as shown in Table S3.
For comparison, conventional silicalite-1[OH] was also synthesized according to the literature [22]. The molar composition of the synthesis mixture was TEOS: 0.36 TPAOH: 19 H2O. After being stirred for 12 h at room temperature, the gel was transferred into a Teflon-lined steel autoclave and crystallized at 80 °C for 72 h. After cooling, obtained silicalite-1 suspension was directly used without any purification.
2.3. Catalyst preparation
The H-ZSM-5 zeolites with a Si/Al ratio of 200 were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis according to the following procedures. Silicalite-1[OH] and silicalite-1[Br] were used for the seed-induced synthesis of H-ZSM-5. The abbreviation between brackets represents the used structure-directing agents in the seeding mixture. OH, and Br represents TPAOH and TPABr, respectively.
2.3.1. Seed-induced synthesis with silicalite-1[OH] and silicalite-1[Br]
First, solution A was prepared as a mixture of NaOH, NaAlO2, boric acid, TPABr, and distilled water. Silicic acid, NaOH, and distilled water composed solution B. Solution A was added to solution B by drop-wise addition, and the seed was gradually added for 2 h under vigorous stirring. Sulfuric acid was used to adjust the gel pH. The molar ratio of the starting gel was 20 SiO2: 0.05 Al2O3: 3 TPABr: 1.511 Na2O: 0.025 B2O3: 200 H2O: 8 seed (wt%). Two kinds of seeds were added to the reaction mixture and the additional quantity of seed typically equals 8.0 wt% of the total SiO2 weight in starting gel. Sulfuric acid was used to adjust the gel pH. Crystallization was carried out at 170 °C under autogenous pressure for 48 h with continuous stirring (450 rpm) in a stainless-steel autoclave. The resultant solid was recovered by filtration, washed several times with deionized water until the pH value of the decanted water reached 7, and then dried overnight at 105 °C. The catalyst was calcined to remove the organic template in a muffle furnace under airflow at 530 °C for 12 h at a heating rate of 3 °C/min. Finally, the solid powder was ion-exchanged with 1 mol/L NH4NO3 solution at 90 °C for 10 h under continuous agitation, followed by filtration and washing. This procedure was repeated four times to obtain NH4-ZSM-5 zeolite. After drying at 105 °C for 24 h, the NH4-ZSM-5 zeolite was calcined at 530 °C for 12 h to obtain the H-form of the zeolite. Samples produced with silicalite-1[OH] and silicalite-1[Br] were named HZ-OH and HZ, respectively. The resulting powder was formed by tableting, and then 16–25 mesh catalyst was made by crushing and sieving for catalytic evaluation in the reactor.
2.3.2. Modified seed-induced synthesis with alkali-treated silicalite-1[Br]
To perform the alkaline treatment of the seed, the calculated amounts of NaAlO2 and NaOH were dissolved in a certain amount of H2O in a round-bottom flask. After stirring for 5 min, silicalite-1[Br] was added to the clear solution. Subsequently, the mixture was heated to 70 °C under stirring and reflux and kept at this temperature for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the calculated amount of TPABr was gradually added to the mixture under stirring for 80 min. Then, the mixture was stirred for 60 min, and after that boric acid was added to the mixture under stirring to tune the acidity of ZSM-5 [12], [41]. Finally, silicic acid was added to the suspension very slowly under fast stirring for 90 min and the mixture was stirred for 60 min at room temperature. The molar ratio of the synthesis gel was 20 SiO2: 0.05 Al2O3: 3 TPABr: 1.511 Na2O: 0.025 B2O3: 200 H2O: 8 seed (wt%). The following procedure was the same as that described above. The sample was named HZ-AT.
2.3.3. Modified seed-induced synthesis with ball-milled and alkali-treated silicalite-1[Br]
Ball milling of seed was performed using a planetary ball mill (PM100; Retsch Corporation). Milling was performed in a 250 ml Teflon jar at 400 rpm for 2 h. Because of the strong alkalinity of seed suspension, steel balls were not suitable for wet millings. Zirconia balls of 5 mm were used instead. A certain amount of seed suspension and balls in wet milling were placed in the jar at room temperature and atmospheric pressure then sealed and imposed to milling. The milling process was optimized concerning size reduction, and milling parameters such as rotational speed, and grinding time (see Supplementary Information). The ball-milled silicalite-1[Br] was directly used in the synthesis procedure without any purification. The synthesis procedure was the same as that described previous section. The sample was named HZ-B-AT. The overall procedures for two different preparation methods are summarized in Fig. 1 for a better understanding.

2.4. Characterization
The particle size distribution (PSD) and mean particle size were calculated using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 equipped with a detector collecting scattered light at 90°. When the zeolite particles are dispersed in a solvent, the mean particle size of the zeolite particles is defined by the median diameter (d50) in a particle size distribution measurement obtained by the dynamic light scattering method [42]. The obtained suspension-form samples were sent for particle size distribution (PSD) analysis immediately to reduce agglomeration possibility. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was used to recognize the type of zeolite formed and the crystallinity of the samples. XRD patterns of these samples were collected by a Bruker d8 advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the 2θ range of 5°–80° at the rate of 2°/min. The crystalline phases were determined using Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standard (JCPDS) files. The morphology of H-ZSM-5 samples was examined using a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM Model: MIRA3 TESCAN, USA) operating at 15 kV. Particle size was determined randomly via ImageJ, but discrete particles were only chosen and some unusually large particles (in HZ and HZ-AT sample) were avoided due to strong agglomeration. In the SEM images, 50 discrete particles were counted randomly to determine the size distribution of ZSM-5 zeolites.
The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the samples were collected on a Bruker Vertex80 spectrometer with a resolution of 4 cm−1 for addressing surface functional groups. The textural properties of the catalysts were measured using N2 adsorption–desorption technique at 77 K on a NOVA 2000 Quanta Chrome USA instrument in the relative pressure range from 0.05 to 0.99. Before measurement, all the samples were evacuated at 300 °C under N2 flow for 3 hr. The conventional Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) equation was used to calculate the specific surface area (Stotal) from the linear part of the plot according to IUPAC recommendations (adsorption data in P/P0 = 0.05–0.25) [43]. The total pore volume (Vtotal) was based on the nitrogen adsorbed volume at p/p0 = 0.99. The micropore area (Smicro) and micropore volume (Vmicro) were calculated from the t-plot curve at a thickness range between 3.5 and 5.4 Å. The mesopore size distribution was calculated using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method on the adsorption branch of the isotherm. The mesopore volume (Vmeso) is the difference between the calculated total volume and the corresponding micropore volume. The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) for the prepared catalysts was carried out with a conventional flow apparatus (BELCAT-A, BEL Japan, Inc.) to determine the surface acidity of various catalysts. A 35 mg of sample was loaded in the U- tube. Before adsorption, the samples were initially degassed under He flow at 300 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. After cooling to 60 °C, the sample was saturated with ammonia for 1 h. After saturation, the sample was purged with helium for 30 min to remove the physically adsorbed ammonia on the surface of the catalyst. The temperature of the sample was then raised at a heating rate of 5 °C/min from 35 to 850 °C. The amount of ammonia desorbed from the catalyst was measured by comparing the TPD areas with that of a standard sample using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
2.5. Catalytic performance tests
The performance of all prepared catalysts for the methanol to propylene (MTP) reaction was investigated in a fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor (450 mm length, 11 mm I.D., S.S. 316) under atmospheric pressure at 480 °C. There is a schematic outline of the experimental set-up constituted of a liquid/gas feeding part, a fixed bed reactor, and an analysis part in the Supplementary Information (Fig.S11). A temperature-controlled three-zone furnace supplied the constant temperature to the entire reactor. A K-type thermocouple probe was placed in the center of the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature. In each run, 4 g of catalyst (mesh size: 16–25) was loaded in the middle section of the reactor tube and a mixture of 90 wt% methanol in water was pumped into the catalyst bed by a WellChrom HPLC K-120 pump to provide a methanol WHSV of 8 h−1. Before the catalytic activity measurements, the sample was activated in situ, with a heating rate of 3 °C/min under highly purified N2 flow at 300 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, the nitrogen gas flow was stopped and the mixture of methanol and water was injected from the feed tank into the pre-heater. To prevent any product condensation, external heating was performed on the transfer line from the reactor outlet to the separator vessel inlet, and the temperature was kept constant at 120 °C. On-line testing of gas-phase was carried out by the micro-GC (Varian CP-4900) equipped with a TCD detector, where four channels were utilized to separate the products [(CH4, C2-C5 olefin/paraffin, DME, C6-cut) and (H2, CO, and CO2)]. The bottom stream in two aqueous and organic phases was separated. The separated aqueous phase of the liquid product was analyzed by an off-line gas chromatograph of Varian CP-3800 equipped with FID and TCD detectors, where a CP-Wax52CB column was utilized to separate the components (methanol and water). The organic phase was also analyzed with the offline gas chromatograph of Varian CP-3800 equipped with an FID detector, in which a PIONA column was utilized to separate the components (C6-C16 hydrocarbons). Then the reaction performance results, namely methanol/DME conversion and hydrocarbon products selectivity were carried out. As the equilibrium reaction of methanol to DME occurred very rapidly, for the conversion and hydrocarbon products selectivity calculations, those two species could be combined into one lumped reactant species (oxygenates). Hence, the calculation related to the conversion of methanol/DME in the MTP reaction was carried out as follows (Eq. (1):

The product selectivity was denoted as the mole ratio of each of the products (based on CH2), thereinafter signified as the moles of converted methanol (Eq. (2):

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthetic parameters of silicalite-1[Br]
3.1.1. Effect of synthesis time and temperature
It is believed that crystallization time and temperature are important parameters in the synthesis of zeolites and could affect particle size [22], [44]. For the first set of experiments (S-1 to S-7), silicalite-1 synthesis was carried out using different crystallization conditions as listed in Table S3. As shown in Fig.S1, the PSD figure became wider and the maximum peak for every graph was shifted to the lower particle sizes with increasing temperature and reducing time. It was concluded that S-6 and S-7 samples had a better variation of particle size than the S-1 sample. A higher temperature may ignore the effect of time variation on the particle size of zeolite because its crystal growth rate is faster, meaning a faster crystallization time [30], [45]. Also, studies show that longer crystallization times lead to larger particles [24], [46], [47]. Hence, high temperatures can reduce the long synthesis time of silicalite-1 zeolites. It is consistent with previous studies examining the effects of crystallization time and temperature on silicalite-1 particle size. Dai et al. [22] and Song et al. [46] reported that by increasing crystallization temperature and decreasing crystallization time, the mean particle size of samples reduces, and more uniform particles are obtained.
The short-cylinder shape morphology aggregates can be observed in S-6 and S-7 samples (Fig.S2). The S-7 has a slightly better particle size distribution with a smaller mean particle size. The XRD patterns of samples with different crystallization conditions showed that these samples have a perfect crystalline structure as shown in Fig.S3. These silicalite-1 samples containing the tetrapropylammonium cation exhibited an orthorhombic symmetry as shown by the single reflection at 24.4° 2θ angle which implied silicalite-1 was successfully crystallized [29], [48]. It can be observed that the intensities of the silicalite-1 peaks increase with increasing crystallization temperature and decreasing crystallization time. This higher intensity might be due to the faster dissolution of the reactants in the initial gel and thus, rapid crystalline structure growth.
3.1.2. Effect of SDA amount
Based on previous studies, there is a clear relationship between the mean particle size of silicalite-1 and the SDA amount [24]. After the determination of optimum crystallization temperature and time (180 °C and 6 h), silicalite-1 samples (S-8 to S-13) were prepared with different TPABr contents to optimize the SDA content, and the following molar composition was employed: 1 SiO2: 0.15 Na2O: y TPABr: 20 H2O where TPABr content varied from 0.15 to 0.45. After synthesis, mother liquor from samples presented two states: a clear solution or a milky solution, except sample S-13 which exhibited some insoluble residues. Thus, it was concluded that silicalite-1 suspension cannot be obtained with a high TPABr/SiO2 ratio (>0.4). As shown in Fig.S4, the PSD figure was shifted to the left and exhibited smaller particle sizes by increasing the SDA amount. Moreover, the mean particle size of samples with increasing TPABr/SiO2 ratio from 0.15 up to 0.35 reduced from 10.94 µm to 2.54 µm but further increasing had a negative effect on particle size, so the particles grew again. It has been reported that a lower concentration of TPA+ appears to reduce the possibility of nuclei forming [49]. Accordingly, there appears to be an optimum SDA concentration needed to obtain silicalite-1 with the smallest particle size. The same has been observed by Persson et al. [24]. In order to complete a successful seed-induced synthesis, small-sized seed particles are essential. This can both lessen the amount of SDA and lower the subsequent costs associated with the calcination process, as well as decrease air pollution caused by the burning of organic materials. It is known that not only the size but also the surface structure of particles is influenced by TPA+ content in the starting composition [25], [30]. Thus, different morphologies of samples by changing the SDA content will not be surprising. As shown in Fig.S5, low TPABr contents (less than 0.35) result in large and distinct particles whereas higher TPABr contents (>0.35) lead to small and uniform particles with smooth surfaces. The SEM images confirmed the results of the PSD analysis. The XRD patterns of samples with different SDA contents showed that these samples have a perfect crystalline structure as shown in Fig.S6.
3.1.3. Effect of water content and alkalinity
Silicalite-1 suspensions (S-14 to S-22) were prepared with different Na2O and H2O contents and the following molar composition: 1SiO2: x Na2O: 0.35TPABr: z H2O where Na2O and H2O contents varied from 0.1 to 0.2 and 10 to 30, respectively. S-14, S-15, S-16, and S-20 samples had some insoluble residues, which demonstrated the failure to obtain a crystalline structure. As shown in Fig.S7, the PSD figure was shifted to the right and exhibited larger particle sizes by increasing the water content and decreasing the Na2O content. Moreover, the mean particle size of samples with increasing H2O/SiO2 ratio from 20 up to 30 increased from 2.54 µm to 16.29 µm. Similar to the PSD results, SEM figures (Fig.S8) showed that the samples exhibited larger particle sizes by increasing water content in the initial gel. The increase of batch alkalinity (Na2O/H2O) increases the solubility of gel during hydrothermal treatment and thus, the concentration of nutrients in the liquid phase, needed for nucleation and crystal growth. This indicates that the decrease in the size of silicalite-1 is not caused by their dissolution but by the increasing number of nuclei. Fig.S9 showed the XRD patterns of samples. All the samples exhibited high relative crystallinity, indicative of the high purity of the obtained samples. An important factor in the synthesis of silicalite-1 is the “batch alkalinity” as listed in Table S3. An increase in particle size for samples with low alkalinity of 0.005 and 0.006 is due to the deposition of the amorphous phase on the surface of growing crystals, and the aggregation phenomenon [30], [50]. A further increase in alkalinity up to 0.0075 led to the disappearance of the agglomerates but for higher alkalinity of 0.008, aggregation phenomena were observed again. It can be concluded that there is an optimum for Na2O/H2O ratio which caused the production of more nuclei and a reduction of particle size.
3.2. Comparative study of seed-induced ZSM-5 samples
3.2.1. Crystallinity and morphology
The crystalline phase of the resulting samples was identified by XRD. The samples all present the characteristic diffraction peaks for the typical structure of MFI topology, and no impure or amorphous phase was detected suggesting that they are successfully synthesized. The intensity of diffraction peaks between 22.5 and 25° was reduced when the seed size decreased through ball milling and alkaline treatment. In addition, HZ-B-AT displayed much broader peaks at a 2θ range of 22.5 − 25°; similar results can be found in the HZ-AT sample. These results were consistent with the results reported by Xing et al. [34] and Hou et al. [51]. Through ball milling and alkaline treatment operations, seed particles are fragmented and will lead to more active sites for the formation of nuclei. Thus, a much larger number of nuclei will be in the seeding mixture [52]. On the other hand, the ball milling and alkaline treatment slightly reduced the crystallinity of the zeolite since it can be seen from the decreasing intensity of the peaks.
SEM images in Fig. 3 display the morphology of the ZSM-5 particles prepared through the seed-induced method. HZ sample synthesized with silicalite-1 seed presents a strong agglomeration of particles. In contrast to that, both samples HZ-AT and HZ-B-AT exhibited almost similar morphologies but slightly different sizes in which the particles with small fragmentations are obtained. A better distribution of particles was observed which may be due to the alkaline treatment effect and inhibiting the aggregation. Fig. 2 shows that using post-treated seed results in smaller zeolite particles since more nuclei exist in crystallization media for growing the zeolite. This observation is in agreement with the literature [9]. Chen and co-workers observed that through breaking bulk seed into nanocrystals by NaOH, more nuclei are formed.

3.2.2. Framework analysis and textural properties
The FTIR was performed on all samples. As can be seen from Fig. 4, all of the samples displayed unique adsorption bands of the ZSM-5 structure near 450, 550, 800, 1120, and 1225 cm−1. The band near 450 cm−1 represents internal SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedron units. Moreover, the band around 550 cm−1 confirms the ZSM-5 structure formation with five-membered rings [53]. Special bands in the FTIR spectrum of H-ZSM-5 zeolites originated from the incorporation of boron into the zeolite framework and the spectrum of the synthesized samples showed all these bands clearly, indicating that B atoms of H-ZSM-5 have been incorporated into the framework in combination with Si. The band at 670 cm−1 is assigned to the symmetric bending vibration of the Si-O-B band. Furthermore, the bands in the region 1100–1300 cm−1 are attributed to the B–O asymmetric stretching vibration [41], [54]. The weak peak at 1385 cm−1 is assigned to a trigonally coordinated framework boron [54]. The SDA existence can be detected by the C–H stretching absorption bands at 2880–2980 cm−1. The weak bands indicate the appropriate and acceptable calcination process which agrees with the literature [55]. FT-IR spectra of these samples in the range of 3500–4000 cm−1 were used for detecting silanol groups (Si-OH). HZ-AT and HZ-B-AT show a reduced 3745 cm−1 band, corresponding to isolated silanol groups on the external surface. In addition, the broadband at 3500 cm−1, which could be attributed to the internal Si-OH groups is also reduced, indicating that alkaline treatment of seed can significantly eliminate the defects sites that were present in the ZSM-5 samples.

Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and corresponding BJH pore size distribution curves of all samples are displayed in Fig. 5, and specific textural properties are listed in Table 1. The HZ-OH sample exhibits a type-I isotherm with a micropore structure, according to the IUPAC classification. However, the adsorption isotherms of HZ, HZ-AT, and HZ-B-AT samples were a combination of type-I and IV isotherms with clear H4 hysteresis loops at P/P0 range of 0.1–0.3 and 0.45–––0.99. The high-pressure hysteresis loop suggesting the presence of abundant mesoporous structure in the samples, which gives higher BET surface area [8], [56]. On the other hand, low-pressure hysteresis loop might be ascribed to fewer defect sites in the framework, small mesopores or intraparticle voids inside the zeolite [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62].

The micropore surface area (SMicro) of samples with alkali-treated seeds (262 m2.g−1 for HZ-AT, 252 m2.g−1 for HZ-B-AT) increased compared to the HZ sample (229 m2.g−1), indicating that zeolite was more structured and defect-free by using of the alkali-treated form of silicalite-1[Br] [34]. The observations are in agreement with the FTIR results and illustrate the impact of alkaline treatment on internal silanol group reduction. In addition, the specific surface area (385 m2.g−1) and mesopore volume (0.102 cm3.g−1) of the HZ-B-AT sample are larger than those of the HZ-OH (372 m2.g−1, 0.072 cm3.g−1). A larger mesopore volume facilitates molecular diffusion and therefore can delay the deactivation.
Pore size distribution curves (Fig. 5b) showed that all samples synthesized with optimum designed silicalite-1, HZ, HZ-AT, and HZ-B-AT, contained a bimodal pore structure: (1) a relatively narrow pore size distribution (∼2 nm) and (2) a broad pore size distribution (4–30 nm), which are derived from the intercrystalline pore structure and interparticle pore structure, respectively. A broad pore size distribution was developed in ZSM-5 after the alkaline treatment, which might be related to defects in the structure. In this study, the hierarchy factor (HF) was used for a qualitative comparison of the samples, in terms of textural properties. This factor is an appropriate tool, defined as (VMicro/VTotal) × (SMeso/SBET), to describe the porosity of hierarchically structured zeolites. It was reported that HF less than 0.1 is attributed to conventional microporous materials, and HF > 0.15 is attributed to hierarchically structured materials [63]. As listed in Table 1, our results are completely matched with these ranges.
3.2.3. Acidic properties
Acidity plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance of catalysts in the MTP reaction [64]. Catalyst weak acid sites contribute to the initial reactivity of methanol as well as alkylation and methylation reactions which highly influence propylene selectivity based on the dual-cycle concept [41], [65]. “Dual-cycle” is attributed to the two mechanistic cycles which run simultaneously during the MTP reaction over ZSM-5: ethylene and aromatics are formed via polymethylbenzenes (aromatic-based cycle), whereas propylene and higher alkenes are obtained mainly by alkene methylation and cracking (olefin-based cycle) [66], [67], [68]. It should be noted that high weak acidity efficiently avoids various hydrogen-transfer reactions that produce aromatics while strong acidity provides the main active sites for hydrocarbon production but it also enhances coke formation and catalyst deactivation [69], [70]. It was reported that the acidity of the zeolite may be affected by using the seed-induced synthesis method [12], [21]. Aluminum species of aluminosilicate gel cannot be completely incorporated into ZSM-5 zeolite because of fast crystal growth attributed to the presence of seeds in the synthesis medium. Hence, seed-induced ZSM-5 catalysts have excellent acidity adjustment including no extreme strong acidity and moderate acid density which is suitable for MTP conversion [52], [71].
The amount and strength of the acid sites of the seed-induced ZSM-5 zeolites were examined by NH3-TPD measurements. Their corresponding curves and the derived acidity data are listed in Fig. 6 and Table 2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, all catalysts represent a similar pattern of NH3-TPD profile, and two desorption peaks can be observed, a low-temperature peak (TP1) at around 170–195 °C and a high-temperature peak (TP2) at around 380–400 °C corresponding to weak/medium and strong/medium acid sites, respectively. H-ZSM-5 zeolites synthesized with different seeds have different acid properties in strength, and their acid amounts are different. HZ-OH (0.078 m.mol/g) has less weak acid amount than HZ-Br (0.095 m.mol/g) due to the weak adsorption for NH3 to Si − OH in structural defects but their strong acid amounts are quite similar (0.091 m.mol/g for HZ-OH and 0.099 m.mol/g for HZ). It was observed that alkaline treatment of seed could reduce weak acid sites (0.11 m.mol/g for HZ-AT) and has a low impact on strong acid sites (0.085 m.mol/g for HZ-AT) while the co-effect of ball milling and alkaline treatment could greatly decrease strong acid sites (0.03 m.mol/g for HZ-B-AT) as well as weak acid sites (0.034 m.mol/g for HZ-B-AT). Compared with HZ (157 °C), HZ-B-AT (sample with ball-milled and alkali-treated seed) exhibit slight shifts toward lower temperatures (143 °C) for the high-temperature desorption peak (second peak), which indicates that acid sites have become weaker after these treatments. HZ-AT (sample with alkali-treated seed) showed a similar trend but with a smaller shift (154 °C). It may be attributed to eliminated structural defects due to the alkaline treatment of seed and reduced seed particle size due to the co-effect of ball milling and alkaline treatment. These results are consistent with other studies highlighting the effect of particle size and structural defects on zeolite acidity [3], [12], [72].

It should be noted that a greater density of strong acid sites favors the formation of coke, which is the direct cause of catalyst deactivation [73], [74]. Moreover, a significant decrease in the acid site density and acid strength inhibits the aromatization and hydrogen transfer reactions [34]. Therefore, decreased amounts of strong acid sites on the zeolite would be desirable to prolong the lifetime and improve the propylene yield in the MTP reaction. Reduced strength acidity could lead to a slower deactivation rate, especially for HZ-B-AT.
3.3. Catalytic performance
To quickly evaluate the catalytic activities, MTP reactions over catalysts were carried out with WHSV of 8 h−1, much higher than the one used in industry (∼1h−1). The catalyst lifetime in a normal industrial WHSV is therefore longer. As an example, these sample could be active for over 1500 h in WHSVs of 1, but for this study, higher WHSV was chosen to test the samples under aggressive conditions. The conversion of methanol/DME (oxygenates) is presented as a function of time on stream (TOS) for the three catalysts in Fig. 7a. There is a sudden decrease in the activity of the HZ and HZ-OH. Several factors could lead to such a sudden drop in activity, including high acidity (the ratio of strong acid sites to weak acid sites > 1) and long diffusion paths, both of which lead to increased coke accommodation.

Fig. 7b, Fig. 7c, and Fig. 7d display the selectivity of propylene, ethylene, and total heavy hydrocarbons over catalysts as a function of TOS, respectively. In the beginning, the selectivities to propylene were increased slightly with TOS, whereas the opposite trend was observed for ethylene, which corresponds with the “hydrocarbon-pool” mechanism [75], [76]. It is because that ethylene and butene can oligomerize to bigger oligomers through metathesis, which cracks to form propylene. With prolonged TOS, the deactivation stage occurred, and the propylene selectivity for all catalysts was decreased slowly while the production of heavier hydrocarbons was increased as can be seen in Fig. 6d. It can be attributed to the coverage of acid sites and blockage of the pore mouth by the coke deposit which influences product distribution in long-term reactions [13], [23].
Table 3 lists the average product distribution measured during lifetime of catalysts (the time between the start of an experiment and when the methanol conversions dropped below 90%). The products obtained are classified into light hydrocarbons (C1–C4), light olefins (C2=-C4=), and C5+ hydrocarbons. HZ, HZ-AT, and HZ-B-AT represent lower selectivity to C5+ heavy hydrocarbons (19.68%, 20.87%, and 20.67%, respectively) compared to HZ-OH (36.29%). This can be related to the high external surface area of these samples which leads to a shorter diffusion path length. Therefore, a shorter residence time of reactants in the structural pores of these samples results in less formation of C5+ heavy hydrocarbon products. The small pore size of the catalyst hinders large components from leaving and so enhances cracking reactions, whereas the large surface area enhances the desorption of light hydrocarbons. Hence, the experimental results agree with the BET data.

In this study, the C4 Hydrogen Transfer Index (C4-HTI) was also used to evaluate the catalytic performance of catalysts in MTP reactions. This parameter is defined as the ratio between the yields of butane (n-C4 and i-C4) and the total yield of C4 hydrocarbons (n-C4, i-C4, and total C4=) which announce the progress of the hydrogen transfer reactions over the ZSM-5 catalysts [77], [78]. Therefore, a high value of C4-HTI indicates extensive aromatization and cyclization reactions along with high alkane generation. In contrast, it was reported that a low value of C4-HTI will favor more olefin production, as the most likely hydrocarbon pool species, in the methanol to olefin conversion [77], [79]. As shown in Fig. 8a, the continuous trend of C4-HTI confirms the high resistance against carbon deposition on the HZ-B-AT catalyst while the decreasing trend of C4-HTI suggests the reduction of acid density with coke deposition on HZ and HZ-OH catalysts which inhibits hydrogen transfer and cyclization reactions. These observations are in agreement with the literature [75]. Bjørgen and co-workers observed that the C4-HTI decreases with loss of activity for all their samples.

Moreover, Fig. 9 shows that the HZ-OH sample with high strong acid sites has a higher C4-HTI value (0.11) which leads to extensive aromatization and cyclization reactions along with high alkane generation. C4-HTI values are lower in HZ-AT (0.06) and HZ-B-AT (0.04) samples with less strong acid sites. This observation can be explained by the NH3-TPD results for this sample due to a high number of weak and moderate acid sites which result in reducing the hydrogen transfer reactions over the samples in the MTP reaction. Thus, there is no doubt that seed treatments have an effect. The propylene/ethylene ratio (P/E) was the highest for the HZ-B-AT catalyst (8.19). It might be due to the co-effect of ball milling and alkaline treatment, which resulted in the reduction of particle size, number, and strength of strong acid sites (Table 2). Therefore, appropriate concentration and strength of acid sites favor the alkene route in the “dual-cycle” mechanism, which produces propylene and avoids various hydrogen-transfer reactions producing aromatics [34], [80]. In this study, the HZ-B-AT catalyst, synthesized with silicalite-1[Br], not only exhibits the longest catalytic lifetime (291 h) among all samples but also shows a further continuous decrease in ethylene selectivity than the others. So, it maintains a stable formation of propylene for a longer period and shows a continuous increase in P/E ratio than other catalysts, demonstrating the advantage of simultaneous ball milling and alkaline treatment of seed. In contrast, the HZ-OH catalyst, synthesized with silicalite-1[OH], shows the shortest catalyst lifetime (159 h) and lowest propylene selectivity (33.79 %) among the catalysts. It could be attributed to the high strong/weak acid site ratio as well as large particle size, which is confirmed by the former XRD and FE-SEM results.

In this study, the “amount of methanol processed at lifetime per gram of zeolite catalyst (g/gcat)” (named hereafter AMeOH) and “amount of propylene produced at lifetime per gram of zeolite catalyst (g/gcat) by the processed methanol” (named hereafter APropylene) were used for a qualitative comparison of the samples, in terms of catalytic performance. The imperative for elucidating A parameter arises from the concurrent significance accorded to the longevity of the catalyst and the yield of propylene, both of which assume critical importance within the realm of MTP reaction catalysis. The catalyst lifetime corresponds to the temporal span commencing from the initiation of the process until the moment that the methanol conversion rate declines below 90% threshold. The calculation of these factors was carried out as follows (Eq.3 and Eq.4) which
coefficient accurately reflects the molar ratios and proportional quantities of methanol and propylene involved in the MTP reaction (3CH3OH => 1C3H6 + 3H2O), highlighting the theoretical stoichiometry of the equation. Given that the initial value derived represents a purely theoretical estimation predicated solely on the quantity of methanol processed, it is imperative to multiply this value by the factual average yield of propylene during the catalyst lifetime (until 90%), in order to ascertain the authentic quantity of propylene yielded. By considering the molar weights (Mw) of methanol and propylene, an estimation can be derived regarding the quantity of propylene produced through the processed methanol. It is common for researchers to use different WHSVs for their reactions, which impacts catalyst lifetime, but these tools allow us to compare the ability of catalysts to produce propylene (and convert methanol) even under different operational conditions.

As shown in Table 4, higher amounts of methanol per gram of catalyst were processed with HZ-AT (2120
and HZ-B-AT (2334
catalysts compared with HZ-OH (1272
. This means that catalysts with a shorter diffusion path, which is prepared with a modified seeding technique, have a high capacity for processing methanol and high resistance to deactivation. This observation is in excellent agreement with NH3-TPD results which were previously presented. It was mentioned that the HZ-B-AT sample has moderate acidity which prevents fast coke formation. Compared with HZ-OH (182.41
), HZ-B-AT has a higher amount of produced propylene per gram of catalyst (443.4
) due to the lower level of strong acid sites, and favors the alkene route which makes it a suitable catalyst for MTP processes.

Aside from the better catalytic performance of this modified seed-induced catalyst (HZ-B-AT), it is important to consider catalyst preparation from an economic perspective. In order to reduce costs, researchers are reducing the use of SDAs, but a ZSM-5 catalyst at an industrial scale is unlikely to be produced without utilizing SDAs. Hence, seed-induced processes could be a promising method for reducing the use of SDAs in manufacturing large-scale zeolite catalysts. The study was conducted with Petrochemical Research and Technology Company to minimize the production costs of ZSM-5 and improve its textural properties to achieve higher propylene yields over extended periods. TPABr: SiO2 in seed suspension has a molar ratio of 0.45, but only 8% of the seed is used in the final zeolite recipe. It is therefore expected that TPABr: SiO2 would be around 3:20 in synthesis gel, which is not a large amount and also advantageous in comparison to using TPAOH at greater scales. In this study, silicalite-1[Br] was used to reduce synthesis costs, and seeding modifications were made in order to reduce seed size to the extent possible. These different approaches are illustrated in Fig. 10. Initially, it may seem like the modified procedure has more unit operations, but the alkaline treatment isn't an additional step. It is part of the modified seed-induced synthesis, which was clearly shown at the beginning of the article (Fig. 1). As only one extra step is involved, namely ball milling, this part requires additional energy. In general, this additional cost is insignificant compared to the reduction of template costs when it comes to seed synthesis. In terms of industrial application, achieving a facile route for producing seed-induced ZSM-5 aggregates using ball-milled and alkali-treated seed may be useful for developing ZSM-5 catalysts with an extended lifetime for the conversion of methanol to light olefins.

4. Conclusion
In this study, an industrially-feasible approach is proposed to reduce the costs of seed-induced synthesis of ZSM-5 as well as improve their catalytic performance and lifetime in methanol to propylene (MTP). To achieve a cost-effective, efficient, and stable seed-induced ZSM-5 catalyst, a modified seeding technique utilizing ball milling and alkaline treatment was applied. Consequently, obtained zeolite had a short diffusion path and moderate acidity, which enhanced mass transfer and inhibited coke deposition. Compared with HZ-OH (synthesized by a conventional silicalite-1[OH] seed), HZ-B-AT (synthesized by ball-milled and alkali-treated silicalite-1[Br] seed) displayed a reliable MTP catalytic lifetime (265 h vs 159 h) in an accelerated catalytic test as well as higher amount of produced propylene per gram of catalyst (443
vs 182
). and lower heavy hydrocarbons selectivity (20.87 % vs 36.29 %).
