Hydrothermal study of Pt–Sn-based SAPO-34 supported novel catalyst used for selective propane dehydrogenation to propylene
Abstract
Catalyst's regeneration is unavoidable part during dehydrogenation. The hydrothermal treatment influence on the performance of Pt–Sn-based SAPO-34 supported novel catalyst, used for propane dehydrogenation to propylene is investigated in this study. The catalyst shows excellent stability for mild steaming (nitrogen mixed steam), during four consecutive runs (reaction–regeneration mode). On the other hand, Pt–Sn/ZSM-5 was largely affected on mild steaming due to severe dealumination. In order to get into mechanistic understanding, severe hydrothermal treatment was carried our using pure steam. The substation loss in catalyst activity was noted. Both fresh and severe hydrotreated catalysts were characterized by XRD, XRF, O2-pulse analysis of coke, NH3-TPD, IR spectrum of adsorbed ammonia, H2-TPR, HR-TEM and XPS, to explore reasons for change in catalytic properties. The texture/topology is found stable. Changes in surface ensembles occur due to the loss of Sn, Al, formation of SnOx species and in particular Pt sintering. This leads Pt active sites (zeolite–SnO–Pt) to inactive sites (zeolite–Pt, zeolite–PtO–Sn, Pt–Sn alloy, etc.) formation and reduced catalyst activity. TEM micrographs and H2-chemisorption analysis confirms Pt particles agglomeration and/or sintering. About 98% catalyst activity is recovered by re-dispersed Pt using chlorination technique and credit goes to hydrothermally stable support (SAPO-34).

1. Introduction
The high demand for olefins, especially propylene, boost up research activities in both catalysis and reactor design, to develop on-purpose propylene technologies. In order to meet the growing market demand of propylene, emphasize has been given particularly to light alkane dehydrogenation [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. The propane and/or butane dehydrogenation is the most economical route to propylene, while it is very complex in thermodynamical and engineering constraints [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Therefore, the numbers of catalysts for both oxidative and direct propane dehydrogenation routes were proposed in last two decades.
Both platinum and chromium based catalysts were largely reported for the alkane dehydrogenation. The chromium oxide-based catalysts have been used in the absence of hydrogen as a co-feed gas, and platinum-based catalysts were used in the presence of hydrogen [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. While, platinum-tin-based catalysts were reported as the most promising catalytic formulation for propane dehydrogenation [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Therefore, attractive results has been reported by using Pt–Sn-based catalyst supported on Al2O3 [21], [22], [27], [28], [29], SiO2 [22] and ZSM-5 zeolite [7], [9], [22]. The Pt–Sn-based SAPO-34 supported novel catalyst for propane and butane selective dehydrogenation was recently proposed with promising results [10], [11]. Moreover, in Pt–Sn-based catalysts the presences of Sn facilitate the transfer of coke from metal to support and Pt dispersion. Relatively weak acidity and larger surface area provided by SAPO-34 than ZSM-5 not only provide superior dehydrogenation rate, but also helps in reducing coke formation [10], [11]. Moreover, many attempts have been made to improve the performance of these catalysts using alkali and alkaline earth metals [30], [31], [32], [33]. The influence of tin (as promoter) on the performance of Pt–Sn-based catalysts has also been extensively investigated and concluded that Sn modifies the electronic density of Pt, decreases size of platinum ensembles, reduces coke formation, etc. [11], [21], [22], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. Recently it has been reported that the Sn forms coordinative unsaturated surface with Pt sites and preferentially covering of these high energetic Pt sites by Sn enhance catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation [21]. In our work it is observed that the intensification of Pt–Sn-based catalyst by adopting suitable support can enhance the catalyst's activity for alkane dehydrogenation [11]. However, an unavoidable problems associated with these catalysts are the coke formation, deactivation and activity recovery [7], [26], [40], those lead towards operational complexities.
Minachev's school float an idea, using X-ray spectroscopy techniques that the metal clusters on the surface of acid oxides are electron-deficient species, and this deficiency increases with an increase in acidity [41]. It was further explained, that the increase in the positive charge on a metallic nanoparticle increases with the local concentration of Brönsted acid sites. Therefore Brönsted acid sites act as electron-acceptor centers of the support, and these interactions ultimately leads to a decrease in the electron density on metal nanoparticles. And the increase in electron deficiency of metal particles enhances catalytic activity of bifunctional catalyst [42]. It is well known that the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation steps occur on the metal particles, and isomerization and carbon–carbon bond dissociation occur on the acid site. The stereo-chemistry of the light alkane dehydrogenation and thermodynamics is tide up with each other, and this problem is resolved by selecting suitable support SAPO-34 [10], [11], [43]. Mees et al. experimentally prove that the transfer of charge from SAPO-34 framework further enhance its hydrothermal stability [44].
Nevertheless, the effect of steam on supported metal catalysts was reported in few reports [27], [45], while Pt–Sn-based SAPO-34 supported novel catalyst was not studied yet. This work evaluates the influence of hydrothermal treatment (mild and extensive) on the performance of Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst. The performance of the catalysts was experimentally determined using fixed bed micro-reactor and compared with ZSM-5 supported catalysts [7], [9], [10], [11]. The possibilities of structural modifications, loss of metallic content, acidity, etc. were analyzed using number of physio-chemical techniques. The bi-metallic catalyst is completely characterized after extensive steaming and activity loss was sophisticatedly explained. Activity loss is recovered by chlorination technique. Therefore, the present work helps in understanding influence of severe steaming on catalytic properties of SAPO-34 supported catalyst during dehydrogenation and their superiority in operation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The bimetallic Pt–Sn based SAPO-34 zeolite supported catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], with powdered H-SAPO-34, calcined at 550 °C. First the SAPO-34 zeolite was co-impregnated with 0.16 M solution of SnCl2·2H2O at 80 °C to ensure 1 wt.% Sn promoter in the final catalyst. The catalyst was dried at 100 °C for 3 h and then calcined at 500 °C in muffle furnace for 4 h. The prepared Sn/SAPO-34 was again co-impregnated with 0.03 M solution of H2PtCl6 at 75 °C to ensure 0.5 wt.% Pt in the final catalyst. Afterwards, the same procedure was repeated, that the finally prepared bi-metallic was dried at 100 °C for 3 h and then calcined at 500 °C for 4 h. The prepared bi-metallic catalyst was crushed to fine powder. Pt–Sn/ZSM-5 was also prepared in similar manner. Before the reaction, catalysts were passing through hydrothermal treatment and then reduced in hydrogen for 8 h.
2.2. Hydrothermal treatment
In mild hydrothermal treatment, the catalyst was regenerated at 600 °C for 4 h with nitrogen mixed steam at 40 ml/min, and reused for second run. The steam partial pressure was 20 kPa. After regeneration, the catalysts were dried in flowing nitrogen for 20 min, and then reduced in hydrogen at 500 °C before the next reaction run. The similar procedure was adopted before each experimental run.
In severe hydrothermal treatment, the catalyst samples were exposed to pure steam at different temperatures 500, 600 and 700 °C, at 2 ml/g flow rates for 4 h. Later two samples were steamed at 500 and 600 °C with the flow rate of 2 ml/g for 8 h.
2.3. Reaction test
The propane dehydrogenation over mild and severe hydrothermally treated Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 samples was conducted in a plug-flow micro-reactor at atmospheric pressure. The 99.5% pure propane feed was used in current experimentation (provided by Zhong Ke Hui Jie, Beijing, China). The measured amount of catalyst was loaded to the reactor, in order to maintain desired WHSV (i.e. 5.6 h−1), and reduced under 10 ml/min flowing H2 at 500 °C, for 8 h prior to each reaction test. The reaction mixture was composed of H2/C3H8 molar ratios 0.25 and product composition was analyzed using on line gas chromatography (50-m PLOT Al2O3 capillary column) equipped with FID detector. The process was operated in a continuous reaction–regeneration–reduction mode for three consecutive runs for the performance of mild hydrothermally treated Pt–Sn-based SAPO-34 and ZSM-5 catalysts; reaction time was 8 h for each run. Both, mild and severe hydrothermally treated samples were tested under identical operating conditions. The results were calculated and presented in weight percentages.
2.4. Re-dispersion of Pt by chlorination
The chlorination process is carried out in a conventional setup. Measured amount of catalyst (0.2 g) is heated to 500 °C in a flow of N2 (15 ml/min), with temperature rising rate 5 °C/min. The C2Cl2H4 solution flask is immersed in the water bath of 0 °C. The N2 flow rate was adjusted to take C2Cl2H4 solution at 2.3 ml/min to the reactor for 1 h, and exhaust gases are passed through concentrated NaOH solution. The dispersed samples were again dechlorinated and then reduced before reaction tests.
2.5. Catalyst characterization
2.5.1. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
The XRD patterns of pure and hydrothermally treated samples were obtained on a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku-2500) having copper anode tube. The X-ray tube was operated at 40 kV/40 mA and Kα radiation (0.1541 nm) was selected with a monochromator. The spectra were scanned at a rate of 5°/min for an angular range 2θ from 5° to 45°.
2.5.2. X-ray fluorescence (XRF)
The metallic contents of the catalyst samples were obtained by XRF measurements on a Shimadzu XRF 1700 fluorimeter, before and after hydrothermal treatment.
2.5.3. BET surface area measurement
The BET surface areas of original and hydrothermally treated samples were measured using N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms determined through an automatic analyzer Autosrb-1-C. The samples were out gassed under vacuum at 300 °C prior to adsorption for 1 h. The surface areas of samples were calculated using the BET equation.
2.5.4. O2-pulse coke analysis
The amount of coke formed deposited on catalysts during the dehydrogenation reaction was determined by O2-pulse experiments using gas chromatograph flow system equipped with a TCD. The experiments were carried out at 750 °C by injecting pulses of pure oxygen (99.99%). The CO2 formed was continuously measured by a TCD detector and amount of coke was calculated. The pulses of pure O2 were continued until deposited coke was fully converted to CO2.
2.5.5. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD)
The acid properties of Pt–Sn doped SAPO-34 catalyst, before and after hydrothermal treatment at different temperatures were determined by NH3-TPD on conventional apparatus using Autochem-II 2920 analyzer. About 0.2 g of each catalyst sample was placed into a quartz reactor and treated by dry argon (99.99%) at 500 °C for 1 h prior to adsorption of ammonia. The samples were later saturated with ammonia at room temperature and 1 mbar. Afterwards, the physically adsorbed ammonia was allowed to desorb at 100 °C and 10−3 mbar. Subsequently, the temperature was raised to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and NH3 desorption profile was obtained using mass spectrometer Autochem-II 2920.
2.5.6. Temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR)
Temperature-programmed reduction experiments of pure and hydrothermally treated samples were carried out on a conventional setup (same apparatus as used for NH3-TPD) attached to Autochem-II 2920 analyzer. Samples of 0.2 g were loaded into the quartz reactor and dried by flowing N2 at 500 °C for 1 h. The reactor was heated gradually to 800 °C with a heating rate 10 °C/min. 5% H2/N2 mixture was used as reducing gas. The hydrogen consumption as a function of reduction temperature was recorded.
2.5.7. IR spectroscopy
The IR spectra of adsorbed ammonia on hydrothermally treated samples were recorded using a NEXUS apparatus (Nicolet, USA). Then the samples were degassed (<10–6 mbar) at 300 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature. Afterwards, ammonia was passed over the samples and the ammonia adsorption spectra were recorded at 100 °C. The concentration of Brönsted and Lewis acid sites was estimated from the areas of the bands, using the molar absorption coefficients of the bands of adsorbed ammonia, set equal to those determined for zeolites.
2.5.8. XPS analysis
The XPS analysis of the samples were obtained both after severe hydrothermal treatment and reaction tests at PerkinElmer PHI 5000C spectrometer (USA) working in the constant analyzer energy mode with Al-Kα radiation as the excitation source. The binding energies (BEs) were calibrated using carbonaceous C 1s line (284.6 eV) as reference. The elemental analysis was performed using ion-coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectroscopy equipped with Thermo Electron IRIS Intrepid II XSP spectrometer.
2.5.9. TEM analysis
The Pt metal dispersion on support was verified using a JEM 2010 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (operated at 120.0 kV), both after severe hydrothermal treatment and after the reaction. The sample for TEM observation was prepared using a common sonication method, while thick samples were dispersed in ethanol.
2.5.10. Pulse chemisorptions of hydrogen
The ability to adsorb hydrogen, of fresh and hydrothermally treated catalysts was determined by pulse chemisorptions of hydrogen experiments on a conventional setup using GC [46], [47]. Before pulse chemisorptions experiments, samples (0.2 g of catalyst) were reduced under flowing pure H2 (5 ml/min) at 400 °C for 2 h, then purged in N2 at 500 °C for 1 h, and successively cooled to room temperature. The temperature was controlled to ±2 °C by a temperature controlled setup. The samples were saturated by a hydrogen pulse at 25, 300 and 500 °C temperature. The chemisorptions of hydrogen were measured by using a gas chromatograph (7890-II) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The pulse size was 5 ml/min of 5% (v/v) H2 in N2 mixture, and the time between pulses was 3 min, until no further gas uptake by the catalyst was observed as indicated by constant peak areas of the last few injections. The total amount of adsorption was calculated by adding the gas uptake observed in the series of gas injections until saturation was reached. The total amount of H2 uptake (volume at room temperature) equals the sum of H2 uptake at different temperatures.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst performance under mild steaming
Table 1 shows the performance of Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 and Pt–Sn/ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation to propylene at 585 °C and 5.6 h−1 WHSV, in a continuous operation (reaction–regeneration mode), under mild steaming. It was apparently observed that the conversion of both catalysts was decreased after each run. In comparison, Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 conversion drop rate is slower than Pt–Sn/ZSM-5, with far superior propylene and total olefins selectivity. There was no significant change in propylene and total olefins selectivity pattern, while increase in selectivity's at higher TOS was due to lower conversion. This problem was also reported in previous studies of ZSM-5 and Al2O3 supported catalysts, due to dealumination during regeneration with steam and/or oxygen [38]. This built-in defect was eliminated by using inherently safer novel supports SAPO-34, whose structure/acid sites are Si based [10], [11]. Therefore, Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst demonstrated strong hydrothermal stability due to inherently robust characteristics of SAPO-34 support.

3.2. Severe hydrothermal treatment study
In detailed hydrothermal study steaming temperature and time influence on Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 stability was analyzed. The performance results in comparison with fresh catalyst are shown in Fig. 1. It was observed that, both propylene selectivity and propane conversion was stable initially, but reduces largely later on, by increasing TOS and steam temperature. Similar trend was obtained for total olefins selectivity. This reaction behavior is the major target of this extensive investigation, in order to find out the route causes of catalyst deactivation and how to recover it? Normally lower conversion enhances olefins selectivity (Table 1), but after hydrothermal treatment the opposite trend was obtained, i.e. lower conversion and lower olefins selectivity (Fig. 1), that indirectly demonstrated domination of directly anchored Pt sites. After steaming at 700 °C the propylene selectivity was decreased to 60% at TOS 5 h, with final conversion of about 7%. It is observed that the cracking products were enhanced during dehydrogenation over hydrothermally treated catalysts, as shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, ethylene and methane selectivity were increased, while ethane selectivity was found to be stable with steaming temperature. Table 2 shows the deactivation rate of hydrothermally treated Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst at different temperatures. It was observed that with the increase in steaming temperature deactivation rate and coke amount were significantly reduced, but it is due to the decrease in catalyst activity.

3.3. Catalyst characterization
3.3.1. Basic catalyst characterizations
The composition of metals incorporated, was determined from XRF analysis, before and after severe hydrothermal treatment. The results were tabulated in Table 3. It is confirmed that there is no loss of Pt even after severe steaming, while small loss of Sn was noted. The surface area (porous properties) tends to decreased with the increase in steaming temperature and time. Fresh catalyst possesses larger surface area (i.e. 412.7 m2/g) than hydrothermally treated catalysts. The rate of loss of BET surface area will increased with treatment severity (see Table 3), due to change in surface characteristics, owing to the loss of framework Al, Sn and Pt sintering [48], [49]. Sever loss of framework Al and Sn leads the particles towards pore blocking, which adversely affect the catalyst performance. Decrease in the pore volume is definite as Si–O bond length (0.165 nm) is smaller than Al–O bond length (0.175 nm) [40]. The smaller dynamic diameter of Sn4+ may accelerate its movement to the channels of SAPO-34 [40], while large dynamic diameter of Pt confirms its presence over the surface of support [10], [11]. Moreover, the loss of Sn is verified form XRF results.

3.3.2. Structural analysis
The X-ray diffraction patterns of fresh and severe hydrothermally treated catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. However, peaks of Pt and Sn are not observed as their concentration is too low. Moreover, XRD pattern did not shows any characteristic change in original structure of the SAPO-34 zeolite support, even after hydrothermal treatment. This indicates that the structural topological resistance of SAPO-34 toward hydrothermal treatment is much higher. The intensities of the corresponding peaks gradually decreased at angle 2θ = 8–10° demonstrate slight decrease in crystallinity with severity of hydrothermal treatment.

3.3.3. Characterization of acidic properties
Hydrothermal treatment has an obvious effect on catalyst acidity. While, Pt–Sn-based catalysts supported on SAPO-34 shows better stability in acidity in comparison with Pt–Sn/ZSM-5 [40]. The major reason for acid sites stability over SAPO-34 is due to their Si-based acid sites, while in ZSM-5 acid sites are Al based. The NH3-TPD is an efficient technique to measure amount and acidic strength. The peak area of a TPD profile represents the amount of desorbed NH3, whereas the peak position corresponds to the strength of catalyst's acidity. The profiles of fresh and hydrothermally treated samples were shown in Fig. 5. Two ammonia desorption peaks were appeared in TPD profile. The first peak between 185 and 205 °C was representing weak acid sites and the second peak between 330 and 350 °C corresponds to the strong acid sites [11]. Therefore, it is confirmed that the Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 has distinctive weak and strong acid sites even after the severe hydrothermal treatment. It was observed that the weak acid sites were significantly decreased, while the strong acid sites were almost unaffected. A slight increment in Brönsted acid sites after hydrothermal treatment may be due to some hydroxyl group's attachment to Pt or Sn. It is clearly observed that the weak acidity was decreased with hydrothermal treatment intensity, with no shift in peaks positions. In general, no substantial loss of strong acidity was observed after the hydrothermal treatment of SAPO-34 supported catalyst as their acid sites were Si based and resistant to hydrothermal environment.

Ammonia adsorption IR spectroscopy is a powerful technique for measuring and distinguishing the acid sites of SAPO-34 supported catalysts. Fig. 6 shows ammonia adsorption behavior of fresh and severe hydrothermally treated samples evaluated at 100 °C. Both, Lewis and Brönsted acid sites appears at ammonia absorption bands between 1620–1640 and 1450–1465 cm−1, respectively. The intensity of acid sites decreased with the increase in hydrothermal treatment temperature. Therefore the IR spectra results are in accordance with the NH3-TPD results, verified that the intensities of the corresponding bands associated with chemisorbed ammonia were decreased after severe hydrothermal treatment. But generally, during the hydrothermal treatment, Brönsted acid sites decreased as steam affect hydroxyl bridging. It is believed that higher Si/Al ratio of zeolite has high hydrothermal resistance and Si-based acid sites of SAPO-34 make it more robust towards hydrothermal treatment [50].

3.3.4. Active sites characterization
The reduction properties of catalysts were measured by H2-TPR and profiles were shown in Fig. 7. However, the H2 adsorption is somehow interfered by the interaction of Pt with Sn oxides, and support after hydrothermal treatment. Two reduction peaks were appears, one at lower temperature (around 100 °C) and the second was at higher temperature (between 400 and 700 °C). There is almost no effect on initial reduction peaks ascribed to reduction of PtO2 particles. The reduction peaks at higher temperatures indicate reduction of Sn4+ and Sn2+ to Sn0 species [11], [51]. Sharpness of reduction peaks at higher temperatures decreases with the increase of hydrothermal treatment temperature. However, the reduction peak areas were increased. These higher temperature peaks corresponds to the reduction of SnO2 to Sn2+, means that most of Sn forms SnO2 after the hydrothermal treatment and adversely affect Pt–Sn interaction, and may form Pt–Sn alloy and blocked Pt active sites. The active Pt could be located on SnOx surface to become favorable for the dehydrogenation reaction [48]. While increase in the area of higher temperature peaks and/or formation of third peak at higher temperatures reveals that the hydrothermal treatment significantly reduced Sn-support interaction. This indicates Sn sintering, mobile species and loss. The increase in hydrothermal temperature and time, decreases the amounts of adsorbed H2, revealing that the interactions between Pt and SnOx decreased and ultimately change the surface characteristics [45].

The more in sight analysis of the chemical species were characterized by XPS analysis. The XPS data give information about the oxidation states of the metal phases (Pt and/or Sn) of Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst. The Pt4f7/2 (B.E. 70–80 eV) and Sn3d5/2 (B.E. 482–502 eV) XPS spectra were obtained, and shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9, respectively. The main signal of each spectrum was deconvoluted, evidencing a number of signals in each spectrum. The references values were taken from the Handbook of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy [52].

In Fig. 8, after the deconvolation of main signal with Gaussian fitting, the binding energy signals at 71.8, 72.2 and 74.1 eV are identified that correspond to the Pt–Sn alloy, Pt0 and PtOads species respectively, while later signals were assigned to PtOx. The Pt 4f7/2 signal in the XPS spectrum for the Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst appears overlapped with the Al 2p; this undoubtedly makes it difficult to take effective advantage of this spectrum. But there is a clear change in electronic effect with the hydrothermal treatment. It is observed that the Pt0 was decrease with the severity of hydrothermal treatment, while on the other hand PtOx were increased. This demonstrates that a part of the platinum (or reduced) would gain electronic density from tin, as reported by Stagg et al. [53]. And fundamental reason for the new Pt 4f7/2 signal at lowers binding energies (71.8 eV). According to the charge density admission effect, if a displacement of the platinum signal occurs at lower binding energies due to the formation of the Pt–Sn alloy, a similar effect should also take place but in the opposite direction for tin signal of the Pt–Sn alloy [54], [55].
Fig. 9 presents the XPS spectrum for Sn after deconvolation of main signal. In Sn 3d5/2 region spectrum, three peaks are observed at 486.3, 487.2, and 488.7 eV, those were attributed to species of Sn0, and oxidized (Sn(II) and/or Sn(IV)). But its quite difficult to differentiate between Sn(II) and Sn(IV) by means of the XPS studies [56], [57]. Therefore, we can only differentiate between the states that tin exists, only by saying SnOx. It is believed that the complete reduction of Sn is not possible due to a strong interaction between Sn and structural oxygen and/or between Pt metal and the aluminum in the SAPO-34. It is noted that the signal attributable to Sn0 is a little displaced toward binding energy higher than energy as reported by Coloma et al. [56], [57]; this displacement suggests that Sn may giving up electronic density to platinum, which means that they are forming a Pt–Sn alloy. In our detailed XPS analysis, a general trend was observed that with the increase in severity of the hydrothermal conditions, Sn0 species concentration decreased with the increase in concentration of SnOx.
The Sn(0)/SnTotal and Sn(0)/Pt ratio were shown in Table 4. The possibilities of coexistence of different alloys with different Pt/Sn ratios could not be ruled out. However, the absence or very small existence of Pt–Sn alloy in the PtSn/SAPO-34 can be explained in terms of the quantity of Sn available to form the alloy. XPS results showed that in fresh catalyst has more Sn atoms available to form the alloy, which leads to a Sn(0)/Pt ratio of approximately 0.75. But most of the ionic atoms were dispersed and interacted with the support. Therefore, the small concentration of Sn and Pt, discourage the Pt–Sn alloy formation in the presence of support interaction [11], [55]. Moreover, Pt–Sn alloy is not active during alkane dehydrogenation [11], [55]. The intensity of hydrothermal treatment largely reduce the Sn(0)/Pt ratio to 0.45, that means hydrothermal treatment increases chances of Pt–Sn alloy formation, but in actual ionic Sn decreased due to the increase in SnOx. Therefore, the inhibiting effect of tin is observed, even for the catalysts with low Sn/Pt ratio. The contribution of Sn(0) with respect to SnTotal decreased with the hydrothermal treatment intensity. This situation suggests that there is an electron charge transfer from tin to platinum.

The increase in Sn(II) and Sn(IV) reduction signals can be attributed to the oxidative effect of steam. The possible reason for this decrease in reduction peaks of hydrotheated samples were may be due to the distinct loss of Sn species, and reduction in amount of oxidized Sn species or increased Sn sintering. This tendency directly related to the nature of severity of hydrothermal treatment. Even at higher hydrothermal treatment temperatures, the peak representing the reduction of SnOx to Sn0 decreases remarkably, demonstrating that the formation of Pt–Sn alloy is less. It is also known that the adsorption of water between the metal and support could weaken these interactions [45], [58].
3.3.5. Effect of hydrothermal treatment on surface metallic dispersion
The morphology of fresh and hydrothermally treated Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 catalysts are characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and shown in Fig. 10. It is observed that the hydrothermal treatment has large geometric effects, with the dominant electronic effect is as discussed above. Under high magnification it was clear that Pt particles (1.4–2.5 nm) were on the surface of SAPO-34 and well dispersed. A slight change in the particle size and particle population was noted after hydrothermal treatment. However, some agglomerated particles were observed after the hydrothermal treatment at different temperatures, while population density largely decreased. This decrease in population density of surface Pt was due to the Sn sintering by forming SnOx mobile species, loss of Sn and change in Pt–Sn interaction. Consequently, the phenomenon becomes more apparent with the increase in hydrothermal temperature.

The sintering of Pt particles and/or Pt dispersion, and the interaction changes between Pt, Sn promoter, and support (SAPO-34) were the most important factors of the catalyst's activity loss after hydrothermal treatment. It has also known that, oxygen and steam atmosphere drastically enhance Pt sintering [45], [59], [60]. Therefore the pulse chemisorptions of hydrogen were commonly used to estimate the sintering of Pt particles and structural changes. The results of hydrogen chemisorptions of fresh and hydrothermally treated catalysts are shown in Table 5. Here, the total amount of H2 uptake of the samples at low and high temperatures is the sum of H2 uptake at 500, 300, and 25 °C. The amount of hydrogen chemisorptions at low temperature (25 °C) can be used to characterize the size of the Pt particles, and at high temperatures (500 and 300 °C) hydrogen chemisorptions were related to the interactions between Pt and Sn promoter and/or support (SAPO-34) [60], [61]. Directly anchored Pt (with SAPO-34) sites are favorable for low temperature H2 chemisorptions, and responsible for the hydrogenolysis reaction and carbon deposits. While Pt sites (anchored with SAPO-34 through SnOx) can adsorb more H2 at high temperatures and are the main reaction active sites for the dehydrogenation of propane. It was further reported that, the oxygen or steam adsorption over Pt surface can distinctly reduce the interactions between metal and support, thus promoting the sintering of Pt particles and destroy Pt–Sn clusters [58], [62]. The high uncertainty in the H2 chemisoption results suggests that, it is an effective technique to characterize surface dispersions of Pt.

It is observed that the fresh catalyst shows a relatively little amount of H2 that adsorbed at room temperature, in comparison with the adsorbed H2 at higher temperatures (300 and 500 °C), evidently suggesting the existence of interactions between Pt and SnOx. That is the active Pt interaction (Pt–SnO–SAPO-34), needed for propane dehydrogenation. In the hydrothermally treated samples, the amount of adsorbed H2 decreases at both room and higher temperatures, linearly with the intensity of treatment. This reveals that, the favorable interaction for dehydrogenation, between Pt and SnOx decrease. Therefore, the surface characteristics were changed and the Pt active sites concentration decreased remarkably. The results of the hydrogen chemisorptions analysis are consistent with the TEM analysis. While, the possible reasons of Pt sintering, can be attributed to the loss of Sn species, that is also related to the dealumination, as the existence of aluminum can stabilize Sn species [51], [63].
Fig. 11 demonstrates the possible interactions of metals with support. Previously, it is believed that two types of Pt and Sn sites were appeared on ZSM-5 zeolite [42], [50]. Pt sites directly anchors on the SAPO-34 surface, Pt anchored with Sn oxide surface, SnO attached to SAPO-34 surface and SnOx sintered on Pt anchored with support (see Fig. 11). First Pt site is responsible for side reactions like hydroisomerization, cracking, etc. while the second Pt site is the main active site for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. It has long been known that, the formation of highly active “Sn4C–Pt” ensemble sites are in the atomic closeness of Pt, is important for dehydrogenation. After severe hydrothermal treatment some amount of Sn species loosed from second site and destroyed the sandwich structure and form first directly anchored Pt sites. This increases proportion of direct anchored Pt sites, leads towards agglomeration/sintering and decrease activity of the catalyst.

3.4. Recovery of Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 activity
The activity of Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 catalyst treated at different temperatures were recovered by re-dispersion of Pt by chlorination technique and its reaction performance results for propane dehydrogenation are shown in Table 6. Almost all the activity of catalyst is recovered. The reaction results were further verified by H2 chemisorption to confirm the active sites distribution after recovery. The results were tabulated in Table 7. This intensive achievement was made possible due to the SAPO-34, as it is the robust support that not only enhances the Pt–Sn-based catalyst performance, but also maintains its stability in conventional processing.

4. Conclusions
The hydrothermal treatment influence on the performance of Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 novel catalyst for propane dehydrogenation to propylene is investigated and compared with Pt–Sn/ZSM-5. The catalyst shows excellent stability after mild steaming (nitrogen mixed steam) for four continuous reaction–regeneration runs (regenerated at 600 °C). The propane conversion, propylene selectivity and total olefin selectivity after fourth consecutive runs were 9.3%, 94.5% and 97.3%, respectively at TOS 8 h. Severe hydrothermal treatment with pure steam results obtained at 500, 600 and 700 °C and varying time durations 4–8 h, shows interesting results and provide room for their detailed characterization. The physio-chemical analysis of sever hydrothermally treated samples were helped to find reasons for activity loss during regeneration with steam. Basic catalytic properties and texture of Pt–Sn/SAPO-34 was found to be stable after hydrothermal treatment. The small changes in acidity was noted and found proportional to the severity of hydrothermal conditions. From XPS analysis, four types of metallic species were found over SAPO-34, with some mobile species. In accordance with the severity of hydrothermal treatment conditions Pt0 and Sn0 decreased with the substational increase in their corresponding oxides. The Pt–Sn alloy formation was enhanced, and loss of Al and Sn leads Pt sintering, is the probable reasons for reduction in activity of the hydrothermally treated catalysts. Ultimately, the loss of Sn and framework Al changes the surface characteristics of the catalyst towards lower dehydrogenation activity. HR-TEM micrograph shows that Pt particles become agglomerated/sintered and their population density also decreased with the increase in hydrothermal treatment temperature and time. The impressive results were obtained from H2-chemisorption analysis, which demolishes the ambiguity in other characterization results. The amazing breakthrough is the 98% recovery of catalyst activity after severe hydrothermal treatment by re-dispersion of Pt and credit goes to the hydrothermally stable support SAPO-34 due to its Si-based stable acid cites.
