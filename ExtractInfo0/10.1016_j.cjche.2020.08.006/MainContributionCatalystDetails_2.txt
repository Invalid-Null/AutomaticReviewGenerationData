 Based on the analysis of the provided document, this does not appear to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document discusses oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide to produce ethylene. Since the focus is on ethane conversion rather than propane, I do not have details to provide on a propane dehydrogenation catalyst or process enhancements.
