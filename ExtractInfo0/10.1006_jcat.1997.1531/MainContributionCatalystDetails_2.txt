The given document does not pertain to propane dehydrogenation as it studies the catalysts for propane hydrogenolysis. Hydrogenolysis involves cleaving C-C bonds in propane, while dehydrogenation involves removing hydrogen atoms to form propylene. The document focuses on characterizing PtNaY and PtxSnyNaY catalysts and evaluating their performance for propane hydrogenolysis, not propane dehydrogenation.
