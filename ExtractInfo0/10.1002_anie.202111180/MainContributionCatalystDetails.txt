 Unfortunately, the provided documents do not contain enough relevant information to populate the requested XML structure for propane dehydrogenation research. The documents focus on ion exchange methods to control proton accessibility in zeolites, but do not provide details on catalyst composition, performance metrics, or process conditions specifically related to converting propane to propylene. As such, I am unable to extract the key scientific findings or data pertinent to propane dehydrogenation in a cohesive summary.
