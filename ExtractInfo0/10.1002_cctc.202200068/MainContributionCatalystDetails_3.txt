The given document does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) to produce propylene. Though it mentions oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the focus is on investigating boron nitride catalysts activated by different methods for this reaction, rather than specifically improving propane conversion, propylene selectivity or yield. The document does not provide details on performance metrics like propane conversion, propylene selectivity, or yield for a catalyst that could be considered a main scientific contribution for PDH or ODH.
