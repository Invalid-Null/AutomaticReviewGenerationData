Abstract
Vanadium oxide-modified hydroxyapatite (HAP) with varying vanadium content was synthesized by the coprecipitation and impregnation methods. The structures of the two series of catalysts were compared, and the effects of vanadium content on catalytic properties in cyclohexane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) are evaluated. The XRD, UV‒Vis and XPS analyses indicate that the V species in the two series of samples exist in different chemical environments. The samples prepared by the impregnation method are mainly composed of V2O5 species, while the samples prepared by the coprecipitation method show a replacement of a part of the P in the HAP lattice by VO4. The influence of the preparation method and vanadium content on the reaction rate and reaction route for the ODH of cyclohexane is investigated. VHAP shows higher cyclohexene selectivity. The effect of VOx species on the ODH reaction of cyclohexane was investigated and the reaction mechanism was proposed.

1. Introduction
Cyclohexene is an important chemical raw material that is widely used in the production of nylon 6, adipic acid, nylon 66, polyamide, polyester and other fine chemicals [1,2]. The traditional production method for cyclohexene involves obtaining cyclohexanol by the oxidation of cyclohexane in the liquid phase and cyclohexene by a dehydration reaction. Direct conversion of cyclohexane to cyclohexene through heterogeneous catalysis is an ideal process, but to date, no catalytic system has shown a satisfactory cyclohexene yield [3,4]. This is mainly because cyclohexene is the intermediate product of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of cyclohexane, with benzene and COx byproducts formed during the reaction. Therefore, it is necessary to find a catalyst with good activity and selectivity to ensure easier dehydrogenation of cyclohexane into cyclohexene at low temperature and reduce the occurrence of side reactions.
The supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalyst shows high activity and selectivity in the ODH reaction of ethane, propane and butane [5], [6], [7]. However, the activity and selectivity of the ODH reaction are also strongly dependant on the structure of vanadium and the type of carrier used. Hydroxyapatite (HAP, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) is the most stable calcium phosphate species in the pH range >2 and T<1400 °C and is cheap and easily available. It is widely used to build artificial bones and teeth because it is stable, strong and biocompatible. Increasing attention has been given to the application of HAP in the field of catalysis with further study of the structural characteristics of HAP [8], [9], [10], [11]. HAP is amphoteric and can act as both an acid and base and can also be regulated by adjusting the calcium to phosphorus ratio. The addition of heterogeneous metals or oxides can also be used to change the acidity and alkality of HAP. In addition, it was found that the phosphate in HAP can change the electronic environment of heterogeneous metals, promote their high dispersion, and promote the stability of the catalyst through strong metal-support interactions [12,13]. Based on the above properties, HAPs as catalyst carriers show excellent properties in catalytic reactions. For example, Xu et al. reported that a HAP-bound ruthenium catalyst (Ru-HAP) can be used to significantly reduce the reaction conditions for many redox reactions, such as the conversion of stearic acid to alkanes at as low as 100 °C, and the isolated yield from jatropha oil, palm oil, and waste cooking oil to long-chain alkanes reached up to 95, 96, and 87 mol% at 180 °C and 2 MPa H2 within 4–4.5 h, respectively [13].
For another example, hydroxyapatite-bound palladium catalyst (Pd–HAP) showed excellent performance in hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone [14]. At 25 °C and ambient H2 pressure in water, phenol can be 100% converted into cyclohexanone with 100% selectivity. This is because HAP has strong adsorption and activation for the hydroxyl groups, which is conducive to the efficient catalytic reaction of metal catalytic sites on the HAP surface.
In addition, Ca or P can be replaced by heterogenic atoms in the synthesis process of HAPs. In fact, HAPs show catalytic activity that is particularly sensitive to their bulk composition [15,16] despite the occurrence of chemical reactions at the catalyst surface. By introducing redox heteroatoms to modify HAP, a bifunctional material with both acid-base and redox properties can be obtained [17], [18], [19]. In particular, V isomorphic-substituted HAPs (VHAPs) show good catalytic performance in the oxidation of numerous alkanes and alcohols or in C–C bond-forming reactions [20], [21], [22]. To date, vanadium has been deposited mostly on the surface of HAPs using an impregnation method [20,23]. There are few reports for the incorporation of vanadium into the framework of HAPs due to the difficulty of substituting phosphates with vanadates [24] and the effects of vanadium content on REDOX properties when VHAPs are used in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
Although HAPs have been reported in redox reactions, the synthesis of VHAP and its application in the ODH reaction of hydrocarbons have been very under-reported. In addition, the effect of the VOx content on the structure and catalytic properties have not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, V isomorphic-substituted HAPs were synthesized by a coprecipitation method with various V contents. For a comparative study, HAP was used as a catalyst carrier to prepare a series of VOx/HAP catalysts with different loading amounts by an impregnation method. The influence of the synthesis method on the structure of the catalysts and the influence of the structure of the catalysts on the catalytic performance for ODH were discussed. The effect of VOx species on the ODH reaction of cyclohexane was revealed and the reaction mechanism was proposed. Establishing the relationship between the selectivity of catalytic reaction and the structure of catalyst at the atomic level will contribute to the future development of molecular catalysis science [25].
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
2.1.1. Synthesis of V isomorphic-substituted HAP crystals
First, 0.02 mol calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O) and ammonium vanadate (NH4VO3) were dissolved in 4 mL deionized water to form a mixed solution. Six millilitres of concentrated ammonia water (NH4OH) (25 wt.%) was slowly dropped into the mixed solution and stirred evenly. Then, NH4H2PO4 (Ca/P = 1.67) was dissolved in deionized water, into which 8 mL NH4OH (25 wt.%) was slowly added, following which a uniform P-containing emulsion was formed by stirring. The P emulsion was slowly added to the Ca-containing solution and stirred for 20 min. The pH was tested with a pH strip. For a pH below 12, a small amount of NH4OH (25 wt.%) was added to adjust the pH above 12. The suspension was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and aged for 12 h at 120 °C. The products were collected, washed with deionized water and filtered. The filter cake was dried overnight in a drying oven at 70 °C. The V isomorphic-substituted HAP catalyst was prepared by roasting the dried samples in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for 4 h. By varying the amount of V, a series of V isomorphic-substituted HAP catalysts with different V/Ca ratios were obtained, named VHAP-x (where x is the V/Ca ratio: x = 0.05, 0.075, 0.1 and 0.125).
2.1.2. Immersion synthesis of the VOx/HAP catalyst
A specific amount of NH4VO3 was dissolved in a small amount of deionized water. Commercialized HAP (Ca/P = 1.67) was added to NH4VO3 solution and stirred evenly. The sample was dried at 100 °C and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h to obtain the VOx/HAP catalyst prepared by the wet impregnation method. The catalyst was named VOx/HAP-y (y is the V/Ca ratio, y = 0.05, 0.075, 0.1 and 0.125).
2.2. Catalyst characterization
An SRS-3400 X-ray fluorometer (XRF) was used to determine the chemical compositions of the samples. The samples were characterized by nitrogen adsorption−desorption isotherm measurements at 77 K using an Autosorb-1-MP type adsorption analyser, and the surface areas of the samples were determined by the BET method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with a CuKα (λ = 0.15406 nm) radiation source operating at 40 mA and 40 kV. UV–Vis spectra for the samples were measured with a SHIMADZU UV-2450 UV‒Vis spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted using a Thermo Escalab 250 XPS system. The SEM and TEM images were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, SIGMA 500) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-F200), respectively. The acidic properties of the samples were evaluated by the temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) method using a Chem-adsorption analyser (made by the Dalian University of Technology).
2.3. Catalyst performance
The ODH reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor with a reaction tube with an inner diameter of 8 mm. The catalyst was pressed and screened into 20–40 mesh, and 0.5 g catalyst was filled in the constant temperature area of the reactor. The catalyst was activated at 500 °C for 1 h, with a N2 flow rate of 40 mL/min. After cooling to the reaction temperature (410 °C), cyclohexane was injected by using a microinjection pump. The reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure at an air flow rate of 40 mL/min. After 1 hour of the reaction, the product was collected and tested. The product was collected every hour for 10 h.
The liquid hydrocarbons were analysed by using an Agilent 7890A GC equipped with a HP-5 capillary column and a FID. The difference in the atomic carbon between the inlet (cyclohexane carbon) and outlet (the sum of all carbons from all identified species, including unreacted cyclohexane) determined during steady-state operation is due to the COx phase.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
The XRF method was used to analyse the elemental composition of all samples, and the results are listed in Table 1. All samples show very similar Ca/P ratios that range between 1.7 and 1.8. The V/Ca ratios in the two series of samples are increased with the amount of V introduced, while the V/Ca ratios for the two series of samples are slightly different. The V/Ca ratios for the wet impregnated samples are higher than that in the V isomorphic-substituted HAPs. In the process of wet impregnation, almost all V species are precipitated, and the difference observed between the test and theoretical values is due to the error of the test method. However, the VHAP samples are synthesized by hydrothermal coprecipitation and the resulting precipitation are washed with deionized water. A small amount of unprecipitated V is washed out of the system. Therefore, the V/Ca ratio of VHAP samples is generally lower than that of VOx/HAP samples. Table 1 lists the BET surface area values obtained for all the samples. The BET surface area values for VOx/HAP are very similar, indicating that the amount of VOx in the experimental range does not change the surface area values of the catalyst. However, the VHAP samples show higher a BET surface area than VOx/HAP and the surface area of VHAP samples gradually increased with the increase of V content. This may be because the introduction of V increases the pH value of the system and reduces the precipitation rate.

Fig. 1 presents the powder XRD patterns obtained for the VHAP and VOx/HAP samples. All the samples show the presence of the hydroxyapatite phase, which is correlated with JCPDS File No. 9–390 [26]. According to JCPDS File No. 9–387, the XRD peaks due to orthorhombic V2O5 appear at 2θ = 15.44°, 20.39°, 21.87°, 25.83°, 30.96°, 31.95°, 34.37°, 39.10°, 40.09°, 47.72°, 51.11°, and 55.53°, which can be assigned to the Bragg planes (200), (001), (101), (110), (400), (011), (310), (002), (311), (302), (020), and (021), respectively [27]. For VHAP, no obvious V2O5 diffraction peak is observed, indicating that V species are well dispersed or V2O5 crystals are not formed. However, no sharp V2O5 diffraction peaks are observed for the VOx/HAP catalyst synthesized by the impregnation method with a low V content (VOx/HAP-0.05 and VOx/HAP-0.075), but when the V/Ca content is increased to 0.1 and 0.125, a significant V2O5 diffraction peak is observed. This indicates that the dispersion of V species prepared by the coprecipitation method is better than that prepared by the impregnation method.

Fig. 1. XRD patterns of HAP, V2O5 and VHAP (a) and VOx/HAP (b).
UV‒Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to describe the vanadium coordination environment. As mentioned in many studies, absorption bands in the wavelength range of 200 to 300 nm can be attributed to the charge-transfer transitions of tetrahedrally coordinated monomeric, dimeric, or trimeric VOx units [28], [29], [30]. Charge transfer transitions in the wavelength range of 300–400 nm are associated with tetrahedrally coordinated long-chain or large 2D VOx oligomers [30], [31], [32]. Usually, crystalline V2O5 has a very broad absorption band with maxima located at 400 and 490 nm [28].
Fig. 2 shows the UV‒Vis spectra for the HAP, VHAP and VOx/HAP samples. Significant differences are clearly observed for the samples synthesized by the two methods. The HAP samples show a few absorption bands in the wavelength range of 200 to 500 nm. A sharp absorption band at approximately 255 nm is observed in the VHAP sample (Fig. 2(a)), indicating that the band is composed exclusively of V-O bonds. This band is due to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT)O–V5+ of isolated tetrahedral VO43− species in the HAP framework [24,33]. The absorption edges of VHAP are slightly shifted to higher wavelengths with increasing vanadium content, indicating that vanadate ions gradually replace phosphate [34]. This change indicates an increase in the V-O distance, as previously reported for vanadate species in different lattices [35]. Almost no absorption bond was observed in the 200–300 nm range for the VHAP catalysts, indicating the absence of crystalline V2O5. For VOx/HAP catalysts, the absorption bands can be divided into two regions: the wavelength range of 200–400 nm and that higher than the 400 nm absorption band. Although the VOx/HAP catalyst has an absorption bond in the 200–400 nm range, the increase of the bond strength is not obvious compared with that of HAP catalyst. This indicates that the catalyst surface has a high dispersion of VOx units. The VOx/HAP catalyst shows an obvious absorption band at wavelengths higher than 400 nm, and the absorption strength increases with increasing amount of VOx impregnation. This indicates that crystalline V2O5 exists in the VOx/HAP catalysts, and the amount of crystalline V2O5 increases with increasing amount of VOx impregnation.

The UV‒Vis absorption edge energy (Eg) can be used to determine the VOx species because it is related to the number of V-O-V bonds or the domain size of vanadia polymers on the surface of the carrier [36,37]. The edge energies, Eg, were determined from the x-intercept of the linearized near edge region of an absorption vs. hm plot, i.e., according to the method of Tandon and Gupta [38]. The Eg values for the two series of samples are listed in Table 1. The Eg for the VHAP and VOx/HAP samples are gradually redshifted with increasing VOx content. Gao et al. [35] reported an approximate linear relationship between Eg values and the number of V-O-V covalent bonds around the central V5+ cations based on the test for the standard compound. For the standard compounds with 0–5 V-O-V bonds, the Eg values range between 3.48 and 2.35 eV. Feng et al. [39] used these test results to evaluate the number of V-O-V bonds for different VOx loading amounts and then used these values to predict the molecular structures of VOx on the surface of the carrier.
In this paper, the Eg value was also used to determine the VOx composition and further predict the molecular structures of VOx. The numbers of V-O-V bonds in the samples are listed in Table 1. The edge energy of the VHAP samples ranges between 3.08 and 3.63 with little variation. VHAP-0.05 shows a V-O-V bond value of 3.63, which corresponds to isolated tetrahedrally coordinated VO4 species.
According to the literature [36], V-O-V bonds will be gradually generated with increasing precipitation of VOx, resulting in a gradual increase in the average VOx domain size and a corresponding decrease in the edge energy. The marginal energy value for VHAP reaches its lowest value at the highest VOx loading amount. However, even at the highest loading (VHAP-0.125), the Eg value (3.08 eV) is still much higher than that of the V2O5 crystal (2.2 eV [40]), indicating that VHAP has fewer V-O-V bonds than V2O5. This is because V replaces the position of P in the original HAPs. The possible molecular structures for VHAP are shown in Fig. 3, which is consistent with previous literature [24]. The perfect hexagonal HAP unit is composed of two chemical formula units (Ca5(PO4)3OH) in the space group P 63/m. Petit et al. [24] have proved that V replaces P in HAP to get (Ca10(PO4)6-x(VO4)x(OH)2) when V is introduced, and the x values in the range of 4–6 are controlled by the pH of synthetic system and the amount of V added. The pure phase Ca2V2O7 (x = 6) can be obtained when P hasn't been added. It indicates that V replaces the position of P in HAPs. It is difficult to form V-O-V under the experimental conditions used for introducing V. The Eg value for VOx/HAP ranges from 2.2 eV to 1.54 eV, decreasing sequentially with increasing impregnation amount. This indicates that the molecular structure of VOx in the VOx/HAP samples is V2O5, and the degree of aggregation of the V2O5 crystal becomes more obvious with increasing loading amount.

Fig. 3. The three-dimensional crystal structure model of the HAP (a) and V isomorphic-substituted HAP crystal (b).
The surface composition and chemical states of P, Ca, O and V species were analysed by XPS (Fig. 4). The P and Ca signals for VHAP-0.1 and VOx/HAP-0.1 are observed to remain almost unchanged, indicating that V atom doping does not change the chemical structure of P and Ca in the HAP crystal. Fig. 4(c) presents a comparison of the O 1 s signals measured for the VHAP-0.1 and VOx/HAP-0.1 samples. Oxygen species are generally considered to be divided into three states [41]: the peak centred at 528.9–529.3 eV is attributed to lattice oxygen (O2−) [42], the peak centred at 530.9–531.2 eV is assigned to desorbed oxygen species, such as peroxo or superoxo [43], and the peak centred at 532.6–533.5 eV is ascribed to adsorbed surface hydroxyl species or carbonates [44]. Fig. 4(c) shows that there is almost no difference between the VHAP-0.1 and VOx/HAP-0.1 samples, indicating that the oxygen species are almost the same. The main peak due to O 1 s appears at 531 eV, indicating the existence of mainly adsorbed oxygen species. Fig. 4(d) shows the V 2P signals measured for VHAP-0.1 and VOx/HAP-0.1. Two peaks are observed; the peak at 524.5 eV belongs to the V 2P1/2 signal, and the peak at the V 2P3/2 signal (∼517 eV) can be decomposed into V4+ (516.2 eV) and V5+ (517.8 eV) oxidation states. The V in the VHAP-0.1 and VOx/HAP-0.1 samples is mainly in the +5 valence state, although the environments of the V species in the two samples are completely different. V2O5 forms the main structure in the VOx/HAP-0.1 samples, while the V in the VHAP-0.1 samples replaces part of the P to form tetrahedrally coordinated VO4.

Fig. 5 shows the SEM, TEM images and element mappings obtained for the VHAP-0.1 and VOx/HAP-0.1 samples. The VHAP-0.1 and VOx/HAP-0.1 samples are composed of homogeneous nanoparticles that are clustered together. The single particle size of VOx/HAP-0.1 is larger than that of VHAP-0.1. EDX analysis shows that the V species are well distributed in the samples. The lattice fringe spacing of 0.273 nm, 0.309 nm and 0.815 nm in Fig. 5(b) are attributed to the 300, 210 and 100 crystal planes of HAP, respectively. No lattice fringes belonging to vanadium species are observed. This provides more intuitive evidence for the entry of vanadium species into HAP lattice. Fig. 5(g) is the TEM image of VOx/HAP-0.1. The lattice fringe spacing of 0.289 nm and 0.435 nm can be attributed to the 301 and 001 crystal planes of V2O5. This indicates the presence of V2O5 crystals in VOx/HAP-0.1. This is the same as the results obtained by XRD.

The acid characteristics of VHAP and VOx/HAP were tested by the NH3-TPD technique. Two peaks (Fig. 6) are observed to be present in the temperature range of 140–350 °C and 350–640 °C, which is consistent with the TPD results of HAP reported in the literature [45,46]. Phosphate groups in HAP are responsible for the acidity of the catalyst, whereas the Ca2+ ions are responsible for the basicity. The strong acid sites can be attributed to the protons from HPO42− group and the weak acid sites to adsorbed water that interacts with ammonia through dipolar interactions [47]. The high-temperature peak in the range of 350–640 °C for VHAP and VOx/HAP samples are significantly different. The high-temperature peak for the VHAP samples becomes weaker with increasing V/Ca ratio, which is due to the transformation of part of the HPO42− group into the HVO42− group after the introduction of vanadium species. The new HVO42− group shows weak acidity, and a part of the strong acidity disappears. It is further proven that the P-O tetrahedral structure is substituted by V-O in the HAP structure. The high-temperature peaks observed for the VOx/HAP samples are almost disappear when V was added. This can be attributed to V2O5 particles covering the surface acidic sites of VOx/HAP. In addition, a new strong peak is observed in the temperature range of 600–800 °C. This high-temperature peak can be attributed to pyrovanadate which was produced by V2O5 at high temperature. V2O5 loaded on HAP for calcination will produce pyrovanadate. Due to the presence of strong acidic pyrovanadate phase, the strong acidic properties of the catalyst will gradually increase under higher loading.

3.2. Catalytic properties
Cyclohexane ODH activity was evaluated in the temperature range of 370–430 °C. A comparison of the activity and the rate of conversion for cyclohexane of VHAP and VOx/HAP are shown in Fig. 7. For the VHAP catalysts, the activity is increased with increasing amount of V, indicating that the introduction of V improves the oxidation activity of VHAP to cyclohexane. The conversion of cyclohexane over the VOx/HAP catalysts is higher than that over VHAP within the experimental temperature range. This result suggests that V2O5 has higher oxidation activity than the tetrahedral vanadium-oxygen structure in the VHAP sample. For the impregnation catalyst, the activity of the catalyst first increases and then decreases with increasing amount of VOx impregnation. VOx/HAP-0.1 shows the highest activity, with a value of up to 17.5% at 430 °C. There are mainly highly dispersed V2O5 species present on the HAP surface for the case when the amount of VOx is low. However, V2O5 can aggregate on the HAP surface when the amount of impregnated V exceeds 0.1 (V/Ca ratio), as also determined from XRD analysis. This indicates that the activity of V2O5 in the monolayer dispersion is better than that in agglomerated V2O5 particles.

Fig. 7. Catalytic activity (a) and the plots of ln(rate) Vs. 1000/T for VHAP and VOx/HAP catalysts (b).
The reaction diagram is shown in Fig. 8. Cyclohexane dehydrogenation follows the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [48]. In the reaction process, oxygen and cyclohexane molecules in the gas phase are adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst. Subsequently, the specific gas phase cyclohexane molecules adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst interact with the lattice oxygen of the high-valence metal oxides (V = O [49]); the result is that cyclohexane is oxidized, and cyclohexyl radicals are formed. After the reaction, the lattice oxygen species are reduced, and the metal oxides existing on the catalyst in the high state are also changed into oxides with a low-valence state(V5+→V4+). The proton from the alcohol hydroxyl group transferred to the adjacent lattice oxygen atom in V-O-Ca because O2− has strong nucleophilic [50]. When lattice oxygen acquired another hydrogen proton from the cyclohexyl radicals, the cyclohexyl radicals was converted to cyclohexene and separated from the catalyst surface. The H on the surface of the catalyst dehydrated with the -OH group to form H2O and oxygen holes were formed on the catalyst. The low-valence oxide is oxidized by gas-phase oxygen to the initial high-valence state, which is added to the lattice oxygen to complete the redox cycle for metal cations on the catalyst. The electrons transfer of cyclohexane molecules adsorbed on the catalyst surface is the rate-controlling step of the reaction. In addition, when cyclohexene as the reactant participated in oxidative dehydrogenation again, cyclohexadiene and benzene were generated. It should be noted that the lattice oxygen atom in P = O also has oxidation activity. However, the activity of P = O is much lower than that V = O, which can be confirmed by the low activity of cyclohexane oxidation catalysed by HAP (not shown in the paper).

Fig. 8. Mechanistic model of the ODH of cyclohexane.
Fig. 9 shows a comparison of the product selectivity for the cyclohexane ODH reaction at 410 °C for the VHAP and VOx/HAP catalysts with V/Ca ratios varying from 0.05 to 0.125. Obviously, the selectivity of the two series of catalysts is very different, which also indicates that the active centres for the two catalysts are different. According to Feng et al.'s report [39], the cyclohexane oxidation process can be divided into three paths: (1) partial oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to produce cyclohexene, which can be further reacted to obtain benzene; (2) direct dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene and further overoxidation to COx; and (3) direct opening of the cyclohexane ring to form COx. Cyclohexene can be considered an intermediate product of the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, so the selectivity of cyclohexene is directly related to the dehydrogenation ability of the catalyst and the desorption process for cyclohexene products.

Fig. 9. The product distribution patterns of the VHAP and VOx/HAP catalysts in the ODH of cyclohexane at 410 °C.
VHAP shows higher cyclohexene selectivity and COx selectivity, which indicates that the reaction rates for pathways (1) and (3) in the VHAP reaction system are higher and that the VHAP catalyst has a suitable oxidative dehydrogenation capacity. However, the higher COx selectivity also indicates that VHAP has a strong CH bond breaking ability, which is related to the strong acidity of VHAP. The VOx/HAP sample shows higher benzene selectivity, which indicates a strong oxidative dehydrogenation capacity. The difference in product selectivity is directly related to the variation in the degree of electrophilicity of the catalyst surface oxygen species. According to the literature reports, dehydrogenation products are mainly produced by ODH of alkanes through nucleophilic lattice oxygen species with a lower activity but higher selectivity, while more reactive electrophilic oxygen species preferentially burn alkanes [43], [44], [45]. Therefore, it can be speculated that the introduction of V reduces the electrophilicity of oxygen on the surface of the catalyst and increases the nucleophilicity of oxygen on the surface. Therefore, the complete oxidation of cyclohexane decreases.
Selectivity towards C6H10, C6H6 and COx as a function of conversion at different reaction temperatures over VHAP and VOx/HAP is illustrated in Fig. 10. There are obvious differences in the selectivity-conversion relationship between the two catalyst systems. The COx selectivity of the VHAP catalyst decreases with increasing conversion, but the C6H10 selectivity changes little with increasing conversion. This indicates that COx is not the product of cyclohexene oxidation but is mainly the product of the direct combustion of cyclohexane. In addition, the selectivity of benzene is increased with increasing conversion rate due to an increase in temperature. At high temperatures, the lattice oxygen mobility is increased, leading to the manifestation of active agent nucleophilic lattice oxygen species, which favour the selective dehydrogenation process, with intermediate cyclohexene more inclined to transform into thermodynamically stable benzene [41]. In addition, the selectivity of C6H10 over the VHAP catalyst containing varying amounts of impregnated V is different. The selectivity of C6H10 increases with increasing amount of impregnated V. This further proves that the introduction of V increases the nucleophilicity of surface oxygen species. For the VOx/HAP catalyst, the selectivity of benzene and cyclohexene is increased and decreased with the conversion rate, respectively, while the COx selectivity shows little change with the conversion rate. This indicates that more benzene is formed through cyclohexene intermediates. In addition, VOx/HAP-0.05 shows significantly higher cyclohexene selectivity and lower benzene selectivity than other impregnated catalysts for the same conversion, which may be related to the V2O5 characteristics of the high dispersion. The dehydrogenation performance of vanadium-based catalysts significantly depends on the surface density and the type of V-O bond [51]. The highly dispersed V species is more conducive to the formation of olefins. However, as the surface density of V increases, crystalline V2O5 forms. The more active V2O5 crystals further oxidize the alkenes to form benzene [52].

4. Conclusions
Vanadium oxide-modified hydroxyapatite (HAP) with a varying amount of vanadium content was synthesized by the coprecipitation method and impregnation method. The physicochemical properties and catalytic performance of these materials in the ODH of cyclohexane were compared. XRD, UV‒Vis and XPS analysis shows that the samples prepared by the impregnation method are mainly composed of V2O5 species, while the samples prepared by the coprecipitation method replace part of the P in the HAP lattice in the form of VO4. The conversion of cyclohexane over VOx/HAP catalysts is higher than that over VHAP, while VHAP shows a higher cyclohexene selectivity. It indicates that the oxidation activity of V2O5 is higher than that of V-O-Ca species. This is because the introduction of V in the HAPs reduces the electrophilicity of surface oxygen and increases the nucleophilicity of surface oxygen; therefore, the VHAP catalyst has a suitable oxidative dehydrogenation capacity.
