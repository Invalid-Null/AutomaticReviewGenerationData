The provided document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically. It reviews various catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in general, but does not focus on PDH vs ODH or make a distinction between them. Since it does not pertain specifically to PDH or ODH, I have indicated that the document is not relevant.
