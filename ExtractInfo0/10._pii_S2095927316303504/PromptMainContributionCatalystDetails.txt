AbstractAbstract
Olefins find widespread applications in the synthesis of polyolefins and fine chemicals. With an increasing demand for olefins, the technologies for alkane dehydrogenation have drawn much attention. Several types of heterogeneous catalysts have found applications in industry for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, mainly ethane, propane, and butane. In the past three decades, a number of transition-metal complexes, particularly pincer-ligated iridium complexes, have been developed as the homogeneous catalysts for alkane dehydrogenations. The homogeneous catalyst systems operate under much milder conditions compared with the heterogeneous systems, and some systems exhibit good activity and high regioselectivity in dehydrogenation of alkanes longer than butane.
1. Introduction
Alkenes are one of the most important and versatile feedstocks in petrochemical industries and organic synthesis. For instance, propene is used for the production of polypropylene (PP) and derivates of propene such as acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, and cumene. Other light alkenes are also important for the synthesis of copolymers and high-octane gasoline additives, such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), and alkylates [1]. The widespread applications have created an increasing demand for various alkenes.
There are several methods available for the synthesis of alkenes. Taking propene as the example again, steam cracking of hydrocarbons and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) from crude oil distillation are two main processes for the production of propene. Approximately 56% of propene is obtained as a coproduct by steam cracking, and approximately 33% is produced as a by-product via FCC [2]. To meet the still growing demand for propene, it is necessary to produce another 7% of propene by several on-purpose technologies like catalytic propane dehydrogenation and metathesis of ethene and butenes [2]. Compared with the low selectivity in the steam cracking and FCC processes, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process can convert one feedstock (e.g., liquefied petroleum gas) into one primary product.
Since the pioneering work by Universal Oil Products (UOP) for the catalytic dehydrogenation of butanes in the 1940s, the technology for alkane dehydrogenation has obtained remarkable progresses, and the reaction has been applied to a variety of alkanes ranging from ethane to heavier n-alkanes (C10−C14). The catalytic alkane dehydrogenation processes can be divided into two parts: heterogeneous catalytic dehydrogenation and homogeneous catalytic dehydrogenation. In fact, the heterogeneous catalytic system has made it out of the laboratory to a pilot test, or even to industrial applications, while the studies of homogeneous catalyst are still at exploration stage. In this review, we describe the features and advantages of both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalyst systems. Some important alkane dehydrogenation progresses are delineated in detail. Due to their significant advance in the past three decades, this review mainly focuses on the development of various transition-metal homogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts. It should be noted that oxidative alkane dehydrogenation reactions with O2 are not covered in this review 3., 4., 5..
2. Heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenations
Up to date, several heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation processes have been commercialized. The heterogeneous catalysts can be classified into three major classes according to the category of metal that acts as the active component: (1) supported chromium catalysts; (2) supported platinum/tin catalysts; and (3) other heterogeneous metal catalysts.
2.1. Supported chromium-catalyzed alkane dehydrogenations
Since the creative work by Frey and Huppke 6., 7., the superior properties of supported chromium catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation have received tremendous attention in industries [8]. The chromium-based catalysts are typically composed of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous alumina support together with doped alkali metals, wherein the Cr2O3 is present in a range of 10%–20% by weight. In addition to alumina, other supports such as zirconia, silica, and magnesium oxide have also been tested 9., 10.. To date, two processes, ABB Lummus CATOFIN and Snamprogetti Yarsintez FBD, have been established commercially.
The CATOFIN process originated from the Houdry CATADIENE process for the dehydrogenation of n-butane. It is an alumina-supported chromium oxide catalyst modified with SiO2 and alkali metal (Li, Na, K) oxide. The catalyst system exhibits good per-pass conversion (55%–60%) and selectivity (88%) for formation of propene at 560–620°C. There is no need to pretreat the feed propane by hydrogenation because the catalyst can tolerate olefins [11].
The FBD process has been used by Snamprogetti for the production of isobutene from isobutane dehydrogenation. The FBD catalyst comprises chromium oxide, alumina, SiO2, Ga2O3, and an alkaline promoter, providing moderate per-pass conversion (50%) and good selectivity (91%) for formation of isobutene at 540–590°C [12].
2.2. Supported platinum/tin-catalyzed alkane dehydrogenations
The platinum-based catalysts are another kind of important heterogeneous systems. In the late 1940s, Haensel [13] reported the first heterogeneous platinum catalyst for paraffin dehydrogenation. In view of their excellent catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions and the ability to form thermally stable dispersions on suitable supports, the platinum has been widely used as an active component in dehydrogenation processes. To modify their catalytic properties, most of the supported platinum-based catalysts contain other inactive metals, preferably tin [1]. Up to now, the so-called supported bimetallic Pt–Sn catalysts have been applied to the following processes: UOP Oleflex, Uhde STAR, and Linde/BASF PDH.
The technology of the Oleflex process was originally developed by UOP in 1990. To date, there are a total of 40 Oleflex units in operation for the production of light olefins. The Oleflex catalyst consists of platinum/tin with an alkali metal promoter on an alumina support, primarily θ-Al2O3 [14]. Compared with other platinum-based catalysts, it not only has a low platinum content (only 0.30 wt%) with improved lifetime (4 years) and productivity, but also has a higher selectivity for formation of olefin products (90% for propene and 91%–93% for isobutene) at 550–650°C.
The Uhde STAR process, which is the acronym for steam active reforming, is a commercially established dehydrogenation technology that was first developed by Phillips Petroleum. The STAR catalyst is composed of platinum/tin on a zinc–calcium aluminate (ZnAl2O4 and CaAl2O4) support materials [15]. It shows excellent dehydrogenation activity with high selectivity (95%) for formation of isobutene. Due to its basic nature, it is also extremely stable in the presence of steam and oxygen at high temperature (570–590°C).
The Linde/BASF PDH process was initially based on the chromia/alumina catalyst developed by BASF in 1982. Recently, a new generation of the PDH catalyst was claimed by BASF, consisting of platinum/tin as the active component and using ZrO2 (mixed with SiO2 in most cases) as the support. Good per-pass conversion (50%) and selectivity (93%) for formation of propene are obtained at 590°C [16].
2.3. Other heterogeneous metal-catalyzed alkane dehydrogenations
With respect to the supported metal catalysts, it is clear that commercially used catalysts based on chromia and platinum/tin will continue to play a major role in dehydrogenation of light alkanes. However, both of them show major drawbacks, including the harmful effects of Cr and the high cost of Pt, which would inevitably limit their applications in dehydrogenations to a certain extent. Therefore, the development of a highly efficient dehydrogenation catalytic system with environmentally friendly and inexpensive metals is highly desirable.
Several novel metal sulfide catalysts have been investigated for alkane dehydrogenations. In 1994, Durante and co-workers [17] found that a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited good selectivity toward isobutane dehydrogenation after sulfidation with dimethyl sulfoxide, affording isobutene in 21% yield. Later, the sulfur-modified Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst prepared by impregnation of ammonium sulfate showed improved catalytic activity for dehydrogenation of isobutane, producing isobutene in >40% yield with a selectivity up to 90%. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed that NiS is the active species [18]. Moreover, environmentally friendly and low-cost Cu, Mn, Co, Mo, and Fe sulfide complexes showed better dehydrogenation performance than the chromium and Pt/Sn-based catalysts before the sulfur loss occurred [19].
Recently, a series of new and eco-friendly supported non-sulfide catalysts, including iron-silicate zeolites, Cs-Ni2P/active carbon, Zn–Nb–O oxides, and monolithic ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC), have also been developed for the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane 20., 21., 22., 23.. Although these systems showed good selectivity for dehydrogenations, their productivities are lower than the supported chromium and Pt/Sn-catalyzed systems.
3. Homogeneous alkane dehydrogenations
Methods for alkane dehydrogenation using the heterogeneous catalysts require harsh reaction conditions (500–900°C), resulting in low energy efficiency and the lack of product selectivity. In contrast, homogeneous catalysts can operate under much milder conditions compared with the heterogeneous catalysts. Some catalyst systems exhibit good regioselectivity for the formation of α-olefins in dehydrogenation of linear alkanes. Pioneered by Felkin group 24., 25., 26. and Crabtree group 27., 28., 29., tremendous progresses have been achieved in the area of homogeneous alkane dehydrogenation. Various transition-metal complexes have been developed for stoichiometric or catalytic alkane dehydrogenations.
3.1. Titanium-mediated stoichiometric alkane dehydrogenations
In 2013, Mindiola and co-workers [30] described the stoichiometric dehydrogenation of alkanes mediated by a PNP pincer titanium complex 1 under very mild conditions with high regioselectivity (Eq. (1)). As shown in Scheme 1, complex 1 first undergoes α-H abstraction and elimination of CH3tBu to generate the transient titanium alkylidyne complex 2, which then reacts with both linear and cyclic alkanes by 1,2-CH bond addition. The sequential β-hydrogen migration forms the dehydrogenation product. Notably, reactions with C4−C8 alkanes provide the corresponding a-olefins regioselectively.

3.2. Rhenium-catalyzed alkane dehydrogenations
Felkin and co-workers 31., 32. reported Re-mediated stoichiometric transfer dehydrogenation of cyclopentane using tert-butylethylene (TBE) as a hydrogen acceptor. Reactions of bis(phosphine) rhenium heptahydrides, ReL2(H)7 (L = PPh3 3a, PEt2Ph 3b), with cyclopentane and TBE at 80°C gave cyclopentadienyl rhenium dihydride complexes 4 at low yields (Eq. (2)).

Later, this stoichiometric reaction was extended to the catalytic transfer dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes CnH2n (n = 6, 7, 8) with TBE as the hydrogen acceptor catalyzed by (PAr3)2Re(H)7 (Ar = Ph 3a, p-F-C6H4 5a, p-Me-C6H4 5b) at 30–80°C (Eq. (3)). The more electron-deficient catalyst 5a exhibited higher reactivity in alkane dehydrogenation than complex 3a. Heating a solution of 5a in the alkane substrate in the presence of TBE at 80°C after 10 min resulted in 4 and 9 turnovers (TOs) for the dehydrogenations of cycloheptane and cyclooctane (COA), respectively [33].

3.3. Ruthenium-catalyzed alkane dehydrogenations
Felkin et al. [25] developed a variety of ruthenium polyhydrides, which exhibited moderate catalytic activity for COA/TBE transfer dehydrogenation. Using complex [(p-F-C6H4)3P]2Ru(H)4, a maximum of 55 TOs was achieved at 150°C for 10 d.
In 1999, Leitner and co-workers [34] reported the acceptorless dehydrogenation of COA using new ruthenium bismethylallyl complexes {Cy2P(CH2)nPCy2}Ru(η3-C4H7)2 (6), bearing chelating bidentate phosphine ligands (Eq. (4)). Leitner’s complex is the first effective ruthenium catalyst for alkane acceptorless dehydrogenation under reflux conditions. Refluxing complex 6a in COA at 170°C provided the dehydrogenation product cyclooctene (COE) with 5.2 TOs in 48 h. The relatively low activity of the catalyst was attributed to the thermal degradation of the ligand.

Recently, Roddick and co-workers [35] reported an electron-deficient ruthenium complex {(CF3)4PCP} Ru(H)(cod) (7) synthesized from the reaction of the strongly π-accepting pincer ligand with [Ru(cod)(2-methylallyl)2]. Using 7 as the precatalyst, the reaction with a 1:1 mixture of COA and TBE at 150 and 200°C gave initial rates of 180 and 1,000 TOs h−1, respectively (Eq. (5)). Moreover, the catalyst system gave 11 TOs with an initial rate of 14 TOs h−1 in the acceptorless dehydrogenation of COA.

3.4. Osmium-catalyzed alkane dehydrogenations
Following their investigation on the {(CF3)4PCP}Ru(II) complexes in alkane dehydrogenation, Roddick and co-workers [36] reported the osmium analogue 8 containing the same ligand for catalytic transfer dehydrogenation of COA with TBE (Eq. (5)). Under conditions similar to that previously reported in Ru-catalyzed dehydrogenation, an initial rate of 1,520 TOs h−1 was observed. Additionally, the Os complexes displayed a significantly increased catalyst lifetime compared with their Ru analogue. Complex 8 also catalyzed the acceptorless dehydrogenation of cyclodecane, giving 125 TOs in 1 h. Remarkably, the catalyst system showed no reduced activity in the presence of N2, H2O, or even O2.
3.5. Rhodium-catalyzed alkane dehydrogenations
While the thermal-driven dehydrogenation of alkanes has been well documented, the light-driven dehydrogenation of alkanes is much less investigated. Nomura and Saito [37] have studied photochemical alkane dehydrogenation using trans-RhCl(CO)(PR3)2 (R = Me 9a, Et 9b, Ph 9c) under mild conditions (Eq. (6)). With 9a as the precatalyst, TOFs of 795 and 650 h−1 for the dehydrogenation of n-heptane and n-octane were obtained, respectively.

Goldman and co-workers 38., 39. carried out elegant mechanistic study for the photochemical alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed by trans-RhCl(CO)(PMe3)2 (9a). The dehydrogenation of COA provided COE with TONs up to 5,000 at 50°C. The intramolecular regioselectivity observed in dehydrogenation of alkylcyclohexanes indicated that the reactions are under kinetic control. Irradiation of 9a in a 1:1 mixture of COA/cyclohexane afforded a 17:1 ratio of COE/cyclohexene. The intermolecular and intramolecular selectivity, as well as the observed kinetic isotope effect, is consistent with a mechanism involving a reversible C–H bond oxidative addition followed by a β-hydrogen elimination.
By using rhodium complex 9a, Goldman and co-workers 40., 41., 42. also developed the thermal transfer dehydrogenation of alkanes under dihydrogen atmosphere. The reaction occurs via the formation of reactive fragment Rh(PMe3)2Cl which thermally dehydrogenates alkanes. Under 68 atm of H2, TONs of 560 and 950 were obtained for the dehydrogenation of COA with norbornene (NBE) at 60 and 100°C, respectively. Higher catalytic activities were observed under moderate H2 pressure when using photochemically inactive complexes Rh(PMe3)2Cl(PR3) (R = iPr, Cy, Me) and [Rh(PMe3)2Cl]2. For example, COA/NBE transfer dehydrogenation under 1.05 atm of H2 at 50°C with Rh(PMe3)2Cl(PiPr3) gave TONs up to 640 after 18 h. The proposed mechanism involves the addition of H2 to the four-coordinate rhodium centers to generate H2Rh(PMe3)2Cl, which then reacts with olefins to produce Rh(PMe3)2Cl.
Very recently, Beller and co-workers [43] reported a catalytic system for the acceptorless alkane dehydrogenation with complex 9a as the photocatalyst (Eq. (7)). In combination with 4,4’-bipyridine, the well-known complex trans-RhCl(CO)(PMe3)2 exhibits excellent activity for dehydrogenation of both cyclic and linear alkanes, and N-containing heterocycles. Note that the light transmittance plays an important role in the reaction; the efficiency of the process increases with decreasing thickness of the glass. The challenging dehydrogenations proceed successfully under benign conditions, thus providing an attractive route to olefinic and aromatic products via dehydrogenation.

3.6. Iridium-catalyzed alkane dehydrogenations
Among the homogeneous catalytic alkane dehydrogenation systems, iridium-catalyzed dehydrogenations have received the most intensive attention. In 1979, Crabtree and co-workers [44] firstly reported the stoichiometric transfer dehydrogenation of alkanes mediated by a homogeneous iridium complex. The cationic complex [Ir(H)2(Me2CO)2(PPh3)2][BF4] (10) was used to dehydrogenate COA and cyclopentane in the presence of TBE at 151°C, generating the iridium complexes of cyclooctadiene and cyclopenta-diene, respectively (Eq. (8)). Following that, Crabtree provided examples of homogeneous catalytic transfer dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes with TONs up to 36 27., 28..

The ground-breaking work was achieved by Jensen and co-workers [45] who reported highly efficient transfer dehydrogenations of COA with TBE catalyzed by pincer-ligated iridium complex. These pincer complexes were originally prepared by Shaw and co-workers [46] in 1970s. They reported the synthesis of bis(phosphine)-based pincer Rh and Ir hydride chloride complexes (tBu4PCP)M(H)Cl (tBu4PCP = C6H3 (CH2PtBu2)2, M = Rh, 11a; M = Ir, 11b) containing tert-butyl substituents on the phosphorus atoms 46., 47., 48., 49., 50., 51., 52.. Such PCP complexes are highly thermally stable and do not decompose within one week at 200°C [53]. In 1996, Jensen and co-workers [45] demonstrated that pincer rhodium and iridium dihydride complexes (tBu4PCP)Rh(H)2 (12a), (tBu4PCP)Ir(H)2 (12b) could efficiently catalyze the transfer dehydrogenation of COA with TBE. The Ir complex is superior to the Rh analogue in terms of activity (Eq. (9)). For example, 12b catalyzed the transfer dehydrogenation of COA to form COE with TOF of 12 min−1, while the reaction with 12a form COE with TOF of 1.8 h−1. Appreciable activity (TOF, 20.5 h−1) was also observed at 100°C for the same transformation when the Ir catalyst was used (Eq. (10)) [45]. Alkane dehydrogenation without hydrogen acceptors was also examined. Refluxing cyclodecane (201°C) with 12b provided 170 and 360 TOs after 4 and 24 h, respectively [54].

Subsequently, Jensen and co-workers [55] reported a method for the conversion of cycloalkanes to form arenes and cycloalkenes using the PCP iridium complex 12b as the catalyst (Scheme 2). For example, the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane at 200°C afforded 86 equivalents of cyclohexene and 77 equivalents of benzene (relative to Ir) after 1 h.

Scheme 2. Transfer dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes by 12b
Using the same catalyst 12b, Jensen and co-workers [56] described the transfer dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and tetrahydrofuran with TBE at 150°C (Scheme 3). Although the activity was lower than that previously obtained for transfer dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes, it represents the first successful case of homogeneous catalytic system for dehydrogenation of saturated C–H bonds in the presence of functionalities.

Scheme 3. Catalytic dehydrogenation with complex 12b
Goldman and co-workers [57] reported a highly efficient acceptorless dehydrogenation of alkanes using a new (PCP)Ir complex (Eq. (11)). Refluxing the complex (iPr4PCP)Ir(H)2 (13) containing iPr substituents on the phosphorus atoms in the pincer ligand in cyclodecane at 201°C afforded 460 and 863 TOs after 1 and 20 h, respectively. This represents one of the most efficient catalyst systems for the acceptorless alkane dehydrogenation under thermal conditions 58., 59..

More interestingly, Goldman and co-workers [60] reported a protocol for regioselective transfer dehydrogenation of n-alkanes. In this work, the pincer iridium complexes 12b and 13 were used to catalyze the transfer dehydrogenation of n-octane at 150°C. Remarkably, the thermodynamically least stable 1-octene constitutes more than 90% of the total octene products within the first 5 min of the reaction, although the terminal olefin will be eventually isomerized to internal olefins.
Later, Jensen and co-workers [61] demonstrated that the Ir(III) hydrido hydroxyl complex (tBu4PCP)Ir(H)(OH) (15) is active for catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes. Complex 15 can be formed upon the oxidative addition of water to the 14-electron intermediate 14 (Eq. (12)). In the absence of water, complex 15 can dehydrogenate COA to form COE at an initial rate of 1,200 TOs h−1 at 200°C.

Since the pioneering work of Kaska, Jensen, and Goldman, the alkane dehydrogenations catalyzed by pincer iridium complexes have received significant attention. During the past decade, various types of pincer iridium complexes have been prepared. Most of the new iridium complexes are based on the modification of the parent (PCP)Ir system with one carbon and two phosphorus atoms as the donors to the metal center. Few other pincer iridium complexes with pyridine or carbene moieties in the ligand have also been studied for alkane dehydrogenation. There are mainly three strategies for the modification of PCP ligands: (1) variation of substituents on the phosphorus atoms and substituents at the para-position of the aromatic backbones; (2) variation of the aromatic backbones; and (3) variation of the linkers connecting the backbone and two phosphorus atoms.
In 2004, Goldman and co-workers [62] investigated the dehydrogenation of alkanes with the p-methoxy-substituted PCP pincer iridium complexes at 250°C (Eq. (13)). Both (MeO-tBu4PCP)Ir(H)2 (16a) and (MeO-iPr4PCP)IrH4 (16b-H4) showed higher activities than the parent complex 12b for the acceptorless dehydrogenation of cyclodecane. In particular, the less crowded complex 16b-H4 provided high efficiency with a total of 2,970 TOs after 48 h under the refluxing condition. However, the p-methoxy substitution did not significantly improve catalytic activity in the acceptorless dehydrogenation of n-undecane.

In 2009, Goldman and co-workers [63] also developed some new iridium pincer complexes with one tBu group being replaced by one Me group. The sterically less bulky (tBu3MePCP)IrH4 (17) is indeed a more efficient catalyst precursor than 12b and 13 for alkane dehydrogenation. However, a further substitution of the tBu group by another Me group does not lead to a better catalyst. In contrast, (tBu2Me2PCP)IrH4 (18) is less active than complex 17 (Eq. (14)). It is not clear whether the reduced activity of 18 relative to 17 is due to the energetics of the actual catalytic cycle or the deactivation of complex 18 via facile formation of clusters (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. Deactivated products of complex 18 through dimerization
In 2010, Goldman and co-workers [64] designed a highly stable adamantyl-substituted pincer iridium catalyst 19 for alkane dehydrogenation at high temperature (250°C) (Eq. (15)). Parallel dehydrogenations of n-octane and COA at 250°C revealed that (Ad4PCP)Ir is thermally more robust than the (tBu4PCP)Ir and (iPr4PCP)Ir analogues. The new complex exhibits lower rate for the acceptorless dehydrogenation of cyclodecane than (tBu4PCP)Ir(H)2 12b and (iPr4PCP)IrH4 within 3 h at 230°C, but outperforms the latter after 72 h in terms of productivity.

In 2012, Roddick and co-workers [65] reported alkane dehydrogenations using a novel iridium complex with fluorinated pincer ligand {(CF3)4PCP}Ir(cod). This complex exhibited moderate activity for transfer dehydrogenation of COA with TBE (1:1), providing TONs up to 660 at 200°C after 58 h with an initial rate of 40 h−1. By using a COA/TBE ratio of 5:1, TONs were increased to 2,850 after 24 h with higher initial activity (155 h−1). The catalyst is not very sensitive to COE product, N2 and H2O compared to other iridium systems. The acceptorless dehydrogenation of cyclodecane was also carried out at 190°C, giving modest TONs (92 after 24 h).
In 2001, Hall and co-workers [66] investigated iridium complexes 20a and 20b containing an anthraphos backbone in the ligands for alkane dehydrogenation (Eq. (16)). As matter as a fact, 20a exhibits the highest thermostability among the pincer iridium catalysts reported so far for alkane dehydrogenations. It is stable in alkane solutions at a temperature as high as 250°C. The acceptorless dehydrogenation of cyclododecane at 250°C catalyzed by 20a afforded 136 TOs after 148 h.

In 2006, Koridze and co-workers [67] synthesized novel bis(phosphine) pincer complexes 21 based on ferrocene and ruthenocene backbones (Eq. (17)). These two complexes exhibited high catalytic activities in the transfer dehydrogenation of COA with TBE, giving 3,300 and 2,571 TOs at 180°C after 8 h, respectively.

In 2013, Yamamoto and co-workers [68] reported the synthesis of PCP pincer iridium precatalysts bearing fused ring backbones {(7-6-7-R4PCP)Ir(H)Cl} (R = iPr, 22a; R = Cy, 22b) and {(7-6-7-Ph4PCP)Ir(H)(Cl)(MeCN)} (22c) (Eq. (18)). The presumably active species {(7-6-7-iPr4PCP)Ir} was generated in situ by activation with NaOtBu, similar to the procedure reported by Brookhart and co-workers [69]. It exhibits very high activity for the transfer dehydrogenation of COA with TBE at 230°C, giving 4,820 TOs after 24 h. Complex 22c with Ph substituents is less active than 22a and 22b for dehydrogenations, presumably due to its poor solubility in the reaction system.

In 2014, Wendt and co-workers [70] successfully synthesized a pincer iridium complex with a cyclohexyl backbone (tBu4PCyP)Ir(H)Cl. The complex undergoes a fast decomposition at 200°C, and showed low catalytic activity (~50 TOs) for transfer dehydrogenation of a 1:1 mixture of COA and TBE upon the activating of NaOtBu. With a 1:300:7,200 ratio of cat:TBE:COA at 120°C, TONs up to 200 were observed. The acceptorless dehydrogenation of COA by this complex gave only 5 TOs at 150°C.
In the same year, Brookhart and co-workers [71] reported PC(sp3)P iridium complexes of triptycene ligands. While complexes bearing cyclohexyl and Cp substituents on the triptycene backbone exhibited low catalytic activities (TONs ≈ 40 after 24 h) for COA/TBE transfer dehydrogenation, the less crowded complex bearing isopropyl substituent was found to dehydrogenate COA efficiently, giving TONs of 910 and 2,820 after 30 min and 24 h at 200°C, respectively. The catalytic system also demonstrated high activity for n-octane/TBE transfer dehydrogenation (TONs up to 6,000 after 10 h at 200°C). When the reaction temperature was decreased to 100°C, a selectivity of 27% for the formation of 1-octene was obtained after 1 h.
In 2004, Brookhart and co-workers [69] synthesized a series of resorcinol-derived bis(phosphinite)-based pincer iridium complexes (p-X-POCOP)Ir(H)Cl with oxygen atoms as the linkers between the phosphorus atoms and the aromatic backbones (Eq. (19)). Upon activation with 1.1 equiv. NaOtBu, the new bis(phosphinite)-based pincer complexes (tBu4POCOP)Ir(H)Cl (23a–f) proved to be more active by one magnitude than the (PCP)Ir system for the transfer dehydrogenation of COA with TBE [45]. TOs ranging from 1,400 to 2,100 (up to 72% conversion in TBE) and TOFs ranging from 1.6 to 2.4 s−1 have been obtained at 200°C (Eq. (20)). However, the (POCOP)Ir system showed lower activity for the transfer dehydrogenation of linear alkanes compared with the (PCP)Ir system 72., 73..

In the same year, Jensen and co-workers [74] reported the synthesis of (iPr4POCOP)Ir(H)Cl and (iPr4POCOP)IrH4 24 with iPr substituents (Scheme 4). The (iPr4POCOP)Ir-catalyzed transfer dehydrogenation of COA with TBE at 200°C resulted in a TOF of 13 min−1. The activity is slightly higher than those previously observed for complexes 12b and 13. Acceptorless dehydrogenation of n-undecane with 24 resulted in only 1.8% conversion. They showed that the α-olefins can be isomerized to form the internal olefins easily under the reaction conditions. The activity of this pincer catalyst is subject to product inhibition.

Scheme 4. Dehydrogenation of n-undecane by complex 24 and the fast isomerization of α-olefin products
Mechanistic investigations by Goldman and co-workers [75] and Brookhart and co-workers [76] revealed that the COA/TBE transfer dehydrogenations catalyzed by (PCP)Ir and (POCOP)-Ir catalysts undergo a very similar reaction pathway (Scheme 5). Following the insertion of TBE into the Ir–H bond of an Ir(III) dihydride complex, reductive elimination of TBA forms an intermediacy of a three-coordinate 14-electron Ir(I) species. This intermediate then undergoes oxidative addition of COA via C–H bond activation to give the alkyl hydrido Ir(III) complex. Finally β-hydride elimination results in the formation of cyclooctene and regeneration of the Ir(III) dihydride. The difference between the (PCP)Ir and (POCOP) Ir systems is the resting states in the presence of high concentration of TBE; the former is prone to formation of an Ir(III)(vinyl)(hydride) species via oxidative addition of TBE, while the latter forms a π-coordinated iridium complex. As a result, the (PCP)Ir system is subject to TBE inhibition, while the (POCOP)Ir system maintains good activity in the presence of high TBE concentration. Furthermore, the alkene hydrogenation by (POCOP)Ir(H)2 is more facile than that by (PCP)Ir(H)2. Evidences showed that the reactivity difference between these two systems is mainly due to the geometric difference. For complexes containing the same substituents on the phosphorus atoms, the (POCOP)Ir complex with “O” as the linkers is much less sterically hindered than the (PCP)Ir analogue with “CH2” as the linkers [77].

Scheme 5. Proposed mechanism of COA/TBE transfer dehydrogenation catalyzed by (tBu4PCP)Ir(H)2 (a) and (tBu4POCOP)Ir(H)2 (b)
The comparison of the catalytic activity and mechanism between the (PCP)Ir and (POCOP)Ir systems indicates that the subtle change of the linkers in the pincer ligands leads to a dramatic change in their performance in dehydrogenations. Very recently, Huang and co-workers [78] reported a PSCOP-type pincer Ir complex 25 with a hybrid phosphinothious/phosphinite ligand using S and O atoms as the linkers. Upon activation with NaOtBu, complex 25 is highly active for transfer dehydrogenation of both linear and cyclic alkanes at 200°C. With a COA:TBE:25 ratio of being 6,000:6,000:1, the reaction occurs to form COE and TBA with 98% conversion based on TBE, with TONs up to 5,900 after 15 h. This catalyst system represents one of the most active systems for homogeneous catalytic COA/TBE transfer dehydrogenation. More interestingly, the (PSCOP)Ir complex catalyzed the transfer dehydrogenation of n-octane with TBE at a temperature as low as 100°C, affording α-olefin regioselectively (Eq. (21)). For instance, 1-octene accounts for 100% of the total dehydrogenation product within the first hour at 100°C and was still the major product after 8 h.

Iridium dehydrogenation catalysts have not been limited to the pincer complexes with two P atoms and a central C atom as the donors. Recently, Huang and co-workers [79] disclosed the synthesis and characterization of (NCP)Ir(H)Cl complexes, in which one of the phosphinite arms in the (POCOP)Ir complexes is replaced by a pyridine group. The steric properties of the Ir center can be tuned by the modification of the substituent at the 2-position of the pyridine ring (26a, R = H; 26b, R = Me; 26c, R = tBu). Upon activation with NaOtBu, the NCP Ir system is active for transfer dehydrogenations of both linear and cyclic alkanes, but their catalytic activities are much lower than the classic bis(phosphine) and bis(phosphinite)-based pincer systems (Eq. (22)). Among the three NCP iridium complexes, the least sterically hindered complex 26a is most effective, giving 78 TOs in the transfer dehydrogenation of n-octane with TBE. The regioselectivity for 1-octene is very low. Independent experiments on Ir-catalyzed isomerization of 1-octene to internal octenes revealed that the NCP Ir complexes are highly active olefin isomerization catalysts.

In 2014, Jensen and co-workers [80] reported the alkane dehydrogenations catalyzed by an arsenic-based pincer iridium complex 27. The novel iridium complex was used to catalyze transfer dehydrogenation of COA with TBE, affording a maximum TON of 960 at 175°C after 24 h (Eq. (23)). A comparison between this new arsenic-based pincer iridium complex and the parent (POCOP)Ir complex 23c indicated that the former is somewhat less active than the latter. Jensen showed that increasing the reaction temperature can improve the activity of complex 27 for alkane dehydrogenation, but it is subject to thermal decomposition, thus limiting its performance at temperatures higher than 175°C.

The CCC iridium complexes 28 containing bis-N-heterocyclic carbenes were prepared by Chianese et al. 81., 82., 83.. These complexes are active for acceptorless dehydrogenations of both linear and cyclic alkanes, albeit with lower activity compared with the classical PCP or POCOP systems (Eq. (24)). The acceptorless dehydrogenation of COA and n-undecane gave 103 and 97 TOs, respectively. Notably, the iridium CCC pincer complexes show high initial turnover frequencies, but the decomposition of the catalyst appears to limit conversions.

In 2011, Zuo and Braunstein [84] developed similar bis(carbene)-based pincer iridium complex 29 for transfer dehydrogenation of COA in the presence of TBE at 200°C (Eq. (25)). The new complex showed low catalytic activity at reaction temperatures ranging from 150 to 250°C.

In 2013, Goldberg and co-workers [85] reported the stoichiometric alkane dehydrogenation mediated by a new bis(oxazolinyl) pincer Ir(III) complex 30 (Eq. (26)). A striking feature of this systems is that the dehydrogenation occurs at Ir(III), in contrast to early reports of dehydrogenation with Ir. In addition, the dehydrogenation process is not inhibited by water, olefin, and nitrogen, which is an issue for the (PCP)Ir-catalyzed alkane dehydrogenation. However, catalytic alkane dehydrogenation did not succeed with this new system.

Along with the dehydrogenation of simple alkanes with homogenous iridium catalysts, Coats and co-workers [86] reported the dehydrogenation of aliphatic polyolefins to produce unsaturated hydrocarbon polymers at 150°C using the p-methoxy-substituted (PCP)Ir catalysts 16 (Eq. (27)). They found that the dehydrogenation of poly(1-hexene) mainly occurred at the terminal position of repeated monomer units by comparison with the known samples of octenes, and the terminal C–C double bonds can easily be isomerizated to internal C–C double bonds under the reaction conditions.

Alkane metathesis reaction is a process with potential application in conversion of the low-value short alkanes derived from refinery and petrochemical streams and Fischer-Tropsch process to liquid fuels. Goldman and co-workers [87] developed a tandem dual-catalytic system for alkane metathesis. The system contains one catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation and the other catalyst for olefin metathesis. A combination of the pincer-ligated iridium dehydrogenation catalysts (12b, 16b, or 31) and a homogeneous (Schrock’s metathesis catalyst) or a heterogeneous (Re2O7/γ-Al2O3) catalyst proved to be effective for alkane metathesis (Scheme 6). For example, heating complex 16b and Re2O7/γ-Al2O3 in n-decane (5.1 mol/L) at 175°C provided C2–C34 alkane products, with overall product concentrations of being 1.63 and 4.37 mol/L after 3 h and 9 d, respectively.

Scheme 6. Metathesis of n-decane (5.1 mol/L) by a combination of the pincer Ir catalyst and Re2O7/γ-Al2O3 in 175°C: distribution of C2 to C34 n-alkanes products
The conversion of simple and low-value alkanes to aromatic compounds is a reaction with enormous applicability. Very recently, Goldman and co-workers [88] reported that the pincer iridium complexes catalyze dehydroaromatization of alkanes to form arenes. Among the various pincer iridium complexes screened, complexes 32a, 32b, and 32c proved to be most effective for the dehydroaromatization reaction (Eq. (28)). For example, using 32b as a precatalyst, the reaction of n-hexane afforded benzene in 44% yield after 120 h at 165 °C The dehydroaromatization of n-octane gave higher yields of aromatic products than that with n-hexane; the dehydroaromatization catalyzed by 32b resulted in a 99% conversion of n-octane and 86% yield of C8 aromatics, with o-xylene and ethylbenzene as the dominant products after 118 h. The reactions of n-dodecane and n-decane afforded alkylarenes with high selectivity for the corresponding o-(n-alkyl) toluene. The possible pathway for the dehydroaromatization involves multiple dehydrogenation and olefin isomerization to produce a conjugated triene, which undergoes electrocyclization and transfer dehydrogenation to deliver the aromatic product (Scheme 7).

Scheme 7. Possible mechanism for the dehydroaromatization of n-hexane
In addition to alkanes, the dehydrogenation of a variety of functionalized substrates can also be carried out using iridium pincer complexes. Jensen and co-workers 89., 90., 91. reported the efficient and selective dehydrogenation of N-heterocyclic substrates catalyzed by (PCP)Ir complexes 12b and 13 and POCOP Ir complex 23c, which hold the potential for hydrogen-storage applications. Huang and co-workers [78] reported the transfer dehydrogenation reaction of N-heterocyclic and O-heterocyclic substrates catalyzed by (PSCOP)Ir complex 25. Goldman and co-workers [92] described the (PCP)Ir-catalyzed dehydrogenation of tertiary amines to form enamines.
Considering that the immobilization of pincer complexes can allow for the recycling of the catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation and that the supported catalyst may be more robust and effective than the corresponding molecular catalysts. Recently, Brookhart and co-workers [93] prepared Merrifield resin-, silica-, and γ-Al2O3-supported pincer iridium complexes and investigated their activity for alkane dehydrogenation. The POCOP pincer catalysts supported by Merrifield resin and silica showed low to moderate activity for the COA/TBE transfer dehydrogenation reaction. However, the γ-Al2O3-supported POCOP Ir complexes 33, 34, bearing basic functional groups at the para-position of the aromatic backbone were found to be highly active and recyclable for COA/TBE transfer dehydrogenation, giving TONs up to 7,000 at 240°C (Eq. (29)).

3.7. Platinum-catalyzed alkane dehydrogenations
In the past years, several groups have made progress toward the conversion of alkanes to alkenes with platinum complexes 94., 95., 96., 97., 98., 99., 100., but most of them were stoichiometric reactions (TONs: 1.1–1.3). Moreover, these reactions were often accompanied by a fast decomposition of the catalyst into platinum black.
In 2009, Vedernikov and co-workers [101] developed several new lipophilic tBu2dpb platinum complexes 35–38 (Scheme 8) and used the cyclohexene hydrido complex 35 to catalyze the transfer dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes with TBE (Eq. (30)). TONs of 11, 15, and 7.5 were obtained for the reactions of cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and COA, respectively, at 100°C after 1 d. Notably, no platinum black was observed in these reactions.

4. Conclusion
Heterogeneous dehydrogenation catalysts have been successfully used in industry, but these catalysts are based on toxic chromium or precious platinum metal. These catalytic systems have found applications in dehydrogenation of light C2–C4 alkanes, which proceeded under high temperature with limited product selectivity. On the other hand, homogeneous catalysts for alkane hydrogenations have made tremendous progresses in the last three decades. So far the most successful catalyst systems are the thermally stable pincer-type iridium complexes. In spite of the great advance, the known homogenous catalytic alkane dehydrogenations still suffer from relatively harsh reaction conditions (typically >150°C), narrow substrate scope, and low product selectivity (Table 1). The development of new efficient dehydrogenation catalysts with higher regioselectivity and better functional group tolerance is desirable. In addition, new dehydrogenation catalysts based on earth-abundant and low-cost metals will be a welcome addition in this area.
