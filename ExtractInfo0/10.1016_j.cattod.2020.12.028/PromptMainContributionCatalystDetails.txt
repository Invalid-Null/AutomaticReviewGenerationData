1. Introduction
Light olefins are among the most important and versatile feedstocks in the petrochemical and fine chemical industries. With an increasing demand for olefins, processes for alkane dehydrogenation have gained considerable attention, solely because they provide a potential route to obtain olefins from low cost saturated hydrocarbons [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]]. Although the selective activation of CC and CH bonds proves to be a challenge, attributing to the stable nature of alkanes, transition metals can activate saturated hydrocarbons [3]. The production of olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is being practised commercially, however, due to the highly endothermic nature of the reaction, high temperatures are required to achieve economically attractive yields [9]. Under these severe conditions, undesirable side reactions such as cracking and hydrogenolysis are inevitable. In addition, coke is rapidly formed at these elevated temperatures, which leads to catalyst deactivation and the catalytic processes generally require regeneration of the catalysts [10]. Platinum and chromium based catalysts are commonly used industrial catalysts. However, the high cost of platinum and hazardous effects of chromium limit their application to some extent [2,[11], [12], [13], [14]].
Nickel based catalysts may be used as an alternative in dehydrogenation reactions, since these metal species are known to be active in various reactions, such as hydrogenation, water-gas shift and steam reforming of methane and ethanol [11,12,15,16]. Resasco et al. showed that nickel catalysts displayed high catalytic activity but low selectivity toward olefins in isobutane dehydrogenation. Instead, cracking reactions occurred at a rapid rate, with methane and coke being generated in relatively large quantities [17]. Wang and co-workers found that various sulfided catalysts, prepared either by impregnation with sulfate or sulfided with H2S, displayed promising performance in alkane dehydrogenation. It was found that the introduction of sulfur on nickel oxide catalysts decreases coking and increases the dehydrogenation activity of the catalysts significantly, despite sulfur being known to poison catalysts [12,18]. The promoting effects of sulfur can be explained in terms of two aspects. The first is the geometric effect, which dilute aggregated metal species, thereby inhibiting CC bond rupture. The second aspect is an electronic effect to facilitate alkene desorption, leading to increased selectivity of products [2]. Nickel based catalysts, including nickel sulfided catalysts, have been proven to be active for propane dehydrogenation. In the case of nickel-sulfided catalysts, sulfur is added to the reaction stream in order to maintain catalyst selectivity for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene [[19], [20], [21]].
Furthermore, the effect of support plays a significant role in the performance of catalysts [16,22]. Interactions between catalytically active metals and supports have been linked to a wide range of physical and chemical observations, which is related to stability, activity and selectivity of the catalysts [23]. Generally, a support with a high surface area is imperative for nickel dispersion and improving thermal stability, thereby providing more active sites as well as decreasing deactivation over time due to sintering [16]. The most commonly used catalyst supports in industry include SiO2 and Al2O3 [24]. Due its excellent thermostability, availability, relatively high surface area and inertness, SiO2 is widely used for preparing supported nickel based catalysts [25,26]. Recently, there has been growing interest in the utilization of magnesium aluminate spinel, MgAl2O4, as catalyst support in the field of environmental catalysis, petroleum processing and fine chemicals productions [27]. MgAl2O4 offers a combination of desirable properties such as chemical inertness, high thermal stability and increased coke resistance [24,28,29]. The addition of alkaline earth-metals to λ-Al2O3 reduces the acidity of the support and therefore the formation of undesirable by-products. These promoters are usually added to the support in order to improve the dispersion of the metal catalyst and to prevent the formation of an inactive metal-aluminate phase. Some studies have shown that the addition of MgO to Al2O3 improves the performance of nickel based catalysts in reactions and that the MgAl2O4 spinel suspends the phase transformation to NiAl2O4 spinel and thus stabilizes the nickel crystallites in the catalyst [30]. Metal sulfide materials are a relatively new class of dehydrogenation catalysts. Although they have been prepared on various supports, not much attention has been paid to the effects of supports on the physicochemical properties of the catalyst such as textural properties, particle size, acidity and metal support interactions and its relation to activity, selectivity and stability of the catalysts. In this study, an in-depth investigation on the dehydrogenation of propane over sulfur promoted nickel-based catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 and SiO2 is performed. The catalysts have been characterized using various analytical techniques in order to determine the structural and electronic properties of the catalysts, which are important for understanding the activity, selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation reactions.
2. Experimental
2.1. Raw materials
The following chemicals were used in the study: Silica gel (Davisil Grade 643, Sigma Aldrich), magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (98%, Sigma Aldrich), aluminium nitrate nonahydrate (≥98 %, Sigma Aldrich), oxalic acid (99.5 %, LabChem), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (≥97 %, Sigma Aldrich), ammonium sulfate (99 %, LabChem) and propane gas. Distilled water is obtained by a house supply that produces Milli-Q water.
2.2. Catalyst preparation: Synthesis of MgAl2O4 support, supported NiO catalysts and sulfur modified catalysts
The synthesis of MgAl2O4 was performed using a sol-gel combustion method proposed by Nassar and co-workers [31]. An aqueous solution (30 mL) of Mg(NO3)2.6H2O (4 g, 15.6 mmol) was added to a stirring solution (50 mL) of Al(NO3)2.9H2O (12 g, 31.2 mmol) and the reaction was heated to 60 °C, while stirring for 10 min. To the hot stirring mixture, oxalic acid dissolved in distilled water was added and the reaction was heated to 80 °C while stirring for a further 60 min. The solution then formed a gel, while heating and stirring at 120 °C of the reaction. The gel was heated in an oven at 200 °C for 2 h to give a dry, white mass, which was then ignited in an electric furnace at 350 °C for 10 min. The produced powder was then ground and calcined at 700 °C for 4 h to give the final MgAl2O4 product.
The loading of Ni by weight was 13 wt% Ni for all catalysts. Nickel oxide catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 and SiO2 were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using Ni(NO3)2.6H2O as the metal precursor. After impregnation of the supports, the catalysts were dried at 140 °C overnight and calcined at 700 °C in air for 2 h and 6 h for the catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 and SiO2, respectively to convert them to the oxide form.
The sulfur modified catalysts were prepared with loadings of 20 wt% SO42− (Ni:S, 1:1). The sulfur catalysts were obtained by sequential impregnation of the supports with aqueous Ni(NO3)2.6H2O and (NH4)2SO4 solutions respectively. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 140 °C overnight and calcined at 700 °C in air for 2 h on the MgAl2O4 support and 4 h on the SiO2 support [12,16].
2.3. Characterisation
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the samples were performed on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance Diffractometer (Cu-Kα radiation λKα1 = 1.5406 Å) 40 kV running from 5 to 90 ° in the 2θ range. The surface area measurements and porosity analysis were determined by nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at −196 °C using the Micromeritics 3 FLEX analyzer. Approximately 0.3 g of sample was degassed overnight with a constant flow of nitrogen gas over the sample in order to remove atmospheric moisture from the sample. The specific surface areas were determined by the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) and Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs were obtained using a high resolution SEM EHT 5.00 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were performed on a high resolution Tecnai F20. All samples were loaded on a copper grid and carbon coated before imaging. A ZEISS MERLIN SEM instrument was used for STEM imaging and X-ray mapping of samples. The setting for the imaging was at a working distance of 9.5 mm with a beam strength of 20 kV and probe current of 10 nA, using a backscattered electron detector. Samples were prepared by mounting the catalyst evenly on carbon tape and sputter coated with gold at 10 mm and 10 nm. The STEM detector was used at a 20 kV beam strength and 250 pA probe current with a 4 mm working distance. Samples were prepared by 10 x dilution, then pipetted onto the TEM grid and air dried. Urinyl acetate was used for negative staining and samples were left to dry in darkness before loading onto a STEM stub and into the MERLIN SEM instrument. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a simultaneous analyzer (STA) 8000, in order to investigate the thermal stability of the catalysts. Approximately 0.03 g of sample was placed in the sample holder. The sample was then heated at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min from 30 °C – 1000 °C under a flow of argon gas. The acidic properties of the samples were determined using the Micromeritics Autochem II by temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD). For each test, 0.025 g of sample was loaded into the reactor tube, degassed at 500 °C for 20 min under a 30 mL/min flow of helium gas and allowed to cool at 120 °C. The sample was then exposed to 5 % NH3, which was adsorbed at 120 °C for 30 min at a flow rate of 15 mL/min. Subsequently, helium was allowed to flow over the sample to remove any physically adsorbed NH3 present on the catalyst. Ultimately, desorption was measured at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under helium flowing at a rate of 25 mL/min with the temperature increasing from 100 °C – 900 °C. The amount of desorbed NH3 was calculated from the area under the TPD curve. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to analyze the structural changes of the sulfur modified catalysts. The spectroscopic analysis was carried out using a Perkin Elmer UATR two FTIR spectrometer. Prior to FTIR analysis, samples were heated to 400 °C for 2 h under a flow of nitrogen gas to remove any surface impurities and moisture. Approximately 10 mg of the catalyst was placed on the Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) diamond crystal and the force gauge was gently applied on the sample. The spectra were recorded at ambient room temperature in the wavenumber range 400 – 4000 cm−1 by collecting 100 scans at a 4 cm-1 resolution. The reduction temperature of the catalysts was measured using temperature programmed reduction (TPR) analysis. Roughly 0.025 g was placed in the sample holder followed by the preparation of a cold trap, which consists of a mixture of ice and acetone. The gases, hydrogen and argon, which are blended in a fixed proportion of 10 H2-Ar, flowed through the sample at a rate of 50 mL/min and a baseline reading was established by the detector at room temperature. The temperature was then raised from 25 °C – 900 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min. When the critical temperature was reached, hydrogen atoms in the gas mixture reacted with the sample, forming H2O, which was removed from the gas stream using the cold trap.
2.4. Catalytic evaluation
The catalytic activity was evaluated using a fixed bed quartz microreactor (i.d. 14 mm, length 600 mm) at 600 °C and atmospheric pressure. The sulfur modified catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 and SiO2 were evaluated in both the oxide form (NiO-based) and reduced form (Ni-based). To synthesise the Ni-based catalysts, the NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalysts were reduced ex-situ under a flow of pure H2 (50 mL/min, 550 °C, 4 h) to form Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4, which were then also investigated for the dehydrogenation of propane. For the tests, 1 g of the selected catalyst (NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4, NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4, Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 or Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4) was loaded into the reactor, followed by flowing propane into the reactor, diluted by nitrogen with a molar ratio of 1:1, with a total flow rate of 30 mL/min. The products obtained were analysed using a Bruker 450-GC. Gas products were analysed on a BR-Alumina Na2SO4 column. Propane conversion and product selectivity were calculated using the formulas shown below. The conversion % was calculated with the assumption that feed (out) is unconverted propane.
The product selectivity was calculated for each component
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural and textural properties of modified and unmodified catalysts
The X-ray diffraction patterns of NiO-based catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 and SiO2 are shown in Fig. 1 below. The reflections corresponding to the MgAl2O4 phase occur at 19°, 31°, 45°, 59° and 65° 2θ angles. The diffraction peaks corresponding to MgAl2O4 can be indexed to the cubic spinel structure of the MgAl2O4 support [31]. The possibility of intermediate products have not been detected in the support, as indicated by the absence of peaks in the XRD pattern corresponding to products such as MgO and Al2O3, which consequently confirm the single phase of the as-synthesised MgAl2O4 support. An amorphous peak at 2θ 22° is present for SiO2, which is typical for this material [32]. The peaks present in the 2θ regions 37°, 43°, 63°, 75° and 79° correspond to NiO dispersed on the MgAl2O4 and SiO2 supports, respectively.

The peaks in the 2θ region 20−35° correspond to NiSO4 species on both the NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalysts [33]. Peaks matching MgSO4 are present in the XRD pattern of NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4, indicating that SO42− reacted with both the nickel particles and the MgAl2O4 support. Peaks matching NiO are present at 2θ 43° and 63° in NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4, which could indicate that not all the NiO particles have been sulfated on the MgAl2O4 support. The possibility of hydrated NiSO4.6H2O was detected on the NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalyst. XRD analysis provides evidence that NiO/MgAl2O4 and NiO/SiO2 were both successfully modified using (NH4)2SO4 as the sulfiding agent, however, it was noted through elemental analysis (S1) that the ratio of Ni:S was not equal to 1:1 (20 wt% SO4) on both NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 samples.
The crystallite size of nickel based particles was calculated using the Scherrer equation. The peak at 2θ 37°, was used to calculate the crystallite size of unsupported NiO and was equal to 26 nm. The corresponding peak in the 2θ region of 37° was used to calculate the crystallite size of NiO in the XRD patterns of NiO/MgAl2O4 and NiO/SiO2 and was equal to 7 nm and 16 nm, respectively. This drastic change in the crystallite size of NiO was expected on both supports, while the crystallite size of NiO supported on MgAl2O4 decreases significantly, implying that the NiO particles could be better dispersed on the MgAl2O4 support compared to the SiO2 support. The crystallite size of NiSO4 on NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 are 16 nm and 27 nm, respectively. These results suggest that NiSO4 could consist of smaller particles on the MgAl2O4 support.
The XRD patterns of the reduced catalysts, Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 showed the presence of the Ni3S2 phase, which is the primary species of sulfur in the catalyst. However, for Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4, it was found that sulfur interacted with the MgO in the support to form MgSO4 species. This was not the case for Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 due to the inert nature of the silica support. The crystallite size of Ni3S2 was calculated, using the Scherrer equation, as 13 nm on the Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 catalyst. For Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4, the crystallite size of Ni3S2 was calculated to 24 nm. The difference in peak intensity and crystallite size of the sulfur-modified catalysts, obtained from XRD analysis, suggest that the particles are much larger on the SiO2 support in comparison to the MgAl2O4 support, which could consist of smaller particles with better dispersive properties.
Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 2a and b below. All the samples display type IV isotherms and type H1 hysteric loops, which is indicative of mesopores present in the catalysts. [19,34]

Table 1 contains a summary of the BET surface area and the crystallite size of the Ni species in the various catalysts on the MgAl2O4 and SiO2 supports. The NiO/MgAl2O4 and NiO/SiO2 catalysts displayed surface areas of 79 m2/g and 236 m2/g, respectively. It was noted that doping both MgAl2O4 and SiO2 with 13 wt% nickel had no significant effect on the surface area of the pure support, indicating that the pores of the support are not blocked by the metal species. The surface area decreased to 36 m2/g and 179 m2/ for the NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalysts, respectively. The decrease in surface area could imply that the addition of SO42− cause the nickel species to aggregate to some extent. These results contrast those found in the literature, whereby the effect of the sulfate anion on metal oxide catalysts, reduces grain sizes and increases the surface area. [35] This could be due to small sulfated particles clustering together to form agglomerates and contributing to an increase in crystallite size, accompanied by a decrease in surface area as observed in the BET results.

Interestingly, the reduced catalysts containing Ni3S2 particles, Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4, showed an increase in surface area equal to 45 m2/g and 236 m2/g, respectively. The increase in surface area upon reduction could be due to change in particle size upon reduction of the catalysts, as observed by XRD analysis.
3.2. Morphology
The dispersion of nickel and sulfur over MgAl2O4 and SiO2 supports can be seen through electron mapping images shown in Fig. 3.1 below. Visual evidence of SO42− interacting with MgAl2O4 can be observed in NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 (Fig. 3.1.a). Furthermore, sulfur particles seem denser on the reduced Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 catalyst than the NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 catalyst as observed in Fig. 3.1.b below. Large clusters of NiSO4 particles were observed on NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 (Fig. 3.1.c). The absence of NiSO4 clusters on NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 could propose that the sulfated complex is better dispersed on the MgAl2O4 support. Electron mapping of individual nickel atoms and sulfur atoms can be found in Figs. S1 and S2 in the supplementary material for both NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalysts, respectively.

TEM analysis was used to measure particle size of the sulfur modified catalysts. The nickel particles are depicted in each image by arrows in Fig. 3.2. The sulfated catalysts, NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4, consisted of localised clusters as seen in Fig. 3.2.a and b, respectively. The particle size distribution of the four catalysts are shown in Fig. 3.3. The average size of these clusters were measured using the program ImageJ and were equal to 20 nm and 59 nm for NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4, respectively. The range of particle size for the reduced catalysts were 3–9 nm for the Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 catalyst and 4–12 nm for the NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalyst. These results are consistent with BET, which indicate that the sulfated catalysts had a lower surface area than the reduced Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalysts containing Ni3S2 species. It was proposed that perhaps the reduced catalysts disintegrate into smaller particles or that there could be a wider range of particle sizes as seen in TEM images.
3.3. Thermal stability of the sulfated catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 and SiO2
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the sulfated catalysts was carried out to study the thermal stability of the nickel sulfate on the MgAl2O4 and SiO2 supported catalysts. The TGA profiles of the NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalysts showed two mass loss steps as shown in Fig. 4. The first step, which occurs in the range 30–200 °C, was attributed to the mass loss of physically adsorbed water molecules on the catalysts. The mass loss of water was 8 % and 17 % for NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4, respectively. The mass loss at the higher temperatures i.e. 700 °C and 800 °C, was assigned to the decomposition of the sulfate groups on NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4, respectively [36]. The wt% mass loss was equal to 17 % and 12 % for the NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 catalysts, respectively. The TGA results confirmed that nickel sulfate on both supports would be thermally stable under the given reactions conditions used in the catalytic evaluation. However, the difference in sulfate decomposition temperatures show that sulfate decomposes at a higher temperature on MgAl2O4 than SiO2 support, which could be due to stronger sulfate-nickel interactions as well as sulfate-support interactions (evidenced from XRD information as MgSO4) on the MgAl2O4 support in comparison to that of the SiO2 support.

Fig. 4. TGA profiles of NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalysts.
The acidic properties of a catalyst are important in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity of a catalyst. The temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) experiments were conducted in order to obtain the acidic properties of the catalysts. The desorption profiles are shown in Fig. 5. Low temperature peaks are assigned to weak acid sites, while high temperature peaks are assigned to strong acid sites. [37] The TPD profile of the unmodified NiO/MgAl2O4 showed the absence of acid sites. The sulfur modified NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 catalyst contained a peak at 200 °C, indicating the presence of weak acid sites. A shoulder peak is found at 520 °C, which indicates the presence of strong acid sites. Furthermore, two peaks were observed in the high temperature domain. The first peak occurred at 710 °C and the second peak was found at 850 °C as seen in Fig. 5a, indicating the onset of decomposition as indicated by TGA analysis. Similarly, the Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 contained a peak at 700 °C, which was attributed to the desorption of sulfate from the catalyst in the form of MgSO4 species as indicated by XRD analysis, which shows that sulfate species is present in the reduced catalyst.

Fig. 5. (a) TPD profile of unmodified and modified NiO catalysts supported on MgAl2O4. (b) TPD profile of unmodified and modified NiO catalysts supported on SiO2.
The catalysts supported on SiO2 (Fig. 4b) contained no peaks in the low temperature domain, which was an indication that no weak acid sites were present for the catalysts. After the introduction of sulfur, strong acid sites were formed, as indicated by the shoulder peak found in the region of 485 °C. The peak at 700 °C was assigned to decomposition of the sample, which was confirmed by TGA analysis. Table 2 summarises the quantity of acid sites found on both MgAl2O4 and SiO2 supports. It was observed that the sulfated catalyst supported on MgAl2O4 contained more acid sites than that of the NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalyst, in both the low temperature range and high temperature range. Furthermore, the Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 catalyst contained a sulfur desorption peak which was absent in the TPD profile of the Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalyst. This could imply that the sulfur content was higher in Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 than Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4, since there is additional sulfur interaction with the MgAl2O4 support.

The TPD results indicate an increase in the acid sites of the catalysts after sulfur promotion for the catalysts supported on both MgAl2O4 and SiO2 support. This observation is consistent with results obtained by Jin and co-workers [38,39]. It was reported that the generation of the strong acidity by the introduction of sulfur is due to the formation of the surface sulfur complex on the catalysts. Moreover, it was suggested that the strong electron attracting ability of a sulfur complex, like S = O, to absorb electrons from a basic molecule, such as NH3, is the primary factor to generate highly acidic properties [38,40]. The acid site is the Ni(II) cation whose acidic strength is enhanced by the induction effect of S = O in the sulfur catalyst. It was noted that the acidity disappeared upon reduction for the Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalysts. This could imply that the primary source of acidity is due to the SO42− species on the MgAl2O4 support.
It has been reported by Nagase and co-workers that the oxidized state of sulfate is necessary for the generation of acidity on catalysts [40]. No peaks were observed in the high temperature range for Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4, which could imply that no sulfur is desorbed from the catalyst. The loss of acidity arise from the removal of surface oxygens bridged to both nickel and sulfur in the catalyst [40,41].
As it has been suggested, a sulfur complex like S=O may be responsible for the acidity generated in the catalysts. Infrared spectroscopy has been used to confirm the nature of the sulfur species present on the different supports. FTIR analysis indicated the presence of the surface sulfur complex, consisting of covalent SO double bonds present on the sulfur promoted nickel oxide catalysts (Fig. 6). The NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalyst displayed peaks at 1167 cm−1, 1090 cm−1, 1000 cm−1 and 832 cm−1, 691 cm−1, 618 cm−1 and 465 cm−1, respectively. According to Yamaguchi et al., if SO42- in metal sulfates, such as NiSO4, coordinates to Ni(II) through two of its oxygen atoms, a chelating or bridged bidentate complex is formed. A bridged bidentate complex also has four absorption bands at 1195−1160 cm−1, 1110−1105 cm−1, 1035−1030 cm−1 and 990−960 cm−1, which are assigned to the stretching frequencies of the SO bonds in the complex [42]. These values are in close range with the values obtained for the NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalyst. This suggests that the sulfur present in the NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalyst, coordinates to the metal in a bridging bidentate fashion. The absorption bands at 691 cm−1 and 618 cm−1 correlates to the anti-symmetric and symmetric stretching modes of Si-O-Si of the support, respectively. The band at 465 cm-1 is assigned to bending vibrations of Si-O-Si that is present in the SiO2 support [43].

Fig. 6. FTIR spectra of NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalysts.
The NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 catalyst displayed four absorption bands at 1260 cm−1 1180 cm−1, 1100 cm−1 and 1060 cm−1, respectively. A chelating bidentate complex usually has four absorption bands in the regions of 1240−1230 cm−1, 1125−1090 cm−1, 1035−995 cm−1and 960−940 cm−1, which are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching frequencies of SO bonds [42]. This indicates that the sulfur species present in the NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 catalyst coordinates in a chelating bidentate fashion to the nickel metal. Therefore, it is shown that the bonding of the sulfur complex is different on the two supports possibly resulting in differing electronic effects. Additionally, the IR absorption bands at 712 cm−1 can be assigned to the bending mode of Al3+ occupied in the spinel. The bands at 615 cm−1 correspond to the spinel type structure of the MgAl2O4 support, which are associated with lattice vibrations of tetra- and octahedrally coordinated metal ions [44]. It has been reported that the highest frequency in the chelating bidentate complex is higher than that of the bridged bidentate complex, which is consistent with the results obtained for the NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalysts. It has been noted in previous studies that bridging bidentate species desorb at low temperatures in TPD experiments, while chelating bidentate species desorb at medium temperatures. This is consistent with the observation from the TPD analysis and implies that the different bonding modes on the support might have an effect on the acidity of the catalysts [42,45].
Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) analysis was used to characterize the reducibility of the unsulfated and sulfated nickel-supported catalysts. The TPR results for the unsulfated catalysts are presented in Fig. 7a. The TPR profile for NiO/SiO2 shows that the catalyst reduces at 340 °C, which is typical for NiO-based catalysts. A shoulder peak is commonly found at high temperatures for supported NiO catalysts, indicating nickel-support interaction [15]. In this case, a small peak occurred at 470 °C which could be due to NiO interacting with the SiO2 support [46]. A similar trend was observed for the NiO/MgAl2O4 catalyst. The first peak occurred at 550 °C, while a smaller peak at 650 °C was present, indicating that NiO had some interaction with the MgAl2O4 support [[47], [48], [49]]. The second peak for NiO/MgAl2O4 occurred at a higher temperature than that of NiO/SiO2, indicating that the interaction between the metal and MgAl2O4 is stronger than the NiO-SiO2 interaction, since reduction occurred at a higher temperature. The strong interaction between the nickel and the MgAl2O4 support could form the NiAl2O4 phase, although this is difficult to determine as the phase overlaps with the MgAl2O4 phase in the XRD analysis. The particle size of NiO calculated from the XRD patterns indicated that the Ni(II) crystallite size on NiO/MgAl2O4 is smaller than NiO/SiO2, which is further inferred by TPR analysis, since NiO/MgAl2O4 reduces at 550 °C due to the smaller crystallites that require a higher temperature to be reduced [50]. It has been reported previously that the structural and physiochemical properties of supported metal sulfates differ compared to bulk metal sulfates due to metal-support interactions, which has been observed in our study as well [51].

Fig. 7b shows the TPR profiles of the sulfur modified catalysts on the different supports. Two peaks were observed for NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4, the first peak, occurring at 400 °C could be due to the reduction of NiO, which was still present on the catalyst after sulfur modification as shown in the XRD results. The second peak occurred at 600 °C and can be ascribed to the reduction of the sulfated species, NiSO4 and MgSO4, on the catalyst. Furthermore, it was noted that the peak at 650 °C in the TPR profile of NiO/MgAl2O4 was absent in the sulfated catalyst, which could indicate that any Ni-Al2O4 interactions is negligible in the sulfated catalyst.
The NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalyst displayed a split peak that occurred at a higher temperature than the unmodified catalyst on the SiO2 support. The starting reduction temperature of NiSO4 occurs at 340 °C, which is in accordance with the onset of the peak found in the TPR profile (Fig. 7b). The reduction of NiSO4 is a one-step process according to the equation below. [52]
3NiSO4 + 10H2 → Ni3S2 +SO2 +10H2O
An online mass spectrometer was connected to the TPR autochem in order to investigate whether the reduction of NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 followed the one-step process or whether any intermediate species were formed. Mass spectrometry showed the absence of peaks at 34 amu and 64 amu up to 435 °C (Fig. S4), corresponding to H2S or SO2, respectively. However, the presence of H2O was detected. The XRD analysis of NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 reduced at 435 °C (Fig. S5) confirmed that the sample contained no intermediate phase. Hence, a possibility for the split peak could be due to reduction of Ni2+ and SO42− ions on the surface of the catalyst at 435 °C, while the bulk reduction of the catalyst occurs at 500 °C.
TPR analysis indicates that NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 has a higher H2-consumption, since this catalyst contains only NiSO4, while the sulfur promoted catalyst supported on MgAl2O4 contains traces of NiO, MgSO4 and NiSO4 peaks as seen in the XRD patterns of NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the higher reduction temperature of NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 could be due to smaller, NiSO4 particles on the catalyst as indicated by XRD and TEM analysis leading to stronger metal-support interactions which suppress reducibility (Table 3).

3.4. Catalytic performance
The catalysts NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4, which contain the NiSO4 phase, were evaluated for the dehydrogenation of propane. In separate experiments, the fresh catalysts NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 were reduced under a flow of H2 gas at 50 mL/min in order to form the reduced catalysts, Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4, both containing Ni3S2, which were then tested for the dehydrogenation of propane. Fig. 8 shows the conversion of propane towards the main products, over the sulfate-based and sulfide-based catalysts.

Fig. 8. Conversion % of sulfur modified Ni-based catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 and SiO2 with reduction (Ni/support-20 wt%SO4) and without reduction (NiO/support-20 wt%SO4).
The conversion % of propane increased in the following order NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 (35 %) < Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 (46 %) < Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 (50 %) < NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 (54 %) at three minutes of the reaction time. It was noted that after the initial 3 min on stream, the Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4, Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalysts showed a significant decrease in propane conversion to approximately 30 %, while NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 increased to above 40 % and remained fairly stable for 2 h on stream. The NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 catalyst displayed an induction period, indicating that the active phase of NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 might be present after 30 min of the reaction time. Previous studies have shown by XPS analysis that the S2− species is present after reaction indicating that the SO42− species is transformed to a NiS species which is the active phase of the dehydrogenation catalyst [12]. In our study, Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 contain the Ni3S2 phase and are therefore already in the active form. Interestingly, the NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 containing NiSO4 shows the same conversion or slightly higher than the Ni3S2 catalysts. This may be due to the catalyst being quickly reduced to Ni3S2 i.e. within the first three minutes compared to the NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 catalyst. The TPR analysis indicated that the reducibility of NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 to Ni3S2 was suppressed due to stronger metal support interactions and therefore an activation period is observed.
Additionally, NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 was subjected to a 30 min reaction time, followed by XRD analysis of the spent catalyst for this reaction. The XRD profile showed that Ni3S2 species was present in the catalyst after 30 min and corresponded to an increase in conversion after this time. Activation periods are common in heterogeneous catalysis and some possible causes of activation are the formation of active carbon species, the creation of surface defects and an increase in active surface area [53]. The observed increase in activity in the NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalysts may be due to the increase in active surface area as the catalyst is reduced to Ni3S2 and this is in agreement with the BET results. Furthermore, the higher activity on the MgAl2O4 support could be ascribed to the smaller particle sizes of the sulfur modified nickel species on the catalysts, hence a better dispersion of the active phase. This may increase the exposure of the catalytically active Ni-S moiety. Therefore, the structural characteristics such as size and surface area of the nickel sulfide particles as well as reducibility seem to influence the catalytic activity.
The selectivity of the four catalysts at 30 min on stream is shown in Fig. 9 below. The NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 catalysts displayed the highest selectivity toward propene of about 70 % which increased to almost 80 % after 2 h on stream, indicating that the catalyst supported on MgAl2O4 has a better dehydrogenation activity than both NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 and Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 catalysts. Methane, ethane, ethene and C4 paraffins were additional products that were produced as shown in Fig. 9. The selectivity toward methane and that of the C2-C4 products, suggests that possibly cracking and hydrogenolysis occur as secondary reactions. In addition, there were less secondary reactions on the MgAl2O4 support possibly due to a higher desorption rate of propylene, which could be due to stronger electronic effects of the metal-support interactions in comparison to nickel-silica.

It was observed that after 2 h reactions, sulfur was present in the form of Ni3S2 particles in all the spent catalysts as shown in Fig. 10. Therefore, it can be implied that the sulfur modified nickel catalysts exhibit high stability characteristics, with regard to retaining sulfur on the catalysts.

Fig. 10. XRD profile of fresh and spent sulfur modified catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 and SiO2.
The NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 catalyst was evaluated for 7 h in order to investigate catalyst activity and catalyst deactivation over an extended period of time. Fig. 11a shows that the conversion of propane increased during the activation period and gradually decreases after 180 min on stream. The reason for the decline in propane conversion could be due to the loss of sulfur from the catalyst [54]. This trend was observed for both NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 as seen in the results for the spent catalysts in Fig. 11b.

The selectivity toward the various products is shown in Fig. 11c and further confirms the excellent dehydrogenation activity toward the desired propylene product over 7 h. Although there is a decrease in conversion from about 35 % to 20 % at the end of the reaction, interestingly, only a slight decrease in selectivity to propylene was noted. This occurred concurrently with a slight increase in methane selectivity possibly due to hydrogenolysis reactions over nickel particles, as sulfur is lost.
4. Conclusion
Nickel oxide catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 and SiO2 were successfully sulfated using ammonium sulfate as the sulfiding agent, to form NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and NiO/SiO2-20 wt%SO4 (both containing NiSO4). In separate experiments, the sulfated catalysts were reduced to form Ni/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 and Ni/SiO2-20 wt%SO4, which contained the sulfided species (Ni3S2). Structural and textural characterization of the catalysts revealed that sulfur promoted nickel species supported on MgAl2O4 displayed smaller particles with a higher dispersion in comparison to the particles on the SiO2 support. STEM analysis showed that the NiSO4 and Ni3S2 particles formed localised clusters on the SiO2 support. These clusters were effectively absent on the MgAl2O4 support. Furthermore, it was revealed that the bonding of sulfur varies on the two supports. Sulfate is bonded as a chelating bidentate ligand on MgAl2O4 and a bridging bidentate ligand on the SiO2 support, which has an effect on the acidic properties of the catalyst. The metal-support interaction were stronger on the MgAl2O4 support as indicated by TPR analysis. Whereby, peaks occurring at higher temperatures on NiO/MgAl2O4-20 wt%SO4 corresponded to the decomposition of sulfur, which contributes to the stability of the catalyst, since the loss of sulfur is associated with the deactivation of the catalysts. Catalytic evaluation of the sulfate-based and sulfide-based catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 and SiO2 showed that the catalyst supported on MgAl2O4 had a higher activity which was ascribed to the smaller particle size of the active species with a larger exposed area of Ni-S moeities, a stronger metal-support interaction, which results in a high electronic effect and facilitates the desorption of the products leading to a high selectivity of above 70 % for propylene.
