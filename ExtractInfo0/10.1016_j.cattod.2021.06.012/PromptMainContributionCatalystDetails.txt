A simultaneous operando FTIR & Raman study of propane ODH mechanism over V-Zr-O catalysts
Simultaneous operando Raman and transmission FTIR spectroscopic measurements have been combined for the study of the structure-activity relationships of V-Zr-O catalysts during propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). The combination of both spectroscopies during reaction allows the identification of reaction intermediates and yields structural information about the catalyst. The experimental results are compared with available data in the literature to propose a reaction mechanism for propane ODH on V-Zr-O catalytic systems, and to identify the role of different oxygen species bound to vanadium sites. The results are consistent with a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Besides, they clearly show higher activity of bridging oxygen sites (V-O-V, V-O-Zr) than terminal VO bonds.
1. Introduction
The catalytic selective oxidation of hydrocarbons [1], [2] is a strategic route to produce value-added chemicals. Among these processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to obtain propylene has been extensively studied over the past decades [3], [4], [5], since propylene has become the second most-demanded building block (after ethylene) in the petrochemical industry [6], [7]. However, the low propylene yields obtained by propane ODH have hindered its industrial implementation [3]. The non-oxidative dehydrogenation reaction is therefore practiced in the industry [8], although it is an energy-intensive process with several hurdles that may be solved with the ODH route [4], [5].
Catalysts based on dispersed vanadia species over different supports (ZrO2, TiO2, Al2O3, SiO2, etc.) are highly reported in literature for propane ODH [3], [4], [9], [10], [11], [12]. It has been established that the reaction proceeds via Mars-van-Krevelen type mechanism [4], [5], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], which involves the sequential reduction and reoxidation of the catalyst surface by reaction with, respectively, propane and oxygen (or other oxidizing agents, like N2O [14], [20]). The generally accepted reaction network is a parallel-consecutive pathway, where propane is oxidized to propylene, and both can be totally oxidized to COx [5], [21]. Moreover, it is commonly reported that it is difficult to control such undesired combustion to COx, which lowers propylene yields, because the same lattice oxygen active sites are responsible for both selective and total oxidation, and propylene activation requires lower energy with respect to propane [4], [5], [22], [23].
There is a debate on the propylene formation mechanism, but there are even less details about the nature and number of steps that lead to COx formation [5]. It is accepted that the first proton abstraction from propane is the rate-determining step; however, the low coverage and short lifetime of subsequent intermediates limit their detection by traditional transient or steady-state methods. Iglesia et al. carried out isotopic tracer studies to investigate the propane ODH reaction mechanism over VOx/ZrO2 catalysts [24], [25]. The results suggested that propane is most probably attacked at C(2), the weakest C−H bond, forming isopropoxide species, and that both propane C−H bond activation and dissociative oxygen chemisorption (to reoxidize the catalyst) are irreversible steps, while the −OH groups formed during reaction on the catalyst reversibly recombine into water, creating oxygen active sites and vacancy centres. Ultra-rapid FTIR analysis coupled with MS during propane oxidation on a V-based catalyst demonstrated that oxygenates are not formed during the first minutes of reaction, showing that propylene is formed directly from propane via dehydrogenation on a V-O site [26]. As observed for spinel-type catalysts (Co3O4, Mn3O4 and MgCr2O4) [27], the hydrocarbon species may evolve to propylene (acid-basic elimination step) or to chemisorbed acetone (redox step). The latter is more easily overoxidized to COx through acetate and formate species as intermediates, with the consequent formation of carbonates.
Regarding active sites, since 1968 terminal VO bonds have been proposed as the most active site [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. However, since the 1990s, other authors have reported experimental evidence that the vanadyl bond is hardly reactive and that the bridging oxygens (V-O-V/V-O-support) are the catalytic active sites for selective oxidation reactions [4], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65]. Several in situ and operando IR, Raman and UV-Vis DRS spectroscopy studies (some of them including 18O2/16O2 isotopic labelling) provide experimental evidence of the non-involvement of the terminal vanadyl oxygens and of the key role of the bridging V-O-support bonds in the kinetic rate determining step [4], [38], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65]. Furthermore, Bañares et al. have shown independence [66] and even opposite [67] correlation between the VO bond strength and alkane ODH reactivity.
The aim of the present paper is to uncover the role of the different oxygen sites and the propane ODH mechanism over V-Zr-O catalysts. A new homemade operando IR-Raman cell [68], designed in a joint CSIC-LCS collaboration, is used to obtain in a single operando experiment information about the structure of the catalyst (Raman and infrared), the adsorbed species (mainly, but not only, from FTIR), and the reactivity (online gas measurement) during reaction. This combination offers a higher possibility to directly connect relevant details about the structure-activity relationships of the catalyst-reactants interplay during reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
The preparation of the catalysts by electrospinning is described elsewhere [69]; zirconium (IV) propoxide, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), acetylacetone, 1-propanol and vanadyl acetylacetonate were the precursors. Polymer solutions were prepared by mixing the precursors in adequate amounts to obtain final fibers with nominal concentration of elemental vanadium of 2.5 wt% (Zr-V2.5), 5.0 wt% (Zr-V5.0) and 6.4 wt% (Zr-V6.4). These polymer solutions were vigorously stirred at room temperature for 24 h before the electrospinning process, as described in previous articles [69], [70]. The electrospun fibers were calcined in air flow (150 mL·min-1 STP) at 500ºC (10 ºC·min-1 heating rate) for 6 h. XPS analyses of the final catalysts Zr-V2.5, Zr-V5.0 and Zr-V6.4 indicate surface mass concentrations of elemental vanadium of 2.7%, 4.9% and 6.0%, respectively, as published in a previous work [69].
2.2. Characterization
X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were acquired in the region of 2Ɵ = 5–80° for 30 min on an EMPYREAN diffractometer of PANalytical using CuKα1,2 (1.5406 Å) monochromatic radiation (operational value 45 kV and 40 mA), a detector PIXcel and Soller slits (incident and diffracted beam) of 0.04 rad.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of the catalysts were obtained by a 5700 C model Physical Electronics apparatus with MgKα radiation (1253.6 eV). The maximum of the C1s peak was set at 284.5 eV and used as a reference to shift the other peaks.
2.3. ODH reaction in IRRaman operando reactor
Scheme 1 represents the IRRaman operando reactor, which is an evolution, developed in collaboration with CSIC, of the IR “sandwich” catalysis cell designed at LCS [71]. The cell is placed in the bench of a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer (64 scans/spectrum) equipped with a MCT/A detector that allows direct acquisition of transmission IR spectra. For Raman measurements, the laser beam (532 nm) is brought to the sample in the catalysis cell via an ad hoc InPhotonics Raman probe specially designed to withstand high temperatures. The Raman signal was obtained using low power (5 mW) to prevent local heating and analyzed by a Horiba Jobin Yvon Labram300 spectrometer. The dual IR-Raman operando reactor can be fed with different controlled gas flows and a capillary thermocouple was placed on the sample for temperature control. Downstream the reactor, the exhaust gases are simultaneously measured using an IR gas cell and a mass spectrometer. The lines were heated to 60 ºC to pre-heat the reactant mixture and avoid product condensation. Complete information on this cell is provided elsewhere [68].

Scheme 1. Conceptual representation of the IRRaman operando reactor.
The structured fiber catalysts were grinded and pressed into self-supported wafers to perform the catalytic experiments in a reactor-cell behaving as a plug flow reactor, as already calculated [72]. As described previously, wafers were made with pressures below 1 ton/cm2 to preserve adequate porosity to prevent diffusion control phenomena [73]. The weight of catalyst wafer (Wcat) and the total volumetric gas flow (FT) were fixed to 31.5 mg and 18.1 mL·min-1, respectively. The reaction temperature ranged from 200 to 340 ºC. Oxidation was performed with 10% oxygen in argon, while reaction was performed with 20% propane and 10% oxygen in argon (ODH conditions) or 20% propane in argon (DH conditions). The samples were first dehydrated at 340 ºC (5 ºC·min-1) in 10% O2/Argon. After this activation step, the experiments were run at 200, 250, 300 and 340 ºC, switching at each temperature between four different conditions in the following order: ODH reaction, oxidation, DH reaction, and oxidation. The conditions were changed after achieving steady or quasi-steady state. A propylene ODH experiment was also performed in order to obtain more mechanistic information about the consecutive total oxidation of propylene to COx.
FTIR and Raman operando spectra of the catalysts were acquired every 2 and 4 min, respectively, with an acquisition time of 39 s for the former and typically 180 s for the latter. Online gas-phase FTIR and MS spectra were collected every 2 min and 3 s, respectively. In all experiments the carbon molar balances were attained with a maximum error of 5%. Propane or oxygen conversion (
or
, respectively) and the selectivity to i product (
) were defined as:
(1)
(2)
where
and
are the molar flows of reactant/product “i" in the inlet and in the outlet streams, respectively, and
is the number of carbon atoms in molecule i (nC3H8 = 3). Turn-over frequency (TOF) describes the specific activity and was calculated from Eq. (3); it quantifies the moles of propane converted per mol of vanadium and unit time:
(3)
where
denotes the molar mass of vanadium and
the mass of vanadium per gram of catalyst. This parameter assumes that all the active sites are exposed to the reactants, have the same catalytic activity and are stable during the reaction. The first assumption is supported by the Raman spectra showing that all vanadia is present as molecularly dispersed surface vanadium oxide (Fig. 1). There is no evidence of bulk species like ZrV2O7 (Raman bands at 900, 780 cm-1) [74], [75], [76], or crystalline V2O5 (Raman bands at 143 and 994 cm-1) [77], which rules out TOF overestimation due to trapped vanadia.

In order to discard a possible contribution of the homogeneous gas phase reaction and/or of the zirconia support to the catalytic results of propane ODH, blank experiments were run without catalyst and with a vanadium-free zirconia sample. In both cases, propane conversion values were negligible. The possible influence of the Raman laser on the catalytic activity was checked by performing FTIR operando experiments with and without the Raman and no significant differences were found. Moreover, the samples were examined after the operando experiments and no dark spots due to the laser incidence were observed. This suggests that hotter zones, where coke could preferentially form, did not occur during reaction.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Fresh catalysts characterization
Fig. 1 shows the simultaneous Raman (Fig. 1, green) and infrared (Fig. 1, red) spectra of the dehydrated Zr-V5.0 catalyst at 340 ºC. The characteristic Raman bands of zirconia tetragonal phase observed at 642, 459, 314 and 268 cm-1 [69], [78] are consistent with the XRD patterns (Fig. S1 in Supplementary Information). XRD peaks of zirconia support become smaller and broader with vanadia loading. When these materials are prepared using the strategy of one-pot synthesis, the dispersed components tend to hinder the growth and sintering of crystallites and phase transformation of the support resulting in smaller and more amorphous of ZrO2 crystallites [79]. The broadest Raman signal corresponds to V-O-V (ca. 880 cm-1) and V-O-Zr in ZrV2O7-like structure (770 cm-1) [39], [58], [69], [77]. Raman and infrared spectra show the 1020 cm-1 VO mode of molecularly dispersed vanadium oxide species [58], [74], [76]. The presence of crystalline V2O5 can be excluded, since its characteristic Raman bands at 143 and 994 cm-1 are absent [77]. These results are also consistent with the V 2p3/2 XPS spectra (Fig. S2 in Supplementary Information), which binding energy values do not correspond to bulk V2O5 (517.2 eV) [80]; thus underlining the interaction between molecularly dispersed vanadia and ZrO2. Moreover, some weak infrared bands around 3700 cm-1 are apparent due to the hydroxyl groups. The infrared bands in the range of 1300–1600 cm-1 can be attributed to carbonaceous deposits [81], [82] and carbonate species [83]; which may come from the decomposition during calcination of the carbonaceous precursors and polymer used for the preparation of the different catalysts. The sharp band near 2339 cm-1 is associated with occluded CO2 [84], [85].
The other two catalysts, Zr-V2.4 and Zr-V6.4, presented very similar Raman and infrared features; as expected, the intensity of the vanadium oxide bands increased and the VO mode blue-shifted with increasing vanadium oxide loading [68]. This shift is due to a higher relative population of polyvanadates with respect to monovonadates in catalysts with higher vanadium contents [86]. With respect to the bands related with the carbonaceous deposits and carbonate species, the intensity increases as the vanadia content decreases; this would be associated with the capacity of vanadia to catalyze the decomposition of these carbonaceous species during the calcination.
3.2. Operando characterization during reaction
3.2.1. Propane ODH
The activity results obtained during propane ODH operando experiments in the IRRaman reactor are shown in Table 1. Propane conversion is apparent at 250ºC for Zr-V6.4 and Zr-V5.0 and at 300 ºC for Zr-V2.5. The conversion and TOF values increase with vanadium loading, suggesting some higher reactivity of polymeric vanadium sites. These data are consistent with previous data of these catalysts in a conventional plug-flow reactor [69].

Fig. 2. Operando FTIR (1 and 2) and Raman (2) spectra for Zr-V2.5 (A), Zr-V5.0 (B) and Zr-V6.4 (C). IR spectra shown at 1700–1100 cm-1 (1) were all subtracted with the reference spectrum of the fresh catalyst at the same temperature. Green and yellow traces represent ODH and DH experiments, respectively. Blue and pink traces represent oxidation experiments before and after reaction, respectively.
At 200ºC, despite negligible activity for ODH reaction (green trace), Zr-V5.0 and Zr-V6.4 exhibit stable infrared bands in the 1600–1300 cm-1 region (Fig. 2B1 and C1, respectively) that can be attributed to a mixture of bidentate acetates (1540, 1448, and 1355 cm-1), acrylates (1640, 1540, 1440, and 1355 cm-1) and bidentate formates (1570, 1371, and 1350 cm-1) [17], [87], [88], [89], [90], [91], which remain on the surface upon subsequent oxidation (pink trace). Infrared VO mode redshifts (Fig. 2B2 and C2, respectively) can be observed during ODH (green traces) with respect to Zr-V5.0 and Zr-V6.4 dehydrated state (blue traces). The redshift is not reversed upon reoxidation (pink trace) at this temperature. The intensity of the V-O-V and V-O-Zr modes decreases during propane ODH (Fig. 2A2, B2 and C2) (green traces) and is restored upon reoxidation (pink spectra).
At 250 °C the catalytic activity is already apparent for Zr-V5.0 and Zr-V6.4 (Table 1), and the IR spectra show some differences in the region of adsorbed species. The acetate-to-formate ratio increase with temperature for both catalysts (Fig. 2B1 and C1) may be due to the lower thermal stability of formates [92]. In fact, only a slight removal of acetate species is achieved upon reoxidation at 250 °C.
At higher temperatures (300 and 340 ºC), the reaction rate becomes significantly higher (Table 1). Accordingly, the adsorbed oxygenates on Zr-V5.0 and Zr-V6.4 (Fig. 2B1 and C1) decrease significantly during ODH reaction (green spectra). The infrared VO mode perturbation during ODH reaction (green traces in Fig. 2B2 and C2) is reversed upon reoxidation at these temperatures (pink spectra) along with the concomitant removal of the oxygenate species (Fig. 2B1 and C1) and formation of gaseous COx and water.
In the case of Zr-V2.5, the position of the VO band remains unchanged during ODH reaction and the intensity of the V-O-V and V-O-Zr modes is hardly recovered by reoxidation at the lower temperatures (Fig. 2A2). Zr-V2.5 is still apparently inactive at 250 ºC, but its features resemble those described above for Zr-V5.0 and Zr-V6.4 at 200 ºC, with the development of a mixture of bidentate acetates, acrylates and bidentate formate species (Fig. 2A). Similarly, Zr-V2.5 spectra and activity at 300 and 340 ºC are similar to those of Zr-V5.0 and Zr-V6.4 at 250 and 300 ºC, respectively. The infrared spectra of Zr-V2.5 during reaction (green trace) show that surface acetate, acrylate and formate species hardly change.
The operando propane ODH data suggest that the catalysts are partly reduced or their polymerization decreases during reaction, and that between the detected acetate and formate intermediate species the latter decompose to CO faster, which is consistent with the higher stability of acetates with respect to formates [92]. As observed elsewhere [17], [27], [93], the formation of surface carbonates during the evolution of such carboxylate species to COx cannot be discarded. Moreover, the formation of other species than carboxylates cannot be excluded (e.g. intermediates for propylene formation) [40] at low or negligible surface concentrations that would not be detectable in these experiments. The slight perturbations of the VO band could be associated with these adsorbed species, as the perturbations disappear when the oxygenates are removed, regardless of whether the catalyst has been reoxidized.
VO and V-O-V/V-O-Zr bands show changes of position and intensity, respectively, during reaction, which are reversible upon reoxidation. The bridging V-O-V and V-O-Zr appear to interact with propane at lower temperatures than the terminal oxygens (200 ºC in Fig. 2A2), which indicates that bridging oxygens are more reactive than the oxo group, in agreement with previous works [42], [52], [67]. The increase of surface vanadium coverage leads to higher polyvanadates to monovanadates ratio and TOF values, suggesting that polyvanadates are more active than monovanadates.
3.2.2. Propane DH
Fig. 2 also shows the operando spectra during DH reaction (yellow trace) at 300 and 340 ºC; DH data at 200 and 250 ºC show no appreciable difference with ODH data and thus are not shown. There is a higher surface concentration of adsorbed oxygenates during propane DH (Fig. 2A1, B1 and C1). Unlike propane ODH, where acetate and formate species are simultaneously formed and removed, during propane DH acetates dominate, with minor amounts of acrylates. Lattice oxygen is required for the evolution of acetate and acrylate species, with concomitant catalyst reduction, but not to decompose formates into CO [92], [94]. The formation of carbonaceous deposits is evidenced by a shoulder around 1600 cm-1 in the FTIR spectra and around 1430 and 1600 cm-1 in the Raman spectra (Fig. S2 in Supplementary Information), with a concomitant decrease of VO, V-O-V and V-O-Zr modes intensity (Fig. 2A2, B2 and C2) (yellow traces). As in ODH, vanadia bands are only restored upon reoxidation.
Fig. 3 shows the spectra during operando propane DH on the Zr-V6.4 catalyst at 340 ºC; fresh catalyst and propane ODH spectra at the same temperature are included as references in dark blue and dark green traces, respectively. The Raman acquisition time was reduced from 180 to 60 s to increase time resolution, which decreased the signal-to-noise ratio. Propylene, CO and CO2 appear as initial gaseous products, which concentration decreases over time (Fig. 3B) as the lattice oxygen is consumed (Fig. 3C) and adsorbed species (mainly acetates) form (Fig. 3A). The detection of these products during several minutes in the absence of molecular oxygen confirms the participation of lattice oxygen, in line with a Mars-Van-Krevelen type mechanism [13].

Fig. 3. Evolution over time of the adsorbed species by FTIR (subtracted spectra) and Raman spectra (A), on line gas phase FTIR spectra including propane conversion and propylene selectivity values (B) and catalyst surface features in the FTIR and Raman spectra (C) of Zr-V6.4 during propane DH (20% C3H8 in Ar) at 340 ºC. The fresh catalyst (dark blue) and the ODH spectra (dark green) at the same temperature are included as reference.
As expected, propane DH conversion is lower than steady state ODH (Fig. 3B). DH propylene selectivity values are higher than steady state ODH. A significant intensity decrease of the Raman bands associated with V−O−V/V−O−Zr bonds is observed during the first minute of DH reaction (Fig. 3C, red vs. dark blue spectra); this shows a fast reduction at the bridging oxygen vanadium sites, while the VO sites hardly change (Fig. 3C). The activity slowly decreases with time on stream, being almost negligible after 3 min, while the lattice oxygen from V-O-V/V-O-Zr sites is further consumed. At this moment, the reduction of VO sites becomes apparent, suggesting that terminal oxygen is much less active. Upon depletion of the catalyst reactive oxygen sites, acetate and acrylate species progressively accumulate on the surface, without significant formation of reaction products. The IR band by 1600 cm-1 after the first minute on stream evidences the formation of coke when the catalyst reduces (Fig. 3 A). Finally, quasi-steady state of the catalyst is achieved after 60 min of propane DH. It should be noted the different sensibilities of the IR and Raman spectra in the range of the adsorbed species. While IR is more sensitive to oxygenated surface species, Raman is more sensitive to more polyolefinic species. Similar data during propane DH are reported in Figs. S3 and S4 for Zr-V5.0 and Zr-V2.5, respectively, where the FTIR spectra display the features of acetate species and the Raman spectra evidence coke formation.
In summary operando DH results indicate that the V-O-V/V-O-Zr sites (lattice bridging oxygens) oxidize propane without the participation of gas phase oxygen, while the VO site does not play a critical role. This is consistent with our conclusions and the literature [42], [52], [67], [68], where V−O−V/V−O−Zr bonds are proposed as the active sites rather than the VO bonds.
3.2.3. Propylene ODH
A propylene ODH experiment was also run (Fig. 4). After activation at 340 °C, propylene ODH feed was sent at room temperature to the IRRaman operando reactor that was subsequently heated to 100 ºC at 5 ºC·min-1. After 48 min runtime the feed was switched to reoxidize the catalyst at 150 °C until the spectra showed no appreciable changes. As shown in Fig. 4 for Zr-V5.0, during propylene ODH some FTIR bands of physisorbed propylene appear at room temperature (1638, 1454, 1440, 1420 and 1372 cm-1) [93]. Bands characteristic of adsorbed isopropoxide (1468, 1455, 1385, 1370, 1330, 1168, 1137 and 1115 cm-1) and chemisorbed acetone (1682, 1421, 1368, 1245 and 1090 cm-1) [87] become apparent at 100 ºC; these species are also visible at 150 ºC under the subsequent oxidation conditions, but the band of isopropoxide decreased as the band of acetone increased (dark blue trace) up to its maximum concentration, reached after 86 min. Thereafter, acetone started to decrease and new bands characteristic of bidentate acetates and bidentate formates developed, similarly to the propane ODH experiments (Fig. 2A1, B1 and C1).

3.3. Proposed mechanism
According to the operando experiments, both propane [5], [24], [27] and propylene [17], [27], [92], [93], [95], [96] activation on V-Zr-O catalysts mainly proceed via isopropoxide species to form chemisorbed acetone and carboxylates, precursors of COx, unlike other studies that have reported the activation of propylene through allyl-alkoxides giving rise to chemisorbed acrolein and acrylates [24], [38], [92], [93], [96], [97]. Therefore, a common surface intermediate is responsible of both propane and propylene ODH parallel reactions [27], [98] and its consecutive oxidations eventually lead to the formation of COx total oxidation products. Scheme 2 illustrates the propane ODH mechanism derived from these experiments and assumptions.

Scheme 2. Proposed mechanism derived from operando FTIR spectra obtained during propane/propylene partial oxidation reaction (ODH) and literature results.
Scheme 3 represents a proposed general mechanism consistent with current results, and in line with other works in the literature [5], [17], [25], [27], [93], [95]. Our model assumes that only the lattice oxygen reacts with the adsorbed species, following a Mars-van-Krevelen type mechanism. The bridging lattice oxygen is represented as V-O-M, where M is V or Zr, assuming that both are active sites having the same role in the mechanism; the participation of VO terminal oxygen is not considered. V-OH and V-□-M represent a protonated lattice oxygen and a vacancy site, respectively. It is proposed that propane oxidation occurs via the irreversible isopropoxide formation (R2), according to Iglesia et al. [25], which can give rise reversibly to propylene (R3.1) or be further oxidized to chemisorbed acetone (R3.2). The propylene formed can be released in the gas phase or adsorbed again on the surface and oxidized to isopropoxide species through a neighboring V-OH as Brønsted acidic site (R3.1.1 and R3.1, respectively), and continues with the subsequent oxidation steps (R3.2). Then, bidentate formates and acetates form by oxidative cleavage of the C(1)-C(2) bond of chemisorbed acetone (R4). These oxygenate species further evolve to CO (R5.1 and R5.2), but not to CO2; this is in line with a previous work results with the same catalysts [69]. CO could be released to the gas phase or be further oxidized to CO2 (R6). The total oxidation through acrylates intermediates might be possible, and the formation of carbonate surface species cannot be discarded during the evolution of the carboxylates, as reported in other works [17], [27], [93], but these reactions were not included in the scheme. The equations R1 and R7 represent the catalyst reoxidation reactions, where the irreversible dissociative adsorption of gas-phase O2 and the reversible OH recombination take place.

Scheme 3. Proposed detailed general mechanism based on the results obtained in this work and the literature about propane ODH [5], [17], [25], [27], [93], [95]. V-O-M, V-□-M and V-OH represent lattice bridging oxygens, reduced vanadium sites and protonated lattice oxygens, respectively.
4. Conclusions
The new “IRRaman” multimodal operando reactor was used to study the structure-activity relationships of V-Zr-O catalysts during propane ODH; the simultaneous acquisition of activity data together with FTIR and Raman spectra of the working catalyst with space and time consistency has been decisive to gain insight about the propane ODH mechanism. The results indicate that the reaction occurs via a Mars-van-Krevelen type mechanism. Propane activation, the rate determining step, occurs through the formation of isopropoxide species, which may desorb as propylene or further oxidize to chemisorbed acetone. The latter would be converted into acetate and formate species; these carboxylates would be the precursors of COx. The propylene formed during reaction might react with a surface OH group as Brønsted acidic site to form isopropoxide species that would be further oxidized via the previously described pathway. It has been directly and unambiguously observed that the V−O−V/V−O−Zr sites are significantly more active than the terminal VO bonds, clarifying the confusion created in literature. The results also show that polyvanadates present a slightly higher activity than monovanadates. Therefore, valuable information was obtained that lays the groundwork for future kinetic studies.

    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure

    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
