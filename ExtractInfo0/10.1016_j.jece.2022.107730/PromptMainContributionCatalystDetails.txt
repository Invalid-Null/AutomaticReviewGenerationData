Recovery of platinum from diesel catalysts by combined use of H2O2/HCl leaching and adsorption
Spent automotive catalysts are industrial non-hazardous wastes of high added values because of the presence of platinum group metals, whose recovery is gaining increasing attention in European countries. This paper proposes a hydrometallurgical process to recover platinum from diesel catalysts, based on a first leaching step with aqueous solutions of H2O2 (up to 0.2 M) and mild HCl concentrations (0.4 M), followed by a refining step in which platinum is deposited over a granular activated carbon. Tests were carried out at different H2O2 content, temperatures, and sizes of granulated catalyst. The use of H2O2 and low HCl content allows higher sustainability than conventional hydrometallurgical processes by reducing safety risks associated with the use of concentrated HCl and the emissions of NOx deriving from the use of nitrogen species in conventional leaching. Besides, the use of an adsorbent avoids the utilization of cyanides or other toxic organic solvents for the refining of the leaching solution. Experiments revealed that the low HCl concentration results in longer leaching times; however, process conditions can be tuned to completely recover platinum with negligible extraction of other metals on the catalyst, minimizing on the subsequent adsorption process. Optimal conditions appear as leaching at 20 °C with a 0.13 M H2O2 0.4 M HCl solution followed by an adsorption step at 20 °C using an activated carbon with high BET surface area and high content of reducing surface groups. These findings suggest that the proposed recovery process can be a suitable candidate for future technology implementations.

1. Introduction
Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) are transition elements, such as ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, palladium, and platinum, which are characterized by strong catalytic activity, high ductility [1], good resistance to corrosion and oxidation, high fusion point, and good electrical conductivity [2], [3]. PGMs are rare elements on the earth's crust [4]; according to the British Geological Survey (2017), most of the subsoil reservoirs of PGM are owned by South Africa (261 t), Russia (105 tons), and Zimbabwe (29 ton). The average PGM primary extraction grade was in the range 8.1–27 g/t. The PGMs are often “side-products” of other metal ores, such as nickel and copper [5], [6]. Considering the large demand of PGMs and the concentration of natural resources in a limited number of countries, European Commission included PGMs within its list of critical raw materials: these metals are characterized by high economic importance and high supply risk (see for example the COM(2020) 474 EU Commission Communication).
According to recent literature, 41% of platinum reservoirs are owned by Russia, followed by South Africa (33%), Canada (8%), the United States (7%), and Zimbabwe (6%) [7], [8], [9]. Platinum market value is worth about 32 €/g in March 2022 (source: coininvest.com) and the automotive industry is its largest user [10], [11] with around 45% of the platinum market [12]. Platinum is largely used because of its catalytic capacity to oxidize CO and unburnt hydrocarbons into CO2 and to promote the reduction of NOx in the typical conditions of gas exhausted from light and heavy duties engines of road vehicles [13], [14].
The production of platinum from primary extraction processes is characterized by a long sequence of mechanical operations, primary separation, and purification steps [15], [16], [17] with a relevant environmental impact [18], [19]. The need to comply profitability with environmental safety has progressively discouraged mining activities in the European Union and the United States of America. In these developed countries, secondary production of platinum from “urban mining”, i.e. waste products, is gaining increasing interest due to the availability of spent automotive catalytic converters and to the lower investment and environmental impact compared with mining extraction [20].
The exhaust catalytic converters containing PGMs (platinum, palladium, rhodium, etc.) have been classified by the European Union as non—hazardous materials, with a European Waste Code (EWS) of 160801. The market of spent catalysts in the EU is relevant; however, it is still not as well-structured and regulated as those of plastics and glass.
Existing alternatives for the recovery of PGM from wastes are the pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes [11], [21], [22]. The first consists of the fusion of catalytic converter matrices, followed by the separation of the low-worthy materials from the PGMs and subsequent purifications. Hydrometallurgical processes consist of the following steps: homogenization of the spent material, dissolution in acidic reactant with the possible addition of oxidizing agents, selective leaching of PGM using chemical reactions [23], and a final purification step, mostly consisting of solvent extraction processes [24].
In recent years, an increasing interest toward the environmental impact of secondary PGM production processes is arising; for example, it is reported that pyrometallurgical processes allow very high separation efficiency [25], but the environmental impact is not lower than mining extraction due to high temperatures reached (ranging 1500–1700 °C), high sedimentation time required [26], and also for the need to contain the emission of large amounts of toxic substances originated from combustion. Generally, the hydrometallurgical technique is considered a better compromise among process efficiency and environmental and safety constraints [27], [28]). Nevertheless, conventional hydrometallurgical processes have a non-negligible environmental impact. For example, leaching is often performed using hot aqua regia [29], or other mixtures of concentrated acid, leading to emissions of NOx, HCl, and other acid vapours in the workplaces and the production of hazardous spent wastewaters. Refining processes with solvent extraction suffer from the use of toxic organic species and the need for a suitable disposal, together with the emission of pollutants from the process plant. Besides, even if the hydrometallurgical method is cheaper and greener than pyrometallurgy [30], the time process is often longer and the industrial-scale-up suffers for larger plant footprint [31], [32], [33]. To limit these drawbacks, several innovative processes have been proposed in the last years [34], [35], [36], [37].
This work investigates the potentialities of a new hydrometallurgical method based on the use of hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant for the leaching of platinum from a catalytic converter, followed by a refining stage with activated carbon adsorption to separate platinum from the leachate. The platinum-loaded activated carbon can be potentially used as a catalyst [38] or incinerated to recover nearly pure platinum, as suggested by Di Natale et al. [39] for palladium. Pertinent literature on HCl/H2O2 leaching is quite recent and stressed the beneficial role of H2O2 as an oxidant due to its higher sustainability with respect to HNO3 or other inorganic acids [40], [41], [42], [43], [44].
The mechanisms of acidic leaching using H2O2 can be reduced to the following overall reaction:
(1)
According to stoichiometric conditions, Eq.(1) shows that 2 moles of hydrogen peroxide and 6 moles of hydrochloric acid are needed to extract each mole of platinum. The mechanisms underpinning the leaching process are indeed more complex, involving a network of reactions that include the formation of other chlorine species.
A review of the literature about the leaching and the adsorption processes is summarized in Table 1, resuming the main experimental findings regarding the effects of the key process parameters (temperature, acid concentration, hydrogen peroxide content). The leaching process is based on the oxidation of Pt(0) from the catalyst surface promoted by the oxidant (H2O2) in acidic conditions. The chlorides are required to support the oxidation and operate as ligands to stabilize the Pt(II) ions in the solution. Therefore, acidity and chloride contents are decoupled, as other acids can be used in the place of HCl, if the chlorides are provided by other means (e.g. using NaCl, NaOCl, CuCl as reported in the review of Yakoumis et al. [41]).

As indicated in most studies reported in the literature, higher temperature and HCl concentration have always a beneficial effect on the leaching process, while a similar trend is not observed for an increase of the H2O2 concentration: in some cases, depending on the HCl content and the temperature [10], [45], [46] an optimal H2O2 concentration is observed. It is worth underlining that the cited literature mostly referred to a test duration of a few hours, for which a saturation in the leaching process is not always achieved.
To the best of our knowledge, there are very few attempts to use adsorption to recover platinum from real leaching solutions containing H2O2. Indeed, activated carbon proved to be a valid option for platinum and palladium adsorption in model aqueous solutions [47], [48].
The uptake of heavy metals on activated carbon includes several synergistic phenomena, such as adsorption of ions through complexation with surface groups, reduction with electrochemical processes, and microprecipitation of insoluble salts. The last two mechanisms are the most relevant in reducing environmental impact.
Intending to develop new platinum recovery processes, with potentially lower environmental impacts, this paper aims to contribute to the scientific literature by providing a new set of experiments carried out with leaching solutions containing low HCl content and prolonging the leaching tests for longer times respect to the pertinent literature. New adsorption tests on the real leaching solutions are presented. The work aims to analyze the effect of the main process parameters on the efficiency of the leaching and the adsorption steps and outline preliminary equations for a subsequent process design.
Experiments have been carried out on a laboratory scale performing the leaching step on a virgin, alumina-washcoated, diesel catalyst, to avoid the disturbances introduced by the presence of contaminants and the mechanical and chemical alterations typical of a spent catalyst. Several solutions at different temperatures and H2O2 concentrations have been tested. Adsorption experiments have been performed on the leaching solution using activated carbons under different temperatures.
2. Materials and methods
In this section, the main steps of the experimental procedure have been described in detail. In particular, sub-Section 2.1 considers the platinum leaching step using acid solutions, while sub-Section 2.2 describes the adsorption of platinum from the leaching solution on granular activated carbons.
2.1. Leaching tests
The materials used for the preparation of the leaching solutions are hydrochloric acid (MW 36.46 g/mol, purity 37% w/w, CAS number 7647–01–0, purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Italy) and hydrogen peroxide (MW 34.01, 9.1% w/w, 30 volumes, CAS number 7722–84–1, purchased from Titolchimica S.p.A., Italy) diluted with distilled water (CAS number 7732–18–5, purchased from Best Chemical S.r.l., Caserta, Italy). All the reactants and materials were used as received. The virgin diesel catalytic converter was provided by Ecofiltri S.r.l., Italy. This has a cordierite support and a γ-Al2O3 washcoat and is characterized by a nominal total platinum loading of q0 = 0.81 mg/g, a cellular density of 400 cpsi, a void fraction of 0.5, a bulk density of 1080 g/dm3, and an effective density of 2159 g/dm3. The effective platinum loading over the examined catalyst was around q0 = 0.81 mg/g from tests performed with hot aqua regia. The overall properties of the catalytic converters used in this work are listed in Table S1 and its overall metal content is resumed in Table S3 of the Supplementary Materials. The metal contents on the catalyst mirror the presence of base metals (Cu, Ni, V, Zn, Fe), the γ-Al2O3 washcoat, and the cordierite support (MgO·Al2O3·SiO2).
Catalytic converters were manually crushed using a stainless-steel mortar (weight 800 g, mod. EV-CY0151, Tera, Italy). Particle size distribution of granulated catalyst (before sieving for experiments) is reported in Fig. S2 of Supplementary Materials. This step was followed by sieving of the samples to obtain catalyst grains belonging to three classes of diameters: the first class had an average particle size among 212 and 300 µm (average diameter of 257 µm), the second among 63 and 212 µm (average diameter of 132 µm) and the third below 63 µm (average diameter 21 µm), respectively.
The typical experiment consists in contacting a given amount (mcat = 10 g) of sieved powder of catalytic converter into VL0= 100 mL of leaching solution placed in lab glassware containers having a total volume of 130 mL. The sample was put under agitation at 300 rpm and kept in a PID-controlled oven to operate at different temperatures.
Blank tests were performed with: i) the leaching solution without catalyst and ii) using distilled water as a leaching medium to verify the absence of analytical interferences. Blank tests revealed that platinum cannot be detected in the liquid, and a negligible amount of silicon and earth/alkali earth metals were measured as a consequence of the glass and catalyst dissolutions.
Two kinds of leaching tests were performed: equilibration tests and kinetic tests. During the equilibration tests, the leaching solution was tested for as long as 140 h and then a volume of the liquid was sampled, filtered using a 0.45 µm filter (Millipore, Burlington, United States), and collected in a glass vial. Then, the platinum content was measured using an Atomic Absorber Spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 265.9 nm for platinum detection, gap amplitude of 0.5 mm, and lamp current of 5 nm (AAS, model SpectrAA 220, Varian Inc., Palo Alto, United States). In selected tests, platinum and other metals were measured by using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS), conforming to the IRSA/CNR standard procedure for water analysis.
During kinetic tests, Vs = 1 mL of the leachate solutions were sampled at a fixed time interval. Given the concentration in the leaching solution, measured for each time sample tn, CL(tn), the initial volume of the leaching solution VL0, and the initial catalyst loading (q0 = 0.81 mg/g), the residual platinum content per unit mass of catalytic converter after N-samples (or at time tN) was calculated from the mass balance on the sample volume as:
(2)
The leaching efficiency at time tn, ηL(tn) was determined as:
(3)
The same equations can be used to describe the results of the equilibration tests, provided that no intermediate sampling was performed. Experiments include analysis of the following parameters:
1.
leaching temperatures (TL=20 °C, 50 °C, 90 °C);
2.
catalyst mean size (mean size among 212 and 300 µm, among 63 and 212 µm and less than 63 µm).
3.
Characteristics of the leaching solution, which were prepared with a fixed HCl concentration (0.4 M achieved with a 3.33% v/v percentage of the 37% w/w HCl), and variable hydrogen peroxide concentration (up to 0.2 M, achieved by using up to 7%v/v of 9% w/w H2O2 solutions).
2.2. Adsorption tests
According to the pertinent literature on platinum adsorption (see Table 1) and by similarities with palladium adsorption processes [39], the deposition of platinum chloride ions should follow several routes:
1.
Adsorption on electrophilic sites, σe [58]:
(4)
2.
Adsorption on protonated sites σH2+ [59]
(5)
3.
Adsorption and microprecipitation following surface reduction of platinum chloride species on reducing sites (like transition metals present as ashes on the sorbent, or lactones and phenols σOHx, [60], [61] available over the sorbent [62]:
(6)
According to Alfarra [63], the final result of the adsorption-reduction process is a covalent bond between the sorbent and the metal in its elemental form, i.e. Pt(0). This effect is expected to reduce the tendency to desorption.
Therefore, the adsorption of platinum is expected to depend on the acidity of the solution, the concentration and the characteristics of active surface sites over the GAC, and, of course, the solution temperature. Besides, adsorption is affected by the presence of other competing species and, in studies on model aqueous solutions, also the salinity and the detailed chemical speciation (cations and anions concentration) play an important role in determining the adsorption capacity of a sorbent.
However, in this work, the adsorption tests were performed by adding the GACs to the exhausted leaching solution. Therefore, the chemical composition of the solution, its pH, and the total concentration and characteristics of the GAC surface sites are defined. In light of these considerations, only the differences in adsorption capacity as a function of temperature were experimentally explored in this paper.
Tests were carried out on selected exhausted leaching solutions obtained after 140 h of contact with the catalyst previously filtered (using 0.45 µm pores) to eliminate all traces of catalyst from the sample. Leaching solutions either at TL= 20 or 90 °C and at different HCl/H2O2 initial loading were tested. The adsorption isotherms were reconstructed by contacting a fixed volume of the filtered exhaust leaching solution, VA, from 20 to 100 mL to a fixed mass of sorbent, mGAC in a well-stirred contactor at controlled temperature. In this way, it was possible to explore different operating conditions represented by several sorbent dosages, mGAC/VA. For a given exhaust leaching solution at concentration CL, the addition of a certain sorbent dosage gave rise to a specific partition of platinum between the liquid and the solid phases. The relation between the residual platinum concentration in the liquid phase (CA in mg/L) and the solid phase (the uptake capacity
was defined by the mass balance equation:
(7)
The ratio among the adsorption uptake capacity and the GAC surface area, previously determined by standard BET analyses, has been also calculated as follows:
(8)
Experiments were carried out at TA= 20, 60, and 90 °C; pressure was set at 1 bar.
Preliminary experiments were also performed using two other Granular Activated Carbons: a char from South African coal [64], hereinafter named S.A. Char, and an activated carbon produced by gasification of scrap tires (hereinafter called Tire Gasification Carbon, TGC), produced in a former experimental campaign [65]. Characteristics and properties of the three GACs were reported in Table S4 of Supplementary Materials. These preliminary tests were used to provide preliminary indications on the role of surface area and concentration of reducing surface sites on the platinum adsorption process.
Preliminary experiments indicated that adsorption approaches equilibrium conditions after 72 h with a stirring rate of 300 rpm. At the end of the test, 2 mL of solution were collected, filtered using a 0.45 µm PTFE filter, and measured using the same AAS methods adopted for the leaching tests. Blank tests were carried out to verify that: i) no platinum reduction can be observed in the exhaust leaching solution over time and ii) there was no platinum leaching associated with the immersion of the sorbent in clean HCl/H2O2 leaching solutions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Leaching test
Table 2 resumes the leaching efficiency and the platinum leachate concentration after a contact time of 140 h (see Table 2) with different HCl/H2O2 solutions at TL= 20 and 90 °C. Crushed, but not sieved catalyst particles were used. In the investigated conditions, for the initial platinum loading of the catalyst (q0 =0.81 mg/g) complete leaching conditions corresponded to CL,max= 81 mg/L.

Despite the lower chloride and acidity content, these experiments revealed that leaching solutions allow achieving efficiencies similar to those observed in other studies [10], [40], [41], [44], [66], [67] provided that longer contact times are used (140 h against the few hours of the other works). It is worth mentioning that, despite the lower HCl content, the leaching process still considered large excess of HCl and H2O2 with respect to the stoichiometric dosage virtually needed to oxidize all the platinum available on the catalyst (HCl 0.4 M, H2O2 0–0.2 M, Pt equivalent concentration CL,max=81 mg/L = 0.41 mM).
The leaching efficiency also indicates the need of increasing the H2O2 above 5%v/v (corresponding to 0.13 M) to allow the almost complete recovery of platinum at 20 °C, while at 90 °C, the efficiency appeared inversely proportional to the H2O2 content. The minimum concentration at 5% v/v (0.13 M) required for complete leaching of the catalyst is consistent with the former results of Yousif [41] and Hairanto [42].
An analysis of leaching kinetics was performed over 140 h on the crushed, but not sieved, catalyst for solutions containing 3.33% v/v of HCl alone and with the addition of 7% v/v of H2O2 at 20 °C (Fig. 1). The tests have been carried out at 20 °C with a dosage of leaching solution of VL0/mcat= 10 L/kg.

(Continuous Line represents the Lagergren model Eq. (9) with kc = 1.1·10−6 s−1 and 5.56·10−6 s−1 respectively for the sole HCl and the HCl/ H2O2 solutions, operating on the not sieved catalyst). (b) An exploded diagram of (a), considered in the first three hours of leaching experiments.
As it is possible to see in Fig. 1a, the tests revealed that the solution containing hydrogen peroxide approached a final concentration around 78 mg/L, corresponding to an extraction efficiency of 96.5% in 140 h. Differently, the solution containing only HCl at room temperature approached a concentration close to CL= 20 mg/L in 60 h and around 30 mg/L after 140 h, revealing a slower process evolution. After this time only around 37% of the available platinum was leached from the catalyst. Over so long-time scales, leaching kinetics were described by Lagergren pseudo-first order kinetics, as follows:
(9)
The analysis of leaching rate with the Lagergren model showed a good fitting of data with kc = 1.1·10−6 s−1 and 5.56·10−6 s−1 respectively for the sole HCl and the HCl/ H2O2 solutions and assuming Ceq = Ceq,max = 81 mg/L for both of them. The values of these kinetic constants are consistent with previous experimental observations on catalyst leaching; in particular, studies on the conversion of Pt(IV) to Pt(VI) in H2O2/HCl solutions indicated a chemical reaction kinetic control of the process and estimated kinetic constants in the order of 10−7-10−6 s−1, which increased by increasing the concentration of H2O2 and the solution temperature [68], [69].
However, zooming at the first hours of these two experiments (Fig. 1b), we also noticed the occurrence of a peculiar, non-linear behaviour of our system: the concentration of platinum firstly raised fast at the beginning of the process, approached a quasi-stationary condition within 3–6 h and then started to rise again, matching the overall trend shown on the larger time scale. This peculiar trend has been observed in those processes for which the dissolution is accompanied by a mechanical fragmentation of the solid, but may be also associated with a fast dissolution of superficial platinum, followed by slow dissolution of the platinum inside the washcoat.
To better exploit this last possibility, we also performed similar tests on the new generation catalysts with alumina-ceria-zirconia washcoats, which are used for their larger oxidation capacity [71], [72], [73]. In these cases, the leaching reached up to 30 mg/L within 3 h and the experiments follow very well the typical exponential-rise-to-maximum trend described by the Lagergren model (data not shown).
From these results, we argue that while the long-time evolution of platinum leaching is probably related to the reaction kinetics (Fig. 1a) - implying a scarce dependence on the mass transfer rates, and so on the stirring rate and size of the catalyst particles in a leaching unit - the short-time evolution might depend also on mass transfer phenomena (Fig. 1b) and worth further investigation for its importance in an industrial platinum recovery process.
Fig. 2 shows the results of experimental runs performed at 20 °C, 50 °C, and 90 °C in a solution containing 3.3% v/v HCl and 7% v/v H2O2 for a VL0/mCAT = 10 L/kg, for three different sieved catalyst size: the first class had an average particle size among 212 and 300 µm (average diameter of 257 µm), the second among 63 and 212 µm (average diameter of 132 µm) and the third below 63 µm (average diameter 21 µm).

Fig. 2 shows that, within the first three hours leaching, the concentration of platinum in solution did not overcome 3.4 mg/L (corresponding to a recovery efficiency η = 4.2%) at TL= 20 °C, around 9.4 mg/L (η = 11.6%) at TL= 50 °C and 22.5 mg/L (η = 27.8%) at TL= 90 °C. The leaching rate increased for the higher temperature and by the smaller catalyst grains size, indicating that for early times, mass transfer rate phenomena are likely to influence the leaching process. In comparison with other experiments carried out at larger HCl and chloride dosages [40], [41], [43], [44] the experiments demonstrated that the low chloride content gave rise to reduced leaching efficiency within the three hours contact time tested here. In addition, for the finer catalyst grain size (<63 µm), experiments were carried out at 90 °C for different H2O2 content (Fig. 3) and in 3.3% v/v HCl solutions at different temperatures (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4. Leaching of platinum in 3.3% v/v HCl solution at different temperatures. Lines represent guides for the eyes.
Fig. 3 reveals that in the three hours tests, the platinum recovery efficiency at 90 °C is higher for lower H2O2 content, obtaining an efficiency of around 26% for the 7% v/v hydrogen peroxide solution and an almost 100% for the solutions having less than 1% v/v hydrogen peroxide. Fig. 4 indicates that HCl solutions, with no addition of H2O2, were able to completely leach platinum from the catalyst at 90 °C. Indeed, the comparison of Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 shows that for a temperature of 20 and 50 °C, the leaching recoveries of 7% v/v H2O2 solutions are higher than those achieved for HCl solution with no H2O2 at the same temperatures (4.2% against 1.27% and 11.6% against 5.91% respectively). On the opposite, at 90 °C, the leaching efficiency appeared higher for HCl solution with no H2O2. These experimental results showed a complex interaction of temperature and H2O2 concentration over the leaching rate: while at low temperatures the addition of H2O2 was necessary to improve the leaching rate, at 90 °C the addition of H2O2 reduced the leaching rate. This finding is consistent with the experimental results [10], [17], as summarized in Table 1 on the combined effects of H2O2 concentration and solution temperature. As a final step of the leaching experiments, due to its importance on the subsequent adsorption step to recover platinum on activated carbons, the concentration of metal ions in leaching solutions (1% H2O2 at 90 °C and 0–7% H2O2 v/v at 20 °C after 140 h) were measured using ICP-MS. Results (Table S5 of Supplementary materials) showed that at TL= 20 °C mostly Na, Mg, Al, and lower content of Fe, W, and Cu were leached, while at TL= 90 °C all the species are leached at larger extents, with up to ten-folds increases for Co, Cu, Fe and Ca: the price to pay for a faster and more efficient platinum leaching at TL= 90 °C is lower selectivity respect to other species.
Although mass transfer phenomena have a measurable influence on the actual leaching rate of platinum, especially at low treatment times, several Authors pointed out that the leaching process is mostly related to the chemistry of platinum oxidation in chloride and hydrogen peroxide solutions [42], [43], [68]. In general, the dissolution of platinum to produce Pt2+ ions can be described by the standard reduction semi-reaction:
(10)
In presence of chlorides, also the following reduction semi-reaction can take place:
(11)
Tetrachloride ions will also form spontaneously and quickly once Pt(II) is formed and a large excess of Cl- is present in solution (as it is the case), according to the reaction:
(12)
It is worth highlighting that even in water at 25 °C, at high acidity, metallic platinum can be corroded in a narrow range of E(V) between 1 and 1.3, due to the onset of reactions with water and to the formation of Pt(OH)2, PtO2 and PtO3 species [69]. In presence of a high concentration of chloride ions, the concentration of these species is negligible with respect to those of PtCl4−2 and PtCl6−2. The oxidants available in solutions are H2O2, dissolved O2, and some products of HCl and H2O2 reactions, among which HOCl and Cl2. Murray et al. [70] reported the following reaction for HOCl formation:

Chlorine formation can be taken into account as the results of the following set of standard Redox half-cell reduction reactions:
(14)
(15)
(16)
which result in:
(17)
The reactions between water, hydrogen peroxide, and gaseous oxygen can be resumed by the following half-cell reduction reactions:
(18)
(19)
A detailed study on the chemical reaction kinetics of this process is beyond the scope of this work. However, it is worth mentioning that more information can be found in the paper of Murray et al. [68] which provided indications on the reaction mechanisms of Pt(II)/Pt(IV) oxidation in H2O2/HCl solutions. The authors showed that Pt(II) is oxidized in a network of reactions involving H2O2, HOCl and Cl2 and involving the formation of two intermediate compounds as trans-[PtCl4(H2O)2] and PtCl5(H2O). However, in the following, a description of the main redox reactions involved in the process is reported to shed light on the observed effects of the main process parameters.
The redox reaction between Pt/Pt+2 and hydrogen peroxide can be described as:
(20)
(21)
The oxidation of platinum due to chloride species can be written as:
(22)
(23)
(24)
(25)
The positive value of the reaction potential of the reactions from Eq.(20) to Eq.(25) simply that oxidation of Pt(0) under these routes is spontaneous.
Free oxygen can enter our system either from the reactions Eq.(18) and Eq.(19) or from the solubilization of the oxygen in the surrounding air. If oxygen is available in solution, the following reactions may take place only at higher temperatures:
(26)
(27)
Further dissolution of Pt2+ ions in chloride solutions including the formation of PtCl4−2 and PtCl6−2, can be resumed by the following set of half-cell reactions:
(28)
The reactions with H2O2, HOCl, and Cl2 are spontaneous and are the main responsible for the leaching of platinum at 20 °C. Among them, those producing PtCl4−2 ions are thermodynamically favoured thanks to a higher reduction potential. Besides, due to the large excess of chloride, once Pt2+ ions are formed, they are quickly complexed by chlorides to form PtCl4−2 ions, which is the dominant Pt(II) species available in solution. The tetrachloroplatinic ions can undergo further oxidation to hexachloroplatinic ions, PtCl6−2, which corresponds to a Pt(IV) oxidation state. The Nernst equation applied to the Pt(0)/HCl/H2O2 system explains why these processes are favoured by higher temperature and acidity. In fact, the Nernst equation indicates that higher temperatures increase the potential of the reactions, i.e. higher temperature promotes platinum dissolution (as well as that of other metal species on the catalyst). High temperatures further favour the reactions from Eq.(20) to Eq.(25), but also make possible the onset of direct oxygen oxidation through Eq.(26) and Eq.(27). On the other hand, however, higher temperatures also improve the conversion of Cl- in HOCl and Cl2 (17), while directing degradation of H2O2 into water (see Eq. (24)). Since Cl2 and O2 are in equilibrium with their vapour concentration, the reactions of platinum with Cl2 and O2 compete with the evaporation of these species. This evaporation further shifts rightward the reaction of Eq.(18), increasing the consumption of both H2O2 and HCl from the leaching solutions. Since H2O2 concentration is comparable with the HCl content, (as an example, 5%v/v H2O2 solution corresponds to 0.13 M solution and 3.3%v/v HCl corresponds to a 0.4 M solution), a large amount of HCl can be lost upon conversion of Cl2 and its subsequent evaporation. As shown also from the pertinent literature (see Table 1), a smaller HCl amount was expected to provide smaller platinum leaching. According to this observation, the authors envisage that in the experiments performed above 50 °C, the loss of HCl and Cl2 is more relevant than the oxidation improvement: at 90 °C, the process is so relevant that the lower is the hydrogen peroxide content, the lower is the loss of chloride, as Cl2, and the highest the leaching efficiency. In these conditions, dissolved oxygen is probably the main responsible for the leaching.
In conclusion, the competition between oxidation reactions and evaporation of gaseous species can explain why hydrogen peroxide is needed to improve leaching at low temperatures but worsen the leaching at high temperatures, as shown in our experiments and former observations (see the cited literature in Table 1).
3.2. Adsorption
The adsorption tests were carried out on exhaust leaching solutions obtained after 140 h of contact time. Considering the experimental findings, adsorption tests were carried out on all the leaching solutions tested at TL= 20 °C and on those used for the TL= 90 °C leaching containing 0, 1, or 2.5% v/v of H2O2.
In the following data, the adsorption isotherms at TA = 20 °C of platinum over the GCN1240 in different leaching solutions: Fig. 5 reports adsorption data obtained using the exhaust leaching solutions from tests performed at TL = 20 °C, while data on exhaust leaching solutions tested at TL= 90 °C are shown in Fig. 6.

Fig. 6. Adsorption uptake capacity at 20 °C on the GCN1240 in exhaust leaching solutions (3.3% v/v HCl, different peroxide concentrations used for leaching at 90 °C).
Fig. 5 shows that the platinum adsorption capacity from exhaust leaching solutions at TL= 20 °C was scarcely influenced by their initial H2O2 content until this was below 5%. Differently, it lowered by almost 70% when the initial H2O2 content was equal to 7%v/v. The adsorption capacity of the GCN1240 in the real leachate solution was also compared with experiments in model aqueous solutions containing 3.3% v/v HCl in distilled water, starting from 81 mg/L platinum concentration. The experimental results showed that the adsorption in real leaching solutions at TL= 20 °C and H2O2 ≤ 5% v/v were similar to those observed in model conditions. This result suggests that, as long as the H2O2 was lower than 5% v/v, a negligible competition between Pt and other leached metals (see Table S5) can be observed. The analysis of metals leached from the catalyst at TL= 20 °C (see Table S5) did not indicate any particular variation in its ion composition that can justify a higher competition at 7%v/v H2O2. Further efforts are needed to better investigate this reduced adsorption efficiency at 7%v/v H2O2, but the authors envisage that a possible explanation of the H2O2 concentration effect can be found in the interactions between residual H2O2, HOCl, and Cl2 species in the leaching solutions, that can oxidize the GAC, reducing active sites that participate to platinum uptake.
The adsorption capacity of the GCN1240 on an exhaust leaching solution tested at TL= 90 °C is lower than those observed for the same solution used for leaching at TL= 20 °C (Fig. 6). Authors envisaged that the main responsible for this result is the higher concentration of transition metals ions (such as Fe, Cu, Zn, Co, Al, as reported in Supplementary Materials Table S5) leached from the catalyst at TL= 90 °C leaching: these ions compete with platinum for the same adsorption sites at an extent far larger than that observed at 20 °C, where negligible effects appeared until the H2O2 content was ≤ 5% v/v. Table S6 in the Supplementary material reports the concentration of other metallic ions in solution after adsorption. The experiments revealed that platinum remained the main adsorbed species, but the contribution from other ions (mostly Al, Cu, Fe, and Co) may count for up to 50% of the total metal uptake on the activated carbon after leaching at 90 °C while being slightly above 10% when adsorption is applied to 20 °C leaching solutions.
Besides, the experimental data in Fig. 6 showed a non-monotonic dependence on the adsorption capacity against the H2O2 content in the 90 °C leaching solutions: the adsorption of platinum was higher in a 3.3% v/v HCl containing 1% v/v H2O2 solution rather than into a sole 3.3% v/v HCl solution, while a strong reduction of the adsorption capacity is observed for a 2.5% v/v H2O2 solution. To date, the authors are not able to explain this finding.
Fig. 7 shows the platinum uptake capacity of the GCN1240 in exhaust leaching solutions (3.3% v/v HCl, 1% H2O2) prepared at TL= 90 °C and tested at TA of 20 °C, 60 °C, and 90 °C respectively. These final experiments were aimed to simulate possible adsorption variations, in case the hot leaching solutions are cooled down.

Fig. 7. Pt adsorption uptake capacity on GCN1240 as a function of temperature on 90 °C exhaust leaching solutions containing 3% v/v HCl and 1% v/v H2O2.
Fig. 7 shows that an increase in the adsorption temperature determined a reduction of the uptake capacity of platinum. This result mirrors the well-known exothermicity of adsorption processes and suggests that differently from other similar conditions, such as the adsorption of mercury chloride [58], the effect of temperature on the chemical speciation of platinum chloride species is less relevant than the adsorption process in determining the actual uptake capacity.
A modelling analysis was performed using the Langmuir, the Freundlich, and the Temkin theoretical equations, which are, respectively:
(29)
(30)
(31)
The parameters of the Langmuir equations are the maximum adsorption capacity,
, and the equilibrium constant for the site-solute adsorption reaction, KA. The variables a and b are the main parameters of the Freundlich model, related, respectively, to the sorbent adsorption capacity and the energy of interaction. The parameters BT and AT of the Temkin model are related to the heat of adsorption and the energy of interaction between solute and sorbent sites. The Langmuir and Temkin equations can explicitly consider the process temperature. For the Langmuir equation, this can be done considering constant the maximum adsorption capacity and assuming:
(32)
where
and
are the main enthalpy and entropy of the adsorption process in standard conditions, respectively.
The application of Temkin, Freundlich and Langmuir equations to the description of experimental data are resumed in Table 3, which reports the fitting parameters for the different tests, their relative error of estimation, and the value of the coefficient of determination R2.

The modelling analysis of the uptake isotherms indicated that adsorption of 20 °C leaching solution with ≤ 5% v/v H2O2, can be well described by a linear isotherm, which, mathematically, corresponds to a Freundlich equation with b= 1. All the other adsorption isotherms can be well described by any of the three adsorption models, but none of them can provide a general equation for the process, neither to describe the temperature effects. This suggests that platinum uptake is a complex process that probably involves more than a simple interaction between platinum species and the sorbent’s activated sites. Further efforts will be devoted to this subject in the future.
Finally, a set of experiments were performed on the 3.3% v/v HCl, 1% v/v hydrogen peroxide solution at TL= 90 °C using the three GAC types, operating with a volume to mass ratio of VA/mGAC = 0.1 mL/mg. These tests are aimed to preliminary investigate how some properties of the GAC can influence the adsorption efficiency. In fact, with respect to the GCN1240, the S.A. Char has a far lower surface area, but a larger concentration of reducing C-O sites surface [74]; the TGC instead has a similar surface area but is rich in sulfur which, according to hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB), may provide selective interactions with the platinum ions [63].
The experiments revealed that the S.A. Char allowed a lower platinum uptake capacity (2 μmol/g), but a larger number of metal moles adsorbed per surface unit (0.18 μmol/m2) with respect to the other carbons. Instead, the TGC had a ωΑ= 6 μmol/g and ωs = 0.01 μmol/m2. Both the values are lower with respect to the GCN1240, which has ωΑ = 15 μmol/g and ωs = 0.013 μmol/m2. The experimental results indicate that although sulfur sites of the TGC are known to provide higher energy bonding with the platinum, they gave rise to no apparent advantage with respect to the C-O sites of the GCN1240 in this condition. Besides, the higher content of reducing sites of the S.A. char provided higher capture efficiencies per unit surface. These preliminary findings suggested that the adsorption process appears favoured by the higher surface area and higher concentration of reducing surface sites.
4. Conclusions
This paper reports experimental results on a hydrometallurgical process for the extraction and recovery of platinum from virgin diesel catalysts with an alumina washcoat. These were largely used in the past years and probably represent an appreciable percentage of the catalyst wastes available nowadays. The process consists of the sequence of a mild platinum leaching step in aqueous solutions containing H2O2 and HCl at different temperatures, followed by the recovery of the metal on activated carbons from the leachate solution. Table 4 presents a summary of the process steps and the main paper findings.

An analysis of the time-courses of the leaching process was performed to explore the role of H2O2 at ambient temperature. These curves (Fig. 1) suggest that for catalysts with alumina washcoat, the long-time evolution of the process follows a first-order kinetic trend, but for short times, more complex phenomena, including fragmentation and diffusional effects, occur.
Although the analysis of reaction kinetics is beyond the scope of this work, the analysis of the thermodynamic aspects of the redox reactions involved in the leaching process allowed to shed light on some of the experimental findings observed in this work. Experimental data revealed that the leaching process involves a series of oxidants such as H2O2, Cl2, HOCl, and O2 but also includes evaporation of chlorine and degradation of H2O2. These two last phenomena become relevant at higher temperatures, making undesirable the addition of H2O2 for leaching above 50 °C. Above this temperature, O2 in the headspace of the vials is probably the main oxidant.
By studying the effects of operating parameters in the first three hours of observation, the fastest platinum recovery was achieved at a temperature of 90 °C and 1% v/v H2O2 concentration for finely granulated catalyst particles (<63 µm). However, the use of higher temperatures led to a lower selectivity of the leaching process, with several metals (among which Al, Ca, Cu, Co, Fe, Sn) leached from the catalyst. This aspect (which to the best of our knowledge was not covered in other papers) has a detrimental effect on the following adsorption process and poses a potential limit for the reuse of the spent HCl solution. Therefore, although the time required for the leaching process is longer, the optimal leaching solution in our tests is the one at HCl 3.3% v/v and H2O2 5% v/v.
Adsorption tests revealed that conventional activated carbon has appreciable adsorption capacity towards platinum; moreover, adsorption benefits for a lower concentration of H2O2 and other transition metal ions (derived from catalyst leaching) in the spent leaching solution. This can be eventually achieved by working with up to 5% H2O2 at TL=TA= 20 °C, which is confirmed to be the optimal operating condition for the combined leaching-adsorption process.
In a prudential estimation, recalling that 1 g of catalyst contains 0.81 mg of platinum, and assuming (this is a possible underestimation of the actual sorbent capabilities) that the maximum adsorption capacity of the GCN1240 corresponds to the highest experimental value registered here (41 mg/g), there is a minimum 50-fold concentration factor of the platinum in the activated carbon compared to the original catalyst. This is to be considered as an underestimation because the adsorption process can be instead operated to saturate completely the activated carbon at the leaching concentration.
The promising results of this experimental work suggest further development of the leaching-adsorption process for platinum recovery from spent diesel catalytic converters. In particular, this laboratory is now starting experimental campaigns on different kinds of activated carbons aimed to exploit the use of platinum-loaded carbon for: i) recover metallic platinum with a controlled pyrolysis/incineration [75] ii) application to other industrial catalysis applications [76], or iii) production of electrodes for electrochemical processes [77], [78].
