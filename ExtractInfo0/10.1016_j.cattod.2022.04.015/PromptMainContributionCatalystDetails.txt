Modulation of surface chemistry by boron modification to achieve a superior VOX/Al2O3 catalyst in propane dehydrogenation
The VOX/Al2O3 is known as an active catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation, however, with poor stability due to the severe coking problem. In this study, the VOX/Al2O3 catalyst was modified by boric acid, and the catalyst exhibited significantly improved stability and less coke deposition than the unmodified counterpart. The experimental results and theoretical modeling (DFT) suggested that the boron decreased the polymerization degree of VOX species, generated a high proportion of isolated vanadium species that reduced the initial activity but enhanced the stability of VOX/Al2O3 catalyst. Boron interacted with Al and V forming B-O-Al and B-O-V bonds, which significantly reduced the amounts of both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, alleviating the coke deposition rate on the catalyst surface. The boron on VOX/Al2O3 promoted the desorption of propylene that inhibited further cracking and its polymerization, thus improving the propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.
1. Introduction
As an important chemical intermediate, propylene is traditionally produced by naphtha steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes. However, the above two processes have high energy consumption and low atomic efficiencies, incurring a high separation cost. With the increasing demand for propylene in the market, it has become imperative for petrochemical enterprises to develop economical and efficient propylene production processes. The on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process uses propane in shale gas and natural gas as feedstock to produce propylene, possessing a high atomic utilization efficiency [1], [2]. The main commercial PDH processes are the Oleflex process using Pt-based catalyst and the Catofin process using Cr-based catalyst [3], [4], [5], [6]. However, due to the high cost of Pt-based catalysts and the toxicity of Cr-based catalysts, it is desired to develop alternatives to these two catalysts.
As an alternative, the vanadium-based catalyst exhibited high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane attracted considerable attention [7]. However, when applied in the propane dehydrogenation, VOX/Al2O3 catalysts tend to deactivate rapidly due to the severe coking in the high temperature operation, which will release significant CO2 emission during the coke combustion [8].
As a common modifier, alkali metal such as K was often used as a dopant for the VOX-based catalyst to adjust the surface acidity [9]. Besides that, alkali earth metal, like Mg, was also used to modify the VOX/Al2O3 catalyst; the addition of Mg was found to enhanced the catalyst selectivity due to the reduced coke formation as a result of the tuned surface acidity [10]. In addition, Mg was revealed to favor the dispersion of 3D crystalline V2O5 into 2D VOX species, which reduced the coke formation and increased the stability of the catalyst [11]. In our recent work, the VOX/Al2O3 catalyst modified by gaseous PH3 was found to improve considerably the stability of the catalyst. The catalyst with the highest P/V ratio (0.86) exhibited the highest stability with negligible deactivation during 8 h of reaction. The enhanced stability of the catalyst after the PH3 modification was attributed to three main factors: (i) modified surface acidity, (ii) segregation of polymerized vanadium species into isolated ones, and (iii) weaken interactions between vanadium and alumina support, which is favorable for the desorption of propylene, inhibiting the formation of coke and alleviating the deactivation of catalyst [12].
As reported previously, boron is an effective promoter that significantly reduced coking deposit and enhanced the stability of Ni catalysts [13], [14]. By introducing 1.0% of boron to Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for the steam reforming of methane, the initial methane conversion was increased from 56% to 61%. The amount of coke deposit was reduced by 80% and the deactivation rate co-efficient of catalyst was lowered by a factor of 3. The boron was revealed to possess similar chemisorption preference on Ni particles based on DFT calculations [15], which selectively blocked the step and sub-surface octahedral sites, preventing the carbon buildup on these sites. Borated alumina supported Ni catalysts with different B2O3 loadings were evaluated in the dry reforming of methane [13]. B2O3 was found to be effective in tuning the particle size of Ni and also in modifying the surface acidity of alumina. The loading of B2O3 had a strong effect on the catalyst performance. Adding 1 wt% of B2O3 eliminated all weak surface Lewis acid sites and basic Al-OH sites, leaving only strong Lewis acid sites that resulted in the fast deposition of coke and rapid deactivation of the catalyst. Doping 10 wt% of B2O3 caused the formation of large Ni particles and strong Lewis acidic boron sites, resulting in fast coke accumulation. In contrast, adding 5 wt% of B2O3 produced weak Lewis acidic boron sites and provided more basic O-H groups, which promoted the gasification of coke deposit and improved the catalyst stability.
In this work, we report on the modification of VOX/Al2O3 catalyst using boric acid and the effect on its performance in the propane dehydrogenation. The modified surface chemistry of catalysts was correlated with the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All materials were used as received without further purification. Boric acid (H3BO3) and oxalic acid (C2H2O4·2H2O) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) and absolute ethanol (CH3CH2OH) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and XiLONG SCIENTIFIC, respectively. Propane (C3H8) was purchased from Shanghai Shenkai Gas Co., Ltd.

All chemicals were used as received.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
Vanadium catalysts modified with boron were prepared by wetness impregnation. Taking the catalyst with a B/Al molar ratio of 0.05 as an example, 0.606 g of boric acid (H3BO3) was dissolved in 12.6 mL deionized water, and then 12 g of pseudoboehmite was added into the solution. The mixture was stirred for 10 min, and then transferred into a water bath at 70 °C for 4 h. Then the mixture was dried at 100 °C for 12 h and thus the obtained sample was denoted as Al2O3-S, where S represented the amount of H3BO3 used. Following that, vanadium was loaded onto the above Al2O3-S sample. In a typical step, 5.738 g of oxalic acid (C2H2O4·2H2O) was dissolved in 10 mL deionized water, followed by the addition of 2.084 g of NH4VO3; a dark blue solution was formed (vanadium loading was 10 wt%). The above Al2O3-S sample was added to the solution, stirred at 70 °C for 15 min, treated at 70 °C for 4 h, and dried at 100 °C for 12 h. The obtained solid was calcined at 550 °C for 10 h with a ramping rate of 2 °C /min. The catalysts with and without boron modification were denoted as VOX/Al2O3 and VOX/Al2O3-S, respectively (B/AlS).
2.3. Catalyst characterization
N2 adsorption measurements of the catalysts were performed on a TriStar II 3020. The specific surface area of the catalysts was calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and the pore size distribution was calculated by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were collected on a PANalytical diffractometer. The operating current and voltage were 40 mA and 35 kV, respectively. Cu Kα radiation was used with the incident wavelength of 0.1542 nm. The diffraction angle range was 5–75° with a scanning rate of 2 °/min.
The carbon deposit on catalysts after reaction was analyzed by thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) using a NETZSCH STA 449 F5. A HCT-1 microthermal analyzer with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used. The analysis was conducted in air atmosphere from room temperature to 675 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C /min.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study of samples was performed using a Ulvac-Phi analyzer. The excitation light source of Al Kα with an energy of 18.2 W and a test angle of 45° was used. The binding energy (BE) for C 1 s of 284.8 eV was used as a reference to determine the binding energies of other elements.
UV–vis spectra were measured using a SPECORD 210 + spectrophotometer. The UV–vis spectra were collected in the range of 200–800 nm, and the powder BaSO4 was used as a background.
Raman spectra were collected on a DXR Raman spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a wavelength of the light source of 532 nm.
Pyridine adsorption on samples was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Py-FTIR) using a NEXUS infrared spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a MCT detector cooled by liquid nitrogen. The acid site content was calculated by the semi-quantitative method proposed by Emeis [16].
Solid state 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was carried out on an Arane 400M Bruker spectrometer with a 4 mm three-resonance probe. The pulse length was 0.5 μs (< π/12). The nuclear magnetic resonance frequency was 192.5 MHz and the torsional rate was 12 kHz. The NMR chemical displacement of the sample was calibrated using saturated H3BO3 solution as a calibration material.
2.4. Catalyst evaluation in propane dehydrogenation
The catalysts were evaluated in a fixed-bed micro-reactor. The reactor is a quartz tube with an internal diameter of 8 mm and a length of 60 mm. Before evaluation, the catalyst was pelleted, crushed and sieved to 20–60 mesh. 0.5 g of catalyst was placed in the middle of the reactor and reduced at 600 °C for 2 h. A mixture of N2 and C3H8 (volume ratio of 95: 5) with a total flow rate 30 mL/min was introduced to the reactor at the same temperature. The product was analyzed by an online GC7820A gas chromatograph. The sampling interval was 15 min.
The conversion of propane, propylene yield and propylene selectivity, as well as the yield and selectivity of by-products C1 +C2 were calculated by the carbon atom number balance method using the following equations:
SY/X
The above X, Y, S and N represent propane conversion, propylene yield, propylene selectivity and carbon atom numbers, respectively.
2.5. DFT calculations
Through the first-principle calculation, the adsorption energies of propane and propylene on the surface of the catalyst were obtained, thereby gaining insights into the mechanism of variations in the catalyst selectivity and carbon deposition behavior after boron modification. The first-principle calculation was done using a Dmol3 package based on density functional theory (DFT). The general gradient approximation - Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) exchange related functional was used to calculate using a high-precision double-numerical basis with polarization functions (DNP). DFT semi-core pseudopotentials (DSPP) were used to process the inner electrons. The real space orbital cutoff was chosen to be 4.4 Å, and all calculations were spin-polarized. In the structure optimization process, the convergence accuracy of the selected energy was 1 × 10−5 ha, the convergence accuracy of the force was 2 × 10−3 ha/Å, and the displacement convergence accuracy was 5 × 10−3 Å.
The adsorption energy was calculated according to the formula: Eads=Esub+C3H6-Esub-EC3H6, where Esub+C3H6, Esub, EC3H6 are the total energy after propylene adsorption, the energy of the catalyst substrate, and the energy of propylene, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Propane dehydrogenation performance of born modified VOX/Al2O3 catalysts
All catalysts show a high initial activity within the first 1.5 h with the highest propane conversion and highest propylene selectivity (Fig. 1). After that, the activity of all catalysts gradually decreased with time. The parent VOX/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits the highest initial propane conversion, which reaches about 82% at the maximum, and gradually reduces to about 31% after 7 h of reaction. While the initial propane conversion using the boron modified catalysts is lower. Among them, the VOX/Al2O3-0.05 catalyst shows the best performance. The maximum propane conversion using the VOX/Al2O3-0.05 catalyst is about 79% and decreased to 36% after 7 h of reaction. Although the initial reactivity of the boron modified catalysts are slightly lower than that of the original catalyst, their propane conversion exceeds that of the parent VOX/Al2O3 catalyst after 2 h of reaction. In addition, the propane conversion rate of some modified catalysts increased at the beginning of the reaction, which may be due to the gradual reduction of V5+ to V3+ and V4+. It is generally recognized that V3+ and V4+ have higher dehydrogenation activities. With the prolongation of the reaction time, carbon deposits accumulate on the catalyst surface, resulting in a decrease in the catalyst activity.

Fig. 1. Catalytic performance of unmodified (VOX/Al2O3) and boron modified (VOX/Al2O3-0.05, ‐0.1, ‐0.15, ‐0.2) catalysts in PDH reactions: (a) Conversion of propane; (b) Selectivity of propylene; (c) Yield of propylene; (d) Space time yield of propylene.
The same trend for the propylene selectivity as for the propane conversion of all catalysts is observed, i.e., the highest selectivity was measured within the first 1.5 h reaction and then decreased. Most of the modified catalysts show a higher propylene selectivity than that of the unmodified one. The catalysts VOX/Al2O3-0.10 and VOX/Al2O3-0.15 achieve the highest propylene selectivity of about 75% among all catalysts. Due to the improved selectivity towards propylene of the modified catalyst, the initial propylene yield of these two catalysts exceeds the parent one after 0.5 h. The propylene yield of all modified catalysts exceeds that of the parent catalyst after 3 h reaction. Fig. 1(d) shows the space time yield (STY) of propylene within 7 h of reaction. As can be seen, after 7 h, the STY of propylene produced by the boron modified catalysts exceeded that of the parent catalyst except for the VOX/Al2O3-0.20. Sample VOX/Al2O3-0.05 achieved the highest STY of propylene, 1.44 mmol·g−1·h−1, which is higher than that of the parent VOX/Al2O3 catalyst by 0.18 mmol·g−1·h−1. Considering the large-scale industrial process for PDH, say a million tons of propane processed per year, the achieved enhancement of the propylene STY with the boron modified catalyst would bring a considerable profit for the chemical enterprises.
The main by-products in this reaction are methane, ethane and ethylene (C1 +C2). In order to further understand the effect of boron on the catalyst selectivity, the yield and selectivity of C1 +C2 were calculated and presented in Fig. S1. The parent VOX/Al2O3 catalyst shows a high C1 +C2 yield of about 28% at the beginning of the reaction, indicating its high cracking activity. All boron modified catalysts exhibit more stable C1 +C2 yield than that of the unmodified parent catalyst. Except for the VOX/Al2O3-0.05 catalyst, all catalysts maintained a relatively stable C1 +C2 yield of about 18% during 7 h reaction. The selectivity of C1 +C2 presents an opposite trend with propylene selectivity, and the C1 +C2 selectivity for all catalysts increases with time on stream (TOS), implying that the cracking activity of the catalyst was gradually enhanced during reaction. This may be due to the enhanced thermal cracking caused by the blocking of active VOx sites by carbon deposition. The activity can be partially recovered by catalyst regeneration as shown by the regeneration performance of the catalyst in Fig. S2.
3.2. Textural and structural properties of catalysts
The XRD patterns of catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. The characteristic peaks of γ-Al2O3 at 37.5°, 45.9° and 67.0° (JCPDS Card No. 10–0425) are present in the XRD patters indicating that the γ-Al2O3 is the main crystalline phase [17]. With increasing the amount of B used for the modification of the catalysts, the intensity of the diffraction peaks of γ-Al2O3 decreased gradually and the peaks widened. A broad peak at 28° appears in the patterns of all boron modified catalysts, attributed to the presence of B2O3 [15], [18], [19]. With the increase of B content in the modified catalysts, the peak intensity gradually increased, indicating that the dispersion of boron gradually decreased and the B2O3 crystals may form on the surface of the γ-Al2O3. Moreover, the characteristic peaks of vanadium oxide did not appear in the XRD patterns of all catalysts, indicating that vanadium dispersed well on the surface of the γ-Al2O3 support and did not aggregate to form individual vanadium oxide crystals.

All catalysts present a type IV isotherm with a type H-2 hysteresis loop indicating the ink-bottle type mesopores (Fig. 3) [20]. With the increase of the B/Al ratio of the catalysts, the specific surface area decreases from 308 to 229 m2/g indicating the formation of catalysts with bigger particle sizes (Table 1). In general, the addition of the boron modifier did not change significantly the structure of the catalysts. The pores with a diameter of 7.5 nm are present in the catalysts (Fig. 3), indicating that the surface of the catalysts is modified, and VOX and B2O3 did not significantly block the catalysts pores. Although the dehydrogenation activity of catalysts may be affected by the decrease of specific surface area, it is not the main reason for the difference in catalyst performance. For instance, sample VOX/Al2O3 and VOX/Al2O3-0.05 possess similar specific surface area, but the former has a higher initial activity and a lower stability than that of the latter.

VOX/Al2O3-0.15 252 7.6 0.50
VOX/Al2O3-0.20 229 7.6 0.45
In general, boron modified catalysts exhibited similar crystalline and textural properties as the parent untreated catalyst, which cannot explain the large difference in the catalytic performance before and after boron modification, especially the difference in the propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.
3.3. UV−vis spectroscopy analysis of catalysts
The UV–vis spectra of the catalysts contain bands assigned to electron transfer from ligand to metal O2-→V5+(d0) (Fig. 4(a)). Wide absorption peaks appeared before 400 nm [21], [22], [23], while no shoulder peak was observed between 400 and 600 nm, indicating that vanadium species on the surface mainly existed as highly dispersed VOX. No V2O5 crystals were present [9] and the absence of V3+ is confirmed [24], [25], [26]. This finding is consistent with the XRD results (Fig. 2). By referring to the spectra of vanadium model compounds [22], [23], absorption bands observed at around 275 and 310 nm were attributed to isolated vanadium species and low-polymerized VOX species with tetrahedral ligands linked by V–O–V bridge bonds [27], [28]. No visible absorption peaks between 350 and 400 nm, indicating that highly polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated and twisted octahedrally coordinated V5+ species were almost absent or rare on the catalysts surface. Furthermore, the wavelength (λg) of the boron modified samples is moving towards short wavelength direction, also indicating a high dispersion of vanadium species on the catalyst surface. After modification, the absorption peak at 208 nm possibly caused by the ligand to metal charge transfer effect of O2- to V4+ is significantly higher than that of the unmodified catalyst [29], and this peak becomes more evident with increasing the B/Al ratio, suggesting that the boron modification may increase the amount of V4+ on the catalyst surface [30].

In addition, the band gap energy (Eg) was calculated using the wavelength (λg) according to the following equation:[31], [32], [33].
Since the band gap energy (Eg) decreases with the increase of V concentration on the catalyst surface, the band gap energy can be used to evaluate the degree of VOX polymerization. A lower band gap energy indicates a higher ratio of polymerized to isolated VOX species [8], [34]. The band gap energy of modified catalysts gradually increases with the increase of the B/Al ratio, suggesting that the degree of VOX polymerization gradually decreases with the increase of the B/Al ratio, and more isolated vanadium species are formed (Table 2). The catalytic activities of vanadium species in the oligomeric states are higher than those in isolated states [35], [36], [37], which reasonably explains the catalyst performance. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the initial propane conversion decreases with the increase of B/Al ratios.

VOX/Al2O3-0.20 479 2.59
3.4. Raman spectroscopy analysis of catalysts
The Raman spectra of catalysts before and after boron modification are shown in Fig. 4(b). All vanadium catalysts show a wide spectrum peak in the range of 900–1050 cm−1, which is attributed to the symmetric stretching vibration of the terminal VO bond [22], [38], [39]. A very weak band is observed in the parent VOX/Al2O3 catalyst at around 920 cm−1, which is ascribed to the V–O–V stretching vibration of polymeric vanadium species [40]. This band gradually disappears with the increase of the B/Al ratio, indicating that some V–O–V bonds were replaced by new B–O–V bonds [41], which reduces the polymerization degree of vanadium species on the catalyst surface. It further verified that the boron modification improved the dispersion of vanadium species on catalyst surface and increased the number of isolated vanadium species. There are no sharp peaks at 990 cm−1 and 485 cm−1 (the strength of these peaks are generally about twice as strong as the peak generated by the stretching vibration of VO bonds), indicating that there were no V2O5 crystals on the catalyst surface [42], which is consistent with the XRD and UV–vis results. For all samples, there are weak bands at 488 and 823 cm−1 due to V–O–V stretching vibration or V–O–Al antisymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations, indicating the presence of polymerized vanadium species on the catalysts surface. In addition, the sharp but low-intensity peak at 145 cm−1 representing crystalline vanadium oxide disappeared after boron modification. These results suggest that the boron modification reduced the concentration of polymerized vanadium species or resulted in the formation of new bonds, such as the B–O–V bonds.
3.5. XPS analysis of catalysts
XPS technique was used to study the state of boron and vanadium on the catalyst surface. Since the catalysts were calcined in air, only tetravalent and pentavalent vanadium species exist on the catalyst surface before reduction. The characteristic peaks of V 2p3/2 were deconvoluted into two peaks assigned to V4+ and V5+ (Fig. 5) [23], [43]. As is shown in Table 3, before boron modification, vanadium species on the catalyst surface were mostly in the form of V5+, accounting for 63.9% with an average valence state of 4.64. The ratio of V4+ gradually increased from 41.4% to 75.4% and the average valence state decreased from 4.59 to 4.25 with the increase of the B/Al ratio from 0.05 to 0.2 for the boron modified catalysts. It has been recognized that the VOx species (V5+, V4+, and V3+ ions) on the catalyst exhibit different propane dehydrogenation activities, and that the V3+ and V4+ ions are more active than the V5+ ions [42], [44], [45]. Under the reaction conditions, samples with lower average valence can generate more V3+ and V4+ for dehydrogenation, which explains well that the catalysts modified with boron have higher stability. Moreover, the atomic concentration of surface vanadium atoms slightly reduced when the B/Al ratio increased from 0.05 to 0.15, indicating that the boron modification mainly reduced the average valence state of vanadium without significant change of vanadium content on the catalyst surface. However, with the B/Al ratio increasing to 0.2, the relative content of vanadium atoms on the catalyst surface decreases from about 3–2.5%, which may partially explain the lowest initial activity of the VOX/Al2O3-0.20 catalyst, although it has the lowest average valence state.

The characteristic XPS peak of B 1 s is shown in Fig. 6 with a binding energy of about 192 eV. According to previous reports [46], [47], the BE of B 1 s in H3BO3 is about 193.2 eV. And the BE range of B3+ in borate or a mixture of boron oxides is about 192.2–193.5 eV [47], [48], [49]. By referring to the BE of boron oxides, the closest one is 9Al2O3-2B2O3, which has a B 1 s BE of 192.5 eV [49]. It means that part of the boron in the modified catalysts exist as the boria-alumina mixed oxides. The peak strength of the catalyst with a ratio of B/Al= 0.2 was significantly higher than that of the catalyst with a ratio of B/Al= 0.05. By calculating the ratio of I(B 1 s)/I(Al 2p) in the XPS spectra, the dispersion of boron on the surface of γ-Al2O3 could be obtained. The theoretical ratio of I(B 1 s)/I(Al 2p) was calculated by adopting the single-layer molecular model of Kerkhof and Moulijn [50], in which the photoionization cross-sections of B 1 s and Al 2p are 0.486 and 0.356 respectively [51] (the escape depth of Al 2p electrons in Penn table was used) [52]. When the B/Al ratio increased from 0.05 to 0.2, the theoretical values of I(B 1 s)/I(Al 2p) were about 0.75 and 0.3, respectively. For the catalyst with B/Al ratio of 0.05, the theoretical value of I(B 1 s)/I(Al 2p) is in a good agreement with the calculated value, indicating that at this B/Al ratio, boron formed a new Al–O–B bridge bond on the surface of γ-Al2O3 by interacting with the surface Al–OH group, so that boron atoms existed on the surface of γ-Al2O3 as a uniform single molecular layer (Fig. 6(b)). With increasing the ratio of B/Al to 0.2, the experimental value of I(B 1 s)/I(Al 2p) showed a large deviation from the theoretical, suggesting that at this point, the basic Al–OH group on γ-Al2O3 surface had been completely replaced by B–O–Al, and the excess boron existed as boria-alumina mixed oxide on the surface. As the experimental results deviate from the theoretical value of I(B 1 s)/I(Al 2p) for catalysts with B/Al ratio above 0.07, the boron amount on the catalyst surface with B/Al ratios of 0.1–0.15 exceeds the monolayer limit and existed as boria-alumina mixed oxides. Saih et al [53]. carried out a detailed in situ FT-IR study on γ-Al2O3 before and after boron modification. It was found that after H3BO3 modification, the intensity of the characteristic peak of Al–OH group in the γ-Al2O3 was significantly weakened, accompanied with the appearance of a new peak attributed to the stretching vibration of B–OH. This peak becomes sharper with the increase of the B/Al ratio, indicating that H3BO3 reacted with the basic Al–OH group on γ-Al2O3 surface to form a B–OH group by forming Al–O–B bridge bonds, which engendered a stable boria-alumina layer that covered the catalyst surface.

3.6. Coke deposition behavior of catalysts
It has been widely accepted that the carbon deposition generated during reaction covers the catalyst surface, preventing propane from access to the active sites of VOX catalysts. In order to evaluate the carbon deposition [54], [55], the catalyst after the reaction was characterized by TG-DTA. The TG-DTA curves of the catalysts after 7 h of reaction are shown in the Fig. 7. The carbon content of the catalysts measured is summarized in Table 4. As shown in Fig. 7, all TG curves exhibit a low weight loss before 177 °C, and the corresponding DTA curves exhibit an endothermic peak associated with the removal of physically adsorbed water on the catalyst surface [53]. With the temperature increasing, the thermogravimetric curves show an obvious weight loss above 427 °C with the corresponding exothermic peak in the DTA curves, indicating the combustion of coke deposit on the catalyst surface. All boron modified catalysts exhibit a lower coke amount and the weight loss gradually decreases with the increase of B/Al ratio (Table 4). Quite surprisingly, the VOX/Al2O3-0.20 catalyst produced much lower coke (6.71 wt%) than that on the unmodified parent catalyst (16.53 wt%). Combined the above results (UV–visible spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and XPS), we can conclude that with the increase of B/Al ratio, the dispersion of surface VOX species increased and polymeric vanadium species were transformed into oligomeric state or isolated vanadium species. As was previously reported [8], [56], the carbon deposition on the catalyst surface was positively correlated with the polymerization degree of vanadium species, which explains the lower coke amount in the modified catalysts compared with the unmodified one. Additionally, the catalytic results suggested that the boron modification reduced the coke deposit on the catalyst surface, and consequently improved the catalyst stability. At the same time, the temperature of exothermic peak corresponding to the coke combustion increases for the boron modified catalysts which may be caused by the increased graphitization degree of coke as a result of changes in the vanadium carbides on modified catalysts [57].

3.7. Surface acidity of catalysts
The acidity of catalysts and γ-Al2O3 support was evaluated by Py-FTIR. The IR spectra are shown in Fig. 8 and the quantification results are listed in Table 5. As can be seen, the γ-Al2O3 support has sole Lewis acid sites (LAS), which were mainly derived from the dehydration of –OH groups on the surface of γ-Al2O3 [58]. After loading vanadium, Brønsted acid sites appear on the catalyst, because the vanadium species with different valences or coordination numbers were introduced to γ-Al2O3. Additional isomorphous substitution occurs producing a large number of V–OH–Al groups, which are the Brønsted acid sites (BAS) on the catalyst surface [59]. With the increase of B/Al ratio, the amount of both BAS and LAS significantly decreased. In order to further understand the strength change of the catalyst surface acidity, the NH3-TPD characterization was conducted (Fig. S3). The results are plotted in Fig. S4 and listed in Table S1. As can be seen, with the increase of boron amount, the quantity of total acid sites decreases and the acid strength also exhibits a decreasing trend consistent with the Py-FTIR results. The reduced surface acidity weakened the adsorption of propane on the modified catalyst surface, therefore resulting in the decrease in the initial propane conversion. At the same time, the adsorption of propylene is weakened as well, which could favor the desorption of propylene from the catalyst surface. This further inhibits the subsequent polymerization and cracking reactions resulting in increased propylene selectivity and prolonged lifetime of the boron modified catalysts.

3.8. 11B MAS NMR analysis of catalysts
The boron coordination environment on the catalyst was characterized by 11B MAS NMR, and the results are shown in Fig. 9. There are two NMR signals at ca. 20 and 0 ppm, assigned to boron atoms with three coordination (BO3) and boron with four coordination (BO4), respectively [60], [61]. Among them, trigonal boron may exist as B–O–Al or B–O–V bridge bond, and tetrahedral boron may be present as boria-alumina mixed oxide, possibly existing on the catalysts surface [62], [63], [64], [65]. At the same time, the peak intensity of trigonal boron (BO3) is stronger than that of tetrahedral boron in both catalysts, indicating that boron mainly form B–O–Al or B–O–V bonds in the boron modified catalysts. On the other hand, it has been verified from the Py-FTIR characterization that the amount of both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface is greatly reduced after the boron modification. Since a part of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites originate from boron in the BO4 and BO3 coordination, respectively [61], [66], when the ratio of B/Al increased from 0.05 to 0.15, the peak strengths of both BO4 and BO3 in 11B MAS NMR spectra decreased which is consistent with the corresponding Py-FTIR results.

3.9. Redox properties of catalysts
H2-TPR was used to characterize the reduction properties of VOX species on the catalyst in order to understand the type and relative content changes of VOX species. Fig. 10 shows the H2-TPR profiles of various catalysts before and after boron modification. All catalysts exhibit a broad reduction peak in the temperature range of 400–650 °C, which is attributed to the reduction of V5+ to V4+ species [29], [45]. After boron modification, the peak area of H2 consumption gradually decreases (Fig. S5 and Table S2). This is accompanied by a gradual shifting of the temperature of H2 consumption towards high value with the increase of B/Al ratio of the catalysts (Table S3). This is due to the fact the boron atom is smaller than the vanadium atom, which makes the newly formed B–O–V bond more stable than the original V–O–V bond and more difficult to be reduced. At the same time, the reduction peak of unmodified catalyst is very sharp and intense (see H2-TPR spectrum) implying that the type of VOX species are not variable as other samples. Based on the above results, we can suggest that without boron modification, the catalyst possessed mainly polymerized VOX and less isolated VOX species compared with modified samples. The peak of H2-TPR became broader in all boron modified catalysts, indicating variable distribution of VOX species and possibly the formation of more isolated VOX species. The H2 consumption of catalysts exhibits a decreasing trend with the increase of B/Al ratio of the modified catalysts, evidencing that the boron could reduce vanadium valence state and increase the concentration of V4+ species (Table 3). These findings are in a good accordance with the XPS results.

3.10. DFT calculations
According to the experimental results, when the atomic B/Al ratios increased from 0.05 to 0.2, the surface B/V ratio measured by XPS increased from 2.34 to 3.16. Therefore, three catalyst models with B/V ratios of 0, 2 and 4 were constructed to represent the actual surface composition. The boron atom evenly substituted the –OH groups of the Al2O3 (100) facet. The adsorption geometry of propane on the modified catalyst is shown in Fig. 11.

By calculating the adsorption energy (Eads/eV), adsorption distance (d/Å) between propane and propylene and B-O-V active centers on the catalyst surface, and charge transfer (charge/e) from propane and propylene to the catalyst surface, the adsorption strength of propane and propylene on the catalyst surface was revealed. As is shown in Table 6, compared to the unmodified VOX/Al2O3 catalyst, after boron modification, the adsorption energy of propane decreases and the adsorption distance increases, demonstrating that the doping of boron weakened the interaction between propane and the vanadium centers. With increasing the B/Al ratio, the adsorption strength of propane was reduced, which hampered the activation of propane and decreased the propane conversion. These results are consistent with the catalytic data shown in Fig. 1. At the same time, as the ratio of B/Al increases, the adsorption energy of propylene on the catalyst surface gradually decreases from − 0.48 eV to − 0.189 eV, and the adsorption distance increases from 2.769 Å to 4.286 Å, verifying that the adsorption strength of propylene on the catalyst surface also decreased.

VOX/Al2O3-0.05 2 -0.206 4.336 -0.002 -0.198 4.209 0.089
VOX/Al2O3-0.20 4 -0.197 4.580 -0.007 -0.190 4.986 0.025
Mulliken charge population analysis showed that after propane adsorption on unmodified catalyst surface, 0.275e electrons were transferred from propane to catalyst, and the charge transfer amount decreased with the increase of B/Al ratio, indicating that the interaction between propane and catalyst was weakened. The same trend was also observed for propylene, suggesting that the desorption of propylene was favored with the increase of the boron amount, which may inhibit the further cracking and polymerization of propylene.
The above results suggest that the doping of boron atoms in the vanadium-based catalyst can effectively improve the desorption of propylene and inhibit further reactions of propylene to produce carbon deposits. This provides theoretical explanations for the fact that the carbon deposition of the catalysts was reduced and the propylene selectivity was improved after boron modification.
4. Conclusions
VOX/Al2O3 catalyst was modified by boric acid, resulting in significant enhancement of catalysts stability and improvement in the propylene selectivity. The unmodified VOX/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits the highest initial propane conversion, 82% at the maximum, but dramatically dropping to about 31% after 7 h of reaction. After boron modification, all catalysts exhibit improved stability and enhanced propylene selectivity. Between all studied catalysts, the VOX/Al2O3-0.20 sample exhibits the highest stability, and the propane conversion decreased from 60% to 40% after 7 h of reaction. While sample VOX/Al2O3-0.05 achieved the highest STY of propylene, 1.44 mmol·g−1·h−1, higher than that of the unmodified VOX/Al2O3 catalyst. Detailed characterization indicated that the polymerization degree of VOX species is reduced by the addition of boron, and the proportion of isolated VOX species increases, which reduces the initial activity but increases the stability of catalysts. The amounts of both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites decrease after boron modification due to the formation of B-O-Al and B-O-V bonds, that significantly retarded the formation of coke. The adsorption states and energies of propane and propylene were revealed by the DFT calculations, confirming that the doping of boron promotes the desorption of propylene, which prevents propylene from further cracking and coking reactions.
