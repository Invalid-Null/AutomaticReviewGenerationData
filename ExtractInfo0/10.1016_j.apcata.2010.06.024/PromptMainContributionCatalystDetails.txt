Selection of mixed conducting oxides for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with pulse experiments
Abstract
In this study, propane pulse experiments at 550 °C are used as a method to select suitable oxides for further operation of catalytic dense membrane reactor (CDMR) for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF), La2NiO4+δ (LN) and PrBaCo2O5+δ (PBC) powders were used as model catalysts to explore the catalytic properties of membrane surfaces in terms of activity and selectivity. Furthermore, as propane pulses induce removal of oxygen from the sample, which is therefore depleted in oxygen by reducing the oxide, crucial information on the effect of the oxygen content in the samples (i.e. the oxidation degree) on reactivity and selectivity is obtained. It will be shown that LN is the most promising material for membrane application, provided that it is operated in the optimal window of reduction degree, to ensure high selectivity towards C3H6. Contrary, PBC and BSCF are not suitable for CDMR. In fact, PBC showed low selectivity to C3H6 due to significant formation of CO2, independent of the oxidation degree of the material and BSCF appears to adsorb CO2 by forming carbonates, which might be detrimental for long term operation. However, pulse experiments revealed the remarkable stability of BSCF catalyst's activity towards CO2 adsorption. Despite the presence of carbonate, the material preserved the ability to act as an oxygen source for propane and can be completely regenerated via oxidation. Additionally, the onset temperature in TPR appears to correlate well with the reactivity of lattice oxygen ions with propane, for the three materials studied.

1. Introduction
The demand for propylene is continuously growing and it is expected to rise to 80 million tonnes in 2010 worldwide [1], [2], [3]. Nowadays the main industrial routes for propylene production are endothermic reactions such as steam cracking [4], fluid catalytic cracking [5] and catalytic dehydrogenation which is the most promising for alkenes production. The main drawbacks are that catalytic dehydrogenation is equilibrium limited and it suffers from catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition [6]. This problem can be avoided by oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane where gaseous oxygen containing compounds (i.e. O2, N2O and CO2) are employed as oxidant, turning the process to exothermic and reducing the coke deposition [7]. On the other hand, further oxidation of propylene to CO2 can also occur because of consecutive oxidation of propylene, which is more reactive than propane [8], [9]. One way to overcome this issue is to employ metal oxide lattice oxygen as reactant, limiting the extent of deep oxidation by tuning the reactivity of these lattice oxygen ions. In this study, mixed metal oxides suitable for catalytic dense membrane reactor (CDMR), as proposed by several researchers [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], will be investigated as oxidant for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The dense membrane is exposed on one side to propane (reaction side) and, on the other side, to molecular oxygen (regeneration side), separating the two gases. As the membrane at the reaction side will get depleted in oxygen due to reaction with the alkane, membrane regeneration is required. This occurs via permeation of O2− ions through the mixed conducting dense membrane, which are generated at the regeneration side interface. By matching the oxygen diffusion rate with the rate of conversion, oxygen recombination at the alkane side can be prevented and alkane oxidation can, in principle, proceed via oxygen lattice ions exclusively.
In this study, propane pulse experiments [15], [16], [17] are used as method to select different oxides for further operation of CDMR, based on propane conversion and product distribution. In fact, pulsing with propane in absence of oxygen is mimicking the interaction between membrane lattice oxygen and propane at the reaction side of the membrane. The pulse experiment can therefore be regarded as a model experiment for selection of suitable membrane materials. Furthermore, as propane pulses induce variation of the oxidation degree by slowly reducing the oxide, pulse experiments can also provide crucial information on the effect of variation of the oxygen content (i.e. the oxidation degree) in the samples on reactivity and selectivity.
Three mixed metal oxides have been selected to shown the applicability of pulse experiment: Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF), La2NiO4+δ (LN) and PrBaCo2O5+δ (PBC). These materials have been selected because of clear differences in ion permeability [18], [19] and lattice oxygen reactivity [20], [21], despite their similar perovskite-like structures as discussed below. The influence of those parameters on the catalytic reactivity and selectivity of the materials will be investigated in this study.
BSCF possesses pure perovskite structure, indicated as ABO3, consisting of a cubic arrangement of corner-sharing BO6 octahedra, where B is a transition metal cation. The A-site ions, located in interstitial position between the BO6 octahedra, are usually occupied by an alkali, alkali earth or rare earth ion [22], as shown in Fig. 1a. Due to the redox nature of B-site ions (Co or Fe), the catalyst can easily change composition, resulting in structural defects as vacancies at oxygen-ion lattice positions, like in many redox compounds [23], [24], [25]. The oxygen under-stoichiometry due to the formation of vacancies is represented by δ in the nominal composition of the material.

When varying the ratio metal-A:metal-B to 2:1, the perovskite structure is modified towards the K2NiF4-type structure (Fig. 1b), generally indicated as A2BO4. This is the case for LN (La2NiO4) catalyst which presents a double layer arrangement: Ni, octahedrally coordinated, is present in the perovskite layer and La, tetragonally coordinated, is present in a layer with a rock-salt structure [26]. Due to the specific crystallographic arrangement of this oxide and the redox properties of Ni, the catalyst possesses two types of structural defects: vacancies and interstitial oxygen, which is over-stoichiometric oxygen, located in between the perovskite layer and rock-salt layer (not shown in Fig. 1b) [27]. In this case the δ value in the nominal composition of the material represents the balance of both under- and over-stoichiometric oxygen, due to vacancies and interstitial oxygen, respectively. Interstitial oxygen usually dominates as 0 < δ < 0.2. The two types of oxygen present in LN possess different reactivity due to the different crystallographic position [28]. A third family of perovskite-related structure is the pseudo-brookite structure which is generally indicated as AA′B2O5 where A is a tri- or tetra-valent lanthanide ion and A′ is a divalent alkali-earth metal. This is the case of PBC (Fig. 1c) and the related layered structure is generated by stacking sequence …|A′O|BO2|AOx|BO2|…, similar to the structure of cuprate superconductor [29]. In this case, due to redox nature of both A′ (Pr)- and B (Co)-site ions, the catalyst possesses vacancies [30], [31]. In this case, the δ value can vary from 0 to 1 according to the amount of vacancies in PBC, which directly influences the Co oxidation states (δ = 0 when Co oxidation states are 50% Co2+ and 50% Co3+; δ = 1 when Co oxidation states are 50% Co3+ and 50% Co4+) [30].
It was shown that the oxygen content in redox materials can change by varying the experimental conditions (oxygen partial pressure and temperature, i.e. [32]), affecting the oxygen reactivity [28]. The oxidation degree of the materials is decreased by pulsing propane, inducing removal of oxygen from the sample which is therefore depleted in oxygen. It was shown that in the case of LN, the active sites for activating propane changed from over-stoichiometric oxygen, responsible for formation of CO2, CH4, C2H4, C3H6 and H2O, to lattice oxygen and Ni metal, responsible for formation of CO, CH4 and carbonaceous species. In this paper, the variation of oxidation degree of the materials and the resulting change in the product distributions are investigated. Additionally, oxygen reactivity in H2-TPR and permeabilities of the three samples were also considered as parameters for understanding the catalyst performances in pulse experiments.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
PrBaCo2O5+δ (PBC), Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF) and La2NiO4+δ (LN) catalysts were prepared via sol–gel method using EDTA as chelating agent [33]. A stoichiometric amount of appropriate metal-hydrated nitrates (Merck), EDTA and NH4OH solutions were added and the obtained solutions were heated for 2 h under stirring. After drying at 230 °C, foam-type materials were formed and pyrolysis took place after spontaneous ignition. The resulting solid mixed metal oxides were milled and calcined in air, slowly increasing temperature (1 °C/min) up to 900–1050 °C (see Table 1) to obtain single phase materials. The resulting materials were ball milled in acetone for 5 h and dried at 80 °C. The powdered materials were sieved and particles size of 0.1–0.3 mm were used for all experiments. The materials thus prepared will be called PBC-LT, BSCF-LT and LN-LT, indicating the relative low calcination temperatures employed.

To fabricate membranes, after the ball milling procedure, the powders were isostatically pressed at 4000 bar and sintered at appropriate temperatures (1200, 1100 and 1400 °C for PBC, BSCF and LN, respectively) in air for 10 h, obtaining bulk density >95%. The materials thus prepared will be called PBC-HT, BSCF-HT and LN-HT, indicating the relative high sintering temperatures used to fabricate dense membrane materials.
2.2. Characterization
Nitrogen adsorption measurements were carried out at −196 °C with a Micromeritics Tristar system. Prior the adsorption measurements the samples were degassed at 300 °C and 10−3 Pa for 24 h. The specific surface areas were calculated according to the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) method.
The crystal structure of the materials was determined in air with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Philips PW2050 (X’Pert-APD) diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). Data were collected varying 2θ between 20° and 75° with a step size of 0.005° and a step time of 1 s.
Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was carried out with a home-built set-up, equipped with a TCD detector. First, 40 mg of sample mixed with 40 mg quartz particles were placed in a 4 mm inner diameter reactor, heated up to 500 °C (10 °C/min), kept at 500 °C for 1 h in a 20 ml/min flow of 5% O2 in He and then the sample was cooled down to room temperature in the same atmosphere. At room temperature the flow was changed, after flushing with inert, to 5% H2 in Ar and the TPR was carried out at 5 °C/min up to 750 °C. The TCD was calibrated via reduction of NiO.
Carbon di-oxide temperature programmed desorption (TPD) from spent BSCF catalyst was measured using a fixed-bed reactor (described in Section 2.3) measuring the composition of the outgoing gas mixture on-line and continuously with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer AG Balzers, OmniStar) equipped with Channeltron and Faraday detectors (2–200 amu). The CO2 content was measured by monitoring m/z = 44. After completion of the propane pulse experiment and subsequent regeneration with O2 pulses at 550 °C, the spent catalyst was cooled down to room temperature in 10% O2 in He flow. Subsequently, the catalyst was flushed for 1 h in 3 ml/min flow of He at room temperature where after the TPD was performed by heating the sample up to 970 °C at heating rate of 20 °C/min. The MS was calibrated for CO2 by performing decomposition of a known amount of CaCO3.
The oxygen permeability experiments were performed in a vertical high-temperature gas permeation system. A ceramic glass ring was used as binding agent to seal 1 mm thick membrane disk on a dense quartz tube. Permeation studies were performed between 525 and 650 °C. On the oxygen side of the membrane, constant flow of 100 ml/min of technical air was employed while on the sweep side 100 ml/min of high purity He (O2 < 2 ppm) was used. A CP-4900 micro gas chromatograph equipped with Poraplot Q and 5Asil columns was connected to the outlet of sweep side. The oxygen permeability was calculated based on (i) the amount of molecular oxygen present on the sweep side, (ii) the sweep gas flow rate and (iii) the membrane thickness. Nitrogen was never detected in the sweep gas, demonstrating that leakage of N2 or O2 through pores or cracks never occurred.
2.3. Pulse experiment
Pulse experiments were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor (quartz tube, length 400 mm, internal diameter 2 mm) at 550 °C. The catalyst particles (∼35 mg) were sieved (particle size 0.1–0.3 mm) and packed between two quartz-wool plugs (length approximately 10 mm each). The remaining volume of the reactor was filled up with quartz particles, in order to reduce the void space and minimize gas phase reactions. Before each titration test, the catalysts were pre-treated in 10% of O2 in He flow (20 ml/min, 30 min.) at 720 °C in order to remove any trace of water or inorganic compounds physisorbed on the surface and in order to keep the catalyst oxygen level as high as possible. The samples were cooled down to reaction temperature under the same atmosphere, and afterwards the gas flow was changed to He (3 ml/min). After flowing pure He for 15 min, pulses of 300 μl at atmospheric pressure containing 10% C3H8 in He were introduced. After pulsing with propane is completed, the catalyst is re-oxidize by pulsing with 10% O2 in He. In all experiments, the regeneration process was confirmed by subsequent propane pulses (not shown here), resulting in identical product distributions as compared to experiments with fresh material.
Product distributions were monitored by sampling on-line to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer AG Balzers, OmniStar) equipped with Channeltron and Faraday detectors (2–200 amu). Prior to each experiment, the fragmentation patterns of fresh propane and fresh oxygen were recorded allowing quantitative determinations of propane and oxygen with an experimental error of about 5%. Water, propane and oxygen were identified by monitoring m/z = 18, 29 and 32, respectively, since no other products contributed significantly to these m/z signals. The concentrations of methane, ethane, ethylene, propylene, carbon mono- and di-oxide were calculated semi-quantitatively with a matrix calculation in order to account for cross-contamination effects; quantitative calibration for these compounds was not available.
Apparent selectivities were calculated based on the integrated area of peaks of the corresponding m/z signals of each compound divided by total integrated areas of the peaks of all carbon-containing products (e.g. for methane:
). The conversion of propane was below the detection limit when pulsing propane to the reactor filled with quartz particles exclusively and therefore we exclude gas phase contribution during the pulse tests. The amount of oxygen removed from the fresh catalyst during propane pulsing was quantified with help of back-titration with O2.
3. Results
3.1. Characterization
The investigated materials showed similar, relatively small BET surface areas as reported in Table 1. It is important to stress that the surface areas of LT-samples exposed during the pulse experiments are similarly low and thus the diffusion distance between surface and bulk of the oxides is similar. Slightly higher surface area (9.3 m2/g) was reported by Liu et al. [34], probably due to the lower calcination temperature used (800 °C).
The XRD patterns of LT-samples (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4) demonstrated good cristallinity of the catalysts and all peaks could be assigned to either single perovskite (BSCF) or perovskite-like structure (PBC and LN) [35], [36], [37], [38]. Calcination at high temperature resulted in very similar XRD patterns for LN and BSCF, the only difference being that high temperature calcination results in narrower, better resolved and more intense peaks due to crystal growth (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). High temperature calcination of PBC (Fig. 2b) resulted in the presence of additional peaks (2θ = 32.8, 47.8, 53.6, 58.8 and 68.8, indicated with arrows in Fig. 2b) as compared to PBC-LT, indicating the formation of an orthorhombic phase [39]. It should be noted that the asymmetry of the peaks in the diffractogram of PBC-LT indicates that the same phase is also present in PBC-LT, be it at much lower concentration.

Oxygen permeation increased with temperature for all three samples, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The oxygen permeation values for BSCF in the range 0.93 < 1000/T < 1.027 were reported in literature by Wang et al. [18] and a linear extrapolation to lower temperatures will be used for comparison with LN and PBC. The permeability of the three materials differs in a few orders of magnitude in the order BSCF > PBC > LN.

TPR profiles of the three samples are shown in Fig. 6. Two distinctive reduction steps are visible at ∼300 and 650 °C for LN, typical for K2NiF4-type of materials [40]. The two peaks were assigned to reduction of Ni3+ to Ni2+ and Ni2+ to Ni metal, respectively [41], as discussed in our previous paper [28]. In case of PBC, three reduction steps were observed at 220, 350 and 450 °C which have not been assigned in literature. Note that the small peak at 220 °C is only visible in the enlarged insert in Fig. 6. We suggest that these reduction steps are related to stepwise reductions of Co4+ to Co metal, occurring in multiple steps (CoO2 → CoO(OH) → Co3O4 → CoO → Co metal), as reported for CoO2 [42], [43] As the first peak at 220 °C is much smaller than the subsequent peaks, it is clear that the metal ion responsible for this reduction peak (e.g. Co4+) is present at low concentration. Reduction of BSCF showed three reduction steps at 350, 420 and 480 °C. In literature, these were related to reduction of Co4+ and Fe4+, which are stable oxidation states in perovskite materials, to lower oxidation states [20], [44], [45], [46]. Comparing the TPR profiles of BSCF and bulk CoFe2O4 [47] we suggest that the peak at 350 °C is related to the reduction of Fe4+ to Fe3+ and probably further to lower oxidation state, while the two peaks at higher temperature are related to stepwise reduction of Co4+ to Co0. The amount of oxygen removed from BSCF during TPR is 6.8 mmol/g, which agrees surprisingly well with the amount of oxygen removed, assuming reduction of Fe2O3 and Co2O3 completely to Co and Fe metal. However, it is known that BSCF contains Fe4+ and Co4+, and therefore the TPR experiment apparently results in a mixture of Co and Fe in both metallic and 2+ states.

Considering the onset temperatures of the first reduction steps for the three catalyst, which is highlighted in the, insert in Fig. 6, initial removal of oxygen is more facile in the order PBC > LN > BSCF.
3.2. Pulse experiments
The propane conversion over PBC, LN and BSCF during pulse experiments at 550 °C (Fig. 7) showed higher activity for PBC catalyst (Fig. 7a) compared to the other materials, during the first six pulses. BSCF (Fig. 7c) showed a slightly higher activity than LN (Fig. 7b), except for the first pulse. The conversion for all three materials decreased with the number of pulses to around 5% and only in case of LN a sudden increase in the conversion up to 50%, was observed after the fourteenth pulse. Please note that the pulse experiment on LN at 550 °C was presented in our previous paper [28] and is reported here in order to allow comparison with the results on BSCF and PBC.

The product distribution during pulsing over freshly oxidized PBC (Fig. 8) shows CO2 and H2O as the main products, while production of propylene was low throughout the experiment. CO2 formation decreased with the number of pulses while ethylene, propylene and methane formation increased (Fig. 8).

After the titration test, the catalyst was regenerated by pulsing oxygen (Fig. 8, right hand side) and formation of CO2 was observed, testifying that carbon was deposited on the catalyst surface. The O2 level reached a plateau value after eight pulses, equal to blank O2 pulses, indicating complete regeneration of the samples.
It is remarkable that CO2 was not detected during the first two oxygen pulses, and we suggest that the catalyst is partly re-oxidized first, before carbon combustion started. The total amount of atomic oxygen consumed during regeneration, employed to both re-oxidize the catalyst and to combust coke, was 0.350 mmol/g.
It was earlier reported for LN at 550 °C (Fig. 9) [28], [48] that the active sites for activating propane changed from over-stoichiometric oxygen, responsible for formation of CO2, CH4, C2H4, C3H6 and H2O, to lattice oxygen and Ni metal, responsible for formation of CO, CH4 and carbonaceous species [49]. It was also reported that carbon deposition occurs exclusively after the 11th propane pulse [48].

The product distribution during pulse experiment over freshly oxidized BSCF at 550 °C (Fig. 10) showed H2O as main product while CO2 was formed as the minor compound. Significant formation of ethylene and propylene was also observed. Continuing pulsing, the CO2 formation decreased below the MS detection limit, while olefins were constantly produced. Also the formation of CH4 was constant for all pulses throughout the experiment.

Interestingly, no CO2 was detected during the regeneration after propane pulses, testifying that no carbon was deposited on the catalyst surface. The total amount of atomic oxygen consumed to regenerate the catalyst was 0.160 mmol/g.
After the regeneration with oxygen pulses, the BSCF catalyst was cooled down to room temperature in oxygen and TPD analysis was performed in He. Desorption of CO2 was detected starting at around 600 °C and reaching a maximum at 860 °C, as shown in Fig. 11. The amount of CO2 desorbed during the TPD was 5.0 × 10−5 mol. It is suggested that this peak is mainly due to decomposition of Ba and Sr carbonates, based on similar observation in literature [45], [50], [51], [52], [53]. This also agrees with the fact that decomposition of BaxSr1−xCO3 is reported to occur between 700 and 900 °C [54]. However, we cannot exclude that CO2 desorption contributes to the signal in Fig. 11 at lower temperatures [53].

4. Discussion
The materials showed different reactivity during the first propane pulse, resulting in 85, 40 and 20% conversion of propane for PBC, LN and BSCF, respectively. This result is in line with the onset temperatures of the three materials in TPR, showing a first reduction step at 220, 300 and 350 °C for PBC, LN and BSCF, respectively (Fig. 6). The fact that the amount of oxygen removed during the pulse experiment at 550 °C is a small fraction of the amount of oxygen that can be removed during TPR (less than 10% in all cases) confirms that the onset reduction temperatures is the preferred indicator of oxygen reactivity during the pulse experiment, rather than the temperature of the maximum of the TPR peak. Additionally, we suggest that the decreasing propane conversion with the pulse number for all three catalysts is due to decreasing reactivity of remaining oxygen species, due to the removal of oxygen, similar to what was already reported for LN [28].
Product distributions at different catalyst reduction degree are also relevant for the applicability of materials as catalytic dense membranes. CO2 was the main carbon-containing product over PBC and LN initially, while pulsing propane over BSCF resulted in formation of mainly C2H4 (Fig 12). Continuing pulsing, thus decreasing the catalyst oxidation degree, PBC showed CO2 as the main product as well as significant carbon deposition throughout the experiment (Fig. 8b), resulting in low selectivity to propylene. Therefore, PBC is considered not suitable for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at 550 °C due to the too high reactivity of oxygen ions, resulting in mainly deep oxidation. Better selectivity might be achievable by decreasing the reaction temperature. On the other hand, also the permeability decreases with temperature (Fig. 5) [29], lowering the permeation rates which would be unfavorable for CDMR application. More investigation would be needed to clarify this.

Fig. 12. Apparent selectivities of C3H6, C2H4, CH4, CO2 and CO during pulse experiments at 550 °C over PBC (a), LN (b) and BSCF (c).
In the case of LN, the CO2 formation rapidly decreased and a window of oxidation degrees with promising selectivity to propylene of 60% was observed, between pulse numbers 7 and 13 (Fig. 12). This is the window in which the surface of LN exposed to propane should be operated as CDMR, in order to achieve high selectivity to propylene. In fact, further reduction of LN would cause the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni metal, changing the product distribution drastically to CO, CH4 and carbon, as discussed in detail previously [48], [49], [55].
On the contrary, BSCF showed stable apparent selectivities to propylene and ethylene, evidencing constant rates for propane dehydrogenation and cracking (Fig 12c). Interestingly, CO2 was detected in very low extent during the first six pulses and could not be detected at all in next pulses, whereas coke deposition was not observed. However, a significant release of CO2 (5.0 × 10−5 mol) was detected in the temperature range between 600 and 900 °C when performing a TPD experiment on spent BSCF catalyst (Fig. 11), suggesting that most of the formed CO2 was adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst during the pulse experiment. Therefore, the amount of CO2 formed based on MS analysis is strongly underestimated, misleading the apparent selectivities reported in Fig. 12c. Moreover, the CO2 detected during TPD contains an order of magnitude more carbon than the amount of carbon contained in the propane fed during pulsing, suggesting that the material adsorbed CO2 during storage in air. However, regeneration of BSCF by pulsing with O2 at 550 °C was remarkably successful, as the reactivity is completely recovered to the level of fresh catalyst (Fig. 7, Fig. 10). Apparently, the variation in the concentration of carbonate and/or adsorbed CO2 on the catalyst is not influencing the reactivity of BSCF with propane. Decreasing reactivity during propane pulsing is therefore due to the removal of oxygen from the oxide, and not due to carbonate formation. Apparently, formation of carbonate does not affect accessibility or reactivity of oxygen ions in BSCF, which is remarkable because formation of carbonate layers, containing SrCO3, BaCO3 and SrxBa1−xCO3 on BSCF is reported in literature [45], [50], [51], [52], [53]. Our result shows that catalyst deactivation via formation of a carbonate layer is not taking place under our conditions and that BSCF retains its redox properties. It was reported that oxygen permeation through Ba- and Sr-based perovskite membrane deteriorated by 30-50% over a time period of about 100 h, which was assigned to carbonate formation [50], [51], [52]. Therefore, we suggest that BSCF is probably not a good choice for CDMR as the long term formation of carbonate will probably affect the activity as well as the integrity of the material. Unfortunately, this conclusion cannot be drawn based on pulse experiment alone because the uncertainty in the amount of CO2 formed.
The apparent selectivities of PBC and LN are compared at different conversion levels, as illustrated in Fig. 13. At 5% conversion level, PBC showed CO2 as the main product while LN gives C3H6 and CH4 as major compounds, without significant formation of CO2.

Increasing the level of conversion induces increasing apparent selectivity to CO2 for both LN and PBC, whereas CO2 formation on LN is always lower as compared to PBC. Clearly, the higher selectivity observed with LN is not due to the lower conversion level as compared to BSCF, which thus reduce the consecutive conversion of propylene to COx. Therefore, we can conclude that the superior performance of LN over BSCF is due to differences in the reactivity of lattice oxygen in these oxides.
Finally, it should be mentioned that the pulse experiments were performed over powdered materials (LT-samples in Table 1), which were calcined at lower temperature than dense membrane (HT-samples in Table 1). The XRD of both LT- and HT-samples confirmed that the structures of LT- and HT-samples are identical. Therefore, it is reasonable to extend the conclusions based on experiments performed with material calcined at low temperature (between 900 and 1050 °C) to selection of membrane materials, necessarily synthesized via calcination at higher temperature (between 1100 and 1400 °C).
5. Conclusions
It was shown that pulse experiments can be used as method to select materials for operation of catalytic dense membrane reactors for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, providing that CO2 formed is not adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst. Pulse experiments reveal the intrinsic activity and selectivity of lattice oxygen ions in the mixed oxides. LN is the most promising material for membrane application, provided that it is operated in the right window of reduction degree, to ensure high selectivity towards C3H6. According to the pulse experiments PBC is not suitable, showing low selectivity to C3H6 due to significant formation of CO2, independent of the oxidation degree of the material. BSCF appears to adsorb CO2 by forming carbonates. Therefore, pulse experiments fail to give reliable data on selectivity of BSCF in propane pulse experiments. However, pulse experiments revealed the remarkable stability of BSCF catalyst's activity towards CO2 adsorption. Despite the presence of carbonate, the material preserved the ability to act as an oxygen source for propane and can be completely regenerated via oxidation. Additionally, the reactivity with propane of lattice oxygen ions in the three materials clearly correlates with the onset temperature in TPR.
