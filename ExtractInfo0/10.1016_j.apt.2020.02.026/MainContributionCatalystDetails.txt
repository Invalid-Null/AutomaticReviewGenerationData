 Based on the multiple document extractions provided, it appears the original research paper does not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) catalysts. The documents consistently indicate the paper focuses on fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst hydrodynamics, not PDH or ODH specifically.
