The given document discusses oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, specifically C2-C5 alkanes, on vanadium oxide-based catalysts. It does not pertain to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document focuses on structure-activity relationships and reaction mechanisms for lower alkane ODH in general, rather than improvements to PDH or ODH of propane to propylene.
