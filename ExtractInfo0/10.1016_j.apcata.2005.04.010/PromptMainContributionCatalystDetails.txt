An isotopic study of the transhydrogenation of propyne with propane over a potassium-doped chromia/alumina catalyst
Abstract
The transhydrogenation of propyne and propane to propene was studied over a potassium-doped chromia/alumina catalyst over the temperature range 773–873 K. In the absence of propane, propyne further reduced the catalyst and produced carbon deposits and methane. Only trace quantities of propene were observed. As expected propane in the absence of propyne underwent dehydrogenation to from propene close to thermodynamic limitations. The transhydrogenation reaction was shown to require full dehydrogenation of propane to propene by use of isotopic labels. Transhydrogenation was observed at 823 and 873 K. By 873 K, the conversion to propene was such that 80% of the C-3 stream was propene. However, the yield of propene was low due to secondary reaction leading to methane and carbon.
1. Introduction
The dehydrogenation of light alkanes has been known as a catalytic process for a significant number of years [1]. The catalytic processes fall into two categories, those based on platinum as the active phase [2] and those based on chromia as the active phase [3]. However, in both cases the catalytic process is complex with a series of competing reactions occurring simultaneously including significant carbon laydown resulting catalyst deactivation. Both catalyst systems require frequent regeneration to maintain activity and the heat liberated from the regeneration is used to balance the endothermic nature of the principal reaction. None of the current industrial processes are ideal and ways of improving the process are always being sought [3], [4], [5]. This can be done through catalytic chemistry, reaction engineering, or a combination of both. In this paper we investigate using a transhydrogenation reaction between an alkyne and an alkane to generate two alkenes.
Transhydrogenation is a little studied reaction where a hydrogen donor and a hydrogen acceptor are passed over a catalyst and the donor is dehydrogenated to supply the hydrogen to hydrogenate the acceptor [6], [7]. These early examples of transhydrogenation used hydrogen donors such as propane, butane, or 2-methyl propane and a mono-alkene such as ethane as the acceptor. Hence there was no overall increase in alkene yield, although a more valuable alkene had been produced. Later patents [8], [9] revealed the benefit that two low value molecules can be converted into two higher value added molecules potentially under milder conditions if the hydrogen donor is an alkane while the hydrogen acceptor is an alkyne or alkadiene.
In this study we have examined the transhydrogenation of propane and propyne. Thermodynamically this reaction is favoured at most temperatures,
C3H8 + C3H4 → 2C3H6, ΔG = −45.5 kJ mol−1 at 298 K
however if, as may be expected, it is a sequential process with a dehydrogenation
C3H8 → C3H6 + H2
followed by a hydrogenation
C3H4 + H2 → C3H6
it must be operated at a temperature where dehydrogenation is sufficiently fast to generate a sensible overall rate. The aim of this research was to investigate the transhydrogenation reaction using isotopic labelling to elucidate the mechanism.
2. Experimental
The catalyst used in this study was a Cr2O3–K2O/alumina, prepared by impregnation. A solution of potassium hydroxide and ammonium dichromate was added to the support (Engelhard Al-3992E, S.A. 200 m2 g−1) and the resulting suspension evaporated to dryness. The solid was then calcined in air at 823 K for 3 h. Analysis of the catalyst gave values of 7.6% w/w Cr and 0.7% K. This catalyst was chosen as it was known from previous studies [10], [11], that it was effective for dehydrogenation and that the potassium hydroxide reduced by-product formation including carbon laydown.
Pulsed reaction studies were performed in a dynamic mode using a pulse-flow microreactor system with on-line GCMS. Using this system the catalysts (typically 0.2 g) could be reduced in situ in flowing 5% hydrogen in nitrogen (50 cm3 min−1) by heating to 873 K at 10 K min−1 and then holding at this temperature for 0.25 h. After reduction had ceased the catalyst was maintained, at the desired temperature, in flowing helium (70 cm3 min−1). The reaction gases were admitted by injecting pulses of known size (typically 6 μmol) into the helium carrier-gas stream and hence to the catalyst. After passage through the catalyst bed the total contents of the pulse were analysed by gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-14A, TCD detector) using a 2.2 m Porapak QS column coupled to a mass spectrometer (Spectramass Selector). The extent of carbon deposition was measured by difference for each pulse. After the series of reaction pulses the catalyst was subjected to aliquots of oxygen (∼6 μmol) at the reaction temperature to remove surface carbon and re-oxidise the catalyst.
3. Results
The alumina was subjected to propyne and propane at 873 K to determine whether the support was active. Trace activity was detected but this was around one percent of the activity seen over the catalyst. Given that it was such a low level of activity the contribution to the catalytic results was ignored.
3.1. Propyne
Pulses of propyne were passed over the reduced catalyst at 773, 823 and 873 K. The results is shown in Table 1. The total amount of carbon deposited at each temperature was 291 μmol g−1 at 773 K, 178 μmol g−1 at 823 K and 101 μmol g−1 at 873 K. This decreasing trend in carbon deposition is mirrored by an increasing yield of methane.

3.2. d8-Propane
In the experiments where propane and propyne are co-fed, the propane used was d8-propane to allow isotopic tracing of the hydrogen. Therefore, in Table 3 the dehydrogenation of d8-propane is reported at 773, 823 and 873 K. Clearly at 773 K no dehydrogenation was occurring and the extent of dehydrogenation at the higher temperatures was significantly lower than that found with h8-propane [10]. After the propane pulses the catalysts were subjected to oxygen pulses and the extent of the carbon removal measured. At 773 K 6.9% of the deposited carbon was removed, at 823 K the amount was 1.9%, while at 873 K 4.2% of the carbon deposited was removed.

4. Discussion
4.1. Propyne
From Table 1, three aspects about the interaction between propyne and the catalyst are clear, firstly there is no unreacted propyne, secondly the propyne is further reducing the catalyst, and thirdly there is significant carbon deposition. The absence of unreacted propyne is not surprising, propyne is highly reactive and, in the absence of hydrogen, cracking/dehydrogenation will be favoured. The further reduction of the catalyst by propyne was unexpected and, as will be shown below, was not observed to the same extent with propane or during transhydrogenation. The catalyst is reduced in hydrogen and we have reported previously on the process of reduction [12]. The chromia species in the as prepared catalyst is Cr2O3. Reduction by hydrogen removes oxygen to produce a species that can be described by the formula CrO [12]. The propyne further reduces this species and after the six pulses a formula of CrO0.7 can be determined. However, to understand more about the reduction process the catalyst was reduced in deuterium. The chemical product distribution was the same as that found with the protium reduced catalyst, however, the isotopomer distribution of the methane was revealing. Table 2 shows significant amounts of deuterium incorporated into the methane product, indicating that the reduced catalyst had retained deuterium. This suggests that to get further reduction a better reducing agent than hydrogen is required and at these temperatures carbon is more effective. The isotopic profile of methane displayed in Table 2 is unusual with the first pulse showing no CD4 yet it is produced in subsequent pulses. In the first pulse there is considerable loss of protium from the propyne. The extent of carbon deposition over the three pulses is relatively constant, however the hydrogen deposition is not. This can be seen in the ratio of C:H deposited, a value of 1:3 is obtained for the first pulse but only 1:0.1 for the next two. When the deuterium reduced catalyst results are compared with an equivalent protium reduced catalyst we find that the carbon deposition is similar but the initial hydrogen deposition is dramatically different. It is this large influx of protium in the first pulse that skews the isotopic distribution towards the CD2H2.
The extent of carbon laydown is significant with over 80% of some pulses being retained. However it is noticeable that as the temperature is increased the extent of carbon deposition decreases. This was not expected, as usually as temperature is raised carbon deposition increases. However, in this system there is an effective competing reaction. Carbon deposition can be described by two equations
(1)
C3H4 → 3C + 2H2
(2)
C3H4 → CH4 + 2C
Both are thermodynamically favoured with ΔG = −215 kJ mol−1 for Eq. (1) at 800 K, and ΔG = −217 kJ mol−1 for Eq. (2) at 800 K. If only Eq. (2) operated the maximum carbon laydown that could be observed would be 67% on a carbon basis. Therefore at 773 K it would appear that Eq. (1) is dominant, with high levels of carbon deposition and low levels of methane (<15%). By 900 K the thermodynamics have changed very little, Eq. (1) is more favoured by 5 kJ mol−1 while Eq. (2) is less favoured by 5 kJ mol−1. The most significant change is for the methane cracking reaction (CH4 → C + 2H2), which moves from a positive ΔG at 800 K (2.5 kJ mol−1) to a negative ΔG at 900 K (−8.3 kJ mol−1). By 873 K, Eq. (2) is dominant with methane yields up to 31% (c.f. theoretical maximum of 33%). Therefore from these results it would appear that the system is not at thermodynamic equilibrium. Mechanistically, however, we should remember that Eqs. (1) and (2) are stoichiometric representations and not actual descriptions of the surface processes. For example it is likely that propyne does fracture on contact with the surface giving adsorbed carbon (possibly in a C-2 unit) and an adsorbed methyl fragment. The methyl fragment can then either be hydrogenated using retained hydrogen from the reduction or the other hydrogen from the propyne to give methane, or it can dehydrogenate to give carbon and hydrogen. This dehydrogenation process is reversible and is the likely process to allow isotopic incorporation.
C3H4(g) → HCC(a) + CH3(a)
HCC(a) → CC(a) + H(a)
CH3(a) ⇔ CH2(a) + H(a) ⇔ CH(a) + H(a) ⇔ C(a) + H(a)
CH3(a) + H(a) → CH4(g)
4.2. d8-Propane
From Table 3 there is a significant kinetic isotope effect, such that at 773 K no deuteropropane was detected. Typical values, under identical conditions, for h8-propane would be 30% propene, 61% propane [10]. Calculation of the size of the kinetic isotope effect at 823 K gave a value of η = 1.85 [13], which represents the maximum effect possible at this temperature as defined by Eyring and Cagle [14]. An equivalent isotope effect was also observed in ethane dehydrogenation over a chromia catalyst [15]. Therefore by using d8-propane it proved possible to interrogate the process as to whether full dehydrogenation was required for transhydrogenation. As dehydrogenation is the loss of two hydrogen atoms and it is the loss of the second hydrogen that is rate determining [13], then it should be possible to determine whether displacement of the first equilibrium is occurring by examining the isotopic profiles in the transhydrogenation reaction.
In general, the carbon deposited during propane dehydrogenation is not easily removed from the catalyst surface. However, in all cases the chromia is re-oxidised. This suggests that, for the dehydrogenation reaction, the amount of carbon residing on the chromia may be small. Previous studies on propane dehydrogenation [10], [11], [12] have shown that the carbon produced is principally polycyclic aromatics. Such materials can spillover onto the support and hence the ability to combust will diminish considerably even though the catalyst will be regenerated for the dehydrogenation reaction. Note that the carbon from the reaction of propyne over the catalyst is far more amenable to combustion, suggesting that a different type of carbonaceous deposit has been produced.
4.3. Propyne/d8-propane
From Table 4 it is clear that at 773 K no propene produced. The dehydrogenation reaction is not operable and so no transhydrogenation occurs. However examination of the carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane yields does reveal that the system has changed. When propyne is passed over the catalyst in the absence of deuteropropane, the major product is initially carbon dioxide and then methane (Table 1). However, when deuteropropane is present, methane is the major product, with only low levels of CO and CO2 being produced. Isotopic analysis of the methane revealed that over 75% was CH4, with most of the rest CDH3 and CD2H2. The presence of deuterium in the methane, and isotopic analysis of the propane (Fig. 2), confirms that single atom exchange was taking place with the deuteropropane even though no full dehydrogenation is occurring. However, if the deuteropropane is not reacting then the maximum amount of methane that can be produced should only be ∼16% not over 20%. A mass balance of the carbon and hydrogen confirms that although carbon is being deposited, hydrogen is being gained from the catalyst. The excess hydrogen gained is 9.54 × 1019 H atoms g−1, which gives a Cr:H ratio of 9:1.
At 823 K, from thermodynamic calculations, the equilibrium conversion of propane to propene is 33%. From Table 4 the yield of propene, as a function of the C-3 components, is in excess of 50% confirming that transhydrogenation is taking place. Isotopic analysis of the propene (Fig. 3) shows that the deuterium content is consistent with transhydrogenation of propyne with deuterium from propane. Much of the propyne is still reacting to give methane and carbon oxides, although the yields indicate that propane is also reacting to give these products in a manner not seen when propane is the sole reactant. Therefore, the system is interactive with propyne being hydrogenated to propene and propane being decomposed to methane and carbon oxides.
The results obtained at 873 K are surprising. The system shows a high propensity to further reduce the catalyst, the propene yield has dropped and there is little propane in the exit gas. At this temperature the by-product reactions seen at 823 K are now magnified and dominate over the transhydrogenation reaction. The loss of propane is dramatic, although this is not seen with propane as sole reactant, even at higher temperatures, indicating that propyne is catalysing the decomposition of propane. In pulse 1, the principal product is carbon dioxide, and indeed if we examine the trend from 773 to 873 K, the yield of carbon dioxide in pulse 1 increases from 0.4 to 13.3% to 64%. This is in contrast to the separate data obtained for propyne and propane alone. (Table 1, Table 3). The propene/propane data show a highly unusual mix far removed from equilibrium. Yet the isotopic profile for propene is very close to an equilibrated hydrogen system (Fig. 5). In contrast, the isotopic profile for methane is not equilibrated (Table 5). Together, these points indicate that the interaction of propyne and propane over this catalyst is particularly complex.

In Section 1 transhydrogenation was represented as two pseudo-independent reactions, notwithstanding the requirement that if the dehydrogenation reaction did not proceed then there would be little, if any, hydrogenation. Clearly, these stoichiometric equations bear little resemblance to the actual surface chemistry that is occurring on the catalyst at 873 K. If we first examine the methane yield and, in particular, the isotopic profile shown in Table 5, it is tempting to suggest that the majority of the methane comes from propyne, since the latter can be considered as a major source of protium. However, Table 2 shows that the catalyst retains considerable amounts of reduction gas, which, in this case, is hydrogen rather than deuterium. This phenomenon has been observed previously in both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation systems [16], [17]. Hence, the biasing of the methane isotopic distribution may relate more to the nature of the reduction gas than the source of the carbon. Indeed, using the value for the excess protium found at 773 K, there is one protium atom for every methane molecule formed. This is not, however, reflected in the protium/deuterium mix in propene. We conclude that the propene and methane sample two different hydrogen populations on the catalyst; the methane precursor accessing hydrogen stored by the catalyst, whereas the C-3 species accesses surface hydrogen produced during the reaction, but cannot access the post-reduction hydrogen species. It is possible that the difference lies in the position of the hydrogen within the catalyst. Recent studies [18], [19] have indicated that sub-surface hydrogen has a different reactivity to surface hydrogen and this species correlates with the retained hydrogen in our system.
One of the most unexpected aspects of the transhydrogenation system was the dramatic loss of the propane. In principle, we should be pleased with this result as it shows that the transhydrogenation has gone effectively to completion. The thermodynamics allow for the conversion of both propyne and propane into propene, so that achieving a >80% concentration of propene in the exit C-3 stream is within the thermodynamic limitations of the system. However, one of the other major products is methane and the actual yield of propene is low. In tests where propene alone was pulsed over the catalyst at 873 K, methane and carbon were the sole products [20]. On this basis we conclude that methane production is due to a secondary reaction of propene. Therefore, it is likely that the observed product distribution is a function of extensive transhydrogenation to propene, followed by secondary reactions of the propene to methane and carbon dioxide.
5. Conclusions
The interaction of propyne with the potassium-doped chromia/alumina catalyst in the absence of propane results in further reduction of the catalyst, concomitant with extensive carbon deposition and the formation of methane. Only trace quantities of propene were observed. As the temperature is increased, rather surprisingly, the extent of carbon laydown decreases. This appears to be due to more efficient conversion of the methyl fragment of propyne into methane. The carbon deposited is easily combusted and is associated with the chromia. As the carbonaceous deposit is removed the chromia is re-oxidised.
The dehydrogenation of propane over this catalyst has been extensively studied [10], [11], [12], [13] and the data from this study are in keeping with the literature. The dehydrogenation reaction exhibits a significant kinetic isotope effect such that at 773 K no dehydrogenation of C3D8 is observed. However, single atom exchange does occur at 773 K. The carbon burn-off results indicate that the carbonaceous deposit is not associated with the chromia but may reside of the support and hence is only poorly combusted. Chromia re-oxidation is the major process occurring during the oxygen treatment.
The transhydrogenation reaction is complex and was shown, by use of isotopic labels, to require full dehydrogenation of propane to propane. At 773 K there is no transhydrogenation between C3H4 and C3D8 but the presence of propane inhibits propyne reduction of the catalyst. Isotopic analysis of the methane confirmed that it is principally produced from propyne. The carbon burn-off data show behaviour akin to propane dehydrogenation rather than laydown from propyne yet the majority of the carbon deposit is generated from propyne. Transhydrogenation is observed at 823 and 873 K concomitant with dehydrogenation of C3D8. By 873 K the conversion to propene is such that 80% of the C-3 stream was propene. However, the yield of propene was low due to secondary reactions leading to methane and carbon.
