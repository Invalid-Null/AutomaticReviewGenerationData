 Unfortunately, the multiple extractions provided do not contain enough detailed information to synthesize a comprehensive summary related to propane dehydrogenation research. The documents seem to focus on methane dehydroaromatization instead. As such, I cannot provide an integrated XML output for propane dehydrogenation based on the given information. Please provide documents that are directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation catalysts, mechanisms, and processes in order to extract key details and generate a unified summary.
