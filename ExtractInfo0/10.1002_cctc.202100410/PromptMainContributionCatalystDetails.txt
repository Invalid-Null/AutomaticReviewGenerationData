Graphical Abstract
Support and stabilize: Monodispersed cobalt-nitrogen compounds (Co−N species) are successfully anchored on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and the CoN@OCNT hybrid catalysts exhibit high activity in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Co−N species serve as main active sites, while CNTs do not only serve as supports but also provide covalent linking to enhance the stability of the catalysts.
Abstract
A hybrid catalyst comprising atomically dispersed cobalt-nitrogen compounds anchoring on oxidized carbon nanotubes (OCNTs) is prepared and applied in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The proposed non-precious catalyst exhibits high initial conversion (∼20 %) and excellent selectivity of propene (>95 %), which is superior to those of metal-free nanocarbon and some metal-based catalysts. The chemical composition and structure of the proposed hybrid catalysts are elucidated by a series of characterizations and control experiments with a single component. These characterization results combined with the kinetic analysis indicate that the catalytic activity mainly originates from the cobalt-nitrogen (Co−N) species supported on the OCNT surface. The present work sheds light on the structure-function relationships of CoN catalysts, paving the way to develop non-precious catalysts for PDH reactions.
Introduction
Propylene is a very important type of raw materials, which can be used to produce a variety of high value-added petrochemical products, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide and propionaldehyde etc.1 In the past 20 years, the global propylene demanding market has been expanding continuously, and the production capacity of propylene will reach up to 165 million tons by 2030.2 The main synthetic route of propylene is the distillation and cracking of oil, but these processes often lead to high energy consumption and low selectivity to propylene.3 The limited reservation and unstable supply of crude oil cannot fully satisfy the huge demanding gap for propylene, and there is an urgent requirement for large scale substitution process.4 The dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to corresponding propylene seems to be a very promising strategy considering the atomic and energetic economy. This synthetic route has developed rapidly, especially with the progress and maturity of mining and processing technique of shale gas,5a, 5b which is well acknowledged by the continuous growth of the new installation or expansion of dozens of propane dehydrogenation plants worldwide.6 The design and development of novel catalysts and reaction systems with high performance and stability for propane dehydrogenation becomes a hot topic in the field of chemical engineering and material science. In state of art, the most mature propane dehydrogenation technology is still the anaerobic direct dehydrogenation reaction systems,7a, 7b and PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex technology) and Cr/Al2O3 (Catofin technology) are commercial catalysts for this process.8-11 The most serious problems of this reaction system are the relatively low activity and stability of the catalysts since the equilibrium conversion limits the reaction, and the carbon deposition could seriously block the active sites. The present solution for improving the activity and stability is the strategy introducing high temperature or high-pressure steam to break the reaction equilibrium and prevent the deactivation of the catalyst, however, in this case, the reaction system has serious problems of high energy consumption and safety risk. In addition, the decreasing reservation and increasing price of platinum materials and the toxicity of chromium compounds have also restricted the further development of propane anaerobic dehydrogenation technology.12-14
With this influential background, continuous efforts have been made to further modify or enhance the traditional platinum- or chromium-based catalysts using promoters such as germanium, zinc, tin, indium and manganese etc., but the problems of carbon deposition and catalyst deactivation under high temperature still exist in these systems.15 Therefore, there is still great scientific challenge for developing novel catalyst with high activity, low cost and sustainability for propane dehydrogenation.16-21 Among these new non-precious and non-toxic metal catalysts, the environmental friendly cobalt-based catalysts have attracted much attention due to their high activity in C−H bond activation of alkanes and selectivity for olefin products.22-28 However, there is still coke existing for these catalysts during the reaction process even under the protection of hydrogen, and the Al2O3 materials with strong acidity is commonly used as the support of the active metal species, which will easily induce the dissociation of C−C bond in propane and generate undesirable side products during the high temperature reaction process.29 Therefore, it is necessary to find a proper way to overcome these problems. Recently, the atomically dispersed metal-based catalysts have also been confirmed to be a new option in homogeneous catalytic reactions, which can achieve the maximum utilization efficiency of metal atoms and the optimization of catalytic performance due to their superior geometric structure and electronic properties.30a, 30b The single-atom metal catalysts have also been used in propane dehydrogenation reactions, which attributes to promote the selectivity of propene and inhibit the carbon deposition.31a, 31b In addition, the isolated metal atoms with distinct electronic structure can regulate effectively the surface electron property of catalyst, which directly produces a strong interaction between metal and support.32 At the same time, nanocarbon materials have been tested as the ideal supports for various catalytic reactions because of their high surface area and the fact that these materials are both inexpensive, sustainable and environmentally friendly.33a, 33b
In the present work, we have designed and synthesized a composite catalyst comprising of atomically dispersed cobalt-nitrogen (Co−N) compounds on carbon nanotubes, which has shown high catalytic activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The Co−N species are monodispersed on carbon nanotube (CNT) surface with firm covalent bonding. The homogeneous dispersion and ideal surface area to volume ratio (atomically dispersion) of Co−N compounds ensure the efficient utilization of active sites leading to the superior catalytic activity in PDH reactions. It should be noted that the Co−N species are rarely applied in alkane dehydrogenation reactions,34-36 although this type of nonprecious metal-N compound has been reported showing high-activity in C−H bond activation reactions.37-41 The present research shows the progress in not only revealing the potential of Co−N/C nanomaterials in low alkane dehydrogenation reactions but also the origin and the intrinsic catalytic activity of the active sites and the related structure-function relationships via linking the activity and structure of the hybrid catalysts. In addition, the CNT components do not only serve as the carrier to improve the surface area of the Co−N species, but also provide covalent linking to enhance the stability of the catalysts.
Results and Discussion
Chemical composition and structure of CoN@OCNT hybrid catalysts
Scheme 1 briefly describes the preparation process for CoN@OCNT hybrid catalysts. 1,10-phenanthroline, cobalt nitrate and OCNT are used as nitrogen coordinator, cobalt source, and support substrate precursors, respectively. The strong coordination interactions between cobalt cation and 1,10-phenanthroline lead the formation of stable complexes with Co−N4 structure (as shown in Scheme 1), which are uniformly attached onto the OCNT surface via π-π interactions after impregnation. The small complex fragment may be gradually carbonized forming the Co−N species along with a small amount of cobalt oxide or cobalt clusters/nanoparticles during the subsequent calcination process. To simplify the catalyst and obtain only monodispersed Co−N species on the OCNT surface, the hybrid samples were further pickled to remove impurities. Pure CoNC materials without CNT supports are also synthesized for comparisons.

The TEM images (Figure 1a-b) of the typical fresh CoN@OCNT materials (with the weight percent of doping amount of cobalt precursors at 20 wt.%) indicate that there is disordered carbon on OCNT surface, but there are no metal particles or aggregates could be observed in the image, suggesting the very small size and high dispersion of cobalt species. The HAADF-STEM images and corresponding elemental mapping analysis (Figure 1c–h) show that the carbon, nitrogen, cobalt, and oxygen elements distributed homogeneously on OCNT. These TEM results indicate that the tube-like morphology of CNT matrix would maintain after the preparation processes, and the Co−N species are successfully anchored on CNT surface uniformly existing in the states of very small clusters or single atoms. In addition, the entanglement and aggregation of the CNT tube-like structure would be depressed after loading of Co−N as shown in the SEM image (Figure S1a). For comparisons, pure CoNC materials exhibit an amorphous blocky structure with some bubble-like macropores (Figure S2a–b), and Co, N, O and C are also the main elements on it as shown in the EDX survey spectra (Figure S2c).

Pure CoNC has much smaller surface areas (30 m2/g vs. 284 m2/g) and pore sizes (5.6 nm vs. 21.2 nm) than CoN@OCNT as shown in Figure S3a-d. The proposed CoN@OCNT materials well maintain the mesoporous nature of OCNT matrix with the slightly decreased surface area (284 m2/g vs. 339 m2/g) due to the introduction of Co with high molecular weight, and the enhancement of the hierarchical porosity would benefit the utilization of Co−N species and improve the catalytic activity in a certain extent. Raman spectroscopy has been broadly used to evaluate the degree of order for carbonaceous materials.42 The ID1/IG values (Figure S4) for CoN@OCNT materials increase with the loading amount of Co−N species, suggesting that the degree of order for OCNT slightly decreases after modifying with Co−N species. XRD analysis (Figure S5) on CoN@OCNT samples show only two characteristic broad diffraction signals at 26° and 44° corresponding to the (002) and (100) planes of the graphitic nanocarbon, but there is no obvious diffraction signal of cobalt or cobalt oxide clusters/particles, suggesting the well maintenance of the OCNT structure and the absence of large metal particles, which is consistent with above TEM and Raman results. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on CoN@OCNT in air (Figure S6) and argon (Figure S7) atmosphere reveals its thermostability and operating (reaction) temperature. The decomposition temperature of CoN@OCNT in air gradually decreases with the increasing of the doping amount of the 1,10-phenanthroline/Co2+ precursors, indicating the reduced thermostability. However, the decomposition (burning) temperature of Co−N species significantly increases (Figure 2a) after supporting on OCNT (>400 °C vs. 300 °C in air). The actual loading content of Co−N species on OCNT could be estimated from the residual weight (assuming to be Co3O4 as suggested by IR and XRD in Figure S8) after TGA in air, and it gradually increases with the increasing of the 1,10-phenanthroline/Co2+ precursors but tends to be gentle after the amount over 15 % with the actual loading content of Co−N at around 5 % (Figure 2b). The proposed CoN@OCNT materials and OCNT substrates exhibit relatively high thermal stability in inert argon atmosphere, and they will lose mass only after the temperature increasing above 600 °C (Figure S7), indicating the reaction temperature threshold in PDH reactions. On the contrary, there is a severe decomposition for CoNC at 500 °C, suggesting that the well-defined nanostructure after supporting on OCNT matrix would effectively improve the thermal stability of Co−N species.

The XPS analysis is performed to study the surface elemental composition and the electronic states of the synthesized CoN@OCNT materials. The XPS survey scan spectra of CoN@OCNT−X (X represents the initially added mass percentage of cobalt precursors as shown in Figure S9) exhibits the coexistence of C, N, O and Co as major elements in the composite, which is consistent with the SEM-EDS survey spectra. As shown in Figure 2c, the binding energy signals at around 780.5 eV and 796.3 eV with two satellite peaks at 785.5 eV and 803.2 eV, respectively, correspond to the characteristic Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2 signals belonging to Co2+ species coordinated to nitrogen atoms (Co−N structure as shown in Scheme 1).43-46 This Co−N coordinated structure has shown high thermo- and acid- stability,47 which could survive after high temperature calcination. The Co 2p fine spectra of CoN@OCNT and CoNC are completely the same, indicating that the ingredient of Co−N remains its structure after supporting on OCNT. The N 1s XPS fine spectra (Figure 2d) of CoN@OCNT and CoNC could be deconvoluted into five peaks at 398.6, 399.9, 401.1, 402.3 and 404.3 eV, corresponding to the pyridine N, Co−N, pyrrole N, graphite N and oxidized N species, respectively,48 and the pyridine N and Co−N species are the main existing chemical states of nitrogen element. It is interesting to observe that the O 1s XPS signals belonging to oxygen functionalities on OCNT49a, 49b substrates (Figure S10) shift slightly to lower binding energy position50 with the increase of the loading amount of Co−N as shown in Figure S11, suggesting that there are certain interactions between Co−N and carbon support. However, the binding energies of Co−N species (Co 2p 3/2 signal) keep almost the same with different loading amount, indicating the identical electronic state of Co−N species on these series of samples. The X-ray absorption spectrum (XAS) analysis with synchrotron irradiation as light source is performed to further investigate the coordination structure and valence state of Co−N species at atomic level. The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of the Co K-edge and the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra for CoN@OCNT and a series of pure standard samples (Co foil, CoO, Co3O4 and CoPC) are measured to show the chemical structure of Co species in the composite. As shown in the XANES spectra (Figure 3a), the Co K-edge for CoN@OCNT locates in between that for pure Co foil and CoO (dotted bordered rectangle), and which is close to that for CoO, implying that the Co species in CoN@OCNT may carry positive charges similar to Co2+. The Fourier-transformed EXAFS spectra (Figure 3b) and the corresponding fitting curves in K-space (Figure 3c) and R-space (Figure 3d) reveal the average interatomic distance (R) and the coordination number (CN) from the fitting results (Table S3). The CoN@OCNT sample exhibits the characteristic signals belonging to Co−N (O) at 1.98 and 2.16 Å with the coordination number (CN) of 3.9 and 1.2, respectively. In addition, the typical Co−Co peak (eg. from Co foil) at around 2.49 Å cannot be observed in CoN@OCNT sample except one small peak at 2.51 Å−1 with the CN of 0.9, indicating that Co atoms are well isolated with the coordination of four N atoms, forming the Co−N4 structure accompanying with limited amount of small Co clusters. It is further proved by the Wavelet transform (WT) of Co K-edge EXAFS oscillations that the cobalt species in CoN@OCNT is in the monodispersed state, since the maximum intensity value for CoN@OCNT in the WT contour plot locates at 4.8 Å−1 (Figure S12), which is similar to that for cobalt phthalocyanine standard samples (at 5.7 Å−1), suggesting the existence of the Co−N species.51a, 51b In addition to these signals, the contour plots (light green zone) at 8.5 Å−1 indicate the existing of Co−Co bonding (few cobalt clusters) in CoN@OCNT, which is similar to that for Co foil and Co3O4 (or CoO) standard samples (at 7.5 and 6.8 Å−1 as shown in Figure S12).

In short summary, the chemical structure of the synthesized CoN@OCNT materials could be revealed by above characterization results as shown in Scheme 1. The Co−N species disperse homogeneously on OCNT surface, and the Co atom mainly coordinates with four nitrogen atoms at its periphery existing as Co−N4 architectures with slight surface Co−O species, and a small amount of Co clusters may also co-exist in CoN@OCNT catalyst. The CoN@OCNT hybrid material has relatively high surface area and thermal stability, indicating its potential as an efficient heterogeneous dehydrogenation catalyst.
Catalytic performance and structure-function relationships
As shown in Figure 4, the synthesized CoN@OCNT hybrid materials exhibit relatively high catalytic activity and long-term stability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. It needs to be mentioned that the GHSV of the reaction is optimized to be above 2.25 ml mg−1 h−1 as shown in Figure S13, and the following reactions are all performed in this region to eliminate the diffusion effect and reflect the intrinsic activity of the catalysts. CoN@OCNT shows the initial conversion of propane up to 20 % at 570 °C, and the catalyst would experience a slight deactivation after 20 h. The total selectivity to alkenes for CoN@OCNT is over 98 % with the specific selectivity of propylene and ethylene at around 95 % and 3 %, respectively. The carbon balance has been determined at 100 % ± 2% in the absence of steam or H2 protection, indicating the negligible coke deposition after 20 h reactions. The catalytic activity, alkene selectivity and relatively high stability of CoN@OCNT reaches the best level of reported cobalt-based catalysts for PDH reactions, as shown in Table S4, suggesting the potential of CoN@OCNT materials in the substitution of Pt- or V-based PDH catalysts.

The activity of CoN@OCNT hybrid catalysts with different Co−N loadings are evaluated and compared to clarify the critical role of Co−N species in PDH reactions as shown in Figure S14 (ambient pressure, 550 °C, in the absence of any protection). The initial conversion of propane reaches 15 % under the catalysis of CoN@OCNT, while it decreases slightly to 12.5 % after 7.5 hours with the propene selectivity over 95 %. The catalytic activity of CoN@OCNT gradually increases with the loading content of Co−N species, suggesting its activity in PDH reactions. It should also be noted that both OCNT and pure CoNC exhibit certain catalytic activity in PDH reactions, but the CoN@OCNT hybrid catalyst exhibits over 3 times higher activity (Figure 5a, green bar) than the physical mixture of these two components (0.45 vs. 0.15 mmol g−1 h−1) at the same dosage, suggesting the synergistic effect of atomic dispersion and immobilization. It is also proved that the Co−N coordination structure is the key for the high catalytic activity of CoN@OCNT hybrid catalyst, since loading of single Co or N precursors (cobalt nitrate or 1,10-phenanthroline) on OCNT would lead to poor catalytic activity in PDH reactions as shown in Figure 5a. Meanwhile, the Co−N species can also promote the selectivity of propene (Figure 5a, black bar). It can be seen from the surface component of CoN@OCNT and CoNC in Table S1 that the atomic percentage of cobalt and nitrogen gradually increases with the increasing of Co2+/1,10-phenanthroline precursor, and the cobalt content for CoNC reaches 1.32 %. Nevertheless, the intrinsic activity (turnover frequency, TOF) of CoN@OCNT is 4.8 times higher than that of CoNC, representing the obvious catalytical advantages of CoN@OCNT. Furthermore, the relationship between the propane conversion rate and the content of Co−N species (Table S2) could be established as shown in Figure 5b, and the linear dependence further confirms that the Co−N species serve as the main catalytic active sites for PDH reactions.

The chemical composition and structure of the CoN@OCNT catalysts after reactions are thoroughly characterized to reveal the reaction process. The XRD patterns (Figure S15), N2 adsorption/desorption measurements (Figure S3c–d) and the TEM (Figure S16) and SEM (Figure S1b) images of the used samples exhibit that there is no agglomeration of cobalt compounds, and the elements of Co, O and N still disperse uniformly on OCNT surface with unchanged surface area and pore size distributions, indicating the structural integrity of the CoN@OCNT catalysts after high temperature reactions. On the contrary, a completely different XRD pattern for pure CoNC could be observed after reaction with three new emerging peaks at 41.5°, 44.4° and 47.4°, suggesting the formation of cobalt particles. These results indicate the coordination structure of monodispersed Co in composite together with the supporting effect of OCNT matrixes are the keys for ensuring the stability of CoN@OCNT catalysts. The XAS analysis on the used CoN@OCNT sample suggests that the Co−N coordination structure changes slightly after PDH reactions (the CN of Co−O increases from 1.2 to 1.7 as shown in Table S3). As shown Figure S17a-b, the Co K-edge absorption (orange line) for the used CoN@OCNT samples is closer to the position (shift slightly) of CoO species than fresh sample (green line), suggesting the element Co may carry more positive charges after reactions. The Fourier-transformed k2-weighted EXAFS spectra (Figure S17c) of CoN@OCNT catalysts after reaction shows two main peaks at 1.9 Å and 2.09 Å, ascribing to Co−N and Co−O coordination bond, respectively, which is similar to that of the fresh samples. In addition, the CN of Co−Co bond at 2.46 Å for the used CoN@OCNT is 0.4, and which is slightly smaller than that for the fresh sample (0.4 vs. 0.9). However, the fitting curve (Figure S17d-e) and corresponding results (Table S3) in K space and R space suggests the CN of Co−N decreases from 3.9 to 2.9 after reactions. Therefore, this coordination structure evolution may be one of the main reasons for the continuous slight deactivation of the CoN@OCNT during PDH reactions. The apparent activation energy (Ea) for CoN@OCNT catalyzed PDH reaction is determined at 96.6 kJ/mol via Arrhenius plots (as shown in Figure S18a), which is just in the middle of CoNC and OCNT (Ea=76.4 and 108.9 kJ/mol). It should be mentioned that the kinetic analysis shown in this part is performed under the kinetic region, where the propane conversion is controlled below 10 % without the influence of diffusion limitation. It is also interesting to find that the Ea (Figure S18b) of CoN@OCNT samples gradually decreases with the increasing of Co−N species loading, suggesting the synergistic effect of Co−N species and OCNT in enhancing the PDH catalytic activity.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a CoN@OCNT hybrid catalyst comprising the atomically dispersed Co−N species on carbon nanotubes has been successfully prepared via the well-controlled precipitation and carbonization procedure. The CoN@OCNT composite exhibits relatively high activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, which has reached the best level reactivity for Co-based alkane dehydrogenation catalysts. The Co−N species are considered as the main active sites for PDH reactions since the catalytic activity has shown linear dependence on the loading content of Co−N species. The slight deactivation of the CoN@OCNT catalyst after long term PDH reactions is found related to the variations of the coordination environment of Co sites (from CoN4 to CoN3) via XAS analysis. The present work provided a creative type of alkane dehydrogenation catalyst based on Co−N coordination structure, and more importantly, the establishment of the structure-function relationships may serve as important guidelines for rational design and synthesis of non-precious Co-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.
Experimental Section
Pretreatment of carbon nanotubes
1 g commercial carbon nanotube (CNT) (Shandong Dazhan Nano Materials Co., Ltd.,) was mixed with 100 mL concentrated hydrochloric acid (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., 36.5 %) by stirring at room temperature for 12 h to remove the residual metal impurities. This dispersion was washed with deionized water via filtration until the filtrate was colorless and its pH reaching neutral. Next, the dehydrated filter cake of CNT was grinded and then refluxed in 100 mL concentrated nitric acid (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., 68 %) at 120 °C for 2 h, and the oxidized carbon nanotube (OCNT) was collected and washed several times with distilled water until the pH of the filtrate reached 7. Finally, the crude product was rinsed with anhydrous ethanol thoroughly and dried at 80 °C overnight to get OCNT sample.
Preparation process of CoN@OCNT catalysts
Firstly, 1 g OCNT powder was dispersed evenly in 100 mL anhydrous ethanol via ultrasonication for 30 min. 1.22 g 1,10-phenanthroline (Alfa Aesar Chemical Co., Ltd., 99 %) was added, and the mixture was stirred uniformly at room temperature for 12 hours. 60 mL Co(NO3)2 ⋅ 6H2O (0.057 mol/L, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., 99 %) solution was added dropwise into the above mixture. The molar ratio of cobalt atoms to 1,10-phenanthroline was controlled at 1 : 2. The mixed dispersion was dried by distillation at 40 °C under reduced pressure to obtain the solid powder. The sample was calcinated at 600 °C (the heating rate was maintained at 4.5 °C/min) in a tubular furnace under the argon atmosphere for 4 hours. The calcined sample was transferred into 100 ml 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid solution with stirring for 12 hours to remove metal impurities, and the solid was filtered and washed with deionized water until the filtrate was colorless and the pH was 7. Finally, they were dried overnight to obtain the product in oven at 80 °C. The resulting sample was denoted as CoN@OCNT. Other hybrid catalysts with different Co−N loadings were also prepared following the same process, which are denoted as CoN@OCNT-X. (X represents the initially added mass percentage of cobalt precursors). Those catalysts with single component (1,10-phenanthroline or Co(NO3)2 ⋅ 6H2O) and without OCNT support for control experiments were also prepared following the similar way, which were labelled as NC@OCNT, Co@OCNT and CoNC. The CoNC sample was also physically blended with OCNT and SiO2 forming uniform powders for comparisons, and the mass percentage of cobalt in the physically blended sample was kept the same as that in CoN@OCNT, which were denoted as CoN-OCNT and CoN-SiO2, respectively.
Catalyst characterizations
Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas were measured via N2 adsorption-desorption measurement at 77 K with a Micro-metrics ASAP 2020 analyzer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer equipped with a rotating anode using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA) in the 2θ range of 5 to 85° with a scan rate of 10°/min. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded with an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) ESCALAB 250 system equipped with a monochromatic AlKα X-ray source (1486.6 eV; anode operating at 15 kV and 20 mA). The binding energies were calibrated with the C1s peak at 284.6 eV. Raman measurements were carried out with HORIBA LabRam HR800 Raman spectrometer equipped with the laser source at the wavelength of 532 nm. Morphology of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Nano450). TEM analysis was performed using FEI Tecnai G2 T12 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. High angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images were recorded on a FEI Talos F200S G2 microscope operated at 200 kV. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on the instrument of NETZSCH STA 449 C. IR studies were conducted with Thermo Nicolet iS10 ATR-FTIR system. The spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 with 32 scans at the resolution of 4 cm−1. The X-ray absorption spectra were collected on the beamline BL01 C1 in NSRRC and were provided technical support by Ceshigo Research Service “www.ceshigo.com”. The radiation was monochromatized by a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator. XANES and EXAFS data deconvolution and analysis were processed by Athena software.
Catalytic test of propane dehydrogenation
The propane dehydrogenation reaction was performed at 550 °C in a fixed bed quartz tube reactor with 10 mm outside diameter with plug flow. 0.25 g catalyst was mounted into the middle of reactor (thermostatic heating zone) with certain amount of quartz wool as cover and holder at the top and bottom of the catalyst powder to keep the same gas hour space velocity (GHSV) for all the catalysts. The durability experiment was tested at 570 °C with 0.20 g catalysts. The apparent activation energy was measured at 435–545 °C with 0.10 g catalyst. The reactant mixture contained 2.4 % C3H8 with balance He (99.999 %) at a total flow rate of 15 mL/min. The carbon balance for all the reactions were maintained at 100 % ± 2%. All the reactants and products (CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, C3H8, He, CO, CO2) were analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent 7890B) with the flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The conversion of reactant (Con), selectivity (S) and yield (Y) of product, conversion rate of reactant (Rc), formation rate of product (Rf) and carbon balance (Cb) were determined from Eq. (1), Eq. (2), Eq. (3), Eq. (4), Eq. (5) and Eq. (6), respectively. The capital letter N and F represent the number of carbon atoms in a reactant or product, the flow rate (input or output) of each component, respectively. The lower letter (including p, m, i) represents the product, dosage of catalyst and count symbol.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
