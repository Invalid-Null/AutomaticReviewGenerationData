Comparison of different methods for quantitative analysis of TAP pulse-response data for propane dehydrogenation over Pt–Sn–K/γ–Al2O3
Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation over a Pt–Sn–K/γ–Al2O3 catalyst has been studied in the TAP reactor. Qualitative analysis of the pulse responses reveals part of the reaction network. Dissociative adsorption of propane yields propylene and hydrogen. Propylene is further converted into coke. Hydrogen and propylene compete for the same active sites.
The first order rate constant for the propane conversion has been evaluated by moment analysis, the thin-zone model and regression analysis of the full pulse response for different catalyst bed lengths and temperatures. This has shown that the three methods yield comparable results for both the values of the rate constant and the corresponding activation energies. However, the expression derived from the thin-zone model is the easiest to use and gives a reasonable order of magnitude estimate of the first order rate constant.
1. Introduction
The temporal-analysis-of-products or TAP (Gleaves et al., 1988, Gleaves et al., 1997) has been recognized as an important transient experimental method for heterogeneous catalytic reaction studies. A TAP pulse response experiment consists of injecting a very small amount of gas per pulse into a tubular fixed bed reactor that is kept under vacuum. The pressure rise in the micro-reactor is small, and the gas molecules move through the reactor bed by Knudsen diffusion. The time-dependent exit flow rate of each gas is detected by a mass spectrometer. Over the last two decades the TAP technique has contributed to the understanding of a large number of reaction mechanisms (e.g. Ovsitser and Kondratenko, 2009; Bueno-López et al., 2008; Shekhtman et al., 2008; Pérez-Ramírez and Kondratenko, 2007; Delagrange and Schuurman, 2007; Fushimi et al., 2007; Medhekar et al., 2007; Poelman et al., 2007; O’Connor et al., 2006; Olafsen et al., 2006; Pérez-Ramírez et al., 2005, Pérez-Ramírez et al., 2004; Silberova et al., 2003; van Veen et al., 2002; Gerlach and Baerns, 1999; Monnet et al., 2001; Denton et al., 2000; Schuurman et al., 1997, Schuurman et al., 1999; Statman et al., 1991) mostly by quantitative interpretation of the pulse response data.
TAP micro-reactors may be presented in different configurations (see Fig. 1). The simplest configuration is called a one-zone TAP reactor, in which the reactor packing consists of a uniform bed of catalysts particles. A more common reactor configuration used in most catalytic reaction studies is called a three-zone TAP reactor, in which the catalyst bed is sandwiched between beds of inert particles. The main advantage of a three-zone reactor is that the catalyst zone can be easily maintained at isothermal conditions and the amount of catalyst can be adjusted easily without the creation of a dead volume in the reactor. The theoretical analysis of TAP pulse response data is based on the reactor model used to describe the catalyst bed configuration together with a kinetic scheme. The former also takes into account diffusion inside the pores of the catalysts if microporous materials are used (Phanawadee et al., 2005).

Fig. 1. Scheme of the different TAP reactor configurations.
The thin-zone TAP reactor (Shekhtman et al., 1999; Phanawadee et al., 2003) is a very useful limiting case of a three-zone configuration. The thickness of the catalyst zone in the thin-zone TAP reactor is very small compared to the length of the reactor. It was proposed to overcome the catalyst non-uniformity problem in TAP experiments and simplify the data interpretation (Shekhtman et al., 1999). In a TAP experiment the gas concentration gradient is the driving force for Knudsen diffusion. The thin-zone reactor configuration leads to negligible axial gas phase and surface concentration gradients and the reactor can be considered as a perfectly mixed reactor (Phanawadee et al., 2003). This feature facilitates data interpretation and this is reflected in the relatively easy expression for the moment analysis of a thin-zone reactor configuration.
Quantitative information of the phenomena in the reactor can be extracted from the size and the shape of the responses by the use of mathematical models that describe the process in the reactor (Schuurman, 2007). Kinetic evaluation of TAP experiments is typically based on analytical or numerical solution of partial differential equations describing chemical and transport process in the micro-reactor.
Different mathematical methods have been used in this work for the estimation of the kinetic parameters for the dehydrogenation of propane over a Pt–Sn–K/γ–Al2O3 catalyst, including moment analysis, a numerical solution and a thin-zone model. The aim of this work is to compare the results obtained with these three methods when different amounts of catalyst were used in TAP experiments. Moreover, the effect of the value of the Knudsen diffusion coefficient in the catalyst zone on activation energy and propane conversion was studied.
2. Mathematical models
2.1. Moment analysis
The moment approach is applicable to linear or quasilinear models only. This implies first order kinetics and an insignificant change in the surface concentration during a pulse experiment. This last condition is usually fulfilled as typically the quantity of gas molecules pulsed (1–5 nmol) amounts to 1–10% of the number of active sites. In TAP experiments, the measured variable is the exit flow rate (Gleaves et al., 1997). The dimensionless exit flow rate, F*, is the gradient of the dimensionless gas concentration at the exit and is described by
(1)
The definition of the variables and parameters is given in the notation section. The jth moment of the exit flow rate is defined by
(2)
For example, the zeroth moment, as function of the reactor axial coordinate, determines the total number of gas molecules that pass through the given cross section (Yablonsky et al., 1998). For the diffusion-only case, M0 is unity. In the case of an irreversible first-order reaction, the conversion is described (Gleaves, et al., 1997) by
The first moment correspond to the mean residence time in the reactor. For an irreversible reaction and a three zone reactor configuration, the analytical expression for the zeroth and first moment of the exit flow rate can be determined following the method described by Phanawadee (1997) in which the set of equations were transformed into the Laplace domain. The zeroth moment can be expressed as (Phanawadee, 1997)

where
, has the dimension of velocity and represents a characteristic transport conductivity for i zone,
, has the dimension time and represents a characteristic time for Knudsen diffusion in i zone,
, is dimensionless and represent a reaction/diffusion parameter for the catalyst zone.
2.2. Thin zone model
Shekhtman et al. (1999) solved the general thin zone model (TZM) and obtained expressions for the moments of exit flow rate for reactant and products. In this model the very thin catalyst zone sandwiched between two inert zones is viewed as a reactive boundary between the inert zones.
In the case of a first order irreversible reaction compact expressions for the zeroth and first moment of the exit flow can be obtained:
(5)
(6)
where
(7)
and the kinetic parameter
is related to the apparent reaction rate constant,
(s−1), that is measured in a one-pulse TAP experiment (Phanawadee, 1997), by the expression
(8)
Using Eqs. (11), (12), (13), the reciprocal of zeroth moment can be represented by the following expression:
(9)
Using Eqs. (9), (13), the following expression is obtained:
(10)
The residence time for diffusion through the catalyst zone
is equal to the difference between the residence time for diffusion through the ensemble (catalyst zone plus second inert zone) minus the residence time for diffusion through the second inert zone alone, where L2 is assumed to be much smaller than L3 (Shekhtman et al., 2003):
(11)
Knowing the residence time, the rate constant can be calculated from the following expression (Shekhtman et al., 2003):
(12)
2.3. Numerical solution
The analytical methods described above are fast but limited to simple reaction networks. The use of a numerical solution provides a quantitative description of TAP experiments with complex kinetics. This allows a more flexible approach in a larger set of reactions (Schuurman, 2007). From this point of view, two different approaches have been used.
Numerical methods based on Laplace transformation and fast Fourier transformation algorithm to calculate the exit flow (Svoboda et al., 1992, Svoboda et al., 1994; Mills and Dudukovic, 1989). But they are limited to linear equations, i.e. first order kinetics and low surface coverages.
Alternatively, in the other approach, partial differential equations can be transformed into coupled ODE's by a spatial approximation and these can be integrated numerically (van der Linde et al., 1997).
For the modeling of the data in this paper the first approach was used to integrate the partial differential equations and this was coupled to a Marquardt optimization routine for regression analysis. The reader is referred for details to Schuurman (2007).
3. Experimental
The catalyst used in this study was a Pt–Sn–K/γ–Al2O3 dehydrogenation catalyst, prepared by incipient wet impregnation in accordance with the literature procedure (Barias et al., 1996) but with variations in the composition. Nominal composition of the catalyst was 0.05, 0.14 and 0.10 wt% of Pt, Sn and K, respectively. Details of the catalyst preparation have been given in a previous work (Lobera et al., 2008). Before the kinetic studies, the catalyst was reduced in situ in a flow of H2:He=1:2 during 2 h at 823 K; reacted in C3H8:Ar=1:1 during 30 min at 773 K and regenerated in O2:He=1:20 during 1 h at 773 K. This reduction-reaction–regeneration cycle was repeated six times to obtain an aged and stable catalyst. These samples had a BET surface area 138 m2/g and pore volume 0.45 cm3/g. A similar catalyst was prepared using a γ-Al2O3 support having 30 m2/g.
In order to compare different methods for the interpretation of TAP response data, propane dehydrogenation vacuum transient experiments over a Pt–Sn–K/γ–Al2O3 catalyst were carried out in the TAP-2 reactor. A detailed description of the equipment is given elsewhere (Gleaves et al., 1997). Experiments were carried out with different amounts of the Pt–Sn–K/γ–Al2O3 catalyst sandwiched between two inert zones and were performed through the admission of a single pulse onto the catalyst (10 experiments were averaged in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio). The following gas mixture was applied: C3H8/Ar=1:1 and C3H6/Ar=1:1. The response signals to the gas pulses at the reactor outlet were recorded by a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Mass peaks at m/e=40, 29, 41 and 2 were used to monitor the responses of argon and propane, propylene and hydrogen, respectively. Pulse intensities of <1015 molecules per pulse were used to insure Knudsen flow conditions. Quantification of the results, i.e. calculation of conversion, was performed using argon as internal standard. The Knudsen diffusivities for all species were determined by experiments over a quartz bed.
In each experiment, the following procedure was done to fill the steel-made micro-reactor (25.4 mm), a constant weight of quart (220 mg,
) was put in the micro-reactor, and so the first inert zone had the same length in each experiment, 10 mm. Then a sample of catalyst (
) was placed in the micro-reactor. In each test, the length of the catalyst zone (L2) was different, because of different amounts of catalyst were used. Finally, the second inert zone was put in to the micro-reactor. The temperature of the bed (TB) was measured by a thermocouple placed in the center of the catalyst bed. The range of operating conditions was as follows: temperature, 573–873 K; molar fraction of propane, 0.5; catalyst mass, 10–100 mg. The catalyst was heated to the desired reaction temperature under vacuum at a rate of 10 K/min.
The conversion was obtained at the different temperatures T, from the following mass balance, assuming no propane conversion at 573 K and where PI is the ratio of the areas of the propane pulse response and the pulse response of argon:
(13)
4. Results and discussion
Fig. 2 shows the pulse responses of propane, propylene and hydrogen when a pulse of propane/argon is introduced over the Pt–Sn–K/γ–Al2O3 catalyst at 873 K. Clearly propylene exits after the propane pulse as it is the direct dehydrogenation product. Further decomposition of propylene into carbonaceous products is likely as the propylene pulse width is rather narrow. Indeed, coke has been identified during steady-state experiments. Pulses of propylene over the Pt–Sn–K/γ–Al2O3 catalyst result in a significant conversion of propylene at temperatures above 673 K without the detection of any gas phase products. Propylene thus forms coke but more experiments and modeling is needed to confirm that propylene is the principal coke precursor. A very broad hydrogen pulse is observed again indicating that carbonaceous products are formed that are slowly dehydrogenated. This is not due to strong interaction of hydrogen with the catalyst because when a single hydrogen pulse is introduced over the catalyst a much narrower response is recorded. Pump-probe experiments of hydrogen and propylene do not show the formation of propane but again propylene is converted at temperatures higher than 673 K at the same rate as during a single pulse experiment. When a hydrogen pulse is directly followed by a propylene pulse, hydrogen desorption is observed on the propylene pulse, indicating competitive adsorption between hydrogen and propylene. The data shown here were obtained over the low surface BET area catalysts to better show the propylene response. Over the high-surface BET area the propylene response is much broader due to the strong interaction with the support. Indeed, by pulsing propylene over the alumina support a long tailing of the propylene was observed indicating reversible sorption and significant diffusion inside the micropores of the support. An adsorption enthalpy of approximately −28 kJ/mol for the sorption of propylene on γ–Al2O3 was estimated from these data. From propylene pulse experiments over Pt–Sn–K/γ–Al2O3 an adsorption enthalpy of −68 kJ/mol for the sorption of propylene was estimated. As only the parameters for the propane conversion are estimated by the moment analysis the rest of the data in this paper concerns the high-surface BET area catalyst, which has been extensively studied under steady-state conditions (Lobera et al., 2008).

Fig. 3 shows the transient responses for argon and propane when a 1:1 mixture of propane/argon was pulsed over the Pt–Sn–K/γ–Al2O3 catalyst, at different temperatures. The exit flows have been normalized with respect to the propane response curve at 573 K. At 573 K, argon and propane transient responses present typical diffusion curves where no conversion of propane has been observed. The area of the pulse at 573 K has been normalized to 1 and the other pulse responses have been adjusted accordingly. Thus the areas of the pulses as a function of temperature in Fig. 3 are equal to the zeroth moments. As both the diffusivity and the conversion increases with temperature the pulse response curves become narrower with increasing temperature. No tailing is observed on the propane pulses indicating an irreversible reaction. Gleaves et al. (1997) set a characteristic fingerprint for first-order irreversible reaction by observing that the normalized responses should not cross the diffusion curve with increasing conversion. This is only valid if the diffusivity does not change, which is not the case here.

Fig. 4 shows the propane conversion that is obtained from the mass balance (Eq. (13)), as a function of the mass of catalyst (Wcat) for the different temperatures of reaction. This so-called “W over F curve” is commonly used in steady-state kinetics (Froment and Bischoff, 1990) but, surprisingly, has never been reported for TAP experiments. The propane conversion initially increases linearly with the amount of catalyst and then levels off. Similar curves are obtained at different temperatures. These curves are very similar to “X vs. W/F” curves in flow reactors. In steady-state experiments these curves can be obtained by varying the total flow. However, under Knudsen flow conditions the conversion in the TAP reactor at a given temperature does not change with pulse intensity. In order to change the conversion the amount of catalyst has to be varied.

As mentioned above before applying the moment analysis a kinetic model needs to be determined. From the propane pulse response shape as a function of the temperature it was deduced that the reaction of propane under TAP conditions is irreversible even though propane dehydrogenation is reversible under steady-state conditions at 1 bar (Lobera et al., 2008). The following reaction is assumed:
(14)
C3H8+x*→C3H8−x*+xH*
Furthermore it was assumed that this reaction is first order in propane and that the number of active sites does not change by admitting a series of propane pulses. These hypotheses will be verified later.
The apparent constant rate,
, corresponding to a given conversion can be calculated by a moment analysis, TZM or by modeling the full pulse response curve. These three approaches can then be further classified by defining which reactor model needs to be taken into account. As discussed above, generally all reactor models are based on Knudsen diffusion only, but they differ in the number and nature of the inert and catalyst zones. All these three methods need the propane diffusivity in the inert zones as input. The propane diffusivity was determined from pulse experiments in a one-zone reactor over the same quartz particles as used in the three-zone configuration. The diffusivity of propane in the catalyst bed is obtained from the diffusivity data of argon through the three-zone reactor corrected by the square root of the ratio of the molecular weights of argon and propane.
Fig. 5 shows the results of using three different methods, zeroth moment, TZM and full curve modeling, to calculate the rate constant. This has been done for the different amounts of catalysts. Rather similar values for the rate constants are obtained by the three different methods. Fig. 6 shows a comparison between the experimental response curves and the calculated ones based on regression analysis for the experiments over 20 mg. An adequate fit is observed over the whole temperature range. Similar fits are obtained for the other samples. Remarkably the thin-zone model yields similar results as the two other methods even at the longest catalyst bed length, which is outside its validity. Shekhtman et al. (2004) examined the validity range of the thin zone model and they reported that for a ratio of the catalyst bed length to the total reactor length of 0.1 a 10% error is estimated in the case of first order reactions up to conversion of 50%. Thus it can be expected that in the current case that the 50 mg sample (L2/L=0.1) is the upper limit for the validity range of the thin-zone model.

A slight decrease of the first order rate coefficient with the amount of catalyst is observed in all three cases. The rate constant has also been determined through the first moments. Fig. 7 shows the values of the rate constants as determined by the first moment for the different samples. A strong decrease of the rate constant is observed with increasing catalyst weight. The error bars in Fig. 7 represent a variation of 2.5% in the mean residence time (M1). Especially at small quantities of catalyst, the values of the rate constant change strongly with small variations of the mean residence time.

For the same set of experiments, the activation energy for propane dehydrogenation over Pt–Sn–K/γ–Al2O3 catalyst was calculated by moment analysis, TZM and regression analysis of the pulse response curves at all temperatures simultaneously. Fig. 8 shows an Arrhenius plot in the case of the zeroth moment analysis. Table 1 lists the activation energies according to the different methods. In the case of regression analysis the 95% confidence intervals have been determined (Schuurman, 2007). Similar values are obtained in the case of the moment analysis and the thin-zone model, but slightly higher values are obtained by regression analysis. In all three cases, a significant lower activation energy is calculated for the 10 mg sample. This is probably due to the fact that the pulse response changes very little at low conversions levels and thus introduces rather large errors. Cortright et al. (1998) report values of the activation energy of 61 and 42 kJ/mol for the dissociative adsorption of isobutene over Pt/Sn/SiO2 and Pt/Sn–K/SiO2, respectively, under steady-state conditions. These values are slightly lower than those reported in Table 1 for the dissociative adsorption of propane over Pt–Sn–K/γ–Al2O3 at low-pressure conditions.

To determine the cause of the decrease of the rate constant with increasing catalyst mass several hypotheses were examined more closely. Firstly the irreversible nature of the reaction was verified. As was mentioned earlier the TAP response curves of propane do not show any tailing indicating a reversible reaction. However, dehydrogenation reactions are reversible at higher pressures. Lobera et al. modeled the propane dehydrogenation over Pt–Sn–K/γ–Al2O3 using a reversible rate equation. Cortright et al. (1998) found that the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of isobutane are fully reversible over Pt/Sn supported catalysts. However, on the other hand to our knowledge no hydrogenation reactions have been successfully studied in the TAP reactor under low-pressure conditions. A simulation was carried out for the propane dehydrogenation over the 100 mg sample where the forward rate constant
was fixed at a value of 90 s−1, an average value for the data presented in Fig. 5. The reverse rate constant was then varied until the simulated curve corresponded to the experimental conversion on the time-scale of the TAP experiment. Fig. 9 shows the curve simulation for the simulated irreversible (full line) and reversible (dotted line) curve as well as the experimental data. A significant baseline shift is observed on the reversible response curve that is not noticeable on the experimental data. The irreversible reaction model thus seems to be the most appropriate as apparently under low-pressure conditions the equilibrium of dissociative propane adsorption is strongly displaced to the right hand side, towards the dissociated products. The second hypothesis is that the reaction is first order, i.e. that the fraction of free sites is close to one. The fraction of free sites increases with increasing catalyst amount as the number of molecules injected is fixed. The values of the rate constants reported in Fig. 5 are in fact the lumped expressions of
. If the fraction of free sites depended on the catalyst amount, the values of the rate constants in Fig. 5 should increase rather than decrease.

The influence of the value of the Knudsen diffusion coefficient in the catalyst zone (De,2), on the propane conversion
and the activation energy (Ea) has also been examined. The experimental results were fitted by using different values of the Knudsen diffusion coefficient

causes a greater impact on propane conversion when the amount of the catalyst used experiment increases. As expected, changes in De,2 are negligible when a low amount of catalyst is used as the residence time inside the catalyst zone is very short. For the 100 mg sample the correlation is almost linear in
. Thus the variation of the value of the rate constant with increasing bed length is most likely due to changes in the transport parameters through the reactor.

5. Conclusions
Propane dehydrogenation over a Pt–Sn–K/γ–Al2O3 catalyst has been studied in the TAP reactor. Over a low surface area catalyst, the formation of propylene and hydrogen has been observed. In fact propylene interacts strongly with the alumina support and for the high surface area support significant propylene diffusion inside the micropores occurs. The adsorption enthalpy of propylene sorption on the alumina support amounts −28 kJ/mol. At temperatures above 400 °C propylene is converted over the catalysts into carbonaceous products. Propylene and hydrogen compete for the same active sites. The dissociative adsorption of propane on Pt-Sn–K/γ–Al2O3 can be considered as irreversible under low-pressure conditions based on careful pulse response analysis. This is further substantiated by the lack of propane formation when a pulse of propylene and hydrogen are introduced over the catalyst in the TAP reactor. The disappearance rate of propane over Pt–Sn–K/γ–Al2O3 proceeds with an activation energy of approximately 65±10 kJ/mol.
The first order rate constant for the propane conversion has been evaluated by moment analysis, the thin-zone model and regression analysis of the full pulse response for different catalyst bed lengths and temperatures. This has shown that the three methods yield comparable results for both the value of the rate constant as the corresponding activation energies. The data seem to reveal a slight dependence of the rate constant on the catalyst bed length. Most likely this is due to a variance in the reactor packing leading to different values of the Knudsen diffusivity through the reactor. The value of the diffusivity in the catalyst zone does not affect the rate parameters at short bed lengths but has a significant impact when L2/L>0.1. There seems to exist an optimal catalyst loading in the sense that for small amount of catalysts the low conversions lead to large errors, whereas at high amounts the values of the kinetic parameters are sensitive to the exact value of the diffusivity in the catalyst zone, which precise determination remains a delicate task in some cases. The use of the zeroth moment gives a more accurate estimation of the values of the rate constants than the first moment. Eq. (12) derived from the thin-zone model provides an easy mean to estimate an order of magnitude rate constant for first order irreversible reactions in the TAP reactor, even in the case of the three zone reactor configurations.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
