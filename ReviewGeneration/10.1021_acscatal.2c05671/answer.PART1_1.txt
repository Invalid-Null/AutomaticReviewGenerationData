[1] "Alumina-supported PtSn catalysts are commercially used for propane (C3H8) dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene (C3H6)."

[2] "The optimized geometries of all γ-alumina-supported PtxSny cluster models are shown in Figure 1."

[3] "Figure 4 shows the dehydrogenation activation free energies and microkinetic PDH turnover frequencies (TOFs) as a function of Ptx cluster size for all PtxSny cluster models."

[1] "To that end, we undertook a comprehensive investigation of PDH on PtxSny (x, y ≤ 4) clusters on γ-Al2O3(110) and developed Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) relationships." 

[2] "Interestingly, the PDH TOF is very sensitive to the cluster size; it varies by nearly five orders of magnitude over the range of nuclearity values x = 1-4."

[3] "The TOF trend with nuclearity differs from that with the energy barriers. A volcano-type picture emerges showing that Pt2 is very active and Pt3 is roughly an order of magnitude less so, whereas by comparison Pt1 and Pt4 are significantly less active, by about 5 orders of magnitude relative to Pt2."

6. Yes, the literature investigates how properties like cluster size affect the performance of supported Pt catalysts. It finds a volcano-type relationship between turnover frequency and cluster size, with Pt2 being the most active. Larger clusters have lower activity due to higher dehydrogenation barriers.

6. 是的,该文献研究了类似簇大小等性质如何影响负载Pt催化剂的性能。它发现周转数与簇大小之间存在火山式关系,Pt2活性最高。更大的簇由于脱氢障碍更高,活性较低。

[1] "Figure 3 presents the free energy profiles for C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 on Ptx (x = 1-4), Pt1Sny (y = 0, 1), Pt2Sny (y = 0-2), and Pt3Sny (y = 0, 1)."

[2] "Figure 9 shows the free energy profiles for further dehydrogenation of C3H6 to C3H4 on Pt1, Pt2, and Pt2Sn1." 

[3] "A microkinetic analysis of an extended reaction network was conducted to probe selectivity for C3H6."
