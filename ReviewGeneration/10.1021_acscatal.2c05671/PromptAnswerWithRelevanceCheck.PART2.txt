</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "In this work, we investigated the effects of cluster size and Sn content on cluster stability and PDH on PtxSny (x, y ≤ 4) clusters supported on γ-Al2O3(110)."

[2] "When two Sn atoms are added to Pt2, the most stable Pt2Sn2 structure has four PtSn bonds, all less than 3 Å long." 

[3] "Addition of Sn to Ptx (x = 13) increases the first dehydrogenation barrier. The pattern that transpires is that the effect of a single Sn atom on increasing the activation energy is diminished as the size of Ptx grows."

[4] "The trend of decreasing activity with Sn content is consistent with the increased barriers shown in Figure 3."

[5] "High dehydrogenation barriers and low TOFs on Pt1Sn1 and Pt2Sn2 suggest that a Pt/Sn ratio of 1:1 results in inactivity. When there is an excess of Pt atoms relative to Sn in PtxSny (e.g., Pt2Sn1 and Pt3Sn1), moderate TOF values were observed." 

[6] "Furthermore, Pt1 promotes slight deep C3H6 conversion to cracked products, while Pt2 and Pt2Sn1 maintain high selectivity to C3H6."

<English version answer>
2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It investigates the effects of Pt cluster size and Sn content on the stability, activity, and selectivity of supported Pt-Sn clusters. The article provides data on the geometry, stability, and catalytic performance of different Pt-Sn clusters supported on alumina. Key insights include:
- Adding Sn strengthens Pt-Sn bonds and improves Pt cluster stability. 
- Increasing Sn content generally decreases Pt activity for dehydrogenation due to higher barriers.
- A Pt/Sn ratio around 3:1 maintains moderate activity with improved stability.
- Pt-Sn clusters suppress propene hydrogenolysis, maintaining high propene selectivity.

2. 是的,这篇文章评估了Pt-Sn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它研究了Pt簇大小和Sn含量对受支持Pt-Sn簇稳定性、活性和选择性的影响。文章提供了不同Pt-Sn簇在氧化铝支持物上的几何形状、稳定性和催化性能的数据。关键见解包括:
- 添加Sn加强了Pt-Sn键合,提高了Pt簇的稳定性。  
- 增加Sn含量通常会由于能垒升高而降低Pt的脱氢活性。
- Pt/Sn比约为3:1可以保持适度的活性和提高的稳定性。  
- Pt-Sn簇抑制丙烯氢裂,保持高的丙烯选择性。

<quotes>
[1] "In this work, we investigated the effects of cluster size and Sn content on cluster stability and PDH on PtxSny (x, y ≤ 4) clusters supported on γ-Al2O3(110)."

[2] "To that end, we undertook a comprehensive investigation of PDH on PtxSny (x, y ≤ 4) clusters on γ-Al2O3(110) and developed Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) relationships."

[3] "When two Sn atoms are added to Pt2, the most stable Pt2Sn2 structure has four PtSn bonds, all less than 3 Å long." 

[4] "Addition of Sn to Ptx clusters stabilizes Pt on the surface and the stabilization is especially prominent for a Pt/Sn ratio of 1:1; such clusters have ΔbEPtx in the range of 5 eV, namely, close to the Pt atom cohesion energy in bulk Pt."

[5] "The activity of the PtxSny clusters is predicted to decrease in the order Pt1 > Pt1Sn1, Pt2 > Pt2Sn1 > Pt2Sn2, and Pt3 > Pt3Sn1."

[6] "High dehydrogenation barriers and low TOFs on Pt1Sn1 and Pt2Sn2 suggest that a Pt/Sn ratio of 1:1 results in inactivity."

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn alloy nanoclusters supported on alumina for propane dehydrogenation. It investigates the effects of cluster size and Sn content on activity and stability. Key findings are that Sn addition stabilizes Pt clusters, Pt2 shows the highest activity among monometallic clusters, and a Pt/Sn ratio around 3 gives better activity than 1/1 which leads to inactivity.
