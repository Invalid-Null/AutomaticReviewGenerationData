[1] "Supported PtSn tuned particle sizes have been synthesized on various supports. (39)"

[2] "Experimental and theoretical studies have been performed to understand the electronic and structural properties of PtSn and its catalytic properties, such as activity, selectivity, and coke formation. (1012)"

[3] "In this work, we investigated the effects of cluster size and Sn content on cluster stability and PDH on PtxSny (x, y ≤ 4) clusters supported on γ-Al2O3(110)."

[4] "Periodic DFT calculations were performed in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP), (28,29) using plane-wave basis sets with an energy cutoff of 400 eV." 

[5] "The geometry optimization convergence criterion was set at 0.02 eV for all structures of intermediates and transition states."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article evaluates supported Pt and PtSn nanoclusters for propane dehydrogenation using DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling. It studies the effects of cluster size and Sn content on Pt and PtSn nanoclusters supported on alumina. The calculations are performed using DFT methods like VASP with parameters specified. Intermediates and transition states are optimized, and microkinetic modeling is done with CHEMKIN.

[1] "The stability of Pt clusters increases with increasing nuclearity. The addition of Sn also stabilizes Pt clusters due to the strong PtSn interaction." 

[2] "It is also favorable for Ptx clusters to bind with PtxSn1 clusters and form larger PtxSn1 clusters."

[3] "Although the dehydrogenation energy barriers increase with increasing Ptx cluster size, the reactivity is strongly dependent on the stability of surface species."

[4] "Consequently, the activity exhibits a volcano curve with nuclearity, maximized for Pt2 whose activity is significantly high (a magic cluster-like behavior)." 

[5] "For Ptx (x > 1), the reactivity decreases with increasing cluster size, correlating with the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."

[6] "The introduction of Sn lowers the reactivity of Pt, as has been reported in previous work. Increasing the Sn content leads to even lower reactivity."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article shows that Pt cluster stability and reactivity for propane dehydrogenation are strongly dependent on cluster size and Sn content. Larger Pt clusters and addition of Sn improve stability but can lower reactivity. A volcano-shaped activity trend is seen with maximum for Pt2. Increasing Sn further lowers activity. These trends correlate with calculated dehydrogenation barriers and stability of intermediates.

Answer: 该文表明Pt簇的稳定性和丙烷脱氢反应活性高度依赖于集聚大小和Sn含量。更大的Pt簇和添加Sn提高了稳定性但会降低反应活性。以Pt2为最大值的火山形活性趋势被观察到。增加Sn进一步降低活性。这些趋势与计算的脱氢壁垒和中间体的稳定性相关。

[1] "Figure 3 presents the free energy profiles for C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 on Ptx (x = 14), Pt1Sny (y = 0, 1), Pt2Sny (y = 02), and Pt3Sny (y = 0, 1)."

[2] "On Pt1 and Pt2, we see stable surface catalyst states, with formation energies of 1.01 and 0.57 eV, that could be responsible for high surface coverages and, thus, few available Pt-free sites for reaction." 

[3] "Figure 6 shows the coverages of major surface states on Ptx and PtxSny clusters." 

[4] "We see the hydrogen coverage of Pt1 is over 99.9%, which is essentially the reason Pt1 is so much less active than Pt2 even though it presents the lowest dehydrogenation barriers among all the clusters tested here."

[5] "On Pt2, there are about 2% empty Pt sites available for propane activation. The moderate amount of available Pt sites and small dehydrogenation barriers contribute to its high activity."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes detailed mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the studied Pt and PtSn nanoclusters. It calculates and analyzes the free energy profiles, identifies stable intermediates, and determines surface coverages. The availability of empty Pt sites and dehydrogenation barriers are found to be key factors affecting activity differences between clusters.
