[1] "The PDH process was simulated using a plug flow reactor at 848 K."
[2] "Periodic DFT calculations were performed in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP), using plane-wave basis sets with an energy cutoff of 400 eV." 
[3] "The Ptx activity changes nonmonotonically with cluster size."
[4] "DFT studies on crystalline Pt3Sn1, Pt2Sn1, and Pt1Sn2 extended surfaces have suggested that Sn slows down the C3H8 CH activation and facilitates C3H6 desorption."

5. The article describes how DFT calculations have been applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways. Specifically, it mentions using DFT to model PDH in a plug flow reactor at 848 K, using the VASP software with plane wave basis sets. DFT results revealed nonmonotonic trends between Ptx cluster size and activity, and suggested Sn atoms slow C3H8 activation while improving C3H6 desorption.

[1] "Figure 4 shows the dehydrogenation activation free energies and microkinetic PDH turnover frequencies (TOFs) as a function of Ptx cluster size for all PtxSny cluster models."
[2] "The PDH TOF is very sensitive to the cluster size; it varies by nearly five orders of magnitude over the range of nuclearity values x = 1-4."  
[3] "Figure 7 shows the microkinetic degree of rate control (DRC) of intermediates, products, and transition states."

6. The article presents microkinetic modeling results that provided insights into propane dehydrogenation kinetics. Specifically, it shows turnover frequencies, activation energies, and degree of rate control analyses as a function of cluster size. The modeling revealed TOFs varying by five orders of magnitude with nuclearity and the rate being influenced by multiple elementary steps.
