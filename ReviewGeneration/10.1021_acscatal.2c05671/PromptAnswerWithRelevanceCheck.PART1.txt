<quotes>

[1] "In this work, we investigated the effects of cluster size and Sn content on cluster stability and PDH on PtxSny (x, y ≤ 4) clusters supported on γ-Al2O3(110)."

[2] "When two Sn atoms are added to Pt2, the most stable Pt2Sn2 structure has four PtSn bonds, all less than 3 Å long."  

[3] "The PtPt bond lengths in Pt and PtSn clusters are similar to the bond lengths in crystalline Pt, whose PtPt distance is 2.79 Å."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It studies the effects of Pt cluster size and Sn doping on the activity and stability of PtxSny nanoclusters supported on alumina for this reaction. The article provides detailed computational data on the geometries, stabilities, and catalytic performance of different sized Pt and PtSn clusters on alumina. It shows how Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn bond lengths in the clusters compare to bulk metals.

</English version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "The stability of Pt clusters increases with increasing nuclearity." 

[2] "Although the dehydrogenation energy barriers increase with increasing Ptx cluster size, the reactivity is strongly dependent on the stability of surface species."

[3] "A volcano-like activity-nuclearity relation is found, with Pt2 being the most active cluster."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like Pt cluster size affect the performance of the supported Pt catalysts. It shows that increasing Pt cluster size improves stability but also increases dehydrogenation barriers. A volcano-like trend is found where the dimer Pt2 nanocluster has the optimal size for propane dehydrogenation activity, as it balances stability and kinetic barriers. Larger Pt clusters are less active.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

答:是的,这篇文章研究了Pt簇大小等属性如何影响受支持Pt催化剂的性能。它显示Pt簇大小的增加提高了稳定性,但也增加了脱氢屏障。发现了类似火山曲线的趋势,二聚体Pt2纳米簇具有最佳的丙烷脱氢活性大小,因为它在稳定性和动力学屏障之间达到了平衡。较大的Pt簇活性较低。

</Chinese version answer>

[2] "As shown in Figure 3a, both the CH activation and the ensuing β-H elimination face increasingly higher barriers with increasing Ptx cluster size."

[3] "Figure 4 shows the dehydrogenation activation free energies and microkinetic PDH turnover frequencies (TOFs) as a function of Ptx cluster size for all PtxSny cluster models." 

</quotes>

<English version answer>

It calculates the free energy profiles for key dehydrogenation steps like CH activation and β-H elimination over different sized Pt and PtSn clusters. It also performs microkinetic modeling to determine turnover frequencies and probe the effects of nuclearity on the PDH mechanism. The calculations reveal how increasing Pt cluster size raises dehydrogenation barriers but also show more complex volcano-like activity trends.

[1] "To that end, we undertook a comprehensive investigation of PDH on PtxSny (x, y ≤ 4) clusters on γ-Al2O3(110) and developed Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) relationships." 

[2] "Interestingly, the PDH TOF is very sensitive to the cluster size; it varies by nearly five orders of magnitude over the range of nuclearity values x = 1-4."

[3] "The TOF trend with nuclearity differs from that with the energy barriers. A volcano-type picture emerges showing that Pt2 is very active and Pt3 is roughly an order of magnitude less so, whereas by comparison Pt1 and Pt4 are significantly less active, by about 5 orders of magnitude relative to Pt2."

<English version answer>
6. Yes, the literature investigates how properties like cluster size affect the performance of supported Pt catalysts. It finds a volcano-type relationship between turnover frequency and cluster size, with Pt2 being the most active. Larger clusters have lower activity due to higher dehydrogenation barriers.

Answer: The article shows that Pt cluster stability and reactivity for propane dehydrogenation are strongly dependent on cluster size and Sn content.

These trends correlate with calculated dehydrogenation barriers and stability of intermediates.

[3] "Figure 6 shows the coverages of major surface states on Ptx and PtxSny clusters." 

[4] "We see the hydrogen coverage of Pt1 is over 99.9%, which is essentially the reason Pt1 is so much less active than Pt2 even though it presents the lowest dehydrogenation barriers among all the clusters tested here."

[5] "On Pt2, there are about 2% empty Pt sites available for propane activation. The moderate amount of available Pt sites and small dehydrogenation barriers contribute to its high activity."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes detailed mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the studied Pt and PtSn nanoclusters. It calculates and analyzes the free energy profiles, identifies stable intermediates, and determines surface coverages. The availability of empty Pt sites and dehydrogenation barriers are found to be key factors affecting activity differences between clusters.
