 Unfortunately this article does not compare the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The article focuses solely on investigating bimetallic Pt-Sn nanoclusters supported on alumina for propane dehydrogenation.

[1] "In this work, we investigated the effects of cluster size and Sn content on cluster stability and PDH on PtxSny (x, y ≤ 4) clusters supported on γ-Al2O3(110)."

[2] "To that end, we undertook a comprehensive investigation of PDH on PtxSny (x, y ≤ 4) clusters on γ-Al2O3(110) and developed Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) relationships."

[3] "When two Sn atoms are added to Pt2, the most stable Pt2Sn2 structure has four PtSn bonds, all less than 3 Å long." 

[4] "Addition of Sn to Ptx clusters stabilizes Pt on the surface and the stabilization is especially prominent for a Pt/Sn ratio of 1:1; such clusters have ΔbEPtx in the range of 5 eV, namely, close to the Pt atom cohesion energy in bulk Pt."

[5] "The activity of the PtxSny clusters is predicted to decrease in the order Pt1 > Pt1Sn1, Pt2 > Pt2Sn1 > Pt2Sn2, and Pt3 > Pt3Sn1."

[6] "High dehydrogenation barriers and low TOFs on Pt1Sn1 and Pt2Sn2 suggest that a Pt/Sn ratio of 1:1 results in inactivity."

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn alloy nanoclusters supported on alumina for propane dehydrogenation. It investigates the effects of cluster size and Sn content on activity and stability. Key findings are that Sn addition stabilizes Pt clusters, Pt2 shows the highest activity among monometallic clusters, and a Pt/Sn ratio around 3 gives better activity than 1/1 which leads to inactivity.

2. 是的,该文献评估了氧化铝支持的Pt-Sn合金纳米簇用于丙烷脱氢反应。它研究了簇大小和Sn含量对活性和稳定性的影响。主要发现是Sn的添加稳定了Pt簇,Pt2显示出单金属簇中最高的活性,Pt/Sn比例为3左右比1/1提供更好的活性,而1/1则导致无活性。
