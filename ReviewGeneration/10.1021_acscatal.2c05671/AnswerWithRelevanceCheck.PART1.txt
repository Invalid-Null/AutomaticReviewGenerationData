      [1] "In this work, we investigated the effects of cluster size and Sn content on cluster stability and PDH on PtxSny (x, y ≤ 4) clusters supported on γ-Al2O3(110)."

      [2] "Although the dehydrogenation energy barriers increase with increasing Ptx cluster size, the reactivity is strongly dependent on the stability of surface species."

      [3] "The activity exhibits a volcano curve with nuclearity, maximized for Pt2 whose activity is significantly high (a magic cluster-like behavior)."

      [4] "For Ptx (x > 1), the reactivity decreases with increasing cluster size, correlating with the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."

      [5] "The introduction of Sn lowers the reactivity of Pt, as has been reported in previous work. Increasing the Sn content leads to even lower reactivity."
    </Quotes>
    <English>
      Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It studies the effect of Pt cluster size on stability and activity, finding a volcano-shaped relationship with Pt2 being the most active. It also shows Sn addition lowers Pt activity.
    </English>
    <Chinese>
      是的,该文评估了单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它研究了Pt簇大小对稳定性和活性的影响,发现活性与Pt核数呈现火山关系,Pt2活性最高。它还表明添加Sn会降低Pt的活性。

      [1] "In this work, we investigated the effects of cluster size and Sn content on cluster stability and PDH on PtxSny (x, y ≤ 4) clusters supported on γ-Al2O3(110)."

      [2] "The stability of Pt clusters increases with increasing nuclearity. The addition of Sn also stabilizes Pt clusters due to the strong PtSn interaction."

      [3] "Although the dehydrogenation energy barriers increase with increasing Ptx cluster size, the reactivity is strongly dependent on the stability of surface species."

      [4] "For Ptx (x > 1), the reactivity decreases with increasing cluster size, correlating with the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."

    </Quotes>
    <English>
      Yes, the article investigates how properties like Pt cluster size, Sn addition, and metal-support interactions affect propane dehydrogenation. It shows increasing size and Sn content reduce activity by increasing barriers and reducing intermediate stability. Sn addition enhances stability.
    </English>
    <Chinese>
      是的,该文探讨了Pt簇大小、添加Sn以及金属支撑相互作用等性质对丙烷脱氢的影响。它表明尺寸增加和Sn含量增加会通过提高能垒和降低中间体稳定性来降低活性。添加Sn可以增强稳定性。

      [1] "Figure 3 presents the free energy profiles for C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 on Ptx (x = 1-4), Pt1Sny (y = 0, 1), Pt2Sny (y = 0-2), and Pt3Sny (y = 0, 1)."

      [2] "Scheme 1 presents pathways for the skeleton PDH network to C3H6. We augment it with C3H6 dehydrogenation to C3H4; CC cleavage in C3H6 to CH2* and CHCH3*; and CC cleavage in C3H4 to CH* and CCH3* surface species."

      [3] "Figure 9 shows the free energy profiles for further dehydrogenation of C3H6 to C3H4 on Pt1, Pt2, and Pt2Sn1."

      [4] "Figure 10 shows the free energy barriers of CC cleavage of C3H6 and C3H4 on Pt1, Pt2, and Pt2Sn1 clusters."
