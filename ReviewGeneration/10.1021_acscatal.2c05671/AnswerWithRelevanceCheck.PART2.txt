         [1] "In this work, we investigated the effects of cluster size and Sn content on cluster stability and PDH on PtxSny (x, y ≤ 4) clusters supported on γ-Al2O3(110)." 
         [2] "When two Sn atoms are added to Pt2, the most stable Pt2Sn2 structure has four PtSn bonds, all less than 3 Å long."  
         [3] "Addition of Sn to Ptx (x = 13) increases the first dehydrogenation barrier. The pattern that transpires is that the effect of a single Sn atom on increasing the activation energy is diminished as the size of Ptx grows."
         [4] "The trend of decreasing activity with Sn content is consistent with the increased barriers shown in Figure 3."
         [5] "High dehydrogenation barriers and low TOFs on Pt1Sn1 and Pt2Sn2 suggest that a Pt/Sn ratio of 1:1 results in inactivity. When there is an excess of Pt atoms relative to Sn in PtxSny (e.g., Pt2Sn1 and Pt3Sn1), moderate TOF values were observed."
         [6] "Furthermore, Pt1 promotes slight deep C3H6 conversion to cracked products, while Pt2 and Pt2Sn1 maintain high selectivity to C3H6."

         Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn alloy clusters supported on alumina for propane dehydrogenation. It investigates the effects of cluster size and Sn content on activity, selectivity, and stability. Key findings are that Sn addition improves Pt cluster stability, increasing Sn content decreases activity, a Pt/Sn ratio around 3:1 maintains moderate activity with selectivity, and 1:1 Pt/Sn leads to inactivity.

         是的,该文献评估了氧化铝载体上的Pt-Sn合金簇用于丙烷脱氢反应。它研究了簇大小和Sn含量对活性、选择性和稳定性的影响。主要发现是Sn的添加改善了Pt簇的稳定性,Sn含量的增加会降低活性,Pt/Sn比约为3:1可保持适度的活性和选择性,而1:1的Pt/Sn会导致无活性。

         [1] "The strong SnO bonds are consistent with the experimentally observed strong binding of PtSn nanoparticles with alumina, with Sn residing at the Ptsupport interface forming species." 
         [2] "Addition of Sn to Pt1, forming Pt1Sn1, Sn binds with the surface atoms O1 and O2, with the SnO bonds being 2.62 Å long."
         [3] "Similar stabilization effect of Sn on Pt clusters was also demonstrated for Pt4Sn3 clusters on silica and alumina."

         The article investigates the electronic and geometric effects of Sn as a secondary metal in PtSn bimetallic clusters. It shows Sn forms strong bonds with Al2O3 support oxygens at the cluster-support interface and exhibits a stabilization effect on the Pt clusters.
