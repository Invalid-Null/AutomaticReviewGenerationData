[1] "effects of support and CO2 on PDH over VOx-based catalysts were systematically studied"

[2] "the activities of VOx vary significantly with oxide supports, among which the activity of VOx/ZrO2 is over 4 times higher than that of other samples." 

[3] "The bridge oxygen in VO site was found to play critical roles in activation propane under reductive condition, the weaker VOxsupport interactions result in lower electron density of bridge oxygen and thus contributing to higher CH bond rupture capability as that of VOx/ZrO2."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of vanadium oxide catalysts affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It finds that the activity of VOx varies significantly with different oxide supports, with VOx/ZrO2 being the most active. This is attributed to the weaker VOx-ZrO2 interactions resulting in lower electron density of the bridge oxygen, which contributes to higher CH bond rupture capability.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文研究了调节钒氧化物催化剂的氧化态、氧原子迁移能力以及酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。结果发现,不同氧化物载体支持的VOx活性存在显著差异,其中VOx/ZrO2活性最高。这是由于VOx与ZrO2间较弱的相互作用导致桥氧电子密度降低,从而提高了碳氢键断裂能力。

[1] "the heterotic mechanism that the hydrocarbon intermediates (HCs) and H atom tend to be stabilized atop partly reduced V and bridge O, respectively"

[2] "Propene formation over metal oxide catalysts can be described by two consecutive dehydrogenation steps (9,51,75)the CH bond activation of propane and the following propene formation from isopropyl."

[3] "Because the one-step OPDH process proceeds on VO bonds with reducible lattice O atoms, while unreducible lattice O atoms on VO bonds are involved in the direct PDH reaction."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied VOx catalysts. It describes a heterolytic mechanism where hydrocarbon intermediates and H atoms are stabilized on partially reduced V sites and bridge O sites respectively. It also describes a two-step pathway involving CH bond activation of propane followed by propene formation from isopropyl. The article distinguishes between a one-step OPDH pathway on reducible lattice O and a direct PDH pathway on unreducible lattice O atoms.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文提出了钒氧化物催化剂脱氢丙烷的机理假设。文中描述了一个异裂机理,碳氢中间体和氢原子分别稳定在部分还原的V位点和桥氧位点上。还描述了一个两步路径,首先激活丙烷的碳氢键,然后从异丙基生成丙烯。文章区分了一步氧化脱氢发生在可还原的 VO键上的氧原子,和直接脱氢发生在不可还原的VO键上的氧原子。
