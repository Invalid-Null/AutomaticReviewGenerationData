[1] "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are promising candidates for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) with and without CO2 introduction."

[2] "Under propane direct dehydrogenation conditions, partly reduced V3+Ox/V4+Ox species have been identified as active sites for PDH without oxygen introduction."

[3] "The experiments and established scaling relationships based on density functional theory calculations reveal that the chemical states of bridge oxygen in the VO bond play critical roles in propane activation under the reductive condition, and the weaker VOxsupport interactions result in lower electron density of bridge oxygen and thus contributing to higher CH bond rupture capability as that of VOx/ZrO2."

[4] "The kinetic study and established scaling relationships reveals that the CO2 would facilitate propane activation by re-oxidization of VOx with more active lattice oxygen."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that partly reduced V3+/V4+ species are the active sites, and that the chemical states of bridge oxygen in the VO bond play critical roles in activating the CH bond of propane. Weaker VOx-support interactions lead to lower electron density on bridge oxygen, enhancing its capability to rupture the CH bond. CO2 facilitates propane activation by re-oxidizing VOx to create more active lattice oxygen species.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,这篇文章探究了调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧原子迁移性以及酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它指出,V3+/V4+部分还原态是活性中心,VO键中的桥氧原子的化学态在激活丙烷的CH键方面起关键作用。较弱的VOx-载体相互作用导致桥氧上的电子密度降低,增强了其断裂CH键的能力。CO2通过再氧化VOx产生更多活性的晶格氧原子促进了丙烷的激活。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "Because direct PDH reaction is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction which requires high temperatures to obtain industrially interested per-pass conversions. Besides high energy consumption, these harsh reaction conditions would lead to heavy coking and sintering of active sites." 

[2] "The experiments were conducted at 550 C to obtain a relatively low level of propane conversion of below 10% to calculate the intrinsic activity of these catalysts."

[3] "It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is the most active one with TOFpropane 4 times higher than that of VOx/TiO2, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/Al2O3, and 16 times higher than that of VOx/MgO."

[4] "The kinetic study and established scaling relationships reveals that the CO2 would facilitate propane activation by re-oxidization of VOx with more active lattice oxygen. On the other hand, whether promotional effects of CO2 on catalysts activity could be observed experimentally or not relate closely to the coking behaviors of catalysts because the H2 lean conditions caused by CO2 would lead to faster deactivation of catalysts with higher VOx polymerization degree and stronger support acidity."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied VOx catalysts. It notes that high temperature is needed to overcome thermodynamic limitations, but causes coking and sintering. Intrinsic activity was measured at 550°C and 10% conversion. VOx/ZrO2 was the most active, attributed to the chemical states of oxygen atoms. CO2 facilitates propane activation by creating more active lattice oxygen to oxidize VOx, but its promotional effects depend on avoiding accelerated coking caused by CO2.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,这篇文章提出了在所研究的VOx催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢的机理场景。它指出需要高温来克服热力学限制,但会导致焦炭和烧结。在550°C和10%转化率下测量了固有活性。VOx/ZrO2活性最高,归因于氧原子的化学态。CO2通过产生更多活性的晶格氧原子氧化VOx来促进丙烷的激活,但是其促进效应取决于避免CO2导致的加速焦炭。

<quotes>
[1] "The effects of support and CO2 on PDH over VOx-based catalysts were systematically investigated by a combination of experiments and theoretical calculations."

[2] "It was found that the activities of VOx vary significantly with oxide supports, among which the activity of VOx/ZrO2 is over 4 times higher than that of other samples." 

[3] "The experiments and established scaling relationships based on density functional theory calculations reveal that the chemical states of bridge oxygen in the VO bond play critical roles in propane activation under the reductive condition, and the weaker VOxsupport interactions result in lower electron density of bridge oxygen and thus contributing to higher CH bond rupture capability as that of VOx/ZrO2."

[4] "The basic principles established in the present study will help to further tune the micro-environment of the VO active site for high-performance PDH and CO2-PDH reactions."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in VOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It systematically investigates the effects of different oxide supports on PDH activity over VOx catalysts, finding VOx/ZrO2 to be 4 times more active. DFT calculations reveal this is due to weaker VOx-ZrO2 interactions leading to lower electron density on bridge oxygen atoms, enhancing their capability to rupture C-H bonds in propane. The principles established aim to help tune the VO active site microenvironment.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 
答:是的,这篇文章探究了VOx催化剂中金属-载体界面效应对丙烷脱氢的影响。它系统地研究了不同氧化物载体对VOx催化剂PDH活性的影响,发现VOx/ZrO2的活性是其他催化剂的4倍。DFT计算揭示这是由于VOx-ZrO2相互作用较弱,导致桥氧原子上的电子密度降低,增强了断裂丙烷中C-H键的能力。所建立的原理旨在帮助调节VO活性中心的微环境。

[1] "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are promising candidates for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) with and without CO2 introduction."

[2] "The activity of VOx was found to vary significantly with oxide supports, among which the activity of ZrO2-supported VOx is 4 times higher than that of other samples, which can serve as highly active and stable catalysts at a H2/C3H8 ratio of 0.5." 

[3] "The experiments and established scaling relationships based on density functional theory calculations reveal that the chemical states of bridge oxygen in the VO bond play critical roles in propane activation under the reductive condition, and the weaker VOxsupport interactions result in lower electron density of bridge oxygen and thus contributing to higher CH bond rupture capability as that of VOx/ZrO2."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of vanadium oxide catalysts affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It finds that the activity of vanadium oxide varies significantly depending on the oxide support, with ZrO2-supported vanadium oxide being 4 times more active than other samples. DFT calculations reveal that the chemical states of bridge oxygen atoms in the VO bonds play critical roles in propane activation under reducing conditions. Weaker vanadium oxide-support interactions result in lower electron density around the bridge oxygen, enabling higher CH bond rupture capability as seen for VOx/ZrO2.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:该文研究了调控氧化钒催化剂的氧化态、氧的迁移性以及酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢反应性能。结果发现,不同的氧化物载体对氧化钒的活性有明显影响,其中ZrO2支持的氧化钒活性是其他样品的4倍。DFT计算揭示了VO键中的桥氧原子的化学状态在还原条件下对丙烷活化起关键作用。较弱的氧化钒与载体的相互作用导致桥氧上的电子密度降低,提高了CH键断裂能力,就像VOx/ZrO2那样。

[1] "PDH over the bulk V2O5 surface was first conducted to illustrate the effects of V oxidation states on their intrinsic PDH activities." 

[2] "The removal of VO terminal oxygen atoms in mono-layer V2O5(001) results in a clear decrease in V oxidation statesthe average Bader charge of corresponding V atom decreases from +2.088 to +1.799 e."

[3] "As a result, as shown in Figure 8a, the CH bond activation energy of C3H8 over partly reduced mono-layer V2O5(001) is 0.71 eV lower than that of di-layer V2O5(001) (1.30 vs 2.10 eV), in agreement with the literature that partly reduced VOx species are active sites under non-oxidative atmospheres."

[4] "The reaction energy profiles and transition states for propane activation over supported VOx are shown in Figure 8b,c. The direct dehydrogenation of alkanes over metaloxygen pairs were found more likely following the heterotic mechanism that the hydrocarbon intermediates (HCs) and H atom tend to be stabilized atop partly reduced V and bridge O, respectively."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over vanadium oxide catalysts. It shows via DFT calculations that partial reduction of V atoms in monolayer V2O5(001) lowers the CH bond activation energy of propane versus bilayer V2O5(001), confirming that partially reduced VOx species are the active sites under non-oxidative conditions. The proposed mechanism involves direct dehydrogenation following a heterolytic pathway, where hydrocarbon intermediates and H atoms are stabilized atop partially reduced V sites and bridge O atoms, respectively. Transition states and energy profiles are calculated for propane activation over supported VOx models.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 
答:该文通过DFT计算提出了氧化钒催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机理场景。计算显示,V2O5(001)单层面上的V原子部分还原可降低丙烷的CH键活化能,而双层V2O5(001)则不可,这证实了非氧化条件下部分还原的VOx物种是活性中心。提出的机理涉及直接脱氢,游离碳氢中间体和H原子分别稳定在部分还原的V位点和桥氧原子上,属杂裂机理。文中计算了支持在VOx模型上的丙烷活化的过渡态和能量曲线。

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It systematically studies how the support affects the activity of VOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It finds that VOx/ZrO2 is the most active, over 4 times more active than VOx on other supports studied.

It systematically studies how different oxide supports affect the activity of supported VOx catalysts. It finds VOx/ZrO2 is much more active than VOx on other supports, and reveals through DFT calculations that this is due to the weaker VOx-ZrO2 interaction resulting in lower electron density on the bridge oxygen and higher propane CH bond cleavage activity.

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It finds that ZrO2-supported VOx shows much higher intrinsic activity than VOx supported on other oxides like Al2O3 and SiO2. DFT calculations reveal the VO-Zr bond polarizes the bridge oxygen more than VO-Al and VO-Si bonds, making it more electrophilic and lowering the propane CH bond activation energy. The nature of the support also influences VOx reducibility, creating more active V3+/V4+ sites.

[1] "In mechanistic aspects, Ascoop and colleagues studied the dynamic behavior of WOxVOx/SiO2 by cofeeding D2 with C3H8 and CO2 and found that about 45% of water contains D2O, revealing that both one-step OPDH pathway and direct PDH followed by consecutive RWGS reaction routes (two-step) are involved in propane activation." 

[2] "Because the one-step OPDH process proceeds on VO bonds with reducible lattice O atoms, while unreducible lattice O atoms on VO bonds are involved in the direct PDH reaction."

[1] "the heterotic mechanism that the hydrocarbon intermediates (HCs) and H atom tend to be stabilized atop partly reduced V and bridge O, respectively"

[2] "Propene formation over metal oxide catalysts can be described by two consecutive dehydrogenation steps (9,51,75)the CH bond activation of propane and the following propene formation from isopropyl."

[3] "Because the one-step OPDH process proceeds on VO bonds with reducible lattice O atoms, while unreducible lattice O atoms on VO bonds are involved in the direct PDH reaction."

Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied VOx catalysts. It describes a heterolytic mechanism where hydrocarbon intermediates and H atoms are stabilized on partially reduced V sites and bridge O sites respectively. It also describes a two-step pathway involving CH bond activation of propane followed by propene formation from isopropyl. The article distinguishes between a one-step OPDH pathway on reducible lattice O and a direct PDH pathway on unreducible lattice O atoms.

答:是的,本文提出了钒氧化物催化剂脱氢丙烷的机理假设。文中描述了一个异裂机理,碳氢中间体和氢原子分别稳定在部分还原的V位点和桥氧位点上。还描述了一个两步路径,首先激活丙烷的碳氢键,然后从异丙基生成丙烯。文章区分了一步氧化脱氢发生在可还原的 VO键上的氧原子,和直接脱氢发生在不可还原的VO键上的氧原子。
