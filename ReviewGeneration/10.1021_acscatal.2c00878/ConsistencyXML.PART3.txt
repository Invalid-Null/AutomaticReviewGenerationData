To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key points made in each answer file's English response to the key points made in the correct answer provided. I converted both responses to simplified sentences capturing the main essence, and compared them literally. Questions with completely equivalent main points were scored as 100% consistent, while any deviations in the main points resulted in lower consistency scores.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
