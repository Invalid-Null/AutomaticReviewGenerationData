<quotes>
[1] The catalysts were prepared by a modified incipient wetness impregnation method. In a typical process, a certain concentration of NH4VO3 (99.95%, Macklin) with a fixed NH4VO3 to an oxalic acid (99.8%, Aladdin) ratio of 0.5 was added dropwise to 1 g of support oxides.

[2] These catalysts were prepared by varying V surface densities at the range of 0.57 V/nm2 for each support. 

[3] The catalyst was obtained after calcinating the dried solid at 550 C in air for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 C/min.

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes using incipient wetness impregnation with controlled NH4VO3 concentration and oxalic acid ratio to prepare vanadium oxide catalysts on various metal oxide supports. It also varies the V surface density during preparation to control dispersion. The catalysts are calcined at 550C after preparation.

[1] The X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were carried out at BL14W1 beam line in the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The data of X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) were analyzed by using the Athena software.

[2] The XANES and EXAFS k2·χ(k) spectra of VOx/MgO are closely similar to that of Mg3V2O8 (Figures 1e,f and S7), (49,50) which suggests that the local surroundings of vanadium ions on MgO are similar to those of Mg3V2O8 with dominantly monomeric surface VO4 units, in accordance with the 51V MAS NMR result.

[3] The XPS spectra of pre-reduced samples (condition: 40% H2/N2, 550 C, 1.5 h) were recorded on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi equipped with an Al Kα radiation. For data analysis, the C1s binding energy 284.8 eV was taken as the internal reference.

[4] The distributions of vanadia oxidation states after reduction were estimated by XPS. As shown in Figure 6b, the XPS spectrum of the V 2p region for reduced catalysts were deconvoluted into three peaks at 515.8, 516.8 and 517.8 eV representing V5+, V4+, and V3+, respectively. (30,33,66)

Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques like XANES, EXAFS, and XPS to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It uses XANES and EXAFS to characterize the coordination environment and oxidation state of vanadium in the fresh and reduced catalysts. It also uses XPS to quantify the V5+, V4+, and V3+ species in the catalysts after H2 reduction, providing insights into the reduction extent.
