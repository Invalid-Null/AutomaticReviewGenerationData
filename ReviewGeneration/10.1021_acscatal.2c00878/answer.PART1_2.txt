[1] "In the present study, the effects of support and CO2 on PDH over VOx-based catalysts were systematically investigated by a combination of experimental and theoretical calculations."

[2] "It was found that the activities of VOx vary significantly with oxide supports, among which the activity of VOx/ZrO2 is over 4 times higher than that of other samples."

[3] "The bridge oxygen in VO site was found to play critical roles in activation propane under reductive condition, the weaker VOxsupport interactions result in lower electron density of bridge oxygen and thus contributing to higher CH bond rupture capability as that of VOx/ZrO2."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It systematically studies how the support affects the activity of VOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It finds that VOx/ZrO2 is the most active, over 4 times more active than VOx on other supports studied. It reveals through DFT calculations that the weaker interaction between VOx and the ZrO2 support results in lower electron density on the bridge oxygen, which facilitates CH bond rupture in propane activation.

答:是的,这篇文章研究了调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧原子迁移性以及酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它系统地研究了不同载体如何影响VOx催化剂的丙烷脱氢活性。它发现VOx/ZrO2的活性最高,比其他载体支持的VOx高出4倍以上。它通过DFT计算揭示了VOx与ZrO2载体之间相互作用较弱会导致桥氧上的电子密度降低,这有利于丙烷分子中的CH键断裂。

[1] "Propene formation over metal oxide catalysts can be described by two consecutive dehydrogenation steps (9,51,75)the CH bond activation of propane and the following propene formation from isopropyl." 

[2] "PDH over the bulk V2O5 surface was first conducted to illustrate the effects of V oxidation states on their intrinsic PDH activities."

[3] "It was found that propane activation on the VOZr site is most favorable with an activation energy of 1.10 eV, which is 0.15 and 0.53 eV lower than that of VOAl and VOSi active sites, respectively."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied VOx catalysts. It describes propene formation as occurring through two consecutive dehydrogenation steps - CH bond activation of propane followed by propene formation from isopropyl. It finds through DFT calculations that propane activation is most favorable on VOZr sites, with an activation energy 0.15 eV and 0.53 eV lower than on VOAl and VOSi sites, respectively.

答:是的,这篇文章提出了VOx催化剂上的丙烷脱氢反应机理。它描述丙烯形成是通过两个连续的脱氢步骤完成的——丙烷分子的CH键活化,然后从异丙基生成丙烯。它通过DFT计算发现,丙烷在VOZr位点上的活化能量最低,比VOAl和VOSi位点上的活化能量分别低0.15eV和0.53eV。

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in VOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It systematically studies how different oxide supports affect the activity of supported VOx catalysts. It finds VOx/ZrO2 is much more active than VOx on other supports, and reveals through DFT calculations that this is due to the weaker VOx-ZrO2 interaction resulting in lower electron density on the bridge oxygen and higher propane CH bond cleavage activity.

答:是的,这篇文章探索了载体对VOx催化剂丙烷脱氢性能的界面效应。它系统地研究了不同氧化物载体如何影响负载VOx催化剂的活性。它发现VOx/ZrO2的活性远高于其他载体支持的VOx,并通过DFT计算揭示这是由于VOx与ZrO2载体之间相互作用较弱,导致桥氧上的电子密度降低,使得丙烷分子CH键断裂活性增强。
