[1] "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are promising candidates for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) with and without CO2 introduction."

[2] "The activity of VOx was found to vary significantly with oxide supports, among which the activity of ZrO2-supported VOx is 4 times higher than that of other samples, which can serve as highly active and stable catalysts at a H2/C3H8 ratio of 0.5." 

[3] "The experiments and established scaling relationships based on density functional theory calculations reveal that the chemical states of bridge oxygen in the VO bond play critical roles in propane activation under the reductive condition, and the weaker VOxsupport interactions result in lower electron density of bridge oxygen and thus contributing to higher CH bond rupture capability as that of VOx/ZrO2."

[4] "The weaker VOxsupport interactions result in lower electron density of bridge oxygen and thus contributing to higher CH bond rupture capability as that of VOx/ZrO2."

Answer: The article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of vanadium oxide catalysts affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It finds that the activity of vanadium oxide varies significantly depending on the oxide support, with ZrO2-supported vanadium oxide being 4 times more active than other samples. DFT calculations reveal that the chemical states of bridge oxygen atoms in the VO bonds play critical roles in propane activation under reducing conditions. Weaker vanadium oxide-support interactions result in lower electron density around the bridge oxygen, enabling higher CH bond rupture capability as seen for VOx/ZrO2.

答:该文研究了调控氧化钒催化剂的氧化态、氧的迁移性以及酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢反应性能。结果发现,不同的氧化物载体对氧化钒的活性有明显影响,其中ZrO2支持的氧化钒活性是其他样品的4倍。DFT计算揭示了VO键中的桥氧原子的化学状态在还原条件下对丙烷活化起关键作用。较弱的氧化钒与载体的相互作用导致桥氧上的电子密度降低,提高了CH键断裂能力,就像VOx/ZrO2那样。

[1] "PDH over the bulk V2O5 surface was first conducted to illustrate the effects of V oxidation states on their intrinsic PDH activities." 

[2] "The removal of VO terminal oxygen atoms in mono-layer V2O5(001) results in a clear decrease in V oxidation statesthe average Bader charge of corresponding V atom decreases from +2.088 to +1.799 e."

[3] "As a result, as shown in Figure 8a, the CH bond activation energy of C3H8 over partly reduced mono-layer V2O5(001) is 0.71 eV lower than that of di-layer V2O5(001) (1.30 vs 2.10 eV), in agreement with the literature that partly reduced VOx species are active sites under non-oxidative atmospheres."

[4] "The reaction energy profiles and transition states for propane activation over supported VOx are shown in Figure 8b,c. The direct dehydrogenation of alkanes over metaloxygen pairs were found more likely following the heterotic mechanism that the hydrocarbon intermediates (HCs) and H atom tend to be stabilized atop partly reduced V and bridge O, respectively."

Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over vanadium oxide catalysts. It shows via DFT calculations that partial reduction of V atoms in monolayer V2O5(001) lowers the CH bond activation energy of propane versus bilayer V2O5(001), confirming that partially reduced VOx species are the active sites under non-oxidative conditions. The proposed mechanism involves direct dehydrogenation following a heterolytic pathway, where hydrocarbon intermediates and H atoms are stabilized atop partially reduced V sites and bridge O atoms, respectively. Transition states and energy profiles are calculated for propane activation over supported VOx models.

答:该文通过DFT计算提出了氧化钒催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机理场景。计算显示,V2O5(001)单层面上的V原子部分还原可降低丙烷的CH键活化能,而双层V2O5(001)则不可,这证实了非氧化条件下部分还原的VOx物种是活性中心。提出的机理涉及直接脱氢,游离碳氢中间体和H原子分别稳定在部分还原的V位点和桥氧原子上,属杂裂机理。文中计算了支持在VOx模型上的丙烷活化的过渡态和能量曲线。
