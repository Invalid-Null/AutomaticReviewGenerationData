Effects of Support and CO2 on the Performances of Vanadium Oxide-Based Catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation

Abstract
Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are promising candidates for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) with and without CO2 introduction. In the present study, the effects of support and CO2 on the intrinsic activity of VOx-based catalysts were systematically investigated by a combination of experimental and theoretical calculations. The activity of VOx was found to vary significantly with oxide supports, among which the activity of ZrO2-supported VOx is 4 times higher than that of other samples, which can serve as highly active and stable catalysts at a H2/C3H8 ratio of 0.5. The experiments and established scaling relationships based on density functional theory calculations reveal that the chemical states of bridge oxygen in the V–O bond play critical roles in propane activation under the reductive condition, and the weaker VOx–support interactions result in lower electron density of bridge oxygen and thus contributing to higher C–H bond rupture capability as that of VOx/ZrO2. Relatively lower apparent activation energies of PDH in the CO2 atmosphere were observed for all samples. However, whether the activity promotional effect of CO2 could be observed experimentally depend largely on the coking behaviors of catalysts because the H2 lean conditions caused by CO2 would lead to faster deactivation of catalysts with a higher VOx polymerization degree and stronger support acidity. The basic principles established in the present study will help to further tune the micro-environment of the V–O active site for high-performance PDH and CO2-PDH reactions.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The world demand for propene has been increasing and gradually beyond the traditional production capacity over decades of years, and at the same time, the supply of propane is growing owing to the exploration of shale gas. Under this scenario, direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene technology has drawn great attention of researchers from industry and academia world wildly. (1−3) However, direct PDH reaction is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction which requires high temperatures to obtain industrially interested per-pass conversions. Besides high energy consumption, these harsh reaction conditions would lead to heavy coking and sintering of active sites. (3,4) Therefore, catalysts owning high activity, structural stability, and coking-resistance properties are required for practical applications. Because of the high cost of commercialized Pt-based and toxic nature of CrOx-based catalysts, other transition metal oxides such as V-, Ga-, Zn-, and Fe-based catalysts have been explored in recent years for propane direct dehydrogenation. (5,6)
Among these transition metal oxides, supported VOx-based catalysts are promising candidates due to their relatively higher activities. (1,5) Traditionally, the VOx-based catalysts have been widely used in oxidation reactions, and have also been extensively studied for oxidative PDH (OPDH). (1) The OPDH was found to follow the Mars–van-Krevelen redox mechanism and the lattice oxygen in VOx species was consumed. In contrast, the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism is involved in direct PDH, and the in situ formed unreducible VOx species are active sites. (1,2,5,6) Under propane direct dehydrogenation conditions, partly reduced V3+Ox/V4+Ox species have been identified as active sites, the activity and coking behaviors of which were found to be affected by their dispersion, reduction extent, and acidity of supports. (2,4,6) However, due to limited efforts and challenges to determine the exact structure of VOx species under reaction conditions and reductive atmospheres, factors influencing the intrinsic activity of VOx in direct PDH has been poorly understood, (5,7) but which is crucial for active site manipulation to further enhance their PDH performances.
In addition, PDH coupling with CO2 reduction (CO2-PDH) has been explored to remove PDH equilibrium limitation and to expand the industrial CO2 utilization and further to help control global greenhouse gas emissions. (5,7,8) In mechanistic aspects, Ascoop and colleagues (9) studied the dynamic behavior of WOx–VOx/SiO2 by cofeeding D2 with C3H8 and CO2 and found that about 45% of water contains D2O, revealing that both one-step OPDH pathway and direct PDH followed by consecutive reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction routes (two-step) are involved in propane activation. By using operando UV Raman spectroscopy, Rogg and Hess (10) found that the VOx supported on silica could be largely re-oxidized by CO2, and be partly reduced under the reaction condition (C3H8/CO2/He) but with the relatively lower reduction extent than that in the H2 atmosphere, further confirming the occurrence of two parallel pathways. Therefore, the introduction of CO2 makes propane activation over partly reduced VOx active sites more complex involving both Mars–van-Krevelen redox mechanism and Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism.
As a consequence, contradictive results concerning the performances of VOx in CO2-PDH were often observed in the literature, and whether CO2 could promote the intrinsic activity of VOx-based catalysts or not is still obscure due to the poor understanding of critical factors influencing the intrinsic activity of VOx and also the lack of systematic and comparative investigations. (11,12) Promotional or neutral effects of CO2 to PDH activities were observed over silica- and carbon-supported VOx. (13,14) While over alumina-supported VOx, both promotional and inhibitive effects of CO2 were frequently reported. (5,11,15,16) The activity inhibition effects of CO2 were often interpreted by competing adsorption of CO2 with reactants on active sites. (15) Moreover, the activity enhancements effects of CO2 were generally explained by the shifts of dehydrogenation equilibrium, (5,11) but which still lack solid experimental pieces of evidence because most reactions were conducted far from equilibrium. Elucidating critical factors influencing the performances of VOx in the CO2 atmosphere would help the rational design of highly efficient VOx-based catalysts for CO2-PDH.
To this end, the effects of the kind of support, dispersion, and acidity of catalysts on the activity, selectivity, coking, and kinetic behaviors of VOx with and without CO2 introduction were systematically investigated and compared by loading VOx on five oxides of SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2, and MgO. In addition, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the electronic structure and reaction mechanism of catalysts were performed to gain insights into critical roles of supports and CO2. Finally, the relationships between performances and kinetic behaviors of catalysts and reaction conditions and electronic structures of active sites were established to elucidate the critical factors influencing the intrinsic activity of VOx and to understand the kinetic behaviors of VOx-based catalysts with and without CO2.

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
2.1. Catalyst Preparation
Commercial fumed SiO2, ZrO2, TiO2, and MgO (Aladdin) were dried to remove moisture before use. The γ-Al2O3 was obtained by calcinating the commercial boehmite (HC-01, Shandong Xingdu Petrochemical Technology Co. Ltd.) at 600 °C for 6 h. These catalysts were prepared by a modified incipient wetness impregnation method. In a typical process, a certain concentration of NH4VO3 (99.95%, Macklin) with a fixed NH4VO3 to an oxalic acid (99.8%, Aladdin) ratio of 0.5 was added dropwise to 1 g of support oxides. After dried overnight at an ambient temperature, the resulted solid was transferred to an oven and kept for another 6 h. Then, the catalyst was obtained after calcinating the dried solid at 550 °C in air for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 °C/min. These catalysts were denoted as VOx–support and the V surface densities were calculated based on the weight percentage of V atoms and BET surface areas of bare supports.
2.2. Catalyst Characterization
The specific surface areas, pore volume, and mesopore structures of these catalysts were determined by Kubo-X1000 (Builder Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.), and all samples were evacuated at 200 °C for 2 h before analysis. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples from 10 to 80° were obtained on an X’Pert PRO MPD diffractometer using Cu (Kα) radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA with a scanning step of 0.01°. The Raman characteristic spectra of calcinated samples were analyzed on a Bruker Senterra II spectrometer by using a 532 nm laser source. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of pre-reduced samples (condition: 40% H2/N2, 550 °C, 1.5 h) were recorded on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi equipped with an Al Kα radiation. For data analysis, the C1s binding energy 284.8 eV was taken as the internal reference. The coke contents of spent catalysts were determined through TG analysis on a Shimadzu DTG-60H thermogravimetric analyzer. The UV–vis spectra of samples were recorded at room temperature in an in-house made setup equipped with an AVASPEC UV–vis spectrometer (Avantes). Prior to the analysis, each catalyst was in situ treated at 500 °C in air for 1.5 h and then cooled to room temperature. The edge energy (Eg) was determined from the UV–vis spectra by calculating the intercept of the straight line of the plot of [F(R)hν]2 against hν, where hν is the incident photon energy, and the F(R) was obtained from the Kubelka–Munk function: F(R) = (1 – R)2/2R (R is the reflection factor). The solid-state 51V MAS NMR was carried out on a Bruker AVANCE III 600 spectrometer at a resonance frequency of 157.8 MHz using a 4 mm HX double-resonance MAS probe at a sample spinning rate of 14 kHz. The spectra were recorded by using a 0.65 μs pulse width (ca. π/6 tip angle) with a spectra window of 1 MHz and 1 s recycle delay. The chemical shift of 51V was referenced to 1 M NaVO3 aqueous solution. The X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were carried out at BL14W1 beam line in the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The data of X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) were analyzed by using the Athena software.
The temperature programmed experiment was performed on PCA-1200 (Builder) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In a typical temperature programmed desorption experiment (NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD), the sample of about 100 mg was first treated at 400 °C in He for 1 h and cooled to 100 °C for ammonia adsorption after purged in He flow (50 mL/min) for another 1 h to remove physically adsorbed NH3 or CO2; the desorption was conducted from 100 to 600 °C at 10 °C/min. For temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), 8% H2 in Ar was used. The sample was dried at 100 °C in an Ar flow for 2 h prior to analysis, and the H2 consumption signal was recorded at the range of 100–800 °C at 10 °C/min. Similarly, 8% O2 in Ar was used for temperature programmed oxidation experiments (O2-TPO), and the spent sample (about 100 mg) was pretreated in an Ar flow at 100 °C for 2 h prior to O2 signal recording at a temperature range of 100–600 °C.
2.3. Catalytic Test
A fixed-bed quartz micro-reactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm was used for catalyst test and kinetic studies. The sample of 100 mg was packed inside the central region of the reactor with a thermocouple inserted into the catalyst bed, the temperature of which can be controlled within ±0.5 °C of set point. PDH reactions were conducted at 550 °C to obtain a relatively low level of propane conversion of below 10% to calculate the intrinsic activity of these catalysts. The total flow rate was set to 30 mL/min and the WHSVpropane was 6.48 h–1. These compositions of C3H8/Ar = 5.4:24.6 and C3H8/CO2/Ar = 5.4:10.8:13.8 were used for PDH in Ar and CO2 atmospheres, respectively. For PDH in varied CO2/C3H8 and H2/C3H8 ratios, certain flow rates of Ar were replaced by CO2 or H2 to keep constant propane partial pressure of 18 kPa. The apparent activation energies of PDH reacting under Ar and CO2 atmospheres were calculated based on the activity of catalysts after reacting 10 min on stream at a temperature range of 540–600 °C with an interval of 20 °C. An on-line gas chromatograph (FULI 9790II) equipped a flame ionization detector to analyze C1–C3 hydrocarbons and a TCD to analyze COx and H2. The turnover frequency of propane (mol·s–1·molVOx–1) was calculated as

where Fpropane,inlet and Fpropane,outlet (mol·s–1) are the molar flow rate of propane from the inlet and outlet of reactor, respectively, and NVOx (molVOx) is the amount of exposed surface VOx atoms. The conversion of propane (Xpropane) and selectivity to propene (Spropene) were calculated as

2.4. DFT Calculation
DFT calculations were performed by using plane-wave basis sets on Vienna ab initio simulation package. (17−19) A plane-wave energy cutoff of 400 eV was used for tight convergence. The interactions between valence electrons and ion cores were described by the projector augmented wave method. (20) The Brillouin zone was sampled by a Monkhorst–Pack grid and integrated as follows: 2 × 3 × 1 for planes of V2O5(001), Al2O3(110), and MgO(111); 2 × 2 × 1 for plane of ZrO2(−111). A vacuum layer of 15 Å was set and a dipole correction was introduced in the Z-direction to avoid electronic interaction between two periodically repeated slabs. All the atomic geometries were optimized until the total forces on each atom were converged less than 0.03 eV/Å. The spin-polarization was included during calculation. The transition states were located through the dimer method (21) and verified by frequency calculation.
The bulk structures of γ-alumina and amorphous silica were obtained from the published literature. (22,23) The thermodynamically stable Al2O3(100) plane (11.15 × 8.40 Å2) and SiO2 surface (14.24 × 10.21 Å2) are composed of four layers of Al2O3 and SiO2, respectively. The p(2 × 2) supercell of m-ZrO2 was cut along the (−111) plane (12.23 × 14.75 Å2) with three ZrO2 layers and the p(4 × 4) of MgO was cut along the (111) plane (10.40 × 9.00 Å2) with four MgO layers. The last one or two layers of these slabs were fixed to represent the bulk oxide structure during calculation. The Si–OH group was substituted by the V═O group to construct monomeric and dimeric VOx–SiO2 models. For other oxide support, the monomeric VOx–support model was constructed by grafting one V atom atop three adjacent cations in support oxides (alumina, ZrO2, or MgO) through three V–O–support bonds, and the dimeric VOx was constructed by grafting two V atom atop five adjacent cations of oxides through four V–O–support bonds and one V–O–V bond. One oxygen in vanadyl (V═O) was removed to represent partly reduced VOx for all supported monomeric and dimeric models.
The surface oxygen vacancy formation energy was calculated as

3.1. Structure of Catalysts
Two series of VOx–support catalysts were prepared to systematically investigate the effects of support and dispersion on the performances of VOx in PDH. The first series of catalysts were prepared at low V surface densities (1.26 V/nm2 for SiO2 and around 2.0 V/nm2 for other supports) that are far below monolayer coverage (around 3.0 V/nm2 for SiO2 and 7–8 V/nm2 for other supports) (24−26) to obtain similar VOx molecular structures. The second series of catalysts were prepared by varying V surface densities at the range of 0.5–7 V/nm2 for each support. The first series catalysts were carefully characterized and profiled in Table 1 and Figures 1 and S1–S4 to identify the VOx molecular structures under investigation. As shown in Table 1, the N2 adsorption–desorption curves showed that these bare oxide support have similar mesoporous structures (Figures S1 and S2), with average pore diameters of between 15 and 35 nm. A significant decrease of surface area was observed over MgO after VOx loading, which would be caused by strong interactions between acidic VOx and base support and the formation of mixed oxide, leading to the block of mesopores. The crystal structures of as-prepared catalysts and bare supports were measured by XRD. As shown in Figures 1a and S3, the Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, MgO, and TiO2 supports are mainly composed of gamma, amorphous, monoclinic, cubic, and tetragonal phases, respectively. In addition, no vanadia and V containing mix oxides characteristic peaks can be identified for all samples, suggesting the absence of large vanadium containing species (>3 nm) on these oxides.

The molecular structures of dispersed VOx were further measured by Raman spectroscopy, which is sensitive to the presence of crystalline V2O5 regardless of measurement conditions. As shown in Figure 1b, the absence of a sharp band at 995 cm–1 characteristic of V2O5 crystals excludes the formation of bulk V2O5 on all catalysts, in accordance with XRD results. For VOx/Al2O3, the strong and broad band centered at 935 cm–1 and extending to 1030 cm–1 can be ascribed to the terminal V═O vibration of dispersed VO4 species with tetrahedral coordination. (25,27−29) The relatively strong and broad band at 720–900 cm–1 is assigned to the V–O–Al interface mode (29) and the broad bands at 450–620 cm–1 are attributed to the bridging V–O–V mode in polymerized VOx on the surface. (28−30) Therefore, the isolated and polymerized VOx species may co-exist on alumina support. For VOx/ZrO2, the strong bands below 700 cm–1 are characteristic of the monoclinic ZrO2 phase. The weak but relatively sharp band at 1003 cm–1 can be assigned to V═O bond in dispersed VOx species, and the weak broad band at 860–980 cm–1 can be assigned to V–O–Zr and V–O–V modes. (24,30) For VOx/TiO2, the strong scattering below 750 cm–1 and the weak peak at around 800 cm–1 are due to the titania substrate. The peaks attributing to VOx are showed in an enlarged signal, and the weak broad band at around 920 cm–1 can be assigned to V–O–V modes. The bands at around 985 cm–1 can be tentatively ascribed to V═O bonds which tend to shift downward under ambient conditions. (31,32) For VOx/SiO2, the band at around 1028 cm–1 is assigned to the V═O vibration of isolated VOx species. The band at 915 cm–1 can be ascribed to the vibration of V–O–Si bonds, (14,33) and the peaks at 516 and 706 cm–1 are related to hydrolyzed VOx species which would disappear under dry air at elevated temperature. (14,33−35) For VOx/MgO, the feature at 1095 cm–1 is from the carbonate species on the MgO support and the bands at 820 and 890 cm–1 can be tentatively assigned to monovanadates and low polymerized VOx domains, respectively. (31) In summary, these Raman spectra indicate the well dispersion of vanadium oxides in the form of monovanadates as well as polymerized domains on these oxide supports.
The in situ UV–vis spectroscopy was used to further clarify the structure of VOx because the edge energy derived from UV–vis spectra has been proved reliable in predicting the local structure of VOx. (29,36,37) The UV–vis spectra are recorded in Figure S4 and the Eg values are shown in Figure 1c, and the structures of surface VOx species can be assigned according to the Eg value of vanadium containing compounds. (36,38) As shown in Figure 1d and Table S1, the VOx supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, and TiO2 with Eg values of 3.43, 3.21, and 3.24 eV are highly dispersed in both isolated and small domain polymerized form with tetrahedral VO4 coordination. The Eg values of VOx/SiO2 and VOx/MgO are 3.56 and 3.92 eV, respectively, suggesting the domination of isolated VOx species on their surfaces, in agreement with results from Raman spectra and literature. (38) For the second series of catalysts, as shown in Figure S5, the Eg values of Al2O3- and ZrO2-supported VOx increase apparently with V surface densities, suggesting the polymerization degree of these VOx increase with the increase in VOx loadings, in agreement with reports in the literature. (39,40)
Additional structural information was provided by 51V MAS NMR (Figure S6) and XAS depicted in Figure 1e,f. As shown in Figure S6, a single isotropic shift is observed around −556 ppm for VOx/MgO, which is similar to the characteristic bands of Mg3V2O8, suggesting the formation of dominantly isolated VO4 species with V5+ local surroundings similar to Mg3V2O8. (41) The resonance spectrum of VOx/SiO2 shows an isotropic shift at ground −710 ppm, this signal can be attributed to a tetrahedral VO4 species with three Si–O–V linkages to the silica surface and one single V═O group according to the literature. (42−44) The resonance spectra of VOx/ZrO2 and VOx/Al2O3 are similar and show three resonances, with the main isotropy chemical shift at around −550 ppm and the two shoulder shifts at −585, −601 and −588, 610 ppm, respectively. The isotropic shifts of 51V NMR for VOx supported on oxides (Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2) in the range of −500 to −630 ppm have been assigned to both isolated and polymeric tetrahedral VOx species. (44−46) According to Hu et al. (45) and Keränen et al., (47) the peaks at −550 and −585 ppm could be tentatively assigned to monomeric or dimeric VOx units, and the peaks at around −601 and −610 ppm could be assigned to linear polyvanadate structures. The slight differences in surface VOx species of the two samples indicated by 51V MAS NMR is in accordance with the UV–vis and Raman results.
The vanadium coordination geometry and structural environments of VOx species on Al2O3, MgO, and SiO2 were further confirmed by the XAS measurements, and the results were analyzed based on the available k-edge XAS results of V-containing compounds, VOx theoretical models, and published literature. As shown in Figures 1e and S7, the pre-edge intensities of VOx/MgO (0.74) and VOx/Al2O3 (0.69) are much higher than that of V2O5 (0.58), indicating that the vanadium ions in the two samples are in a tetrahedral coordination because the pre-edge is generally much more intense for vanadium ions in tetrahedral coordinations. (44,46,48,49) Both the XANES and EXAFS k2·χ(k) spectra of VOx/MgO are closely similar to that of Mg3V2O8 (Figures 1e,f and S7), (49,50) which suggests that the local surroundings of vanadium ions on MgO are similar to those of Mg3V2O8 with dominantly monomeric surface VO4 units, in accordance with the 51V MAS NMR result. For VOx/SiO2, as shown in Figure 1f, the EXAFS k2·χ(k) spectrum features a main peak due to V–O bonds at 1.26 Å terminating at a point before 2.0 Å and the absence of well-developed peaks above 3.0 Å, which is different from that of a well-identified polymeric surface VOx supported on silica SBA-15 by Walter et al., (49) but similar to that of VOx/SiO2 reported by Barman et al. (46) with dominant isolated surface VOx species. The observed relatively low pre-edge intensity of VOx/SiO2 (0.55) may be caused by the partial hydration of surface VOx species. (48,49) The EXAFS k2·χ(k) spectrum of VOx/Al2O3 also features a main peak at 1.26 Å terminating at a point before 2.0 Å, the spectrum before 3.0 Å resembles that of a dimeric V2O7 theoretical model proposed by Walter et al. (49) and the presence of peaks above 3.0 Å suggests the presence of other polymeric VOx species. Therefore, the dispersion of VOx/Al2O3 is relatively lower than VOx/MgO and VOx/SiO2, in consistent with the 51V MAS NMR and UV–vis results. In summary, the molecular structures of VOx on these oxides supports listed in Table S1 were further confirmed by the 51V MAS NMR and XAS results.
3.2. PDH Performances
The performances of these catalysts were measured in both Ar and CO2 atmospheres. Propane turnover frequency (TOFpropane) was used to evaluate the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. In our cases, negligible COx was detected after 10 min on stream, in accordance with the literature that the reducible lattice oxygen atoms in VOx were depleted within the first several minutes. (9,51) Moreover, the catalytic activity of this time was used to calculate the initial TOFpropane to exclude the influences of propane oxidative dehydrogenation catalyzed by reducible lattice oxygen in VOx species. As shown in Figures 2a and S8, these catalysts with a V surface density of around 2 V/nm2 showed a dramatic difference in activity under the Ar atmosphere. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is the most active one with TOFpropane 4 times higher than that of VOx/TiO2, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/Al2O3, and 16 times higher than that of VOx/MgO. As shown in Figure 2c, the activity advantage of ZrO2-supported VOx remains over a wide range of V surface densities, which suggests that the polymerization degree of VOx is not determining to the high intrinsic activity of VOx/ZrO2. Unsaturated ZrO2 has been reported active in PDH, (52) the contributions of which can be ruled out in the present study because the bare ZrO2 used in the present study is unreducible (Figure S9) and the activity of which is negligible under reaction conditions (Figure S10).

(a) PDH activity (TOFpropane) of catalysts in Ar and CO2 atmospheres; (b) residual activity of catalysts after 4 h on stream, residual activity = TOFpropane,end/TOFpropane,initial; activity of catalysts with different V surface densities in (c) Ar and (d) CO2 atmospheres. Conditions: 550 °C, PC3H8 = 18 kPa, C3H8/Ar = 5.4:24.6 (Ar atmosphere) or C3H8/CO2/Ar = 5.4:10.8:13.8 (CO2 atmosphere), WHSVpropane = 6.48 h–1, total flow rate = 30 mL/min.
It is interesting to find that, as shown in Figure 2a, the introduction of CO2 contributes to the higher intrinsic activity of these VOx-based catalysts with a similar VOx molecular structure at V surface density of around 2 V/nm2 except for VOx/ZrO2. However, this situation changes with VOx dispersion─which decreases with the increase in V surface densities as indicated by Eg shown in Figure S5. The activities of VOx/ZrO2 are inhibited regardless of VOx dispersion, but which are still the highest among all catalysts under study (Figures 2d and S11). The activities of VOx/Al2O3 are enhanced only over catalysts with relatively low V densities (<2.5 V/nm2) and the promotional effects of CO2 cannot last over 50 min because of faster deactivation (Figure S12). This might be the reason why inhabitation effects of CO2 were often observed in the literature over Al2O3-supported VOx. (5,11) For VOx/TiO2, the activities of which are promoted by CO2 over a wide range of V densities but also companied with fast deactivation (Figure S13). As observed in the literature (53,54) and the present study (Figures S9 and S10), the TiO2 itself is reducible and active in activating propane, it is hard to identify the contribution of VOx and defective TiOx in PDH, and thus the VOx/TiO2 catalysts will not be discussed in depth in the following part. The activity of VOx/MgO (V density of 2.0 V/nm2) is increased by nearly twofold in the presence of CO2 (Figure 2d), and accelerated deactivations were also observed, especially on samples with higher V densities (Figure S14). The stability of SiO2-supported VOx was found the least to be influenced by CO2 introduction for all V densities under study (Figure S15).
It is apparent that, the introduction of CO2 leads to faster deactivation of catalysts except for silica supported ones. Moreover, it should be noted from above phenomena that whether promotional effects of CO2 could be observed experimentally is closely related to the deactivation behavior of these catalysts. Promotional effects of CO2 on catalysts activity could be observed over catalysts with higher stability, as that of VOx/MgO and VOx/Al2O3 with lower V surface densities (Figures 2, S12, and S14). Correspondingly, inhibition effects of CO2 on catalyst activity were generally observed over catalysts with lower stability, as that of VOx/ZrO2 which losses over half of its activity after 4 h on stream (Figures 2b and S11), and VOx/Al2O3 with higher VOx loadings (Figure S12). Coke deposition is a primary factor leading to catalyst deactivation during PDH. The coking behaviors of VOx-based catalysts with V surface densities around 2 V/nm2 with and without CO2 introduction are compared and discussed in the following section.
3.3. Coking Behaviors of Catalysts
The coke contents and TPO results of spent catalysts reacting in Ar and CO2 atmospheres were collected and shown in Figures 3a and S16. It is apparent that, except for VOx/SiO2, the introduction of CO2 leads to nearly 10-fold higher amount of coke deposited on Al2O3-, TiO2-, and MgO-supported VOx. The heavier coking of these three catalysts in CO2 also results in a slight decrease in propene selectivity to propene (Figure S17). The accelerated coke deposition in the presence of CO2 was also observed in the literature over CrOx/silicalite-1 catalysts. (55) As shown in Figure 3b, this effect of CO2 can be well illustrated by the facts that the coke contents of spent VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/ZrO2 increase linearly with the increase in the CO2/C3H8 ratio. Therefore, apparently higher coking rates would account for the observed faster deactivation of catalysts in the CO2 atmosphere. In contrast, negligible change in coke contents of spent VOx/SiO2 can be observed in the presence of CO2 and even lower coking rates of silica-supported VOx were observed by other researchers. (10)

(a) Correlations of coke contents of spent catalysts with acidity of the catalyst reacting in Ar and CO2 atmospheres; (b) coke contents of catalysts as a function of CO2/C3H8 ratio; (c) NH3-TPD results of bare support and catalysts; (d) CO2-TPD results of catalysts; and the V surface density of catalysts under study is around 2 V/nm2.
Generally, the coking behaviors of catalysts are influenced by the acidity of catalysts, dispersion of active sites, and feed compositions. (39,56,57) As shown in Figure 3a, except for VOx/ZrO2, the coke contents of spent catalysts reacting in an Ar atmosphere increase linearly with their acidity determined by NH3-TPD (Figure 3c and Table S2), in agreement with literature in that the acidic sites in catalysts contribute to coking reactions. (6,58,59) Moreover, similar relationships between catalyst acidity and coke content was reported by Sokolov et al., (58) in which the amount of carbon deposited on the surface of supports correlated well with their acidity measured by IR pyridine adsorption. Given that the acidities of both bare ZrO2 and VOx/ZrO2 are relatively lower among these samples, the contribution of which to the observed high level of coking rate could be reasonably excluded. As observed in the present study (Figures S11–S15) and literature, (39) the deactivation rates of these catalysts increase with the increase in V surface densities, suggesting that a higher polymerization degree of VOx species suffer from heavier coke deposition. The relatively higher polymerized degree of VOx supported on ZrO2 determined by UV–vis would be one of factors leading to faster coke deposition. As coking reactions over catalysts with relatively higher acidity and VOx polymerization degree could be further accelerated by CO2 introduction, the extremely low acidity and high dispersion of VOx over the surface of silica would account for its resistance to coke deposition with and without CO2 introduction.
The reason why the introduction of CO2 could accelerate coke depositions over these catalysts can be well elucidated by the H2 sensitivity analysis. As shown in Figure 4a, the residual activity of VOx/ZrO2 increases significantly from 45.3 to 93.5% at the H2/C3H8 ratio of 0.5, and the corresponding coke contents of spent catalyst decrease dramatically from 1.6 to 0.076% (Figures 4a and S18). Further increasing the H2/C3H8 ratio would contribute little to stability enhancement, which indicates that coking reactions on the VOx/ZrO2 is sensitive to H2 partial pressure. As a result, the ZrO2-supported VOx can serve as a highly active and stable catalyst for PDH in the presence of H2 (Figure 4c). Similar coke inhibition and stability enhancement effects of H2 can also be observed for VOx/Al2O3 (Figure 4b,d), in consistent with our previous study (56) and literature (1,59) in that H2 could serve as effective coke inhibitors for PDH. As shown in Figure S19, the introduction of CO2 results in a H2 lean reaction condition compared with that in an Ar atmosphere and thus leading to heavier coke deposition over these catalysts.

3.4. Kinetic Study and Active Sites
The apparent activation energy (Ea) of PDH reacting in both Ar and CO2 atmospheres over these catalysts were obtained by fitting Arrhenius plot (Figure S20). As shown in Figure 5, all these activation energies obtained in the present study are within a reasonable range of 100–200 kJ/mol. (60) It should be noted that the presence of CO2 lowers the activation energies of all catalysts under investigation, which suggests that the intrinsic activity of VOx-based catalysts can actually be promoted by CO2 introduction regardless of supports. The competitive adsorption of CO2 with C3H8 should not account for the activity inhibition effects of VOx/ZrO2 because the adsorption of CO2 on VOx/ZrO2 is even weaker than that of VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/MgO (Figure 3d). The experimentally observed activity inhibition phenomenon would be the results of fast deactivation due to coke deposition on catalysts with a relatively higher acidity and VOx polymerization degree as discussed above. In addition, it was found that the Ea of VOx/ZrO2 (154 kJ/mol) reacting in an Ar atmosphere is the lowest among all samples, in accordance with its high catalytic activity. Because it has been proved that the VOx species are in partly reduced states in both Ar and CO2 atmospheres during PDH, (9,10) the reducibility and active sites of catalysts under a reductive atmosphere were characterized and PDH on partly reduced VOx was investigated by theoretical calculation to provide more insights into the factors influencing the intrinsic activity of VOx dispersed on different oxides.

The reducibility and oxidation states of VOx-based catalysts under a reductive atmosphere were investigated to understand their specific PDH performances. The H2-TPR results of these catalysts and bare supports are profiled in Figure 6a and Table 2, it is obvious that the support substrate has an apparent influence on the reducibility of VOx species. The reduction peak position (Tmax) of VOx varies largely from 461 °C for ZrO2 to 627 °C for MgO as support, and follows the order of ZrO2 < TiO2 < Al2O3 < SiO2 < MgO, in agreement with previously reported results. (61,62) Among these oxides supports, only TiO2 is reducible in the temperature range of 480–740 °C, (54,63) and which is further prompted by the presence of VOx. (64) The VOx/MgO catalyst has the lowest reducibility because of the strong interactions between VOx and support. (64−66)

The reduction extent of VOx supported on different oxides can be estimated from H2-TPR results based on H2 consumption. The average oxide state values of vanadia (AOS) calculated from H2/V are 3.78, 3.80, 3.98, and 4.00 for VOx supported on ZrO2, Al2O3, SiO2, and MgO, respectively. Similar values of around 3.80 determined by H2-TPR and XPS for VOx/Al2O3 were also reported by other research studies. (66−68) The VOx/TiO2 catalyst was not included because of the reducibility of bare TiO2. It should be noted that, although with slightly different reduction extent, all VOx species were only partly reduced under the H2 atmosphere, in accordance with previously reported AOS of V in the range of 3.5–4.5 determined by various techniques. (30,65,69,70)
The distributions of vanadia oxidation states after reduction were estimated by XPS. As shown in Figure 6b, the XPS spectrum of the V 2p region for reduced catalysts were deconvoluted into three peaks at 515.8, 516.8 and 517.8 eV representing V5+, V4+, and V3+, respectively. (30,33,66) It was found that only V4+ and V3+ species could be identified for the VOx/TiO2 sample (Table S3), in consisted with the XPS results reported by Kaichev and co-workers, (71) whereas coexistences of V5+, V4+, and V3+ species were determined on other samples. Much higher reduction extent of VOx supported on TiO2 than that of ZrO2 has also been determined by in situ Raman spectra. (24) The percentages of V5+ species are lower for VOx/ZrO2 and VOx/Al2O3 than that of VOx/SiO2, and both the value and the trend of reduction extent corresponding well with H2-TPR results for these three samples. As for VOx/MgO, the AOS of V obtained from the XPS result is lower than that from H2-TPR. This is because the calcined VOx/MgO was less oxidized than other samples as indicated by the relatively lower binding energy of V than that of VOx/Al2O3 (Figure S21).
The coordinately unsaturated V3+ and V4+ species have been identified as active sites for PDH without oxygen introduction. Therefore, the reduction extent of VOx should be one factor influencing the activity of VOx. Rodemerck et al. (39) and Gong et al. (30,72) reported that the catalytic activity of VOx increase with VOx reduction extents. Therefore, the relatively higher reduction extents and the percentage of V3+/4+ species over VOx/ZrO2 should be one reason accounting for its high intrinsic activity. It should be noted that, in the study of Gong et al., (30,72) the intrinsic activity of 6V/Al2O3 with V average oxidation state (AOS) of 3.6 was reported 1.17 times that of 1V/Al2O3 with V AOS of 4.0, while 1V/ZrO2 with similar vanadium AOS (V AOS) of 3.5 was 6 times that of the same 1V/Al2O3 sample. Together with our observation that the VOx/TiO2 with the largest reduction extent (V AOS of 3.43) showing only moderate activity, it is reasonable to deduct that the reduction extent of VOx may not be the only factor determining the intrinsic activity of supported VOx. Therefore, PDH over partly reduced V–O active sites dispersed over different oxides were further investigated and compared to shed light on the critical factors influencing the intrinsic activity of VOx-based catalysts.
3.5. DFT Calculation
Based on Raman and UV–vis results, supported monomeric and dimeric VOx species with tetrahedral coordination of V were established to represent these isolated and polymerized VOx species, respectively. As shown in Figure S22, partly reduced VOx was modeled by removing one terminal oxygen atom of vanadyl (V═O). The oxygen vacancy formation energies─indicative the reducibility of the oxygen atom (73,74)─of these oxygen atoms (Ef,vac) were calculated and shown in Figure 7a. It was found that the Tmax of catalysts obtained from H2-TPR correlates linearly with the Ef,vac of oxygen in vanadyl (V═O) of corresponding models, suggesting the validation of these models in predicting their catalytic behaviors. In addition, H2 formation is energetically more favorable than that of H2O over these partly reduced V–O–S sites, especially over the 2V–O–Mg bond that two H atoms adsorbed on V and adjacent O atom readily recombine to form H2 (Figure 7b), indicating that propane direct dehydrogenation prevails over propane oxidative dehydrogenation on these V–O active sites.
Figure 7
Figure 7. (a) Correlation of catalyst reduction peak temperatures obtained from H2-TPR with oxygen vacancy formation energy of terminal oxygen atoms in VOx–support slab models; (b) activation energy of H2 vs H2O formation over M–O–S sites.
Propene formation over metal oxide catalysts can be described by two consecutive dehydrogenation steps (9,51,75)─the C–H bond activation of propane and the following propene formation from isopropyl. PDH over the bulk V2O5 surface was first conducted to illustrate the effects of V oxidation states on their intrinsic PDH activities. Because V2O5 tends to cleave parallel to the (001) plane, (76,77) the partly reduced mono-layer and di-layer V2O5(001) surfaces were used in the present study (Figure S22). As shown in Table S4, the removal of V═O terminal oxygen atoms in mono-layer V2O5(001) results in a clear decrease in V oxidation states─the average Bader charge of corresponding V atom decreases from +2.088 to +1.799 |e|. However, this situation changes on the di-layer V2O5(001) surface because these partly reduced V will form a new bond with oxygen atoms from the sublayer (Figure S22), resulting in negligible change in V oxidation states (Table S4). As a result, as shown in Figure 8a, the C–H bond activation energy of C3H8 over partly reduced mono-layer V2O5(001) is 0.71 eV lower than that of di-layer V2O5(001) (1.30 vs 2.10 eV), in agreement with the literature that partly reduced VOx species are active sites under non-oxidative atmospheres. (39,72) For the propene formation step, the difference in Ea becomes small (1.32 vs 1.40 eV). This might be caused by the stronger interactions between TS4 and V atom, which contributes to weakening the V–O bond with the second V2O5(001) layer.
Figure 8
Figure 8. Potential energies and TS structures of PDH over (a) mono-layer V2O5 and di-layer V2O5; (b) monomeric VOx–support models; and (c) dimeric VOx–support models.
The reaction energy profiles and transition states for propane activation over supported VOx are shown in Figure 8b,c. The direct dehydrogenation of alkanes over metal–oxygen pairs were found more likely following the heterotic mechanism that the hydrocarbon intermediates (HCs) and H atom tend to be stabilized atop partly reduced V and bridge O, respectively. (73,75,78) It was found that propane activation on the V–O–Zr site is most favorable with an activation energy of 1.10 eV, which is 0.15 and 0.53 eV lower than that of V–O–Al and V–O–Si active sites, respectively. The same trend was found for the following propene formation step over these sites. For propane activation over dimeric VOx models, it was found that the Ea of propane activation over V2–O–Zr is 0.09 eV higher than that of V–O–Zr, but is still lower than other V2–O–Al and V2–O–Si active sites. The transition states could not be identified over both V–O–Mg and V2–O–Mg sites because the bridge O can hardly stabilize the H atom with an adsorption energy of +1.23 eV (Table S5). Although the transition states of PDH can proceed over the V–O–V site in the VOx/MgO dimer structure, the Ea for a propene formation step is as high as 2.48 eV (Figure 8c). In summary, partly reduced monomeric and dimeric VOx species with triply coordinated V atom supported on ZrO2 is most favorable in PDH, in well agreement with experimental results.
The scaling relationships were established and the electronic structures of active sites were further analyzed to reveal the basic principles underlying the performances of these V–O–support bonds. The H adsorption energy has been reported effective describers for catalytic activities of metal or metal oxide. (51,79) In our cases, as shown in Figure 9a, scaling relationship can be established between the first H rupture energy barriers of propane and H adsorption energy atop V sites, but the 2H co-adsorption on V–O bonds were found more robust in predicting PDH activities (Figure 9b), suggesting that the bridge oxygen atom plays critical roles in activating propane. Indeed, the H adsorption strength was found correlating intimately with the corresponding oxygen electronic structure (Figure S23), which increases with the increase in average Bader charge of oxygen. The oxygen having relatively higher average Bader charge is less negative and more electrophilic and thus catalytically more active. (73,74) As propane activation proceeds over V–O sites with CH species and H adsorption atop V and H atom, respectively. Higher H binding strength of oxygen would contribute to lowering C–H bond activation energies. Actually, as shown in Figure S24, the C–H bond rupture barrier over V–O–support sites was found to decrease linearly with the increase in average Bader charge of oxygen in monomeric VOx species.

(a) Scaling relationship between adsorption energies of H atom V and Ea of propane activation; (b) scaling relationship between co-adsorption energies of two H atoms on the V–O bond and Ea of propane activation; (c,d) integration results of the charge-density differences of VO3–Al2O3 and VO3–ZrO2 models along Z coordination; and (e,f) charge-density differences of VO3–Al2O3 and VO3–ZrO2 models.
The integrated partial charge density along Z coordination of VO3–Al2O3 and VO3–ZrO2 were compared and shown in Figure 9c,d, it is apparent that, more electrons are accumulated around bridge oxygen in the V–O–Al bond, in agreement with Bader charge analysis results. In addition, as shown in Figure 9e,f, the electrons around bridge oxygen in V–O–Zr are more localized than that of V–O–Al, which suggests that the V–O–Zr bond is more polarized and thus more active than that of the V–O–Al bond. Because the V and O in VO3–(Al2O3 and ZrO2) have the same coordination number, the electronegativity of cations of support oxide would be the factor influencing the electronic structure of the bridge oxygen in V–O–support bonds. (28) Therefore, the nature of support not only influences the reducibility of VOx and further to the number of active sites but also plays a critical role in determining the chemical states and further to the intrinsic activity of V–O active sites.
Based on the above established scaling relationships, activity promotional effects of CO2 could be tentatively understood from the mechanism aspect. As shown in Figure S19, under a CO2 atmosphere, the CO instead of H2 becomes the main byproduct of propene, suggesting the dissociation of CO2 and the involvement of dissociated O species in VOx re-oxidation and further to the reaction process. (9−11) By using operando UV Raman spectroscopy, Rogg and Hess (10) found that the VOx supported on silica could be largely re-oxidized by CO2, and be partly reduced under the reaction condition (C3H8/CO2/He) but with relatively lower reduction extent than that in the H2 atmosphere, suggesting the dynamic supplementation–depletion process of the lattice oxygen in VOx under the reaction condition. Ascoop and colleagues (9) studied the dynamic behavior of WOx–VOx/SiO2 by cofeeding D2 with C3H8 and CO2 and found that about 45% of water contains D2O, revealing that both OPDH (one-step) and direct PDH followed by consecutive RWGS reaction (two-step) routes are involved in propane activation. Because the one-step OPDH process proceeds on V–O bonds with reducible lattice O atoms, while unreducible lattice O atoms on V–O bonds are involved in the direct PDH reaction. According to the scaling relationships established in the present study (Figure 9b), the involvement of more active O atoms in propane activation process would contribute to lowering C–H rupture barriers of propane. However, to fully take advantage of this merit of CO2 in the CO2-PDH process, the coking reactions of VOx-based catalysts should be inhibited to the largest extent by tuning the dispersion and acidity of catalysts.
4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The effects of support and CO2 on PDH over VOx-based catalysts were systematically studied by a combination of experiments and theoretical calculations. It was found that the activities of VOx vary significantly with oxide supports, among which the activity of VOx/ZrO2 is over 4 times higher than that of other samples. The bridge oxygen in V–O site was found to play critical roles in activation propane under reductive condition, the weaker VOx–support interactions result in lower electron density of bridge oxygen and thus contributing to higher C–H bond rupture capability as that of VOx/ZrO2. The kinetic study and established scaling relationships reveals that the CO2 would facilitate propane activation by re-oxidization of VOx with more active lattice oxygen. On the other hand, whether promotional effects of CO2 on catalysts activity could be observed experimentally or not relate closely to the coking behaviors of catalysts because the H2 lean conditions caused by CO2 would lead to faster deactivation of catalysts with higher VOx polymerization degree and stronger support acidity. The structure–performance relationships established in the present study would provide basic principles for rational active site micro-environment manipulation to design high-performance vanadium-based PDH and CO2-PDH catalysts.
