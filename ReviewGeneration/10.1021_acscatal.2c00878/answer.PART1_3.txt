[1] "Among these transition metal oxides, supported VOx-based catalysts are promising candidates due to their relatively higher activities."

[2] "The activities of VOx vary significantly with oxide supports, among which the activity of VOx/ZrO2 is over 4 times higher than that of other samples."

[3] "It was found that propane activation on the VOZr site is most favorable with an activation energy of 1.10 eV, which is 0.15 and 0.53 eV lower than that of VOAl and VOSi active sites, respectively."

[4] "The nature of support not only influences the reducibility of VOx and further to the number of active sites but also plays a critical role in determining the chemical states and further to the intrinsic activity of VO active sites."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It finds that ZrO2-supported VOx shows much higher intrinsic activity than VOx supported on other oxides like Al2O3 and SiO2. DFT calculations reveal the VO-Zr bond polarizes the bridge oxygen more than VO-Al and VO-Si bonds, making it more electrophilic and lowering the propane CH bond activation energy. The nature of the support also influences VOx reducibility, creating more active V3+/V4+ sites.

Answer: 是的,该文献研究了调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧迁移性和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它发现ZrO2支撑的VOx比其它氧化物(如Al2O3和SiO2)支撑的VOx具有更高的固有活性。DFT计算显示VO-Zr键比VO-Al和VO-Si键更能极化桥氧,使其更具亲电性,从而降低丙烷CH键活化能。支撑体的性质也会影响VOx的可还原性,产生更多活性的V3+/V4+位点。

[1] "In mechanistic aspects, Ascoop and colleagues studied the dynamic behavior of WOxVOx/SiO2 by cofeeding D2 with C3H8 and CO2 and found that about 45% of water contains D2O, revealing that both one-step OPDH pathway and direct PDH followed by consecutive RWGS reaction routes (two-step) are involved in propane activation." 

[2] "Because the one-step OPDH process proceeds on VO bonds with reducible lattice O atoms, while unreducible lattice O atoms on VO bonds are involved in the direct PDH reaction."

[3] "The direct dehydrogenation of alkanes over metaloxygen pairs were found more likely following the heterotic mechanism that the hydrocarbon intermediates (HCs) and H atom tend to be stabilized atop partly reduced V and bridge O, respectively."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios involving both a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation route and a two-step direct dehydrogenation followed by reverse water-gas shift route. It describes propane activation proceeding on VO sites with a CH intermediate on reduced V and H atom on the bridge oxygen, following a heterolytic mechanism.

Answer: 是的,该文献提出了机理方案,既包括一步氧化脱氢途径,也包括两步直接脱氢后跟反向水煤气转移途径。它描述了丙烷活化发生在VO位点上,CH中间体位于部分还原的V上,H原子位于桥氧上,遵循异裂机理。

Answer: Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in VOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It finds ZrO2 support leads to much higher intrinsic activity than Al2O3 and SiO2 supports. DFT calculations reveal VO-Zr interactions polarize bridge oxygen more, lowering propane activation barriers. The support also tunes VOx reducibility and active V3+/V4+ site density.

Answer: 是的,该文献探索了VOx催化剂中金属-支撑界面效应对丙烷脱氢的影响。它发现ZrO2支撑导致比Al2O3和SiO2支撑具有更高的固有活性。DFT计算显示VO-Zr相互作用使桥氧更极化,降低丙烷活化栏rier。支撑体还调节VOx的可还原性和活性V3+/V4+位点密度。
