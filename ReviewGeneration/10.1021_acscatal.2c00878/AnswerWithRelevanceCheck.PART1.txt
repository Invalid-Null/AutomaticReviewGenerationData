         [1] "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are promising candidates for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) with and without CO2 introduction."
         
         [2] "Under propane direct dehydrogenation conditions, partly reduced V3+Ox/V4+Ox species have been identified as active sites for PDH without oxygen introduction."
         
         [3] "The experiments and established scaling relationships based on density functional theory calculations reveal that the chemical states of bridge oxygen in the VO bond play critical roles in propane activation under the reductive condition, and the weaker VOxsupport interactions result in lower electron density of bridge oxygen and thus contributing to higher CH bond rupture capability as that of VOx/ZrO2."
         
         [4] "The kinetic study and established scaling relationships reveals that the CO2 would facilitate propane activation by re-oxidization of VOx with more active lattice oxygen."

      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that partly reduced V3+/V4+ species are the active sites, and that the chemical states of bridge oxygen in the VO bond play critical roles in activating the CH bond of propane. Weaker VOx-support interactions lead to lower electron density on bridge oxygen, enhancing its capability to rupture the CH bond. CO2 facilitates propane activation by re-oxidizing VOx to create more active lattice oxygen species.

         答:是的,这篇文章探究了调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧原子迁移性以及酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它指出,V3+/V4+部分还原态是活性中心,VO键中的桥氧原子的化学态在激活丙烷的CH键方面起关键作用。较弱的VOx-载体相互作用导致桥氧上的电子密度降低,增强了其断裂CH键的能力。CO2通过再氧化VOx产生更多活性的晶格氧原子促进了丙烷的激活。

         [1] "Because direct PDH reaction is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction which requires high temperatures to obtain industrially interested per-pass conversions. Besides high energy consumption, these harsh reaction conditions would lead to heavy coking and sintering of active sites."
         
         [2] "The experiments were conducted at 550 C to obtain a relatively low level of propane conversion of below 10% to calculate the intrinsic activity of these catalysts."
         
         [3] "It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is the most active one with TOFpropane 4 times higher than that of VOx/TiO2, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/Al2O3, and 16 times higher than that of VOx/MgO." 
         
         [4] "The kinetic study and established scaling relationships reveals that the CO2 would facilitate propane activation by re-oxidization of VOx with more active lattice oxygen. On the other hand, whether promotional effects of CO2 on catalysts activity could be observed experimentally or not relate closely to the coking behaviors of catalysts because the H2 lean conditions caused by CO2 would lead to faster deactivation of catalysts with higher VOx polymerization degree and stronger support acidity."

         Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied VOx catalysts. It notes that high temperature is needed to overcome thermodynamic limitations, but causes coking and sintering. Intrinsic activity was measured at 550°C and 10% conversion. VOx/ZrO2 was the most active, attributed to the chemical states of oxygen atoms. CO2 facilitates propane activation by creating more active lattice oxygen to oxidize VOx, but its promotional effects depend on avoiding accelerated coking caused by CO2.

         答:是的,这篇文章提出了在所研究的VOx催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢的机理场景。它指出需要高温来克服热力学限制,但会导致焦炭和烧结。在550°C和10%转化率下测量了固有活性。VOx/ZrO2活性最高,归因于氧原子的化学态。CO2通过产生更多活性的晶格氧原子氧化VOx来促进丙烷的激活,但是其促进效应取决于避免CO2导致的加速焦炭。

         [1] "The effects of support and CO2 on PDH over VOx-based catalysts were systematically investigated by a combination of experiments and theoretical calculations."
         
         [2] "It was found that the activities of VOx vary significantly with oxide supports, among which the activity of VOx/ZrO2 is over 4 times higher than that of other samples." 
         
         [3] "The experiments and established scaling relationships based on density functional theory calculations reveal that the chemical states of bridge oxygen in the VO bond play critical roles in propane activation under the reductive condition, and the weaker VOxsupport interactions result in lower electron density of bridge oxygen and thus contributing to higher CH bond rupture capability as that of VOx/ZrO2."
         
         [4] "The basic principles established in the present study will help to further tune the micro-environment of the VO active site for high-performance PDH and CO2-PDH reactions."

      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in VOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It systematically investigates the effects of different oxide supports on PDH activity over VOx catalysts, finding VOx/ZrO2 to be 4 times more active. DFT calculations reveal this is due to weaker VOx-ZrO2 interactions leading to lower electron density on bridge oxygen atoms, enhancing their capability to rupture C-H bonds in propane. The principles established aim to help tune the VO active site microenvironment.

         答:是的,这篇文章探究了VOx催化剂中金属-载体界面效应对丙烷脱氢的影响。它系统地研究了不同氧化物载体对VOx催化剂PDH活性的影响,发现VOx/ZrO2的活性是其他催化剂的4倍。DFT计算揭示这是由于VOx-ZrO2相互作用较弱,导致桥氧原子上的电子密度降低,增强了断裂丙烷中C-H键的能力。所建立的原理旨在帮助调节VO活性中心的微环境。
