[1] "In order to gain insight into the mechanistic details of this propane conversion, we performed PXRD and XPS studies of DFNS/BN before and after catalysis (Figure 2). PXRD data indicate that as-synthesized DFNS/BN contains a crystalline BN phase (JCPDS-00-018-0251) (Figure 2a). After catalysis, the diffraction peaks of the crystalline BN phase disappear, whereas a boron oxide phase (JCPDS-00-013-0570) is detected."

[2] "XPS studies also evidence the conversion of the BN phase to the boron oxide phase after catalysis. Figure 2be shows typical B 1s, Si 2p, O 1s, and N 1s core-level spectra." 

[3] "The B 1s spectrum of as-prepared DFNS/BN (Figure 2b) is the superposition of peaks at a binding energy of 190 and 192193 eV assigned to BN supported on silica and OBO, BOH environments, respectively."

[4] "After catalysis, the BN signal at 190 eV disappears, while the broad signal around 192193 eV assigned to boron oxide increases. (6,23)"

[5] "Notably, when we compared these catalysts at various weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), DFNS/BN was found to be better than h-BN in terms of propane conversion and propene productivity, while BNNT showed better propene productivity compared to DFNS/BN (Figure 5)."

Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. PXRD data show crystalline BN is converted to boron oxide after catalysis. XPS also shows conversion of BN to boron oxide after catalysis based on changes in B 1s spectra. Comparison of DFNS/BN to other catalysts like h-BN and BNNT at different WHSV also provides insights into performance.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文使用X射线衍射(PXRD)和X射线光电子能谱(XPS)来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。PXRD数据显示,在催化后,结晶BN被转换为硼氧化物。根据B 1s光谱的变化,XPS也显示催化后BN被转化为硼氧化物。在不同WHSV下,将DFNS/BN与其他催化剂如h-BN和BNNT进行比较,也提供了性能方面的见解。
