1. Propene is a very important building block for a large number of chemical products, such as the widely used poly(propene) polymer. It is also used to produce a large quantity of other useful chemicals, such as acrolein, acrylonitrile, cumene, propylene oxide, and butyraldehyde. 

2. No relevant quotes.

3. This discovery provides an alternative route for the production of olefins from alkanes, which is much more sustainable than the conventional protocol. It was hypothesized that the oxidized edges of these materials were the catalytic active sites. Additional studies on various boron-containing materials with oxidized surfaces supported that assumption.
