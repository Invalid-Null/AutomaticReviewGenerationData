[1] "PXRD and XPS studies of DFNS/BN before and after catalysis (Figure 2). PXRD data indicate that as-synthesized DFNS/BN contains a crystalline BN phase (JCPDS-00-018-0251) (Figure 2a). After catalysis, the diffraction peaks of the crystalline BN phase disappear, whereas a boron oxide phase (JCPDS-00-013-0570) is detected. XPS studies also evidence the conversion of the BN phase to the boron oxide phase after catalysis."

[2] "The PXRD results indicate that DFNS/B2O3 (before and after catalysis) contains crystalline B2O3 phase (JCPDS-00-013-0570) (Figure 4a). XPS analysis also confirms the presence of B2O3 phase."

[1] "we have sought to ascertain whether the activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be increased and the structures can be made more stable."

[2] "Recently, the catalytic properties of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) for the conversion of propane to propene with high selectivity to olefins were reported."  

[3] "we coated the DFNS fibers with BN using boric acid and urea as precursors using our recently developed solution-phase deposition process (17), which was then treated at a temperature of 900 C under nitrogen for 5 h to produce DFNS/BN."

[4] "DFNS/BN showed a markedly increased catalytic efficiency, accompanied by exceptional stability and selectivity."

[5] "We used DFNS as a support because it has a large surface area (SA) and excellent physical and textural properties (1517), as well as possesses a unique fibrous morphology instead of the porous structures found in, for example, MCM-41 and SBA-15 type materials."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes coating DFNS fibers with BN using a solution-phase deposition process to increase catalytic activity and stability compared to unsupported BN catalysts. The high surface area and fibrous morphology of the DFNS support are noted as beneficial.
</English version answer>  

<Chinese version answer>  
答:是的,该文探讨了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它描述了使用溶液相沉积法在DFNS纤维上涂覆BN,与不支持的BN催化剂相比可以增加催化活性和稳定性。DFNS支撑体的高比表面积和纤维状形态被认为是有益的。

<quotes>
[1] "The local atomic environments of the DFNS-supported BN and B2O3 catalysts were then studied by solid-state NMR spectroscopy (Figures 6 and 7), a technique that has been extensively demonstrated to be a powerful probe of the local structure of materials." 

[2] "Indeed, we have recently shown the successful use of solid-state NMR to better understand catalytic sites and catalytic mechanisms."

[3] "the catalytic activity of DFNS/BN depends on a complex interplay between the types and the concentrations of catalytic sites. Increased reactivity is due to SiOB bonding (prevents leaching of boron from silica surface), fibrous morphology (provided better diffusion), and the textural properties (high SA and PV)."

[4] "Through a combination of analytical techniques (PXRD, XPS, and multinuclear solid-state NMR spectroscopy), we have shown that the supported BN phase is oxidized to B2O3 during the propane dehydrogenation process."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes solid-state NMR spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts in situ. It provides insights into the local atomic environments and catalytic sites of DFNS-supported BN and B2O3 catalysts. NMR showed BN is oxidized to B2O3 during catalysis.

[1] "In order to gain insight into the mechanistic details of this propane conversion, we performed PXRD and XPS studies of DFNS/BN before and after catalysis (Figure 2). PXRD data indicate that as-synthesized DFNS/BN contains a crystalline BN phase (JCPDS-00-018-0251) (Figure 2a). After catalysis, the diffraction peaks of the crystalline BN phase disappear, whereas a boron oxide phase (JCPDS-00-013-0570) is detected."

[2] "XPS studies also evidence the conversion of the BN phase to the boron oxide phase after catalysis. Figure 2be shows typical B 1s, Si 2p, O 1s, and N 1s core-level spectra." 

[3] "The B 1s spectrum of as-prepared DFNS/BN (Figure 2b) is the superposition of peaks at a binding energy of 190 and 192193 eV assigned to BN supported on silica and OBO, BOH environments, respectively."

[4] "After catalysis, the BN signal at 190 eV disappears, while the broad signal around 192193 eV assigned to boron oxide increases. (6,23)"

[5] "Notably, when we compared these catalysts at various weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), DFNS/BN was found to be better than h-BN in terms of propane conversion and propene productivity, while BNNT showed better propene productivity compared to DFNS/BN (Figure 5)."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. PXRD data show crystalline BN is converted to boron oxide after catalysis. XPS also shows conversion of BN to boron oxide after catalysis based on changes in B 1s spectra. Comparison of DFNS/BN to other catalysts like h-BN and BNNT at different WHSV also provides insights into performance.

答:是的,该文使用X射线衍射(PXRD)和X射线光电子能谱(XPS)来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。PXRD数据显示,在催化后,结晶BN被转换为硼氧化物。根据B 1s光谱的变化,XPS也显示催化后BN被转化为硼氧化物。在不同WHSV下,将DFNS/BN与其他催化剂如h-BN和BNNT进行比较,也提供了性能方面的见解。
