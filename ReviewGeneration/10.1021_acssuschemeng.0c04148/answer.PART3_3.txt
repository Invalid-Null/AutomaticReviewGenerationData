[1] "we have sought to ascertain whether the activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be increased and the structures can be made more stable."

[2] "Recently, the catalytic properties of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) for the conversion of propane to propene with high selectivity to olefins were reported."  

[3] "we coated the DFNS fibers with BN using boric acid and urea as precursors using our recently developed solution-phase deposition process (17), which was then treated at a temperature of 900 C under nitrogen for 5 h to produce DFNS/BN."

[4] "DFNS/BN showed a markedly increased catalytic efficiency, accompanied by exceptional stability and selectivity."

[5] "We used DFNS as a support because it has a large surface area (SA) and excellent physical and textural properties (1517), as well as possesses a unique fibrous morphology instead of the porous structures found in, for example, MCM-41 and SBA-15 type materials."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes coating DFNS fibers with BN using a solution-phase deposition process to increase catalytic activity and stability compared to unsupported BN catalysts. The high surface area and fibrous morphology of the DFNS support are noted as beneficial.

答:是的,该文探讨了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它描述了使用溶液相沉积法在DFNS纤维上涂覆BN,与不支持的BN催化剂相比可以增加催化活性和稳定性。DFNS支撑体的高比表面积和纤维状形态被认为是有益的。

[1] "The local atomic environments of the DFNS-supported BN and B2O3 catalysts were then studied by solid-state NMR spectroscopy (Figures 6 and 7), a technique that has been extensively demonstrated to be a powerful probe of the local structure of materials." 

[2] "Indeed, we have recently shown the successful use of solid-state NMR to better understand catalytic sites and catalytic mechanisms."

[3] "the catalytic activity of DFNS/BN depends on a complex interplay between the types and the concentrations of catalytic sites. Increased reactivity is due to SiOB bonding (prevents leaching of boron from silica surface), fibrous morphology (provided better diffusion), and the textural properties (high SA and PV)."

[4] "Through a combination of analytical techniques (PXRD, XPS, and multinuclear solid-state NMR spectroscopy), we have shown that the supported BN phase is oxidized to B2O3 during the propane dehydrogenation process."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes solid-state NMR spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts in situ. It provides insights into the local atomic environments and catalytic sites of DFNS-supported BN and B2O3 catalysts. NMR showed BN is oxidized to B2O3 during catalysis.

[1] "PXRD and XPS analyses of DFNS/BN before and after catalysis were also performed (Figure 4)."

[2] "The PXRD results indicate that DFNS/BN (before and after catalysis) contains crystalline B2O3 phase (JCPDS-00-013-0570) (Figure 4a). XPS analysis also confirms the presence of B2O3 phase." 

[3] "PXRD data indicate that as-synthesized DFNS/BN contains a crystalline BN phase (JCPDS-00-018-0251) (Figure 2a). After catalysis, the diffraction peaks of the crystalline BN phase disappear, whereas a boron oxide phase (JCPDS-00-013-0570) is detected."

[4] "XPS studies also evidence the conversion of the BN phase to the boron oxide phase after catalysis."

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article uses XRD and XPS to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. The data showed crystalline BN converted to boron oxide after catalysis.
