[1] "Thus a series of preparation and reaction conditions were examined, including the ratio of Pt to Sn, calcination temperature, pre-reduction temperature and the ratio of C3H8 to H2 in feed gas."

[2] "Before running reaction-regeneration experiment to explore the influence of different regeneration modes on the catalytic performance of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, a suitable catalyst with high activity, selectivity and good stability, as well as an optimal reaction condition is required."

[3] "Fig. 1 demonstrates the time dependences of propane conversion and propylene selectivity over Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts with different Pt/Sn ratios." 

[4] "As Sn content rose, De value dropped. While Sn content exceeded 2.4 wt%, De value was almost unchanged. Accordingly, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al (i.e., Pt/Sn mole ratio is 1/2) was chosen as the catalyst for periodic reaction-regeneration operation."
