[1] Compared with the monometallic catalyst, the bimetallic catalysts with Sn doping showed higher selectivity and better stability. 
[2] Accordingly, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al (i.e., Pt/Sn mole ratio is 1/2) was chosen as the catalyst for periodic reaction-regeneration operation.
[3] Moreover, Pt and Pt3Sn overlapped into one asymmetric peak due to very adjacent position.  
[4] When the catalyst was subjected to repeated regeneration by Redox, the Pt3Sn diffraction is predominant over 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox, indicating that not only metal agglomeration but also phase transition to Pt3Sn occur.
[5] As expected, more defects and lower graphitization degree of the coke should imply higher H content.

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing that Pt-Sn/Al catalysts with a Pt:Sn ratio of 1:2 exhibited higher selectivity and stability compared to Pt/Al. XRD and TEM analysis revealed that the fresh Pt-Sn catalyst contained metallic Pt, PtSn alloy, and Pt3Sn phases. After redox regeneration cycles, the catalyst showed phase transition to large Pt3Sn particles. The extent of graphitization and H content of coke deposits were also analyzed.

是的,该文献评估了丙烷脱氢用的Pt-Sn合金催化剂。它提供的数据显示,相比Pt/Al,Pt:Sn比为1:2的Pt-Sn/Al催化剂展示出更高的选择性和稳定性。XRD和TEM分析揭示新制备的Pt-Sn催化剂包含金属Pt,PtSn合金和Pt3Sn相。在反复的氧化-还原再生循环之后,催化剂呈现Pt3Sn相的转变。文献还分析了煤炭沉积物的结晶程度和H含量。
