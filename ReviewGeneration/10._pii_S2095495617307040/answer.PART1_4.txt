<quotes>
[1] "Pt-based and chromium-based catalysts are the most widely used in propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[2] "Compared with Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts display higher activity and more environment-friendly property, and thus drawing more attention."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article evaluates Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It states that Pt-based catalysts are widely used and display higher activity and are more environmentally friendly compared to Cr-based catalysts.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "When Sn content rose, De value dropped. While Sn content exceeded 2.4 wt%, De value was almost unchanged."  

[2] "Compared with the monometallic catalyst, the bimetallic catalysts with Sn doping showed higher selectivity and better stability."

[3] "This indicated the promotional effect of Sn doping, as widely reported previously."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how properties like Sn doping and Pt:Sn ratio affect the performance of supported Pt catalysts. It shows that adding Sn as a promoter improves selectivity and stability, with an optimal Sn content around 2.4 wt%. Higher Sn levels do not further improve performance.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
Answer: 该文献研究了Sn掺杂和Pt:Sn比��等因素如何影响支持Pt催化剂的性能。结果显示,添加Sn作为助剂可以提高选择性和稳定性,最佳Sn含量约为2.4 wt%。更高的Sn含量不会进一步改善性能。
