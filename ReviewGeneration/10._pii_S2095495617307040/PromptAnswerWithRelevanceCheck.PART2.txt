<English version answer>
Answer: The article does not compare the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts. No specific examples or explanations of selectivity modulation are provided.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 该文献没有比较金属与氧化受体金属催化剂的选择性曲线。没有提供具体的示例或选择性调控的解释。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] Compared with the monometallic catalyst, the bimetallic catalysts with Sn doping showed higher selectivity and better stability.
[2] Accordingly, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al (i.e., Pt/Sn mole ratio is 1/2) was chosen as the catalyst for periodic reaction-regeneration operation.
[3] Moreover, Pt and Pt3Sn overlapped into one asymmetric peak due to very adjacent position.
[4] When the catalyst was subjected to repeated regeneration by Redox, the Pt3Sn diffraction is predominant over 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox, indicating that not only metal agglomeration but also phase transition to Pt3Sn occur.
[5] As expected, more defects and lower graphitization degree of the coke should imply higher H content.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing that Pt-Sn/Al catalysts with a Pt:Sn ratio of 1:2 exhibited higher selectivity and stability compared to Pt/Al. XRD and TEM analysis revealed that the fresh Pt-Sn catalyst contained metallic Pt, PtSn alloy, and Pt3Sn phases. After redox regeneration cycles, the catalyst showed phase transition to large Pt3Sn particles. The extent of graphitization and H content of coke deposits were also analyzed.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,该文献评估了丙烷脱氢用的 Pt-Sn合金催化剂。它提供的数据显示,相比Pt/Al,Pt:Sn比为1:2的Pt-Sn/Al催化剂展示出更高的选择性和稳定性。XRD 和 TEM 分析揭示新制备的Pt-Sn催化剂包含金属Pt,PtSn合金和Pt3Sn相。在反复的氧化-还原再生循环之后,催化剂呈现Pt3Sn相的转变。文献还分析了煤炭沉积物的结晶程度和H含量。

<quotes>
[1] Pt-Sn/Al2O3 was used as the catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. 
[2] Compared with the monometallic catalyst, the bimetallic catalysts with Sn doping showed higher selectivity and better stability.
[3] All studies indicate that the coke deposition and gradual deactivation of Pt-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is inevitable, so periodic catalyst regeneration is necessary for achieving a sufficient total lifetime.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts exhibited higher selectivity and better stability compared to Pt/Al2O3. However, Pt-Sn still deactivated over time due to coke deposition, requiring periodic regeneration.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章评估了Pt-Sn双金属催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。结果显示,与Pt/Al2O3相比,Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂表现出更高的选择性和更好的稳定性。但是,Pt-Sn随着时间的推移仍然会因焦炭沉积而失活,需要周期性地再生。

<quotes>
[1] It was found that the catalyst using hydrogen regeneration showed the best stability compared with those regenerated by nitrogen purging and coke-burning treatment, suggesting that hydrogen regeneration is an effective approach for maintaining the performance of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reaction.

[2] Compared with the monometallic catalyst, the bimetallic catalysts with Sn doping showed higher selectivity and better stability. 

[3] As Sn content rose, De value dropped. While Sn content exceeded 2.4 wt%, De value was almost unchanged.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that adding Sn as a second metal improves the selectivity and stability of Pt catalysts for this reaction. Increasing the Sn content up to 2.4 wt% reduces the deactivation rate, but further increases in Sn have little added benefit.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>  
答:是的,文章评估了Pt-Sn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。结果显示Sn作为第二金属的添加提高了Pt催化剂在该反应中的选择性和稳定性。Sn含量增加到2.4 wt%可以降低失活速率,但进一步增加Sn几乎没有额外的益处。
