<quotes>
[1] "Compared with the monometallic catalyst, the bimetallic catalysts with Sn doping showed higher selectivity and better stability." 

[2] "As Sn content rose, De value dropped. While Sn content exceeded 2.4 wt%, De value was almost unchanged."

[3] "Unlike the XRD results, it could be found from HRTEM that PtSn phase was predominant over 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Fresh, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H2 and 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N2, which was identified by characteristic lattice spacing of about 0.216nm indexed to PtSn (1 0 2) or 0.296nm indexed to PtSn (1 0 1)."

[4] "For 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox, large Pt3Sn particles arose, in agreement with the XRD result."

[5] "Additionally, a core-shell structure originated form phase segregation could be clearly observed on 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox." 

[6] "The distinguishable lattice spacing of 0.208 or 0.187nm in the shell region ascribed to Sn (2 2 0) or (3 1 0) suggests that metal Sn possibly constituted the shell."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how properties like Sn doping, metal particle size, shape, and Pt-Sn phase affect the performance of supported Pt-Sn catalysts. It shows adding Sn improves selectivity and stability, and that PtSn phase is more effective than Pt3Sn. HRTEM reveals core-shell structures can form after redox cycles.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 
答:本文研究了诸如Sn掺杂、金属颗粒大小、形状和Pt-Sn相等属性如何影响负载Pt-Sn催化剂的性能。它显示添加Sn改善选择性和稳定性,PtSn相比Pt3Sn更有效。HRTEM显示在反复氧化-还原循环后可能形成核壳结构。
