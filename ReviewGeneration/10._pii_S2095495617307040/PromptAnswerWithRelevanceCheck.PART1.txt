[1] "Compared with the monometallic catalyst, the bimetallic catalysts with Sn doping showed higher selectivity and better stability." 

[2] "As Sn content rose, De value dropped. While Sn content exceeded 2.4 wt%, De value was almost unchanged."

[3] "Unlike the XRD results, it could be found from HRTEM that PtSn phase was predominant over 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Fresh, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H2 and 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N2, which was identified by characteristic lattice spacing of about 0.216nm indexed to PtSn (1 0 2) or 0.296nm indexed to PtSn (1 0 1)."

[4] "For 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox, large Pt3Sn particles arose, in agreement with the XRD result."

[5] "Additionally, a core-shell structure originated form phase segregation could be clearly observed on 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox." 

[6] "The distinguishable lattice spacing of 0.208 or 0.187nm in the shell region ascribed to Sn (2 2 0) or (3 1 0) suggests that metal Sn possibly constituted the shell."

[1] "Platinum-based and chromium-based catalysts are the most widely used in propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[2] "Compared with Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts display higher activity and more environment-friendly property, and thus drawing more attention."

[3] "The major issue of Pt-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is rapid deactivation, which is caused by coke formation and metal agglomeration [9], [10], [11]."

[4] "Accordingly, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al (i.e., Pt/Sn mole ratio is 1/2) was chosen as the catalyst for periodic reaction-regeneration operation."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article evaluates supported Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt-Sn/Al2O3 has higher activity and selectivity compared to Pt/Al2O3. It also notes Pt-based catalysts deactivate due to coking and sintering, and finds an optimal Pt:Sn ratio of 1:2 for stability.

</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
答:这篇文章评估了负载的Pt-Sn双金属催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显示Pt-Sn/Al2O3相比Pt/Al2O3有更高的活性和选择性。它还指出Pt基催化剂因积炭和烧结导致失活,并发现Pt:Sn为1:2的比例对稳定性最佳。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "When the catalyst was subjected to repeated regeneration by Redox, not only metal agglomeration but also phase transition to Pt3Sn occur." 

[2] "Whereas for the catalyst regenerated by H2 or N2, the (1 1 1) diffraction of Pt3Sn attenuated, whereas the relative intensity of PtSn diffraction increased."

[3] "For 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox, large Pt3Sn particles arose, in agreement with the XRD result."

[4] "A core-shell structure originated form phase segregation could be clearly observed on 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox." 

[5] "The distinguishable lattice spacing of 0.208 or 0.187nm in the shell region ascribed to Sn (2 2 0) or (3 1 0) suggests that metal Sn possibly constituted the shell."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how properties like particle size, phase, and morphology affect catalyst performance. It shows repeated oxidation regeneration causes PtSn to transition to less active Pt3Sn phase with larger size. It also leads to phase segregated core-shell particles with inactive Sn shell. In contrast, H2 and N2 regeneration maintain smaller PtSn alloy particles.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:这篇文章研究了像粒子大小、相态和形态等性质如何影响催化剂性能。它显示重复的氧化再生会导致PtSn转变为活性较低的Pt3Sn相,且粒子尺寸变大。它还导致相分离的核壳粒子,表面是无活性的Sn。相比之下,H2和N2再生可以保持较小的PtSn合金粒子。
