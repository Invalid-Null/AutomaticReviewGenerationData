<quotes>
[1] "In this work, γ-Al2O3 supported nickel catalysts, Nin/Al2O3 and Ni1/Al2O3, were prepared using DP and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) methods, respectively."

[2] "The absence of diffraction signals of Ni species on both catalysts suggests high dispersion of nickel on the γ-Al2O3 support."

[3] "Comparing the spectrum of alumina support with those of Ni-based catalysts, we can find that the loading of nickel does not change the overall structure of the alumina."

[4] "The Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits entirely different catalyst performance." 

[5] "This study on Ni-based catalysts provides insights into the nature of robust Ni sites for propane dehydrogenation and demonstrates that unsaturated Ni(II) single site catalysts can serve as a promising substitute of noble Pt catalysts for PDH."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It prepares Ni/Al2O3 catalysts using different methods like deposition precipitation (DP) and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) to achieve high nickel dispersion on the alumina support. The Ni1/Al2O3 single atom catalyst prepared by IWI shows high performance and stability for propane dehydrogenation.

[1] "In situ XAS experiments of the Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst during the reaction-regeneration process were conducted to reveal the specific changes of the Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst."

[2] "The first-shell EXAFS fitting results are given in Table 1, showing a NiO coordination number of either 4.3 or 4.4 at a bond distance of 2.00 or 2.01 Å for all of the treatments." 

[3] "Regardless of gas treatment, the nature of the Ni sites remains constant for the Ni1/Al2O3 sample. This suggests that the atomically dispersed Ni2+ sites retain their local structure and no reduction or aggregation occurs over reaction-regeneration cycles, explaining the high stability of the Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst for PDH."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It conducts in-situ XAS experiments on the Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst during reaction and regeneration cycles. The results reveal that the local structure and oxidation state of the atomically dispersed Ni2+ sites remain constant over cycles, explaining the high stability of this single atom catalyst.

[1] "The atomic-scale structure of the Ni species was further characterized by STEM analysis (Figure 1C). For the Nin/Al2O3 catalyst, the formation of Ni NPs with a clear crystalline structure is observed, and the average size of the Ni NPs is 4.5 nm (Figure 1C1C3)." 

[2] "On the contrary, no obvious Ni aggregation on the Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst was detected in both the STEM image and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) maps (C4 and C5)."

[3] "By increasing the magnification, exclusively isolated Ni atoms uniformly dispersed on the alumina surface as bright dots are observed in HAADF-STEM image, as shown in Figure 1C6."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like STEM and HAADF-STEM to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses these techniques to reveal Ni nanoparticle formation vs isolated Ni atoms uniformly dispersed on the alumina surface for the different Ni/Al2O3 catalysts.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文采用了STEM和HAADF-STEM等先进的显微技术来表征丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-载体界面。这些技术揭示了不同Ni/Al2O3催化剂上Ni纳米颗粒的形成与均匀分散在氧化铝表面的隔离Ni原子之间的区别。
