[1] "Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (99.5%), sodium hydroxide (98%), and ammonium hydroxide (25 wt % NH3) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Boehmite was purchased from Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co., Ltd. and calcined at 650 C for 4 h to make Al2O3 support."

[2] "The Al2O3 supported Ni NPs catalyst (1 wt %), denoted as Nin/Al2O3, was prepared using the deposition precipitation method (DP) with NaOH as the precipitator." 

[3] "To prepare alumina-supported Ni(II) single-site catalyst (Ni1/Al2O3), 0.51 g of nickel nitrate was dissolved in 2.0 mL of deionized water. Then, the pH value of solution was adjusted to 11 by adding ammonium hydroxide, and the volume of impregnated solution was adjusted to 6.5 mL by adding deionized water."

[1] "The X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments of alumina-supported nickel samples were carried out at the 10-BM-B beamline at the Advanced Photo Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory."

[2] "Scans were also collected for the Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst after treatments in 3% C3H8/He at 580 C for 1 h and 20% O2/He at 600 C for 1 h."

[3] "Regardless of gas treatment, the nature of the Ni sites remains constant for the Ni1/Al2O3 sample. This suggests that the atomically dispersed Ni2+ sites retain their local structure and no reduction or aggregation occurs over reaction-regeneration cycles, explaining the high stability of the Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst for PDH."

[1] "The atomic-scale structure of the Ni species was further characterized by STEM analysis (Figure 1C). For the Nin/Al2O3 catalyst, the formation of Ni NPs with a clear crystalline structure is observed, and the average size of the Ni NPs is 4.5 nm (Figure 1C1C3)." 

[2] "On the contrary, no obvious Ni aggregation on the Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst was in both the STEM image and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) maps (C4 and C5). By increasing the magnification, exclusively isolated Ni atoms uniformly dispersed on the alumina surface as bright dots are observed in HAADF-STEM image, as shown in Figure 1C6."

[1] "The XANES of the Ni1/Al2O3 sample is similar to that of the NiO (Ni2+) reference, including the pre-edge feature near 8333 eV, as highlighted in the inset of Figure 2A. The pre-edge peak is assigned to the dipole-forbidden but quadrupole-allowed transition (1s → 3d)."

[2] "It can be seen from Figure 2A and Table 1 that the edge energy of Ni1/Al2O3 is centered at a higher energy than that of NiO reference, suggesting that the energy required for an electron transition from 1s to 4p is higher for Ni species supported on γ-Al2O3." 

[3] "Based on the collective evidence, the Ni in Ni1/Al2O3 is present as isolated Ni(II) single sites, which are anchored on the surface of γ-Al2O3 through bonding to oxygen atoms, while the Ni atoms in Nin/Al2O3 are mostly incorporated into metallic Ni NPs."
