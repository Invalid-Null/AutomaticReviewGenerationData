To determine the consistency ratios, I manually compared the answers from each file to the correct answers and made a subjective assessment of how consistent they were on a percentage scale from 0% to 100%. All the answer files appear fully consistent with the correct answers for each question. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
