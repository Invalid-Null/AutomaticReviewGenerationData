<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it conducted in-situ XAS experiments on the Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst during reaction and regeneration cycles to reveal changes in the catalyst. The XAS spectra were identical after various gas treatments, indicating the atomically dispersed Ni2+ sites retained their local structure during reaction conditions.

[1] "The atomic-scale structure of the Ni species was further characterized by STEM analysis (Figure 1C). For the Nin/Al2O3 catalyst, the formation of Ni NPs with a clear crystalline structure is observed, and the average size of the Ni NPs is 4.5 nm (Figure 1C1C3)." 

[2] "On the contrary, no obvious Ni aggregation on the Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst was detected in both the STEM image and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) maps (C4 and C5)."

[3] "By increasing the magnification, exclusively isolated Ni atoms uniformly dispersed on the alumina surface as bright dots are observed in HAADF-STEM image, as shown in Figure 1C6."
