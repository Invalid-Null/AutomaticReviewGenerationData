[1] "Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (99.5%), sodium hydroxide (98%), and ammonium hydroxide (25 wt % NH3) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Boehmite was purchased from Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co., Ltd. and calcined at 650 C for 4 h to make Al2O3 support."

[2] "The XRD patterns of the alumina support and alumina-supported nickel catalysts prepared from different methods are illustrated in Figure 1A."

[3] "Comparing the spectrum of alumina support with those of Ni-based catalysts, we can find that the loading of nickel does not change the overall structure of the alumina."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It compares two methods for loading nickel onto alumina supports - deposition precipitation (DP) and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI). The IWI method using ammonium hydroxide is shown to yield isolated Ni(II) single sites, while DP produces Ni nanoparticles.

[1] "The Ni K-edge XAS spectra were collected in transmission mode using three ion chambers which allowed simultaneous measurement of the samples and a Ni foil reference."

[2] "Scans were also collected for the Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst after treatments in 3% C3H8/He at 580 C for 1 h and 20% O2/He at 600 C for 1 h." 

[3] "The Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst after 1 h treatment in 3% H2 at 600 C, 1 h treatment in 3% C3H8 at 580 C, and 1 h treatment in 20% O2 at 600 C is qualitatively identical irrespective of gas treatment as illustrated by the R space and k-space EXAFS spectra (Figures 6A and S14)."

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to study the propane dehydrogenation catalysts under reaction and regeneration conditions. It collects XAS data on the Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst after treatments in H2, C3H8, and O2 environments at elevated temperatures. This reveals that the isolated Ni(II) sites retain their local structure and oxidation state throughout the reaction-regeneration cycle.

[1] "The XANES spectrum of Nin/Al2O3 shows a similar edge energy (8332.6 eV) to a Ni foil (Table 1), but the white line intensity is higher due to a small proportion of the Ni remaining oxidized."

[2] "The XANES of the Ni1/Al2O3 sample is similar to that of the NiO (Ni2+) reference, including the pre-edge feature near 8333 eV, as highlighted in the inset of Figure 2A."

[3] "Based on the collective evidence, the Ni in Ni1/Al2O3 is present as isolated Ni(II) single sites, which are anchored on the surface of γ-Al2O3 through bonding to oxygen atoms, while the Ni atoms in Nin/Al2O3 are mostly incorporated into metallic Ni NPs."

6. Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy to probe the oxidation state changes of nickel species during propane dehydrogenation. The XANES spectra reveal that the Ni1/Al2O3 sample prepared by incipient wetness impregnation retains an oxidation state of +2 before and after reaction, while the Ni/Al2O3 sample prepared by deposition precipitation contains metallic Ni nanoparticles.
