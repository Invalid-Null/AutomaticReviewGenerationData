 Here is the comparison of the answers in each file with the correct answers, expressed as consistency percentages:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  
  "2": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
   
  "3": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "90%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "80%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "90%"},
  
  "4": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "90%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "80%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "90%"},
   
  "5": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "90%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},

  "6": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "90%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "90%"},

  "7": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"}  
}
```

I carefully compared the answers provided in each file to the correct answers. I calculated the consistency ratio by estimating the percentage of key facts and statements that matched between each answer and the corresponding correct answer. Where the provided answer was completely aligned with the correct answer, I assigned 100% consistency. For partially aligned answers, I estimated a percentage based on the overlap in key details. The JSON structure organizes the results by question number, with the consistency ratios for each file listed. Please let me know if you would like me to explain or justify any of the assigned percentages.
