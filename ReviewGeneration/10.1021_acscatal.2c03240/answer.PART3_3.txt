[1] "In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments of the Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst during the reaction-regeneration process were conducted to reveal the specific changes of the Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst."

[2] "The Ni K-edge XAS spectra were collected in transmission mode using three ion chambers which allowed simultaneous measurement of the samples and a Ni foil reference." 

[3] "Scans were also collected for the Ni1/Al2O3 catalyst after treatments in 3% C3H8/He at 580 °C for 1 h and 20% O2/He at 600 °C for 1 h."

[1] "The XANES spectrum of Nin/Al2O3 shows a similar edge energy (8332.6 eV) to a Ni foil (Table 1), but the white line intensity is higher due to a small proportion of the Ni remaining oxidized."

[2] "The XANES of the Ni1/Al2O3 sample is similar to that of the NiO (Ni2+) reference, including the pre-edge feature near 8333 eV, as highlighted in the inset of Figure 2A." 

[3] "Based on the collective evidence, the Ni in Ni1/Al2O3 is present as isolated Ni(II) single sites, which are anchored on the surface of γ-Al2O3 through bonding to oxygen atoms, while the Ni atoms in Nin/Al2O3 are mostly incorporated into metallic Ni NPs."
