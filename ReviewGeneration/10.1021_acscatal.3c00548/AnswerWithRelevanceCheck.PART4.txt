 Unfortunately, upon reviewing the provided literature, I do not find any relevant information that directly addresses the questions asked. The literature focuses on bimetallic PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but does not substantially discuss the specific topics raised in the questions, such as process intensification approaches, techno-economic analysis, safety hazards, remaining challenges, computational screening methods, advanced characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures. 

As the provided answers do not contain relevant information to the questions asked, I will provide the following response indicating this:
