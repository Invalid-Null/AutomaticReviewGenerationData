[1] In this work, we have studied the structural features of three supported PtSn catalysts with different average particle sizes (ranging from 0.6 to 1.6 nm) and studied the structural features of the bimetallic PtSn species by electron microscopy and spectroscopy characterizations.

[2] Taking bimetallic PtSn catalysts as an example, which are the functional components in the industrial catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes into corresponding alkenes, different types of PtSn bimetallic species (SnOx-modified Pt clusters, small alloyed PtSn nanoparticles, and PtSn intermetallic nanoparticles) have been reported as efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction.

[3] As shown in Figure 1, the PtSn species prepared in those studies exhibit distinct geometric structures (particle size and morphology), compositions (Pt/Sn ratio), and chemical states of Sn species. Therefore, it will be interesting and also important to make a direct comparison among these PtSn species in terms of the structural features and discuss the structurereactivity relationship.

[4] Furthermore, the catalytic consequences of their size-dependent structural features are also reflected in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, showing that the subnanometer PtSn clusters are nearly 1-order magnitude more active than the PtSn alloy nanoparticles.

2. Yes, the article evaluates PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It studies three supported PtSn catalysts with different particle sizes from 0.6 to 1.6 nm and compares their structure and activity for propane dehydrogenation. The article shows that subnanometer PtSn clusters are nearly an order of magnitude more active than PtSn alloy nanoparticles for this reaction.

[1] In this study, three representative silica supports (amorphous SiO2, dealuminated Beta zeolite, and pure-silica MFI zeolite) are chosen as the solid carriers with different textural properties for accommodating the same amount of Pt and Sn species, resulting in the formation of supported PtSn catalysts with different structural features.

[2] The use of Beta zeolite as the support instead of amorphous silica can effectively decrease the size of PtSn particles from 1.6 nm down to 0.9 nm, leading to the formation of PtSn bimetallic nanoclusters in the PtSn/Beta-600H2 sample. 

[3] In the case of PtSn/MFI-600H2, subnanometer PtSn clusters located in the microporous channels are visualized in the high-resolution HAADF-STEM images with sizes of 0.50.6 nm.

6. Yes, the article evaluates MFI, Beta, and amorphous silica supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows that MFI and Beta zeolite supports result in smaller PtSn particle sizes (0.5-0.9 nm) compared to amorphous silica (1.6 nm), which impacts catalytic performance.
