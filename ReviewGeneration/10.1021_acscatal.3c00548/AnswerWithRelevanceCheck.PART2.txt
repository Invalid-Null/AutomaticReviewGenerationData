[1] In total, 2.5 g of the Si-Beta support was impregnated with an aqueous solution containing 74 mg SnCl4·5H2O, followed by drying at 60 C overnight and calcined at 560 C for 8 h. The powder mixture was then impregnated with an aqueous solution containing 18.3 mg H2PtCl6 and 28.6 mg KCl. After the impregnation of the metal precursors, the solid product was calcined at 350 C in static for 2 h. 
[2] The PtSn/MFI sample exhibits the highest specific activity (measured under kinetic region) for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, while the PtSn/Beta-600H2 and PtSn/SiO2-600H2 samples give the medium and lowest activity, respectively.

Yes, the articles evaluate supported PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. PtSn catalysts are synthesized on various supports like SiO2, Beta zeolite, and MFI zeolite. The PtSn/MFI catalyst with subnanometer PtSn clusters shows the highest propane dehydrogenation activity, about 10 times higher than PtSn nanoparticles on SiO2.

[1] Combining the results from theoretical and experimental studies, we can conclude that the Pt nanoparticles (>1 nm) have a higher capacity for accommodating Sn species than subnanometer Pt clusters, resulting in the formation of PtSn alloy nanoparticles, while the Pt clusters with small particle sizes tend to form Pt-rich clusters with low Sn contributions.
[2] These lessons could be further translated to other Pt-based bimetallic or even multi-metallic catalysts, (17) though the choice of the second metal as the co-catalyst (for instance, using Cu, In, Zn, or Ga instead of Sn) may influence the optimum size of the Pt sites. (16,5153)

One article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Sn in PtSn bimetallic catalysts. It shows larger Pt nanoparticles can accommodate more Sn to form PtSn alloy nanoparticles, while smaller Pt clusters are Pt-rich. Tuning the secondary metal and its interaction with Pt sites could optimize the catalyst structure and performance.

[1] In this study, three representative silica supports (amorphous SiO2, dealuminated Beta zeolite, and pure-silica MFI zeolite) are chosen as the solid carriers with different textural properties for accommodating the same amount of Pt and Sn species, resulting in the formation of supported PtSn catalysts with different structural features. 
[2] The use of Beta zeolite as the support instead of amorphous silica can effectively decrease the size of PtSn particles from 1.6 nm down to 0.9 nm, leading to the formation of PtSn bimetallic nanoclusters in the PtSn/Beta-600H2 sample.
[3] In the case of PtSn/MFI-600H2, subnanometer PtSn clusters located in the microporous channels are visualized in the high-resolution HAADF-STEM images with sizes of 0.50.6 nm.

Yes, the articles evaluate zeolite supports like MFI and Beta compared to amorphous silica for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The zeolite supports result in smaller PtSn particle sizes around 0.5-0.9 nm versus 1.6 nm on silica, impacting catalytic performance.
