[1] In total, 2.5 g of the Si-Beta support was impregnated with an aqueous solution containing 74 mg SnCl4·5H2O, followed by drying at 60 C overnight and calcined at 560 C for 8 h. The powder mixture was then impregnated with an aqueous solution containing 18.3 mg H2PtCl6 and 28.6 mg KCl. After the impregnation of the metal precursors, the solid product was calcined at 350 C in static for 2 h. 
[2] The PtSn/MFI sample exhibits the highest specific activity (measured under kinetic region) for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, while the PtSn/Beta-600H2 and PtSn/SiO2-600H2 samples give the medium and lowest activity, respectively.

2. Yes, the article evaluates PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It prepares PtSn catalysts supported on SiO2, Beta zeolite, and MFI zeolite. The MFI-supported PtSn shows the highest activity, while the SiO2-supported PtSn shows the lowest activity. This shows that smaller PtSn clusters confined in the MFI pores are more active than the larger PtSn nanoparticles formed on SiO2.

[2] As shown in Figures 6a and S28, the PtSn/MFI sample exhibits the highest specific activity (measured under kinetic region) for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, while the PtSn/Beta-600H2 and PtSn/SiO2-600H2 samples give the medium and lowest activity, respectively. Notably, the PtSn/MFI-600H2 sample comprising subnanometer PtSn clusters shows almost 1-order magnitude higher specific activity than the PtSn/SiO2-600H2 sample comprising alloyed PtSn nanoparticles.

[1] Combining the results from theoretical and experimental studies, we can conclude that the Pt nanoparticles (>1 nm) have a higher capacity for accommodating Sn species than subnanometer Pt clusters, resulting in the formation of PtSn alloy nanoparticles, while the Pt clusters with small particle sizes tend to form Pt-rich clusters with low Sn contributions. 

[2] These lessons could be further translated to other Pt-based bimetallic or even multi-metallic catalysts, (17) though the choice of the second metal as the co-catalyst (for instance, using Cu, In, Zn, or Ga instead of Sn) may influence the optimum size of the Pt sites. (16,5153)

<English version answer>  
3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic PtSn catalysts. It shows that larger Pt nanoparticles can accommodate more Sn to form PtSn alloy nanoparticles, while smaller Pt clusters tend to be Pt-rich with less Sn. It also suggests tuning the secondary metal and its interaction with Pt sites could optimize catalyst performance.

[1] In this work, we have studied the structural features of three supported PtSn catalysts with different average particle sizes (ranging from 0.6 to 1.6 nm) and studied the structural features of the bimetallic PtSn species by electron microscopy and spectroscopy characterizations.

[2] Taking bimetallic PtSn catalysts as an example, which are the functional components in the industrial catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes into corresponding alkenes, different types of PtSn bimetallic species (SnOx-modified Pt clusters, small alloyed PtSn nanoparticles, and PtSn intermetallic nanoparticles) have been reported as efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction.

[3] As shown in Figure 1, the PtSn species prepared in those studies exhibit distinct geometric structures (particle size and morphology), compositions (Pt/Sn ratio), and chemical states of Sn species. Therefore, it will be interesting and also important to make a direct comparison among these PtSn species in terms of the structural features and discuss the structurereactivity relationship.

[4] Furthermore, the catalytic consequences of their size-dependent structural features are also reflected in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, showing that the subnanometer PtSn clusters are nearly 1-order magnitude more active than the PtSn alloy nanoparticles.

[1] In this study, three representative silica supports (amorphous SiO2, dealuminated Beta zeolite, and pure-silica MFI zeolite) are chosen as the solid carriers with different textural properties for accommodating the same amount of Pt and Sn species, resulting in the formation of supported PtSn catalysts with different structural features.

[2] The use of Beta zeolite as the support instead of amorphous silica can effectively decrease the size of PtSn particles from 1.6 nm down to 0.9 nm, leading to the formation of PtSn bimetallic nanoclusters in the PtSn/Beta-600H2 sample. 

[3] In the case of PtSn/MFI-600H2, subnanometer PtSn clusters located in the microporous channels are visualized in the high-resolution HAADF-STEM images with sizes of 0.50.6 nm.
