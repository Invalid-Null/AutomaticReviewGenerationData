[1] In total, 2.5 g of the Si-Beta support was impregnated with an aqueous solution containing 74 mg SnCl4·5H2O, followed by drying at 60 C overnight and calcined at 560 C for 8 h. The powder mixture was then impregnated with an aqueous solution containing 18.3 mg H2PtCl6 and 28.6 mg KCl. After the impregnation of the metal precursors, the solid product was calcined at 350 C in static for 2 h. The PtSn/Beta-600H2 sample was obtained by reducing the calcined PtSn/Beta with H2 at 600 C for 3 h.

[2] As shown in Figures 6a and S28, the PtSn/MFI sample exhibits the highest specific activity (measured under kinetic region) for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, while the PtSn/Beta-600H2 and PtSn/SiO2-600H2 samples give the medium and lowest activity, respectively. Notably, the PtSn/MFI-600H2 sample comprising subnanometer PtSn clusters shows almost 1-order magnitude higher specific activity than the PtSn/SiO2-600H2 sample comprising alloyed PtSn nanoparticles.

2. Yes, the article evaluates PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It synthesizes PtSn catalysts supported on SiO2, Beta zeolite, and MFI zeolite. The PtSn/MFI catalyst with subnanometer PtSn clusters shows the highest activity, about 10 times higher than the PtSn/SiO2 catalyst with PtSn alloy nanoparticles.

[1] Combining the results from theoretical and experimental studies, we can conclude that the Pt nanoparticles (>1 nm) have a higher capacity for accommodating Sn species than subnanometer Pt clusters, resulting in the formation of PtSn alloy nanoparticles, while the Pt clusters with small particle sizes tend to form Pt-rich clusters with low Sn contributions. 

[2] These lessons could be further translated to other Pt-based bimetallic or even multi-metallic catalysts, (17) though the choice of the second metal as the co-catalyst (for instance, using Cu, In, Zn, or Ga instead of Sn) may influence the optimum size of the Pt sites. (16,5153)

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic PtSn catalysts. It shows that larger Pt nanoparticles can accommodate more Sn to form PtSn alloy nanoparticles, while smaller Pt clusters tend to be Pt-rich with less Sn. It also suggests tuning the secondary metal and its interaction with Pt sites could optimize catalyst performance.

3. 是的,文章研究了双金属PtSn催化剂中次要金属的电子和几何效应。它显示较大的Pt纳米粒子可以容纳更多的Sn形成PtSn合金纳米粒子,而较小的Pt簇团倾向于Pt富集和较少的Sn。它还建议调谐次要金属及其与Pt位点的相互作用可以优化催化剂性能。
