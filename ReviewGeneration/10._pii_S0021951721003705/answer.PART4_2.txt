<quotes>
[1] "So far there have been several successful examples where descriptor-based microkinetic analysis has been applied to enhance the understanding of the trends in heterogeneous catalysis and to rationally screen novel catalysts [19], [20], [22], [25], [26]."

[2] "Utilizing the limited number of descriptors to construct the volcano-shaped plots of activity and selectivity may eventually guide the investigation toward new materials with excellent catalytic performance while avoiding large-scale computational efforts [9], [23], [24]."
</quotes>
