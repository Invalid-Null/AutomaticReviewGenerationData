[1] "Thanks to the great progress that has been made in quantum chemical calculations, molecular-level understanding of the interactions between surface structures of a catalyst and intermediates as well as transition states for a certain reaction has been greatly enhanced [15]."

[2] "On the one hand, the development of microkinetic analysis may bridge the microscopic reaction mechanism and the macroscopic behavior of catalysts, offering the sufficient comprehension of structure-activity-selectivity relationships [16]." 

[3] "On the other hand, the advances in electronic structure theory help to discover scaling relations between adsorption energies of intermediates as well as transition states and other related parameters, making it possible to identify a few independent variables as descriptors to describe the catalytic behaviors of transition metals and transition-metal compounds [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]."

[1] "Closer examination of the adsorption behaviors of the transition-metal surfaces suggests that when there are carbon atom(s) in the adsorbates bonded to the metal surface via multiple metal-to-carbon bonds, as in the adsorbed CH3CH2C and CH3CCH3 (see Fig. 3a), the formation energies of the adsorbed species scale linearly with that of CH*."

[2] "As for the CH3CH2@(1 1 1), its formation energy is found to be linearly correlated with the formation energies of some unsaturated adsorbed hydrocarbons that have π bonds in gas-phase molecules, such as propylene and ethylene (see Fig. 3c)."

</quotes>

7. The article describes computational work that identified linear scaling relations between the formation energies of key adsorbed intermediates. These revealed that the energies of multi-bonded adsorbates scaled with methylidyne, while unsaturated hydrocarbons scaled with ethyl. This provided structure-activity relationships for catalyst screening.
