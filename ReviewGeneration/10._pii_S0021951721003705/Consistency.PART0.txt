 To compare the answers in the provided text files to the correct answers, I will:

1. Extract the English and Chinese answers from each text file. 

2. Compare them sentence-by-sentence to the correct answers.

3. Calculate a consistency ratio for each question and file as the percentage of sentences that match the correct answer.

4. Return the results in the requested JSON format with the consistency ratio for each file and question.

Here is the JSON result:
