</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "Comparing the catalytic performance between Fe3Ga1/γ-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3-supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts, one can see that the non-precious catalyst shows much better catalytic stability and selectivity than Pt/γ-Al2O3 and achieves similar catalytic activity as the Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst after 10 h of reaction."

[2] "In addition, some experimentally reported intermetallic compound catalysts that exhibit good catalytic performance (specifically high propylene selectivity), such as Ni3Ga1 [64], Pd3Fe1 [65], Pd1Zn1 [66], and Au1Ni1 [67], are also obtained by the descriptor-based microkinetic analysis and catalyst screening, which gives us confidence in our theoretical predications."

[3] "It has previously been demonstrated, however, that for the PDH reaction under-coordinated atoms on the commercially used Pt-based catalysts cannot be completely deactivated due to coke deposition and are expected to dominate the catalytic behavior of the catalyst despite having a much lower mole fraction than terraces on the catalyst surface [28], [42]."

[4] "Apart from these known candidates, the Fe-Ga intermetallic compounds are singled out as promising catalysts for PDH based on the volcano curves, as shown in Fig. 7b. In particular, Fe3Ga1 is found to be close to the summit of the volcano, showing relatively high activity for PDH. Furthermore, the propylene selectivity of the Fe3Ga1 intermetallic compound catalyst is much higher than that of Pt."

[5] "Comparing the catalytic performance between Fe3Ga1/γ-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3-supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts, one can see that the non-precious catalyst shows much better catalytic stability and selectivity than Pt/γ-Al2O3 and achieves similar catalytic activity as the Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst after 10 h of reaction."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 achieves similar activity but higher selectivity compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3. Other evaluated Pt alloys include Ni3Ga1, Pd3Fe1, Pd1Zn1, and Au1Ni1 which also give high propylene selectivity. The article notes under-coordinated Pt atoms dominate catalytic behavior despite lower surface concentration. Fe3Ga1 is identified as a promising non-precious catalyst with high activity and propylene selectivity.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,本文评估了Pt合金催化剂,如Pt-Sn用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显示Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3与Pt/γ-Al2O3相比,活性相似但选择性更高。其他评估的Pt合金还包括Ni3Ga1、Pd3Fe1、Pd1Zn1和Au1Ni1,这些合金也具有高的丙烯选择性。本文指出,尽管Pt原子的表面浓度更低,但未配位的Pt原子主导催化行为。Fe3Ga1被确定为一种具有高活性和丙烯选择性的有前途的非贵金属催化剂。
