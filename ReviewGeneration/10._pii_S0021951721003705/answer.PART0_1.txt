[1] "The traditional catalyst screening method is based on experiential trial-and-error tests, which requires a huge amount of manpower and financial resources. Thanks to the great progress that has been made in quantum chemical calculations, molecular-level understanding of the interactions between surface structures of a catalyst and intermediates as well as transition states for a certain reaction has been greatly enhanced [15]."

[2] "On the one hand, the development of microkinetic analysis may bridge the microscopic reaction mechanism and the macroscopic behavior of catalysts, offering the sufficient comprehension of structure-activity-selectivity relationships [16]." 

[3] "On the other hand, the advances in electronic structure theory help to discover scaling relations between adsorption energies of intermediates as well as transition states and other related parameters, making it possible to identify a few independent variables as descriptors to describe the catalytic behaviors of transition metals and transition-metal compounds [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]."
