1. Answer: No, the article does not compare the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts. It focuses on bimetallic and intermetallic compound catalysts.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
1. 答:不,本文没有比较金属与氧化物负载型金属催化剂的选择性配置文件。文中聚焦于双金属和金属间化合物催化剂。

<quotes>
[1] "Comparing the catalytic performance between Fe3Ga1/γ-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3-supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts, one can see that the non-precious catalyst shows much better catalytic stability and selectivity than Pt/γ-Al2O3 and achieves similar catalytic activity as the Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst after 10 h of reaction." 

[2] "In addition, Fig. 9b shows the result of the peak split fitting of the Ga 2p3/2 XPS spectra for the 14 h-spent catalyst. The peak of the Ga0 species at 1116.7 eV can be clearly observed on the spent catalyst [73]. However, the Ga species of the fresh catalyst was hardly reduced to Ga0 at 700 C in the reducing atmosphere of hydrogen."

[3] "The TEM measurement further provides evidence in support of the formation of the Fe3Ga1 intermetallic compound in the 14 h-spent catalyst (see Fig. 9c)."

2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows experimental data that Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 achieves similar activity but higher stability and selectivity compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3. XPS and TEM data indicate the formation of Fe3Ga1 intermetallic compound during reaction.

7. Answer: No, the article does not investigate the effects of tuning zeolite Si/Al ratio or incorporating mesoporosity on propane dehydrogenation catalyst performance, as it does not explore zeolite supports.
</English version answer>  

<Chinese version answer>  
7. 答:不,由于文中没有探索分子筛支持物,所以也没有研究调节分子筛Si/Al比或者引入介孔对丙烷脱氢催化剂性能的影响。
