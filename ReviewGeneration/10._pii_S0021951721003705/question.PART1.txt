Abstract
By using a descriptor-based microkinetic analysis combined with results from density functional theory calculations over eight transition-metal (including Ni, Cu, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, and Au) terrace and stepped surfaces, intermetallic compounds have been screened to search for inexpensive and environmentally friendly propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts with enhanced catalytic performance. Based on the scaling relations, the formation energies of ethyl on terrace and methylidyne on stepped surfaces are identified as two descriptors to represent the energetics of other reaction intermediates and transition sates. The derived PDH activity and propylene selectivity volcano curves not only provide a rational interpretation of the previously experimentally reported catalyst candidates, but also predict several unexpected binary combinations by screening 1482 A3B1 and 741 A1B1 intermetallic compounds. The non-precious Fe3Ga1 is then synthesized and evaluated. Its improved propylene selectivity and catalytic stability with respect to those of the Pt catalyst validates the theoretical predictions experimentally.

1. Introduction
Propylene, which is conventionally obtained from steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking, is an important feedstock for the production of various chemicals [1], [2]. Benefit from the development of hydraulic fracturing technologies in North America, a large amount of shale gas, including methane, ethane, and propane, can be extracted in a cost-effective manner [3], creating an opportunity for the development of the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology. The main industrial PDH processes are Oleflex and Catofin, utilizing Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, respectively [1], [4]. However, Pt is precious and Cr6+ is toxic and harmful to the environment, thus limiting their widespread use. Even worse, both of them suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition. As a result, there has been a considerable increase in the current research driven by the desire to search for inexpensive and environmentally friendly catalysts with improved dehydrogenation performance [5], [6].
Alloys are by far the most commonly studied dehydrogenation catalysts because of their well-defined, controllable properties and structures [1], [7]. Intermetallic compounds are homogeneous alloys that have definite properties and compositions [8]. Due to the interactions between different neighboring atoms, the catalytic performance of intermetallic compounds is generally satisfactory and often better than that of monometallic catalysts [9], [10]. For example, the selectivity and durability of Pt can be significantly improved by formation of Pt-based intermetallic compounds, such as PtSn [11], PtGo [12], PtIn [13], [14], etc. Considering the large number of elements available in the periodic table and their numerous possible combinations, the chemical and physical properties and catalytic behaviors of intermetallic compounds may readily change with the composition and atomic ordering. Among the many fundamental problems that remain unresolved in the field of light alkane dehydrogenation is whether there is a non-precious intermetallic compound that may exhibit better dehydrogenation performance than Pt-based catalysts.
The traditional catalyst screening method is based on experiential trial-and-error tests, which requires a huge amount of manpower and financial resources. Thanks to the great progress that has been made in quantum chemical calculations, molecular-level understanding of the interactions between surface structures of a catalyst and intermediates as well as transition states for a certain reaction has been greatly enhanced [15]. On the one hand, the development of microkinetic analysis may bridge the microscopic reaction mechanism and the macroscopic behavior of catalysts, offering the sufficient comprehension of structureactivity-selectivity relationships [16]. On the other hand, the advances in electronic structure theory help to discover scaling relations between adsorption energies of intermediates as well as transition states and other related parameters, making it possible to identify a few independent variables as descriptors to describe the catalytic behaviors of transition metals and transition-metal compounds [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Utilizing the limited number of descriptors to construct the volcano-shaped plots of activity and selectivity may eventually guide the investigation toward new materials with excellent catalytic performance while avoiding large-scale computational efforts [9], [23], [24].
So far there have been several successful examples where descriptor-based microkinetic analysis has been applied to enhance the understanding of the trends in heterogeneous catalysis and to rationally screen novel catalysts [19], [20], [22], [25], [26]. Jacobsen et al. singled out the CoMo alloy with high activity toward ammonia synthesis on the basis of the volcano-shaped relation between the adsorption energy of N and the catalytic activity [10]. By using the C and O adsorption energies as two descriptors, Studt et al. established the activity and selectivity maps for CO hydrogenation, and identified Cu-Ni alloys as the potential catalyst candidates by screening more than 1500 A3B1 and 700 A1B1 alloys [24]. In much the same way, Studt et al. also discovered the Ni-Ga intermetallic compounds are good catalyst candidates for CO2 reduction [9]. On the basis of the ethane dehydrogenation activity and ethylene selectivity volcano maps, Hansen et al. recently explained the varying catalytic performance of Pt-Sn alloys with different Sn contents [23]. More recently, Wang et al. screened transition-metal alloys for PDH based on the DFT results and microkinetics over the closed-packed metallic surfaces, with the formation energies of CH3CHCH2* and CH3CH2CH* used as two descriptors, and suggested that Ni3Mo is a promising catalyst for the reaction [27]. It has previously been demonstrated, however, that for the PDH reaction under-coordinated atoms on the commercially used Pt-based catalysts cannot be completely deactivated due to coke deposition and are expected to dominate the catalytic behavior of the catalyst despite having a much lower mole fraction than terraces on the catalyst surface [28]. As a result, consideration of the contributions of coordinatively unsaturated active sites to the PDH kinetics would be essential to a reasonably accurate description of the activity and selectivity maps for the reaction.
In this work, a descriptor-based microkinetic analysis combined with results from DFT calculations has been carried out to search for new and more effective intermetallic compound catalysts for PDH, in which the contributions of both terraces and steps to the kinetic behaviors have been taken into consideration. The scaling relations between the formation energies of the reaction intermediates involved in PDH on both the (1 1 1) and the (2 1 1) surfaces of 8 transition metals (including Ni, Cu, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, and Au) are first established to identify reactivity descriptors. Then, special efforts have been made to explain the physical principle behind the identification of the descriptors. Next, the volcano curves of PDH activity and propylene selectivity are obtained, which are the theoretical basis that can be used to screen catalysts. Then, a large number of A3B1 and A1B1 intermetallic compounds have been screened and the Fe3Ga1 is proposed as a promising catalyst candidate on account of its excellent catalytic performance and relatively low cost. After that, the activity and propylene selectivity over Fe3Ga1 and Pt are compared by performing full microkinetic analysis. Finally, to validate our theoretical predictions, Fe3Ga1 is synthesized, characterized, and tested for PDH, and the catalytic performance is compared with that on the supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts.
2. Methods
2.1. DFT calculations
The plane-wave DFT calculations were carried out with the VASP code [29], [30], [31]. Blchls all-electron-like projector augmented wave (PAW) method was employed to describe the interactions between ion cores and valence electrons [32]. A plane wave energy cutoff of 400 eV was used. Exchange and correlation in the Kohn-Sham theory were treated with the BEEF-vdW functional [33], which is a general-purpose exchange and correlation approximation with a reasonably reliable correction for van der Waals forces based on the vdW-DF2 functional. It was reported that the BEEF-vdW functional makes quantitatively accurate predictions of the energetics of covalently bound molecules on metal surfaces, such as ethylidyne on Pt(1 1 1) [34], [35], [36], and has been widely used to examine the dehydrogenation kinetics of light alkanes like ethane and propane [6], [13], [23], [37]. Brillouin zone sampling was performed by using a Monkhorst-Pack grid [38] and electronic occupancies were determined according to the Methfessel-Paxton scheme [39] with an energy smearing of 0.2 eV.
All the ground-state atomic geometries were optimized by minimizing the Hellman-Feynman forces with the conjugate-gradient algorithm [40] until the total forces acting on each atom were less than 0.03 eV/Å. Transition states were located by using the dimer method [41] and verified through vibrational analysis. The calculations on the systems involving magnetic Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni atoms were spin-polarized. The energies of gas-phase species involved in the reaction network has been corrected using the same method as that employed in our previous work [28].
Given the fact that both coordinatively saturated and unsaturated active sites may contribute to the overall kinetics of PDH (In reality, the coordinatively unsaturated active sites dominates the kinetics) [28], [42], a multifaceted kinetic model was used, where the (1 1 1) and (2 1 1) surfaces were used to represent the terrace and stepped facets on 8 face-centered cubic transition-metal catalysts (including Ni, Cu, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, and Au), respectively. The (1 1 1) and (2 1 1) surfaces were represented as a 5-layer slab with a p(3 × 3) supercell and a 15-layer slab with a p(1 × 3) supercell, respectively, where the bottom 2 and 6 layers were fixed to their crystal lattice positions. To minimize the periodic interactions in the direction perpendicular to the surface, the neighboring slabs were separated by a vacuum region of 12 Å in thickness. The Monkhorst-Pack grids of 5 × 5 × 1 and 5 × 3 × 1 were applied to sample the first Brillouin zone of the two slabs.
When deriving the values for the reactivity descriptors over intermetallic compound catalysts, a 5-, 16-, 5-, and 16-layer slab with a rectangular (23 × 2), p(1 × 2), rectangular (3 × 6), and p(1 × 2) supercell was used to represent the stoichiometric A3B1(1 1 1), A3B1(2 1 1), A1B1(1 1 0), and A1B1(2 1 0) surfaces, respectively. The bottom 2 and 7 layers were fixed to their crystal lattice positions for the terrace [(1 1 1) and (1 1 0)] and stepped [(2 1 1) and (2 1 0)] surfaces, respectively, where the Monkhorst-Pack grids of 5 × 7 × 1 and 5 × 5 × 1 were applied to sample the first Brillouin zone.
By taking the energies of carbon and hydrogen in the gas-phase methane and hydrogen, respectively, and that of the bare surface as the energy references, the formation energy of
in this work were calculated as [23], [43]

and

and
represent the numbers of C and H atoms in the adsorbed species, respectively. The details of the formation energy approach are given in Sec. S1 in the Supporting Information.
2.2. Microkinetic analysis
Descriptor-based microkinetic analysis was carried out using a modified Catalysis Microkinetic Analysis Package (CatMAP) Python module [25], which has been successfully applied in our previous work [28]. The enthalpy and entropy were estimated under the ideal gas [44] (for gas-phase species) and harmonic (for reaction intermediates and transition states) approximations, as implemented in the atomic simulation environment (ASE) Python package [45]. It should be noted that a single set of vibrational frequencies over the Pt catalyst were applied to all the monometallic surfaces [46]. The rate constant for the elementary steps involved in the reaction network was evaluated based on the transition state theory (TST). The turnover frequencies (TOFs) for the elementary steps were determined by invoking the steady-state approximation and by numerically solving the coupled differential equations [25], [47], [48]. The propylene selectivity was calculated as the propylene production rate divided by the propane consumption rate. The details of the TOF and selectivity calculations are included in Sec. S2 in the Supporting Information.
2.3. Catalyst preparation
Support γ-Al2O3 material was prepared by calcining pseudo-boehmite (Sasol, Germany) at 700 C under air atmosphere for 6 h. The supported Fe + Ga sample (10 wt%) was synthesized by a hydroxide deposition method using Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (99.99%, Aladdin) and Ga(NO3)3·xH2O (99.99%, Aladdin) as metal precursors. The synthesis process was carried out as follows. First, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was dissolved into 30 mL ultrapure water at 70 C and subsequently diluted NaOH solution (1 M) was used to adjust the pH to 2.0, where the Fe precursor was mainly transformed into a hydroxide-nitrate form. Second, γ-Al2O3 (1 g) was added into the solution and aged for 0.5 h. Third, specific amount of Ga(NO3)3·xH2O (Fe/Ga molar ratio of 3:1) was introduced and then transformed into the hydroxide-nitrate species by adjusting the pH to  4.0. Fourth, the mixed solution was aged for 0.5 h and then filtered and washed to minimize the effect of coexisting impurities. Finally, the resulting sample was dried at 110 C for 12 h.
For comparison, the supported Pt/γ-Al2O3 (1.0 wt% Pt loading) and Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 (1.0 wt% Pt and 2.4 wt% Sn loadings) catalysts [49], denoted as Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3, were prepared by an incipient-wetness impregnation method using H2PtCl6·6H2O (99.5%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd) and SnCl2 (98%, Sigma Aldric) precursors, where diluted aqueous solution (around 1 mL) of precursors was added dropwise onto 1.0 g of γ-Al2O3 support through a long manual stirring process. After aging for 12 h at room temperature, the impregnated sample was dried at 110 C for 8 h and then calcined at 500 C for 3 h.
2.4. Catalyst characterization
ICP-AES. The Fe, Ga, and Al contents were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (Agilent Varian 710-ES, USA). Catalysts were digested with aqua regia.
XRD. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of catalysts were recorded on an X-ray polycrystaline diffractometer (D8 Advance) using a monochromatic Cu K α radiation.
TEM. Transmission Electron Microscope images were performed on a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope instrument operated at 200 kV. High-angle annular dark field-high resolution transmission electron microscope images were collected on the instrument by an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The powder samples were prepared via dispersion in ethanol and spread over 400 mesh copper grids with thin carbon films.
2.5. Catalytic testing
PDH tests were performed on a μBenchCAT reactor (Altamira Instrument, USA) at 600 C and 1 bar. Prior to the reaction, 0.10 g of catalyst was loaded in the center of a quartz tube (6 mm inner diameter). The catalysts were heated to 600 C (10 C·min1), held in the Ar flow for 0.5 h. Hereafter, the reaction mixture (40 mL·min1) consisting of C3H8, H2, and Argon (C3H8 WHSV = 9.5 h1, C3H8/H2 = 1/1) was introduced to the reactor. The outlet products were analyzed online by a 4-channel Micro-GC (INFICON 3000, USA). Propane conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated as follows:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Scaling relations and reactivity descriptors
In this work, the complex reaction network of PDH was established based on our previous kinetic study [28], as shown in Scheme 1, consisting of 8 gas-phase reactants and products and 25 adsorbed species. The main and side reactions are composed of 60 elementary steps, including adsorption/desorption of gaseous species, (deep) dehydrogenation of reaction intermediates, and C-C bond cleavage of C2 and C3 species. The calculated formation energies of the most stable adsorption configuration of each reaction intermediate and the lowest-energy transition state for each elementary step are included in Sec. S3 in the Supporting Information. Based on these data, the energetics of the PDH reaction, including adsorption energies, reaction energies, and activation energies, can be readily obtained.

Scheme 1. Reaction Network for PDHa [28]. aAll elementary steps are considered reversible [28]. Adsorbed species are denoted by an asterisk.
It was reported that the energetics of reaction intermediates and transition states on heterogeneous catalyst surfaces are linearly correlated with each other [19], [20], [21], [50], which forms a basis for the identification of reactivity descriptor(s). In this work, we have performed one- and two-variable linear regressions to identify descriptor(s) and thus to reduce the dimensionality of the complicated PDH kinetics. In order to minimize the computational efforts required by the subsequent intermetallic compound catalyst screening, the reactivity descriptor(s) needs to be as simple as possible and are therefore chosen only among the formation energies of adsorbed C1 and C2 species in the present work. The formation energy of each adsorbate involved in the PDH reaction is then plotted against the formation energies of a given pair of C1 and/or C2 adsorbed species. If the two adsorbed species are the same, then one-variable linear regressions are essentially conducted.
Fig. 1a shows the calculated average value (
) of the squared Pearson correlation coefficients (
) for the linear scaling relations between the formation energies of the intermediates involved in the PDH reaction and the formation energies of a given pair of C1 and/or C2 adsorbed species. The logarithm of the variance,
, which measures the spread between the
values for the given pair of C1 and/or C2 adsorbed species, is presented in Fig. 1b. The details of the least-squares fitted lines on the 8 transition metals are included in Sec. S4 in the Supporting Information.

From Fig. 1a, one can see that when only one variable is used to linearly correlate with the formation energy of other adsorbed species, the
is generally very low (see the small triangles in the bottom layer in the figure), indicating that none of the energetic quantities alone can well describe the PDH kinetics. If we move on to the two-variable linear regressions, however, the formation energies of the adsorbed ethyl on the terrace [CH3CH2@(1 1 1)] and adsorbed methylidyne on the stepped surface [CH@(2 1 1)] can be identified as the two reactivity descriptors because of the relatively high
(0.973) and low
(3.133) values, as indicated by the red arrows in Fig. 1a and b. Thus, the formation energies of all the adsorbed species in the kinetic model can be expressed as a liner combination of the formation energies of CH3CH2@(1 1 1) and CH@(2 1 1):

Taking the formation energies of the adsorbed 2-propyl (CH3CHCH3*) on the (1 1 1) and (2 1 1) surfaces as an example, one can see from Fig. 2a and 2b that plotting the formation energies of the adsorbed 2-propyl against the two descriptors give straight lines with very high correlation coefficients; that is, the energetics of this key adsorbate in PDH can be well described by the identified descriptors.

Calculated formation energies of (a) CH3CHCH3@(1 1 1) and (b) CH3CHCH3@(2 1 1) as a function of the formation energies of CH3CH2@(1 1 1) and CH@(2 1 1); linear transition state energy scaling relations for the dehydrogenation of propane over the (c) (1 1 1) and (d) (2 1 1) surfaces, respectively; calculated formation energies of (e) CH3CH-HCH3@(1 1 1) and (f) CH3CH-HCH3@(2 1 1) as a function of the formation energies of CH3CH2@(1 1 1) and CH@(2 1 1).
As for the energetics of the transition states involved, one may use the transition state energy scaling relations, which express the formation energy of a transition-state species for an elementary step as a linear function of the formation energy of the initial or final state [21], [25]. As can be seen in Fig. 2c and 2d, the plots of the formation energies of the transition states for the dehydrogenation of propane (CH3CH-HCH3*) over the (1 1 1) and (2 1 1) surfaces against the final state energies yield straight lines, implying that the transition stats are rather final state-like. Moreover, the slopes of these linear scaling relations are close to 1, further demonstrating that the electronic structures of these transition states are similar to those of the final states. In reality, it is found that for the C-H and C-C bond scission reactions involved in PDH, the transition states are generally late, so most of the transition state energies are correlated with the final state energy in the present work. Since the formation energies of the final states can be expressed in terms of the two identified descriptors, it follows that the energetics of the transition states can be determined by a linear combination of the formation energies of CH3CH2@(1 1 1) and CH@(2 1 1), as shown in Fig. 2e and 2f. The details of the transition sate energy scaling relations established can be found in Sec. S4 in the Supporting Information.
3.2. Physical interpretation of the identified descriptors
While scaling relations are a good tool to identify descriptors, it is important to see why the formation energies of CH3CH2@(1 1 1) and CH@(2 1 1) can be used as the two reactivity descriptors for the PDH reaction; that is, the identified descriptors need be explainable by earlier theories. It has long been known that the adsorption energies of atomic C and O on transition metals are good descriptors of the kinetics of the reactions in C1 chemistry [51], [52], because the adsorbed species and activated complexes involved are bonded to the surface through C or O atom [19]. In this work, however, the application of the formation energies of CH3CH2@(1 1 1) and CH@(2 1 1) as the descriptors cannot be explained in such a straightforward way.
In reality, there are 8 pairs of C1 and/or C2 adsorbed species that have formation energies giving rise to even higher
and lower
values, including CH3CH2@(1 1 1)/CC@(1 1 1), CH3CH2@(1 1 1)/CHC@(1 1 1), CH3CH2@(1 1 1)/CC@(2 1 1), etc. The reason that CH3CH2@(1 1 1) and CH@(2 1 1) are eventually chosen is because the adsorption of CC and CHC may cause great geometrical distortions, especially on alloy surfaces, which makes it difficult to accurately predict the energetics and kinetics of the PDH reaction on the intermetallic compounds.
Closer examination of the adsorption behaviors of the transition-metal surfaces suggests that when there are carbon atom(s) in the adsorbates bonded to the metal surface via multiple metal-to-carbon bonds, as in the adsorbed CH3CH2C and CH3CCH3 (see Fig. 3a), the formation energies of the adsorbed species scale linearly with that of CH*. It is therefore not surprising to learn that the formation energy of CH* is one of the descriptors. This observation can be explained by the so called site-specific scaling relations [53], in which the adsorption energies of CH3 and C were found to scale better if the two species were both fixed at the atop site than when they are adsorbed at the most favorable sites (min-min scaling relations) [19], [53]. Thus, an even better chemisorption energy scaling relation is expected if the CH3CCH3 can be stabilized at the same 3-fold hollow site where CH is adsorbed, as can be seen in Fig. 3b.

Fig. 3. The reasoning behind the identification of the descriptors: (a) chemisorption energy scaling relations between the formation energies of CH@(2 1 1) and CH3CH2C@(2 1 1) as well as CH3CCH3@(2 1 1); (b) adsorption configurations of CH on (2 1 1) and CH3CH2 on (1 1 1); (c) chemisorption energy scaling relations between the formation energies of CH3CH2@(1 1 1) and CH3CHCH2@(1 1 1) as well as CH2CH2@(1 1 1); and (d) atomic orbital-resolved local density of states for propylene (C3H6) and ethylene (C2H4) in the gas-phase and adsorbed on Pt(1 1 1).
As for the CH3CH2@(1 1 1), its formation energy is found to be linearly correlated with the formation energies of some unsaturated adsorbed hydrocarbons that have π bonds in gas-phase molecules, such as propylene and ethylene (see Fig. 3c). The reasoning behind this remark is as follows. Propylene and ethylene, for example, prefer to be adsorbed on the catalyst surface in the di-σ mode, i.e., bridging two atop sites while CH3CH2* tends to be bound to the atop site via a metal-to-carbon σ bond (see Fig. 3b). Upon adsorption the π bond in the adsorbed alkenes would be broken, as reflected in the disappeared π and π* states shown in Fig. 3d. Thus, in the adsorbed alkenes and CH3CH2 the carbon atoms that are bonded to the metal atoms are all sp3-hybridized. The structural resemblance leads to the good linear scaling relations between the formation energies of these adsorbed species.
3.3. Volcano curves
Based on the scaling relations and the PDH reaction network in Scheme 1, a mean-field microkinetic model is built and solved numerically by invoking the steady-state approximation under the reactor inlet conditions (600 C, 0.17 bar of C3H8, and 0.17 bar of H2). The catalyst nanoparticles were taken as having an icosahedral shape and 10 nm in size, and the molar ratio of the step sites to the terrace sites is approximately 0.13 : 0.87, which was calculated according the relative occurrence of the various types of surface atoms and the catalyst particle radius [28]. The calculated TOFs on the nanoparticles were obtained by assuming no diffusion takes place between the surfaces (i.e., the reaction occurs independently on (1 1 1) and (2 1 1) [54]) and using a linear combination of the calculated TOF on each surface. In addition, on either of the two surfaces, a multi-site microkinetic model was used to show the different adsorption behaviors of different adsorbates on the catalyst surfaces, which has previously been successfully applied in our work [28] and in the literature [51], [55]. Specifically, the (1 1 1) surface is considered to be surrounded by one type of active sites (the terrace site which is labeled with t) and the (2 1 1) surface is dominated by two kinds of active sites, including the 4-fold hollow and step sites (labeled with f and s, respectively). Moreover, a hydrogen reservoir site is taken into account on both the two surfaces [labeled with ht and hs on (1 1 1) and (2 1 1), respectively] [56], [57], which is based on the idea that hydrogen is negligibly small and does not compete with other adsorbed species for adsorption sites.
The activity map for propane consumption is shown in Fig. 4a. One can see that the activity map shows a single maximum and among the elemental metals Pt is closest to the maximum and thus achieves the highest TOF. The catalytic activity of other catalysts varies in the order Rh  Ir > Ni  Pd > Cu > Au > Ag. The propylene selectivity map (see Fig. 4b) is defined as the propylene production rate divided by the propane consumption rate. In PDH, more attention should be paid to the propylene selectivity because it is a key factor in determining both the propylene yield and the catalyst stability [36], [58]. It is important to note that while Rh and Ir exhibit relatively high activity, the low selectivity restricts their application in PDH. If a compromise is made between catalytic activity and propylene selectivity, Pt is proposed to be the best monometallic catalyst, which provides a reasonable explanation for the application of Pt in industry [1].

Fig. 4. Volcano-shaped plots of (a) propane consumption rate and (b) propylene selectivity as a function of CH3CH2@(1 1 1) and CH@(2 1 1) formation energies; reaction conditions are at 600 C, 0.17 bar of C3H8, and 0.17 bar of H2; the kinetic simulation was conducted at zero propane conversion (i.e., at the inlet of the reactor) and, consequently, the approach to equilibrium is equal to zero.
It is important to note that there could be some discrepancies in the magnitude between the experimentally and theoretically determined activity and selectivity. However, in the descriptor-based microkinetic analysis, these discrepancies are considered to exist on all the metallic catalysts studied and can thus be offset in the whole model. Hence, one should focus on the trend in the catalytic performance across the catalysts based on the scaling relations and volcano curves. Here a similar decrease in the selectivity of monometallic catalysts (Pd > Ni > Pt > Rh > Ir) has also been reported in a previous study of ethane dehydrogenation [23], which demonstrates that the derived volcano curves in the present work can be used as a basis for searching for new and promising metallic catalysts.
3.4. Intermetallic compound catalysts screening
It is well known that the PDH system still leaves ample room for improvement in terms of cost and catalytic performance. Recently, Wang et al. [27] screened Pt-based alloys and 35 combinations of a few other elements for PDH, with the reaction network containing 20 elementary reactions of C3 species over coordinatively saturated (1 1 1) surface. In this work, 39 elements were selected as the components of the intermetallic compound catalysts, which are colored green in Fig. 5a. The intermetallic compounds include 1482 face-centered cubic A3B1 and 741 body-centered cubic A1B1. Only potentially stable intermetallic compounds, including 915 A3B1 and 498 A1B1 in which the binding energies are lower than + 0.2 eV per unit cell, are considered for further screening [59]. The binding energy of a given intermetallic compound catalyst (
) was defined as

and

The detailed values for the binding energies of the intermetallic compounds can be found in Sec. S5 in the Supporting Information.

To see if the established scaling relations can be applied to the d-block&d-block (d&d) and d-block&p-block (d&p) intermetallic compounds, the formation energies of CH3CHCH2 over Fe3Zn1(1 1 1), Ni3Cu1(1 1 1), Rh3Ni1(1 1 1), Pd3Au1(1 1 1), Pt3Ag1(1 1 1), Al3Au1(1 1 1), Ti3Ga1(1 1 1), Fe3Ga1(1 1 1), Pd3Sn1(1 1 1), and Pt3Sn1(1 1 1) and those of CH3CHCH3 over AAFe3Zn1(2 1 1), AANi3Cu1(2 1 1), AARh3Ni1(2 1 1), AAPd3Au1(2 1 1), AAPt3Ag1(2 1 1), AAAl3Au1(2 1 1), AATi3Ga1(2 1 1), AAFe3Ga1(2 1 1), AAPd3Sn1(2 1 1), and AAPt3Sn1(2 1 1) [AAA3B1 represents the A3B1 intermetallic compound with the AA step edge on the (2 1 1) surface] have been calculated and plotted in in Fig. 6a and 6b, where the black straight lines indicate the scaling relations obtained by making two-variable linear regressions on the 8 elemental metals. From the figure, one can see that the data on both the d&d and d&p intermetallic compounds fit the scaling relations quite well, and the formation energies of CH3CH2@(1 1 1) and CH@(2 1 1) are only needed to predict the catalytic performance of intermetallic compounds rather than full microkinetic modeling. Actually, some previous publications have shown that as long as the catalyst surface is transition metal-terminated, scaling relations between the adsorption energies of electronically similar adsorbates can hold over a wide variety of transition metal-based compounds [19], [22], [60], [61], [62], including transition-metal oxides, nitrides, and sulfides.

Fig. 6. Calculated formation energies of (a) CH3CHCH2@(1 1 1) and (b) CH3CHCH3@(2 1 1) as a function of the formation energies of CH3CH2@(1 1 1) and CH@(2 1 1) on d&d (red spheres) and d&p (blue spheres) intermetallic compounds and elemental metals (black squares); the black straight lines indicate the scaling relations obtained by making two-variable linear regressions on the 8 elemental metals. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
Various possible geometries of the adsorption configurations of CH3CH2@(1 1 1)/CH3CH2@(1 1 0) and CH@(2 1 1)/CH@(2 1 0) have been calculated (see Fig. S1) and the lowest formation energy on each surface is depicted in Fig. 7a (see blue dots and the corresponding values are given in Sec. S6 in the Supporting Information). One can see that compared with monometallic Pt, the Pt3Sn1 on the volcano curves has decreased catalytic activity but increased propylene selectivity [see Fig. 7b, the AAPt3Sn1 and ABPt3Sn1 represent the Pt3Sn1 intermetallic compound with pure Pt (AA) and PtSn (AB) step edge on the (2 1 1) surface, respectively], which is in line with the observations in the literature [11], [13], [63]. For instance, Kaylor et al. reported in their experiments that the addition of Sn to Pt can increase the selectivity toward propylene but decrease the initial propane conversion [49]. Hansen et al. also reported that in the ethane dehydrogenation the activity of Pt is higher than that of Pt3Sn, but the ethylene selectivity of Pt is lower than that of Pt3Sn [23]. Our previous DFT studies [11] suggested that with the increase in the Sn content, the d-band centers of surface Pt atoms are down-shifted, which gives rise to a less strong adsorption of propyl on the surface and a higher energy barrier for propane dehydrogenation, thus lowering the catalytic activity for PDH. Moreover, the introduction of Sn to Pt can lower the energy barrier for propylene desorption and simultaneously increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation, indicating that Pt-Sn has higher propylene selectivity than Pt.

Fig. 7. (a) Results of intermetallic compound catalyst screening for PDH and (b) the formation energies of descriptors of some experimentally reported intermetallic compound catalysts.
In addition, some experimentally reported intermetallic compound catalysts that exhibit good catalytic performance (specifically high propylene selectivity), such as Ni3Ga1 [64], Pd3Fe1 [65], Pd1Zn1 [66], and Au1Ni1 [67], are also obtained by the descriptor-based microkinetic analysis and catalyst screening, which gives us confidence in our theoretical predications.
Apart from these known candidates, the Fe-Ga intermetallic compounds are singled out as promising catalysts for PDH based on the volcano curves, as shown in Fig. 7b. In particular, Fe3Ga1 is found to be close to the summit of the volcano, showing relatively high activity for PDH. Furthermore, the propylene selectivity of the Fe3Ga1 intermetallic compound catalyst is much higher than that of Pt. The improved catalytic performance has been demonstrated by a full microkinetic analysis under the reaction conditions (see Fig. 8a and 8b). More importantly, both Fe and Ga have low toxicity and are earth-abundant elements [68], [69], [70], [71], and the experimental phase diagram also shows that the Fe3Ga1 catalyst can be stable at high reaction temperatures (see Fig. S2) [72], meaning that Fe3Ga1 may act as a non-precious and environmentally friendly PDH catalyst under the industrially relevant conditions.

Fig. 8. (a) Propane consumption rate and (b) propylene selectivity over Pt and Fe3Ga1 catalysts obtained from the full microkinetic analysis of PDH; (c) propane conversion and propylene selectivity over γ-Al2O3, Fe3Ga1/γ-Al2O3, Pt/γ-Al2O3 (1.0 wt% Pt loading), and Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 (1.0 wt% Pt and 2.4 wt% Sn loadings) catalysts for PDH.
To further validate the theoretical predictions, Fe3Ga1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was synthesized by a hydroxide deposition method [64]. The loading of Fe and Ga in the catalyst as determined by ICP-AES is 4.9 wt% and 2.1 wt%, respectively, giving rise to a Fe/Ga molar ratio of 3:1. The catalytic performance of the sample was tested at 600 C and the results are presented in Fig. 8c. It is found that the activity of PDH over the catalyst is quite low at the initial stage, mainly due to the presence of two mixed metal oxides, namely, FeOx and GaOx. As the reaction proceeds, the activity first increases with time and then reaches a stable conversion (20%) after 10 h of reaction. Interestingly, the propylene selectivity remains around 93%, very close to the theoretically predicted result (see Fig. 8b).
Comparing the catalytic performance between Fe3Ga1/γ-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3-supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts, one can see that the non-precious catalyst shows much better catalytic stability and selectivity than Pt/γ-Al2O3 and achieves similar catalytic activity as the Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst after 10 h of reaction. The prepared catalyst exhibits comparable or improved catalytic performance even in comparison with the industrially used catalysts under the similar reaction conditions (8996% selectivity at the 89% conversion on Pt-Sn/Al2O3 and 7894% selectivity at the 1332% conversion on CrOx/Al2O3) [64]. Considering the great price difference between the Fe- and Pt-based catalysts (the prices of the pure metals can be found in Sec. S8 in the Supporting Information), the Fe3Ga1/γ-Al2O3 is undoubtedly a very good catalyst for PDH. To test the role of the support, the PDH reaction was also carried out over the pure γ-Al2O3 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 8c. From the figure, one can see that although the propylene selectively over γ-Al2O3 is 6080%, there is rather low dehydrogenation activity detected. The results indicate that the good catalytic performance of Fe3Ga1/γ-Al2O3 cannot arise from the support.
The microstructures of the spent catalysts were then carefully characterized. The XRD results show that compared to the fresh Fe3Ga1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the spent catalysts give the Fe3Ga1(1 1 1) reflection peak at 2θ = 42.6 after 4 h of reaction (see Fig. 9a). In addition, Fig. 9b shows the result of the peak split fitting of the Ga 2p3/2 XPS spectra for the 14 h-spent catalyst. The peak of the Ga0 species at 1116.7 eV can be clearly observed on the spent catalyst [73]. However, the Ga species of the fresh catalyst was hardly reduced to Ga0 at 700 C in the reducing atmosphere of hydrogen. The TEM measurement further provides evidence in support of the formation of the Fe3Ga1 intermetallic compound in the 14 h-spent catalyst (see Fig. 9c). The TEM-EDS images of Fe and Ga indicate that the two metal species are well dispersed on the Al2O3 carrier. A line-scanning elemental composition analysis of the surface clusters further reveals the coexistence of Fe and Ga in the alloyed particles. More importantly, the two reflection spots and the measured crystalline lattice spacing of 2.125 Å are almost identical to those of the Fe3Ga1(1 1 1) plane (the tabulated value of 2.121 Å). Considering the results mentioned above, it is reasonable to deduce that the FeOx and GaOx can be simultaneously reduced into their metallic state to form a Fe3Ga1 intermetallic compound during the course of the reaction and the change in the catalytic performance can be attributed to the formation of the intermetallic phase.

4. Conclusions
A descriptor-based microkinetic analysis combined with results from DFT calculations over 8 elemental metals (including Ni, Cu, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, and Au) has been carried out to obtain the catalytic activity and propylene selectivity volcano curves of PDH. Among the elemental metals, Pt is suggested to be the best monometallic catalyst with both catalytic activity and selectivity considered, providing an explanation for its application in industry. Based on the derived maps using the formation energies of CH3CH2@(1 1 1) and CH@(2 1 1) as two descriptors, 1482 A3B1 and 741 A1B1 intermetallic compound catalysts have been screened and the inexpensive and environmentally friendly Fe-Ga intermetallic compounds are singled out as the promising catalyst candidates. The non-precious Fe3Ga1 intermetallic compound is then tested for PDH and its improved catalytic performance compared to that of Pt validates the theoretical predictions. These findings may render a starting point for the rational design and optimization of other novel catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation.
