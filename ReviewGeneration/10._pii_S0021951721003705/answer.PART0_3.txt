[1] "By using a descriptor-based microkinetic analysis combined with results from DFT calculations over 8 transition-metal (including Ni, Cu, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, and Au) terrace and stepped surfaces, intermetallic compounds have been screened to search for inexpensive and environmentally friendly propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts with enhanced catalytic performance."

[2] "The plane-wave DFT calculations were carried out with the VASP code [29], [30], [31]. Blchls all-electron-like projector augmented wave (PAW) method was employed to describe the interactions between ion cores and valence electrons [32]." 

[3] "Exchange and correlation in the Kohn-Sham theory were treated with the BEEF-vdW functional [33], which is a general-purpose exchange and correlation approximation with a reasonably reliable correction for van der Waals forces based on the vdW-DF2 functional."

[1] "The catalytic activity of other catalysts varies in the order Rh ≈ Ir > Ni ≈ Pd > Cu > Au > Ag. The propylene selectivity map (see Fig. 4b) is defined as the propylene production rate divided by the propane consumption rate." 

[2] "By using the formation energies of CH3CH2@(1 1 1) and CH@(2 1 1) as two descriptors, 1482 A3B1 and 741 A1B1 intermetallic compound catalysts have been screened and the inexpensive and environmentally friendly Fe-Ga intermetallic compounds are singled out as the promising catalyst candidates."

6. The article presents microkinetic modeling efforts that have provided insights into propane dehydrogenation kinetics. Specifically, it used formation energies of adsorbed species as descriptors to screen intermetallic compound catalysts and rank their predicted catalytic activity. Propylene selectivity was also calculated from propylene and propane rate equations.

[1] "The scaling relations between the formation energies of the reaction intermediates involved in PDH on both the (1 1 1) and the (2 1 1) surfaces of 8 transition metals (including Ni, Cu, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, and Au) are first established to identify reactivity descriptors."

[2] "The formation energy of each adsorbate involved in the PDH reaction is then plotted against the formation energies of a given pair of C1 and/or C2 adsorbed species. If the two adsorbed species are the same, then one-variable linear regressions are essentially conducted." 

[3] "From Fig. 1a, one can see that when only one variable is used to linearly correlate with the formation energy of other adsorbed species, the R2 is generally very low (see the small triangles in the bottom layer in the figure), indicating that none of the energetic quantities alone can well describe the PDH kinetics."

[4] "If we move on to the two-variable linear regressions, however, the formation energies of the adsorbed ethyl on the terrace [CH3CH2@(1 1 1)] and adsorbed methylidyne on the stepped surface [CH@(2 1 1)] can be identified as the two reactivity descriptors because of the relatively high R2 (0.973) and low ln(σ2) (3.133) values, as indicated by the red arrows in Fig. 1a and b."
