<quotes>
[1] "In this work, a descriptor-based microkinetic analysis combined with results from DFT calculations has been carried out to search for new and more effective intermetallic compound catalysts for PDH, in which the contributions of both terraces and steps to the kinetic behaviors have been taken into consideration."

[2] "The derived PDH activity and propylene selectivity volcano curves not only provide a rational interpretation of the previously experimentally reported catalyst candidates, but also predict several unexpected binary combinations by screening 1482 A3B1 and 741 A1B1 intermetallic compounds."

[3] "To further validate the theoretical predictions, Fe3Ga1/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was synthesized by a hydroxide deposition method [64]."
