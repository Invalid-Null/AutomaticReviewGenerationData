To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the answers in each file to the correct answers provided. I assessed whether the key points were captured or not in each answer to assign a consistency percentage. For question 5, some files had partial or no matches resulting in lower consistency ratios. But for most questions, the answers were fully consistent across files.
