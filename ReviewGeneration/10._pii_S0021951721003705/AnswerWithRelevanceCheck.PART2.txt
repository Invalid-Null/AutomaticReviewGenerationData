         Answer: The article does not compare the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses more on evaluating bimetallic and intermetallic compound catalysts.

         [1] "It was reported that the addition of Sn to Pt can increase the selectivity toward propylene but decrease the initial propane conversion [11], [13], [63]."

         [2] "Hansen et al. also reported that in the ethane dehydrogenation the activity of Pt is higher than that of Pt3Sn, but the ethylene selectivity of Pt is lower than that of Pt3Sn [23]."

         [3] "Comparing the catalytic performance between Fe3Ga1/γ-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3-supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts, one can see that the non-precious catalyst shows much better catalytic stability and selectivity than Pt/γ-Al2O3 and achieves similar catalytic activity as the Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst after 10 h of reaction."

         [4] "In addition, Fig. 9b shows the result of the peak split fitting of the Ga 2p3/2 XPS spectra for the 14 h-spent catalyst. The peak of the Ga0 species at 1116.7 eV can be clearly observed on the spent catalyst [73]. However, the Ga species of the fresh catalyst was hardly reduced to Ga0 at 700 C in the reducing atmosphere of hydrogen."

         [5] "The TEM measurement further provides evidence in support of the formation of the Fe3Ga1 intermetallic compound in the 14 h-spent catalyst (see Fig. 9c)."

         Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt3Sn has lower activity but higher propylene selectivity compared to Pt. Other evaluated Pt alloys include Ni3Ga1, Pd3Fe1, Pd1Zn1, and Au1Ni1 which also give high propylene selectivity. Experimental data shows Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 achieves similar activity but higher stability and selectivity compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3. XPS and TEM data indicate the formation of Fe3Ga1 intermetallic compound during reaction.

         是的,本文评估了Pt合金催化剂,如Pt-Sn用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供的数据显示Pt3Sn的活性较Pt低,但丙烯选择性较高。其他评估的Pt合金还包括Ni3Ga1、Pd3Fe1、Pd1Zn1和Au1Ni1,这些合金也具有高的丙烯选择性。实验数据表明,与Pt/γ-Al2O3相比,Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3具有类似的活性,但更高的稳定性和选择性。XPS和TEM数据表明Fe3Ga1金属间化合物是在反应过程中形成的。

         Answer: No, the article does not describe any synergistic effects between metals in bimetallic or alloy catalysts attributed to ensemble and/or ligand effects. It does not investigate the synergistic effects in detail.

         Answer: No, the article does not evaluate any zeolite supports like MFI, FER, or BEA structures for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It focuses on alumina-supported catalysts.

         Answer: No, the article does not investigate the effects of tuning zeolite Si/Al ratio or incorporating mesoporosity on propane dehydrogenation catalyst performance, as it does not explore zeolite supports.
       </English>
       <Chinese>
         答:由于文中没有探索分子筛支持物,所以也没有研究调节分子筛Si/Al比或者引入介孔对丙烷脱氢催化剂性能的影响。
