[1] "On the one hand, the development of microkinetic analysis may bridge the microscopic reaction mechanism and the macroscopic behavior of catalysts, offering the sufficient comprehension of structure-activity-selectivity relationships [16]." 

[2] "On the other hand, the advances in electronic structure theory help to discover scaling relations between adsorption energies of intermediates as well as transition states and other related parameters, making it possible to identify a few independent variables as descriptors to describe the catalytic behaviors of transition metals and transition-metal compounds [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]."

[1] "Utilizing the limited number of descriptors to construct the volcano-shaped plots of activity and selectivity may eventually guide the investigation toward new materials with excellent catalytic performance while avoiding large-scale computational efforts [9], [23], [24]."

[2] "In this work, the formation energies of CH3CH2@(1 1 1) and CH@(2 1 1) are identified as two reactivity descriptors because of the relatively high R2 (0.973) and low ln(σ2) (3.133) values, as indicated by the red arrows in Fig. 1a and b."
