[1] Propylene, which is conventionally obtained from steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking, is an important feedstock for the production of various chemicals.

[2] Benefit from the development of hydraulic fracturing technologies in North America, a large amount of shale gas, including methane, ethane, and propane, can be extracted in a cost-effective manner, creating an opportunity for the development of the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology.  

[3] The main industrial PDH processes are Oleflex and Catofin, utilizing Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, respectively. However, Pt is precious and Cr6+ is toxic and harmful to the environment.

[4] Even worse, both of them suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition.

[5] Intermetallic compounds are homogeneous alloys that have definite properties and compositions. Due to the interactions between different neighboring atoms, the catalytic performance of intermetallic compounds is generally satisfactory and often better than that of monometallic catalysts.

[6] The traditional catalyst screening method is based on experiential trial-and-error tests, which requires a huge amount of manpower and financial resources. 

[7] Thanks to the great progress that has been made in quantum chemical calculations, molecular-level understanding of the interactions between surface structures of a catalyst and intermediates as well as transition states for a certain reaction has been greatly enhanced.

[8] On the one hand, the development of microkinetic analysis may bridge the microscopic reaction mechanism and the macroscopic behavior of catalysts, offering the sufficient comprehension of structure-activity-selectivity relationships.

[9] On the other hand, the advances in electronic structure theory help to discover scaling relations between adsorption energies of intermediates as well as transition states and other related parameters, making it possible to identify a few independent variables as descriptors to describe the catalytic behaviors of transition metals and transition-metal compounds.
