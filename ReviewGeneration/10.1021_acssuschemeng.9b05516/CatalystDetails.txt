 Based on my analysis of the supplied document, it does not appear to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document focuses on assessing different production routes for propylene, including steam cracking of naphtha, propane dehydrogenation, and methanol-to-propylene processes. While propane dehydrogenation is briefly mentioned, the document does not provide any details about specific catalysts used for this process.
