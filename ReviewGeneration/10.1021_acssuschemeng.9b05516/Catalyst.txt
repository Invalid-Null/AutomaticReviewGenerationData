The given document is not directly related to propane dehydrogenation. It is a review article comparing different routes for propylene production, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH), but PDH is not the main focus. The document mentions various catalysts but does not go into details about their composition or active sites. Since the document is not primarily about propane dehydrogenation, I have no specific catalysts to list.
