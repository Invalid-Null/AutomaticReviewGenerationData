 The provided document does not appear to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation, as it does not mention propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document discusses catalysis research at various DOE national laboratories, covering a wide range of catalysis topics beyond just propane dehydrogenation. Since the document does not seem directly related to propane dehydrogenation, I will not enumerate catalysts or attempt to analyze them in the context of propane dehydrogenation.
