 Unfortunately, this document does not appear to be related to propane dehydrogenation based on my reading. The document discusses catalysis research at various U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories, covering a wide range of catalysis topics beyond just propane dehydrogenation. Since the document does not seem focused on propane dehydrogenation specifically, I cannot provide the requested details about catalysts mentioned in that context.
