[1] Notably, the 100 nm TiO2 is stable enough not to agglomerate (the BET surfaces are similar before and after the high temperature reaction, as shown in Table S3).
[2] According to Samuels research, (22) the reduced TiO2x through hydrogen thermal treatment showed disorder in surface layers, known as Black TiO2. (21)
[3] For the fresh TiO2 sample, the formation of oxygen-containing compounds (H2O, CO, CO2) illustrates the consumption of lattice oxygen above 400 C. However, no H2O and only little COx were observed for the spent TiO2 sample, indicating that the spent TiO2x was basically stable after the induction period of in situ PDH reaction.

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of TiO2 nanoparticles affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that nanosized TiO2 can be reduced in situ during propane dehydrogenation to form oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Ti3+ sites, which are active for the reaction. The mobility of lattice oxygen to form vacancies is found to be dependent on particle size, with smaller nanoparticles showing higher activity due to enhanced oxygen mobility. Excessive reduction leading to bulk oxygen vacancies however causes deactivation.

2. 是的,该文探究了调控TiO2纳米粒子的氧化态、氧原子迁移性以及酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢反应性能。结果表明,纳米TiO2可以在丙烷脱氢反应中原位还原形成氧空位和配位不饱和的Ti3+位,这些位都是反应活跃位。氧原子的迁移性对形成氧空位具有决定性作用,其与纳米粒子的大小有关,更小的纳米粒子由于氧原子迁移性更高而活性更好。但是,过度还原导致体相氧空位的形成会使催化剂失活。

[1] According to Kondratenkos research, (19,20) coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations in ZrO2 are responsible for CH bond activation. Similarly, we suggest that the consumption of lattice oxygen leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies and Ticus sites, as active sites for PDH, which result in the increase of C3H8 conversion in the induction period.

[2] With the purpose to derive molecular insights into the catalytic active sites for PDH over anatase TiO2x, we performed DFT calculations on TiO2(101) surfaces, as the (101) facet represents the most stable surface plane. 

[3] After two CH bond breakings, C3H6 and OH species were formed on the s-TiO2(101) surface. It is an endothermic process (0.13 eV) for propene desorption. The remaining OH species on the TiO2(101) surface may form H2 to restore the catalyst surface or form H2O to generate oxygen vacancy.

3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over TiO2 nanoparticles where lattice oxygen is consumed to create oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Ti3+ sites which activate C-H bonds, eventually leading to propene formation. DFT calculations explore propane dehydrogenation steps on TiO2(101) surfaces, showing Ti3+/O2- pairs cleave the first C-H bond, while Ti3+ sites strongly bind and activate the second C-H bond to release propene.

3. 是的,该文提出了一个TiO2纳米粒子上丙烷脱氢的机理场景,即消耗晶格氧原子形成氧空位和配位不饱和的Ti3+位,这些位激活C-H键,最终导致丙烯的形成。DFT计算探究了TiO2(101)表面上的丙烷脱氢步骤,结果表明Ti3+/O2- 导致第一C-H键断裂,而Ti3+位强烈吸附并激活第二个C-H键从而释放丙烯。
