2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of TiO2 affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that reducing TiO2 can create oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Ti cations that act as Lewis acid sites for C-H bond activation and dehydrogenation. Oxygen mobility from bulk to surface is important for generating these active sites.

[1] "According to Kondratenkos research, (19,20) coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations in ZrO2 are responsible for CH bond activation. Similarly, we suggest that the consumption of lattice oxygen leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies and Ticus sites, as active sites for PDH, which result in the increase of C3H8 conversion in the induction period."

[2] "The DFT calculation results also demonstrated that the O2c vacancy formation should overcome corresponding high energy barrier (3.33 eV) through the H transfer of hydroxyl species and desorption of H2O on the s-TiO2(101) surface (Figure S16). So, the Ostwald ripening process was crucial to the in situ formation of Ticus for catalyzing the PDH reaction and it is significantly influenced by the particle size of TiO2."

[3] "After two CH bond breakings, C3H6 and OH species were formed on the s-TiO2(101) surface. It is an endothermic process (0.13 eV) for propene desorption. The remaining OH species on the TiO2(101) surface may form H2 to restore the catalyst surface or form H2O to generate oxygen vacancy (Figure S16)."

3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over TiO2 catalysts.

[1] The reduction degree of the 1025 nm TiO2 sample was controlled by different CO pre-reduction times at 550 C. The C3H6 formation rates (r(C3H6)), including initial r(C3H6) and final r(C3H6), increased at first and then decreased with CO reduction time (Figure 5b). So, the formation of Ticus and oxygen vacancies by appropriate reduction is beneficial to PDH performance, but the over-reduction would destroy effective active sites of PDH. (22) 
</quotes>

<English version answer>
2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states of TiO2 affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that formation of Ti3+ cations (Ticus) and oxygen vacancies by moderate reduction improves PDH activity, but over-reduction destroys active sites and causes deactivation.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
2. 是的,该文探讨了调节TiO2的氧化状态如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它表明,适度还原形成Ti3+阳离子(Ticus)和氧空位可以提高丙烷脱氢活性,但过度还原会破坏活性中心导致失活。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] The reaction process of propane dehydrogenation to propene over TiO2(101) surfaces mainly contain two CH bond breaking steps: the first step is methylene CH bond activation of the C3H8 and the second step is methyl CH bond cleavage of isopropyl (CH3CHCH3).

[2] However, the situation is extremely different for the propene formation. We find that the second CH bond cleavage is strongly favored by Ticus cations over the d-TiO2(101) surface (C2 to D2 in Figure 13). It is an exothermic process (0.68 eV), and the activation barrier is 1.27 eV (TS2, Figure 12) lower than that over the s-TiO2(101) surface (TS2, Figure 12). The Ticus cations mainly affect the activation barrier of the second CH bond breaking, as Ticus atoms have significant influence on hydrogen chemisorption (Table S2) and hydrogen chemisorption energies determine the activation barriers.

<English version answer>
3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over TiO2 catalysts. It involves two CH bond cleavage steps, with the second CH bond cleavage of isopropyl to propene being facilitated by Ticus active sites on the reduced TiO2 surface. Ticus strongly chemisorbs hydrogen and lowers the barrier for breaking the C-H bond.

3. 是的,该文提出了丙烷在TiO2催化剂上的脱氢机理。它包含两步CH键断裂,其中异丙基到丙烯的第二步CH键断裂是由还原的TiO2表面上的Ticus活性中心所促进的。Ticus强烈化学吸附氢原子,降低了断裂C-H键的能垒。

[1] Notably, the 100 nm TiO2 is stable enough not to agglomerate (the BET surfaces are similar before and after the high temperature reaction, as shown in Table S3).
[2] According to Samuels research, (22) the reduced TiO2x through hydrogen thermal treatment showed disorder in surface layers, known as Black TiO2. (21)
[3] For the fresh TiO2 sample, the formation of oxygen-containing compounds (H2O, CO, CO2) illustrates the consumption of lattice oxygen above 400 C. However, no H2O and only little COx were observed for the spent TiO2 sample, indicating that the spent TiO2x was basically stable after the induction period of in situ PDH reaction.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of TiO2 nanoparticles affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that nanosized TiO2 can be reduced in situ during propane dehydrogenation to form oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Ti3+ sites, which are active for the reaction. The mobility of lattice oxygen to form vacancies is found to be dependent on particle size, with smaller nanoparticles showing higher activity due to enhanced oxygen mobility. Excessive reduction leading to bulk oxygen vacancies however causes deactivation.

2. 是的,该文探究了调控TiO2纳米粒子的氧化态、氧原子迁移性以及酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢反应性能。结果表明,纳米TiO2可以在丙烷脱氢反应中原位还原形成氧空位和配位不饱和的Ti3+位,这些位都是反应活跃位。氧原子的迁移性对形成氧空位具有决定性作用,其与纳米粒子的大小有关,更小的纳米粒子由于氧原子迁移性更高而活性更好。但是,过度还原导致体相氧空位的形成会使催化剂失活。

[1] According to Kondratenkos research, (19,20) coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations in ZrO2 are responsible for CH bond activation. Similarly, we suggest that the consumption of lattice oxygen leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies and Ticus sites, as active sites for PDH, which result in the increase of C3H8 conversion in the induction period.

[2] With the purpose to derive molecular insights into the catalytic active sites for PDH over anatase TiO2x, we performed DFT calculations on TiO2(101) surfaces, as the (101) facet represents the most stable surface plane. 

[3] After two CH bond breakings, C3H6 and OH species were formed on the s-TiO2(101) surface. It is an endothermic process (0.13 eV) for propene desorption. The remaining OH species on the TiO2(101) surface may form H2 to restore the catalyst surface or form H2O to generate oxygen vacancy.

3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over TiO2 nanoparticles where lattice oxygen is consumed to create oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Ti3+ sites which activate C-H bonds, eventually leading to propene formation. DFT calculations explore propane dehydrogenation steps on TiO2(101) surfaces, showing Ti3+/O2- pairs cleave the first C-H bond, while Ti3+ sites strongly bind and activate the second C-H bond to release propene.
