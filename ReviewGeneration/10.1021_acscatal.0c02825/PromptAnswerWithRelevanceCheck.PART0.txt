 <quotes>

[1] Propylene is one of key basic feedstock for the manufacture of various products such as polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs.

[2] Because of the growing demand for propylene and the huge reserves of shale gas and natural gas, in which propane is one of the main components, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes an increasingly important technology for the production of propylene. 

[3] For the main commercial catalysts (supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts) of PDH, the Pt is high cost and Cr6+ is highly toxic, effective measures must be taken to avoid harm to human body and environment in the production, use, and treatment of catalysts, which force researchers to find new catalysts.

<quotes>

[1] For the non-oxidative PDH process, the standard Gibbs free energy change is positive. 

[2] The reaction requires high reaction temperature (≥550°C) to achieve high conversion of propane.

[3] However, as the PDH reaction is endothermic, the conversion of propane is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium.

[4] The reaction rates of propane dehydrogenation are relatively slow due to the high activation barriers for C-H and C-C bond cleavage.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is thermodynamically limited, being endothermic with positive free energy change.

Quantitative thermodynamic and kinetic details are not provided.

[1] Propylene is one of key basic feedstock for the manufacture of various products such as polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs. (1,2) Because of the growing demand for propylene and the huge reserves of shale gas and natural gas, in which propane is one of the main components, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes an increasingly important technology for the production of propylene.

[2] For the main commercial catalysts (supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts) of PDH, the Pt is high cost and Cr6+ is highly toxic, effective measures must be taken to avoid harm to human body and environment in the production, use, and treatment of catalysts, which force researchers to find new catalysts. (3)

[3] The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst is universally used in the industrial PDH process, however, the high price of Pt and inevitable deactivation limit its large-scale application. To find an alternative to PtSn-based catalysts, extensive efforts have been made to develop supported metal oxide-based catalysts as potential low-cost options for replacing PtSn, including transition metal oxides (TMOs) of Cr, Ga, V, Fe, Zn, Sn etc.

[4] The reaction process of propane dehydrogenation to propene over TiO2(101) surfaces mainly contain two CH bond breaking steps: the first step is methylene CH bond activation of the C3H8 and the second step is methyl CH bond cleavage of isopropyl (CH3CHCH3).

</quotes>

<English version answer>

1. The article provides background that propylene is an important basic chemical feedstock used for polymers, solvents, resins etc. There is growing demand for propylene production, and propane dehydrogenation is an increasingly important process to produce propylene from abundant propane reserves. 

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by reducing the activation energy barriers for C-H bond cleavage steps. Specific mechanisms involve metal-oxygen pairs in metal oxides that can stabilize transition states and weaken C-H bonds through 4-centered interactions.

3. The article introduces supported PtSn alloys and Cr-based oxides as current industrial PDH catalysts, but there is need to explore new alternatives like Ga, V, Fe, Zn, Sn oxides since Pt is expensive and Cr is toxic.

4. The article discusses the thermodynamic constraint that dehydrogenation is endothermic, and provides kinetic details that propane dehydrogenation occurs through two C-H bond cleavages, first methylene and then methyl C-H bonds.

5. No, the article does not describe DFT calculations of PDH mechanisms.

6. No, the article does not present microkinetic modeling of PDH kinetics. 

7. No, the article does not provide computational or experimental structure-activity relationships for PDH catalysts.

 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that directly address the questions asked. However, I can attempt to provide some general background information based on my knowledge:

<English version answer>

1. The article does not provide specific background details on the importance and applications of propylene. Propylene is a key chemical feedstock used to produce polypropylene plastics, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and other chemicals. 

2. The article does not explain general catalyst mechanisms for lowering activation barriers. Catalysts provide alternative reaction pathways with lower energy barriers. Heterogeneous catalysts can stabilize transition states through interactions at active sites.

3. The article does not introduce major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation. Common catalysts include supported Pt-Sn, CrOx, and zeolites. Recently metal oxides like Ga- and V-oxides have shown promise.

4. The article does not provide quantitative thermodynamic or kinetic details on propane dehydrogenation. It is an endothermic reaction limited by kinetic constraints. High temperatures favor the thermodynamics but also accelerate deactivation.

5. The article does not describe prior DFT studies of propane dehydrogenation mechanisms. DFT can provide insights into reaction intermediates and transition states interacting with catalyst active sites.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation. Microkinetic models incorporate elementary steps and can fit kinetic data.

7. The article does not reveal any structure-activity relationships from computational or experimental studies. Relating catalyst descriptors to turnover rates can guide optimization.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

1. 该文献没有提供丙烯的重要性和应用的具体背景细节。丙烯是用于生产聚丙烯塑料、丙烯腈、丙烯醇和其他化学品的关键化学原料。

2. 该文献没有解释降低活化能垒的一般催化剂机制。催化剂提供了较低能量垒的替代反应途径。异质催化剂可以通过与活性位点的相互作用稳定过渡态。

3. 该文献没有介绍探索丙烷脱氢的主要催化剂类别。 常见的催化剂包括负载Pt-Sn, CrOx和分子筛。近年来,诸如Ga-和V-氧化物等金属氧化物显示了前景。

4. 该文献没有提供丙烷脱氢的定量热力学或动力学细节。这是一个内吸热反应,受动力学约束的限制。高温有利于热力学平衡,但也会加速失活。

5. 该文献没有描述丙烷脱氢机理的先前DFT研究。 DFT可以提供反应中间体和过渡态与催化剂活性位点相互作用的见解。

6. 该文献没有提供任何丙烷脱氢的微观动力学建模。微观动力学模型结合了基元步骤,并可以拟合动力学数据。

7. 该文献没有揭示从计算或实验研究中得出的任何结构-活性关系。 将催化剂描述子与周转数联系起来可以指导优化。
