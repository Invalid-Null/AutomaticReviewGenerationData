[1] "Especially, for the TiO2 catalyst under a high temperature and reducible atmosphere (C3H8 and its derivative), the in situ formation process and dynamic change of surface active sites during PDH reaction are still ambiguous."

[2] "With the purpose to derive molecular insights into the catalytic active sites for PDH over anatase TiO2x, we performed DFT calculations on TiO2(101) surfaces, as the (101) facet represents the most stable surface plane."

[3] "To investigate the morphologies and nanosize change before and after the PDH reaction, SEM and TEM images of the fresh TiO2 and spent 5 h TiO2 were taken and results revealed somewhat agglomeration among nanoparticles (Figure S3)."

[4] "The Raman spectra of the spent 5 h TiO2 were enlarged compared with the fresh TiO2 (Figure 7ab), the Eg Raman peak position shifted from 143 to 145 cm−1, and two new weak peaks emerged at 350 and 450 cm−1, which still could not be assigned to any type of anatase and rutile Raman-active modes." 

[5] "To better understand the relationship between the nanosized TiO2 sample and the oxygen vacancy formation, a series of experiments for different nanosized TiO2 samples were conducted."

[6] "With the purpose to investigate the evolution of a TiO2 catalyst, including the consumption of lattice oxygen, the formation of oxygen vacancy, surface hydrogenation, and distortion, the quantum chemical calculations results suggest that the surface Ti3+cusO Lewis acid-base pairs close to oxygen vacancy are the active sites and facilitate CH bond activation, especially for the second CH bond cleavage to form C3H6."

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses in-situ Raman spectroscopy to investigate the dynamic structure changes of TiO2 catalysts during propane dehydrogenation, including shifts in Raman peak positions and emergence of new peaks indicating changes in Ti-O vibrations and lattice distortion resulting from oxygen vacancy formation (Quotes 3-5). DFT calculations are also performed to gain molecular-level insights into the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in propane dehydrogenation over TiO2 catalysts (Quote 2). SEM and TEM are used to characterize changes in nanoparticle morphology before and after catalysis (Quote 1).

4. 是的,本文利用了原位表征技术来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。具体而言,它使用了原位拉曼光谱技术来调查TiO2催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中的动态结构变化,包括拉曼峰位移和新峰的出现,这表明了Ti-O振动的变化以及氧空位形成导致的晶格扭曲(引用3-5)。DFT计算也被用来在分子水平上洞悉TiO2催化剂上的活性位点和丙烷脱氢的机理步骤(引用2)。SEM和TEM被用来表征催化前后纳米粒子形貌的变化(引用1)。

[1] "The EPR spectra of TiO2 samples are shown in Figure 8a, which are widely used to examine unpaired spins. All the samples showed an oxygen vacancy signal (g = 2.002)." 

[2] "However, only the Ar-pretreated and spent 1025 nm xh-TiO2 samples showed signals corresponding to Ti3+ with [gxx gyy gzz] = [1.991 1.974 1.939], (50) indicating that the formation of Ti3+ is related to the consumption of lattice oxygen on the high temperature inert or reducible atmosphere."

[3] "As shown in Figure S5, with the increase of reaction time, the 1025 nm TiO2 nanomaterials turned from white to black and induced stronger light absorption."

[4] "The Raman peaks at 151, 409, 515, and 633 cm−1 (Figure S6a), which are assigned to the Eg, B1g, A1g or B1g, and Eg modes of the anatase phase, (45) became weak and broad with reaction time."

6. Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it uses EPR spectroscopy to detect the formation of Ti3+ species and oxygen vacancies in TiO2 after high temperature pretreatment and propane dehydrogenation reactions, indicating consumption of lattice oxygen and reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ (Quotes 1-2). Optical spectroscopy methods like UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy are also used to detect changes in light absorption and vibrational modes indicating lattice distortions from oxygen vacancy formation (Quotes 3-4).
