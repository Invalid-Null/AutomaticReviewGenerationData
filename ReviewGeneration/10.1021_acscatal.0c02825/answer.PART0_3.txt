[1] Propylene is one of key basic feedstock for the manufacture of various products such as polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs. (1,2) Because of the growing demand for propylene and the huge reserves of shale gas and natural gas, in which propane is one of the main components, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes an increasingly important technology for the production of propylene.

[2] For the main commercial catalysts (supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts) of PDH, the Pt is high cost and Cr6+ is highly toxic, effective measures must be taken to avoid harm to human body and environment in the production, use, and treatment of catalysts, which force researchers to find new catalysts. (3)

[3] The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst is universally used in the industrial PDH process, however, the high price of Pt and inevitable deactivation limit its large-scale application. To find an alternative to PtSn-based catalysts, extensive efforts have been made to develop supported metal oxide-based catalysts as potential low-cost options for replacing PtSn, including transition metal oxides (TMOs) of Cr, Ga, V, Fe, Zn, Sn etc.

[4] The reaction process of propane dehydrogenation to propene over TiO2(101) surfaces mainly contain two CH bond breaking steps: the first step is methylene CH bond activation of the C3H8 and the second step is methyl CH bond cleavage of isopropyl (CH3CHCH3).

1. The article provides background that propylene is an important basic chemical feedstock used for polymers, solvents, resins etc. There is growing demand for propylene production, and propane dehydrogenation is an increasingly important process to produce propylene from abundant propane reserves. 

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by reducing the activation energy barriers for C-H bond cleavage steps. Specific mechanisms involve metal-oxygen pairs in metal oxides that can stabilize transition states and weaken C-H bonds through 4-centered interactions.

3. The article introduces supported PtSn alloys and Cr-based oxides as current industrial PDH catalysts, but there is need to explore new alternatives like Ga, V, Fe, Zn, Sn oxides since Pt is expensive and Cr is toxic.

4. The article discusses the thermodynamic constraint that dehydrogenation is endothermic, and provides kinetic details that propane dehydrogenation occurs through two C-H bond cleavages, first methylene and then methyl C-H bonds.

5. No, the article does not describe DFT calculations of PDH mechanisms.

6. No, the article does not present microkinetic modeling of PDH kinetics. 

7. No, the article does not provide computational or experimental structure-activity relationships for PDH catalysts.
