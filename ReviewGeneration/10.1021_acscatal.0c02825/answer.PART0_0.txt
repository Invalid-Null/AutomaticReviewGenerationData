[1] Propylene is one of key basic feedstock for the manufacture of various products such as polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs.

[2] Because of the growing demand for propylene and the huge reserves of shale gas and natural gas, in which propane is one of the main components, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes an increasingly important technology for the production of propylene. 

[3] For the main commercial catalysts (supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts) of PDH, the Pt is high cost and Cr6+ is highly toxic, effective measures must be taken to avoid harm to human body and environment in the production, use, and treatment of catalysts, which force researchers to find new catalysts.

[1] For the non-oxidative PDH process, the standard Gibbs free energy change is positive. 

[2] The reaction requires high reaction temperature (≥550°C) to achieve high conversion of propane.

[3] However, as the PDH reaction is endothermic, the conversion of propane is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium.

[4] The reaction rates of propane dehydrogenation are relatively slow due to the high activation barriers for C-H and C-C bond cleavage.

4. The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is thermodynamically limited, being endothermic with positive free energy change. High temperatures over 550°C are needed for conversion but equilibrium conversion is still limited. Kinetically it also has high C-H and C-C bond cleavage barriers slowing reaction rates. Quantitative thermodynamic and kinetic details are not provided.
