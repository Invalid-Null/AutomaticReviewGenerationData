[1] The reduction degree of the 1025 nm TiO2 sample was controlled by different CO pre-reduction times at 550 C. The C3H6 formation rates (r(C3H6)), including initial r(C3H6) and final r(C3H6), increased at first and then decreased with CO reduction time (Figure 5b). So, the formation of Ticus and oxygen vacancies by appropriate reduction is beneficial to PDH performance, but the over-reduction would destroy effective active sites of PDH. (22)

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states of TiO2 affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that formation of Ti3+ cations (Ticus) and oxygen vacancies by moderate reduction improves PDH activity, but over-reduction destroys active sites and causes deactivation.

[1] The reaction process of propane dehydrogenation to propene over TiO2(101) surfaces mainly contain two CH bond breaking steps: the first step is methylene CH bond activation of the C3H8 and the second step is methyl CH bond cleavage of isopropyl (CH3CHCH3).

[2] However, the situation is extremely different for the propene formation. We find that the second CH bond cleavage is strongly favored by Ticus cations over the d-TiO2(101) surface (C2 to D2 in Figure 13). It is an exothermic process (0.68 eV), and the activation barrier is 1.27 eV (TS2, Figure 12) lower than that over the s-TiO2(101) surface (TS2, Figure 12). The Ticus cations mainly affect the activation barrier of the second CH bond breaking, as Ticus atoms have significant influence on hydrogen chemisorption (Table S2) and hydrogen chemisorption energies determine the activation barriers.

3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over TiO2 catalysts. It involves two CH bond cleavage steps, with the second CH bond cleavage of isopropyl to propene being facilitated by Ticus active sites on the reduced TiO2 surface. Ticus strongly chemisorbs hydrogen and lowers the barrier for breaking the C-H bond.

3. 是的,该文提出了丙烷在TiO2催化剂上的脱氢机理。它包含两步CH键断裂,其中异丙基到丙烯的第二步CH键断裂是由还原的TiO2表面上的Ticus活性中心所促进的。Ticus强烈化学吸附氢原子,降低了断裂C-H键的能垒。
