 Based on the provided text from the correct answers and the comparative files, I have compiled the consistency ratios between each answer file and the correct answers as follows:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "0%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},
  "2": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "0%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},
  "3": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "0%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},
  "4": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "0%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},
  "5": {"answer0.txt": "50%", "answer1.txt": "50%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "50%"},
  "6": {"answer0.txt": "50%", "answer1.txt": "0%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "50%"},
  "7": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I examined each answer file and compared it to the correct answers to determine how consistent the information was for each question. I assigned a consistency ratio percentage based on how much of the key information from the correct answer was contained in each file's answer.
