[1] "To identify how platinumtin alloys affect propane dehydrogenation to propylene over PtSn catalysts, multiple elementary reactions for propane dehydrogenation were studied from first-principles over four surface models: Pt3Sn/Pt(100), PtSn/Pt(100), Pt3Sn/Pt(111), and Pt2Sn/Pt(211), using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, uncertainty analysis using the BEEF-vdW with its ensemble (BMwE) model, and published experimental literature data."

[2] "Though this study was comprehensive in studying surface alloys of different platinum facets, there is much debate over the most representative models of PtSn alloys. Though models may include bulk alloys, in actuality, there are many possibilities, and we remain unsure how to describe the active site for these particular catalysts, especially when catalyst particle composition and distribution vary with catalyst synthesis, which may yield different alloys for catalyst particles, including the presence of pure metal surfaces as well."

5. The article describes how DFT calculations have been applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways over four PtSn alloy surface models - Pt3Sn/Pt(100), PtSn/Pt(100), Pt3Sn/Pt(111), and Pt2Sn/Pt(211). Uncertainty analysis using BEEF-vdW and its ensemble model was also utilized. However, there is uncertainty over the most representative PtSn alloy models.

[1] "Mean-field microkinetic models were generated to give information that can be directly compared to the experimental observation."

[2] "In addition to testing at reported experimental conditions, we calibrated our models to the reported experimental data." 

[3] "The calibrated model showed that all surfaces were highly selective to propylene production, and all of the probability densities encapsulated the reported turnover frequencies and selectivities."
