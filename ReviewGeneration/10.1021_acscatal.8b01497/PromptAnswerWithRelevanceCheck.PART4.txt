<Answer>
 I apologize, but the literature provided does not contain information relevant to answering any of the questions asked. The questions appear to be about propane dehydrogenation specifically, but the literature discusses a different topic of continuous-flow gas-phase butane dehydrogenation using supported pincer-iridium catalysts. As such, I do not have any relevant quotes or answers to provide.
