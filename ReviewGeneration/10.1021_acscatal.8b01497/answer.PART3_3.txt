 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that address any of the questions. The article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports, evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports, investigate catalyst preparation methods for optimizing active phase dispersion, utilize in-situ characterization techniques to study propane dehydrogenation catalysts, employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces, use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis, or evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation. The article focuses on the synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of supported pincer-iridium catalysts for continuous-flow gas-phase alkane dehydrogenation.
