Upon reviewing the provided questions and answers, I found that the answers do not contain information relevant to answering the specific questions asked. The answers repeatedly state that the article does not compare selectivity profiles, evaluate Pt alloy catalysts, investigate electronic/geometric effects, use subsurface promoters, describe synergistic effects, evaluate zeolite supports, or investigate effects of tuning zeolite properties. 

Since the answers do not provide substantive information pertaining to the questions, I have stopped my review process and responded with the designated sentence indicating the irrelevance of the provided answers.
