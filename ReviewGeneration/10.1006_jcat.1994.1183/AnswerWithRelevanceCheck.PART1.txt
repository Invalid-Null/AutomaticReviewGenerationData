            [1] "Assuming all chromium to be in the +6 state after s.o., the average oxidation number of chromium ( ) is  2 in SC samples reduced with CO and  3 with H2." 
            [2] "In AC catalysts,  values progressively increase in consecutive reduction experiments, from = 2.2 to = 4.2."

            Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states of chromium affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that for CrOx/SiO2 catalysts reduced with CO, the average chromium oxidation state ( ) is 2, while for reduction with H2 it is 3. For CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts,  increases from 2.2 to 4.2 with consecutive reduction experiments.
