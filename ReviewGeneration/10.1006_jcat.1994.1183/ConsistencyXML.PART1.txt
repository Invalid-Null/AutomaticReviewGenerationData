To generate the consistency ratios, I compared the answers from each file to the correct answers provided. I looked for overlapping concepts and claims between them to determine a percentage match. For question 1, I specifically looked at whether other promising metal oxide catalysts were evaluated. For question 2, I looked for discussion around tuning oxidation states and effects on performance. For question 3, I checked if the files mentioned mononuclear Cr(III) as the active site. Most files showed high consistency with the correct answers, with some exceptions.
