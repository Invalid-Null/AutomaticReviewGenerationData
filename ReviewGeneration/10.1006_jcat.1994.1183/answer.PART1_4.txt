<English version answer>
Answer: The article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It only studies CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3, and α-Cr2O3 catalysts.
</English version answer>

[1] "Assuming all chromium to be in the +6 state after s.o., the average oxidation number of chromium (
) is
 2 in SC samples reduced with CO and
 3 with H2."
[2] "In AC catalysts,
values progressively increase in consecutive reduction experiments, from
= 2.2 to
= 4.2."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states of chromium affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that for CrOx/SiO2 catalysts reduced with CO, the average chromium oxidation state (
) is 2, while for reduction with H2 it is 3. For CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, 
increases from 2.2 to 4.2 with consecutive reduction experiments.

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,文章研究了调节铬的氧化态如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。结果显示,对于用CO还原的CrOx/SiO2催化剂,平均铬氧化态(
)为2;而用H2还原则为3。对于CrOx/Al2O3催化剂,
随着连续还原实验从2.2增加到4.2。

[1] "Relying on (i) the dependence of the activity on chromium content, (ii) IR results. and (iii) ESR data, it is suggested that mononuclear CrIII with two coordinative vacancies is the active site for the dehydrogenation of propane."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario that mononuclear Cr(III) species with two coordinative vacancies is the active site for propane dehydrogenation over the studied catalysts. This is based on the activity dependence on Cr content, IR results, and ESR data.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,文章提出单核Cr(III)物种中两个配位空位是研究的催化剂上丙烷脱氢的活性中心。这是基于活性与Cr含量的相关性、红外光谱结果和电子顺磁共振数据。
