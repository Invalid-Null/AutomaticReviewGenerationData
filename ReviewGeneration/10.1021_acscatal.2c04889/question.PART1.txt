BO Oligomers or Ring Species in AlB2: Which is More Selective for Propane Oxidative Dehydrogenation?
Abstract
B-based catalysts are widely studied in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) owing to their high selectivity. Correspondingly, two species, BO oligomers and rings, have been recognized as active centers in B-based catalysts. To answer the essential question of whether BO oligomers or ring species are more selective for ODHP, two AlB2 catalysts enriched with BO rings (R-AlB2) and abundant B(OH)xO3x oligomers (O-AlB2) were designed and compared herein. When tested in ODHP, R-AlB2 exhibits an olefin yield of 30.2% at 500 C, which is 2.3 times that of O-AlB2. Additionally, R-AlB2 was stable for up to 200 h without deterioration. Multiple characterizations, including in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, demonstrate that BO rings are more advantageous for producing propylene (C3=) via a dehydration pathway with lower energy barriers and ethylene (C2=) via two other reaction pathways (direct cracking of propane and oxidative coupling of methyl) B(OH)xO3x is primarily responsible for producing few C3=.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Owing to the increasing demand for propylene (C3=) and abundance of propane input gas in shale gas, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is gaining importance as a viable propylene production technology owing to its favorable thermodynamic properties. (18) However, ODHP is typically limited by the overoxidation of propylene to valueless CO and CO2, which hinders its industrial implementation. Recently, B-containing catalysts have proven to be selective for ODHP and could potentially solve this problem. (9,10) Accordingly, considerable advancements have been made in this field. For example, Dai et al. and Yamauchi et al. designed a spherical superstructure comprising boron nitride nanosheets via a simple solvothermal transformation process, which exhibited excellent catalytic activity for ODHP. (5) Additionally, Hermans et al. found that inert hexagonal boron nitride and boron nitride nanotubes could serve as efficient catalysts for ODHP, and identified B(OH)xO3x oligomers (where x = 03) as the active centers via11B solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. (6,9,11,12) Moreover, Hermans et al. employed the 35.2 T 2D 11B{17O} dipolar heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence NMR spectra to disclose the structural connectivity between B and O atoms, resolve linear and ring borate structures, and demonstrate that these types of boron oxide clusters are all active toward ODHP. (13) Furthermore, Lu et al. synthesized boron oxide-supported mesoporous silica B2O3/SBA-15, in which the BO ring species were also shown to be active sites for ODHP. (14) Therefore, active centers of B-based catalysts are generally believed to comprise two types of BO species: BO oligomers (e.g., B(OH)xO3x) and BO rings.
To answer the fundamental question of which are more selective for ODHP: BO oligomers or ring species, we herein developed two types of aluminum boride catalysts: AlB2 enriched in BO rings (R-AlB2) and AlB2 with abundant oligomers (O-AlB2). Our results demonstrate that both B(OH)xO3x oligomers and BO rings comprise the active sites in R-AlB2, whereas O-AlB2 exclusively contained B(OH)xO3x centers. In ODHP testing, R-AlB2 demonstrated an ultrahigh olefin yield of 30.2% and propane conversion of 35.0% at 500 C, outperforming O-AlB2 by a factor of 2.3. Notably, R-AlB2 exhibited superior durability even after 200 h of continuous ODHP reaction. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (in situ FT-IR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the BO ring species were more suitable for forming propylene (C3=) and ethylene (C2=), whereas the BO oligomers [B(OH)xO3x] primarily generated a small quantity of C3=. Additionally, the probable reaction pathways are as follows: (1) BO ring species to C3= was found to be more energetically favorable via a dehydration pathway, as compared with B(OH)xO3x; (2) BO ring species undergo direct cracking of propane and oxidative coupling of methyl (OCM) reaction pathways (with low reaction energy) to produce C2=.

Synthesis and Characterization of Catalysts
We developed two catalysts, O-AlB2 and R-AlB2 (Figure 1a), to accurately answer the question of whether BO oligomers or ring species in AlB2 catalysts are more selective for ODHP. AlB2 was prepared via a solid-phase reaction using nanoscale Al powder and amorphous B powder as raw materials. (15) According to previous studies, (6,11,16,17) the as-prepared AlB2 included B(OH)xO3x oligomers, which were believed to function as active centers for ODHP. The existence of B(OH)xO3x species was proved using FT-IR spectroscopy (Figure 1b). Specifically, the peaks located at 1154.2 and 1090.5 cm1 could be assigned to B(OH)xO3x, while those at 1632.4 and 1402.96 cm1 were assigned to vibrations of the BO bond. (10,12,18) As-prepared AlB2 was designed as O-AlB2 in this instance. After thermal treatment by O2 (details in the Supporting Information), BO ring species emerged in O-AlB2 owing to increased O atom filling (labeled as R-AlB2). According to the FT-IR spectrum of R-AlB2 (Figure 1c), a new peak formed at 1220.7 cm1, which might be attributed to BO ring species. (19) This indicated the successful construction of two catalysts, namely, O-AlB2 containing B(OH)xO3x species and R-AlB2 rich in BO rings.

Subsequently, the structures of the two aforementioned catalysts were further characterized and identified using synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As depicted in the B K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra (Figure S1), the intensity of the BO peak at 194.0 eV in R-AlB2 was stronger than that in O-AlB2, (20) suggesting that R-AlB2 may contain much more BO species. The peaks at 533.6 and 536.8 eV in the O K-edge XANES spectrum of O-AlB2 (Figure 1d; dark yellow) were assigned to BO and B(OH)xO3x species, respectively. (12) Remarkably, Besides the BO peak at 533.6 eV, there was a new peak centered at 537.3 eV in the R-AlB2 spectrum (Figure 1d; red). It could be divided into two peaks, B(OH)xO3x at 536.8 eV and BO ring species at 537.9 eV. (21) Moreover, the XPS spectra (Figures 1e and S2) were consistent with the FT-IR and XANES results. (17) After O substitution, the strength of the BB bond (at 187.6 eV) in R-AlB2 decreased, but that of the BO bond centered at 192.5 eV increased. The BO species can be separated into BO ring species (193.3 eV) and B(OH)xO3x (192.5 eV). Therefore, BO ring species were present in R-AlB2 after O substitution.
Catalytic Performance and Product Analysis
To compare the catalytic activity of the two catalysts (O-AlB2 and R-AlB2) for ODHP, their performance was assessed in a continuous flow fixed-bed quartz reactor with a C3H8/O2 ratio of 2/1 and weight hour space velocity of 3600 L kg1 h1. The conversion of O-AlB2 and R-AlB2 to propane as a function of reaction temperature (400550 C) is depicted in Figure 2a. Propane conversion over R-AlB2 reached 4.4% at 425 C. Note that the conversion rate increased as temperature rose, reaching 35.0% at 500 C and 42.2% at 525 C. In contrast, O-AlB2 exhibited much lower conversion rates (15.4% at 500 C and 24.3% at 525 C), indicating its low catalytic activity. To shed light on the relationship between the content of BO rings and catalytic performance for ODHP, two R-AlB2 catalysts with differing quantities of BO rings and O-AlB2 were compared. R-AlB2-L (with lower content of BO rings) was prepared by shortening the thermal treatment time. As evidenced by the FT-IR spectra (Figure S3a), the peak intensity of BO ring species in R-AlB2-L (at 1220.7 cm1) was lower than that in R-AlB2. (19,22,23) Consequently, the catalytic performance of R-AlB2-L was quite inferior to that of R-AlB2 (Figure S3b). The conversion of C3H8 was positively correlated with the content of BO rings and followed the order of R-AlB2 > R-AlB2-L > O-AlB2. Namely, BO rings seem to be more active than B(OH)xO3x species in ODHP. The exact ratio of ring species to oligomers is usually hard to be identified, but it may be realized using some advanced research tools. For example, Hermans et al. recently used ultrahigh field 11B17O solid-state NMR spectroscopy to reveal the atomic map of boron oxide catalysts and analyzed the approximate ratio of ring-shaped bridging oxygen atoms to linear bridging oxygen atoms. (13)

(b) Arrhenius plots as a function of reaction temperature for O-AlB2 and R-AlB2 (reaction conditions: catalyst weight = 50 mg, gas feed = 12 mL/min, C3H8/O2 molar ratio = 2/1, and temperature 400500 C). (c) Comparison of the catalytic performance of R-AlB2 and reported ODHP catalysts at 500 C (Table S1). (d) Stability test of R-AlB2 for ODHP at 500 C (reaction conditions: catalyst weight = 200 mg, gas feed = 12 mL/min, and C3H8/O2 molar ratio = 2/1).
Based on the Arrhenius equation, we take the inverse of temperature on the horizontal axis and the natural logarithm of propane conversion on the vertical axis and get the activation energy through multiplying the absolute slope of the resulting curve by the value of the molar gas constant (R). The lower the apparent activation energy of the catalyst, the faster the reaction rate and higher the catalytic activity. (5) As illustrated in Figure 2b, the C3H8 conversion of O-AlB2 and R-AlB2 was controlled below 10%. And the apparent activation energy of R-AlB2 (75.54 kJ mol1) was far lower than that of O-AlB2 (96.71 kJ mol1), indicating that R-AlB2 was more catalytically active for C3H8. Additionally, the yield of olefins reached 30.2% with a selectivity of 86.3% over R-AlB2 at 500 C (Figure S4). The yield of R-AlB2 was 2.3 times that of O-AlB2, outperforming B-based and other catalysts previously reported for ODHP (Figure 2c and Table S1). Moreover, R-AlB2 exhibited superior long-term evaluation stability (Figure 2d). Even after reacting for 200 h at 500 C, both conversion and selectivity remained unaltered. In contrast, O-AlB2 deactivated after 50 h, as evidenced by a considerable decrease in propane conversion (Figure S5). The oligomers in O-AlB2 could be hydrolyzed completely with water (one of the products) to produce B with saturated OH groups. The produced B was prone to leaching at the reaction temperature due to its low melting point (450 C), deactivating the catalyst. (24) Similar to the previous reports on B-based ODHP catalysts, (9) XRD patterns of the spent O-AlB2 (Figure S6) also showed that it was partially dissolved into the boric acid and the boron leaching happened during the reaction. Note that the spent R-AlB2 sample maintained its original structure, demonstrating better stability than O-AlB2 (Figures S7 and S8). This is most likely due to its low oligomer content and rigidity of BO ring species. (25) To rule out the impact of oxidized Al on the reactivity of ODHP, the performance of Al2O3 in its various crystalline phases was evaluated. As shown in Figures S9 and S10, no obvious reactivity for both γ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3 appeared in ODHP.
Further analysis of the propylene (C3=) and ethylene (C2=) product distributions would help understand the specific effects of BO oligomers and BO ring species on olefin formation. As shown in Figure 3a,b, the yield of olefins for O-AlB2 and R-AlB2 increased as the temperature rose, with R-AlB2 exhibiting markedly enhanced activity compared to O-AlB2. For example, an ultrahigh olefin yield of 35.2% at 525 C was obtained for R-AlB2, which is greater than that of several previously reported catalysts (Figure 2c and Table S1). Regarding the C3H6 product yield and formation rate, the difference between O-AlB2 and R-AlB2 was observed to grow continuously (Figure 3c,d). Particularly, R-AlB2 considerably enhanced C3= yield and formation rate. The C3= yield reached 25.1% at 525 C, 1.5 times that of O-AlB2, while the C3= formation rate was 2.4 times that of O-AlB2. Compared with O-AlB2, the C2= selectivity of R-AlB2 increased much more as temperature rose (Figure S11). Notably, a C2= yield of 8.0% was observed for R-AlB2 at 525 C, but O-AlB2 exhibited comparatively low catalytic activity (C2= yield of 2.5%) at the same temperature. The enhanced performance of R-AlB2 again indicated that BO rings were advantageous for producing both C3= and C2=.

In situ FT-IR Characterization and Mechanistic Studies of C3= and C2=
Furthermore, in situ FT-IR was performed to study the adsorption sites and activation of propane on the R-AlB2 surface. As shown in Figures 4a and S12, after the adsorption of propane on R-AlB2 and O-AlB2, the characteristic vibration peaks of propane appeared in the IR spectra for both samples, including the symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching vibrations of CH in propane (signals at 30402850 cm1), and scissoring vibrations of the CH2 group (at 15001420 cm1). (26,27) Under R-AlB2 catalysis (Figure 4a), the peaks of CH vibration in propane at 30402850 and 15001420 cm1 diminished with increasing temperature, indicating the consumption of C3H8. Similar variation trends were observed in the in situ FT-IR spectrum of O-AlB2 (Figure S12). Furthermore, additional peaks at 13001000 cm1 of the stretching vibration of CH2 of olefins (28) appeared at 350 C. There were weakening peaks of C3H8 but no new peaks of CH2 in the in situ FT-IR spectra of O-AlB2 (Figure S12), which was consistent with the previously described results (Figure 2a).
Figure 4
Figure 4. (a, b) In situ FT-IR spectra and (c) computational simulation of ODHP in R-AlB2.
Rapid weakening of the vibrational bands of the CH2 group in propane (at 1472 and 1456 cm1) suggests that the ODHP may be initiated by the cleavage of methylene CH bonds (29) (Figure 4b). To prove this, the Vienna ab initio simulation package was used to simulate and determine the IR spectra of α-C and β-C adsorption (in *C3H7) on R-AlB2 (Figures 4c and S13). Only β-C was adsorbed by R-AlB2, and a peak near 1460 cm1 corresponding to the methylene peak appeared (Figure 4b). The β-C atom in propane, and not the α-C atom, may prefer to adsorb onto the surface of R-AlB2. This finding was helpful in theoretical calculations for developing the adsorption model.
Based on the above FT-IR results, the entire process ODHP on BO rings and BO oligomers may comprise the following steps: (I) cleavage of CH bonds, (II) formation of water, and (III) lattice O regeneration (10) (Scheme 1). After dehydrogenation of the C3H8 molecule twice, the remaining H atoms bond with an O atom to form a water molecule via H transition. Desorption of water forms an O vacancy. Finally, an O2 molecule is adsorbed to fill the O vacancy in the lattice.
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Proposed ODHP Processes for the BO Ring and Oligomers
We further calculated the possible dehydrogenation pathways for ODHP with the two catalysts (Figure 5). In the initial dehydrogenation step, the activation energy of the BO ring species was 1.25 eV, while it was as low as 0.60 eV for the B(OH)xO3x species. For the second step of CH bond cleavage, the activation energies of BO rings and B(OH)xO3x species reached 2.45 and 2.59 eV; the corresponding lengths in the transition states were 1.30 and 1.35 Å, respectively. Thus, compared to the initial dehydrogenation, the second dehydrogenation was considerably more difficult, and this may be the rate-determining step of the reaction. The BO rings were more favorable for dehydrogenation than the B(OH)xO3x species.

The C2= products and their potential reaction pathways over two BO active centers were studied. As shown in Figure 3a,b, the C2= yield for R-AlB2 increased steadily >475 C, whereas the C2= yield for O-AlB2 (<3%) increased slowly until 525 C. The calculated formation rate of C2H4 on R-AlB2 is shown in Figure 6a. The formation rate increased as temperature increased. The C2= formation rate reached 0.24 g g1 h1, and C2= selectivity increased to 19.0% at 525 C (Figure S14). Notably, the COx yield was consistently low, suggesting that R-AlB2 experienced little propane overoxidation. With increasing reaction temperature, the selectivity of C1 (including CO, CO2, and CH4) and C2 (including C2H4 and C2H6) increased due to the direct cracking of propane. CC cleavage of propane was expected to produce equal amounts of C1 and C2 molecules. However, the C2/C1 ratio was >2, indicating that some C1 products may transform into C2 products through oxidative coupling of methyl (OCM). (10,30) This is further demonstrated by Figure S15, which shows the distribution of methyl reaction products of R-AlB2, as calculated according to the equation reported by Wang et al. (30) The number of methyl groups resulting from CC bond cleavage of propane increased with an increase in temperature.

(b) Three pathways for C2H4 formation with activation energies for each step and corresponding reaction energy enclosed in brackets (pink: OCM; black: direct cracking of propane). The BO ring was chosen as an active site.
Based on the experimental results and DFT calculations, three probable reaction pathways for the formation of C2H4 over the BO rings are illustrated in Figures 6b and S16: direct cracking of propane [*C3H7  *C3H6  *C2H4(g) + *CH2] and two OCM pathways [2 *CH3  C2H6(g)  *C2H5 + *H  C2H4(g) + 2 *H and 2 *CH3  2 *CH2 + 2 *H  C2H4(g) + 2 *H]. (31) In the direct cracking of propane, *C3H7 species are dehydrogenated to *C3H6 species, and CC cleavage of *C3H6 species produces C2H4(g) and *CH2 species. The highest activation energy for the active site of the B(OH)xO3x species was 2.94 eV, which was higher than that for the BO rings (2.66 eV), indicating that C2 products tended to form on the BO rings (Figures 6b and S17). The CC coupling of the *CH3/*CH2 species to form ethane/ethylene occurred in the gas phase. As shown in Figure 6b, the activation energy of the OCM process over the BO rings was 3.35 eV, which was consistent with the methyl reaction product distribution of R-AlB2 (Figure S15). As mentioned, the yield of ethylene for B(OH)xO3x species was extremely low. The contribution of C2 products from B(OH)xO3x species was negligible.
Further, the catalytic performance of MgB2 for ODHP was evaluated as a control experiment (Figures S18S20). The yields of C2= and C3= over MgB2 were comparable to those over O-AlB2, which were considerably lower than those over R-AlB2 (Figure S18). Additionally, as temperature increased, the C2= yield of MgB2 increased slowly (Figure S19). In the FT-IR spectrum of MgB2, there were no peaks corresponding to the BO rings between 1220 and 1250 cm1, (19) but there was a B(OH)xO3x peak at 1205 cm1 (Figure S20). Therefore, it was plausible to conclude that the active sites of B(OH)xO3x species present in R-AlB2 were not the cause of the high activity and that coexisting BO rings were likely the cause. Recent studies have shown that the gas-phase free radical reaction played an important role in forming C3= and C2= in B-based ODHP materials (32) and that adding a moderate amount of water could improve propane conversion, which may be related to the free radical reactions. However, it still remains a big challenge to study the free radical process, and some cutting-edge techniques are developed. For example, Wu et al. obtained the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals in ODHP reactions on boron-based catalysts using an online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), revealing the presence of gas-phase free radical pathways. (33)
Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Herein, we report two AlB2 catalysts with abundant BO ring species (R-AlB2) and enriched B(OH)xO3x oligomer species (O-AlB2) and aim to answer whether BO oligomers or BO ring species in AlB2 are more selective for ODHP. As evaluated in ODHP, R-AlB2 exhibited an increased olefin yield (500 C) of 30.2%, which was 2.3 times that of O-AlB2 and exceeded that of B-containing catalysts previously reported for ODHP. ODHP achieved higher stability over R-AlB2 (200 h). Experimental tests, spectral characterization, and DFT calculations provided substantial evidence for the involvement of the two aforementioned active centers. The BO ring active centers favored the formation of both C3= and C2= olefins, whereas the B(OH)xO3x oligomer species contributed to forming C3=. Further theoretical calculations reveal that the BO ring species formed C3=via a more energetically favorable dehydration pathway than the B(OH)xO3x species and C2=via the direct cracking of propane and OCM pathways with low reaction energy. Therefore, it is predicted that the design of BO ring species in B-based catalysts will greatly aid in enhancing the catalytic activity for ODHP.
