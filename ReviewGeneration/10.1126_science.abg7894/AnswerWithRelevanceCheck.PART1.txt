          "Global demand for propylene is >100 million metric tons per year, with 4% annual growth (2)."

          "Relative to the Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts in which Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on Al2O3 and modified by the addition of a post-transition metal such as tin (Sn) exhibit higher selectivity."

          "Performance depends critically on forming intermetallic PtSn NPs that improve propylene selectivity and enhance stability by reducing the rate of hydrogenolysis and coke formation (12)."

         The article states that to Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts supported on Al2O3 and modified with Sn exhibit higher selectivity. The article also states that forming intermetallic PtSn NPs improves propylene selectivity and stability by reducing hydrogenolysis and coke formation.

           "We compared this Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst to a commercial mimic Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 [the commercially used nominal loading is Pt:Sn = 1:5 (9)] as well as a Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst." 
           
           "The Pt/γ-Al2O3 (0.5 wt % Pt) catalyst exhibited relatively poor performance, with only 15% initial propane conversion (Fig. 1A, purple circles) and lower propylene selectivity (Fig. 1B, purple circles)."

           "The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation."
           
           "We synthesized the catalyst by mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution to form a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex."
           
           "We used this solution to impregnate the SiO2 support and reduce the catalyst to obtain very small Pt-Sn NPs."
           
           "Data in Fig. 4, E and F, show the XANES spectra associated with the Pt LIII-edge and Sn K-edge, respectively, of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst and relevant controls. The Pt LIII-edge XANES spectra in Fig. 4E are consistent with the analysis of the EXAFS data, indicating that the mixing of Pt and Sn took place in the reduced Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst."
           
           "Figure 4B shows the XPS spectra associated with the Pt 4f7/2 electronic state, demonstrating that the Pt atoms were in the metallic Pt(0) state. Additionally, the Pt 4f7/2 peak shifted toward lower binding energy (70.5 eV) relative to a monometallic Pt reference (71.0 eV), in agreement with prior reports that the formation of PtSn caused a slight electron transfer from Sn to Pt that increased the local electron density on Pt and local Coulombic repulsion, thereby lowering the electron binding energy."

           The article investigates how properties like particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst. It shows small, intermetallic Pt-Sn nanoparticles interact weakly with the silica support, preserving the Pt-Sn mixing and achieving good performance.
