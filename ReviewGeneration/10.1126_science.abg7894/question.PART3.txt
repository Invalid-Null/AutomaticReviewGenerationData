Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit
Hitting the limits on propene synthesis
The greater abundance of propane from shale gas has spurred efforts to use it as a propylene feedstock. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation. Motagamwala et al. report that platinumtin nanoparticles interact more weakly with a silica support and the metals thus do not segregate. The use of undiluted reactants allowed the reaction to run near the thermodynamically limit of about 67% conversion with a selectivity to propylene of more than 99%. This catalyst also does not build up carbon and could run up to 30 hours without deactivation.

Abstract
Intentional (on-purpose) propylene production through nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) holds great promise for meeting the increasing global demand for propylene. For stable performance, traditional alumina-supported platinum-based catalysts require excess tin and feed dilution with hydrogen; however, this reduces per-pass propylene conversion and thus lowers catalyst productivity. We report that silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (<2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports.

Shale gas production has led to a switch in the industrial feedstocks for propylene, from naphtha to propane (1). Global demand for propylene is >100 million metric tons per year, with 4% annual growth (2). Oxidative propane dehydrogenation (OPDH) is an emerging technology in which thermodynamically driven overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides (COx) is a major drawback (3, 4). For example, state-of-the-art hexagonal boron nitride OPDH catalysts achieve a relatively low per-pass propylene yield of <16% (5, 6). Additionally, propylene separation from carbon oxides and other by-products of OPDH has further limited OPDH application at the commercial scale (7).
Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) produced 13.6 million metric tons of propylene in 2019, accounting for 11% of global propylene production (8). Commercial PDH processes utilize either chromium (Cr)based (Catofin process) or platinum (Pt)based catalysts [Oleflex and steam-activated reforming (STAR) processes] (9). This endothermic reaction operates at a relatively high temperature (550 to 700C) and atmospheric pressure to increase the equilibrium conversion (10). The main drawbacks with Cr-based catalysts are relatively low selectivity to propylene and high catalyst deactivation rate due to extensive deposition of solid carbon (coke) on the catalyst surface. Rapid catalyst deactivation requires regeneration of the Catofin catalyst every 12 min (11).
Relative to the Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts in which Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on Al2O3 and modified by the addition of a post-transition metal such as tin (Sn) exhibit higher selectivity. Performance depends critically on forming intermetallic PtSn NPs that improve propylene selectivity and enhance stability by reducing the rate of hydrogenolysis and coke formation (12). However, under PDH reaction conditions, PtSn intermetallic NPs on Al2O3 separate into Pt and Sn atoms and form segregated SnOx and Pt phases on Al2O3 supports (9), and this phase-segregated catalyst deactivates rapidly through coking.
To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13). Although this strategy is implemented commercially (10), addition of hydrogen in the feed lowers the thermodynamic limit on per-pass propane conversion (fig. S1) and decreases productivity (7). Even with these augmentations, to combat deactivation, commercial Pt-based catalysts are operated at low per-pass propane conversion, and the catalyst is continuously regenerated with a moving-bed adiabatic reactor. Thus, catalysts are needed that can achieve higher per-pass propane conversion with high propylene selectivity and elevated catalyst stability compared with the current processes (1).
We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation. We synthesized the catalyst by mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution to form a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex. We used this solution to impregnate the SiO2 support and reduce the catalyst to obtain very small Pt-Sn NPs. The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction. This catalyst has three main features: (i) The PtSn NPs form an atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursor. (ii) Upon reduction, very small (less than 2 nm diameter) intermetallic PtSn NPs form. (iii) A benign interaction of these NPs with the SiO2 support avoids segregation of Pt and Sn and formation of a SnOx phase. We compared this Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst to a commercial mimic Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 [the commercially used nominal loading is Pt:Sn = 1:5 (9)] as well as a Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Catalytic performance was evaluated in a packed-bed reactor at 580C under flowing propane, hydrogen, and an inert gas. Detailed descriptions of the catalyst synthesis, catalyst characterization, reactor operation, and analytical methods are available in the supporting information. Hock and co-workers used a similar approach to synthesize isolated Fe atoms on SiO2 for PDH by grafting and reducing the Fe(oCp)2 complex [bis(2,4-dimethyl-1,3-pentadienide) iron(II)] onto a silica support, however, poor propylene selectivity (14%) was obtained on this catalyst (14).
Data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of >66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and >99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles). The Pt/γ-Al2O3 (0.5 wt % Pt) catalyst exhibited relatively poor performance, with only 15% initial propane conversion (Fig. 1A, purple circles) and lower propylene selectivity (Fig. 1B, purple circles). Similarly, the commercial mimic Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts showed modest activity, with initial propane conversion of 22% (Fig. 1A, black triangles) and comparatively lower propylene selectivity (Fig. 1B, black triangles). Note that the active phase in these commercial mimics is Pt3Sn, with the excess Sn present as the SnOx layers on the alumina support (12).

, and WHSV = 4.7 hours1. For Sn-promoted catalysts on an Al2O3 support, the atomic ratio of Sn:Pt is 5; on a SiO2 support, the atomic ratio is 1.
Addition of hydrogen to the feed stream improved the activity and stability of the Pt/γ-Al2O3 and the commercial mimic Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 1, A and B, blue squares and green triangles, respectively), albeit to levels much lower than those achieved by Pt1Sn1/SiO2. Addition of hydrogen did not compromise the performance of Pt1Sn1/SiO2 (Fig. 1, A and B, purple diamonds). Data in Fig. 1C show the propylene yield (product of the selectivity and conversion) for the tested catalysts, demonstrating the superior performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst. Increasing the Sn:Pt atomic ratio on SiO2-supported catalysts to the levels used in the commercial Al2O3-supported catalysts (Pt:Sn = 1:5) led to poor performance (fig. S3A) (15). Similarly, decreasing the Sn:Pt atomic ratio on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 to Pt1Sn1 led to rapid catalyst deactivation (fig. S3B).
The data in Fig. 1, A to C, were obtained with 16 vol % propane in helium. Propane streams are diluted in commercial operations to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure (fig. S2), and to limit catalyst deactivation rates (7, 16, 17). This approach requires additional downstream separation units and limits process efficiency. In an undiluted propane stream, the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst reached the thermodynamic conversion limit of 40% (Fig. 1D and fig. S2), with >99% selectivity to propylene. Even under these harsh, high-conversion and undiluted propane stream conditions, the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst was stable and operated at the thermodynamic conversion limit and >99% selectivity for at least 30 hours on stream, whereas the PtSn/γ-Al2O3 (commercial mimic) deactivated rapidly under these conditions (Fig. 1D).
We also compared the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst to various catalysts previously tested in propane dehydrogenation (1853). Data in Fig. 2A and table S1 show the comparison of the initial (fresh catalyst) selectivity-conversion results reported for different catalysts. The slanted lines in the figure quantify the proximity of the measured conversion-selectivity data points to the highest possible conversion-selectivity lines for different conditions at which these catalysts were tested. The highest possible conversion-selectivity line has the value of 100% when the catalyst operates at equilibrium conversion and 100% propylene selectivity. By this metric, the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst outperformed other catalysts, reaching very close to the highest possible conversion-selectivity line (100% selectivity to propylene at equilibrium conversion), whereas other tested catalysts were mostly <80% of the highest possible performance. We emphasize that on Pt1Sn1/SiO2, the highest possible yield can also be achieved with undiluted propane feed (point labeled as 1 in Fig. 2A), which has not been demonstrated previously. For example, PtSn/Al2O3 nanosheets (45) reach near-equilibrium conversion (point labeled as 42 in Fig. 2A); however, the propane is diluted with hydrogen (C3H8:H2 = 0.8) and an inert gas, leading to low propane partial pressure.

(B) Catalyst productivity (product of the initial reaction rate and the inverse of the deactivation coefficient) for various PDH catalysts studied in the literature. Numbers in brackets correspond to row numbers in table S2. Two data points from this work are for two different conditions (with and without dilution in the feed).
The overall productivity of a PDH catalyst is affected by the conversion-selectivity data as well as the catalyst stability and the inherent reaction rates. We developed a figure of merit that combined these two metrics and quantified the relative productivities of different catalysts. To quantify the stability of the catalysts, the propylene yield data, reported as a function of time for different catalysts, were analyzed assuming first-order deactivation kinetics, as is usually done for catalytic reactions on supported metal NPs (9). This analysis allowed us to calculate the catalyst deactivation coefficient, kd (see supplementary text for derivation), for different catalysts. Data in table S2 show the calculated values of the deactivation coefficient.
To quantify the inherent kinetic rates for the same catalysts, the initial forward rates of propylene formation were obtained by analyzing the data reported in the literature. Most data are reported for an integral reactor design (i.e., high propane conversion), so we performed an integral reactor analysis to obtain an analytical expression for the initial reaction rates (see supplementary text for derivation). This analytical expression was used to calculate the initial forward rate of propylene production for various catalysts (table S2). The product of the initial forward reaction rate and the inverse of the deactivation coefficient (proportional to catalyst stability) provided a measure of the overall catalyst productivity. Data in Fig. 2B show the productivities of different catalysts operated under a range of conditions. The data show that the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst reported here demonstrated the highest productivity for propylene production of all tested catalysts. For example, Pt1Sn1/SiO2 in the absence of hydrogen was more productive than the commercial mimic Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 by two orders of magnitude.
The overall catalyst performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts was also studied at different WHSVs (i.e., including those away from the equilibrium conversion). Catalyst productivity remained high, between 28 and 40 moles per gram of catalyst, for different WHSVs (fig. S4 and table S2).
The data above show that the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts exhibited very high productivity and stability compared with other catalysts. Because the dehydrogenation reaction is operated under carbon-rich reducing conditions, it is inevitable that, over time, catalyst deactivation due to deposition of solid carbon would compromise the performance of the catalysts. To investigate whether this Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst can be regenerated, we intentionally increased the rate of catalyst deactivation by increasing the propane flow rate (i.e., propane WHSV) and diluting the propane stream (which increases the propane equilibrium conversion). These conditions push the catalysts away from the equilibrium conversion and lead to a more rapid, forced carbon-induced deactivation. The data in fig. S5 show that, under these conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the spent catalyst, after 120 min of PDH reaction, is shown in fig. S6. The image shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6  0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples. Raman spectroscopy (fig. S7) on the spent catalyst confirmed that the slight loss in catalyst activity was due to coking. We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C (see supplementary materials for details of the regeneration procedure). The regeneration studies showed that Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts can be partially regenerated. For example, we measured 97% of the initial activity and >99% of the initial selectivity after three PDH/regeneration cycles (fig. S5).
We hypothesized that the performance and stability of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst was derived from favorable interactions among the support (SiO2), promoter (Sn), and active metal (Pt), which allowed for a high degree of atomic mixing of Pt and Sn within very small intermetallic PtSn NPs. Mixing of Pt and Sn atoms in NPs can be compromised when these materials are introduced on other oxide supports such as Al2O3, where Pt and Sn atoms segregate, leading to the formation of Pt NPs and an Sn-oxide phase (54). We studied the structure of the catalyst and its precursors by using a combination of x-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), TEM, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy [extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES)].
Data in Fig. 3A show that the process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of H2PtCl6 is characterized by a prominent absorption peak at 260 nm; SnCl2 exhibits no absorption in the visible range. The combined precursor solution shows several additional UV-Vis absorption peaks at 279, 363, 420, and 488 nm that are characteristic of a heterometallic Pt-Sn complex (55), indicating the mixing of Sn and Pt atoms before reduction and growth of NPs on the support.

A bright-field TEM image of Pt-Sn NPs formed on SiO2 upon the reduction of the Pt-Sn complex shows high metal dispersion on the support, with an average NP size of 1.3  0.6 nm (Fig. 3B). The NP size distribution (Fig. 3C) shows that most NPs were <2 nm. The XRD spectra in Fig. 3D show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn. This finding is supported by the presence of the XRD peaks corresponding to Pt1Sn1 (41.8 and 44.1) and Pt3Sn1 (39.0 and 45.3) stoichiometries.
To establish that the mixing of Sn and Pt atoms in PtSn NPs extended to their surface, we used DRIFTS to measure the infrared absorption spectra of carbon monoxide (CO), as its adsorption on Pt surfaces has been well characterized. The CO-DRIFTS spectra for Pt/SiO2 and Pt1Sn1/SiO2 (Fig. 4A) revealed linear (on top) and bridge-bonded CO on Pt/SiO2 with infrared adsorption peaks at 2073 and 1821 cm1, respectively (56, 57). On Pt1Sn1/SiO2, the bridge-bonded CO was not present, and the linearly bonded peak had much lower intensity. Because CO does not adsorb at the bridge sites between Sn and Pt, the data suggest that Sn broke the ensembles of Pt atoms on the NP surfaces and created a checkerboard Pt-Sn surface structure (58). The decreased intensity of the linearly bonded CO adsorption peak was consistent with reduced surface coverage of CO on the PtSn compared with Pt (59), further demonstrating the mixing of Pt and Sn in Pt1Sn1/SiO2. Introduction of Sn to the catalyst also slightly shifted the vibrational frequency of the linearly bonded CO band to 2078 cm1, indicating the perturbation of the electronic structure of surface Pt atoms by neighboring Sn atoms (56).

Coordination numbers for Pt-Sn and PtPt are 4.2  0.4 and 3.9  0.9, respectively, and bond distances for Pt-Sn and Pt-Pt are 2.72  0.01 and 2.75  0.02, respectively (table S3). R, radial distance.

To further confirm the presence of PtSn surface alloys, XPS of the freshly reduced Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed that the atomic ratio of Pt and Sn was 1, consistent with the nominal loading (fig. S8). Figure 4B shows the XPS spectra associated with the Pt 4f7/2 electronic state, demonstrating that the Pt atoms were in the metallic Pt(0) state. Additionally, the Pt 4f7/2 peak shifted toward lower binding energy (70.5 eV) relative to a monometallic Pt reference (71.0 eV), in agreement with prior reports that the formation of PtSn caused a slight electron transfer from Sn to Pt that increased the local electron density on Pt and local Coulombic repulsion, thereby lowering the electron binding energy (6062). Furthermore, the Sn 3d5/2 XPS spectra in Fig. 4C show that most Sn atoms were metallic Sn, and a small fraction of Sn existed as SnO or SnO2, further confirming the formation of PtSn intermetallic NPs (63, 64).
The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases. The parameters used to obtain the best-fit spectra are provided in the Fig. 4D caption.
When assigning EXAFS spectra to a geometric structure, it is instructive to compare the measured bond distances to those corresponding to thermodynamically stable phases of a material. For Pt3Sn, both Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn bond distances are 2.83 Å. By contrast, the Pt-Pt bond distance in PtSn is 2.72 Å, whereas the Pt-Sn bond distance is 2.73 Å (63, 64). The Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn bond distances experimentally measured for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (2.75 and 2.71 Å, respectively) suggest that the catalyst was likely a mix of Pt3Sn and PtSn, with a higher concentration of the PtSn phase, as no peaks were observed at 2.83 Å.
Data in Fig. 4, E and F, show the XANES spectra associated with the Pt LIII-edge and Sn K-edge, respectively, of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst and relevant controls. The Pt LIII-edge XANES spectra in Fig. 4E are consistent with the analysis of the EXAFS data, indicating that the mixing of Pt and Sn took place in the reduced Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst. Indeed, the formation of a stable Pt-Sn phase was complete by 390Cabove this temperature, no further changes were observed (Fig. 4E, inset). A slight increase in the Pt LIII-edge energy and a decrease in white-line intensity and its broadening observed for Pt1Sn1/SiO2 compared with pure Pt could be attributed to the formation of the Pt-Sn phase, consistent with XPS results that showed slight electron transfer from Sn to Pt. Likewise, the slight increase in Sn K-edge energy and the increase in the white-line intensity relative to Sn foil in (Fig. 4F) indicated that Sn existed in both metallic and oxide forms on the catalyst surface.
