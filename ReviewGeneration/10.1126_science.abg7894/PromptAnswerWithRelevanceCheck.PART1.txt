1. Data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of >66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and >99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles).

2. The Pt/γ-Al2O3 (0.5 wt % Pt) catalyst exhibited relatively poor performance, with only 15% initial propane conversion (Fig. 1A, purple circles) and lower propylene selectivity (Fig. 1B, purple circles). Similarly, the commercial mimic Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts showed modest activity, with initial propane conversion of 22% (Fig. 1A, black triangles) and comparatively lower propylene selectivity (Fig. 1B, black triangles). 

3. Data in Fig. 2A and table S1 show the comparison of the initial (fresh catalyst) selectivity-conversion results reported for different catalysts. The slanted lines in the figure quantify the proximity of the measured conversion-selectivity data points to the highest possible conversion-selectivity lines for different conditions at which these catalysts were tested. The highest possible conversion-selectivity line has the value of 100% when the catalyst operates at equilibrium conversion and 100% propylene selectivity. By this metric, the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst outperformed other catalysts, reaching very close to the highest possible conversion-selectivity line (100% selectivity to propylene at equilibrium conversion), whereas other tested catalysts were mostly <80% of the highest possible performance.

2. The Pt/γ-Al2O3 (0.5 wt % Pt) catalyst exhibited relatively poor performance, with only 15% initial propane conversion (Fig. 1A, purple circles) and lower propylene selectivity (Fig. 1B, purple circles).

3. Data in Fig. 4, E and F, show the XANES spectra associated with the Pt LIII-edge and Sn K-edge, respectively, of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst and relevant controls. The Pt LIII-edge XANES spectra in Fig. 4E are consistent with the analysis of the EXAFS data, indicating that the mixing of Pt and Sn took place in the reduced Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst.

4. Figure 4B shows the XPS spectra associated with the Pt 4f7/2 electronic state, demonstrating that the Pt atoms were in the metallic Pt(0) state. Additionally, the Pt 4f7/2 peak shifted toward lower binding energy (70.5 eV) relative to a monometallic Pt reference (71.0 eV), in agreement with prior reports that the formation of PtSn caused a slight electron transfer from Sn to Pt that increased the local electron density on Pt and local Coulombic repulsion, thereby lowering the electron binding energy.
