1. Data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of >66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and >99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles).

2. The Pt/γ-Al2O3 (0.5 wt % Pt) catalyst exhibited relatively poor performance, with only 15% initial propane conversion (Fig. 1A, purple circles) and lower propylene selectivity (Fig. 1B, purple circles). Similarly, the commercial mimic Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts showed modest activity, with initial propane conversion of 22% (Fig. 1A, black triangles) and comparatively lower propylene selectivity (Fig. 1B, black triangles). 

3. Data in Fig. 2A and table S1 show the comparison of the initial (fresh catalyst) selectivity-conversion results reported for different catalysts. The slanted lines in the figure quantify the proximity of the measured conversion-selectivity data points to the highest possible conversion-selectivity lines for different conditions at which these catalysts were tested. The highest possible conversion-selectivity line has the value of 100% when the catalyst operates at equilibrium conversion and 100% propylene selectivity. By this metric, the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst outperformed other catalysts, reaching very close to the highest possible conversion-selectivity line (100% selectivity to propylene at equilibrium conversion), whereas other tested catalysts were mostly <80% of the highest possible performance.

1. The article evaluates Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 as a promising catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst shows near equilibrium conversion of >66% and >99% selectivity to propylene, while Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 only reaches 22% conversion with lower selectivity. 

2. The article does not investigate tuning metal oxide properties like oxidation state, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties.

3. The article does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied catalysts.

4. The article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in the catalysts.

5. The article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts.

6. The article does not investigate how properties like particle size and shape affect performance of supported metal catalysts. 

7. The article does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the catalysts.
