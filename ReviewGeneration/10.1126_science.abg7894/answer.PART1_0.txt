1. The article evaluates Pt-Sn supported on alumina as a promising catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing this catalyst achieves 22% propane conversion and comparatively lower propylene selectivity. It also provides insights that Pt and Sn atoms segregate on alumina, leading to deactivation.

2. The article does not investigate tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides for propane dehydrogenation.

3. The article does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts.

4. The article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

5. The article evaluates supported Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt/Al2O3 achieves only 15% propane conversion. It also characterizes the catalysts with TEM, XRD, XPS, EXAFS, etc. to gain insights into the structure-function relationships.

6. The article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of Pt-Sn/SiO2. It reveals small, intermetallic Pt-Sn nanoparticles interact weakly with silica support, preserving the mixing of Pt and Sn and achieving high activity and selectivity. 

7. The article does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the supported metal catalysts studied.
