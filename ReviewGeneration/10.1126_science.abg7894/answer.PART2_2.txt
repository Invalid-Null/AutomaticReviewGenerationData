[1] Data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of >66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and >99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles). 

[2] The Pt/γ-Al2O3 (0.5 wt % Pt) catalyst exhibited relatively poor performance, with only 15% initial propane conversion (Fig. 1A, purple circles) and lower propylene selectivity (Fig. 1B, purple circles). Similarly, the commercial mimic Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts showed modest activity, with initial propane conversion of 22% (Fig. 1A, black triangles) and comparatively lower propylene selectivity (Fig. 1B, black triangles).

2. Yes, the article evaluates the Pt-Sn alloy catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing that the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst has much higher conversion and selectivity compared to Pt/Al2O3 and commercial Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts. The Pt-Sn alloy shows superior performance due to high dispersion and mixing of Pt and Sn atoms.

[1] To establish that the mixing of Sn and Pt atoms in PtSn NPs extended to their surface, we used DRIFTS to measure the infrared absorption spectra of carbon monoxide (CO), as its adsorption on Pt surfaces has been well characterized. The CO-DRIFTS spectra for Pt/SiO2 and Pt1Sn1/SiO2 (Fig. 4A) revealed linear (on top) and bridge-bonded CO on Pt/SiO2 with infrared adsorption peaks at 2073 and 1821 cm1, respectively (56, 57). On Pt1Sn1/SiO2, the bridge-bonded CO was not present, and the linearly bonded peak had much lower intensity. Because CO does not adsorb at the bridge sites between Sn and Pt, the data suggest that Sn broke the ensembles of Pt atoms on the NP surfaces and created a checkerboard Pt-Sn surface structure (58). 

[2] The decreased intensity of the linearly bonded CO adsorption peak was consistent with reduced surface coverage of CO on the PtSn compared with Pt (59), further demonstrating the mixing of Pt and Sn in Pt1Sn1/SiO2. Introduction of Sn to the catalyst also slightly shifted the vibrational frequency of the linearly bonded CO band to 2078 cm1, indicating the perturbation of the electronic structure of surface Pt atoms by neighboring Sn atoms (56).

[3] Figure 4B shows the XPS spectra associated with the Pt 4f7/2 electronic state, demonstrating that the Pt atoms were in the metallic Pt(0) state. Additionally, the Pt 4f7/2 peak shifted toward lower binding energy (70.5 eV) relative to a monometallic Pt reference (71.0 eV), in agreement with prior reports that the formation of PtSn caused a slight electron transfer from Sn to Pt that increased the local electron density on Pt and local Coulombic repulsion, thereby lowering the electron binding energy (6062).

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of Sn in the Pt-Sn bimetallic catalyst. DRIFTS and XPS data reveal that Sn perturbs the electronic structure of Pt, causing electron transfer from Sn to Pt. Geometrically, Sn breaks up ensembles of Pt atoms and creates a checkerboard Pt-Sn structure, as evidenced by weakened CO adsorption.
