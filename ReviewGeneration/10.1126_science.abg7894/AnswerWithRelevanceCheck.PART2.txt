         [1] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation."
         [2] "Relative to the Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts in which Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on Al2O3 and modified by the addition of a post-transition metal such as tin (Sn) exhibit higher selectivity." 
         [3] "Performance depends critically on forming intermetallic PtSn NPs that improve propylene selectivity and enhance stability by reducing the rate of hydrogenolysis and coke formation (12)."

         Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that Pt-Sn nanoparticles supported on silica exhibit excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%) without the need for hydrogen dilution. The intermetallic Pt-Sn nanoparticles are critical for achieving high propylene selectivity and stability compared to Pt nanoparticles alone.

         回答:是的,文中评估了Pt-Sn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。结果显示,硅胶载体上的Pt-Sn纳米粒子展现出优异的稳定性和高于99%的丙烯选择性,而无需氢稀释。与仅含Pt纳米粒子相比,Pt-Sn金属间化合物纳米粒子对于获得高丙烯选择性和稳定性至关重要。

         [1] "To establish that the mixing of Sn and Pt atoms in PtSn NPs extended to their surface, we used DRIFTS to measure the infrared absorption spectra of carbon monoxide (CO), as its adsorption on Pt surfaces has been well characterized."  
         [2] "The CO-DRIFTS spectra for Pt/SiO2 and Pt1Sn1/SiO2 (Fig. 4A) revealed linear (on top) and bridge-bonded CO on Pt/SiO2 with infrared adsorption peaks at 2073 and 1821 cm−1, respectively (56, 57). On Pt1Sn1/SiO2, the bridge-bonded CO was not present, and the linearly bonded peak had much lower intensity. Because CO does not adsorb at the bridge sites between Sn and Pt, the data suggest that Sn broke the ensembles of Pt atoms on the NP surfaces and created a checkerboard Pt-Sn surface structure (58)."
         [3] "Furthermore, the Sn 3d5/2 XPS spectra in Fig. 4C show that most Sn atoms were metallic Sn, and a small fraction of Sn existed as SnO or SnO2, further confirming the formation of PtSn intermetallic NPs (63, 64)."  
         [4] "The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms."

         Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Sn in the Pt-Sn bimetallic catalyst. DRIFTS and XPS data indicate Sn modifies the electronic structure of Pt and breaks up Pt ensembles on the nanoparticle surface, creating a Pt-Sn checkerboard structure. EXAFS confirms the intermixing of Pt and Sn atoms. These electronic and geometric effects of Sn are critical for achieving high selectivity and stability.

         回答:是的,文中探究了二元Pt-Sn催化剂中掺杂金属Sn的电子和几何效应。DRIFTS和XPS数据表明,Sn改变了Pt的电子结构,打断了纳米粒子表面上的Pt原子团簇,形成Pt-Sn棋盘结构。EXAFS证实了Pt和Sn原子的混合。Sn的这些电子和几何效应对获得高选择性和稳定性至关重要。
