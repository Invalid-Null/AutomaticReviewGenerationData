[1] Similarly, the commercial mimic Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts showed modest activity, with initial propane conversion of 22% (Fig. 1A, black triangles) and comparatively lower propylene selectivity (Fig. 1B, black triangles). 
[2] Data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of >66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and >99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles).  
[3] To further confirm the presence of PtSn surface alloys, XPS of the freshly reduced Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed that the atomic ratio of Pt and Sn was 1, consistent with the nominal loading (fig. S8). Figure 4B shows the XPS spectra associated with the Pt 4f7/2 electronic state, demonstrating that the Pt atoms were in the metallic Pt(0) state. Additionally, the Pt 4f7/2 peak shifted toward lower binding energy (70.5 eV) relative to a monometallic Pt reference (71.0 eV), in agreement with prior reports that the formation of PtSn caused a slight electron transfer from Sn to Pt that increased the local electron density on Pt and local Coulombic repulsion, thereby lowering the electron binding energy (6062). Furthermore, the Sn 3d5/2 XPS spectra in Fig. 4C show that most Sn atoms were metallic Sn, and a small fraction of Sn existed as SnO or SnO2, further confirming the formation of PtSn intermetallic NPs (63, 64).

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of >66% and >99% selectivity to propylene, significantly outperforming the commercial Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. XPS and other characterization confirmed the presence of PtSn intermetallic nanoparticles with electron transfer from Sn to Pt, contributing to the enhanced performance.

[1] Additionally, the Pt 4f7/2 peak shifted toward lower binding energy (70.5 eV) relative to a monometallic Pt reference (71.0 eV), in agreement with prior reports that the formation of PtSn caused a slight electron transfer from Sn to Pt that increased the local electron density on Pt and local Coulombic repulsion, thereby lowering the electron binding energy (6062).
[2] The data above show that the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts exhibited very high productivity and stability compared with other catalysts. Because the dehydrogenation reaction is operated under carbon-rich reducing conditions, it is inevitable that, over time, catalyst deactivation due to deposition of solid carbon would compromise the performance of the catalysts. To investigate whether this Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst can be regenerated, we intentionally increased the rate of catalyst deactivation by increasing the propane flow rate (i.e., propane WHSV) and diluting the propane stream (which increases the propane equilibrium conversion). These conditions push the catalysts away from the equilibrium conversion and lead to a more rapid, forced carbon-induced deactivation. The data in fig. S5 show that, under these conditions, the propane conversion goes from 41 to 39% in 120 min. Under identical conditions, the other tested catalysts deactivate very rapidly to very low conversion, as illustrated for the commercial mimic. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the spent catalyst, after 120 min of PDH reaction, is shown in fig. S6. The image shows that the Pt-Sn NPs are well dispersed, with an average particle diameter of 1.6 ± 0.67 nm, which is consistent with the particle size in fresh samples.

Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of Sn in the PtSn bimetallic catalyst. It shows that Sn causes a slight electron transfer to Pt, increasing local electron density on Pt and lowering binding energy, which contributes to enhanced catalytic performance. TEM also confirmed small, well-dispersed PtSn nanoparticles, preserving the Pt-Sn mixing and minimizing aggregation.

答:是的,该文研究了Sn在PtSn双金属催化剂中的电子和几何效应。它表明Sn导致略微的电子转移到Pt,增加Pt上的局部电子密度并降低结合能,这有助于提高催化性能。TEM也确认了小的、分散良好的PtSn纳米粒子,保持了Pt-Sn的混合并最小化了聚集。
