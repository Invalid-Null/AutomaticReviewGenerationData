[1] Relative to the Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts in which Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on Al2O3 and modified by the addition of a post-transition metal such as tin (Sn) exhibit higher selectivity. 
[2] We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation.
[3] Data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of >66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and >99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles).

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It develops a silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticle catalyst that achieves near thermodynamic limit conversion (>66%) and >99% propylene selectivity without hydrogen dilution of the feed. This superior performance is attributed to the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms in the nanoparticles.

[1] Because CO does not adsorb at the bridge sites between Sn and Pt, the data suggest that Sn broke the ensembles of Pt atoms on the NP surfaces and created a checkerboard Pt-Sn surface structure (58). The decreased intensity of the linearly bonded CO adsorption peak was consistent with reduced surface coverage of CO on the PtSn compared with Pt (59), further demonstrating the mixing of Pt and Sn in Pt1Sn1/SiO2.
[2] The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms. The best-fit spectrum for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst is characterized by the presence of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn scattering paths, consistent with the formation of PtSn intermetallic phases.  
[3] Likewise, the slight increase in Sn K-edge energy and the increase in the white-line intensity relative to Sn foil in (Fig. 4F) indicated that Sn existed in both metallic and oxide forms on the catalyst surface.

Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary Sn metal in the Pt-Sn bimetallic catalyst using CO-DRIFTS, XPS, EXAFS, and XANES. It shows that Sn modifies the electronic structure of Pt, weakens CO adsorption, and mixes with Pt geometrically to form Pt-Sn intermetallic phases with both Pt-Pt and Pt-Sn bonds. This synergistic electronic and geometric modulation enhances catalyst performance.

回答:是的,文章使用CO-DRIFTS、XPS、EXAFS和XANES研究了Pt-Sn双金属催化剂中辅助Sn金属的电子和几何效应。它表明Sn改变了Pt的电子结构,削弱了CO吸附,并与Pt几何混合形成具有Pt-Pt和Pt-Sn键的Pt-Sn中间相。这种协同的电子和几何调控增强了催化剂性能。
