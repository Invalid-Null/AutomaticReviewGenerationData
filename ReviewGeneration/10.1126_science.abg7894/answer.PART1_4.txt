1. Data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of >66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and >99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles). 

2. The Pt/γ-Al2O3 (0.5 wt % Pt) catalyst exhibited relatively poor performance, with only 15% initial propane conversion (Fig. 1A, purple circles) and lower propylene selectivity (Fig. 1B, purple circles).

3. Data in Fig. 4, E and F, show the XANES spectra associated with the Pt LIII-edge and Sn K-edge, respectively, of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst and relevant controls. The Pt LIII-edge XANES spectra in Fig. 4E are consistent with the analysis of the EXAFS data, indicating that the mixing of Pt and Sn took place in the reduced Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst.

4. Figure 4B shows the XPS spectra associated with the Pt 4f7/2 electronic state, demonstrating that the Pt atoms were in the metallic Pt(0) state. Additionally, the Pt 4f7/2 peak shifted toward lower binding energy (70.5 eV) relative to a monometallic Pt reference (71.0 eV), in agreement with prior reports that the formation of PtSn caused a slight electron transfer from Sn to Pt that increased the local electron density on Pt and local Coulombic repulsion, thereby lowering the electron binding energy.

1. No, the article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3 or Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on supported Pt-Sn nanoparticle catalysts.

2. No, the article does not investigate how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It does not study metal oxide catalysts.

3. No, the article does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts. It studies supported Pt-Sn nanoparticle catalysts instead.

4. No, the article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on supported Pt-Sn nanoparticle catalysts. 

5. Yes, the article evaluates a supported mono-metallic Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It showed relatively poor performance with only 15% initial propane conversion and lower propylene selectivity compared to the Pt-Sn catalysts.

6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported Pt-Sn nanoparticle catalysts. It shows smaller, well-dispersed Pt-Sn nanoparticles on SiO2 support outperform larger Pt-Sn particles on Al2O3 support.

7. No, the article does not propose detailed mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the studied supported metal catalysts. It focuses more on catalyst characterization and performance evaluation.
