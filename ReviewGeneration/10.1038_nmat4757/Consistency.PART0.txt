 Based on the provided correct answers and answer files, here is the JSON structure comparing the consistency of each answer file:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART0_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART0_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART0_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART0_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer.PART0_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART0_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART0_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I carefully compared each answer file to the correct answers for all 7 questions. The responses in each answer file are fully consistent with the correct answers, so the consistency ratio is 100% for all files across all questions.
