         [1] "Nevertheless, their size distributions (Fig. 5f-h) show that most of the small Pt NPs are still below 2 nm, indicating the high stability of encapsulated Pt species in MCM-22 crystallites during the very extreme oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C."
         [2] "In the case of Pt/MCM-22-imp, oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C lead to continuous growth of Pt NPs (images are presented from Supplementary Figs 19 to 22 and the size distributions of Pt NPs are shown in Supplementary Fig. 23)."
         [3] "As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 24, Pt@MCM-22 exhibits higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550°C. Moreover, after five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550°C during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, Pt@MCM-22 sample retains 90% of its initial activity while Pt/MCM-22-imp has lost more than 40% of its initial activity."

         Yes, the article evaluates encapsulating metal species like platinum inside the pores and cavities of zeolite supports like MCM-22 in order to enhance the stability of propane dehydrogenation catalysts during high temperature operation and oxidation-reduction cycles. Data shows the encapsulated platinum nanoparticles in Pt@MCM-22 exhibit much better stability against sintering and agglomeration compared to conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22-imp after treatments at 650C. The encapsulated Pt@MCM-22 also retains 90% initial activity after 5 propane dehydrogenation cycles at 550C while the impregnated catalyst lost over 40%.

         是的,该文评估了将铂等金属种封装在MCM-22等分子筛内的孔隙和空穴中,以提高丙烷脱氢催化剂在高温操作和氧化-还原循环期间的稳定性。数据显示,与常规浸渍的Pt/MCM-22-imp相比,在650°C处理后,封装的铂纳米粒子Pt@MCM-22表现出更好的抗烧结和聚集稳定性。在550°C进行5个丙烷脱氢循环后,封装的Pt@MCM-22仍保持90%的初始活性,而浸渍催化剂损失超过40%。

         [1] "Subnanometric Pt species were prepared using dimethylformamide (DMF) as a weak reduction and capping agent."

         [2] "Incorporation of subnanometric Pt species was carried out during the swelling process of the lamellar zeolitic precursor (MWW(P)), which can be monitored by X-ray diffraction." 

         [3] "Pt clusters and individual Pt atoms with fine dispersion can be distinguished clearly in the HAADF-HRSTEM images."

      <English>
         Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses DMF as a weak reducing and capping agent to prepare subnanometric Pt species (Quote 1). It incorporates the Pt species during swelling of a lamellar zeolite precursor, monitored by XRD (Quote 2). HAADF-HRSTEM shows finely dispersed Pt clusters and atoms (Quote 3).

         Yes, the article employs advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques, including high-resolution STEM imaging with a high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector, to characterize the metal-support interfaces and locations of platinum species within the MCM-22 zeolite support at the atomic level. Images reveal isolated platinum atoms and clusters confined within the micropores of the support.
