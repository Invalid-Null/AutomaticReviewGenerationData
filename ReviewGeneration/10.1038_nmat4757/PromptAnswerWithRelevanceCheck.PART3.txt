[1] "Nevertheless, their size distributions (Fig. 5f-h) show that most of the small Pt NPs are still below 2 nm, indicating the high stability of encapsulated Pt species in MCM-22 crystallites during the very extreme oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C."
[2] "In the case of Pt/MCM-22-imp, oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C lead to continuous growth of Pt NPs (images are presented from Supplementary Figs 19 to 22 and the size distributions of Pt NPs are shown in Supplementary Fig. 23)."
[3] "As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 24, Pt@MCM-22 exhibits higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550°C. Moreover, after five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550°C during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, Pt@MCM-22 sample retains 90% of its initial activity while Pt/MCM-22-imp has lost more than 40% of its initial activity."

<English version answer>

23. Yes, the article evaluates encapsulating metal species like platinum inside the pores and cavities of zeolite supports like MCM-22 in order to enhance the stability of propane dehydrogenation catalysts during high temperature operation and oxidation-reduction cycles. Data shows the encapsulated platinum nanoparticles in Pt@MCM-22 exhibit much better stability against sintering and agglomeration compared to conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22-imp after treatments at 650C. The encapsulated Pt@MCM-22 also retains 90% initial activity after 5 propane dehydrogenation cycles at 550C while the impregnated catalyst lost over 40%.
