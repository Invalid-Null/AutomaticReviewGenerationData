[1] "we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.5-0.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."

[2] "It will be shown that subtle changes in the structural features of the subnanometric PtSn clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional characterization techniques, can drastically affect their performance for propane dehydrogenation."  

[3] "the high initial activity, very slow deactivation and size of the subnanometric PtSn clusters were preserved for three reaction cycles."

[2] "Initially, a K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample (containing 0.4wt% Pt, 0.9wt% Sn and 0.6wt% K) was prepared by a one-pot synthesis according to our previously reported method and then calcined in air, giving rise to atomically dispersed Pt and Sn species in pure silica MFI zeolite."

[3] "To ensure the presence of atomically dispersed Pt atoms in the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample, a reference K-MFI sample (without Sn or Pt) was analysed and compared."

[1] "Structural modulation and direct measurement of subnanometric bimetallic PtSn clusters confined in zeolites"  

[2] "The geometric and electronic structures of subnanometric bimetallic clusters in confined space may be different from the corresponding nanoparticles supported on open-structure carriers, which can lead to unique reactivity. Combining multiple in situ characterization techniques (both averaging techniques such as EXAFS and site-specific techniques such as IR and TEM) is critical to elucidating the nature of the active sites in supported catalysts containing isolated atoms and/or clusters."

[3] "Characterization of PtSn clusters by CO adsorption"

[4] "To detect possible PtSn interactions in the reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples, we employed IR spectroscopy using CO as a probe molecule to investigate the electronic properties of the Pt species."

[5] "The formation of interactions between Pt clusters and partially reduced Sn species during the H2 treatment is also reflected in the changes in the CO absorption bands in the range 1,850-1,650cm-1."

[1] "HR-HAADF-STEM images (a,c) and the corresponding iDPC images (b,d) of the same area of the K-Pt@MFI-Air sample, showing the presence of singly dispersed Pt and Sn atoms in the sinusoidal channels."

[3] "To quantitatively describe the spatial distribution of subnanometric Pt and Sn in the various K-PtSn@MFI samples, the HR-HAADF-STEM images were analysed by a modified K-means clustering method (an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for signal processing, as explained in Supplementary Figs. 32 and 33)" 

[4] "We have found that as the reduction time increases, the percentage of bimetallic PtSn clusters in the K-PtSn@MFI sample also increases, reaching >40% in both the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h samples."

[1] "The chemical states of Pt in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample during H2 reduction at 600C were investigated by in situ XAS. It was found that, regardless of the reduction time, the Pt species in the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample were completely reduced to metallic Pt at 600C (ref. 14), as inferred by the intensity of the white line in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra compared with a Pt foil reference (Fig. 2a) and the appearance of PtPt contributions in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra (Fig. 2b and Table 1)."

[2] "The nature of the Sn species and their coordination environments in the K-PtSn@MFI samples were also studied by Sn K-edge XAS. Sn is inferred to be Sn(IV) in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample, as indicated by the pronounced white line in the XANES spectra (Fig. 2c). After treatment with H2 at 600C, the Sn(IV) species are reduced to Sn species with an average of approximately three SnO bonds, according to the EXAFS data (Table 1), and a white line intensity that matches that of Sn(II) in a bulk SnO standard." 

[3] "Within the sensitivity limits of XANES, the chemical states of Sn remain unchanged when the reduction time at 600C is extended from 0 to 22h. Fitting of the EXAFS spectra also shows almost the same SnO coordination number regardless of the reduction time (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 17)."

Yes, the article utilizes in-situ XAS to probe changes in Pt and Sn oxidation states during H2 reduction at 600°C. It shows complete reduction of Pt species to metallic Pt, while Sn(IV) is reduced to Sn(II) species bonded to oxygen, with little change in average Sn speciation at longer reduction times.
