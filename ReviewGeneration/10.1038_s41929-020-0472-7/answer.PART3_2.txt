[1] "To understand the interaction between the subnanometric Pt and Sn species, we have employed several characterization techniques, including XAS, quasi in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and CO infrared (CO-IR) spectroscopy."

[2] "The STEM images show that the majority of the metal reassembles as subnanometric clusters of 0.50.6nm during the H2 treatment (Fig. 1)." 

[3] "Interestingly, these properties can be controlled by varying the reduction time, following a change in structure that is too subtle to be detected by EXAFS24."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It utilizes techniques like XAS, TEM, and CO-IR spectroscopy to understand the interaction between subnanometric Pt and Sn species. It shows that the metals reassemble as small clusters during H2 treatment, and that varying the reduction time can control catalytic properties by inducing subtle structural changes.

[1] "The chemical states of Pt in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample during H2 reduction at 600C were investigated by in situ XAS." 

[2] "The nature of the Sn species and their coordination environments in the K-PtSn@MFI samples were also studied by Sn K-edge XAS."

[3] "Within the sensitivity limits of XANES, the chemical states of Sn remain unchanged when the reduction time at 600C is extended from 0 to 22h. Fitting of the EXAFS spectra also shows almost the same SnO coordination number regardless of the reduction time (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 17)."

6. Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it uses in-situ XAS at the Pt LIII and Sn K-edges to investigate the chemical states and coordination environments of Pt and Sn species during H2 reduction at 600C. It shows that the average Sn oxidation state remains largely unchanged with increasing reduction time, even though catalytic performance improves.
