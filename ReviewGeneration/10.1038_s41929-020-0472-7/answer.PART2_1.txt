[1] Furthermore, the electronic structures and surface properties of bimetallic nanoparticles are strongly dependent on the spatial distribution of the two elements. By tuning the procedure for preparing the bimetallic nanoparticles or by post-synthetic treatments, the spatial distribution of the two elements as well as their chemical states can be modified and, thus, their reactivity.

[2] The geometric and electronic structures of subnanometric bimetallic clusters in confined space may be different from the corresponding nanoparticles supported on open-structure carriers, which can lead to unique reactivity.

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Sn in the PtSn bimetallic clusters. It explains that the spatial distribution and chemical states of the two metals influence the electronic structure and reactivity of the bimetallic clusters. It also notes that confining subnanometric bimetallic clusters in zeolite channels leads to different geometric and electronic structures compared to nanoparticles on open supports.
