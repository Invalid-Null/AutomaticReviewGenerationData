[1] "The chemical states of Pt in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample during H2 reduction at 600C were investigated by in situ XAS. It was found that, regardless of the reduction time, the Pt species in the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample were completely reduced to metallic Pt at 600C (ref. 14), as inferred by the intensity of the white line in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra compared with a Pt foil reference (Fig. 2a) and the appearance of PtPt contributions in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra (Fig. 2b and Table 1)."

Sn is inferred to be Sn(IV) in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample, as indicated by the pronounced white line in the XANES spectra (Fig. 2c). After treatment with H2 at 600C, the Sn(IV) species are reduced to Sn species with an average of approximately three SnO bonds, according to the EXAFS data (Table 1), and a white line intensity that matches that of Sn(II) in a bulk SnO standard."

1. To prepare the bimetallic catalysts, a solution containing the Pt and Sn precursors was added to the zeolite synthesis gel. The resultant mixture was then hydrothermally treated to incorporate isolated Pt and Sn species into the zeolite framework. 
2. The PtSn clusters are mainly located in the sinusoidal channels. Even though coke formation is associated with catalytic events occurring at the metal surface, the resulting carbonaceous species seem not to remain directly blocking the active sites. The extended lifetimes of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h samples could be associated with much less deposition of coke on the PtSn clusters, leading to lower deactivation rates.
