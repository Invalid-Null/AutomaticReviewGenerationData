[1] Furthermore, the electronic structures and surface properties of bimetallic nanoparticles are strongly dependent on the spatial distribution of the two elements. By tuning the procedure for preparing the bimetallic nanoparticles or by post-synthetic treatments, the spatial distribution of the two elements as well as their chemical states can be modified and, thus, their reactivity.
