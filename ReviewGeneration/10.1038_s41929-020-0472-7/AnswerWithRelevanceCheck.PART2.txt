           [1] This work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance.

          Yes, the article evaluates bimetallic PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on propane conversion and propylene selectivity for PtSn clusters confined in MFI zeolite channels. The PtSn clusters show high initial activity and selectivity, along with greatly suppressed deactivation compared to monometallic Pt, which is attributed to ensemble and electronic effects of incorporating Sn.

          是的,本文评估了双金属PtSn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供了受限在MFI分子筛通道中的PtSn簇的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性的数据。与单金属Pt相比,PtSn簇表现出高的初始活性、选择性和大大抑制的失活,这归因于掺入Sn的集聚效应和电子效应。

         [1] Furthermore, the electronic structures and surface properties of bimetallic nanoparticles are strongly dependent on the spatial distribution of the two elements. By tuning the procedure for preparing the bimetallic nanoparticles or by post-synthetic treatments, the spatial distribution of the two elements as well as their chemical states can be modified and, thus, their reactivity.
         
         [2] The geometric and electronic structures of subnanometric bimetallic clusters in confined space may be different from the corresponding nanoparticles supported on open-structure carriers, which can lead to unique reactivity.

         Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Sn in the PtSn bimetallic clusters. It explains that the spatial distribution and chemical states of the two metals influence the electronic structure and reactivity of the bimetallic clusters. It also notes that confining subnanometric bimetallic clusters in zeolite channels leads to different geometric and electronic structures compared to nanoparticles on open supports.
