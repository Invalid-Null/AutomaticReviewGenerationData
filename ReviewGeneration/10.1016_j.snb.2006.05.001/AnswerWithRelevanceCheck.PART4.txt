Unfortunately, upon review, the provided answers do not contain information relevant to answering the list of questions asked. The answers focus solely on analyzing the detection mechanism of propane by gallium oxynitride gas sensors. They do not discuss process intensification approaches, techno-economic analyses, safety issues, remaining challenges and knowledge gaps, high-throughput computational techniques, needs for improved characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures related to propane dehydrogenation specifically.

As the answers are not pertinent to the propane dehydrogenation questions posed, I have stopped the review process and responded with the specified sentence indicating the irrelevance of the provided answers. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
