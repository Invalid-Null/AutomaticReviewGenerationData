I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

Kinetic Isotopic Effects in Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane on Vanadium Oxide Catalysts
Abstract
Kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs) for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were measured on 10 wt% V2O5/ZrO2. Normal KIEs were obtained using CH3CH2CH3 and CD3CD2CD3 as reactants for primary dehydrogenation (2.8) and combustion (1.9) of propane and for secondary combustion of propene (2.6), suggesting that in all cases CH bond dissociation is a kinetically relevant step. CH3CH2CH3 and CH3CD2CH3 reactants led to normal KIEs for dehydrogenation (2.7) and combustion (1.8) of propane, but to a very small KIE (1.1) for propene combustion. These results show that the methylene CH bond is activated in the rate-determining steps for propane dehydrogenation and combustion reactions. The rate-determining step in secondary propene combustion involves the allylic CH bond. In each reaction, the weakest CH bond in the reactant is cleaved in the initial CH bond activation step. The measured propane oxidative dehydrogenation KIEs are in agreement with theoretical estimates using a sequence of elementary steps, reaction rate expression, and transition state theory. The much smaller KIE for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (2.8) than the maximum KIE (6) expected for propane thermal dehydrogenation indicates the participation of lattice oxygen. The different KIE values for propane primary dehydrogenation and combustion suggest that these two reactions involve different lattice oxygen sites.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
