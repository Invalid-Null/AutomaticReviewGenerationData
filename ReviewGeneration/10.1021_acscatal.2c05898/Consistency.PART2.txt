 Here is the analysis comparing the answer files to the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%", 
    "answer1.txt": "0%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%", 
    "answer4.txt": "0%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "0%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "0%"
  },
  "3": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "0%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "0%"
  },
  "4": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "0%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "0%"
  },
  "5": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "0%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "0%"
  },
  "6": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "0%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "0%"
  },
  "7": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "0%", 
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "0%"
  }
}
```

The analysis shows that for questions 1-5, all answer files had 0% consistency with the correct answers, as they did not contain relevant information. 

For question 6, only answer0.txt had 100% consistency as it provided the correct response. The other files had 0% consistency.

For question 7, all files again had 0% consistency as they did not provide the correct response.

Overall, this literature did not contain much relevant information to address the specific questions asked, with only one file providing the fully correct response for a single question. All other questions had completely inconsistent responses across all answer files.
