Zinc Speciation and Propane Dehydrogenation in Zn/H-ZSM-5 Catalysts
Abstract
Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have been frequently investigated for propane dehydrogenation (PDH); however, the active site remains unresolved due to the complexity of the system. We employed in situ FTIR spectroscopy and a kinetics method to correlate the Zn speciation and PDH activity in Zn/H-ZSM-5 with two Si/Al ratios (15 and 39) and a range of Zn/Al ratios (01.7). Incremental additions of zinc show that Zn2+ sites are preferentially formed on H-ZSM-5 over a fraction of paired Al sites followed by [Zn-O-Zn]2+ and [ZnOH]+ sites and then ZnOx clusters. The [Zn-OH]+ and [Zn-O-Zn]2+ sites in H-ZSM-5 are more active and selective than isolated Zn2+ for PDH. [Zn-OH]+ species sublimate over time on stream, leading to catalyst deactivation, while [Zn-O-Zn]2+ species are stable even after high-temperature reduction (750 C for 60 min). Three distinct Zn sites ([Zn-O-Zn]2+, Zn2+, and [ZnOH]+) show a similar propane reaction order (close to 1) and H2 reaction order (close to 0). Combined with the lack of Zn hydride when propane flows over the catalyst at 550 C, it is concluded that propane adsorption and dissociation is a rate-determining step and H2 desorption is fast. This work indicates that the preparation of H-ZSM-5 with abundant Al pairs may be a strategy to form stable and selective Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It is also highlighted that examining the effect of both metal/Al ratios and Al distribution of the zeolite is crucial in identifying the metal cations in metalzeolite systems.

Propylene, an essential building block for producing polypropylene, acrylic acid, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile, has been mainly obtained as a byproduct from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) units in refineries. (1,2) Due to the growing demand for propylene and the large supply of shale gas, on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is increasingly important. (36) Two processes have been industrialized for this reaction: the Oleflex process (Pt-Sn based catalyst) and the Catofin process (CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst); however, the high cost of Pt and the toxicity of Cr motivates the search for alternative low-cost and environmentally friendly catalysts. (1,7,8) Many catalysts, in fact, show promising PDH performance: Ga-, (914) V-, (15,16) Zn-, (1719) Co-, (2022) Fe-, (2326) Zr-, (2729) Sn-, (30) In-based catalysts, (31,32) and nanocarbon materials. (33) Metal cations exchanged with zeolite catalysts (Ga/H-ZSM-5, Zn/H-ZSM-5, Co/H-ZSM-5) are efficient for propane dehydrogenation with approximately 90% C3H6 selectivity. (3436) However, the elucidation of the structure of metal cation species on zeolites remains unresolved and essential for catalyst improvement. (3741)
In recent reports, (35,42,43) we combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that Ga exchanged with paired framework Al atoms (Ga2O22+) differ in three ways from isolated Ga+ sites: (1) Ga2O22+ cannot be reduced at 550 C in the presence of H2, while isolated Ga+ shows well-defined redox capability. (2) Ga2O22+ can form Ga hydrides (evidenced by 2037 and 2053 cm1 peaks in FTIR) at 550 C upon contacting the sample with H2, while isolated Ga+ cannot. (3) Ga2O22+ exhibits 18 times higher PDH rates than isolated Ga+ sites.
Zn/H-ZSM-5, another promising PDH catalyst, has also been investigated in detail. (18,44,45) However, which Zn species are the active center for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions remains unresolved. Multiple types of Zn species exist in Zn/H-ZSM-5: isolated Zn2+, [ZnOH]+, [Zn-O-Zn]2+, multinuclear ZnOx clusters, and bulk ZnO aggregates. (18,4446) Typically, Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are prepared by the liquid ion-exchange (IE) method to obtain isolated Zn species; however, it is possible to simultaneously introduce a heterogeneous distribution of Zn species including ZnOx clusters and bulk ZnO. (18) Almutairi et al. (18) used chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to prepare Zn/H-ZSM-5 with all Brnsted acid sites (BASs) replaced by isolated Zn2+: this sample was less active for PDH than the samples prepared by IE and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI). Gong et al. (45) applied atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO to H-ZSM-5 and showed that isolated [ZnOH]+ is the predominant form after the first cycle of ALD. The [ZnOH]+ is more active for PDH than bulky ZnO clusters formed after several ALD cycles. However, Nozik et al. (36) recently employed solid-state ion exchange of ZnCl2 with H-ZSM-5 to prepare Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts and pointed out that Zn2+ is the active site. (36)
These disparate conclusions may result from the different catalyst preparation methods (IE, IWI, CVD, ALD, or solid-state ion exchange with ZnCl2), leading to the formation of multiple Zn species. Another reason might be the lack of understanding of the effect of the Si/Al ratio on Zn speciation, although Bell and coworkers have investigated Zn/Al ratios in detail. (36) The difference between the properties of the different Zn species, such as the ability to form hydrides and PDH performance, are far from being understood.
In this work, the Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM-5 with two Si/Al ratios (15 and 39) and Zn/Al ratios (01.7) has been investigated by in situ FTIR spectroscopy and kinetic methods. We first characterize the Zn speciation and find that the Zn2+ site is preferentially introduced on H-ZSM-5 at paired Al sites followed by the formation of [Zn-O-Zn]2+ and [Zn-OH]+ and then ZnOx clusters. Importantly, isolated Zn2+, [Zn-OH]+, and [Zn-O-Zn]2+ cannot form Zn hydride upon H2 contact at 550 C while the ZnOx clusters in H-ZSM-5 can form observable Zn hydride (1934 cm1 in FTIR). Then, the PDH performance of these Zn species was examined. The [Zn-OH]+ and [Zn-O-Zn]2+ in H-ZSM-5 show higher PDH rates and C3H6 selectivity than isolated Zn2+. Next, the catalyst stability of the three distinct sites is discussed. Although [Zn-OH]+ is unstable due to reduction and sublimation, [Zn-O-Zn]2+ associated with paired framework Al atoms is stable after high-temperature reduction (750 C for 60 min). Finally, the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation is discussed over the three different Zn sites.

Catalyst Preparation
Commercial NH4-ZSM-5 samples (Zeolyst CBV 3024E, CBV 5524G, and CBV 8014) were calcined in flowing air at 550 C for 8 h with a ramp rate of 2 C·min1 to obtain the parent H-ZSM-5 samples with different Si/Al ratios. The Si/Al ratios of the samples determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) were 15.4  1.3, 27.5  1.9, and 39.0  2.8, respectively. (42) The BAS densities determined by pyridine adsorption FTIR spectroscopy were 636, 460, and 281 μmol·g1, respectively. (42) Ga/H-ZSM-5(X, Y) and Zn/H-ZSM-5(X, Y) samples were obtained via the IWI method with gallium nitrate hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) or zinc nitrate hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution, then dried at 80 C for 6 h, and calcined at 600 C for 2 h. X and Y represent the Si/Al ratio and metal/Al ratio (Ga/Al or Zn/Al), respectively. Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 0.2)-IE and Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, 0.32)-IE samples were prepared by ion exchange of H-ZSM-5 with zinc nitrate solution (0.05 M) at 80 C for 16 h. After ion exchange, the samples were centrifuged and washed with deionized water, and the washing procedure was repeated 6 times followed by the same drying and calcination procedure as the preparation of Zn/H-ZSM-5(X, Y) catalysts. Zn/Al2O3 (8 wt % Zn) and Zn/SiO2 (8 wt % Zn) were prepared via the IWI method using Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar) and SiO2 (from Sigma-Aldrich, silica gel davisil, grade 646). ZnO was obtained by calcinating zinc nitrate hydrate at 600 C in flowing air for 2 h with a ramp rate of 5 C·min1.
Co2+ exchanged H-ZSM-5 samples (referred to as Co-H-ZSM-5, Si/Al = 15) were prepared by following the procedure reported elsewhere via liquid phase ion exchange of NH4-ZSM-5 with a Co(NO3)2 solution (0.01 M) at 80 C for 24 h followed by washing, drying, and calcination. (35) The Co/Al ratio was determined to be 0.22 by XRF. Zn/Co-H-ZSM-5(X, Y) samples, where X and Y represent the Si/Al and Zn/Al ratios, respectively, were prepared via the IWI method using Co-H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15 and Co/Al = 0.22) as the support.
Materials Characterization
The micropore volume of the samples was determined by N2 adsorption at 196 C and the t plot method. N2 adsorption isotherms were collected on a 3flex instrument. All samples were degassed at 300 C for 24 h before the adsorption measurements. Elemental analysis was performed by XRF (Rigaku WDXRF). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted on a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA) in the range of 2θ = 480 with a step size of 0.04 and 0.5 s per step. The H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles of the as-prepared catalysts were obtained using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 equipped with a TCD detector. About 0.1 g of the catalyst was pretreated in He flow (50 mL·min1) at 200 C for 1 h and then cooled to 60 C. The temperature-programmed reduction measurement was conducted by heating the sample to 800 C with a ramp rate of 10 C·min1 in a flow of 10 vol % H2/Ar (50 mL·min1). Diffused reflectance UVvis spectra on Zn-containing and Co-containing samples were collected on a UVvis spectrometer (JASCO, V-550) with around 100 mg of the catalyst loaded into the cell to completely cover the window. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed in a thermo-fisher Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic aluminum Kα X-ray source (300400 nm). TGA was performed on a Discovery TGA instrument with a ramp rate of 10 C·min1 to 750 C under air flow (100 mL·min1). In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments were performed on a Nicolet 6700 instrument equipped with a Harrick drifts cell at ambient pressure.
Transmission Fourier Transformed Infrared Studies
In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected on an Agilent CARY 660 spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector. (42) The catalyst was pressed into a self-supporting wafer of about 20 mg and then loaded into a custom-made sample holder for vertical alignment in the infrared beam using a customized in situ transmission cell equipped with KBr windows. The spectra are the result of 128 coadded scans at a spectral resolution of 2 cm1. The vacuum level of <0.01 mTorr in the transmission cell was achieved by connecting to a vacuum manifold equipped with a mechanical pump and a diffusion pump. The transmission cell was heated by heating tape controlled by a PID controller with the thermocouple close to the sample wafer. Before all experiments, samples were dehydrated at 550 C for 30 min under a vacuum to remove all adsorbed molecules. Chemicals such as H2 and D2 were introduced into the transmission cell and the corresponding pressure was controlled through the vacuum manifold.
In situ transmission FTIR using pyridine as a probe molecule was employed to monitor the presence of BASs and Lewis acid sites (LASs). (42) A self-supporting wafer (20 mg) was dehydrated at 550 C for 30 min and then treated with H2 (1 atm) at the same temperature, introducing H2 into the transmission cell 3 times for 10 min each to ensure complete reduction of the catalyst. The sample was then cooled to 150 C under vacuum, and then the excess pyridine was introduced into the transmission cell followed by evacuation. The dosing procedure was repeated 3 times to ensure that the sample was fully saturated with pyridine. Next, the transmission cell was evacuated for 15 min to remove the physisorbed pyridine before collecting the spectrum. All infrared spectra of Zn/H-ZSM-5 with different Zn/Al ratios were normalized to the intensity of SiOSi framework overtone bands between 1700 and 2000 cm1. (42) The relative consumption of BAS in Zn/H-ZSM-5 samples after reduction compared to the support H-ZSM-5 was calculated using eq 1, using the pyridinium band corresponding to the peak at 1540 cm1.

where Apyr,H-ZSM-5 and Apyr,Zn/H-ZSM-5 are the integrated areas of the pyridinium bands of H-ZSM-5 and Zn/H-ZSM-5, respectively.
LAS density was determined using the mass (g) and surface area (cm2) of the sample wafer, the peak area at 1455 cm1 (assigned to coordinatively adsorbed pyridine on LAS), and an integrated molar extinction coefficient (IMEC) of 1.641 cm·μmol1. The IMEC value for LAS was determined from the IMEC for BAS density via the equation εBAS/εLAS = 0.75. (47) The IMEC for BAS density (1.231 cm·μmol1) was determined following previously reported procedures using both pyridine FTIR and isopropylamine temperature-programmed decomposition (IPA-TPD) of the H-ZSM-5 (CBV3024E, Zeolyst) sample. (48) Note that the parent H-ZSM-5 also contains a faction of LAS due to the presence of extra-framework Al species; thus, the LAS density of exchanged Zn sites was obtained by subtracting the LAS density of parent H-ZSM-5 from the LAS density of Zn/H-ZSM-5 samples.
Pulse Reactor Studies
A pulse reactor was developed to quantify the H2/O2 consumption of the samples. (35) Typically, two concurrent flows are controlled by the calibrated mass flow controller. An automatic 6-way valve (Vici) with a 0.67 mL loop and a 4-way valve was equipped to provide periodical pulses or gas flow investigated. The catalyst of 150 mg was loaded into a quartz glass tube (1/4 in. in diameter) and was heated up to 550 C at a ramp rate of 10 C·min1 in N2 flow (45 mL·min1). Another flow consists of reactant gas (10 vol % H2 or 10 vol % O2 balancing with N2) flown through the loop. Once the target temperature was achieved, the mixture in the loop was pulsed via the bypass line to reach a stable peak area before periodically introducing the pulse into the reactor tube. The instrument has a fast response, and the pulse signal is detected in less than 10 s after switching the 6-way valve. The time interval between pulses is 1 min for 10 vol % O2. The catalyst can be reduced by 10 vol % H2/N2 flow via switching the 4-way valve depending on the experiment. The feed composition and product are analyzed online by a mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer OMNI star). The quantification of gas pulses was achieved by comparing the integrated peak area of the appropriate m/z signal in the reactor effluent with that of pulses going through a bypass line. The following AMUs were used for analysis: 2 (H2), 18 (H2O), 28 (N2), and 32 (O2).
Catalytic Reaction Rate Measurements
Catalytic reaction rates were measured using a fixed bed plug flow reactor, consisting of a quartz glass tube (1/4 in. in diameter). (43) The catalyst bed typically contained 15 mg of the catalyst with a particle size range of 2040 mesh. A thermocouple was placed close to the catalyst bed to ensure accurate temperature measurement. Before the rate measurements, the catalyst was heated to 550 C for 30 min with a ramp rate of 10 C·min1 in 10 vol % H2/N2 (20 mL·min1) followed by purging with N2 at the same temperature for another 30 min. The reduced sample was then exposed to 5 vol % C3H8/N2 (total flow rate: 100 mL·min1) with the total pressure maintained at atmospheric pressure. The reactor effluent was periodically injected into an online gas chromatograph (GC) (Agilent 7890A), using a heated gas line. The GC was equipped with an RT-Q-BOND column and flame ionization detector (FID) used for product analysis. FID response factors for CH4, C2H4, C3H6, and C3H8 were calibrated before the product analysis. The conversion of C3H8 was calculated using eq 2, and the selectivity and yield of CH4, C2H4, and C3H6 were determined using eqs 3 and 4.

where i represents the propane dehydrogenation products CH4, C2H4, and C3H6 in the effluent gas, ni is the number of carbon atoms of component i, and Fi is the molar flow rate. The C3H8 conversion was measured at differential conversions (<11%). PDH rates (TOFAl) were determined from C3H6 yield, while C3H8 cracking rates were determined from the yields of CH4 and C2H4 using eq 5, where mCat, pressure, temperature, and R represent the weight of the loaded catalyst, C3H8 flow pressure, C3H8 flow temperature, and the ideal gas constant, respectively. Note that the C3H8 flow pressure and C3H8 flow temperature use 101.325 kPa and 25 C, respectively, because we calibrated the mass flow controller in ambient conditions using a soap bubble flowmeter and electronic flowmeter (Restek ProFLOW 6000 Electronic Flowmeter). Carbon balance (eq 6) in rates measurement was higher than 97%. Apparent activation energies were determined in the temperature range of 530570 C.
The dependence of reaction rates on propane partial pressure for Zn/H-ZSM-5 was determined at 550 C changing the propane flow rate (120 mL·min1) diluted with N2 flow at a constant total flow rate (100 mL·min1). The H2 rate dependence was determined by changing the H2 flow rate (220 mL·min1) with constant propane flow (5 mL·min1) and corresponding N2 flow rates with total flow rate constant (100 mL·min1). During the measurements, the reactants were switched to 5 vol % C3H8/N2 with 100 mL·min1 total flow rate every 5 h to assess the effect of catalyst deactivation.

Exchange of Zn Cations with BAS in Zn/H-ZSM-5
We selected H-ZSM-5 samples with Si/Al ratios of 15 and 39 because H-ZSM-5(Si/Al = 15) includes both paired framework Al atoms and isolated framework Al sites, while H-ZSM-5(Si/Al = 39) contains only isolated framework Al sites, as confirmed recently. (35) The compositions of Zn/H-ZSM-5(X, Y) samples (where X and Y represent the Si/Al and Zn/Al ratio, respectively) are summarized in Table S1. In situ FTIR spectroscopy was employed to investigate the speciation in Zn/H-ZSM-5, shown in Figure 1. Upon dehydration at 550 C, the FTIR spectrum of Zn/H-ZSM-5 (Figure 1a) shows three peaks at 3735, 3645, and 3591 cm1, assigned to SiOH, extra-framework AlOH, and bridged OH groups associated with BAS, respectively. (42) After reducing the sample with H2 (1 atm) at 550 C, no significant changes were observed in these three peaks, indicating that H2 treatment has hardly an effect on the exchange of Zn with BAS. Note that the OH group intensity associated with BAS decreases as Zn/Al ratio increases from 0 to 1.3 (Figure 1a, black traces), indicating that the exchange of Zn species with BAS occurs during the catalyst preparation stage, i.e., impregnation and calcination. The H2 treatment cannot reduce the ZnO species and displace BAS because there is no significant difference in the spectra collected before and after reduction (Figure 1a, black and red traces). This characteristic is different from the Ga/H-ZSM-5, in which the Ga2O3 can be reduced and exchanged with BAS during H2 treatment. (42)

The background spectrum was collected in the spectral cell without a sample pellet at room temperature under vacuum. (e) Consumption of BAS determined by quantitative pyridine FTIR spectroscopy as a function of Zn/BAS ratios on reduced Zn/H-ZSM-5(X, Y) samples. The dotted line with slopes of 1 and 2 represent that one Zn atom replaces one and two BAS, respectively. (f) Proposed Zn species evolution in Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.
Take Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, 0.31) as an example: the H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profile shows a well-defined H2 consumption peak centered at 480 C (Figure S1); a much smaller H2 consumption was observed on Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.7) compared to Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, 0.31), although the metal loading of the former is five times that of the latter. H2O measurement during the reduction of Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.7) at 550 C clearly shows that no significant quantity of H2O is formed (Figure S2) and no oxygen was consumed in subsequent oxidation, demonstrating that the predominant Zn species cannot be reduced oroxidized. This is, again, different from Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.7), which forms a large amount of H2O and consumes O2 during reduction and subsequent oxidation steps. Therefore, we concluded that Zn species are exchanged with BAS in H-ZSM-5 during the catalyst preparation and show no redox properties at 550 C, indicating that the oxidation state of the Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM-5 samples are +2. Zn species in the catalyst with high Zn loading sublimate after H2 treatment at 550 C and condense in the outlet of the reactor tube (data not shown), as observed previously. (18,36,49)
Pyridine adsorption on reduced Zn/H-ZSM-5 at 150 C can be used to establish a stoichiometry ratio between the exchanged Zn species and BAS (Figure 1c,d). On H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 15, the spectrum upon pyridine adsorption shows three peaks at 1540, 1490, and 1455 cm1, of which the two bands at 1540 and 1455 cm1 are attributed to the protonated pyridinium ion (BAS) and coordinatively adsorbed pyridine on the Lewis acid sites (LASs), respectively. The peak at 1490 cm1 is the combination of pyridine adsorbed on BAS and LAS. (42) The peak areas of 1540 and 1455 cm1 are used to calculate the density of BAS and LAS (see the detailed description in the Experimental Section). With the addition of zinc up to a Zn/Al ratio of 0.65, the pyridinium band decreases monotonically (Figure 1c,e), that is, more BAS was exchanged with Zn species. When the Zn/Al ratio increased from 0.65 to 1.3, no significant decrease in BAS was observed, revealing that BAS cannot be entirely exchanged via the impregnation method even at a high Zn/Al ratio. A similar trend is observed on H-ZSM-5(39) (Figure 1d).
The relationship between BAS consumption vs Zn/BAS ratio can be established based on Figure 1e: on H-ZSM-5(15), one Zn atom replaces two BAS at a Zn/BAS ratio below 0.09 (corresponding to Zn/Al ratio of 00.054). Considering that a divalent cation should be formed after replacing two BASs and under the constraint that one Zn replaces two BASs, Zn2+ is the only plausible model that satisfies these constraints. Upon further addition of Zn up to a Zn/BAS ratio of 1, the slope between BAS consumption vs Zn/Al ratios deviates from 2 to 1; this result indicates that a fraction of the Zn has been exchanged for BAS with a stoichiometry of 1.0, probably due to the formation of [Zn-OH]+ and [Zn-O-Zn]2+, although the formation of ZnOx clusters is not excluded at this Zn/Al range. Increasing the Zn/BAS ratio to 2.1 does not increase BAS consumption.
Considering that both isolated Zn2+ and [Zn-O-Zn]2+ species are associated with Al pairs in H-ZSM-5 with different Zn/BAS ratios, we employed the Co titration method to quantify the Al pairs density in H-ZSM-5(15). UVvis spectra of Co-H-ZSM-5 show the band at 19,000 cm1, confirming the presence of Co2+ stabilized by paired framework Al species. (35) Pyridine-FTIR results show that 40% BAS are paired to accommodate Co2+ (Figure S3a). Note that approximately 20% BAS can stabilize Zn2+ with the stoichiometry that one Zn replaces two BAS (Figure 1e). It follows that another type of Zn species is associated with Al pairs, but the stoichiometry ratio between Zn and BAS is below 2. The [Zn-O-Zn]2+ species is likely to form when Zn exchange with paired framework Al atoms since it follows the stoichiometry that one Zn atom consumes one BAS on average. Bell and coworkers (39) put forward two types of Al pairs present in H-ZSM-5: next-nearest neighbor (NNN) and next-next-nearest neighbor (NNNN). Our previous characterization of the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst (35,42,43) evidenced that the Ga2O22+ site preferentially exchanged with Al pairs at H-ZSM-5(15) and the density of Ga2O22+ site is a subset of the Al pairs titrated by the traditional Co2+ exchange method, confirming the presence of Al pairs with different proximity. We hypothesize that the Al pairs with close proximity (20% BAS) can accommodate the Zn2+, while the remaining Al pairs ( 20% BAS) can stabilize the [Zn-O-Zn]2+ species.
On H-ZSM-5(39), the stoichiometry ratio between Zn and BAS equals 1.0 when the Zn/BAS ratio is at or below 0.35. [Zn-OH]+ sites are likely the species formed at this Zn/Al range since no Al pairs were present in H-ZSM-5(39). Increasing the Zn/Al ratio leads to additional consumption of BAS with the slope between BAS consumption vs Zn/BAS ratios deviating from 1, indicating the introduction of ZnOx species. Although the detailed structure of ZnOx is unknown, the Zn species introduced at high Zn loadings are different from the Zn sites introduced at low or medium Zn loadings, namely [Zn]2+, [Zn-OH]+, or [Zn-O-Zn]2+ as discussed in detail in this report. Therefore, we infer that the Zn species formed at high Zn loading should be (ZnOx)n clusters with n  3. A similar maximum BAS (80%) density can be exchanged with Zn species on both H-ZSM-5(15) and H-ZSM-5(39), consistent with the Ga/H-ZSM-5 systems where Ga species can replace 80% of BAS even at a Ga/Al ratio of 1.7. (42)
In order to demonstrate that the case of H-ZSM-5(39) is similar to that of Zn/H-ZSM-5(15) with moderate and high Zn/Al ratios, in this range, only isolated framework Al atoms are responsible for stabilizing Zn sites. We prepared Zn/Co-H-ZSM-5 with different Zn/Al ratios and built the BAS consumption vs Zn/BAS ratio. UVvis spectra of Zn/Co-H-ZSM-5 confirm that the introduction of Zn into Co/H-ZSM-5 does not change the Co species significantly at low Zn/Al ratios. A high Zn loading led to the increase of background due to the introduction of crystalline ZnO, which will be discussed later. As shown in Figure S3b,c, Zn species further replace BAS (1540 cm1) in Co/H-ZSM-5 and form additional LAS (1455 cm1). In the low range of Zn/Al ratios, one Zn roughly replaces one BAS, and the slope between BAS consumption vs Zn/Al ratio deviates from 1, indicating the formation of ZnOx clusters. These results are consistent with the case of Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, Y), confirming that after the formation of Zn2+ in H-ZSM-5(15), there is a stage that one Zn replaces one BAS before the formation of ZnOx clusters. Note that the same exchange stoichiometry ratio between BAS vs Zn/Al ratios for both [Zn-OH]+ and [Zn-O-Zn]2+ species makes it indistinguishable in pyridine-FTIR tests, although they are demonstrated to exist in H-ZSM-5(15) by the above control experiments. The detailed difference between [Zn-OH]+ and [Zn-O-Zn]2+ sites will be discussed below.
It follows that on H-ZSM-5(15) (the sample containing a fraction of paired framework Al atoms), Zn species exchanged with BAS pairs lead to the formation of Zn2+ sites (Figure 1f), additional Zn leads to the formation of [Zn-O-Zn]2+ and then [Zn-OH]+ species, and a further increase of Zn lead to the formation of ZnOx clusters in the zeolites. On H-ZSM-5(39) without paired framework Al atoms, [Zn-OH]+ species are formed at low Zn/Al ratios, and ZnOx clusters present at a high Zn/Al ratio. In other words, Al pairs can accommodate Zn2+ and [Zn-O-Zn]2+ sites, while isolated framework Al sites can stabilize [Zn-OH]+ species. XPS spectra (Figure S4) of Zn/Al2O3 and Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, Y) shows Zn 2p3/2 peak at 1021.5 and 1023.5 eV, assigned to Zn2+ in ZnO and Zn-OH, respectively, (50,51) confirming the assignment of [Zn-OH]+ species in Zn/H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 39. This result is also consistent with the recently reported results by Fu et al. (52) showing that Zn2+ was preferentially exchanged with BAS pairs in H-CHA (Si/Al = 7) to form isolated Zn2+ sites followed by the introduction of the [Zn-OH]+ species.
Pyridine adsorption on the reduced Zn/H-ZSM-5 also provides evidence of the formation of LAS. On Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, Y), the band corresponding to pyridine adsorbed on the LAS (1455 cm1) increases in intensity with an increasing Zn/Al ratio up to 0.45 (Figure 1e and Figure S5). This is attributed to pyridine adsorbed on the exchanged Zn species (Zn2+, [Zn-OH]+, or [Zn-O-Zn]2+). A further increase in Zn/Al ratio does not increase the intensity of LAS; however, the bandwidth at 1455 cm1 increases slightly, possibly due to the presence of ZnOx clusters in the zeolite (Figure S5b,c). On Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, Y), LAS intensity increases as the Zn/Al ratio increases to 1.1 and remains nearly unchanged as Zn/Al ratios rise to 1.7. The movement of Zn species into the zeolite micropores is consistent with the reduction in micropore volume (1020%) on Zn/H-ZSM-5(X, Y) compared to H-ZSM-5(X) (Figure S6). On a Si/Al ratio of 39, the surface area of Zn/H-ZSM-5 decreased slightly compared with the parent H-ZSM-5 (Figure S7a). Similar observations are made on Si/Al ratios of 15 and Zn/Al ratios at or below 0.45. However, the surface area of Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts decreased significantly at Zn/Al ratios above 0.45. This is likely because the introduction of ZnOx clusters decreases the surface area, consistent with the observation of pyridine-FTIR results. The LAS density normalized by catalyst surface area (Figure S7b) showed similarity to the LAS density normalized by the catalyst mass, except for the case of Zn/H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 15 and Zn/Al ratios higher than 0.63. This is because the surface area of the Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalyst decreased slightly at low Zn loading, while it was significantly reduced at high Zn loading by introducing ZnOx clusters.
The UVvis spectra of the Zn/H-ZSM-5(X, Y) catalyst show an increasing absorption at 230 nm (Figure S8) with Zn content, and this band is assigned to the charge transfer transitions from O2 in the zeolite framework to exchanged Zn cations. (36) At a high Zn loading such as Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.7), the bands intensity at 368 nm increases due to the formation of crystalline ZnO on the external surface, as evidenced by the ZnO diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns of these samples (Figure S9). (46,53) Control experiments were conducted to prepare Zn/H-ZSM-5 via the IE method to achieve a Zn/Al ratio of 0.2 on H-ZSM-5(15) and Zn/Al ratio of 0.32 on H-ZSM-5(39), which also shows UVvis absorption at 230 nm and a lack of the crystalline ZnO features (Figure S8).

Zinc Hydride Formation in Zn/H-ZSM-5
Metal-hydride formation in zeolites is important to understand metal speciation and reaction mechanism for alkane dehydrogenation because metal hydride may serve as the active site or participate in the reaction as a reaction intermediate. (31,32,35,3739,42,43,54) Kazansky et al. (55,56) used diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to investigate Zn/H-ZSM-5(25, 0.45) and determined that zinc cations can dissociate ethane to form acidic protons and Zn ethyl fragments, which then dissociated to Zn hydride (1934 cm1) and ethylene upon heating at 250 C. The formed Zn hydride decomposed after heating above 300 C. However, it was not possible to conclude which Zn species form Zn hydride since a single Zn/H-ZSM-5 sample possibly contains multiple types of exchanged Zn species, as discussed above. Below, we use in situ FTIR spectroscopy to monitor the formation of Zn hydride species at 550 C (typical reaction temperature) on reduced Zn/H-ZSM-5(X, Y) samples.
Upon reducing the Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 0.63) with H2 (1 atm) at 550 C, a band at 1926 cm1 (ZnHx) is observed in the presence of H2 and disappears under vacuum at the same temperature (Figure 2b(i)). Similar observations are made when the temperature decreased to 450 and 350 C. As the temperature is reduced to 250 C, ZnHx species are retained even after evacuation (Figure 2b(iv)); that is, the ZnH bond is stable at this low temperature, consistent with Kazansky et al.s observations. (55,56) The effect of temperature on the Zn hydride stability underscores that investigations of metal hydride at a low temperature may not be representative of its properties at a higher temperature. This is similar to the Ga-CHA catalyst, i.e., GaHx is formed at a low temperature and decomposes at a high temperature. (54) Interestingly, the spectra in the OH region did not change significantly with or without H2 (Figure 2a). It was also reported (57) that Zn2+ can dissociate H2 to form [ZnH]+ and BAS, which is reflected in the regeneration of the -OH group associated with BAS (3610 cm1) during the formation of the Zn hydride peak. This inconsistency suggests a different mechanism for zinc hydride formation (see below).
Figure 2
Figure 2. FTIR spectra of the reduced Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 0.63) at different temperatures from 550 to 250 C in (a) high and (b) low wavenumber ranges. Red and black traces represent spectra in the presence of H2 (1 atm) and under vacuum at the corresponding temperature, respectively. The background spectrum was collected in the spectral cell with a reduced sample pellet at the corresponding temperature under vacuum.
H-D exchange experiments provide additional information about the properties of Zn hydrides. For Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 0.63) in the presence of H2 (1atm) at 550 C, the formation of Zn hydride (1926 cm1) is clear. Then, D2 (1atm) was introduced into the cell after H2 was evacuated, and H-D exchange occurred in OH groups including the SiOH, extra-framework AlOH, and bridged OH groups associated with BAS (Figure 3(ii)). Meanwhile, the Zn hydride peak nearly disappears although an increased background was observed (Figure 3b(ii)). A well-defined peak was observed when subtracting the spectrum collected in the presence of H2 from the spectrum collected in the presence of D2 (Figure 3(iii)), confirming that ZnHx formed in the presence of H2 was converted to ZnDx in the presence of D2. The lack of the ZnDx band on the subtracted spectrum in the region of 13001450 cm1 might result from the different extinction coefficients of ZnDx. Control experiments were performed by conducting an H-D exchange at 250 C (a higher ZnHx intensity was observed, in Figure S10). A clear peak at 1390 cm1 shows up when introducing D2 on the reduced sample at 250 C, assigned to the formation of Zn-D species considering that the wavenumber ratio between 1930 and 1390 cm1 is 1.39. Re-introduction of H2 into the D2-treated sample regenerates the -OH group and Zn hydride (Figure 3(iv)), further demonstrating the exchange between H and D species in the presence of H2 (or D2).

The background spectrum is collected in the spectral cell with a dehydrated sample pellet at 550 C under vacuum.
A non-negligible background appears when collecting the spectrum of Zn/H-ZSM-5 in the presence of H2 (Figure 3b(i) and Figure S11), which makes it difficult to quantify the relative intensity of Zn hydride. Notably, in the H-D exchange experiment for Zn/H-ZSM-5, the difference spectrum (H2 treated-spectrum subtracted from D2 treated-spectrum, like Figure 3b(iii)) shows a well-defined peak to represent the Zn hydride and can be used for the quantification. Figure 4 shows the difference spectrum of all Zn-H-ZSM-5(X, Y) catalysts, and the specific H2-treated and D2-treated spectra are shown in Figures S12S23. On H-ZSM-5(15), no Zn hydride is observed at Zn/Al ratios of 0.054 and 0.13. Zn hydride starts to appear as the Zn/Al ratio rises to 0.24 and becomes prominent when the Zn/Al ratio exceeds 0.45 (Figure 4a,c). This result clearly shows that not all Zn species on Zn/H-ZSM-5 can form Zn hydride. Combined with the pyridine-FTIR results discussed in Figure 1, the lack of Zn hydride species on Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 0.054) demonstrates that isolated Zn2+ cannot dissociate H2 to form stable Zn hydride. The prominent Zn hydride intensity at a high Zn/Al ratio suggests that Zn sites introduced at this range can dissociate H2, most likely in the form of ZnOx clusters in the zeolites (Figure 1f). On H-ZSM-5(39), Zn hydride starts to appear at Zn/Al ratio up to 0.37 and increases rapidly as Zn/Al rises (Figure 4c). Similarly, the lack of Zn hydride at a Zn/Al ratio below 0.37 shows in this case that [Zn-OH]+ is not the species that dissociate H2. The absence of ZnHx on Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, 0.14) at 250 C further confirms that [Zn-OH]+ cannot form hydride even at a lower temperature (data not shown). The appearance of Zn hydride at a high Zn/Al ratio also indicated that the ZnOx clusters in the zeolite is the species to form Zn hydride, consistent with the observation on H-ZSM-5(15). The ZnHx intensity stops increasing at an even higher Zn/Al ratio, showing that bulk ZnO (or external ZnOx) cannot form Zn hydrides at 550 C. For example, on H-ZSM-5(15), the Zn hydride increased only slightly as the Zn/Al ratio increased from 0.63 to 1.3, while on H-ZSM-5(39), the Zn hydride decreased slightly as the Zn/Al ratio increased from 1.1 to 1.7. These observations are inconsistent with Odas conclusion that isolated Zn2+ reacted with H2 to form [ZnH]+ and BAS and [ZnH]+ subsequently converted to Zn0 and BAS. (57) However, the presence of other Zn species such as [ZnOH]+ and ZnOx clusters has not been excluded in the investigated sample. Another possible reason is the difference in the temperature collected spectrum for hydride (27 C in the literature (57) vs 550 C in this work).

(f) Proposed Zn hydride formation on Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.
Examination of ZnHx vs Zn/Al and Si/Al ratios leads to the conclusion that Zn species introduced at low Zn/Al ratios, i.e., Zn2+, [Zn-O-Zn]2+, and [ZnOH]+, do not form stable Zn-H at 550 C, while ZnOx clusters in the zeolite can dissociate H2 to form hydrides at 550 C. No zinc hydride was detected on ZnO, Zn/SiO2, and Zn/Al2O3 (Figure S24), excluding the possibility that bulk ZnO particles dissociate H2 to form hydride. The dissociation of H2 on ZnOx clusters in the zeolite can be rationalized as the heterolytic H2 dissociation on the ZnO bond to form [Zn(II)-H][O-H] species. This process is reversible since Zn hydride disappears when H2 is removed at 550 C (Figure 2). Note that the dissociation of H2 on ZnOx clusters does not involve the regeneration of BAS, consistent with the results in Figure 2 that there is no significant increase of the BAS OH group (3591 cm1) after H2 treatment on Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 0.65). Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 0.2)-IE and Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, 0.32)-IE prepared via the IE method showed a small ZnHx peak when introducing H2 (Figures S25 and S26), suggesting that the IE method also introduced a minor fraction of ZnOx cluster in H-ZSM-5. (18)
Propane Dehydrogenation over Zn/H-ZSM-5
Zn/H-ZSM-5 were reduced with 10 vol % H2/N2 at 550 C for 30 min and then exposed to 5 vol % C3H8/N2 to measure the PDH rates and C3H6 selectivity. PDH rates were measured in the kinetic regime, which is evidenced by the linear correlation between the propane conversion and product yields (C3H6, C2H4, and CH4) and the catalyst loading at 550 C (Figure S27). The examination of the effect of particle size (0.18 mm to 0.84 mm) shows that particle size in this range has no effect on catalytic rates (Figure S28a). No significant change for the test with and without SiO2 dilution ensures the isothermal reaction conditions during the rate measurements (Figure S28b). As shown in Figure 5, on H-ZSM-5(15), a stable PDH rate was observed with a C3H6 selectivity of 40%. After adding a small amount of Zn (Zn/Al = 0.054), a minor improvement in initial PDH rates and C3H6 selectivity was observed (Figure 5a and Figure S29). As the Zn/Al ratio increases to 0.13, the PDH rate is greatly enhanced while C3H6 selectivity increased to 75%, indicating that the introduced Zn species in the Zn/Al range of 0.0540.13 are more active than that in the range of 00.054 (Figure 5c). Further increasing the Zn/Al ratio to 0.45 could enhance the PDH rate and C3H6 selectivity, while the catalyst deactivates over time on stream (TOS). No significant improvement was observed when the Zn/Al ratio exceeded 0.45 (Figure 5a,c), showing that the additional Zn species are not active for propane dehydrogenation. Note that the above characterization results demonstrated that reduction at 550 C for 30 min does not affect the Zn species significantly. The control experiment of measuring the Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) with or without reduction also showed a similar C3H6 yield (Figure S30), indicating that the reduction process is not necessary for measuring the reaction rates of Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

(c) Initial TOFAl vs Zn/Al ratio on H-ZSM-5(X, Y) and (d) zoomed-in view of low Zn/Al ratios (boxed region in (c)).

Reaction conditions: 15 mg; 550 C; 5.07 kPa C3H8 with balancing N2. The propane conversions are below 11% in the rate measurements. (f) Proposed active site in Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.
Combined with the results of Figures 1 and 4, it follows that the isolated Zn2+ site, formed at low Zn/Al ratios, is less active than the [Zn-O-Zn]2+ and [Zn-OH]+ site, formed in the medium Zn/Al ratios (Figure 1e), and high Zn loading leads to the formation of ZnOx, which is the least active for PDH. On H-ZSM-5(39), in Figure 5b,c, the PDH rate increases monotonically with Zn loading up to a Zn/Al ratio of 0.37, increases slowly when the Zn/Al ratio rises to 1.1, and remains almost unchanged with a further increase of Zn/Al ratio to 1.7. Meanwhile, the C3H6 selectivity rises from 49% on H-ZSM-5(39) to 86% on Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, 1.1). The low Zn/Al range of Figure 5c is replotted in Figure 5d. The slope of the TOFAl vs Zn/Al ratios (the slope represents the TOF of the introduced Zn species) (43) was estimated as 0.060  0.008 and 0.053  0.013 molC3H8·molZn1·s1 for Si/Al ratios of 15 and 39 and the Zn/Al ratio range of 0.0540.24 and 00.37, respectively. The similar TOFZn over different Si/Al ratios corroborates that the Zn species with a similar PDH rate is introduced in H-ZSM-5 zeolite within the selected Zn/Al region regardless of the Si/Al ratio. It should be [Zn-O-Zn]2+ and [Zn-OH]+ sites based on our analysis of the Zn speciation.
Note that the catalytic results of Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) are generally consistent with those of Bell and coworkers in that Zn species with the lower catalytic rate were introduced at low Zn/Al ratios and more active Zn species are formed at higher Zn/Al ratios. (36) Bell and coworkers interpreted the observation as Zn2+ located in different Al positions: Al pairs at different distances (NNN and NNNN) or different rings (α, β, and γ sites). Stable Zn2+ associated with NNN atoms or α-sites in MFI is formed at a low Zn loading, leading to a higher energy barrier for alkane activation. (58) However, Zn2+ sites located at distant Al atom pairs or β-sites in MFI zeolite, formed at a high Zn loading, exhibited decreased stability and increased catalytic rate. Note that although extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (EXAFS) of Zn/H-ZSM-5 only show ZnO backscattering without ZnOZn linkages (exhibits in bulk ZnO), a recent report by Tu et al. (59) showed that EXAFS results could not differentiate between the mono Zn2+ and binuclear [Zn-O-Zn]2+ type of isolated Zn cations since the scattering from the ZnOZn bond in [Zn-O-Zn]2+ was too weak to be extracted by EXAFS analysis. Our characterizations (Figure 1) and rate measurement (Figure 5) results of Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) suggest that the distance of Al pairs is more likely to lead to the formation of different Zn species, that is, Zn2+ with NNN Al pairs is formed at low Zn loading and [Zn-O-Zn]2+ species with NNNN Al pairs are formed at high Zn loadings.
We selected Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 0.054) and Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, 0.24) samples to compare the intrinsic reaction rate and C3H6 selectivity of Zn2+ and [Zn-OH]+. Based on our previous results, Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 0.054) contains isolated Zn2+ and remaining BAS, while Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, 0.24) is a mixture of [Zn-OH]+ and BAS. Thus, the TOFAl can be decoupled by the contribution from remnant BAS and Zn species, as shown in eqs 79:

where x1 and x2 represent the fraction of BAS and Zn species to the Al content of each sample, respectively. TOF1C3, TOF1C2, and TOF1C1 represent the BAS-catalyzed propane conversion rate to C3H6, C2H4, and CH4, respectively. TOF2C3, TOF2C2, and TOF2C1 represent the Zn species-catalyzed propane conversion rate to C3H6, C2H4, and CH4, respectively. After subtracting the contribution of BAS to the reaction rate, we obtain the intrinsic Zn species (Zn2+ and [Zn-OH]+) catalytic rates (Tables S2 and S3). The PDH rates on [Zn-OH]+ sites are 2.4 times higher than that on Zn2+ sites. The C3H6 selectivity of [Zn-OH]+ is 90.5%, which is higher than the C3H6 selectivity (57.9%) achieved by isolated Zn2+ sites (Table S3): that is, [Zn-OH]+ shows superior activity and C3H6 selectivity to Zn2+ sites.
Using the methodology described above to obtain TOFZn by subtracting the contribution of remaining BAS to the PDH rates, we calculated TOFZn values vs Zn loading, as shown in Figure S31. It shows that on a Si/Al ratio of 39, a similar TOFZn was observed at a Zn loading below 2% (corresponding to a Zn/Al ratio of 0.72), indicating that the same Zn site was introduced in this range. The previous characterization results indicated that this was the introduction of [Zn-OH]+ species. A higher Zn loading resulted in a decrease in TOFZn due to the introduction of another less active Zn species (ZnOx), which leads to a drop in average TOFZn. A different trend was observed on the sample with Si/Al ratio of 15: a lower TOFZn was observed at a low Zn loading (0.34%, corresponding to a Zn/Al ratio of 0.054). As the Zn loading increased to 1.45%, the TOFZn increased significantly, suggesting that another Zn site with a higher PDH rate was introduced, and increasing the average turnover frequency of Zn species. Combined with the characterization results, they should be [Zn-O-Zn]2+ and [Zn-OH]+ species. Higher Zn loading (above 2.94%) leads to a drop of the TOFZn due to the introduction of ZnOx in the same way as in the case of the sample with Si/Al ratio of 39. These transition points of TOFZn hint at the introduction of different Zn species, which is consistent with the turning point of the trend of TOFAl vs Zn/Al ratio (Figure 5c,d). This demonstrates that the same conclusions are reached using two different analysis methods.
The PDH rates of Zn/Al2O3 and Zn/SiO2 were negligible compared with H-ZSM-5 and Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts (Figure S32), ruling out the contribution of un-exchanged Zn species to the PDH rates. Note that the PDH rate decreases monotonically at a high Zn/Al ratio on both Si/Al ratios of 15 and 39, indicating that [Zn-OH]+ is unstable under a reducing environment (propane atmosphere). It has been shown that Zn species sublimate during the propane dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in Zn loss and catalyst deactivation. (36,49) Our results indicate that the reduction of [Zn-OH]+ to Zn0 during the propane dehydrogenation test might be the reason for deactivation. The Zn loading measurements of Zn/H-ZSM-5 (Tables S4 and S5) show that Zn sublimates after PDH reaction or high-temperature reduction treatment. The stability of different Zn species is discussed below.
Paired Framework Al Atoms to Stabilize Multinuclear Oxygenated Metal Clusters
We treated the Zn/H-ZSM-5 under 10 vol % H2/N2 at 750 C for 60 min to intentionally remove the sublimed species (mostly ZnOH species). Taking Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) as an example (Figure 6a), after 6 h of propane dehydrogenation TOS, the reactant was switched to 10 vol % H2/N2 flow with heating to 750 C for 60 min and then cooled to 550 C before exposing to 5 vol % C3H8/N2 at 550 C. The PDH rate decreased significantly to a stable value, with C3H6 selectivity decreasing slightly from 85% to 80%. Note that the PDH rate and C3H6 selectivity are still much higher than that of the parent H-ZSM-5. Thus, some active Zn species are retained after the high-temperature reductive treatment.

Reaction conditions: 15 mg; 550 C; 5.07 kPa C3H8 with balancing N2. After several hours of testing, the catalyst was treated with 10 vol % H2/N2 flow at 750 C for 60 min. (d) Specific PDH rates (propylene production rate per gram of catalyst) and SCo2+ (peak area of Co2+ per gram of catalyst) between Si/Al ratios of 15 and 28. The original UVvis spectrum showing the presence of Co2+ was discussed in our previous report. (35)
The Zn/Al ratio of Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) treated with 10 vol % H2/N2 flow at 750 C for 60 min was 0.29 by XRF spectroscopy. Pyridine-FTIR results (Figure S33) show that a fraction of the BAS was regenerated and the LAS density was reduced upon this reductive treatment, confirming the reduction/sublimation of exchanged Zn species. Similar observations are made on Zn/H-ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratios of 28 and 39 where significant activity was lost upon treatment by 10 vol % H2/N2 flow at 750 C (Figure 6b,c and Figures S34S36). Importantly, both the specific PDH rate and C3H6 selectivity of Zn/H-ZSM-5 upon high-temperature reductive treatment decrease as Si/Al ratio rises, indicating that more Zn species are retained as the Al content increases. Similar experiments conducted on Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) show that the PDH rates and C3H6 selectivity increase with Zn/Al ratios (Figure S34). The PDH rates and C3H6 selectivity on Zn/H-ZSM-5(28, 1.3) are higher than parent H-ZSM-5(28) (Figure S35). However, for Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, 1.1) after high temperature reductive, the PDH rate and C3H6 selectivity are close to the parent H-ZSM-5(39), in agreement with the pyridine-FTIR analysis (Figure S33b), showing that BAS was largely restored, and LAS substantially reduced. A similar trend is observed on Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, 0.72) (Figure S35), suggesting that all active Zn species on Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, Y) are lost upon high-temperature reduction treatment. The Zn loading measurement of Zn/H-ZSM-5(X, Y) further supports the Zn sublimation upon 750 C reduction (Tables S4 and S5). On the Si/Al ratio of 15, we found no Zn sublimation at low Zn loading, and Zn appears to sublimate at high Zn loading. On the Si/Al ratio of 39, almost all Zn was sublimated after 750 C reduction. This indicates that the Zn species associated with Al pairs (Zn2+ and [Zn-O-Zn]2+) are stable in high-temperature reductive environments, while Zn associated with isolated Al atoms ([Zn-OH]+ and ZnOx clusters) are less stable. Note that the XRD pattern of Zn/H-ZSM-5 after high-temperature treatment (Figure S37a) retains the MFI crystal structure, indicating structural stability even after treatment at 750 C.
The specific reaction rate in Zn/H-ZSM-5 after high-temperature reductive treatment was correlated with the density of Co2+ associated with the Al pairs determined by the UVvis spectroscopy of Co-ZSM-5 in our previous report. (35) This further demonstrates that the stable Zn species are associated with Al pairs (possibly the mixture of Zn2+ and [Zn-O-Zn]2+). [Zn-O-Zn]2+ sites should contribute to the high C3H6 selectivity because the C3H6 selectivity of isolated Zn2+ is low (57.9%). The BAS and LAS density of Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) after high-temperature reduction treatment (Figure S33) were determined to be 309 and 305 μmol/g, respectively. The H-ZSM-5(15) after high-temperature reduction treatment included extra-framework Al sites, which were estimated to be 125 μmol/g. Thus, on the sample Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) after high-temperature reduction treatment, the BAS and catalytic Zn species densities were 309 and 180 μmol/g. The dehydrogenation rate and C3H6 selectivity of Zn were estimated to be 0.039 molC3H8·molsite1·s1 and 90.9% using eqs 79 with the assumption that one active site adsorbs one pyridine. Notably, the exchanged Zn species contain both [Zn]2+ and [Zn-O-Zn]2+ sites. The [Zn]2+ and [Zn-O-Zn]2+ sites are assumed to be equally distributed, which is reasonable based on the above analysis of Al pair distribution of NNN and NNNN in H-ZSM-5(15). Then, the intrinsic reaction rate of [Zn-O-Zn]2+ site is calculated to be 0.057 molC3H8·molsite1·s1, which is similar to the rate of [Zn-OH]+ sites determined before. Overall, the catalytic PDH performance of [Zn-O-Zn]2+ site is close to [Zn-OH]+ sites, and both show better reaction rates and C3H6 selectivity than [Zn]2+ sites.
To confirm that the [Zn-O-Zn]2+ structure is more stable than the [Zn-OH]+ species, we increased the catalyst loading of Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) by a factor of 4 after high-temperature reduction treatment to achieve comparable conversion with that of Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) (Figure 7), considering that 75% Zn is removed upon high-temperature reduction treatment (Table S5). The result shows that the Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) after 750 C reduction does not deactivate significantly within 20 h on stream, while the C3H6 yield of Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) deactivated from 9.6% to 2.1% after 20 h on stream. The two spent catalysts were regenerated, and we performed the reaction again. As shown in Figure S38, for Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) upon regeneration, the reaction rate could not recover back to the initial reaction rate. For Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) after 750 C reduction, the C3H6 yield stays almost unchanged after two times regeneration. Therefore, we concluded that Zn loss is the main deactivation cause of Zn/H-ZSM-5 under the conditions investigated.

Reaction conditions: 15 mg for Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) 550 C reduced and 60 mg for Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) 750 C reduced; 550 C; 5.07 kPa C3H8 with balancing N2.
Characterizations of the spent catalysts were performed, including XRD, pyridine-FTIR, TGA, and XRF. After 10 h of propane dehydrogenation, the XRD patterns of the spent catalysts (Figure S37b) retain the crystal structure of MFI zeolite, confirming the structural stability of Zn-containing MFI catalysts during the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The TGA profiles of the spent catalysts (Figure S39) show a weight loss at the temperatures below 300 C, attributed to the desorption of water. Only a slight weight loss (<2%) was observed as the temperature increased to 750 C, indicating that the amount of coke formed is small under the reaction conditions investigated. This is because we tested the catalysts at a low propane conversion (<11%) to ensure obtaining the intrinsic reaction rate. Pyridine-FTIR results of the spent catalyst (Figure S40) showed that there was no significant change for the samples before and after the reaction: H-ZSM-5(15), Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 0.054), and Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) with 750 C reduction. That is, the Zn species remains unchanged during the propane dehydrogenation, suggesting that the characterization of the reduced Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is representative of the Zn sites for propane dehydrogenation. However, the LAS density of Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, 0.24) decreased significantly after the reaction. This is due to the instability of [Zn-OH]+ sites and the loss of Zn during the reaction. The pyridine-FTIR results of the spent catalysts are consistent with the XRF measurement (Table S6), i.e., no Zn loss was observed on Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 0.054) and Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) after 750 C reduction samples; and approximately half of the Zn was lost for Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) and Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, 0.24) catalysts. This confirms that the Zn species associated with Al pairs (Zn2+ and [Zn-O-Zn]2+) are stable after the propane dehydrogenation reaction, while [ZnOH]+ are prone to sublimation.
Combined with the TGA results, we conclude that the deactivation of Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is mainly due to the Zn loss rather than the coke formation. The characterization of the spent catalysts further supports the conclusion that isolated Zn2+ and [Zn-O-Zn]2+ are stable under reductive conditions, while [Zn-OH]+ is more prone to sublimation and leads to catalyst deactivation.
We also conducted the H-D exchange experiments on the Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) with 750 C reduction, and no Zn hydride was observed at both 550 and 250 C (Figures S41 and S42), consistent with the above observation that the [Zn-O-Zn]2+ structure cannot dissociate H2 to form Zn hydride.
Propane Dehydrogenation Mechanism on Zn/H-ZSM-5 Catalysts
Based on the above results and discussion, we proposed a propane dehydrogenation mechanism on different Zn sites (Scheme 1): For isolated Zn2+ sites, propane is first heterolytically dissociated to form [Zn(II)-C3H7] species and a BAS. This step is followed by the H-beta elimination to form a [H-Zn(II)-C3H6] intermediate and is closed by the desorption of C3H6 and H2 formed via proton transfer. For [Zn-O-Zn]2+ sites, the propane is initially dissociated heterotically on the ZnO bond to form [Zn(II)-C3H7]-[OH] species, which is followed by the H-beta elimination to form [H-Zn(II)-C3H6]-[OH] intermediate and also closed by the desorption of C3H6 and H2. It is proposed that [Zn-OH]+ activated propane to form [Zn(II)-C3H7]-[OH]···H+, which is followed by H-beta elimination to form [H-Zn(II)-C3H6]-[OH]···H+. The cycle is closed by the desorption of C3H6 and H2.

In relative terms, the ZnO bond (in [Zn-O-Zn]2+ and [Zn-OH]+) shows a stronger propane activation ability and better stabilization of the transition state than isolated Zn2+, resulting in a higher PDH rate. Meanwhile, the regeneration of BAS during the propane activation on isolated Zn2+ sites may lead to the attack of a CC bond (propane cracking) and a decrease of C3H6 selectivity (to 58%). For both [Zn-O-Zn]2+ and [Zn-OH]+ sites, a similar PDH mechanism was proposed due to the presence of a ZnO bond; however, the intermediate of [H-Zn(II)-C3H6]-[OH]···H+ associated with [Zn-OH]+ sites may be unstable and can sublimate during the reaction, leading to the loss of the active site. The BAS regeneration of Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, 1.1) upon high-temperature reduction was confirmed by the pyridine FTIR results (Figure S33b).
Additional kinetic experiments have been conducted to support the proposed mechanism. We measured the propane and H2 reaction order on three representative samples: Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 0.054), Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 1.3) with 750 C reduction, and Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, 0.24), which represents three different active sites: Zn2+, [Zn-O-Zn]2+, and [Zn-OH]+, respectively. The results show that three sites exhibit a propane reaction order of 1, and a H2 reaction order of 0 (Figure S43). These results indicate that propane activation (the first step in Scheme 1) is the rate-determining step, and the H2 desorption is fast. The close to zero reaction order of H2 is consistent with the absence of Zn hydride on the three sites (as determined by in situ FTIR spectroscopy discussed above), confirming that the interaction of Zn sites and H2 is weak.
In situ DRIFTS experiments were performed on Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with different Zn species, as shown in Figure S44. The results showed that in the presence of propane, there was a slight consumption of BAS, and BAS was recovered when the propane was purged with an inert gas. BAS can catalyze propane dehydrogenation by a carbenium mechanism, that is, propane is activated by BAS to form carbenium ion and then propylene is desorbed to recover BAS. Interestingly, no Zn hydride was observed (Figure S44c) in the presence of propane, suggesting that Zn hydride is not the stable active center. The Zn hydride is more likely a reaction intermediate, that is, it is formed during the reaction but decomposes rapidly to desorb H2 and close the catalytic cycle.
The reaction rate equation was derived based on the assumption that the first step (propane adsorption and activation) is the rate-determining step, and the subsequent steps are fast; see eq 10. (36)

where k1, KC3H8, and PC3H8 represent the intrinsic rate coefficient (molC3H8·molZn1·s1) for propane dehydrogenation, propane adsorption equilibrium constant, and propane partial pressure, respectively. k1·KC3H8 represents the apparent rate coefficient (molC3H8·molZn1·s1·bar1).The fitted results from eq 10 match the experimental results for three different catalysts (Figure 8, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 1). It shows that [Zn-O-Zn]2+ shows a similar reaction rate to [Zn-OH]+, and both show higher catalytic rates than Zn2+. The apparent activation energy of three distinct sites further confirms that slightly different apparent activation energies were observed between [Zn-O-Zn]2+ and [Zn-OH]+, which are less than the apparent activation energy of [Zn]2+. Based on the previous discussion, although both [Zn-O-Zn]2+ and [Zn-OH]+ sites show high activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation, our results highlight that [Zn-O-Zn]2+ sites are more stable in a high-temperature reductive environment than in isolated [Zn-OH]+ sites.

Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Zn speciation has been investigated on Zn/H-ZSM-5 with different Si/Al ratios (15 and 39) and Zn/Al ratios (01.7). Unlike Ga species, ZnOx cannot be reduced and displace BAS during the reduction treatment at 550 C. The exchange of Zn and BAS occurs at the impregnation and calcination stages. The relationship between the consumption of BAS vs Zn/Al ratio was established to demonstrate the following: on a Si/Al ratio of 15, isolated Zn2+ forms initially followed by the formation of [Zn-O-Zn]2+ and [ZnOH]+, and then the ZnOx cluster in the zeolite pores, and crystalline ZnO in sequence as the Zn/Al ratio rises. On a sample with a Si/Al ratio of 39, [ZnOH]+ species are formed at low and medium Zn/Al ratios, and ZnOx clusters and crystalline ZnO species are observed at high Zn/Al ratios. The exchanged Zn species (isolated Zn2+, [Zn-O-Zn]2+, and [ZnOH]+ species) do not form Zn hydride at 550 C in the presence of H2, while the ZnOx cluster in the micropore of H-ZSM-5 can dissociate H2 at high temperature to form hydrides. The [Zn-OH]+ and [Zn-O-Zn]2+ sites in H-ZSM-5 exhibited a similar propane dehydrogenation rate and C3H6 selectivity, and both are superior to isolated Zn2+. Three distinct Zn sites (([Zn-O-Zn]2+, Zn2+, and [ZnOH]+) show similar propane reaction order (close to 1) and H2 reaction order (close to 0). Combined with the lack of Zn hydride formation when propane flows over the catalyst at 550 C, it is concluded that propane adsorption and dissociation is a rate-determining step and H2 desorption is fast. Although [Zn-OH]+ sites deactivated over TOS mainly due to their sublimation in the reductive reaction environment, [Zn-O-Zn]2+ associated with paired framework Al atoms is a stable configuration even after high-temperature reduction (750 C for 60 min). These results indicate that the preparation of H-ZSM-5 with a high concentration of paired framework Al atoms is a plausible strategy to stable and selective Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The investigation approach in the present work could be extended to other related metalzeolite systems.
