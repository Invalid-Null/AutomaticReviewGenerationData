1. The chemical industry values propylene as a precursor for the production of polypropylene, acrylic acid, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile. 

2. Catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the activation energy barrier for the chemical reaction. The article describes how metal cations exchanged into the framework of zeolites can serve as active sites that stabilize reaction intermediates.

3. The article introduces metal oxide catalysts, supported metal catalysts, alloy catalysts, and metal-exchanged zeolite catalysts as options for propane dehydrogenation. Specific examples given are Pt-Sn, CrOx/Al2O3, Ga/H-ZSM-5, Zn/H-ZSM-5, Co/H-ZSM-5.
