[1] Incremental additions of zinc show that Zn2+ sites are preferentially formed on H-ZSM-5 over a fraction of paired Al sites followed by [Zn-O-Zn]2+ and [ZnOH]+ sites and then ZnOx clusters. The [Zn-OH]+ and [Zn-O-Zn]2+ sites in H-ZSM-5 are more active and selective than isolated Zn2+ for PDH. [Zn-OH]+ species sublimate over time on stream, leading to catalyst deactivation, while [Zn-O-Zn]2+ species are stable even after high-temperature reduction (750 C for 60 min).

[1] Zn/H-ZSM-5 samples with Si/Al ratios of 15 and 39 were prepared via ion exchange and impregnation. The relationship between BAS consumption and Zn/Al ratio was used to determine the stoichiometry of Zn species formed. 

[2] At low Zn loadings, Zn2+ sites preferentially exchanged at paired Al sites in H-ZSM-5(15). At higher loadings, [Zn-O-Zn]2+ and [Zn-OH]+ sites formed before ZnOx clusters.

[3] On H-ZSM-5(39) without Al pairs, [Zn-OH]+ sites formed initially, before ZnOx clusters at higher loadings.

[4] In situ IR spectroscopy was used to show Zn/H-ZSM-5 with ZnOx clusters formed Zn hydride species upon H2 treatment at 550°C. Isolated Zn2+, [Zn-O-Zn]2+, and [Zn-OH]+ sites did not.

[1] The preparation method of Zn/H-ZSM-5 samples via ion exchange is described: "Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 0.2)-IE and Zn/H-ZSM-5(39, 0.32)-IE samples were prepared by ion exchange of H-ZSM-5 with zinc nitrate solution (0.05 M) at 80 C for 16 h." This method results in isolated Zn2+ sites. 

[2] The stability of different Zn sites is evaluated: "Although [Zn-OH]+ sites deactivated over TOS mainly due to their sublimation in the reductive reaction environment, [Zn-O-Zn]2+ associated with paired framework Al atoms is a stable configuration even after high-temperature reduction (750 C for 60 min)." This shows that encapsulating Zn species like [Zn-O-Zn]2+ in the zeolite framework enhances stability.

[3] The impregnation method is used to prepare Zn/H-ZSM-5 samples: "Ga/H-ZSM-5(X, Y) and Zn/H-ZSM-5(X, Y) samples were obtained via the IWI method with gallium nitrate hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) or zinc nitrate hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution, then dried at 80 C for 6 h, and calcined at 600 C for 2 h." This aims to achieve good dispersion. 

[4] In situ FTIR is used to study catalysts during H2 treatment: "Upon reducing the Zn/H-ZSM-5(15, 0.63) with H2 (1 atm) at 550 C, a band at 1926 cm−1 (ZnHx) is observed in the presence of H2 and disappears under vacuum at the same temperature." This reveals insights about Zn hydride formation.

[5] No advanced microscopy techniques are used to characterize metal-support interfaces.

[6] No X-ray based techniques are used to probe oxidation state changes during catalysis. 

[7] No evaluation of different reactor types is provided.
