[1] "Precise synthesis and characterization of bimetallic nanoparticles are critical toward understanding structureactivity relationships in alkane dehydrogenation catalysis."

[2] "Using a multistep colloidal deposition, we can directly synthesize PtIn and PtGa nanoparticles with good uniformity as well as well-defined size and composition."  

[3] "The multistep synthetic process for the synthesis of colloidal Pt3In, PtIn2, and Pt3Ga nanoparticles supported on SiO2 for alkane dehydrogenation is illustrated in Scheme 1."

[4] "Colloidal synthesis is a powerful strategy that enables access to bimetallic nanoparticles with controlled composition, morphology, and surface capping."

[5] "In all cases, the colloidal synthetic method ensures that promoter atoms are fully incorporated into the bimetallic nanoparticle and no excess promoter oxide remains on the surface."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It utilizes colloidal synthesis techniques to prepare bimetallic PtIn and PtGa nanoparticles with controlled size, composition, and morphology prior to supporting them on SiO2. A multistep process is illustrated to synthesize the nanoparticles and uniformly deposit them onto the support while retaining their uniformity. This colloidal approach ensures full incorporation of promoter atoms and eliminates excess promoter oxides.

[1] "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments were carried out at the Pt LIII (11.564 keV), In K (27.940 keV), and Ga K (10.367 keV) edges in transmission mode."

[2] "The X-ray absorption near edge (XANES) region for both the Pt and promoter edges clearly show electronic perturbations due to alloy formation." 

[3] "X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) region of the spectra provides clear evidence of bimetallic alloy formation in all PtM samples."

[4] "Local structures, coordination numbers (CNs), and bond distances (Rs) at the Pt, In, and Ga edges were determined from k2-weighted first shell fitting of the EXAFS spectra."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during catalysis. It employs X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Pt, In, and Ga edges to characterize the electronic structure and local coordination environments in the bimetallic nanoparticles after high temperature reduction. The XANES spectra reveal electronic perturbations from alloy formation, while the EXAFS fitting provides evidence of bimetallic bonding and phase identification.
