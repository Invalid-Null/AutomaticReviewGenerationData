 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative files, here is the JSON structure with the consistency ratios:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},
  "4": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"}, 
  "5": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},
  "6": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},

}
```

The consistency ratio was calculated by comparing the provided correct answers to each comparative file's answers for the corresponding question number. 100% indicates complete consistency, while 0% indicates completely inconsistent answers.
