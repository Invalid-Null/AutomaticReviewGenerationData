<quotes>
[1] "Colloidal synthesis is a powerful strategy that enables access to bimetallic nanoparticles with controlled composition, morphology, and surface capping."

[2] "In all cases, the selectivity vs conversion data for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation look very similar across all three colloidal bimetallic nanoparticles, we anticipate that bimetallic composition, phase, and morphology should have a strong impact on the kinetics of alkane dehydrogenation."

[3] "The c-PtIn2 catalyst, whose XANES white line shifts to higher energy by nearly 2 eV compared to monometallic Pt, shows the highest TOR for EDH. The c-Pt3Ga and c-Pt3In catalysts, while of similar average ensemble geometry, show fairly significant differences in edge energy, with the more energetically perturbed Pt3Ga showing the higher TOR in EDH."

<English version answer>  
3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It utilizes colloidal synthesis to control the composition, morphology, and phase of Pt-In and Pt-Ga bimetallic nanoparticles. It shows that while the selectivity profiles look similar, the kinetics of alkane dehydrogenation are strongly impacted by the composition, with PtIn2 showing the highest turnover rate. This is attributed to both electronic effects from the In promoting orbital hybridization with Pt, as evidenced by shifts in the Pt XANES spectrum, as well as geometric effects from the change in surface ensemble upon forming the CaF2 crystal structure in PtIn2.

3. 是的,本文研究了双金属和合金催化剂中辅助金属的电子效应和几何效应。它利用胶体合成来控制Pt-In和Pt-Ga双金属纳米粒子的组成、形态和相。它表明,虽然选择性曲线看起来相似,但烷烃脱氢动力学却严重受组成影响,其中PtIn2呈现出最高的转化率。这归因于In促进与Pt的轨道杂化带来的电子效应,正如Pt XANES谱中的位移所显示的那样,以及形成PtIn2中的CaF2晶体结构时表面配合物改变带来的几何效应。

[1] "We turned to X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements at the Pt LIII (11.564 keV), In K (27.940 keV), and Ga K (10.367 keV) edges to more clearly elucidate the degree of alloying and local coordination environment of the colloidal PtM nanoparticles."

[2] "The increase in XANES edge energy is indicative of an upward shift in unfilled valence states of Pt, which is typically coupled to a downward shift in the filled d-band states of Pt." 

[3] "Given that the surface ensemble geometry of Pt changes across the Pt, Pt3M, and PtM2 phases, we anticipate that changes in the binding geometry of the key transition state structures to the surface will strongly impact the entropic activation parameters."
