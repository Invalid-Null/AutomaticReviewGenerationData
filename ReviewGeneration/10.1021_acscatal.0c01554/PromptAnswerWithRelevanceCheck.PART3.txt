<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It utilizes colloidal synthesis techniques to prepare bimetallic PtIn and PtGa nanoparticles with controlled size, composition, and morphology prior to supporting them on SiO2. A multistep process is illustrated to synthesize the nanoparticles and uniformly deposit them onto the support while retaining their uniformity. This colloidal approach ensures full incorporation of promoter atoms and eliminates excess promoter oxides.
