 Upon reviewing the provided answers, I have assessed that they do not contain relevant information to address the given questions about propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The answers indicate that the literature reviewed focuses exclusively on colloidal synthesis of bimetallic catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation, without evaluating metal oxide or supported mono-metallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation specifically. No mechanistic insights, structure-function relationships, or active site descriptions are provided for propane dehydrogenation over any catalyst system in the given answers. Therefore, I will respond with the following statement:

※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※
