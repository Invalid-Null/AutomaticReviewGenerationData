[1] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction."

[2] "NH3-TPD studies of the polymorphs of gallium oxide show that acid sites of medium strength are abundant on the surface of these catalysts, particularly β-Ga2O3."

[3] "When the reactivity of the polymorphs is correlated with the results of acidity measurements, it can be concluded that the surface acid site density probably plays a decisive role in the competition between the polymorphs."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates chromium oxide, Pt-Sn, and polymorphs of gallium oxide as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on catalytic activity, selectivity, stability, and proposed mechanistic insights for these catalysts. Specifically, it shows β-Ga2O3 is most promising with higher activity than Cr2O3 in presence of CO2.

[1] Dehydrogenation of propane to propene over different polymorphs of gallium oxide was investigated.  

[2] β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs, and it is even more active than chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2.

[3] H2-TPR and XPS studies show that gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600C.

[4] The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway 

[5] the dehydrogenation reaction is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction.

[6] The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is probably associated with an abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of gallium oxide polymorphs affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that β-Ga2O3 with highest surface acid site density is most active, indicating acid sites play key role. No data on modifying oxidation states or oxygen mobility.
