<English version answer>
Answer: The article evaluates chromium oxide, Pt-Sn, and polymorphs of gallium oxide as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on catalytic activity, selectivity, stability, and proposed mechanistic insights for these catalysts. Specifically, it shows β-Ga2O3 is most promising with higher activity than Cr2O3 in presence of CO2.

<quotes>

[1] "NH3-TPD studies of the polymorphs of gallium oxide show that acid sites of medium strength are abundant on the surface of these catalysts, particularly β-Ga2O3." 

[2] "When the reactivity of the polymorphs is correlated with the results of acidity measurements, it can be concluded that the surface acid site density probably plays a decisive role in the competition between the polymorphs."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning acid-base properties affects propane dehydrogenation over gallium oxide polymorphs. It shows β-Ga2O3 with highest surface acid site density is most active, indicating acid sites play key role. No data on modifying oxidation states or oxygen mobility.

答:是的,该文研究了调控高锗氧化物多晶体的酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢反应。它表明表面酸性位密度最高的β-Ga2O3活性最好,这说明酸性位发挥关键作用。文中没有提供调控氧化态或氧迁移的数据。

<quotes>

[1] "Previous studies have shown that the dihydrogen molecule is dissociatively adsorbed on gallium oxide, leading to the formation of H and H+ ions."

[2] "Hence it also has been suggested that propane can heterolytically dissociate on gallium oxide, forming gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species."

[3] "The alkoxides would decompose further to form the dehydrogenation products."  

[4] "When both Ga2O3 and H+ are present on the catalyst, the propyl carbenium ion on Ga2O3 will readily exchange with a proton through a surface migration reaction."  

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes a heterolytic dissociation mechanistic pathway for propane dehydrogenation over gallium oxide polymorphs, involving dissociative hydrogen adsorption, propane dissociation into gallium hydride and alkoxide species, further decomposition and proton exchange steps.
