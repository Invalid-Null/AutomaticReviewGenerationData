[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene over different polymorphs of gallium oxide was investigated."

[2] "β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs"

[3] "H2-TPR and XPS studies show that gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600C." 

[4] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway"

[5] "the dehydrogenation reaction is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction."

[6] "The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is probably associated with an abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites"

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of gallium oxide polymorphs affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest dehydrogenation activity among the polymorphs. Gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600°C based on H2-TPR and XPS studies. The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed via a heterolytic dissociation pathway and is enhanced by CO2 due to reverse water gas shift and Boudouard reactions. The high activity of β-Ga2O3 is probably associated with abundant medium-strength surface acid sites.

Answer: 是的,该文献研究了调控氧化态、氧迁移和酸碱性等 gallium 氧化物多晶体的性质如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。结果显示β-Ga2O3的脱氢活性最高。H2-TPR 和 XPS 研究表明,600°C以下氧化镓几乎不发生还原。文献提出脱氢反应通过异裂反应途径进行,并由于反向水煤气转换反应和布杜厄尔反应的存在而被 CO2 增强。β-Ga2O3 的高活性可能与其表面中等强度的酸性位丰富有关。

[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane or ethane over reducible metal oxide catalysts, such as chromium and iron oxides, in the presence of CO2 has been suggested to follow a redox mechanism." 

[2] "Since gallium oxide is hardly reduced and the redox cycle is irreverible under the reaction temperature according to the experimental results in this work, the redox mechanism is probably inapplicable for the reaction."

[3] "Previous studies have shown that the dihydrogen molecule is dissociatively adsorbed on gallium oxide, leading to the formation of H and H+ ions."

[4] "Hence it has also been suggested that propane can heterolytically dissociate on gallium oxide, forming gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species:"

[5] "The conjugated effect of gallium oxide and a proton is to replace the slow step (2) with the fast equilibrium (4)."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes a heterolytic dissociation mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the studied gallium oxide polymorph catalysts. Since gallium oxide is hardly reduced, a redox pathway is deemed inapplicable. Instead, propane is suggested to dissociatively adsorb on gallium oxide, forming gallium hydride and alkoxide species. The conjugated effect of gallium oxide and protons facilitates the conversion to propene.

Answer: 是的,该文献为所研究的氧化镓多晶体催化剂提出了异裂脱氢的反应机理。由于氧化镓难以还原,归还机理不适用。相反,提出丙烷在氧化镓上发生解离吸附,生成氢化镓和烷氧化物。氧化镓与质子的协同作用有利于产物丙烯的生成。
