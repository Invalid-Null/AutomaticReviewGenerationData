 Unfortunately, upon reviewing the provided answers, I have assessed that they do not contain information relevant to answering the questions asked. As instructed, I will stop my review process and simply respond:

※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※

The answers indicate that the source document discusses the catalytic performance of different gallium oxide polymorphs for propane dehydrogenation, especially in the presence of CO2. It does not address process intensification approaches, techno-economic analyses, safety issues, remaining challenges, computational screening methods, characterization tools needs, or transformational catalyst architectures as asked about in the questions.

Please let me know if you would like me to attempt reviewing a different document that contains information more pertinent to answering this set of questions on propane dehydrogenation. I'm happy to help analyze any content related to the topics raised in the questions.
