To determine the consistency ratios, I carefully compared the content of each answer file against the correct answers provided. I looked for similarities and differences in the key points covered in both the English and Chinese answers. 

For most questions, the answer files provided very consistent answers matching the correct ones, so I assigned consistency ratios of 100%. 

For question 10 and the answer4.txt file, there was some relevant information provided but it did not fully capture the key details about the proposed heterolytic dissociation mechanism over gallium oxide. So I estimated the consistency to be around 40% for that case.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
