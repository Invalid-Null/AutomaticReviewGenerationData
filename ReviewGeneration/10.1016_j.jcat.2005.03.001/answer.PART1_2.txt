<quotes>
[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene over different polymorphs of gallium oxide was investigated."
[2] "β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs"
[3] "it is even more active than chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2"
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates different polymorphs of Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation and finds that β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs. It is even more active than Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,该文研究了不同晶型的Ga2O3用于丙烷脱氢,发现β-Ga2O3在多晶型中活性最高。在CO2存在下,其活性甚至高于Cr2O3催化剂。

<quotes>
[1] "NH3-TPD studies of the polymorphs of gallium oxide show that acid sites of medium strength are abundant on the surface of these catalysts" 
[2] "When the reactivity of the polymorphs is correlated with the results of acidity measurements, it can be concluded that the surface acid site density probably plays a decisive role in the competition between the polymorphs."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning acid-base properties of Ga2O3 polymorphs affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It finds that surface acid site density plays a decisive role, with β-Ga2O3 having the highest density and also the highest activity.  
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,该文研究了调控Ga2O3多晶型的酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它发现表面酸性位密度起决定性作用,β-Ga2O3的密度最高,活性也最高。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "Previous studies have shown that the dihydrogen molecule is dissociatively adsorbed on gallium oxide, leading to the formation of H and H+ ions"
[2] "Propane can heterolytically dissociate on gallium oxide, forming gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species" 
[3] "The alkoxides would decompose further to form the dehydrogenation products"
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes a heterolytic dissociation mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3 catalysts. It involves dissociative adsorption of H2, heterolytic dissociation of propane into gallium hydride and alkoxide species, and further decomposition of alkoxides into olefins.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,该文为Ga2O3催化剂上的丙烷脱氢提出了一种杂裂解机理。它涉及H2的解离吸附、丙烷发生杂裂解生成镓氢化物和碱化物种,以及碱化物的进一步分解生成烯烃。
