[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propene." 
[2] "The high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
4. Yes, the article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction that requires high temperatures to achieve high propylene yields, but high temperatures also lead to thermal cracking to coke and lighter alkanes, decreasing yield and deactivating catalysts. No quantitative details of thermodynamics or kinetics are provided.  

</English version answer>
