<quotes>
[1] Dehydrogenation of propane to propene over different polymorphs of gallium oxide was investigated. 
[2] β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs, and it is even more active than chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2.  
[3] The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of gallium oxide polymorphs affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest dehydrogenation activity among the polymorphs, even higher than Cr2O3 with CO2. The high activity is associated with abundant medium-strong acid sites on β-Ga2O3 which facilitate the heterolytic dissociation pathway.

Answer: 这篇文章研究了调节氧化态、氧迁移和酸碱性如何影响各种锗氧化物的丙烷脱氢性能。结果显示,在各种多型体中,β-Ga2O3表现出最高的脱氢活性,甚至比Cr2O3与CO2存在时还要高。这种高活性与β-Ga2O3表面丰富的中等强度酸点有关,它促进了异裂解途径。

[1] The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway.
[2] Propane can heterolytically dissociate on gallium oxide, forming gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species. The alkoxides would decompose further to form the dehydrogenation products.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes that propane dehydrogenation over gallium oxide catalysts proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation pathway. Specific steps involve propane dissociating on gallium oxide to form gallium hydride and alkoxide species. The alkoxides then decompose to produce alkenes.
