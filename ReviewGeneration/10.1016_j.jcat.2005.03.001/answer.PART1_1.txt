<quotes>

[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence or absence of CO2 over four polymorphs of gallium oxide was investigated."

[2] "H2-TPR and XPS studies show that gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600C." 

[3] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of gallium oxide polymorphs affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600°C, and proposes the dehydrogenation reaction proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation pathway enhanced by CO2 due to reverse water gas shift and Boudouard reactions.

[1] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction." 

[2] "Propane then results from the equilibrium: S  C3H6 + H+S."

[3] "The conjugated effect of gallium oxide and a proton is to replace the slow step (2) with the fast equilibrium (4)."  

[4] "The reverse water gas shift reaction (6) and the Boudouard reaction (7) may play positive roles in the dehydrogenation reaction:"

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes the propane dehydrogenation reaction proceeds through heterolytic dissociation of propane on gallium oxide sites to form gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species. The dehydrogenation is promoted by the conjugated effect of gallium oxide and protons. The reverse water gas shift and Boudouard reactions of CO2 enhance the catalytic activity and stability.
