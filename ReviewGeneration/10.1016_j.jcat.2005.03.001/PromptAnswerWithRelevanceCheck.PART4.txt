<Answer>

 Unfortunately, this document does not contain relevant quotes or information to answer any of the questions asked. The document is a scientific study on the dehydrogenation of propane to propene over different polymorphs of gallium oxide catalysts. It does not discuss process intensification approaches, techno-economic factors, safety issues, remaining challenges, high-throughput computational methods, in-situ characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation.

The questions seem incorrectly matched to this document. I would be happy to attempt answering them if provided with a more relevant document on propane dehydrogenation processes and catalysts. Please let me know if you would like me to make another attempt with different source material.
