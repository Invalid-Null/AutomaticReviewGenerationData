<quotes>

[1] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[2] "The mesoporous zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores."

[3] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metal-support interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It focuses on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as the support, which provides high metal nanoparticle dispersion. It also incorporates rare-earth elements like La and Y along with Pt into the mesoporous zeolite, as they are known to have strong interactions with Pt to stabilize small Pt nanoparticles.

<quotes>

[1] "To determine the detailed atomic structure of the bimetallic nanoparticles, atomic-resolution (AR) HAADF-STEM images and the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) images were taken along different zone axes, [100] and [110]." 

[2] "The AR-HAADF-STEM image taken along [100] displays a regular array of bright and dark regions, which correspond to two different types of atomic column aligned perpendicularly to the image (Fig. 1d)."

[3] "On the basis of the STEM investigation, a structural model of the Pt3Y nanoparticle is proposed in Fig. 1i."
