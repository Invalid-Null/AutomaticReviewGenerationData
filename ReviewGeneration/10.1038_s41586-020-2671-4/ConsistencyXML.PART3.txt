To generate this XML, I compared the answers in each file to the correct answers provided and calculated a consistency percentage for each question. A percentage of 100% indicates the answers were fully consistent, while lower percentages indicate more inconsistency compared to the correct answers. The percentages were calculated by manually reviewing and comparing the provided answers to estimate the level of consistency across the various files.
