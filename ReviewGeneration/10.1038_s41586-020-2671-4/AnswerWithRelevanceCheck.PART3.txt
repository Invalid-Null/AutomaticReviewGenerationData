         [1] "To our surprise, the catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with the addition of La and Y."
         [2] "The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles."
         [3] "We believe that the silanol nests could stabilize the single atomic REE species by forming coordination bonds. In that case, it would be possible to control the formation of PtREE alloy nanoparticles by the concentration of silanol nests in the zeolite." 
         [4] "This process is currently attracting interest in the area of heterogeneous catalysis owing to a sudden increase in propane supply from the shale gas revolution. The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s."
         [5] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

         3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It focuses on using a mesoporous MFI zeolite support instead of traditional alumina, because the mesoporous zeolite provides high metal nanoparticle dispersion. It utilizes silanol nest defect sites in the zeolite framework to stabilize single atomic rare earth species, allowing control over the formation of Pt-rare earth alloy nanoparticles. The addition of La and Y using this method increased catalytic lifetime more than tenfold.

         3. 是的,该文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它专注于使用介孔MFI沸石载体来代替传统的氧化铝,因为介孔沸石可以提供高的金属纳米粒子分散度。它利用了沸石框架中的硅醇巢缺陷位点来稳定单原子稀土元素种,从而控制铂-稀土合金纳米粒子的形成。用这种方法添加La和Y使催化剂的使用寿命增加了10倍以上。

         [1] "Investigation by atomic-resolution electron microscopy showed that some La and Y existed in an alloyed form with Pt nanoparticles, supported on the mesoporous zeolite."
         [2] "To determine the detailed atomic structure of the bimetallic nanoparticles, atomic-resolution (AR) HAADF-STEM images and the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) images were taken along different zone axes, [100] and [110]." 
         [3] "Fig. 1 shows the structure of the PtY intermetallic compound nanoparticles formed on the mesoporous zeolite. Representative low-magnification high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images (Fig. 1a, b) show metal nanoparticles about 3 nm in diameter uniformly distributed over the zeolite support, with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements indicating that Pt and Y coexist in the same particle (Fig. 1c)."
         [4] "The AR-HAADF-STEM image taken along [100] displays a regular array of bright and dark regions, which correspond to two different types of atomic column aligned perpendicularly to the image (Fig. 1d)."
         [5] "On the basis of the STEM investigation, a structural model of the Pt3Y nanoparticle is proposed in Fig. 1i."

         5. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like HAADF-STEM, FFT, and EDS to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses these techniques to determine the detailed atomic structure of Pt-REE bimetallic nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolite, revealing their intermetallic compound structure.

         [1] "The XANES spectra were measured at the Pt L3 edge and the Y K edge in transmission mode at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (10C-Wide XAFS beamline)."
         [2] "The XANES spectra were calibrated using Pt and Y metal foil references, which were purchased from Alfa Aesar. All the analysis of XANES data was performed using ATHENA software22."
         [3] "This indicates that the electronic state of the intermetallic compound nanoparticles was markedly different from that of monometallic Pt, as further confirmed by XANES analysis (see Extended Data Fig. 5), which indicated a noticeable shift in edge energy and in the white-line region upon the formation of PtREE intermetallic compounds."

         6. Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It measures the Pt L3 and Y K edge XANES spectra to confirm the formation of Pt-Y intermetallic compounds, which show markedly different electronic states compared to monometallic Pt. The XANES analysis indicates shifts in the absorption edge energy and white-line region.
