[1] "This process is currently attracting interest in the area of heterogeneous catalysis owing to a sudden increase in propane supply from the shale gas revolution. The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s."

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."  

[3] "We believe that the silanol nests could stabilize the single atomic REE species by forming coordination bonds. In that case, it would be possible to control the formation of PtREE alloy nanoparticles by the concentration of silanol nests in the zeolite."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It focuses on using a mesoporous MFI zeolite support instead of traditional alumina, because the mesoporous zeolite provides high metal nanoparticle dispersion. It also utilizes silanol nest defect sites in the zeolite framework to stabilize single atomic rare earth species, allowing control over the formation of Pt-rare earth alloy nanoparticles.

[1] "To determine the detailed atomic structure of the bimetallic nanoparticles, atomic-resolution (AR) HAADF-STEM images and the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) images were taken along different zone axes, [100] and [110]."

[2] "The AR-HAADF-STEM image taken along [100] displays a regular array of bright and dark regions, which correspond to two different types of atomic column aligned perpendicularly to the image (Fig. 1d)." 

[3] "On the basis of the STEM investigation, a structural model of the Pt3Y nanoparticle is proposed in Fig. 1i."

5. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM imaging and fast Fourier transform analysis to determine the detailed atomic structure of Pt-rare earth bimetallic nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolite. This reveals the formation of ordered intermetallic compounds like Pt3Y and Pt3La.

[1] "The XANES spectra were measured at the Pt L3 edge and the Y K edge in transmission mode at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (10C-Wide XAFS beamline)."

[2] "All the XANES spectra were calibrated using Pt and Y metal foil references, which were purchased from Alfa Aesar. All the analysis of XANES data was performed using ATHENA software." 

[3] "This indicates that the electronic state of the intermetallic compound nanoparticles was markedly different from that of monometallic Pt, as further confirmed by XANES analysis (see Extended Data Fig. 5), which indicated a noticeable shift in edge energy and in the white-line region upon the formation of PtREE intermetallic compounds."

6. Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It measures the Pt L3 and Y K edge XANES spectra to confirm the formation of Pt-Y intermetallic compounds, which show markedly different electronic states compared to monometallic Pt. The XANES analysis indicates shifts in the absorption edge energy and white-line region.
