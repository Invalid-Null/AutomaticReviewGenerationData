[1] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[2] "The mesoporous zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores."

[3] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metal-support interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles."

[1] "This process is currently attracting interest in the area of heterogeneous catalysis owing to a sudden increase in propane supply from the shale gas revolution. The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s."

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."
