[1] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[2] "The Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction." 

[3] "In recent years, efficient conversion of propane to propylene was reported with PtZn and PtSn catalysts supported on zeolites19,20,21."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article evaluates the use of a siliceous MFI zeolite with micro-/mesoporous structure as a support for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows that PtLa intermetallic nanoparticles supported on degallated MFI zeolite (PtLa/mz-deGa) exhibited high initial propane conversion (~40%) and very slow deactivation over 30 days on stream. It also cites recent work using PtZn and PtSn on zeolite supports.

<quotes>

[1] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."

[2] "Because La has a larger atomic size and lower electron negativity than Y, the geometric and electronic properties of Pt were modified to a greater extent."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in Pt-La and Pt-Y bimetallic alloy catalysts. It explains that Sn forms an alloy with Pt to dilute the surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles. It also states that La modifies the geometric and electronic properties of Pt more than Y due to its larger size and lower electronegativity.

</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>

3. 答:是的,这篇文章研究了 Pt-La 和 Pt-Y 双金属合金催化剂中第二金属的电子和几何效应。它解释说 Sn 与 Pt 形成合金以稀释 Pt 表面上的非活性 Sn 原子,打破产生焦炭的 Pt 组合。它还指出由于 La 的原子大小更大、电负性更低,相比 Y 更多地改变了 Pt 的几何和电子性质。
