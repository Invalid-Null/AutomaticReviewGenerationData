 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that directly answer the specific questions about propane dehydrogenation mechanisms, kinetics, thermodynamics, catalyst design, or computational modeling. The article focuses on propylene separation, not propane dehydrogenation.

<English version answer>

1. The literature does not provide any background information on propane dehydrogenation specifically. It focuses on propylene separation.

2. The literature does not explain catalyst activity mechanisms for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on propylene separation. 

3. The literature does not introduce catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on propylene separation.

4. The literature does not discuss thermodynamic or kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on propylene separation.

5. The literature does not describe DFT calculations applied to propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on propylene separation. 

6. The literature does not present microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on propylene separation.

7. The literature does not describe structure-activity relationships for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It focuses on propylene separation.
