      [1] "To keep the reaction conditions consistent with theoretical kinetic modeling shown in Figure 3, the experimental inlet C3H8/H2 ratio is set to be 1/1, which is experimentally reported to be able to alleviate coke formation of the Pt catalyst but is usually accompanied with low propylene selectivity."

      [2] "For comparison, the catalytic PDH performance was also examined in the presence of the Pt/Al2O3 (1 wt%) catalyst."

      [3] "As shown in Figure 4, the propylene selectivity for NiMo/Al2O3 is two times higher than Pt/Al2O3, whereas the propylene selectivity improves to 63.1% for NiMo/Al2O3 with 11.9% conversion compared with 28.5% selectivity and 16.6% conversion for Pt/Al2O3 after 6 h."

Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It examines the catalytic performance of 1 wt% Pt/Al2O3 and compares it to NiMo/Al2O3. The article finds NiMo/Al2O3 has twice the propylene selectivity (63.1%) compared to Pt/Al2O3 (28.5%) under the same conditions.

      是的,该文献评估了负载的单金属Pt/Al2O3催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。文献测试了1 wt% Pt/Al2O3的催化性能,并与NiMo/Al2O3进行了比较。结果发现,在相同条件下,NiMo/Al2O3的丙烯选择性是Pt/Al2O3的两倍(分别为63.1%和28.5%)。

      [1] "Compared with other reported Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, (9,38) our NiMo/Al2O3 exhibits better selectivity, although the conversion is slightly lower. The Ni/Al2O3 and Mo/Al2O3 are also prepared and tested for PDH. As shown in Figure S7, the NiMo/Al2O3 showed the highest initial propylene formation compared with isolated Ni and Mo catalysts, indicating the NiMo being the main active centers."

      [2] "For the Pt/Al2O3, about 2 nm of Pt nanoparticles were determined by TEM, as shown in Figure S9."

      [3] "Well-defined nanoparticles were observed with an average diameter of 15-20 nm and the Ni/Mo ratio of 3.2 shown in Figure S8."

      [4] "Moreover, the TEMEDS maps confirm the formation of 3:1 Ni/Mo-alloyed nanoparticles shown in Figure 5h,i."

Yes, the article investigates how properties like particle size and alloy formation affect the performance of supported Pt and NiMo catalysts. It shows NiMo/Al2O3 with 15-20 nm NiMo alloy nanoparticles exhibits better selectivity than Pt/Al2O3 with ~2 nm Pt nanoparticles. This suggests alloy formation and larger particle size improve selectivity for propane dehydrogenation.

      是的,该文献研究了诸如粒径和合金形成等特性如何影响负载Pt和NiMo催化剂的性能。结果显示,含有15-20 nm NiMo合金纳米粒子的NiMo/Al2O3比含有~2 nm Pt纳米粒子的Pt/Al2O3具有更好的选择性。这表明合金形成和较大的粒径提高了丙烷脱氢的选择性。

      [1] "As proposed by extensive available theoretical studies, (9,24,25,32) the energy difference between propylene desorption and deep dehydrogenation is identified as an important indicator for controlling propylene selectivity."

      [2] "Finally, any further deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propylidene would generate propyne, which will result in selectivity loss and coking via CC scission."

      [3] "We therefore propose that the reaction rate difference between propylene and propyne production is a key indicator for the propylene selectivity in PDH."

    <English>
Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic reaction pathway for propane dehydrogenation over the metallic catalysts studied. It describes key steps like propane dehydrogenation to propylene vs further dehydrogenation to propyne. It identifies the energy difference between propylene desorption and dehydrogenation as controlling selectivity, with propyne leading to coking. The rate difference between propylene and propyne production is proposed as a key selectivity indicator.

      是的,该文献为所研究的金属催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢的机理反应途径。它描述了关键步骤,如丙烷脱氢生成丙烯与进一步脱氢生成丙炔。它认为丙烯脱附与脱氢之间的能量差控制选择性,丙炔会导致结焦。它提出丙烯与丙炔生成速率之间的差异是选择性的一个关键指标。
