[1] "We introduce an effective framework, combining first-principle-based kinetic simulations, high-throughput computations, machine learning concepts, and experiments, to accelerate the discovery of promising metallic catalysts for selective propylene production from PDH."

[2] "A decision map is introduced through a well-defined acquisition function, which lays the foundation and the theoretical guidelines for an effective PDH catalyst screening."

[3] "Further screening of nonprecious metal alloys identified NiMo as a very interesting candidate composition and our experimental collaborators verified that it has a better propylene activity/selectivity than Pt."

Answer: Yes, the article does propose leveraging high-throughput computational methods to accelerate propane dehydrogenation catalyst screening and design. Specifically, it introduces an effective framework combining first-principle kinetic simulations, high-throughput computations, machine learning concepts, and experiments to discover promising PDH catalysts. It uses a decision map based on an acquisition function for efficient theoretical screening. This approach identified NiMo as a promising non-precious metal alloy catalyst, which was experimentally verified to outperform Pt.
