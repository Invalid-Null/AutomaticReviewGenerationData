<quotes>
[1] "Considering that the industrial catalysts for PDH are based mainly on Cr and PtSn, the non-noble and low-toxic NiMo catalyst alternative offers a potentially promising catalyst interesting not only for fundamental scientific reasons but also for application in industry."

[2] "Compared with other reported Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, (9,38) our NiMo/Al2O3 exhibits better selectivity, although the conversion is slightly lower.  The Ni/Al2O3 and Mo/Al2O3 are also prepared and tested for PDH. As shown in Figure S7, the NiMo/Al2O3 showed the highest initial propylene formation compared with isolated Ni and Mo catalysts, indicating the NiMo being the main active centers."

5. Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It reports testing Pt/Al2O3 and finding it has lower selectivity and stability compared to NiMo/Al2O3. The article also tests Ni/Al2O3 and Mo/Al2O3 individually and finds NiMo/Al2O3 has the highest initial propylene formation, indicating NiMo as the main active sites.

[1] "Compared with other reported Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, (9,38) our NiMo/Al2O3 exhibits better selectivity, although the conversion is slightly lower." 

[2] "For the Pt/Al2O3, about 2 nm of Pt nanoparticles were determined by TEM, as shown in Figure S9."

[3] "Well-defined nanoparticles were observed with an average diameter of 15-20 nm and the Ni/Mo ratio of 3.2 shown in Figure S8."

[4] "Moreover, the TEMEDS maps confirm the formation of 3:1 Ni/Mo-alloyed nanoparticles shown in Figure 5h,i."

6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like particle size and alloy formation affect the performance of supported Pt and NiMo catalysts. It shows NiMo/Al2O3 with 15-20 nm NiMo alloy nanoparticles exhibits better selectivity than Pt/Al2O3 with ~2 nm Pt nanoparticles. This suggests alloy formation and larger particle size improve selectivity for propane dehydrogenation.

6. 是的,文章研究了诸如粒径和合金形成等特性如何影响负载Pt和NiMo催化剂的性能。结果显示,含有15-20 nm NiMo合金纳米粒子的NiMo/Al2O3比含有~2 nm Pt纳米粒子的Pt/Al2O3具有更好的选择性。这表明合金形成和较大的粒径提高了丙烷脱氢的选择性。

[1] "As proposed by extensive available theoretical studies, (9,24,25,32) the energy difference between propylene desorption and deep dehydrogenation is identified as an important indicator for controlling propylene selectivity."

[2] "Finally, any further deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propylidene would generate propyne, which will result in selectivity loss and coking via CC scission."

[3] "We therefore propose that the reaction rate difference between propylene and propyne production is a key indicator for the propylene selectivity in PDH."

<English version answer>
7. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic reaction pathway for propane dehydrogenation over the metallic catalysts studied. It describes key steps like propane dehydrogenation to propylene vs further dehydrogenation to propyne. It identifies the energy difference between propylene desorption and dehydrogenation as controlling selectivity, with propyne leading to coking. The rate difference between propylene and propyne production is proposed as a key selectivity indicator.
