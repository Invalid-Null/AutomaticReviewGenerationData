[1] "We introduced an effective framework, combining first-principle-based kinetic simulations, high-throughput computations, machine learning concepts, and experiments, to accelerate the discovery of promising metallic catalysts for selective propylene production from PDH."

[2] "The recent developments and implementations of machine learning in chemistry and material science have further accelerated catalyst design using advanced materials."

[3] "In summary, the ideal descriptors should be able to capture the differences among the catalyst surfaces and specifically separate them in the 2D volcanoes."

[4] "Clearly, our simulations not only successfully identify experimentally known catalysts but also provide suggestions for promising PDH catalysts."
