 <quotes>

[1] Propylene is an important building block for industrial production of numerous chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, cumene, oxo-chemicals, propylene oxide, isopropyl alcohol, and acrylic acid.

[2] The increasing demand for pure propylene instead of mixed olefins promotes the development of the on-purpose catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) (C3H8 → C3H6 + H2, ΔH298K = 124 kJ/mol). 

[3] The commercial catalysts for selective PDH include Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, where Pt is environmentally friendly and thus more favored.

[4] The reaction networks between close-packed Pt(111) and stepped Pt(211) surfaces revealed that smaller Pt particles with more step sites had much higher activity but also lower selectivity and coke resistance.

[5] A density functional theory (DFT) study showed that PDH on a Pt-based catalyst could be accelerated by cofeeding hydrogen.

[6] The important role of hydrogen in improving PDH selectivity has also been demonstrated by a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation, and the active sites of Pt catalysts for the dehydrogenation and CC bond cracking were proven to be different.

[7] Systematic DFT computations of the reaction pathways from propane to propyne were performed. The formation energies of all related adsorbates and transition states (TSs) are given in Figure S1.

<English version answer>

1. The article provides background that propylene is a key precursor for many industrial chemicals like polypropylene, and that propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important route for propylene production. It states that PDH is becoming more favored due to increasing propane supply and demand for pure propylene over mixed olefins.

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate PDH by lowering the activation energy barriers for dehydrogenation reactions. It describes how Pt catalysts in particular activate propane dehydrogenation through C-H bond breaking at active sites. 

3. The article introduces Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts as the major commercial catalysts for PDH, with Pt being more environmentally friendly. 

4. The article discusses how thermodynamics and kinetics affect selectivity and coking. It provides computational details showing smaller Pt particles are more active but less selective, due to a higher proportion of reactive step sites.

5. The article describes DFT studies modeling PDH mechanisms on Pt, such as showing co-fed H2 accelerates the reaction. 

6. The article presents kinetic Monte Carlo simulations providing insights into PDH kinetics on Pt, like showing different active sites for dehydrogenation vs. C-C cleavage.

7. The article describes systematic DFT computations of energies for intermediates and transition states in PDH pathways on various metals. This reveals trends in catalytic activity.

1. 该文提供了丙烯是许多工业化学品如聚丙烯的关键前体,丙烷脱氢(PDH)是丙烯生产的重要途径的背景。它指出,由于丙烷供应的增加和对纯丙烯而不是混合烯烃的需求,PDH变得越来越受青睐。

2. 该文解释了催化剂通过降低脱氢反应的活化能垒来促进PDH。它描述了Pt催化剂特别是如何通过C-H键断裂在活性位点上激活丙烷脱氢。

3. 该文介绍了Pt和CrOx基催化剂是PDH的主要商业催化剂,其中Pt更环保。

4. 该文讨论了热力学和动力学如何影响选择性和结焦。它提供了计算细节,显示较小的Pt颗粒由于具有更高比例的反应性步位点而更活性但选择性较低。
