 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative files, here is the JSON structure with the consistency ratios:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"}
}
```

The consistency ratios were determined by comparing the key points in each answer file against the correct answers. Files answer1.txt, answer3.txt, and answer4.txt contained the same key information as the correct answers, so they were given 100% consistency. File answer0.txt contained different information than the correct answers, so it was given 0% consistency.
