[1] "The reaction pathways from propane to propyne, as shown in Figure 1."

[2] "Calculations were restricted to close-packed fcc(111) surfaces for Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ir and hcp(0001) surfaces for Co, Ru, Re, and Os metals, using the BEEF-vdW exchange-correlation functional and all details are available in the Supporting Information."

[3] "Overall, the initial CH scission can take place at either the methyl or methylene functional group of propane, which produces 1-propyl (CH3CH2CH2) and 2-propyl (CH3CHCH3), respectively."

[1] "Based on the energetics from carefully constructed scaling relations and the PDH reaction mechanism in Figure 1, a mean-field microkinetic model is established that effectively maps the reaction rate of propylene at 873 K, 0.2 bar propane, C3H8/H2 = 1/1, and low propane conversion (0.1%)." 

[2] "In this regard, our results clearly identify Pt as the most promising catalyst for propylene production with both reasonable activity and selectivity, in agreement with widely available experimental results where Pt-based catalysts indeed are most useful industrially."

[1] "To identify the strongest pair of descriptors, we applied statistical analysis for this reaction." 

[2] "It is worth noting that 13 of these descriptor pairs have an overall MAE lower than 0.09 eV, which indicates that choosing any of these pairs will not result in significant accuracy loss for the scaled energetics of all species."

[3] "In summary, the ideal descriptors should be able to capture the differences among the catalyst surfaces and specifically separate them in the 2D volcanoes."

7. Yes, the article describes using statistical analysis to identify descriptor pairs that correlate catalyst binding properties to propane dehydrogenation performance. 13 descriptor pairs were found to model binding energies accurately, and the best were chosen to separate metals on 2D volcano plots.
