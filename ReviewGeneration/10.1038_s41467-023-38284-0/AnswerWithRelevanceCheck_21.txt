[1] Atom-resolved high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) images identified vanadia mainly existed as monolayers and bilayers along ceria surface (Fig. 1bd). Electron energy loss spectra (EELS) mappings of V L2,3 and Ce M4,5 edges affirmed vanadia sites anchored on widespread ceria nanodomains (Fig. 1eh). The well-defined core-shell structure was further validated by line-scanning EELS that crossed an individual particle, wherein the outer shell was 1nm, corresponding to roughly two to three atomic vanadia layers (Fig. 1i).

<English>
Yes, the article employs aberration-corrected STEM and EELS mapping to characterize the metal-support interface in the vanadia-ceria core-shell catalysts. It shows that the vanadia phase exists as 1-2 atomic layers coating the ceria support, validating the core-shell structure.
</English>

<Chinese>
是的,文章采用reducedCs STEM 和 EELS 元素映射来表征二氧化钒-氧化铈核壳结构催化剂的金属-载体界面。结果显示二氧化钒相以1-2原子层的形式覆盖在氧化铈载体表面,验证了核壳结构。

[1] In situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (QXANES) was performed at the XAFS station in the 1W1B beamline of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF).

[2] In situ XRD patterns were recorded using SmartLab equipped with an in situ cell and recorded in the 2θ range of 1080. The sample was reduced using 20% C3H8/N2 (20mL/min) at 600oC for 60min. The samples were then reoxidized using air (20mL/min) for 30min.
</Quotes>

<English>
Yes, the article utilizes in-situ XANES and XRD to probe oxidation state changes of vanadium and cerium during propane dehydrogenation. It shows that ceria is reduced while vanadia is maintained at a relatively constant moderate oxidation state, indicating that lattice oxygen from ceria transfers to stabilize the vanadia sites during reaction.
</English>

<Chinese>
是的,文章采用了原位XANES 和 XRD来探究丙烷脱氢过程中钒和铈的氧化态变化。结果显示,氧化铈被还原,而二氧化钒保持在一个相对恒定的中间氧化状态,这表明氧化铈的晶格氧转移过来稳定了脱氢过程中的二氧化钒活性位点。
