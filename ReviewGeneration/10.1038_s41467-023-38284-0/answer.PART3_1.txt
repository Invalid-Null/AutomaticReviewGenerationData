[1] "In situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (QXANES) was performed at the XAFS station in the 1W1B beamline of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). Each spectrum was collected under the normal mode and the sampling time was 3min. During the in situ experiments, the sample was reduced using 20% C3H8/N2 (20mL/min) at 600oC, and a V foil was employed for energy calibration. The XANES spectra of metallic V (V foil), V2O5, VO2, and V2O3 were employed as the references. All the data were analyzed by the software of Athena." 

[2] "In situ Raman spectra were recorded using a Renishaw inVia reflex Raman spectrometer with a 532nm Ar ion laser beam."

[3] "In situ DRIFTS spectra of temperature-programmed and isothermal propane dehydrogenation over ceria-vanadia (6V/30CeAl) (d) and vanadia (6V/Al) (e, f)."

[4] "In situ XRD patterns were recorded using SmartLab equipped with an in situ cell and recorded in the 2θ range of 1080."

[1] "Atom-resolved high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) images identified vanadia mainly existed as monolayers and bilayers along ceria surface (Fig. 1bd). Electron energy loss spectra (EELS) mappings of V L2,3 and Ce M4,5 edges affirmed vanadia sites anchored on widespread ceria nanodomains (Fig. 1eh)."

[2] "The well-defined core-shell structure was further validated by line-scanning EELS that crossed an individual particle, wherein the outer shell was 1nm, corresponding to roughly two to three atomic vanadia layers (Fig. 1i)."

5. Yes, the article employs high-resolution electron microscopy techniques like HAADF-STEM and EELS mapping to characterize the metal-support interface in the ceria-vanadia core-shell catalysts. It shows that vanadia exists as 1-2 atomic layers coating the ceria surface, validating the core-shell structure (Quotes 1-2).

The samples were then reoxidized using air (20mL/min) for 30min. During the reduction and reoxidation reaction period, an inert period (40mL/min of nitrogen) of about 10min was inserted to prevent the mixing between propane and air. One redox cycle was thus completed. Afterward, the second reaction cycle was started by switching between propane and air flows."
