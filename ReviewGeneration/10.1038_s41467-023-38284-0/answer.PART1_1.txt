[1] "Abstract: Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years. Nevertheless, existing non-oxidative dehydrogenation technologies still suffer from the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and severe coking. Here, we develop the intensified propane dehydrogenation to propylene by the chemical looping engineering on nanoscale core-shell redox catalysts."
