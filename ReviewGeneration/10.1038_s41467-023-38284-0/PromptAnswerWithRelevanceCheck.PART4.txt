Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question’s section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

 Here are the relevant quotes from the literature and my answers:

<quotes>

[1] Nevertheless, existing non-oxidative dehydrogenation technologies still suffer from the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and severe coking.

[2] Chemical looping engineering offers exciting new opportunities for the challenges through the physical or temporal separation of dehydrogenation and oxidation by solid oxygen carrier mediums.

[3] In a chemical looping scheme, the reaction and regeneration of redox catalyst are isolated spatially or temporally. Propane is converted to propylene in a dehydrogenation reactor. Meanwhile, the deactivated catalyst circulates between the reactor and regenerator by means of transfer lines. 

</quotes>

<English version answer>

1. The article discusses chemical looping as a process intensification approach for propane dehydrogenation. It describes physical/temporal separation of dehydrogenation and oxidation steps using solid oxygen carrier catalysts to address limitations of equilibrium and coking in conventional processes.
