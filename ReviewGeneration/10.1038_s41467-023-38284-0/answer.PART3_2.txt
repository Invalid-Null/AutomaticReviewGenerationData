[1] "In situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (QXANES) was performed at the XAFS station in the 1W1B beamline of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). Each spectrum was collected under the normal mode and the sampling time was 3min. During the in situ experiments, the sample was reduced using 20% C3H8/N2 (20mL/min) at 600oC, and a V foil was employed for energy calibration."

[2] "In situ Raman spectra were recorded using a Renishaw inVia reflex Raman spectrometer with a 532nm Ar ion laser beam. Samples were pretreated at 300 oC for 2h to eliminate the presence of hydrated species and then reacted at 600C under the flow of 20% C3H8/N2 (20mL/min)." 

[3] "In situ XRD patterns were recorded using SmartLab equipped with an in situ cell and recorded in the 2θ range of 1080. The sample was reduced using 20% C3H8/N2 (20mL/min) at 600oC for 60min. The samples were then reoxidized using air (20mL/min) for 30min. During the reduction and reoxidation reaction period, an inert period (40mL/min of nitrogen) of about 10min was inserted to prevent the mixing between propane and air. One redox cycle was thus completed. Afterward, the second reaction cycle was started by switching between propane and air flows."

[4] "In situ DRIFTS spectra of temperature-programmed and isothermal propane dehydrogenation over ceria-vanadia (6V/30CeAl) (d) and vanadia (6V/Al) (e, f). g The calculated ratios of H2/H2O during the C3H8 transient pulses at 600oC."

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes several in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts, including:

- In situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) to probe oxidation state changes during catalysis.

- In situ Raman spectroscopy to track evolution of lattice oxygen species. 

- In situ XRD to monitor phase changes during redox cycling.

- In situ DRIFTS to identify reaction intermediates during propane dehydrogenation.

These techniques provide insights into catalyst redox behavior, oxygen speciation, and reaction mechanisms.

[1] "Atom-resolved high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) images identified vanadia mainly existed as monolayers and bilayers along ceria surface (Fig. 1bd). Electron energy loss spectra (EELS) mappings of V L2,3 and Ce M4,5 edges affirmed vanadia sites anchored on widespread ceria nanodomains (Fig. 1eh). The well-defined core-shell structure was further validated by line-scanning EELS that crossed an individual particle, wherein the outer shell was 1nm, corresponding to roughly two to three atomic vanadia layers (Fig. 1i)."
