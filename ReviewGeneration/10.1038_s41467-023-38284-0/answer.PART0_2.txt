1. The article states that propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrially important process for producing propylene, which is a valuable chemical feedstock with many applications. It provides context that PDH is an alternative to oil-based cracking processes.

2. The article explains that catalysts like vanadium oxide lower activation barriers in propane dehydrogenation by providing active sites that can activate the C-H bonds in propane. It introduces core-shell catalyst designs that combine a dehydrogenation catalyst like vanadia with an oxygen carrier like ceria in close contact to modulate lattice oxygen diffusion and surface reactions.

3. The article does not provide details about different catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation.

4. The article does not provide specific details about the thermodynamics or kinetics of propane dehydrogenation. 

5. The article does not describe the application of DFT calculations to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation.

7. The article does not identify catalyst descriptors or structure-activity relationships for propane dehydrogenation performance.
