<quotes>
[1] "Ge partially covers the surface of Pt, reducing the number of available surface Pt sites for CO adsorption. Moreover, because of the electron transfer from Pt to Ge due to alloy formation [23], the CO coverage on the surface of Pt is also decreased because of the existence of electron deficient Pt atoms."

[2] "In the case of bimetallic Pt-Ge samples, Ca effect is less clear since Ge acts in an opposite manner withdrawing electrons [21]."

[3] "This decrease of activity upon Ca addition is most likely related to a higher degree of surface Pt-Ge alloy due to the increase of the extent of Ge reduction, as clearly shown by XPS and TPR results."

[4] "Few studies have reported an increase of activation energy upon adding promoters such as Zn and In to Pt [48], [49]. Wegener et al., reported that increasing indium loading in Pt-In catalysts leads to an increase of the activation energy due to geometric changes in the Pt ensembles at high promotor loadings [49]."

[5] "Therefore, the higher activation energy for the promoted sample can be related to the enhanced reduction of GeOx species boosted by Ca as discussed in Section 3.1.4, resulting in higher degree of alloy formation between Pt and Ge."

3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Ge in the Pt-Ge bimetallic catalysts. It shows that Ge covers Pt surface sites, reducing available sites for CO adsorption (geometric effect). Ge also withdraws electrons from Pt, decreasing CO coverage on Pt due to electron deficient Pt atoms (electronic effect). Ca promotion enhances GeOx reduction, increasing Pt-Ge alloy formation and modifying Pt ensemble geometry and electronics. This increases the activation energy, indicating decreased activity but enhanced selectivity.

3. 答:是的,该文探讨了副金属Ge在Pt-Ge双金属催化剂中的电子和几何效应。它表明Ge覆盖了Pt表面位点,减少了CO吸附的可用位点(几何效应)。 Ge还从Pt中提取电子,由于Pt原子缺电子,Pt上的CO覆盖率降低(电子效应)。 Ca促进剂增强了GeOx的还原,增加了Pt-Ge合金的形成,并改变了Pt配合物的几何形状和电子性质。这增加了活化能,表明活性降低但选择性增强。

4. Answer: No, the article does not explore the use of subsurface promoters like Re or Mn in bimetallic and alloy catalysts to tune selectivity. It only studies the effects of Ca as a support modifier, not as a subsurface promoter.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
4. 答:没有,该文没有探讨在双金属和合金催化剂中使用Re或Mn等浸渍促进剂来调节选择性。它仅研究Ca作为支持修饰剂的影响,而不是作为浸渍促进剂的影响。

7. Answer: No, the article does not investigate the effects of tuning zeolite Si/Al ratio or incorporating mesoporosity on propane dehydrogenation catalyst performance, since it does not study zeolite-based catalysts.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
7. 答:没有,该文没有研究调节分子筛Si/Al比或引入介孔性对丙烷脱氢催化剂性能的影响,因为它没有研究基于分子筛的催化剂。
