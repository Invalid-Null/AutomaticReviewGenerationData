<quotes>

[1] Pt supported on Al2O3 is one of the most widely used commercial catalysts for this reaction due to its high activity for CH bond cleavage.

[2] Supported metal particles for this purpose, rare earth metals, alkali and alkaline earth metals have been commonly used, resulting in the suppression of detrimental side reactions and better catalytic performance. 

[3] The CH bond activation involving two active sites was considered as the rate determining step of the main reaction.

<quotes>

[1] Propane dehydrogenation for the production of propylene has many advantages over traditional routes, such as lower cost due to huge availability of cheap light alkane feedstock from shale gas and less harmful to the environment due to less CO2 emission. 

[2] Catalyst deactivation by coke formation is still a major challenge. Coke formation generally occurs as a result of side reactions during propane dehydrogenation reaction, such as hydrogenolysis and cracking, as well as isomerization.

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article discusses some thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. It states that propane dehydrogenation has advantages over traditional routes due to abundant, cheap feedstock and lower CO2 emissions. However, catalyst deactivation by coke formation from side reactions like cracking remains a major challenge.
