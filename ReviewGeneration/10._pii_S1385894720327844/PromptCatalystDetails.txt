Abstract
The promoting effect of Ca on the catalytic performance of Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction was studied using experimental methods and kinetic modeling. Different characterization techniques including H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, C3H6-TPD, XPS, BET, CO-chemisorption, CO-DRIFT, and TGA were used to unravel the properties of catalysts. Enhanced propylene selectivity (98.5% Vs 96.4% @ 600 °C and 24 h TOS) and catalyst stability were achieved due to the decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 along with an increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca. The experimental data of propane conversion vs. time were successfully fitted with the Deactivation Model with Residual Activity (DMRA), allowing for the calculation of the intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters for both catalysts. For the Ca-promoted catalyst, a deactivation function of 0.05 h−1 along with a residual activity of 0.82 at 600 °C were obtained. Whereas, for the non-promoted sample, these values were 0.22 h−1 and 0.63, respectively. The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO catalyst was slightly higher than that of the unmodified one (74.8 kJ/mol vs. 66.4 kJ/mol) due to the enhanced reduction of the GeOx species on this sample, which enhanced the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst. However, the higher resistance against the deactivation by coke of the promoted catalyst was invoked to explain the better performance of this catalyst in terms both of activity and selectivity at steady state conditions.

1. Introduction
Propane dehydrogenation for the production of propylene has many advantages over traditional routes [1], such as lower cost due to huge availability of cheap light alkane feedstock from shale gas and less harmful to the environment due to less CO2 emission [2]. Supported Pt on Al2O3 is one of the most widely used commercial catalysts for this reaction due to its high activity for C–H bond cleavage [3]. However, catalyst deactivation by coke formation is still a major challenge [4], [5]. Coke formation generally occurs as a result of side reactions during propane dehydrogenation reaction, such as hydrogenolysis and cracking, as well as isomerization [6]. The geometric and electronic properties of Pt can be tailored by adding promotors such as Sn [7], In [8] and Cu [9], resulting in the suppression of detrimental side reactions and better catalytic performance. Besides of the active metal, the catalyst support also plays a vital role in this reaction. Support properties, including surface area, structure, as well as acid-base properties, have substantial effects on the metal support interaction, the dispersion of the active component, and in modulating geometric and electronic properties of Pt, significantly affecting the catalytic performance [10], [11], [12]. In addition, the support properties can also be significantly modified by incorporating metals. For this purpose, rare earth metals, alkali and alkaline earth metals have been commonly used [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Bai et al. used a Ca-modified ZSM-5 as support for a bimetallic Pt-Sn in PDH reaction [17]. In this work, it was reported that adding an optimal amount of Ca modifies the properties of both the active metal and the support. Indeed, Ca suppresses strong acidic sites of ZSM-5 and accelerates Sn reduction, resulting in a high percentage of alloy formation. Long et al. reported that small amount of yttrium does not have much effect on γ-Al2O3 structure, but neutralizes the strong acidic centers of the support, increases the metal dispersion and reduces the particle size, leading to improved selectivity [18]. Several works have applied Ca to modify Al2O3 properties. Choong et al. [16] reported a Ca-modified Al2O3 as support for Ni and Pt metal particles for ethanol steam reforming, resulting in a decrease of acidity, an increase of particle size and a different reaction mechanism. Yu et al. [19] reported a better catalytic performance on a Ca-modified support during dehydrogenation of cyclohexane. Neutralizing strong acidic sites and modifying electronic properties of Pt were some of the positive effects ascribed to Ca, since it suppresses deep dehydrogenation and facilitates coke desorption due to the increased H/C ratio of H-deficient coke. Although Ca has been commonly used to modify properties of Al2O3 support in different reactions, only one work is available in the literature using Ca to modify the Al2O3 support in PDH reaction reported by Long et al. [20]. They used different amount of Ca to modify the Al2O3 support in a tri-metallic Pt-Sn-In catalyst. Three positive effects, attributed to Ca addition, have been invoked in that work: i- decrease in acidity, ii- increase of Pt dispersion, and iii- prevention of sintering of metal particles. However, precise understanding of Ca effects on the deactivation behavior of the catalyst in PDH reaction needs to be explored further. Particularly, kinetic of catalyst deactivation in presence of Ca during PDH reaction is still lacking.
In our previous work, we have reported for the first time a bimetallic Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 catalyst showing outstanding catalytic performance during PDH reaction [21]. However, this catalyst has to be further improved for long Time-On-Stream (TOS). Accordingly, in this contribution, we report the effect of Ca on catalyst deactivation of Pt-Ge samples. Along with a thorough characterization of the bimetallic catalysts, a deactivation model (DMRA) was used to evaluate the effect of Ca on the deactivation behavior during PDH.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
The bimetallic Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 sample, 0.5 wt% Pt loading and 1.5 wt% Ge loading, was synthesized by sequential incipient wetness impregnation method using GeCl4 (Alfa Aesar, >99.9%) and H2PtCl6 (Sigma-Aldrich, ~38% Pt basis) as precursors. First, the supports were impregnated with a solution of GeCl4 in ethanol. Then, an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 was used for the Pt impregnation. After impregnation of each component, the catalyst was dried at 80 °C for 12 h, and calcined at 530 °C for 3 h. For the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO sample, the support was first impregnated with calcium nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99.0) to obtain 0.5 wt% of Ca loading. After calcination at 800 °C for 8 h, Pt and Ge were impregnated by the same procedure used for Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3. The Al2O3 support used in this study was a commercial γ-Al2O3 from SASOL.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The surface area and pore size distribution of the catalysts were measured by nitrogen sorption technique using a Micromeritic ASAP 2420 apparatus. The samples were degassed at 200 °C for 12 h under vacuum, and then the N2 physisorption was performed at 77 K. Metal dispersion, metal active surface area, and particle size were obtained in a micrometrics ASAP 2020 apparatus using CO-chemisorption. 50 mg sample was loaded in the apparatus and reduced under flowing hydrogen at 600 °C for 1.5 h. After reduction, the sample was flushed with He, evacuated at 350 °C for 0.5 h, and cooled down to 35 °C for analysis. Pt/CO adsorption stoichiometry was assumed as 1:1 and the nominal loading of Pt was used in the calculations.
A TPDRO 1100 apparatus with a thermal conductivity detector was used for temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis. 100 mg of the sample was degassed at 150 °C prior to analysis under argon. Then, TPR analysis was carried out under a 5 %H2/95%Ar mixture (50 ml/min) from room temperature to 900 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer equipped with a Mg anode (Mg Kα = 1253.7 eV). Prior to analysis, the samples were reduced ex-situ at 600 °C with a 40% H2/60% N2 mixture (50 ml/min) for 1.5 h. After reduction, the samples were loaded into the XPS holder under inert gas protection and transferred to the XPS pre-chamber, where the samples were evacuated for 2 h. The binding energies were corrected using the C1s binding energy at 284.8 eV as reference.
Acid properties of the samples were determined using NH3-TPD. Around 100 mg of the sample was treated at 50 °C under Ar for 10 min. Temperature was ramped up to 600 °C under flowing 5% H2/Ar (50 ml/min) for in-situ reduction and kept at this temperature for 1.5 h. After decreasing the temperature to 100 °C, the samples were saturated with 10% NH3 in He (50 ml/min) for 1 h. Finally, the saturated samples were flushed with He for 1 h (50 ml/min) and the TPD profiles were recorded from 100 °C to 900 °C under He (50 ml/min) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. A Gaussian fitting was used to deconvolute the desorption spectra.
Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was carried out using a Frontier MIR (PerkinElmer) equipped with a mercury − cadmium − telluride (MCT) detector. The catalysts were placed into a DRIFTS cell fitted with ZnSe windows and reduced under flowing 10% H2/He for 1 h at 600 °C (50 ml/min). After background collection under helium at 25 °C, catalysts were saturated with either 2% CO/He or 5% C3H6/He for 0.5 h. Subsequently, the samples were flushed with He to remove physically adsorbed CO or C3H6 and the spectra were recorded under He.
DRIFTS was also applied to study the types of hydroxyl groups on the support. KBr spectra was used as background. All spectra were collected at 25 °C after treating the samples under helium at 350 °C for 1 h.
C3H6-TPD was carried out to further investigate propylene adsorption on the catalyst surface. First, 50 mg of the catalyst was loaded in a quartz reactor and reduced at 600 °C during 1.5 h under flowing 20% H2/N2. After cooling down to 50 °C, the sample was saturated with 5% C3H6/N2 (50 ml/min, 0.5 h) and then purged with N2 for 0.5 h (20 ml/min). Then temperature was ramped up from 50 °C to 450 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C and desorption profiles were recorded using a mass spectrometer.
The amount of carbon deposited on the spent catalysis was determined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA Q500 V6.7 Build 203). First, the samples were pretreated under N2 at 80 °C for 0.5 h and then the weight change was recorded under a 40% Air/N2 mixture (100 ml/min) with a heating rate of 5 °C/min.
2.3. Activity test
The catalytic tests were carried out in a fixed-bed quartz tube reactor (5 mm inner diameter) at atmospheric pressure. 50 mg of the catalyst was packed in the reactor, heated up to 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C in N2 and kept at this temperature for 1.5 h under flowing 20% H2/N2 to reduce the catalyst. A mixture of C3H8/H2/N2/Ar with 2:1:16.78:0.22 ratios (100 ml/min) was used as reactants. Products from the reactor outlet were analyzed using a GC (Shimadzu 2014) equipped with a FID to quantify hydrocarbons (Column: GS-GASPRO 30 m, 32 mm) and a TCD for hydrogen detection (Column: HayeSep D). Argon was used as internal standard and the calculations were carried out with the following equations:
where, ni is the number of carbon atom and Fi is the hydrocarbon flow rate (L/min).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the catalysts
3.1.1. Physical properties of the catalysts
Physical properties of the support and the catalysts after reduction at 600 °C are presented in Table 1. The BET surface area and the pore volume of the samples only slightly decrease due to the low loadings of Pt, Ge and Ca.

According to the CO chemisorption presented in Table 1, Pt dispersion in both monometallic and bimetallic samples is not affected by the presence of Ca in the support, although the enhancement of the metal dispersion upon adding Ca has been reported for Pt [20] and other metals such as Co and Pd [22]. On the contrary, CO chemisorption results indicate a slight decrease in Pt dispersion upon adding Ge. This is attributed to the geometric and electronic modification of Pt by Ge. Ge partially covers the surface of Pt, reducing the number of available surface Pt sites for CO adsorption. Moreover, because of the electron transfer from Pt to Ge due to alloy formation [23], the CO coverage on the surface of Pt is also decreased because of the existence of electron deficient Pt atoms. As it will be discussed later, the addition of Ca enhances the reducibility of GeOx species, resulting in an increase of the extent of both electronic and geometric effects and, therefore, a decrease in dispersion [17]. Indeed, the metal surface area decreases 14% after adding Ge to Pt/Al2O3, while the decrease is 26% on the Pt-Ge/Al2O3-CaO sample.
3.1.2. Acid properties of the catalysts
DRIFT spectra of the bare and Ca-modified Al2O3 were recorded to characterize the acid properties of these two supports and the results are depicted in Fig. 1. Three bands, located at 3738 cm−1, 3681 cm−1, and 3450–3600 cm−1, can be observed in the DRIFT spectra. According to pioneer works, the band centered at 3681 cm−1 is related to type III hydroxyls with three octahedrally coordinated Al3+ ions [24]. This type of hydroxyls exhibits acid properties and these hydroxyls are almost negligible on Al2O3-CaO sample, suggesting the positive role of Ca in suppressing strong acid centers and reducing the density of acid sites. The band at higher wavenumber, centered at 3738 cm−1, is assigned to type IIa hydroxyls [16]. This band, which appears in the spectra of both samples, has an acidity between type III hydroxyls and neutral hydroxyls. Neutral hydroxyls, called IIb, form a bridge between two octahedrally coordinated Al3+ ions and appear at higher wavenumbers (3750 cm−1) [24]. However, these types of hydroxyls group are not observed in the spectra of the supports used in this work. The band related to hydrogen-bonded hydroxyls appears in the range of 3450–3600 cm−1. Since this band is a bit broader for the Ca-modified support, it suggests that hydrogen-bonded hydroxyls predominate on Al2O3-CaO support [25].

NH3-TPD was carried out on the synthesized samples to further investigate the effect of Ca on the acid properties of the resulting catalysts and the results are summarized in Fig. 2 and Table 2. In general, there are three peaks in the NH3-TPD profiles of all samples. The first peak, with a maximum centered at 180 °C, corresponds to weak acid centers. The second peak at around 250 °C is related to medium acid centers, and the high temperature peak at around 350 °C is ascribed to strong acid sites [11], [26]. Clearly, the fraction of strong acid sites to weak + medium acid centers decreases with the addition of Ca to the Al2O3 support. The amount of adsorbed ammonia for Pt0.5/Al2O3, Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3, Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO are 497.9 µ mol/g, 488.0 µ mol/g, and 189.8 µ mol/g, respectively. Hence, adding Ge to the support does not significantly change the amount of adsorbed NH3. As expected, the addition small amount of Ca significantly decreases the amount of adsorbed ammonia, showing a sharp decrease of the total acidity.

3.1.3. TPR characterization
H2-TPR was used to study the reducibility of the samples (Fig. 3). After deconvolution of the peaks, three peaks are observed in the TPR profiles of the samples as shown in Fig. 3 (a). The peak at lower temperature is ascribed to the reduction of Pt oxide species, while the two others, appearing at higher temperatures, are related to the reduction of germanium oxide species [21]. After adding 0.5% Ca to the support, the reduction profile marginally changes. The first peak shifts slightly to lower reduction temperature along with an increase of intensity. This may be ascribed to a weaker support-metal interaction induced by Ca. A slight shift towards lower temperature of the reduction peaks ascribed to Ge reduction suggests that Ca also promotes the reduction of Ge species. This effect is more obvious in Fig. 3 (b) for the monometallic Ge sample. Hence, Ca helps the reduction of both Pt and Ge species. It is worthwhile mentioning that there is an optimal amount of Ca for the effective modification of the Al2O3 support [20]. When increasing the Ca content beyond that level (0.5% in this work), the strength of the Pt-support interaction will be reduced too much, while the strength of the Pt-Ca interaction will be enhanced, being unfavorable for the reduction of Pt and its catalytic performance [27].

3.1.4. XPS characterization
The reducibility of the Ge species was also investigated using XPS. For this purpose, the deconvoluted spectra of Ge 3d for both samples are compared in Fig. 4. The Ge 3d spectra can be deconvoluted into two peaks located at 30.35 eV and 31.50 eV, which are ascribed to Ge in metallic state and GeOx species, respectively (Fig. 4) [28]. From the semi-quantitative analysis of XPS data reported in Table 3, the percentage of metallic Ge compared to GeOx species is higher in the Ca-modified sample, also pointing out that Ca accelerates the reduction of GeOx species, most probably due to a decrease of the interaction between GeOx species and the support. This is good agreement with the TPR results for both Pt-Ge and Ge samples on bare and Ca-modified Al2O3 depicted in Fig. 3 (a) and (b), respectively.

3.1.5. DRIFT study of adsorbed CO
IR spectroscopy using CO as probe molecule was used to further investigate electronic properties of Pt atoms and the results are depicted in Fig. 5. Monometallic Pt0.5/Al2O3 sample has two band located at 2000–2100 cm−1 and 1834 cm−1, assigned to linear and bridge bonded CO, respectively [10]. The first band can be deconvoluted into three different bands located at 2080 cm−1, 2063 cm−1, and 2039 cm−1. Haneda et al. studied a Pt0.5/Al2O3 sample with different metal dispersions using CO-DRIFT and reported three different bands at 2095 cm−1, 2070 cm−1, and 2045 cm−1, respectively [29]. These bands were ascribed to linearly adsorbed CO on faces, corners and edges of Pt atoms, respectively. Greenler et al. studied extended-crystal surface of Pt in Pt/SiO2 catalysts by IR spectroscopy using CO as probe molecule [20]. They also reported three IR bands located at 2081 cm−1, 2070 cm−1 and 2063 cm−1 also related to linearly adsorbed CO on faces, corners and edges of Pt atoms. Accordingly, as reported in literature, the bands at 2095 cm−1, 2070 cm−1, and 2045 cm−1 of Pt0.5/Al2O3 can be assigned to faces, corners and edges of Pt atoms, respectively.

In the Ca-modified support, there is a downshift of peaks to lower wavenumbers. It was widely reported that a higher electron density increases the back-donation into the Π* orbital of CO, resulting in a lower CO frequency of the C-O bond of adsorbed CO [5]. This indicates that Ca has modified the electronic state of Pt, leading to electron-rich Pt. As a result, the back donation is increased in the Ca-modified sample and ν (CO) frequency is decreased. In the case of bimetallic Pt-Ge samples, Ca effect is less clear since Ge acts in an opposite manner withdrawing electrons [21]. Yu et al. observed the same Ca effect on monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts [19]. For both monometallic catalysts, Pt0.5/Al2O3 and Pt0.5/Al2O3-CaO, low and high frequency bands related to linear and bridge-bonded CO are observed, suggesting that Ca addition does not lead to a geometric effect. On the contrary, upon adding Ge, the broad low frequency band related to bridge-bonded CO disappears. This is a clear evidence of the existence of geometric effects produced by Ge on Pt. In fact, Ge dilutes the surface of Pt by alloy formation, resulting in the disappearance of the low frequency band [30].
3.1.6. C3H6-TPd
C3H6-TPD was used to study the effect of Ge and Ca on propylene adsorption on the Pt surface. Two peaks are observed in the TPD profiles shown in Fig. 6. The one at lower temperature is ascribed to weakly adsorbed C3H6 whereas the one at higher temperature is related to strongly adsorbed C3H6 on the Pt surface [11]. Upon modifying support with Ca, the desorption temperatures shift to lower temperature, suggesting that Ca addition facilitates propylene desorption. Π* and di-σ propylene orbitals transfer electrons to the empty d-orbitals of Pt, forming a bond with the metal surface [31]. As shown from CO-DRIFT data in Fig. 5 and in well agreement with literature [19], Ca donates electron to Pt, resulting in a weaker interaction between Pt and propylene. This clearly explains the lower propylene adsorption on the Pt surface on Pt0.5/Al2O3-CaO sample. Upon adding Ge, desorption temperature shifts even further to lower temperatures, showing a lower propylene up-take than the monometallic samples. This can be explained invoking a facile propylene desorption due to the strong interaction between Pt and Ge, which results in a geometric effect by forming intermetallic compounds [23]. According to literature, the addition of promoters can facilitate propylene desorption in Pt– Cu/Al2O3 and Pt3Mn/SiO2 catalysts due to formation of both alloys and intermetallic compounds [5], [32]. Indeed, desorption peaks of Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO appears at lower temperature than in the case of Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3, due to a higher degree of Pt-Ge alloying.

The facile desorption of propylene on the bimetallic samples in comparison with the monometallic ones may result in a higher propylene selectivity by decreasing the probability of unwanted side reactions such as cracking to lighter hydrocarbons, coke formation, and deep dehydrogenation of propylene [11]. This will be further discussed in the next sections.
3.2. Catalytic performance
Catalytic performance at different temperatures of the bimetallic Pt-Ge catalysts supported on Al2O3 and Ca-modified Al2O3 are depicted in Fig. 7. Catalytic tests were carried out at low conversion (X (%) < 20%) to ensure differential reactor conditions.

As shown in Fig. 7, Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 exhibits higher initial conversion than the sample on Ca-modified Al2O3 at all temperatures. This higher initial conversion on the bare Al2O3 support could be ascribed to an electronic effect from Ca modification. Indeed, it has been reported that Ca can increase the electronic density of Pt via electron donation, resulting in a decrease of the activity in PDH reaction (Fig. S2) [33]. Such electronic effect is clearly observed on our monometallic Pt samples using CO-DRIFT as previously discussed. However, this electronic effect is not observed on the bimetallic Pt-Ge samples. Therefore, the higher activity of the non-promoted sample reflects the electronic state of Pt and Ge, suggesting the increase of coordinatively unsaturated Pt sites, which exhibit high activity towards cracking. This decrease of activity upon Ca addition is most likely related to a higher degree of surface Pt-Ge alloy due to the increase of the extent of Ge reduction, as clearly shown by XPS and TPR results.
While Ca addition decreases the initial activity, it enhances both selectivity and stability as clearly shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b). The increase in both selectivity and stability can be linked to the decrease of side reactions such as cracking and hydrogenolysis, which can be promoted by the strong acid centers of support as well as by unsaturated metal sites [34].
TGA analysis was used to study the nature of deposited carbon on the surface of the samples after reaction at 600 °C and the results are depicted in Fig. 8. There are two peaks located at around 400 °C and 500 °C in the TGA profile of Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3. These peaks can be ascribed to the burning of deposited coke on the metal sites and on the support, respectively [5]. Interestingly, upon modifying the support with CaO, these two peaks have almost disappeared. The disappearance of the first peak, which is related to the coke species on the metal sites, supports the further reduction of GeOx species in the Ca-promoted-sample, enhancing the geometric modification of Pt and, therefore, reducing its ability for cracking and coke formation. The fading of the second peak clearly highlights the positive role of Ca in suppressing acidic centres. Indeed, as previously discussed, NH3-TPD data reported in Fig. 2 and Table 2 clearly indicate that the sample on bare Al2O3 possesses higher density of total acid sites along with stronger acid sites. It is also well-known that strong acid sites promote catalyst deactivation by coke deposition [35], which explains the disappearance of second peak on the Ca-promoted sample. The effect of Ca and the extent of Pt-Ge interaction on the catalytic performance will be further investigated using kinetic modeling.

3.3. Modeling of catalyst deactivation
Different kinetic models have been developed to evaluate the deactivation patterns of supported metal catalysis in several reactions [36], [37], [38]. The so-called “Levenspiel’s Deactivation Kinetic Model” (LDKM) can be used for predicting deactivation behavior of catalysts at a constant temperature when the activity decreases reaching a very low value, eventually zero [38]. Therefore this model does not consider when the catalyst shows a certain level of residual activity, indicating that it is not completely deactivated [38], [39]. This residual activity usually depends on the reaction conditions, mainly reaction temperature and fed composition. The existence of such residual activity at steady state conditions depends on the deactivation mechanism and has been attributed to reversible coke deposition, reversible poisoning and the existence of several types of active sites with different resistance against deactivation [40]. Thus, a proper kinetic model for predicting the deactivation behavior of the catalyst should be used. In the reaction data presented in the present work, the catalyst does not completely deactivate and the activity reaches a steady state level. Therefore the “Deactivation Model with Residual Activity” (DMRA) is a suitable kinetic model for this case, which has already been used in some other reactions successfully [38]. In the present case, since hydrogen is co-fed into the reactor, the carbon deposition on the catalyst can be partially regenerated by hydrogen. Most likely, this partial regeneration is the reason for the residual activity of the catalyst.
3.3.1. Deactivation model with residual activity (DMRA).
For an isothermal differential reactor operation, the catalyst activity can be defined in terms of the initial propane conversion as follows [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]:
(1)
When deactivation phenomenon takes place by a deactivation-regeneration process during reversible coke formation, the rate of deactivation can be expressed as a balance between the events of deactivation and intrinsic regeneration that occurs on the catalyst surface [42]. Thus, the net deactivation rate can be expressed as follows:
(2)
Where the terms ψd and ψr, correspond to the so-called “kinetic functions of deactivation and regeneration”, respectively. For a given catalyst, these kinetic functions depend on the operating conditions [40]. The values of the deactivation kinetic orders, d and dm, depend on the mechanism of the deactivation-regeneration process, being defined as [43]:
(3)
In these equations, m and h denote the number of active sites involved in the controlling step of the main reaction and the deactivation process, respectively [43]. For given values of m and h, the residual or steady-state activity, aS, depends only on the kinetic functions of deactivation and regeneration, ψd and ψr, and it can be calculated as the positive root of the following condition:
(4)
Therefore, according to this model, the residual activity depends on the operating conditions during the reaction.
In the present study, this residual activity can be experimentally evaluated considering the steady state value of the propane conversion, (XP)S, attained along the TOS:
(5)
In agreement with the considerations from Vannice [44], the actual possibility of obtaining very high reaction orders (i.e. > 2) is very low because the probability of the interaction of three surface intermediates to form a single transition state during the rate determinant step (RDS) is very low. Therefore, on the analytical solution of the equation (2), we have only considered the following four cases: a) m = 1, h = 1, i.e. d = 1 and dm = 0; b) m = 2, h = 1, i.e. d = 1 and dm = 1/2; c) m = 1, h = 2, i.e. d = 2 and dm = 0 and d) m = 2, h = 2, i.e. d = 3/2 and dm = 1/2. In SI, Table S3 summarizes all cases considered.
Although all cases provide good fittings with similar statistical results, the case 1b (m = 2, h = 1; i.e. d = 1 and dm = 1/2) generates the best fittings of the evolution of propane conversion along the TOS. The rest of the cases, along with the fittings and the overall statistical information, are reported in SI (Section 6).
Thus, the deactivation rate for the selected case, eqn. (2) is simplified to:
(6)
where the residual activity can be calculated as:
(7)
Finally, the explicit relationship of propane conversion vs. time is given by:
(8)
Regarding the reaction mechanism, it must be considered that the reaction conditions used in this work are close to the ones reported in previous works on the reaction mechanism of PDH [45], [46]. In those models, the C–H bond activation involving two active sites was considered as the rate determining step of the main reaction [45], [46]. Therefore, assuming a number of active sites involved in the controlling step of the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation (m) equal to two is indeed supported by pervious mechanistic studies. In addition, here we have assumed that catalyst deactivation involves only one active site (h = 1). The fitting results are summarized in Table 4 and for the rest of the cases, the fitting results are reported in the SI (Section 6).

As expected, all the kinetic parameters, including the initial propane conversion, increase with temperature, highlighting the faster deactivation obtained at higher temperatures. The initial propane conversion, (XP)0, of the non-promoted catalyst is higher in all the cases than that of the promoted catalyst. However, since the deactivation of the Ca-promoted catalyst due to coke formation is less severe, as clearly indicated by the lower values of the parameter ψd, the steady state conversion, (XP)S, becomes higher than that of the catalyst without Ca. In addition, for both catalysts, the residual activity decreases with temperature, being higher for the promoted catalyst. This indicates that the value of the residual activity is not determined by the properties of the catalyst, but by the operating conditions.
The apparent activation energies of all parameters are estimated from the Arrhenius plots depicted in Fig. 8. A satisfactory linear correlation can be observed for each parameter, showing that the Arrhenius law is valid in the interval of operation conditions used in this work. The activation energies of DMRA kinetic parameters from the Arrhenius plots are summarized in Table 5.

As shown in Fig. 9(b), the apparent activation energies of propane dehydrogenation are 74.8 kJ/mol for Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO and 66.4 kJ/mol for Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3, respectively. These values of the activation energy are in line with the reported ones for PDH reaction, 40–120 kJ/mol, in literature [33], [47]. The higher activation energy for the promoted sample can be related to the enhanced reduction of GeOx species boosted by Ca as discussed in Section 3.1.4, resulting in higher degree of alloy formation between Pt and Ge. Few studies have reported an increase of activation energy upon adding promotors such as Zn and In to Pt [48], [49]. Wegener et al., reported that increasing indium loading in Pt-In catalysts leads to an increase of the activation energy due to geometric changes in the Pt ensembles at high promotor loadings [49]. Pt nanoparticles are active in PDH reaction due to the availability of enough terrace and step sites, which are able to activate C–C bond. Therefore, the modification of the geometry of Pt nanoparticles, reducing the number of these high energy sites, decreases their activity for C–C bond cleavage [5]. This diminution of activity can be interpreted as an increase of the activation energy. Accordingly, when GeOx is further reduced, it increases the degree of alloy formation, modifying the reactivity of the resulting nanoparticles, decreasing the activity and consequently, increasing the observable activation energy.

Fig. 9. Arrhenius plot of the kinetic parameters: (a) deactivation, ψd, and regeneration, ψr, functions; (b) Initial propane conversion, X0.
The activation energies of deactivation function (ψd) for Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 and Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO are 66.7 kJ/mol and 73.7 kJ/mol, respectively. The higher activation energy of the deactivation function for Ca-modified sample clearly indicates the greater resistance against deactivation induced by the presence of Ca on the catalyst surface. In a parallel trend, the values of the kinetic regeneration function, ψr, are also higher for the promoted catalyst. According to the basic assumption of the kinetic model, the coke formation is a reversible phenomenon during the PDH reaction and some of the fouled sites by coke can be partially regenerated by the reaction of coke with hydrogen [50]. This fact highlights the advantage of adding hydrogen during the operation in order to control the accumulation of coke to improve the stability of the catalyst [2].
Therefore, the kinetic modeling clearly indicates that the Ca-promoted catalyst is less active for the processes involved here, propane dehydrogenation, (XP), coke deactivation, (ψd), and in-situ regeneration (ψr). However, it is important to stress that the intrinsic coke deactivation rate (ψd) is significantly more affected by Ca addition. Indeed, while ψd decreases almost 5 times (ψd-w/o Ca/ψd-w Ca = 4.8), the in-situ regeneration function decreases less than two times (ψr-w/o Ca/ψr-w Ca = 1.8). Hence, the main impact of the presence of Ca is the decrease of the net deactivation rate along with an increase of the steady state activity, resulting in a higher performance and improved stability of the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO catalyst. In addition, Ca also enhances the selectivity towards propylene as discussed previously.
Basically, the deactivation kinetic modeling used in this work, provides a good description of the deactivation process during PDH and, at the same time, the intrinsic parameters estimated for the model allow for a better understanding of the Ca effect on both catalyst performance and deactivation.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have investigated the promoting effect of Ca on a bimetallic Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 catalyst in the PDH reaction. Thorough characterization of fresh and spent catalysts and kinetic modeling were carried out, allowing for the understanding of the improved catalytic performance of the dual promoted catalyst. Ca-modified catalyst shows, higher selectivity (98.5% vs. 96.4% @ 600 °C and 24 h TOS), better stability and lower amount of coke formation. These facts can be explained considering the suppression of the strongest acid sites, which are harmful sites due to their key role to catalyze side reactions conducing to the formation of coke. In the Ca-promoted catalyst, the activity slightly decreases due to the increase of the degree of Ge reduction which enhances the Pt-Ge alloy formation, being less active in the PDH reaction. Experimental data were successfully fitted using a Deactivation Model with Residual Activity (DMRA), which predicts higher residual activity and lower intrinsic deactivation rates for the Ca-modified catalyst. Therefore, the promoted catalyst is less active for all the processes taking place during PDH reaction, propane dehydrogenation, (XP), coke deactivation, (ψd), and in-situ regeneration (ψr). However, the main impact of the presence of Ca is the diminution of the deactivation, resulting in a higher performance of the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO catalyst.
