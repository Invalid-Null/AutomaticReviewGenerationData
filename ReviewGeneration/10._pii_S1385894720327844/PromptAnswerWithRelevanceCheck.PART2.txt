<quotes>
[1] "the addition of Ca enhances the reducibility of GeOx species, resulting in an increase of the extent of both electronic and geometric effects and, therefore, a decrease in dispersion [17]."

[2] "Enhanced propylene selectivity (98.5% Vs 96.4% @ 600 C and 24 h TOS) and catalyst stability were achieved due to the decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 along with an increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca."  

[3] "Calcium increases Pt-Ge alloy extent by enhancing Ge reducibility."

[4] "Calcium significantly enhances catalyst stability and propylene selectivity."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Ge in the Pt-Ge bimetallic catalyst. It shows that adding Ca enhances the reducibility of GeOx species, resulting in increased extent of Pt-Ge alloy formation. This causes both electronic modifications (electron transfer from Pt to Ge) and geometric effects (dilution of Pt surface sites). These electronic and geometric effects help improve propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
3. 答:是的,该文调查了二次金属Ge在Pt-Ge双金属催化剂中的电子和几何效应。它显示添加Ca增强了GeOx物种的可还原性,导致Pt-Ge合金形成的程度增加。这造成了电子修饰(Pt向Ge的电子转移)和几何效应(Pt表面位点的稀释)。这些电子和几何效应有助于提高丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

5. Answer: Yes, the article describes synergistic effects between metals Pt and Ge attributed to ensemble and ligand effects. It shows that adding Ca enhances reducibility of GeOx, increasing Pt-Ge alloy formation. This causes electronic modifications (electron transfer from Pt to Ge) and geometric effects (dilution of Pt sites) that synergistically improve selectivity and stability. The electronic and geometric effects are attributed to ensemble and ligand effects between Pt and Ge.

<quotes>
[1] "Ge partially covers the surface of Pt, reducing the number of available surface Pt sites for CO adsorption. Moreover, because of the electron transfer from Pt to Ge due to alloy formation [23], the CO coverage on the surface of Pt is also decreased because of the existence of electron deficient Pt atoms."

[2] "In the case of bimetallic Pt-Ge samples, Ca effect is less clear since Ge acts in an opposite manner withdrawing electrons [21]."

[3] "This decrease of activity upon Ca addition is most likely related to a higher degree of surface Pt-Ge alloy due to the increase of the extent of Ge reduction, as clearly shown by XPS and TPR results."

[4] "Few studies have reported an increase of activation energy upon adding promoters such as Zn and In to Pt [48], [49]. Wegener et al., reported that increasing indium loading in Pt-In catalysts leads to an increase of the activation energy due to geometric changes in the Pt ensembles at high promotor loadings [49]."

[5] "Therefore, the higher activation energy for the promoted sample can be related to the enhanced reduction of GeOx species boosted by Ca as discussed in Section 3.1.4, resulting in higher degree of alloy formation between Pt and Ge."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Ge in the Pt-Ge bimetallic catalysts. It shows that Ge covers Pt surface sites, reducing available sites for CO adsorption (geometric effect). Ge also withdraws electrons from Pt, decreasing CO coverage on Pt due to electron deficient Pt atoms (electronic effect). Ca promotion enhances GeOx reduction, increasing Pt-Ge alloy formation and modifying Pt ensemble geometry and electronics. This increases the activation energy, indicating decreased activity but enhanced selectivity.

<Chinese version answer>  
3. 答:是的,该文探讨了副金属Ge在Pt-Ge双金属催化剂中的电子和几何效应。它表明Ge覆盖了Pt表面位点,减少了CO吸附的可用位点(几何效应)。 Ge还从Pt中提取电子,由于Pt原子缺电子,Pt上的CO覆盖率降低(电子效应)。 Ca促进剂增强了GeOx的还原,增加了Pt-Ge合金的形成,并改变了Pt配合物的几何形状和电子性质。这增加了活化能,表明活性降低但选择性增强。
