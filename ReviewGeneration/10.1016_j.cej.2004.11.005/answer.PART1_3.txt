<English version answer>

1. Yes, the article evaluates Cr2O3/Al2O3 as a promising metal oxide catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on propene yields up to 30% using this catalyst in the TZFBR and ICFBR reactors. 

2. No, the article does not investigate tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, etc. of the metal oxides.

3. No, the article does not propose specific mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst.

4. No, the article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects.

5. No, the article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts.
