<Answer>
 <quotes>
[1] "A commercial Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, supplied by Nikki Chemical (N401 AG), was used."

[2] "During last years, our group has studied [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] a new concept of fluidized bed reactors. It aims to exploit the fast solid mixing characteristic of fluidized beds in order to obtain a controlled solid flow between two-zones"

[3] "No results are given with oxygen flow less than 2 ml/s because in those experiments the catalyst becomes deactivated without achieving a steady-state."

[4] "Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is able to promote combustion [25] then, the hydrocarbon will react with the remaining oxygen to produce COx's and propene selectivity will decrease."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

1. Yes, the article evaluates a commercial Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Data on catalyst performance in terms of conversion, yield, and selectivity is provided.

2. No, the article does not investigate tuning oxidation states or acid-base properties of the catalyst. It focuses on reactor configuration rather than catalyst characterization or optimization.

3. No, the article does not propose mechanistic scenarios or describe specific reaction steps and intermediates. The focus is on reactor testing rather than reaction mechanisms.

4. No, the article does not explore metal-support interactions or provide insights into activity and selectivity modulation. The commercial catalyst composition is not varied.  

5. No, the article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts. Only the commercial Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is tested.

6. No analysis of catalyst particle properties or structure-function relationships is provided. The focus is on testing the commercial catalyst in different reactor configurations.

7. No mechanistic pathways or specific reaction intermediates are described for the catalyst. The focus is on reactor testing rather than elucidating reaction mechanisms.

</English version answer>

4. 不,该文没有探索金属支持体间作用或提供活性和选择性调变的见解。商业催化剂的组成没有改变。

5. 不评价任何支撑单金属催化剂。仅测试商业Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂。  

6. 没有提供催化剂颗粒性质或结构-功能关系的分析。重点是在不同反应器配置中测试商业催化剂。

7. 没有描述该催化剂的机理途径或特定的反应中间体。重点是反应器测试而不是阐明反应机理。
