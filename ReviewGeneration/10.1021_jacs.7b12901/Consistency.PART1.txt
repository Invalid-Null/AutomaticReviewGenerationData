To generate this, I compared each answer file's responses to the correct answers for each question. I calculated a consistency percentage based on lexical similarity between the given answer and correct answer. A consistency of 100% indicates the given answer conveys the same meaning as the correct answer, while 0% indicates completely inconsistent meaning.
