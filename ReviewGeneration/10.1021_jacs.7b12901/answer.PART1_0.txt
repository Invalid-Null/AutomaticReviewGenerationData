<quotes>

[1] "The increasing availability of propane from shale gas together with the worldwide increase in propene demand has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propene via dehydrogenation."

[2] "Gallium modified H-ZSM-5 has been used commercially for the aromatization of light alkanes." 

[3] "Especially, the combination of Brønsted and Lewis acids in the zeolite micropore channels was observed to be active for propane dehydrogenation."

[4] "However, the nature of the active sites in these Ga exchanged zeolites catalysts and the mechanism of dehydrogenation is still discussed controversially."

[5] "While the present contribution will not address comprehensively the aspects to resolve all open points, a homotopic catalyst with unprecedented activity for dehydration is reported."

5. The article evaluates gallium-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing high propane dehydrogenation activity for Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, especially at a Ga/Al ratio of 1/2. The article investigates the nature of active sites, proposing Lewis acid-Brønsted acid pairs as the active sites. Mechanistic scenarios involving bifunctional cooperation between the Ga cation and proximate Brønsted acid site are explored using kinetics, spectroscopy, and DFT calculations.

[1] "The concentration of acid sites was determined by IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine after reduction in H2." 

[2] "In line with these observations, the Brønsted acid site concentration decreased only to a small extent for Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts without in situ reduction; with 1/2 Ga/Al-ZSM-5 20% of the BAS were converted to LAS, for 3/2 Ga/Al the fraction increased to 25%."

[3] "The presence of three different types of acid sites was shown by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine. One type of Brønsted acid sites and two types of Lewis acid sites with bands at 1555 cm−1 (protonated pyridinium ion, BAS) as well as 1457 and 1446 cm−1 (coordinatively adsorbed pyridine, Ga+ and GaxOy) respectively, were distinguished." 

[4] "The Brønsted acid site concentration after in situ reduction decreased linearly with increasing Ga concentration (Figure 2). The direct compensation of the decrease in the concentration of BAS by Ga sites (for catalysts with Ga/Al ≥ 1) strongly suggests the exchange of the protons of the SiOHAl groups by a monovalent cationic Ga+ species with a stoichiometry of Ga/H+ = 1:1."

[5] "The oxidation state of the cationic Ga species was studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Figure 3). During in situ reduction (temperature raised from 293 to 873 K in H2 flow) of unreduced 1/2 Ga/Al the Ga K-edge shifted from 10374.3 to 10370.2 eV (Figure 3). To assign these shifts to the oxidation state, Ga(III)Cl3 and Ga(I)Ga(III)Cl4 were used as references for Ga3+ (10373.5 eV) and Ga+ (10369.9 eV) species."

<quotes>

[1] "According to the first mechanism, alkanes are dehydrogenated via carbonium ion intermediates or transition states at the Brønsted acid sites and the Lewis acidic Ga species facilitates the recombinative desorption of H2." 

[2] "Alternatively, the alkane CH bond has been proposed to be polarized on Ga2O3, facilitating the formation of carbonium ions on Brønsted acid sites."

[3] "According to the other mechanism, the dehydrogenation proceeds via an initial abstraction of a hydride by a Ga cation or by Ga2O3 generating transiently a carbenium ion." 

[4] "In order to resolve these discrepancies, the synergy of LewisBrønsted acid pairs in a series of well-defined Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolite was examined for the dehydrogenation of propane and butane."

[5] "The DFT calculations indicate that the LewisBrønsted acid site pair carries out alkane dehydrogenation through a bifunctional mechanism in which the Brønsted acid site protonates the Ga+ to form a [GaH]2+, which is a strong Lewis acid."

7. The article proposes and compares multiple mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. These include pathways involving carbonium ion formation on Brønsted acid sites facilitated by Ga species, as well as bifunctional pathways involving hydride abstraction by Ga cations. DFT calculations suggest the bifunctional pathway involving cooperation between Ga+ and proximate Brønsted acid site is most consistent with the observed high activity.
