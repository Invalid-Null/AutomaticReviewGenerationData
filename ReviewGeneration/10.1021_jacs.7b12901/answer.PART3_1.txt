[1] "The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) at the Ga K edge (10368.3 eV) was measured at the Alba Light Source in Barcelona, Spain on beamline BL22-CLAESS."

[2] "Spectra were recorded in fluorescence mode at ambient temperature for references and during in situ reduction, purging and reaction at intervals of ca. 8 min for the catalysts." 

[3] "The catalysts were reduced (1 h, 873 K, 15 K/min) in a stream of H2 (5 mL/min) and purged with helium (5 mL/min) at 873 K for 1/2 h before the reaction was carried out at 873 K with 5 mL/min 5 vol % propane in He."

[4] "During in situ reduction (temperature raised from 293 to 873 K in H2 flow) of unreduced 1/2 Ga/Al the Ga K-edge shifted from 10374.3 to 10370.2 eV (Figure 3)."

[5] "To assign these shifts to the oxidation state, Ga(III)Cl3 and Ga(I)Ga(III)Cl4 were used as references for Ga3+ (10373.5 eV) and Ga+ (10369.9 eV) species."

[6] "Thus, these changes observed in the XANES during in situ reduction suggest a change in the oxidation state of Ga."

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES) to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it examines changes in the Ga K-edge during in-situ reduction and reaction to probe oxidation state changes of Ga species. It finds that the Ga K-edge shifts from 10374.3 eV to 10370.2 eV during reduction, indicative of a change from Ga3+ to Ga+.

4. 是的,该文利用了原位X射线吸收光谱(XANES)来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。具体来说,它检测Ga K边在原位还原和反应过程中的变化,以探究Ga元素的氧化态变化。它发现Ga K边在还原过程中从10374.3eV转移到10370.2eV,表示Ga元素从Ga3+转变为Ga+。
