 Unfortunately, I am unable to provide relevant quotes or answers for any of the questions, as the given literature does not contain information related to the specific topics asked about. The literature focuses on investigating the catalysis mechanism and kinetics of alkane dehydrogenation over zeolite catalysts modified with gallium species, but does not discuss catalyst synthesis methods, use of encapsulation or modifiers to enhance stability, optimization of active phase dispersion, in-situ characterization techniques, advanced microscopy characterization, or evaluation of different reactor types.
