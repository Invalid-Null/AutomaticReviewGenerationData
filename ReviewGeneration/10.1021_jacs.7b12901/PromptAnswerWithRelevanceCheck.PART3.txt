[1] "The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) at the Ga K edge (10368.3 eV) was measured at the Alba Light Source in Barcelona, Spain on beamline BL22-CLAESS."

[2] "Spectra were recorded in fluorescence mode at ambient temperature for references and during in situ reduction, purging and reaction at intervals of ca. 8 min for the catalysts." 

[3] "The catalysts were reduced (1 h, 873 K, 15 K/min) in a stream of H2 (5 mL/min) and purged with helium (5 mL/min) at 873 K for 1/2 h before the reaction was carried out at 873 K with 5 mL/min 5 vol % propane in He."

[4] "During in situ reduction (temperature raised from 293 to 873 K in H2 flow) of unreduced 1/2 Ga/Al the Ga K-edge shifted from 10374.3 to 10370.2 eV (Figure 3)."

[5] "To assign these shifts to the oxidation state, Ga(III)Cl3 and Ga(I)Ga(III)Cl4 were used as references for Ga3+ (10373.5 eV) and Ga+ (10369.9 eV) species."

[6] "Thus, these changes observed in the XANES during in situ reduction suggest a change in the oxidation state of Ga."

 Unfortunately, I am unable to provide relevant quotes or answers for any of the questions, as the given literature does not contain information related to the specific topics asked about. The literature focuses on investigating the catalysis mechanism and kinetics of alkane dehydrogenation over zeolite catalysts modified with gallium species, but does not discuss catalyst synthesis methods, use of encapsulation or modifiers to enhance stability, optimization of active phase dispersion, in-situ characterization techniques, advanced microscopy characterization, or evaluation of different reactor types.
