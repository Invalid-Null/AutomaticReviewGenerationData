<quotes>

[1] "The increasing availability of propane from shale gas together with the worldwide increase in propene demand has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propene via dehydrogenation."

[2] "Gallium modified H-ZSM-5 has been used commercially for the aromatization of light alkanes." 

[3] "Especially, the combination of Brønsted and Lewis acids in the zeolite micropore channels was observed to be active for propane dehydrogenation."

[4] "However, the nature of the active sites in these Ga exchanged zeolites catalysts and the mechanism of dehydrogenation is still discussed controversially."

[5] "While the present contribution will not address comprehensively the aspects to resolve all open points, a homotopic catalyst with unprecedented activity for dehydration is reported."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

5. The article evaluates gallium-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing high propane dehydrogenation activity for Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, especially at a Ga/Al ratio of 1/2. The article investigates the nature of active sites, proposing Lewis acid-Brønsted acid pairs as the active sites. Mechanistic scenarios involving bifunctional cooperation between the Ga cation and proximate Brønsted acid site are explored using kinetics, spectroscopy, and DFT calculations.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

5. 这篇文章评估了氧化镓交换的ZSM-5沸石催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供了数据,显示Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂具有高的丙烷脱氢活性,尤其在Ga/Al比为1/2时。这篇文章研究了活性位点的本质,提出了Lewis酸-Brønsted酸配对作为活性位点。使用动力学、光谱和DFT计算探索了涉及Ga阳离子和相邻Brønsted酸位点双功能协同作用的机理场景。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "The concentration of acid sites was determined by IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine after reduction in H2." 

[2] "In line with these observations, the Brønsted acid site concentration decreased only to a small extent for Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts without in situ reduction; with 1/2 Ga/Al-ZSM-5 20% of the BAS were converted to LAS, for 3/2 Ga/Al the fraction increased to 25%."

[3] "The presence of three different types of acid sites was shown by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine. One type of Brønsted acid sites and two types of Lewis acid sites with bands at 1555 cm−1 (protonated pyridinium ion, BAS) as well as 1457 and 1446 cm−1 (coordinatively adsorbed pyridine, Ga+ and GaxOy) respectively, were distinguished." 

[4] "The Brønsted acid site concentration after in situ reduction decreased linearly with increasing Ga concentration (Figure 2). The direct compensation of the decrease in the concentration of BAS by Ga sites (for catalysts with Ga/Al ≥ 1) strongly suggests the exchange of the protons of the SiOHAl groups by a monovalent cationic Ga+ species with a stoichiometry of Ga/H+ = 1:1."

[5] "The oxidation state of the cationic Ga species was studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Figure 3). During in situ reduction (temperature raised from 293 to 873 K in H2 flow) of unreduced 1/2 Ga/Al the Ga K-edge shifted from 10374.3 to 10370.2 eV (Figure 3). To assign these shifts to the oxidation state, Ga(III)Cl3 and Ga(I)Ga(III)Cl4 were used as references for Ga3+ (10373.5 eV) and Ga+ (10369.9 eV) species."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

6. The article investigates how properties like Ga cation oxidation state, coordination, and concentration affect the performance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Spectroscopic techniques like IR of adsorbed pyridine and XANES are used to characterize the nature of Ga species and their transformation during pretreatment and reaction. Relationships between Ga+/BAS ratio, formation of Ga oxide clusters, and propane dehydrogenation activity are revealed. 

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

6. 这篇文章研究了诸如Ga阳离子氧化态、配位和浓度等性质如何影响Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于丙烷脱氢的性能。使用吸附的吡啶的红外光谱和XANES等光谱技术来表征Ga物种的本质及其在预处理和反应期间的转化。 揭示了Ga+/BAS比、Ga氧化物簇形成和丙烷脱氢活性之间的关系。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "According to the first mechanism, alkanes are dehydrogenated via carbonium ion intermediates or transition states at the Brønsted acid sites and the Lewis acidic Ga species facilitates the recombinative desorption of H2." 

[2] "Alternatively, the alkane CH bond has been proposed to be polarized on Ga2O3, facilitating the formation of carbonium ions on Brønsted acid sites."

[3] "According to the other mechanism, the dehydrogenation proceeds via an initial abstraction of a hydride by a Ga cation or by Ga2O3 generating transiently a carbenium ion." 

[4] "In order to resolve these discrepancies, the synergy of LewisBrønsted acid pairs in a series of well-defined Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolite was examined for the dehydrogenation of propane and butane."

[5] "The DFT calculations indicate that the LewisBrønsted acid site pair carries out alkane dehydrogenation through a bifunctional mechanism in which the Brønsted acid site protonates the Ga+ to form a [GaH]2+, which is a strong Lewis acid."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

7. The article proposes and compares multiple mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. These include pathways involving carbonium ion formation on Brønsted acid sites facilitated by Ga species, as well as bifunctional pathways involving hydride abstraction by Ga cations. DFT calculations suggest the bifunctional pathway involving cooperation between Ga+ and proximate Brønsted acid site is most consistent with the observed high activity.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

7. 这篇文章提出并比较了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂上丙烷脱氢的多种机理场景。这些包括涉及Ga物种促进的Brønsted酸位点上的碳化离子形成的途径,以及涉及Ga阳离子抽取氢化物的双功能途径。 DFT计算表明,Ga+与相邻Brønsted酸位点之间的协同作用的双功能途径与观察到的高活性最符合。

<quotes>

[1] "According to the other mechanism, the dehydrogenation proceeds via an initial abstraction of a hydride by a Ga cation (7) or by Ga2O3 (15) generating transiently a carbenium ion." 

[2] "The highest dehydrogenation rate (2 orders of magnitude higher than the parent H-ZSM-5 and Ga2O3/SiO2 with the same Ga2O3 loading) was observed for a Ga/Al ratio of 1/2, corresponding to a one to one ratio of Ga+ and Brönsted acid sites."

[3] "The DFT calculations indicate that the LewisBrönsted acid site pair carries out alkane dehydrogenation through a bifunctional mechanism in which the Brönsted acid site protonates the Ga+ to form a [GaH]2+, which is a strong Lewis acid."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. The article proposes two mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts studied: 
(1) Dehydrogenation via hydride abstraction by Ga cations or Ga2O3 to form transient carbenium ions. 
(2) A bifunctional mechanism where the Brønsted acid site protonates Ga+ to form [GaH]2+ which activates the C-H bond heterolytically. The calculations support the bifunctional pathway involving both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites.

3. 该文为Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的丙烷脱氢提出了两种机理假设:
