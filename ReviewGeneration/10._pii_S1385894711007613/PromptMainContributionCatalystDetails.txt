AbstractAbstract
The two-dimensional non-isothermal stationary mathematical model of the catalytic membrane reactor for the process of propane dehydrogenation has been developed. The made calculations have shown the higher efficiency of the membrane reactor in comparison with the tubular one which is achieved due to removal of hydrogen from reactionary zone through the membrane to shift the reaction equilibrium towards formation of products. The use of membrane was found to cause the propane conversion increase from 41% to 67%. The highest value of propane conversion (X = 96%) was reached in case of additional oxidation of the removed hydrogen (conjugated dehydrogenation). The maximum value of propylene selectivity S = 98% can be as well reached in case of conjugated dehydrogenation in the membrane reactor at the reaction temperature of 500 °C. The oxidation of hydrogen in conjugated dehydrogenation process gives the increase of propylene yield from 65% (the tubular reactor) to 95%. The maximum propylene yield corresponds to T = 525 °C. It was also established that the gas space velocity in both internal and external parts of the membrane reactor is to be the one of the most important factors defining efficiency of the conjugated dehydrogenation process.

1. Introduction
Olefinic hydrocarbons, such as ethylene, propylene, butene, and isobutene, are critical intermediates in the petrochemical industry. In order to satisfy market demand, substantial efforts have been invested in the production of such compounds by conventional thermal steam cracking of alkanes and naphtha and by catalytic dehydrogenation methods [1]. Conventional catalytic dehydrogenation is equilibrium limited and requires very high temperatures (over 700 °C) to achieve a high enough conversion of propane to be economically viable. In addition, it has such disadvantages as the deactivation of the catalyst by coke formation, and the consequent need for continuous or periodic catalyst regeneration at frequent intervals throughout the process. As a result of these substantial drawbacks, the petroleum industry has sought a solution to the demand for olefinic hydrocarbons in the use of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) methods. ODH uses oxygen to react with the hydrogen released from the hydrocarbon, in situ, so that the aforementioned equilibrium limitation is removed, and high single pass yields can be achieved. The reaction is exothermic overall and does not require a supply of heat as in endothermic dehydrogenation reactions. However it always faces the main problem associated with combustion of principle reaction product. The mentioned alternative reaction pathway limits the selectivity towards propylene, especially at high conversions.
The use of the catalytic membrane reactor (CMR) permits one to combine the advantages of conventional dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation processes. In this case the propane undergoes the dehydrogenation reaction over the catalyst in the tube side. Hydrogen permeates through the membrane to the shell compartment where has been oxidized by oxygen. Selective hydrogen removal through the membrane allows one to shift the reaction equilibrium towards the desired products. Further oxidation of hydrogen in shell side of the reactor leads to the increase of hydrogen amount permeated through the membrane and to additional shift of the reaction equilibrium [2].
The catalytic membrane reactor model and the analysis of reasonability of the suggested approach are presented in this report.
There are significant amount of works devoted to mathematical modeling of different processes in the catalytic membrane reactors. However, in most cases the existing models are not capable to describe in full the diversity of heat- and mass-transfer processes taking place in real reactors. So, for example, one-dimensional mathematical models cannot allow one to study the influence of structural and textural properties of a material of which the membrane reactor is made on key process characteristics, which in whole substantially reduces the reliability and importance of calculations made [3], [4], [5], [6]. Two-dimensional models are known to assume the isothermality of occurring processes that does not allow one to study the effect of released exothermal heat upon the indicators of endothermic process [7], [8], [9]. They also do not take into consideration the diffusion transfer throughout the support [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. The detailed modeling of transport through the multilayered porous support was also described [16]. However, as a rule, in such works there is no complete description of heat and mass transfer processes within both tube and shell sides. Under these circumstances the development of two-dimensional non-isothermal reactor model taking into account the hydrogen flux across the membrane, diffusion and thermal conductivity in the radial direction for tube side and ceramic support is considered as quite actual.
2. Mathematical model
A mathematical model was developed to evaluate the performance of the dehydrogenation of propane in the catalytic membrane reactor. The isothermal mathematical model, presented in [7] was improved by energy balance equations.
Some modifications were used for mass balance equations: variable gas mixture space velocity in the tube and shell sides and the catalytic hydrogen oxidation in the shell side including the equations for the oxygen and water mass transfer.
The configuration of membrane reactor is depicted in Fig. 1. The membrane reactor consists of two concentric tubes, where the interior ceramic tube with catalyst bed is placed in the exterior one. A very thin layer of palladium-silver membrane is deposited as a continuous layer on the outer surface of thermostable ceramic tube.

The developed mathematical model allows one to analyze the concentration profiles of all reactants and products in the reaction mixture in terms of their distribution by the length of reactor as well as by the radius of the membrane reactor which is especially important for estimation of hydrogen diffusion over the support towards membrane. The principle reaction parameters, such as reaction temperature; permeability of an internal tube by hydrogen (the impermeable tube simulates the conventional tubular reactor; the permeable one refers to membrane reactor); the oxidation of the removed hydrogen running in external part of the reactor; space velocities of gas flow in both internal and external parts of the reactor have been varied during the simulation experiments.
5.1. Hydrogen removal through membrane and its oxidation by O2
The hydrogen concentration profiles by length of the reactor in its internal part are presented in Fig. 2. In case of the tubular reactor (permeability of the internal tube = 0) the concentration of hydrogen is well seen to be gradually increasing to reach the equilibrium value at L = 0.05 m. Carrying out the process in the membrane reactor permits to lower the equilibrium value of hydrogen concentration in 3.5 times due to its removal into external part of the reactor. The greatest shift of the dehydrogenation thermodynamic balance towards the reaction products gives an additional oxidation of hydrogen (HOR) removed into external part of the reactor. The hydrogen concentration measured in the reaction zone near the membrane reactor outlet can be thus lowered in 80 times as compared with the tubular reactor.

Oxidation of hydrogen shifts the concentration profile of hydrogen downwards on an axis of ordinates (Fig. 3). It is caused by the oxidation reaction taking place in the external part of the reactor which leads to an increase of diffusion rate of hydrogen through a membrane.

For more evident representation of the efficiency of using the membrane reactor with function of hydrogen oxidation in its external part the profiles of propane conversion curves by the length of reactor are given in Fig. 4. Hydrogen withdrawal through a membrane along with a corresponding shift of reaction balance leads to increase in propane conversion from 41 to 67%. The following oxidation of hydrogen removing through the membrane in addition increases conversion of C3H8 by 29%.

Thus, the membrane reactor where the most fluent hydrogen gas is forced to be removed through a membrane into the oxidizing section is thought to be the most effective way for realization of the propane dehydrogenation process. The described approach is known as so-called “conjugated” dehydrogenation reaction. Decrease of partial hydrogen pressure in the external part of the reactor promotes the enhancement of its diffusion rate through a membrane as mentioned above. At the same time the heat released as a result of hydrogen oxidation reaction allows to compensate partially power expenses for carrying out the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction.
5.2. Effect of space velocity of gas feed
In case of “conjugated” dehydrogenation of propane in the membrane reactor the gas space velocity both in internal, and in external part of the reactor are believed to be the core factor defining efficiency of the given approach as a whole. The increase in space velocity in an internal part from 22 to 66 ml min−1 simultaneously with increase of that one in an external part from 75 to 225 ml min−1 causes the shift of maximum at hydrogen concentration curve (Fig. 5). In addition, such a change in space velocities makes the efficiency of hydrogen removal decrease for an order.

Fig. 5. The hydrogen concentration profiles versus the membrane reactor length.
The increase of gas flow in an internal part of the reactor only leads to appearance of the inflection point at L = 0.08 m that corresponds to a full expenditure of oxygen in external part of the reactor, i.e. termination of oxidation reaction. Efficiency of hydrogen withdrawal thereby decreases in 2.5 times which causes the drop of propane conversion in 30% (Fig. 6). Thus, for effective hydrogen removal affecting directly the thermodynamic equilibrium shift one has to keep the gas space velocity in the internal part of the reactor at level that does not exceed integrated rate of hydrogen removal through a membrane surface. In addition, the gas space velocity in the external part of the reactor should provide an oxygen supply to react with hydrogen removed through the membrane.

5.3. Effect of temperature
The temperatures both in tube and shell sides along the membrane reactor length are presented in Fig. 7. In this case hydrogen is oxidized in the shell side of the membrane reactor. The temperature in a tube side of the reactor is lower which is explained by endothermic type of dehydrogenation reaction.

Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10 show the temperature dependences of propane conversion, selectivity and propylene yield for the process of dehydrogenation simulated for 3 types of reactor: the tubular reactor, the membrane reactor and the latter one (conjugated) equipped with an oxidation function. The temperature of reactor outer wall (TW) was varied from 400 up to 600 °C. One can see from the profiles that both maximum propane conversion and maximum propylene selectivity can be reached in case of “conjugated” type of dehydrogenation reaction. Hence, the membrane reactor with separate hydrogen oxidation should provide the highest propylene yield defined as product of C3H8 conversion on C3H6 selectivity. It is worth to note that the temperature increase always leads to propane conversion increase while the propane selectivity curve related to “conjugated” dehydrogenation passes through a maximum at temperature 500 °C. The value of 525 °C was also found to be corresponding to a maximum propylene yield.

6. Conclusions
A two-dimensional non-isothermal stationary mathematical model for the process of “conjugated” propane dehydrogenation in a catalytic membrane reactor has been developed. It has been shown that the “conjugated” reaction in the membrane reactor functioning as a separator and oxidizer of hydrogen is to be the most appropriate choice for embodiment of propane dehydrogenation process. The performed mathematical modeling has allowed one to define the parameter values at which both the highest conversion of the propane and the propylene selectivity can be reached.
The gas space velocity was found to be an important factor affecting the process efficiency. It was established that the space velocity in the internal part of the reactor should not exceed the rate of hydrogen removal through a membrane. The gas space velocity in the external part of the reactor must be kept at level sufficient to provide a supply of oxygen needed for oxidation of hydrogen on the entire length of the reactor. The temperature around T = 525 °C was found to be the optimal one at which the process of “conjugated” dehydrogenation of the propane should be performed to meet the highest propylene yield.
