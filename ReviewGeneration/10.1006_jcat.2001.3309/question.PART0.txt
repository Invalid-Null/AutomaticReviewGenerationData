I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Abstract
Reaction pathways for the desulfurization of thiophene using alkanes as hydrogen sources were probed by measuring the chemical and isotopic composition of products formed from 13C-labeled C3H8 and unlabeled C4H4S mixtures on H-ZSM5 and Co/H-ZSM5. Aliphatic hydrocarbons formed only from propane carbon atoms while aromatic molecules contained carbon atoms from both propane and thiophene. Hydrogen-deficient thiophene and thiophene-derived species react with surface hydrogen and alkenes formed from propane and desorb as unreactive aromatics, in steps that lead to the irreversible exit of alkenes from oligomerization-cracking cycles. These steps remove kinetic bottlenecks in thiophene desulfurization resulting from the irreversible formation of strongly adsorbed unsaturated species, which cannot desorb without reactions with hydrogen or hydrogen-rich surface species. This kinetic coupling between alkane and thiophene reactions leads to the observed concurrent increase in the rates of both propane aromatization and thiophene desulfurization compared with those achieved with each pure reactant. The scavenging of unsaturated intermediates formed via thiophene decomposition using hydrogen or hydrogen-rich intermediates formed from propane decreases the rate of bimolecular DielsAlder reactions, which lead to larger organosulfur compounds and to low H2S selectivity. As a result, H2S selectivities are higher and deactivation rates are lower when propane is present as a co-reactant during reactions of thiophene.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
