<quotes>
[1] "The VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings (from 0.5 to 10 wt%) are prepared and tested for their catalytic activities in the reaction of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)."

[2] "It is characterized that the VSiBeta catalysts possess different kinds of vanadium species on the SiBeta support, including monomeric or isolated VOx species at a low V loading, and polynuclear VOx species in different polymerization degrees at higher V loadings."

[3] "The 3VSiBeta catalyst (V loading is 3 wt%), containing isolated VOx species in monolayer, shows around 40% of propane conversion with 90% of propylene selectivity (reaction conditions: 600 C, 4000 mL g-1h-1) which are comparable to VSiBeta catalysts with higher V loadings."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It prepares VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite with varying V loadings from 0.5 to 10 wt% and finds that the 3VSiBeta catalyst with 3 wt% V loading, containing isolated VOx species in a monolayer, shows the best catalytic performance comparable to catalysts with higher V loadings.
