<quotes>
[1] "The V-loaded SiBeta system may be of great promising to be employed in PDH reaction."

[2] "The obtained xVSiBeta catalysts (x represents the wt% V which is from 0.5 to 10) were tested in PDH reaction."

[3] "The physicochemical and structural properties of these xVSiBeta samples were systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 sorption, Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (DR UV-vis), H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), Raman spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques."

[4] "It can thus be speculated that the polymerization degree of VOx increases with the increase of V surface density, and a part of highly-polymerized VOx species and even V2O5 crystallite are existent in the 10VSiBeta catalyst."

[5] "The 3VSiBeta catalyst (V loading is 3 wt%), containing isolated VOx species in monolayer, shows around 40% of propane conversion with 90% of propylene selectivity (reaction conditions: 600 C, 4000 mL g-1h-1) which are comparable to VSiBeta catalysts with higher V loadings."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It prepares VSiBeta catalysts with V loadings from 0.5 to 10 wt% and characterizes them systematically to understand how V loading affects VOx species dispersion and polymerization. The 3VSiBeta with isolated VOx monolayer shows the best propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

<quotes>
[1] "XPS measurements were used for obtaining the information about the valence distribution of V element on the surface of VSiBeta catalysts." 

[2] "The proportion of each oxidation state of V listed in Table 3 was calculated from the normalization of the peak area of V 2p3/2 signals."

[3] "The proportion of V4+ species reaches the maximum value when the V loading is of 7 wt%." 

[4] "Then the content of V4+ decreases as further increasing the V loading up to 10 wt%, indicating the crystalline V2O5 gradually forms with the agglomeration of VOx species."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
6. Yes, the article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe oxidation state changes of V in the VSiBeta catalysts. It shows that V4+ content increases then decreases with higher V loading, indicating agglomeration into less active V2O5 at the highest loadings.    
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
6. 是的,该文使用X射线光电子能谱技术探测VSiBeta催化剂中V的氧化态变化。它表明V4+含量先增加后随V含量升高而减少,提示在最高负载量下聚集成活性较低的V2O5。
