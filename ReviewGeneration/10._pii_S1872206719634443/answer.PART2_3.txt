[1] "It is reported that SiBeta support can effectively disperse and stabilize the introduced VOx species due to the existence of vacant T-sites after removing lattice Al atoms"

[2] "The VSiBeta serving as effective heterogeneous catalysts have been applied in various catalytic reactions, such as methanol oxidation, NO reduction, conversion of carbohydrates into 2,5-diformylfuran and propene epoxidation"

[3] "Considering of the catalytic activity of VOx species in OPDH [32], we first propose that the V-loaded SiBeta system may be of great promising to be employed in PDH reaction."

Answer: The article evaluates the SiBeta zeolite support for vanadium oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. It notes that SiBeta can effectively disperse and stabilize VOx species due to vacant sites after dealumination. It also states that V-SiBeta catalysts have been applied in various reactions like methanol oxidation and propene epoxidation, and proposes it may be promising for propane dehydrogenation based on VOx activity in oxidative propane dehydrogenation.
