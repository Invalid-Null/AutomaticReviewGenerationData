<quotes>
[1] "The V-loaded SiBeta system may be of great promising to be employed in PDH reaction."

[2] "The obtained xVSiBeta catalysts (x represents the wt% V which is from 0.5 to 10) were tested in PDH reaction."

[3] "The physicochemical and structural properties of these xVSiBeta samples were systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 sorption, Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (DR UV-vis), H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), Raman spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques."

[4] "It can thus be speculated that the polymerization degree of VOx increases with the increase of V surface density, and a part of highly-polymerized VOx species and even V2O5 crystallite are existent in the 10VSiBeta catalyst."

[5] "The 3VSiBeta catalyst (V loading is 3 wt%), containing isolated VOx species in monolayer, shows around 40% of propane conversion with 90% of propylene selectivity (reaction conditions: 600 C, 4000 mL g-1h-1) which are comparable to VSiBeta catalysts with higher V loadings."
