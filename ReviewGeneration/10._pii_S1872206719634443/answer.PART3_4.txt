[1] "The VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings (from 0.5 to 10 wt%) are prepared and tested for their catalytic activities in the reaction of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)."

[2] "It is characterized that the VSiBeta catalysts possess different kinds of vanadium species on the SiBeta support, including monomeric or isolated VOx species at a low V loading, and polynuclear VOx species in different polymerization degrees at higher V loadings."  

[3] "The 3VSiBeta catalyst (V loading is 3 wt%), containing isolated VOx species in monolayer, shows around 40% of propane conversion with 90% of propylene selectivity (reaction conditions: 600 °C, 4000 mL g-1h-1) which are comparable to VSiBeta catalysts with higher V loadings."

<English version answer>

1. Answer: The article describes preparing VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite with varying V loadings from 0.5 to 10 wt%. It characterizes that lower V loadings result in isolated, monomeric VOx species, while higher V loadings lead to polynuclear VOx species. 

2. Answer: The article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports.

3. Answer: The article investigates varying the V loading amount to optimize dispersion of the active VOx phase. Lower V loadings of 0.5-3 wt% result in isolated, monomeric VOx species with optimal dispersion.

4. Answer: The article does not utilize any in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

5. Answer: The article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces.

6. Answer: The article uses XPS to probe oxidation state changes of V species with different loadings. Fig. 6 shows XPS spectra of 3/7/10VSiBeta catalysts.

7. Answer: The article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.

<Chinese version answer>

1. 回答:该文描述了在去除铝的Beta沸石载体上制备不同V负载量(0.5至10 wt%)的VOx催化剂。它表征了较低的V负载量导致隔离的、单体的VOx物种,而较高的V负载量导致聚核VOx物种。

2. 回答:该文没有评估沸石载体中的金属封装。

3. 回答:该文通过改变V负载量来优化主相VOx的分散。0.5-3 wt%的较低V负载量导致隔离的、单体的VOx物种,具有优化的分散性。

4. 回答:该文没有利用任何原位表征技术来研究工作中的丙烷脱氢催化剂。

5. 回答:该文没有采用先进的显微技术表征金属-载体界面。

6. 回答:该文使用XPS来探测不同负载量的V物种的氧化态变化。图6显示了3/7/10VSiBeta催化剂的XPS谱。

7. 回答:该文没有评估不同的反应器类型用于丙烷脱氢。
