<quotes>
[1] "It has been reported that VOx supported on silica materials can introduce both the Brønsted acidic sites and Lewis acidic sites (LAS), while the Brønsted acidic sites would disappear after the high-temperature treatment due to the destruction of hydrated VOx. So the generated weak and medium acidic sites in VSiBeta catalysts are ascribed to mono- and polymeric VOx species, respectively, both of which make contributions to the adsorption and activation of light alkane as LAS."

[2] "The regeneration experiments of the 3VSiBeta catalyst were carried out to investigate its reusability. The regeneration operation was conducted after PDH reaction for 4 h, in which the used catalyst was calcined at 600 °C for 2 h in air to remove the formed coke. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the initial propane conversion of 3VSiBeta is fully restored in the second PDH cycle."

[3] "Considering of the acidic sites created by the interaction sites between V species and SiBeta support, the correlations between the catalytic performance and acidic sites amount are depicted in Fig. 9. The initial propane conversion of VSiBeta catalyst shows a linear increase with the amount of acidic sites (Fig. 9(a)), indicating the catalytic activity is greatly dependent on the created acidic sites."

[4] "The catalytic activity of VSiBeta catalyst is exclusively influenced by the interaction sites between the VOx species and SiBeta support, and seems not be associated with the initial valance of V because the V5+ can be reduced by hydrocarbons during reaction."

[5] "Moreover, the aggregation degree of VOx species has effects on the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes that the catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation over VOx/SiBeta catalysts comes from acidic sites created by VOx species bonding to the SiBeta support. It shows that propane conversion correlates with number of V-O-Si acidic sites. Reusability tests indicate these sites remain stable through reaction-regeneration cycling. The initial V5+ oxidation state does not affect activity since it is reduced to V3+ under reaction conditions. Higher VOx aggregation increases propylene selectivity but also deactivation rate.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
答:本文提出VOx/SiBeta催化剂的丙烷脱氢催化活性来源于VOx物种与SiBeta载体结合产生的酸性位点。它显示丙烷转化与V-O-Si酸性位点的数量有关。再生循环试验表明这些位点在反应-再生循环中保持稳定。初始的V5+氧化态不影响活性,因为它在反应条件下被还原为V3+。更高的VOx聚集增加丙烯选择性,但也增加脱活速率。

<quotes>
[1] "The acidic sites of VOx catalyst supported on SiBeta zeolite are the catalytically active phase, derived from the interaction sites, which shows high activity and great reusability in direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[2] "Given the above, there is not a definite conclusion about the kind of active vanadium species for PDH, in terms of polymerization degree, acidity and oxidation state, because the surface chemistry of VOx species is deeply affected by support characteristics."

[3] "The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support, and keeps stable after several regeneration cycles." 

[4] "Therefore, the new insight into the active sites of VOx catalysts in PDH reaction is put forward in this work, and we expect the promising VSiBeta catalyst can open an avenue for rationally designing other transition metalbased catalysts."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes that the acidic sites derived from the interaction between VOx species and the SiBeta support are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over VOx/SiBeta catalysts. It notes the activity correlates with the number of acidic sites. The nature of the VOx species affects activity, and isolated VOx species interacting with the support give the highest activity. The article provides new insights into VOx active sites for propane dehydrogenation.

<Chinese version answer>  
答:该文献提出VOx物种与SiBeta支撑材料间相互作用生成的酸性位点是VOx/SiBeta催化剂上丙烷脱氢反应的活性位点。它指出活性与酸性位点数量有关。VOx物种的性质会影响活性,与支撑物相互作用的隔离VOx物种给出最高活性。该文献对VOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的活性位点提供了新的见解。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "It is characterized that the VSiBeta catalysts possess different kinds of vanadium species on the SiBeta support, including monomeric or isolated VOx species at a low V loading, and polynuclear VOx species in different polymerization degrees at higher V loadings."

[2] "Moreover, the aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading."

[3] "It also suggests that the acidic sites are created by forming VOSi bonds, because the connected VOx species reduce the VOSi bonds but the VOV bonds."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explores metal-support interfacial effects. It shows monomeric VOx species interacting with the SiBeta support via V-O-Si bonds give the highest activity. Increasing VOx polymerization and aggregation decreases selectivity and increases deactivation from coking. The polymeric VOx species reduce V-O-V bonds rather than V-O-Si bonds.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
答:该文献探索了金属-支撑物界面效应。它显示与SiBeta支撑材料通过V-O-Si键相互作用的单体VOx物种给出最高活性。VOx聚合度和聚集程度的增加降低选择性并增加由结焦造成的失活。聚合VOx物种较V-O-V键更易还原V-O-Si键。

[1] "It is reported that SiBeta support can effectively disperse and stabilize the introduced VOx species due to the existence of vacant T-sites after removing lattice Al atoms."
[2] "The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support, and keeps stable after several regeneration cycles."  
[3] "Thus, as the VOx species directly contact with SiBeta support via V-O-Si bonds, a reactivity enhancement can be achieved."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explores metal-support interfacial effects in VOx/SiBeta catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that the SiBeta support can effectively disperse and stabilize VOx species due to vacant sites, and that the catalytic activity exhibits a linear relationship with the amount of acidic sites derived from V-O-Si bonds. This indicates metal-support interactions via V-O-Si bonds enhance reactivity.

Answer: 该文献探索了VOx/SiBeta催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应中的金属-支撑体间界面效应。它显示SiBeta支撑体由于存在空位点可以有效分散和稳定VOx物种,且催化活性与源自V-O-Si键的酸性位点数量呈线性关系。这表明V-O-Si键形成的金属-支撑体相互作用增强了反应活性。

[1] "Herein, we prepared VOx catalyst supported on SiBeta by using a two-step postsynthesis method [33, 34], and then treated the as-prepared samples with a hightemperature calcination in air."

[2] "The obtained xVSiBeta catalysts (x represents the wt% V which is from 0.5 to 10) were tested in PDH reaction."  

[3] "The ideal catalytic performances were simultaneously realized on the 3/7/10VSiBeta catalysts, about 40% of propane conversion and 90% of propylene selectivity."

[4] "The physicochemical and structural properties of these xVSiBeta samples were systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 sorption, Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (DR UV-vis), H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), Raman spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques."

[5] "The characterization and test results drew the conclusions about the states of VOx species as well as the acidic sites of VSiBeta catalysts, and their roles in the PDH reaction, giving a new insight into the active phase of VOx catalysts."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explores supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) for propane dehydrogenation. VOx/SiBeta catalysts with 0.5-10 wt% V loadings were synthesized and characterized by various techniques. Catalytic testing showed 3/7/10 wt% V catalysts achieved ~40% propane conversion and ~90% propylene selectivity. Characterization revealed isolated and polymeric VOx species were present, with higher V loading leading to more polymeric species. The acid sites generated from VOx-support interactions were found to determine catalytic activity, while VOx polymerization affected selectivity and deactivation. New insights into active sites of VOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation are provided.
