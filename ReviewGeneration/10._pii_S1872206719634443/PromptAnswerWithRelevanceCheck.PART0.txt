1. Propylene is an important basis of numerous chemical products, such as polymers, resins, solvents and fibers, mainly obtained from the steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil. With the increasing demand of propylene and the exploitation of shale gas, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) as an alternative way has drawn great attention and been widely employed in commercial propylene production, and is a great mean for turning low-value propane into value-added propylene.

2. No relevant quotes.

3. The commercial PDH catalysts are based on Pt and CrOx based catalysts, while the high cost of Pt and toxicity of CrOx greatly hinder their further wide application.
