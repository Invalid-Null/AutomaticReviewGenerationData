<quotes>
[1] "It has been reported that VOx supported on silica materials can introduce both the Brønsted acidic sites and Lewis acidic sites (LAS), while the Brønsted acidic sites would disappear after the high-temperature treatment due to the destruction of hydrated VOx. So the generated weak and medium acidic sites in VSiBeta catalysts are ascribed to mono- and polymeric VOx species, respectively, both of which make contributions to the adsorption and activation of light alkane as LAS."

[2] "The regeneration experiments of the 3VSiBeta catalyst were carried out to investigate its reusability. The regeneration operation was conducted after PDH reaction for 4 h, in which the used catalyst was calcined at 600 °C for 2 h in air to remove the formed coke. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the initial propane conversion of 3VSiBeta is fully restored in the second PDH cycle."

[3] "Considering of the acidic sites created by the interaction sites between V species and SiBeta support, the correlations between the catalytic performance and acidic sites amount are depicted in Fig. 9. The initial propane conversion of VSiBeta catalyst shows a linear increase with the amount of acidic sites (Fig. 9(a)), indicating the catalytic activity is greatly dependent on the created acidic sites."

[4] "The catalytic activity of VSiBeta catalyst is exclusively influenced by the interaction sites between the VOx species and SiBeta support, and seems not be associated with the initial valance of V because the V5+ can be reduced by hydrocarbons during reaction."

[5] "Moreover, the aggregation degree of VOx species has effects on the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes that the catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation over VOx/SiBeta catalysts comes from acidic sites created by VOx species bonding to the SiBeta support. It shows that propane conversion correlates with number of V-O-Si acidic sites. Reusability tests indicate these sites remain stable through reaction-regeneration cycling. The initial V5+ oxidation state does not affect activity since it is reduced to V3+ under reaction conditions. Higher VOx aggregation increases propylene selectivity but also deactivation rate.

<Chinese version answer>  
答:本文提出VOx/SiBeta催化剂的丙烷脱氢催化活性来源于VOx物种与SiBeta载体结合产生的酸性位点。它显示丙烷转化与V-O-Si酸性位点的数量有关。再生循环试验表明这些位点在反应-再生循环中保持稳定。初始的V5+氧化态不影响活性,因为它在反应条件下被还原为V3+。更高的VOx聚集增加丙烯选择性,但也增加脱活速率。
