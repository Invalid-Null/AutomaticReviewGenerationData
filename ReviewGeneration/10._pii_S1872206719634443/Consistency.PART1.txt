 Here is the comparison of the answer files against the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},
  "2": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},
  "3": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},
  "4": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},
  "5": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "0%"}, 
  "6": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "0%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},
  "7": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "0%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "0%"}
}
```

I carefully compared the content of each answer file to the corresponding correct answer for each question. The consistency ratio reflects how similar the given answer is to the correct one. 0% means completely different answers, 100% means identical or highly similar answers.
