To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key points made in each answer against the correct answer provided. I calculated a percentage based on how much of the content matched or contradicted the correct answer. This gives a quantitative measure of the consistency between the student answers and the reference correct answers. Let me know if you have any other questions!
