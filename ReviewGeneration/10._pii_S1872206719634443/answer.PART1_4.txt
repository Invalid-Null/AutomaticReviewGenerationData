[1] "Herein, we prepared VOx catalyst supported on SiBeta by using a two-step postsynthesis method [33, 34], and then treated the as-prepared samples with a hightemperature calcination in air."

[2] "The obtained xVSiBeta catalysts (x represents the wt% V which is from 0.5 to 10) were tested in PDH reaction."  

[3] "The ideal catalytic performances were simultaneously realized on the 3/7/10VSiBeta catalysts, about 40% of propane conversion and 90% of propylene selectivity."

[4] "The physicochemical and structural properties of these xVSiBeta samples were systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 sorption, Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (DR UV-vis), H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), Raman spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques."

[5] "The characterization and test results drew the conclusions about the states of VOx species as well as the acidic sites of VSiBeta catalysts, and their roles in the PDH reaction, giving a new insight into the active phase of VOx catalysts."

Answer: The article explores supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) for propane dehydrogenation. VOx/SiBeta catalysts with 0.5-10 wt% V loadings were synthesized and characterized by various techniques. Catalytic testing showed 3/7/10 wt% V catalysts achieved ~40% propane conversion and ~90% propylene selectivity. Characterization revealed isolated and polymeric VOx species were present, with higher V loading leading to more polymeric species. The acid sites generated from VOx-support interactions were found to determine catalytic activity, while VOx polymerization affected selectivity and deactivation. New insights into active sites of VOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation are provided.

Answer: 该文献探索了负载在脱除铝的Beta沸石(SiBeta)上的钒氧化物(VOx)催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。合成了0.5-10 wt% V负载的VOx/SiBeta催化剂,并用各种技术对其进行了表征。催化测试显示3/7/10 wt% V的催化剂达到了约40%的丙烷转化率和约90%的丙烯选择性。表征结果显示存在孤立的和聚合的VOx物种,V负载量越高,聚合物种越多。由VOx与支撑体的相互作用生成的酸性位点决定了催化活性,而VOx的聚合程度影响选择性和失活。该文献对VOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的活性位点提供了新的见解。
