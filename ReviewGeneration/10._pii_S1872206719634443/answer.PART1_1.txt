<quotes>
[1] "The acidic sites of VOx catalyst supported on SiBeta zeolite are the catalytically active phase, derived from the interaction sites, which shows high activity and great reusability in direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[2] "Given the above, there is not a definite conclusion about the kind of active vanadium species for PDH, in terms of polymerization degree, acidity and oxidation state, because the surface chemistry of VOx species is deeply affected by support characteristics."

[3] "The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support, and keeps stable after several regeneration cycles." 

[4] "Therefore, the new insight into the active sites of VOx catalysts in PDH reaction is put forward in this work, and we expect the promising VSiBeta catalyst can open an avenue for rationally designing other transition metalbased catalysts."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes that the acidic sites derived from the interaction between VOx species and the SiBeta support are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over VOx/SiBeta catalysts. It notes the activity correlates with the number of acidic sites. The nature of the VOx species affects activity, and isolated VOx species interacting with the support give the highest activity. The article provides new insights into VOx active sites for propane dehydrogenation.

答:该文献提出VOx物种与SiBeta支撑材料间相互作用生成的酸性位点是VOx/SiBeta催化剂上丙烷脱氢反应的活性位点。它指出活性与酸性位点数量有关。VOx物种的性质会影响活性,与支撑物相互作用的隔离VOx物种给出最高活性。该文献对VOx催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的活性位点提供了新的见解。

[1] "It is characterized that the VSiBeta catalysts possess different kinds of vanadium species on the SiBeta support, including monomeric or isolated VOx species at a low V loading, and polynuclear VOx species in different polymerization degrees at higher V loadings."

[2] "Moreover, the aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading."

[3] "It also suggests that the acidic sites are created by forming VOSi bonds, because the connected VOx species reduce the VOSi bonds but the VOV bonds."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explores metal-support interfacial effects. It shows monomeric VOx species interacting with the SiBeta support via V-O-Si bonds give the highest activity. Increasing VOx polymerization and aggregation decreases selectivity and increases deactivation from coking. The polymeric VOx species reduce V-O-V bonds rather than V-O-Si bonds.

<Chinese version answer>  
答:该文献探索了金属-支撑物界面效应。它显示与SiBeta支撑材料通过V-O-Si键相互作用的单体VOx物种给出最高活性。VOx聚合度和聚集程度的增加降低选择性并增加由结焦造成的失活。聚合VOx物种较V-O-V键更易还原V-O-Si键。
