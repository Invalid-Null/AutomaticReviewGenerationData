<quotes>
[1] "It is reported that SiBeta support can effectively disperse and stabilize the introduced VOx species due to the existence of vacant T-sites after removing lattice Al atoms."
[2] "The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support, and keeps stable after several regeneration cycles."  
[3] "Thus, as the VOx species directly contact with SiBeta support via V-O-Si bonds, a reactivity enhancement can be achieved."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explores metal-support interfacial effects in VOx/SiBeta catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that the SiBeta support can effectively disperse and stabilize VOx species due to vacant sites, and that the catalytic activity exhibits a linear relationship with the amount of acidic sites derived from V-O-Si bonds. This indicates metal-support interactions via V-O-Si bonds enhance reactivity.

Answer: 该文献探索了VOx/SiBeta催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应中的金属-支撑体间界面效应。它显示SiBeta支撑体由于存在空位点可以有效分散和稳定VOx物种,且催化活性与源自V-O-Si键的酸性位点数量呈线性关系。这表明V-O-Si键形成的金属-支撑体相互作用增强了反应活性。
