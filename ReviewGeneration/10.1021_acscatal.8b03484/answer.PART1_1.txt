[1] "We investigated the propane DH on these site pairs for both the concerted and stepwise mechanisms."

[2] "Interestingly, our results revealed inverse trends between the activation barriers for CH activation and H2 production steps with respect to the H2 binding energy for both the concerted and stepwise mechanisms."

[3] "With the dissociative hydrogen binding energy governing the alkane DH activity, we further performed AIMD simulations to address the feasibility of hydrogen formation and surface dynamics of three selected sites including the most active site (AlIIIOIII) of hydroxylated metastable γ-Al2O3 (110)."

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning acid-base properties of γ-Al2O3 affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It reveals that site pairs with strong H2 binding exhibit low CH activation barriers, while sites with weak H2 binding have low H2 production barriers [2]. It also shows that an optimal H2 binding energy exists for high propane DH rates, following a volcano relationship [3].

<Chinese version answer>

答:是的,本文研究了调整γ-Al2O3的酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它揭示了强H2结合的位点对具有低CH激活能垒,而弱H2结合的位点对则具有低H2生成能垒[2]。它还显示出一个最佳的H2结合能对应较高的丙烷脱氢速率,呈现出火山关系[3]。

[1] "In this work, we applied periodic DFT calculations to investigate the propane DH on nonhydroxylated (100) and (110) and hydroxylated (110) facets of γ-Al2O3 by accounting for two different DH mechanisms, concerted and stepwise." 

[2] "Our calculations revealed that the DH mechanism changes on the different surface sites (site-dependent mechanism), and that the most active sites for propane DH favor the concerted pathway."

[3] "We revealed a volcano relationship between the calculated propane DH TOFs and the dissociative H2 binding energy."

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article proposes concerted and stepwise mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over γ-Al2O3. It describes the reaction steps, intermediates, and active sites involved in each mechanism [1]. It finds the preferred mechanism is site-dependent, with the most active sites favoring the concerted pathway [2]. A volcano relationship between activity and H2 binding energy is revealed [3].

<Chinese version answer>

答:是的,本文为丙烷在γ-Al2O3上的脱氢提出了协同机理和步进机理方案。它描述了每个机理中涉及的反应步骤、中间体和活性位点[1]。它发现优先机理取决于位点,最活跃位点偏向协同途径[2]。活性与H2结合能之间呈现出一个火山关系[3]。
