</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

1. 这篇文章没有评估任何有前景的金属氧化物催化剂,如Cr2O3、Pt-Sn、Ga2O3用于丙烷脱氢。它仅专注于研究γ-Al2O3。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "Herein, we investigate various mechanisms of alkane DH on two nonhydroxylated low index surface facets and the hydroxylated (110) surface of γ-Al2O3 toward the development of SARs from first-principles calculations."

[2] "Specifically, depending on the surface crystallographic plane, Al atoms can exhibit pentacoordination (AlV), tetracoordination (AlIV), or tricoordination (AlIII), and the neighboring oxygen atoms can exhibit dicoordination (OII) or tricoordination (OIII)."

[3] "Recently, Digne et al. (32,33) established that for temperatures as high as 700950 K, the (110) facet has an OH coverage of 5.9 OH/nm2 (i.e., 4 H2O molecules per p2 × 1 supercell), whereas the (100) surface is expected to be water-free under the experimental DH conditions." 

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article investigates how tuning oxidation states of Al and O atoms and surface hydration of γ-Al2O3 affects propane dehydrogenation. It studies nonhydroxylated and hydroxylated γ-Al2O3 (110) surfaces with different Al and O coordinations. It finds the hydroxylated metastable γ-Al2O3 (110) surface is most active due to the creation of active AlIII-OIII site pairs.  

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

2. 该文研究了调谐Al和O原子的氧化态以及γ-Al2O3的表面湿化如何影响丙烷脱氢。它研究了不同Al和O配位的非羟基化和羟基化γ-Al2O3(110)表面。它发现羟基化的不稳定γ-Al2O3(110)表面由于创造了活性的AlIII-OIII位点对而最活跃。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "In general, there are two surface mechanisms possible for alkane DH over oxide catalysts: the concerted and stepwise pathways." 

[2] "In the concerted mechanism (Figure 1, top panel), two CH bonds of the alkane break simultaneously in a concerted fashion, followed by the molecular hydrogen formation via recombination of two surface-bound hydrogen atoms."

[3] "In the stepwise pathway (Figure 1, bottom panel), a single CH bond breaks first, by the abstraction of a proton by a surface oxygen atom, with the alkyl group bonding to the surface aluminum to form a surface-bound Al-n-Alkyl species."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. The article proposes concerted and stepwise mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over γ-Al2O3. The concerted pathway breaks two C-H bonds simultaneously while the stepwise pathway breaks one C-H bond followed by hydrogen abstraction and olefin formation.

</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>

3. 该文提出了丙烷在γ-Al2O3上的脱氢所遵循的协同机理和步移机理。协同机理是同时断裂两个C-H键,而步移机理首先断裂一个C-H键,其后进行氢的拔除和烯烃的形成。

<quotes>

[1] "We investigated the propane DH on these site pairs for both the concerted and stepwise mechanisms."

[2] "Interestingly, our results revealed inverse trends between the activation barriers for CH activation and H2 production steps with respect to the H2 binding energy for both the concerted and stepwise mechanisms."

[3] "With the dissociative hydrogen binding energy governing the alkane DH activity, we further performed AIMD simulations to address the feasibility of hydrogen formation and surface dynamics of three selected sites including the most active site (AlIIIOIII) of hydroxylated metastable γ-Al2O3 (110)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning acid-base properties of γ-Al2O3 affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It reveals that site pairs with strong H2 binding exhibit low CH activation barriers, while sites with weak H2 binding have low H2 production barriers [2]. It also shows that an optimal H2 binding energy exists for high propane DH rates, following a volcano relationship [3].

</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>

答:是的,本文研究了调整γ-Al2O3的酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它揭示了强H2结合的位点对具有低CH激活能垒,而弱H2结合的位点对则具有低H2生成能垒[2]。它还显示出一个最佳的H2结合能对应较高的丙烷脱氢速率,呈现出火山关系[3]。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "In this work, we applied periodic DFT calculations to investigate the propane DH on nonhydroxylated (100) and (110) and hydroxylated (110) facets of γ-Al2O3 by accounting for two different DH mechanisms, concerted and stepwise." 

[2] "Our calculations revealed that the DH mechanism changes on the different surface sites (site-dependent mechanism), and that the most active sites for propane DH favor the concerted pathway."

[3] "We revealed a volcano relationship between the calculated propane DH TOFs and the dissociative H2 binding energy."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article proposes concerted and stepwise mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over γ-Al2O3. It describes the reaction steps, intermediates, and active sites involved in each mechanism [1]. It finds the preferred mechanism is site-dependent, with the most active sites favoring the concerted pathway [2]. A volcano relationship between activity and H2 binding energy is revealed [3].

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

答:是的,本文为丙烷在γ-Al2O3上的脱氢提出了协同机理和步进机理方案。它描述了每个机理中涉及的反应步骤、中间体和活性位点[1]。它发现优先机理取决于位点,最活跃位点偏向协同途径[2]。活性与H2结合能之间呈现出一个火山关系[3]。

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied γ-Al2O3 catalyst. It describes two possible pathways - concerted and stepwise. The concerted pathway involves simultaneous cleavage of two C-H bonds followed by H2 formation. The stepwise pathway involves sequential cleavage of C-H bonds and H2 formation via β-hydrogen elimination. Specific intermediates and transition states are shown for both pathways.
