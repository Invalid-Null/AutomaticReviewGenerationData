[1] The article states that "Shale gas revolution in North America has recently promoted the mass production of natural gas liquids, specifically ethane and propane, making on-purpose olefin production from alkane dehydrogenation an attractive alternative to the traditional olefin production processes."

[2] The article explains that "Pt-based catalysts are among the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH [propane dehydrogenation], but they suffer from the unsatisfactory selectivity towards propylene and poor catalyst stability due to coke formation."

[3] The article introduces supported metals, stating "First, novel preparation methods have been proposed to control the size and shape of Pt nanoparticles [10], [11]." It also introduces alloys, stating "Second, addition of a second metal, including Sn, Ga, Cu, Ir and In, to the platinum catalyst to form bimetallic catalysts is also an effective way to suppress undesired side reactions [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]."

[4] The article discusses that "The strongly exothermic nature of PDH [ΔH°=+123.8kJ/mol] requires high reaction temperature (around 600C) to achieve a reasonable propane conversion." It also states "Given that the propylene adsorption energy has been identified as the descriptor in this work, it is not surprising that the turnover frequency for propane dehydrogenation has a good linear relationship with the propylene adsorption energy."

[5] The article describes that "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried to identify Pt-based core-shell alloy catalysts with improved catalyst selectivity and coke resistance for propane dehydrogenation." 

[6] No relevant quotes.

[7] The article describes "Linear scaling relations are established to identify the descriptor that can be used to represent the overall reaction kinetics." It also states "Both the chemisorption energy and transition state energy scaling relations indicate that the adsorption energy of propylene can be used as a descriptor to represent the energies of the other C3 species and transition states and can therefore describe the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation over M@Pt core-shell alloys."
