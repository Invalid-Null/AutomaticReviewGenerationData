<quotes>
[1] "Given that the propylene adsorption energy has been identified as the descriptor in this work, it is not surprising that the turnover frequency for propane dehydrogenation has a good linear relationship with the propylene adsorption energy, as shown in Fig. 8a." 

[2] "The scaling relations also suggest that a higher catalyst selectivity toward propylene can only be achieved at the expense of a lower catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "The core-shell catalysts are found to have less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies for the dehydrogenation reactions than Pt, thus giving rise to a lower catalytic activity and a higher selectivity toward propylene."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article does investigate electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It provides specific examples and structure-function insights by showing that the adsorption energy of propylene as a descriptor scales linearly with turnover frequency and selectivity, indicating electronic structure modulation by the core metal affects activity and selectivity. It also shows core-shell catalysts have weaker propylene adsorption and higher dehydrogenation barriers than Pt, lowering activity but improving selectivity.

Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic core-shell catalysts. It studies the strain and ligand effects of substituting late transition metals like Fe, Co, Ni, etc. for Pt in the core on the lattice parameter and d-band center of the surface Pt atoms. This tunes the chemisorption energies and transition state energies, affecting activity and selectivity.
