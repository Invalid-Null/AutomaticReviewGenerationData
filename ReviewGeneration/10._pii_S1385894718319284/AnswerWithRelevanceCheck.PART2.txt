         [1] "Because of the size mismatch and electronegativity difference, the electronic structures of the shell atoms are modified by the core atoms through the combined strain and ligand effects [25], making it possible to tailor the adsorption and catalytic properties of the core-shell alloys to a particular application."

         [2] "The adsorption behavior of the core-shell alloy surfaces is determined not only by the strain effect but also by the electron transfer between the solute and host metal, which is known as the ligand effect and arises from the change in the chemical environment of a metal with its surrounding ligand [25]."

         Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in the core-shell nanoparticles. It explains that the core metal modifies the electronic structure of the Pt shell atoms through strain and ligand effects, allowing tuning of the adsorption and catalytic properties.

         Answer: No, the article does not explore the use of subsurface promoters like Re or Mn in bimetallic and alloy catalysts to tune selectivity. It only studies late transition metals as core metals in Pt-based core-shell nanoparticles.
      </English>

      <Chinese>
         答:否,本文没有探究如Re或Mn等亚表面促进剂在双金属和合金催化剂中的应用来调节选择性。它仅研究了以后过渡金属为核的Pt基核壳纳米粒子。

         [1] "Microkinetic analysis combined with the results obtained from density functional theory calculations has been performed to examine the catalytic activity and selectivity of Pt-based core-shell alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
         
         [2] "The scaling relations also suggest that a higher catalyst selectivity toward propylene can only be achieved at the expense of a lower catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation."
      </Quotes>
      
      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article describes synergistic effects between Pt and the core metal in the core-shell nanoparticles, attributed to ensemble and ligand effects. It shows how the core metal modulates the selectivity and activity of the Pt shell for propane dehydrogenation.
      </English>

      <Chinese>
         是的,本文描述了核壳纳米粒子中的Pt和核金属之间的协同效应,归因于配位团效应。它展示了核金属如何调节Pt壳层对丙烷脱氢的选择性和活性。

         Answer: No, the article does not evaluate any zeolite supports like MFI, FER, or BEA structures for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It only studies unsupported Pt-based core-shell nanoparticles.
      </English>

      <Chinese>
         答:否,本文没有评估MFI、FER或BEA等沸石支持的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它仅研究了无支撑的Pt基核壳纳米粒子。

        Answer: No, the article does not investigate the effects of tuning zeolite Si/Al ratio or incorporating mesoporosity on propane dehydrogenation catalyst performance, since it does not study zeolite-supported catalysts.
     </English>

     <Chinese>
        答:否,由于本文没有研究沸石支持的催化剂,所以也没有调查调节沸石Si/Al比或引入介孔对丙烷脱氢催化剂性能的影响。
