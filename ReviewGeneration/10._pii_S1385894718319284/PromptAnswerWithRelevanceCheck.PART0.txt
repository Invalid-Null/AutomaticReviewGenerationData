<Answer>
 <quotes>

[1] The article states that "Shale gas revolution in North America has recently promoted the mass production of natural gas liquids, specifically ethane and propane, making on-purpose olefin production from alkane dehydrogenation an attractive alternative to the traditional olefin production processes."

[2] The article explains that "Pt-based catalysts are among the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH [propane dehydrogenation], but they suffer from the unsatisfactory selectivity towards propylene and poor catalyst stability due to coke formation."

[3] The article introduces supported metals, stating "First, novel preparation methods have been proposed to control the size and shape of Pt nanoparticles [10], [11]." It also introduces alloys, stating "Second, addition of a second metal, including Sn, Ga, Cu, Ir and In, to the platinum catalyst to form bimetallic catalysts is also an effective way to suppress undesired side reactions [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]."

[4] The article discusses that "The strongly exothermic nature of PDH [ΔH°=+123.8kJ/mol] requires high reaction temperature (around 600C) to achieve a reasonable propane conversion." It also states "Given that the propylene adsorption energy has been identified as the descriptor in this work, it is not surprising that the turnover frequency for propane dehydrogenation has a good linear relationship with the propylene adsorption energy."

[5] The article describes that "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried to identify Pt-based core-shell alloy catalysts with improved catalyst selectivity and coke resistance for propane dehydrogenation." 

[6] No relevant quotes.

[7] The article describes "Linear scaling relations are established to identify the descriptor that can be used to represent the overall reaction kinetics." It also states "Both the chemisorption energy and transition state energy scaling relations indicate that the adsorption energy of propylene can be used as a descriptor to represent the energies of the other C3 species and transition states and can therefore describe the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation over M@Pt core-shell alloys."

[1] "Pt-based catalysts are among the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH [3], but they suffer from the unsatisfactory selectivity towards propylene and poor catalyst stability due to coke formation."

[2] "The strongly exothermic nature of PDH [ΔH° = +123.8kJ/mol] requires high reaction temperature (around 600°C) to achieve a reasonable propane conversion."

[3] "Therefore, the catalyst selectivity in PDH dictates not only the yield of propylene, but also plays a key role in determining the stability of the catalyst, and the development of Pt-based catalysts with improved selectivity and increased resistance to coke formation is highly desired."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article explains that catalysts like Pt lower the activation energy barriers and facilitate propane dehydrogenation. Specifically, it states that Pt catalysts allow the reaction to proceed at high temperatures of around 600°C to achieve reasonable conversion, even though the reaction is highly exothermic. It also notes that selectivity of the catalyst impacts propylene yield and coke formation, which affects catalyst stability.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,文章解释了Pt等催化剂降低了活化能垒,促进了丙烷脱氢反应。具体来说,它指出Pt催化剂允许反应在约600°C的高温下进行,以达到合理的转化率,即使反应是高度放热的。它还指出催化剂的选择性影响丙烯收率和焦炭形成,从而影响催化剂的稳定性。

[1] "In principle, if the Gibbs free energy barrier for propylene desorption is lower than that for propylene dehydrogenation, propylene molecules could be readily released from the metal surface, thereby giving rise to a high propylene selectivity." 

[2] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by using the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP), where the interactions between valence electrons and ion cores are represented by pseudopotentials and the electronic wavefunctions at each k-point are expanded in terms of a discrete plane-wave basis set."

[3] "Transition states were located by using the dimer method and validated with vibrational analysis."

[4] "The rate constant for elementary steps was estimated on the basis of transition state theory (TST), which is written as..."

[5] "Microkinetic analysis combined with the results obtained from density functional theory calculations has been performed to examine the catalytic activity and selectivity of Pt-based core-shell alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article describes how DFT calculations have been applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways. Specifically, it mentions using VASP software with pseudopotentials and plane waves to model the systems. It also describes locating transition states with the dimer method and validating them with vibrational analysis. DFT results were combined with microkinetic modeling to examine catalytic activity and selectivity.

<quotes>
[1] "Linear chemisorption energy and transition state energy scaling relations hold very well in the present work, and the adsorption energy of propylene is identified to be a good descriptor to represent the overall kinetics."

[2] "The scaling relations also suggest that a higher catalyst selectivity toward propylene can only be achieved at the expense of a lower catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "Given that the propylene adsorption energy has been identified as the descriptor in this work, it is not surprising that the turnover frequency for propane dehydrogenation has a good linear relationship with the propylene adsorption energy."

[4] "Furthermore, it is interesting to find that selectivity descriptor, namely, the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and desorption, also scales linearly with the adsorption energy of propylene."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article describes how computational work identified propylene adsorption energy as a descriptor correlating catalyst properties to propane dehydrogenation performance. Linear scaling relations were found between propylene adsorption energy and turnover frequency as well as selectivity. This revealed tradeoffs between activity and selectivity.
