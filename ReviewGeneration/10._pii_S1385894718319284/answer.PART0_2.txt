<quotes>
[1] "Pt-based catalysts are among the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH [3], but they suffer from the unsatisfactory selectivity towards propylene and poor catalyst stability due to coke formation."

[2] "The strongly exothermic nature of PDH [ΔH° = +123.8kJ/mol] requires high reaction temperature (around 600°C) to achieve a reasonable propane conversion."

[3] "Therefore, the catalyst selectivity in PDH dictates not only the yield of propylene, but also plays a key role in determining the stability of the catalyst, and the development of Pt-based catalysts with improved selectivity and increased resistance to coke formation is highly desired."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article explains that catalysts like Pt lower the activation energy barriers and facilitate propane dehydrogenation. Specifically, it states that Pt catalysts allow the reaction to proceed at high temperatures of around 600°C to achieve reasonable conversion, even though the reaction is highly exothermic. It also notes that selectivity of the catalyst impacts propylene yield and coke formation, which affects catalyst stability.

[1] "In principle, if the Gibbs free energy barrier for propylene desorption is lower than that for propylene dehydrogenation, propylene molecules could be readily released from the metal surface, thereby giving rise to a high propylene selectivity." 

[2] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by using the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP), where the interactions between valence electrons and ion cores are represented by pseudopotentials and the electronic wavefunctions at each k-point are expanded in terms of a discrete plane-wave basis set."

[3] "Transition states were located by using the dimer method and validated with vibrational analysis."

[4] "The rate constant for elementary steps was estimated on the basis of transition state theory (TST), which is written as..."

[5] "Microkinetic analysis combined with the results obtained from density functional theory calculations has been performed to examine the catalytic activity and selectivity of Pt-based core-shell alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."

[1] "Linear chemisorption energy and transition state energy scaling relations hold very well in the present work, and the adsorption energy of propylene is identified to be a good descriptor to represent the overall kinetics."

[2] "The scaling relations also suggest that a higher catalyst selectivity toward propylene can only be achieved at the expense of a lower catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "Given that the propylene adsorption energy has been identified as the descriptor in this work, it is not surprising that the turnover frequency for propane dehydrogenation has a good linear relationship with the propylene adsorption energy."

[4] "Furthermore, it is interesting to find that selectivity descriptor, namely, the activation energy difference between propylene dehydrogenation and desorption, also scales linearly with the adsorption energy of propylene."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article describes how computational work identified propylene adsorption energy as a descriptor correlating catalyst properties to propane dehydrogenation performance. Linear scaling relations were found between propylene adsorption energy and turnover frequency as well as selectivity. This revealed tradeoffs between activity and selectivity.
