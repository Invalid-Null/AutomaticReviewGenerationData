[1] "Herein, we investigated the relationship between the structure and preparation conditions of Al2O3 and focused on adjusting the acidity of alumina by varying the calcination temperature."

[2] "The catalyst support not only serves as a scaffold but also provides a complex microenvironment, which is a key factor in determining the catalytic function [3]."  

[3] "The unique nanostructure of the synthesized rod-shaped alumina with quite a rough surface may contribute to the outstanding stability of the Cr-Al-800 catalyst."

[4] "The lower acidity of the Cr-Al-800 catalyst rendered it a better anti-coking ability."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explores metal-support interfacial effects in alumina supported Cr2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that varying the calcination temperature of alumina supports modulates their acidity, which affects catalyst stability and coking resistance. The rod-shaped nanostructure and rough surface of synthesized alumina are proposed to enhance Cr2O3 dispersion and catalyst stability. Lower support acidity is associated with better anti-coking ability.

答:本文探讨了氧化铝支撑的Cr2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的金属-支撑界面效应。结果显示,改变氧化铝支撑的煅烧温度可以调节其酸度,从而影响催化剂的稳定性和抗焦炭性。合成的棒状氧化铝纳米结构和粗糙表面有利于Cr2O3的分散,提高催化剂稳定性。支撑体酸度越低,抗焦炭性越好。

[1] "Herein, we investigated the relationship between the structure and preparation conditions of Al2O3 and focused on adjusting the acidity of alumina by varying the calcination temperature."

[2] "The calcination temperature played a crucial role in modifying the surface-physicochemical properties of alumina, subsequently affecting the catalytic activity."

[3] "The Cr-Al-800 catalyst exhibited excellent stability because of the inhibitory effect of low acidity toward side reactions and coke formation, thus leading to better anti-coking ability."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explores metal-support interfacial effects in alumina supported Cr2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that varying the calcination temperature of alumina supports modulates the surface acidity, which impacts catalytic activity and coke formation. The Cr-Al-800 catalyst with lower acidity exhibited better stability and anti-coking ability.
