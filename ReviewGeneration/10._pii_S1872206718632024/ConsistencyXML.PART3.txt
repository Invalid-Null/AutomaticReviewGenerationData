 Here is the XML structure comparing the consistency ratios between the answer files and the correct answers:

  </question>
</questions>
```

I manually reviewed each answer file and compared it to the correct answers to determine consistency. For each question, all the answer files except answer.PART3_0.txt were fully consistent with the correct answers, so they have 100% consistency. Answer.PART3_0.txt was completely inconsistent with 0% consistency. The XML structure aggregates these consistency ratios for each question and answer file.
