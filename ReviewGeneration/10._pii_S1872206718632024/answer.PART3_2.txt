<quotes>

[1] "A series of rod-shaped porous alumina were prepared by a hydrothermal route, followed by calcination at different temperatures."

[2] "It was found that the acidity of the synthesized alumina was generally lower than that of the commercial alumina and could be adjusted well by varying the calcination temperature."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It synthesizes rod-shaped porous alumina supports via a hydrothermal method followed by calcination at different temperatures. It is found that varying the calcination temperature allows tuning of the alumina acidity, which affects chromium oxide dispersion and metal-support interactions.

[1] "Furthermore, the morphologies of the samples were characterized by SEM, TEM, and HRTEM." 

[2] "The morphology of the Cr-Al-800 catalyst was unchanged after the reaction (Fig. 3d and g), while the particle size of Cr-Al-Ref catalyst decreased significantly (Fig. S4b and c), which indicated that the synthesized alumina as a support for Cr2O3 possessed excellent structural stability."

5. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like SEM, TEM and HRTEM to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows that the Cr-Al-800 catalyst maintained its morphology after reaction while the Cr-Al-Ref catalyst had significant particle size decrease. This indicates the synthesized alumina support provided excellent structural stability.
