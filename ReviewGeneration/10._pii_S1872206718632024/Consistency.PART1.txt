 Here is the comparison of the answer files to the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "80%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "0%"},
  "5": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "80%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I analyzed each answer file and compared it to the correct answers provided. I calculated the consistency percentage based on how closely the contents matched the correct answer. A percentage of 100% indicates the answer file matched the correct answer exactly. Lower percentages indicate more differences from the correct answer.
