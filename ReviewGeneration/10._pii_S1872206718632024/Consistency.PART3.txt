 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative files, I have compiled the following JSON structure with the consistency ratios for each question and file:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", 
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"
  },
  "3": {
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%"
  },
  "4": {
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"
  },
  "5": {
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%"
  },
  "6": {
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", 
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"
  },
  "7": {
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"
  }
}
```

I examined each question's correct answers and the corresponding answers from each file. I calculated the consistency ratio by comparing the content of the answers and judging if they conveyed the same information. The ratios are expressed as percentages, with 100% meaning completely consistent answers and 0% meaning completely inconsistent. Let me know if you have any other questions!
