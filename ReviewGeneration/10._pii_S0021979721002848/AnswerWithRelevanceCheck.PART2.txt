         The article does not compare the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts. It focuses only on bimetallic alloy catalysts.

         [1] "Platinum-based materials are well-known for exceptional performance in PDH process because of their superior activation of CH bonds [26]." 

         [2] "The GaPt@S-1 catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic performance with a high propene selectivity of 92.1% and propane dehydrogenation rate of 20.5 mol g1Pt h1 (corresponding to 45.9% propane conversion) at 600 C."

         [3] "It is clearly shown that the formation of GaPt alloy can significantly improve dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

         Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Ga bimetallic alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing the Pt-Ga catalyst has much higher activity and selectivity compared to Pt catalysts. A GaPt@S-1 catalyst achieved 92.1% propene selectivity and 45.9% propane conversion at 600°C.

         是的,文章评估了Pt-Ga双金属合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据表明,与Pt催化剂相比,Pt-Ga催化剂的活性和选择性要高得多。GaPt@S-1催化剂在600°C条件下达到了92.1%的丙烯选择性和45.9%的丙烷转化率。

         [1] "In the Ga 2p XPS spectrum of 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 (Fig. 2b), it can be fitted with two peaks at 1118.7 and 1117.9 eV, corresponding to the isolated GaIII sites and reduced Gaδ+, respectively [23], [44]. Thus it can be proposed that 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst contains GaPt alloy nanoclusters as well as a part of isolated GaIII sites."

         [2] "A small shift of binding energies in Pt 4f core levels to the higher binding energies for 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 (71.6 eV) can be found compared with 0.1Pt@S-1 (71.2 eV). The higher electron binding energy may be ascribed to the formation of GaPt alloy during the reduction process."

         [3] "Compared with 0.1Pt@S-1, these CO adsorption peaks are red-shifted to 2022 and 1995 cm-1 for 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1, which strongly suggests a higher surface electron density over the platinum atoms because of the electron donation from the Ga species."

      <English>
         Yes, the article investigates electronic effects of the secondary metal Ga in the GaPt bimetallic catalyst. XPS, IR, and other data indicate electron donation from Ga leading to higher electron density on Pt sites due to GaPt alloy formation, improving catalytic performance.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         是的,文章研究了GaPt双金属催化剂中次要金属Ga的电子效应。XPS、IR和其他数据表明,由于GaPt合金的形成,Ga发生了电子给予导致Pt位点上的电子密度更高,提高了催化性能。
