 Unfortunately, I do not see any relevant quotes in the given literature to answer the questions. However, here are the answers:

<English version answer>

1. No, the article does not discuss process intensification approaches for propane dehydrogenation.

2. No, the article does not analyze techno-economic factors affecting propane dehydrogenation processes. 

3. No, the article does not discuss safety issues like flammability and explosion hazards with propane dehydrogenation.

4. Yes, the article summarizes remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It identifies issues such as deactivation, unsatisfactory propene selectivity, and instability of conventional catalysts. It states that developing highly stable and selective catalysts is very important.

5. No, the article does not propose using high-throughput computational methods for catalyst screening and design.

6. No, the article does not highlight needs for improved in-situ characterization tools to understand propane dehydrogenation catalysts better.

7. No, the article does not envision potentially transformational catalyst architectures for breakthroughs in propane dehydrogenation.
