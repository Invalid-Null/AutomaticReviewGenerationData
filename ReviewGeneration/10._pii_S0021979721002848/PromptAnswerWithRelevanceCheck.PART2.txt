1. 文中没有比较金属和氧化支持金属催化剂的选择性配置文件。它只关注双金属合金催化剂。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "Alternatively, among various metal oxides (vanadium oxide [9], [10], [11], [12], zinc oxide [13], [14], [15], [16], gallium oxide [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], etc.) used in PDH, gallium oxide (GaOx) with low toxicity and low cost has been emerging as the promising candidate material in PDH process."

[2] "Platinum-based materials are well-known for exceptional performance in PDH process because of their superior activation of CH bonds [26]." 

[3] "Nevertheless, there is no report on the zeolite-encaged Ga-Pt bimetallic catalyst applied for PDH with excellent catalytic activity and stability, not mention to the study of the electronic effect of Ga-Pt bimetallic catalyst within zeolite for PDH reaction."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Ga bimetallic alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing the Pt-Ga catalyst has much higher activity and stability compared to monometallic Pt and Ga catalysts. 

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

2. 是的,文中评估了Pt-Ga双金属合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据表明,与单金属Pt和Ga催化剂相比,Pt-Ga催化剂的活性和稳定性要高得多。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "In the Ga 2p XPS spectrum of 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 (Fig. 2b), it can be fitted with two peaks at 1118.7 and 1117.9 eV, corresponding to the isolated GaIII sites and reduced Gaδ+, respectively [23], [44]. Thus it can be proposed that 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst contains GaPt alloy nanoclusters as well as a part of isolated GaIII sites."

[2] "Compared with 0.1Pt@S-1, these CO adsorption peaks are red-shifted to 2022 and 1995 cm−1 for 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1, which strongly suggests a higher surface electron density over the platinum atoms because of the electron donation from the Ga species. The modification of electronic structure in GaPt@S-1 is consistent with XPS results showing a more electron-rich Pt surface."

[3] "It seems that the electronic effects of GaPt alloy in 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst tend to reduce the interaction between propene and catalyst, thereby reducing the adsorption capacity of propene [52]."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic effects of the Ga in the Pt-Ga bimetallic catalyst. It provides XPS, IR, and TPD data showing electron donation from Ga causes higher electron density on Pt sites, which weakens adsorption of products like propene and improves catalytic performance.

</English version answer>

3. 是的,文中研究了Ga在Pt-Ga双金属催化剂中的电子效应。XPS、IR和TPD数据表明,Ga的电子给予导致Pt位点上的电子密度更高,这削弱了丙烯等产物的吸附,改善了催化性能。
