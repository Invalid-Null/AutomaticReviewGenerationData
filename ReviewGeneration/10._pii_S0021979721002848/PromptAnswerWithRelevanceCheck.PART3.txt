 Unfortunately this literature does not contain relevant information to answer the provided questions. The article focuses on propane dehydrogenation catalysts based on gallium and platinum, but does not discuss other topics like reactor types or advanced characterization techniques in detail. Since there are no relevant quotes from the literature, I will briefly summarize why each question cannot be answered:

<quotes>
No relevant quotes
</quotes>

<English version answer>

1. The article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It focuses on catalysts containing gallium and platinum nanoparticles, not single sites.

2. The article does not evaluate different metal encapsulation methods. It only studies one method of encapsulating gallium and platinum in zeolite. 

3. The article does not compare different catalyst preparation methods. It only uses one hydrothermal synthesis approach.

4. The article does not utilize in-situ characterization techniques to study working catalysts. It only uses ex-situ techniques like XRD, XPS, etc.

5. The article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces. It uses standard TEM imaging.

6. The article does not use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during catalysis. It only uses techniques like XRD and XPS to study fresh vs spent catalysts. 

7. The article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation. It only studies a fixed bed reactor setup.

8. The article does not provide insights into these specific topics related to propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It focuses on the catalyst composition and performance evaluation.
