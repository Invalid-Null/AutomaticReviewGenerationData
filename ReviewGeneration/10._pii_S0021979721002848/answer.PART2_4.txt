 Unfortunately, this literature review does not contain enough relevant information to sufficiently answer any of the questions asked. The article focuses on the development of Ga-Pt bimetallic nanoclusters confined within silicalite-1 zeolite for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide comparisons to other catalyst compositions or supports that would be needed to address the questions.

<English version answer>
1. The article does not compare selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts.

2. The article evaluates Ga-Pt bimetallic catalysts, but does not provide comparisons to other Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn, Pt-Zn.

3. The article does not investigate electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in depth beyond noting increased electron density of Pt.

4. The article does not explore the use of subsurface promoters like Re or Mn.

5. The article does not describe any synergistic effects between metals attributed to ensemble and/or ligand effects. 

6. The article focuses only on silicalite-1 and does not evaluate other zeolite supports.

7. The article does not investigate effects of varying Si/Al ratio or mesoporosity.

1. 该文献没有比较金属型与氧化型载体金属催化剂的选择性谱。

2. 该文献评价了Ga-Pt双金属催化剂,但没有提供与其他Pt合金催化剂(如Pt-Sn,Pt-Zn)的比较。

3. 该文献没有深入研究二金属的电子和几何效应,只是简单提到Pt的电子密度增加。

4. 该文献没有探讨使用Re或Mn等下层促进剂。

5. 该文献没有描述归因于配位Ensemble和/或配体效应的两金属之间的协同效应。

6. 该文献仅关注硅沸石,没有评价其他沸石载体。 

7. 该文献没有研究改变硅铝比或引入介孔对丙脱氢催化剂性能的影响。
