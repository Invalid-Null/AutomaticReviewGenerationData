Sub-nanometer Pt2In3 intermetallics as ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095495623002474

AbstractAbstract
Pt-based catalysts are the typical industrial catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which still suffer from insufficient long-term durability due to the structural instability and coke deposition. A commercial γ-Al2O3 supported thermally robust sub-nanometer Pt2In3 intermetallic catalyst with atomically ordered structure and rigorously separated Pt single atoms was fabricated, which showed outstanding robustness in 240 h long-term operation at 600 °C with the deactivation rate constant kd as low as 0.00078 h−1, ranking among the lowest reported values. Based on various in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, it was proved that the catalyst stability not only resulted from the separated Pt single-atom sites but also significantly affected by the distance of adjacent Pt atoms. An increasing distance to 3.25 Å in the Pt2In3 could induce a weak π-adsorption configuration of propylene on Pt sites, which facilitated the desorption of propylene and restrained the side reactions like coking.

The excellent stability of the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 catalyst is originated from the enlarged distance of adjacent Pt atoms in its Pt2In3 intermetallic nanoparticles, which could induce the weak Π-adsorption mode of the product C3H6 on the Pt sites.

1. Introduction
With the ever-increasing market demands for propene and the revolution of shale gas feedstocks, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as an on purpose technique, has drown a great attention in recent years and gradually been developed as a promising complementarity for the supply of propylene [1], [2], [3]. Pt-based catalysts are widely used in this reaction due to its high activity in C–H scission and relatively low capability in C–C cleavage [4], [5]. However, since the high endothermicity of the PDH reaction (
 = 124.3 kJ mol−1), an elevated operating temperature (>600 °C) is required to obtain sufficient propylene yield [6], which simultaneously favors the occurrence of side reactions and nanoparticle sintering, causing great damage for the selectivity and stability of the catalysts. From a fundamental perspective, the side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, and deep dehydrogenation to coke, are believed to be structure-sensitive reactions, only happening on particles with adjacent Pt segments, whereas the PDH is a structure-insensitive process, which could occur on isolated Pt sites [7]. Therefore, separating the PtPt ensembles to create Pt single atoms is considered to be efficient methodologies to circumvent the selectivity and coke issues.
To make the active Pt species apart, some researches attempted to construct Pt1M single atom catalysts, such as PtCu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst [8], [PtZn4] single-site catalyst [9] and (SiOZn)4−6Pt ensemble catalyst [10], trying to dilute Pt with excess inert metal promoters. Furthermore, a series of thermodynamically more stable intermetallic alloy with atomic ordered structure to separate Pt atoms were also developed, such as Pt3Y/mz-deGa materials [11] to alloy Pt with the isolated rare-earth atoms located in the Ga-removal MFI zeolite, Pt3Ga intermetallics [12] doubly decorated with Pb and Ca, and (PtCoCu) (GeGaSn)/CaSiO2 high-entropy intermetallic (HEI) catalyst [13], replacing partial Pt and Ge atoms in the PtGe parent intermetallics with four other constituent metals. Consequently, these intermetallic materials performed well in inhibiting coke generation and particle agglomeration upon PDH conditions. However, the above work involved complicated multi-elements addition and/or support pretreatment strategies for tailoring the property of the active sites. Furthermore, it still remains ambiguous how far should the adjacent Pt atoms be separated for PDH application.
Most recently, Duan’s group found that the distance of adjacent Pd atoms essentially determined the reaction pathways towards acetylene semi-hydrogenation or coupling after exploring the catalytic behaviors of diverse PdIn intermetallic compounds with distinguished distances between adjacent Pd atoms [14]. Accordingly, Pt and In could also form different intermetallic phases indicated by the PtIn phase diagram [15], which made the PtIn system an ideal candidate for modulating the distance between adjacent Pt atoms and investigating the effect of the distances on the catalytic properties in PDH, considering the fact that In can also be used as a promoter [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], like Cu [8], Zn [23], [24], [25], Ga [26], [27], Sn [28], [29], [30], etc., for regulating the PDH performance of Pt. Nevertheless, the previous studies on the PtIn catalysts resulted in short reaction life and fast deactivation due to the lack of suitable supports for the control of both the sizes and compsitions of the PtIn nanoparticles.
It has been reported that nanoparticulated support has positive effects on promoting the dispersion of metal atoms by providing sufficient surface area [31] and alleviating the nanoparticle sintering by supporting limited amount of metal atoms on individual support particles [32]. Herein, sub-nanometer Pt2In3 intermetallics supported on commercial nano-grade γ-Al2O3 were fabricated for the PDH reaction and characterized by the aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-HAADF-STEM), in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy by using CO as the probe molecule (CO-DRIFTS). The unique sub-nanometer Pt2In3 intermetallics sample exhibited an extremely stable behavior with the deactivation rate constant (kd) of 0.00078 h−1 during the 240 h test, ranked one of the most stable catalysts among state-of-the-art reports, while the PtIn with other structures (random alloy or Pt3In intermetallic) displayed a declined activity with time on stream. Via the analysis of density functional theory (DFT), the distances of adjacent Pt atoms in different catalysts were identified, demonstrating the significant impact of the distance on the PDH performance.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The series of PtIn/Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized by an industrially favorable co-impregnation method. Typically, 0.5 g of commercial nano-Al2O3 (Aladdin, γ phase, 10 nm) was impregnated with a mixture of 0.25 mL of In2(NO3)3·xH2O aqueous solution (69.9 mgIn mL−1) and 0.166 mL of H2PtCl6·6H2O aqueous solution (15.0 mgPt mL−1). Subsequently, the resultant paste was dried at 60 °C overnight, and then calcined at 500 °C for 4 h in the muffle furnace. The as-prepared catalyst was named as 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 (0.5 and 3.5 refer to the weight percent of Pt and In, respectively). Other samples with different loadings of In were synthesized following the same way.
2.2. Characterization methods
2.2.1. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry
The loadings of both Pt and In in the as-prepared samples were measured by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES; Thermo IRIS Intrepid II XSP, Thermo Electron Co).
2.2.2. Temperature-programmed experiments
All the temperature-programmed experiments were performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 apparatus. For the H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) tests, 100 mg of sample was heated to 150 °C for 1 h and cooled down to −30 °C in the flow of Ar and then reduced in a stream of 10 vol% H2/Ar at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 up to 800 °C.
2.2.3. CO-pulse chemisorption experiments
The CO-pulse chemisorption experiments, which were applied for estimating the dispersion of Pt in the samples, were performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 apparatus. 100 mg of the sample was packed into a U-shaped quartz tube, after being pretreated with 10 vol% H2/Ar at 600 °C for 1.5 h, the sample was cooled down to 50 °C. Then a pulse of 10 vol% CO/He was repeatedly introduced to the system until the chemisorption of CO was saturated. The adsorption stoichiometry of Pt/CO was assumed to be 1:1 for the calculation of Pt dispersion.
2.2.4. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy
The electron microscopy measurements were performed on the JEOL JEM-2100F microscope operating at 200 kV and the JEOL JEM-ARM200F equipped with a CEOS probe corrector for particle size distribution statistics and atomically resolved images, respectively. Before the AC-HAADF-STEM measurements, the samples were pretreated in 20 vol% H2/He at 600 °C for 1.5 h, and then cooled down to room temperature for the course of passion using 2 vol% O2/He gas. Consequently, the powder was dispersed in alcohol by ultrasonic and dropped on the copper grid.
2.2.5. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), including X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra, were performed at the 1W1B, Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), China and the BL14W1, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), China [33] for the data collection of Pt L3-edge and In K-edge, respectively, using Si (111) and Si (311)-crystal monochromators for energy selection. The Pt L3-edge spectra were recorded quasi in situ at room temperature in the fluorescence mode, based on the energy calibration of Pt foil. The samples were pretreated in 20 vol% H2/He at 600 °C for 1.5 h and then cooled down to room temperature, after that, the catalyst powder was pressed into tablets and sealed in the Kapton packs for air isolation in glove box. The In K-edge spectra were collected in situ due to its highly sensitive property to oxygen. The optimized amount of sample powder was loaded into a tubular reactor designed for transmission mode. In a typical procedure, the sample was heated to 600 °C (10 °C min−1) in 20 vol% H2/Ar for in situ reduction for 1.5 h and then cooled down to room temperature for the reduction data collection. Subsequently, the sample was heated to 600 °C again for reaction and then cooled to room temperature for the reaction data collection. Additionally, the whole courses of reduction and reaction at 600 °C were also recorded. The data were analyzed by the Athena software packages [34].
2.2.6. In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
In situ XPS spectra were collected on a ThermoFisher Excalab 250Xi + instrument. The binding energy of Pt and In species in the samples were calibrated by the adventitious carbon (C 1s peak at 284.6 eV). The as-prepared samples were reduced in 20 vol% H2/Ar at 600 °C for 1.5 h and then reacted in 14 vol% H2 and 14 vol% C3H8 (balance with Ar) in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV)-connected high-pressure gas chamber. After the pretreatment, the samples were transferred to the analyzer chamber under UHV conditions.
2.2.7. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy
In situ CO-DRIFTS were collected by an infrared spectrometer (Vertex 70, Bruker), equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride detector in the range 400–4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. The measurements were carried out at room temperature under ambient pressure. In a typical procedure, the sample was packed into a sample cell (HC-500, Pike technologies) and reduced firstly in 20 vol% H2/Ar gas stream (20 mL/min) at 600 °C for 1.5 h. After Ar purging for 10 min, the reaction gas (volume ratio: C3H8:H2:Ar = 14:14:72) was introduced into the cell for reacting 10 min or 1 h. When the system was cooled down to room temperature under Ar stream (20 mL min−1), the background spectrum was collected. Subsequently, 5 vol% CO/He gas stream (20 mL min−1) was introduced into the sample cell, followed by purging with pure He (20 mL min−1). The adsorption of CO molecules on the surface of the catalysts was monitored continuously until no obvious change in intensity.
2.3. Theoretical calculation methods
All DFT calculations were performed by using the plane wave Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [35], where electron–ion interaction was represented by the projector augmented wave pseudopotential [36] with the cut-off energy of Ecut = 400 eV. Exchange-correlation energies utilized were the spin-polarized GGA-PBE [37]. The first Brillion zone k-point sampling utilized the 2 × 2 × 1 gamma-centered mesh grid. The energy and force criterion for convergence of the electron density and structure optimization were set at 10−5 eV and −0.02 eV Å−1, respectively.
We calculated the adsorption energies of the product C3H6 and the further dehydrogenation barriers on the surfaces of the catalysts during the reaction. There were more calculation details: a four-layer slab model with a 20 Å vacuum region was used to represent the Pt2In3 (110) and Pt3In (111) surfaces whose bottom two layers were fixed to their crystal lattice positions while the others were relaxed. The transition states were obtained using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method by relaxing the force below 0.05 eV Å−1, which was further confirmed by the only one imaginary frequency.
2.4. Reaction tests
PDH reaction was carried out in a quartz fix-bed reactor, with 10 mm in diameter and 200 mm in length. All tests were performed in a feed gas composition of 14 vol% C3H8, 14 vol% H2 and 72 vol% He (30 mL/min) under ambient pressure at 600 °C unless otherwise stated. Typically, 100 mg of the catalyst was loaded to the tubular reactor, and then heated to 600 °C (10 °C min−1) for 1.5 h in a flow of 20 vol% H2/He. After purging with pure He for 10 min, the reaction gas was introduced into the reactor. The products were analyzed using an online GC (Agilent Technologies 6890 N) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The propane conversion, propylene selectivity and the productivity were obtained by the following equations.

3. Results and discussion
Four samples were obtained with a fixed Pt loading of 0.5 wt% and the amount of In varied from 0.5 wt% to 4 wt%, denoted as 0.5PtxIn/Al2O3 (x = 0.5, 2, 3.5, 4). These catalysts performed rather differently in PDH reaction, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). For the 0.5Pt0.5In/Al2O3 sample, it displayed a relatively high activity at first with the conversion reached 45%, and then deactivated rapidly with time on stream. With a higher In content, the 0.5Pt2In/Al2O3 sample exhibited improved catalytic activity and stability with an initial conversion up to 50.6% and a moderate deactivation rate. Surprisingly, as for the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 sample, it demonstrated an extremely stable feature with an acceptable conversion remained at around 20%. While further increasing the loading of In to 4 wt%, the excellent stable property was preserved but the activity declined slightly. Given the fact that the propylene separation process in industrial manufacture is energy-intensive, catalysts with steady propylene yield rather than high but fluctuant performance is much more favorable, therefore, the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 sample was deemed to be the optimal catalyst.

The 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 catalyst could work continuously for 240 h at 600 °C upon the PDH reaction without obviously deactivation (Fig. 1b), with the deactivation rate constant kd value as low as 0.00078 h−1, presenting as an unique ultra-stable material among the reported results in the literatures (Fig. 1c). Moreover, it remained its high durability with time on stream in continuously repeated regeneration process despite a slight decline in the initial activity (Fig. S1c), which was much superior to the control samples (0.5Pt0.5In/Al2O3, 0.5Pt2In/Al2O3 and 0.5Pt4In/Al2O3) in Fig. S1(a, b, and d). Meanwhile, the catalyst displayed good stability under industrially relevant operation conditions (without He dilution) (Fig. S2) and exhibited a wide temperature operation window from 550 to 620 °C, in which the catalyst could always performed in a stable manner (Fig. 1d).
In order to explore the exact alloy structure of the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 catalyst, we applied the AC-HAADF-STEM to reveal its atomic configuration and composition. It could be seen from Fig. 2(a) that the nanoparticles were presented with ordered atomic arrangement and there were substantially residual In atoms dispersed on the support in the form of single atoms after reduction (Figs. S3 and S4). Further energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) measurements proved that the nanoparticles were consisted of both Pt and In atoms (Fig. S5) with a similar atomic ratio of 2/3 in terms of Pt to In (Fig. S6), suggesting a certain intermetallic compound with fixed element proportion might be formed. Subsequently, the crystal phase comparison and identification were completed to verify this speculation. As expected, by treating the nanoparticles with fast Fourier transforming (FFT), it was found that the superlattice diffraction patterns were highly consistent with that of the Pt2In3 intermetallic compound, with the atomic plane distance measured around 2.21 Å and the angle between the crystal faces determined to be ∼57.8°, agreed well with the lattice spacing of the intermetallic Pt2In3 along with [1 1 0] direction (Fig. 2b and Fig. S7). Therefore, it could be inferred that the nanoparticles in 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 catalyst were made of Pt2In3 intermetallics.

HAADF-STEM images and the corresponding histograms of metal nanoparticle size distributions of the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 after reduction (d, g), reaction for 240 h (e, h), and regeneration for 3 times (f, i).
Remarkably, the results of the FFT analyses and the EDS measurements also demonstrated that the Pt2In3 intermetallic nanoparticles displayed excellent phase retainment after PDH reaction for 240 h, with a consistent atomic ratio of Pt to In as 2/3 among all the nanoparticles selected randomly (Figs. S8–S10). Meanwhile, the morphology and particle size distributions of the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 catalyst after reaction and three consecutive regenerations were examined as well. Consequently, it showed no tendency of particle size enlargement after reaction for 240 h with the average grain size kept at ∼0.86 nm (Fig. 2d, g, e, and h and Fig. S11 and Fig. S12), and the mean particle size after three regeneration courses was merely increased to 0.92 nm (Fig. 2f and i) without any aggregated large nanoparticles (Fig. S13), as further evidenced by the XRD (Fig. S14). On the other hand, although the nanoparticles grew slightly after one-cycle reaction in the 0.5Pt0.5In/Al2O3 (1.35–1.39 nm) (Fig. S15, S16) and 0.5Pt2In/Al2O3 (1.05–1.13 nm) (Figs. S17 and Fig. S18) catalysts, they sintered severely after recycling for three times with plenty of nanoparticles with the sizes of more than 10 nm (Figs. S19 and Fig. S20).
In order to acquire the valence state and local structure information in bulk, we conducted the XAS measurements, including the XANES and EXAFS spectra (Figs. S21–S32), after reduction and PDH reaction at both the L3-edge of Pt and the K-edge of In. The white line intensity of Pt L3-edge resulted in a decreased tendency as increasing amount of In (Fig. S21), pointing to the stronger electron interactions between Pt and In for the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 sample. The EXAFS spectra (Fig. 3c) and the data fitting results (Table 1 and Fig. S26) showed that it appeared two Pt-In bonds at the distance of 2.62 and 2.73 Å [21], [38] for the optimal 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 sample, with coordination numbers were both around 0.9, whereas there were both PtPt bond and PtIn bond existed in the 0.5Pt0.5In/Al2O3 and 0.5Pt2In/Al2O3 samples (Table 1). Accordingly, the atomic configuration of the Pt2In3 intermetallics presents one PtIn bond at 2.75 Å, three Pt-In bonds at 2.82 Å and four Pt-In bonds at 2.88 Å, respectively (Fig. 2c and Table S2). Therefore, if we regard the coordination of In atoms at 2.75 and 2.82 Å as the same condition, then the final approximate results are supposed to be 4 of Pt-In bonds at ∼2.75 and 2.88 Å, respectively, with the coordination number ratio of the two PtIn bonds to be 1, which was quite in accordance with the realistic fitting results (0.9/0.9 = 1). Additionally, the actual bond distances were shorter than the theoretical values owning to the lattice contraction in the sub-nanometric particles [39]. Thus, combined with the FFT analysis of the nanoparticles above (Fig. 2b), it could be confirmed that the optimal 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 sample was composed of the atomic ordered Pt2In3 intermetallic nanoparticles.

N, the coordination number for each absorber-backscatter pair. R, the average distance between absorber and backscatter atoms. σ2, the Debye-Waller factor. ΔE0, the inner potential correction. The accuracies of the above parameters were defined as N, ±20%; R, ±1%. The S02 was set as 0.74 and 0.77, which was corrected by fitting the Pt and Sn foil references, respectively. The Δk (3.0–11.9 Å−1 for Pt and 3.0–10.8 Å−1 for In) and ΔR (1.2–3.0 Å for Pt and 1.1–3.0 Å for In) were the data ranges applied for data fitting in k-space and R-space, respectively.
After the PDH reaction, it was obvious that there displayed little fluctuation in the spectrum of the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 sample, whereas the profiles of the 0.5Pt0.5In/Al2O3 and 0.5Pt2In/Al2O3 samples varied a lot after the PDH reaction for only 1 h, as shown at the L3-edge of Pt in the XANES (Fig. 3a) and EXAFS spectra (Fig. 3c). In details, it appeared that the coordination environment kept unchanged in the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 catalyst during the PDH process, even after the reaction time prolonged for 15 h, manifesting the great structural retainment of Pt2In3 intermetallics in the nanoparticles (Table 1 and Figs. S27 and S28), which quite agreed with the AC-HAADF-STEM results. Oppositely, the coordination number ratio of the PtPt bond to PtIn bond (NPt−Pt/NPt−In) increased from 2.8 to 5.7 for the 0.5Pt0.5In/Al2O3 catalyst and from 0.8 to 2.4 for the 0.5Pt2In/Al2O3 sample (Table 1 and Figs. S22−S25), implying the Pt atoms experienced further aggregation during the reaction. Given the fact that the ratio in the regular Pt3In intermetallics is 2 (Fig. S29), it was speculated that the nanoparticles were reorganized from the original random alloy to the Pt3In for the 0.5Pt2In/Al2O3 sample, which was also happened on other PtM systems [40], [41]. Besides, the in situ XANES (Fig. 3b and Figs. S30 and S32) and EXAFS (Fig. 3d) profiles at the In K-edge of the samples showed the same trend with the L3 edge of Pt. The fitting results (Table 1) illustrated that the InO bond became dominated in the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 sample (1.4 for InO bond vs. 0.8 for In–Pt bond), which was consistent with the monodisperse state of the In atoms on the support as illustrated by the AC-HAADF-STEM results. While the coordination numbers of InPt bonds in 0.5Pt0.5In/Al2O3 and 0.5Pt2In/Al2O3 samples were excess/comparable to those of the InO bonds, indicating most of the In were linked with Pt atoms.
The in situ XPS was carried out to test the surface property of the catalysts before and after the PDH process. The results of the Pt 4d spectra (Fig. 4a and b) showed that both the Pt species were in metallic state [42], [43] in the 0.5Pt0.5In/Al2O3 and 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 samples with the binding energy at 314.6 and 314.4 eV, respectively. That is, the binding energy of the latter catalyst was 0.2 eV lower than that of the former sample after reduction, indicating the more electronic transformation from Pt to In in the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 sample due to the formation of the Pt2In3, which was in line with the Pt L3-edge XANES results. Furthermore, it remained consistently at 314.4 eV after the feed gas treatments for the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 sample, which further evidenced the formation of the structurally stable Pt2In3 intermetallics, whereas the binding energy was dropped by 0.3 eV after the PDH process for the 0.5Pt0.5In/Al2O3 sample, due to the structural reorganization during the reaction, as demonstrated by the XAS results. As for the chemical state of In, it could be seen that there were no obvious changes after reaction as well for the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 sample (Fig. 4c). Moreover, the valence of In in the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 sample was 0.2 eV higher than that in the 0.5Pt0.5In/Al2O3 sample (444.7 vs. 444.5 eV) (Fig. 4c and Fig. S33), indicating there were more In3+ species [44], [45] consisted in the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 catalyst, which agreed well with the fitting results at the K-edge of In (Table 1) and the H2-TPR results (Fig. S34 and Table S3). Thus, these characterization results indicated together that the In species preferred to interact with Pt to form PtIn alloy when the content of In was low, while the InOx species appeared with the increasing amount of In. Both the excessively InOx species on the support with intimate interaction with the Pt and the metallic In in the PtIn alloy could donate electron to Pt, and contributed to the electron-rich state of Pt in the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 sample.

To further illustrate the surficial structure of the samples, the CO-DRIFTS examinations were carried out. The 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 displayed two main adsorption bands at 2060 cm−1 and at the range of 2000–1960 cm−1, with the former assigned to the CO linearly adsorbed on the Pt sites in PtIn alloy [23], [46] and the latter broad band attributed to the bridged CO adsorption at the PtInOx interface [47], [48], which further explained the electronic donation effect of the InOx species to Pt. Besides, it was reported that the partially reduced promoter, such as CuOx [49], AgOx [50], NiOx [51], and GaOx [52], could act as the nano-glue between particles and the support for inhibiting nanoparticles sintering. Therefore, it was inferred that the excess PtInOx interface in the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 sample might also play crucial roles in the excellent particle size control during the repeated regeneration process of the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 sample (Fig. 2f, and i, and Figs. S19 and S20). After the in situ feed gas treatment at 600 °C, it showed no change in terms of the relative intensities of the CO adsorption bands at the alloy sites and the interface sites for the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 sample (Fig. 4f), greatly matched with the HAADF-STEM, XAS and XPS results above, confirming the robust structure stability from surface to bulk of the Pt2In3. On the contrast, the profiles of the 0.5Pt0.5In/Al2O3 and 0.5Pt2In/Al2O3 samples displayed relatively improved intensity of the alloy band at 2060 cm−1 after in situ reaction for merely 10 min or prolonged to 1 h (Fig. 4d and e), suggesting the further reorganization of Pt and In, which was in line with the EXAFS fitting results. Besides, the consequence of the dropped intensity of the alloy band in 0.5Pt0.5In/Al2O3 sample in the next 1 h might attribute to the coke block on the Pt sites (Fig. 4d) [53], while the coke on the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 catalyst merely deposited on the Al2O3 support, indicated by the maximum value of the first derivative of the weight loss curve (nearly 600 °C) (Fig. S35) and the mass spectrometry signal profiles of the CO and CO2 analyzed by the thermogravimetric mass spectrometry (TG-MS) (Fig. S36).
As it is well known that, the selectivity of propylene versus coking during PDH was determined primilarily by the competition of the desorption and dehydrogenation of propylene [13], which were then explored in our research with the aid of DFT calculations. Here, the mostly exposed (110) surface of the Pt2In3 intermetallics, confirmed by AC-HAADF-STEM (Fig. 2b), was chosen as the model for 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Pt3In (111) was used to representing the 0.5Pt2In/Al2O3 catalyst. The underlying cause for C3H6 generation was investigated by comparing the C3H6 adsorption energies on the Pt2In3 (110) and Pt3In (111) surfaces in terms of the possible adsorption geometries. To consider the possible contribution of entopy, the Gibbs free energy for C3H6 adsorption was also estimated at a elevated temeprature under the atmosphere presure (Fig. S37). It was found that only the weak π-adsorption of C3H6 occurred on Pt2In3 (110) with a negligible adsorption energy (−0.02 eV), and the contribution of entropy from the gaseous C3H6 would promote the desorption of C3H6 on the PtIn surfaces by a linear relationship with the reaction temperature. Whereas a di-σ adsorption configuration was more favored on Pt3In (111) as indicated by the much larger adsorption energy compared with the π-adsorption (−0.69 vs. −0.48 eV) (Fig. 5a and Table S4). Obviously, the desorption of propylene on Pt2In3 (110) was greatly improved, and the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene was much higher (1.17 eV) with an endothermic energy of 0.74 eV at the reaction contions (Fig. 5b and Fig. S38 and Fig. S39), indicating that the desorption of C3H6 was much favorable on the Pt2In3 catalyst while the further dehydrogenation to coke can be effectively alleviated. In fact, it could be seen from the atomic configurations in Fig. S40 that the shortest distance between the adjacent Pt atoms in Pt2In3 (110) was 3.25 Å, while it remained around 2.85 Å in Pt3In (111). Thus, an enlarged distance between adjacent Pt atoms could lead to the π-adsorption mode of propylene which facilitated the desorption of propylene.

4. Conclusions
By utilizing the commercial γ-Al2O3 as the support, a sub-nanometer Pt2In3 intermetallics assembled catalyst was synthesized with highly thermal-stability structure and rigorous separation of individual Pt atoms, which are less capable of triggering side reactions and hardly to aggregate. Combined with the nanoparticle-anchoring effect of the substantial PtInOx interface structure, the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 sample eventually achieved the ultra-steady performance. Further DFT calculations demonstrated that compared with the Pt3In intermetallics, the sufficiently enlarged distance between the Pt atoms in Pt2In3 intermetallics could effectively promote the desorption of the as-generated propylene and prohibit the deep dehydrogenation of C3H6* by only interacting with propylene in a weak π-adsorption configuration. The concept of distance-induced stability improvement in PDH process, which was established in this study exposes a new horizon to further enhance the catalytic performance of intermetallics utilization in alkane dehydrogenation.
