[1] "Pt-based catalysts are the typical industrial catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which still suffer from insufficient long-term durability due to the structural instability and coke deposition."

[2] "Therefore, separating the PtPt ensembles to create Pt single atoms is considered to be efficient methodologies to circumvent the selectivity and coke issues."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It notes that Pt-based catalysts are typical industrial PDH catalysts, but they still suffer from insufficient long-term durability due to structural instability and coking (Quote 1). The article investigates separating Pt ensembles into isolated Pt single atoms to address selectivity and coking issues (Quote 2).

[1] "Remarkably, the results of the FFT analyses and the EDS measurements also demonstrated that the Pt2In3 intermetallic nanoparticles displayed excellent phase retainment after PDH reaction for 240 h, with a consistent atomic ratio of Pt to In as 2/3 among all the nanoparticles selected randomly (Figs. S8S10)." 

[2] "Meanwhile, the morphology and particle size distributions of the 0.5Pt3.5In/Al2O3 catalyst after reaction and three consecutive regenerations were examined as well. Consequently, it showed no tendency of particle size enlargement after reaction for 240 h with the average grain size kept at 0.86 nm (Fig. 2d, g, e, and h and Fig. S11 and Fig. S12), and the mean particle size after three regeneration courses was merely increased to 0.92 nm (Fig. 2f and i) without any aggregated large nanoparticles (Fig. S13), as further evidenced by the XRD (Fig. S14)."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of the supported Pt-In intermetallic nanoparticle catalysts. It shows the Pt2In3 nanoparticles maintained their size, shape and phase after 240 hours of reaction, with no significant particle aggregation or growth (Quote 1). After multiple regeneration cycles, the average particle size increased only slightly, from 0.86 to 0.92 nm, indicating excellent stability (Quote 2).

[1] "To make the active Pt species apart, some researches attempted to construct Pt1M single atom catalysts, such as PtCu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst [8], [PtZn4] single-site catalyst [9] and (SiOZn)46Pt ensemble catalyst [10], trying to dilute Pt with excess inert metal promoters."

[2] "Furthermore, a series of thermodynamically more stable intermetallic alloy with atomic ordered structure to separate Pt atoms were also developed, such as Pt3Y/mz-deGa materials [11] to alloy Pt with the isolated rare-earth atoms located in the Ga-removal MFI zeolite, Pt3Ga intermetallics [12] doubly decorated with Pb and Ca, and (PtCoCu) (GeGaSn)/CaSiO2 high-entropy intermetallic (HEI) catalyst [13], replacing partial Pt and Ge atoms in the PtGe parent intermetallics with four other constituent metals."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes diluting Pt atoms with other metals to create isolated single atom Pt sites as a strategy to improve propane dehydrogenation catalysts (Quote 1). It also describes developing more thermally stable intermetallic alloys with ordered atomic structures to separate Pt atoms and prevent sintering (Quote 2). These approaches aim to prevent unwanted side reactions like coking which occur on Pt ensemble sites.
