         [1] "Pt-based catalysts are typically used in propane dehydrogenation reactions due to their high activity for C-H bond scission and relatively low activity for C-C bond cleavage."

         [2] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in this reaction due to its high activity in CH scission and relatively low capability in CC cleavage."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
The article explains that Pt-based catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by selectively activating C-H bonds over C-C bonds, resulting in dehydrogenation instead of cracking. The specific mechanism described is that Pt catalysts preferentially break CH bonds over CC bonds.

         [1] "Since the high endothermicity of the PDH reaction (ΔH = 124.3 kJ mol−1), an elevated operating temperature (>600 °C) is required to obtain sufficient propylene yield."

         [2] "From a fundamental perspective, the side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, and deep dehydrogenation to coke, are believed to be structure-sensitive reactions, only happening on particles with adjacent Pt segments, whereas the PDH is a structure-insensitive process, which could occur on isolated Pt sites."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is structure-insensitive and can occur on isolated Pt sites, while side reactions like cracking and coking are structure-sensitive and require adjacent Pt ensembles. It also notes the high endothermicity of PDH necessitates high reaction temperatures, providing some thermodynamic details.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
该文献讨论了丙烷脱氢不敏感结构,可以发生在隔离的Pt位点上,而像裂化和结焦等副反应敏感结构,需要相邻的Pt集合体。它还注意到PDH的高吸热性需要高反应温度,提供了一些热力学细节。

         [1] Therefore, separating the PtPt ensembles to create Pt single atoms is considered to be efficient methodologies to circumvent the selectivity and coke issues.
         
         [2] It was proved that the catalyst stability not only resulted from the separated Pt single-atom sites but also significantly affected by the distance of adjacent Pt atoms.
         
         [3] An increasing distance to 3.25 Å in the Pt2In3 could induce a weak π-adsorption configuration of propylene on Pt sites, which facilitated the desorption of propylene and restrained the side reactions like coking.

      <English>
The article describes computational and experimental work identifying that separating Pt atoms and increasing distance between them correlates with improved propane dehydrogenation performance by weakening propylene adsorption strength and restraining coke formation. A Pt-In intermetallic with 3.25 Angstrom Pt-Pt distance demonstrated excellent stability.
