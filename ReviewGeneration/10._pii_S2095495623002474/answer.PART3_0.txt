[1] "By utilizing the commercial γ-Al2O3 as the support, a sub-nanometer Pt2In3 intermetallics assembled catalyst was synthesized with highly thermal-stability structure and rigorous separation of individual Pt atoms, which are less capable of triggering side reactions and hardly to aggregate."

[2] "Further DFT calculations demonstrated that compared with the Pt3In intermetallics, the sufficiently enlarged distance between the Pt atoms in Pt2In3 intermetallics could effectively promote the desorption of the as-generated propylene and prohibit the deep dehydrogenation of C3H6* by only interacting with propylene in a weak π-adsorption configuration."
