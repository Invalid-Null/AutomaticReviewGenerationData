[1] Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn great attention in recent years and gradually been developed as a promising complementarity for the supply of propylene. [2] Pt-based catalysts are widely used in this reaction due to its high activity in CH scission and relatively low capability in CC cleavage. 

[3] PDH is believed to be a structure-insensitive process, which could occur on isolated Pt sites.

[4] The first Brillion zone k-point sampling utilized the 2 × 2 × 1 gamma-centered mesh grid. The energy and force criterion for convergence of the electron density and structure optimization were set at 105 eV and 0.02 eV Å1, respectively.

[5] We calculated the adsorption energies of the product C3H6 and the further dehydrogenation barriers on the surfaces of the catalysts during the reaction.
