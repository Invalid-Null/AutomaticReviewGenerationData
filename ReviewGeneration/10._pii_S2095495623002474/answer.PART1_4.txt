 Unfortunately this literature does not seem to be very relevant for answering the questions asked. It focuses on Pt-In intermetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and does not evaluate metal oxide catalysts or supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir. Since the questions are specifically asking about those types of catalysts, I cannot provide substantive quotes or answers. The paper does not investigate tuning of metal oxide properties, propose mechanisms over metal oxides, explore metal-support effects with metal oxides, evaluate supported metals like Pt or Pd, or discuss effects of particle size/shape and support interactions for those metals. My apologies that I cannot provide more useful responses given the mismatch between the literature and questions provided. Please let me know if I can attempt to answer any other questions!
