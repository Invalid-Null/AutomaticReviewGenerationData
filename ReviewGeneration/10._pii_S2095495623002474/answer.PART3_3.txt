[1] "By utilizing the commercial γ-Al2O3 as the support, a sub-nanometer Pt2In3 intermetallics assembled catalyst was synthesized with highly thermal-stability structure and rigorous separation of individual Pt atoms, which are less capable of triggering side reactions and hardly to aggregate."

[2] "Further DFT calculations demonstrated that compared with the Pt3In intermetallics, the sufficiently enlarged distance between the Pt atoms in Pt2In3 intermetallics could effectively promote the desorption of the as-generated propylene and prohibit the deep dehydrogenation of C3H6* by only interacting with propylene in a weak π-adsorption configuration."

[1] "The underlying cause for C3H6 generation was investigated by comparing the C3H6 adsorption energies on the Pt2In3 (110) and Pt3In (111) surfaces in terms of the possible adsorption geometries. To consider the possible contribution of entopy, the Gibbs free energy for C3H6 adsorption was also estimated at a elevated temeprature under the atmosphere presure."

[2] "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), including X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra, were performed at the 1W1B, Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), China and the BL14W1, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), China."

[3] "In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected on a ThermoFisher Excalab 250Xi + instrument." 

[4] "In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy by using CO as the probe molecule (CO-DRIFTS) were collected by an infrared spectrometer."

[1] "By treating the nanoparticles with fast Fourier transforming (FFT), it was found that the superlattice diffraction patterns were highly consistent with that of the Pt2In3 intermetallic compound, with the atomic plane distance measured around 2.21 Å and the angle between the crystal faces determined to be 57.8, agreed well with the lattice spacing of the intermetallic Pt2In3 along with [1 1 0] direction."

[2] "Consequently, it showed no tendency of particle size enlargement after reaction for 240 h with the average grain size kept at 0.86 nm, and the mean particle size after three regeneration courses was merely increased to 0.92 nm without any aggregated large nanoparticles."
