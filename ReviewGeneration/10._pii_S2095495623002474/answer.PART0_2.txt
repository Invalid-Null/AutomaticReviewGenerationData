<quotes>

[1] Pt-based catalysts are the typical industrial catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which still suffer from insufficient long-term durability due to the structural instability and coke deposition.

[2] Since the high endothermicity of the PDH reaction (ΔH = 124.3 kJ mol−1), an elevated operating temperature (>600 °C) is required to obtain sufficient propylene yield, which simultaneously favors the occurrence of side reactions and nanoparticle sintering, causing great damage for the selectivity and stability of the catalysts.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: The article explains that catalysts like Pt-based catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the activation energy, allowing the reaction to proceed at high temperatures to achieve sufficient propylene yield. However, high temperatures also promote side reactions and catalyst degradation that reduce selectivity and stability.

[1] From a fundamental perspective, the side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, and deep dehydrogenation to coke, are believed to be structure-sensitive reactions, only happening on particles with adjacent Pt segments, whereas the PDH is a structure-insensitive process, which could occur on isolated Pt sites.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is structure-insensitive and can occur on isolated Pt sites, while side reactions like cracking and coking are structure-sensitive and require adjacent Pt ensembles.

<quotes>

[1] Therefore, separating the PtPt ensembles to create Pt single atoms is considered to be efficient methodologies to circumvent the selectivity and coke issues.

[2] It was proved that the catalyst stability not only resulted from the separated Pt single-atom sites but also significantly affected by the distance of adjacent Pt atoms. 

[3] An increasing distance to 3.25 Å in the Pt2In3 could induce a weak π-adsorption configuration of propylene on Pt sites, which facilitated the desorption of propylene and restrained the side reactions like coking.

</quotes>

<English version answer> 

Answer: The article describes computational and experimental work identifying that separating Pt atoms and increasing distance between them correlates with improved propane dehydrogenation performance by weakening propylene adsorption strength and restraining coke formation. A Pt-In intermetallic with 3.25 Angstrom Pt-Pt distance demonstrated excellent stability.
