 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that are applicable to the questions asked. The literature focuses on synthesizing and characterizing propane dehydrogenation catalysts using Pt-In intermetallic nanoparticles supported on alumina. It does not discuss using zeolites as supports, metal encapsulation techniques, different reactor types, or provide comparisons between fixed bed, fluidized bed, and membrane reactors.

Since there are no relevant quotes, here are the answers:
