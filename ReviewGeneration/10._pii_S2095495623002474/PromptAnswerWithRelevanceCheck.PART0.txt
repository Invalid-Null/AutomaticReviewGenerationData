答:该文献没有提供丙烯通过丙烷脱氢生产在化工行业中的重要性背景信息。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] Pt-based catalysts are the typical industrial catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which still suffer from insufficient long-term durability due to the structural instability and coke deposition.

[2] Since the high endothermicity of the PDH reaction (ΔH = 124.3 kJ mol−1), an elevated operating temperature (>600 °C) is required to obtain sufficient propylene yield, which simultaneously favors the occurrence of side reactions and nanoparticle sintering, causing great damage for the selectivity and stability of the catalysts.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: The article explains that catalysts like Pt-based catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the activation energy, allowing the reaction to proceed at high temperatures to achieve sufficient propylene yield. However, high temperatures also promote side reactions and catalyst degradation that reduce selectivity and stability.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

答:该文献阐述,Pt基催化剂等催化剂通过降低活化能促进丙烷脱氢,使反应能在高温下进行,以获得足够的丙烯产率。但是,高温也促进副反应和催化剂降解,这降低了选择性和稳定性。

[1] From a fundamental perspective, the side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, and deep dehydrogenation to coke, are believed to be structure-sensitive reactions, only happening on particles with adjacent Pt segments, whereas the PDH is a structure-insensitive process, which could occur on isolated Pt sites.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is structure-insensitive and can occur on isolated Pt sites, while side reactions like cracking and coking are structure-sensitive and require adjacent Pt ensembles.

[1] Therefore, separating the PtPt ensembles to create Pt single atoms is considered to be efficient methodologies to circumvent the selectivity and coke issues.

[2] It was proved that the catalyst stability not only resulted from the separated Pt single-atom sites but also significantly affected by the distance of adjacent Pt atoms. 

[3] An increasing distance to 3.25 Å in the Pt2In3 could induce a weak π-adsorption configuration of propylene on Pt sites, which facilitated the desorption of propylene and restrained the side reactions like coking.

</quotes>

<English version answer> 

Answer: The article describes computational and experimental work identifying that separating Pt atoms and increasing distance between them correlates with improved propane dehydrogenation performance by weakening propylene adsorption strength and restraining coke formation. A Pt-In intermetallic with 3.25 Angstrom Pt-Pt distance demonstrated excellent stability.

</English version answer>

答:该文献描述了计算和实验工作,确定Pt原子分离和增加它们之间的距离与改善丙烷脱氢性能相关,通过弱化丙烯吸附强度和抑制焦炭形成。Pt-In间化合物Pt原子间距离为3.25安士表现出优异的稳定性。

[1] Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn great attention in recent years and gradually been developed as a promising complementarity for the supply of propylene. [2] Pt-based catalysts are widely used in this reaction due to its high activity in CH scission and relatively low capability in CC cleavage. 

[3] PDH is believed to be a structure-insensitive process, which could occur on isolated Pt sites.

[4] The first Brillion zone k-point sampling utilized the 2 × 2 × 1 gamma-centered mesh grid. The energy and force criterion for convergence of the electron density and structure optimization were set at 105 eV and 0.02 eV Å1, respectively.

[5] We calculated the adsorption energies of the product C3H6 and the further dehydrogenation barriers on the surfaces of the catalysts during the reaction.
