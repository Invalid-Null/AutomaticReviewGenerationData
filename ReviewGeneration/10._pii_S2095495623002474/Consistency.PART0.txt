To generate this, I carefully compared each answer file's response for each question to the correct answer provided. I assessed the consistency on a 0-100% scale and converted to a percentage string for the JSON values. The keys match the filename pattern given. Please let me know if you would like me to explain or clarify any part of the comparison and analysis.
