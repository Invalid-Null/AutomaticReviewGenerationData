<quotes>
[1] "Pt-based catalysts are the typical industrial catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which still suffer from insufficient long-term durability due to the structural instability and coke deposition."

[2] "A commercial γ-Al2O3 supported thermally robust sub-nanometer Pt2In3 intermetallic catalyst with atomically ordered structure and rigorously separated Pt single atoms was fabricated, which showed outstanding robustness in 240 h long-term operation at 600 C with the deactivation rate constant kd as low as 0.00078 h1, ranking among the lowest reported values."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article evaluates a supported Pt-In intermetallic catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It fabricates a commercial γ-Al2O3 supported sub-nanometer Pt2In3 intermetallic catalyst and shows it has outstanding robustness and low deactivation rate over 240 h operation.

[1] "By utilizing the commercial γ-Al2O3 as the support, a sub-nanometer Pt2In3 intermetallics assembled catalyst was synthesized with highly thermal-stability structure and rigorous separation of individual Pt atoms, which are less capable of triggering side reactions and hardly to aggregate." 

[2] "Further DFT calculations demonstrated that compared with the Pt3In intermetallics, the sufficiently enlarged distance between the Pt atoms in Pt2In3 intermetallics could effectively promote the desorption of the as-generated propylene and prohibit the deep dehydrogenation of C3H6* by only interacting with propylene in a weak π-adsorption configuration."
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
Answer: The article investigates how properties like intermetallic structure, Pt-Pt distances, and single atom separation affect performance. It shows the sub-nanometer Pt2In3 structure with enlarged Pt-Pt distances promotes propylene desorption and prevents deep dehydrogenation to coke. 
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
