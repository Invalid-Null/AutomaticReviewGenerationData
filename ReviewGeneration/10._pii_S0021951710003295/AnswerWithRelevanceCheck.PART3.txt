         [2] "This has been made possible by making use of a combination of complementary characterization techniques, including combined in situ UVVis/Raman, in situ HERFD XANES, EXAFS and CO-TPD IR spectroscopy."

         [3] "In the case of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the above described features are similar to those observed previously by van Bokhoven and co-workers in several XAS studies after the adsorption of CO or ethene on Pt [27], [30]. In these works, they explained the increase in the white-line intensity and the shift of the edge position to higher energies as being due to the withdrawal of electron density from small platinum clusters to the adsorbed CO or ethene by means of 2π*d back-bond."

         [4] "The results indicate that during the process of coke burning, oxygen oxidizes the Sn present in the PtSn alloy, which segregates out of the supported Pt nanoparticles. The subsequent H2 reduction restores the PtSn alloy. In this catalyst material, the Pt nanoparticle size grows after the regeneration process, but the growth occurs to a lesser extent than in the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Seemingly, the decoration of Pt particles by Sn could prevent the Pt sintering phenomenon."

         Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it uses in-situ HERFD XANES and EXAFS to study changes in the oxidation states and structures of Pt and PtSn nanoparticles during propane dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles. This revealed insights like Sn oxidation and segregation during regeneration, and subsequent re-alloying with Pt after re-reduction.
