Answer: No, the article does not compare the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts. It focuses only on metallic Pt and PtSn catalysts.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:不,这篇文章没有比较金属和氧化金属支持催化剂的选择性谱。它仅关注金属Pt和PtSn催化剂。

<quotes>
[1] "Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their excellent activity."
[2] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability."
[3] "However, the mechanism by which Sn as promoter modifies the catalytic behavior of Pt remains a matter of debate due to the complicated nature of the PtSn alloy system."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates PtSn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing PtSn/Al2O3 has higher propane conversion and propene selectivity compared to Pt/Al2O3. It also provides insights that Sn modifies the electronic properties of Pt, leading to selective C-H bond activation over C-C bond rupture, and that Sn produces a "drain-off" effect to remove coke precursors from active sites.

Answer: No, the article does not investigate other Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Ga, Pt-Zn for propane dehydrogenation. It only focuses on PtSn alloy catalysts.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:不,这篇文章没有研究其他Pt合金催化剂,如Pt-Ga、Pt-Zn用于丙烷氢反应。它仅关注PtSn合金催化剂。

<quotes>
[1] "Sn K edge was also measured during H2 treatment. XANES analysis shows that Sn is presented initially as SnO2 and reduction to SnO takes place during the ramp of temperature in H2." 
[2] "From Pt XAS results, it is clear that an interaction between both metals exists and PtSn alloy formation is detected."
[3] "This interaction modifies the Pt electronic properties leading to more electron-poor, active particles exhibiting a higher propene turnover and improved catalytic stability."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of Sn in the PtSn bimetallic catalyst. XANES and EXAFS data reveal Sn is present initially as SnO2, gets reduced to SnO and forms a PtSn alloy. This modifies the electronic properties of Pt, making it more electron deficient, leading to higher propene selectivity and stability. The particle size and Pt:Sn ratio are also explored.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
答:是的,这篇文章研究了PtSn双金属催化剂中Sn的电子和几何效应。XANES和EXAFS数据显示,Sn最初存在于SnO2,被还原为SnO并形成PtSn合金。这改变了Pt的电子性质,使其更具电子亲合力,导致丙烯选择性和稳定性更高。该文章还探讨了颗粒大小和Pt:Sn比。

Answer: No, the article does not explore the use of subsurface promoters like Re or Mn in bimetallic and alloy catalysts to tune selectivity. It only studies Sn as a promoter for Pt catalysts.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:不,这篇文章没有探索使用Re或Mn等下层促进剂在双金属和合金催化剂中调节选择性。它仅研究Sn作为Pt催化剂的促进剂。

<quotes>
[1] "Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of Pt and therefore the activation of propane, but also produces a drain-off effect."  
[2] "The Pt L3 Δμ XANES data revealed that the interaction of propene with the Pt surface appears stronger for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst than for the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst leading to a partial blocking of the active site and therefore a lower propane conversion."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article describes synergistic effects between Pt and Sn in the bimetallic PtSn catalyst, attributed to ensemble and ligand effects. It explains that Sn modifies the electronic properties of Pt, leading to selective propene formation. Sn also produces a "drain-off" effect to remove coke precursors from Pt active sites, increasing stability.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,这篇文章描述了PtSn双金属催化剂中Pt和Sn之间的协同效应,归因于配位体团簇效应。它解释说,Sn改变了Pt的电子性质,导致选择性丙烯形成。Sn还产生“排放”效应以从Pt活性位点除去焦炭前体,增加稳定性。
