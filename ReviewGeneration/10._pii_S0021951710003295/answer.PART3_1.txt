<quotes>

[1] The results obtained from these innovative real-time characterization studies show a difference in behavior for the catalyst materials (in the presence/absence of Sn as promoter) with regard to both propane dehydrogenation/activation and coke formation (in both the amount and type of coke formed).

[2] As a result, we have on-line monitored the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation using a combined in situ UVVis/Raman setup.

[3] Experiments at the Sn K edge and Pt L3 edge during H2 reduction were conducted using an in situ cell, which allows the investigation of the catalyst materials using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) for sample temperatures from 25 to 500 C. 

[4] In this work, the catalytic performance of Al2O3-supported Pt and PtSn catalysts has been investigated and compared for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene under industrially relevant conditions. The work makes use of two separate in situ reactor setups: one that utilizes a powder-containing, plug-flow reactor setup that combines on-line activity measurements with the simultaneous recording of in situ UVVis and Raman spectroscopy data and a second setup consisting of a flow-through cell using a pressed pellet sample that has been developed so that it is possible to perform catalytic reactions with on-line product monitoring at the outlet (mass spectrometer) while performing in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements.

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses in-situ UVVis/Raman spectroscopy to monitor coke formation during propane dehydrogenation. It also uses in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) XAS to investigate the catalyst materials during H2 reduction and propane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. Two different in-situ reactor setups are used - one combining UVVis/Raman with online GC analysis, and another combining HERFD-XAS with online mass spectrometry. Insights are gained into coke formation, catalyst activation, and differences between Pt and PtSn catalysts.

答:是的,该文利用了原位表征技术来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。具体而言,它使用了原位UVVis/Raman光谱学监测丙烷脱氢过程中的焦炭生成。它还使用了原位X射线吸收光谱(XAS)和高能分辨荧光检测(HERFD)XAS来研究催化材料在H2还原和高温丙烷脱氢过程中的表现。使用了两种不同的原位反应器设置——一种将UVVis/Raman与在线气相色谱联用,另一种将HERFD-XAS与在线质谱联用。获得了关于焦炭生成、催化剂激活以及Pt和PtSn催化剂之间差异的见解。

[1] XANES analysis shows that Sn is presented initially as SnO2 and reduction to SnO takes place during the ramp of temperature in H2 (Fig. S4). 

[2] From the position and shape of XANES spectra, it is clear that during the process of coke burning, oxygen oxidizes the Sn present in the PtSn alloy, which segregates out of the supported Pt nanoparticles. The subsequent H2 reduction restores the PtSn alloy.

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it uses XANES analysis to show that Sn is initially present as SnO2 and gets reduced to SnO during H2 treatment at elevated temperatures. It also shows via XANES that during coke burning, oxygen oxidizes the Sn in the PtSn alloy, causing it to segregate from the Pt nanoparticles, while subsequent H2 reduction restores the PtSn alloy.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文使用了基于X射线的技术来探究丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。具体而言,它使用XANES分析表明,Sn最初存在于SnO2形式,并在高温H2处理过程中被还原为SnO。它还通过XANES表明,在焦炭燃烧过程中,氧气氧化了PtSn合金中的Sn,导致其与Pt纳米粒子分离,而随后的H2还原又恢复了PtSn合金。
