[1] "The catalytic performances of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane through consecutive reactionregeneration cycles have been studied under realistic reaction conditions."

[2] "Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their excellent activity [5]."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic catalysts Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation, providing data on their catalytic performance over consecutive reaction-regeneration cycles under industrial conditions. It states that Pt-based catalysts are widely used for alkane dehydrogenation due to their high activity.

<quotes>
[1] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability [7], [8]." 

[2] "In this work, the catalytic performance of Al2O3-supported Pt and PtSn catalysts has been investigated and compared for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene under industrially relevant conditions."

[3] "The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[4] "The presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of Pt and therefore the activation of propane, but also produces a drain-off effect."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like Sn promotion affect the performance of supported Pt catalysts. It shows that adding Sn alters product distribution by inhibiting undesired reactions like hydrogenolysis, isomerization, cracking and coke formation, thereby improving catalyst selectivity and stability. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits higher propane conversion and propene selectivity compared to Pt/Al2O3. Sn modifies Pt's electronic properties, affecting propane activation, and produces a drain-off effect that improves stability.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文中研究了Sn促进等因素如何影响负载Pt催化剂的性能。结果显示,添加Sn改变了产物分布,抑制了氢解、异构化、裂化和焦炭生成等不良反应,从而提高了催化剂的选择性和稳定性。与Pt/Al2O3相比,PtSn/Al2O3催化剂具有更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。Sn改变了Pt的电子性质,影响丙烷的活化,并产生排挤效应,改善了稳定性。

[1] "From the above observation, it can be suggested that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form activated/partly dehydrogenated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits."

[2] "The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the presence of Sn not only reduces the amount of coke formed during a propane dehydrogenation run but also modifies its rate of formation." 

[3] "The results indicate that the presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of the Pt nanoparticles and therefore the activation of propane but also produces a drain-off effect."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic reaction pathway where propane gets activated on the catalyst surface to form common intermediates that can either desorb as propene or undergo further cracking and coke formation. It shows Sn modifies Pt's electronic properties affecting propane activation and produces a drain-off effect that reduces coke formation rate.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
答:是的,文中提出了一个机理反应途径,丙烷在催化剂表面被活化形成共同的中间体,这些中间体要么脱附生成丙烯,要么继续裂化和焦炭生成。结果显示,Sn改变Pt的电子性质影响丙烷的活化,并产生排挤效应减缓焦炭生成速率。
