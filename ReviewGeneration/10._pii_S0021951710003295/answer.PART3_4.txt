<quotes>
[1] "The catalytic performance of Al2O3-supported Pt and PtSn catalysts has been investigated and compared for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene under industrially relevant conditions. The work makes use of two separate in situ reactor setups: one that utilizes a powder-containing, plug-flow reactor setup that combines on-line activity measurements with the simultaneous recording of in situ UVVis and Raman spectroscopy data and a second setup consisting of a flow-through cell using a pressed pellet sample that has been developed so that it is possible to perform catalytic reactions with on-line product monitoring at the outlet (mass spectrometer) while performing in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements [10], [11]."

[2] "As a result, we have on-line monitored the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation using a combined in situ UVVis/Raman setup."

[3] "Measurements were taken at the ID26 beamline of ESRF (Grenoble, France). High-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the L3 (11.5637 keV) edges was performed on the Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts under the same gas conditions and reaction temperatures as discussed above for the combined in situ UVVis/Raman spectroscopy measurements."

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses a combined in situ UVVis/Raman setup to monitor coke formation during propane dehydrogenation. It also performs in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy on the catalysts under reaction conditions to probe changes in oxidation state and local structure.

[2] "From the position and shape of XANES spectra, it is clear that during the process of coke burning, oxygen oxidizes the Sn present in the PtSn alloy, which segregates out of the supported Pt nanoparticles. The subsequent H2 reduction restores the PtSn alloy."

[3] "Re-activation treatments in H2 are necessary in order to regenerate the active and selective PtSn alloy phases. However, multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles result in a gradual Sn enrichment of the alloy, which leads to a decrease in the overall dehydrogenation activity."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it performs in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy to monitor changes in the oxidation state of Pt and Sn during reaction-regeneration cycles. The data reveals that Sn in the PtSn alloy oxidizes and segregates during coke burning, and that the alloy is restored after H2 reduction. It also shows Sn enrichment of the alloy after multiple cycles, leading to decreased activity.

答案:是的,这篇文章使用了基于X射线的技术来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。具体而言,它进行了原位高能分辨荧光检测X射线吸收光谱学以监测Pt和Sn在反应-再生循环中的氧化态变化。数据显示,PtSn合金中的Sn在焦炭燃烧过程中氧化并脱离,氢气还原后合金又被恢复。它也显示了多循环后合金的Sn富集,导致活性降低。
