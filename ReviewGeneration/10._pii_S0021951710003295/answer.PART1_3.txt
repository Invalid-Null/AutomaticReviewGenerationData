<quotes>

[1] "The catalytic performances of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane through consecutive reactionregeneration cycles have been studied under realistic reaction conditions."

[2] "Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their excellent activity [5]."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt and PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It studies the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 through consecutive reaction-regeneration cycles under realistic conditions. It notes that Pt-based catalysts are widely used for alkane dehydrogenation due to their excellent activity.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

答:这篇文章评估了受支持的单金属Pt和PtSn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它通过连续的反应-再生循环研究了Pt/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3在真实条件下的催化性能。它指出Pt基催化剂由于其优异的活性而被广泛用于烷烃脱氢。

<quotes>

[1] "Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of Pt and therefore the activation of propane, but also produces a drain-off effect." 

[2] "the Pt L3 Δμ XANES data revealed that the interaction of propene with the Pt surface appears stronger for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst than for the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst leading to a partial blocking of the active site and therefore a lower propane conversion."

[3] "Sn segregates from the PtSn alloy during coke burning, and this phenomenon could have a positive effect by stabilizing the supported Pt nanoparticles against sintering;"

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: The article investigates how Sn modification affects the properties and performance of supported Pt catalysts. It finds Sn changes the electronic properties of Pt, activates propane differently, and produces a drain-off effect to keep sites clean. The Pt-propene interaction is weaker for PtSn than Pt, leading to less site blocking and higher conversion. Sn segregation during regeneration may help stabilize Pt against sintering.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

答:这篇文章研究了Sn修饰如何影响受支持的Pt催化剂的性质和性能。它发现Sn改变了Pt的电子性质,以不同的方式激活丙烷,并产生排水效应以保持场地干净。PtSn与Pt相比,Pt与丙烯的相互作用较弱,导致场地阻塞较少,转化率更高。Sn在再生期间的离聚可能有助于稳定Pt,防止烧结。

<quotes>

[1] "The differences between pure Pt itself and the PtSn alloy, manifested in the shape of the XANES spectra, suggest a difference in the types of interaction of the hydrocarbon on the Pt surfaces [28], [29]." 

[2] "we can assume that Sn addition leads to both electronic and structural modifications of the properties of the Pt nanoparticles, which have the following implications: (i) selective CH bond activation is favored over CC and CC bond rupture, leading to high selectivity to propene and (ii) coke precursors, such as (partly) dehydrogenated hydrocarbons, can easily move on the surface of PtSn particles and thus they migrate from the active sites to the support before being converted by coke [20], [21]."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: The article proposes mechanistic pathways where Sn modification causes electronic and structural changes to Pt that favor selective C-H bond activation over C-C bond rupture, leading to high propene selectivity. It also enables coke precursors to migrate from active sites to the support before coke formation.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

答:这篇文章提出了机理途径,其中Sn修饰导致Pt的电子和结构变化,有利于选择性C-H键激活而不是C-C键断裂,从而导致丙烯选择性很高。它还使焦炭前体能够从活性位点迁移到支持体,然后再进行焦化。
