<quotes>
[1] In this work, the catalytic performance of Al2O3-supported Pt and PtSn catalysts has been investigated and compared for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene under industrially relevant conditions.
[2] Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their excellent activity [5]. However, this catalyst system suffers from fast deactivation due to coke formation. There are several strategies to improve the catalytic behavior of Pt, including its promotion with a second metal [6], [7]. Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability [7], [8].

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates PtSn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It compares the performance of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, showing that adding Sn as a promoter enhances selectivity to propene and improves stability by inhibiting cracking reactions and coke formation.

<quotes>
[1] XANES analysis shows that Sn is presented initially as SnO2 and reduction to SnO takes place during the ramp of temperature in H2 (Fig. S4). From Pt XAS results, it is clear that an interaction between both metals exists and PtSn alloy formation is detected.
[2] In the case of the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the interaction of propene with the Pt surface appears stronger for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst than for the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst leading to a partial blocking of the active site and therefore a lower propane conversion.

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of Sn in the PtSn alloy catalyst. XANES shows Sn reduces the electron density of Pt, modifying its catalytic properties. The weaker Pt-propene interaction in PtSn compared to Pt leads to higher propane conversion, indicating Sn tunes the ensemble effect.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,这篇文章研究了PtSn合金催化剂中Sn的电子和几何效应。XANES显示Sn减少了Pt的电子密度,改变了它的催化性能。与Pt相比,PtSn中的Pt-丙烯相互作用更弱,导致丙烷转换率更高,这表明Sn调节了集团效应。
