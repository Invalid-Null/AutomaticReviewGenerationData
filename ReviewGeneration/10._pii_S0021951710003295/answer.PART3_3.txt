<quotes>

[1] "The results obtained from these innovative real-time characterization studies show a difference in behavior for the catalyst materials (in the presence/absence of Sn as promoter) with regard to both propane dehydrogenation/activation and coke formation (in both the amount and type of coke formed)."

[2] "As a result, we have on-line monitored the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation using a combined in situ UVVis/Raman setup." 

[3] "Experiments at the Sn K edge and Pt L3 edge during H2 reduction were conducted using an in situ cell, which allows the investigation of the catalyst materials using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) for sample temperatures from 25 to 500 C."

[4] "Measurements were taken at the ID26 beamline of ESRF (Grenoble, France). High-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the L3 (11.5637 keV) edges was performed on the Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts under the same gas conditions and reaction temperatures as discussed above for the combined in situ UVVis/Raman spectroscopy measurements."

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses a combined in situ UVVis/Raman setup to monitor coke formation during propane dehydrogenation in real-time. It also performs in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and high-energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy at different edges under reaction conditions to investigate catalyst activation, coke formation, and changes in oxidation state. These techniques provide insights into catalyst behavior, coke formation, and changes in the metals during reaction cycles.

答:是的,文章利用了原位表征技术来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。具体而言,它使用了联合的原位紫外-可见光谱/拉曼光谱仪配置来实时监测丙烷脱氢过程中的焦炭形成。它还在反应条件下,在不同的吸收边上执行了原位X射线吸收光谱和高能解析荧光检测X射线吸收光谱,以研究催化剂活化、焦炭形成以及金属在反应循环中的氧化态变化。这些技术提供了对催化剂行为、焦炭形成以及金属在反应循环期间的变化的见解。

<quotes>

[1] "XANES analysis shows that Sn is presented initially as SnO2 and reduction to SnO takes place during the ramp of temperature in H2 (Fig. S4)."

[2] "In the case of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the above described features are similar to those observed previously by van Bokhoven and co-workers in several XAS studies after the adsorption of CO or ethene on Pt [27], [30]. In these works, they explained the increase in the white-line intensity and the shift of the edge position to higher energies as being due to the withdrawal of electron density from small platinum clusters to the adsorbed CO or ethene by means of 2π*d back-bond." 

[3] "The Pt L3 Δμ XANES data revealed that the interaction of propene with the Pt surface appears stronger for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst than for the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst leading to a partial blocking of the active site and therefore a lower propane conversion."

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it uses XANES analysis to show the reduction of SnO2 to SnO during H2 treatment. It also uses Pt L3 edge XANES to monitor the interaction between propene and the Pt surface, revealing differences between Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 that impact catalytic behavior. The shifts in absorption edges and changes in white line intensity are interpreted in terms of electron density shifts that accompany adsorption and reaction on the catalyst surface.

<Chinese version answer>

答:是的,文章使用了基于X射线的技术来探究丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。具体而言,它使用XANES分析显示了H2处理过程中SnO2向SnO的还原。它还使用Pt L3边缘XANES监测丙烯与Pt表面之间的相互作用,揭示了Pt/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3之间的差异,这些差异影响了催化行为。吸收边的位移和白线强度的变化被解释为吸附和催化剂表面上的反应所伴随的电子密度转移。
