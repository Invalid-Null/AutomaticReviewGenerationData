</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
1. "As a promoter, Sn has a great influence on the starting Pt phase. It reduces the average size of the Pt particles and forms an alloy with Pt. This interaction modifies the Pt electronic properties leading to more electron-poor, active particles exhibiting a higher propene turnover and improved catalytic stability"
2. "In the case of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the above described features are similar to those observed previously by van Bokhoven and co-workers in several XAS studies after the adsorption of CO or ethene on Pt [27], [30]. In these works, they explained the increase in the white-line intensity and the shift of the edge position to higher energies as being due to the withdrawal of electron density from small platinum clusters to the adsorbed CO or ethene by means of 2π*d back-bond."
3. "The L3 Δμ spectra for the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst upon exposure to propane are shown in Fig. 7B. The change in the spectra is clearly different from those of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst as a shift in the edge position of the spectra to lower energies is observed."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts. Specifically, it finds that Sn reduces Pt particle size and forms an alloy, modifying the electronic properties and leading to more active particles. It also finds differences in Pt-hydrocarbon interactions for Pt vs PtSn, with weaker bonding for PtSn.

<Chinese version answer>  
答:该文研究了金属粒子大小、形状和支持体相互作用等特性如何影响受支持金属催化剂的性能。具体来说,它发现Sn减小了Pt粒子的大小,形成了合金,改变了电子特性,导致了更活跃的粒子。它还发现Pt和PtSn与碳氢化合物的相互作用有差异,PtSn的相互作用更弱。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
1. "The differences between pure Pt itself and the PtSn alloy, manifested in the shape of the XANES spectra, suggest a difference in the types of interaction of the hydrocarbon on the Pt surfaces [28], [29]." 
2. "Accordingly, we can assume that Sn addition leads to both electronic and structural modifications of the properties of the Pt nanoparticles, which have the following implications: (i) selective CH bond activation is favored over CC and CC bond rupture, leading to high selectivity to propene" 
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes that Sn addition leads to electronic and structural changes in Pt nanoparticles that favor selective C-H bond activation over C-C bond rupture, leading to high propene selectivity.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
答:该文提出Sn的添加导致Pt纳米粒子的电子和结构变化,这促进了选择性C-H键断裂而不是C-C键断裂,从而导致高丙烯选择性。
