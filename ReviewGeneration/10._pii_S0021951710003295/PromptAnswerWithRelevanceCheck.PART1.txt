<quotes>
[1] "The catalytic performances of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane through consecutive reactionregeneration cycles have been studied under realistic reaction conditions."

[2] "Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their excellent activity."

[3] "This combination of powerful spectroscopic techniques revealed unique information regarding the activity behavior and deactivation mechanism of Pt- and PtSn-based propane dehydrogenation catalysts, enabling us to identify important structure-electronic-performance relationships as well as fundamental insight into the dynamics of PtSn alloy formation processes in Pt nanoparticles at elevated temperatures."

[4] "The work makes use of two separate in situ reactor setups: one that utilizes a powder-containing, plug-flow reactor setup that combines on-line activity measurements with the simultaneous recording of in situ UVVis and Raman spectroscopy data and a second setup consisting of a flow-through cell using a pressed pellet sample that has been developed so that it is possible to perform catalytic reactions with on-line product monitoring at the outlet (mass spectrometer) while performing in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported Pt and PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It studies the catalytic performance and deactivation mechanisms of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 under consecutive reaction-regeneration cycles. The article uses in situ spectroscopy techniques like UVVis, Raman, HERFD XAS to reveal structure-function relationships and insights into PtSn alloy formation dynamics.

<quotes>
[1] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability." 

[2] "In contrast, the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[3] "The results indicate that the presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of the Pt nanoparticles and therefore the activation of propane but also produces a drain-off effect. This drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support."

[4] "The Pt L3 Δμ XANES data revealed that the interaction of propene with the Pt surface appears stronger for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst than for the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst leading to a partial blocking of the active site and therefore a lower propane conversion."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like Sn promotion, particle size, and electronic properties affect the performance of Pt catalysts. It shows Sn enhances selectivity and stability by inhibiting side reactions and removing coke precursors. The weaker Pt-propene interaction in PtSn prevents site blocking, enabling higher propane conversion. 
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章研究了诸如Sn掺杂、粒径和电子性质等特性如何影响Pt催化剂的性能。它表明Sn通过抑制副反应和去除炭素前体提高了选择性和稳定性。 PtSn中的较弱Pt-丙烯互作用可防止位阻塞,使丙烷转化率更高。

[3] "Accordingly, we can assume that Sn addition leads to both electronic and structural modifications of the properties of the Pt nanoparticles, which have the following implications: (i) selective CH bond activation is favored over CC and CC bond rupture, leading to high selectivity to propene and (ii) coke precursors, such as (partly) dehydrogenated hydrocarbons, can easily move on the surface of PtSn particles and thus they migrate from the active sites to the support before being converted by coke."

</quotes>

<English version answer> 
Answer: Yes, the article proposes that Sn modifies the electronic properties of Pt, favoring selective C-H bond activation over C-C bonds for propene formation. It also enables coke precursor mobility, draining them from active sites to the support.

[1] "However, this catalyst system suffers from fast deactivation due to coke formation." 

[2] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability [7], [8]."

[3] "In contrast, the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[4] "The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the presence of Sn not only reduces the amount of coke formed during a propane dehydrogenation run but also modifies its rate of formation."

[5] "This drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size, promoter addition, and metal-support interactions affect the performance of Pt-based catalysts. It shows Sn addition enhances selectivity and stability by inhibiting coke formation through a "drain-off" effect that removes coke precursors. Smaller Pt particle size with Sn decoration also modifies the Pt electronic properties and propane activation.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文研究了金属粒子大小、晶种添加和金属-支撑体相互作用等性质如何影响Pt基催化剂的性能。它显示Sn的添加通过“排泄”效应抑制焦炭生成从而提高选择性和稳定性,该效应可以去除焦炭前体。添加了Sn修饰的较小Pt粒子也改变了Pt的电子性质和丙烷的激活。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "The dehydrogenation reaction: After reduction, a gas stream of pure propane (9 ml min1) humidified with 9 v/v% of steam was introduced in the reactor. The reaction proceeded for 6 h at 590 C, and after this treatment, the system was purged with He for 5 min."

[2] "Accordingly, we can assume that Sn addition leads to both electronic and structural modifications of the properties of the Pt nanoparticles, which have the following implications: (i) selective CH bond activation is favored over CC and CC bond rupture, leading to high selectivity to propene and (ii) coke precursors, such as (partly) dehydrogenated hydrocarbons, can easily move on the surface of PtSn particles and thus they migrate from the active sites to the support before being converted by coke [20], [21]."
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic pathway where propane dehydrogenation proceeds through CH bond activation over Pt and PtSn active sites to form propene selectively. Coke precursors can migrate from PtSn active sites to the support before further conversion to coke, improving stability.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文提出了一个机理路径,丙烷在Pt和PtSn活性位点上通过CH键激活脱氢生成丙烯。焦炭前体可以从PtSn活性位点迁移到支撑体上,在进一步转化成焦炭之前,从而提高了稳定性。

<quotes>
1. "As a promoter, Sn has a great influence on the starting Pt phase. It reduces the average size of the Pt particles and forms an alloy with Pt. This interaction modifies the Pt electronic properties leading to more electron-poor, active particles exhibiting a higher propene turnover and improved catalytic stability"
2. "In the case of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the above described features are similar to those observed previously by van Bokhoven and co-workers in several XAS studies after the adsorption of CO or ethene on Pt [27], [30]. In these works, they explained the increase in the white-line intensity and the shift of the edge position to higher energies as being due to the withdrawal of electron density from small platinum clusters to the adsorbed CO or ethene by means of 2π*d back-bond."
3. "The L3 Δμ spectra for the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst upon exposure to propane are shown in Fig. 7B. The change in the spectra is clearly different from those of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst as a shift in the edge position of the spectra to lower energies is observed."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts. Specifically, it finds that Sn reduces Pt particle size and forms an alloy, modifying the electronic properties and leading to more active particles. It also finds differences in Pt-hydrocarbon interactions for Pt vs PtSn, with weaker bonding for PtSn.

[2] "the Pt L3 Δμ XANES data revealed that the interaction of propene with the Pt surface appears stronger for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst than for the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst leading to a partial blocking of the active site and therefore a lower propane conversion."

[3] "Sn segregates from the PtSn alloy during coke burning, and this phenomenon could have a positive effect by stabilizing the supported Pt nanoparticles against sintering;"

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: The article investigates how Sn modification affects the properties and performance of supported Pt catalysts. It finds Sn changes the electronic properties of Pt, activates propane differently, and produces a drain-off effect to keep sites clean. The Pt-propene interaction is weaker for PtSn than Pt, leading to less site blocking and higher conversion. Sn segregation during regeneration may help stabilize Pt against sintering.

[3] "The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[4] "The presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of Pt and therefore the activation of propane, but also produces a drain-off effect."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like Sn promotion affect the performance of supported Pt catalysts. It shows that adding Sn alters product distribution by inhibiting undesired reactions like hydrogenolysis, isomerization, cracking and coke formation, thereby improving catalyst selectivity and stability. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits higher propane conversion and propene selectivity compared to Pt/Al2O3. Sn modifies Pt's electronic properties, affecting propane activation, and produces a drain-off effect that improves stability.

[1] "From the above observation, it can be suggested that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form activated/partly dehydrogenated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits."

[2] "The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the presence of Sn not only reduces the amount of coke formed during a propane dehydrogenation run but also modifies its rate of formation." 

[3] "The results indicate that the presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of the Pt nanoparticles and therefore the activation of propane but also produces a drain-off effect."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic reaction pathway where propane gets activated on the catalyst surface to form common intermediates that can either desorb as propene or undergo further cracking and coke formation. It shows Sn modifies Pt's electronic properties affecting propane activation and produces a drain-off effect that reduces coke formation rate.
