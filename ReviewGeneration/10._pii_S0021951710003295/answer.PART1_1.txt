<quotes>
[1] "Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their excellent activity [5]."

[2] "The catalytic performances of Al2O3-supported Pt and PtSn catalysts has been investigated and compared for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene under industrially relevant conditions."

[3] "In this work, the catalytic performance of Al2O3-supported Pt and PtSn catalysts has been investigated and compared for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene under industrially relevant conditions."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Al2O3-supported Pt and PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on propane conversion, propene selectivity, and stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst showed higher and more stable propene selectivity compared to Pt/Al2O3.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
答:是的,本文评估了Al2O3支持的Pt和PtSn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供了丙烷转换率、丙烯选择性和多循环反应-再生过程中的稳定性数据。与Pt/Al2O3相比,PtSn/Al2O3催化剂表现出更高更稳定的丙烯选择性。

[1] "However, this catalyst system suffers from fast deactivation due to coke formation." 

[2] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability [7], [8]."

[3] "In contrast, the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[4] "The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the presence of Sn not only reduces the amount of coke formed during a propane dehydrogenation run but also modifies its rate of formation."

[5] "This drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size, promoter addition, and metal-support interactions affect the performance of Pt-based catalysts. It shows Sn addition enhances selectivity and stability by inhibiting coke formation through a "drain-off" effect that removes coke precursors. Smaller Pt particle size with Sn decoration also modifies the Pt electronic properties and propane activation.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文研究了金属粒子大小、晶种添加和金属-支撑体相互作用等性质如何影响Pt基催化剂的性能。它显示Sn的添加通过“排泄”效应抑制焦炭生成从而提高选择性和稳定性,该效应可以去除焦炭前体。添加了Sn修饰的较小Pt粒子也改变了Pt的电子性质和丙烷的激活。

[1] "The dehydrogenation reaction: After reduction, a gas stream of pure propane (9 ml min1) humidified with 9 v/v% of steam was introduced in the reactor. The reaction proceeded for 6 h at 590 C, and after this treatment, the system was purged with He for 5 min."

[2] "Accordingly, we can assume that Sn addition leads to both electronic and structural modifications of the properties of the Pt nanoparticles, which have the following implications: (i) selective CH bond activation is favored over CC and CC bond rupture, leading to high selectivity to propene and (ii) coke precursors, such as (partly) dehydrogenated hydrocarbons, can easily move on the surface of PtSn particles and thus they migrate from the active sites to the support before being converted by coke [20], [21]."
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic pathway where propane dehydrogenation proceeds through CH bond activation over Pt and PtSn active sites to form propene selectively. Coke precursors can migrate from PtSn active sites to the support before further conversion to coke, improving stability.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文提出了一个机理路径,丙烷在Pt和PtSn活性位点上通过CH键激活脱氢生成丙烯。焦炭前体可以从PtSn活性位点迁移到支撑体上,在进一步转化成焦炭之前,从而提高了稳定性。
