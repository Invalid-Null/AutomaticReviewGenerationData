[1] "As a result, we have on-line monitored the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation using a combined in situ UVVis/Raman setup." 

[2] "Experiments at the Sn K edge and Pt L3 edge during H2 reduction were conducted using an in situ cell, which allows the investigation of the catalyst materials using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) for sample temperatures from 25 to 500 C."

[3] "In this work, the catalytic performance of Al2O3-supported Pt and PtSn catalysts has been investigated and compared for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene under industrially relevant conditions. The work makes use of two separate in situ reactor setups: one that utilizes a powder-containing, plug-flow reactor setup that combines on-line activity measurements with the simultaneous recording of in situ UVVis and Raman spectroscopy data and a second setup consisting of a flow-through cell using a pressed pellet sample that has been developed so that it is possible to perform catalytic reactions with on-line product monitoring at the outlet (mass spectrometer) while performing in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements [10], [11]."

4. Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses a combined in-situ UVVis/Raman setup to monitor coke formation during propane dehydrogenation. It also employs an in-situ XAS cell to investigate the catalysts under H2 reduction at temperatures from 25 to 500 C. Additionally, it makes use of two separate in-situ reactor setups - one combining online activity measurements with in-situ UVVis and Raman spectroscopy, and another allowing online product monitoring by mass spectrometry along with in-situ HERFD XAS measurements during propane dehydrogenation under industrially relevant conditions.

[1] "From Pt XAS results, it is clear that an interaction between both metals exists and PtSn alloy formation is detected. However, it is not possible to extract the same conclusions from Sn K edge data, as X-ray absorption is a bulk technique and there are three times more Sn than Pt in the sample and EXAFS results for Pt indicates that only a small fraction of Sn comes into the alloy."

[2] "The results obtained from these innovative real-time characterization studies show a difference in behavior for the catalyst materials (in the presence/absence of Sn as promoter) with regard to both propane dehydrogenation/activation and coke formation (in both the amount and type of coke formed)." 

[3] "In particular, attention has focused, for the first time, upon understanding the effect that multiple reactionregeneration cycles have on the physicochemical properties of the catalyst materials. This includes the reducibility of Pt and Sn, the extent of SnPt alloying, sintering of Pt nanoparticles and the surface properties of Pt."

6. Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. The XAS results reveal the interaction between Pt and Sn and formation of PtSn alloy. The real-time characterization studies show differences in catalyst behavior and coke formation with and without Sn promoter. Specifically, the work focuses on understanding the effects of multiple reaction-regeneration cycles on properties like reducibility of Pt and Sn, extent of PtSn alloying, sintering of Pt nanoparticles, and Pt surface properties.
