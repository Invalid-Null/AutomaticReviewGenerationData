This has been made possible by making use of a combination of complementary characterization techniques, including combined in situ UVVis/Raman, in situ HERFD XANES, EXAFS and CO-TPD IR spectroscopy."

[2] "In the case of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the above described features are similar to those observed previously by van Bokhoven and co-workers in several XAS studies after the adsorption of CO or ethene on Pt [27], [30]. In these works, they explained the increase in the white-line intensity and the shift of the edge position to higher energies as being due to the withdrawal of electron density from small platinum clusters to the adsorbed CO or ethene by means of 2π*d back-bond."

[3] "The results indicate that during the process of coke burning, oxygen oxidizes the Sn present in the PtSn alloy, which segregates out of the supported Pt nanoparticles. The subsequent H2 reduction restores the PtSn alloy. In this catalyst material, the Pt nanoparticle size grows after the regeneration process, but the growth occurs to a lesser extent than in the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Seemingly, the decoration of Pt particles by Sn could prevent the Pt sintering phenomenon."

<English version answer>

Specifically, it uses in-situ HERFD XANES and EXAFS to study changes in the oxidation states and structures of Pt and PtSn nanoparticles during propane dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles. This revealed insights like Sn oxidation and segregation during regeneration, and subsequent re-alloying with Pt after re-reduction.

[1] The results obtained from these innovative real-time characterization studies show a difference in behavior for the catalyst materials (in the presence/absence of Sn as promoter) with regard to both propane dehydrogenation/activation and coke formation (in both the amount and type of coke formed).

[2] As a result, we have on-line monitored the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation using a combined in situ UVVis/Raman setup.

[3] Experiments at the Sn K edge and Pt L3 edge during H2 reduction were conducted using an in situ cell, which allows the investigation of the catalyst materials using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) for sample temperatures from 25 to 500 C. 

[4] In this work, the catalytic performance of Al2O3-supported Pt and PtSn catalysts has been investigated and compared for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene under industrially relevant conditions. The work makes use of two separate in situ reactor setups: one that utilizes a powder-containing, plug-flow reactor setup that combines on-line activity measurements with the simultaneous recording of in situ UVVis and Raman spectroscopy data and a second setup consisting of a flow-through cell using a pressed pellet sample that has been developed so that it is possible to perform catalytic reactions with on-line product monitoring at the outlet (mass spectrometer) while performing in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements.

Specifically, it uses in-situ UVVis/Raman spectroscopy to monitor coke formation during propane dehydrogenation. It also uses in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) XAS to investigate the catalyst materials during H2 reduction and propane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. Two different in-situ reactor setups are used - one combining UVVis/Raman with online GC analysis, and another combining HERFD-XAS with online mass spectrometry. Insights are gained into coke formation, catalyst activation, and differences between Pt and PtSn catalysts.

[1] XANES analysis shows that Sn is presented initially as SnO2 and reduction to SnO takes place during the ramp of temperature in H2 (Fig. S4). 

[2] From the position and shape of XANES spectra, it is clear that during the process of coke burning, oxygen oxidizes the Sn present in the PtSn alloy, which segregates out of the supported Pt nanoparticles. The subsequent H2 reduction restores the PtSn alloy.

[1] "From Pt XAS results, it is clear that an interaction between both metals exists and PtSn alloy formation is detected. However, it is not possible to extract the same conclusions from Sn K edge data, as X-ray absorption is a bulk technique and there are three times more Sn than Pt in the sample and EXAFS results for Pt indicates that only a small fraction of Sn comes into the alloy."

[2] "The results obtained from these innovative real-time characterization studies show a difference in behavior for the catalyst materials (in the presence/absence of Sn as promoter) with regard to both propane dehydrogenation/activation and coke formation (in both the amount and type of coke formed)." 

[3] "In particular, attention has focused, for the first time, upon understanding the effect that multiple reactionregeneration cycles have on the physicochemical properties of the catalyst materials. This includes the reducibility of Pt and Sn, the extent of SnPt alloying, sintering of Pt nanoparticles and the surface properties of Pt."

The work makes use of two separate in situ reactor setups: one that utilizes a powder-containing, plug-flow reactor setup that combines on-line activity measurements with the simultaneous recording of in situ UVVis and Raman spectroscopy data and a second setup consisting of a flow-through cell using a pressed pellet sample that has been developed so that it is possible to perform catalytic reactions with on-line product monitoring at the outlet (mass spectrometer) while performing in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements [10], [11]."

[2] "As a result, we have on-line monitored the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation using a combined in situ UVVis/Raman setup."

[3] "Measurements were taken at the ID26 beamline of ESRF (Grenoble, France). High-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the L3 (11.5637 keV) edges was performed on the Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts under the same gas conditions and reaction temperatures as discussed above for the combined in situ UVVis/Raman spectroscopy measurements."

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses a combined in situ UVVis/Raman setup to monitor coke formation during propane dehydrogenation. It also performs in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy on the catalysts under reaction conditions to probe changes in oxidation state and local structure.

[2] "From the position and shape of XANES spectra, it is clear that during the process of coke burning, oxygen oxidizes the Sn present in the PtSn alloy, which segregates out of the supported Pt nanoparticles. The subsequent H2 reduction restores the PtSn alloy."

[3] "Re-activation treatments in H2 are necessary in order to regenerate the active and selective PtSn alloy phases. However, multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles result in a gradual Sn enrichment of the alloy, which leads to a decrease in the overall dehydrogenation activity."

Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it performs in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy to monitor changes in the oxidation state of Pt and Sn during reaction-regeneration cycles. The data reveals that Sn in the PtSn alloy oxidizes and segregates during coke burning, and that the alloy is restored after H2 reduction. It also shows Sn enrichment of the alloy after multiple cycles, leading to decreased activity.
