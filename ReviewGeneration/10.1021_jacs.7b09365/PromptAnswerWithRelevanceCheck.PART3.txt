<quotes>
[1] "In situ X-ray absorption spectra at the Co K-edge were collected to gain further electronic and structural information about the Co sites in the as-synthesized materials as well as to identify changes associated with initial catalyst activation."

[2] "Upon activation in O2, a slight increase in the pre-edge peak intensity and a decrease in the white-line intensity occur in the XANES spectra for all samples, pointing to the formation of Co(III) ions—a finding that is corroborated by postcatalysis X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data measured (Figures S10–S14)."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques like X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to probe oxidation state changes of cobalt during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. The in-situ X-ray absorption spectra reveal formation of Co(III) species upon activation in O2.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,该文使用了X射线吸收光谱和X射线光电子能谱等X射线技术来探测钴在丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。原位X射线吸收光谱显示在O2中活化后形成Co(III)物种。
