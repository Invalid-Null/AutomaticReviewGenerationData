[1] "These values greatly exceed what is obtained with pure Pt supported on SiO2 (initial: 105 gC3H6/gPt h, kd of 1.464 h1) and surpass what is observed for PtZn/SiO2 (initial: 703 gC3H6/gPt h; kd of 0.027 h1) and PtGa/SiO2 (initial: 722 gC3H6/gPt h, kd of 0.04 h1) prepared via a similar approach as well as any other PtMn system reported in literature."

[2] "Notably, a material with a similar Mn content but much lower Pt loading of only 0.05 wt % revealed outstanding performance per gPt, ranging among the highest reported productivities (4523 gC3H6/gPt h) to date, with almost no deactivation over 160 h on stream when operating under a partial pressure of H2."

5. Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing that the PtMn/SiO2 catalyst greatly exceeds the performance of pure Pt/SiO2, with higher productivity (initial 822 vs 105 gC3H6/gPt h) and lower deactivation rate (kd 0.018 vs 1.464 h-1). It also shows a PtMn catalyst with ultra-low 0.05 wt% Pt loading has outstanding performance, with productivity among the highest reported (4523 gC3H6/gPt h).

5. 是的,这篇文章评估了载体单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显示PtMn/SiO2催化剂大大超过纯Pt/SiO2的性能,具有更高的产率(初始822 vs 105 gC3H6/gPt h)和更低的失活率(kd 0.018 vs 1.464 h-1)。它还显示含超低0.05 wt% Pt的PtMn催化剂具有杰出的性能,其产率位于已报道的最高水平(4523 gC3H6/gPt h)。

[1] "HAADF-STEM images of PtMn/SiO2 evidence the formation of narrowly distributed and well-dispersed, nanosized particles (1.0 ± 0.3 nm) along with smaller clusters as well as a small minority of single Pt atoms on the support surface (Figure 1B and Supporting Information Figure S5)."

[2] "Notably, EXAFS fitting at the Pt LIII edge after conducting a regeneration cycle on the PtMn/SiO2 material results in an almost identical fit when compared to the pristine material, with almost unchanged CNs (see Supporting Information for detail, Figure S35 and Table S8). This result supports minor particle growth and insignificant structural change during such harsh regeneration conditions, in line with the STEM study."

6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of the supported PtMn catalysts. It shows the PtMn/SiO2 catalyst has narrow size distribution of 1 nm nanoparticles along with some single Pt atoms. It also shows the PtMn nanoparticles have minimal growth and unchanged structure after harsh regeneration, indicating strong metal-support interaction, in contrast to Pt/SiO2.
