<quotes>
[1] "In that context, non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has gained renewed interest in recent years as an alternative propene production route due to a rising propene demand and its current, decreasing production via classical cracking routes as a result of changes in refinery technology."

[2] "The Oleflex process, based on an alumina-supported PtSn system, was one of the first industrially implemented catalysts for PDH in the 1990s to produce propene."  

[3] "Since then, Pt-based bi- and multi-metallic materials have been among the most investigated systems for this transformation."

[4] "While Ga itself exhibits catalytic activity in the PDH reaction, we proposed that its main role in the PtGa system is the improvement of the stability of PtGa alloyed nanoparticles due to strong interaction with GaIII surface sites."
