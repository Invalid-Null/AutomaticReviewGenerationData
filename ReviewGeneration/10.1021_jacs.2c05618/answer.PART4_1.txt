<quotes>
[1] "The general drawback of PDH is its highly endothermic nature (ΔH2980 = 124.3 kJ mol1); this thermodynamic limitation requires high reaction temperatures (550750 C) to reach reasonable conversion levels."

[2] "Both events lead to catalyst deactivation which is combated by constant regeneration cycles."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article summarizes remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it identifies the highly endothermic nature of PDH requiring high reaction temperatures as a drawback. It also notes catalyst deactivation via coking and sintering during operation as an issue that requires constant regeneration cycles.  
</English version answer>
