[1] "While Ga itself exhibits catalytic activity in the PDH reaction, we proposed that its main role in the PtGa system is the improvement of the stability of PtGa alloyed nanoparticles due to strong interaction with GaIII surface sites."

[2] "These values greatly exceed what is obtained with pure Pt supported on SiO2 (initial: 105 gC3H6/gPt h, kd of 1.464 h-1) and surpass what is observed for PtZn/SiO2 (initial: 703 gC3H6/gPt h; kd of 0.027 h-1) and PtGa/SiO2 (initial: 722 gC3H6/gPt h, kd of 0.04 h-1) prepared via a similar approach as well as any other PtMn system reported in literature."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Ga and Pt-Zn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing the PtMn/SiO2 catalyst greatly exceeds the productivity and stability of Pt/SiO2, PtZn/SiO2 and PtGa/SiO2. PtGa is noted to exhibit catalytic activity itself in PDH, with its main role being to improve stability of the PtGa nanoparticles.

答:是的,该文评估了Pt-Ga和Pt-Zn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显示PtMn/SiO2催化剂的生产力和稳定性远远超过Pt/SiO2、PtZn/SiO2和PtGa/SiO2。 PtGa本身在PDH中显示催化活性,其主要作用是改善PtGa纳米粒子的稳定性。
