[1] "The search for catalysts exhibiting high catalytic performances, combined with robustness toward repeated regeneration cycles, is of major importance for further improving PDH catalysts." 

[2] "the catalytic results are summarized in Table 3 (see the Supporting Information for more detail)."

[3] "Overall, experimental characterizations and the MTD simulation are pointing toward a highly segregated structure for the Pt2Mn NPs supported on MnII-decorated SiO2 with noteworthy and unexpected structure."

[4] "The detailed spectroscopic investigations augmented with MTD at the DFT level provide a powerful tool to develop well-defined bimetallic materials and to understand their structure with molecular-level precision, here revealing an unexpectedly segregated structure for a highly performing and robust PDH catalyst."
