Answer: The article does not compare the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:本文没有比较金属和氧化SUPPORTED金属催化剂的选择性谱。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "While Ga itself exhibits catalytic activity in the PDH reaction, we proposed that its main role in the PtGa system is the improvement of the stability of PtGa alloyed nanoparticles due to strong interaction with GaIII surface sites."

[2] "These values greatly exceed what is obtained with pure Pt supported on SiO2 (initial: 105 gC3H6/gPt h, kd of 1.464 h-1) and surpass what is observed for PtZn/SiO2 (initial: 703 gC3H6/gPt h; kd of 0.027 h-1) and PtGa/SiO2 (initial: 722 gC3H6/gPt h, kd of 0.04 h-1) prepared via a similar approach as well as any other PtMn system reported in literature."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Ga and Pt-Zn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing the PtMn/SiO2 catalyst greatly exceeds the productivity and stability of Pt/SiO2, PtZn/SiO2 and PtGa/SiO2. PtGa is noted to exhibit catalytic activity itself in PDH, with its main role being to improve stability of the PtGa nanoparticles.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文评估了Pt-Ga和Pt-Zn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显示PtMn/SiO2催化剂的生产力和稳定性远远超过Pt/SiO2、PtZn/SiO2和PtGa/SiO2。 PtGa本身在PDH中显示催化活性,其主要作用是改善PtGa纳米粒子的稳定性。

<quotes>
[1] "The Oleflex process, based on an alumina-supported PtSn system, was one of the first industrially implemented catalysts for PDH in the 1990s to produce propene."

[2] "Notably, a much higher initial productivity is obtained upon decreasing the Pt loading to 0.05 wt %. While inherently difficult to characterize due to the very low Pt loading, this material—Pt(0.05)Mn/SiO2—shows initial productivity levels that are among the highest reported to date."

[3] "We also performed H2 and CO chemisorption studies showing very similar Qsat values for PtMn/SiO2 (2.6 mmol CO/gPt, 1.6 mmol H2/gPt) and Pt/SiO2 (2.5 mmol CO/gPt, 1.7 mmol H2/gPt) which underlines that there must be an inherent difference in the nanoparticle structure in the two systems given the particle size difference of the two materials (1 nm for PtMn/SiO2 and 2 nm for Pt/SiO2)."

[4] "These values greatly exceed what is obtained with pure Pt supported on SiO2 (initial: 105 gC3H6/gPt h, kd of 1.464 h−1) and surpass what is observed for PtZn/SiO2 (initial: 703 gC3H6/gPt h; kd of 0.027 h−1) and PtGa/SiO2 (initial: 722 gC3H6/gPt h, kd of 0.04 h−1) prepared via a similar approach as well as any other PtMn system reported in literature."

2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn, Pt-Ga, and Pt-Zn for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing the Oleflex Pt-Sn catalyst was one of the first industrially used PDH catalysts. It shows the ultra-low loading Pt-Mn catalyst achieved very high productivity. It compares performance of Pt-Mn to Pt, Pt-Zn, and Pt-Ga, showing Pt-Mn exceeded them all in productivity and stability.

<Chinese version answer>
2. 答:是的,该文评估了Pt合金催化剂,如Pt-Sn、Pt-Ga和Pt-Zn用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显示,Oleflex Pt-Sn催化剂是最早的工业化PDH催化剂之一。它表明超低负载Pt-Mn催化剂实现了非常高的生产率。它比较了Pt-Mn与Pt、Pt-Zn和Pt-Ga的性能,结果显示Pt-Mn的生产率和稳定性都超过了它们所有。
