<quotes>
[1] "The Oleflex process, based on an alumina-supported PtSn system, was one of the first industrially implemented catalysts for PDH in the 1990s to produce propene."
[2] "a noteworthy reported example is PtMn, which displays promising catalytic performance in PDH."  
[3] "These values greatly exceed what is obtained with pure Pt supported on SiO2 (initial: 105 gC3H6/gPt h, kd of 1.464 h1) and surpass what is observed for PtZn/SiO2 (initial: 703 gC3H6/gPt h; kd of 0.027 h1) and PtGa/SiO2 (initial: 722 gC3H6/gPt h, kd of 0.04 h1) prepared via a similar approach as well as any other PtMn system reported in literature."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn, Pt-Ga, and Pt-Zn for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing the Oleflex Pt-Sn catalyst was one of the first industrially implemented PDH catalysts. It also shows the PtMn catalyst displays promising performance compared to Pt/SiO2, PtZn/SiO2, and PtGa/SiO2 catalysts prepared by similar methods.
