 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative files, I have compiled the consistency ratios between each answer file and the correct answers in XML format:

To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the answers in each file to the provided correct answers, assessing if they contained the same key information. The ratios reflect the level of consistency of key details between the two answers for each question.

I hope this compiled XML format with consistency ratios is helpful! Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.
