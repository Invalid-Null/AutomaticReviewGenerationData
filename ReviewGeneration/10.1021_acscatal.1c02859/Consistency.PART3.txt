I carefully compared the English and Chinese answers from each file to the correct answers for each question. I calculated the consistency ratio by determining how much of the information in the answer file matched the correct answer. The ratios are expressed as percentages from 0% (completely inconsistent) to 100% (completely consistent). Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
