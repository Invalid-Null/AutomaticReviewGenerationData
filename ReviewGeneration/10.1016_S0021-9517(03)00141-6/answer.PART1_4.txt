 Unfortunately, this article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3 or Pt-Sn for propane dehydrogenation. The article focuses solely on Cr/Si/Al/O and Cr/Si/Zr/O catalysts synthesized via a thermolytic molecular precursor route. No data or insights are provided on other metal oxide catalysts.

The article does investigate how properties like chromium oxidation state and dispersion affect the performance of the Cr/Si/Al/O and Cr/Si/Zr/O catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation and dehydrogenation. Specific examples are provided comparing different chromium loadings and relating performance to the nature of the chromium species present as characterized by various techniques. However, no broader relationships or mechanistic scenarios are proposed and no other catalyst properties like oxygen mobility or acid-base characteristics are explored.

The article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation, provide any data or characterizations of such catalysts, or investigate how properties like metal particle size or support interactions would affect performance.

No mechanistic pathways or scenarios are proposed for propane dehydrogenation over any of the catalysts studied. The article is focused primarily on reporting the catalytic performance of the Cr/Si/Al/O and Cr/Si/Zr/O materials under various conditions.

Answer: The article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation besides Cr/Si/Al/O and Cr/Si/Zr/O materials made by a thermolytic molecular precursor method. No data, insights or mechanistic proposals are provided on other catalysts systems. The article only explores how chromium dispersion and oxidation state affect the performance of the synthesized Cr-containing catalysts. No supported noble metal catalysts are studied for propane dehydrogenation.

答:这篇文章没有评价任何除Cr/Si/Al/O和Cr/Si/Zr/O以外通过热分解分子前体法制备的有前途的金属氧化物丙烷脱氢催化剂。没有提供其他催化剂系统的数据、见解或机理假设。文章只探讨了铬的分散和氧化态如何影响合成的含铬催化剂的性能。没有研究支持贵金属催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。
