 Unfortunately, I do not see any relevant quotes from the literature that directly address the specific questions asked. The article is focused on discussing the synthesis of Cr/Si/Al/O and Cr/Si/Zr/O catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It does not provide detail on process intensification, techno-economic analysis, safety issues, remaining challenges, computational screening methods, in-situ characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation specifically.
