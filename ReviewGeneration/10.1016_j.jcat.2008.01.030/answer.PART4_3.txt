<quotes>
[1] "Despite efforts toward the development of Au oxidation catalysts, work on less reactive alkanes, such as propane, is lacking."

[2] "One short report published more than a decade ago claimed that Au/TiO2/SiO2 oxidized propane to produce only CO2 (
) and acetone (
) at rather low yields (
)."  

[3] "More recent work on propane oxidation over various gold-supported metal oxides (e.g., CoOx, MnOx, CuO, Fe2O3, and CeO2) yielded only CO2 and H2O."

Answer: The article summarizes remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It identifies that despite efforts in developing Au oxidation catalysts, work on less reactive alkanes like propane is lacking. Previous attempts using Au/TiO2/SiO2 yielded only CO2 and acetone at low yields. Recent work using other Au metal oxide catalysts also only produced CO2 and H2O. So developing effective catalysts for selective propane dehydrogenation remains a challenge needing further research.

Answer: 本文概述了丙烷脱氢催化剂存在的挑战和知识空白。它指出,尽管在开发Au氧化催化剂方面做了努力,但对不太反应性的烷烃(如丙烷)的研究还不足。此前使用Au/TiO2/SiO2的尝试只产生了低产率的CO2和丙酮。最近使用其他Au金属氧化物催化剂也只产生了CO2和H2O。所以,开发有效的选择性丙烷脱氢催化剂仍然是一个需要进一步研究的挑战。
