[1] "Gold supported catalysts (i.e., Au/TiO2, Au/TS-1, and Au/SiTUD) were prepared by the depositionprecipitation (DP) method [73]."

[2] "In the synthesis of a typical Au/TiO2 (catalyst 3), 150 ml of a gold solution (1 g of HAuCl44H2O, Wako,
, in 1 L of water,
) was heated to 343 K under vigorous stirring."

[3] "A series of gold-supported titania catalysts with varying gold content were prepared using the DP synthesis method (Table 2). The gold content in the catalysts varied from 1.2 to 2.2 wt%, with average gold particle diameters (
) increasing from 2.7 to 4.1 nm (catalysts 37)."

Answer: No, the article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize the size distribution of gold nanoparticles, but does not focus on the metal-support interface.

[3] "The initial increase in intensity of the white line may be related to the chemisorption of oxygen on gold particles (AuO complex formation), as the d-orbital electron count of gold decreases due to charge transfer to the
orbital of oxygen [79], [80]." 

[4] "The further decrease and formation of negative features as the reaction reached a steady value after 23 h, corresponds to a reduction of the AuO complex (in the air-calcined sample) by reaction with H2."

Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based in-situ XANES techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis on 1.9 wt% Au/TiO2. It shows initial formation of an AuO complex due to oxygen adsorption, evidenced by an increase in the white line intensity. It also demonstrates a subsequent reduction of this AuO complex over time, seen as negative features in the difference spectra.
