The provided answers do not contain information that is directly relevant to answering the specific questions asked about evaluating metal oxide catalysts, investigating tuning of properties, proposing mechanistic scenarios, exploring metal-support effects, evaluating supported metal catalysts, investigating structure-function relationships, and proposing mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation.

The answers state that the article focuses solely on gold-based catalysts and does not address those broader topic areas. As the answers are not pertinent to the questions posed, I have responded with the designated sentence indicating their lack of relevance.
