Based on my review, none of the answers provided contain information relevant to answering the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The answers focus on oxidation of propane to propylene oxide over gold catalysts supported on titania and do not address effects of metal oxidation states, Pt alloys, electronic/geometric factors, subsurface promoters, synergistic effects, or zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation as asked in the questions.

Therefore, I have determined the answers are not relevant to the questions and have provided the standard response indicating this. No further analysis or aggregation of the answers is necessary.
