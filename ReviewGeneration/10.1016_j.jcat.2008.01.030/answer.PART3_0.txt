Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It examines the effect of varying the gold loading on the Au/TiO2 catalysts from 1.2 to 2.2 wt% using the deposition-precipitation method. Higher gold loadings led to increases in average gold nanoparticle size from 2.7 to 4.1 nm. An intermediate loading of 1.9 wt% Au was found to give the best propane dehydrogenation performance.

[1] In situ Au L3-edge X-ray adsorption fine-structure (XAFS) measurements were carried out at beamline BL9A of the Photon Factory in the Institute of Materials Structure Science, High-Energy Accelerator Research Organization (PF-IMSS-KEK) in Japan. All spectra were obtained in transmission mode using an in situ XAFS cell under reactions conditions.
[2] Fig. 7 presents the in situ Au L3-edge XANES difference spectra
(He, at 443 K before reaction). The figure demonstrates the evolution of some transient resonance in the initial stages of reaction and the development of two distinct negative features at 11,918 and 11,920 eV after 23 h of reaction.

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It examines changes in the Au L3-edge under reaction conditions, showing initial formation of Au-O species followed by partial reduction after steady state is reached. This suggests Au-O complexes may be involved in activating oxygen for propane dehydrogenation.

[1] The in situ Au L3-edge XANES spectra for 1.9 wt% Au/TiO2 also showed three peaks at 11,935, 11,948, and 11,971 eV, which also can be attributed to Au(0). The small shift of the features toward higher energies can be attributed to the presence of smaller gold particles in the catalyst [78]. 
[2] The intensity of the first feature in the Au L3-edge (white line) arises from unoccupied d-states, and thus interactions between adsorbed molecules and gold clusters should reflect changes in this resonance [79], [80]. The in situ Au L3-edge XANES difference spectra
(He, at 443 K before reaction) (Fig. 7) reveal the evolution of a transient resonance (white line) during the first 1.5 h of reaction, followed by the full development of two negative features at 11,918 and 11,920 eV after 23 h of reaction.

Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy to probe oxidation state changes of gold during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows initial formation of Au-O species, indicated by intensity changes in the white line region, followed by partial reduction after steady state is reached. This demonstrates changes in the oxidation state of gold under working conditions.
