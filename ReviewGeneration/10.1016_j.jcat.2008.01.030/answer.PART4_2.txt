[1] Despite efforts toward the development of Au oxidation catalysts, work on less reactive alkanes, such as propane, is lacking.

[2] One short report published more than a decade ago claimed that Au/TiO2/SiO2 oxidized propane to produce only CO2 (
) and acetone (
) at rather low yields (
) [23]. 

[3] More recent work on propane oxidation over various gold-supported metal oxides (e.g., CoOx, MnOx, CuO, Fe2O3, and CeO2) yielded only CO2 and H2O [26], [27], [28].

[4] Despite this considerable interest in gold-supported catalysts for hydrocarbon selective oxidation, work on less reactive alkanes, such as propane, is lacking.

[5] Although propane conversion does not appear in the product selectivity, it should affect the overall process yield. From Fig. 1, the adiabatic temperature change (
) at steady state also could be estimated using
, where X is conversion,
is the standard enthalpy change of reaction,
is the mean heat capacity of species i, and
and
are the molar flow rates of species i and A, respectively [75]. For catalyst X in Fig. 1, propane (species A) conversion was 0.05,
was estimated as
, the average value of the enthalpy of propane dehydrogenation with O2 (C3H8 + O2  C3H6 + H2O;
) and with H2 and O2 at 298 K (C3H8 + H2 + O2  C3H6 + H2O;
), and the feed heat capacity,
, is taken as 0.35 kJmol1K1, resulting in an adiabatic temperature rise of 34 K. In this hypothetical worst-case scenario, when the reaction is carried out adiabatically rather than isothermally as studied here, the reactor temperature still will be relatively moderate and close to 473 K. 

[6] With current known catalysts, propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) can be achieved directly; however, although the reaction is not limited by equilibrium, it requires high reaction temperatures [60], [86].

Answer: Yes, the article summarizes remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It notes that despite efforts toward developing Au oxidation catalysts, work on less reactive alkanes like propane is lacking, with some past work only yielding CO2 and acetone at low yields, or CO2 and H2O. The article also notes that propane conversion affects overall process yield, and calculates an adiabatic temperature rise to show the reactor temperature would still be moderate in a hypothetical-case adiabatic scenario. Finally, it states that with current known catalysts, propane ODH requires high temperatures, presenting a remaining challenge.

Answer: 是的,该文档总结了丙烷脱氢催化剂中剩余的挑战和知识空白。它指出,尽管在发展Au氧化催化剂方面做了努力,但对较不活泼的烷烃如丙烷的研究还不足,一些过去的工作只产生了CO2和丙酮,产率较低;或只产生CO2和H2O。该文档还指出,丙烷转化会影响整体工艺产率,并计算了绝热温升以展示在一种假想的最坏绝热场景下,反应器温度仍将是适中的。最后,它指出,就当前已知的催化剂而言,丙烷氧化脱氢仍需要高温,这是一个剩余的挑战。
