[1] Atomic resolution microscopy analysis, as well as elemental mapping, was performed on the JEM ARM200F microscope working at 200 kV with a probe Cs-corrector at Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (DICP, CAS). For HAADF imaging, a convergence angle of 23 mrad and a collection angle range of 68174 mrad were adapted for incoherent imaging, providing characteristic high contrast between Pd- and Bi-rich atomic columns.

[2] The PdBi sample composition, as well as element spatial distribution, was studied using an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (EX-230 100 mm2 detector) equipped on ARM200F.
