[1] Although many bimetallic compositions have been synthesized and evaluated for different catalytic reactions, for many alloys, structural details, for example, surface coverage, particle morphology, atomic order, surface structures, and their effect on the catalytic performance, have not been determined. 

[2] Prototypical examples include propane dehydrogenation (PDH) and acetylene semihydrogenation reactions. Specifically, PDH is an endothermic reaction and requires high temperature (773-973 K), where hydrogenolysis, a structure-sensitive reaction, also occurs on Pd ensembles forming methane, ethane, and ethylene, leading to low propylene selectivity.

[3] Palladium (Pd) is highly active for these two catalytic processes but exhibits low selectivity toward the desired products. Therefore, developing fundamental understandings on how to improve the selectivity will lead to effective catalysts for these and other catalytic reactions.

[4] The incorporation of a second metal to form intermetallic alloys or intermetallic compounds (IMCs) has been used to reduce the surface ensemble size to enhance the olefin selectivity in PDH and acetylene semihydrogenation. 

[5] For example, a variety of intermetallic Pd catalysts, PdFe, PdMn, PdCu, PdIn, PdGa, PdAg, PdAu, and PdZn, have shown substantially enhanced olefin selectivity for PDH and acetylene semihydrogenation compared with Pd nanoparticles (NPs).

1. The article does not provide detailed background information on the importance of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation in the chemical industry. It briefly mentions that propane dehydrogenation is used to produce propylene, which is an important feedstock in the chemical industry, but does not elaborate on the value or specific applications of propylene.

2. The article explains that propane dehydrogenation requires high temperatures (773-973 K), where undesired hydrogenolysis reactions also occur on Pd catalysts, leading to low propylene selectivity. It does not go into details about how catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation barriers.

3. The article introduces some intermetallic Pd catalysts such as PdFe, PdMn, PdCu, PdIn, PdGa, PdAg, PdAu, and PdZn that have shown enhanced olefin selectivity for propane dehydrogenation compared to Pd nanoparticles. It does not mention other major catalyst classes explored for this reaction.

4. The article does not discuss the thermodynamic constraints or kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation in any quantitative detail. 

5. The article does not describe any DFT calculations applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling efforts or insights into propane dehydrogenation kinetics.

7. The article does not describe any computational or experimental work identifying catalyst descriptors that correlate to propane dehydrogenation performance.
