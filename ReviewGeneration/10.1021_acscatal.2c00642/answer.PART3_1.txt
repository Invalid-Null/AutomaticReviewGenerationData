1. In this work, we tuned surface Pd coordination by varying bismuth loadings in the PdBi alloy system, facilitating different catalytic performances for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) and acetylene semihydrogenation model reactions.
2. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADFSTEM), energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS), absorption spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFTS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to characterize the evolution of the surface and bulk structures in PdBi catalysts with changing Bi composition.
3. No relevant quotes.
4. No relevant quotes.
5. At low Bi loading, the catalyst nanoparticle (NP) surface was partially transformed into the PdBi intermetallic compound (IMC). The partially alloyed surface has improved catalytic performance compared with Pd NPs.
6. Atomic resolution microscopy analysis, as well as elemental mapping, was performed on the JEM ARM200F microscope working at 200 kV with a probe Cs-corrector at Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (DICP, CAS). 
7. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements at the Pd K-edge (24350 eV) were performed on the 10-BM bending magnet beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MRCAT) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory.
