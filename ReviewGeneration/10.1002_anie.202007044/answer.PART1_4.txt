 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature to answer any of the questions. The article focuses on the ultrafast synthesis of Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalysts by encapsulating Pt and Sn nanoclusters into ZSM-5 zeolite during crystallization. It does not evaluate metal oxide catalysts, tune their properties, propose mechanistic scenarios, or explore metal-support effects for propane dehydrogenation. The article also does not evaluate supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation. It does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape and support interactions affect performance of supported metal catalysts. The article does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts either.
