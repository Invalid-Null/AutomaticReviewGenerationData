         [1] "Encapsulating metal nanoclusters into zeolites combines the superior catalytic activity of the nanoclusters with high stability and unique shape selectivity of the crystalline microporous materials." 
         
         [2] "The resultant nanoclusters-encapsulated ZSM-5 (Pt/Sn-ZSM-5) catalyst exhibits an excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, an industrially important reaction for propene production."
         
         [3] "The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibited exceptional activity and selectivity with stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."
         
         [4] "Ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization."
         
         [5] "The addition of Sn was found to be crucial to regulating the size as well as the dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."
         
         [6] "The effectiveness of the ultrafast encapsulation was verified by testing the catalytic activities of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, a catalytic reaction of high potential for facilitating propene production and thus attracting a great attention toward catalyst innovation."

         Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like ultrafast encapsulation to synchronize nanocluster formation with zeolite crystallization to achieve highly dispersed nanoclusters encapsulated in the zeolite. Adding Sn is shown to help regulate Pt nanocluster size and dispersion. The catalytic activity results verify the effectiveness of the ultrafast encapsulation method for optimizing dispersion.
