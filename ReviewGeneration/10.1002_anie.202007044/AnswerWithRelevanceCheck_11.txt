      [1] "Encapsulating metal nanoclusters into zeolites enables a synergistic effect in heterogeneous catalysis that combines superior activity of the nanoclusters with high stability and unique shape selectivity of the zeolites.4"
      [2] "Figure4ad displays the TEM images of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites, which were synthesized with different Sn contents while maintaining the same Pt loading (ca. 0.32wt%). Without the addition of any Sn, the Pt species tended to agglomerate and form nanoparticles of ca. 4nm. When an approximately equivalent amount of Sn was added, the size of the Pt nanoclusters was decreased and the dispersion was much improved."   
      [3] "An optimal Pt/Sn ratio (in weight) was found to be about 1:2, which resulted in Pt nanoclusters with a size of ca 1nm."

      Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like varying the Sn content to modulate the Pt nanoparticle size and dispersion during zeolite synthesis. Without Sn addition, Pt tended to form larger 4 nm particles, but an optimal Pt:Sn ratio of 1:2 resulted in well dispersed 1 nm Pt nanoclusters.

      Answer: 是的,该文献研究了针对优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它讨论了如变化Sn含量来调控Pt纳米粒子的大小和在分子筛合成过程中的分散度等技术。没有Sn的添加,Pt趋向于形成较大的4 nm颗粒,但Pt:Sn为1:2的最佳比例导致分散良好的1 nm Pt纳米簇。

      [1] "Figure2b and c show a high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and corresponding Pt/Sn particle size distribution of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 synthesized for 5min, which confirm the presence of nanoclusters of ca. 1nm in crystalline ZSM-5 zeolite and their distribution."

      [2] "Figure3c shows the TEM image of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite synthesized at 210C for 2min. The nanoclusters were of slightly larger size compared to those synthesized at 190C, probably due to the faster aggregation at a higher synthesis temperature."  

      [3] "Figure4ad displays the TEM images of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites, which were synthesized with different Sn contents while maintaining the same Pt loading (ca. 0.32wt%)."

      Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like STEM and TEM to characterize metal-support interfaces in catalysts. It uses these techniques to study the size, dispersion, and distribution of Pt and Sn nanoclusters in the zeolite supports. The images provide insights into how factors like Sn content and synthesis temperature affect the nanocluster formation.
