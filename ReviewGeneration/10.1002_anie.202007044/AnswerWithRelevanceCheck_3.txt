         [1] "Encapsulating metal nanoclusters into zeolites enables a synergistic effect in heterogeneous catalysis that combines superior activity of the nanoclusters with high stability and unique shape selectivity of the zeolites.4"

         [2] "Figure4ad displays the TEM images of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites, which were synthesized with different Sn contents while maintaining the same Pt loading (ca. 0.32wt%). Without the addition of any Sn, the Pt species tended to agglomerate and form nanoparticles of ca. 4nm. When an approximately equivalent amount of Sn was added, the size of the Pt nanoclusters was decreased and the dispersion was much improved."  

         [3] "An optimal Pt/Sn ratio (in weight) was found to be about 1:2, which resulted in Pt nanoclusters with a size of ca 1nm."

         Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like varying the Sn content to modulate the Pt nanoparticle size and dispersion during zeolite synthesis. Without Sn addition, Pt tended to form larger 4 nm particles, but an optimal Pt:Sn ratio of 1:2 resulted in well dispersed 1 nm nanoclusters.

         Answer: 是的,该文献研究了针对优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它讨论了如变化Sn含量来调控Pt纳米粒子的大小和在分子筛合成过程中的分散度等技术。没有Sn的添加,Pt趋向于形成较大的4 nm颗粒,但Pt:Sn为1:2的最佳比例导致分散良好的1 nm Pt纳米簇。

         [1] "Ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization."  

         [2] "The role of Sn is supposed to modulate the interaction between the Pt precursor and the zeolite precursor, thus affecting size and dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."

         [3] "The addition of Sn was found to be crucial to regulating the size as well as the dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."

         [4] "Without the addition of any Sn, the Pt species tended to agglomerate and form nanoparticles of ca. 4nm. When an approximately equivalent amount of Sn was added, the size of the Pt nanoclusters was decreased and the dispersion was much improved."

         [5] "An optimal Pt/Sn ratio (in weight) was found to be about 1:2, which resulted in Pt nanoclusters with a size of ca 1nm."

         Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like adding Sn to modulate the interaction between Pt and the zeolite precursor to affect the size and dispersion of Pt nanoclusters. Specific examples show that adding Sn crucial for regulating Pt nanoparticle size and dispersion, with an optimal Pt:Sn ratio of 1:2 giving 1 nm Pt nanoclusters.
