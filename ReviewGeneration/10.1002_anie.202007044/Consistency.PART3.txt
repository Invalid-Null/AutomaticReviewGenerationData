I parsed the correct answer text and each comparative answer file to extract the relevant quotes and answers. I compared the quotes and answers from each file to the correct ones to calculate a consistency percentage for each question and file. This percentage represents how consistent that file's answer is with the correct answer provided. The results are formatted as requested in the JSON structure, with each question number mapping to a dictionary of file names and consistency percentages. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the comparison output.
