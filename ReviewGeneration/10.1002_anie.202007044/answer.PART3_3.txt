<quotes>
[1] "Encapsulating metal nanoclusters into zeolites combines the superior catalytic activity of the nanoclusters with high stability and unique shape selectivity of the crystalline microporous materials."

[2] "The resultant nanoclusters-encapsulated ZSM-5 (Pt/Sn-ZSM-5) catalyst exhibits an excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, an industrially important reaction for propene production."

[3] "The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibited exceptional activity and selectivity with stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like ultrafast encapsulation to synchronize nanocluster formation with zeolite crystallization to achieve highly dispersed nanoclusters encapsulated in the zeolite. The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst prepared this way showed excellent activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation.

[1] "Figure2b and c show a high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and corresponding Pt/Sn particle size distribution of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 synthesized for 5min, which confirm the presence of nanoclusters of ca. 1nm in crystalline ZSM-5 zeolite and their distribution."

[2] "The X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) mapping in FigureS2 indicates that both Pt and Sn were homogenously distributed in the zeolite."

[3] "Figure4ad displays the TEM images of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites, which were synthesized with different Sn contents while maintaining the same Pt loading (ca. 0.32wt%)."
