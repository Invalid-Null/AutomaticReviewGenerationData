[1] The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 prepared via the ultrafast encapsulation exhibited a much longer lifetime while maintaining high conversion and selectivity. 

[2] Sn has been considered as a promotor in Pt-containing zeolites for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, which can in particular help improve the selectivity.

[3] the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite prepared by the impregnation method, which was described above (FigureS4), was tested as comparison. As seen from Figure5b, a high selectivity of about 98% was achieved, which is probably due to the suppression of side reactions under an optimal Sn/Pt ratio of about 2.

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates a Pt-Sn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that adding Sn as a promoter to Pt in a ZSM-5 zeolite improved the selectivity to about 98-99% for propene production. The ultrafast encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibited high activity and selectivity over prolonged reaction cycles. An optimal Sn/Pt ratio of around 2 was found to maximize selectivity by suppressing side reactions.

[1] The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite prepared by the impregnation method, which was described above (FigureS4), was tested as comparison. 

[2] The Pt-ZSM-5 prepared through the ultrafast encapsulation was active initially but experienced a fast deactivation (Figure5a)

[3] the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite prepared via the ultrafast encapsulation exhibited a much longer lifetime while maintaining high conversion and selectivity.

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates ZSM-5 zeolite support for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 prepared by ultrafast encapsulation had high activity and longevity, outperforming Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 prepared by impregnation and Pt-ZSM-5 without Sn. This demonstrates the effectiveness of ultrafast encapsulation for making active and stable propane dehydrogenation catalysts using ZSM-5 support.
