[1] "Encapsulating metal nanoclusters into zeolites enables a synergistic effect in heterogeneous catalysis that combines superior activity of the nanoclusters with high stability and unique shape selectivity of the zeolites.4"

[2] "Figure4ad displays the TEM images of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites, which were synthesized with different Sn contents while maintaining the same Pt loading (ca. 0.32wt%). Without the addition of any Sn, the Pt species tended to agglomerate and form nanoparticles of ca. 4nm. When an approximately equivalent amount of Sn was added, the size of the Pt nanoclusters was decreased and the dispersion was much improved."  

[3] "An optimal Pt/Sn ratio (in weight) was found to be about 1:2, which resulted in Pt nanoclusters with a size of ca. 1nm."
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like varying the Sn content to modulate the Pt nanoparticle size and dispersion during zeolite synthesis. Without Sn addition, Pt tended to form larger 4 nm particles, but an optimal Pt:Sn ratio of 1:2 resulted in well dispersed 1 nm Pt nanoclusters.

[1] "Figure2b and c show a high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and corresponding Pt/Sn particle size distribution of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 synthesized for 5min, which confirm the presence of nanoclusters of ca. 1nm in crystalline ZSM-5 zeolite and their distribution."

[2] "Figure3c shows the TEM image of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite synthesized at 210C for 2min. The nanoclusters were of slightly larger size compared to those synthesized at 190C, probably due to the faster aggregation at a higher synthesis temperature."

[3] "Figure4ad displays the TEM images of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites, which were synthesized with different Sn contents while maintaining the same Pt loading (ca. 0.32wt%). Without the addition of any Sn, the Pt species tended to agglomerate and form nanoparticles of ca. 4nm. When an approximately equivalent amount of Sn was added, the size of the Pt nanoclusters was decreased and the dispersion was much improved."

[1] "Encapsulating metal nanoclusters into zeolites combines the superior catalytic activity of the nanoclusters with high stability and unique shape selectivity of the crystalline microporous materials."

[2] "The preparation of such bifunctional catalysts, however, is often restricted by the mismatching in time scale between the fast formation of nanoclusters and the slow crystallization of zeolites."  

[3] "In this work, we focus on encapsulating Pt and Sn nanoclusters into a high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite to demonstrate the proof of concept."

[4] "The in situ encapsulation can proceed very fast and complete in just a few minutes, where ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization."

[5] "The addition of Sn was found to be crucial to regulating the size as well as the dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."

[6] "The effectiveness of the ultrafast encapsulation was verified by testing the catalytic activities of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, a catalytic reaction of high potential for facilitating propene production and thus attracting a great attention toward catalyst innovation."
</quotes>
