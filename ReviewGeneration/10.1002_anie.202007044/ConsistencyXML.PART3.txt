To determine the consistency percentages, I compared the key ideas and details between each answer file's response and the correct answer provided. I made a rough judgment to assign percentages indicating the degree of consistency. For completely consistent answers I assigned 100%, for partially consistent answers I estimated a percentage based on the overlap of key details, and for completely inconsistent/unrelated answers I assigned 0%.
