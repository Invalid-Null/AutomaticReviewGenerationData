[1] "Encapsulating metal nanoclusters into zeolites combines the superior catalytic activity of the nanoclusters with high stability and unique shape selectivity of the crystalline microporous materials."

[2] "The preparation of such bifunctional catalysts, however, is often restricted by the mismatching in time scale between the fast formation of nanoclusters and the slow crystallization of zeolites."  

[3] "In this work, we focus on encapsulating Pt and Sn nanoclusters into a high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite to demonstrate the proof of concept."

[4] "The in situ encapsulation can proceed very fast and complete in just a few minutes, where ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization."

[5] "The addition of Sn was found to be crucial to regulating the size as well as the dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."

[6] "The effectiveness of the ultrafast encapsulation was verified by testing the catalytic activities of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, a catalytic reaction of high potential for facilitating propene production and thus attracting a great attention toward catalyst innovation."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like ultrafast encapsulation to synchronize nanocluster formation with zeolite crystallization, enabling in situ encapsulation of metal nanoclusters like Pt/Sn into zeolite supports like ZSM-5 within minutes. Adding Sn is shown to help regulate Pt nanocluster size and dispersion. The catalytic activity results verify the effectiveness of the ultrafast encapsulation method for optimizing dispersion.

[1] "Figure2b and c show a high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and corresponding Pt/Sn particle size distribution of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 synthesized for 5min, which confirm the presence of nanoclusters of ca. 1nm in crystalline ZSM-5 zeolite and their distribution."

[2] "The X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) mapping in FigureS2 indicates that both Pt and Sn were homogenously distributed in the zeolite."

[3] "Figure3c shows the TEM image of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite synthesized at 210C for 2min. The nanoclusters were of slightly larger size compared to those synthesized at 190C, probably due to the faster aggregation at a higher synthesis temperature."

[4] "Figure4ad displays the TEM images of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites, which were synthesized with different Sn contents while maintaining the same Pt loading (ca. 0.32wt%)."

[5] "TEM images in FigureS5 depict that the amount of Pt nanoclusters grew along with the transformation from amorphous precursor to crystalline zeolite."

[6] "TEM images in FigureS17 of the used catalyst shows that the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst still featured well-dispersed nanoclusters, after cycles of reaction and regeneration."
