<quotes>
[1] "Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibited exceptional activity and selectivity with stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."

[2] "The resultant nanoclusters-encapsulated ZSM-5 (Pt/Sn-ZSM-5) catalyst exhibits an excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, an industrially important reaction for propene production."

[3] "The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite prepared by the impregnation method, which was described above (FigureS4), was tested as comparison." 

[4] "In stark contrast, the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 prepared via the ultrafast encapsulation exhibited a much longer lifetime while maintaining high conversion and selectivity."
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates ZSM-5 zeolite support for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 prepared by ultrafast encapsulation exhibits excellent activity, selectivity and stability for propane dehydrogenation to propene. Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 by impregnation deactivates faster.

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 prepared via the ultrafast encapsulation exhibited a much longer lifetime while maintaining high conversion and selectivity. 

[2] Sn has been considered as a promotor in Pt-containing zeolites for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, which can in particular help improve the selectivity.

[3] the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite prepared by the impregnation method, which was described above (FigureS4), was tested as comparison. As seen from Figure5b, a high selectivity of about 98% was achieved, which is probably due to the suppression of side reactions under an optimal Sn/Pt ratio of about 2.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates a Pt-Sn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that adding Sn as a promoter to Pt in a ZSM-5 zeolite improved the selectivity to about 98-99% for propene production. The ultrafast encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibited high activity and selectivity over prolonged reaction cycles. An optimal Sn/Pt ratio of around 2 was found to maximize selectivity by suppressing side reactions.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章评估了Pt-Sn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它显示在ZSM-5沸石中以Sn作为Pt的助剂提高了丙烯产物的选择性至约98-99%。超快速包封的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5在延长的反应周期中展现出高活性和选择性。Sn/Pt质量比约为2时可以通过抑制副反应最大化选择性。

[1] The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite prepared by the impregnation method, which was described above (FigureS4), was tested as comparison. 

[2] The Pt-ZSM-5 prepared through the ultrafast encapsulation was active initially but experienced a fast deactivation (Figure5a)

</quotes>

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates ZSM-5 zeolite support for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 prepared by ultrafast encapsulation had high activity and longevity, outperforming Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 prepared by impregnation and Pt-ZSM-5 without Sn. This demonstrates the effectiveness of ultrafast encapsulation for making active and stable propane dehydrogenation catalysts using ZSM-5 support.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章评估了ZSM-5沸石作为丙烷脱氢催化剂的支撑体。它显示超快速包封制备的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5具有高活性和长寿命,优于浸渍法制备的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5和不含Sn的Pt-ZSM-5。这证明了超快速包封技术制备活性稳定的丙烷脱氢催化剂在使用ZSM-5支撑体方面的有效性。
