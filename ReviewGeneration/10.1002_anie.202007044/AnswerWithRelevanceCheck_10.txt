         [1] "Encapsulating metal nanoclusters into zeolites combines the superior catalytic activity of the nanoclusters with high stability and unique shape selectivity of the crystalline microporous materials."
         
         [2] "The resultant nanoclusters-encapsulated ZSM-5 (Pt/Sn-ZSM-5) catalyst exhibits an excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, an industrially important reaction for propene production."
         
         [3] "The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibited exceptional activity and selectivity with stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."
         
         [4] "In this work, we focus on encapsulating Pt and Sn nanoclusters into a high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite to demonstrate the proof of concept."

         Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like ultrafast encapsulation to synchronize nanocluster formation with zeolite crystallization to achieve highly dispersed nanoclusters encapsulated in the zeolite. An example is encapsulating Pt/Sn nanoclusters into high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite. The resultant Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst showed excellent activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation.

         [1] "Ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization."
         
         [2] "The role of Sn is supposed to modulate the interaction between the Pt precursor and the zeolite precursor, thus affecting size and dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."
         
         [3] "The addition of Sn was found to be crucial to regulating the size as well as the dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."
         
         [4] "Without the addition of any Sn, the Pt species tended to agglomerate and form nanoparticles of ca. 4nm. When an approximately equivalent amount of Sn was added, the size of the Pt nanoclusters was decreased and the dispersion was much improved."
         
         [5] "An optimal Pt/Sn ratio (in weight) was found to be about 1:2, which resulted in Pt nanoclusters with a size of ca 1nm."

         Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like adding Sn to modulate the interaction between Pt and the zeolite precursor to affect the size and dispersion of Pt nanoclusters. Specific examples show adding Sn is crucial for regulating Pt nanoparticle size and dispersion, with an optimal Pt:Sn ratio of 1:2 giving 1 nm Pt nanoclusters.
