         [1] "Ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization."

         [2] "The role of Sn is supposed to modulate the interaction between the Pt precursor and the zeolite precursor, thus affecting size and dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."

         [3] "The addition of Sn was found to be crucial to regulating the size as well as the dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."

         [4] "Without the addition of any Sn, the Pt species tended to agglomerate and form nanoparticles of ca. 4nm. When an approximately equivalent amount of Sn was added, the size of the Pt nanoclusters was decreased and the dispersion was much improved." 

         [5] "An optimal Pt/Sn ratio (in weight) was found to be about 1:2, which resulted in Pt nanoclusters with a size of ca 1nm."

         Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like adding Sn to modulate the interaction between Pt and the zeolite precursor to affect the size and dispersion of Pt nanoclusters. Specific examples show that adding Sn crucial for regulating Pt nanoparticle size and dispersion, with an optimal Pt:Sn ratio of 1:2 giving 1 nm Pt nanoclusters.
