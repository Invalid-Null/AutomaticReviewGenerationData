<English version answer>
Answer: No, the article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on magnesium vanadates, magnesium molybdates, and some mixed metal oxides containing vanadium, molybdenum and magnesium.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:没有,该文没有评估Cr2O3、Pt-Sn、Ga2O3等有前景的金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它主要集中在镁钒酸盐、镁钼酸盐以及一些包含钒、钼和镁的混合氧化物上。

Answer: No, the article does not specifically investigate how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It focuses more on the bulk structure and composition of different metal oxide catalysts.
</English version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "The reaction is believed to proceed by a Marsvan Krevelen reaction mechanism [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], in which adsorbed propane reacts with lattice oxygen and the reduced metal oxide reacts with adsorbed, dissociated O2"

[2] "These data combined with the reactor data demonstrate that the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane occurs by the Marsvan Krevelen reaction mechanism."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes that propane oxidative dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. This involves propane reacting with lattice oxygen to form propylene, reducing the metal oxide. The reduced catalyst then reacts with gas phase O2 to reoxidize itself and complete the catalytic cycle. The in situ Raman spectroscopy data supports this mechanistic proposal.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文提出丙烷在所研究的金属氧化物催化剂上的氧化脱氢遵循Mars-van Krevelen机制。这包括丙烷与晶格氧反应生成丙烯,还原金属氧化物。被还原的催化剂然后与气相O2反应重新氧化自己,完成催化循环。原位拉曼光谱数据支持这一机理假设。

<quotes>

[1] "A significant improvement in the conversion and selectivity of Mg3(VO4)2 (C) was observed with the substitution of molybdenum into the structure." 

[2] "The increase in conversion and selectivity seen with molybdenum substitution is associated with Mg cation vacancies formed from the substitution of Mo6+ for V5+."

[3] "The cation vacancies result in a more basic oxide anion and the data suggest that the vacancies allow a more facile diffusion of the lattice oxygen to the surface of the catalyst."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties affects performance. It shows molybdenum substitution creates Mg cation vacancies, making the oxide anion more basic and improving oxygen diffusion, resulting in higher conversion and selectivity.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

答:是的,这篇文章研究了如何调谐氧化态,氧的迁移性和酸碱性质以影响性能。它展示了钼取代产生镁阳离子空位,使氧化物离子更基本,改进氧的扩散,导致更高的转化率和选择性。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "The reaction is believed to proceed by a Marsvan Krevelen reaction mechanism, in which adsorbed propane reacts with lattice oxygen and the reduced metal oxide reacts with adsorbed, dissociated O2."

[2] "Although the peak intensities decrease during the reaction with propane, peaks are observed in the in situ Raman spectra until the gas-phase O2 in the reaction stream had been consumed in the reaction."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article proposes the reaction proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where propane reacts with lattice oxygen, reducing the catalyst, which then reoxidizes with gaseous O2. This is supported by Raman data showing reduction of catalysts during reaction until gaseous oxygen is fully consumed.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 

答:是的,这篇文章提出反应通过Mars-van Krevelen机理进行,丙烷与晶格氧反应,减少催化剂,然后催化剂用气态O2氧化。这是拉曼数据支持的,显示反应过程中催化剂被还原,直到气态氧被完全消耗。
