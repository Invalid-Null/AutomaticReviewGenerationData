 Unfortunately, this article does not provide direct information to answer the questions posed. It is focused on describing experiments with catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene using magnesium vanadates and molybdates, rather than providing broader background on the importance and mechanisms of propane dehydrogenation. As such, there are no relevant quotes from the article for the questions asked.
