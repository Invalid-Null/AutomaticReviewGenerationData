<English version answer>

Answer: No, the article does not evaluate promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on magnesium vanadates, magnesium molybdates, and supported vanadium oxides.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

答:没有,这篇文章没有评估像Cr2O3,Pt-Sn,Ga2O3这样有前景的金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它集中在镁钒酸盐,镁钼酸盐和支持式钒氧化物上。

<quotes>

[1] "A significant improvement in the conversion and selectivity of Mg3(VO4)2 (C) was observed with the substitution of molybdenum into the structure." 

[2] "The increase in conversion and selectivity seen with molybdenum substitution is associated with Mg cation vacancies formed from the substitution of Mo6+ for V5+."

[3] "The cation vacancies result in a more basic oxide anion and the data suggest that the vacancies allow a more facile diffusion of the lattice oxygen to the surface of the catalyst."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties affects performance. It shows molybdenum substitution creates Mg cation vacancies, making the oxide anion more basic and improving oxygen diffusion, resulting in higher conversion and selectivity.

[1] "The reaction is believed to proceed by a Marsvan Krevelen reaction mechanism, in which adsorbed propane reacts with lattice oxygen and the reduced metal oxide reacts with adsorbed, dissociated O2."

[2] "Although the peak intensities decrease during the reaction with propane, peaks are observed in the in situ Raman spectra until the gas-phase O2 in the reaction stream had been consumed in the reaction."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article proposes the reaction proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where propane reacts with lattice oxygen, reducing the catalyst, which then reoxidizes with gaseous O2. This is supported by Raman data showing reduction of catalysts during reaction until gaseous oxygen is fully consumed.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 

答:是的,这篇文章提出反应通过Mars-van Krevelen机理进行,丙烷与晶格氧反应,减少催化剂,然后催化剂用气态O2氧化。这是拉曼数据支持的,显示反应过程中催化剂被还原,直到气态氧被完全消耗。

Answer: No, the article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects or provide insights into activity and selectivity modulation for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It focuses on bulk mixed metal oxides.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:没有,这篇文章没有探索金属-支持体界面效应,也没有提供对丙烷脱氢催化剂活性和选择性调控的见解。它集中在混合金属氧化物的块体上。

Answer: No, the article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses solely on mixed metal oxide catalysts.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

答:没有,这篇文章没有评估任何Pt,Pd或Ir等单金属负载型催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它仅聚焦于混合金属氧化物催化剂。

Answer: No, since the article does not investigate supported metal catalysts, it does not provide any data or insights into how properties like metal particle size, shape, support interactions, etc. affect performance for propane dehydrogenation. The focus is solely on bulk, mixed metal oxides.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

答:没有,由于文章没有研究支持金属催化剂,所以也没有提供任何数据或见解诸如金属颗粒尺寸、形状、支持体相互作用等对丙烷脱氢性能的影响。文章只聚焦于大块混合金属氧化物。

<English version answer>
Answer: No, since the article evaluates mixed metal oxide catalysts rather than supported metals, it does not propose mechanistic pathways involving steps, intermediates or active sites for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

答:没有,由于这篇文章评估的是混合金属氧化物催化剂而不是载体金属,所以它没有提出丙烷在载体金属催化剂上脱氢的机理路径,涉及步骤、中间体或活性位点。
