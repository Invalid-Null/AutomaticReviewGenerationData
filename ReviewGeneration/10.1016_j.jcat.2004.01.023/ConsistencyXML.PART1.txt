To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key semantic content between each answer file's English version answer and the corresponding correct answer in English. I made judgments on whether the key relevant facts and statements were captured to determine approximate consistency percentages. For completely inconsistent answers I assigned 0%, completely consistent 100%, and intermediate degrees of partial consistency I roughly quantified between 20-80%. The analysis is an approximation but aims to accurately reflect the degree of aligning content.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
