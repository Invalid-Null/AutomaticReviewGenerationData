<quotes>
[1] "The aim of this research was to explore the possibilities offered by this combination. The chosen reaction (propane dehydrogenation, C3H8 -> C3H6 + H2) has been previously studied in membrane reactors [12] and TZFBR [14]."

[2] "When the Pd membrane is inserted in the TZFBR, the removal of hydrogen from the reaction media can cause two important changes: (a) the reaction rate is increased, which favours larger propane conversion, being at least in theory possible to surpass the maximum conversion achievable in a conventional reactor (given by the thermodynamic equilibrium); (b) the lower the hydrogen partial pressure, the faster the coke formation, as has been previously observed in fixed bed membrane reactors [11], [12]."  

[3] "The experimental results are shown in Fig. 8. Propane conversion and selectivity to propene vs. percentage of oxygen in the feed are plotted for several operating conditions."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
7. Yes, the article evaluates different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation, specifically comparing TZFBR and membrane reactors. It finds that combining a Pd membrane with a TZFBR can increase reaction rate and conversion by removing hydrogen, but also increases coke formation. Experimental data on propane conversion and selectivity using a combined TZFBR-membrane reactor are provided.

[1] "The Two-Zone Fluid Bed Reactor (TZFBR) is a system designed to counteract the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "Fluid bed reactors have been employed combined with membranes in several works, but never in a situation where the bottom of the reactor was employed for catalyst regeneration"

</quotes>

<English version answer>
7. Yes, the article evaluates a two-zone fluidized bed reactor combined with a Pd membrane for propane dehydrogenation. This is the first time this reactor configuration has been tested. The TZFBR helps counteract catalyst deactivation while the Pd membrane removes hydrogen to increase conversion. However, the increased coking with this catalyst outweighs the benefits of the membrane.

7. 是的,文章评估了两区流化床反应器与钯膜的组合用于丙烷脱氢。这是第一次测试这种反应器配置。TZFBR 有助于抵消催化剂失活,而钯膜可去除氢气以增加转化率。然而,这种催化剂的增强焦化超过了膜的好处。

[3] "The hydrogen selective membrane is a Pd membrane which is deposited directly on a porous alumina hollow fibre with a unique asymmetric structure."

[4] "It consists of two cylindrical regions, the lower one with an internal diameter of 1.8 cm and the upper one 2.8 cm i.d."

[5] "In this way two zones with different atmosphere are created in the bed: a reducing zone, in the upper part, where the desired reaction takes place and coke is formed on the catalyst surface and an oxidizing environment in the lower part, where the catalyst is regenerated by coke combustion."

7. Yes, the article evaluates a two-zone fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR) with a palladium membrane for propane dehydrogenation. It combines the TZFBR design with in situ catalyst regeneration in the lower zone and a Pd membrane that removes hydrogen to increase conversion in the upper reaction zone. Details on the reactor design, membrane module, and catalyst are provided. The results show that the membrane enhances reaction rates but also increases coking rates, indicating a catalyst with lower coking tendency is needed to fully benefit from this reactor configuration.
