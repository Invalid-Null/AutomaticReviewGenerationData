[1] "The aim of this research was to explore the possibilities offered by this combination. The chosen reaction (propane dehydrogenation, C3H8 -> C3H6 + H2) has been previously studied in membrane reactors [12] and TZFBR [14]."

[2] "When the Pd membrane is inserted in the TZFBR, the removal of hydrogen from the reaction media can cause two important changes: (a) the reaction rate is increased, which favours larger propane conversion, being at least in theory possible to surpass the maximum conversion achievable in a conventional reactor (given by the thermodynamic equilibrium); (b) the lower the hydrogen partial pressure, the faster the coke formation, as has been previously observed in fixed bed membrane reactors [11], [12]."  

[3] "The experimental results are shown in Fig. 8. Propane conversion and selectivity to propene vs. percentage of oxygen in the feed are plotted for several operating conditions."

7. Yes, the article evaluates different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation, specifically comparing TZFBR and membrane reactors. It finds that combining a Pd membrane with a TZFBR can increase reaction rate and conversion by removing hydrogen, but also increases coke formation. Experimental data on propane conversion and selectivity using a combined TZFBR-membrane reactor are provided.

7. 是的,本文评估了不同类型的丙烷脱氢反应器,具体来说是比较了TZFBR和膜反应器。它发现将Pd膜与TZFBR结合可以通过除去氢气来增加反应速率和转化率,但也会增加焦炭形成。提供了使用TZFBR-膜复合反应器的丙烷转化率和选择性的实验数据。
