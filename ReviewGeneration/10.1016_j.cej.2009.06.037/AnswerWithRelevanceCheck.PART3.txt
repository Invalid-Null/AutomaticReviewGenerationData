[1] "The Two-Zone Fluidized Bed Reactor (TZFBR) is a system designed to counteract the catalyst deactivation." 

[2] "Fluid bed reactors have been employed combined with membranes in several works, but never in a situation where the bottom of the reactor was employed for catalyst regeneration"   

[3] "In this article we describe for the first time a combination of a TZFBR with a membrane reactor for the catalytic dehydrogenation of an alkane (propane) using a Pd hollow fibre membrane."  

[4] "The hydrogen selective membrane is a Pd membrane which is deposited directly on a porous alumina hollow fibre"  

[5] "The reactor was loaded with 15 g of a commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalyst"    

[6] "In this way two zones with different atmosphere are created in the bed: a reducing zone, in the upper part, where the desired reaction takes place and coke is formed on the catalyst surface and an oxidizing environment in the lower part, where the catalyst is regenerated by coke combustion."  

[7] "The experimental results are shown in Fig. 8. Propane conversion and selectivity to propene vs. percentage of oxygen in the feed are plotted for several operating conditions."   

[8] "The aim of this research was to explore the possibilities offered by this combination. The chosen reaction (propane dehydrogenation, C3H8 -> C3H6 + H2) has been previously studied in membrane reactors [12] and TZFBR [14]."   

[9] "The data named as low vacuum + membrane correspond to a vacuum around 300 mbar (30 kPa) inside the membrane, and those named high vacuum + membrane are experiments where the pressure at the mouth of the membrane was 7 mbar (0.7 kPa)."

<English>
Yes, the articles evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation, specifically combining two-zone fluidized bed reactors (TZFBR) with Pd membrane reactors. For the first time, a TZFBR design is combined with a Pd membrane to increase conversion by removing hydrogen while also regenerating the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst in situ. Experimental data on propane conversion and selectivity are provided for reactors with and without the membrane under different conditions. The results show the membrane increases the reaction rate but also coke formation, indicating a catalyst with lower coking tendency may better utilize this reactor configuration.

是的,这些文章评价了不同类型的反应器用于丙烷脱氢,特别是将两区流化床反应器与钯膜反应器组合。首次将 TZFBR 设计与钯膜组合,通过去除氢气增加转化率的同时原位再生 PtSn/Al2O3 催化剂。提供了有无膜在不同条件下的反应器的丙烷转化率和选择性的数据。结果显示膜增强了反应速率但也增加了结焦,这表明结焦倾向更低的催化剂可能会更好地利用这种反应器配置。
