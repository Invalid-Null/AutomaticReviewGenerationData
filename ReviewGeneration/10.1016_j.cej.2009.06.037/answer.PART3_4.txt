[1] "In this article we describe for the first time a combination of a TZFBR with a membrane reactor for the catalytic dehydrogenation of an alkane (propane) using a Pd hollow fibre membrane."

[2] "The reactor was loaded with 15 g of a commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (0.2 wt.% Pt, 0.2 wt.% Sn, 0.15 wt.% K, 150 m2/g BET surface area), crushed and sieved to a particle size between 100 and 200 μm."

[3] "The hydrogen selective membrane is a Pd membrane which is deposited directly on a porous alumina hollow fibre with a unique asymmetric structure."

[4] "It consists of two cylindrical regions, the lower one with an internal diameter of 1.8 cm and the upper one 2.8 cm i.d."

[5] "In this way two zones with different atmosphere are created in the bed: a reducing zone, in the upper part, where the desired reaction takes place and coke is formed on the catalyst surface and an oxidizing environment in the lower part, where the catalyst is regenerated by coke combustion."

7. Yes, the article evaluates a two-zone fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR) with a palladium membrane for propane dehydrogenation. It combines the TZFBR design with in situ catalyst regeneration in the lower zone and a Pd membrane that removes hydrogen to increase conversion in the upper reaction zone. Details on the reactor design, membrane module, and catalyst are provided. The results show that the membrane enhances reaction rates but also increases coking rates, indicating a catalyst with lower coking tendency is needed to fully benefit from this reactor configuration.

7. 是的,本文评价了一个两区流化床反应器(TZFBR)与钯膜用于丙烷脱氢。它结合了TZFBR设计与下区原位催化剂再生以及一个钯膜移除氢以提高上区反应区的转化率。关于反应器设计、膜模块和催化剂的细节都有提供。结果显示膜增强了反应速率但也增加了结焦速率,这表明需要一个结焦倾向更低的催化剂才能从这个反应器配置中获得全部利益。
