The silica membranes have been tested in single component permeation studies of H2 and propane. In the beginning of the instationary single component experiment, the shell side of the tube was evacuated and the flux of the test gases from the tube to the shell side was recorded by the pressure increase with time in the shell side of the membrane.

Propane was catalytically dehydrogenated on a commercial Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst at a temperature of 535C. The pelletized catalyst was contained on the tube side of the membrane. Pure propane was used as feed and nitrogen as sweep gas for the H2 removal on the shell side of the membrane.

Fig. 6 shows that the propene yield can be increased if the hydrogen is continuously removed by a membrane. However, the following observations have been made:

<English version answer>
Answer: The article evaluates different reactor types including membrane reactors for propane dehydrogenation. Specifically, it tests a silica membrane reactor for propane dehydrogenation at 535°C using a Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst and compares the yield to a fixed bed reactor. The membrane reactor shows an increased propylene yield by continuously removing hydrogen to shift the reaction equilibrium. However, catalyst deactivation is accelerated, limiting the benefit of the membrane reactor over longer reaction times.

答:这篇文章评估了不同类型的反应器,包括用于丙烷脱氢的膜反应器。具体而言,它在535°C下使用Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂测试了一个丙烷脱氢的二氧化硅膜反应器,并与固定床反应器的产率进行了比较。通过连续除去氢气来移动反应平衡,膜反应器显示出丙烯产率的增加。然而,催化剂的失活加速了,这限制了与较长反应时间的固定床反应器相比,膜反应器的优势。
