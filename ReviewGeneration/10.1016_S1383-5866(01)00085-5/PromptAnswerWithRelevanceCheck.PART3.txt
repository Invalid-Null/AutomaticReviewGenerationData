<quotes>
The silica membranes have been tested in single component permeation studies of H2 and propane. In the beginning of the instationary single component experiment, the shell side of the tube was evacuated and the flux of the test gases from the tube to the shell side was recorded by the pressure increase with time in the shell side of the membrane.

Propane was catalytically dehydrogenated on a commercial Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst at a temperature of 535C. The pelletized catalyst was contained on the tube side of the membrane. Pure propane was used as feed and nitrogen as sweep gas for the H2 removal on the shell side of the membrane.

Fig. 6 shows that the propene yield can be increased if the hydrogen is continuously removed by a membrane. However, the following observations have been made:

<English version answer>
Answer: The article evaluates different reactor types including membrane reactors for propane dehydrogenation. Specifically, it tests a silica membrane reactor for propane dehydrogenation at 535°C using a Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst and compares the yield to a fixed bed reactor. The membrane reactor shows an increased propylene yield by continuously removing hydrogen to shift the reaction equilibrium. However, catalyst deactivation is accelerated, limiting the benefit of the membrane reactor over longer reaction times.

Commercial alumina ceramic tubes of asymmetric cross section were used as supports for the deposition of SiO2 layers by the solgel technique. The SiO2 gel layer has been built up on the γ-alumina ultrafiltration (UF)-layer of the support by dip-coating with a SiO2-polymer sol.

In this paper we report the preparation of H2-selective SiO2 membranes with improved fluxes and stability in the absence at 535C which is a typical temperature for the catalytic propane dehydrogenation.

The propene yield in the membrane reactor can be higher than in a conventional fixed-bed reactor if the hydrogen is removed by a H2-selective membrane.

As shown in Fig. 6, the propene yield can be increased if the hydrogen is continuously removed by a membrane. However, the following observations have been made:
•
The yield in the membrane reactor is only higher than in the reference experiment if a membrane with a permselectivity H2: propane >25 and a propane flux <0.5 m3(STP)/mhbar is used.
</quotes>

<English version answer>

7. Yes, the article evaluates a membrane reactor for propane dehydrogenation and compares it to a conventional fixed bed reactor. It finds that the membrane reactor can give higher propene yields, but catalyst deactivation is faster. The membrane needs to have sufficient hydrogen permselectivity and low propane flux to be effective. After several catalyst regenerations, the membrane reactor performance becomes similar to the fixed bed.

7. 是的,该文评价了用于丙烷脱氢的膜反应器,并与传统的固定床反应器进行了比较。它发现膜反应器可以给出更高的丙烯收率,但催化剂失活更快。膜需要有足够的氢透过选择性和低的丙烷通量才能有效。在几次催化剂再生后,膜反应器的性能变得与固定床相似。
