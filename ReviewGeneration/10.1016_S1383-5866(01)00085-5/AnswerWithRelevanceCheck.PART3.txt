           Commercial alumina ceramic tubes of asymmetric cross section were used as supports for the deposition of SiO2 layers by the solgel technique. The SiO2 gel layer has been built up on the γ-alumina ultrafiltration (UF)-layer of the support by dip-coating with a SiO2-polymer sol.
       
           In this paper we report the preparation of H2-selective SiO2 membranes with improved fluxes and stability in the absence at 535C which is a typical temperature for the catalytic propane dehydrogenation.
       
           The propene yield in the membrane reactor can be higher than in a conventional fixed-bed reactor if the hydrogen is removed by a H2-selective membrane.

           As shown in Fig. 6, the propene yield can be increased if the hydrogen is continuously removed by a membrane. However, the following observations have been made: 
           • The yield in the membrane reactor is only higher than in the reference experiment if a membrane with a permselectivity H2: propane >25 and a propane flux <0.5 m3(STP)/mhbar is used.

           Answer: Yes, the article evaluates membrane reactors for propane dehydrogenation using silica membranes. It reports on preparation of silica membranes optimized for hydrogen flux and selectivity to improve propene yields. Results show the membrane reactor gives higher yields than fixed bed, but is limited by faster catalyst deactivation.
