To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key ideas and details between the answer file contents and correct answers for each question. Where the answers expressed the same key concepts, I assigned a consistency ratio of 100%. Where there were differences in the main ideas or missing details, I reduced the ratio accordingly.

For question 7 specifically, answer.PART3_0.txt covered some relevant ideas but lacked specifics on membrane reactor testing and comparison to fixed bed reactors. answer.PART3_1.txt provided more details but did not highlight the issue of faster catalyst deactivation. answer.PART3_2.txt and answer.PART3_4.txt were fully consistent with the correct answer. answer.PART3_3.txt also lacked the comparison to other reactor types.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
