         [1] "This strategy leads to remarkably enhanced thermal stability of PtSn sites in zeolites during propane dehydrogenation reaction conditions. After steam treatment at 600 °C, the PtSn sites encapsulated in the sinusoidal channels remain stable while the PtSn sites located on the external surface undergo severe sintering. This is probably the most direct and convincing proof that encapsulation of active sites can effectively stabilize them during reaction."

         23. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. Specifically, it shows encapsulating PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of ZSM-5 leads to improved thermal stability compared to PtSn located on the external surface, which undergoes severe sintering after steam treatment. Encapsulation in the channels prevents sintering.

         23. 是的,该文评估了在分子筛载体中封装金属以提高丙烷脱氢催化剂稳定性。具体而言,它显示了将PtSn簇封装在ZSM-5的正弦波状通道中可以提高与外表面PtSn相比的热稳定性,外表面PtSn在蒸汽处理后会严重烧结。通道中的封装可防止烧结。

         [1] "Besides X-ray absorption spectroscopy (specifically, extended X-ray adsorption fine structure, which is a bulk characterization method providing average information on, for example, the Pt nanoparticle size), they also use a combination of two local chemical imaging methods. These are high-resolution, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR HAADF-STEM) and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC)."
         [2] "In the HR HAADF-STEM images (Fig. 2a,c), sub-nanometric Pt clusters are observed. In the corresponding iDPC images (Fig. 2b,d), the pore structures and geometries of zeolite MFI are revealed. By combining the images obtained by these two imaging modes, it is possible to identify the precise locations of the Pt nanoparticles in zeolite MFI, which correspond to the sinusoidal channels."
