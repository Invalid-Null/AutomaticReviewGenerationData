[1] "Besides X-ray absorption spectroscopy (specifically, extended X-ray adsorption fine structure, which is a bulk characterization method providing average information on, for example, the Pt nanoparticle size), they also use a combination of two local chemical imaging methods. These are high-resolution, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR HAADF-STEM) and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC)."

[2] "In the HR HAADF-STEM images (Fig. 2a,c), sub-nanometric Pt clusters are observed. In the corresponding iDPC images (Fig. 2b,d), the pore structures and geometries of zeolite MFI are revealed.
