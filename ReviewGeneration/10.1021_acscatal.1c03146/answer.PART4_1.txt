<quotes>
[1] "This hurdle can be circumvented by means of anomalous SAXS (ASAXS), making use of tuned X-ray energies."
[2] "Some issues are not faced by the Ga-incorporated samples (Pt/MgGaAlO, 10Al2O3/Pt/MgGaAlO, and 40Al2O3/Pt/MgGaAlO). This is primarily because the alloying process for such a sample does not rely on the surface location of the NPs. Instead, the Ga located in the support close to the WI Pt will get extracted from the support by hydrogen spillover and form a PtGa alloy. Hence, the presence of a coating should not affect the process of alloy formation."
