         [1] "One of the most popular methods employed is the addition of a promoter such as Sn, (12,15) Ga, (1618) In, (19) Cu, (20) etc." 
 
         [2] "Pt (3 wt %) was deposited onto both supports, MgAl2O4 and MgGaAlO, by incipient wetness impregnation. For the MgAl2O4 support, Ga was equally deposited by impregnation with a loading chosen such that the atomic ratio between Pt and Ga is 3:1."
 
         [3] "Several questions need to be answered about the workability of such a coating for bimetallic NPs. First is to confirm whether the active sites remain accessible to the reactants. Second would be to determine if there are any interactions between the catalyst and the coating layer. A third aspect is if and how the activity toward propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is altered. Fourth is to see the effect of applying such a coating on the alloy formation and finally to verify if this coating indeed prevents coke formation and sintering of the catalyst."

         Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts with Ga as a promoter for propane dehydrogenation. It prepares Pt-Ga alloy catalysts by wet impregnation with an atomic ratio of Pt:Ga = 3:1 and investigates the effect of an Al2O3 coating on the alloy formation and catalytic activity. It finds the coating hinders alloy formation for wet impregnated samples but not for Ga incorporated samples. The coated samples show lower catalytic activity but also lower coke formation.

         是的,该文评价了将Ga作为助剂的Pt合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它通过湿浸渍制备Pt-Ga合金催化剂,Pt:Ga的原子比为3:1,并研究Al2O3涂层对合金形成和催化活性的影响。��发现涂层会抑制湿浸渍样本的合金形成,但对Ga�入的样本没有影响。涂层样本显示较低的催化活性,但也具有较低的焦炭形成。
