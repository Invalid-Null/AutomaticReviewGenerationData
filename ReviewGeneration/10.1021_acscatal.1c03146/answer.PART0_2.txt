<English version answer>

1. The article states that demand for propylene is increasing but supply is limited, so there is growing interest in producing propylene directly via propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

2. According to the article, carbon buildup (coke) on catalysts during propane dehydrogenation can be removed by burning it off with oxygen in a regeneration step.  

3. The article does not introduce different catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation.

4. The article notes that propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic, equilibrium-limited reaction requiring high temperatures to achieve high propylene yields.

5. The article does not describe any DFT calculations applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics. 

7. The article does not identify any structure-activity relationships correlating catalyst properties to propane dehydrogenation performance.
