<English version answer>
Answer: No, the article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It focuses on applying an alumina coating by atomic layer deposition on platinum-gallium alloy nanoparticles supported on magnesium aluminate spinel and hydrotalcite-like supports.

[1] "Pt (3 wt %) was deposited onto both supports, MgAl2O4 and MgGaAlO, by incipient wetness impregnation."

[2] "Ga-incorporated MgGaAlO hydrotalcite (HT) material with 1 wt % Ga was prepared according to the procedure described in the work by Sun et al., (18) by coprecipitation from an aqueous solution of Mg (Sigma-Aldrich, 98102), Al (Sigma-Aldrich, 98.5), and Ga (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) nitrates mixed with a 1.1 mol/L NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich, > 98%) solution."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses wet impregnation to deposit Pt onto MgAl2O4 and MgGaAlO supports [Quote 1]. It also describes coprecipitation to incorporate Ga into a hydrotalcite-like MgGaAlO support [Quote 2]. These methods are used to optimize dispersion of the Pt and Pt-Ga active phases.

[1] "In situ experiments were performed during temperature-programmed reduction and oxidation to assess the effect on alloy and coating, as well as during five H2/O2 redox cycles to mimic sintering."

[2] "Isothermal redox cycles with O2/H2 were performed at 923 K to mimic reaction/regeneration cycle steps."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It performs in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) during temperature programmed reduction and oxidation, as well as during isothermal H2/O2 redox cycles at 923 K to mimic reaction/regeneration conditions [Quotes 1-2]. This provides insights into changes in the Pt-Ga alloy and alumina coating under working conditions.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文采用了原位表征技术来研究工作中的丙烷脱氢催化剂。文中在程序升温还原和氧化过程中,以及在923 K下进行等温H2/O2反复氧化还原循环过程中,同步进行X射线吸收光谱(XAS)和小角X射线散射(SAXS)的原位表征,以模拟反应/再生条件[引用1-2]。这提供了对Pt-Ga合金和氧化铝涂层在工作条件下变化的见解。

[1] "Synchrotron-based in situ XAS and SAXS experiments were conducted at the DUBBLE beamline (44) of the ESRF synchrotron (6GeV, current 160200 mA, Grenoble, France). Measurements were performed in transmission mode at the Pt-LIII edge (11564 eV), and in parallel ASAXS measurements were collected by means of a Pilatus detector." 

[2] "XAS data further indicated that for the coated WI samples the extent of alloying between Pt and Ga was limited due to obstruction by the applied alumina coating of free mobility of the surface NPs required to form an alloy."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It performs in-situ XAS at the Pt L-III edge at a synchrotron source to track changes in the Pt oxidation state during temperature programmed reduction, oxidation, and redox cycling [Quote 1]. This provided insights such as the alumina coating limiting Pt-Ga alloy formation in coated wet impregnated catalysts [Quote 2].
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文采用了基于X射线的技术来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。文中在同步辐射源进行Pt L-III边际的原位XAS表征,追踪程序升温还原、氧化和氧化-还原循环过程中的Pt氧化态变化[引用1]。这给出了诸如氧化铝涂层限制了湿浸渍法制备的涂层催化剂中Pt-Ga合金形成等信息[引用2]。
