[1] "A lot of research has gone into eliminating or suppressing these negative effects. One of the most popular methods employed is the addition of a promoter such as Sn, (12,15) Ga, (1618) In, (19) Cu, (20) etc."

[2] "Another approach to overcome the thermodynamic and equilibrium limitations is by the addition of an oxidant such as oxygen, (21) carbon dioxide, (7,11,22) or nitrous oxide (23) to the feed, which would then lead to an oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH)." 

[3] "A third option, which has been recently investigated for this reaction for a monometallic Pt catalyst, (24,25) is the possibility of adding a coating on the catalysts, which can stabilize the nanoparticles against sintering. This method has also been successfully applied for other reactions such as SiO2-coated Au/TiO2 catalysts for CO oxidation, (26) alumina-coated Pd catalysts for hydrogenation of 1,3 butadiene, (27) atomic layer deposition (ALD)-based Al2O3-coated Pd-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, (28) MgO-coated Ni catalysts for reforming of methane, (29) and others. (30,31) The results hold promise and indicate it is an option that can be investigated for PDH."

[4] "In this work, two of the above-mentioned approaches are combined for enhanced PDH performance: promoter and coating. A Pt-based catalyst is used with a Ga promoter."

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts with Ga as a promoter for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on PtGa/MgAl2O4 and Pt/MgGaAlO catalysts, showing improved propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to monometallic Pt. The Ga promoter helps with propylene desorption from the surface. No insights into electronic or geometric effects are provided.

2. 是的,该文评价了将Ga作为助剂的Pt合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供了PtGa/MgAl2O4和Pt/MgGaAlO催化剂的数据,显示与单金属Pt相比,丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性都有提高。Ga助剂有助于丙烯从表面解吸。没有提供对电子效应或几何效应的洞察。
