<quotes>
[1] "One of the most popular methods employed is the addition of a promoter such as Sn, (12,15) Ga, (1618) In, (19) Cu, (20) etc."

[2] "Addition of such a promoter leads to the formation of nanoalloys that are typically more stable as far as sintering is concerned and suppress coke formation."

[3] "In this work, two of the above-mentioned approaches are combined for enhanced PDH performance: promoter and coating. A Pt-based catalyst is used with a Ga promoter." 

[4] "As expected, the addition of Ga as promoter to Pt in the WI catalyst (Figure 7) leads to an improvement in conversion (17) (pink to black squares)."

[5] "The activity test results for the incorporated samples reflected the above findings. The coating did not prevent access of reactant molecules to the catalyst surface."

[6] "Although this work uses Ga as a promoter, these findings can be extrapolated for other promoters such as Sn, In, etc., as the process of alloy formation would remain the same."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts with Ga as a promoter for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Ga addition improves propane conversion and forms more stable nanoalloys compared to monometallic Pt. It also suggests the findings with Ga promotion could apply to other promoters like Sn and In.

<quotes>

[1] "A lot of research has gone into eliminating or suppressing these negative effects. One of the most popular methods employed is the addition of a promoter such as Sn, (12,15) Ga, (1618) In, (19) Cu, (20) etc."

[2] "Another approach to overcome the thermodynamic and equilibrium limitations is by the addition of an oxidant such as oxygen, (21) carbon dioxide, (7,11,22) or nitrous oxide (23) to the feed, which would then lead to an oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH)." 

[3] "A third option, which has been recently investigated for this reaction for a monometallic Pt catalyst, (24,25) is the possibility of adding a coating on the catalysts, which can stabilize the nanoparticles against sintering. This method has also been successfully applied for other reactions such as SiO2-coated Au/TiO2 catalysts for CO oxidation, (26) alumina-coated Pd catalysts for hydrogenation of 1,3 butadiene, (27) atomic layer deposition (ALD)-based Al2O3-coated Pd-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, (28) MgO-coated Ni catalysts for reforming of methane, (29) and others. (30,31) The results hold promise and indicate it is an option that can be investigated for PDH."

[4] "In this work, two of the above-mentioned approaches are combined for enhanced PDH performance: promoter and coating. A Pt-based catalyst is used with a Ga promoter."

[1] "A lot of research has gone into eliminating or suppressing these negative effects. One of the most popular methods employed is the addition of a promoter such as Sn, (12,15) Ga, (1618) In, (19) Cu, (20) etc."

[2] "Pt (3 wt %) was deposited onto both supports, MgAl2O4 and MgGaAlO, by incipient wetness impregnation. For the MgAl2O4 support, Ga was equally deposited by impregnation with a loading chosen such that the atomic ratio between Pt and Ga is 3:1."

[3] "Several questions need to be answered about the workability of such a coating for bimetallic NPs. First is to confirm whether the active sites remain accessible to the reactants. Second would be to determine if there are any interactions between the catalyst and the coating layer. A third aspect is if and how the activity toward propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is altered. Fourth is to see the effect of applying such a coating on the alloy formation and finally to verify if this coating indeed prevents coke formation and sintering of the catalyst."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts with Ga as a promoter for propane dehydrogenation. It prepares Pt-Ga alloy catalysts by wet impregnation with an atomic ratio of Pt:Ga = 3:1 and investigates the effect of an Al2O3 coating on the alloy formation and catalytic activity. It finds the coating hinders alloy formation for wet impregnated samples but not for Ga incorporated samples. The coated samples show lower catalytic activity but also lower coke formation.

2. 是的,该文献评估了将Ga作为助剂的Pt合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它通过湿浸渍制备Pt-Ga合金催化剂,Pt:Ga的原子比为3:1,并研究Al2O3涂层对合金形成和催化活性的影响。它发现涂层会抑制湿浸渍样本的合金形成,但对Ga掺入的样本没有影响。涂层样本显示较低的催化活性,但也具有较低的焦炭形成。
