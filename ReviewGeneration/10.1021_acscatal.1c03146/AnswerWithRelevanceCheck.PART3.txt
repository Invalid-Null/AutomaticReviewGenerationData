         [1] "Synchrotron-based in situ XAS and SAXS experiments were conducted at the DUBBLE beamline (44) of the ESRF synchrotron (6GeV, current 160200 mA, Grenoble, France). Measurements were performed in transmission mode at the Pt-LIII edge (11564 eV), and in parallel ASAXS measurements were collected by means of a Pilatus detector."
         [2] "XAS data further indicated that for the coated WI samples the extent of alloying between Pt and Ga was limited due to obstruction by the applied alumina coating of free mobility of the surface NPs required to form an alloy."
