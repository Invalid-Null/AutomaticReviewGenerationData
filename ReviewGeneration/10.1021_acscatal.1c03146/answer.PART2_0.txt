<quotes>
[1] "One of the most popular methods employed is the addition of a promoter such as Sn, (12,15) Ga, (1618) In, (19) Cu, (20) etc."

[2] "Addition of such a promoter leads to the formation of nanoalloys that are typically more stable as far as sintering is concerned and suppress coke formation."

[3] "In this work, two of the above-mentioned approaches are combined for enhanced PDH performance: promoter and coating. A Pt-based catalyst is used with a Ga promoter." 

[4] "As expected, the addition of Ga as promoter to Pt in the WI catalyst (Figure 7) leads to an improvement in conversion (17) (pink to black squares)."

[5] "The activity test results for the incorporated samples reflected the above findings. The coating did not prevent access of reactant molecules to the catalyst surface."

[6] "Although this work uses Ga as a promoter, these findings can be extrapolated for other promoters such as Sn, In, etc., as the process of alloy formation would remain the same."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts with Ga as a promoter for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Ga addition improves propane conversion and forms more stable nanoalloys compared to monometallic Pt. It also suggests the findings with Ga promotion could apply to other promoters like Sn and In.

回答:是的,文章评估了以Ga作为助剂的 Pt合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显示Ga的添加可以提高丙烷的转化率,并且与单金属Pt相比可以形成更稳定的纳米合金。它还暗示Ga助剂的发现同样适用于其他助剂,如Sn和In。
