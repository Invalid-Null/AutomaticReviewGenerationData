<quotes>
[1] "Combining the knowledge from SAXS with the XAS data allowed one to conclude that the alumina coating was restricting the free mobility of the surface NPs for the WI samples (section 3.4.1)."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article does highlight needs for improved in-situ characterization tools to better understand propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it demonstrates the value of combining SAXS and XAS to study the effect of an alumina coating on restricting nanoparticle mobility for PtGa catalysts prepared by wet impregnation. This highlights the need for further development of operando techniques.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
答:本文确实突出了需要改进原位表征工具以便更好地理解丙烷脱氢催化剂的需求。具体而言,文中证明了结合SAXS和XAS来研究氧化铝涂层对湿浸渍制备的PtGa催化剂的纳米粒子运动性的限制作用的价值。这凸显了进一步发展原位技术的需求。

<quotes>
[1] "This hurdle can be circumvented by means of anomalous SAXS (ASAXS), making use of tuned X-ray energies."
[2] "Some issues are not faced by the Ga-incorporated samples (Pt/MgGaAlO, 10Al2O3/Pt/MgGaAlO, and 40Al2O3/Pt/MgGaAlO). This is primarily because the alloying process for such a sample does not rely on the surface location of the NPs. Instead, the Ga located in the support close to the WI Pt will get extracted from the support by hydrogen spillover and form a PtGa alloy. Hence, the presence of a coating should not affect the process of alloy formation."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
6. The article highlights the need for improved in situ characterization tools like anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering (ASAXS) to better understand propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows how ASAXS can help circumvent issues with characterizing supported nanoparticle catalysts.
