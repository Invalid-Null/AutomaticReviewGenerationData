<quotes>
[1] "Combining the knowledge from SAXS with the XAS data allowed one to conclude that the alumina coating was restricting the free mobility of the surface NPs for the WI samples (section 3.4.1)."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article does highlight needs for improved in-situ characterization tools to better understand propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it demonstrates the value of combining SAXS and XAS to study the effect of an alumina coating on restricting nanoparticle mobility for PtGa catalysts prepared by wet impregnation. This highlights the need for further development of operando techniques.
