[1] "Pt (3 wt %) was deposited onto both supports, MgAl2O4 and MgGaAlO, by incipient wetness impregnation."
[2] "Ga-incorporated MgGaAlO hydrotalcite (HT) material with 1 wt % Ga was prepared according to the procedure described in the work by Sun et al., (18) by coprecipitation from an aqueous solution of Mg (Sigma-Aldrich, 98102), Al (Sigma-Aldrich, 98.5), and Ga (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) nitrates mixed with a 1.1 mol/L NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich, > 98%) solution."

Answer: The article investigates two catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion: incipient wetness impregnation and coprecipitation. Platinum was deposited on MgAl2O4 and MgGaAlO supports by incipient wetness impregnation. A Ga-incorporated hydrotalcite support was prepared by coprecipitation of Mg, Al, and Ga nitrate solutions.

Answer: The article utilizes in-situ anomalous small angle X-ray scattering (ASAXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Experiments were conducted at the DUBBLE beamline of the ESRF synchrotron using simultaneous ASAXS and XAS measurements in transmission mode at the Pt LIII edge to investigate the effect of alumina coating on PtGa alloy formation.

<English version answer>
Answer: The article uses synchrotron-based in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Pt LIII edge to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Experiments were conducted at the DUBBLE beamline on various Pt and PtGa catalyst samples supported on MgGaAlO and MgAl2O4.
