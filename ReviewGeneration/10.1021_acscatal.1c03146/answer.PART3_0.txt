[1] "The promoter can be added on the support surface next to the active Pt, e.g., by wet impregnation." 
[2] "Ga-incorporated MgGaAlO hydrotalcite (HT) material with 1 wt % Ga was prepared according to the procedure described in the work by Sun et al., (18) by coprecipitation from an aqueous solution of Mg (Sigma-Aldrich, 98102), Al (Sigma-Aldrich, 98.5), and Ga (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) nitrates mixed with a 1.1 mol/L NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich, > 98%) solution."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It compares wet impregnation of Pt and Ga onto MgAl2O4 versus incorporating Ga into the MgGaAlO hydrotalcite support and then impregnating Pt. Incorporating Ga into the support is found to improve dispersion and catalytic performance.
