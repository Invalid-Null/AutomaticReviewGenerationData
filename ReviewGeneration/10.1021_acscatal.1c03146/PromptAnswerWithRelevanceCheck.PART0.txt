<English version answer>

1. The article states that demand for propylene is increasing but supply is limited, so there is growing interest in producing propylene directly via propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

2. According to the article, carbon buildup (coke) on catalysts during propane dehydrogenation can be removed by burning it off with oxygen in a regeneration step.  

3. The article does not introduce different catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation.

4. The article notes that propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic, equilibrium-limited reaction requiring high temperatures to achieve high propylene yields.

5. The article does not describe any DFT calculations applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics. 

7. The article does not identify any structure-activity relationships correlating catalyst properties to propane dehydrogenation performance.

[1] "The process is endothermic and equilibrium-limited, so that relatively high temperatures are required for high yields of propylene. (7,11)"
[2] "Typically, elimination of this coke from the catalyst surface is achieved by means of a regeneration step, where oxygen is employed to burn off this carbon."

Answer: The article briefly discusses the thermodynamic constraints of propane dehydrogenation being an endothermic, equilibrium-limited reaction that requires high temperatures for high propylene yields. It also mentions that coke formation leads to the need for regeneration of catalysts by burning off carbon with oxygen. However, no quantitative details of thermodynamics or kinetics are provided.
