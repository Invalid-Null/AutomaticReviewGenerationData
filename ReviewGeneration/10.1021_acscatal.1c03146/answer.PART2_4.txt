<quotes>
[1] "One of the most popular methods employed is the addition of a promoter such as Sn, (12,15) Ga, (1618) In, (19) Cu, (20) etc."  

[2] "Addition of such a promoter leads to the formation of nanoalloys that are typically more stable as far as sintering is concerned and suppress coke formation."

[3] "They are also more selective toward the formation of the desired product propylene, which leads to higher yields."

[4] "The promoter can be added on the support surface next to the active Pt, e.g., by wet impregnation." 

[5] "Alternatively, a different synthesis method has been investigated, where the promoter is incorporated into the support (hydrotalcite) framework (17,19) onto which Pt is wet-impregnated."

2. Yes, the article evaluates PtGa catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on the performance of PtGa vs Pt catalysts, showing PtGa has higher activity and selectivity. It also discusses insights into how Ga enhances stability by forming alloys with Pt and suppressing coke formation. Different methods of preparing PtGa are explored, like wet impregnation of Ga onto the support or incorporating Ga into the support framework before adding Pt.
