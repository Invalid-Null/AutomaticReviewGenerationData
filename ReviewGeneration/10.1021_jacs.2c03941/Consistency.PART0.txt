 Here is the JSON structure comparing the consistency of the answer files with the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%", 
    "answer1.txt": "0%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "0%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "0%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%", 
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "50%"
  },
  "3": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "0%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "0%"  
  },
  "4": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "0%", 
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "5": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "6": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "7": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%",    
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  }
}
```

I analyzed each answer file and compared it to the correct answer for each question. I looked for overlap in content and assigned a consistency percentage based on how much of the key information from the correct answer was contained in the answer file. Where there was no overlap, I assigned 0%, and where there was full overlap I assigned 100%. The JSON structure organizes this analysis question-by-question for each answer file.
