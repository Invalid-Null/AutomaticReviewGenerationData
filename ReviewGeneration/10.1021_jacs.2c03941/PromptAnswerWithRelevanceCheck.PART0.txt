[1] The dehydrogenation of light alkanes is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited, resulting in low conversion and selectivity in the absence of catalysts.  
[2] Ga-CHA samples with several Ga/Al ratios (0–1.7) and Si/Al ratios (5, 12, and 25) have been prepared to investigate Ga speciation and the corresponding impact on PDH rates.
[3] Apparent activation energies (Eapp) for the PDH reaction on the reduced catalyst are estimated using an Arrhenius plot in the temperature range of 530–570 °C. On H-CHA(x), the (Eapp) values of the C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking reactions were 180-200 kJ/mol (Table 2) and 159-174 kJ/mol, respectively.

<English version answer>
Answer: The article discusses some thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. Specifically, it states that propane dehydrogenation is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited, resulting in low conversion and selectivity without catalysts. It also prepares Ga-CHA catalysts with varying Ga/Al and Si/Al ratios to investigate their impact on propane dehydrogenation rates. Furthermore, it estimates apparent activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and cracking reactions on H-CHA and Ga-CHA catalysts, finding values of 180-200 kJ/mol for dehydrogenation and 159-174 kJ/mol for cracking on H-CHA.
