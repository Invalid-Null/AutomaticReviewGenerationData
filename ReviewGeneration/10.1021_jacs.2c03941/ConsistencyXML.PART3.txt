To generate this, I parsed the quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers from each file. I compared them to the correct answers using semantic similarity techniques to estimate a consistency percentage. Questions without quotes were scored 0% consistent by default. The percentage was rounded to the nearest 25% increment for simplicity.

I output this comparison in the requested XML format, with a <question> element for each question number, containing <answer> elements with the consistency percentage for each file. Let me know if you have any other questions!
