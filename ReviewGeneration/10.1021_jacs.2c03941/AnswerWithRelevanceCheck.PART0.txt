           [1] The dehydrogenation of light alkanes is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited, resulting in low conversion and selectivity in the absence of catalysts. The application of suitable catalysts can facilitate the reaction by lowering the activation barriers.
           [2] Ga2O3 particles were observed on Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) on the zeolite surface (Figure S3), due to the relatively large amount of Ga loading, in agreement with the observation of mesopores associated with Ga2O3 on the N2 adsorption isotherms of Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) (Figure S5c).

           The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy compared to the uncatalyzed thermal process. It describes how catalysts like CrOx/Al2O3, supported Pt-Sn, and Ga2O3 provide catalytic activity through mechanisms such as metal-carbon bond formation and acid-base reactions.

           [3] Apparent activation energies (Eapp) for the PDH reaction on the reduced catalyst are estimated using an Arrhenius plot in the temperature range of 530–570 °C. On H-CHA(x), the (Eapp) values of the C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking reactions were 180-200 kJ/mol (Table 2) and 159-174 kJ/mol, respectively.
