Ga+-Chabazite Zeolite: A Highly Selective Catalyst for Nonoxidative Propane Dehydrogenation
Abstract
Ga-chabazite zeolites (Ga-CHA) have been found to efficiently catalyze propane dehydrogenation with high propylene selectivity (96%). In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and pulse titrations are employed to determine that upon reduction, surface Ga2O3 is reduced and diffuses into the zeolite pores, displacing the Brnsted acid sites and forming extra-framework Ga+ sites. This isolated Ga+ site reacts reversibly with H2 to form GaHx (2034 cm1) with an enthalpy of formation of 51.2 kJ·mol1, a result supported by density functional theory calculations. The initial C3H8 dehydrogenation rates decrease rapidly (40%) during the first 100 min and then decline slowly afterward, while the C3H6 selectivity is stable at 96%. The reduction in the reaction rate is correlated with the formation of polycyclic aromatics inside the zeolite (using UVvis spectroscopy) indicating that the accumulation of polycyclic aromatics is the main cause of the deactivation. The carbon species formed can be easily oxidized at 600 C with complete recovery of the PDH catalytic properties. The correlations between GaHx vs Ga/Al ratio and PDH rates vs Ga/Al ratio show that extra-framework Ga+ is the active center catalyzing propane dehydrogenation. The higher reaction rate on Ga+ than In+ in CHA zeolites, by a factor of 43, is the result of differences in the stabilization of the transition state due to the higher stability of Ga3+ vs In3+. The uniformity of the Ga+ sites in this material makes it an excellent model for the molecular understanding of metal cation-exchanged hydrocarbon interactions in zeolites.

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The increasing propane production from shale gas and the growing demand for propylene have renewed attention on the on-purpose catalytic propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH). The on-purpose PDH is industrialized in the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with a supported Pt-Sn catalyst. However, the cost and fast deactivation of Pt and the environmental impact associated with Cr have stimulated the exploration of alternative catalysts. (1) Ga-, (210) V-, (1114) Zr-, (1517) Zn-, (1820) Co-, (2123) and Fe-based materials (2426) and nanocarbon catalysts, (27,28) among others, have been investigated for this purpose. In particular, oxide supports (silica or zeolites) (2937) containing single metal sites (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, Fe2+, etc.) have promising dehydrogenation properties. For example, Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) toward propane dehydrogenation. (32,33) Further improvement of PDH performance in Ga-based catalysts remains a goal of the catalysis community. (2,7,32,33,38,39)
GaOx is usually introduced into the zeolite via impregnation and calcination. Bulk Ga2O3 cannot be reduced in the presence of H2 with the temperature range of 100800 C, (40) and the Brnsted acid sites (BASs) in zeolite promoted the reduction of GaOx and the exchange with Ga species, a process referred to as a reductive solid-state-ion exchange process. We have previously investigated the Ga speciation and PDH mechanism on the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst: (39,41,42) here, the Ga species formed over paired framework Al atoms (Ga2O22+) shows one order of magnitude higher reactivity than isolated Ga+. It is uncertain whether the same types of Ga species are present on other zeolites such as chabazite (CHA), considering that the pore size of CHA (an eight-membered ring zeolite) is smaller than that of ZSM-5 zeolite (an ten-membered ring) and that there are no five-membered rings in the CHA structure. Shimizu and co-workers reported CHA zeolite-supported metal cations (indium and gallium) as an active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. (43,44) In-CHA catalysts show better stability with less coke deposition than Ga-CHA, (43,44) although the latter has higher initial catalytic rates for ethane dehydrogenation. Detailed characterization of Ga-CHA and understanding the differences between indium and gallium were not attempted in this report.
We recently showed that In-CHA catalysts have better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than indium on silica, alumina, and bulk In2O3 and that this was the result of stable In+ sites inside the CHA crystals. (45) In(0) is formed on other supports upon reduction, as determined by stoichiometry analysis during reduction and in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report for the Ga-CHA catalyst applied to propane dehydrogenation. Ga-oxo clusters in CHA (46) have been shown to oxidize CH4; however, Ga speciation in CHA in its reduced form has not been determined. In addition, the reaction mechanism and other properties in ethane dehydrogenation might be different from propane dehydrogenation because the diameter of the molecules is different. For example, Bell and co-workers (33,47) found that Ga exchanged at Al pairs in Ga/H-MFI catalyzes propane and butane dehydrogenation while isolated Ga species do not; both Ga species, however, exhibited similar properties for ethane dehydrogenation.
In this work, Ga-CHA zeolites with several Ga/Al ratios (01.7) and Si/Al ratios (5, 12, and 25) have been prepared to investigate Ga speciation and the corresponding impact on PDH rates. In situ FTIR spectroscopy and H2/O2 pulse titrations have been employed to determine that extra-framework Ga+ is the stable site formed upon reduction of the Ga-CHA catalyst. The Ga+ site reacts with H2 to form GaHx at 150 C and GaHx decomposes at higher temperatures; the enthalpy of the formation of GaHx is approximately 51.2 kJ·mol1. Ga+ sites in CHA show high initial C3H6 yield and deactivate with time on stream (TOS), while the C3H6 selectivity is stable at 96%. The simultaneous deactivation and the growth of polycyclic aromatics in the crystal pores indicate that the accumulation of polycyclic aromatics is the main cause of the deactivation. These carbon-containing species can be oxidized at 600 C in air. The higher dehydrogenation reaction rate on Ga+ over In+ is rationalized on the basis of the difference in propane activation and the stabilization of the transition state.

Catalyst Preparation
CHA zeolites (Si/Al = 5, 12, 25) were synthesized via a hydrothermal method with N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantanammonium ion (TMAda+) as the structure-directing agent. (48,49) The detailed description of the synthesis is included in ref (45). The Si/Al ratios of H-CHA(5), H-CHA(12), and H-CHA(25) were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF, Rigaku WDXRF) to be 4.7  0.3, 12.0  1.3, and 24.8  3.0, respectively.
AEI zeolite was synthesized via the hydrothermal method. (49) 13.38 g of tetramethyl piperidinium hydroxide (Sachem, Inc., 20 wt%) was mixed into 35.34 g DI water at room temperature followed by the addition of 25.68 g of sodium silicate solution (PQ Corporation, 37.5 wt%) and 2.052 g 1 M sodium hydroxide solution for 15 min. Then, 2.566 g NH4-USY (Zeolyst CBV 712) was added to the mixture and then stirred for 30 min. The synthesis gel was then heated hydrothermally at 150 C for 7 days under static conditions. The zeolite samples were centrifuged (4500 rpm for 10 min), washed five times with DI water, and dried overnight at 80 C. The as-made zeolite was calcined in flowing air at 560 C for 8 h with a ramp rate of 2 C·min1 to obtain Na-AEI. Then, Na-AEI was ion-exchanged with ammonium nitrate aqueous solution (1 M, NH4NO3, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) at 80 C for 3 h (1 g zeolite per 150 mL solution) and then centrifuged to remove the supernatant. This ion-exchange process was repeated three times to ensure the complete removal of Na+ by NH4+, and then NH4-AEI was dried overnight at 80 C and treated in flowing air at 550 C for 8 h with a ramp rate of 2 C·min1 to obtain H-AEI samples. The Si/Al ratio of H-AEI(10) was 10.4  0.4 (by XRF).
Ga-CHA samples with varying Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation using an aqueous solution of gallium(III) nitrate hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich). (41) The prepared aqueous gallium solution was added dropwise to H-CHA followed by drying at 80 C and calcining at 600 C in flowing air for 2 h with a ramp rate of 5 C·min1. The calcined Ga-CHA catalysts were denoted as Ga-CHA(x, y), with x and y representing the Si/Al ratio and Ga/Al ratio, respectively. Ga-AEI(10,0.52) was prepared using the same method as the preparation of Ga-CHA except for using H-AEI(10) as the support. In-CHA(12,1.0) was prepared using the same method as the preparation of Ga-CHA except for using an aqueous solution of indium(III) nitrate hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich). The PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (1%Pt and 2.6%Sn) was prepared using incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) and SnCl2·2H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) on γ-Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar). (50) Then the catalyst was dried 80 C and calcined at 560 C in flowing air for 3 h with a ramp rate of 5 C·min1.
Pulse Reactor Studies
The reduction of the Ga-CHA catalyst and subsequent oxidation experiments were used to determine the oxidation state of Ga in reduced Ga-CHA samples in a customized pulse reactor (see Figure S1). (39,45) Typically, 50150 mg catalyst (2040 mesh) was packed into a quartz tube (1/4 in. outer diameter). A thermocouple was placed close to the catalyst bed to ensure accurate temperature measurement. The catalyst was first pretreated at 700 C with a ramp rate of 10 C·min1 in N2 flow (45 mL·min1) and then reduced with 10 vol% H2/N2 for 30 min. After that, the reduced sample was purged with N2 for another 30 min, followed by the introduction of 10 vol% O2/N2 pulses, which was achieved via a computer-controlled six-way valve with a 0.67 mL loop. The gas compositions were continuously monitored using an online mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer OMNI star). Before introducing the O2 pulse into the reactor, we obtained several stable peaks through the bypass line (Figure S1), and the stable peak area was used to calculate the O2 consumption. In a typical experiment, we fill the loop with 10 vol O2/N2, and each loop contained 2.74 μmol O2 molecules (at a temperature of 20 C). From the pulse experiment, the quantification of O2 pulses was achieved by comparing the integrated peak area of the 32 amu signal in the reactor effluent with that of pulses going through a bypass line. We obtained the total O2 consumption by accumulating the O2 consumption of each pulse. The water content formed during the reduction of Ga-CHA is calibrated using CuO as a standard sample. The following AMUs were used for analysis: 2 (H2), 18 (H2O), 28 (N2), and 32 (O2).
Materials Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalyst were obtained on a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA) in the range of 2θ = 450 with a step size of 0.04 and 0.5 s per step. The micropore volumes of the CHA zeolite samples were determined by the t-plot method based on N2 adsorption isotherms (196 C) on a Micromeritics 3Flex system. Before the adsorption measurements, the samples were degassed overnight at 350 C. Magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy was performed on an 11.7 T Bruker Avance III NMR spectrometer with a 4 mm HX probe at spinning speeds of 12 and 10 kHz for 27Al and 29Si, respectively. Direct excitation of 27Al and 29Si was performed with pulses of 1.0 (27Al) or 3.5 (29Si) μs, and 75 kHz 1H decoupling was applied during the acquisition. Reduced catalysts for characterization were obtained via reducing the samples with 10 vol% H2 at 700 C for 30 min with a ramp rate of 10 C·min1 and then cooling to room temperature before storage. Scanning electron microscope (SEM, Auriga-60, ZEISS) images were obtained after coating the catalysts with a gold/palladium alloy. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were conducted in a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 equipped with a TCD detector. A sample of approximately 100 mg of the catalyst was pretreated in He flow (50 mL·min1) at 200 C for 1 h and then cooled to 60 C. The TPR profiles were obtained by heating the sample to 900 C with a ramp rate of 10 C·min1 in a flow of 10 vol% H2/Ar (50 mL·min1). Diffuse reflectance UVvis spectra were collected on a UVvis spectrometer (JASCO, V-550) with a diffuse-reflectance attachment using around 100 mg of the catalyst loading into the cell at the window. In situ FTIR spectra were collected on an Agilent CARY 660 spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector. Before all experiments, the samples were dehydrated at 550 C for 30 min under vacuum to remove all adsorbed molecules. Chemicals such as H2 and D2 were introduced into the transmission cell, and corresponding pressure was controlled via the vacuum manifold. (41) In situ transmission FTIR with d3-acetonitrile (CD3CN) as probe molecules at 50 C was employed to monitor the presence of BASs and Lewis acid sites (LASs). (41) The detailed procedures are described in our recent report. (45) Ethylamine temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was conducted using the previously described pulse reactor to determine the BAS density of CHA zeolites. The detailed procedures are described elsewhere. (45)
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was conducted to quantify the amount of coke formed on the catalyst. Typically, 100 mg of the spent catalyst was loaded into a quartz tube and dehydrated at 550 C for 30 min in a flow of 45 mL·min1 N2 and then cooled to 100 C. After that, 10 vol% O2/N2 (50 mL·min1) was introduced and then heated to 700 C with a ramp rate of 10 C·min1. The following AMUs were used for analysis: 28 (N2), 32 (O2), and 44 (CO2).
Propane temperature-programmed reaction (C3H8-TPSR) was used to compare the initial activation temperature of propane on Ga-CHA and In-CHA catalysts; 100 mg fresh catalyst was loaded into a quartz tube and reduced at a specific temperature (700 C for Ga-CHA and 600 C for In-CHA) for 30 min in 10 vol% H2/N2 (50 mL·min1) and then purge by pure N2 before cooling to 100 C. After that, 10 vol% C3H8/N2 (50 mL·min1) was introduced and then heated to 700 C with a ramp rate of 10 C·min1. D2-propane scrambling temperature-programmed surface reaction (D2-C3H8-TPSR) was conducted to compare the CH activation of propane on reduced Ga-CHA and In-CHA catalysts; 100 mg fresh catalyst was loaded into a quartz tube and reduced at a specific temperature (700 C for Ga-CHA and 600 C for In-CHA) for 30 min in 10 vol% D2/N2 (50 mL·min1) and then purged with pure N2 before cooling to 100 C. After that, a mixture of D2/C3H8/N2 (5/5/40 mL·min1) was introduced and then heated to 700 C with a ramp rate of 10 C·min1. The following AMUs were used for analysis: 2 (H2), 3 (HD), 4 (D2), 16 (CH4), 18 (H2O), 27 (C3H6, C3H8), 28 (N2, C2H4), 29 (C3H8), 30 (C3H8, C2H6), 41 (C3H6, C3H8), 42 (C3H6, C3H8), 44 (C3H8), and 45 (C3H7D).
Catalytic Reaction Rate Measurements
The PDH catalytic rates were determined in a fixed-bed plug-flow reactor using a quartz tube (1/4 in. diameter). (42) Typically, 15100 mg catalysts with a 2040 mesh particle size range were loaded for each experiment. Before the catalytic activity measurements, the catalyst was reduced at 700 C for 30 min with a ramp rate of 10 C·min1 in 10 vol% H2 with balancing N2 (20 mL·min1) followed by purging with N2 at the same temperature before cooling to 550 C. The reduced sample was then exposed to 5 vol% C3H8 with balancing N2 (100 mL·min1). The total pressure was maintained at 101.32 kPa. The reactor effluent was periodically sampled using an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A) via a heated gas line, equipped with an Rt-Q-BOND column and a flame ionization detector (FID) used for product analysis. FID response factors for CH4, C2H4, C3H6, and C3H8 were calibrated before the activity measurements. The conversion of C3H8 was determined by eq 1; the selectivity and yield of CH4, C2H4, and C3H6 were obtained by eqs 2 and 3.

where i represents the hydrocarbon product CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H6 in the effluent gas, ni is the number of carbon atoms of component i, and Fi is the molar flow rate. The C3H8 conversion was measured at differential conversions (<6%). PDH rates were determined from C3H6 yields, while C3H8 cracking rates were determined from the yields of CH4 and C2H4. Testing the catalyst under low C3H8 conversion limited secondary reactions. PDH and cracking rates over Ga-CHA and In-CHA were normalized to the Al content of the catalyst. Apparent activation energies were determined in the temperature range of 530570 C after 10 h on stream (deactivation becomes insignificant). The carbon balance was determined by eq 4.
Catalytic experiments at high conversion using Ga-CHA were carried out increasing the catalyst loading (0.5 g in 1/2 in. quartz tube) and decreasing the flow rate to increase the contact time with propane. The catalyst was reduced at 700 C for 30 min with a ramp rate of 10 C·min1 in 10 vol% H2 with balancing N2 (20 mL·min1), followed by purging with N2 at the same temperature before cooling to 550 C, and then starting the reaction with cofeeding H2 (5 kPa C3H8, 10 kPa H2, and 85 kPa N2) or without cofeeding H2 (5 kPa C3H8 and 95 kPa N2) with a total flow rate of 10 mL·min1. The regeneration of the spent catalyst was conducted by calcination at 600 C for 60 min in the presence of 10 vol% O2/N2 followed by the reduction with the same condition as fresh samples.
Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations
Gaussian 09, Revision D.01 was used for all calculations at the M062x/def2svp level of theory. (51) Thermal corrections to the electronic energy were calculated at 298 K in the harmonic oscillator approximation. Transition states were confirmed by vibrational frequency analysis and intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations. All reported intermediates are the lowest energy structures chosen from the calculation results of multiple starting geometries.
Two different quantum clusters for CHA were employed in this study. One cluster was created by encompassing all framework atoms within 6.5 Å of the center of the six-membered ring of the sodalite cage in the publicly available crystal structure for the CHA framework from the database of the Structure Commission of the International Zeolite Association (IZA-SC). Capping hydrogens were attached to dangling bonds at the boundary of the cluster and frozen in all calculations to prevent the cluster from deviating significantly from the crystal structure. This resulted in a 106-atom cluster in which a Ga atom (or In atom) was placed above the center of the six-membered ring of the sodalite cage and allowed to relax, resulting in the Ga atom (or In atom) shifting toward the single Al T-site. This became the starting point for optimized geometries of the Ga or In atom (oxidation state +1) and GaH2 (or InH2) forms of the catalyst active site, as well as the transition state between these two intermediates.
The second cluster was created by encompassing all framework atoms within 7.0 Å of the T-site in CHA where the framework Al atom was placed. Like the previous cluster, capping hydrogens were used to fix the boundaries of the cluster. This 178-atom cluster was used to compare optimized geometries for Ga and GaH2 interacting with different pairs of oxygen atoms surrounding the Al T-site. In particular, predicted infrared vibrations were compared between structures with Ga located in the plane of the six-membered ring vs eight-membered ring(s) intersecting the Al T-site.

Reduction of Ga-CHA Catalysts
The XRD patterns (Figure S2) of acidic chabazite (H-CHA) samples show that the synthesized zeolites are highly crystalline and free of impurities. (52) The zeolite crystal dimensions for the H-CHA(5), H-CHA(12), and H-CHA(25) determined from SEM images (Figure S3) are approximately 300 nm, 1 μm, and 1.5 μm, respectively. The 27Al MAS solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of H-CHA (x = 5, 12, and 25) (Figure S4) is dominated by a strong sharp signal at 54 ppm, attributed to tetrahedrally coordinated Al in the zeolite. A weak feature at 0 ppm in the MAS NMR spectrum (Figure S4f) was observed on H-CHA(5), which was assigned to a small amount of octahedral aluminum present as extra-framework Al (AlEF), consistent with previous observations. (53) The physical properties and BASs densities of H-CHA(x) (x = 5, 12, 25) samples are summarized in Table 1 and Figure S5. The N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms show the typical shape observed in materials containing only micropores, and the micropore volume of the H-CHA is in the range of 0.270.29 cm3·g1, consistent with the structure of CHA zeolites.

cDetermined by ethylamine-TPD upon dehydration treatment under different conditions.
dCalculated from XRF and BASs densities.
The BASs densities of H-CHA (dehydrated at 550 C for 30 min, in Table 1) were determined by ethylamine-TPD to be 1158, 1100, and 620 μmol·g1 for H-CHA(5), H-CHA(12), and H-CHA(25), respectively. The BAS/Al ratio in H-CHA(25) is approximately 1.0, showing that almost all Al atoms are in the framework and form BASs. The BAS/Al ratio decreases as the Si/Al ratio decreases, which is interpreted as the result of a growing fraction of extra-framework Al in the zeolite. This is consistent with the 27Al MAS NMR spectra (Figure S4) of the samples. Importantly, as the pretreatment temperature increased to 700 C (we reduce Ga-CHA at this temperature and will discuss it later), the BAS in H-CHA becomes less available on all H-CHA samples. The decrease of available BASs is more significant in H-CHA(5), that is, BAS/Al ratio decreases from 0.60 upon treating at 550 C for 30 min to 0.38 upon treating at 700 C for 30 min. This phenomenon has been explained as BAS dehydroxylation via dehydration in H-CHA zeolite upon a high-temperature treatment. (48) CD3CN-FTIR results (Figure S6) show that no significant change was observed on H-CHA(12) before and after the 700 C treatment. On H-CHA(5), the peak at 2297 cm1 (corresponding to the BAS) decreased and the peak at 2324 cm1 (corresponding to the LAS) increased after 700 C treatment compared to the calcined sample, demonstrating that a fraction of BAS was converted to the LAS via dehydroxylation, and consistent with the ethylamine-TPD results (Table 1). Notably, the XRD patterns of the H-CHA(x) treated at 700 C (Figure S7ac) show similar diffraction peak intensities to those of the calcined sample, and the N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms of H-CHA(x) at 700 C treatment almost overlap with those of the parent zeolite (Figure S7df). These results verify the structural stability of H-CHA even after the 700 C treatment. It has been reported (48) that H-CHA with a Si/Al ratio of 12 has no significant structural damage even after 800 C treatment, while H-CHA(6) reveals some collapse of the microporosity at temperatures over 700 C for a few hours. Our work indicates that 700 C treatment for a short time (30 min) does not affect the structural stability of H-CHA(5) although a fraction of the BASs O-H groups dehydroxylate after treatment.
The Ga-CHA catalysts were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation on H-CHA zeolite followed by drying and calcination. The composition of the prepared samples is summarized in Table S2. Ga2O3 diffraction peaks were not observed for Ga-CHA samples (Figure S2), which indicated that Ga2O3 is highly dispersed and formed in an insufficient amount to generate an XRD pattern. H2-TPR profiles of Ga-CHA(x, 1.0) (Figure 1a) show a broad reduction peak as the temperature increases from 300 to 800 C with a maximum around at 550 C, accompanied by the water formation (Figure S8a). This profile is consistent with reported results showing that Ga-CHA reduces between 400 and 800 C. (46) Thus, we selected 700 C as the reduction temperature of the Ga-CHA catalyst to ensure the complete reduction before the PDH reaction and before spectroscopic analysis. Notably, Ga-CHA requires a higher reduction temperature than Ga/H-ZSM-5, which can be reduced at 550 C (Figure S8b). This was interpreted as the need to drive the Ga species into a smaller pore size in CHA zeolites. Meanwhile, Ga-CHA shows a higher reduction temperature than In-CHA because the latter can be reduced entirely below 600 C. (45) No significant changes were observed in the XRD patterns and NMR spectra (27Al and 29Si) of the calcined and reduced Ga-CHA zeolite compared with H-CHA (Figures S2 and S4), confirming that a high-temperature reduction (700 C for 30 min) does not damage the CHA structure.

The reduction was conducted in 10 vol% H2 flow at 700 C, and the subsequent oxidation was conducted by introducing pulses containing 10 vol% O2 at 700 C. This is continued until no further O2 consumption was observed. (c) Relationship of the formed H2O and consumed O atoms on Ga-CHA(x, y) catalysts. (d) O/Al ratio as a function of the Ga/Al ratio of catalysts. (e) Proposed Ga species in Ga-CHA formed upon reduction.
Ga2O3 particles were observed on Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) on the zeolite surface (Figure S3), due to the relatively large amount of Ga loading, in agreement with the observation of mesopores associated with Ga2O3 on the N2 adsorption isotherms of Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) (Figure S5c). The large Ga2O3 particles disappeared upon reduction of the samples, showing that Ga2O3 was reduced and formed highly dispersed species (below we show that extra-framework Ga species are formed). The decreased micropore volumes of reduced Ga-CHA(x, 1.0) compared with H-CHA(x) show that Ga2O3 particles on the external surface, upon reduction, moved into the micropore of the zeolite (Table S1).
Determination of the ratio of formed H2O during the in situ reduction of Ga-CHA to the oxygen consumption during subsequent oxidation has been used to identify Ga speciation on reduced Ga-CHA catalysts. Taking Ga-CHA(12, 1.0) as an example (Figure 1b), it can be seen that a significant amount of H2O (18 amu) is generated upon reduction in 10 vol% H2 flow at 700 C for 30 min followed by the introduction of O2 pulses. The first 20 O2 pulses are completely consumed, and then several O2 pulses are partially consumed until O2 peak areas are stable, indicating that the oxidation is complete. It is noted that a small signal at m/z of 32 appears when reducing the Ga-CHA catalyst (Figure 1b). It is likely an accompanying signal due to the formation of H2O (Figure S9a) rather than the O2 formation. The control experiment using CuO as a reference sample confirms appearance of the 32 amu signal with the formation of H2O (18 amu) during the reduction process (Figure S9b). The amount of H2O formed during the reaction as a function of O consumed during the subsequent oxidation is shown in Figures 1c and S10. On samples with Si/Al ratios of 25 and 12, the amounts of water formed and O2 consumed increase monotonically with Ga loading as the Ga/Al ratio increases to 1.7. The molar ratio between formed H2O during the reduction process and oxygen consumed was close to 1.5, confirming that Ga2O3 in calcined samples is reduced to Ga+ by stoichiometry Ga2O3 + 2 H+Z + 2 H2  2 Ga+Z + 3 H2O, in agreement with previous studies. (32,39) The CD3CN-FTIR spectrum of Ga-CHA(12, 1.0) without reduction is the same as that of parent H-CHA(12) (Figure S11), indicating that the BAS was not replaced by Ga species before reduction. This also evidences that the initial Ga phase is Ga2O3 on CHA with a Si/Al ratio of 12. Upon reduction, the peak intensity near 2324 cm1 (LAS) grows significantly, and the BAS peak almost disappears, suggesting that the BAS was largely displaced by Ga species upon the initial reduction of Ga-CHA catalysts. Note that a new peak centered at 2273 cm1 is observed, suggesting that the second Ga species (LAS) was introduced upon reduction. The assignment of the second Ga species will be discussed below. Interestingly, on CHA with a Si/Al ratio of 5, the ratio of formed H2O to oxygen consumed is slightly lower than 1.5 (between 1.0 and 1.5). It is possible that in this sample, a fraction of the gallium oxide was exchanged with the BAS during the impregnation process or dehydration process to form [GaO]+, possibly because H-CHA(5) contains a higher BAS density (Table 1) and a smaller crystal size than H-CHA(12) and H-CHA(25) zeolites. [GaO]+ was reduced to Ga+ as described by the reaction: [GaO]+Z + H2  2 Ga+Z + H2O, resulting in a ratio of formed H2O to consumed oxygen of 1.0. Therefore, the slightly lower ratio of formed H2O to oxygen consumed on Ga-CHA(5, y) is the result of the additive effect of the reduction of Ga2O3 and [GaO]+.
Additional control experiments were performed to validate this technique for investigating the reduction and oxidation of the Ga-CHA system.
(1) The reduction of calcined Ga-CHA(12, 1.0) produces H2O (18 amu) 1.5 times more that of the H2-O2 treated sample (Figure S8a). This is interpreted as in the H2-O2 treated sample, the Ga+ site was oxidized to [GaO]+ sites, which were subsequently reduced to Ga+ upon reduction (Ga2O3 + H2 + 2H+Z  2 Ga+Z + 3H2O; [GaO]+ + H2  Ga+ + H2O). More importantly, the reduction of the H2-O2 treated sample ([GaO]+) was completed before 700 C, a lower reduction temperature compared to the calcined Ga-CHA catalyst. This indicates that if [GaO]+ species is present on the sample (during the impregnation and calcination stage), it can be definitely reduced to Ga+ sites in the presence of H2 at 700 C.
(2) The H2-TPR experiments (Figure S8b) show that bulk Ga2O3, Ga2O3/SiO2, and Ga2O3/Al2O3 do not consume H2 when the temperature is below 800 C, consistent with the reported results. (40) Thus, it follows that the presence of the BAS promotes the reduction of Ga2O3 in the Ga-CHA catalyst. On the other hand, a minor increase in O consumption when the Ga/Al ratio rises from 1.0 to 1.7 demonstrates that the excess of Ga2O3 is not reduced when the BAS was largely consumed. It is thus concluded that Ga2O3 cannot be reduced if not exchanged with the BAS, thus ruling out the possibility that O consumption is partly from the reduced Ga species on the external surface of CHA zeolites.
(3) Although BAS dehydroxylation occurs during high-temperature treatment, the H2O signal monitored during the temperature-programmed heat treatment of H-CHA(5) and Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) indicated that BAS dehydroxylation mainly occurred between 600 and 700 C (Figure S12a). Thus, the water formation due to BAS dehydroxylation has not been accounted for because we heated the Ga-CHA sample to 700 C in the inert gas, followed by the introduction of 10 vol% H2/N2 gas to reduce the sample at 700 C, as described in the experimental details. At the same time, the formed water is negligible compared to the reduction of Ga-CHA (Figure S12b). These results rule out the effect of BAS dehydroxylation on the quantification of water formation during the reduction of Ga-CHA (Figure 1). No O2 consumption was observed on the reduced H-CHA(x), as shown in Figure S12c. This indicates that there is no redox behavior on parent H-CHA despite the BAS dehydroxylation, which further confirms that the O2 consumption of reduced Ga-CHA is due to the oxidation of Ga+.
The oxygen consumed (on a per-atom basis) to the Al density (referred to as the O/Al ratio) in the reduced Ga-CHA(x, y) is plotted as a function of the Ga/Al ratio in Figure 1d. Considering that Ga+ will be oxidized to +3 with an O/Ga ratio of 1.0, the (close to) unity slope between O/Al vs Ga/Al ratio means that Ga species in fresh Ga-CHA are all reduced and exchanged with BASs to form Ga+. As shown in Figure 1d, the O/Al ratios increase almost linearly as the Ga/Al ratio rises up to a point (1.0 for H-CHA(12) and H-CHA(25), and 0.47 for H-CHA(5)) and slowly increase with further addition of the Ga/Al ratio, indicating that it achieves equilibrium between the exchange of Ga species and BAS at a high Ga/Al ratio.
Two features of the dependence of O/Al ratios on the Ga/Al ratios are worth noting: (1) the slope between O/Al ratio vs Ga/Al ratios gradually deviates from 1.0 with the increase of Si/Al ratios, indicating that the efficiency of the reduction and exchange of Ga species with BASs decreases with the Si/Al ratios, as observed in the Ga/H-ZSM-5 system. (41) This may be due to the lower BAS density and larger crystal size with the increase of Si/Al ratios of the zeolites investigated. (2) The maximum O/Al ratios determined at high Ga/Al ratios decrease with the reduction of the Si/Al ratios: 0.79, 0.77, and 0.54 for H-CHA with Si/Al ratios of 25, 12, and 5, respectively. This is probably the result of the decreasing available BAS/Al ratio as the Si/Al ratio decreases, as discussed above.
The BAS and LAS of reduced Ga-CHA with different Ga/Al and Si/Al ratios were examined by in situ FTIR spectroscopy using CD3CN as the probe molecule (see Figure S13). On H-CHA with a Si/Al ratio of 25, as the Ga/Al ratio increases from 0 to 1.0, the BAS signal was gradually consumed, with the formation of LAS at 2324 cm1, as a result of the formation of the Ga+ site. On a Si/Al ratio of 12, in addition to the appearance of LAS at 2324 cm1, a second LAS peak at 2273 cm1 starts to appear at a Ga/Al ratio of 0.52 becoming significant at Ga/Al ratios of 0.72 and 1.0. On H-CHA(5), the second LAS peak appears at a Ga/Al ratio of 0.31 and becomes prominent as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.5. In the case of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, it was reported (54) that GaOx oligomers were formed when the Ga/Al ratio is higher than 0.3. Our recent work on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (41) characterization also found a second LAS (GaOx oligomers) at high Ga/Al ratios (>0.5) when using pyridine as the probe molecule. Combined with the pulse titration results, it follows that on H-CHA(x), Ga+ sites were introduced at low and medium Ga/Al ratios, and GaOx oligomers are introduced at high Ga/Al ratios. Note that the Ga/Al ratio where GaOx oligomers start to form decreases with decreasing Si/Al ratio (0.72 for H-CHA(12) and 0.47 for H-CHA(5)), which is consistent with the observation that the available BAS/Al ratio decreases with decreasing Si/Al ratio (see Table 1).
Gallium Hydride Species in Reduced Ga-CHA
In situ FTIR spectroscopy was employed to monitor the formation of Ga hydride from extra-framework Ga+ sites with H2. The examination of the ability of Ga+ sites to form Ga hydride is essential to characterize the Ga speciation and understand their propane dehydrogenation abilities. (41,42) We have used H2 as probe molecules to identify Ga speciation in the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst; that is, Ga exchanged with Al pairs can form Ga hydride at 550 C upon reduction, while isolated Ga+ cannot. (41) Considering that the fresh Ga-CHA catalyst needs to be reduced at a high temperature (such as 700 C), which is beyond the maximum temperature achievable in the FTIR cell, we reduced the Ga-CHA samples at 700 C for 30 min in a tube furnace and cooled them down to room temperature under inert gas (Ar) before exposing to the ambient conditions (this is referred to as the H2O2 treated sample).
The H2-TPR profiles of H2O2 treated Ga-CHA(12, 1.0) have a lower reduction temperature than fresh samples (Figure 2a). This can be interpreted as Ga+ sites being oxidized into small nanoparticles after exposing to ambient conditions. These gallium oxide nanoparticles are placed close to the BAS, resulting in an easier to reduce oxide to form Ga+ sites. The FTIR spectrum (Figure 2b) of the dehydrated Ga-CHA(12, 1.0) (before reduction) shows two peaks at 3728 and 3575 cm1, attributed to the external silanol group (SiOH) and bridge-OH groups (BAS), respectively. Upon reduction at 550 C, the peak at 3575 cm1 almost disappears, suggesting that BASs are consumed after reducing Ga-CHA(12, 1.0). The reduction process is similar to that of the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst discussed in a previous report. (41) No GaHx was observed between 2000 and 2100 cm1 (Figure S14) on reduced Ga-CHA. A HD exchange experiment further demonstrates the lack of GaHx at 550 C on reduced Ga-CHA. The silanol group and the extra-framework of AlOH groups were converted to the corresponding OD groups upon contact with D2. There is, however, no change in the spectra of the D2 versus H2-treated samples between 1600 and 2000 cm1 (Figure S14c), demonstrating the absence of GaHx on the reduced Ga-CHA. Similar observations were made on Ga-CHA with Si/Al ratios of 25 and 5 (Figures S15 and S16). The lack of Ga hydride vibrations also suggests that the extra-framework species is better described as a Ga+ site instead of [GaH2]+ or [GaH]2+ upon reducing Ga-CHA, in agreement with the results from pulse titration experiments (Figure 1).

The background spectrum was collected in the spectral cell without a sample pellet at room temperature under vacuum. (c) FTIR spectra of reduced Ga-CHA(12, 1.0) upon contacting H2 at 150 C with TOS (indicated in the figure legends). The catalyst sample was reduced via H2 (1 atm) at 550 C for 30 min and treated under vacuum for another 30 min before cooling down to 150 C under vacuum. The background spectrum was collected in the spectral cell with a sample pellet at 150 C under vacuum before introducing H2. (d) Integrated Ga hydride peak area (the entire range between 2000 and 2100 cm1) as a function of time at different temperatures (indicated in the figure legends). (e) FTIR spectra of reduced Ga-CHA(12, 1.0) upon contacting H2 with 60 min at different temperatures. (f) Integrated Ga hydride peak area as a function of temperature. (g) DFT calculations of the enthalpy change of the formation of Ga hydride from Ga+ and H2. (h) Proposed structure of the formation and decomposition of Ga hydride.
This case is different from Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15 and 28), which could form GaHx (2037 and 2053 cm1) upon reduction at 550 C, but is similar to the case of Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a high Si/Al ratio (Si/Al = 39), where we could not observe an GaHx band upon reduction at 550 C. (41) This difference may result from the distinct structures and metal coordination environments in the MFI and CHA frameworks.
Interestingly, upon introducing H2 at 150 C on reduced Ga-CHA(12, 1.0), a significant band centered at 2034 cm1 appears with another shoulder peak, showing the peak intensities growing with time. Similar observations are made on Ga-CHA(25, 1.0) and Ga-CHA(5, 1.0), as shown in Figure S17. Introducing D2 at 150 C on the reduced Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) also produces a peak at 1463 cm1 (Figure S18). The 1.39 ratio of the two peaks (2034 cm1 vs 1486 cm1) confirms the assignment of Ga hydride to the band at 2034 cm1. Ga hydride was also reported to form on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, and two IR peaks at 2041 and 2059 cm1 were assigned to GaH and GaH2, respectively. (55) There, however, is no definitive experimental evidence for assigning peaks at 2041 and 2059 cm1 to GaH and GaH2, respectively. (55) The different IR features may result from Ga hydride in different environments. Our recent work in Ga/H-ZSM-5 pointed out that the observed two IR features might be the same Ga hydride with different coordination environments. (39) On the other hand, we have previously shown using pulse titration (Figure 1) and CD3CN-FTIR (Figure S13) that only extra-framework Ga+ is formed on reduced Ga-CHA at low and medium Ga/Al ratios, independent of the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite. Therefore, we tend to assign the two IR peaks as GaH2 with distinct coordination environments, possibly with different orientations and interactions with the framework. The gradual increase in peak intensity indicated that the reaction of Ga+ with H2 occurs slowly (Figures 2d and S19). As the temperature increases from 200 to 500 C, two features on the GaHx formation vs time are observed: (1) the time needed to reach equilibrium decreases, that is, faster GaHx formation rates as a function of temperature, and (2) the GaHx peak intensity at equilibrium decreased with temperature, suggesting that GaHx formation is exothermic. This also explains the absence of GaHx upon introducing H2 at 550 C. Similar GaHx intensities were found when cooling the reduced Ga-CHA in the presence of H2 (1 atm) compared to the equilibrated GaHx intensities when exposed to H2 on Ga+ at a specific temperature (Figure S20), confirming that the same GaHx is formed from two different initial conditions and that GaHx intensity is only dependent on temperature.
Based on the GaHx equilibrium intensity as a function of temperature (Figure 2e,f), we calculated the enthalpy change of Ga+ with H2 via the Vant Hoff equation (51.2 kJ·mol1). The DFT calculations (Figure 2g, Tables S3 and S4, and Text S1 in the Supporting Information) show that the theoretical enthalpy change was 34.0 kJ·mol1. It was noted that the estimated experimental enthalpy change is dependent on the temperature range selected for the calculation. For example, the enthalpy change in the temperature range of 300500 C was estimated as 51.2 kJ·mol1, while it was 20.8 kJ·mol1 in the temperature range of 150300 C. This difference may be caused by two reasons: (1) the reaction enthalpy change of Ga+ with H2 is temperature-dependent and (2) the enthalpy change in the low-temperature range is underestimated because GaHx density may not achieve equilibrium due to the slow kinetics at low temperature (Figure 2d). Note that the IR bands associated with Ga hydride were predicted from DFT to be 20602140 cm1 depending on the position of Ga relative to the Al tetrahedron in the 178-atom cluster investigated (Table S4): the calculated vibrations of GaH stretching bands are 2060 and 2140 cm1 when Ga is in the six-membered ring window and 2074 and 2087 cm1 when Ga is in the eight-membered ring window. The observed Ga hydride peak position (20002100 cm1, in Figure 2c) indicates that the Ga preferred coordination environment is likely over the eight-membered ring window of the CHA cage. The experimental value (51.2 kJ·mol1 in the temperature range of 300500 C) is consistent with the theoretical value from DFT calculations. Therefore, we conclude that Ga+ could form GaHx at low temperature (150500 C) and GaHx decomposes at high temperature (such as 550 C, Figure 2h). The formation of GaHx species is, formally, an oxidation of the Ga, and because the stable oxidation states of Ga are +1 and +3, we expect that most of the species observed are GaH2+ moieties (Figure 2h).
Examination of the FTIR spectra of reduced Ga-CHA with varying Ga/Al ratios and Si/Al ratios also supports the formation of GaHx by Ga species reacting with H2 (Figure 3). On the sample with a Si/Al ratio of 12, no GaHx was observed on H-CHA(12). The GaHx band is observed on Ga-CHA with different Ga/Al ratios and Si/Al ratios (Figure 3ac). On Ga-CHA with a Si/Al ratio of 25, the GaHx intensity increases as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 1.0. The nearly linear increase of GaHx intensity vs Ga/Al ratio suggests that only a single type of Ga species is introduced in the Ga/Al range of 01.0, which should be extra-framework Ga+ based on the above discussions. On Ga-CHA with a Si/Al ratio of 12, the GaHx intensity grows as the Ga/Al ratio increases to 0.7 and decreases slightly with a further increase of the Ga/Al ratio to 1.0. The slight decrease of GaHx intensity may result from the introduction of GaOx oligomers at high Ga loadings, as found at a high Ga/Al ratio in the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. (41) Note that GaHx intensity starts to decrease at a Ga/Al ratio higher than 0.47 on a Si/Al ratio of 5. The consistency between GaHx vs Ga/Al ratios and O/Al ratio vs Ga/Al ratio further demonstrates that only extra-framework Ga+ is formed on reduced Ga-CHA at low Ga/Al ratios, independent of the samples Si/Al ratio.

The catalyst sample was reduced via H2 (1 atm) for 30 min and treated under vacuum for another 30 min before cooling down to 150 C under vacuum. The background spectrum was collected in the spectral cell with a reduced pellet at 150 C under vacuum (before introducing H2).

Propane Dehydrogenation on Extra-Framework Ga+ Sites
Calcined catalysts were reduced in 10 vol% H2 for 30 min at 700 C before introducing 5.07 kPa C3H8 with balancing N2. On Ga-CHA(12, 1.0), Figure 4a, the initial C3H6 yield is 4% and decreases rapidly within 100 min TOS. After that, the C3H6 formation rates decrease (i.e., deactivate) slowly for the next 10 h. Notably, the C3H6 selectivity is 96%, higher than that on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (91%) reported in ref (39). This result shows that Ga-CHA is highly selective for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The reduction over time of the propane dehydrogenation rate does not affect C3H6 selectivity, indicating that the deactivation of the catalyst might result from coke or carbonaceous deposit formation without changing the active site.
Figure 4
Figure 4. (a) C3H6 yield, C3H6 selectivity, and carbon balance as a function of TOS over Ga-CHA(12, 1.0). (b) UVvis spectra of spent Ga-CHA(12, 1.0) with different reaction times (inset: integrated peak area at 400 nm as a function of reaction time). Reaction conditions: 550 C, C3H8 partial pressure 5.07 kPa with balancing N2. (c) C3H6 yield, C3H6 selectivity, and carbon balance as a function of TOS over Ga-CHA(12, 1.0) after several regeneration cycles. Reaction conditions: 550 C, C3H8 pressure 5.07 kPa, and H2 pressure 10.14 kPa with balancing N2. After the completion of the initial run for 60 h, the catalyst was calcined in 10 vol% O2/N2 (50 mL·min1) at 600 C for with a ramp rate of 10 C·min1 followed by cooling to room temperature under an N2 atmosphere. The catalyst was then reduced in 10 vol% H2/N2 (20 mL·min1) at 700 C for 30 min with a ramp rate of 10 C·min1 and cooled to 550 C to start the propane reaction.
UVvis spectra were collected on the spent Ga-CHA(12, 1.0) with reaction times ranging from 5 to 600 min to track the formation of carbonaceous species (Figure 4b). For Ga-CHA with the propane dehydrogenation reaction for 5 min, the UVvis spectrum showed a peak at 400 nm, which is attributed to polycyclic aromatics. (56) The peak intensity grows monotonically with reaction time (5.07 kPa C3H8 with balancing N2 at 550 C). The density of polycyclic aromatics accumulates quickly in the first 60 min and then accumulates slowly with TOS. The similarity between temporal trends of the polycyclic aromatics formation rate and PDH deactivation rate as a function of time suggests that the accumulation of polycyclic aromatics in the CHA micropores is the main reason for deactivation. Recall that CHA contains only small pores (3.8 Å in diameter) and that these species then cannot diffuse or move between adjacent CHA cages.
Cofeeding H2 with propane (5.07 kPa C3H8, 10.14 kPa H2, and balancing N2) can effectively inhibit the catalyst deactivation without decreasing the C3H6 selectivity (Figure S21), although the initial activity decreased due to product inhibition by approximately 50%. The Ga-CHA(12, 1.0) was tested at a long residence time (373 gCat·h·molC3H81) to achieve high propane conversions. As shown in Figure 4c, the catalyst shows a high initial propylene yield (17%) that decreases gradually over time. The propylene yield remains approximately 10% after 60 h on stream. Although the initial propylene selectivity is below 90% and carbon balance is below 95% due to the accumulation of polycyclic aromatics, the propylene selectivity and carbon balance stabilize at 93 and 98%, respectively. Importantly, the spent catalyst with 60 h TOS could achieve the same propane dehydrogenation performance after two regeneration steps (Figure 4c); that is, the spent Ga-CHA catalyst can be restored to the same initial performance by oxidation of the accumulated polycyclic aromatic in diluted O2 at 600 C (Figure S22a). We tested the PDH reaction without cofeeding H2 maintaining the same residence time, as shown in Figure S23. The catalyst was found to exhibit good initial propylene yield but deactivates quickly. The propylene yield dropped from 22 to 5% after 60 h on stream, showing a faster deactivation rate than the H2 cofeeding experiment. TPO experiments on the spent catalyst (Figure S22b) showed that more coke is formed on the catalyst without cofeeding H2 compared to that with cofeeding H2. Importantly, the same regeneration procedure (600 C for 1 h) can also recover the initial PDH performance (Figure S23). In addition, we monitored the water formation during in H2-TPR experiments using the sample after the third regeneration (Figure S24). The results show that Ga-CHA(12, 1.0) after the third regeneration forms H2O in comparable amounts to that of the H2O2 treated sample, which mainly contains [GaO]+ species, as discussed before. It follows that [GaO]+ species is the dominant species after regeneration, which is converted to extra-framework Ga+ species upon reduction.
We prepared CHA with a Si/Al ratio of 25 using Gounders method under a Na+-free composition, (57) referred to as H-CHA(25)-G. The XRD pattern and N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms of H-CHA(25)-G confirm that we successfully synthesized a highly crystalline form of the CHA zeolite. The SEM image shows that the crystal size is approximately 10 μm (Figure S25a), which is much larger than that of H-CHA(x) investigated in the current work. On Ga-CHA(25, 1.0)-G (same preparation method as Ga-CHA(12, 1.0)) with calcined and reduced conditions, similar observations were made for the crystalline properties (Figure S25b) and micropore volumes (Figure S25c) as for Ga-CHA(12, 1.0). However, the H2-TPR profile of Ga-CHA(25, 1.0)-G shows a higher reduction temperature than Ga-CHA(25, 1.0) as 700 C cannot completely reduce the Ga species (Figure S26a). The higher reduction temperature is likely due to the larger crystal size of H-CHA(25)-G (10 μm vs 1.5 μm), which requires an elevated temperature to drive the Ga species into the micropores of the zeolite and more time to overcome the longer diffusion length. The Ga-CHA(25, 1.0)-G exhibits a similar deactivation trend (Figure S26b) to Ga-CHA(12, 1.0), a similar PDH performance of Ga+ sites in CHA zeolites prepared using different methods. The lower C3H6 selectivity (80%) of Ga-CHA(25, 1.0)-G is due to a lower level of exchange between BAS and Ga+ sites, which requires a higher temperature in this sample.
A similar experiment was conducted on Ga-AEI(10, 0.52), where AEI is a different type of small pore size (3D eight-membered ring) of zeolite structurally related to CHA. The characterization data of H-AEI(10) are summarized in Table S1 and Figure S27, confirming that the synthesized AEI zeolite is highly crystalline. Three similar features are observed on Ga-AEI(10, 0.52) and Ga-CHA(12, 0.72) catalysts: (1) similar reduction properties (water formation during reduction and O consumption during subsequent oxidation); (2) the ability to form GaHx at 150 C by the reduced samples; (3) the PDH rate shows a similar deactivation trend; that is, the rates decrease rapidly initially and then deactivate slowly (Figures S28S30). These similarities between Ga-AEI and Ga-CHA are not surprising because both small-pore zeolites have double-six-membered rings (d6MR) and eight-membered ring (8MR) openings with pore dimensions of 3.4 and 3.8 Å. (49,58) Ga-CHA shows slightly superior PDH performance to Ga-AEI, considering the same Ga loading on the two samples. The XRD patterns (Figure S31) of the spent Ga-CHA and Ga-AEI retain the crystal structure of CHA and AEI zeolite, respectively, demonstrating the structural stability of both samples during the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
As a benchmark, a PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation. (50) As shown in Figure S32, the PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst showed a high initial C3H6 yield (29%) and deactivated quickly within 5 h of TOS; the C3H6 yield decreased slowly in the following 40 h. The C3H6 selectivity decreased from 99 to 96% within 40 h on stream. Although Ga-CHA shows a somewhat lower reaction rate compared with PtSn/γ-Al2O3 (Figures 4a and S32), the high and stable propylene selectivity makes Ga-CHA a good candidate for propane dehydrogenation.
The impact of the Ga/Al ratio and Si/Al ratio of the Ga-CHA catalyst on the PDH performance was examined (Figure 5). All Ga-CHA catalysts showed a high initial activity that decreased gradually over time. Propylene selectivity on Ga-CHA catalysts increases with the Ga/Al ratio and stabilizes at approximately 96% at a Ga/Al ratio higher than 0.7 (Figure S33). The initial PDH rates as a function of Ga/Al ratio (01.7) on H-CHA (Si/Al ratios of 5, 12, and 25) are shown in Figure 5a. Rates are expressed in TOFAl (TOF: turnover frequency) to allow for a fair comparison of different Si/Al ratios. For a Si/Al ratio of 25, the TOFAl increases monotonically as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 1.0 and decreases slightly with a further addition to the Ga/Al ratio of 1.7. Our previous work on Ga/H-ZSM-5 has shown that the exchanged Ga species are formed in the low Ga/Al ratio, but high Ga loading leads to the formation GaOx oligomers, thus reducing the effective reaction rate. (42) Similar observations were made on H-CHA with Si/Al ratios of 12 and 5, except for the different turning point of the Ga/Al ratio from increased activity to decreased activity (0.72 for a Si/Al ratio of 12, 0.47 for a Si/Al ratio of 5). The shift of the turning point to a lower Ga/Al ratio with the decrease of the Si/Al ratio is due to the drop in the observed BAS/Al ratios with the decrease of the Si/Al ratio, as discussed above. The low Ga/Al range of Figure 5a is replotted in Figure 5b; the slope of the TOFAl vs Ga/Al ratios was determined to be 8.2  1.1, 9.0  1.2, and 9.1  2.3 molC3H8·molGa1·h1 for Si/Al ratios of 25, 12, and 5, respectively. The slope represents the TOF of the introduced Ga species. The similar TOFGa on H-CHA with different Si/Al ratios clearly shows that the same type of Ga is formed in H-CHA zeolite regardless of the Si/Al ratio.

Reaction rates were collected at TOS = 21 min. Reaction conditions: 550 C, C3H8 partial pressure 5.07 kPa with balancing N2. The propane conversions are below 6% in the rate measurements.
The impact of extra-framework Al (AlEF) on propane conversion reaction was also examined. Taking H-CHA(5) as an example because it contains more AlEF than H-CHA(12) and H-CHA(25) upon high-temperature treatment (Table 1), we tested the propane dehydrogenation on H-CHA(5) with different pretreatments: 550 C for 30 min and 700 C for 30 min. The results (Table S5) show that after 700 C treatment with H-CHA(5), catalytic rates decrease compared to the treatment at 550 C. By normalizing the reaction rate based on the BAS densities determined by ethylamine-TPD (Table 1), we found that the BAS-normalized reaction rates were comparable to H-CHA(5) with different pretreatments; that is, the reduced reactivity of H-CHA(5) after 700 C treatment is due to the reduction in BAS density. Importantly, the product distribution and apparent activation energy were the same for the H-CHA(5) with different treatments, demonstrating that only BAS catalyzed the propane conversion and that the formed AlEF were not reactive. On the other hand, we observed a similar turn-over-frequency of Ga species (Figure 5) within the Ga/Al range of 00.5 in H-CHA with different Si/Al ratios, which indicates that the catalytic reaction rate is independent of the presence of AlEF species considering that the AlEF species are different on H-CHA with different Si/Al ratios.
Apparent activation energies (Eapp) for the PDH reaction on the reduced catalyst are estimated using an Arrhenius plot in the temperature range of 530570 C (Table 2 and S6). On H-CHA(x), the (Eapp) values of the C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking reactions were 180200 kJ·mol1 (Table 2) and 159174 kJ·mol1, respectively. The lower Eapp for C3H8 cracking is typical for BASs because these sites favor cracking. (48) The Ga-CHA samples have much lower propane dehydrogenation activation energies and higher propane cracking activation energies (Table 2), which is consistent with the enhanced PDH rates and the high C3H6 selectivity on Ga-CHA catalysts. The full product distribution of the PDH reaction was evaluated at different temperatures from 530 to 570 C in Table S6. As the temperature increases from 530 to 570 C, the C3H6 selectivity of H-CHA(x) slightly increases. For example, for H-CHA(25), the C3H6 selectivity increased from 39.9% at 530 C to 46.8% at 570 C. The increased C3H6 selectivity with temperature is consistent with the observation that the measured activation energy of propane dehydrogenation is higher than that of the propane cracking reaction (Table 2) because the increase in reaction temperature can promote the reaction with higher activation energy according to the Arrhenius equation. On Ga-CHA(25, 1.0), the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 95.4% at 530 C to 93.7% at 570 C; however, there is no significant difference in the C3H6 selectivity on Ga-CHA(12, 1.0) and Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) between the temperature range 530and 570 C It is interesting to consider that the apparent activation energy of Ga-CHA(12, 0.5) is lower than that of Ga-CHA(12, 1.0). The same trend is observed when comparing the apparent activation energy of propane dehydrogenation on Ga-CHA(5, 0.5) and Ga-CHA(5, 1.0). Note that the apparent activation energy on Ga-CHA(25, 0.5) is higher than that of Ga-CHA(25, 1.0). The CD3CN-FTIR results (see Figure S13) indicate that: on H-CHA(25), no significant GaOx is introduced as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 1.0; however, a fraction of GaOx oligomers is introduced as the Ga/Al ratio is higher than 0.72 on H-CHA(12) and 0.47 on H-CHA(5). It follows that GaOx oligomers formed at a high Ga/Al ratio led to the increase of apparent activation energy for propane dehydrogenation. Our previous work on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts demonstrated that the introduction of Ga into H-ZSM-5 can decrease the apparent activation energy for propane dehydrogenation due to the formation of active exchanged Ga species, while apparent activation energy increases at a high Ga/Al ratio due to the formation of GaOx oligomers.

Comparison of Extra-Framework Ga+ and In+ Sites in CHA Zeolites for Propane Dehydrogenation
We have reported that extra-framework In+ in CHA is a stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. (45) However, compared with In+ sites in CHA, the Ga+ site exhibits a higher reaction rate and C3H6 selectivity, but significant deactivation. There are important differences between Ga+ and In+ sites in CHA toward propane dehydrogenation (see below).
The turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated over Ga-CHA and In-CHA catalysts at 550 C. As shown in Figures 6a and S34, the TOFGa+ is larger than TOFIn+ by a factor of 43, and the C3H6 selectivity was higher in Ga+ (96%) compared to In+ (88%). This shows that the Ga+ site in CHA has superior propane dehydrogenation activity compared to In+ sites. C3H8-TPSR processes on reduced Ga-CHA and In-CHA show a different propane activation temperature. As shown in Figure 6b, the Ga-CHA catalyst starts to dehydrogenate propane at 380 C, about 100 C lower in temperature than In-CHA (480 C), demonstrating that Ga+ sites are faster propane dehydrogenation catalysts than In+ sites in CHA. More importantly, the evolution of C3H7D (45 amu) and HD (3 amu) during a D2-C3H8-TPSR scrambling experiment (Figure 6c) can be used as another indicator of the CH bond activation of propane. (59)

(d) TPO profiles of spent Ga-CHA and In-CHA catalysts. Reaction conditions: 100 mg, 550 C, TOS = 10 h, C3H8 partial pressure 5.07 kPa with balancing N2.
An approximately 80 C lower temperature was observed on Ga-CHA over In-CHA, indicating that CH bonds are easier to dissociate on Ga+ than In+ sites. These results show that Ga+ has a better intrinsic ability to activate propane than In+ sites.
Not only did we observe differences between Ga+ and In+ in activating propane, but we also found different reactivity with other molecules such as H2 and H2O. Above, we have demonstrated that Ga+ could react with H2 via oxidative addition to form GaHx, while no InHx band was observed (Figure S35) within a wide range of temperatures (50550 C). (45) DFT calculations show the enthalpy change of the formation of InHx to be +73.3 kJ·mol1, which is much higher than that of GaHx (34.0 kJ·mol1). This significant difference in enthalpy change demonstrated that In+ has a lower ability to form hydrides via oxidative addition with H2. Additionally, O2 can oxidize both Ga+ and In+ sites to the +3 oxidation state at 550 C, as determined by the pulse titration experiments (Figure 1) and our previous report; however, water molecules (a soft oxidant) can oxidize Ga+ sites at 550 C but not In+ sites (Figure S36). Therefore, Ga+ is more susceptible to oxidation than In+, or in other words, there is a large thermodynamic preference for the formation of M3+ for Ga vs In. This is likely related to the ability of Ga to activate propane.
TPO experiments on the spent Ga-CHA and In-CHA catalyst (Figure 6d) illustrate additional differences between on Ga+ and In+ sites. A significant amount of CO2 was observed during the TPO on the spent Ga-CHA, but a negligible amount of CO2 was formed on the spent In-CHA catalyst, as expected from results reported by others. (43,44) The faster coke formation rate on the Ga-CHA catalyst compared to In-CHA is consistent with the faster deactivation rate of Ga-CHA in the initial stage of propane dehydrogenation. The formation of hydrocarbon species in Ga-CHA suggests that secondary reactions of propylene are more likely to occur on Ga+ sites than on In+ sites.
Based on the above discussion, we propose that extra-framework Ga+ activates propane by breaking the CH bond through an oxidative addition process by forming [HGa(III)C3H7]+ species (Scheme 1). This step is followed by an H-beta elimination with the formation of an [H2Ga(III)C3H6] intermediate and closed by the desorption of C3H6 and the reductive elimination of H2 to form Ga+ (Scheme 1). The proposed reaction pathway is consistent with that proposed on In+ sites, (45) although the energetics are probably very different. Comparably, Ga+ sites show easier propane activation and a better stabilization of transition states than In+ sites, leading to higher propane dehydrogenation reactivity but faster deactivation rates.

Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
We have investigated Ga speciation on Ga-CHA catalysts and the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation on these catalysts. The Ga2O3 nanoparticles in calcined Ga-CHA catalysts are not completely reduced in H2 until a temperature of 700 C is reached. The ratio between formed H2O during reduction of Ga-CHA at 700 C and the O consumption via subsequent oxidation was 1.5, indicating that Ga2O3 particles are reduced to Ga+ by the hydrogen gas. Combined with in situ FTIR spectroscopy, the consumption of BASs upon reduction and the lack of GaHx at 550 C show that extra-framework Ga+ is formed upon reduction at 700 C. Ga+ was found to react with H2 to form GaHx at 150 C with an enthalpy of formation of GaHx of 51.2 kJ·mol1. This value is consistent with DFT calculations of the same reaction in a molecular cluster of the CHA cage. Ga+ sites in CHA show high initial C3H6 formation rates that decrease rapidly during the first 100 min of TOS and decrease slowly after that point, all while maintaining high C3H6 selectivity at approximately 96%. The parallel in Ga-CHA deactivation and polycyclic aromatics formation rates indicated that the accumulation of polycyclic aromatics is the main cause of deactivation. These carbonaceous species can be easily oxidized at 600 C with complete recovery of catalytic properties. The correlation between GaHx vs Ga/Al ratio and PDH rates vs Ga/Al ratio suggested that extra-framework Ga+ is the active center catalyzing propane dehydrogenation. The higher reaction rate on Ga+ than In+ is the result of the difference in stabilization of the transition state during the oxidative addition of propane to the cation.
