[1] "Ga2O3 nanoparticles in calcined Ga-CHA catalysts are not completely reduced in H2 until a temperature of 700 C is reached."

[2] "The Ga2O3 particles are reduced to Ga+ by the hydrogen gas."

[3] "Ga+ was found to react with H2 to form GaHx at 150 C with an enthalpy of formation of GaHx of 51.2 kJ·mol1."

[4] "The correlation between GaHx vs Ga/Al ratio and PDH rates vs Ga/Al ratio suggested that extra-framework Ga+ is the active center catalyzing propane dehydrogenation."
