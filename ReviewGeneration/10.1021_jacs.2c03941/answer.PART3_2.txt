<quotes>
[1] "In situ transmission FTIR with d3-acetonitrile (CD3CN) as probe molecules at 50 C was employed to monitor the presence of BASs and Lewis acid sites (LASs)." 

[2] "In situ FTIR spectroscopy was employed to monitor the formation of Ga hydride from extra-framework Ga+ sites with H2."

[3] "The reduction of the Ga-CHA catalyst and subsequent oxidation experiments were used to determine the oxidation state of Ga in reduced Ga-CHA samples in a customized pulse reactor."

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques including in-situ FTIR spectroscopy, pulse titrations, and temperature programmed reactions to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, in-situ FTIR with CD3CN probed Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, in-situ FTIR monitored Ga-hydride formation, and pulse titrations determined Ga oxidation states after reaction.
