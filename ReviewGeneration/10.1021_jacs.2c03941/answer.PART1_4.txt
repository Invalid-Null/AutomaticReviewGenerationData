<quotes>
[1] "We propose that extra-framework Ga+ activates propane by breaking the CH bond through an oxidative addition process by forming [HGa(III)C3H7]+ species. This step is followed by an H-beta elimination with the formation of an [H2Ga(III)C3H6] intermediate and closed by the desorption of C3H6 and the reductive elimination of H2 to form Ga+."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic reaction pathway for propane dehydrogenation over extra-framework Ga+ sites, involving oxidative addition to break a C-H bond and form a [HGa(III)C3H7]+ intermediate, followed by H-beta elimination to form [H2Ga(III)C3H6], and finally reductive elimination of H2 with desorption of propylene to regenerate the Ga+ site.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 文章提出了一个丙烷在额外框架Ga+位点上的机理反应途径,首先经过氧化加成断裂一个C-H键并形成一个[HGa(III)C3H7]+中间体,接着经过H-beta消除形成[H2Ga(III)C3H6],最后经过H2的还原消除和丙烯的解吸再生Ga+位点。

<English version answer>  
Answer: The literature does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts, as it does not study supported metal catalysts.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 文献没有研究诸如金属颗粒大小、形状和与支撑体相互作用等性质如何影响负载金属催化剂的性能,因为它没有研究负载金属催化剂。
