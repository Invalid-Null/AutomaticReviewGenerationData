答:该文没有评估任何类似Cr2O3、Pt-Sn、Ga2O3等有前景的金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] Ga2O3 particles are observed on Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) on the zeolite surface (Figure S3), due to the relatively large amount of Ga loading, in agreement with the observation of mesopores associated with Ga2O3 on the N2 adsorption isotherms of Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) (Figure S5c). 

[2] The large Ga2O3 particles disappeared upon reduction of the samples, showing that Ga2O3 was reduced and formed highly dispersed species (below we show that extra-framework Ga species are formed).

[3] The decreased micropore volumes of reduced Ga-CHA(x, 1.0) compared with H-CHA(x) show that Ga2O3 particles on the external surface, upon reduction, moved into the micropore of the zeolite (Table S1).

[4] The Ga-CHA catalysts were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation on H-CHA zeolite followed by drying and calcination.

[5]  Ga2O3 diffraction peaks were not observed for Ga-CHA samples (Figure S2), which indicated that Ga2O3 is highly dispersed and formed in an insufficient amount to generate an XRD pattern.

[6] As a benchmark, a PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation. (50) As shown in Figure S32, the PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst showed a high initial C3H6 yield (29%) and deactivated quickly within 5 h of TOS; the C3H6 yield decreased slowly in the following 40 h. The C3H6 selectivity decreased from 99 to 96% within 40 h on stream. Although Ga-CHA shows a somewhat lower reaction rate compared with PtSn/γ-Al2O3 (Figures 4a and S32), the high and stable propylene selectivity makes Ga-CHA a good candidate for propane dehydrogenation.

Answer: The article investigates Ga2O3 as a catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Ga2O3 particles are observed on the zeolite surface of Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) due to the relatively large amount of Ga loading. These particles are reduced and form highly dispersed extra-framework Ga species upon reduction, as evidenced by the decreased micropore volumes compared to the parent zeolite H-CHA(x). The Ga2O3 is introduced via incipient wetness impregnation and is highly dispersed based on the lack of XRD peaks. As a benchmark, PtSn/γ-Al2O3 showed high initial activity but faster deactivation compared to Ga-CHA, suggesting Ga-CHA is a good candidate despite the lower reaction rate.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:该文研究了Ga2O3作为丙烷脱氢催化剂。由于Ga负载量较大,Ga-CHA(5,1.0)的沸石表面观察到了Ga2O3颗粒。这些颗粒在还原后形成高度分散的外框架Ga种,这可以从与母体沸石H-CHA(x)相比孔容积的减少得出。Ga2O3是通过浸渍湿法引入的,基于XRD谱图中没有峰表示Ga2O3高度分散。作为基准,PtSn/γ-Al2O3虽然显示了较高的初始活性,但脱活更快 compared to Ga-CHA,提示尽管反应率较低,Ga-CHA仍是一个不错的候选催化剂。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] The ratio between formed H2O during the reduction process and oxygen consumed was close to 1.5, confirming that Ga2O3 in calcined samples is reduced to Ga+ by stoichiometry Ga2O3 + 2 H+Z + 2 H2 → 2 Ga+Z + 3 H2O, in agreement with previous studies. (32,39) 

[2] The CD3CN-FTIR spectrum of Ga-CHA(12, 1.0) without reduction is the same as that of parent H-CHA(12) (Figure S11), indicating that the BAS was not replaced by Ga species before reduction. This also evidences that the initial Ga phase is Ga2O3 on CHA with a Si/Al ratio of 12. Upon reduction, the peak intensity near 2324 cm-1 (LAS) grows significantly, and the BAS peak almost disappears, suggesting that the BAS was largely displaced by Ga species upon the initial reduction of Ga-CHA catalysts.

[3] Interestingly, on CHA with a Si/Al ratio of 5, the ratio of formed H2O to oxygen consumed is slightly lower than 1.5 (between 1.0 and 1.5). It is possible that in this sample, a fraction of the gallium oxide was exchanged with the BAS during the impregnation process or dehydration process to form [GaO]+, possibly because H-CHA(5) contains a higher BAS density (Table 1) and a smaller crystal size than H-CHA(12) and H-CHA(25) zeolites. [GaO]+ was reduced to Ga+ as described by the reaction: [GaO]+Z + H2 → 2 Ga+Z + H2O, resulting in a ratio of formed H2O to consumed oxygen of 1.0. Therefore, the slightly lower ratio of formed H2O to oxygen consumed on Ga-CHA(5, y) is the result of the additive effect of the reduction of Ga2O3 and [GaO]+.

[4] Combined with in situ FTIR spectroscopy, the consumption of BASs upon reduction and the lack of GaHx at 550 °C show that extra-framework Ga+ is formed upon reduction at 700 °C. 

[5] Ga+ was found to react with H2 to form GaHx at 150 °C with an enthalpy of formation of GaHx of 51.2 kJ·mol-1. This value is consistent with DFT calculations of the same reaction in a molecular cluster of the CHA cage.

[6] The correlation between GaHx vs Ga/Al ratio and PDH rates vs Ga/Al ratio suggested that extra-framework Ga+ is the active center catalyzing propane dehydrogenation.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how the oxidation state of gallium affects propane dehydrogenation performance. The ratio of formed H2O to consumed O2 during reduction and subsequent oxidation of Ga-CHA matches the stoichiometry of reducing Ga2O3 to Ga+. FTIR shows the BAS is displaced upon reduction, indicating formation of Ga+ species. The slightly lower H2O/O2 ratio on Ga-CHA(5) suggests partial exchange of GaO+ with BAS during impregnation. Combined FTIR and reactivity data indicate extra-framework Ga+ formed upon reduction at 700°C is the active site. Ga+ reacts with H2 to form GaHx at 150°C, consistent with DFT calculations. The correlation of GaHx and PDH rates with Ga/Al ratio confirms Ga+ catalyzes propane dehydrogenation.

<Chinese version answer>
答:该文研究了镓的氧化态如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。Ga-CHA还原和后续氧化过程中形成的H2O与消耗的O2的比值与将Ga2O3还原为Ga+的化学计量匹配。FTIR表明BAS在还原后被取代,提示形成了Ga+种。Ga-CHA(5)上略低的H2O/O2比值暗示在浸渍过程中部分GaO+与BAS交换。结合FTIR和反应活性数据表明,在700°C还原后形成的外框架Ga+是活性中心。Ga+与H2 在150°C反应生成GaHx,与DFT计算一致。GaHx和PDH速率与Ga/Al比值的相关性证实了Ga+催化丙烷脱氢反应。
