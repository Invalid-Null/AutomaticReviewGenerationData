<quotes>
[1] The Ga2O3 nanoparticles in calcined Ga-CHA catalysts are not completely reduced in H2 until a temperature of 700 C is reached. The ratio between formed H2O during reduction of Ga-CHA at 700 C and the O consumption via subsequent oxidation was 1.5, indicating that Ga2O3 particles are reduced to Ga+ by the hydrogen gas.
[2] Combined with in situ FTIR spectroscopy, the consumption of BASs upon reduction and the lack of GaHx at 550 C show that extra-framework Ga+ is formed upon reduction at 700 C.

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates methods to synthesize isolated Ga+ sites in the zeolite CHA framework. It shows that calcined Ga-CHA needs to be reduced at 700°C in H2 to fully reduce dispersed Ga2O3 particles to isolated Ga+ sites, as evidenced by H2O formation and O2 titration experiments. In situ FTIR confirms the exclusive presence of extra-framework Ga+ sites upon high temperature reduction, without Ga hydride species.

答:这篇文章研究了在CHA分子筛框架中合成隔离Ga+位点的方法。它显示,煅烧的Ga-CHA需要在700°C的H2气流中还原,以充分还原Ga2O3颗粒为隔离的Ga+位点,这是通过H2O的形成和O2滴定实验证明的。原位Fourier变换红外光谱证实,在高温还原后仅存在框架外Ga+位点,没有Ga氢化物种。

[1] The Ga2O3 diffraction peaks were not observed for Ga-CHA samples (Figure S2), which indicated that Ga2O3 is highly dispersed and formed in an insufficient amount to generate an XRD pattern. 
[2] Ga2O3 particles were observed on Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) on the zeolite surface (Figure S3), due to the relatively large amount of Ga loading, in agreement with the observation of mesopores associated with Ga2O3 on the N2 adsorption isotherms of Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) (Figure S5c). The large Ga2O3 particles disappeared upon reduction of the samples, showing that Ga2O3 was reduced and formed highly dispersed species (below we show that extra-framework Ga species are formed). The decreased micropore volumes of reduced Ga-CHA(x, 1.0) compared with H-CHA(x) show that Ga2O3 particles on the external surface, upon reduction, moved into the micropore of the zeolite (Table S1).

<English version answer>
Answer: The article discusses catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It shows that at low Ga loadings, no Ga2O3 diffraction peaks are observed by XRD, indicating high dispersion. At higher loadings like Ga/Al=1, some larger Ga2O3 particles form on the external zeolite surface, but reduction treatment disperses these into the zeolite pores, as evidenced by pore volume changes.

<Chinese version answer>
答:这篇文章讨论了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它显示,在低Ga载量时,XRD没有观察到Ga2O3衍射峰,表明高分散性。在更高的载量如Ga/Al=1时,一些较大的Ga2O3颗粒形成在外表面,但还原处理使这些颗粒分散到分子筛孔内,这是通过孔容变化证明的。

[1] The reduction of calcined Ga-CHA catalysts and subsequent oxidation experiments were used to determine the oxidation state of Ga in reduced Ga-CHA samples in a customized pulse reactor (see Figure S1).
[2] In situ FTIR spectroscopy was employed to monitor the formation of Ga hydride from extra-framework Ga+ sites with H2.  
[3] In situ FTIR spectroscopy was employed to monitor the formation of Ga hydride from extra-framework Ga+ sites with H2. The examination of the ability of Ga+ sites to form Ga hydride is essential to characterize the Ga speciation and understand their propane dehydrogenation abilities.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques including pulse titration and FTIR spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Pulse titration with H2 reduction and O2 oxidation is used to determine Ga oxidation state changes during catalysis. In-situ FTIR with H2 probes the ability of Ga+ sites to form hydride species, which provides insights into the Ga speciation and propane activation mechanism.
