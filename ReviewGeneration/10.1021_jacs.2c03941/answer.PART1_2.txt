</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] The Ga2O3 nanoparticles in calcined Ga-CHA catalysts are not completely reduced in H2 until a temperature of 700 C is reached. 
[2] Ga2O3 particles are reduced to Ga+ by the hydrogen gas.
[3] The consumption of BASs upon reduction and the lack of GaHx at 550 C show that extra-framework Ga+ is formed upon reduction at 700 C.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how the oxidation state of gallium affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It finds that Ga2O3 nanoparticles are reduced to Ga+ sites at 700C, and these Ga+ sites are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation.

<quotes>
[1] Ga+ was found to react with H2 to form GaHx at 150 C with an enthalpy of formation of GaHx of 51.2 kJ·mol1.
[2] The higher reaction rate on Ga+ than In+ is the result of the difference in stabilization of the transition state during the oxidative addition of propane to the cation.
[3] Ga+ activates propane by breaking the CH bond through an oxidative addition process by forming [HGa(III)C3H7]+ species. This step is followed by an H-beta elimination with the formation of an [H2Ga(III)C3H6] intermediate and closed by the desorption of C3H6 and the reductive elimination of H2 to form Ga+.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic pathway for propane dehydrogenation over Ga+ sites. It suggests Ga+ activates propane by oxidative addition to form [HGa(III)C3H7]+, followed by H-beta elimination to give [H2Ga(III)C3H6], and completed by C3H6 desorption and H2 reductive elimination to regenerate Ga+. The difference in transition state stabilization for oxidative addition leads to higher activity on Ga+ versus In+.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:这篇文章提出了Ga+位点上丙烷脱氢反应的机理途径。它认为Ga+通过氧化加成激活丙烷形成[HGa(III)C3H7]+,随后通过H-β消除生成[H2Ga(III)C3H6],最后C3H6解吸和H2还原消除再生Ga+。Ga+和In+在氧化加成过渡态稳定性上的差异导致Ga+活性更高。
