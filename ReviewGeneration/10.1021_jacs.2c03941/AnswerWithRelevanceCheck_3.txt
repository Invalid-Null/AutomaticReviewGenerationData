      [1] Ga2O3 particles are observed on Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) on the zeolite surface (Figure S3), due to the relatively large amount of Ga loading, in agreement with the observation of mesopores associated with Ga2O3 on the N2 adsorption isotherms of Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) (Figure S5c).

      [2] The large Ga2O3 particles disappeared upon reduction of the samples, showing that Ga2O3 was reduced and formed highly dispersed species (below we show that extra-framework Ga species are formed).

      [3] The decreased micropore volumes of reduced Ga-CHA(x, 1.0) compared with H-CHA(x) show that Ga2O3 particles on the external surface, upon reduction, moved into the micropore of the zeolite (Table S1).

      [4] The Ga-CHA catalysts were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation on H-CHA zeolite followed by drying and calcination.

      [5] Ga2O3 diffraction peaks were not observed for Ga-CHA samples (Figure S2), which indicated that Ga2O3 is highly dispersed and formed in an insufficient amount to generate an XRD pattern.
      
      [6] As a benchmark, a PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation. (50) As shown in Figure S32, the PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst showed a high initial C3H6 yield (29%) and deactivated quickly within 5 h of TOS; the C3H6 yield decreased slowly in the following 40 h. The C3H6 selectivity decreased from 99 to 96% within 40 h on stream. Although Ga-CHA shows a somewhat lower reaction rate compared with PtSn/γ-Al2O3 (Figures 4a and S32), the high and stable propylene selectivity makes Ga-CHA a good candidate for propane dehydrogenation.

      Answer: The article investigates Ga2O3 as a catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Ga2O3 particles are observed on the zeolite surface of Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) due to the relatively large amount of Ga loading. These particles are reduced and form highly dispersed extra-framework Ga species upon reduction, as evidenced by the decreased micropore volumes compared to the parent zeolite H-CHA(x). The Ga2O3 is introduced via incipient wetness impregnation and is highly dispersed based on the lack of XRD peaks. As a benchmark, PtSn/γ-Al2O3 showed high initial activity but faster deactivation compared to Ga-CHA, suggesting Ga-CHA is a good candidate despite the lower reaction rate.

      答:该文研究了Ga2O3作为丙烷脱氢催化剂。由于Ga负载量较大,Ga-CHA(5,1.0)的沸石表面观察到了Ga2O3颗粒。这些颗粒在还原后形成高度分散的外框架Ga种,这可以从与母体沸石H-CHA(x)相比孔容积的减少得出。Ga2O3是通过浸渍湿法引入的,基于XRD谱图中没有峰表示Ga2O3高度分散。作为基准,PtSn/γ-Al2O3虽然显示了较高的初始活性,但脱活更快 compared to Ga-CHA,提示尽管反应率较低,Ga-CHA仍是一个不错的候选催化剂。

      [1] Ga+ was found to react with H2 to form GaHx at 150 °C with an enthalpy of formation of GaHx of 51.2 kJ·mol-1. This value is consistent with DFT calculations of the same reaction in a molecular cluster of the CHA cage.

      [2] The correlation between GaHx vs Ga/Al ratio and PDH rates vs Ga/Al ratio suggested that extra-framework Ga+ is the active center catalyzing propane dehydrogenation.

      Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic pathway for propane dehydrogenation over extra-framework Ga+ sites in CHA zeolite. It describes the following reaction steps: Ga+ activates propane by oxidative addition to form [HGa(III)C3H7]+, followed by H-beta elimination to form [H2Ga(III)C3H6], and finally C3H6 desorbs and H2 undergoes reductive elimination to regenerate Ga+. The proposed intermediates are [HGa(III)C3H7]+ and [H2Ga(III)C3H6], and the active site is extra-framework Ga+.

      答:该文为CHA分子筛中的额�框架Ga+位点的丙烷脱氢反应提出了一种机理场景。它描述了以下反应步骤:Ga+通过氧化加成激活丙烷形成[HGa(III)C3H7]+,随后发生H-β消除反应形成[H2Ga(III)C3H6],最后C3H6解离,H2发生还原消除重新生成Ga+。提出的中间产物是[HGa(III)C3H7]+和[H2Ga(III)C3H6],活性位点是额外框架Ga+。
