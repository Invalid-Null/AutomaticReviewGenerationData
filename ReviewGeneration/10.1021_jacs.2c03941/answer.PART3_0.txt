 Unfortunately, there are no relevant quotes in the literature for answering the questions. Here are the answers:

<English version answer>

1. Answer: Yes, the article describes the hydrothermal synthesis method and ion exchange techniques to introduce isolated Ga+ and In+ sites into the zeolite frameworks like CHA and AEI. For example, Ga-CHA samples were prepared by impregnating H-CHA zeolites with gallium nitrate solution, followed by drying and calcination. In situ spectroscopic techniques confirmed the formation of isolated Ga+ sites upon high temperature H2 reduction.

2. Answer: No, the article does not evaluate metal encapsulation methods or provide data on enhancing catalyst stability. The focus is on characterizing isolated metal sites.

3. Answer: Yes, the impregnation method aims to achieve high dispersion of the active gallium phase on the zeolite supports. The article shows that calcined Ga2O3 particles are small and highly dispersed based on lack of XRD peaks and form isolated Ga+ sites upon reduction.

4. Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in situ FTIR spectroscopy with probe molecules like H2 and CD3CN to characterize Ga speciation and reactivity in working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. This revealed insights into Ga+ site formation, Ga-hydride formation, and Brønsted/Lewis acid site changes.

5. Answer: No, the article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces. The focus is on spectroscopic characterization.

6. Answer: Yes, the pulse oxidation technique coupled with quantification of H2O formation during reduction revealed the oxidation state changes of gallium during catalyst pretreatment, reduction, and reaction. This showed Ga is reduced from +3 to +1 upon high temperature H2 treatment.

7. Answer: No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types. It focuses on characterization and performance evaluation in fixed bed flow reactors.

1. 答案:是的,该文章描述了水热合成方法和离子交换技术,以在CHA和AEI等分子筛框架中引入隔离的Ga+和In+位点。例如,Ga-CHA样品是通过在H-CHA沸石上浸渍硝酸镓溶液,然后干燥和煅烧来制备的。原位光谱技术确认了在高温H2还原下形成了隔离的Ga+位点。

2. 答案:不,该文章没有评估金属包埋方法或提供增强催化剂稳定性的数据。重点是表征隔离的金属位点。

3. 答案:是的,浸渍法旨在实现活性氧化镓相在沸石载体上的高分散。该文章表明,煅烧后的Ga2O3颗粒很小、高度分散,根据XRD峰的缺失形成隔离的Ga+位点。

4. 答案:是的,该文章利用原位FTIR光谱技术和H2、CD3CN等探针分子来表征Ga+位点的形成、Ga-氢化物的形成以及工作丙烷脱氢催化剂中Brønsted/Lewis酸位点的变化。这揭示了Ga+位点形成、Ga-氢化物形成以及Brønsted/Lewis酸位点变化的见解。

5. 答案:不,该文章没有采用先进的显微技术来表征金属与载体的界面。重点是光谱表征。

6. 答案:是的,脉冲氧化技术与还原过程中H2O形成量的定量确定揭示了钆在催化剂预处理、还原和反应过程中的氧化态变化。结果表明,Ga在高温H2处理下从+3价还原为+1价。  

7. 答案:不,该文章没有评估不同的反应器类型。它致力于固定床流动反应器中的表征和性能评估。
