        [1] Tin is a well-known promoter of Pt group metals that has been studied in a wide variety of reactions [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27].
        
        [2] For example, the addition of Sn to Pt propane dehydrogenation catalysts increased selectivity to propene while decreasing catalyst deactivation due to coke formation [5], [7], [8], [28], [29], [30].
        
        [3] Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts exhibited a decrease in H2 and CO uptake as the Sn content increased.
        
        [4] Addition of Sn to Pt propane dehydrogenation catalysts increased selectivity to propene while decreasing catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.
        
        [5] The promotional role of Sn on Pt catalysts has been attributed to both electronic and geometric effects.
        
        [6] Computational modeling has suggested Pt-Sn alloys can improve the stability of propane dehydrogenation activity while decreasing the catalyst activity by increasing the barrier for dissociative adsorption of propane.
        
        [7] The trend in the normalized rate of propane conversion over SiO2-supported catalysts supports the idea that Pt-Sn alloy formation improves stability while decreasing activity.

        Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing that adding Sn to Pt increases propene selectivity and decreases catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Computational studies suggest Pt-Sn alloys increase dehydrogenation stability but decrease activity by increasing the propane dissociation barrier. Experimental rate data supports this trade-off between stability and activity with increasing Sn content in Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts. No other Pt alloy catalysts are evaluated.

        是的,该文献评估了Pt-Sn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供了数据,显示在Pt中添加Sn可以增加丙烯的选择性,并降低催化剂因焦炭形成而失活。计算研究表明Pt-Sn合金提高了脱氢稳定性,但通过增加丙烷解离势垒降低了活性。随着SiO2支持的Pt-Sn催化剂中Sn含量的增加,实验反应速率数据支持了稳定性和活性之间的这种权衡关系。没有评估其他Pt合金催化剂。

         [1] Electronic promotion is proposed to occur by the donation of electronic charge from Sn to Pt, which decreases the heat of ethene [32], [34] and propene [31] adsorption as well as increases the barrier for dissociative adsorption of light alkanes [31], which is postulated to be the rate determining step for the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt [2], [5], [35], [36], [37]. 

         [2] The geometric effect of adding Sn to Pt results from the dilution of Pt ensembles. Large ensembles of Pt surface atoms are required for some undesired side reactions including deep dehydrogenation, which leads to coke formation, and hydrogenolysis. Thus, surface dilution of Pt ensembles is thought to enhance selectivity to propene during propane dehydrogenation while decreasing coke formation [2], [4], [28], [29], [30], [32], [37].

         Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Sn in the Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts. It explains that Sn can donate electronic charge to Pt, decreasing ethene and propene adsorption energies. Geometrically, Sn dilutes the Pt surface ensembles, limiting side reactions like deep dehydrogenation and coke formation, thus enhancing propene selectivity.

         是的,该文献研究了Pt-Sn双金属催化剂中辅助金属Sn的电子效应和几何效应。它解释说,Sn可以向Pt提供电子,减少乙烯和丙烯的吸附能。从几何结构上看,Sn稀释了Pt表面配位,限制了深度脱氢和焦炭生成等副反应,因此提高了丙烯选择性。

       Yes, the article describes synergistic effects between Pt and Sn in the bimetallic catalysts, attributed to ensemble and ligand effects. It shows Sn improves propene selectivity while reducing coking, explained by computational studies suggesting Pt-Sn alloys increase dehydrogenation stability but decrease activity. The experimental data supports this synergistic trade-off between stability and activity when adding Sn to Pt.

       是的,该文献描述了Pt和Sn之间在双金属催化剂中的协同效应,这被归因于配体效应和集团效应。它显示Sn提高了丙烯选择性而减少了焦化,计算研究结果解释说Pt-Sn合金提高了脱氢稳定性但降低了活性。实验数据支持了在Pt中加入Sn时稳定性和活性之间这种协同作用中的权衡关系。
