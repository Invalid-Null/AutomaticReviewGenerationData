[1] The relative amount of coke formed on each catalyst also decreased with increasing Sn content. 
[2] Electronic promotion is proposed to occur by the donation of electronic charge from Sn to Pt, which decreases the heat of ethene adsorption as well as increases the barrier for dissociative adsorption of light alkanes.

[1] The presence of Sn atoms has also been suggested to improve the regeneration of deactivated Pt/Al2O3 by acting as nucleation sites for mobilized Pt atoms during oxidative treatments [4], [30], [38], [39].

[2] Electronic promotion is proposed to occur by the donation of electronic charge from Sn to Pt, which decreases the heat of ethene [32], [34] and propene [31] adsorption as well as increases the barrier for dissociative adsorption of light alkanes [31], which is postulated to be the rate determining step for the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt [2], [5], [35], [36], [37]. 

[3] The geometric effect of adding Sn to Pt results from the dilution of Pt ensembles. Large ensembles of Pt surface atoms are required for some undesired side reactions including deep dehydrogenation, which leads to coke formation, and hydrogenolysis.

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Sn in Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts. It states that Sn donates electronic charge to Pt, decreasing the adsorption heat of alkenes like ethene and propene, and increasing the barrier for alkane dissociative adsorption, which is the rate limiting step. It also dilutes the Pt ensembles required for deep dehydrogenation and coke formation.

[1] Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts exhibited a decrease in H2 and CO uptake as the Sn content increased.  
[2] Addition of Sn to Pt propane dehydrogenation catalysts increased selectivity to propene while decreasing catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.
[3] The promotional role of Sn on Pt catalysts has been attributed to both electronic and geometric effects.
[4] Computational modeling has suggested Pt-Sn alloys can improve the stability of propane dehydrogenation activity while decreasing the catalyst activity by increasing the barrier for dissociative adsorption of propane.
[5] The trend in the normalized rate of propane conversion over SiO2-supported catalysts supports the idea that Pt-Sn alloy formation improves stability while decreasing activity.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Sn promotion decreases H2 and CO chemisorption uptake and increases propene selectivity while reducing coke formation and catalyst deactivation. The electronic and geometric effects of Sn are discussed, with computational studies suggesting Pt-Sn alloys increase dehydrogenation stability but decrease activity by increasing the propane dissociation barrier. Experimental rate data supports this trade-off between stability and activity with increasing Sn content in Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文献评估了Pt-Sn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供了数据,显示Sn促进剂降低了H2和CO化学吸附量,增加了丙烯选择性,同时减少了焦炭生成和催化剂失活。文中讨论了Sn的电子效应和几何效应,计算研究表明Pt-Sn合金提高了脱氢稳定性,但通过增加丙烷解离势垒降低了活性。随着SiO2支持的Pt-Sn催化剂中Sn含量的增加,实验反应速率数据支持了稳定性和活性之间的这种权衡关系。

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Sn in the Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts. It explains that Sn can donate electronic charge to Pt, decreasing ethene and propene adsorption energies. Geometrically, Sn dilutes the Pt surface ensembles, which are required for deep dehydrogenation and coke formation. Diluting these sites enhances propene selectivity and reduces coking.

<Chinese version answer> 
答:是的,该文献研究了Pt-Sn双金属催化剂中辅助金属Sn的电子效应和几何效应。它解释说,Sn可以向Pt提供电子,减少乙烯和丙烯的吸附能。从几何结构上看,Sn稀释了Pt表面配位,这些配位对深度脱氢和焦炭生成是必需的。稀释这些位点可以增强丙烯选择性并减少焦化。
