[1] "The conversion of light alkanes to olefins is known to be inhibited by dehydrogenation reaction products [2], [5], [29], [35], [36], [37], [60], [61]."

[2] "In contrast to the SiO2-supported catalysts, oxidative regeneration of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 was successful without substantial loss of activity."

[3] "The widely utilized Oleflex industrial propane dehydrogenation process is known to utilize a Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst system [2]." 

[4] "Regeneration of all three of the examined Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts resulted in recovery of the catalytic activity as well as redispersion of Pt-Sn nanoparticles (Table 3, Table 6)."

5. Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on conversion, selectivity, stability, and deactivation rates for Pt/SiO2 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The article notes that propane dehydrogenation is inhibited by reaction products over Pt catalysts. It also shows Pt/Al2O3 can be successfully regenerated without substantial activity loss, and that Pt-Sn/Al2O3 is used industrially, with the Sn promoter aiding regeneration.

5. 是的,文章评估了支持单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供了Pt/SiO2和Pt/Al2O3催化剂的转换率、选择性、稳定性和失活率的数据。文章指出丙烷脱氢在Pt催化剂上会被反应产物抑制。它还显示Pt/Al2O3可以成功地在不损失大量活性的情况下再生,且Pt-Sn/Al2O3在工业上被使用,其中Sn促进剂有助于再生。

[1] "The relative amount of coke formed on each catalyst also decreased with increasing Sn content." 

[2] "In contrast to the alumina-supported catalysts, oxidative regeneration of SiO2-supported catalysts caused irreversible loss of activity attributed to the segregation of SnOx species to the surfaces of the bimetallic particles."

[3] "Regeneration of all three of the examined Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts resulted in recovery of the catalytic activity as well as redispersion of Pt-Sn nanoparticles (Table 3, Table 6)." 

[4] "This suggests that a major role of Sn promoters on alumina is to act as nucleation sites for the redispersion of Pt during oxidative regeneration [4]."

<English version answer>
6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts. It shows Sn promotion decreases coke formation, but irreversibly deactivates Pt-Sn/SiO2 during regeneration due to SnOx segregation. In contrast, Sn aids regeneration of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 by acting as nucleation sites for Pt redispersion.
</English version answer>

6. 是的,文章研究了诸如金属颗粒大小、形状和支持体相互作用等性质如何影响支持的Pt和Pt-Sn催化剂的性能。它显示Sn促剂减少焦炭形成,但在再生过程中会使Pt-Sn/SiO2不可逆地失活,因为SnOx发生了聚集。相比之下,Sn通过作为Pt重新分散的核化位点,有助于Pt-Sn/Al2O3的再生。
