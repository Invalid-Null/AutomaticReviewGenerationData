<Answer>

 Unfortunately this document does not provide sufficient information to directly answer the specific questions asked. The document focuses on evaluating the catalytic performance of Pt and Pt-Sn nanoparticles supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It does not provide extensive background on the broader significance and applications of propylene production, details of propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and kinetics, or computational modeling and structure-activity relationships.
