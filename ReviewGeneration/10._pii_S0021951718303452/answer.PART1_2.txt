<quotes>
[1] "The addition of Sn to Pt propane dehydrogenation catalysts increased selectivity to propene while decreasing catalyst deactivation due to coke formation [5], [7], [8], [28], [29], [30]."

[2] "Supported Pt catalysts in particular are highly active for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, including the conversion of propane to propene."

[3] "Pt is therefore typically promoted by a second metal such as Ga [9], Cu [10], Zn [11], [12], and Sn [2], [5]."

[4] "The promotional role of Sn on Pt catalysts has been attributed to both electronic and geometric effects [2], [5], [31], [32], [33], [34]." 

[5] "Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized by IWI using H2PtCl6·6H2O and SnCl2 precursors and the mixed phase Al2O3 support."

[6] "The Pt and Sn precursors were co-impregnated in an HCl solution utilizing the same dilution and HCl:SnCl2 molar ratio as the bimetallic SiO2-supported catalysts." 

[7] "The bimetallic samples were subsequently treated in air and H2 following the same protocol used to prepare monometallic Pt/Al2O3."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It states that supported Pt catalysts are highly active for dehydrogenation of light alkanes including propane to propene (Quote 2). Pt is typically promoted by metals like Sn, Ga, Cu, Zn to improve selectivity and limit deactivation from coke formation (Quote 1, 3). The article synthesizes mono-metallic Pt and bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 via incipient wetness impregnation using H2PtCl6 and SnCl2 precursors (Quote 5-7). The role of Sn promoter is attributed to electronic and geometric effects (Quote 4).

答:是的,这篇文章评估了SUPPORTED单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它指出SUPPORTED的Pt催化剂对轻烷烃包括丙烷到丙烯的脱氢高活性(引文2)。Pt通常被Sn、Ga、Cu、Zn等金属掺杂以提高选择性并限制焦炭形成导致的失活(引文1,3)。文章通过渗透法合成了SUPPORTED在SiO2和Al2O3上的单金属Pt和双金属Pt-Sn催化剂,使用H2PtCl6和SnCl2前驱体(引文5-7)。Sn掺杂剂的作用被归因于电子效应和几何效应(引文4)。

[1] "Particle size is known to influence catalyst stability and product selectivity for monometallic Pt catalysts [47], [48] and bimetallic PtSn catalysts [32]." 

[2] "Smaller Pt nanoparticles possess more steps and kinks, which dominate the activity on smaller particles [48], bind propene more strongly and can lead to the formation of deep dehydrogenation products during propane dehydrogenation [31]."

[3] "A narrow particle size distribution for the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts can be achieved using colloidal synthesis techniques [15], [32], [49], [50], [51], [52]." 

[4] "Increasing the atomic Sn content from 97:3 (Pt:Sn) to 75:25 has been shown to increase the content of Pt3Sn alloy as evidenced by powder X-ray diffraction [52]."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts. It states that particle size influences stability and selectivity of mono-metallic Pt and bi-metallic Pt-Sn catalysts (Quote 1). Smaller Pt particles with more steps/kinks bind propene more strongly leading to deep dehydrogenation products (Quote 2). Narrow particle size distribution can be achieved using colloidal synthesis (Quote 3). Increasing Sn content from 3% to 25% increases Pt3Sn alloy content evidenced by XRD (Quote 4).

答:是的,这篇文章研究了像金属颗粒大小、形状和载体相互作用等属性如何影响SUPPORTED金属催化剂的性能。它指出颗粒大小会影响单金属Pt和双金属Pt-Sn催化剂的稳定性和选择性(引文1)。较小的Pt颗粒具有更多台阶和切口,这会强烈地吸附丙烯并导致深度脱氢产物的形成(引文2)。使用胶体合成技术可以获得窄颗粒大小分布(引文3)。Sn含量从3%增加到25%会增加Pt3Sn合金含量,XRD证明了这一点(引文4)。
