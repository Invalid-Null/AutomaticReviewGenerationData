<quotes>
[1] "Improvements to fracking technology have increased the availability of natural gas and natural gas liquids thus decreasing the cost of chemicals production [1]."

[2] "Supported Pt catalysts in particular are highly active for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, including the conversion of propane to propene."  

[3] "Pt is therefore typically promoted by a second metal such as Ga [9], Cu [10], Zn [11], [12], and Sn [2], [5]."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
5. The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It notes that Pt catalysts are highly active but tend to catalyze undesired side reactions, so Pt is often promoted by metals like Ga, Cu, Zn, and Sn.    
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
5. 该文评估了单金属Pt支持催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。文中指出Pt催化剂活性很高,但倾向于催化不需要的副反应,因此Pt通常被Ga、Cu、Zn和Sn等金属推动。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "Particle size is known to influence catalyst stability and product selectivity for monometallic Pt catalysts [47], [48] and bimetallic PtSn catalysts [32]." 

[2] "Step sites on monometallic Pt catalysts, which dominate the activity on smaller particles [48], bind propene more strongly and can lead to the formation of deep dehydrogenation products during propane dehydrogenation [31]."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
6. The article investigates how properties like metal particle size and support interactions affect the performance of supported Pt catalysts. It finds that smaller Pt particles have more step sites, which bind propene more strongly and can lead to deep dehydrogenation products.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 
6. 该文研究了诸如金属颗粒大小和担体相互作用等性质如何影响Pt支持催化剂的性能。它发现较小的Pt颗粒具有更多的阶梯位,这些位点会更强地结合丙烯,可能导致深度脱氢产物的形成。
