      [1] "In the present study, the influences of support (SiO2 versus Al2O3), synthesis method (impregnation versus colloidal synthesis) and Sn loading on the performance of Sn-promoted Pt nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation at 773K were explored."

      [2] "Advanced synthesis techniques have been employed recently to produce a narrow size distribution of nanoparticles as well as specific Pt:Sn ratios within those nanoparticles." 

      [3] "The metal particle size of fresh samples and catalysts that had been subjected to 24h of propane dehydrogenation at 773K are summarized in Table 3."
