[1] Tin is a well-known promoter of Pt group metals that has been studied in a wide variety of reactions [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. 

[2] For example, the addition of Sn to Pt propane dehydrogenation catalysts increased selectivity to propene while decreasing catalyst deactivation due to coke formation [5], [7], [8], [28], [29], [30].

[1] Electronic promotion is proposed to occur by the donation of electronic charge from Sn to Pt, which decreases the heat of ethene [32], [34] and propene [31] adsorption as well as increases the barrier for dissociative adsorption of light alkanes [31], which is postulated to be the rate determining step for the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt [2], [5], [35], [36], [37].

[2] The geometric effect of adding Sn to Pt results from the dilution of Pt ensembles. Large ensembles of Pt surface atoms are required for some undesired side reactions including deep dehydrogenation, which leads to coke formation, and hydrogenolysis. Thus, surface dilution of Pt ensembles is thought to enhance selectivity to propene during propane dehydrogenation while decreasing coke formation [2], [4], [28], [29], [30], [32], [37].

3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates both electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Sn in the Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts. It proposes that Sn donates electronic charge to Pt, decreasing adsorption energies and increasing the barrier for alkane dissociation. It also states that Sn dilutes Pt ensembles, limiting the side reactions that require large Pt ensembles and enhancing propene selectivity.

[1] Computational modeling has suggested Pt-Sn alloys can improve the stability of propane dehydrogenation activity while decreasing the catalyst activity by increasing the barrier for dissociative adsorption of propane [31]. 

[2] Alloys with greater Sn contents (i.e. Pt2Sn or PtSn2) have been proposed to exhibit lower activity compared to Pt3Sn alloy and unalloyed Pt [31].

<English version answer>  
5. Answer: Yes, the article describes synergistic ensemble and ligand effects between Pt and Sn in the Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts. It states that computational modeling shows Pt-Sn alloys improve stability but decrease activity by increasing the barrier for propane dissociation, with greater Sn content leading to lower activity.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
5. 答:是的,该文描述了Pt-Sn双金属催化剂中Pt和Sn之间的协同配位体和配体效应。它指出计算模拟显示Pt-Sn合金提高了稳定性但通过增加丙烷解离的屏障降低了活性,Sn含量越高活性越低。
