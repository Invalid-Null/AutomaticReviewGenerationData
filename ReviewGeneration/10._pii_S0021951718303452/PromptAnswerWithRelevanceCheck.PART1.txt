[1] "The addition of Sn to Pt propane dehydrogenation catalysts increased selectivity to propene while decreasing catalyst deactivation due to coke formation [5], [7], [8], [28], [29], [30]."

[2] "Supported Pt catalysts in particular are highly active for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, including the conversion of propane to propene."

[3] "Pt is therefore typically promoted by a second metal such as Ga [9], Cu [10], Zn [11], [12], and Sn [2], [5]."

[4] "The promotional role of Sn on Pt catalysts has been attributed to both electronic and geometric effects [2], [5], [31], [32], [33], [34]." 

[5] "Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized by IWI using H2PtCl6·6H2O and SnCl2 precursors and the mixed phase Al2O3 support."

[6] "The Pt and Sn precursors were co-impregnated in an HCl solution utilizing the same dilution and HCl:SnCl2 molar ratio as the bimetallic SiO2-supported catalysts." 

[7] "The bimetallic samples were subsequently treated in air and H2 following the same protocol used to prepare monometallic Pt/Al2O3."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It states that supported Pt catalysts are highly active for dehydrogenation of light alkanes including propane to propene (Quote 2). Pt is typically promoted by metals like Sn, Ga, Cu, Zn to improve selectivity and limit deactivation from coke formation (Quote 1, 3). The article synthesizes mono-metallic Pt and bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 via incipient wetness impregnation using H2PtCl6 and SnCl2 precursors (Quote 5-7). The role of Sn promoter is attributed to electronic and geometric effects (Quote 4).

[1] "Particle size is known to influence catalyst stability and product selectivity for monometallic Pt catalysts [47], [48] and bimetallic PtSn catalysts [32]." 

[2] "Smaller Pt nanoparticles possess more steps and kinks, which dominate the activity on smaller particles [48], bind propene more strongly and can lead to the formation of deep dehydrogenation products during propane dehydrogenation [31]."

[3] "A narrow particle size distribution for the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts can be achieved using colloidal synthesis techniques [15], [32], [49], [50], [51], [52]." 

[4] "Increasing the atomic Sn content from 97:3 (Pt:Sn) to 75:25 has been shown to increase the content of Pt3Sn alloy as evidenced by powder X-ray diffraction [52]."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts. It states that particle size influences stability and selectivity of mono-metallic Pt and bi-metallic Pt-Sn catalysts (Quote 1). Smaller Pt particles with more steps/kinks bind propene more strongly leading to deep dehydrogenation products (Quote 2). Narrow particle size distribution can be achieved using colloidal synthesis (Quote 3). Increasing Sn content from 3% to 25% increases Pt3Sn alloy content evidenced by XRD (Quote 4).

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文评价了负载单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。文中指出Pt催化剂活性很高,但需要第二种金属(如Sn)的晶格调控来提高选择性和稳定性。文中提供了数据和见解,说明了Sn的添加如何影响负载Pt催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "The dissociative adsorption of H2, which is required for hydrogen chemisorption, requires adjacent Pt sites and can be inhibited by the formation of Pt-Sn alloys or by SnOx surface species blocking these pairwise ensembles."

[2] "Computational modeling has suggested Pt-Sn alloys can improve the stability of propane dehydrogenation activity while decreasing the catalyst activity by increasing the barrier for dissociative adsorption of propane [31]."

[3] "The trend in the normalized rate of propane conversion over SiO2-supported catalysts (Fig. 5) supports the idea that Pt-Sn alloy formation improves stability while decreasing activity."
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported Pt catalysts. It shows that Pt-Sn alloy formation inhibits H2 adsorption on Pt sites, likely by disrupting adjacent Pt ensembles needed for dissociative adsorption. This decreases activity but improves stability by increasing the barrier for propane dissociation, a key step in coke formation.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文研究了金属颗粒尺寸、形状和载体相互作用等性质如何影响负载Pt催化剂的性能。文中指出,Pt-Sn合金的形成抑制了Pt位点上的H2吸附,可能是通过破坏邻近Pt组合位(该组合位是H2解离吸附所必需的)实现的。这降低了活性,但通过增加丙烷解离的活化能提高了稳定性,而丙烷解离是焦炭形成的关键步骤。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "Computational modeling has suggested Pt-Sn alloys can improve the stability of propane dehydrogenation activity while decreasing the catalyst activity by increasing the barrier for dissociative adsorption of propane [31]." 

[2] "Alloys with greater Sn contents (i.e. Pt2Sn or PtSn2) have been proposed to exhibit lower activity compared to Pt3Sn alloy and unalloyed Pt [31]."

[3] "The promotional role of Sn on Pt catalysts has been attributed to both electronic and geometric effects [2], [5], [31], [32], [33], [34]."

[4] "The geometric effect of adding Sn to Pt results from the dilution of Pt ensembles. Large ensembles of Pt surface atoms are required for some undesired side reactions including deep dehydrogenation, which leads to coke formation, and hydrogenolysis."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes some mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported Pt catalysts. It suggests Pt-Sn alloy formation increases the barrier for propane dissociative adsorption, which is the rate limiting step. This decreases activity but improves selectivity by inhibiting deep dehydrogenation reactions that form coke. Sn also dilutes large Pt ensembles needed for hydrogenolysis side reactions.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文提出了一些负载Pt催化剂上丙烷脱氢的可能反应机理。文中指出,Pt-Sn合金的生成增加了丙烷解离吸附的活化能,而这是速率控制步骤。这降低了活性,但通过抑制深度脱氢反应改善了选择性,因为深度脱氢反应会生成焦炭。Sn还稀释了所需的大型Pt集合位,这些位可以催化副反应如氢解。

6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts. It shows Sn promotion decreases coke formation, but irreversibly deactivates Pt-Sn/SiO2 during regeneration due to SnOx segregation. In contrast, Sn aids regeneration of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 by acting as nucleation sites for Pt redispersion.

6. 是的,文章研究了诸如金属颗粒大小、形状和支持体相互作用等性质如何影响支持的Pt和Pt-Sn催化剂的性能。它显示Sn促剂减少焦炭形成,但在再生过程中会使Pt-Sn/SiO2不可逆地失活,因为SnOx发生了聚集。相比之下,Sn通过作为Pt重新分散的核化位点,有助于Pt-Sn/Al2O3的再生。
