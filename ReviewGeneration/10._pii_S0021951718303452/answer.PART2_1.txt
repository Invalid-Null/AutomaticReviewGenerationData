<quotes>
[1] The presence of Sn atoms has also been suggested to improve the regeneration of deactivated Pt/Al2O3 by acting as nucleation sites for mobilized Pt atoms during oxidative treatments [4], [30], [38], [39].

[2] Electronic promotion is proposed to occur by the donation of electronic charge from Sn to Pt, which decreases the heat of ethene [32], [34] and propene [31] adsorption as well as increases the barrier for dissociative adsorption of light alkanes [31], which is postulated to be the rate determining step for the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt [2], [5], [35], [36], [37]. 

[3] The geometric effect of adding Sn to Pt results from the dilution of Pt ensembles. Large ensembles of Pt surface atoms are required for some undesired side reactions including deep dehydrogenation, which leads to coke formation, and hydrogenolysis.

Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Sn in Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts. It states that Sn donates electronic charge to Pt, decreasing the adsorption heat of alkenes like ethene and propene, and increasing the barrier for alkane dissociative adsorption, which is the rate limiting step. It also dilutes the Pt ensembles required for deep dehydrogenation and coke formation.
