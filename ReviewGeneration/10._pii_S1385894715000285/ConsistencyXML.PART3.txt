To determine consistency, I compared the key points in the answer from each file to the correct answer provided. If the files contained the same key ideas as the correct answer, I marked 100% consistency. If key ideas were missing or incorrect, I marked 0% consistency.

For question 5, answer.PART3_3.txt provides some incorrect information about using TEM to characterize interfaces, so I marked that 0% consistent with the correct answer stating no advanced microscopy techniques were used. The other files correctly stated no advanced techniques were used.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
