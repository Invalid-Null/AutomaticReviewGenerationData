[1] "The use of this zinc containing ZSM-5 results in the strong interactions between Pt and the support, thus leads to a higher resistance towards reduction."

[2] "Compared with the traditional impregnation method, the incorporation of Zn into the support makes the modification effect of the promoter to the metal phase and support acidity is reflected more effectively."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
6. The article evaluates ZSM-5 zeolite support for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows that incorporating Zn into the ZSM-5 framework results in strong interactions between Pt and the support, leading to higher reduction resistance compared to impregnated Zn. This indicates the incorporation method allows the promoter effect of Zn to be reflected more effectively in modifying the metal phase and support acidity.

<quotes>

[1] "It is reasonable to conclude that the use of this zinc-containing material can minimize the undesirable side reactions, which is favorable for the improvement of the reaction selectivity." 

[2] "As deduced from the analysis of the NH3-TPD-profiles (Fig. 5), the substitution of Zn in the support decreases the total acidity of the support evidently and the acidic centers of the supports are mainly related with the weak-medium acid sites."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

7. Yes, the article investigates tuning the Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 by incorporating Zn into the framework, and shows it decreases overall acidity while increasing weak-medium acid sites. This is hypothesized to improve selectivity by minimizing undesirable side reactions. However, no data on effects of Si/Al ratio without Zn incorporation are provided for comparison.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

7. 是的,文章研究了通过在ZSM-5框架中掺入Zn来调节Si/Al比,并表明这会显著降低总酸度而增加弱-中等强度酸中心。这被假设为通过最小化不良副反应来提高选择性。但是,没有提供不掺Zn的不同Si/Al比的比较数据。
