<quotes>
[1] "ZSM-5 zeolite has some unique physical properties, such as the special three-dimensional channel and adjustable Si-Al ratio, which makes the ZSM-5 as an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation [2]."

[2] "Kumar et al. [12] systematically investigated the influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports (ZSM-5, Beta and SBA-15) on the reaction performances in the dehydrogenation of propane and pointed out that the three dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5) were better catalytic supports than the mesoporous SBA-15."
