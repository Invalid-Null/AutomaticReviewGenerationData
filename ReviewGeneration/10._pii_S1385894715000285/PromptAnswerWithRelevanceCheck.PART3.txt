<English version answer>
Answer: The article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It focuses on incorporating Zn species into the ZSM-5 framework and evaluating the effects on catalyst performance for propane dehydrogenation.
</English version answer>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It focuses on incorporating Zn into the ZSM-5 framework rather than encapsulating metals.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
答:这篇文章没有评估在分子筛载体中胶囊化金属以增强丙烷脱氢催化剂稳定性。它专注于将Zn掺入ZSM-5框架中,而不是封装金属。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "Zn-ZSM-5 was hydrothermally synthesized and then was used as support for platinum catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Compared with the Zn-free support, the substitution of Zn in the support strengthened the interaction of platinum with support and increased the platinum dispersion effectively."

[3] "In the case of the PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5 sample, the average particle diameter decreases to 9.25 nm."

[4] "To explain this, it should be noted that the promoter of Zn has the geometric effect, which implies that zinc can act as spacer to reduce the size of the platinum particles as the role of tin in PtSn catalyst."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It synthesizes Zn-substituted ZSM-5 supports and loads Pt nanoparticles, evaluating how factors like Zn content affect Pt dispersion. Incorporating Zn into the framework increases Pt-support interactions and decreases Pt particle size from 15.3nm without Zn to 9.25nm at 1% Zn loading. This geometric dilution effect of Zn is likened to the role of Sn in PtSn catalysts.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,这篇文章调查了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它合成了Zn取代的ZSM-5载体,并加载Pt纳米颗粒,评估诸如Zn含量等因素如何影响Pt分散。将Zn掺入框架中增加了Pt与载体的相互作用,并将Pt粒子大小从没有Zn时的15.3nm降低到1%Zn载量时的9.25nm。Zn的这种几何稀释效应类似于PtSn催化剂中Sn的作用。

[1] "As for the PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5 sample, the average particle diameter decreases to 9.25 nm."
[2] "TEM images and corresponding particle size distribution of the samples are shown in Fig. 8."
