 Here is the JSON structure comparing the consistency between the answer files and the correct answers:

```json

I carefully compared the quotes and answers provided in each answer file to the correct answers to calculate the consistency ratios. For each question, I checked if the quotes were relevant and if the English/Chinese answers matched the meaning and details of the correct answers.
