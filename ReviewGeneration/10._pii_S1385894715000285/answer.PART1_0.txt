[1] "Supported platinum catalyst has been widely used in reforming or dehydrogenation processes due to its high reaction activity [4], [5], [6]." 

[2] "ZSM-5 zeolite has some unique physical properties, such as the special three-dimensional channel and adjustable Si-Al ratio, which makes the ZSM-5 as an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation [2]."

[3] "In our experiments, the PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited the highest reaction activity and stability."

5. The article evaluates supported platinum catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It notes that supported Pt catalysts are commonly used for reforming and dehydrogenation due to high activity. ZSM-5 is identified as an interesting support material due to its 3D channel structure and tunable Si/Al ratio. The PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5 catalyst showed the highest activity and stability among the catalysts tested.

[1] "The presence of zinc increases platinum dispersion effectively, implying again that the substitution of Zn in the support can increase the interactions between platinum and the support, thus suppressing the migration of metallic particles and decrease the size of platinum particles."

[2] "In this case, relatively homogeneous distribution of metallic particles was found due to the geometric effect of Zn." 

[3] "The undesired reactions can be suppressed effectively over the Zn-doped catalysts."

<English version answer> 

6. The article investigates how zinc substitution in the support affects platinum particle size, distribution, and metal-support interactions. It found that zinc incorporation increased Pt dispersion and led to more homogeneous Pt particles, likely due to increased metal-support interactions and a geometric dilution effect. This helped suppress undesired side reactions over the Zn-containing catalysts.

6. 该文研究了锌取代支撑体如何影响铂粒子大小、分布和金属-支撑体相互作用。结果发现,锌的引入增加了Pt分散度,导致Pt粒子分布更均匀,这可能是由于增强的金属-支撑体相互作用和几何稀释效应。这有助于抑制Zn含量催化剂上的不良副反应。
