 Unfortunately, upon careful review of the given literature, I do not find any relevant quotes or information that directly address the specific questions asked about propylene production, propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and kinetics, catalyst descriptors and structure-activity relationships, etc. 

The given text focuses on the synthesis and characterization of a single-site cobalt catalyst supported on silica for propane dehydrogenation. It provides background on recent cobalt homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, and describes experimental methods and results characterizing the structure and oxidation state of cobalt on the silica surface. DFT calculations are presented to investigate a proposed non-redox mechanism for C-H bond activation, but no details are provided on broader propane dehydrogenation kinetics or computational/experimental structure-activity correlations.

Therefore, I cannot provide any numbered quotes or detailed answers for the questions, as the literature does not contain information directly relevant to them. My apologies that I cannot be more helpful here given the content provided. Please let me know if I can try to clarify or expand my response in any way.
