<quotes>
[1] "Use of a custom-built reactor cell allowed samples to be pre-treated at 650 C under flowing air or 3.5% H2 in He (Praxair), and maintained under a flowing pretreatment atmosphere while being cooled to RT and examined by XAS."

[2] "In situ XAS shows that Co is not oxidized by air nor reduced by hydrogen even at 650 C."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses in-situ XAS to show that the cobalt catalyst is not oxidized by air or reduced by hydrogen during propane dehydrogenation at 650°C. 
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章利用了原位表征技术来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。具体地,它使用了原位XAS表明铬催化剂在650°C下丙烷脱氢过程中不会被空气氧化或氢气还原。

<quotes>
[1] "Collection and analysis of the edge and pre-edge features of the X-ray absorption spectrum is referred to as XANES, or X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy." 

[2] "The oxidation state at the metal using the pre-edge feature, which directly measures 1s → 3d excitation, is more reliable than determination of the oxidation state using the edge energy."

[3] "In situ XAS shows that Co is not oxidized by air nor reduced by hydrogen even at 650 C."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it utilizes XANES to measure the pre-edge feature which reveals the cobalt oxidation state. In-situ XANES shows the cobalt oxidation state is unchanged during propane dehydrogenation at 650°C under air or hydrogen.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
答:是的,文章使用了基于X射线的技术来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化状态变化。具体来说,它利用XANES测量pre-edge特征以揭示钴的氧化态。原位XANES表明,在650°C下空气或氢气存在下,钴的氧化态在丙烷脱氢过程中保持不变。
