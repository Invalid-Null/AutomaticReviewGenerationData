         [1] "Use of a custom-built reactor cell allowed samples to be pre-treated at 650 C under flowing air or 3.5% H2 in He (Praxair), and maintained under a flowing pretreatment atmosphere while being cooled to RT and examined by XAS."

         [2] "In situ XAS shows that Co is not oxidized by air nor reduced by hydrogen even at 650 C."

         [1] "Collection and analysis of the edge and pre-edge features of the X-ray absorption spectrum is referred to as XANES, or X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy."  

         [2] "The energy level of the 3d electrons is a strong function of the occupancy of the 3d states; thus, the energy difference between the 1s and 3d states is diagnostic of the oxidation state of the metal."

         [3] "In situ XAS shows that Co is not oxidized by air nor reduced by hydrogen even at 650 C."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
