<quotes>
[1] "Use of a custom-built reactor cell allowed samples to be pre-treated at 650 C under flowing air or 3.5% H2 in He (Praxair), and maintained under a flowing pretreatment atmosphere while being cooled to RT and examined by XAS."

[2] "In situ XAS shows that Co is not oxidized by air nor reduced by hydrogen even at 650 C."
</quotes>

<English version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "Collection and analysis of the edge and pre-edge features of the X-ray absorption spectrum is referred to as XANES, or X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy." 

[2] "Determination of the oxidation state at the metal using the pre-edge feature, which directly measures 1s → 3d excitation, is more reliable than determination of the oxidation state using the edge energy [46]."

[3] "In situ XAS shows that Co is not oxidized by air nor reduced by hydrogen even at 650 C."
