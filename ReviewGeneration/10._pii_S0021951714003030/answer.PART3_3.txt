[1] "Co K-edge (7709.0 eV) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were conducted on the bending magnet beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MRCAT, 10-BM) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory."

[2] "Use of a custom-built reactor cell allowed samples to be pre-treated at 650 C under flowing air or 3.5% H2 in He (Praxair), and maintained under a flowing pretreatment atmosphere while being cooled to RT and examined by XAS."

[3] "In situ XAS shows that Co is not oxidized by air nor reduced by hydrogen even at 650 C."

[1] "In this technique, incident X-rays are used to excite Co 1s electrons. Depending on the energy of the incident X-ray, a variety of phenomena may be observed." 

[2] "When the incident X-ray energy is similar to the Co 1s binding energy, core electrons are photo-excited into the valence states with the typical dipole selection rules."

[3] "The energy level of the 3d electrons is a strong function of the occupancy of the 3d states; thus, the energy difference between the 1s and 3d states is diagnostic of the oxidation state of the metal."

[4] "In situ XAS shows that Co is not oxidized by air nor reduced by hydrogen even at 650 C."
