Abstract
We report the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic performance for gas phase propane dehydrogenation of single-site Co2+ ions supported on silica. Spectroscopic characterization by resonance Raman, electron paramagnetic resonance, and X-ray near-edge and extended absorption fine structure revealed that tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ ions are chemisorbed into the trisiloxane rings on the surface of amorphous silica. In situ XAS shows that Co is not oxidized by air nor reduced by hydrogen even at 650 C. For catalytic propane dehydrogenation, single-site Co2+/SiO2 exhibits selectivities >95% at 550 C and >90% at 650 C with stable activity over 24 h. Calculations with hybrid density functional theory support a non-redox mechanism for activation of CH and HH bonds by Co2+ similar to that previously reported for single-site Zn2+/SiO2.

1. Introduction
CH activation is a fundamental and key chemical step in hydrocarbon processing, which in turn underlies production of fuels and petrochemicals. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the use of base metal catalysts for hydrocarbon functionalization [1], [2], [3], [4]. Recent examples of low-temperature hydrocarbon transformations mediated by homogeneous cobalt catalysts include hydrogenation [5], [6] (with enantioselective variants reported), CC bond formation [4], [7], [8], CH functionalization [3], [9], [10], [11], and cycloaddition reactions [12]. These reactions occur at quite mild temperatures and are the thermodynamically exergonic reactions.
In these systems, cobalt has been found to activate CH bonds, and commonly it is postulated the mechanism proceeds through a Co1+ intermediate and an oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathway with Co3+ in CC bond forming reactions [7]. The reaction has also been subjected to theoretical analysis by Yang et al., and a viable redox pathway was elucidated [13]. However, we and others have found that non-redox pathways are a viable route at high temperatures [14]. Thus, it is an open question whether redox or non-redox pathways would be operative in a high-temperature, cobalt dehydrogenation catalyst.
There are a few recent examples of low-temperature, cobalt-catalyzed hydrogenation. The Chirik group has been studying bis(arylimidazol-2-ylidene)pyridine cobalt complexes, for example (iPrCNC)CoCH3 [6] and other variants [5], [6] as highly active olefin hydrogenation catalysts under very mild conditions (50 C). Because hydrogenation of olefins is the microscopic reverse of alkane dehydrogenation, cobalt should also be catalytically active for dehydrogenation if the catalyst is stable at high temperatures. The cationic cobalt(II) alkyl complex [(PNHPCy)Co(CH2SiMe3)]BAr4 (PNHPCy = bis[(2-dicyclohexylphosphino)ethyl]amine) was reported as a pre-catalyst for alcohol dehydrogenation by Zhang and Hanson [15]. That catalyst had been previously demonstrated to be active for olefin and ketone hydrogenation [16]. A intramolecular sp3 CH activation of the three-coordinate cobalt complex [Co(IMes)2Cl] (IMes = 1,3-dimesitylimidazol-2-ylidene) was reported by Deng et al. [17]. Such CH activation ability indicates the promising catalytic potential of cobalt for alkane dehydrogenation.
Alkane dehydrogenation at high temperatures (500 C) on cobalt-substituted zeolite ZSM-5 has been studied by Iglesia et al. [18], [19], who found that Co-ZSM-5 exhibits catalytic activity similar to that of Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga-ZSM-5 [20], [21], [22], [23]. However, the ion-exchange method used to incorporate cobalt into the zeolite results in formation of multiple cobalt species in the catalyst. In addition, the zeolite contains residual strong Brnsted acid sites, which also contribute significantly to catalyst reactivity. The presence of multiple active species in Co-ZSM-5 complicates elucidation of the role of cobalt in facilitating propane dehydrogenation. This complication motivates the development of a catalyst containing a single, well-defined Co species on a support containing no other active sites.
Well-defined, single-site heterogeneous catalysts have received significant attention in the literature. The use of well-defined catalytic sites enables the development of structurefunction relationships, which reveal the molecular level origins of catalytic activity and selectivity and thereby guide the development of new catalytic materials. In addition, single-site catalysts often exhibit desirable catalytic properties, including greater selectivities to desired products than those observed over non-single-site catalysts of similar composition. Preparation of single-site catalysts typically requires controlled synthetic techniques [24]. A seminal example is the thermolytic molecular precursor technique, extensively developed by Tilley and coworkers (see [25] and references therein). Basset and Coperet [26], [27], [28] have examined single-site Zr and Ta hydrides supported on silica for hydrogenolysis and metathesis of alkanes. The Marks group [29] has investigated isolated ionic species supported on sulfated alumina with high activities for olefin hydrogenation and polymerization. Several groups have demonstrated that single-site oxovanadium catalysts provide greater selectivity than less well-dispersed oxovanadium catalysts for oxidation of alkanes [30], [31] and reduction of nitric oxide [32]. These examples and many other similar works [33], [34], [35], [36] demonstrate the advantageous properties exhibited by well-defined single-site catalysts prepared through controlled synthesis.
We have been interested in stabilizing single-site catalysts at high temperatures, so that reactions that are thermodynamically disfavored at room temperature can be driven at temperatures where equilibrium favors the reverse reaction. For example, a challenging but industrially important example of CH bond activation chemistry is the dehydrogenation of propane. Propane is the simplest molecule capable of undergoing both dehydrogenation and monomolecular cracking, allowing facile comparison between the relative rates of CH and CC bond activation, and while thermal cracking to form ethylene and methane becomes thermodynamically favorable below 250 C, propane dehydrogenation remains thermodynamically disfavored below about 550 C. The high temperatures required for high conversion in the dehydrogenation reaction therefore provide a stringent challenge for catalyst selectivity and stability.
We recently reported that a single-site Zn2+ on silica catalyst is catalytically active for propane dehydrogenation, exhibiting 95% selectivity at 550 C [37]. A density functional theory study indicates the rate-limiting step is beta-hydride elimination, which is consistent with the known stability of zinc alkyls. The active site was a low-coordinate Zn2+ ion that did not undergo a change in oxidation state during the catalytic cycle. In contrast with zinc, transition metals with partially filled d orbitals normally undergo facile β-hydride elimination and might be superior catalysts if the CH over CC activation selectivity remains high. For example, β-hydride elimination from a cobalt alkyl has recently been observed by the Holland group [38]. Given the recent examples of low-temperature, homogeneous Co hydrocarbon chemistry, along with observation of CH bond activation at higher temperatures in Co-exchanged zeolites, we chose to explore whether a similar type of single-site Con+ species could be stabilized on SiO2. Moreover, cobalt is a redox-active metal which could possibly catalyze propane dehydrogenation in a different (redox) mechanism and reaction intermediates than that previously observed on the Zn2+/silica catalyst. Thus, a well-defined cobalt-on-silica catalyst is of interest as a possible propane dehydrogenation catalyst.
We report here the synthesis and characterization of a single-site Co on silica catalyst and its catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation. Monomeric hexamminecobalt(III) (CoIII(NH3)63+) was grafted onto silica surface through electrostatic absorption. The resulting material was characterized by Raman spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and in-situ and ex-situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Four-coordinate, single-site Co2+ was confirmed as the catalytic active species for propane dehydrogenation. Raman spectroscopy indicates that cobalt ions preferentially bond to a particular subset of sites on the silica surface. Single-site Co2+/SiO2 is active for propane dehydrogenation, exhibiting high selectivity toward propene with little formation of ethylene and methane. The oxidation state of Co is unchanged under propane at reaction temperature, and no reduction was observed for Co even at 650 C in hydrogen. Density functional theory calculations reveal a non-redox CH activation mechanism similar to that reported previously for CH activation on single-site Zn2+/SiO2.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Catalysts 3L and 3H (catalysts prepared from Co(III) ions at low and high cobalt loadings, respectively): 20 g of silica (Davisil 646, 3560 mesh, 300 m2/g and 1.1 cm3/g, Aldrich) were suspended in approximately 200 mL of deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to about 11 using concentrated ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, Aldrich). In a separate flask, 0.125 g (catalyst 3L) or 5.00 g (catalyst 3H) of Co(NH3)6Cl3 (Aldrich) was dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water, and the pH adjusted to 11 with NH4OH. The basic Co(III) solution was rapidly added to the silica and stirred for 10 min at RT. The solid was allowed to settle for 5 min and the solution decanted. The resulting wet powder was vacuum filtered, rinsed several times with deionized water, and dried overnight at room temperature followed by drying overnight in air at 125 C. Subsequently, the catalyst was calcined by ramping over 1 h to 300 C and holding for 3 h. Total cobalt loadings by elemental analysis (Galbraith Laboratories, Inc.) were 0.1 wt% (3L) and 2.1 wt% (3H).
Catalysts 2L and 2H (catalysts prepared from Co(II) ions at low and high cobalt loadings, respectively): 20 g of silica (Davisil 646) were suspended in approximately 200 mL of deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to about 11 using concentrated ammonium hydroxide. In a separate flask, 0.125 g (catalyst 2L) or 5.00 g (catalyst 2H) of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Aldrich) was dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water, and the pH adjusted to 11 with NH4OH. In the preparation of catalyst 2H, addition of NH4OH to the solution of Co(II) nitrate led to partial precipitation of an uncharacterized product; this precipitate was removed from the solution by filtration. The remaining cobalt solution was added to the silica solution, stirred for 10 min, allowed to settle, and decanted. The resulting wet powder was rinsed several times with deionized water, dried overnight in air at 125 C, and subsequently ramped over 1 h to 300 C and calcined for 3 h. Total cobalt loadings by elemental analysis were 0.1 wt% (2L) and 3.1 wt% (2H).
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Co K-edge (7709.0 eV) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were conducted on the bending magnet beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MRCAT, 10-BM) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. Ionization chambers were optimized for the maximum current with linear response (ca. 1010 photons detected per second) using 45% He in N2 (10% absorption) in the incident X-ray detector and 25% Ar in N2 (70% absorption) in the transmission X-ray detector. A cobalt metal foil and third X-ray detector were placed in the beam path beyond the transmission detector to allow acquisition of a reference spectrum concurrent with each sample measurement. Use of a custom-built reactor cell allowed samples to be pre-treated at 650 C under flowing air or 3.5% H2 in He (Praxair), and maintained under a flowing pretreatment atmosphere while being cooled to RT and examined by XAS. To facilitate data analysis, XANES reference spectra were collected of Co(PPh3)3Cl, Co(Ac)2·2H2O, Co(acac)2·H2O, CoCl2, CoF2, Co(acac)3, Co(NH3)6Cl3, and LiCoO2 (all obtained from Aldrich). Co(III) acetylacetonate (6 CoO at 1.91 Å [39]) was used to prepare CoO phase and amplitude functions for EXAFS fitting of the first shell coordination. Standard fit procedures within WINXAS 3.1 software were used to fit the XAS data. The cobalt coordination environments were obtained by a least squares fit to the first nearest-neighbor shell in R-space obtained from a k2-weighted Fourier transform of the EXAFS data.
2.3. Electron paramagnetic resonance
EPR spectroscopy was conducted at X-band frequencies (9 GHz) in continuous wave mode using a Bruker ELEXSYS E580 EPR spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany), equipped with a TE102 rectangular EPR resonator (Bruker ER 4102st). A helium gas-flow cryostat (Air Products, Allentown, PA) and a Lakeshore temperature controller (Westerville, OH) were used for low-temperature measurements. Spectra were recorded at 5 K. Data processing was done using Xepr (Bruker Biospin) and Matlab 7.11.1 (MathWorks, Natick, MA) software.
2.4. Raman spectroscopy
The excitation wavelength of 287 nm for in-situ UV Raman measurements is provided by third-harmonic generation output of a 4 kHz repetition rate, nanosecond-pulsed, wavelength-tunable Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent, Indigo-S) [40]. The laser power delivered to the catalyst was 3 mW. UV Raman spectra were recorded with a triple-grating spectrometer (Princeton Instruments, Trivista 555) equipped with a liquid N2-cooled, UV-enhanced CCD detector. Prior to the measurement, samples were calcined at 300 C for 4 h. In situ Raman spectra were collected at room temperature with flowing He in the fluidized bed reactor described previously [40].
2.5. Infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine
For pyridine adsorption experiments, catalysts were pre-heated at 200 C under vacuum (<5 mTorr) and cooled down to room temperature. Then, pyridine was injected through a septum by a syringe onto the catalysts under vacuum at room temperature. Catalysts were then heated at 200 C for 1 h under vacuum to remove physisorbed pyridine. The adsorbed catalysts were cooled down to RT and mounted in an infrared cell having CaF2 windows. Nitrogen gas was used to purge the sample chamber as well as the spectrometer. The FTIR spectra were recorded using a Nicolet Nexus 670 FTIR spectrometer coupled to an MCT detector with 2 cm1 resolution.
2.6. Catalytic testing
Catalyst performance testing was conducted in a vertical, quartz tube reactor. Gas flow was controlled using mass flow controllers, and product distribution was determined via online gas chromatography (J&W Scientific) equipped with a 50 m GS-Alumina capillary column and a flame ionization detector to which H2 (99.999%, Airgas USA) and air (<2 ppm H2O, Airgas) were also supplied. Approximately 1 g of catalyst was supported on quartz wool with an internal thermocouple placed at the top of the catalyst bed. Initially, the catalyst was purged with He (99.999%, Airgas USA) that had been further purified with an oxygen trap at 300 mL/min at room temperature, then for 15 min at 100 C. The temperature was then raised to reaction temperature (550 C and 650 C for dehydrogenation; 200 C and 550 C for hydrogenation). Temperature was allowed to stabilize for 23 h before introduction of reactant gases. For propene hydrogenation, the reaction mixture comprised 88 mL/min of 4% H2/Ar mixture (Airgas USA) and 16 mL/min 4% propene/Ar mixture (Airgas), yielding a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 6.0 m3 h1 (kg catalyst)1 on a total gas-flow basis. For propane dehydrogenation, the reaction mixture comprised 3% propane/Ar at 55 mL/min, or a WHSV of 3.3 m3 h1 (kg catalyst)1. These flow conditions generally resulted in less than 10% conversion; however, the flow rate and temperature were also varied to obtain higher conversions.
2.7. Density functional theory calculations
First-principles calculations based on the hybrid density functional theory (B3LYP) [41] have been performed to investigate the CH activation mechanism in propane by Co/SiO2 catalysts. The catalyst surface is represented using a cluster model consisting of different size siloxane rings (silsesquioxane), which has been shown [42] to be a good approximation of the local structure of surface sites on amorphous silica. Since electronic effects on amorphous silica are mostly local, cluster models are reasonably accurate for studying chemical reactions. The structure optimizations and free energy calculations of different reaction intermediates and transition states were performed using Gaussian-09 quantum chemistry software [43]. The accuracy of transition state calculations was verified by performing intrinsic reaction coordinate scans [43], [44] and by frequency analysis. Triple-zeta quality (TZVP) basis sets [45] were used to perform all calculations. Computed energies reported in this paper are estimated Gibbs free energies, calculated in the rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator approximation.
3. Results
3.1. Catalyst synthesis and characterization
The method of strong electrostatic absorption was used to prepare a monolayer of chemisorbed Co3+ on SiO2. This method utilizes charge balance to bind a cation complex to a negatively charged silica surface in basic solution. The resulting orange powder is easily prepared on multigram scale and serves as a convenient entry point into surface-stabilized Co ions. Upon mild drying/calcination at 100120 C, the color changes to a vivid cobalt blue. This color is well known to be a result of pseudo-tetrahedral Co2+ and persists in under a variety of conditions (He, air, and H2), including during dehydrogenation catalysis up to 650 C. The coordination environment of the Co on the surface under these different conditions as well as the nature of these transformations was interrogated by a variety of techniques, including X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), electron paramagnetic spectroscopy (EPR), resonance Raman spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy.
3.2. X-ray absorption spectroscopy
The oxidation state and coordination environment at cobalt in catalyst 3H were investigated at each step from pre-catalyst synthesis to in-situ investigation of the working catalyst using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). In this technique, incident X-rays are used to excite Co 1s electrons. Depending on the energy of the incident X-ray, a variety of phenomena may be observed. When the incident X-ray energy is similar to the Co 1s binding energy, core electrons are photo-excited into the valence states with the typical dipole selection rules. The 1s to 3d transition, which is formally forbidden since the states differ by more than one orbital angular momentum quantum number, is enabled by spinorbit coupling between the 1s j = 1/2 state and the 3d j = 3/2 state. Spinorbit coupling in Co, however, is relatively weak, resulting in a small pre-edge peak at lower energy than the absorption edge. When the ligand environment around cobalt lacks a center of inversion, this feature is more evident. As a result, it is larger for tetrahedrally coordinated than for octahedrally coordinated Co. The energy level of the 3d electrons is a strong function of the occupancy of the 3d states; thus, the energy difference between the 1s and 3d states is diagnostic of the oxidation state of the metal.
At higher X-ray energies, the Co 1s electrons are excited directly into unoccupied Co np orbitals (n  4). This allowed transition leads to strong X-ray adsorption up to the Co 1s ionization limit and gives rise to a prominent adsorption edge. Since the Co 4p orbitals participate in cobalt-ligand bonding, the energy of the adsorption edge is a function of the ligand environment around Co. Within a ligand family, the edge energy often correlates with the average formal oxidation state. For example, the edge energy increases systematically for the series Co, CoO, Co3O4 (i.e. from Co0 to Co2+ to Co2+/3+). However, edge energies are typically not comparable across different ligand families, for example, the edge energies of CoO and CoCl2 differ even though both contain Co2+. For this reason, determination of the oxidation state at the metal using the pre-edge feature, which directly measures 1s  3d excitation, is more reliable than determination of the oxidation state using the edge energy [46]. The validity of this method is demonstrated in Table 1, which shows that the pre-edge adsorption energy is a reliable indicator of the formal oxidation state regardless of the chemical composition of the compound. Collection and analysis of the edge and pre-edge features of the X-ray absorption spectrum is referred to as XANES, or X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy.
