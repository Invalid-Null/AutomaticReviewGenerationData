[1] The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst shows the improved selectivity and anticoking ability after promoted by Cu. It is suggested that the effects of Cu are similar to Sn. The favorable performance is attributed to the bimetallic interaction between Pt and Cu (entry 4, Table 1). (25) 

[2] Besides, the Pt/Cu single atom alloy shows a high stability in PDH. The catalyst exhibited a large difference between the energy barrier of desorption and deep dehydrogenation, which is helpful to prevent coke formation and leads to the high selectivity and stability (entry 5, Table 1). (33)

[3] Moreover, the addition of In could reduce the acidity strength of the catalyst and form PtIn alloy. The In-modified Pt catalyst shows a lower activity than the counterpart of Sn promoter, but with a better stability (entry 6, Table 1). (80,81) 

[4] The addition of Ga forms PtGa alloy on the Pt/CeO2Al2O3 catalyst. PtGa alloy decreases the size of Pt ensembles and blocks the defective sites, leading to the higher selectivity (entries 79, Table 1). (79)

2. Yes, the article evaluates several Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn, Pt-Ga, Pt-Cu, and Pt-In for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on initial activity, selectivity, stability, and amount of coke for these catalysts in Table 1, showing how the secondary metals modulate the performance. It also explains how the electronic and geometric effects of the second metal influence activity, selectivity and coking resistance. For example, Cu forms a bimetallic interaction with Pt that improves selectivity and stability.

[1] The main effect of Sn is to improve the selectivity and stability as shown in entries 13 of Table 1. Moreover, the coke precursor adsorbed weakly on PtSn, which enables the easy transfer from metal to support. (72) By this method, the active components are kept intact, which delivers good activity and stability. (45) 

[2] The improvements induced by Sn promoter are usually attributed to geometry effects and electronic effects, respectively. The infrared spectroscopy indicated that the Sn blocked the undercoordinated sites and constrained Pt particles into smaller ensembles. (73) Moreover, the transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and H2-chemisorption analysis shows that addition of Sn led to higher dispersion of Pt. (45) 

[3] Furthermore, the electronic effect is also revealed. The X-ray absorption near edge structure spectra showed that the absorption edge is shifted to higher energy, indicating Sn withdraws electrons from Pt. (74) Besides, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows the oxidized Sn is formed in PtSn/Mg-SBA-15 catalyst. (75)

[4] Specifically, the electronic effect is found to influence the energy barrier of dehydrogenation and desorption of products, and the geometry effect has effects on the local coverage of free sites for the side reaction. The energy barrier and coverage could change the reaction rate as suggested by the rate law.

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal like Sn in Pt-Sn bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It provides specific examples showing Sn modifies the geometry by blocking undercoordinated sites and dispersing Pt, while also modifying the electronics by withdrawing electrons from Pt. These electronic effects influence energy barriers and the geometric effects influence site coverage, both modulating the reaction rates and performance.

[1] It is suggested that Sn promoter could constrain Pt in a small ensemble, which is detrimental to side reactions. (24)

[2] Both effects have been intensively studied by DFT calculations. Specifically, the electronic effect is found to influence the energy barrier of dehydrogenation and desorption of products, and the geometry effect has effects on the local coverage of free sites for the side reaction. The energy barrier and coverage could change the reaction rate as suggested by the rate law. 

[3] The results show that the increasing Sn concentrations downshifted the d-band center, which leads to decreasing activity. Bader charge analysis showed that charge transfers from Sn to Pt atoms. Both appear to weaken the adsorption of propylene.

5. Yes, the article describes synergistic ensemble and ligand effects between Pt and the secondary metal like Sn. It explains how Sn constrains Pt into smaller ensembles detrimental for side reactions. It also shows how Sn downshifts the Pt d-band center and transfers charge to Pt atoms, weakening propylene adsorption. These ensemble and ligand effects work synergistically to improve selectivity.
