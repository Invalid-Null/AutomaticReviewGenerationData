[1] Coke Deposition on Pt-Based Catalysts in Propane Direct Dehydrogenation: Kinetics, Suppression, and Elimination
Abstract
Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation to meet the dramatically increased demand of propylene from an on-purpose catalytic process. 

[2] With the large-scale Shale gas discovery worldwide, (24) the abundance of light alkanes including methane, ethane, and propane open new opportunities to propene production. The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry.

2. The article explains that catalysts like Pt-based catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy than the uncatalyzed reaction. It states that Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation in industry to meet the increased demand for propylene. The abundance of light alkanes from shale gas has opened up opportunities for propene production via catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, which provides a promising and effective route.

[1] The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively. 

[2] Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company. (1) Polymer-quality propylene can be obtained from Oleflex technology. 

[3] Chromium oxide is another major industrial catalyst of PDH applied in Catofin process from Lummus. The chromium oxide is generally supported on alumina. One disadvantage of chromium oxide catalyst is the toxicity, which potentially causes issues with regard to safety and post-treatment.

3. Yes, the article introduces some major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation. It states that the most representative catalysts are platinum and chromium oxide. It mentions that platinum-based catalysts have been employed commercially in the Oleflex process by UOP to produce polymer-grade propylene. Chromium oxide catalysts are also used industrially in the Catofin process by Lummus, often supported on alumina, but they have toxicity issues.

[1] The DFT calculations demonstrate that the energy barrier for dehydrogenation significantly increase when carbon atom adsorption at the nearby site. Moreover, the coadsorbed C atoms downshift the d-band center of Pt, which consequently decreases the activity toward CH bond activation according to d-band theory. (48) 

[2] The calculations based on Pt3Sn(211) indicate that high selectivity and low coking amount on the PtSn catalyst can be originated from the absence of active Pt step sites. (77)

5. Yes, the article discusses how DFT calculations have provided insights into propane dehydrogenation mechanisms. It states that DFT calculations show the energy barrier increases when carbon atoms adsorb nearby, and coadsorbed carbon downshifts Pt's d-band center, decreasing activity per d-band theory. Calculations also indicate PtSn's high selectivity and low coking arise from the absence of active Pt step sites.

5. 是的,该文讨论了DFT计算如何为丙烷脱氢机理提供了见解。它指出DFT计算显示当碳原子附近吸附时能障增加,共吸附的碳使Pt的d带中心下移,根据d带理论,活性降低。计算也表明PtSn的高选择性和低焦炭量起源于没有活性Pt台阶位。
