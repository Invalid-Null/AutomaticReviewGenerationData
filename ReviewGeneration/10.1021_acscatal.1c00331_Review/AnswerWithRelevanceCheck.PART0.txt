         [1] As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years.  
         [2] The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry.

           [1] PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C. The reaction is limited by thermodynamics, and the yields of propene can be increased by lowering propane partial pressure or raising temperature.

           [1] The DFT calculations demonstrate that the energy barrier for dehydrogenation significantly increase when carbon atom adsorption at the nearby site.  
           [2] The calculations based on Pt3Sn(211) indicate that high selectivity and low coking amount on the PtSn catalyst can be originated from the absence of active Pt step sites. 
       </Quotes>
       <English>
           The article discusses how DFT calculations provided insights like showing co-adsorbed carbon increases dehydrogenation barriers on Pt, and PtSn's selectivity/low coking is due to lack of active Pt sites.
