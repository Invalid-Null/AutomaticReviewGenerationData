<quotes>
[1] "The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst shows the improved selectivity and anticoking ability after promoted by Cu. It is suggested that the effects of Cu are similar to Sn. The favorable performance is attributed to the bimetallic interaction between Pt and Cu (entry 4, Table 1)." 

[2] "The addition of Ga forms PtGa alloy on the Pt/CeO2Al2O3 catalyst. PtGa alloy decreases the size of Pt ensembles and blocks the defective sites, leading to the higher selectivity (entries 79, Table 1)."

[3] "The success of single atom/site not only significantly reduce the coke formation but also create a new direction to optimize PDH performance."

[4] "The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates several catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion, including alloying with promotors like Cu, Ga, and Sn to form bimetallic interactions and constrained ensembles (quotes 1-2), as well as synthesizing single atom catalysts and confining nanoclusters in zeolites (quotes 3-4). These techniques help block undercoordinated sites and limit the ensemble size of the active metal, enhancing selectivity and stability.

PtSn cluster is precisely located in sinusoidal 10R channels of siliceous MFI zeolite. The anchor site of the cluster is very important which renders not only the good stability without obvious sintering but also excellent resistance to cokes.

PtZn cluster encapsulated in silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite. The catalysts have extraordinary low deactivation constant of 0.001 h1, which is 200 times lower than the counterpart supported on Al2O3. 

[3] Mesoporous zeolite with surface framework defects as PDH catalyst support. Rare-earth elements such as La and Y can be trapped at these defective sites as atomic species. The much increased chemical potential of atomic La and Y enable them to form an intermetallic compound with Pt.
</quotes>

<English version answer>

[1] "Recently, Cormas group developed a series PtSn cluster catalysts which are confined in zeolite and applied in PDH. (71) Although PtSn is the conventional PDH catalyst, the intriguing feature of the obtained catalyst is that the region selective deposition of PtSn cluster within zeolite. The subnanometer (0.50.6 nm) PtSn cluster is precisely located in sinusoidal 10R channels of siliceous MFI zeolite."

(82) It was found that rare-earth elements such as La and Y can be trapped at these defective sites as atomic species. The much increased chemical potential of atomic La and Y enable them to form an intermetallic compound with Pt. Moreover, La/Y also enhanced the strong metalsupport interaction which increased catalyst dispersion. The synthesized PtLa/Y cluster with 3 nm diameter uniformly distributed within zeolite. The confined PtLa/Y cluster exhibited remarkable stability in PDH."
