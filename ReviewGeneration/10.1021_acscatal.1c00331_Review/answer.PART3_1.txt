<quotes>
[1] "The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst shows the improved selectivity and anticoking ability after promoted by Cu. It is suggested that the effects of Cu are similar to Sn. The favorable performance is attributed to the bimetallic interaction between Pt and Cu (entry 4, Table 1)." 

[2] "The addition of Ga forms PtGa alloy on the Pt/CeO2Al2O3 catalyst. PtGa alloy decreases the size of Pt ensembles and blocks the defective sites, leading to the higher selectivity (entries 79, Table 1)."

[3] "The success of single atom/site not only significantly reduce the coke formation but also create a new direction to optimize PDH performance."

[4] "The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation."

Answer: The article investigates several catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion, including alloying with promotors like Cu, Ga, and Sn to form bimetallic interactions and constrained ensembles (quotes 1-2), as well as synthesizing single atom catalysts and confining nanoclusters in zeolites (quotes 3-4). These techniques help block undercoordinated sites and limit the ensemble size of the active metal, enhancing selectivity and stability.

答:这篇文章研究了几种催化剂制备方法,旨在优化活性相的分散,包括与Cu、Ga 和Sn等助剂形成双金属互作用和约束的合金(引用1-2),以及合成单原子催化剂和将纳米簇封装在分子筛中(引用3-4)。这些技术有助于封锁低配位位点,限制活性金属的组合大小,提高选择性和稳定性。
