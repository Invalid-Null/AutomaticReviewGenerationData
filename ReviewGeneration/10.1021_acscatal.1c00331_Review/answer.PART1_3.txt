<quotes>
[1] Specifically, the smaller particles include plenty of undercoordinated sites which are very active in CH and CC bond activation. (65)

[2] Moreover, the concepts of a single atom/site is applicable for Pt catalysts, which achieve not only good activity but also impressive stability. (33)

[3] Under this principle, single atom/site strategies were explored to optimize PDH performance. (33)

[4] Zhang et al. examined the cokes formation on a series different loading of Pt supported on alumina. (29)

12. The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing smaller Pt particles are initially more active but have higher coking rates due to undercoordinated sites that activate C-C and C-H bonds (Quote 1). It also shows single atom Pt sites have good stability and selectivity by preventing C-C bond activation (Quotes 2-3). Experiments comparing different Pt loadings found almost no coke on single atom Pt vs. much higher coking at higher loadings (Quote 4).

12. 本文评估了单金属Pt支持催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显示,较小的Pt粒子最初更活跃,但由于未配位位点激活C-C和C-H键,烧结速率更高(引用1)。它还显示单原子Pt位点通过阻止C-C键激活具有良好的稳定性和选择性(引用2-3)。比较不同Pt负载量的实验发现,单原子Pt几乎没有焦炭,而更高负载量的焦炭明显更高(引用4)。

[1] The smaller Pt particles has higher activity but also a higher rate of coke formation, leading to more coke depositions. (28,30) The larger surface area of the smaller Pt particles is responsible for the higher coking rate, as shown in Figure 5a. (28)

[2] Furthermore, the phenomena is explained as the smaller particles include plenty of undercoordinated sites which are very active in CH and CC bond activation. (65) 

[3] Moreover, the energy barrier of CH bond breaking is lower than the energy barrier of propylene desorption at undercoordinated sites, which is leading to the occurrence of deep reaction. (66)

<English version answer>
13. The article shows smaller Pt particles are initially more active but have higher coking rates due to their higher surface area and abundant undercoordinated sites (Quote 1). The undercoordinated sites readily cleave C-C and C-H bonds but not C=C bonds, causing deep dehydrogenation reactions that form coke instead of desired propylene product (Quotes 2-3).
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 
13. 本文显示,较小的Pt粒子最初更活跃,但由于其表面积更大、未配位位点更丰富,焦炭速率更高(引用1)。未配位位点容易切断C-C和C-H键而不是C=C键,导致深度脱氢反应形成焦炭,而不是所需的丙烯产物(引用2-3)。
