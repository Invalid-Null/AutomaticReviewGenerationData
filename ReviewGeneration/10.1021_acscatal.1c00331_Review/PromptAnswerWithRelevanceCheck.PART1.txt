<quotes>
[1] "Platinum-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."

[2] "The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst shows the improved selectivity and anticoking ability after promoted by Cu."

[3] "The Pt/Cu single atom alloy shows a high stability in PDH."

[4] "The addition of In could reduce the acidity strength of the catalyst and form PtIn alloy." 

[5] "The synthesized PtLa/Y cluster with 3 nm diameter uniformly distributed within zeolite. The confined PtLa/Y cluster exhibited remarkable stability in PDH."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
5. Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Cu single atom alloy catalysts exhibit improved selectivity, anti-coking ability, and stability. The addition of promoters like Cu and In are shown to enhance performance by forming alloys and reducing acidity. Confined Pt alloy clusters in zeolites also demonstrate remarkable stability.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
5. 是的,文中评价了受载单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。提供的数据显示,Pt/Al2O3和Pt/Cu单原子合金催化剂表现出改善的选择性、抗焦炭能力和稳定性。Cu和In等助剂的添加通过形成合金和减少酸性来增强性能。缴获在分子筛中的Pt合金簇也表现出显著的稳定性。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "The catalyst containing smaller Pt particles has higher activity but also a higher rate of coke formation." 

[2] "The phenomena is explained as the smaller particles include plenty of undercoordinated sites which are very active in CH and CC bond activation."

[3] "The additions of Sn not only increases the energy barrier of propane and propylene dehydrogenation but also decreases the number of free sites that accommodate the product of cracking reactions."

[4] "The Pt3Sn bulk alloy is the best candidate."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like particle size and promoters affect supported Pt catalyst performance. Smaller Pt particles and undercoordinated sites lead to higher activity but more coking. Adding Sn increases dehydrogenation barriers and decreases free sites for cracking, improving selectivity. Pt3Sn bulk alloy is identified as an optimal composition.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
6. 是的,文中研究了像粒径和助剂等性质对受载Pt催化剂性能的影响。更小的Pt粒子和非配位位点导致更高的活性但也更多焦炭生成。添加Sn增加脱氢反应的能垒并减少裂解反应的自由位点,改善选择性。Pt3Sn大块合金被认定为最佳组成。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."

[2] "The calculations demonstrate that the energy barrier for dehydrogenation significantly increase when carbon atom adsorption at the nearby site." 

[3] "Our previous DFT-based kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation indicated that the coke precursors affect the geometry and number of exposed active sites, leading to lower activity but higher selectivity and lower coking rate."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
7. Yes, the article proposes PDH mechanisms over Pt catalysts involving adsorbed intermediates and active sites. DFT studies show coke precursors block sites and increase barriers, lowering activity but improving selectivity. KMC simulations indicate coke alters active site geometry and number, also improving selectivity and stability.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
7. 是的,文中为Pt催化剂上的PDH反应机理提出了涉及吸附中间体和活性位点的机理。DFT研究显示焦炭前体阻塞位点和增加反应垒,降低活性但提高选择性。KMC模拟表明焦炭改变了活性位点的几何结构和数量,也提高了选择性和稳定性。

<quotes>
[1] Specifically, the smaller particles include plenty of undercoordinated sites which are very active in CH and CC bond activation. (65)

[2] Moreover, the concepts of a single atom/site is applicable for Pt catalysts, which achieve not only good activity but also impressive stability. (33)

[3] Under this principle, single atom/site strategies were explored to optimize PDH performance. (33)

[4] Zhang et al. examined the cokes formation on a series different loading of Pt supported on alumina. (29) 
</quotes>

<English version answer>
12. The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing smaller Pt particles are initially more active but have higher coking rates due to undercoordinated sites that activate C-C and C-H bonds (Quote 1). It also shows single atom Pt sites have good stability and selectivity by preventing C-C bond activation (Quotes 2-3). Experiments comparing different Pt loadings found almost no coke on single atom Pt vs. much higher coking at higher loadings (Quote 4).
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
12. 本文评估了单金属Pt支持催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显示,较小的Pt粒子最初更活跃,但由于未配位位点激活C-C和C-H键,烧结速率更高(引用1)。它还显示单原子Pt位点通过阻止C-C键激活具有良好的稳定性和选择性(引用2-3)。比较不同Pt负载量的实验发现,单原子Pt几乎没有焦炭,而更高负载量的焦炭明显更高(引用4)。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] The smaller Pt particles has higher activity but also a higher rate of coke formation, leading to more coke depositions. (28,30) The larger surface area of the smaller Pt particles is responsible for the higher coking rate, as shown in Figure 5a. (28)

[2] Furthermore, the phenomena is explained as the smaller particles include plenty of undercoordinated sites which are very active in CH and CC bond activation. (65) 

[3] Moreover, the energy barrier of CH bond breaking is lower than the energy barrier of propylene desorption at undercoordinated sites, which is leading to the occurrence of deep reaction. (66)
</quotes>

<English version answer>
13. The article shows smaller Pt particles are initially more active but have higher coking rates due to their higher surface area and abundant undercoordinated sites (Quote 1). The undercoordinated sites readily cleave C-C and C-H bonds but not C=C bonds, causing deep dehydrogenation reactions that form coke instead of desired propylene product (Quotes 2-3).
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 
13. 本文显示,较小的Pt粒子最初更活跃,但由于其表面积更大、未配位位点更丰富,焦炭速率更高(引用1)。未配位位点容易切断C-C和C-H键而不是C=C键,导致深度脱氢反应形成焦炭,而不是所需的丙烯产物(引用2-3)。
