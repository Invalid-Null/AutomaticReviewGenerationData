<quotes>

[1] "Ryoo et al. used a mesoporous zeolite with surface framework defects as PDH catalyst support. (82) It was found that rare-earth elements such as La and Y can be trapped at these defective sites as atomic species." 

[2] "Under the real industrial condition, the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst showed an initial propane conversion of 20% at 550 C and an initial selectivity to 97% propylene."

[3] " The anchor site of the cluster is very important which renders not only the good stability without obvious sintering but also excellent resistance to cokes."

23. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides examples of using mesoporous zeolites with surface defects to trap rare earth metals like La and Y, which can then anchor PtSn clusters. Data shows a K-PtSn@MFI catalyst achieved 20% propane conversion and 97% propylene selectivity at 550C under industrial conditions, with excellent stability. The anchoring prevents sintering and coking.

[1] "The active components are anchored and dispersed by the support."

[2] "The interactions between the catalyst and the support often have a direct influence on the activity, such as PDH." 

[3] "The Pt catalysts on the microporous support show better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amount than the counterpart on the mesoporous support."

[4] "The confined subnanometer (0.50.6 nm) PtSn cluster is precisely located in sinusoidal 10R channels of siliceous MFI zeolite."

<English version answer>

24. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It notes supports anchor and disperse active components, and interactions with supports influence activity. It gives examples of microporous vs mesoporous supports, showing the former give better selectivity, stability and lower coking. It also describes precisely confining subnanometer PtSn clusters in zeolite channels to optimize dispersion.

[1] "The intensities of the D and G bands reveal the nature of coke formation. In the beginning, coke quickly formed, then slowed, reaching a constant level."

[2] "Hence, the control of burning temperature of coke is of great importance."

[3] "Operando Raman spectroscopy analysis of PDH on Pt/Al2O3 shows that the coke forms rapidly in the first few minutes, and then the intensity of the coke species slowly drops to a constant over an hour."
