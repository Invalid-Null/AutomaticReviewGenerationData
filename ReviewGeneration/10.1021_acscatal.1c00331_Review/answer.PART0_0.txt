[1] The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively.
[2] Platinum-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades. 
[3] Chromium oxide is another major industrial catalyst of PDH applied in Catofin process from Lummus.
[4] Besides platinum and chromium oxide, there are a bunch of other materials which are also investigated as PDH catalysts, including Fe, Co, Ru, Rh, VOx, WOx, GaOx, and ZrOx.
