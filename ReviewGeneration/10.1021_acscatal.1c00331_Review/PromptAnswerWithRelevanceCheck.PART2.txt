 <quotes>

[1] "The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst shows a decrease of conversion from the initial 34.8% to 11.7% under the same condition. In contrast, a [PtZn4] has no obvious deactivation during a 160 h test, and the conversion drop is only 0.04%."

[2] "The addition of Sn not only increases the energy barrier of propane and propylene dehydrogenation but also decreases the number of free sites that accommodate the product of cracking reactions, which lead to higher selectivity but lower activity. It is suggested that the Pt3Sn bulk alloy is the best candidate."

[3] "Both effects have been intensively studied by DFT calculations. Specifically, the electronic effect is found to influence the energy barrier of dehydrogenation and desorption of products, and the geometry effect has effects on the local coverage of free sites for the side reaction."

[4] "The Pt3La/Y catalysts has an initial 40% conversion and still retain 8% conversion after 30 days of reaction under a harsh condition and large space velocity." 

[5] "The introduction of Sn could cause the transfer of coke from active site to support. A side effect of this practice is that the coke on the support is more difficult to remove than on metal."

<quotes>

[1] The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst shows the improved selectivity and anticoking ability after promoted by Cu. It is suggested that the effects of Cu are similar to Sn. The favorable performance is attributed to the bimetallic interaction between Pt and Cu (entry 4, Table 1). (25) 

[2] Besides, the Pt/Cu single atom alloy shows a high stability in PDH. The catalyst exhibited a large difference between the energy barrier of desorption and deep dehydrogenation, which is helpful to prevent coke formation and leads to the high selectivity and stability (entry 5, Table 1). (33)

[3] Moreover, the addition of In could reduce the acidity strength of the catalyst and form PtIn alloy. The In-modified Pt catalyst shows a lower activity than the counterpart of Sn promoter, but with a better stability (entry 6, Table 1). (80,81) 

[4] The addition of Ga forms PtGa alloy on the Pt/CeO2Al2O3 catalyst. PtGa alloy decreases the size of Pt ensembles and blocks the defective sites, leading to the higher selectivity (entries 79, Table 1). (79)

2. Yes, the article evaluates several Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn, Pt-Ga, Pt-Cu, and Pt-In for propane dehydrogenation.

<quotes>

[1] The main effect of Sn is to improve the selectivity and stability as shown in entries 13 of Table 1. Moreover, the coke precursor adsorbed weakly on PtSn, which enables the easy transfer from metal to support. (72) By this method, the active components are kept intact, which delivers good activity and stability. (45) 

[2] The improvements induced by Sn promoter are usually attributed to geometry effects and electronic effects, respectively. The infrared spectroscopy indicated that the Sn blocked the undercoordinated sites and constrained Pt particles into smaller ensembles. (73) Moreover, the transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and H2-chemisorption analysis shows that addition of Sn led to higher dispersion of Pt. (45) 

[3] Furthermore, the electronic effect is also revealed. The X-ray absorption near edge structure spectra showed that the absorption edge is shifted to higher energy, indicating Sn withdraws electrons from Pt. (74) Besides, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows the oxidized Sn is formed in PtSn/Mg-SBA-15 catalyst. (75)

[4] Specifically, the electronic effect is found to influence the energy barrier of dehydrogenation and desorption of products, and the geometry effect has effects on the local coverage of free sites for the side reaction. The energy barrier and coverage could change the reaction rate as suggested by the rate law.

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal like Sn in Pt-Sn bimetallic and alloy catalysts.

These electronic effects influence energy barriers and the geometric effects influence site coverage, both modulating the reaction rates and performance.

[1] It is suggested that Sn promoter could constrain Pt in a small ensemble, which is detrimental to side reactions. (24)

[2] Both effects have been intensively studied by DFT calculations.

The energy barrier and coverage could change the reaction rate as suggested by the rate law. 

[3] The results show that the increasing Sn concentrations downshifted the d-band center, which leads to decreasing activity. Bader charge analysis showed that charge transfers from Sn to Pt atoms. Both appear to weaken the adsorption of propylene.

5. Yes, the article describes synergistic ensemble and ligand effects between Pt and the secondary metal like Sn.

[1] In fact, there are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH. The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation. The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects.

[2] Tin is the most widely applied promoter for Pt, which has enhanced improvements in many reports.

[3] Besides Sn, other non-noble metals such as Cu, Al, and In have also been studied as promoters. 

[4] Further elements are introduced to tune the catalytic performance based on PtSn. The performances of a series of PtSnAl/SBA-15 catalysts show that the higher Al concentration leads to higher coke formation rate.

<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article evaluates several Pt alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, including Pt-Sn, Pt-Cu, Pt-Al, and Pt-In. It provides data showing improved activity, selectivity, and stability compared to unpromoted Pt, attributed to electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metals. For example, Sn helps transfer coke accumulation from the metal to the support, keeping the metal active. The article also explores adding a third element like Al to PtSn, but too much Al increases coking.

2. 是的,该文评估了几种丙烷脱氢用的Pt合金催化剂,包括Pt-Sn、Pt-Cu、Pt-Al和Pt-In。它提供了数据,显示与没有掺杂的Pt相比,这些二元合金催化剂具有更好的活性、选择性和稳定性,这是由于掺杂金属引起的电子效应和几何效应。例如,Sn可以帮助焦炭从金属部位转移到载体上,使金属部位保持活性。该文还探讨在PtSn上再掺入第三种元素如Al,但Al含量过高会增加焦炭生成。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] For example, the size and structure of the Pt particle significantly affects the performance. The catalyst containing smaller Pt particles has higher activity but also a higher rate of coke formation, leading to more coke depositions. 

[2] It is generally proposed that the electronic effect dominates at low Sn loading, whereas the geometric effect is more important at high Sn loading.

[3] Their results showed that the addition of Sn not only increases the energy barrier of propane and propylene dehydrogenation but also decreases the number of free sites that accommodate the product of cracking reactions, which lead to higher selectivity but lower activity.

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in Pt bimetallic and alloy catalysts.

<quotes>

[1] Moreover, for a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere.

[2] PtSn/CeO2Al2O3 catalyst shows a better performance on coking suppression and stability than PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. It is concluded that the synergistic effects between Ce and Sn are working to prevent coking and Ce alone does not bring too much difference.

[3] The performances of PtSn on ZnAl2O4 shows higher tolerance for deactivation than PtSn/Al2O3 on PDH due to the different coke mobility from metal to support.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

5. Yes, the article describes some synergistic effects between metals in bimetallic catalysts. For example, it explains how Sn and Ce have synergistic coking suppression effects in a PtSn/CeO2-Al2O3 catalyst. It also attributes better coke transfer from metal to support in a PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst compared to PtSn/Al2O3 to synergies between PtSn and the ZnAl2O4 support.
