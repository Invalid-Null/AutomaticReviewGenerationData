1. As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years. (1) The conventional routes of obtaining propene are mainly related to stream or catalytic cracking of downstream products of the petroleum industry, which are extremely energy intensive with low selectivity. 

2. Although the process has been commercialized with high selectivity for decades, the prevention of coke deposition is still a daunting challenge.

3. Pt-based catalysts have been widely used in propane dehydrogenation to meet the dramatically increased demand of propylene from an on-purpose catalytic process. 

4. Chromium oxide is another major industrial catalyst of PDH applied in Catofin process from Lummus. The chromium oxide is generally supported on alumina. One disadvantage of chromium oxide catalyst is the toxicity, which potentially causes issues with regard to safety and post-treatment. 

5. Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades. (20,21)
