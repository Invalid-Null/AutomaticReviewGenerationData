To generate this, I compared the English version answers from each file to the correct English answers provided. I calculated a consistency ratio by qualitatively estimating the degree of semantic similarity between the two answers. This involved assessing factors like whether key details were captured, appropriate conclusions were made based on the quotes, etc. The consistency ratio expresses the degree to which the student's answer conveys the same meaning as the correct answer.
