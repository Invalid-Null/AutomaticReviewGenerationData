PtSn cluster is precisely located in sinusoidal 10R channels of siliceous MFI zeolite. The anchor site of the cluster is very important which renders not only the good stability without obvious sintering but also excellent resistance to cokes.

PtZn cluster encapsulated in silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite. The catalysts have extraordinary low deactivation constant of 0.001 h1, which is 200 times lower than the counterpart supported on Al2O3. 

[3] Mesoporous zeolite with surface framework defects as PDH catalyst support. Rare-earth elements such as La and Y can be trapped at these defective sites as atomic species. The much increased chemical potential of atomic La and Y enable them to form an intermetallic compound with Pt.

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides examples of subnanometer PtSn clusters anchored in the channels of siliceous MFI zeolites, PtZn clusters encapsulated in silicalite-1, and PtLa/Y clusters formed at framework defect sites in mesoporous zeolites. Data shows significantly enhanced stability compared to conventional supported catalysts, with insights that zeolite confinement stabilizes the metal clusters against sintering and coking.

答:是的,文章评估了金属封装在沸石支持体中的方法,以提高丙烷脱氢催化剂的稳定性。它提供了几个例子,比如亚纳米 PtSn 簇锚定在硅质 MFI 分子筛的通道中,PtZn 簇封装在硅沸石-1 中,以及 PtLa/Y 簇形成在介孔沸石的框架缺陷位点处。数据显示与传统支持催化剂相比,稳定性显着提高,原因是沸石限域效应稳定了金属簇,防止了烧结和形碳。
