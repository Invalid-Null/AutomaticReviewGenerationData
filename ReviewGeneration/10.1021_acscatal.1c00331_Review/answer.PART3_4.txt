[1] "Recently, Cormas group developed a series PtSn cluster catalysts which are confined in zeolite and applied in PDH. (71) Although PtSn is the conventional PDH catalyst, the intriguing feature of the obtained catalyst is that the region selective deposition of PtSn cluster within zeolite. The subnanometer (0.50.6 nm) PtSn cluster is precisely located in sinusoidal 10R channels of siliceous MFI zeolite."

[2] "Ryoo et al. used a mesoporous zeolite with surface framework defects as PDH catalyst support. (82) It was found that rare-earth elements such as La and Y can be trapped at these defective sites as atomic species. The much increased chemical potential of atomic La and Y enable them to form an intermetallic compound with Pt. Moreover, La/Y also enhanced the strong metalsupport interaction which increased catalyst dispersion. The synthesized PtLa/Y cluster with 3 nm diameter uniformly distributed within zeolite. The confined PtLa/Y cluster exhibited remarkable stability in PDH."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It discusses examples of confining sub-nanometer PtSn clusters within the 10R channels of siliceous MFI zeolite and encapsulating 3 nm PtLa/Y clusters within a mesoporous zeolite. Data shows enhanced stability for the confined PtSn and PtLa/Y clusters compared to conventional supported clusters. The zeolite confinement is suggested to minimize metal sintering and coking during reaction.

答:是的,文章评价了在沸石支撑体内封装金属以提高丙烷脱氢催化剂稳定性。它讨论了将亚纳米PtSn簇封装在硅MFI沸石的10R通道内和将3 nm PtLa/Y簇封装在介孔沸石内的例子。数据显示,与常规负载的簇相比,封装的PtSn和PtLa/Y簇的稳定性有所提高。推测沸石的封装可在反应过程中最小化金属聚集和焦炭形成。
