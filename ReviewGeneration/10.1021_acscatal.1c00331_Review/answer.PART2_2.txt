<quotes>
[1] "Tin is the most widely applied promoter for Pt, which has enhanced improvements in many reports."

[2] "The Pt/Ga single atom alloy in PDH. One of the interesting strategies adopted in this work is that Pt3Ga sites are selectively blocked by Pb, while the single Pt site was unchanged."  

[3] "Besides Sn, other non-noble metals such as Cu, Al, and In have also been studied as promoters."

[4] "Both effects have been intensively studied by DFT calculations."

[5] "It is generally proposed that the electronic effect dominates at low Sn loading, whereas the geometric effect is more important at high Sn loading."

2. Yes, the article evaluates several Pt alloy catalysts including Pt-Sn, Pt-Ga, Pt-Cu, and Pt-In for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability compared to monometallic Pt. The article explains how Sn, Ga, and other metals modulate performance through electronic and geometric effects by constraining particle size, blocking defective sites, and modifying the Pt electronic structure.

[1] "Both effects have been intensively studied by DFT calculations." 

[2] "It is generally proposed that the electronic effect dominates at low Sn loading, whereas the geometric effect is more important at high Sn loading."

[3] "The results show that the increasing Sn concentrations downshifted the d-band center, which leads to decreasing activity."

[4] "Their results showed that the addition of Sn not only increases the energy barrier of propane and propylene dehydrogenation but also decreases the number of free sites that accommodate the product of cracking reactions, which lead to higher selectivity but lower activity."

[5] "The single Pt surrounded by inert Cu significantly reduced the barrier of propene desorption which make the products desorption become favorable over the deep dehydrogenation."

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in Pt bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It provides DFT calculation results showing how Sn and other metals affect d-band center position, alter activation barriers, and constrain particle size and ensemble effects. These electronic and geometric modifications are linked to enhanced selectivity and stability.
