1. As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years.(1)

2. The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8 -> C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry. 

3. Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation to meet the dramatically increased demand of propylene from an on-purpose catalytic process.

4. Although the process has been commercialized with high selectivity for decades, the prevention of coke deposition is still a daunting challenge.

5. Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company.(1)

6. Polymer-quality propylene can be obtained from Oleflex technology.

7. Chromium oxide is another major industrial catalyst of PDH applied in Catofin process from Lummus. 

8. The chromium oxide is generally supported on alumina. 

9. One disadvantage of chromium oxide catalyst is the toxicity, which potentially causes issues with regard to safety and post-treatment.

<English version answer>

1. Answer: The article states that propene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, and there has been a dramatic increase in the demand for propene in recent years. It mentions that the on-purpose catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is an effective route to massively produce propylene, and this process has already been exploited commercially. 

2. Answer: The article does not explain how catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers or describe specific mechanisms of catalyst activity.

3. Answer: The article introduces platinum-based catalysts and chromium oxide catalysts as two major industrial catalyst classes used for propane dehydrogenation. It states that platinum-based catalysts are used in the commercial Oleflex PDH process by UOP, and chromium oxide catalysts are used in the Catofin PDH process by Lummus.

4. Answer: The article does not discuss the thermodynamic constraints or kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. No quantitative details of thermodynamics or kinetics are provided.

5. Answer: The article does not describe how DFT calculations have been applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways. No computational insights are revealed. 

6. Answer: The article does not present any microkinetic modeling efforts that have provided insights into propane dehydrogenation kinetics. No rate equations, parameters, or models are discussed.

7. Answer: The article does not describe any computational or experimental work identifying descriptors that correlate catalyst properties to propane dehydrogenation performance. No specific structure-activity relationships are revealed.
