[1] "The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst shows a decrease of conversion from the initial 34.8% to 11.7% under the same condition. In contrast, a [PtZn4] has no obvious deactivation during a 160 h test, and the conversion drop is only 0.04%."

[2] "The addition of Sn not only increases the energy barrier of propane and propylene dehydrogenation but also decreases the number of free sites that accommodate the product of cracking reactions, which lead to higher selectivity but lower activity. It is suggested that the Pt3Sn bulk alloy is the best candidate."

[3] "Both effects have been intensively studied by DFT calculations. Specifically, the electronic effect is found to influence the energy barrier of dehydrogenation and desorption of products, and the geometry effect has effects on the local coverage of free sites for the side reaction."

[4] "The Pt3La/Y catalysts has an initial 40% conversion and still retain 8% conversion after 30 days of reaction under a harsh condition and large space velocity." 

[5] "The introduction of Sn could cause the transfer of coke from active site to support. A side effect of this practice is that the coke on the support is more difficult to remove than on metal."

1. Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn and Pt-Zn for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt-Sn and Pt-Zn alloys exhibit higher selectivity and stability compared to monometallic Pt, with examples of PtSn showing only an 11.7% drop in conversion over 160 hours versus a 34.8% drop for Pt, and PtZn4 showing only a 0.04% drop in conversion over 160 hours. 

2. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal. It explains the secondary metal tunes selectivity by increasing dehydrogenation barriers and reducing free sites for cracking reactions, with Pt3Sn identified as optimal, showing electronic effects dominate at low loadings and geometric effects at high loadings.

3. No, the article does not explore the use of subsurface promoters like Re or Mn in bimetallic catalysts.

4. No, the article does not describe any synergistic ensemble or ligand effects between metals in bimetallic catalysts. 

5. Yes, the article evaluates zeolite supports like MFI and FER for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on PtSn catalysts supported on MFI showing 20% initial conversion and only a 3% drop after 70 hours, and PtLa/Y catalysts supported on FER showing 40% initial conversion and 32% conversion after 30 days.

6. No, the article does not investigate effects of varying Si/Al ratio or mesoporosity in zeolite supports.

1. 是的,文章评估了PtSn和PtZn等Pt合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供了数据,显示PtSn和PtZn合金比单质Pt催化剂具有更高的选择性和稳定性,例如PtSn催化剂160小时转化率只下降11.7%,而Pt催化剂下降34.8%;PtZn4催化剂160小时转化率仅下降0.04%。

2. 是的,文章研究了二元金属的电子效应和几何效应。它解释了第二金属通过提高脱氢活化能垒和减少裂解反应的自由位点来调节选择性,确定Pt3Sn为最佳,低负载时电子效应占主导,高负载时几何效应占主导。

3. 否,文章没有探索Re或Mn等亚表面助剂在双金属催化剂中的应用。 

4. 否,文章没有描述双金属催化剂中金属间的任何协同配位或配体效应。

5. 是的,文章评估了MFI和FER等分子筛作为丙烷脱氢催化剂的载体。它提供了数据,支持MFI的PtSn催化剂初始转换率为20%,70小时仅下降3%;支持FER的PtLa/Y催化剂初始转换率为40%,30天后转换率仍为32%。

6. 否,文章没有研究改变分子筛Si/Al比或引入介孔对载体性能的影响。
