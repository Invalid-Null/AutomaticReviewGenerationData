[1] "Tin is the most widely applied promoter for Pt, which has enhanced improvements in many reports. (40,46,65,6871) The main effect of Sn is to improve the selectivity and stability as shown in entries 13 of Table 1." 

[2] "Besides Sn, other non-noble metals such as Cu, Al, and In have also been studied as promoters. The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst shows the improved selectivity and anticoking ability after promoted by Cu."

[3] "Further elements are introduced to tune the catalytic performance based on PtSn. The performances of a series of PtSnAl/SBA-15 catalysts show that the higher Al concentration leads to higher coke formation rate."

2. Yes, the article evaluates several Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn, Pt-Cu, Pt-Al, and Pt-In for propane dehydrogenation. It provides specific data on how these promoters modulate performance, such as Sn improving selectivity and stability, and Cu enhancing selectivity and anti-coking ability. The article also explores adding elements like Al to Pt-Sn alloys.

[1] "It is generally proposed that the electronic effect dominates at low Sn loading, whereas the geometric effect is more important at high Sn loading."

[2] "Moreover, both effects have been intensively studied by DFT calculations. Specifically, the electronic effect is found to influence the energy barrier of dehydrogenation and desorption of products, and the geometry effect has effects on the local coverage of free sites for the side reaction."

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It explains that at low loadings, the electronic effects of the secondary metal dominate, while at higher loadings, geometric effects become more important. DFT calculations reveal how the secondary metal modulates energy barriers and site coverages through electronic and geometric mechanisms.
