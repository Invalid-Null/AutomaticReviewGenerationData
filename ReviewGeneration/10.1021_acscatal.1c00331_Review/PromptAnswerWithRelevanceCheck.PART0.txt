[1] Coke Deposition on Pt-Based Catalysts in Propane Direct Dehydrogenation: Kinetics, Suppression, and Elimination
Abstract
Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation to meet the dramatically increased demand of propylene from an on-purpose catalytic process. 

[2] With the large-scale Shale gas discovery worldwide, (24) the abundance of light alkanes including methane, ethane, and propane open new opportunities to propene production. The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry.

2. The article explains that catalysts like Pt-based catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy than the uncatalyzed reaction. It states that Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation in industry to meet the increased demand for propylene. The abundance of light alkanes from shale gas has opened up opportunities for propene production via catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, which provides a promising and effective route.

[1] The DFT calculations demonstrate that the energy barrier for dehydrogenation significantly increase when carbon atom adsorption at the nearby site. Moreover, the coadsorbed C atoms downshift the d-band center of Pt, which consequently decreases the activity toward CH bond activation according to d-band theory. (48) 

[2] The calculations based on Pt3Sn(211) indicate that high selectivity and low coking amount on the PtSn catalyst can be originated from the absence of active Pt step sites. (77)

5. Yes, the article discusses how DFT calculations have provided insights into propane dehydrogenation mechanisms. It states that DFT calculations show the energy barrier increases when carbon atoms adsorb nearby, and coadsorbed carbon downshifts Pt's d-band center, decreasing activity per d-band theory. Calculations also indicate PtSn's high selectivity and low coking arise from the absence of active Pt step sites.
