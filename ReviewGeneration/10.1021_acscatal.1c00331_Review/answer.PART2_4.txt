<quotes>

[1] In fact, there are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH. The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation. The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects.

[2] Tin is the most widely applied promoter for Pt, which has enhanced improvements in many reports.

[3] Besides Sn, other non-noble metals such as Cu, Al, and In have also been studied as promoters. 

[4] Further elements are introduced to tune the catalytic performance based on PtSn. The performances of a series of PtSnAl/SBA-15 catalysts show that the higher Al concentration leads to higher coke formation rate.

2. Yes, the article evaluates several Pt alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, including Pt-Sn, Pt-Cu, Pt-Al, and Pt-In. It provides data showing improved activity, selectivity, and stability compared to unpromoted Pt, attributed to electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metals. For example, Sn helps transfer coke accumulation from the metal to the support, keeping the metal active. The article also explores adding a third element like Al to PtSn, but too much Al increases coking.

2. 是的,该文评估了几种丙烷脱氢用的Pt合金催化剂,包括Pt-Sn、Pt-Cu、Pt-Al和Pt-In。它提供了数据,显示与没有掺杂的Pt相比,这些二元合金催化剂具有更好的活性、选择性和稳定性,这是由于掺杂金属引起的电子效应和几何效应。例如,Sn可以帮助焦炭从金属部位转移到载体上,使金属部位保持活性。该文还探讨在PtSn上再掺入第三种元素如Al,但Al含量过高会增加焦炭生成。

[1] For example, the size and structure of the Pt particle significantly affects the performance. The catalyst containing smaller Pt particles has higher activity but also a higher rate of coke formation, leading to more coke depositions. 

[2] It is generally proposed that the electronic effect dominates at low Sn loading, whereas the geometric effect is more important at high Sn loading.

[3] Their results showed that the addition of Sn not only increases the energy barrier of propane and propylene dehydrogenation but also decreases the number of free sites that accommodate the product of cracking reactions, which lead to higher selectivity but lower activity.

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in Pt bimetallic and alloy catalysts. For example, smaller Pt particles have higher activity but more coking due to undercoordinated sites. It also explains how Sn affects the energy barriers and number of free sites through electronic effects at low loading and geometric blocking at high loading.

3. 是的,该文研究了Pt双金属和合金催化剂中掺杂金属的电子效应和几何效应。例如,较小的Pt颗粒具有更高的活性但也更容易焦炭,因为它具有非配位位点。该文还解释了低负载Sn通过电子效应和高负载Sn通过几何屏蔽效应如何影响能垒和自由位点数量。

[1] Moreover, for a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere.

[2] PtSn/CeO2Al2O3 catalyst shows a better performance on coking suppression and stability than PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. It is concluded that the synergistic effects between Ce and Sn are working to prevent coking and Ce alone does not bring too much difference.

[3] The performances of PtSn on ZnAl2O4 shows higher tolerance for deactivation than PtSn/Al2O3 on PDH due to the different coke mobility from metal to support.

5. Yes, the article describes some synergistic effects between metals in bimetallic catalysts. For example, it explains how Sn and Ce have synergistic coking suppression effects in a PtSn/CeO2-Al2O3 catalyst. It also attributes better coke transfer from metal to support in a PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst compared to PtSn/Al2O3 to synergies between PtSn and the ZnAl2O4 support.

5. 是的,该文描述了一些双金属催化剂中的金属间协同效应。例如,它解释了Sn和Ce在PtSn/CeO2-Al2O3催化剂中具有抑制焦炭生成的协同效应。它还将PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂相比PtSn/Al2O3催化剂具有更好的焦炭从金属向载体的转移能力归因于PtSn与ZnAl2O4载体之间的协同作用。
