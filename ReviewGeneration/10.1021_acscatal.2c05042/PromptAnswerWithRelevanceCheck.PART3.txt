1. Isolated Pt Species Anchored by Hierarchical-like Heteroatomic Fe-Silicalite-1 Catalyze Propane Dehydrogenation near the Thermodynamic Limit

2. The Fe species were doped into the silicalite-1 zeolite through Fe-EDTA complexation during hydrothermal crystallization, hindering the formation of precipitates in a strongly alkaline environment. 

3. Here, we explored a hierarchical-like heteroatomic ferrosilicate (hierarchical-like-Fe-silicalite-1-n, H-Fe-S-1-n; n represents variable Fe content, denoted as Fe-n) with the specific ability to anchor Pt atoms, which allowed atomic-level dispersion primarily in the oxidized state.

4. The materials were designated as Pt/Fe-n (where Pt loading is approximately 0.1 wt %). Interestingly, the isolated-site catalyst Pt/Fe-3 with low Pt loading can stably operate at propane conversion values close to the thermodynamic limits in a feed without hydrogen addition and exhibit over 95% propylene selectivity.

5. XAS was employed to monitor the electronic states of the Pt/Fe-n catalysts. As shown in Figure S24a, Fe was essentially present in the +3 valence state without the formation of PtFe alloys. 

6. In situ DRIFTS with CO adsorption was carried out to further acquire information on surface Pt ensembles in different catalyst samples (Figure 3i).

7. AC-HAADF-STEM imaging showed that the ultra-small spots were composed of isolated Pt atoms (Figure 4bd).

27. 是的,该文使用Pt L3和Fe K边缘的X射线吸收光谱技术探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。数据显示Pt和Fe在反应前后保持在隔离的氧化态。

28. 不,该文没有评估不同的反应器类型用于丙烷脱氢反应。它关注催化剂的合成和表征。
