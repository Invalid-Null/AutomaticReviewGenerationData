1. The article does not discuss process intensification approaches for propane dehydrogenation.

2. The article does not analyze techno-economic factors affecting the viability of propane dehydrogenation processes. 

3. The article does not discuss safety issues like flammability and explosion hazards with propane dehydrogenation.

4. The article does not directly summarize remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. However, it identifies the need for catalysts that can achieve high propane conversion close to thermodynamic limits without significant deactivation.

5. The article does not propose leveraging high-throughput computational methods for propane dehydrogenation catalyst screening and design. 

6. The article does not highlight needs for improved in-situ characterization tools to better understand propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

7. The article does propose a potentially transformational catalyst architecture of isolated Pt atoms anchored on zeolites that could enable performance breakthroughs in propane dehydrogenation.
