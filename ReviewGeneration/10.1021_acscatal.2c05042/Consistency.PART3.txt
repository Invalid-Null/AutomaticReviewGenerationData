    "answer1.txt": "50%", 
    "answer2.txt": "50%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"

To summarize:

- answer0.txt matches the correct answers 100% for all questions
- answer1.txt has some inconsistencies, especially for questions 1, 4, and 6
- answer2.txt is inconsistent for questions 1, 3, and 4 but consistent for others 
- answer3.txt is very inconsistent, only matching questions 2 and 7
- answer4.txt is fully consistent except for question 4

So in terms of overall consistency with the correct answers provided, the ranking is:
