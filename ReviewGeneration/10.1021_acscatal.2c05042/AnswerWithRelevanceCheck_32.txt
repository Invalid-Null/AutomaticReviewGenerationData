         [1] "The Fe species were doped into the silicalite-1 zeolite through Fe-EDTA complexation during hydrothermal crystallization, hindering the formation of precipitates in a strongly alkaline environment." 

         [2] "Here, we explored a hierarchical-like heteroatomic ferrosilicate (hierarchical-like-Fe-silicalite-1-n, H-Fe-S-1-n; n represents variable Fe content, denoted as Fe-n) with the specific ability to anchor Pt atoms, which allowed atomic-level dispersion primarily in the oxidized state."

         [3] "To explore Pt dispersion in Pt/Fe-3, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images at different resolutions are presented in Figure 2ei. At an initial 10 nm resolution, small white Pt spots marked with yellow circles were observed, mainly occurring as clusters accompanied by a few nanoparticles. However, the spots consisted of numerous isolated Pt atoms, visible at a higher resolution (1 nm)."

         [4] "The introduction of Fe increased the stability of O interactions in the FeOSi bridge compared to the PtO interaction in the SiOSi bridge, leading to the formation of an active site (SiOPtOFe)."

         Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It discusses methods like Fe-EDTA complexation during hydrothermal crystallization to dope Fe species into the silicalite-1 zeolite framework in order to hinder precipitate formation and help disperse Pt atoms. Specific examples given are exploring hierarchical heteroatomic ferrosilicates to anchor isolated Pt atoms, seen in HAADF-STEM images as single atoms rather than nanoparticles when supported on Fe-doped zeolites. The Fe species help stabilize the isolated Pt through Fe-O-Si bridges.

         [1] "In this study, we have reported a conceptually designed catalyst composed of Pt species anchored via hydroxyl groups other than silanol nests. The isolated Pt atoms were stably bonded through the O framework in a hierarchical-like heteroatomic silicalite zeolite with a suitable acidity after subsequent calcination and reduction, which could achieve high propane conversions at different temperatures and atmospheres close to the thermodynamic limit."

         [2] "Moreover, no significant deactivation was observed for 3 days in a pure propane atmosphere at 580 C, outperforming most of the cutting-edge Pt-based catalysts."

         [3] "The introduction of Fe increased the stability of O interactions in the FeOSi bridge compared to the PtO interaction in the SiOSi bridge, leading to the formation of an active site (SiOPtOFe)."

         Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides examples like doping Fe into the zeolite framework to help anchor isolated Pt atoms through stable Fe-O-Si bridges, leading to an active SiOPtOFe site. This catalyst showed no deactivation for 3 days at 580C under pure propane, outperforming other Pt catalysts. The Fe helps stabilize Pt by increasing O interaction strength.

         Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like Fe-EDTA complexation during hydrothermal synthesis to dope Fe into the zeolite framework. HAADF-STEM imaging shows this method yields isolated Pt atoms anchored to the Fe-doped zeolite support rather than nanoparticles.
