[1] "In this study, we have reported a conceptually designed catalyst composed of Pt species anchored via hydroxyl groups other than silanol nests. The isolated Pt atoms were stably bonded through the O framework in a hierarchical-like heteroatomic silicalite zeolite with a suitable acidity after subsequent calcination and reduction, which could achieve high propane conversions at different temperatures and atmospheres close to the thermodynamic limit."

[2] "Moreover, no significant deactivation was observed for 3 days in a pure propane atmosphere at 580 C, outperforming most of the cutting-edge Pt-based catalysts."

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It reports a catalyst with isolated Pt atoms anchored in a hierarchical heteroatomic silicalite zeolite via hydroxyl groups. This showed high propane conversion close to thermodynamic limits with no significant deactivation over 3 days at 580C in pure propane, outperforming other Pt catalysts.

[1] "To gain insight into the skeletal Fe-mediated high Pt dispersion, several structural characteristics were explored." 

[2] "The introduction of Fe increased the stability of O interactions in the FeOSi bridge compared to the PtO interaction in the SiOSi bridge, leading to the formation of an active site (SiOPtOFe)."

[3] "The Fe-doped T4 site expressed a stronger Pt anchoring effect, and the Rietveld refinement of the SXRD data indicated the presence of other anchoring sites, such as T6."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It explores using skeletal iron species to mediate high dispersion of Pt atoms. Introducing Fe increased Pt-O interaction stability compared to Si-O-Si, forming isolated Pt sites anchored by Fe-O-Si linkages. The T4 site showed strong Pt anchoring, and other sites like T6 were also identified.
