22. Does the article describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports? What specific methods and examples are discussed?

[1] "To address these challenges, plenty of intensive research has focused on constructing Pt-based intermetallic compounds, such as Pt-based nanoparticles, clusters, and single atoms."

[2] "Here, we explored a hierarchical-like heteroatomic ferrosilicate (hierarchical-like-Fe-silicalite-1-n, H-Fe-S-1-n; n represents variable Fe content, denoted as Fe-n) with the specific ability to anchor Pt atoms, which allowed atomic-level dispersion primarily in the oxidized state."

[3] "The Fe species were doped into the silicalite-1 zeolite through Fe-EDTA complexation during hydrothermal crystallization, hindering the formation of precipitates in a strongly alkaline environment."

[4] "The introduction of Fe increased the stability of O interactions in the FeOSi bridge compared to the PtO interaction in the SiOSi bridge, leading to the formation of an active site (SiOPtOFe)."

23. Does the article evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability? What specific examples, data, and insights are provided?

[1] "In this study, we have reported a conceptually designed catalyst composed of Pt species anchored via hydroxyl groups other than silanol nests. The isolated Pt atoms were stably bonded through the O framework in a hierarchical-like heteroatomic silicalite zeolite with a suitable acidity after subsequent calcination and reduction, which could achieve high propane conversions at different temperatures and atmospheres close to the thermodynamic limit."

[2] "Moreover, no significant deactivation was observed for 3 days in a pure propane atmosphere at 580 C, outperforming most of the cutting-edge Pt-based catalysts."

[3] "The Fe-doped T4 site expressed a stronger Pt anchoring effect, and the Rietveld refinement of the SXRD data indicated the presence of other anchoring sites, such as T6."

24. Does the article investigate catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion? What specific techniques and examples are discussed?

[1] "The Fe species were doped into the silicalite-1 zeolite through Fe-EDTA complexation during hydrothermal crystallization, hindering the formation of precipitates in a strongly alkaline environment." 

[2] "HAADF-STEM images at different resolutions are presented in Figure 2ei. At an initial 10 nm resolution, small white Pt spots marked with yellow circles were observed, mainly occurring as clusters accompanied by a few nanoparticles. However, the spots consisted of numerous isolated Pt atoms, visible at a higher resolution (1 nm)."

[3] "The introduction of Fe increased the stability of O interactions in the FeOSi bridge compared to the PtO interaction in the SiOSi bridge, leading to the formation of an active site (SiOPtOFe)."

25. Does the article utilize any in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts? What specific examples, data, and insights are revealed?

[1] "Subsequently, in situ DRIFTS with CO adsorption was carried out to further acquire information on surface Pt ensembles in different catalyst samples (Figure 3i)." 

[2] "Moreover, CO adsorption peaks detected only at 2077 cm-1 in Pt/Fe-3 after regeneration tests further supported the presence and stability of the isolated Ptδ+ atoms."

[3] "The production of coke precursors was further examined using in situ C3H6-DRIFT spectra (Figure S33)."

[4] "Propane activation was also detected in real-time by in situ C3H8-DRIFT spectra (Figure S35)."

26. Does the article employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts? What specific examples and insights are provided?

[1] "HAADF-STEM images at different resolutions are presented in Figure 2ei. At an initial 10 nm resolution, small white Pt spots marked with yellow circles were observed, mainly occurring as clusters accompanied by a few nanoparticles." 

[2] "AC-HAADF-STEM imaging showed that the ultra-small spots were composed of isolated Pt atoms (Figure 4bd)." 

[3] "Significant Pt dispersion was further illustrated through elemental mapping (Figure 4e)."

27. Does the article use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis? What specific examples, data, and insights are revealed?

28. Does the article evaluate different reactor types like fixed beds, fluidized beds, or membrane reactors for propane dehydrogenation? What specific examples, data, and insights are provided?

1. The article describes using zeolites doped with transition metals like Fe to synthesize isolated single Pt sites. Fe is incorporated into the zeolite framework during hydrothermal synthesis using Fe-EDTA complexes. This allows Pt to anchor to O sites in Fe-O-Si bridges, forming isolated Pt species.

2. The article shows Pt species embedded in heteroatomic zeolites have high stability for propane dehydrogenation, with no deactivation over 3 days at 580C in pure propane. This is attributed to isolated Pt being anchored to the zeolite framework through O sites.

3. The article investigates methods like Fe-EDTA doping during hydrothermal synthesis to achieve high dispersion of Pt, avoiding nanoparticle formation. STEM shows isolated Pt atoms anchored to the support.

4. The article uses in-situ DRIFTS and TPD to characterize working catalysts. This revealed the presence of isolated Pt sites and their stability after regeneration. DRIFTS also provided insights into coke precursor formation.

5. The article uses AC-STEM and elemental mapping to show isolated Pt atoms bonded to the zeolite framework and unchanged after catalysis. This confirmed excellent metal-support interaction.

1. 该文介绍了使用类似Fe的过渡金属掺杂的沸石来合成隔离的单一Pt位点。Fe是在水热合成过程中使用Fe-EDTA复合物掺入沸石框架的。这使得Pt能够锚定在Fe-O-Si桥上的O位点上,形成隔离的Pt物种。

2. 该文展示了嵌入在异质原子沸石中的Pt物种在丙烷脱氢反应中具有很高的稳定性,在580°C纯丙烷气氛下3天无明显失活。这归因于隔离的Pt通过O位点锚定在沸石框架上。

3. 该文研究了例如在水热合成过程中Fe-EDTA掺杂等方法,以实现Pt的高度分散,避免纳米粒子的形成。STEM显示锚定在载体上的隔离Pt原子。

4. 该文使用原位DRIFTS和TPD表征工作中的催化剂。这揭示了隔离Pt位点的存在及其在再生后保持稳定。DRIFTS还提供了对焦化前体形成的见解。

5. 文使用AC-STEM和元素映射表明与沸石框架键合的隔离Pt原子在催化反应后保持不变。这证实了优异的金属-载体相互作用。
