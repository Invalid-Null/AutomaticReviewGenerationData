I carefully analyzed the answers provided in each file and compared them to the correct answers. For each question, I calculated the consistency ratio as the percentage of information that matches between the given answer and correct answer. As you can see in the XML output, the first 5 questions have 100% consistency across all files. However for questions 6 and 7, only answer.PART2_0.txt and answer.PART2_1.txt match the correct answer, while the other files give irrelevant answers resulting in 0% consistency. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
