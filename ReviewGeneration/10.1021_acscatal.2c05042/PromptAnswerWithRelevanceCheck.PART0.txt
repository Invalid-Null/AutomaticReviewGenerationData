 <quotes>

[1] "The source of propylene, one of the key building blocks in the chemical industry, is slowly shifting from naphtha to light alkanes because of the advent of shale gas, which has led to the derivation of on-demand propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology."

[2] "The reaction is strongly endothermic; thus, increasing the reaction temperature (>500 C) is the most effective strategy to achieve higher yields."

[3] "PtSn (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles have been reported to operate as PDH catalysts at thermodynamically limited conversion levels with great stability and propylene selectivity."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

1. The article provides background that propylene is a key chemical building block, and its production is shifting from naphtha cracking to propane dehydrogenation due to abundant shale gas. It states that propane dehydrogenation is strongly endothermic, so higher temperatures (>500C) are needed to achieve good yields. 

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

1. 文章提供了丙烯是重要的化学基础原料这一背景,且由于页岩气资源丰富,其生产正在从裂化石脑油转向丙烷脱氢。文章指出丙烷脱氢反应强烈的吸热,所以需要更高的反应温度(>500摄氏度)来获得更好的收率。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "To address these challenges, plenty of intensive research has focused on constructing Pt-based intermetallic compounds, such as Pt-based nanoparticles, clusters, and single atoms." 

[2] "In addition, the specific contribution of the second metal in the PtZn and PtSn-based cluster catalysts for the PDH reaction has been demonstrated."

[3] "PtSn (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles have been reported to operate as PDH catalysts at thermodynamically limited conversion levels with great stability and propylene selectivity."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article explains that catalysts like Pt-based nanoparticles, clusters, and single atoms can facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing alternative reaction pathways with lower activation barriers. For example, it states that PtSn nanoparticles and PtZn/PtSn clusters have shown good performance for propane dehydrogenation at thermodynamic equilibrium conversions.

</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>

2. 文章解释了Pt基纳米粒子、簇和单原子等催化剂可以通过提供较低活化能垒的另外反应途径来促进丙烷脱氢。例如,文章指出PtSn纳米粒子和PtZn/PtSn簇已经显示了在热力学平衡转化率时较好的丙烷脱氢性能。

<quotes>

[1] "Therefore, achieving high per-pass propane conversion while maintaining catalyst stability and high selectivity is essential, which is more challenging for single-atom Pt catalysts, yet highly appealing with practical applications."

[2] "The reaction is strongly endothermic; thus, increasing the reaction temperature (>500 C) is the most effective strategy to achieve higher yields." 

[3] "For better comparison, Pt/Fe-3-catalyzed experimental propane conversion and conversion at thermodynamic equilibrium limits were studied as a function of temperature."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is limited thermodynamically, so per-pass conversions are constrained. It also notes kinetic factors, stating the reaction is strongly endothermic so higher temperatures favor conversion. The experimental propane conversions on the Pt/Fe-3 catalyst are compared to calculated thermodynamic equilibrium conversions.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

4. 文章讨论了丙烷脱氢在热力学上是受限的,所以单程转化率是受约束的。它还指出动力学因素,即反应强烈的吸热,所以更高的温度有利于转化。 Pt/Fe-3催化剂上的实验丙烷转化率与计算的热力学平衡转化率进行了比较。

<English version answer>
2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the activation energy barrier. Specifically, it states that because the reaction is strongly endothermic, increasing the temperature is an effective way to achieve higher yields. This implies that catalysts can provide an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy.
