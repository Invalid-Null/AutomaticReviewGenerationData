[1] "The source of propylene, one of the key building blocks in the chemical industry, is slowly shifting from naphtha to light alkanes because of the advent of shale gas, which has led to the derivation of on-demand propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology."

[2] "The reaction is strongly endothermic; thus, increasing the reaction temperature (>500 C) is the most effective strategy to achieve higher yields."

[3] "PtSn (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles have been reported to operate as PDH catalysts at thermodynamically limited conversion levels with great stability and propylene selectivity."

1. The article provides background that propylene is a key chemical building block, and its production is shifting from naphtha cracking to propane dehydrogenation due to abundant shale gas. It states that propane dehydrogenation is strongly endothermic, so higher temperatures (>500C) are needed to achieve good yields.

2. The article explains that catalysts like Pt-based nanoparticles, clusters, and single atoms can facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing alternative reaction pathways with lower activation barriers. For example, it states that PtSn nanoparticles and PtZn/PtSn clusters have shown good performance for propane dehydrogenation at thermodynamic equilibrium conversions.

[1] "Therefore, achieving high per-pass propane conversion while maintaining catalyst stability and high selectivity is essential, which is more challenging for single-atom Pt catalysts, yet highly appealing with practical applications."

[2] "The reaction is strongly endothermic; thus, increasing the reaction temperature (>500 C) is the most effective strategy to achieve higher yields." 

[3] "For better comparison, Pt/Fe-3-catalyzed experimental propane conversion and conversion at thermodynamic equilibrium limits were studied as a function of temperature."

4. The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is limited thermodynamically, so per-pass conversions are constrained. It also notes kinetic factors, stating the reaction is strongly endothermic so higher temperatures favor conversion. The experimental propane conversions on the Pt/Fe-3 catalyst are compared to calculated thermodynamic equilibrium conversions.
