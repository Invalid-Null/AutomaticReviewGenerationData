         "The Fe species were doped into the silicalite-1 zeolite through Fe-EDTA complexation during hydrothermal crystallization, hindering the formation of precipitates in a strongly alkaline environment."
         "Here, we explored a hierarchical-like heteroatomic ferrosilicate (hierarchical-like-Fe-silicalite-1-n, H-Fe-S-1-n; n represents variable Fe content, denoted as Fe-n) with the specific ability to anchor Pt atoms, which allowed atomic-level dispersion primarily in the oxidized state."
         "To explore Pt dispersion in Pt/Fe-3, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images at different resolutions are presented in Figure 2ei. At an initial 10 nm resolution, small white Pt spots marked with yellow circles were observed, mainly occurring as clusters accompanied by a few nanoparticles. However, the spots consisted of numerous isolated Pt atoms, visible at a higher resolution (1 nm)."
         "The introduction of Fe increased the stability of O interactions in the FeOSi bridge compared to the PtO interaction in the SiOSi bridge, leading to the formation of an active site (SiOPtOFe)."

         Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It discusses methods like Fe-EDTA complexation during hydrothermal crystallization to dope Fe species into the silicalite-1 zeolite framework in order to hinder precipitate formation. This helps disperse and isolate the Pt species anchored to the framework. STEM imaging shows isolated Pt atoms achieved through these synthesis techniques.
