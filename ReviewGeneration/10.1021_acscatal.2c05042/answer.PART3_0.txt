1. Isolated Pt Species Anchored by Hierarchical-like Heteroatomic Fe-Silicalite-1 Catalyze Propane Dehydrogenation near the Thermodynamic Limit

2. The Fe species were doped into the silicalite-1 zeolite through Fe-EDTA complexation during hydrothermal crystallization, hindering the formation of precipitates in a strongly alkaline environment. 

3. Here, we explored a hierarchical-like heteroatomic ferrosilicate (hierarchical-like-Fe-silicalite-1-n, H-Fe-S-1-n; n represents variable Fe content, denoted as Fe-n) with the specific ability to anchor Pt atoms, which allowed atomic-level dispersion primarily in the oxidized state.

4. The materials were designated as Pt/Fe-n (where Pt loading is approximately 0.1 wt %). Interestingly, the isolated-site catalyst Pt/Fe-3 with low Pt loading can stably operate at propane conversion values close to the thermodynamic limits in a feed without hydrogen addition and exhibit over 95% propylene selectivity.

5. XAS was employed to monitor the electronic states of the Pt/Fe-n catalysts. As shown in Figure S24a, Fe was essentially present in the +3 valence state without the formation of PtFe alloys. 

6. In situ DRIFTS with CO adsorption was carried out to further acquire information on surface Pt ensembles in different catalyst samples (Figure 3i).

7. AC-HAADF-STEM imaging showed that the ultra-small spots were composed of isolated Pt atoms (Figure 4bd).

22. Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It discusses methods like anchoring Pt atoms to bridging oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework through strong metal-support interactions. Specific examples given are doping Fe into the silicalite-1 zeolite framework to form heteroatomic Fe-silicalite-1 materials that can anchor isolated Pt atoms.

23. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides data on Fe-containing zeolites stabilizing isolated Pt atoms and preventing sintering during propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. Insights are that the Fe species incorporated into the zeolite framework provide anchoring sites for Pt atoms through bridging oxygen atoms, leading to high dispersion and stability. 

24. Yes, the article investigates preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like controlled hydrothermal synthesis and metal complexation to incorporate specific amounts of Fe into the zeolite framework, which provides sites to anchor highly dispersed Pt atoms. An example is using Fe-EDTA complexation to dope Fe into silicalite-1 during zeolite crystallization.

25. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ DRIFTS and XAS to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. DRIFTS reveals differences in surface Pt ensembles like isolated atoms vs nanoparticles on different samples. XAS provides insights into oxidation state changes and local coordination environments of Pt and Fe during catalysis.  

26. Yes, the article employs AC HAADF-STEM to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides images showing isolated Pt atoms anchored to the zeolite framework. Insights are that the Fe species incorporated into the framework provide stable sites for Pt atom dispersion.
