[1] "Alumina-supported catalysts (PtSn-Al2O3-X) containing 0.5 wt% platinum and 0.8 wt% tin were synthesized by incipient wetness co-impregnation method using H6PtCl6·6H2O and SnCl2·2H2O as precursors."

[2] "PtSn-Al2O3-0.10 had the highest yield and the most stable selectivity for propylene (Fig. S5b, c)." 

[3] "TEM images showed the dispersion of Pt particles on the support of Al2O3-0 and Al2O3-0.10 (Fig. S6a and b), Pt particles were small with an average size of 1.6 nm in PtSn-Al2O3-0.10, while there were several large particles in PtSn-Al2O3-0, which might be related to the number of hydroxyl groups on the surface."

5. Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Alumina-supported PtSn catalysts were synthesized and tested for propane dehydrogenation. Specific data shows PtSn-Al2O3-0.10 had the highest propylene yield and most stable selectivity (Quote 2). TEM imaging revealed Pt particle size was smaller and more uniform on Al2O3-0.10 support compared to Al2O3-0 (Quote 3), which is attributed to the number of hydroxyl groups on the surface.

5. 是的,本文评估了单金属负载的PtSn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。合成并测试了氧化铝负载的PtSn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。具体的数据显示PtSn-Al2O3-0.10具有最高的丙烯产率和最稳定的选择性(引文2)。TEM成像显示PtSn-Al2O3-0.10载体上的Pt颗粒大小更小更均匀,与Al2O3-0相比(引文3),这被归因于表面羟基的数量。

6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size and support interactions affect the performance of supported PtSn catalysts. TEM imaging showed Pt particles were smaller and more uniform on Al2O3-0.10 support, attributed to more hydroxyl groupsQuote 1). After reaction, Pt particles sintered less on Al2O3-0.10 (to 5 nm) than on Al2O3-0 (to 11 nm) (Quote 2), indicating Al2O3-0.10 suppressed sintering. Thus, smaller/more uniform Pt particles and stronger metal-support interactions contributed to better performance of PtSn-Al2O3-0.10 catalyst.

6. 是的,文章研究了像金属颗粒大小和支持体相互作用等性质如何影响负载PtSn催化剂的性能。TEM成像显示Pt粒子在Al2O3-0.10载体上更小更均匀,这是由于更多的羟基群(引文1)。反应后,Pt粒子在Al2O3-0.10上烧结更小(烧结至5 nm),而在Al2O3-0上烧结更严重(烧结至11 nm)(引文2),表明Al2O3-0.10抑制了烧结。因此,更小/更均一的Pt粒子和更强的金属-支持体相互作用有助于PtSn-Al2O3-0.10催化剂的更好性能。
