[1] "Ultrasound promoted the dispersion of Pt on the surface of the carrier during impregnation and decreased the size of Pt particles."
[2] "In comparison with the CS catalyst, the peak temperature and total acidity of the CU catalyst change slightly, indicating that ultrasound used in the impregnation of Pt and Sn has no obvious effects on the acidic intensity of catalysts." 
[3] "The synergetic effect of ultrasound on the impregnation of Pt can avoid excess concentration within the solution and provide a uniform environment for the nucleation and growth of metal particles, simultaneously hindering the agglomeration of Pt particles on the zeolite surface."
[4] "The common preparation method for the supported catalyst involves impregnation of the metal onto the support. This is a simple method that allows for easy dispersion of the active component onto the surface of the support."
[5] "For observing the dispersion of Pt metal on the surface of ZSM-5, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of different samples was carried out."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It compares conventional impregnation to ultrasound-assisted impregnation for dispersing Pt and Sn on a ZSM-5 zeolite support. The ultrasound method resulted in smaller Pt particle size and better dispersion compared to conventional impregnation, which was characterized by TEM imaging.

答:是的,该文献研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它比较了常规浸渍法和超声辅助浸渍法来将Pt和Sn分散在ZSM-5分子筛载体上。相比于常规浸渍法,超声法得到了更小的Pt颗粒大小和更好的分散度,这是通过TEM成像进行了表征。

[1] "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were conducted using JEM-2010 (Japan) instruments after each treatment. The average particle size of the Pt particles was based on the size measurements of more than 100 particles in randomly chosen regions in the magnified TEM images."
[2] "For the catalyst prepared by conventional impregnation (CS catalyst), the Pt particles are large (the average particle size is 6.4 nm) and most of them are agglomerated on the surface of ZSM-5 (Fig. 2a)." 
[3] "Conversely, an improvement in the control of the Pt particle size and dispersion can be achieved using ultrasound in the impregnation. The average particle size is 2.8 nm."

Answer: Yes, the article employs transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize metal-support interfaces and Pt particle size distributions in the propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It found that ultrasound-assisted impregnation produced smaller Pt nanoparticles (2.8 nm) with better dispersion compared to conventional impregnation, which had larger Pt particles (6.4 nm) that were more aggregated.

答:是的,该文献采用了透射电子显微镜(TEM)来表征丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-载体界面和Pt颗粒大小分布。结果发现,与常规浸渍法相比,超声辅助浸渍法制备的Pt纳米颗粒更小(2.8 nm),分散度更好,而常规浸渍法制备的Pt颗粒更大(6.4 nm),聚集程度更高。
