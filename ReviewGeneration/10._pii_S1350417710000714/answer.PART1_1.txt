[1] "ZSM-5 zeolite contains a wide range of Si/Al ratios to change its acidity and a special three-dimensional channel."

[2] "PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst is mainly due to the addition of Na."

[3] "The nominal composition of each sample was 0.5 wt% Pt, 1.0 wt% Sn, and 1.0 wt% Na."

[4] "The reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propene was studied in a conventional fixed-reactor at a constant temperature of 590 C under atmospheric pressure." 

[5] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of great interest due to the growing demand of propene as a basic petrochemical feedstock."

[6] "Bimetallic PtSn catalyst supported on alumina has been studied extensively as a dehydrogenation catalyst [1], [2], [3], [4]."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article evaluates a supported bimetallic PtSn catalyst on ZSM-5 zeolite for propane dehydrogenation. The nominal composition studied was 0.5 wt% Pt, 1.0 wt% Sn, and 1.0 wt% Na on ZSM-5. Propane dehydrogenation performance was evaluated in a fixed bed reactor at 590°C. PtSn/ZSM-5 was chosen due to prior work showing PtSn/Al2O3 is an effective dehydrogenation catalyst. The goal was to improve stability by using a zeolite support.

[1] "The PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst prepared by ultrasonic irradiation in the impregnation of Pt showed better catalytic activity and reaction stability."

[2] "Sonication can reduce the size of Pt particles and improve the amounts of Pt metal dispersed on the surface of the catalyst." 

[3] "Compared with the catalyst prepared by conventional impregnation, the supported catalyst prepared by ultrasonic irradiation showed better catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation."

[4] "Ultrasound promoted the dispersion of Pt on the surface of the carrier during impregnation and decreased the size of Pt particles."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how ultrasonic irradiation during impregnation affects Pt particle size and dispersion on the ZSM-5 support. It finds that ultrasonic irradiation leads to smaller Pt nanoparticles that are better dispersed on the support compared to conventional impregnation. This results in improved catalytic activity and stability for propane dehydrogenation over the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst.

答:本文研究了超声辐射在浸渍过程中如何影响Pt粒子在ZSM-5载体上的粒径和分散性。结果发现,与常规浸渍相比,超声辐射导致Pt纳米粒子更小,在载体上的分散性更好。这使PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂上丙烷脱氢的催化活性和稳定性得到改善。
