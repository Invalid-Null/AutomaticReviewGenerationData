To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the English answers across files for semantic equivalence. Where the answers expressed the same essential meaning, I marked them as 100% consistent. Answers with partial overlap in meaning were given intermediate consistency scores. Completely dissimilar answers were marked as 0% consistent.

I broke down the analysis question-by-question for each file's answers. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
