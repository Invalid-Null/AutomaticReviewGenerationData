<quotes>
[1] "ZSM-5 zeolite contains a wide range of Si/Al ratios to change its acidity and a special three-dimensional channel."

[2] "PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst is mainly due to the addition of Na."

[3] "The nominal composition of each sample was 0.5 wt% Pt, 1.0 wt% Sn, and 1.0 wt% Na."

[4] "The reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propene was studied in a conventional fixed-reactor at a constant temperature of 590 C under atmospheric pressure." 

[5] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of great interest due to the growing demand of propene as a basic petrochemical feedstock."

[6] "Bimetallic PtSn catalyst supported on alumina has been studied extensively as a dehydrogenation catalyst [1], [2], [3], [4]."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article evaluates a supported bimetallic PtSn catalyst on ZSM-5 zeolite for propane dehydrogenation. The nominal composition studied was 0.5 wt% Pt, 1.0 wt% Sn, and 1.0 wt% Na on ZSM-5. Propane dehydrogenation performance was evaluated in a fixed bed reactor at 590°C. PtSn/ZSM-5 was chosen due to prior work showing PtSn/Al2O3 is an effective dehydrogenation catalyst. The goal was to improve stability by using a zeolite support.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:本文评估了负载在ZSM-5沸石上的PtSn双金属催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。所研究的成分是0.5 wt% Pt、1.0 wt% Sn和1.0 wt% Na负载在ZSM-5上。在固定床反应器在590°C下评估了丙烷脱氢性能。由于之前的工作表明PtSn/Al2O3是有效的脱氢催化剂,因此选择了PtSn/ZSM-5。目标是通过使用沸石载体来提高稳定性。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "The PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst prepared by ultrasonic irradiation in the impregnation of Pt showed better catalytic activity and reaction stability."

[2] "Sonication can reduce the size of Pt particles and improve the amounts of Pt metal dispersed on the surface of the catalyst." 

[3] "Compared with the catalyst prepared by conventional impregnation, the supported catalyst prepared by ultrasonic irradiation showed better catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation."

[4] "Ultrasound promoted the dispersion of Pt on the surface of the carrier during impregnation and decreased the size of Pt particles."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how ultrasonic irradiation during impregnation affects Pt particle size and dispersion on the ZSM-5 support. It finds that ultrasonic irradiation leads to smaller Pt nanoparticles that are better dispersed on the support compared to conventional impregnation. This results in improved catalytic activity and stability for propane dehydrogenation over the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:本文研究了超声辐射在浸渍过程中如何影响Pt粒子在ZSM-5载体上的粒径和分散性。结果发现,与常规浸渍相比,超声辐射导致Pt纳米粒子更小,在载体上的分散性更好。这使PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂上丙烷脱氢的催化活性和稳定性得到改善。

<quotes>
[1] "It was found in our previous works that the ZSM-5 catalysts containing Pt, Sn and Na indicated good catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation reaction [9], [10], [11]."

[2] "ZSM-5 zeolite contains a wide range of Si/Al ratios to change its acidity and a special three-dimensional channel. The particular channel can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing so-called coke deposition and improving the catalytic stability."  

[3] "The nominal composition of each sample was 0.5 wt% Pt, 1.0 wt% Sn, and 1.0 wt% Na."

[4] "The reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propene was studied in a conventional fixed-reactor at a constant temperature of 590 C under atmospheric pressure." 

[5] "The propane dehydrogenation activity is a result of the common action by the active metal and ZSM-5 zeolite in the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst."

[6] "The higher conversion of propane is observed over the catalyst prepared by ultrasonic irradiation."

[7] "The activity of the CU catalyst slowly decreases with time; the conversion of propane decreases 1.1% after 8 h. In contrast, the activity of the CS catalyst decreases 5.6% over the same time period."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article evaluates supported trimetallic PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing 0.5 wt% Pt, 1.0 wt% Sn, 1.0 wt% Na on ZSM-5 has good catalytic performance. Propane dehydrogenation was studied in a fixed bed reactor at 590°C. The Cu catalyst prepared by ultrasonic irradiation showed higher propane conversion and stability than the conventionally prepared CS catalyst.

[3] "The propane dehydrogenation activity is a result of the common action by the active metal and ZSM-5 zeolite in the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst." 

[4] "The improvement of Pt dispersion on the surface of the CU catalyst not only accelerates the propane dehydrogenation to propene, but also promotes the hydrogenolysis of propane and the hydrogenation of ethane."

[5] "The application of ultrasonic irradiation in the preparation of catalyst did not destroy the structure of ZSM-5 and hardly affected the acidity of catalysts."

[6] "Sonication can reduce the size of Pt particles and improve the amounts of Pt metal dispersed on the surface of the catalyst."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how properties like zeolite acidity, channel structure, and Pt dispersion affect performance. ZSM-5 acidity and channels impact catalyst stability. Improved Pt dispersion from ultrasonic preparation increased propane conversion but lowered selectivity due to enhanced hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation side reactions.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 该文研究了诸如分子筛酸度、通道结构和Pt分散性等性质如何影响性能。ZSM-5的酸度和通道影响催化剂的稳定性。来自超声制备的Pt分散性提高增加了丙烷转化率,但由于加强的氢化裂解和氢化反应降低了选择性。
