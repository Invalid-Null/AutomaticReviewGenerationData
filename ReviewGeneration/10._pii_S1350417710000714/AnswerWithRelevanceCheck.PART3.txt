         [1] "Ultrasound promoted the dispersion of Pt on the surface of the carrier during impregnation and decreased the size of Pt particles." 
         [2] "The synergetic effect of ultrasound on the impregnation of Pt can avoid excess concentration within the solution and provide a uniform environment for the nucleation and growth of metal particles, simultaneously hindering the agglomeration of Pt particles on the zeolite surface [20]."
         [3] "The improvement of Pt dispersion on the surface of the CU catalyst not only accelerates the propane dehydrogenation to propene, but also promotes the hydrogenolysis of propane and the hydrogenation of ethane."

         Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using ultrasonic irradiation during impregnation to decrease Pt particle size and improve dispersion on the zeolite support. The ultrasound-prepared catalyst showed better propane dehydrogenation activity compared to conventional impregnation.

         [1] "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were conducted using JEM-2010 (Japan) instruments after each treatment. The average particle size of the Pt particles was based on the size measurements of more than 100 particles in randomly chosen regions in the magnified TEM images." 
         [2] "For the catalyst prepared by conventional impregnation (CS catalyst), the Pt particles are large (the average particle size is 6.4 nm) and most of them are agglomerated on the surface of ZSM-5 (Fig. 2a). Conversely, an improvement in the control of the Pt particle size and dispersion can be achieved using ultrasound in the impregnation. The average particle size is 2.8 nm."

         Answer: The article employs transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses TEM to measure Pt particle size distributions on the zeolite supports prepared with different methods. The TEM reveals that ultrasound irradiation during impregnation results in smaller and better dispersed Pt particles compared to conventional impregnation.

         答:这篇文章采用了透射电子显微镜(TEM)来表征丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-载体界面。它使用 TEM 来测量用不同方法制备的沸石载体上的 Pt 粒子大小分布。TEM结果显示,与常规浸渍法相比,超声辅助浸渍法得到了更小、更均匀分散的 Pt 粒子。
