<quotes>
[1] "The common preparation method for the supported catalyst involves impregnation of the metal onto the support. This is a simple method that allows for easy dispersion of the active component onto the surface of the support."

[2] "In comparison with the CS catalyst, the peak temperature and total acidity of the CU catalyst change slightly, indicating that ultrasound used in the impregnation of Pt and Sn has no obvious effects on the acidic intensity of catalysts."

[3] "For observing the dispersion of Pt metal on the surface of ZSM-5, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of different samples was carried out." 

[4] "The average particle size is 2.8 nm. The effect may be attributed to the acoustic cavitation phenomenon."

[5] "Compared with the catalyst prepared by conventional impregnation (CS catalyst), the Pt particles are large (the average particle size is 6.4 nm) and most of them are agglomerated on the surface of ZSM-5 (Fig. 2a)."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It compares conventional impregnation to ultrasound-assisted impregnation for dispersing Pt and Sn on a ZSM-5 zeolite support. The ultrasound method resulted in smaller Pt particle size (2.8 nm vs 6.4 nm) and better dispersion compared to conventional impregnation, which was attributed to acoustic cavitation effects. This was characterized by TEM imaging.

Answer: 是的,该文献研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它比较了常规浸渍法和超声辅助浸渍法来将Pt和Sn分散在ZSM-5分子筛载体上。相比于常规浸渍法,超声法得到了更小的Pt颗粒大小(2.8 nm vs 6.4 nm)和更好的分散度,这是由声化学空化效应引起的。这通过TEM成像进行了表征。

[1] "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were conducted using JEM-2010 (Japan) instruments after each treatment. The average particle size of the Pt particles was based on the size measurements of more than 100 particles in randomly chosen regions in the magnified TEM images."

[2] "For the catalyst prepared by conventional impregnation (CS catalyst), the Pt particles are large (the average particle size is 6.4 nm) and most of them are agglomerated on the surface of ZSM-5 (Fig. 2a)."

[3] "Conversely, an improvement in the control of the Pt particle size and dispersion can be achieved using ultrasound in the impregnation. The average particle size is 2.8 nm."

Answer: Yes, the article employs transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize metal-support interfaces and Pt particle size distributions in the propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It found that ultrasound-assisted impregnation produced smaller Pt nanoparticles (2.8 nm) with better dispersion compared to conventional impregnation, which had larger Pt particles (6.4 nm) that were more aggregated.
