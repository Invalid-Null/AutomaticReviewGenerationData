<quotes>
[1] "Ultrasound promoted the dispersion of Pt on the surface of the carrier during impregnation and decreased the size of Pt particles."

[2] "The synergetic effect of ultrasound on the impregnation of Pt can avoid excess concentration within the solution and provide a uniform environment for the nucleation and growth of metal particles, simultaneously hindering the agglomeration of Pt particles on the zeolite surface [20]."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it studies the use of ultrasonic irradiation during impregnation to improve dispersion of Pt particles on the zeolite support. The ultrasound is found to decrease Pt particle size and improve dispersion compared to conventional impregnation.

[1] "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were conducted using JEM-2010 (Japan) instruments after each treatment. The average particle size of the Pt particles was based on the size measurements of more than 100 particles in randomly chosen regions in the magnified TEM images."

[2] "For the catalyst prepared by conventional impregnation (CS catalyst), the Pt particles are large (the average particle size is 6.4 nm) and most of them are agglomerated on the surface of ZSM-5 (Fig. 2a). Conversely, an improvement in the control of the Pt particle size and dispersion can be achieved using ultrasound in the impregnation. The average particle size is 2.8 nm."

5. Yes, the article employs transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses TEM to measure Pt particle size distributions on the zeolite supports prepared with different methods. The TEM reveals that ultrasound irradiation during impregnation results in smaller and better dispersed Pt particles compared to conventional impregnation.
