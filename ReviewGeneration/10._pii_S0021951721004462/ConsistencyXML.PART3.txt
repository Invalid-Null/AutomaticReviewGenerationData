To determine the consistency percentages, I compared the key points made in each answer against the correct answers provided. For questions where the answers contained the same key relevant information as the correct answers, I assigned 100% consistency. For partial or completely inconsistent answers, I assigned percentages accordingly.

Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
