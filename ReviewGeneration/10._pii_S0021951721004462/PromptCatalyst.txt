Abstract
Co-based catalysts have attracted increasing attention as promising catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) because of their C–H bond activation ability. Co species in Co/Al2O3 are present in various forms, such as Co3O4, CoAl2O4, CoO, and metallic Co. However, the catalytic properties of the various Co species in PDH are unclear. In this work, we prepare Co/Al2O3 with different compositional distribution of Co species by heat-treating the supported Co precursor under O2, Ar, and H2 atmospheres at temperatures between 500 and 600 °C. H2-treated Co/Al2O3 results in superior performance compared to O2- and Ar-treated catalysts. This is attributed to the relatively high Co surface concentration and relatively high ratio of tetrahedral Co2+ stabilized in CoAl2O4 to the total Co species. A detailed study shows that both tetrahedral Co2+ and metallic Co in Co/Al2O3 are active for PDH, but the former is more selective.

1. Introduction
Propene is a key building block in the chemical industry for the production of versatile chemicals, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylic acid [1], [2]. Over the past years, the demand for propene has been steadily increasing with the huge growth in polypropylene consumption. Propene is mainly produced as a byproduct of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. The availability of low-priced propane from shale gas has attracted attention for the direct dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8
C3H6 + H2) as a promising route for propene production [3], [4], [5]. The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process requires a high reaction temperature of over 550 °C to achieve sufficient conversion because it is a highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited reaction. In commercial PDH processes, modified Pt- and Cr-based catalysts have been used because of their selective C–H bond activation over C–C bond activation under high-temperature conditions. However, the high cost of Pt-based catalysts and the high toxicity of Cr-based catalysts have motivated the development of alternative catalysts for PDH [6], [7], [8], [9], [10].
As an active component for PDH, Co species are of interest because of their catalytic ability for the C–H bond activation of light alkanes and non-toxicity [11], [12]. Co species can be present in various forms, such as Co3O4, CoO, and metallic Co, in supported catalysts and mixed oxides. The compositional distribution of several Co species significantly affects the performance of the Co-based catalysts in PDH. Previous studies have shown that support-stabilized tetrahedral (Td) Co2+ species result in the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene, whereas bulk Co3O4, CoO, and metallic Co result in severe side reactions, such as cracking and coking [13], [14], [15], [16]. Thus, a variety of synthetic strategies have been attempted to generate Td Co2+ sites and to improve their stability on SiO2 and zeolites [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. The mesoporous SiO2-stabilized Td Co2+ nanoclusters exhibited high selectivity (>94%) toward propene at 600 °C [16].
Alumina is one of the most widely used support materials in PDH owing to its high surface area and stability at temperatures above 550 °C [21], [22], [23], [24]. For Co/Al2O3 and Co-Al mixed oxides, the Td Co2+ species can be stabilized in the CoAl2O4 spinel structure. The Td Co2+ species embedded in CoAl2O4 exhibited high selectivity toward propene and high stability in PDH [13], [14], [15], [25]. In addition to the Td Co2+ species, metallic Co on Al2O3 has also been suggested as an active site for PDH. Although large metallic Co particles showed low selectivity during the induction period, well-dispersed metallic Co exhibited greatly enhanced selectivity toward propene [26]. A similar conclusion was drawn from the study of PDH over CoOx within dealuminated beta zeolite, in which metallic Co was generated by the reduction of CoOx during the reaction [27].
Various forms of Co species, including Co3O4, CoAl2O4, CoO, and metallic Co, can be formed in the Co/Al2O3 catalysts. The composition ratio of each Co species in the catalysts is significantly influenced by the preparation and pretreatment protocols [28], [29], [30]. The formation of the CoAl2O4 spinel structure is facilitated at calcination temperatures higher than 700 °C [28]. It can be promoted by heat-treating the Co precursor on Al2O3 under an N2 atmosphere rather than under an O2 atmosphere [29]. However, the effects of the heat-treatment conditions on the compositional distribution of Co species and, therefore, on the performance of Co/Al2O3 for PDH have not yet been studied in detail. In this work, a Co precursor impregnated onto γ-Al2O3, Co/Al2O3, was heat-treated under O2, Ar, and H2 atmospheres at temperatures between 500 and 600 °C. The changes in the Co species formed in the Co/Al2O3 catalysts were systematically investigated by identifying the type of Co species. The detailed role and catalytic properties of the various Co species in PDH were elucidated by comparing the catalytic performances of the Co/Al2O3 catalysts. The Co/Al2O3 catalysts prepared under controlled conditions exhibited higher propene formation rates than other representative metal oxide catalysts for PDH. Our results for the control of Co species by heat-treatment and the elucidation of their properties provide new insights into the development of Co-based catalysts for PDH.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Alumina-supported cobalt oxide catalysts, Co/Al2O3, were prepared by wet impregnation using a solution of Co(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar, 98%–102%). The Co precursor was dissolved in deionized water to prepare 5 wt% of Co/Al2O3. Afterward, a γ-Al2O3 support with a surface area of 140–170 m2⋅g−1 (Puralox SCCa 5/150, Sasol) was impregnated in the solution overnight at 55 °C under stirring. After evaporating the solvent, the sample was dried at 120 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, the Co/Al2O3 precursor was heat-treated at 550 °C for 6 h under different gas atmospheres: O2, Ar, and H2. The as-prepared catalysts were labeled as Co/Al2O3-x, where x denotes the gas atmosphere during the heat-treatment of the Co/Al2O3 precursor. Additionally, the Co/Al2O3 precursor was heat-treated under an H2 atmosphere at 500, 550, and 600 °C to investigate the effect of the heat-treatment temperature. The catalysts were labeled as Co/Al2O3-H2-y, where y denotes the temperature of the heat-treatment. To compare the catalytic performance of the Co/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH, 5 wt% of Ga/Al2O3 and 5 wt% of V/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by the same wet impregnation method using Ga(NO3)3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) and NH4VO3 (ACROS, 99.5%) precursors, respectively. The catalysts were calcined at 550 °C for 6 h. To identify the Co species in the Co/Al2O3 catalysts, Co3O4 (Sigma Aldrich), CoAl2O4 (Sigma Aldrich, ≥99%), CoO (Sigma Aldrich), and metallic Co (Sigma Aldrich, 99.8%) were used as reference samples.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The bulk compositions of the Co/Al2O3 catalysts were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) using a SPECTRO ARCOS FHM22 spectrometer. Nitrogen physisorption was carried out at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 system. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were calculated using data obtained over the relative pressure range of 0.05 ≤ p/p0 ≤ 0.2. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100F field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV at the National Institute for Nanomaterials Technology (NINT), Pohang, South Korea. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 20 mA with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.54 Å). Diffuse reflectance UV–visible spectroscopy (DR UV–Vis) was conducted using a Cary 5G UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Daegu, South Korea. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis was performed using a BELCAT II to investigate the reducibility of the catalysts. The sample was reduced in a stream of a 5 vol% H2/Ar gas mixture (total 30 sccm) from 100 °C to 1100 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The amount of consumed H2 was monitored using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements were simultaneously performed in the transmission and fluorescence modes at the P64 beamline, DESY, Hamburg, Germany. The normalization of the XANES data was performed following the standard procedure in the Athena software [31]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed by K-ALPHA XPS system using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) at the KBSI, Busan, South Korea. Near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) was performed using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) at the KBSI, Daejeon, South Korea. The analysis of the sample was conducted at 500 °C under UHV and H2 atmospheres (0.1 mbar). The binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Hitachi STA 7300 using 10 mg of the spent sample. The sample was charged into the sample pan and heated to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under an air flow (40 sccm). Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) measurements were conducted on a BELCAT II using 100 mg of the sample. After pretreatment, the ammonia-adsorbed sample was heated from 80 to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under He flow (30 sccm). The amount of ammonia desorbed from the sample was monitored using a mass spectrometer (m/z = 15). Raman spectra were obtained from the powder sample using WITec alpha 300 R confocal Raman microscope with a resolution of 2.5 cm−1 and an excitation wavelength of 532 nm.
2.3. Catalytic tests
The catalytic performance of Co/Al2O3-O2, Co/Al2O3-Ar, and Co/Al2O3-H2 for PDH was evaluated under ambient pressure using a tubular fixed-bed quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 4 mm. The reaction temperature was measured using a type-K thermocouple positioned at the top of the catalyst bed inside the quartz reactor. The powder catalyst (200 mg) was pelletized to obtain a uniform grain size for the performance test. Before the reaction, the reactor was heated to 550 °C, the reaction temperature, under Ar flow for 1 h. Subsequently, the loaded catalyst was pretreated in a flow of a 50 vol% H2/Ar gas mixture for 1 h. After purging the reactor with Ar for 15 min, a gas mixture of C3H8 at 1 sccm and Ar at 19 sccm (the weight hourly space velocity of propane (WHSVpropane) = 0.6 h−1) was introduced into the reactor to evaluate the catalytic performance. To estimate the apparent activation energy for propene formation, the propene formation rate was measured at 540–600 °C under differential reactor conditions. The catalyst of 50 mg was exposed to a 10 vol% C3H8/Ar gas mixture. The WHSVpropane was adjusted to 14.2–23.8 h−1 to maintain the conversion below 10%. The reactant and product gas compositions were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (YL6500, Younglin Instrument Co., Korea) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The propane conversion (Xpropane), activity per mass of Co (ACo), selectivity (Si), selectivity in gas products (Sgas-i), carbon balance (Cbalance), propene yield (Ypropene), and propene formation rate (rpropene) were calculated as follows:
where npropane is the number of moles of propane, Fpropane is the molar flow rate of propane, WCo is the weight of the Co, ai is the number of carbon atoms in the corresponding product, ni is the number of moles of the C1–C3 products (CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H6), ncarbon is the number of moles of carbon, Fpropene is the molar flow rate of propene, and Wcat is the weight of the catalyst.
3. Result and discussion
3.1. Characterization of Co/Al2O3–O2, Co/Al2O3–Ar, and Co/Al2O3–H2 catalysts
For the preparation of Co/Al2O3 catalysts, the Co precursor was impregnated onto γ-Al2O3, and thereafter, the Co/Al2O3 precursor was heat-treated at 550 °C under different gas atmospheres: O2, Ar, and H2. The Co content and surface area of the prepared Co/Al2O3–O2, Co/Al2O3–Ar, and Co/Al2O3–H2 are summarized in Table 1. All Co/Al2O3 catalysts showed nearly identical Co content, 5.2–5.4 wt%. The N2 physisorption results also showed that they have similar surface areas, 149–157 m2⋅g−1, and pore structures (Fig. S1). The representative TEM and EDS images of the Co/Al2O3 catalysts showed that the particles, consisting of various Co species, are well-dispersed on the support (Fig. S2).

In Co/Al2O3 catalysts, Co can be present in various species, such as Co3O4, CoAl2O4, CoO, and metallic Co. The preparation conditions significantly affect the compositional distribution of the Co species in the Co-based catalysts [15], [28], [29]. Following the heat-treatment of the Co/Al2O3 precursor under different atmospheres, the Co species were investigated by powder XRD (Fig. 1). The Co/Al2O3 catalysts exhibited noticeable diffraction peaks at 31.3°, 36.9°, 44.9°, 55.7°, 59.5°, and 65.4° compared to the support material, γ-Al2O3. These peaks were assigned to Co3O4 or CoAl2O4 spinel species, which were indistinguishable by XRD because of the appearance of the peaks at the same positions. Co/Al2O3-O2 and Co/Al2O3-Ar revealed sharper peaks than Co/Al2O3-H2 in the diffraction patterns. The difference seems to be attributed to the different crystallinities of the Co3O4 and CoAl2O4 species and their distribution in the catalysts. Interestingly, none of the catalysts exhibited diffraction peaks corresponding to CoO species and metallic Co species, regardless of the atmosphere used for the heat-treatment of the Co/Al2O3 precursor. These observations indicate that the as-prepared Co/Al2O3 catalysts have Co3O4 and/or CoAl2O4 as the main Co species.

DR UV–Vis spectroscopy was performed to identify the formed Co species, especially Co3O4 and CoAl2O4, in Co/Al2O3-O2, Co/Al2O3-Ar, and Co/Al2O3-H2. The reference Co3O4 sample showed two broad absorption peaks at 420 and 690 nm, corresponding to the ligand − metal charge transfers of O2– → Co2+ and O2– → Co3+ in Co3O4 species, respectively (Fig. S3) [32], [33], [34]. In contrast, the reference CoAl2O4 sample exhibited three distinct peaks at 540, 580, and 630 nm, assigned to the Td Co2+ in the CoAl2O4 spinel structure [25], [35]. The Co/Al2O3-O2 and Co/Al2O3-Ar exhibited similar spectra to that of the reference Co3O4 sample (Fig. 2). This observation indicates that the Co species in the Co/Al2O3 catalyst dominantly produced Co3O4 under O2 and Ar atmospheres. However, the Co/Al2O3-H2 catalyst exhibited three distinct peaks arising from Td Co2+, confirming that CoAl2O4 is a major species in the Co/Al2O3-H2 catalyst.

The effect of the gas atmosphere on the Co species in the Co/Al2O3 catalysts was further investigated by H2-TPR analysis (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Previous studies have shown that supported Co catalysts exhibit reduction peaks at higher temperatures than the unsupported bulk Co3O4 [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]. The Co/Al2O3 catalysts treated under different atmospheres also showed multiple reduction peaks up to 1100 °C. The first peak at 350–500 °C (peak α) corresponded to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO. The two subsequent broad peaks up to 800 °C (peak β) corresponded to the reduction of CoO to metallic Co. The two-step reduction process from Co3O4 to CoO to metallic Co over a wide range of temperatures was mainly due to the strong interactions between the Co species and Al2O3 on the interface [40]. It should be noted that the subsequent reduction peak can be attributed to not only the reduction of the CoO species formed during the thermal treatment of the Co/Al2O3 precursor, but also the reduction of that generated during the H2-TPR measurement. A comparison with the H2-TPR profile of the reference CoAl2O4 sample revealed that the last peak over 800 °C (peak γ) in the Co/Al2O3 catalysts was attributed to the reduction of thermally stable CoAl2O4 spinel species (Fig. S4(a)).

Fig. 3. H2-TPR profiles of the as-prepared Co/Al2O3-O2, Co/Al2O3-Ar, and Co/Al2O3-H2 catalysts.
The H2-TPR profiles of the Co/Al2O3 catalysts indicate that different Co species were formed depending on the gas atmosphere during the thermal treatment of the Co/Al2O3 precursor. The Co/Al2O3-O2 catalyst showed the sequential reduction of Co3O4 to CoO to metallic Co at 350–800 °C. Considering the thermal treatment conditions and the XRD result for the Co/Al2O3-O2 catalyst, the evolution of the subsequent broad peak can be interpreted as the reduction of the CoO generated from Co3O4 during H2-TPR, rather than the reduction of the CoO formed during the treatment of the Co/Al2O3 precursor. An additional broad peak over 800 °C showed the presence of a small amount of the CoAl2O4 species. Thus, these observations confirm that the Co species in Co/Al2O3-O2 mainly comprised Co3O4 with a minor amount of CoAl2O4.
The Co/Al2O3-Ar catalyst exhibited a similar H2-TPR profile to that of Co/Al2O3-O2, indicating that the treatment of the Co/Al2O3 precursor in the Ar atmosphere also resulted in the formation of Co3O4 as a major Co species. However, the change in the gas atmosphere resulted in a slight decrease in H2 consumption at 350–800 °C, arising from the sequential reduction of Co3O4 to CoO and metallic Co (Table 1). This suggests that, compared to the treatment in an O2 atmosphere, the treatment in Ar atmosphere relatively suppressed the formation of Co3O4. Conversely, the H2-TPR profile of Co/Al2O3-Ar exhibited a slightly increased H2 consumption over 800 °C. These observations show that, similar to Co/Al2O3-O2, Co/Al2O3-Ar possessed Co3O4 as the main species; however, it contained slightly more CoAl2O4.
The treatment of Co/Al2O3 precursor in H2 atmosphere resulted in the significantly different reduction behavior of Co/Al2O3-H2 compared to those of Co/Al2O3-O2 and Co/Al2O3-Ar. The disappearance of the peak at 350–500 °C indicates the absence of Co3O4 species in the Co/Al2O3-H2 catalyst. However, a small reduction peak at 500–800 °C, corresponding to the reduction of CoO species, was still observed. This suggests that treatment with H2 resulted in the formation of CoO as a minor species. A difference between Co/Al2O3-H2 and the other catalysts is that it exhibited an increased H2 consumption over 800 °C. This change revealed that the Co/Al2O3-H2 catalyst possessed CoAl2O4 as the dominant species. Therefore, our XRD, DR UV–Vis, and H2-TPR results confirmed that the gas atmospheres used to treat the Co/Al2O3 precursor significantly affected the Co species formed in the Co/Al2O3 catalysts. The Co species were dominantly present as Co3O4 in Co/Al2O3-O2, a mixed species of Co3O4 and CoAl2O4 in Co/Al2O3-Ar, and CoAl2O4 in Co/Al2O3-H2.
XANES analyses were also carried out to examine the change in the Co species in the Co/Al2O3 catalyst. The normalized XANES spectra at the Co K-edge of the Co/Al2O3 catalysts were compared to those of the reference samples, Co3O4 (Co2+ and Co3+), CoAl2O4 (Co2+), CoO (Co2+), and metallic Co foil (Co0), as shown in Fig. 4. Depending on the heat-treatment atmosphere, the Co/Al2O3 catalysts revealed different XANES spectra. Co/Al2O3-O2 (black line) exhibited a spectrum similar to that of the reference Co3O4 sample, indicating that the Co species in the Co/Al2O3 catalyst dominantly formed Co3O4 species under an O2 atmosphere. The XANES spectrum of Co/Al2O3-Ar (red line) showed an edge shift toward lower energy and a decrease in the white line intensity at 7729 eV compared to that of Co/Al2O3-O2. The spectrum resembled that of CoAl2O4 rather than that of CoO. These observations suggest that Co/Al2O3-Ar possessed a mixed species of Co3O4 and CoAl2O4. For the Co/Al2O3-H2 catalyst (blue line), the absorption edge and white line in the XANES spectrum were located at similar energy to those of the reference CoAl2O4 sample. This indicates that CoAl2O4 was the main Co species in the Co/Al2O3-H2 catalyst.

XPS analysis was carried out to identify the surface Co species and their concentrations. The Co 2p core-level spectra of the Co/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. The broad Co 2p3/2 peak in the spectra was deconvoluted into the peak at 780 eV, corresponding to Co3+, and the peak at 781.5 eV, corresponding to Co2+ [13], [15], [41]. However, no peak at 778 eV, corresponding to Co0, was observed in the spectra of the Co/Al2O3 catalysts [42]. The surface fractions of the Co species are listed in Table 2. The Co/Al2O3-O2 catalyst contained 62% of the Co3+ species and 38% of the Co2+ species on the surface, indicating that the Co3O4 species were predominant. For the Co/Al2O3-Ar catalyst, the ratio of Co3+ species decreased to 42%, while the ratio of Co2+ increased to 58%. As shown in the H2-TPR results, the increase in the ratio of the Co2+ species was associated with the formation of more CoAl2O4 species, resulting in a mixed species of Co3O4 and CoAl2O4. Interestingly, the Co/Al2O3-H2 catalyst showed only a peak arising from Co2+ in the Co 2p spectrum. The appearance of a single Co2+ peak in the NAP-XPS spectra under UHV and H2 atmospheres confirmed that the Co2+ species in Co/Al2O3-H2 were formed by the heat-treatment, not the re-oxidation of metallic Co under ambient air atmosphere (Fig. S5). This is in agreement with the XRD, DR UV–Vis, H2-TPR, and XANES observations that CoAl2O4 is dominant in Co/Al2O3-H2.

The values inside the parentheses are the yield obtained after 297 min, time-on-stream. Experimental conditions: T = 550 °C, atmospheric pressure, WHSVpropane = 0.6 h−1, 200 mg of catalyst, and total flow rate = 20 sccm.
The surface concentrations of Co on the Co/Al2O3 catalysts are listed in Table 2. A Co loading of 5 wt% on Al2O3 corresponded to a Co concentration of 4.3 mol%. However, the relatively low Co surface concentration of 1.4–3.7 mol% implies a deficiency of the Co species on the surface. This result showed that the gas atmosphere during the heat-treatment of the Co/Al2O3 precursor led to different chemical states and different surface concentrations of the Co species in the Co/Al2O3 catalysts. The noticeable surface deficiency for Co/Al2O3-O2, corresponding to 1.4 mol%, was attributed to the diffusion of Co cations into the sublayer of the Al2O3 support during the treatment under O2 [26], [37], [43]. The surface concentration of Co increased from Co/Al2O3-O2 to Co/Al2O3-Ar to Co/Al2O3-H2. Compared to Co/Al2O3-O2, the 2.5 times higher surface concentration of Co in Co/Al2O3-H2 showed that the treatment of Co/Al2O3 precursor under H2 was more effective in suppressing the Co diffusion into the sublayer.
3.2. Catalytic performance of Co/Al2O3–O2, Co/Al2O3–Ar, and Co/Al2O3–H2 on PDH
The catalytic performance of the Co/Al2O3 catalysts prepared under different atmospheres was evaluated for PDH at WHSVpropane = 0.6 h−1. All catalysts were pretreated with H2 at 550 °C before the catalytic tests. The catalytic properties including propane conversion, activity per mass of Co, propene selectivity, and propene yield are shown in Fig. 6. At the beginning of the reaction, the Co/Al2O3-O2 catalyst exhibited a remarkably high conversion of 97% but considerably low selectivity toward propene. The low propene selectivity in gas products and carbon balance in the initial reaction stage indicates that the Co/Al2O3-O2 catalyst undergoes severe side reactions by cracking and coking (Fig. S6). After a sharp drop in the conversion until a reaction time of 50 min, the conversion slowly decreased but the propene selectivity dramatically increased from 0% to 57%, resulting in propene yield of 12%. The change in the nature of the Co species from non-selective sites to propene selective sites during an induction period was associated with a change in the chemical state of the Co species by propane and/or the produced H2, as observed in many reducible metal oxides [26], [44], [45].

Co/Al2O3-Ar exhibited enhanced propene selectivity and yield compared to Co/Al2O3-O2, showing a relatively short induction period. Despite the improvement, the low propene selectivity in gas products and carbon balance at the beginning of the reaction revealed that the cracking and coking were initially dominant over the Co/Al2O3-Ar catalyst (Fig. S6). After a reaction time of 80 min, the propane yield reached 22%. Notably, the yield gap between Co/Al2O3-Ar and Co/Al2O3-O2 was maintained even after the induction period. This observation shows that the gas atmosphere during the heat-treatment of the Co/Al2O3 precursor can irreversibly change the Co species, and thus, the catalytic performance for PDH is limited.
Co/Al2O3-H2 exhibited the highest catalytic performance among the Co/Al2O3 catalysts. Interestingly, Co/Al2O3-H2 showed noticeably shorter induction period, exhibiting 25% propene yield even at the beginning of the reaction. It also exhibited high propene selectivity in gas products, 97%, showing that cracking was significantly suppressed (Fig. S6). This indicates that the most selective Co species for PDH was formed by the heat-treatment of the Co/Al2O3 precursor under an H2 atmosphere. Moreover, a comparison of the catalytic performance of Co/Al2O3 catalysts revealed that the control of the nature of Co species is a critical factor for improving the catalytic properties of Co-based catalysts. For the Co/Al2O3-H2 catalyst, the change in the catalytic performance was measured for 6 cycles of PDH (Fig. S7(a)). Despite a slight decrease in propene yield after the first cycle, the catalyst showed high stability, exhibiting propene yield of 22%–25% in 2–6 repeated cycles. No noticeable change was observed in XRD spectra of fresh and spent catalysts (Fig. S7(b)). This suggested that the deactivation during PDH was mainly attributed to coke formation.
An induction period during the PDH reaction is often observed for reducible metal oxide catalysts, including Co-based catalysts [30], [44], [45]. The noticeably low selectivity toward propene in this period is attributed to the cracking and coking of both reactant and products over non-selective species for PDH. The side reaction is suppressed as the non-selective species are reduced by the introduced propane and produced H2 during the reaction. To investigate the changes in the Co species of the Co/Al2O3 catalysts during the induction period, the pretreated and spent catalysts were further characterized by XPS (Fig. 7 and Table S1). Similar to the as-prepared Co/Al2O3 catalysts, the surface concentration of Co increased from Co/Al2O3-O2 to Co/Al2O3-Ar to Co/Al2O3-H2. For the as-prepared catalysts, Co3O4, a mixed species of Co3O4 and CoAl2O4, and CoAl2O4 were dominant in Co/Al2O3-O2, Co/Al2O3-Ar, and Co/Al2O3-H2, respectively. The Co 2p core-level spectra of the pretreated Co/Al2O3 catalysts exhibited the total disappearance of Co3+ species but the appearance of metallic Co species compared to those of the as-prepared Co/Al2O3 catalysts, shown in Fig. 5. The change in the Co 2p spectra indicates that the Co3O4 in Co/Al2O3-O2 and Co/Al2O3-Ar catalysts was reduced to CoO and metallic Co following the pretreatment in H2 atmosphere at 550 °C. Thus, it can be concluded that the pretreated Co/Al2O3 catalysts possessed Co species consisting of CoAl2O4 (Co2+), CoO (Co2+), and metallic Co (Co0). It is also noteworthy that as-prepared and pretreated Co/Al2O3-O2 exhibited similar peaks over 800 °C in H2-TPR spectra, corresponding to reduction of CoAl2O4 (Fig. S4(b)). This confirmed that the reductive pretreatment had no influence on the formation of CoAl2O4.

Experimental conditions: (a) T = 550 °C, atmospheric pressure, 50 vol% H2/Ar, 200 mg of catalyst, and total flow rate = 50 sccm (b) T = 550 °C, atmospheric pressure, WHSVpropane = 0.6 h−1, 200 mg of catalyst, and total flow rate = 20 sccm.
The Co 2p spectra of the spent Co/Al2O3 catalysts showed that a part of Co2+ was further reduced during PDH, forming more metallic Co species. Notably, Co/Al2O3-H2, in which CoAl2O4 was predominant on the surface, exhibited only a slight increase in the amount of metallic Co after the reaction. The observation in H2-TPR that CoAl2O4 was hardly reducible below 800 °C suggests that the formation of metallic Co species in Co/Al2O3 catalysts during the PDH was attributed to the reduction of CoO rather than CoAl2O4. The increase in the fraction of metallic Co species, which was mainly attributed to the reduction of CoO, was in the following order: Co/Al2O3-O2 > Co/Al2O3-Ar > Co/Al2O3-H2. This trend agrees with the duration of the induction period for the Co/Al2O3 catalysts in PDH. These characterization data combined with the performance results showed that CoO, which was initially present in Co/Al2O3-O2 and Co/Al2O3-Ar, led to severe side reactions during the induction period, whereas the hardly reducible CoAl2O4 in Co/Al2O3-H2 resulted in high selectivity toward propene.
The influence of the type of Co species on coke deposition behavior was examined. The total amount of coke deposited on the Co/Al2O3 catalysts is summarized in Table 2. Co/Al2O3-O2, with the highest amount of CoO and the longest induction period, showed the highest amount of coke, which was twice that of Co/Al2O3-H2. A comparison of the amount of coke deposited on Co/Al2O3-O2 after 2 h and 5 h of reaction revealed that most carbon deposition occurred on the CoO species during the induction period (Fig. S8). The surface acidity of H2-pretreated Co/Al2O3 catalysts was also investigated by NH3-TPD because the acidic properties might also affect the coke formation (Fig. S9). The Co/Al2O3 catalysts exhibited a similar NH3 desorption peak at 100–500 °C. The total amount of acid sites was 0.24 mmol⋅g−1 for Co/Al2O3-O2, 0.27 mmol⋅g−1 for Co/Al2O3-Ar, and 0.30 mmol⋅g−1 for Co/Al2O3-H2. The inverse trend in the number of acid sites and the amount of coke deposition shows that the type of Co species in the Co/Al2O3 catalysts is critical to the coke deposition behavior.
A comparison of the catalytic properties of the Co/Al2O3 catalysts showed that the heat-treatment of the Co/Al2O3 precursor in an H2 environment enhanced the propene selectivity and yield. The differences between Co/Al2O3-H2 and Co/Al2O3-O2 were observed in the surface concentration of Co and the composition of the Co species. Based on the TPR, XANES, and XPS results, it can be concluded that a relatively high Co surface concentration and more CoAl2O4 species on the surface result in the superior performance of Co/Al2O3-H2 compared to Co/Al2O3-O2. The role of the Td Co2+ species in the CoAl2O4 spinel structure as highly selective sites has been observed in alkane dehydrogenation [13], [14], [15], [25].
3.3. Effect of Co/Al2O3 precursor treatment temperature on the properties of Co/Al2O3-H2
To understand the influence of the treatment temperature on the properties of Co/Al2O3-H2, the Co/Al2O3 precursor was treated under an H2 atmosphere at different temperatures: 500, 550, and 600 °C. The XRD patterns of the Co/Al2O3-H2 catalysts showed that all catalysts exhibited a strong diffraction peak at 36.9° compared to that of γ-Al2O3 (Fig. 8). As described above, this confirms that the Co species in the as-prepared Co/Al2O3-H2 catalysts dominantly formed the CoAl2O4 species. However, the heat-treatment temperature affected the composition of the Co species in the Co/Al2O3-H2 catalysts. The Co/Al2O3-H2-500 catalyst, which was heat-treated at 500 °C, exhibited an additional peak at 42.4°, corresponding to the CoO species, but other catalysts did not. This observation suggests that the treatment at 500 °C results in the decomposition of the Co precursor, followed by the formation of the CoO species, but the treatment at higher temperatures results in the transformation of the CoO species to CoAl2O4.

The influence of the treatment temperature of the Co/Al2O3 precursor on the Co species formed in the Co/Al2O3-H2 catalysts was also observed in the H2-TPR profiles (Fig. 9). As previously mentioned, H2 consumption at 500–800 °C was attributed to the reduction of the CoO species to metallic Co, while that above 800 °C was ascribed to the reduction of the CoAl2O4 species. Co/Al2O3-H2-500 exhibited both reduction peaks, indicating the co-presence of CoO and CoAl2O4. This interpretation is consistent with the XRD results. The reductive treatment of the Co/Al2O3 precursor at relatively high temperatures resulted in a decrease in H2 consumption at 500–800 °C, but an increase in H2 consumption above 800 °C. Consequently, Co/Al2O3-H2-600 exhibited only a peak above 800 °C. This observation confirms that the formation of CoAl2O4 is preferred at higher treatment temperatures under a H2 atmosphere.

A comparison of the XPS data for the as-prepared Co/Al2O3-H2 catalysts showed that all catalysts possessed nearly identical surface concentrations of the Co species, 3.7–3.9 mol%, regardless of the temperature for the reductive treatment. They also exhibited only the peak arising from Co2+ in Co 2p, confirming the formation of CoAl2O4 and CoO as the dominant Co species (Fig. 10(a)). The catalytic performance of Co/Al2O3-H2 catalysts, obtained by the reductive treatment of the Co/Al2O3 precursor at 500, 550, and 600 °C, was measured at WHSVpropane = 0.6 h−1 (Fig. 11). They were pretreated using H2 at 550 °C before the catalytic tests. As the temperature for the reductive treatment of the Co/Al2O3 percursor increased, the propane conversion decreased but propene selectivity increased. The propene selectivity of Co/Al2O3-H2-600 reached 96%. This indicates that change in Co species significantly affect the catalytic properties. Among the Co/Al2O3-H2 catalysts, Co/Al2O3-H2-500 exhibited a noticeable induction period, which was attributed to the presence of CoO. The Co 2p spectrum for the spent Co/Al2O3-H2-500 showed that a considerable amount of metallic Co was formed by the reduction of CoO during the reaction (Fig. 10(b)). The formation of CoO was inhibited by increasing the temperature for the H2 treatment of the Co/Al2O3 precursor. Consequently, the amount of metallic Co in the spent Co/Al2O3-H2-550 and Co/Al2O3-H2-600 samples decreased, as shown in the Co 2p spectra. It is noteworthy that Co/Al2O3-H2-500 exhibited the highest propene yield after the induction period. The XPS spectra of the spent catalysts suggest that the co-presence of metallic Co and CoAl2O4 resulted in a higher performance of Co/Al2O3-H2-500 compared to other catalysts.

The influence of the treatment temperature on the change in the Co species was also observed in the amount of coke formed after the reaction. As the amount of CoO, which caused side reactions, such as cracking and coking, decreased with increasing treatment temperature, the amount of coke deposition significantly decreased from 24.3 to 11.8 to 4.5 wt%. The effect of Co species on the type of the coke was examined by derivative thermal gravimetry (DTG) analysis. The coke over Co/Al2O3-H2 catalysts was combusted at 300–700 °C (Fig. S10(a)). The combustion temperature of coke depends on the polymerization degree of coke species [46]. Disorderd coke results in combustion at relatively low temperature, whereas graphitic coke results in combustion at relatively high temperature. Analysis on coke formed between 2 h and 5 h of reaction can provide insight into the coke genereration over metallic Co and CoAl2O4 of Co/Al2O3-H2 catalysts because after induction period, the effect of CoO species can be excluded. As increasing heat-treatment temperature from 500 to 550 to 600 °C, the area ratio of peak D to peak G increased from 1.0 to 1.6 to 3.8. This indicates that CoAl2O4 generates more disordered coke, while metallic Co generates more graphitic coke. Raman spectra of the spent Co/Al2O3-H2 catalysts show that an increase in heat-treatment temperature led to an increase in ID/IG ratio (Fig. S10(b)). The D band at 1350 cm−1 is associated with in-plane defect and heteroatoms in coke structure, while the G band at 1584 cm−1 is associated with perfect graphitic structure [21]. Thus, this result also revealed that CoAl2O4 led to formation of more amorphous coke compared to metallic Co. In TEM image of the spent Co/Al2O3-H2-500, several filamentous carbons were observed (Fig. S11). This was consistent with relatively high molcarbon/molCo ratio, 30, for Co/Al2O3-H2-500. However, Co/Al2O3-H2-600, which mainly consists of CoAl2O4, showed amorphous carbons on the surface rather than filamentous coke.
To evaluate the performance of the Co/Al2O3-H2 catalysts, the propene formation rates of the catalysts were compared with those of the representative metal oxide catalysts for PDH, Ga/Al2O3, and V/Al2O3, under differential reactor conditions (Fig. 12(a)). Among the catalysts, Co/Al2O3-H2-500 exhibited the highest propene formation rate in the temperature range of 540–600 °C. Additionally, the apparent activation energies (Ea) for propene formation were estimated for the Co/Al2O3-H2, Ga/Al2O3, and V/Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 12(b)). Co/Al2O3-H2-500 and Co/Al2O3-H2-550 exhibited similar apparent activation energies of 82 kJ/mol and 80 kJ/mol, respectively. Conversely, Co/Al2O3-H2-600, predominantly comprised CoAl2O4 species, revealed a relatively high apparent activation energy of 101 kJ/mol. Nonetheless, the lower apparent activation energies of all Co/Al2O3-H2 catalysts than those of Ga/Al2O3 (122 kJ/mol) and V/Al2O3 (119 kJ/mol) suggest that Co-based catalysts can be promising alternative catalysts for PDH.

The characterization and performance results of the Co/Al2O3-H2 catalysts indicate that both Td Co2+ in CoAl2O4 and metallic Co are active species for PDH. To further clarify the role of Td Co2+ and metallic Co in PDH, the propene to coke ratio (Cpropene/Ccoke) and propene yield were plotted as a function of the fraction of Co2+ estimated from the XPS results of the spent catalysts (Fig. 13 and Table S2). The propene to coke ratio represents propene selectivity, while propene yield represents productivity. The reaction was performed at similar degree of propane conversion, around 20% at 2 h of reaction, to exclude the effect of the difference in propane conversion on product selectivity. The estimated values for product selectivity, yield, and amount of coke deposition were based on the measurements between 2 h and 5 h of reaction to exclude the significant change in the Co species during the induction period. As the fraction of Co2+ increased, the propene to coke ratio increased. Consequently, the Co/Al2O3-H2-600 exhibited ca. 2 times higher propene to coke ratio, 15.4, than Co/Al2O3-H2-500, 8.2. However, the propene yield decreased from 4.7 mmol⋅g−1⋅h−1 for Co/Al2O3-H2-500 to 2.2 mmol⋅g−1⋅h−1 for Co/Al2O3-H2-600 as the fraction of Co2+ increased. These results show that both Td Co2+ in CoAl2O4 and metallic Co are active; however, their intrinsic properties in PDH are slightly different. Td Co2+ is more selective toward the formation of propene, while metallic Co is more active for the activation of propane. Thus, the delicate control of the Co species in the preparation stage is critical for improving the catalytic performance of the Co/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH.

4. Conclusion
In this work, Co/Al2O3–O2, Co/Al2O3–Ar, and Co/Al2O3–H2 catalysts were prepared by heat-treating the Co/Al2O3 precursor under different gas atmospheres. The as-prepared catalysts formed different Co species: Co3O4 for Co/Al2O3–O2, a mixed species of Co3O4 and CoAl2O4 for Co/Al2O3–Ar, and CoAl2O4 for Co/Al2O3–H2, depending on the atmosphere. The pretreated Co/Al2O3-H2 afforded the highest catalytic performance for PDH, while the pretreated Co/Al2O3–O2 resulted in the lowest performance, showing severe side reactions, cracking and coking, during the induction period. The superior performance of Co/Al2O3–H2 was attributed to the presence of Td Co2+ in the CoAl2O4 species and its relatively high surface concentration. In contrast, the inferior selectivity toward the propene of Co/Al2O3–O2 was ascribed to the presence of the CoO species, which are formed from Co3O4 during reductive pretreatment. The heat-treatment temperature for the Co/Al2O3 precursor under H2 altered the ratio of the two main Co species, CoAl2O4 and CoO. As the temperature increased from 500 to 600 °C, the fraction of CoAl2O4 on the surface of the as-prepared Co/Al2O3-H2 increased. The reductive environment in PDH caused the reduction of CoO to metallic Co, resulting in the mixed species of CoAl2O4 and metallic Co in the Co/Al2O3-H2 catalysts. A comparison of the catalytic performance and the formed Co species shows that the Td Co2+ in CoAl2O4 is more selective, while both Td Co2+ and metallic Co are active in PDH.
