 Here is the comparison of the answer files against the correct answers in JSON format:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", 
    "answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%", 
    "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_1.txt": "50%",
    "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "3": {
    "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "4": {
    "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "5": {
    "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "6": {
    "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "7": {
    "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"
  }
}
```

To generate this, I parsed the correct answer file to extract the answers for each question number. Then for each answer file, I compared it question-by-question to the correct answers, calculated a consistency percentage, and populated the JSON structure with the results.
