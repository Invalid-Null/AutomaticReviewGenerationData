<quotes>

[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts show higher activity, selectivity and stability in light paraffin dehydrogenation. The effects of Sn on Pt have been widely researched, and it is well accepted that the addition of Sn leads Pt particle size to decrease and improve its catalytic performances [15], [16], [17], [18]."

[2] "Compared to the monometal catalyst (0.3Pt/Al), a distinct decrease of ammonia desorption intensity is observed after the impregnation of Sn or In (0.3PtSn/Al or 0.3Pt/1.5InAl). From Table 2, it can be seen that the fractions of peaks I and II increase and the fraction of peak III evidently decreases with the addition of Sn and In in the catalysts, which indicates the decrease of ammonia desorption intensity is mainly ascribed to the loss of stronger acid sites."

[3] "The evolution of the catalytic performances over the synthesized catalysts with different metallic compositions can be explained as following. First, according to the TEM images in Fig. 4, the smaller particle size and more homogeneous distribution of Pt are obtained after adding In or/and Sn constitutions in the catalysts, which is favor of improving the catalytic performances because much more metallic active sites are exposed." 

</quotes>

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that adding Sn to Pt catalysts leads to smaller Pt particle size and improves catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity and stability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The addition of Sn also decreases the fraction of strong acid sites, improving selectivity.

2. 是的,文章评估了Pt-Sn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它显示添加Sn到Pt催化剂导致较小的Pt颗粒大小,并提高催化性能,如活性、选择性和稳定性,与单金属Pt催化剂相比。添加Sn还减少了强酸位的比例,提高了选择性。
