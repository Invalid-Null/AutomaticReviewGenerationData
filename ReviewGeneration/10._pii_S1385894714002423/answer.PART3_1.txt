[1] "Bimetallic PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts promoted by doping indium(In) for propane dehydrogenation are investigated with several state-of-art characterizations such as BET, XRD, NH3-TPD, TEM, XPS, H2-TPR and TPO."  

[2] "The TEM images show that platinum particle size decreases with the addition of tin and/or indium. The mean metallic particle size for 0.3Pt/Al, 0.3PtSn/Al, and 0.3PtSn/1.5InAl is 17.9, 12.1 and 10.8 nm, respectively."

[3] "These results indicate that adding Sn is in favor of the uniform distribution of Pt component on the support. On the other hand, indium doping on PtSn/Al catalyst is more conducive to decrease the size of Pt particles because of the dilution effect of platinum in presence of In and Sn [47]."

3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies the effects of adding tin and indium promoters on the dispersion of platinum particles on alumina supports. TEM results show smaller and more uniform platinum particles when tin and indium are added due to dilution effects.

[1] "The TEM images of the catalysts were conducted and shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a illustrates a wide distribution of Pt particle size and a bad dispersion of metallic particles for monometallic 0.3Pt/Al catalyst. Fig. 4b displays a more homogeneous distribution of Pt particles for 0.3PtSn/Al catalyst."

[2] "As can be seen from Fig. 4, the best homogeneous distribution of metallic particles can be seen for 0.3PtSn/1.5InAl catalyst. The mean metallic particle size for 0.3Pt/Al, 0.3PtSn/Al, and 0.3PtSn/1.5InAl is 17.9, 12.1 and 10.8 nm, respectively."

[1] "Fig. 2 shows the XPS spectra corresponding to Sn3d5/2 level of 0.3PtSn/Al and 0.3PtSn/1.5InAl catalysts after reduction at 580 C, respectively."

[2] "Fig. 3 displays the In3d spectra of 0.3Pt/1.5InAl and 0.3PtSn/1.5InAl catalysts after reduction at 580 C. In all cases the In3d5/2 level is deconvoluted into two specifics: one at lower binding energy of 444.1 eV and the other at higher binding energy of 445.1-445.2 eV." 

[3] "The XPS and H2-TPR analysis verifies the effects of In and Sn on Pt sites and the interactions among three metals, which could lead to alloy formation(PtSn or PtIn)."

<English version answer>
6. Answer: Yes, the article uses XPS spectroscopy to probe the oxidation state changes of tin, indium, and platinum in the catalysts after high temperature reduction treatments. The XPS data provides evidence for alloy formation between Pt, Sn, and In in the reduced catalysts.
