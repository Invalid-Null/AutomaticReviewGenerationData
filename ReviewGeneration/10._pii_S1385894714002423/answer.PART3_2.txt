<quotes>
[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts promoted by doping indium(In) for propane dehydrogenation are investigated with several state-of-art characterizations such as BET, XRD, NH3-TPD, TEM, XPS, H2-TPR and TPO."

[2] "The TEM images show that platinum particle size decreases with the addition of tin and/or indium. The mean particle size of platinum is around 10 nm for 0.3PtSn/1.5InAl catalyst because of the dilution effect of In and Sn."

[3] "The XPS and H2-TPR analysis verifies the effects of In and Sn on Pt sites and the interactions among three metals, which could lead to alloy formation(PtSn or PtIn)."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies the effects of adding Sn and In promoters to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. TEM data shows smaller and more evenly dispersed Pt particles for PtSnIn/Al2O3 compared to Pt/Al2O3 due to the dilution effect of Sn and In. XPS and H2-TPR verify interactions between Pt, Sn, and In leading to alloy formation, which helps maintain dispersion.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文献研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它研究了向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加Sn和In促进剂的效果。TEM数据显示,与Pt/Al2O3相比,PtSnIn/Al2O3上的Pt颗粒更小、更均匀分散,这是Sn和In的稀释效应所致。XPS和H2-TPR证实了Pt、Sn和In之间的相互作用导致了合金的形成,这有助于维持分散效果。

Answer: No, the article does not utilize any in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses ex-situ techniques like XRD, XPS, TEM, TPR, TPO to characterize the fresh and used catalysts.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:不,该文献没有利用任何原位表征技术来研究工作中的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它使用体外技术,如XRD、XPS、TEM、TPR、TPO来表征新鲜和使用后的催化剂。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "The surface morphology and particle size of the as-synthesized catalysts were observed by a transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL JEM2010)."

[2] "Fig. 4a illustrates a wide distribution of Pt particle size and a bad dispersion of metallic particles for monometallic 0.3Pt/Al catalyst. Fig. 4b displays a more homogeneous distribution of Pt particles for 0.3PtSn/Al catalyst. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the best homogeneous distribution of metallic particles can be seen for 0.3PtSn/1.5InAl catalyst."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article employs TEM microscopy to characterize metal-support interfaces and dispersion in the propane dehydrogenation catalysts. TEM images show smaller, more evenly dispersed Pt particles for PtSnIn/Al2O3 compared to Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 due to the dilution effect of In and Sn.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文献采用TEM显微技术表征丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-支持体界面和分散效果。TEM图像显示,与Pt/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3相比,PtSnIn/Al2O3上的Pt颗粒更小、分散更均匀,这是In和Sn的稀释效应所致。
