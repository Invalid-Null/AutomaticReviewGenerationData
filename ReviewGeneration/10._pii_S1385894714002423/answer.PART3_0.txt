[1] "In this work, the catalytic performances of Al2O3-supported PtSnIn trimetallic catalysts were synthesized and investigated for propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Compared to 0.3Pt/Al and 0.3PtSn/Al catalysts, the catalytic performances for 0.3Pt/1.5InAl catalyst are further improved with an initial propane conversion of 53.11% and a stable propylene selectivity about 93%."

[3] "The 0.3PtSn/xInAl catalysts with loadings 0.5-2.5 wt.% indium exhibit highly efficient performances for propane dehydrogenation reaction."

3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies the effects of adding Sn and In promoters to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, finding that adding Sn and In leads to smaller, more uniformly dispersed Pt particles compared to Pt/Al2O3 alone. This improves catalytic performance.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
3. 答:是的,文中研究了优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。文中研究了在Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加Sn和In的效果,发现与仅有Pt/Al2O3相比,添加Sn和In使Pt粒子变小、分散更均匀。这改善了催化性能。

4. Answer: No, the article does not utilize any in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It relies on ex-situ techniques like XRD, XPS, TEM, TPR, TPO, etc.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
4. 答:不,文中没有应用任何原位表征技术来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。文中依赖XRD、XPS、TEM、TPR、TPO等各种离位技术。

[1] "The surface morphology and particle size of the as-synthesized catalysts were observed by a transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL JEM2010)." 

[2] "Fig. 4 shows the TEM images of the catalysts after reduction at 580 C, respectively. Fig. 4a illustrates a wide distribution of Pt particle size and a bad dispersion of metallic particles for monometallic 0.3Pt/Al catalyst. Fig. 4b displays a more homogeneous distribution of Pt particles for 0.3PtSn/Al catalyst. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the best homogeneous distribution of metallic particles can be seen for 0.3PtSn/1.5InAl catalyst."

5. Answer: Yes, the article employs TEM microscopy to characterize metal-support interfaces and particle size/dispersion in the propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It finds adding Sn and In results in smaller, more uniformly dispersed Pt particles compared to Pt/Al2O3 alone.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
5. 答:是的,文中采用TEM显微技术表征了丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-载体界面和粒子大小/分散性。结果发现,与仅有Pt/Al2O3相比,添加Sn和In使Pt粒子变小、分散更均匀。

6. Answer: No, the article does not use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It uses XPS to study catalysts after reduction but not during catalytic reaction.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
6. 答:不,文中没有采用X射线技术来研究丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。文中仅采用XPS技术表征了催化剂在还原后的状态,而不是在催化反应过程中。
