Abstract
Bimetallic PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts promoted by doping indium(In) for propane dehydrogenation are investigated with several state-of-art characterizations such as BET, XRD, NH3-TPD, TEM, XPS, H2-TPR and TPO. The results show that the indium addition evidently improves the catalytic performances and stability of PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The NH3-TPD profiles verify a decrease in acidity for the supports with the addition of indium. Metallic Sn and In or PtSn alloy and PtIn alloy are detected by XPS spectra on the catalysts after reduction. The presence of indium in the PtSn/In–Al2O3 catalysts not only could maintain the catalytic active and propylene selectivity, but also could suppress the hydrogenolysis reaction during propane dehydrogenation process. The high activity (conversion > 41.0%) and perfect propylene selectivity (selectivity > 96%) are obtained in propane dehydrogenation after reaction for 53 h.
1. Introduction
Due to the growing demand of propylene, propane dehydrogenation receives much attention as a potential way to produce propylene [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Chromium-based and platinum(Pt)-based catalysts are the most widely studied in propane dehydrogenation reaction [4], [5], [6]. Among them, Pt-based catalysts have gained much more attention because of its high catalytic performance and eco-friendly property. In other side, fixed bed reactor, fluidized bed reactor and membrane reactor are the common reactors for light alkanes dehydrogenation [7], [8], [9], [10], [11].
Pt or platinum-tin (Pt–Sn) catalysts are widely used in light alkanes transformation reactions [12], [13], [14]. Compared to monometallic Pt supported catalysts, bimetallic Pt–Sn catalysts show higher activity, selectivity and stability in light paraffin dehydrogenation. The effects of Sn on Pt have been widely researched, and it is well accepted that the addition of Sn leads Pt particle size to decrease and improve its catalytic performances [15], [16], [17], [18]. Furthermore, the bond strength of chemisorbed hydrocarbons may be modified by adding Sn, which may form an alloy with Pt [19], [20]. Although platinum-tin-alumina (Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3) supported catalysts have been considered as one of the most efficient catalysts for light paraffin dehydrogenation, deactivation is still unavoidable. It results in the short regeneration period of catalyst. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the stability of Pt–Sn or Pt catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation reaction.
To resolve this problem, doping the third metal in the catalysts looks like a proper method to improve the catalytic dehydrogenation performances. Rare earth elements, such as lanthanum (La) and cerium (Ce), have been involved to modify Pt–Sn catalysts [20], [21], [22]. Yu et al. [22] reported that a mean propylene yield of 37% was obtained over PtSn/Ce-Al2O3 catalysts at 580 °C with a GHSV of 3800 h−1 in 50 h. Alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, such as Na, K and Mg, are also advantageous to the stability of Pt–Sn catalysts [23], [24], [25]. Bai et al. [25] reported that the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 exhibited better catalytic performances after addition of 0.5 wt.% Mg in terms of propane conversion and stability. Besides Pt–Sn catalysts, other bimetallic systems such as Pt–In and Pt–Ga catalysts also show distinct catalytic behaviors in light alkane dehydrogenation [26], [27], [28]. The addition of Ga or In in Pt/Al2O3 could improve stability and selectivity of catalysts and suppress hydrogenolysis [29], [30]. Jablonski et al. [29] found that the catalyst deactivation and the carbon formation were weakened by adding Ga in Pt/Al2O3 catalysts.
Many studies have focused on the effects of Sn in Pt–Sn catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, but there is interest in determining the PtSn/In–Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation performance and the interactions between Pt, Sn and In. In this work, the catalytic performances of Al2O3-supported Pt–Sn–In trimetallic catalysts were synthesized and investigated for propane dehydrogenation. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by state-of-the-art analytical techniques: BET, XRD, XPS, TEM, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR and TPO.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
γ-Al2O3 in powder form (SBET: ⩾200 m2/g, 60–80 mesh, labeled as Al) used as carrier was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). Indium nitrate (In(NO3)3·5H2O), tin(II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O) and chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) were also purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China).
2.2. Catalyst preparation
The Pt/Al catalyst was prepared by impregnating γ-Al2O3 support in the aqueous solution of Pt precursor (H2PtCl6). After impregnation, the sample was dried at 120 °C for 10 h and then calcined at 550 °C in air for 4 h. For the PtSn/Al and Pt/In–Al catalysts, Sn or In was first deposited on the carrier by impregnating SnCl2 ethanol solution or In(NO3)3 aqueous solution, then dried and calcined, and finally Pt component was introduced by impregnating the samples in H2PtCl6 aqueous solution. In the case of PtSn/In–Al catalysts, Sn and In were firstly deposited by co-impregnating SnCl2 and In(NO3)3 ethanol solution, then dried and calcined. Finally, Pt component was introduced as described previously. In all cases, the loading of Sn was 0.6 wt.% and the loading of Pt was 0.3% or 0.6 wt.%. The synthesized catalysts were designated as follows: Pt/Al for Pt supported on γ-Al2O3, PtSn/Al for platinum-tin supported on γ-Al2O3 and PtSn/xIn–Al for platinum-tin-indium supported on γ-Al2O3, where x represents In mass content in the catalysts. The detailed preparation parameters and sample labels are summarized in Table 1. The Sn/Al(only doping Sn) and 1.5In–Al(only doping In) samples were also prepared with the same method for comparative study.

2.3. Catalyst characterizations
2.3.1. Low temperature N2 adsorption/desorption
The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the samples were determined at liquid nitrogen temperature on an automatic analyzer (NOVA 4000, Quantachrome, USA). The samples were degassed for 4 h under vacuum at 300 °C prior to adsorption. The BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) surface area of the samples was determined by the multi-point method. The pore structural data were analyzed by BJH (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda) method using Halsey equation for multilayer thickness. The total pore volume were analyzed by BJH method cumulative desorption pore volume. The pore size distribution curves were deduced from the desorption branches of isotherms.
2.3.2. X-ray diffraction
X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples were collected on a Bragg–Brentano diffractometer (Rigaku D/Max-2000) with monochromatic Cu Ka radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) of graphite curve monochromator. The X-ray diffraction data were collected from (10–80°, 2θ), a 2θ scanning rate of 4°/min.
2.3.3. NH3-TPD
The acidity of the synthesized catalysts was measured by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD). The sample (0.05 g) was placed into a quartz reactor between two quartz wool plugs. The sample was treated by flowing dry argon (99.99%) at 400 °C for 1 h prior to ammonia adsorption. Then, the samples were saturated by an ammonia adsorption at 120 °C. Before measuring, the system was stabilized in dry argon (30 mL/min) at the same temperature for 0.5 h. Subsequently, the temperature increased to 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The NH3 desorption profiles were recorded with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
2.3.4. H2-TPR
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out for the catalysts in a programmable temperature system. The sample (0.2 g) was filled in a quartz reactor. Prior to TPR analysis, the sample was treated in situ by flowing dry argon (15 mL/min) at 500 °C for 1 h. Before measuring the baseline was stabilized in the gas flow at 25 °C for 60 min. The reactor was heated in a temperature-programmed furnace from room temperature to 800 °C (10 °C/min). The H2 and Ar mixed gas (10% (v/v) H2) was used as a reducing gas. The H2 consumption as a function of reduction temperature was continuously monitored with a TCD (thermal conductivity detector) cell and recorded.
2.3.5. TEM
The surface morphology and particle size of the as-synthesized catalysts were observed by a transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL JEM2010).
2.3.6. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS)
The surface electronic states of the catalyst samples after reduction were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Perkin–Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA using Al Kα radiation). All samples were dried in pure Ar atmosphere before measurements. The binding energy (BE) values were calibrated using C 1s = 284.8 eV as a reference.
2.3.7. TPO
In the experiments of temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of coke, the used samples (0.15 g) were purged in an Ar flow (30 mL/min) at 500 °C for 30 min and then heated to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C /min in a 2% O2/He mixture (30 mL/min).
2.4. Propane dehydrogenation reaction
The propane dehydrogenation reactions over different catalysts were carried out in a flow reactor at atmospheric pressure. A sample (0.3 g), placed in a quartz fixed-bed reactor (8 mm in diameter), was previously reduced by H2 (11.2 mL/min) at 580 °C for 2.5 h. Then the feed flow composed of H2, C3H8 and Ar (H2:C3H8:Ar (molar ratio) = 7:8:35) was fed to the reactor. The purity of propane is above 99.9%. The total GHSV was 1500 h−1. The gas compositions containing reactants and products from reactor exit were analyzed by a gas chromatography (GC, SP-6980) equipped with an AT-PLOT PORA-Q capillary column and a FID chromatographic system. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated as follows:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterizations of the samples
3.1.1. Low temperature N2 adsorption/desorption analysis of samples
Table 1 illustrates the textural parameters of the samples determined by N2 adsorption/desorption measurements. Apparently, these results indicate that a small amounts of Pt or/and Sn have little influence on the SBET of carrier. However, the specific surface area and pore volume (Vp) of the PtSn/xIn–Al catalysts slightly decrease with the increase of indium oxide loading. Thus, the results imply that more indium addition might enter the channels of support and lead part channels to be blocked. The 0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst has a higher Vp value and a similar SBET to that of 0.6PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst. It is well-known that the pore diameter (Dp) of support is mueter of Pt metal particles and tin species [31]. Thus, an interpretation might be that more and more Pt species is existed inside the channel of support during the preparation process of catalysts [32].
3.1.2. XRD patterns of samples
Fig. S1(A, B) shows the X-ray diffraction spectra of the catalysts after reduction. It can be seen from Fig. S1(A, B) and Table 1 that the characteristic peaks (37.6°, 45.8° and 66.8°) of γ-Al2O3 are identified, implying that γ-Al2O3 structure is not destroyed during the catalyst preparation. The diffraction peaks of Pt, Sn and In species are not detected for all samples due to their small particle size and/or low concentration below XRD detection limit. Fig. S1(B) shows that the diffraction peaks have no conspicuous variation with In or Pt addition, which is similar to other supported catalysts [33]. Fig. S1(B) also shows that no diffraction lines other than those of the supports are observed in the samples with low content.
3.1.3. Surface acidity analysis
The dehydrogenation of light paraffin is greatly dependent on the acidity of catalysts, which can be determined by NH3-TPD method. The NH3-TPD curves of several representative catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 1. A semi-quantitative analysis of the adsorption strength distribution was achieved by deconvoluting the peaks using normal distribution function [22] and provided in Table 2. For all samples, a broad desorption peak with a maximum at 170–200 °C and a shoulder at higher temperature (250–320 °C) are visible. The low temperature peak (peak I and II) can be ascribed to weak and medium strength acid sites, whereas the peak (peak III) above 250 °C is typical of strong acidity sites. It can be seen that the total acidity of the samples has not evident variation between pure carrier and 0.3Pt/Al or between 1.5In–Al and 0.3Pt/1.5In–Al. Compared to the monometal catalyst (0.3Pt/Al), a distinct decrease of ammonia desorption intensity is observed after the impregnation of Sn or In (0.3PtSn/Al or 0.3Pt/1.5In–Al). From Table 2, it can be seen that the fractions of peaks I and II increase and the fraction of peak III evidently decreases with the addition of Sn and In in the catalysts, which indicates the decrease of ammonia desorption intensity is mainly ascribed to the loss of stronger acid sites. Furthermore, though the total acid strength is slightly higher than that of 0.3PtSn/Al or 0.3Pt/1.5In–Al catalyst, the fraction of stronger acid of 0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst is lower than that of these two catalysts. The total acidic sites decreasing with the addition of In is in agreement with the experimental results of Passos et al. [34] and Rodríguez-González et al. [35], [36]. Gervasini et al. proposed that indium oxide can be regard as basic [33]. This result suggests that the loading of indium component can partly neutralize the acid sites, especial the stronger acid sites of support. Previous studies demonstrated that side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymerization) were mainly catalyzed by the existence of strong acid sites on the surface of catalysts [37]. From this point of view, the presence of In with the suitable content in the catalysts may suppress the undesired reactions and improve the propylene selectivity. This will be further discussed in the following section.

3.1.4. XPS analysis of catalysts
Fig. 2 shows the XPS spectra corresponding to Sn3d5/2 level of 0.3PtSn/Al and 0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al catalysts after reduction at 580 °C, respectively. From the deconvolution of the spectrum of 0.3PtSn/Al catalyst, three peaks were obtained at 485.5, 486.3 and 487.1 eV, corresponding to different chemical states of Sn. The peak at low binding energy (485.5 eV) corresponds to zerovalent Sn or alloy (SnPtx) state; while other two peaks at 486.3 and 487.1 eV correspond to oxidation states of Sn [38], [39]. From the deconvolution of the spectrum of 0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al, there also are three peaks with similar binding energy values (485.7, 486.6 and 487.5 eV) to 0.3PtSn/Al catalyst. It is difficult to discriminate between Sn4+ and Sn2+ according to XPS spectra because their binding energy is very close [40]. According to the peak percentage given in parentheses in Table 3, the zerovalent Sn percentage of PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst (26%) is slightly lower than that of PtSn/Al catalyst (29%). Compared to the reference SnPt/Al catalyst, the decreased zerovalent Sn ratio of PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst is attributed to the formation of Sn−O−In bonding with addition of indium [41]. Meanwhile, the metal Sn also can be alloyed with Pt, and the similar results have already been detected by XPS in bimetallic PtSn catalysts [42], [43]. These results indicate that the presence of indium lightly modifies PtSn alloy formation in 0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst.

Fig. 3 displays the In3d spectra of 0.3Pt/1.5In–Al and 0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al catalysts after reduction at 580 °C. In all cases the In3d5/2 level is deconvoluted into two specifics: one at lower binding energy of 444.1 eV and the other at higher binding energy of 445.1–445.2 eV (see Table 2). The lower binding energy is attributed to the formation of metallic In or the formation of PtIn alloy [44], [45], [46], whereas the higher binding energy is ascribed to the oxidation state of indium. Jahel et al. [41] reported that Pt electronic structure had a bigger modification in the trimetallic system (PtSnIn), and it may be indicative of the presence of Pt−In alloys beside Pt−Sn nanoclusters. Therefore, the introduced In by impregnation interacts with Pt and possibly leads to the formation of PtIn alloys. The percentage of metallic In or PtIn alloy in 0.3Pt/1.5In–Al and 0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al catalysts is 37% and 30%, respectively. These results suggest that Sn and In exist interaction and In partly inhibits Sn reduction.

3.1.5. TEM images of the samples
To directly examine the metal particle size and morphology on the support, the TEM images of the catalysts were conducted and shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a illustrates a wide distribution of Pt particle size and a bad dispersion of metallic particles for monometallic 0.3Pt/Al catalyst. Fig. 4b displays a more homogeneous distribution of Pt particles for 0.3PtSn/Al catalyst. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the best homogeneous distribution of metallic particles can be seen for 0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst. The mean metallic particle size for 0.3Pt/Al, 0.3PtSn/Al, and 0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al is 17.9, 12.1 and 10.8 nm, respectively. These results indicate that adding Sn is in favor of the uniform distribution of Pt component on the support. On the other hand, indium doping on PtSn/Al catalyst is more conducive to decrease the size of Pt particles because of the dilution effect of platinum in presence of In and Sn [47]. Therefore, the difference of the metallic particle distribution of the catalysts should be the results of Sn and In promoters in the catalysts preparation, which implies that the better catalytic performances may be expected for 0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst over other two catalysts.

3.1.6. H2-TPR analysis
The effects of indium on the reduction properties of catalysts were measured by H2-TPR method. Fig. 5 shows the TPR curves of pure Al2O3 and Sn–Al2O3, In–Al2O3 supports. All samples exhibit a reduction peak at about 750 °C. Although the origin of the peak at 750 °C is not clearly known, it can be guessed that it is relevant with the reduction of contaminant ions in the carrier [48]. When Pt is present, this peak position shifts to a low temperature and becomes broad. The similar results were found by Yu et al. [22], [48]. The Sn/Al2O3 support shows a wide curve of hydrogen consumption between 420 °C and 700 °C containing a shoulder at 520 °C and a second reduction zone at 670 °C. The two regions correspond to the reduction of Sn species having different interaction strength with the alumina support. This observation is expected since Sn oxides are generally accepted to be in close interaction with the alumina support after calcinations [18]. The 1.5In–Al2O3 reduction profile consists of a lower shoulder at 380 °C, a higher shoulder at 550 °C and a main reduction region peaking at 640 °C. This reduction profile of alumina supported In oxide is considered to be the reduction of In oxide particles interacting with support in more or less extent. Hence, the reduction of In oxides weakly bonded to the support proceeds in the two shoulder peaks, and species strongly interacting with the support (probably In–aluminates) are reduced at the higher temperature. Considering that the promoter–support interaction strength has a big influence on promoter’s reduction [49], the fact that the reduction of In oxides is easier reduction than Sn oxides.

Fig. 6 shows the TPR traces of monometallic 0.3Pt/Al, bimetallic 0.3PtSn/Al and 0.3Pt/1.5In–Al catalysts. The TPR curve of 0.3Pt/Al consists of three consumption peaks at 340 °C, 560 °C, 730 °C, respectively. The first weak peak at 340 °C corresponds to the reduction of PtOCl2 species on the surface and the peak at 560 °C is most likely associated with the reduction of Pt species in stronger interaction with the support [50], [51]. Therefore, we could associate the hydrogen consumption at 340 and 560 °C to the reduction of the two types of platinum species. For 0.3PtSn/Al catalyst, two low temperature reduction peaks are found at 360 °C and 540 °C. The 0.3PtSn/Al catalyst shows a similar profile in the platinum reduction region, but a noticeable increase in the hydrogen consumption is observed compared with 0.3Pt/Al catalyst. It suggests that a fraction of tin is simultaneously reduced along with platinum, possibly leading to the reduction of some Sn oxides into the metallic state. The presence of Pt can notably assist the reduction of SnO2 and lead to the formation of PtSn alloy [52]. The bimetallic 0.3Pt/1.5In–Al catalyst also shows a similar increase in hydrogen consumption in the Pt reduction region. This indicates that a fraction of In initially being reduced at 380 °C in the monometallic sample (Fig. 5) is now reduced near 310 °C. Such a shift in the reduction temperature of In is typical of close Pt–In intimacy, possibly in the form of PtxIn alloys [36].

Fig. 7 shows the TPR traces of trimetallic PtSn/xIn–Al catalysts. It can be seen that the hydrogen consumption of trimetallic catalysts in the reduction region around 505 °C increases as the indium content increases. With the coexistence of three metals, the maximum reduction peak for Pt oxide species of the bimetallic 0.3PtSn/Al or 0.3Pt/1.5In–Al catalyst shifts to lower temperature (about 505 °C). This indicates that the added indium not only interacts with platinum but also provokes a synergetic effect with Sn, facilitating its reduction in the trimetallic system. This could also mean that the presence of indium improve Pt–Sn interactions.

The TPR results show that adding indium to 0.3PtSn/Al catalysts results in the strong surface interactions and affects the surface reducibility. Although it is very difficult to correctly analyze the reducibility of each component of the complicated PtSn/xIn–Al system, the strong surface interactions could increase the ability of Pt particles to resist agglomeration, which can be verified by the TEM and XPS analysis. Therefore, the high catalytic stability of PtSn/xIn–Al is expected at elevated temperature and regeneration conditions.
3.2. The catalytic performances of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation
3.2.1. Effect of metallic compositions
The propane dehydrogenation performances of the synthesized catalysts with different metallic compositions are shown in Fig. 8. It is observed that the monometal catalyst 1.5In–Al shows the lowest conversion and selectivity. Meanwhile, the monometal catalyst 0.3Pt/Al also shows the bad dehydrogenation performances. With the addition of Sn, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity both evidently increase for 0.3PtSn/Al catalyst. Compared to 0.3Pt/Al and 0.3PtSn/Al catalysts, the catalytic performances for 0.3Pt/1.5In–Al catalyst are further improved with an initial propane conversion of 53.11% and a stable propylene selectivity about 93%. The highest propane dehydrogenation performance with an initial propane conversion of 58.41% and the stable propylene selectivity above 93% are obtained for the trimetallic 0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst.

The selectivity of main by-products over the catalysts is also illustrated in Fig. 9. It can be seen that the highest by-product selectivity is presented for the two monometallic catalysts (1.5In–Al and 0.3Pt/Al), implying that much more side reactions occurs. The high by-product selectivity of 1.5In–Al may be attributed to the absence of Pt species; while it may be attributed to the high fraction of strong acidity for 0.3Pt/Al (in Table 2). The much lower by-product selectivity is obtained for the two bimetallic catalysts (0.3PtSn/Al and 0.3Pt/1.5In–Al). The lowest by-product selectivity is presented for the trimetallic catalyst (0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al), which is consistent with the results in Fig. 8.

The evolution of the catalytic performances over the synthesized catalysts with different metallic compositions can be explained as following. First, according to the TEM images in Fig. 4, the smaller particle size and more homogeneous distribution of Pt are obtained after adding In or/and Sn constitutions in the catalysts, which is favor of improving the catalytic performances because much more metallic active sites are exposed. Furthermore, above surface acidity analysis according to the NH3-TPD results in Fig. 1 and Table 2 indicates that the strong acid sites of the catalysts are partly neutralized or weakened after introducing In and/or Sn constituents, which can suppress the side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymerization). Therefore, the higher propylene selectivity is obtained for the trimetallic (0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al) and bimetallic (0.3PtSn/Al and 0.3Pt/1.5In–Al) catalysts compared to the monometallic catalyst (0.3Pt/Al).
3.2.2. Effect of indium content
The propane conversion and propylene selectivity over PtSn/xIn–Al(x: indium content) catalysts with different indium contents as a function of reaction time are illustrated in Fig. 10. When the indium loading is 1.5 wt.%, the propane conversion, selectivity and catalytic stability are the most satisfied for PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst, which has the initial and final propane conversions of 58.41% and 48.59% respectively. However, the higher or lower indium loading both leads to a decline in the activity and stability. It is possible that the higher indium loading changes and blocks the pores of carrier, and the lower indium content can not fully inhibit hydrogenolysis reaction. Thus, there is the best indium doping amount for the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction.

3.2.3. Effect of reaction temperature
Fig. 11 shows the effect of reaction temperature on the performance of 0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst in propane dehydrogenation. The initial propane conversions are 32.8%, 38.9%, 54.1% and 58.4% at 560, 580, 600 and 620 °C, respectively, and they decrease to 31.5%, 38.9%, 47.3% and 48.6% after 165 min reaction. The initial propylene selectivity values are 98.6%, 98.5%, 97.5% and 92.8%, at 560, 580, 600 and 620 °C, respectively. The decreased selectivity at higher reaction temperature can be attributed to the side reactions like thermal cracking, which will enhance the carbon deposition on the catalyst surface and shorten regeneration period. Though the highest propane conversion is given at 620 °C at the cost of lowest selectivity, it is not an ideal reaction parameter. In comparison with the results at 620 °C, the propylene selectivity evidently increases at other three reaction temperature. However, the initial propane conversion is only 31.5% when the reaction is performed at 560 °C. To balance the conversion and selectivity of propane dehydrogenation, the reaction temperature at 580–600 °C may be the desired selection.

3.2.4. Effect of GHSV
The effects of GHSV on the performances of 0.6PtSn/0.5In–Al catalyst in propane dehydrogenation were measured and shown in Fig. 12. As can be seen from Fig. 12, the initial propane conversions are 62.6%, 60.1% and 52.0% at 1500 h−1, 2250 h−1 and 3000 h−1, respectively; and they decrease to 53.2%, 52.2% and 42.1% after 165 min reaction. The GHSV has little influence on the selectivity of 0.6PtSn/0.5In–Al catalyst. However, when GHSV increases to 3000 h−1, a much lower propane conversion is obtained. Thus, the optimal GHSV is about 1500–2250 h−1 for this catalyst.

3.2.5. Effect of platinum content
Fig. 13 shows the effect of platinum content on the catalytic performances of the catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. The initial propane conversions of 0.6PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst and 0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al are 61.4% and 58.4%, and the final ones are 59.0% and 48.6% after reaction for 165 min, respectively. The initial propylene selectivity values for 0.6PtSn/1.5In–Al and 0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al catalysts are 95.3% and 92.8% respectively and vary little during the whole reaction process. It can be seen that the 0.6PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst exhibits the higher catalytic performances than that of PtSn/1.5In–Al. The more activity sites for 0.6PtSn/1.5In–Al should be the reason for its the higher catalytic performances.

3.2.6. Stability test
A stability test of 0.6PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst was also carried out at 600 °C. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity as a function of reaction time are shown in Fig. 14. As can be seen from Fig. 14, the propylene selectivity is higher than 96% and varies little during the whole reaction process. Also, a slow deactivation rate is displayed in the overall process, and the final propylene yield is above 40% after reaction for 53 h.

3.2.7. Coke analysis
Coking is one of the most important factors for the deactivation of dehydrogenation catalysts in this study. Coke on the used catalysts can be characterized by TPO method. The typical TPO profiles of four used catalysts are shown in Fig. 15, where the catalysts reacted in propane dehydrogenation for 165 min at 620 °C. It can be seen that although all used samples show one wide combustion peak, the temperature for main combustion peak of each sample is different. The lowest temperature of 416 °C is observed over the used 0.3Pt/Al catalyst. The slightly higher combustion temperature peaks are observed over the used bimetallic catalysts (0.3PtSn/Al and 0.3Pt/1.5In–Al). The highest combustion temperature peak at about 432 °C is shown over the used 0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst. The previous literature proposed that the nature of coke could be different on metal and support sites due to different reactivity to oxygen [25]. The coke combustion peak at higher temperature means more deposited coke in the surface of carrier. The poorly polymerized coke deposits are located on the metallic surface, while the highly polymerized ones are located on the carrier [53], [54]. These results suggest that co-existence of Sn and In is more advantage of suppressing the coke extent on Pt sites, which means that more active sites be protected to maintain catalytic stability.

4. Conclusions
The BET and XRD measurements verify that the presence of indium does not result in practical change in the texture of carrier. The NH3-TPD curves show that the presence of indium could partly neutralize the strong acid sites of support, which is advantageous to improve the propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The TEM images show that platinum particle size decreases with the addition of tin and/or indium. The mean particle size of platinum is around 10 nm for 0.3PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst because of the dilution effect of In and Sn. The XPS and H2-TPR analysis verifies the effects of In and Sn on Pt sites and the interactions among three metals, which could lead to alloy formation(PtSn or PtIn). The 0.3PtSn/xIn–Al catalysts with loadings 0.5–2.5 wt.% indium exhibit highly efficient performances for propane dehydrogenation reaction. Above 96.0% propylene selectivity and 41.0% yield are obtained over 0.6PtSn/1.5In–Al catalyst over 53 h at 600 °C.
