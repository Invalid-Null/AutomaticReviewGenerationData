</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: The article evaluates the supported mono-metallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt/Al2O3 has higher byproduct selectivity compared to bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts, implying more side reactions.

[1] "The NH3-TPD curves show that the presence of indium could partly neutralize the strong acid sites of support, which is advantageous to improve the propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[2] "The TEM images show that platinum particle size decreases with the addition of tin and/or indium. The mean particle size of platinum is around 10 nm for 0.3PtSn/1.5InAl catalyst because of the dilution effect of In and Sn."

<English version answer>
2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of the PtSnIn/Al2O3 catalyst affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that adding indium decreases the strong acid sites on the support, leading to improved propylene selectivity. Adding tin and indium also decreases the Pt particle size to ~10 nm and promotes alloy formation between Pt, Sn, and In, which improves the catalyst performance.
