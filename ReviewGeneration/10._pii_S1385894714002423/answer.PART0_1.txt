[1] "Bimetallic PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts promoted by doping indium(In) for propane dehydrogenation are investigated with several state-of-art characterizations such as BET, XRD, NH3-TPD, TEM, XPS, H2-TPR and TPO."

[2] "Compared to monometallic Pt supported catalysts, bimetallic PtSn catalysts show higher activity, selectivity and stability in light paraffin dehydrogenation." 

[3] "The presence of Pt can notably assist the reduction of SnO2 and lead to the formation of PtSn alloy [52]."

2. The article explains that catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3 facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing active sites that lower activation energy barriers. The mechanisms described include bimetallic PtSn catalysts showing higher activity than monometallic Pt catalysts, and Pt assisting the reduction of SnO2 to form PtSn alloy active sites.
