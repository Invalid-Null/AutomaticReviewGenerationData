1. The article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3 or Pt-Sn for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses only on gallium-modified zeolite BEA catalysts.

2. The article investigates how the incorporation of gallium into the BEA zeolite framework affects propane dehydrogenation performance. Specifically, it shows that incorporating gallium into lattice defect sites created by removing zinc leads to the formation of isolated gallium Lewis acid sites that are highly selective for propane dehydrogenation over cracking reactions.  

3. The article proposes a mechanistic pathway for propane dehydrogenation over the gallium-modified BEA zeolites. The key steps described are:
(i) Propane adsorption on the gallium site 
(ii) Cleavage of the first C-H bond to form an alkyl intermediate
(iii) β-hydride transfer to form propene
(iv) Desorption of propene
(v) Desorption of H2 and regeneration of the active site

4. The article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects or supported mono-metallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

5. The article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation.

6. The article does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts, as it focuses solely on gallium-modified zeolites.

7. The article does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts.

[1] The kinetic model of the catalyzed dehydrogenation including the elementary steps of propane adsorption, first and second CH bond cleavage, and propene and H2 desorption demonstrates that the propane dehydrogenation rate is determined by the first CH bond cleavage at low pC3H8, while at high pC3H8, the rate is limited by the desorption of H2.

[2] Scheme 2 shows the proposed elementary steps for PDH on the Ga/BEA catalysts, including propane adsorption, first CH bond cleavage, β-hydrogen transfer, propene desorption, and H2 desorption. 

[3] Scheme 3 illustrates a simplified reaction mechanism on the Ga/BEA catalysts with the dehydrated Ga3+ active center, involving the key steps of propane adsorption, first CH bond cleavage, β-hydrogen transfer, propene desorption, and H2 desorption.
