1. The article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3 or Pt-Sn for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses only on gallium-modified zeolite BEA catalysts.

2. The article investigates how the incorporation of gallium into the BEA zeolite framework affects propane dehydrogenation performance. Specifically, it shows that incorporating gallium into lattice defect sites created by removing zinc leads to the formation of isolated gallium Lewis acid sites that are highly selective for propane dehydrogenation over cracking reactions.  

3. The article proposes a mechanistic pathway for propane dehydrogenation over the gallium-modified BEA zeolites. The key steps described are:
(i) Propane adsorption on the gallium site 
(ii) Cleavage of the first C-H bond to form an alkyl intermediate
(iii) β-hydride transfer to form propene
(iv) Desorption of propene
(v) Desorption of H2 and regeneration of the active site

4. The article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects or supported mono-metallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

5. The article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation.

6. The article does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts, as it focuses solely on gallium-modified zeolites.

7. The article does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts.

1. 该文并未评估诸如Cr2O3或Pt-Sn等有前途的金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它仅研究了镓修饰沸石BEA催化剂。

2. 该文展示了将镓掺入BEA沸石的晶格缺陷位点中,会形成隔离的镓路易斯酸中心,这些中心可以提供高选择性的丙烷脱氢反应。

3. 该文通过镓中心提出了关键步骤为丙烷吸附、C-H键断裂、β-氢移位、丙烯脱附和H2脱附的机理途径。

4. 该文没有探究金属-支撑界面效应对丙烷脱氢催化剂的影响。

5. 该文没有评估任何受支持的单金属催化剂如Pt、Pd或Ir用于丙烷脱氢。

6. 由于文章专注于镓修饰沸石,所以没有研究受支持金属催化剂的性质如何影响性能。

7. 该文没有提出受支持金属催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机理途径。
