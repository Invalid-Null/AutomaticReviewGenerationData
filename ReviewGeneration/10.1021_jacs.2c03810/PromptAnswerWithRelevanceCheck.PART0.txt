 <quotes>

[1] The article does not explicitly provide background information on the importance of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation in the chemical industry.

[2] The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the activation energy barrier for C-H bond cleavage. Specific details are provided on mechanisms involving isolated Ga cation sites and Ga-O-Ga pairs acting as Lewis acid sites in zeolites. 

[3] The article introduces Cr- and Pt-based catalysts used in commercial propane dehydrogenation processes. Zeolites modified with Ga are also discussed as promising catalysts.

[4] The article discusses the thermodynamic constraints of propane dehydrogenation being highly endothermic. Kinetic isotope effects are measured to elucidate rate-limiting steps. Activation energies of 155 ± 8 kJ/mol for C-H bond cleavage and 123 ± 8 kJ/mol for H2 desorption are reported. 

[5] The article does not describe the application of DFT calculations to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways.

[6] The article presents microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation elementary steps to derive rate equations and parameters. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood model is used.

[7] The article describes correlations between Ga/BEA catalyst properties and propane dehydrogenation activity/selectivity. Specifically, the concentration of dehydrated tetrahedral Ga3+ sites correlated with dehydrogenation rate.
