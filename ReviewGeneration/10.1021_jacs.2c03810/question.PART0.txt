Highly Active and Selective Sites for Propane Dehydrogenation in Zeolite Ga-BEA
Abstract
A highly selective Ga-modified zeolite BEA for propane dehydrogenation has been synthesized by grafting Ga on Zn-BEA followed by removal of Zn in the presence of H2. A propene selectivity of 82% at 19% propane conversion illustrates the high selectivity at 813 K. The kinetic model of the catalyzed dehydrogenation including the elementary steps of propane adsorption, first and second CH bond cleavage, and propene and H2 desorption demonstrates that the propane dehydrogenation rate is determined by the first CH bond cleavage at low pC3H8, while at high pC3H8, the rate is limited by the desorption of H2. The active sites have been identified as dehydrated and tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ in the *BEA lattice. The low selectivity toward aromatics is concluded to be associated with the high Lewis acid strength of lattice Ga3+ and the low Brnsted acid strength of the hydrated Ga sites.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propene is a key intermediate used in synthesizing polymers and various chemicals. (1) Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a route that has increased in importance because of the increasing availability of propane from shale gas (Scheme 1). It is a highly endothermic reaction with a standard enthalpy change (ΔH298K0) of 124 kJ·mol1, requiring high reaction temperature (typically >823 K) and low propane pressure to achieve high conversions. (2) The significantly high temperature leads to undesired CC bond formation and cleaving reactions by solid acid catalysts. Propene, being more reactive than propane, readily undergoes multistep secondary reactions, including oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization, on the same catalyst. (3,4) As a result, typical byproducts are a mixture of methane, ethene, ethane, C4C6 hydrocarbons, and aromatics.
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Simplified Reaction Pathways of Propane to Propene and Byproducts
As the key reaction step appears to be the cleavage of the first CH bond of propane, Cr- and Pt-based catalysts are widely used in commercially implemented processes (e.g., Catofin and Oleflex processes). (2,57) However, deactivation of these catalysts limits energy and economic efficiencies. The substitution of Ga3+ for Al3+ in the MFI framework and the addition of Ga-oxide nanoclusters are highly effective for dehydrogenation but also lead to substantial cyclization and aromatization. (810)
Diverse approaches have been studied on how to incorporate Ga into the zeolites, (1,1118) suggesting a variety of active Ga species, both experimentally and computationally. (1928) Schreiber et al., for example, showed that the formation of homotopic LewisBrnsted acid pairs (Ga+H+) in Ga/ZSM-5, (14) formed upon interaction of a Brnsted acid site (BAS) with ion-exchanged Ga+, leads to an increase of 2 orders of magnitude in the PDH rate in comparison to the parent H-ZSM-5.
Although the catalytic activity of these supported Ga catalysts for PDH has been extensively explored, the nature of their active sites is often a point of contention. The isolated BAS and isolated Ga cations tend to catalyze secondary reactions, such as dimerization and aromatization, decreasing the propene selectivity with increasing propane conversion. (2931) The challenge for catalyst synthesis lies, therefore, in having highly active sites while limiting the CC bond cleavage and oligomerization.
To synthesize materials with highly uniform active sites, we chose the zeolite framework *BEA substituted with Zn as the parent material. Ga3+ cations were introduced via incipient wetness impregnation and subsequent heat treatment to dislodge the lattice-substituting Zn cations via H2 reduction at elevated temperatures. This synthesis strategy allowed replacement of Zn2+ with Ga3+ leading to Ga Lewis acid sites (LASs) and BASs. The nature and concentration of the Ga sites are probed by infrared (IR) spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine. The effect of Ga sites on PDH with respect to catalytic activity, selectivity, and the proposed reaction mechanism is investigated by kinetic studies, kinetic isotope experiments, and in situ propane uptake measurements.

Catalyst Characterization
All catalysts have the crystal structure of the zeolite *BEA intergrowths, as shown by consistent X-ray diffractograms (Figure S1). (32) The Ga impregnation and subsequent removal of Zn by H2 reduction did not change the diffraction patterns. Diffraction features corresponding to bulk GaOx and ZnOx species were not detected. (33,34)Table 1 and Table S1 compile the physical and chemical properties of Ga/BEA-X catalysts. The properties of Ga/Zn-BEA-X catalysts are presented in Table S2. All Ga/BEA-X samples had a similar micropore volume of 0.16  0.01 cm3·g1 and a BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) surface area of 355  15 m2·g1, demonstrating that different loadings of Ga did not change these properties. Compared to the corresponding precursor materials (i.e., Ga/Zn-BEA-X), the BET surface area and micropore volume increased slightly. Following the H2 treatment, Zn was completely removed (Table S1). We hypothesize that the reductive removal of Zn2+ led to defects (i.e., silanol nests) in the *BEA framework. Ga3+ cations migrate at high temperature to these sites and coordinate with the O atoms of the constituting silanols.

aZn content in the parent Zn-BEA sample was 6 wt % from elemental analysis; no Zn was detected in the Ga/BEA-X samples.
To characterize the changes induced by the removal of Zn, the different IR spectra of Ga/BEA-0 and Ga/BEA-4.6 catalysts (before and after Zn removal) are compared in Figure 1. An increase in the intensity of the broad band at 3508 cm1 and the sharp band at 3745 cm1 and a corresponding decrease in the intensity of the bands at 3735 and 3712 cm1, respectively, were observed after Zn leaching [Ga/BEA-0; Figure 1a(iii)]. These bands are assigned to hydrogen-bonded internal silanol groups (3508 cm1), terminal silanol groups (3745 cm1), and isolated internal silanol groups (3735 and 3712 cm1). (3537) Combined, the bands support the hypothesis of the formation of defect sites by the removal of Zn2+ from the zeolite framework.

Pyridine adsorbed on Ga/BEA-0 showed bands of the ring vibrations at 1452 and 1455 cm1 (pyridine sorbed on LAS; Py-LAS), 1444 cm1 (hydrogen-bonded pyridine; Py-H), and 1548 cm1 (pyridinium ions interacting with BAS; PyH+) after evacuation at 373 K (Figure S3). (3842) The concentration of the LAS and BAS in Ga/BEA-0 was estimated to be 46 and 10 μmol·g1, respectively (Table 1). With the addition of Ga, the increase in terminal silanols (3745 cm1) and extra-framework Ga-OH species (3690 cm1) was observed on Ga/BEA-4.6. In contrast to Ga/BEA-0, however, an increase in the broad band corresponding to hydrogen-bonded silanol nests (3508 cm1) was not observed [Figure 1b(iii)]. This suggests that Ga3+ is incorporated in lattice defects in the zeolite framework formed during Zn removal. A significant concentration of the BAS (168 μmol·g1) was generated in Ga/BEA-4.6 as the incorporation of Ga3+ into lattice defect sites leads to the formation of the BAS. The corresponding Si(OH)Ga band was observed at 3612 cm1 (Figure S2). It appeared at slightly lower wavenumbers than the corresponding OH groups in gallosilicate MFI (3620 cm1), (43) indicating a different environment and tentatively a lower acidity of Ga incorporated in the *BEA framework.
The IR spectra of pyridine adsorbed on Ga/BEA-4.6 after evacuation at 373, 573, and 723 K showed bands at 1446, 1457, 1460, 1490, and 1545 cm1 (Figure S4), indicating interactions of pyridine with the BAS and LAS. (38,44) Two distinct strong LASs (sLAS; referring to residual acid sites after evacuation at 723 K) were discovered on the Ga/BEA-X catalyst at 1457 and 1460 cm1. The band at 1457 cm1 is attributed to pyridine adsorption on Ga3+ sites at extra-framework and ion-exchange positions. (18,45) Another band at slightly higher wavenumbers (1460 cm1) appeared only after evacuation at 723 K for 1 h. It is tentatively attributed to pyridine adsorption at the dehydrated Ga3+ sites in the framework after evacuation at high temperature. (46) The deconvolution of the bands in the region between 1440 and 1475 cm1 after evacuation at 723 K is shown in Figure S5. These two bands remained stable after evacuation at 723 K, indicating a high Lewis acid strength.
The concentration of both the sBAS and total sLAS increased with Ga loading of the zeolite (Table 1), suggesting that a significant part of Ga is present in both the lattice and at extra-framework or ion-exchange positions. The concentration of the sLAS at 1460 cm1 (assigned to dehydrated Ga3+ in the framework), however, increased until a Ga loading of 3.2 wt % but then decreased at higher Ga loadings (Figure 2). On the other hand, both the sLAS at 1457 cm1 (assigned to Ga in extra-framework or ion-exchange positions) and the GaOx LAS (at 1446 cm1) (14) increased with the increasing Ga content especially at higher Ga loadings (Figure 2). These observations suggest that the concentration of dehydrated Ga3+ in the lattice increased with the increasing Ga content but then decreased at the highest Ga loading due to ion exchange of Ga at these sites and the subsequent formation of GaOx species.

Propane Dehydrogenation on Ga/BEA-X
Figure 3a shows the reaction of propane on the Ga/BEA-3.2 catalyst with increasing contact time (WHSV1; gpropane1·gcatalyst·h). Propane conversion was negligible in the absence of the catalyst. The conversion of propane increased linearly with inverse weight hourly space velocity (WHSV1) at low conversions but deviated at higher WHSV1, approaching the equilibrium conversion of 28% at 1 bar and 813 K. (47) The yield of propene began to deviate moderately beyond 10% conversion due to secondary reactions consuming propene (Figure 3b,c). Methane and ethene were the main byproducts generated from the cracking of propane. Although propane cracking should produce equimolar amounts of methane and ethene, the yield of ethene gradually overtook that of methane at higher conversions. This suggests the existence of a second pathway resulting in ethene production, for example, cracking of higher hydrocarbons formed upon propene oligomerization. Notably, C4C6 alkanes and alkenes and aromatics were observed at higher propane conversions as minor secondary products.

Reaction conditions: temperature 813 K, pressure 1 bar, total flow 20100 mL·min1, 50 mg of the catalyst, and  20 mbar. (b) Product yields at varying propane conversions over Ga/BEA-3.2. (c) Propene yield as a function of propane conversion on different Ga/BEA-X catalysts. Reaction conditions: temperature 813 K, pressure 1 bar, total flow 5100 mL·min1, 50 mg of the catalyst, and  20 mbar.
Figure 3b shows the product yield as a function of propane conversion on Ga/BEA-3.2 at 813 K. At low conversions, the selectivity to propene was >93%, with methane (3.5% selectivity) and ethene (3.3% selectivity) being the main byproducts. The selectivity toward propene decreased gradually with increasing propane conversion, reaching 82% at 19% conversion. The yield of methane, ethene, C4C6 hydrocarbons, and aromatics increased correspondingly. All Ga/BEA-X catalysts showed the same trend highlighting the similarity of the active sites generated in these materials with different Ga loadings (Figure 3c). At 873 K, 72% propene selectivity was achieved at 40% propane conversion (Figure S6). The propene selectivity on these materials is, therefore, significantly higher than that previously reported on Ga-modified zeolites (18,21) and is comparable to that of the benchmark Pt/Al2O3- and Cr3O3/Al2O3-based catalysts (7593% at 4045% conversion). (6,7,18,42,47,48) Notably, the ethene/methane ratio was close to 1 at conversions up to 35% at 873 K, suggesting that the secondary pathway to form ethene, that is, propene oligomerization and subsequent cracking, became less significant at higher temperatures.
Different Ga loadings also led to different PDH rates. The Ga/BEA-X zeolites with Ga loading varying between 0 and 4.6 wt % were studied at 813 K (Figures 4 and S7). The net rate of propane conversion and the rates of PDH and cracking as a function of Ga loading are shown in Figure 4. The parent Ga/BEA-0 material showed a negligible reaction rate of 0.05 μmol·g1·s1. The propene selectivity was 93%, and the main byproducts were methane, ethene, and ethane. Other secondary products, that is, C4C6 hydrocarbons and aromatics, from oligomerization and aromatization reactions were not detected. The Ga/BEA-X (0.64.6 wt % Ga) materials increased the propane conversion rates up to 2.5 μmol·g1·s1 at the maximum, an increase of 2 orders of magnitude in comparison to Ga/BEA-0. With the increase in the Ga content, the dehydrogenation rate first increased until a Ga loading of 3.2 wt % and then decreased upon further increasing it.

Reaction conditions: temperature 813 K, pressure 1 bar, total flow 50 mL·min1, 10 mg of the catalyst,  20 mbar, and at 21 h time on stream. All rates were determined at conversions below 4%.
Reaction Mechanism of PDH on Ga/BEA
The PDH rate (Figure 5a) increased gradually with to a plateau, with a concurrent decrease in the reaction order from 0.8 at 2 mbar to 0.2 at 100 mbar (Figure 5b). The dependence of the cracking rate on showed the same trend as that of the PDH rate (Figure S9). A reaction order of 0.9 at 2 mbar and 0.3 at 100 mbar was determined. Although the decrease in the reaction order with increasing could be attributed to an increasing coverage of active sites, the in situ-determined constant propane uptake measurements on the catalyst during the reaction (Figure 5c, for Ga/BEA-3.2) indicate that this is not a likely hypothesis. The negligible increase in the weight of the catalyst at different indicates a very low coverage of propane (or other hydrocarbon intermediates) under reaction conditions (more details in Supporting Information Section S4).

Reaction conditions: temperature 813 K, pressure 1 bar, total flow 100 mL·min1, 10 mg of the catalyst, and 2100 mbar.
The PDH rates of C3H8 and C3D8 on Ga/BEA-3.2 were determined to be 0.47 and 0.29 μmol·g1·s1 at 2 mbar, respectively, corresponding to a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 1.6. It is well established that H/D exchange between the alkanes and BAS occurs readily under PDH conditions. (49) However, no KIE was observed for the dehydrogenation of n-butane on H-ZSM-5 with BASs as the active sites. (50) This suggests that the active sites for dehydrogenation are not BASs but the Ga LAS. The KIE of 1.6 suggests the cleavage of the CH bond to be the rate-determining step (RDS) in agreement with the literature. (51,52) It is interesting to note that the KIE value decreased with increasing and reached 0.8 at 100 mbar (Figure 5b). The KIE value below 1 at high is hypothesized to be caused by the desorption of H2 becoming the RDS. (53) With lower zero-point energy of D2 compared to that of H2, the H2 desorption step has a higher energy barrier compared to D2 desorption, leading to an inverse KIE. Thus, the changes in the KIE agree well with the RDS shifting from CH bond cleavage to H2 desorption with increasing .
The proposed elementary steps for PDH are listed in Scheme 2. Propane first adsorbs reversibly on the catalytic site [Scheme 2(1), (C3H8S)]. Then, the cleavage of the first CH bond occurs to form an intermediate [Scheme 2(2), (C3H7-SH)]. Propene is formed upon β-H transfer from the alkyl group to the active site [Scheme 2(3), (C3H6SH2)], leading to the desorption of the alkene with H remaining on the site [Scheme 2(4), (SHH)]. Finally, the reaction cycle is completed after the desorption of H2 and the regeneration of the active site [Scheme 2(5)].

The ki (i = 14) are the forward reaction rate constants of the elementary steps described in Scheme 2. The , , and θSHH are the coverage of the species [C3H7SH], [C3H6SH2], and [SHH], respectively. The correlations between the site coverages of and other species are defined as eq 3.

The site balance results in the following relation
(4)
If any of the C3 species, viz., [C3H8S], [C3H7SH], and [C3H6SH2], would have had substantial coverages, the catalyst weight should be expected to increase during the reaction (calculation details in Supporting Information Section S4). However, this was not observed (Figure 5c), suggesting very low coverages of these species, that is, 0, 0, and 0. Thus, only the θS and θSHH terms remain in the site balance equation

With eqs 1b, 3c, and 5, the expressions of θS, θSHH, and r, the reaction rate of PDH, are obtained (derivation details in Supporting Information Section S5)

The variable N is the concentration of active sites on the catalyst. The reciprocal of the rate equation, eq 6c, gives

which indicates the linearly increasing correlation between 1/r and 1/ , with a slope of 1/(N·k1·Kao) and an intercept of 1/(N·k4). This fits well with the measured experimental data on Ga/BEA-X catalysts (Figure 6). In particular, at low pressure of propane (  0), eq 6c and eq 6a can be simplified as eq 7a and eq 7b.

Therefore, at low , the active site is barely covered (i.e., θS  1), and the rate equation gives a first-order dependency on . The only involved rate constant is k1, indicating that the cleavage of the first CH bond of propane is the RDS under these conditions. Our measured KIE of 1.6 for PDH rates over C3H8 and C3D8 on Ga/BEA-3.2 also suggests CH bond cleavage to be the RDS. (51,52) Conversely, at high pressures (  +), the active sites are nearly fully covered by H2 (θSHH  1), and the PDH rate equals N·k4 and is independent of . The desorption of H2 therefore becomes the RDS. This agrees well with the measured KIE of 0.8 and the reaction order of 0.2 at 100 mbar propane. The shift of the RDS from CH bond cleavage to H2 desorption agrees with the decrease in the KIE below unity and the nearly zero PDH reaction order at high .
The kinetics of all Ga/BEA-X catalysts is excellently described with eq 6d (Figures 6 and S10), implying that the catalytic activity on all these catalysts is dominated by one type of active site and follows the same (proposed) reaction mechanism. We note that different types of potentially active sites, such as isolated LASs, isolated BASs, GaOx clusters, and LASBAS pairs, may exist simultaneously on these Ga/BEA catalysts, but either only one type of site or a fixed combination of sites determines the catalytic activity and selectivity for all materials.
The activation energies for the first CH bond cleavage and the H2 desorption step were calculated by the temperature dependence of the regressed N·k1·Kao and N·k4 using eq 6d. The Arrhenius plot for the reaction on Ga/BEA-3.2 between 793 and 843 K is shown in Figure S11, and the calculated activation energies are summarized in Table 2. We observe that the CH bond cleavage has an intrinsic activation energy of 155  8 kJ·mol1, which is 32 kJ·mol1 higher than that of the H2 desorption step. The apparent activation enthalpy of PDH was 129  7 kJ·mol1 on the Ga+H+ pair sites in Ga/ZSM-5 and 80  25 kJ·mol1 on the [GaH]2+ sites in Ga/H-MFI. (14,15) Our results, therefore, indicate that the active site on Ga/BEA-X catalysts is different from the Ga+H+ pair sites or [GaH]2+ sites documented in earlier reports. We also observed a decrease in the PDH rate from 2.2 to 0.8 μmol·g1·s1 after pre-reducing the Ga/BEA-3.2 catalyst in 1 bar H2 at 823 K for 1 h (Figure S8), which contrasts the results for catalysts with Ga+H+ pairs and [GaH]2+ sites. Isolated BASs can also be excluded as the active site as the PDH rate decreased at the highest BAS concentrations for the Ga/BEA-4.6 catalyst. The GaOx clusters have been shown to have a low PDH activity in our previous work as well. (14)

aThe calculation of adsorption enthalpy of propane is shown in Figure S12.
The PDH rate correlated well with the concentration of the sLAS formed by dehydrated tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ in the lattice (i.e., peak area at 1460 cm1 after pyridine adsorption and evacuation at 723 K) (Figure 7). We again note that the total sLAS concentration showed a monotonous increase with the Ga3+ content, while the concentration of these dehydrated framework Ga3+ sites increased first with the Ga3+ concentration until 3.2 wt % and decreased at the 4.6 wt % Ga content. At higher Ga loadings, Ga3+ sites at extra-framework and ion-exchange positions (at 1457 cm1) and GaOx clusters are preferably formed (Figure 2), leading to a decrease in the PDH activity. We conclude, therefore, that the dehydrated Ga3+ sites are the active site for PDH. (5457) The turnover frequency (TOF) of PDH on the dehydrated lattice Ga3+ sites is estimated to be 3.1 × 102 molpropane·(molactive site·s)1. The TOF on these sites is higher than the TOF of PDH on LewisBrnsted acid pairs [9.4 × 103 molpropane·(molactive site·s)1] estimated by Schreiber et al. (14)

A simplified catalytic cycle is illustrated using the dehydrated Ga3+ active center in Scheme 3. Corresponding to the kinetic model, five elementary steps including propane adsorption, first CH bond cleavage, β-hydrogen transfer, propene desorption, and H2 desorption are presented. Two alkane dehydrogenation pathways, viz., the alkyl pathway, in which Ga3+ acts as the acceptor of the negatively charged alkyl species, and the carbenium pathway, in which a zeolite lattice oxygen forms an alkoxy group with the alkane, have been discussed in connection with Ga zeolites. (15,22,2427,58)Scheme 3 shows, at low , the first CH bond cleavage via the alkyl pathway to be the RDS and Ga3+ sites to be barely covered by C3 species. At high , H2 desorption limits the reaction rate, and the other four elementary steps are quasi-equilibrated, leaving only H2 adsorbed on Ga sites. In both cases, the mechanism agrees to the negligible weight increase in the catalyst in the propane uptake experiment (Figure 5c).

Lastly, it is well known that BASs are highly active for the oligomerization and cyclization steps of alkane aromatization (2931) and contribute to fast catalyst deactivation. (59) Note that high aromatic selectivity (>50%) was observed at propane conversion above 20% on Ga-loaded H-MFI. (31,60,61) The very low aromatic selectivity on the Ga/BEA-X catalysts (<6% aromatic selectivity at 40% conversion, Figure S6) is enabled by the low acid strength and low concentration of BASs formed with hydrated lattice Ga3+. (18,43,62) The combination of the high concentration of the sLAS and the low concentration of the BAS is therefore concluded to be the key for the excellent propene selectivity of the investigated catalysts.
Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The controlled incorporation of Ga3+ in the *BEA zeolite via substitution into defect sites created by thermal removal of lattice Zn2+ led to a series of Ga/BEA zeolites with highly active and selective homotopic sites for PDH. The propane conversion rate increased first with the concentration of Ga (up to 3.2 wt % Ga loading) but decreased at higher Ga loadings. A very high propene selectivity of >82% was obtained at 19% propane conversion at 813 K, and a >72% selectivity was obtained at 40% conversion at 873 K on the 3.2 wt % Ga/BEA catalyst.
PDH exhibited first-order kinetics in propane and the KIE of 1.6 at low (2 mbar). At higher (up to 100 mbar), the reaction order in propane and the KIE decreased to 0.2 and 0.8, respectively. With in situ measurements showing a negligible increase in weight of the catalyst with an increase in up to 40 mbar, we exclude a high coverage of C3 species. Together with the kinetic analysis, we propose a gradual shift of the RDS from the first CH bond cleavage at low to H2 desorption at high . The associated kinetics and the underlying mechanism are identical for all catalysts investigated, with an activation energy of 155  8 kJ·mol1 for the first CH bond cleavage and 123  8 kJ·mol1 for the H2 desorption.
The acid sites responsible for the selective dehydrogenation are dehydrated Ga3+ sites in the lattice, as concluded by the strict correlation of these sites with the PDH rate. The TOF of PDH at these sites was estimated to be 3.1 × 102 molpropane·(molactive site·s)1. The lower BAS acid strength of hydrated Ga3+ in the BEA framework catalyzes aromatization only with a low rate. It is interesting to note that the active sites appear to be limited to a certain concentration and that higher Ga concentrations lead to less active sites characterized by Ga3+ cations at ion-exchange positions and GaOx nanoclusters.

Catalyst Preparation
The Ga/BEA catalyst was prepared via three steps: (i) hydrothermal synthesis of Zn-BEA, (ii) Ga addition to Zn-BEA via incipient wetness impregnation, and (iii) Zn leaching by thermal treatment in H2.
Hydrothermal synthesis of Zn-BEA was carried out according to a previously reported method. (47,63) The synthesis gel was prepared by adding colloidal silica (LUDOX@AS-40), zinc acetate dihydrate [Zn(OAc)2; Alfa Aesar, 98%], tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH; Sigma-Aldrich; 35 wt % in water), lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LiOH; Sigma-Aldrich; 99%), and deionized water in a molar composition of 1 SiO2:0.03 Zn(OAc)2:0.65 TEAOH:0.05 LiOH:30 H2O to a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) liner. Subsequently, the PTFE liner was introduced into a stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 410 K for 7.5 days. The obtained solid was separated from the liquid by centrifugation, washed with water and acetone, and dried at 353 K overnight. It was subsequently calcined in 100 mL·min1 synthetic air (20% O2 in N2) at 823 K (temperature increment: 1 K·min1) for 10 h to remove the structure-directing agent. The obtained zeolite material was converted into its proton form via ion exchange with 1 M NH4NO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) solution at 353 K for 10 h followed by the same calcination procedure as described above. These materials are referred to as Zn-BEA.
The Ga/Zn-BEA materials were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation of the above-prepared proton form of Zn-BEA zeolites with aqueous Ga(NO3)3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%) solution. The impregnated sample was dried at 353 K overnight and calcined in 100 mL·min1 synthetic air at 823 K (temperature increment: 5 K·min1) for 5 h. These materials are denoted Ga/Zn-BEA-X, where X refers to the Ga content (in wt %) in the sample.
In the final step, Zn-free Ga/BEA catalysts were obtained by the reduction of the above-prepared Ga/Zn-BEA-X zeolites. The Ga/Zn-BEA (particle size 180300 μm) was loaded into the isothermal zone of a vertical quartz glass tube (4 mm inner diameter) supported between two quartz wool plugs. The reduction was performed under 50 mL·min1 H2 at 823 K (temperature increment: 15 K·min1) for 24 h. The sample was subsequently removed from the quartz tube and calcined in 100 mL·min1 synthetic air at 823 K (temperature increment: 5 K·min1) for 5 h. These samples are denoted Ga/BEA-X, where X refers to the Ga content (in wt %) in the sample.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on a PANalytical Empyrean System diffractometer, equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source and operating at 45 kV and 40 mA. The diffractograms were measured using a sample spinner stage in the 2θ range between 5 and 50 under ambient conditions.
Ga and Zn contents in the samples were determined using a VARIAN AA280FS Fast Sequential Atomic Absorption Spectrometer. An aqueous solution of 2 vol % H2SO4, 1 vol % HNO3, and 5 vol % LaCl3 was used to digest the solid samples.
The N2 sorption measurements were performed using a PMI Automatic Sorptometer. The zeolite samples were outgassed under vacuum at 523 K for 2 h and cooled to liquid N2 temperature (77 K) before measurement. The surface area and the micropore volume of zeolites were determined by the BET and the t-plot (Lippens and de Boer) method, respectively. (64,65)
The concentration of acid sites in the catalysts was determined by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine using a Bruker VERTEX 70 IR spectrometer. All spectra were recorded at a specific temperature under <105 mbar vacuum. Prior to pyridine adsorption, a self-supporting wafer of the catalyst was activated in vacuum at 723 K (temperature increment: 15 K·min1) for 1 h. Pyridine was adsorbed on the catalyst at 313 K by increasing pressure from 102 to 1 mbar, and the final pressure was kept for at least 1 h until adsorption equilibrium was achieved. Subsequently, a spectrum was measured after the cell was outgassed under vacuum at 313 K overnight and then at 373, 573, and 723 K, for 1 h each. Concentrations of the LAS and BAS were determined via quantifications of the bands related to coordinatively adsorbed pyridine (at 1452, 1455, 1457, and 1460 cm1) and protonated pyridine (at 1545 and 1548 cm1) using molar extinction coefficients of 3.26 and 4.32 μmol·cm2, respectively. The LAS/BAS and the strong LAS/BAS (sLAS/sBAS) refer to the sites remaining after evacuation at 373 and 723 K, respectively.
Catalytic Reactions
The synthesized catalysts were tested for the PDH reaction in a fixed-bed plug-flow reactor consisting of a quartz glass tube with an inner diameter of 4 mm. In a typical test, 10 mg of the catalyst (particle size 180300 μm) was mixed with SiC (particle size 250500 μm) and was loaded in the isothermal zone of the quartz tube supported between two quartz wool plugs. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was dried in situ under 10 mL·min1 He at 823 K (temperature increment: 15 K·min1) for 1 h. Subsequently, the reaction was carried out at 1 bar total pressure (using He as carrier gas) and a total flow rate of 5100 mL·min1 [WHSV: 0.21106 gpropane·(gcatalyst·h)1] at 813 K. The pressure of propane was kept between 2 and 100 mbar. The products were detected with an online Agilent 6890 series gas chromatograph equipped with an HP-PLOT/Q column (30 m × 0.320 mm) and a flame ionization detector. The conversion of propane and yield of products were calculated based on the integrated peak areas in the gas chromatography (GC) chromatograms. The cracking rate was determined based on the concentration of produced methane, while the dehydrogenation rate was determined based on the concentration of produced propene.
Kinetic Isotope Measurements
Deuterated propane (C3D8; Sigma-Aldrich, 99 atom % D) was used for the measurements of the KIE. The experiments were performed by the same reaction procedure as described above at 2, 20, 40, 60, and 100 mbar of or at 813 K. After 21 h time on stream, that is, until the reaction was in a quasi-steady state, the reactant feed was first switched from C3H8 to He for 0.5 h to flush the remaining C3H8 and subsequently switched from He to C3D8. After flowing C3D8 for 1.5 h, the flow was again switched to He for 0.5 h and finally switched back to C3H8. During the experiment, the product stream was analyzed by online GC every 30 min. The procedure was repeated twice at each .
Propane Uptake Measurements
Propane uptake on the Ga/BEA-3.2 catalyst was measured at 813 K and ambient pressure under flow conditions in a Setaram SENSYS evo TG-DSC thermogravimetric analyzer. The measurements were performed under the same conditions as those for the catalytic activity measurements. Prior to the experiment, the catalyst was activated under 10 mL·min1 He at 823 K (temperature increment: 15 K·min1) for 1 h. After cooling to 813 K, the catalyst was exposed to a stream with variable (i.e., 4, 10, 20, and 40 mbar) and a total flowrate of 100 mL·min1 (with He as carrier gas) for 10 min. In between the switch to a different , the gas stream was changed to 100 mL·min1 He for 10 min. The weight of the catalyst was monitored during the entire process with a microbalance.
Propane Adsorption Measurements
The heat of adsorption of propane on the Ga/BEA-3.2 catalyst was measured with a Setaram TG-DSC 111 calorimeter connected to a high-vacuum system. The catalyst (20 mg) was placed in a quartz crucible and activated at 723 K for 1 h under vacuum (<106 mbar). After cooling to 313 K, propane was step-wise dosed at controlled pressure ranging from 0.3 to 24 mbar. Each step was equilibrated until the sample weight and thermal flux were constant. The adsorption enthalpy was obtained by integration of the heat flux signal and was normalized to the propane uptake.
