I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

The Structure of Active Sites in MeVO Catalysts (Me = Mg, Zn, Pb) and Its Influence on the Catalytic Performance in the Oxidative Dehydrogenation (ODH) of Propane
Abstract
MeVO catalysts (Me = Mg, Zn, Pb) of different Me : V ratios were characterized with respect to phase composition, structure and valence state of vanadium sites as well as composition and acidbase properties of the surface using XRD, TEM, TPR, TPD/TPRS, FTIR, potentiometric titration, XPS, EPR, and UV/VIS-DRS. The latter two techniques were also applied in situ under catalytic reaction conditions. The following structurereactivity relationships were derived by comparing the results of catalyst characterization with those of catalytic tests: Both V5+ and V4+ catalyze the ODH of propane; however, V4+ seems to be more selective though less active than V5+. V sites in octahedral or square pyramidal coordination are more active but less selective than VO4 tetrahedra. Isolated VO4 and V2O7 units as present in crystalline metal ortho- and pyrovanadates, respectively, are more selective but less active than VOx species in amorphous clusters or even in crystalline chain- or layer-like structures. The differences in the catalytic properties arising from different metal cations are governed not only by the oxidation potential of the latter but also to a major degree by the acidbase properties, the crystal size and the extent of structural disorder. Catalytic activity and selectivity of the MeVO catalysts decrease in the order Mg>Pb>Zn. The lower activity of ZnVO and PbVO catalysts in comparison with MgVO samples of similar composition is assumed to be due to large crystallites with low surface defect concentration.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
