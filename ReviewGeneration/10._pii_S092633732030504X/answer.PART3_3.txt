[1] "VOx/Al2O3 was synthesized via incipient wetness impregnation."

[2] "Phosphine modification of the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst was carried out in a chemical vapor deposition system."

[3] "Sodium hypophosphite monohydrate was put upstream in a crucible placed in the quartz tube, and the VOx/Al2O3 was placed in the downstream."

[4] "Phosphine tends to eliminate weaker LAS on the surface of alumina support."

[5] "The insertion of phosphorus into polymerized vanadium species decreased polymerization degree and formed more isolated vanadium species."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It synthesizes VOx/Al2O3 catalysts via incipient wetness impregnation. It then modifies the catalysts with phosphine in a chemical vapor deposition system to insert phosphorus species and break up polymerized vanadium oxides into more isolated species. This phosphine treatment is found to enhance dispersion.

[1] "X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) data were acquired on an ESCALAB 250Xi instrument with an 18.2W laser monochromatic Al Kα radiation." 

[2] "The characteristic V 2p3/2 peak was fitted and deconvoluted into 2 peaks for fresh catalysts ascribed to pentavalent and tetravalent vanadium oxidation states."

[3] "For the used catalysts (8h), the V 2p3/2 peak was deconvoluted into 3 peaks including V3+." 

[4] "After PDH reaction, binding energies of V5+ and V4+ are slightly higher than for the fresh catalysts due to the presence of carbonaceous deposit."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It acquires XPS data on fresh and used catalysts. For the fresh catalysts, it deconvolutes the V 2p3/2 peak into V5+ and V4+ components. For the used catalysts, it fits the peak with additional V3+ component, showing reduction of vanadium species during the reaction. The binding energies also provide insights into metal-support interactions.
