<quotes>
[1] "This is also confirmed by the presence of a new band at 1015cm−1, characteristic of VO stretching mode in isolated tetrahedral-coordinated VO4 [14,35,36,38,39], indicating the presence of more isolated vanadium species."

[2] "Peaks at 1653, 1638, 1595cm−1 are assigned to pyridine adsorbed on AlIII, AlIV and AlV, respectively [25,26]." 

[3] "According to Dong et al., the difference in acidic strength between AlIII and AlIV is not significant, while AlV has obviously weaker acidic strength than both of AlIII and AlIV [27]."

[4] "The insertion of phosphorus into polymerized vanadium species decreased polymerization degree and formed more isolated vanadium species, which has lower dehydrogenation reactivity."

[5] "Furthermore, it weakened the interaction between vanadium species and alumina, and also reduced initial reactivity of the catalysts."

[6] "However, weakened vanadium-support interaction made vanadium sites more repulsive to active intermediates and propylene products, which can desorb more easily from the catalysts surface."

[7] "More isolated vanadium species also expanded the distance between active propylene intermediates and reduced the possibility of oligomerization, thus inhibited coking of the catalysts."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explores metal-support interfacial effects in vanadium oxide/alumina catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that phosphine modification inserts phosphorus into polymerized vanadium oxide species on alumina, decreasing polymerization and forming more isolated vanadium species (Quote 1). This weakens the interaction between vanadium and alumina (Quote 5). The modified catalysts have less polymerized vanadium species anchored to penta- and tetra-coordinated aluminum sites (Quotes 2-3). The weaker vanadium-alumina interaction makes vanadium sites more repulsive to intermediates like propylene, facilitating their desorption (Quote 6). More isolated vanadium species also increases the distance between intermediates, reducing oligomerization and coking (Quote 7). So phosphorus modification modulates the metal-support interface to enhance catalyst stability, at the expense of some initial activity loss (Quote 4).

Answer: 该文章探究了钒氧化物/氧化铝催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的金属-载体界面效应。它显示磷化改性将磷插入聚合的氧化钒种在氧化铝上的种,降低聚合度并形成更多隔离的钒种(引文1)。这削弱了钒与氧化铝之间的相互作用(引文5)。改性后的催化剂中有更少的聚合钒种锚定在五配位和四配位的铝位点上(引文2-3)。较弱的钒-氧化铝相互作用使钒位点对中间产物如丙烯更具排斥性,促进它们的脱附(引文6)。更多的隔离钒种也增加了�间产物之间的距离,减少低聚和焦炭化(引文7)。�此,磷的改性通过调节金属-载体界面来增强催化��的稳定性,以换取一定的初始活性损失(引文4)。

[1] "The synergy of surface acidic properties, electronic and geometric effects after phosphine modification accounted for the stability enhancement."

[1] "In this context, we modified VOx/Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation with PH3 surface treatment, which leads to great improvement of catalyst stability by inhibiting coking deposition during propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Experimental results revealed that the synergy among tuned acidity, lower coking precursor intimacy and faster propylene desorption after phosphorus modification accounted for the enhancement in catalytic stability during propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "Compared to conventional phosphate impregnation, phosphine interacted extensively with alumina support and vanadium species without causing structural destructions." 

[4] "The insertion of phosphorus into polymerized vanadium species decreased polymerization degree and formed more isolated vanadium species, which has lower dehydrogenation reactivity."

[5] "Furthermore, it weakened the interaction between vanadium species and alumina, and also reduced initial reactivity of the catalysts."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of VOx/Al2O3 affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that modifying VOx/Al2O3 with phosphine treatment tunes surface acidity, separates polymerized vanadium species to form more isolated species, and weakens vanadium-support interactions. These changes inhibit coking and result in enhanced catalytic stability, at the expense of some loss in initial activity. The specific effects are decreased polymerization degree, more isolated vanadium species, tuned acidity, weaker vanadium-support interactions, easier desorption of propylene, and inhibition of coke precursor oligomerization.
