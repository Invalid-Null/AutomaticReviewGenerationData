<quotes>
[1] "In this context, we modified VOx/Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation with PH3 surface treatment, which leads to great improvement of catalyst stability by inhibiting coking deposition during propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Experimental results revealed that the synergy among tuned acidity, lower coking precursor intimacy and faster propylene desorption after phosphorus modification accounted for the enhancement in catalytic stability during propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "Compared to conventional phosphate impregnation, phosphine interacted extensively with alumina support and vanadium species without causing structural destructions." 

[4] "The insertion of phosphorus into polymerized vanadium species decreased polymerization degree and formed more isolated vanadium species, which has lower dehydrogenation reactivity."

[5] "Furthermore, it weakened the interaction between vanadium species and alumina, and also reduced initial reactivity of the catalysts."

[6] "However, weakened vanadium-support interaction made vanadium sites more repulsive to active intermediates and propylene products, which can desorb more easily from the catalysts surface."

[7] "More isolated vanadium species also expanded the distance between active propylene intermediates and reduced the possibility of oligomerization, thus inhibited coking of the catalysts."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of VOx/Al2O3 affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that modifying VOx/Al2O3 with phosphine treatment tunes surface acidity, separates polymerized vanadium species to form more isolated species, and weakens vanadium-support interactions. These changes inhibit coking and result in enhanced catalytic stability, at the expense of some loss in initial activity. The specific effects are decreased polymerization degree, more isolated vanadium species, tuned acidity, weaker vanadium-support interactions, easier desorption of propylene, and inhibition of coke precursor oligomerization.

回答:是的,该文探究了调节VOx/Al2O3的氧化态、氧迁移性和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它显示,用磷化氢处理VOx/Al2O3可以调节表面酸度,将聚合的钒种分离形成更多孤立种,以及削弱钒与支撑体的相互作用。这些变化抑制了焦炭形成,但以部分初期活性损失为代价,提高了催化稳定性。具体效应包括聚合度降低、形成更多孤立钒种、调节酸度、削弱钒与支撑体相互作用、丙烯更易脱附,以及抑制焦炭前体成簇。

[1] "Phosphine modification of the catalysts was carried out in a chemical vapor deposition system (Nabertherm, Germany). Sodium hypophosphite monohydrate (Sionpharm, China) was put upstream in a crucible placed in the quartz tube, and the VOx/Al2O3 was placed in the downstream." 

[2] "Experimental results revealed that the synergy among tuned acidity, lower coking precursor intimacy and faster propylene desorption after phosphorus modification accounted for the enhancement in catalytic stability during propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "Furthermore, it weakened the interaction between vanadium species and alumina, and also reduced initial reactivity of the catalysts."

Answer: Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in VOx/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that phosphine modification weakens the interaction between vanadium species and the alumina support. This facilitates desorption of propylene intermediates/products from the catalyst surface, enhancing selectivity and stability.
