<quotes>
[1] Vanadium (Acros, 99%) and/or chromium (Fluka, purum >97%) acetyl acetonate was dissolved in 300 mL toluene (Roth, >99.5%, less than 50 ppm H2O) and 1.2 g MCM-41 was added to the solution.

[2] The maximum possible densities for a monolayer coverage by VOx and CrOx species on SiO2 are 1 V nm2 and 0.54 Cr nm2, respectively. Taking these values into account, it is possible that our catalysts possess only highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species.  

[3]  According to [33], such spectrum is typical for isolated CrOx species, in which Cr is in its highest oxidation state.

Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses impregnation of vanadium and chromium acetylacetonate dissolved in toluene onto MCM-41 silica support. Based on the metal loadings achieved, it is proposed that the VOx and CrOx species may be highly dispersed as isolated surface species. In situ UV-vis spectroscopy confirms the presence of isolated CrOx species in the fresh CrOx/MCM-41 catalyst.

答:这篇文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它使用溶解在甲苯中的钒和铬乙酰丙酮浸渍MCM-41硅胶载体。根据所达到的金属载量,建议VOx和CrOx种类可能高度分散为隔离的表面种类。原位UV-vis光谱确认了新制CrOx/MCM-41催化剂中存在隔离的CrOx种类。

[1] In situ UV/Vis experiments were performed using an AVASPEC fiber optical spectrometer (Avantes) equipped with a DH-2000 deuteriumhalogen light source and a CCD array detector.  

[2] In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation of the used catalysts enabled us to elucidate the origins of the catalysts deactivation.

[3] In situ UV/Vis analysis in combination with TPO of spent catalysts enabled us to identify factors governing catalysts deactivation within a single DH cycle and over several DH/regeneration cycles.

<English version answer>  
Answer: The article utilizes in-situ UV-vis spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses a fiber optic probe inside the reactor to monitor spectral changes during reaction. This enables insights into catalyst reduction, coke formation, and changes in metal oxide species during reaction and regeneration cycles.
