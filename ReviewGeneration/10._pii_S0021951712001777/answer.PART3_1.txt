[1] "Supported catalysts were prepared according to the procedure described in [19]. Briefly, vanadium (Acros, 99%) and/or chromium (Fluka, purum >97%) acetyl acetonate was dissolved in 300 mL toluene (Roth, >99.5%, less than 50 ppm H2O) and 1.2 g MCM-41 was added to the solution."

[2] "PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared according to [6] using commercial alumina carrier (NORPRO, Saint-Gobain, 93 m2/g)."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes preparing VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 by impregnating MCM-41 with metal acetylacetonates dissolved in toluene. It also mentions preparing PtSn/Al2O3 using a commercial alumina carrier.

[1] "In situ UV/Vis experiments were performed using an AVASPEC fiber optical spectrometer (Avantes) equipped with a DH-2000 deuteriumhalogen light source and a CCD array detector." 

[2] "In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation of the used catalysts enabled us to elucidate the origins of the catalysts deactivation within one DH cycle and over several DH-regeneration cycles."

[3] "In situ UV/Vis analysis in combination with TPO of spent catalysts enabled us to identify factors governing catalysts deactivation within a single DH cycle and over several DH/regeneration cycles."
</quotes>

<English version answer> 
Answer: The article utilizes in-situ UV/Vis spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It examines catalyst deactivation within single DH cycles and over multiple cycles using time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature programmed oxidation. The in-situ techniques provide insights into the nature of coke formation and changes in metal oxide species during reaction.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
答案:本文利用原位UV/Vis光谱技术研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它使用时间分辨UV/Vis光谱技术和程序升温氧化,检查单个DH循环内和多个循环间的催化剂失活。原位技术提供了反应过程中焦炭形成的性质和金属氧化物种的变化方面的见解。
