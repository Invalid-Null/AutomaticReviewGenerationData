[1] The propene yield in the 1st dehydrogenation cycle over oxidized VOx/MCM-41, CrOx/MCM-41, and PtSn/Al2O3 decreased during 24 h by a factor of 1.5, 2.4, and 2.2, respectively.

[2] Propene is one of the most important base chemical intermediates mainly used in polymer and rubber industry.

[3] An additional benefit of VOx/MCM-41 is that in contrast to PtSn/Al2O3, it does not require a reductive activation for catalyzing the DH reaction because oxidized and reduced VOx species are comparable in their activity and on-stream stability.

<English version answer>

1. The article explains that oxidized VOx/MCM-41 was the most stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, losing only about 30% of its initial activity over 24 hours, compared to 60% and 55% losses for CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 respectively.

2. The article states that propylene is one of the most important chemical intermediates, used mainly in polymer and rubber industries. 

3. The article describes that VOx/MCM-41 does not require reductive activation before catalyzing propane dehydrogenation, unlike PtSn/Al2O3, because its oxidized and reduced forms have similar catalytic activity and stability.

4. The article does not provide information on how catalysts lower activation energy barriers for propane dehydrogenation.

5. The article does not discuss any DFT calculations applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms or pathways.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics. 

7. The article does not describe any computational or experimental work to identify catalyst descriptors correlated with propane dehydrogenation performance.
