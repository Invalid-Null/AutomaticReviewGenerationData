I carefully compared the quotes and answers from each file to the correct answers provided. I scored each answer file's response for a given question as either 100% consistent or 0% consistent with the correct answer. For partial consistency, I estimated a percentage based on how much of the key information from the correct answer was present in the file's answer.
