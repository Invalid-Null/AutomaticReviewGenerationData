<quotes>
[1] Supported catalysts were prepared according to the procedure described in [19]. Briefly, vanadium (Acros, 99%) and/or chromium (Fluka, purum >97%) acetyl acetonate was dissolved in 300 mL toluene (Roth, >99.5%, less than 50 ppm H2O) and 1.2 g MCM-41 was added to the solution.

[2] Highly dispersed VOx species on silica with high surface area afforded high propane conversion and propene selectivity [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21].

[1] In situ UV/Vis experiments were performed using an AVASPEC fiber optical spectrometer (Avantes) equipped with a DH-2000 deuteriumhalogen light source and a CCD array detector. 

[2] In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation of the used catalysts enabled us to elucidate the origins of the catalysts deactivation within one DH cycle and over several DH-regeneration cycles.

[3] In situ UV/Vis analysis in combination with TPO of spent catalysts enabled us to identify factors governing catalysts deactivation within a single DH cycle and over several DH/regeneration cycles.
