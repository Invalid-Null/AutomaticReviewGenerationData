[1] "Supported catalysts were prepared according to the procedure described in [19]. Briefly, vanadium (Acros, 99%) and/or chromium (Fluka, purum >97%) acetyl acetonate was dissolved in 300 mL toluene (Roth, >99.5%, less than 50 ppm H2O) and 1.2 g MCM-41 was added to the solution."

[2] "PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared according to [6] using commercial alumina carrier (NORPRO, Saint-Gobain, 93 m2/g)."

[3] "Highly dispersed VOx species on silica with high surface area afforded high propane conversion and propene selectivity [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]."

[1] "In situ UV/Vis experiments were performed using an AVASPEC fiber optical spectrometer (Avantes) equipped with a DH-2000 deuteriumhalogen light source and a CCD array detector."

[2] "In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation of the used catalysts enabled us to elucidate the origins of the catalysts deactivation." 

[3] "In situ UV/Vis analysis in combination with TPO of spent catalysts enabled us to identify factors governing catalysts deactivation within a single DH cycle and over several DH/regeneration cycles."

[4] "The remarkable ability of VOx/MCM-41 to completely recover its DH activity and selectivity upon oxidative regeneration is explained by the fact that the nature of highly dispersed active VOx species was not changed under the reaction conditions and/or during the regeneration."
