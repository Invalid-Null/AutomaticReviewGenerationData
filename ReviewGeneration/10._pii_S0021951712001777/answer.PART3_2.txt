<quotes>
[1] "Supported catalysts were prepared according to the procedure described in [19]. Briefly, vanadium (Acros, 99%) and/or chromium (Fluka, purum >97%) acetyl acetonate was dissolved in 300 mL toluene (Roth, >99.5%, less than 50 ppm H2O) and 1.2 g MCM-41 was added to the solution."

[2] "From the BET data and the content of chromium and vanadium, we calculated their apparent surface densities. The respective values for vanadium and chromium on VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 are 0.58 V nm2 and 0.24 Cr nm2. According to [30], [31], the maximum possible densities for a monolayer coverage by VOx and CrOx species on SiO2 are 1 V nm2 and 0.54 Cr nm2, respectively. Taking these values into account, it is possible that our catalysts possess only highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species."

[3] "The distribution of surface VOx and CrOx species was further studied by UV/Vis spectroscopy."

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes preparing supported VOx and CrOx catalysts by impregnating MCM-41 with metal acetylacetonate precursors dissolved in toluene. It calculates the surface densities of VOx and CrOx species on the catalysts and compares them to theoretical monolayer densities, concluding that the catalysts likely possess only highly dispersed surface metal oxide species. UV-vis spectroscopy is used to further study the distribution of surface metal oxide species.

答:是的,本文研究了针对优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它描述了通过在甲苯中溶解金属乙酰丙酮前体来浸渍MCM-41制备支持VOx和CrOx催化剂。它计算了催化剂上VOx和CrOx物种的表面密度,并与理论单分子层密度进行了比较,得出催化剂可能只具有高度分散的表面金属氧化物种。UV-Vis光谱用于进一步研究表面金属氧化物种的分布。

[1] "In situ UV/Vis experiments were performed using an AVASPEC fiber optical spectrometer (Avantes) equipped with a DH-2000 deuteriumhalogen light source and a CCD array detector." 

[2] "In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation of the used catalysts enabled us to elucidate the origins of the catalysts deactivation."

[3] "An increase in the relative KubelkaMunk function in the 420800 nm range after 0.5 h in H2 flow at 823 K is related to the reduction of V5+ to V4+/V3+ [28], [38], [39]. From this UV/Vis spectrum and our findings made in the in situ spectroscopic study of VOx/SiO2TiO2 redox behavior [39], we conclude that the changes in the UV/Vis spectra of VOx/MCM-41 during DH reaction are related to the formation of coke species."

[4] "In situ UV/Vis analysis in combination with TPO of spent catalysts enabled us to identify factors governing catalysts deactivation within a single DH cycle and over several DH/regeneration cycles."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ UV-vis spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It performs time-resolved UV-vis spectroscopy on the catalysts during propane dehydrogenation reactions to monitor changes related to metal oxide reduction and coke formation. The UV-vis results are correlated with temperature programmed oxidation experiments to elucidate deactivation mechanisms occurring within single reaction cycles and over multiple reaction/regeneration cycles.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文利用了原位UV-vis光谱来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它在丙烷脱氢反应过程中对催化剂进行时间分辨的UV-vis光谱学分析,以监测与金属氧化物还原和焦炭形成有关的变化。UV-vis结果与程序升温氧化实验相关,以阐明单个反应周期内和多个反应/再生周期中发生的失活机理。
