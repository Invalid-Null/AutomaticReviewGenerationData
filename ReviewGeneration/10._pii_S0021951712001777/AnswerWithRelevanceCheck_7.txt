         [1] Supported catalysts were prepared according to the procedure described in [19]. Briefly, vanadium (Acros, 99%) and/or chromium (Fluka, purum >97%) acetyl acetonate was dissolved in 300 mL toluene (Roth, >99.5%, less than 50 ppm H2O) and 1.2 g MCM-41 was added to the solution.

         [2] The VOx/MCM-41 catalyst loses only 25% of its initial activity within 24 h on-stream, which is fully recovered upon oxidative regeneration at the same temperature as demonstrated for four consecutive DH/regeneration cycles.

         [3] In terms of on-stream stability, VOx/MCM-41 clearly surpasses industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 tested under the same reaction conditions.

         Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes preparing supported catalysts by dissolving metal precursors in solvent, adding the support, drying, and calcining. It also shows that high dispersion of VOx species in MCM-41 results in good stability for propane dehydrogenation.

         答案:是的,本文研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它描述了将金属前体溶解在溶剂中,加入载体,干燥和煅烧的制备受支撑的催化剂的方法。它还表明VOx物种在MCM-41中的高分散度导致丙烷脱氢具有良好的稳定性。

         [1] In situ UV/Vis analysis in combination with TPO of spent catalysts enabled us to identify factors governing catalysts deactivation within a single DH cycle and over several DH/regeneration cycles. 

         [2] The remarkable ability of VOx/MCM-41 to completely recover its DH activity and selectivity upon oxidative regeneration is explained by the fact that the nature of highly dispersed active VOx species was not changed under the reaction conditions and/or during the regeneration.

      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ UV/Vis characterization to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows that this technique in combination with TPO can provide insights into deactivation mechanisms occurring within a cycle and over multiple cycles. It also reveals that VOx species remain highly dispersed in MCM-41 during reaction.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         答案:是的,本文利用了原位UV/Vis表征技术来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它表明这种技术与TPO相结合可以提供关于在一个循环中和多个循环中发生的失活机理的见解。它还揭示VOx物种在MCM-41中的高度分散性在反应过程中得以保持。
