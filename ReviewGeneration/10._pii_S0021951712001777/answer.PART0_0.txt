[1] Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes are the two promising industrially applied alternatives.

[2] Commercial propane DH is carried out at temperatures above 800 K due to thermodynamic constraints. As a consequence, propane/propene cracking and formation of coke occur contributing to the selectivity loss [1]. Commercial catalysts applied in this process contain supported CrOx or Pt species as active components. 

[3] Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view. The reaction is exothermic, hence higher conversion can be achieved at lower temperature.

2. Yes, the article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers. It states that catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane allows the reaction to occur at lower temperatures than would be required without a catalyst, due to thermodynamic constraints. The oxidative dehydrogenation route using lattice oxygen is also described as more attractive thermodynamically.

4. Yes, the article discusses the thermodynamic constraints and formation of byproducts like coke that impact propane dehydrogenation. It states that high temperatures above 800 K are required for commercial processes due to thermodynamics, leading to cracking and coke formation. The exothermic oxidative route is noted as more favorable thermodynamically to achieve higher conversion at lower temperature. But quantitative details of thermodynamics and kinetics are not provided.
