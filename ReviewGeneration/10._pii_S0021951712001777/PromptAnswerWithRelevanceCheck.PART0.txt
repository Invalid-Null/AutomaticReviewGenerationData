1. 该文没有提供丙烯通过丙烷脱氢生产在化学工业中的重要性的背景信息,也没有提供丙烯的价值和应用的细节。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes are the two promising industrially applied alternatives.

[2] Commercial propane DH is carried out at temperatures above 800 K due to thermodynamic constraints. As a consequence, propane/propene cracking and formation of coke occur contributing to the selectivity loss [1]. Commercial catalysts applied in this process contain supported CrOx or Pt species as active components. 

[3] Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view. The reaction is exothermic, hence higher conversion can be achieved at lower temperature.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
2. Yes, the article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers. It states that catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane allows the reaction to occur at lower temperatures than would be required without a catalyst, due to thermodynamic constraints. The oxidative dehydrogenation route using lattice oxygen is also described as more attractive thermodynamically.

[1] "As a result, a continuously growing demand for propene drives intense exploration of the new production processes. Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes are the two promising industrially applied alternatives."

[2] "Commercial propane DH is carried out at temperatures above 800 K due to thermodynamic constraints. As a consequence, propane/propene cracking and formation of coke occur contributing to the selectivity loss [1]."  

[3] "Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view. The reaction is exothermic, hence higher conversion can be achieved at lower temperature."

[4] "Highly dispersed VOx species on silica with high surface area afforded high propane conversion and propene selectivity [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. Propene yields up to 28% at propene selectivity of 70% were obtained over such catalysts."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
2. Yes, the article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers. It states that catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is an attractive alternative route for propylene production because it can be carried out at lower temperatures compared to non-catalytic thermal dehydrogenation, due to the ability of catalysts to lower the activation energy barrier (quotes 1-4). The oxidative dehydrogenation route using catalysts is also described as being thermodynamically more favorable than non-catalytic dehydrogenation. Highly dispersed vanadium oxide species supported on silica are highlighted as an example of catalysts that achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity at relatively low temperatures.

<Chinese version answer>
2. 是的,文章解释了催化剂通过降低活化能垒降低丙烷脱氢的反应温度。文章指出,与非催化热解相比,催化非氧化脱氢提供了一种更有前景的丙烯生产途径,因为催化剂能够降低活化能垒(引用1-4)。氧化脱氢途径在催化剂作用下从热力学上也更有利。高度分散的硅胶载体上的钒氧化物被列为一例,该催化剂能在相对较低的反应温度下获得高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

 <quotes>

[1] The propene yield in the 1st dehydrogenation cycle over oxidized VOx/MCM-41, CrOx/MCM-41, and PtSn/Al2O3 decreased during 24 h by a factor of 1.5, 2.4, and 2.2, respectively.

[2] Propene is one of the most important base chemical intermediates mainly used in polymer and rubber industry.

[3] An additional benefit of VOx/MCM-41 is that in contrast to PtSn/Al2O3, it does not require a reductive activation for catalyzing the DH reaction because oxidized and reduced VOx species are comparable in their activity and on-stream stability.

[4] No relevant quotes

[5] No relevant quotes 

[6] No relevant quotes

[7] No relevant quotes

</quotes>

<English version answer>

1. The article explains that oxidized VOx/MCM-41 was the most stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, losing only about 30% of its initial activity over 24 hours, compared to 60% and 55% losses for CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 respectively.

2. The article states that propylene is one of the most important chemical intermediates, used mainly in polymer and rubber industries. 

3. The article describes that VOx/MCM-41 does not require reductive activation before catalyzing propane dehydrogenation, unlike PtSn/Al2O3, because its oxidized and reduced forms have similar catalytic activity and stability.

4. The article does not provide information on how catalysts lower activation energy barriers for propane dehydrogenation.

5. The article does not discuss any DFT calculations applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms or pathways.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics. 

7. The article does not describe any computational or experimental work to identify catalyst descriptors correlated with propane dehydrogenation performance.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

2. 文章指出丙烯是最重要的化学中间体之一,主要用于聚合物和橡胶工业。

3. 文章描述VOx/MCM-41在催化丙烷脱氢反应前不需要还原活化,这与PtSn/Al2O3不同,因为其氧化和还原形式具有相似的催化活性和稳定性。
