<quotes>
[1] Vanadium (Acros, 99%) and/or chromium (Fluka, purum >97%) acetyl acetonate was dissolved in 300 mL toluene (Roth, >99.5%, less than 50 ppm H2O) and 1.2 g MCM-41 was added to the solution.

[2] The maximum possible densities for a monolayer coverage by VOx and CrOx species on SiO2 are 1 V nm2 and 0.54 Cr nm2, respectively. Taking these values into account, it is possible that our catalysts possess only highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species.  

[3]  According to [33], such spectrum is typical for isolated CrOx species, in which Cr is in its highest oxidation state.

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses impregnation of vanadium and chromium acetylacetonate dissolved in toluene onto MCM-41 silica support. Based on the metal loadings achieved, it is proposed that the VOx and CrOx species may be highly dispersed as isolated surface species. In situ UV-vis spectroscopy confirms the presence of isolated CrOx species in the fresh CrOx/MCM-41 catalyst.

[2] "From the BET data and the content of chromium and vanadium, we calculated their apparent surface densities. The respective values for vanadium and chromium on VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 are 0.58 V nm2 and 0.24 Cr nm2. According to [30], [31], the maximum possible densities for a monolayer coverage by VOx and CrOx species on SiO2 are 1 V nm2 and 0.54 Cr nm2, respectively. Taking these values into account, it is possible that our catalysts possess only highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species."

[3] "The distribution of surface VOx and CrOx species was further studied by UV/Vis spectroscopy."
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes preparing supported VOx and CrOx catalysts by impregnating MCM-41 with metal acetylacetonate precursors dissolved in toluene. It calculates the surface densities of VOx and CrOx species on the catalysts and compares them to theoretical monolayer densities, concluding that the catalysts likely possess only highly dispersed surface metal oxide species.

[3] "An increase in the relative KubelkaMunk function in the 420800 nm range after 0.5 h in H2 flow at 823 K is related to the reduction of V5+ to V4+/V3+ [28], [38], [39]. From this UV/Vis spectrum and our findings made in the in situ spectroscopic study of VOx/SiO2TiO2 redox behavior [39], we conclude that the changes in the UV/Vis spectra of VOx/MCM-41 during DH reaction are related to the formation of coke species."
