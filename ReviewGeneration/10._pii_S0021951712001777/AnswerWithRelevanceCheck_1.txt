         [1] Supported catalysts were prepared according to the procedure described in [19]. Briefly, vanadium (Acros, 99%) and/or chromium (Fluka, purum &gt;97%) acetyl acetonate was dissolved in 300 mL toluene (Roth, &gt;99.5%, less than 50 ppm H2O) and 1.2 g MCM-41 was added to the solution.
         
         [2] Highly dispersed VOx species on silica with high surface area afforded high propane conversion and propene selectivity [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21].
