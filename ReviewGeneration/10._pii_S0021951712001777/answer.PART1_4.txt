[1] "both oxidative (with participation of lattice oxygen) and non-oxidative propane DH contribute to the initial propene production over the oxidized catalysts, while only non-oxidative DH occurs over the reduced ones."

[2] "The corresponding values for vanadium and chromium on VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 are 0.58 V nm2 and 0.24 Cr nm2. According to [30], [31], the maximum possible densities for a monolayer coverage by VOx and CrOx species on SiO2 are 1 V nm2 and 0.54 Cr nm2, respectively. Taking these values into account, it is possible that our catalysts possess only highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species."

[3] "In addition, it was found that reduction of oxidized MeOx (Me = V and Cr) species before or during the DH reaction (with H2 and C3H8, respectively) contributed to the deactivation of particularly CrOx/MCM-41, since reduced CrOx species are at least 25% less active than the oxidized ones."

2. The article investigates how tuning oxidation states and oxygen mobility of VOx and CrOx affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that oxidized VOx and CrOx species participate in oxidative dehydrogenation using lattice oxygen, while reduced species only perform non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The highly dispersed VOx and CrOx species likely have high oxygen mobility. The oxidized species are more active, with reduced CrOx being 25% less active.

2. 该文献研究了调节VOx和CrOx的氧化态及氧迁移性如何影响丙烷脱氢反应性能。结果显示,氧化态的VOx和CrOx物种能够参与氧化-脱氢反应,利用晶格氧;而还原后的物种只能进行非氧化脱氢。高度分散的VOx和CrOx物种可能具有高氧迁移性。氧化态物种的活性更高,还原后的CrOx活性降低了25%。
