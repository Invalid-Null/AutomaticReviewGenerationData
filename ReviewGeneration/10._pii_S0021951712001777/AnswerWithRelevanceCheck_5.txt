[1] Vanadium (Acros, 99%) and/or chromium (Fluka, purum >97%) acetyl acetonate was dissolved in 300 mL toluene (Roth, >99.5%, less than 50 ppm H2O) and 1.2 g MCM-41 was added to the solution. 

[2] PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared according to [6] using commercial alumina carrier (NORPRO, Saint-Gobain, 93 m2/g).

[3] Supported catalysts were prepared according to the procedure described in [19]. Briefly, vanadium (Acros, 99%) and/or chromium (Fluka, purum >97%) acetyl acetonate was dissolved in 300 mL toluene (Roth, >99.5%, less than 50 ppm H2O) and 1.2 g MCM-41 was added to the solution.

[4] From the BET data and the content of chromium and vanadium, we calculated their apparent surface densities. The respective values for vanadium and chromium on VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 are 0.58 V nm2 and 0.24 Cr nm2. According to [30], [31], the maximum possible densities for a monolayer coverage by VOx and CrOx species on SiO2 are 1 V nm2 and 0.54 Cr nm2, respectively. Taking these values into account, it is possible that our catalysts possess only highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species.

Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes impregnating metal precursors dissolved in solvent onto supports like MCM-41 and alumina. The achieved metal oxide loadings indicate the VOx and CrOx species may be highly dispersed. UV-vis spectroscopy confirms the presence of isolated CrOx species in one catalyst.

答案:文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它描述了在溶剂中溶解金属前体后浸渍MCM-41和氧化铝等载体。所获得的金属氧化物载量表明VOx和CrOx种类可能高度分散。UV-vis光谱确认了一个催化剂中存在隔离的CrOx种类。

[1] In situ UV/Vis experiments were performed using an AVASPEC fiber optical spectrometer (Avantes) equipped with a DH-2000 deuteriumhalogen light source and a CCD array detector.

[2] In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation of the used catalysts enabled us to elucidate the origins of the catalysts deactivation within one DH cycle and over several DH-regeneration cycles. 

[3] In situ UV/Vis analysis in combination with TPO of spent catalysts enabled us to identify factors governing catalysts deactivation within a single DH cycle and over several DH/regeneration cycles.

[4] An increase in the relative KubelkaMunk function in the 420800 nm range after 0.5 h in H2 flow at 823 K is related to the reduction of V5+ to V4+/V3+ [28], [38], [39]. From this UV/Vis spectrum and our findings made in the in situ spectroscopic study of VOx/SiO2TiO2 redox behavior [39], we conclude that the changes in the UV/Vis spectra of VOx/MCM-41 during DH reaction are related to the formation of coke species.
