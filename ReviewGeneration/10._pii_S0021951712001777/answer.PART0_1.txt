[1] "As a result, a continuously growing demand for propene drives intense exploration of the new production processes. Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes are the two promising industrially applied alternatives."

[2] "Commercial propane DH is carried out at temperatures above 800 K due to thermodynamic constraints. As a consequence, propane/propene cracking and formation of coke occur contributing to the selectivity loss [1]."  

[3] "Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view. The reaction is exothermic, hence higher conversion can be achieved at lower temperature."

[4] "Highly dispersed VOx species on silica with high surface area afforded high propane conversion and propene selectivity [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. Propene yields up to 28% at propene selectivity of 70% were obtained over such catalysts."

2. Yes, the article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers. It states that catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is an attractive alternative route for propylene production because it can be carried out at lower temperatures compared to non-catalytic thermal dehydrogenation, due to the ability of catalysts to lower the activation energy barrier (quotes 1-4). The oxidative dehydrogenation route using catalysts is also described as being thermodynamically more favorable than non-catalytic dehydrogenation. Highly dispersed vanadium oxide species supported on silica are highlighted as an example of catalysts that achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity at relatively low temperatures.

2. 是的,文章解释了催化剂通过降低活化能垒降低丙烷脱氢的反应温度。文章指出,与非催化热解相比,催化非氧化脱氢提供了一种更有前景的丙烯生产途径,因为催化剂能够降低活化能垒(引用1-4)。氧化脱氢途径在催化剂作用下从热力学上也更有利。高度分散的硅胶载体上的钒氧化物被列为一例,该催化剂能在相对较低的反应温度下获得高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

[1] "Commercial catalysts applied in this process contain supported CrOx or Pt species as active components. For example, the CATOFIN and Snamprogetti processes utilize a chromiaalumina catalyst in fixed and fluidized bed reactors, respectively [1]."

[2] "Alumina-supported Pt catalysts are used in the Oleflex and STAR processes."  

[3] "Vanadium-based catalysts were also studied in DH of C3C4 alkanes in the absence of gas-phase O2 [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]."

[4] "Highly dispersed VOx species on silica with high surface area afforded high propane conversion and propene selectivity [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]."

3. Yes, the article introduces some major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation, including supported metal oxides like CrOx/Al2O3, supported metals like Pt/Al2O3, and vanadium oxides supported on silica. It cites the CATOFIN, Snamprogetti, Oleflex, and STAR processes as examples using CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts (quotes 1-2). Vanadium-based catalysts, especially VOx supported on silica, are also mentioned as being effective for alkane dehydrogenation (quotes 3-4).

4. No, the article does not discuss the thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation in detail. It only briefly mentions that commercial propane dehydrogenation needs to be carried out above 800 K due to thermodynamic constraints (quote 2 from question 2). No quantitative details of thermodynamics or kinetics are provided.
