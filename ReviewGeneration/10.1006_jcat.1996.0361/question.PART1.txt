I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

The Effect of Reaction Conditions and Time on Stream on the Coke Formed during Propane Dehydrogenation
Abstract
Pt/Al2O3and PtSn/Al2O3catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Time on stream, temperature, and reaction gas composition have been varied. Three different peaks were identified from the TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst and attributed to different types of coke; coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier. The amounts of these types were related to reaction conditions. The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene. Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation. The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure. A model is discussed where a minor part of the coke deactivates the catalyst. This coke is formed in parallel with the coke that is seen in the first two peaks in the TPO experiments. The graphitic coke formed on the carrier is not formed through this route. The experiments with different time on stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 h, while the second one still increased. Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis and cracking mechanisms during the propane dehydrogenation are also discussed.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
