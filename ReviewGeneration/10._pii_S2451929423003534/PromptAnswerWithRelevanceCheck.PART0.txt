<quotes>
[1] "The propylene yield clearly increased in a two-stage manner—it quickly reached the PDH equilibrium limit (38%) within a short contact time (high WHSV) and then slowly increased toward the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit (49%)."

[2] "The propylene yield in PDH gradually decreased at high WHSV (short contact time), whereas the propylene yield in CO2-ODHP remained stable (Figure 3D)." 

[3] "These results reveal that the RWGS reaction is the most likely rate-determining step in CO2-ODHP."

[4] "The RWGS reaction via either associative pathway (H + CO2 → HOCO) or dissociative pathway (CO2 → CO + O) on Pt8/SnO2(110) (Ea, associative = 1.12 eV, Ea, dissociative = 1.02 eV) and Pt6Sn2/SnO2(110) (Ea, associative = 1.40 eV, Ea, dissociative = 1.36 eV) needs to overcome higher barriers and is thus less competitive than the corresponding PDH process, implying that the rate for PDH + RWGS pathway is likely hindered by the RWGS reaction."

<English version answer>
4. The article discusses the thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. It states that the propylene yield increased in two stages during CO2-ODHP - it quickly reached the PDH equilibrium limit at short contact times and then slowly increased towards the higher CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit at longer contact times. This suggests dehydrogenation kinetics are fast initially while the slower RWGS reaction becomes rate-limiting subsequently. DFT calculations found RWGS barriers are higher than PDH barriers, confirming RWGS as the likely rate-determining step. 
</English version answer>

4. 该文献讨论了丙烷脱氢中涉及的热力学约束和动力学因素。它指出,在CO2-ODHP过程中,丙烯的产率以两阶段增加——在短接触时间下快速达到PDH平衡限制,然后在更长的接触时间下慢慢增加至更高的CO2-ODHP平衡限制。这表明,在最初脱氢反应动力学很快,而随后的较慢的RWGS反应成为速率控制步骤。 DFT计算发现RWGS的活化能垒比PDH的要高,这进一步确认了RWGS是可能的速率控制步骤。
