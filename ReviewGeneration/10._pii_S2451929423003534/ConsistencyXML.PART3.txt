To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the English answers from each file to the English correct answers. I looked for semantic equivalence between the key points and conclusions in the two answers for each question. Where they expressed the same essential information, I marked 100% consistency. Where information or conclusions differed, I marked 0% consistency. Intermediate cases could be scored with another percentage, but these answers were mostly binary.

I focused on accurately capturing consistency at a high level based on the meaning and conclusions stated. Minor wording differences were ignored if the essential content matched between the answer pairs. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
