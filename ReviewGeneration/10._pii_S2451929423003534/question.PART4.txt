The bigger picture
Our work demonstrated superior catalytic performance in CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) using SiO2-supported bimetallic Pt-M (M = Sn, In, Zn) catalysts prepared by simple impregnation methods. The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) equilibrium is shifted by the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, resulting in an improved per-pass propylene yield. The CO2-ODHP reaction on these bimetallic catalysts proceeds in a two-stage pathway wherein PDH dominates the earlier stage and the coupling between PDH and RWGS mostly occurs in the second stage. The overall reaction kinetics are limited by the RWGS reaction, which deserves more attention in future catalyst design. Our in situ spectroscopic studies and DFT calculations suggest that the formation of the PtmMn-MOx (e.g., Pt3Sn-SnOx) interfaces plays a vital role in the highly selective activation of propane and CO2. These insights may provide guidance on future catalyst design for CO2 and natural gas conversions.
Summary
The greenhouse gas CO2 is a promising soft oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. However, the occurrence of side reactions including cracking, hydrogenolysis, and reforming results in lower olefin yields compared with direct dehydrogenation. We report that Pt-M (M = Sn/In/Zn) bimetallic catalysts on non-redox-active silica support can break the equilibrium limit of direct propane dehydrogenation using CO2 as a co-reactant to consume the hydrogen formed in propane dehydrogenation. Unlike the commonly postulated direct CO2-assisted dehydrogenation mechanism, we confirm that CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) proceeds in two tandem steps on these bimetallic catalysts, i.e., propane dehydrogenation and reverse water-gas shift, with the latter being the rate-determining step. In situ X-ray absorption studies and density functional theory calculations suggest that the PtmMn-MOx (e.g., Pt3Sn-SnOx) interfaces are likely active sites.

Introduction
Propane, the third most abundant hydrocarbon component in shale gas, is an ideal feedstock for the on-purpose production of propylene, which is an important building block for the current chemical industry. Commercial technologies for propane-to-propylene conversion mainly adopt nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes, using Cr-based catalysts or bimetallic PtSn or PtGa catalysts.1,2,3 PDH is highly endothermic, and the per-pass propylene yield is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been studied for decades to overcome the thermodynamic limit on per-pass propylene yield by introducing an oxidant to consume the H2 product from the PDH process.4,5,6,7,8,9,10 However, O2-mediated ODHP results in inevitable overoxidation and waste of propane feedstock.
CO2 has long been considered a soft oxidant for ODHP to bypass the intrinsic issue of overoxidation and the risk of explosion associated with O2-mediated ODHP.6,7,11,12 In CO2-mediated ODHP, H2 is consumed by CO2 via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, resulting in a higher theoretical per-pass propylene yield than PDH under the same propane partial pressure and reaction temperature (Table S1; Figures S1 and S2). Moreover, CO2-ODHP converts CO2, a major greenhouse gas, into a valuable chemical, CO, which can be used in downstream chemical productions along with propylene, such as hydroformylation.13 It has been demonstrated that compared with the PDH process, CO2-ODHP has a greater potential in reducing the net CO2 emission associated with propylene production, despite the slightly increased operational cost originated from the higher endothermicity and more complex product separation in CO2-ODHP.14,15 The development of high-performance catalysts is key to achieving the environmental benefit of CO2-ODHP for propylene production. Most work on CO2-ODHP has been focused on oxide-based catalysts.6,11 Despite decades of research, the propylene yield in CO2-ODHP has not been reported to surpass the PDH equilibrium limit, largely due to the occurrence of side reactions.
Pt-based catalysts generally exhibit poor olefin selectivity in CO2-ODHP mainly because of the high activity of Pt in cracking, hydrogenolysis, and reforming reactions.12,16 These side reactions involve CC bond cleavage, which requires two or more Pt atoms in ensembles to cooperate. In contrast, PDH only requires CH bond cleavage, which is less dependent on the number of adjacent Pt atoms.3,17 Isolating Pt atoms by alloying with other metals, such as Sn, has been demonstrated to be effective in suppressing cracking/hydrogenolysis/coking in PDH.3,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26 However, it remains a challenging task to coactivate propane and CO2 on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces without compromising the high selectivity toward dehydrogenation. Recent work on CeO2-supported trimetallic (Pt1-xCox)2In3 and high-entropy intermetallics (PtCoNi) (SnInGa) demonstrated high performance in CO2-ODHP.27,28 However, the reported propylene yields are still below the PDH equilibrium limit. The redox-active nature of the CeO2 support was believed to play a crucial role in this reaction. Here, we show that several simple bimetallic Pt-M (M = Sn, In, or Zn) catalysts supported on non-redox-active support, silica, synthesized via conventional wet impregnation methods, can effectively catalyze CO2-ODHP. Undesired side reactions (cracking, hydrogenolysis, and reforming) are greatly inhibited, resulting in per-pass propylene yields well beyond the PDH equilibrium limit. The RWGS reaction is identified as the rate-determining step in CO2-ODHP. We further confirm that the PtmMn-MOx interfaces are crucial for the highly selective activation of propane and CO2.
Results and discussion
Electron microscopy and CO2-ODHP performance
Silica-supported Pt-M (M = Sn, In, or Zn) bimetallic catalysts were synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation. The Pt loading was identical (0.1 mmol of Pt per gram of silica, i.e., 2 wt % Pt) for all catalysts, and the M/Pt molar ratio was varied. Commercial Pt-based bimetallic PDH catalysts often employ alumina as a support.1,2,3 Silica was chosen as the catalyst support in this work because pure siliceous materials have been shown to be superior supports for Pt-based bimetallic PDH catalysts in terms of propylene selectivity.23,24,29,30,31,32,33 All catalysts were reduced under a flow of H2/N2 (v/v = 1/9) mixture at 600C prior to CO2-ODHP catalytic tests.
Figures 1 and S3S13 show high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images along with nanoparticle size distributions of the freshly reduced catalysts. These nanoparticles are mostly 2 nm in diameter and uniformly dispersed on the silica support. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of the PtSn1.5/SiO2 sample showed a homogeneous distribution of Pt and Sn throughout the SiO2 support (Figure S14). Large-area EDS quantification provided an overall Pt/Sn atomic ratio close to 1/1.5. Interestingly, a single-nanoparticle EDS histogram of over 50 nanoparticles showed a Pt-rich feature for most nanoparticles on PtSn1.5/SiO2, with the most probable Pt/Sn atomic ratio nearly 3/1 (Figures S15 and S16). This suggests that a large fraction of Sn species might be dispersed on the SiO2 support as SnOx.

Particle size distribution is shown below each image. All samples were reduced at 600C in H2/N2 (v/v = 1/9). Scale bars, 10 nm.
The temperature-dependent CO2-ODHP results of PtSnx/SiO2 (x = 1, 1.5, 2, or 3) catalysts are shown in Figures 2A2F and S17. The propane conversions were higher than the PDH equilibrium limit but slightly below the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit throughout the temperature range of 450C600C (Figure 2A). The propylene selectivity increased with the Sn/Pt ratio and surpassed 95% on PtSn3/SiO2 at 600C (Figure 2B). These high propane conversions and propylene selectivity resulted in record-high propylene yields in CO2-ODHP (Figure 2C). For instance, the propylene yields on PtSn/SiO2, PtSn1.5/SiO2, PtSn2/SiO2, and PtSn3/SiO2 at 550C were 40%, 43%, 44%, and 45%, respectively, which were greater than the PDH equilibrium limit (38%) and approaching the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit (49%). Similarly, the propylene yields on PtInx/SiO2 and PtZnx/SiO2 also broke the PDH equilibrium limit, particularly at higher M/Pt ratios (Figures S18S21). It is worth noting that the CO2 conversions and CO yields were also close to the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit (Figures 2D, 2E, S18, and S20). The observed H2/C3H6 ratios were much lower than 1, ranging from 0.4 to 0.7, indicating the H2 consumption by the RWGS reaction (Figure 2F). These results clearly demonstrated that the occurrence of RWGS reaction was able to shift the PDH reaction equilibrium, resulting in significantly improved propylene yields.

The propylene yields achieved on these bimetallic catalysts far exceed the values reported in the literature. As summarized in Figures 2G2I and Table S2, most literature studies on CO2-ODHP employed a propane partial pressure between 0.025 bar and 0.25 bar, with a CO2/propane ratio ranging from 1 to 5, and reaction temperature ranging from 500C to 600C.6,11 The propylene yields reported in the CO2-ODHP literature were mostly far below the PDH equilibrium limit, regardless of the types of catalysts and reaction conditions. The main challenge encountered was the occurrence of side reactions including cracking, hydrogenolysis, and reforming, even at low propane conversions. Compared with the Cr-, Ga-, In-, and V-based catalysts, Pt- and Pd-based catalysts exhibit much lower propylene selectivity because of the high activity of these metals in the side reactions.16,34 As shown in Figures S22 and S23, CO2-ODHP on Pt/SiO2 exhibited less than 60% selectivity toward propylene, with methane and ethane as the main side products. Sn1.5/SiO2 showed negligible activity in CO2-ODHP (Figure S24). In contrast, the silica-supported Pt-M (M = Sn, In, or Zn) bimetallic catalysts shown in this work exhibited much lower selectivity toward cracking/hydrogenolysis products such as methane, ethane, and ethylene (Figures S17, S19, and S21). Moreover, the observed ratios of (CO yield)/(CO2 conversion) were close to 1 (Figures S17, S19, and S21), implying that the contribution of reforming reactions was not significant. The RWGS performance on Pt/SiO2, Sn1.5/SiO2, and PtSn1.5/SiO2 samples (all samples were reduced at 600C in H2 before RWGS tests) was further investigated. As shown in Figure S25, Pt/SiO2 showed the highest CO2 conversion, whereas Sn1.5/SiO2 was barely active. The introduction of Sn to Pt resulted in a slightly decreased CO2 conversion but greatly improved selectivity toward CO (RWGS) as opposed to CH4 (methanation). The suppression of these side reactions (cracking, hydrogenolysis, reforming, and methanation) in CO2-ODHP at high propane conversions is key to increasing the propylene yield toward the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit, which is generally 10% above the PDH equilibrium limit (Figure S2).
Two-stage reaction mechanism
Kinetic studies were carried out to understand the CO2-ODHP reaction mechanism (Figures 3A and S26). Figure 3A shows the propylene and CO yields on the PtSn1.5/SiO2 catalyst at different weight hourly space velocities (WHSVs) at 550C. The propylene yield clearly increased in a two-stage mannerit quickly reached the PDH equilibrium limit (38%) within a short contact time (high WHSV) and then slowly increased toward the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit (49%). In contrast, the CO yield increased slowly yet steadily toward the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit (24%). The H2/C3H6 ratio kept decreasing toward the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit when contact time increased (Figure S26). We further measured the kinetics of PDH and RWGS reactions separately on the PtSn1.5/SiO2 catalyst at 550C (Figures 3B, 3C, S27, and S28). The propylene yield also quickly increased and approached the equilibrium limit in PDH. Afterward, it dropped slightly when the contact time further increased, which was mainly due to the occurrence of side reactions such as cracking/hydrogenolysis, as suggested by the increase in methane and C2 yields and consequently a decrease in propylene selectivity (Figure S27). The CO yield in the RWGS reaction increased slowly with contact time, which was identical to the trend observed in CO2-ODHP, except that the equilibrium CO yield was higher in RWGS alone (35%) than that in CO2-ODHP (24%). These results reveal that the RWGS reaction is the most likely rate-determining step in CO2-ODHP. The rather sluggish RWGS reaction kinetics is the main reason for the two-stage increase in propylene yield during CO2-ODHP. The first stage is dominated by dehydrogenation/hydrogenation reactions, which quickly reach PDH equilibrium. Then the reaction enters the second stage, where the coupling between PDH and RWGS takes place. RWGS continuously consumes the H2 from PDH and shifts the propylene yield toward the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit.

(F) C3H6 and CO yields as function of time-on-stream in CO2-ODHP at 550C (inlet pC3H8 = pCO2 = 0.5 bar; WHSV of 3 L/gcat·h).
It is also worth noting that the propylene yields in CO2-ODHP were slightly lower than those in PDH at short contact times but much greater than those in PDH at long contact times (Figure 3B). This behavior was further confirmed by alternating CO2-ODHP and PDH tests (Figures 3D and 3E). The slightly suppressed propylene yields at short contact times imply a kinetic inhibition effect, which is likely due to the site competition between PDH and RWGS, as evidenced by the observation of CO adsorption on Pt in infrared (IR) studies under the CO2-ODHP reaction conditions (Figure S29). The propylene yield in PDH gradually decreased at high WHSV (short contact time), whereas the propylene yield in CO2-ODHP remained stable (Figure 3D). This behavior suggests that CO2 might stabilize the catalyst by inhibiting carbon deposition via the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C  2CO). The enhanced propylene yields at long contact times originate from the thermodynamic promotion effect, i.e., RWGS consumes the H2 formed in PDH and drives the equilibrium toward higher propylene yields. The observation of kinetic inhibition and thermodynamic promotion effects clarifies the role of CO2 in CO2-ODHP, which has been controversial in the CO2-ODHP literature.6,7,11,12
The PtSn1.5/SiO2 catalyst exhibited high durability in long-term CO2-ODHP tests (Figures 3F, S30, and S31). The propylene yield slowly declined from 45% to 37% (close to PDH equilibrium) during 20 h of time-on-stream. In the meantime, the CO yield underwent a more pronounced decrease from 27% to 15%. It is worth noting that the propylene yield slightly increased in the initial stage of time-on-stream despite the slight decrease in propane conversion (Figures 3F and S30). The increased propylene yield was largely due to the increase in propylene selectivity from 91%92% to 98%99% (Figure S30). The CO2-ODHP performance of PtSn1.5/SiO2 was fully restored after a short period of calcination at 500C followed by reduction at 600C. No significant change in particle size distribution was observed upon regeneration (Figure S32). Separate PDH and RWGS stability tests on PtSn1.5/SiO2 showed negligible deactivation in PDH, whereas the RWGS activity dropped over time (34% to 25% in 20 h), implying that the loss of RWGS activity might be the main reason for deactivation in CO2-ODHP (Figures S33 and S34). This further confirms the kinetic significance of RWGS in CO2-ODHP.
Identification of active site structures
IR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies were carried out to gain more insights into the active site structures of these silica-supported Pt-M bimetallic catalysts. IR spectra of CO molecules adsorbed on PtSnx/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 samples are shown in Figure S35. Compared with the monometallic Pt/SiO2 reference, the linear CO bands of PtSnx/SiO2 shifted to lower wavenumbers with a gradual decrease in peak intensity as the Sn/Pt ratio increased. The redshift in CO vibrational frequency might partially originate from the diminishing of dipole-dipole coupling due to Pt site isolation in PtSnx alloys. On the other hand, the electron transfer from Sn to Pt would increase the electron density of Pt, which consequently donates more electrons to the π antibonding orbital of adsorbed CO molecule and decreases its vibrational frequency. The drop in CO band intensity can be attributed to the decrease in exposed Pt atoms in PtSnx alloy surfaces. Furthermore, the bridge CO band intensity sharply dropped upon introducing Sn and became negligible when the Sn/Pt ratio increased to 1.5, implying that the Pt ensembles were mostly broken upon alloying with Sn. Similar CO IR features were also observed on PtInx/SiO2 and PtZnx/SiO2 samples (Figure S36).
The valence states of Pt and Sn were characterized by XPS. Figure S37 shows that Pt was mostly in Pt0 state in Pt/SiO2 (71 eV) and PtSn1.5/SiO2 (70.8 eV). In contrast, Sn species had contributions from both Sn0 and Snδ+. This agrees with the EDS analysis, which showed Pt-rich (nearly Pt3Sn) nanoparticles and SnOx species on the SiO2 support (Figures S15 and S16). The incomplete reduction of SnOx in PtSnx/SiO2 might be the reason that a Sn/Pt atomic ratio of greater than 1.5 was required to fully convert Pt into alloyed surfaces, as evidenced by the complete disappearance of the bridge CO stretching mode (Figure S35).
The increasing degree of alloying and Pt isolation at higher M/Pt ratios is likely responsible for the improved propylene selectivity in CO2-ODHP, which is a key factor determining the propylene yield. Another determining factor is the propane conversion, which is ultimately driven by the CO2 conversion since RWGS is the rate-determining step in CO2-ODHP. The CO2 conversion and CO yield slightly increased when the Sn/Pt ratio increased from 1 to 1.5 and then remained constant at higher Sn/Pt ratios (Figures 2D and 2E), although fewer surface Pt sites became available as suggested by the reduction in CO IR intensity (Figure S35).
In situ XAS studies at the Sn K-edge and Pt L2,3-edges were performed to probe the structural evolution of Sn1.5/SiO2, Pt/SiO2, and PtSn1.5/SiO2 under different conditions. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra in Figures 4A and 4B show that Sn in PtSn1.5/SiO2 (valence between Sn0 and Sn2+) was more reduced than that in Sn1.5/SiO2 (valence between Sn2+ and Sn4+) after reduction in H2 at 600C, indicating a promoted reduction of Sn species due to the Pt-Sn interaction. Further exposure to the C3H8/CO2 mixture at 550C resulted in partial re-oxidation of the Sn species in Sn1.5/SiO2. In comparison, Sn in PtSn1.5/SiO2 remained nearly unchanged upon exposure to the C3H8/CO2 mixture or CO2 atmosphere at 550C.

The Pt L3-edge XANES spectra show that the Pt species in Pt/SiO2 (Figure 4C) and PtSn1.5/SiO2 (Figure 4D) were fully reduced after pretreatment in H2 at 600C. Compared with Pt foil and Pt/SiO2, the Pt L3-edge position of PtSn1.5/SiO2 shifted to higher energy, which is a typical feature of Pt-Sn alloy.35 After exposure to the C3H8/CO2 mixture or CO2 atmosphere at 550C, both the Pt L2- and L3-edge XANES spectra (Figures 4D4F) show that Pt was slightly oxidized, likely due to the electron back-donation from Pt to adsorbed CO molecules under reaction conditions (Figure S29).
The evolution of local coordination environment of Pt and Sn under different conditions was investigated using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), as shown in Figure 4G. The corresponding EXAFS fitting results are shown in Figures S38S41 and Tables S3S8. The average coordination number (CN) of the SnO bond over Sn1.5/SiO2 decreased from 6.1  0.2 to 3.6  0.1 after reduction at 600C and then slightly increased to 4.3  0.1 upon exposure to the C3H8/CO2 mixture at 550C, consistent with the XANES results. In contrast, the CNSn-O of PtSn1.5/SiO2 was significantly reduced to 1.4 and remained nearly unchanged upon exposure to the C3H8/CO2 mixture or CO2 atmosphere. The reduction of Sn and alloying with Pt in PtSn1.5/SiO2 were evidenced by the formation of Pt-Sn coordination, as revealed by the EXAFS fitting of both Sn K-edge (CNSn-Pt = 1.5  0.1, 2.64  0.01 Å, σ2 = 0.012) and Pt L3-edge (CNPt-Sn = 2.0  0.1, 2.63  0.01 Å, σ2 = 0.010). In addition to the PtSn bond, a PtPt bond was obtained at 2.73 Å over PtSn1.5/SiO2.
The XANES/EXAFS analysis revealed the presence of PtSnx bimetallic ensembles and SnOx species over PtSn1.5/SiO2 after reduction and under reaction conditions. The exact Pt-Sn alloy structure can be estimated based on a J factor,36,37 defined as the ratio between the experimentally measured CNPt-Sn/(CNPt-Sn + CNPt-Pt) and the theoretical values from the thermodynamically stable phases (e.g., Pt3Sn and PtSn). Thus, a J ratio closer to unity implies a greater structural resemblance of the sample to the referenced alloy. As summarized in Table S8, JPt3Sn and JPtSn were 1.11.2 and 0.5, respectively, thereby suggesting the dominance of the Pt3Sn alloy structure after reduction as well as under the reaction conditions, consistent with the most probable Pt/Sn ratios revealed by single-nanoparticle EDS analysis.
Origin of high selectivity toward CO2-ODHP
To gain a better understanding of active sites and the origin of improved selectivity toward CO2-ODHP by introducing Sn into Pt/SiO2, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted (Figures 5 and S42S64; Tables S9S12). Supported cluster models including Pt6Sn2/SnO2(110), Pt6Sn2/SiO2(100), and Pt8/SnO2(110) were adopted in the DFT calculations to capture the possible structural motifs involved in the PtSn1.5/SiO2 catalyst, which was found to be Pt3Sn clusters adjacent to SnOx dispersed on the SiO2 support according to the EDS and XAS studies. In addition, Pt8/SiO2(100) was also included as a model system to simulate Pt/SiO2, which can be compared with PtSn1.5/SiO2 to understand the promoting effect of Sn. Finally, Pt3Sn(111)- and Pt(111)-extended surfaces were also considered to explore the size effects. Detailed DFT model constructions and justifications were provided in the experimental procedures section and Figures S42S44.

According to the DFT-calculated potential energy diagram for PDH, the Pt(111) surface is not as active as that of Pt8 metal cluster supported on a SiO2(100) surface (Figures S45, S46, and S48). In terms of the highest activation energy (Ea) along the PDH pathway, it decreases from Pt(111) (Ea = 0.89 eV for CH3CH2CH3  CH3CH1CH3 + H) to Pt8/SiO2(100) (Ea = 0.32 eV for CH3CH1CH3  CH3CH1CH2 + H); thus, a higher PDH activity is expected on the Pt8 cluster model. Similar trend is observed when introducing Sn. Regardless of whether Sn is in metallic form as Pt3Sn(111), oxide form as Pt8/SnO2(110) or both as Pt6Sn2/SnO2(110), the formation of clusters always lowers the barriers (Figures 5A, S45, S47, S49, and S50), wherein the highest barrier for PDH decreases from Pt3Sn(111) (Ea = 0.94 eV for CH3CH2CH3  CH3CH1CH3 + H), Pt6Sn2/SnO2(110) (Ea = 0.75 eV for CH3CH1CH3  CH3CH1CH2 + H) to Pt8/SnO2(110) (Ea = 0.25 eV for CH3CH2CH3  CH3CH1CH3 + H). These results indicate that the low-coordinated Pt0 sites in Pt and PtSnx alloy clusters are necessary in achieving the highly efficient PDH reaction process, which displays higher-lying d states and therefore enables more stabilization of reaction intermediates/transition states than that of high-coordinated sites on extended surfaces (Figures 5B and S45). In addition, with the presence of metal clusters, the location of Sn can also affect PDH activity. Specifically, the bimetallic cluster with low-coordinated Sn0 located on the top of Pt6Sn2/SnO2(110) can lead to higher barrier or lower activity for PDH is expected.
Besides PDH, via CH bond scission, DFT calculations also consider the competitive cracking via CC bond scission. The adsorbed CH3CH2CH3 species prefers to undergo CH bond scission to form CH3CH1CH3 and H species rather than the CC bond scission to form CH3CH2 and CH3 species for all six model systems (Table S9). The low-coordinated metal sites in the Pt8 clusters enable the preferential CH bond scission with Ea less than 0.4 eV over the CC bond scission with Ea greater than 1.5 eV (Figure 5A). For the subsequent reaction of the CH3CH1CH3 intermediate, Pt8/SiO2(100) shows comparable barriers for CC bond (Ea = 0.51 eV) and CH bond scission (Ea = 0.32 eV). The difference is increased slightly by switching from SiO2 to SnO2 support, e.g., Pt8/SnO2(110) (Ea = 0.83 eV for CC bond scission; Ea = 0.17 eV for CH bond scission), and significantly by forming PtSnx alloy clusters, e.g., Pt6Sn2/SnO2(110) (Ea = 2.21 eV for CC bond scission; Ea = 0.75 eV for CH bond scission, Figure 5A). Given that, the Pt6Sn2/SnO2(110) interface is likely the active site, which gives rise to the improved selectivity toward the dehydrogenation product, propylene. The DFT results are consistent with the experimental results, demonstrating that the introduction of Sn suppresses the CC bond scission (a key step in cracking, hydrogenolysis, and reforming) and thus results in an increased dehydrogenation selectivity with the formation of PtSnx alloy clusters over SnO2. By comparison, the influence of Sn on dehydrogenation/cracking selectivity is rather small for the high-coordinated sites on Pt(111) or Pt3Sn(111)-extended surfaces (Figure S54).
In CO2-ODHP, CO2 adsorption is slightly more competitive than propane on both Pt8/SnO2(110) (Eads, CO2 = 0.78 eV vs. Eads, C3H8 = 0.52 eV) and Pt6Sn2/SnO2(110) (Eads, CO2 = 0.40 eV vs. Eads, C3H8 = 0.32 eV) (Figures S45 and S55; Table S12). However, the barriers for the dissociation of CO2 are much higher than the dissociation of CH3CH2CH3 on Pt8/SnO2(110) (Ea, CO2 = 1.02 eV vs. Ea, C3H8 = 0.25 eV) and Pt6Sn2/SnO2(110) (Ea, CO2 = 1.36 eV vs. Ea, C3H8 = 0.38 eV) (Tables S9 and S11). In addition, the activation energies for CH bond scission along the direct ODHP pathway (H-abstraction by oxygen species) are also higher than the ones in PDH pathway (Figures S55S59; Tables S9 and S10). Thus, for PtSnx/SiO2 catalysts, the direct ODHP cannot compete with PDH process, which is likely to remain as the dominant reaction upon the addition of CO2. Alternatively, H2 produced from the PDH process can drive the subsequent RWGS reaction (Figures S60S64; Table S11). This agrees with our experimental observation that the enhanced propylene yields in CO2-ODHP are mostly the result of the thermodynamic promotion effect rather than accelerated PDH kinetics. However, the RWGS reaction via either associative pathway (H + CO2  HOCO) or dissociative pathway (CO2  CO + O) on Pt8/SnO2(110) (Ea, associative = 1.12 eV, Ea, dissociative = 1.02 eV) and Pt6Sn2/SnO2(110) (Ea, associative = 1.40 eV, Ea, dissociative = 1.36 eV) needs to overcome higher barriers and is thus less competitive than the corresponding PDH process, implying that the rate for PDH + RWGS pathway is likely hindered by the RWGS reaction.
The promoting effect of Sn strongly depends on the formation of a unique Pt3Sn-SnOx interface created by alloying with Sn upon reduction, which enables the synergy among Sn0, Pt0, and SnO2 (Figure S43). Specifically, the Pt6Sn2-SnO2(110) interface enables the formation of the Pt3Sn cluster consisting of a unique site of low-coordinated Pt0, which is found to be responsible for the observed selective propane dehydrogenation to propylene (Figures 2 and 5). When using SiO2(100) as the support, instead, the low-coordinated Pt0-Pt0 bridge stays intact for Pt6Sn2/SiO2(100), which displays similarity in atomic/electronic structures and likely similar catalytic performances as that of Pt8/SiO2(100) and Pt8/SnO2(110) (Figures 5 and S42). The formation of such an active site depends on the strong Pt6Sn2-SnO2 interaction at the interface, which not only stabilizes the small nanoparticles and thus provides low-coordinated Pt sites but also enables the Sn-introduced ensemble effect to enable isolation of the Pt0 sites. By comparison, the contribution from the Sn-introduced ligand effect is rather small, which shifts the d states of low-coordinated Pt0 active site (Figure 5B) and thus tunes the catalytic performance of Pt3Sn alloy cluster with respect to the Pt metal cluster (Figures S45 and S55). The formation of active sites of low-coordinated Pt0 at the metal-oxide interface to promote the selective propane dehydrogenation to propylene may be expected to render a similar catalytic performance observed for PtInx/SiO2 and PtZnx/SiO2 during the CO2-ODHP reaction (Figure 2).
Overall, the DFT calculations for PDH and CO2-ODHP identified that the Pt3Sn-SnOx interface is likely the active site to achieve enhanced propylene selectivity and yield, as observed experimentally. Both DFT and experimental results favor the indirect CO2-ODHP pathway (PDH + RWGS) with RWGS being the rate-determining step.

Synthesis of mesoporous silica support
The mesoporous SiO2 support was synthesized via sol-gel process adapted from the literature.38,39 12.5 g of poly(ethylene oxide) (Mw = 105, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 125 g of 1 M HNO3 in a VWR KIMAX media/storage bottle (size, 500 mL) at room temperature. 81.25 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the solution, and sealed and stirred on a stir plate at room temperature for 30 min. The bottle was then transferred to an oven preheated to 40C and stood for 2.5 days. The resulting monolithic white gel was broken into small pieces (<5 mm) and immersed in 300 mL of DI H2O in order to soak out the acid remaining in the gel. The solvent was changed every 2 h. The fourth solvent was 0.045 M NH4OH/H2O. The bottle was sealed and kept in a 40C oven for 24 h. The gel particles were then rinsed with DI H2O and dried at 40C for 24 h, and then at 100C for 12 h. The dried gel particles were calcined in air with a temperature ramping rate of 1.5C/min up to 600C and kept at 600C for 12 h. The SiO2 support was crushed and sieved to obtain 3050 mesh particles for impregnation. The specific surface area of the obtained SiO2 is 1000 m2/g, with a total pore volume of 4 mL/g (including macropores, mesopores, and micropores).39
Sequential incipient wetness impregnation of PtSnx/SiO2
The SiO2 support was dried at 150C overnight prior to impregnation. In a typical synthesis (PtSn1.5/SiO2), 0.3 mmol of SnCl4·5H2O (98%, Strem Chemicals) was dissolved in 8 mL of DI H2O and then added to 2 g of SiO2 support (3050 mesh) at room temperature. The impregnated supports were dried at 40C for 48 h. The dried particles were then calcined in a programmable furnace with a temperature ramping rate of 2C/min up to 500C and kept at 500C for 4 h. The calcined SnOx/SiO2 was further impregnated with 8 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.2 mmol of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (99%, Strem Chemicals) and dried at 40C for 48 h. The amount of SnCl4·5H2O was varied for the synthesis of PtSnx/SiO2 with different Sn/Pt ratios. The dried particles were further reduced at 600C before catalytic reaction tests and characterizations.
Incipient wetness co-impregnation of PtInx/SiO2 and PtZnx/SiO2
The SiO2 support was dried at 150C overnight prior to impregnation. In a typical synthesis (PtIn1.5/SiO2), 0.3 mmol of In(NO3)3·5H2O (99.999% In, Strem Chemicals) and 0.2 mmol of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (99%, Strem Chemicals) were dissolved in DI H2O separately (4 mL H2O for each metal precursor), mixed, and then added to 2 g of SiO2 support (3050 mesh) at room temperature. The impregnated supports were dried at 40C for 48 h. The amount of In(NO3)3·5H2O was varied for the synthesis of PtInx/SiO2 with different In/Pt ratios. Zn(OOCCH3)2·2H2O (98%, Strem Chemicals) was used for the synthesis of PtZnx/SiO2. The dried particles were further reduced at 600C before catalytic reaction tests and characterizations.
Incipient wetness impregnation of Pt/SiO2
The SiO2 support was dried at 150C overnight prior to impregnation. 0.2 mmol of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (99%, Strem Chemicals) were dissolved in 8 mL of DI H2O and then added to 2 g of SiO2 support (3050 mesh) at room temperature. The impregnated supports were dried at 40C for 48 h. The dried particles were further reduced at 600C before catalytic reaction tests and characterizations.
Incipient wetness impregnation of Sn1.5/SiO2
The SiO2 support was dried at 150C overnight prior to impregnation. 0.3 mmol of SnCl4·5H2O (98%, Strem Chemicals) was dissolved in 8 mL of DI H2O and then added to 2 g of SiO2 support (3050 mesh) at room temperature. The impregnated supports were dried at 40C for 48 h. The dried particles were then calcined in a programmable furnace with a temperature ramping rate of 2C/min up to 500C and kept at 500C for 4 h. The calcined Sn1.5/SiO2 was further reduced at 600C before catalytic reaction tests and characterizations.
CO2-ODHP/PDH/RWGS reaction test
The CO2-ODHP reaction was conducted in an atmospheric pressure fixed bed flow reactor system with 3/8-in quartz reactor. Propane (research purity grade), CO2 (UHP), hydrogen (UHP), air (ultra-zero grade), and N2 (research purity grade) were provided by Airgas. The gas flow rates were controlled by mass flow controllers (MKS Instruments). The products were analyzed by an on-line Agilent 490 microGC equipped with MS-5A (H2, O2, N2, CH4, and CO), Plot U (CO2, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6), and Alumina (C3+ alkanes and C3+ olefins) columns. Each column is connected to a separate thermal conductivity detector. N2 was used as the internal standard for GC quantification.
In a typical CO2-ODHP reaction test, 0.2 g of dried catalyst was reduced in 10% H2/N2 (100 sccm) with a temperature ramping rate of 20C/min and kept at 600C for 30 min, cooled down to 450C in 10% H2/N2 (100 sccm), purged with N2 (100 sccm) at 450C for 10 min, and switched to C3H8:CO2 = 5 sccm:5 sccm; reaction temperature was increased from 450C to 600C with a ramp rate of 2C/min. A K-type thermocouple was inserted in the catalyst bed during the pretreatment and catalytic tests. A N2 flow (90 sccm) was combined with the reactor effluent before entering the GC sampling port.
For PDH tests, a N2 flow (same with C3H8 flow rate) was used instead of CO2 to combine with C3H8 before entering the reactor tube.
For RWGS tests, a H2 flow (same with CO2 flow rate) was used instead of C3H8 to combine with CO2 before entering the reactor tube.
For kinetic studies, the amount of catalyst and flow rates were varied to achieve different WHSV.
For time-on-stream studies, the catalysts were cooled down to 550C after reduction, purged with N2 (100 sccm) for 10 min, and switched to reaction gas mixture for 20 h.
The conversion, selectivity, yield, and carbon balance were calculated by the equations below (
represents the molar flow rate of given species):
Catalyst regeneration
For catalyst regeneration, the used catalysts were cooled down to 500C, purged with N2 (100 sccm) for 10 min before switching to 100 sccm of 1% O2/N2 for 10 min, then purged with N2 (100 sccm) for 10 min, and then switched to 10% H2/N2 (100 sccm). The temperature was ramped to 600C (20C/min) and kept for 30 min.
Characterizations
Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM imaging and EDS analysis were performed on a probe-corrected JEOL NEOARM operated at 80 kV. Dry powder specimens suspended on a Cu grid with a lacey carbon support were used for HAADF-STEM characterization. A JEOL JEM-2011 operating at 200 kV was used for low-resolution TEM imaging. At least 100 nanoparticles were measured for each sample to give a size distribution.
XPS was conducted on Kratos AXIS 165 XPS/AES. The binding energies were adjusted to the O 1s peaks at 532.2 eV.
Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Nicolet 6700 instrument with a Hg-Cd-Te (MCT) detector and a Praying Mantis high-temperature reaction chamber with KBr windows. 15 mg of catalyst was pretreated with 100 sccm of 10% H2/He at 600C for 30 min and cooled down to 50C in 10% H2/He. After a He purge at a flow rate of 100 sccm, CO adsorption/desorption was performed at 50C. 1% CO/Ar (UHP) was introduced into the DRIFTS cell at a flow rate of 100 sccm. After the CO saturation (15 min of adsorption), a He purge at a flow rate of 100 sccm was performed to remove gas phase CO from the DRIFTS cell (15 min of desorption). All the spectra were recorded using 64 scans and a resolution of 4/cm. For CO2-C3H8 cofeeding experiments, the reactor cell temperature was kept at 550C after reduction, purged with 100 sccm He for 10 min, switched to CO2:C3H8 = 10 sccm:10 sccm for 10 min, and switched to C3H8:He = 10 sccm:10 sccm for 30 min.
In situ XAS measurements
The in situ XAS spectra of Pt L2,3 and Sn K edges were measured at beamline 7-BM (QAS, 1012 ph/s at 10 keV) of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. For each in situ measurement, the as-prepared catalyst was compressed into a wafer (OD 1.3 cm) and loaded into a Nashner-Adler reaction cell40 sealed with Kapton windows, allowing for the simultaneous collection of the transmission and fluorescence signals. The sample was first purged with pure N2 (40 sccm) at room temperature, followed by heating (10C/min) in 10 vol % H2 in N2 (40 sccm) to 600C and dwelling for 60 min. Then the sample was cooled down to 550C in a pure N2 atmosphere (40 sccm) and subsequently exposed to the stream of C3H8 + CO2 (10 sccm:10 sccm, 60 min) and CO2/N2 (10 sccm:10 sccm, 40 min) at 550C. The XAS spectra were collected successively (2 scans/min) and the obtained scans under identical conditions were merged as an individual spectrum to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Pt and Sn foils were employed as the standard references to calibrate energy shifts and also to obtain the passive electron reduction factor (S02) used for the fitting. Metal-oxide references (PtO2, SnO, and SnO2) were measured as well and compared with the XANES and EXAFS of different catalysts. Data processing was performed using the IFEFFIT package.41
DFT calculations
Spin-polarized DFT42,43 calculations were performed based on Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).44 The projector augmented wave method (PAW)45,46 together with GGA exchange-correlation functional plus the PBE functional47 were employed with a 400 eV kinetic energy cutoff. Gaussian smearing with a width of 0.05 eV was used to improve the convergence. Gamma-centered k-meshes48 were adopted to sample the Brillouin zone for the surface calculations. The criteria for total energies and forces on all atoms were set as 106 eV and 0.03 eV Å1 for convergence, respectively. The climbing nudged elastic band method (CI-NEB)49 was conducted to derive the transition states. The adsorption energy of adsorbate on the surface was calculated as
where E is the total energy obtained from DFT calculations.
To well describe the experimentally synthesized Pt-Sn catalysts, six models were constructed: Pt(111), Pt3Sn(111), Pt8/SiO2(100), Pt6Sn2/SiO2(100), Pt8/SnO2(110), and Pt6Sn2/SnO2(110) (Figure S42). The bulk surfaces were adopted to capture the highly coordinated sites on the terrace of large PtSnx alloy particles, while the cluster (0.8 nm in size, Figure 5) models supported by either SiO2 or SnO2 described small particles (1 nm, Figure 1) or the low-coordinated edge or corner sites of large particles at the interfaces between PtSnx and supports. Both SiO2 and SnO2 were considered to account for the effect of supports. Wherein, the consideration of SnO2 was based on the XAS observations of the oxidized Sn species and thus the possible formation of Pt-SnOx or PtmSnn-SnOx interfaces under reaction conditions (Figure 4; Table S4).
Pt(111) and Pt3Sn(111) 4 × 4 surface slabs were constructed by cutting from their corresponding bulk cubic Pt with lattice parameter a = b = c = 3.97 Å and bulk cubic Pt3Sn with lattice parameter a = b = c = 4.06 Å, respectively. Pt8/SnO2(110) was constructed based on our previous study,50 where a 4-layer 2 × 2 SnO2(110) was cut from bulk tetragonal SnO2 with lattice parameters a = b = 4.78 Å and c = 3.22 Å, and a Pt8 cluster was deposited to form Pt8/SnO2(110). In addition, Pt6Sn2/SnO2(110) was also constructed by replacing two Pt atoms with Sn in the Pt8 cluster of the Pt8/SnO2(110) model (Figure S43), where no direct SnSn bond was ensured based on the features of the Pt3Sn(111) surface and the most stable configurations were selected. The amorphous silica was modeled by adopting β-cristobalite phase of SiO2, where the corresponding SiO2(100) and/or SiO2(111) surfaces were previously used to well describe the properties of amorphous silica.51,52 In this study, the SiO2(100) surface model was selected in consideration of its similarity with SnO2(110) on O-termination, which was identified to enable a stable Pt8 cluster on the SnO2(110) surface. Following the same strategy as seen for the SnO2(110)-supported clusters, Pt8/SiO2(100) and Pt6Sn2/SiO2(100) models were constructed and optimized (Figure S44).
During geometry relaxation, the bottom two layers of Pt(111) and Pt3Sn(111) were fixed, the bottom one O-Sn-O layer of Pt8/SnO2(110) and Pt6Sn2/SnO2(110) was fixed, the bottom two Si-O-Si-O layers of Pt8/SiO2(100) and Pt6Sn2/SiO2(100) models were fixed, and the remaining layers in each model were allowed to relax. Dipole corrections were added to compensate for the artificial charge polarization between the top and bottom surfaces caused by the unsymmetrical slab model. A 20 Å thick vacuum was added for all the surface models along the direction perpendicular to the surface.
