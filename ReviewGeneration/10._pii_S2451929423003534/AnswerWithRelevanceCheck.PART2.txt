      [2] "PtSn/SiO2, PtSn1.5/SiO2, PtSn2/SiO2, and PtSn3/SiO2 at 550C were 40%, 43%, 44%, and 45%, respectively, which were greater than the PDH equilibrium limit (38%) and approaching the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit (49%)."
      [3] "the propylene yields on PtInx/SiO2 and PtZnx/SiO2 also broke the PDH equilibrium limit, particularly at higher M/Pt ratios"

      [1] "The redshift in CO vibrational frequency might partially originate from the diminishing of dipole-dipole coupling due to Pt site isolation in PtSnx alloys. On the other hand, the electron transfer from Sn to Pt would increase the electron density of Pt, which consequently donates more electrons to the π antibonding orbital of adsorbed CO molecule and decreases its vibrational frequency."
      [2] "the Pt L3-edge position of PtSn1.5/SiO2 shifted to higher energy, which is a typical feature of Pt-Sn alloy." 
      [3] "the Pt6Sn2-SnO2(110) interface enables the formation of the Pt3Sn cluster consisting of a unique site of low-coordinated Pt0, which is found to be responsible for the observed selective propane dehydrogenation to propylene"

    <English>
      The article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Sn in the Pt-Sn bimetallic catalyst. It shows through IR spectroscopy that alloying Pt with Sn isolates Pt sites and transfers electrons from Sn to Pt, decreasing the CO vibration frequency on Pt. XAS data confirms the formation of Pt-Sn alloy. DFT calculations identify that the Pt3Sn-SnOx interface creates unique low-coordinated Pt sites that enable selective propane dehydrogenation to propylene.

      这篇文章研究了Pt-Sn双金属催化剂中次要金属Sn的电子和几何效应。 IR光谱表明,用Sn合金化Pt会隔离Pt位点,并将电子从Sn转移到Pt,降低Pt上的CO振动频率。 XAS数据确认了Pt-Sn合金的形成。 DFT计算确定Pt3Sn-SnOx界面创造了独特的低配位Pt位点,这些位点使选择性丙烷脱氢生成丙烯成为可能。

      [1] "Isolating Pt atoms by alloying with other metals, such as Sn, has been demonstrated to be effective in suppressing cracking/hydrogenolysis/coking in PDH." 
      [2] "the Pt-Sn alloy structure can be estimated based on a J factor, defined as the ratio between the experimentally measured CNPt-Sn/(CNPt-Sn + CNPt-Pt) and the theoretical values from the thermodynamically stable phases (e.g., Pt3Sn and PtSn). Thus, a J ratio closer to unity implies a greater structural resemblance of the sample to the referenced alloy."
      [3] "the formation of the PtmMn-MOx (e.g., Pt3Sn-SnOx) interfaces plays a vital role in the highly selective activation of propane and CO2."
    </Quotes>
    <English>
      The article describes synergistic effects between metals in the Pt-Sn bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It shows that alloying Pt with Sn isolates Pt sites and suppresses side reactions like cracking and coking. XAS data indicates formation of Pt3Sn alloy structure. DFT calculations identify Pt3Sn-SnOx interfaces as active sites that enable highly selective propane and CO2 activation. The synergistic ensemble and ligand effects of Sn modulate the selectivity of Pt.
