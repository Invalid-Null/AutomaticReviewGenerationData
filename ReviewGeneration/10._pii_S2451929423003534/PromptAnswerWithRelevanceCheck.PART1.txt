[1] "All catalysts were reduced under a flow of H2/N2 (v/v = 1/9) mixture at 600C prior to CO2-ODHP catalytic tests."

[2] "Figures 2 and S3S13 show high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images along with nanoparticle size distributions of the freshly reduced catalysts." 

[3] "The Pt loading was identical (0.1 mmol of Pt per gram of silica, i.e., 2 wt % Pt) for all catalysts, and the M/Pt molar ratio was varied."

[4] "Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of the PtSn1.5/SiO2 sample showed a homogeneous distribution of Pt and Sn throughout the SiO2 support (Figure S14)."

[1] "Commercial technologies for propane-to-propylene conversion mainly adopt nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes, using Cr-based catalysts or bimetallic PtSn or PtGa catalysts."

[2] "Pt-based catalysts generally exhibit poor olefin selectivity in CO2-ODHP mainly because of the high activity of Pt in cracking, hydrogenolysis, and reforming reactions."  

[3] "In contrast, the silica-supported Pt-M (M = Sn, In, or Zn) bimetallic catalysts shown in this work exhibited much lower selectivity toward cracking/hydrogenolysis products such as methane, ethane, and ethylene (Figures S17, S19, and S21)."

Answer: The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It notes that Pt-based catalysts generally exhibit poor olefin selectivity due to high activity in cracking, hydrogenolysis, and reforming reactions. However, the article shows that silica-supported Pt-M (M = Sn, In, Zn) bimetallic catalysts exhibit much lower selectivity toward cracking/hydrogenolysis products and improved performance for propane dehydrogenation.

答:该文评价了载体支持的单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它指出Pt基催化剂通常因高活性脱碳、脱氢和重整反应而导致低烯烃选择性。然而,该文显示硅胶载体支持的Pt-M(M=Sn、In、Zn)双金属催化剂对裂解/脱氢产物的选择性较低,丙烷脱氢性能更好。

[1] "In contrast, the silica-supported Pt-M (M = Sn, In, or Zn) bimetallic catalysts shown in this work exhibited much lower selectivity toward cracking/hydrogenolysis products such as methane, ethane, and ethylene (Figures S17, S19, and S21)."

[2] "The propylene yields achieved on these bimetallic catalysts far exceed the values reported in the literature." 

[3] "The suppression of these side reactions (cracking, hydrogenolysis, reforming, and methanation) in CO2-ODHP at high propane conversions is key to increasing the propylene yield toward the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit, which is generally 10% above the PDH equilibrium limit (Figure S2)."

[4] "The PtSn1.5/SiO2 catalyst exhibited high durability in long-term CO2-ODHP tests (Figures 3F, S30, and S31). The propylene yield slowly declined from 45% to 37% (close to PDH equilibrium) during 20 h of time-on-stream."

</quotes>

<English version answer> 
Answer: The article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported Pt bimetallic catalysts. It shows that introducing a second metal like Sn, In, or Zn suppresses side reactions like cracking and improves propylene selectivity and yield beyond what is achieved with Pt alone. The bimetallic catalysts show high stability for propane dehydrogenation. The metal-support interfaces are also found to be important active sites.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:该文研究了金属颗粒大小、形状和支持物相互作用等性质如何影响载体支撑的Pt双金属催化剂的性能。它显示引入Sn、In或Zn等第二金属可以抑制裂解等副反应,提高丙烯选择性和产率,超过单纯Pt的催化剂。这些双金属催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中显示出高稳定性。它还发现金属-载体界面是重要的活性位点。

[1] "In CO2-ODHP, CO2 adsorption is slightly more competitive than propane on both Pt8/SnO2(110) (Eads, CO2 = 0.78 eV vs. Eads, C3H8 = 0.52 eV) and Pt6Sn2/SnO2(110) (Eads, CO2 = 0.40 eV vs. Eads, C3H8 = 0.32 eV) (Figures S45 and S55; Table S12)." 

[2] "However, the barriers for the dissociation of CO2 are much higher than the dissociation of CH3CH2CH3 on Pt8/SnO2(110) (Ea, CO2 = 1.02 eV vs. Ea, C3H8 = 0.25 eV) and Pt6Sn2/SnO2(110) (Ea, CO2 = 1.36 eV vs. Ea, C3H8 = 0.38 eV) (Tables S9 and S11)."

[3] "Thus, for PtSnx/SiO2 catalysts, the direct ODHP cannot compete with PDH process, which is likely to remain as the dominant reaction upon the addition of CO2."

[4] "The rather sluggish RWGS reaction kinetics is the main reason for the two-stage increase in propylene yield during CO2-ODHP."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes a two-stage mechanistic pathway for propane dehydrogenation with CO2 over the Pt-M bimetallic catalysts. It suggests that propane dehydrogenation dominates initially, followed by coupling of dehydrogenation with the reverse water gas shift reaction. DFT calculations indicate that direct oxidative dehydrogenation by CO2 is kinetically limited compared to dehydrogenation, and the RWGS reaction is likely the rate-determining step. The metal-oxide interfaces are proposed as the active sites for dehydrogenation and RWGS.

答:该文提出了Pt-M双金属催化剂在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢的两阶段机理途径。它指出丙烷脱氢反应最初占主导地位,其后与逆水煤气转化反应偶联。DFT计算表明直接氧化脱氢受CO2控制的反应动力学受限,RWGS反应可能是速率控制步骤。该文提出金属-氧化物界面是脱氢和RWGS反应的活性位点。

[1] "CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane enabled by Pt-based bimetallic catalysts"

[2] "our work demonstrated superior catalytic performance in CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) using SiO2-supported bimetallic Pt-M (M = Sn, In, Zn) catalysts prepared by simple impregnation methods."

[3] "The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) equilibrium is shifted by the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, resulting in an improved per-pass propylene yield." 

[4] "The Pt loading was identical (0.1 mmol of Pt per gram of silica, i.e., 2 wt % Pt) for all catalysts, and the M/Pt molar ratio was varied."

[5] "the propylene yields on PtSn/SiO2, PtSn1.5/SiO2, PtSn2/SiO2, and PtSn3/SiO2 at 550C were 40%, 43%, 44%, and 45%, respectively, which were greater than the PDH equilibrium limit (38%) and approaching the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit (49%)."

[6] "the propylene yields achieved on these bimetallic catalysts far exceed the values reported in the literature."

[7] "the suppression of these side reactions (cracking, hydrogenolysis, reforming, and methanation) in CO2-ODHP at high propane conversions is key to increasing the propylene yield toward the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit"

[8] "the PtSn1.5/SiO2 catalyst exhibited high durability in long-term CO2-ODHP tests"

[9] "XPS characterization revealed that Pt was mostly in Pt0 state and Sn species had contributions from both Sn0 and Snδ+ in PtSn1.5/SiO2." 

[10] "In situ XAS studies and DFT calculations suggest that the formation of the PtmMn-MOx interfaces plays a vital role in the highly selective activation of propane and CO2."

[11] "the Pt3Sn-SnOx interface is likely the active site to achieve enhanced propylene selectivity and yield, as observed experimentally."
