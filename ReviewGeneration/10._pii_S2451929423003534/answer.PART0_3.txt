[1] "The propylene yield clearly increased in a two-stage manner—it quickly reached the PDH equilibrium limit (38%) within a short contact time (high WHSV) and then slowly increased toward the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit (49%)."

[2] "The propylene yield in PDH gradually decreased at high WHSV (short contact time), whereas the propylene yield in CO2-ODHP remained stable (Figure 3D)." 

[3] "These results reveal that the RWGS reaction is the most likely rate-determining step in CO2-ODHP."

[4] "The RWGS reaction via either associative pathway (H + CO2 → HOCO) or dissociative pathway (CO2 → CO + O) on Pt8/SnO2(110) (Ea, associative = 1.12 eV, Ea, dissociative = 1.02 eV) and Pt6Sn2/SnO2(110) (Ea, associative = 1.40 eV, Ea, dissociative = 1.36 eV) needs to overcome higher barriers and is thus less competitive than the corresponding PDH process, implying that the rate for PDH + RWGS pathway is likely hindered by the RWGS reaction."

4. The article discusses the thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. It states that the propylene yield increased in two stages during CO2-ODHP - it quickly reached the PDH equilibrium limit at short contact times and then slowly increased towards the higher CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit at longer contact times. This suggests dehydrogenation kinetics are fast initially while the slower RWGS reaction becomes rate-limiting subsequently. DFT calculations found RWGS barriers are higher than PDH barriers, confirming RWGS as the likely rate-determining step.

4. 该文献讨论了丙烷脱氢中涉及的热力学约束和动力学因素。它指出,在CO2-ODHP过程中,丙烯的产率以两阶段增加——在短接触时间下快速达到PDH平衡限制,然后在更长的接触时间下慢慢增加至更高的CO2-ODHP平衡限制。这表明,在最初脱氢反应动力学很快,而随后的较慢的RWGS反应成为速率控制步骤。 DFT计算发现RWGS的活化能垒比PDH的要高,这进一步确认了RWGS是可能的速率控制步骤。
