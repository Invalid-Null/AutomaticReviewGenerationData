[1] "CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane enabled by Pt-based bimetallic catalysts"

[2] "our work demonstrated superior catalytic performance in CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) using SiO2-supported bimetallic Pt-M (M = Sn, In, Zn) catalysts prepared by simple impregnation methods."

[3] "The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) equilibrium is shifted by the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, resulting in an improved per-pass propylene yield." 

[4] "The Pt loading was identical (0.1 mmol of Pt per gram of silica, i.e., 2 wt % Pt) for all catalysts, and the M/Pt molar ratio was varied."

[5] "the propylene yields on PtSn/SiO2, PtSn1.5/SiO2, PtSn2/SiO2, and PtSn3/SiO2 at 550C were 40%, 43%, 44%, and 45%, respectively, which were greater than the PDH equilibrium limit (38%) and approaching the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit (49%)."

[6] "the propylene yields achieved on these bimetallic catalysts far exceed the values reported in the literature."

[7] "the suppression of these side reactions (cracking, hydrogenolysis, reforming, and methanation) in CO2-ODHP at high propane conversions is key to increasing the propylene yield toward the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit"

[8] "the PtSn1.5/SiO2 catalyst exhibited high durability in long-term CO2-ODHP tests"

[9] "XPS characterization revealed that Pt was mostly in Pt0 state and Sn species had contributions from both Sn0 and Snδ+ in PtSn1.5/SiO2." 

[10] "In situ XAS studies and DFT calculations suggest that the formation of the PtmMn-MOx interfaces plays a vital role in the highly selective activation of propane and CO2."

[11] "the Pt3Sn-SnOx interface is likely the active site to achieve enhanced propylene selectivity and yield, as observed experimentally."

1. Yes, the article evaluates promising Pt-based bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Sn, Pt-In, Pt-Zn supported on silica for propane dehydrogenation via CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation. It provides specific examples of these catalysts along with data on their superior performance in terms of propylene yield compared to literature catalysts, breaking the equilibrium limit for conventional PDH.

2. No, the article does not substantially investigate how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance.

3. Yes, the article proposes a two-stage mechanistic pathway for propane dehydrogenation over the Pt-M/SiO2 catalysts, with propane dehydrogenation dominating the first stage and coupling of PDH with reverse water-gas shift determining the overall rate in the second stage. Specific reaction intermediates and transition states are described.

4. Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects, suggesting the Pt-M-MOx interfaces are active sites for selective activation of propane and CO2. No specific examples of activity/selectivity modulation are provided.

5. No, the article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts substantially. Only Pt/SiO2 is briefly tested for comparison.

6. Yes, the article investigates how Pt:M ratio affects particle size, ensemble effects, ligand effects, and metal-oxide interfaces, relating these structural factors to improved selectivity in CO2-ODHP. Specific examples are provided for Pt-Sn, Pt-In, Pt-Zn catalysts.

7. Yes, the article proposes a two-stage mechanistic pathway involving propane dehydrogenation in the first stage and coupling with reverse water-gas shift in the second stage as the rate limiting step. The unique Pt-M-MOx interfaces are proposed as active sites.
