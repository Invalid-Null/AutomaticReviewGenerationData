[1] "commercial Pt-based bimetallic PDH catalysts often employ alumina as a support."
[2] "PtSn/SiO2, PtSn1.5/SiO2, PtSn2/SiO2, and PtSn3/SiO2 at 550C were 40%, 43%, 44%, and 45%, respectively, which were greater than the PDH equilibrium limit (38%) and approaching the CO2-ODHP equilibrium limit (49%)."
[3] "the propylene yields on PtInx/SiO2 and PtZnx/SiO2 also broke the PDH equilibrium limit, particularly at higher M/Pt ratios"

2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn, Pt-In, and Pt-Zn for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing that Pt-Sn, Pt-In, and Pt-Zn catalysts supported on silica achieve propylene yields beyond the equilibrium limit of direct propane dehydrogenation, approaching the higher equilibrium limit enabled by CO2-ODHP. At 550C, Pt-Sn catalysts with Sn/Pt ratios of 1.5-3 achieved 40-45% propylene yield, exceeding the 38% PDH equilibrium limit. Similarly high propylene yields were achieved with Pt-In and Pt-Zn catalysts at higher In/Pt and Zn/Pt ratios.

2. 答案:是的,这篇文章评估了Pt合金催化剂,如Pt-Sn、Pt-In和Pt-Zn用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显示, Supported在二氧化硅上的Pt-Sn、Pt-In和Pt-Zn催化剂实现了超过直接丙烷脱氢平衡限制的丙烯收率,接近CO2-ODHP所允许的更高平衡限制。在550°C下,Sn/Pt比为1.5-3的Pt-Sn催化剂实现了40-45%的丙烯收率,超过了38%的PDH平衡限制。同样高的丙烯收率也在更高的In/Pt和Zn/Pt比率下用Pt-In和Pt-Zn催化剂实现。

[1] "The redshift in CO vibrational frequency might partially originate from the diminishing of dipole-dipole coupling due to Pt site isolation in PtSnx alloys. On the other hand, the electron transfer from Sn to Pt would increase the electron density of Pt, which consequently donates more electrons to the π antibonding orbital of adsorbed CO molecule and decreases its vibrational frequency."  
[2] "the Pt L3-edge position of PtSn1.5/SiO2 shifted to higher energy, which is a typical feature of Pt-Sn alloy."
[3] "the Pt6Sn2-SnO2(110) interface enables the formation of the Pt3Sn cluster consisting of a unique site of low-coordinated Pt0, which is found to be responsible for the observed selective propane dehydrogenation to propylene"

3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Sn in the Pt-Sn bimetallic catalyst. It shows through IR spectroscopy that alloying Pt with Sn isolates Pt sites and transfers electrons from Sn to Pt, decreasing the CO vibration frequency on Pt. XAS data confirms the formation of Pt-Sn alloy. DFT calculations identify that the Pt3Sn-SnOx interface creates unique low-coordinated Pt sites that enable selective propane dehydrogenation to propylene.

[1] "Isolating Pt atoms by alloying with other metals, such as Sn, has been demonstrated to be effective in suppressing cracking/hydrogenolysis/coking in PDH."
[2] "the Pt-Sn alloy structure can be estimated based on a J factor, defined as the ratio between the experimentally measured CNPt-Sn/(CNPt-Sn + CNPt-Pt) and the theoretical values from the thermodynamically stable phases (e.g., Pt3Sn and PtSn). Thus, a J ratio closer to unity implies a greater structural resemblance of the sample to the referenced alloy."
[3] "the formation of the PtmMn-MOx (e.g., Pt3Sn-SnOx) interfaces plays a vital role in the highly selective activation of propane and CO2."

<English version answer>
5. Answer: Yes, the article describes synergistic effects between metals in the Pt-Sn bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It shows that alloying Pt with Sn isolates Pt sites and suppresses side reactions like cracking and coking. XAS data indicates formation of Pt3Sn alloy structure. DFT calculations identify Pt3Sn-SnOx interfaces as active sites that enable highly selective propane and CO2 activation. The synergistic ensemble and ligand effects of Sn modulate the selectivity of Pt.
