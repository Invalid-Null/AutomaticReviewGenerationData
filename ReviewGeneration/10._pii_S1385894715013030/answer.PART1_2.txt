<quotes>

[1] "Platinum (Pt) is known to be the most effective transition metal for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes [5]."

[2] "The bimetallic PtSn supported catalysts have been widely studied in the open literatures." 

[3] "In contrast, PtIndium (In) catalysts may be more suitable for dehydrogenation due to its less dependence on the preparation procedure [27]."

[4] "The objective of this work is to study the influences of different Mg/Al molar ratio on the catalytic performances of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."

[5] "The Pt dispersions and TOF values of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts are also summarized in Table 5. It can be seen that PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1 catalyst exhibits the lowest Pt dispersion of 16.8%."

5. Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It states that Pt is known to be the most effective transition metal for alkane dehydrogenation, and that PtIn catalysts may be more suitable than PtSn due to less dependence on preparation method. The article studies PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts with varying Mg/Al ratios. Data on Pt dispersion and turnover frequencies for different Mg/Al ratios are provided in Table 5, showing the lowest Pt dispersion for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1.

5. 是的,该文献评价了负载的单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它指出Pt被认为是烷烃脱氢最有效的过渡金属,而且PtIn催化剂由于对制备方法的依赖性更小,可能比PtSn更合适。该文献研究了具有不同Mg/Al比的PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x催化剂。表5提供了不同Mg/Al比的Pt分散度和周转数的数据,显示PtIn/Mg(Al)O-1的Pt分散度最低。

[1] "The variations of total specific surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter with Mg/Al molar ratio may be ascribed to the difference of the pore structure."

[2] "Appropriate Mg content can facilitate the reduction of Pt species, stabilize the oxidation state of In and inhibit the coke formation, which are favorable to propane dehydrogenation reaction." 

[3] "With the suitable Mg/Al molar ratio (4:1), the harmonious acidbase properties, a better distribution of well-dispersed Pt particles with the smallest average size (2.5 nm) can be achieved."

6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts. It shows how Mg/Al ratio affects pore structure, Pt reduction, In oxidation state, coke formation, acid-base properties, and Pt particle size distribution and dispersion. A Mg/Al ratio of 4:1 gave the smallest Pt particle size of 2.5 nm and highest dispersion.
