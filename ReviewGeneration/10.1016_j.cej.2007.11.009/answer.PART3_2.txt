[1] "The supported Pt-Sn catalysts were prepared utilizing a co-incipient wetness method."

[2] "After the co-incipient wetness process was applied, catalysts were air-dried at room temperature for 24 h"
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It utilizes a co-incipient wetness impregnation method to prepare the Pt-Sn catalysts on boron nitride and alumina supports. The catalysts are then dried at room temperature.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它利用共浸渍方法在硼氮化物和氧化铝载体上制备Pt-Sn催化剂。然后催化剂在室温下干燥。

Answer: No, the article does not utilize any in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses ex-situ techniques like XRD, TEM, XPS to characterize the catalysts.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 
答:不,该文没有利用任何原位表征技术来研究丙烷脱氢催化剂。它使用体外技术比如XRD、TEM、XPS来表征催化剂。

[1] "A transmission electron microscope (TEM, Hitachi H-7100) was employed to observe the shape of BN and the appearance of PtSn particles dispersed on the support."

[2] "Fig. 2(a and b) show the TEM micrographs of Pt/BN and Pt-Sn(0.75)/BN." 
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article employs TEM to characterize the metal-support interfaces and observe the dispersion of PtSn particles on the BN support. Fig. 2 shows example TEM images.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文采用TEM表征金属-支持体界面,并观察PtSn颗粒在BN支持体上的分散态。图2显示了TEM图像的例子。

[1] "The binding energy of Sn 3d5/2 on Sn/BN is at 486.4 eV indicating sole Sn cannot be H2 reduced at 400 C, thus remains in Sn2+ state." 

[2] "Compared with reduced Pt/BN, the binding energy of Pt in the H2 reduced Pt-Sn(0.75)/BN shows a 0.5 eV positive shift to 71.7 revealing surface Pt may be positively charged due to the partially surrounding Sn2+ on PtSn alloy"
</quotes>

<English version answer> 
Answer: Yes, the article uses XPS to probe the oxidation state changes of Sn and Pt during H2 reduction at 400 C. The data reveals that after reduction, Sn remains partially oxidized while Pt becomes positively charged due to the partial surrounding of Sn2+. This indicates formation of PtSn alloy.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文使用XPS来探测400°C H2还原过程中Sn和Pt的氧化态变化。数据显示在还原后,Sn保持了部分氧化,而Pt因部分包围的Sn2+而变得正电荷。这表明形成了PtSn合金。
