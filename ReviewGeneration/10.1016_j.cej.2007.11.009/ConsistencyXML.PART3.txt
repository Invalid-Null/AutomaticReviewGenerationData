To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key points in the answer from each file to the correct answer provided. I looked at whether the main aspects were covered or not. Some answers were fully consistent, while others only covered certain key points, so I tried to estimate a reasonable percentage. Please let me know if you would like me to explain or improve my analysis approach further.
