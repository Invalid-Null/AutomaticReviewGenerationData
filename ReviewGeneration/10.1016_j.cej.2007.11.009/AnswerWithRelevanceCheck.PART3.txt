         [1] "A novel boron nitride (BN) supported Pt-Sn catalyst was prepared by co-incipient wetness impregnation with various Sn loadings."

         [2] "Calculated amounts of Pt and Sn precursor salts were dissolved in methanol to obtain the desired metal loadings."

         [3] "The supported Pt-Sn catalysts were prepared utilizing a co-incipient wetness method."

         [4] "After the co-incipient wetness process was applied, catalysts were air-dried at room temperature for 24 h"

         [5] Precursor salt, H2PtCl6·6H2O, with approximately 40 wt.% platinum, and pure SnCl2 were purchased from Alfa Aesar (USA). Methanol was chosen as the diluting solvent for improved soaking of the hydrophobic BN support.

         Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It utilizes a co-incipient wetness impregnation method to prepare the Pt-Sn catalysts on BN and Al2O3 supports using methanol as a solvent. The article discusses how the inert BN surface promotes metal particle migration during reduction, affecting dispersion. It also describes drying the catalysts at room temperature after impregnation.

         Answer: No, the article does not utilize any in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It employs ex-situ techniques like XRD, TEM, XPS to characterize the fresh and spent catalysts.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         答:不,本文没有采用任何原位表征技术来研究工作中的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它采用了XRD、TEM、XPS等原位技术表征新鲜和使用后的催化剂。

         [1] "A transmission electron microscope (TEM, Hitachi H-7100) was employed to observe the shape of BN and the appearance of PtSn particles dispersed on the support."

         [2] "Fig. 2(a and b) show the TEM micrographs of Pt/BN and Pt-Sn(0.75)/BN."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article employs TEM microscopy technique to characterize metal-support interfaces in the Pt-Sn propane dehydrogenation catalysts supported on BN. The images show metal nanoparticles located on the edges of the BN support particles.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         答:是的,本文采用TEM显微技术表征BN载体Pt-Sn丙烷脱氢催化剂的金属-载体界面。图像显示金属纳米粒子位于BN载体颗粒的边缘。

         [1] "The binding energy of Sn 3d5/2 on Sn/BN is at 486.4 eV indicating sole Sn cannot be H2 reduced at 400 C, thus remains in Sn2+ state."

         [2] "Compared with reduced Pt/BN, the binding energy of Pt in the H2 reduced Pt-Sn(0.75)/BN shows a 0.5 eV positive shift to 71.7 revealing surface Pt may be positively charged due to the partially surrounding Sn2+ on PtSn alloy" 
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article uses XPS to probe the oxidation state changes of Sn and Pt during H2 reduction at 400 C. The data reveals that after reduction, Sn remains partially oxidized while Pt becomes positively charged due to the partial surrounding of Sn2+. This indicates formation of PtSn alloy.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         答:是的,本文使用XPS来探测400°C H2还原过程中Sn和Pt的氧化态变化。数据显示在还原后,Sn保持了部分氧化,而Pt因部分包围的Sn2+而变得正电荷。这表明形成了PtSn合金。
