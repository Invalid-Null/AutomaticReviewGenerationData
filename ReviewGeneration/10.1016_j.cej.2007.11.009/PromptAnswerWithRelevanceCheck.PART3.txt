[1] "A novel boron nitride (BN) supported Pt-Sn catalyst was used for the oxydehydrogenation of propane. BN is a graphite-like inert support which provides negligible interaction with metals."
[2] "Calculated amounts of Pt and Sn precursor salts were dissolved in methanol to obtain the desired metal loadings."
[3] "Low Pt dispersion on BN is because the easy migration of Pt creates large particles on the BN surface during H2 reduction."

[1] "The binding energy of Sn 3d5/2 on Sn/BN is at 486.4 eV indicating sole Sn cannot be H2 reduced at 400 C, thus remains in Sn2+ state." 

[2] "Compared with reduced Pt/BN, the binding energy of Pt in the H2 reduced Pt-Sn(0.75)/BN shows a 0.5 eV positive shift to 71.7 revealing surface Pt may be positively charged due to the partially surrounding Sn2+ on PtSn alloy"
</quotes>

<English version answer> 
Answer: Yes, the article uses XPS to probe the oxidation state changes of Sn and Pt during H2 reduction at 400 C. The data reveals that after reduction, Sn remains partially oxidized while Pt becomes positively charged due to the partial surrounding of Sn2+. This indicates formation of PtSn alloy.
