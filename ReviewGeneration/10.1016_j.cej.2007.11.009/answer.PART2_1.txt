<quotes>
[1] A series of Pt-Sn/BN catalysts were prepared by co-incipient wetness impregnation with various Sn loadings. 
[2] The Sn addition clearly improved the activity and propylene selectivity of Pt-Sn/BN at 600 C. The more the Sn loading, the higher the selectivity and yield of propylene were.
[3] Compared with the monometallic Pt/BN catalyst (Fig. 5), both conversion and propylene selectivity are significantly improved concurrently.
