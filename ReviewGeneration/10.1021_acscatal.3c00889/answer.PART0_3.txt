1. Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an economically competitive and environmentally friendly industrial scheme used to produce propylene. (1)  
2. Ensuring the stability of TM1-N3/C catalysts is critical in the PDH reaction, as the isolated TM atoms could escape from the anchoring site and then agglomerate into clusters at a high working temperature of 900 K. (Figure 1a)

1. Answer: Yes, the article provides background that propane dehydrogenation is an important industrial process for producing propylene, which is a valuable chemical feedstock. It states that PDH is economically competitive and environmentally friendly compared to other routes.

2. Answer: Yes, the article explains that catalysts facilitate PDH by lowering the activation energy barriers for the dehydrogenation reactions. It describes how the single atom catalysts (TM1-N3/C) are designed to be active for CH bond activation. 

3. Answer: No, the article does not introduce major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation beyond the TM1-N3/C catalysts studied.

4. Answer: No, the article does not provide quantitative details on the thermodynamics and kinetics involved in propane dehydrogenation. 

5. Answer: No, the article does not describe the use of DFT calculations to study PDH mechanisms and pathways.

6. Answer: No, the article does not present microkinetic modeling efforts or rate equations for propane dehydrogenation.

7. Answer: Yes, the article describes computational work identifying a volcano-type relationship between catalyst adsorption energy of propylene and intrinsic activity, revealing this descriptor as a structure-activity relationship.
