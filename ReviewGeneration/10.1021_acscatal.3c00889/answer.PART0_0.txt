[1] Catalysts have emerged as a promising solution to coke deposition problems with the unique geometrical feature.

[2] Traditional supported Pt or Cr oxide has been used for PDH, but the multiatom sites on the catalyst surface could render the formed propylene strongly adsorbed in the diσ-bond mode.

[3] It is even worse that Cr oxide can damage the ecological system once leaked.

[1] The analysis was carried out at a temperature of 900 K and partial pressures of pC3H8 = 0.3 bar and pC3H6 = pH2 = 0 bar, referred to as the zero conversion limit, which assesses the intrinsic activity of the catalyst by excluding the influence of the mass transfer on catalyst performance.

[2] The microkinetic simulations were performed using the CATKINAS package.

[3] Applying these scaling relationships on the six TM1-N3/C (TM = Sc, Ti, Y, Zr, La, Hf) catalysts, we performed the microkinetic simulation and obtained a volcano-type activity trend with respect to Ead(C3H6) (Figure 3d).
