[1] "The spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with a plane-wave basis set and the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials (25) implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). (26,27)"

[2] "The structures of the transition states were searched using the constrained optimization method (2931) and the climbed image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method. (32)" 

[3] "Moreover, we also considered the influence of the magnetic moment of the 3d metal atoms on the energies of TM1-N3/C, and only those with the lowest energies were adopted. (37)"

[4] "The microkinetic simulations were performed using the CATKINAS package. (3436)"
