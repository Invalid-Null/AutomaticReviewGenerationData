         [1] Due to endothermicity, PDH is generally operated at a high temperature of about 600 C.
         [2] The abstraction of α-H (C3H7*···H*, Figure 2a) having a slightly lower barrier of 0.71 eV, consistent with the previous works. 
         [3] The adsorption energies of propylene (Ead(C3H6)) present a strong correlation with E(C3H7*···H*), E(C3H7* + H*), and E(H* + C3H6*···H*), respectively.
