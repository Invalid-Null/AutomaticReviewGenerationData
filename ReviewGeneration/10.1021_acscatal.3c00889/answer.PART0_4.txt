[1] "Due to endothermicity, PDH is generally operated at a high temperature of about 600 C to make the process thermodynamically favorable in the free energy landscape and overcome the kinetic barrier."

[2] "The traditional supported Pt (6,7) or Cr oxide (8) has been used for PDH, but the multiatom sites on the catalyst surface could render the formed propylene strongly adsorbed in the diσ-bond mode." 

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is endothermic and typically operated at around 600°C to be thermodynamically favorable and overcome kinetic barriers. It also mentions that traditional Pt or Cr oxide catalysts have been used, but they can lead to strong propylene adsorption that causes coking issues.
