<quotes>
[1] "It is known that ZnO is a weak base and ZrO2 is a weak acid. Considering acidbase properties and their influence on the product selectivity, a series of binary ZnZrxOy catalysts (denoted as ZnZr catalysts) were prepared and investigated for PDH at relatively low temperatures (400500 C)."

[2] "This implies that over the single Zncus site, the second step is rate-determining. The Ea on the single Zncus sites for both steps is much lower than that on the single Zrcus sites, indicative of that C3H8 dehydrogenation is more efficient over the Zncus sites."  

[3] "Therefore, through consideration of the experimental and theoretical results, it concludes that Zncus sites and Zrcus sites in ZncusOZrcus have a synergy effect on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 that the first dehydrogenation step occurs on Zncus sites and that the second step occurs on Zrcus sites in ZncusOZrcus, decreasing Ea further compared with the single Zncus and Zrcus."

5. Yes, the article describes synergistic effects between Zn and Zr metals in the binary ZnZrxOy oxide catalysts, attributed to ensemble and ligand effects. Specifically, it found that Zncus and Zrcus sites in ZncusOZrcus have a synergistic effect on propane dehydrogenation, with Zncus active for the first dehydrogenation step and Zrcus active for the second step. This synergistic effect lowered the overall activation energy compared to single metal catalysts.

5. 是的,文章描述了Zn和Zr金属在二元ZnZrxOy氧化物催化剂中的协同效应,这归因于集合体和配体效应。具体而言,它发现Zncus和Zrcus位点在ZncusOZrcus具有促进丙烷脱氢的协同效应,其中Zncus对第一步脱氢活跃,Zrcus对第二步脱氢活跃。这种协同效应降低了总体激活能量,与单金属催化剂相比。
