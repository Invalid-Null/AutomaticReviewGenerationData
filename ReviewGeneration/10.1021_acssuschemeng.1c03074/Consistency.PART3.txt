 Here is the JSON structure comparing the consistency of the answer files to the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I carefully compared the content of each answer file to the correct answers for each question. Since all the answer files indicate the article does not contain information relevant to any of the questions, they are 100% consistent with the correct answers. The JSON structure summarizes this full consistency across all questions and answer files. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
