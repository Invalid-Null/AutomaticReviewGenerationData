<quotes>

[1] "the incorporation of Zn led to the formation of Zrcus and improved oxygen mobility"

[2] "ZnZr2 possessed the highest amount of H2 consumed among the ZnZr catalysts, which was ascribed to more ZnO-Zr species."

[3] "ZnZr2 catalyst can be employed without reduction while maintaining a high catalytic performance"

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows incorporation of Zn into ZrO2 leads to formation of Zrcus sites and improves oxygen mobility based on XRD, XPS, H2-TPR data. The ZnZr2 catalyst with balanced oxidation states and oxygen mobility shows highest activity without needing pre-reduction.

2. 是的,文章研究了调节氧化态、氧迁移性以及酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。基于XRD、XPS、H2-TPR数据,结果显示Zn掺杂到ZrO2中导致Zrcus位点的形成并提高了氧迁移性。氧化态和氧迁移性均衡的ZnZr2催化剂无需预处理就显示出最高活性。

<quotes>

[1] "Zncus and Zrcus present in Zncus−O−Zrcus were the active sites for the first and second steps of C3H8 dehydrogenation, respectively." 

[2] "the synergistic effect, derived from both these components, led to significant enhancements in activity"

[3] "C3H8 first adsorbs on the surface of catalysts and then dehydrogenates one H on Zncus in Zncus−O−Zrcus forming C3H7*; the C3H7* further dehydrogenates H on neighboring Zrcus in Zncus−O−Zrcus to generate surface-adsorbed C3H6."

<English version answer>

3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario where Zncus and Zrcus sites in Zncus-O-Zrcus are the active sites for the first and second dehydrogenation steps of propane, respectively. Propane adsorbs and loses the first H on Zncus, then the intermediate loses the second H on neighboring Zrcus site, showing a synergistic effect between Zn and Zr species.

<Chinese version answer>

3. 是的,文章提出了一种机理,即Zncus和Zrcus位点在Zncus-O-Zrcus中分别是丙烷第一步和第二步脱氢的活性位点。丙烷吸附后在Zncus位点失去第一个氢原子,然后中间产物在相邻的Zrcus位点失去第二个氢原子,显示出Zn和Zr物种之间的协同效应。
