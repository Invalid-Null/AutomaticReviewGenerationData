[1] Binary ZnZrxOy catalysts were prepared and employed to catalyze propane dehydrogenation at relatively low temperatures.

[2] Zr-based catalysts, which are cheap and environmentally friendly, exhibit relatively good catalytic performance for PDH. 

[3] It has been suggested that the utilization of pre-reductive methods or doping with lower valence metals can lead to improved activity of Zr-based catalysts.

[1] most examples require a high reaction temperature (ca. 570 C) to reach a favorable substrate conversion.

[2] The high Ea observed for catalysts that are not exposed to a pre-reductive treatment gives evidence that additional energy is required for the formation of Zncus and Zrcus in situ.
