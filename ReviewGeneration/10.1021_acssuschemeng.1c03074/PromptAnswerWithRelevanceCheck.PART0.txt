 Here are the relevant quotes and answers:

<quotes>
Propene (C3H6) is one of the most important petrochemicals and is commonly used to produce polymers and rubber. (1) The continuously increasing demand for C3H6 has led to the development of alternative, nonoxidative approaches for propane (C3H8) dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction, compared to traditional methods such as the cracking of naphtha. (2) 
Binary ZnZrxOy catalysts were prepared and employed to catalyze propane dehydrogenation at relatively low temperatures. The evaluation of these materials for propane dehydrogenation was supplemented by material characterization and density functional theory calculations, to provide molecular insights into the nature of the catalytic active sites. Combined, these experiments suggested that coordinatively unsaturated Zn cations (Zncus) in ZncusOZrcus were the active sites for the first step of propane dehydrogenation, and coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) in ZncusOZrcus were active sites for the second step.

<English version answer>

1. Yes, the article provides background on the importance of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation in the chemical industry. It states that propylene is one of the most important petrochemicals and is commonly used to produce polymers and rubber, and that demand for propylene is continuously increasing. This has led to the development of alternative, non-oxidative approaches for propane dehydrogenation.

2. Yes, the article explains how catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing coordinatively unsaturated metal cation active sites that can activate C-H bonds in propane. It suggests Zn and Zr cations in Zn-Zr-O catalysts serve as active sites for the first and second dehydrogenation steps respectively.

[1] most examples require a high reaction temperature (ca. 570 C) to reach a favorable substrate conversion.

[2] The high Ea observed for catalysts that are not exposed to a pre-reductive treatment gives evidence that additional energy is required for the formation of Zncus and Zrcus in situ.
