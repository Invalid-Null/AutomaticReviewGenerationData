[1] "Through evaluating various propane dehydrogenation reactions and conducting DFT calculations, we propose that Zncus and Zrcus present in ZncusOZrcus are the active sites for the first and second steps of C3H8 dehydrogenation, respectively."

[2] "The combination of Zn and Zr species led to dramatic changes in the structure and properties of the material, which led to the observed synergistic enhancement in activity, compared to the monometallic counterparts."  

[3] "The incorporation of Zn led to the formation of Zrcus and improved oxygen mobility; ZncusOZrcus are formed in situ under dehydrogenation conditions."

[4] "We propose that C3H8 first adsorbs on the surface of catalysts and then dehydrogenates one H on Zncus in ZncusOZrcus forming C3H7*; the C3H7* further dehydrogenates H on neighboring Zrcus in ZncusOZrcus to generate surface-adsorbed C3H6."

<English version answer>

1. Answer: The article does not evaluate Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

2. Answer: The article does not investigate how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance.

3. Answer: The article proposes that coordinatively unsaturated Zn (Zncus) and Zr (Zrcus) sites in ZncusOZrcus are the active sites for the first and second steps of propane dehydrogenation, respectively. The combination of Zn and Zr leads to synergistic enhancement in activity.

4. Answer: The article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

5. Answer: The article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation. 

6. Answer: The article does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts.

7. Answer: The article proposes that propane first adsorbs and dehydrogenates on Zncus sites, then the intermediate dehydrogenates on neighboring Zrcus sites to form propylene.

1. 答:该文没有评价Cr2O3、Pt-Sn、Ga2O3等有前途的金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。

2. 答:该文没有研究调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧迁移率和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。

3. 答:该文提出Zncus和Zrcus位于ZncusOZrcus中,是丙烷第一步和第二步脱氢的活性位点。Zn和Zr的组合导致协同增效活性。

4. 答:该文没有探讨金属氧化物催化剂中金属支撑物界面的效应用于丙烷脱氢。

5. 答:该文没有评价任何Pt、Pd或Ir等受支撑的单金属催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。

6. 答:该文没有研究金属颗粒大小、形状和支撑物交互作用等性质如何影响受支撑金属催化剂的性能。 

7. 答:该文提出丙烷首先吸附并在Zncus位点上脱氢,然后中间体在相邻的Zrcus位点上脱氢生成丙烯。
