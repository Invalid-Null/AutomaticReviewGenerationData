32. [1] "Besides, it was reported that the Lewis acid-base interaction plays a key role in the catalytic behavior of this type of catalyst, (27) which further increases the complexity of the system."
[2] "Thus, establishing scaling relations between the energies of simple adsorbed species and rate-controlling transition states/intermediates provides a way of identifying descriptor(s)."  
33. [1] "Herein, we combine DFT calculations, microkinetic analysis, and experiments to design M1Ga2O3 (M = Mn-Cu, Ru-Ag, and Os-Au) catalysts for PDH."
[2] "The stabilities, geometrical, and electronic structures of M1Ga2O3 are first studied."
[3] "Then, chemisorption energy scaling relations are established, during which the key role of the Lewis acid-base interaction is discussed."  
[4] "Next, different reactivity descriptors are identified when the Lewis acid-base interaction is present or absent on the metal-oxide surfaces."
[5] "After that, the activity, stability, and selectivity of the catalysts are examined to locate the optimal catalyst, which shows that the volcano-shaped activity plot can be broken through by the Lewis acid-base interaction."
