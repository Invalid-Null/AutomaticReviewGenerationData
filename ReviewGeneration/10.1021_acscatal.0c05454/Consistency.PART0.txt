 Here is the comparison of the answer files to the correct answers in JSON format:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "answer.PART0_0.txt": "0%", 
    "answer.PART0_1.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART0_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_3.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer.PART0_0.txt": "50%",
    "answer.PART0_1.txt": "50%", 
    "answer.PART0_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_3.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "3": {

  "7": {

}
```

To generate this, I compared the key points covered in each answer file to the correct answers provided for each question. I calculated the consistency ratio as the percentage of key points from the correct answer that were also present in the answer file. A consistency ratio of 100% indicates the answer file contained all the key points, while 0% means it contained none of the key points from the correct answer.
