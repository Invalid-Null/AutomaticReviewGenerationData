To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key points covered in each answer against the correct answers provided. I calculated the ratios manually based on my assessment of how relevant and complete each answer was relative to the expected answer. For completely inconsistent answers I assigned 0%, partially relevant answers 33-67%, and fully consistent answers 100%.
