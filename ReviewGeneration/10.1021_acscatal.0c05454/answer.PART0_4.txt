[1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and other chemicals, which is traditionally fabricated by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil products." 
[2] "Recently, large amounts of low-cost light alkanes are provided on the market with the exploration of shale gas, leading propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to be an attractive technology for producing propylene."

1. The article provides background that propylene is a valuable chemical feedstock used to produce polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other products. It explains that propylene is traditionally made by cracking naphtha and diesel fractions from crude oil, but new supplies of low cost propane from shale gas make propane dehydrogenation an attractive route.

[1] "Al2O3-supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts are employed in the industrial PDH processes. However, propylene selectivity and catalyst stability are still unsatisfactory on Pt-based catalysts, while CrOx-based catalysts suffer from environmental pollution."
[2] "Thus, driven by the strong desire to discover alternative catalysts, various metal oxides such as Ga2O3, (35) VOx, (69) ZrO2, (1012) CeO2, (13,14) ZnO, (15,16) and TiO2 (17,18) have been extensively studied, among which Ga2O3 is one of the most promising."

2. The article explains that current industrial PDH catalysts based on Pt/Al2O3 and CrOx have limitations in selectivity and stability or environmental issues. This has driven research into alternative metal oxide catalysts including Ga2O3, VOx, ZrO2, CeO2, ZnO and TiO2, with Ga2O3 showing particular promise.

[1] "Theoretically, the prediction of trends in catalytic properties employing descriptor-based volcano plots has been successfully applied to high-throughput screening of metal catalysts."
[2] "Then, the Lewis acidbase interaction energy ΔEint,acidbase is calculated on the surfaces where the Lewis acidbase pair is present (see Section S15 in the Supporting Information for details), and the negative and positive values of the ΔEint,acidbase indicate the presence and absence of the Lewis acidbase interaction, respectively."

[1] "The calculated DRC of species/transition states involved in a simplified reaction network for PDH (Table S5) is summarized in Table 1. From the table, one can see that on the majority of the surfaces, the absolute values of XCH3CHHCH3* are the largest, indicating that the first dehydrogenation step of propane is rate-limiting." 
[2] "Having identified the rate-limiting transition state/intermediate, we are now in a position to establish the relations between their formation energies and the formation energies of simple adsorbed species, i.e., to identify the descriptor that can describe the energies of the adsorbed species in the kinetic model."
