32. [1] "Besides, it was reported that the Lewis acid-base interaction plays a key role in the catalytic behavior of this type of catalyst, (27) which further increases the complexity of the system."
[2] "Thus, establishing scaling relations between the energies of simple adsorbed species and rate-controlling transition states/intermediates provides a way of identifying descriptor(s)."  
33. [1] "Herein, we combine DFT calculations, microkinetic analysis, and experiments to design M1Ga2O3 (M = Mn-Cu, Ru-Ag, and Os-Au) catalysts for PDH."
[2] "The stabilities, geometrical, and electronic structures of M1Ga2O3 are first studied."
[3] "Then, chemisorption energy scaling relations are established, during which the key role of the Lewis acid-base interaction is discussed."  
[4] "Next, different reactivity descriptors are identified when the Lewis acid-base interaction is present or absent on the metal-oxide surfaces."
[5] "After that, the activity, stability, and selectivity of the catalysts are examined to locate the optimal catalyst, which shows that the volcano-shaped activity plot can be broken through by the Lewis acid-base interaction."

<English version answer>

29. No. The article does not discuss process intensification approaches for propane dehydrogenation.

30. No. The article does not analyze techno-economic factors affecting propane dehydrogenation. 

31. No. The article does not discuss safety issues like flammability and explosion hazards with propane dehydrogenation.

32. Answer: The article notes remaining challenges around understanding the role of Lewis acid-base interactions in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It also says more work is needed to establish scaling relations between energies of adsorbed species and rate-controlling transition states/intermediates.

33. Answer: The article proposes using high-throughput DFT calculations, microkinetic modeling, and experiments to screen and design optimized propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It describes studying catalyst stability, structure, scaling relations, descriptors, and activity to identify an optimal single-atom catalyst.

34. No. The article does not highlight needs for improved in situ characterization tools.

35. No. The article does not envision transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation.
