[1] "It is therefore interesting to figure out if the scaling relations can be affected by the presence of the Lewis acid–base interaction."

[2] "By contrast, when the Lewis acid–base interaction occurs, the EH&H@MO becomes the descriptor and the PDH rate increases as H&H is bound more tightly at the MO site, causing the Ir-doped surface to show the best catalytic activity (Figure 5e)."

[3] "Previously, Sattler et al. reported that the addition of 1000 ppm of Pt would enhance the activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst."

[4] "In the presence of the Lewis acid–base interaction, other single-metal-doped surfaces, particularly the Ir-doped surface, are predicted to show better catalytic activity than Pt1Ga2O3."  

[5] "Further experiments verify that the Ir1Ga2O3 candidate is more effective than the previously reported trace-Pt-promoted Ga2O3 catalyst, and the significantly improved catalytic performance is attributed to single-Ir-atom doping at the Ga(o) sites."

Answer: The article investigates how tuning acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that the presence of Lewis acid-base interactions between co-adsorbed species on Ir-doped Ga2O3 leads to higher catalytic activity compared to Pt-doped Ga2O3, which was previously reported as an effective catalyst. Experiments confirm Ir1Ga2O3 is more effective than trace-Pt-Ga2O3, with the improved performance attributed to single Ir atom doping.

答:该文研究了调控金属氧化物的酸碱性质如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。结果显示,Ir掺杂Ga2O3上的共吸附物种之间的路易斯酸碱相互作用导致其催化活性比之前报道的有效催化剂Pt掺杂Ga2O3更高。实验确认,Ir1Ga2O3的效果比痕量Pt-Ga2O3更好,改进的性能归因于单原子Ir掺杂。

[1] "Then, chemisorption energy scaling relations are established, during which the key role of the Lewis acid–base interaction is discussed." 

[2] "The geometries of the transition states for the two dehydrogenation steps of propane are shown in Figure 4c–f, from which it can be seen that there are two types of transition state structures for both the first and second dehydrogenation steps of propane (TS1 and TS2)."

[3] "Due to the diversity of the transition state structures over M1Ga2O3(100), it is hard to classify the surfaces from a geometrical perspective. However, according to the electronic structures, the surfaces can be categorized into two groups according to the Lewis acid–base interaction."

[4] "When the Lewis acid–base interaction is absent, the rate-controlling transition state/intermediate is TS1*/H*." 

[5] "When the Lewis acid–base interaction is present on the surface, however, the rate-limiting transition state is either TS1* or TS2*, where the formation energy of TS1/TS2 (ETS1/ETS2) scales linearly with the formation energy of H&H coadsorption at the MO site (EH&H@MO), as shown in Figure 5b,c, indicating that EH&H@MO can be used as the descriptor, which is due to the fact that the coadsorption energy scaling relations can only hold when the Lewis acid–base interaction occurs."

Answer: The article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. It shows there are two types of transition state structures for the dehydrogenation steps, with the surfaces categorized into two groups based on presence/absence of Lewis acid-base interactions. The rate-limiting transition state is TS1* or TS2* when the interaction is present, with TS1/TS2 energies scaling with H&H co-adsorption energy at the metal-oxygen site. This co-adsorption energy is identified as the descriptor in that case.

答:该文为所研究的金属氧化物催化剂上的丙烷脱氢提出了机理方案。它显示脱氢步骤有两种过渡态结构,根据路易斯酸碱相互作用的存在与否,表面可以分为两组。当相互作用存在时,速控步骤为TS1*或TS2*,TS1/TS2的能量与金属氧位点上的H&H共吸附能呈线性关系。在这种情况下,该共吸附能被确定为描述子。
