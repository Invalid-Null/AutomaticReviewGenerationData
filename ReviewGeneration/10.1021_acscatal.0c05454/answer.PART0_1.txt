[1] "To shed light on the reason the catalytic performance of Ga2O3 can be dramatically promoted by trace amounts of Pt, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic analysis were performed over the single-Pt-atom-doped Ga2O3(100) surface, in which the bifunctional character of the PtGa2O3 catalyst was elucidated and the PtO and GaO sites were identified as the active sites for dehydrogenation and H2 desorption, respectively."

[2] "Spin-polarized DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)." 

[3] "The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW) was employed to account for the exchange and correlation of the KohnSham theory."

[4] "The CatMAP code was used to perform the microkinetic analysis under the experimental conditions at 848.15 K, 0.2 bar of C3H8, and 0.16 bar of H2."
