 Unfortunately, this literature does not contain information relevant to answering the questions asked. The questions appear to be asking about propane dehydrogenation and catalyst development, but the literature is a paper titled "New Risk Assessment Approach for Systemic Insecticides: The Case of Honey Bees and Imidacloprid" that discusses assessing the risk of insecticides to honey bees.
