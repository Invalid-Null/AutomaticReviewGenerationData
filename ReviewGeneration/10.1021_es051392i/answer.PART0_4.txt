 Unfortunately, this literature does not contain information relevant to answering the provided questions, which appear to be about catalytic propane dehydrogenation. The literature is a scientific article about assessing the risk of the pesticide imidacloprid to honey bees. It does not provide any information about propylene production, catalyst mechanisms, thermodynamic constraints on propane dehydrogenation, computational modeling of this reaction, or structure-activity relationships for applicable catalysts.

Since there is no relevant information in the literature to answer the questions, there are no quotes to extract.
