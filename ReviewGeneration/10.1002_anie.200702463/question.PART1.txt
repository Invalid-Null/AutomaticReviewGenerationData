Water-Promoted Hydrocarbon Activation Catalyzed by Binuclear Gallium Sites in ZSM-5 Zeolite
Graphical Abstract
Steamy alkane activation: Propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5 is substantially improved upon addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed, which is due to an increase of the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. Quantum-chemical computations indicate that H2 recombination, required to initiate the catalytic cycle, is more favorable over binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes than over mononuclear GaO+ ions (see picture).
Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes.1,2 Combining partial alkane dehydrogenation with subsequent olefin conversion is another option.3 An additional appealing example is the incorporation of methane into gasoline products in the MTG process over Ga/HZSM-5.4 A catalytic issue relates to the nature of the cationic clusters. Are the alkanes activated by isolated cations, or do the extraframework oxygen atoms also play a role? Current literature on Zn- and Ga-promoted catalysis in zeolites mainly refers to systems in which the state of the cationic cluster is not well-defined.1,2 As a starting point for this study, a zeolitic material has been chosen in which Ga+ ions can be considered as single-site catalysts. The water-induced enhancement in the rate of alkane activation by Ga/ZSM-5, as discussed herein, relates to transformation of these single Ga+ centers to binuclear cationic Ga complexes involving a Ga2O22+ core.
Recent experimental58 and computational913 studies have contributed to our understanding of the mechanism of alkane activation by single Ga Lewis acid sites. As candidate active sites, various mononuclear Ga-containing cations (Ga+, GaH2+, GaH2+, GaO+) have been considered.813 Quantum-chemical calculations13 showed that CH bond activation by reduced Ga/ZSM-5 proceeds over the Lewis acidbase pair formed by the Ga+ ion and a zeolite-framework basic oxygen anion (Ga+ZO). The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions.8 Their higher reactivity is derived from more facile CH bond cleavage catalyzed by the stronger Lewis acidbase pair formed by a Ga3+ ion and the extraframework oxygen atom. The following elementary reaction steps [Eqs.(1)(4)] may be proposed for alkane (RH) dehydrogenation by the gallyl ion., , ,

Earlier studies6,10 have shown that H2O formation [Eq.(4)] is energetically favored over H2 desorption [Eq.(3)] catalyzed by these mononuclear GaO+ species. Indeed, oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 rapidly looses its high initial activity in propane conversion because of Ga3+ reduction to Ga+.8 According to this reaction scheme, GaO+ can be stabilized by addition of steam. Herein, we report experimental results showing that addition of steam indeed substantially increases the rate of alkane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5 and results in stable operation. A mechanistic model is proposed, which is supported by DFT calculations of the stability of various possible cationic Ga-containing species formed upon hydroxylation. Also, energy barriers associated with H2 recombination are reported.
The results of catalytic activity measurements of propane conversion as a function of the steam partial pressure over initial Ga+ ions in ZSM-5 are summarized in Table1. Clearly, cofeeding of water leads to a substantial increase of the propane conversion. The conversion passes a maximum at p of 0.3kPa. Catalyst performance in the presence of steam (0.3kPa) was found to be stable over a period of at least 4h. The very different product composition between Ga+/ZSM-5 in the absence of steam and HZSM-5 points to a change in the mechanism from protolytic hydrocarbon activation involving CH and CC bond cleavage for HZSM-5 to dominant CH activation by the Lewis acidic Ga cations.8

Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity. The main product remains propylene, although with increasing water content slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed. The formation of methane and ethylene is due to protolytic cracking of propane. This finding indicates some regeneration of Brnsted acid protons, which are formed upon hydrolysis of gallium species.6 More ethylene than methane is formed because of additional proton-catalyzed oligomerization/cracking reactions of propylene. The carbon selectivity to dehydrogenated products remains well over 85%. The increased dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 is obvious from the increased amount of hydrogen formed. No carbon oxides were detected in the reactor effluent. The activity decrease at higher p is likely due to more complete hydrolysis of the active intrazeolitic Ga sites. 27AlNMR spectroscopy measurements indicate that prolonged steam exposure does not lead to massive redistribution of tetrahedral aluminium species (see the Supporting Information).
The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion. However, Table2 shows that the energy barrier for hydrogen recombination is prohibitively high (305kJmol1), which is due to the very low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom. In agreement with earlier computations,11 water formation is strongly favored. We propose that multinuclear Ga sites are formed. To clarify whether such species can be generated upon water adsorption and whether their formation facilitates hydrogen desorption, we studied the interaction of two distantly placed Ga+ ions with H2O by quantum-chemical cluster calculations in the DFT formalism. The Ga+ions are stabilized by two negatively charged Al-containing oxygen tetrahedra embedded in a cluster of 14 Tatoms (T=Si, Al) representing the elongated eight-membered ring of the wall of the sinusoidal channel of MFI zeolite. The cluster approach was chosen, because modeling of the unit cell of MFI zeolite with 96 Tatoms is computationally prohibitive. On the other hand, the cluster with 14 Tatoms is large enough to account for all significant interactions between the cationic species and the zeolite framework as well as to describe activation of small molecules such as H2 and H2O. This conclusion is supported by recent quantum-chemical calculations with this cluster.12 Water dissociation at clusterI is exothermic (ΔE=102kJmol1, Figure1) and leads to formation of structureII, which contains a [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ion in which the hydroxyl group coordinates to the neighboring Ga+ ion. This structure can rearrange by migration of the hydroxyl Hatom to the Ga+ion to give structureIII, an oxygen-bridged binuclear [{Ga3+(H)}2O]2+ ion. The latter rearrangement allows an additional stabilization energy of 44kJmol1. Reaction of a second water molecule with structureIII results in further stabilization of the extraframework gallium dimer by 69kJmol1 and gives structureIV (Figure1). StructureIV contains an almost square and planar Ga2O2 core with hydride ions and protons bound to the extraframework Ga cations and O anions, respectively. Rearrangement of structureIV to the conventional situation with two isolated [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ions (structureV) interacting through a hydrogen bond costs 68kJmol1.

Since hydrogen-atom recombination at the hydroxylated structuresII and IV is required to initiate alkane dehydrogenation, the corresponding energetics were evaluated. Reaction energies and activation barriers are listed in Table2. Coordination of the hydroxyl group of the [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion to the neighboring gallium cation results in a significant decrease of the reaction energy for H2 recombination (147kJmol1) compared to that from the isolated [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion (242kJmol1).
In contrast, the effect on H2O desorption is much smaller. Very similar trends are noted for H2 and H2O desorption from structureIV. The strong decrease in the activation energy for H2 recombination on the Ga dimer is due to the increased acidity of the OH group. Compared to the [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ion, the OH bond is weaker in the dimer, which can be understood from the bond-order conservation principle.14 Moreover, for the dimer complex, H2 recombination does not result in complete decomposition of the stable tetrahedral arrangement around the Ga cations. Hydrogen recombination from the isolated [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ion results in less stable three-fold coordinated Ga.
These theoretical insights imply that H2 desorption should be facile from hydroxylated Ga clusters in ZSM-5. To verify this assertion, we carried out a temperature-programmed experiment over Ga+/ZSM-5 in an atmosphere of 0.3vol% H2O in He. Hydrogen evolution is observed around 600K (see the Supporting Information). In a similar experiment with HZSM-5, no hydrogen was formed. The desorption energy estimated from the H2 desorption maximum gives a value of 14012kJmol1. This result agrees well with the computed value for H2 recombination from the fully hydroxylated cluster (IVVII, ΔE=127kJmol1, Table2). Structural information about the Ga species in Ga/ZSM-5 was obtained by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra at the Ga Kedge. Table3 lists the EXAFS fit parameters for a model catalyst obtained by oxidation of Ga+/ZSM-5 by nitrous oxide at 473K that shows a high initial activity in propane conversion.8 Four Oatoms are detected at a distance of 1.84Å. A GaGa coordination is identified at an interatomic distance of 2.98Å with a coordination number close to one. A GaAl backscatterer at a distance of 2.72Å with a coordination number of 1.1 is included. These structural data attest to the presence of a Ga2O2 core structure coordinating to the zeolite oxygen anions with a structure in reasonable agreement with the DFT calculations. While EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data, we note that the computations have been carried out for one specific ring structure. A detailed study of the sites of bivalent cations has shown a preference for the occurrence of Al pairs in the ring structures of ZSM-5 zeolite for Si/Al ratios up to 22.15

In summary, addition of water to reduced Ga cations stabilizes binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic reaction intermediates. The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption. In essence, the result that H2 recombination is facilitated at Gasites is in agreement with earlier kinetic studies over reduced Ga/HZSM-5.16 The higher activity of dimeric oxygen-bridged Gaspecies compared to single-site Ga+ species is in line with the lower energy for H2 recombination.13 Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination. Similar to earlier findings for the single-site Ga+ catalyst,13 the last two steps may take place in a concerted manner. Continuous addition of water is required to maintain a high steady-state concentration of the hydroxylated reaction intermediate.

Proposed reaction cycle for alkane dehydrogenation over binuclear Ga-containing cations in the presence of water.
Experimental Section
Ga/ZSM-5 was prepared according to reference8. In Ga/ZSM-5 the Brnsted protons have been quantitatively replaced by Ga+ ions. Propane conversion was carried out in a single-pass atmospheric quartz reactor by passing a mixture of C3H8 (5kPa) in He with WHSV=11.8gpropanegcatalyst1h1 at 823K. Water was added via a well-thermostated saturator. X-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements were carried out at the Ga Kedge (Dubble, ESRF). Structural information was extracted from the k1- and k3-weighted EXAFS functions by multiple-shell fitting in Rspace. Quantum-chemical cluster calculations at the DFT level were carried out to compute the relative stability of various Ga cationic species coordinating to a zeolite cluster. A zeolite cluster representative of the elongated eight-membered ring of the sinusoidal channel of MFI zeolite and containing two framework substitutions (Al3+ for Si4+) was employed. Further experimental and computational details are given in the Supporting Information.
