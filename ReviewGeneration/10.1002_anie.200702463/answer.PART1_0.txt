1. Combining partial alkane dehydrogenation with subsequent olefin conversion is another option.3 An additional appealing example is the incorporation of methane into gasoline products in the MTG process over Ga/HZSM-5.4

2. A catalytic issue relates to the nature of the cationic clusters. Are the alkanes activated by isolated cations, or do the extraframework oxygen atoms also play a role? Current literature on Zn- and Ga-promoted catalysis in zeolites mainly refers to systems in which the state of the cationic cluster is not well-defined.1,2 As a starting point for this study, a zeolitic material has been chosen in which Ga+ ions can be considered as single-site catalysts. 

3. The water-induced enhancement in the rate of alkane activation by Ga/ZSM-5, as discussed herein, relates to transformation of these single Ga+ centers to binuclear cationic Ga complexes involving a Ga2O22+ core.

1. The article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts.

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of Ga species in ZSM-5 affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that forming binuclear Ga complexes with a Ga2O2 core leads to higher activity compared to mononuclear Ga ions. 

3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic reaction pathway for propane dehydrogenation over binuclear Ga sites in ZSM-5, involving alkane activation by a Ga3+-O pair, olefin desorption, and H2 recombination. Specific steps, intermediates, and active sites are described.

4. No, the article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in the studied catalysts. It focuses on the nature of Ga species within the ZSM-5 zeolite.

5. No, the article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic Pt, Pd or Ir catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

6. No, the article does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape etc. affect supported metal catalyst performance, as it does not study supported metals.

7. No, the article does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts.

8. No, the article does not evaluate promising metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation besides Ga/ZSM-5.
