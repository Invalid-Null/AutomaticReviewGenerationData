[1] "We propose that multinuclear Ga sites are formed. To clarify whether such species can be generated upon water adsorption and whether their formation facilitates hydrogen desorption, we studied the interaction of two distantly placed Ga+ ions with H2O by quantum-chemical cluster calculations in the DFT formalism."

[2] "In summary, addition of water to reduced Ga cations stabilizes binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic reaction intermediates. The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption."

[3] "Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."

Answer: Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over binuclear gallium sites in Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. Specifically, it suggests that water addition helps stabilize binuclear Ga species with a Ga2O2 core, with increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl facilitating H2 desorption. Alkane dehydrogenation is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation over the Lewis acid-base pair of Ga3+ and extraframework O, followed by olefin desorption and H2 recombination.

Answer: 是的,这篇文章提出了Ga/ZSM-5沸石催化剂上双核镓位点催化丙烷脱氢的机理假说。具体来说,它认为水的加入有助于稳定含有Ga2O2核心的双核镓种,桥氧羟基的酸度增加有利于H2脱附。它认为烷烃脱氢是通过Ga3+和框架外氧组成的路易斯酸-碱对发生异裂,随后发生烯烃脱附和H2重组。
