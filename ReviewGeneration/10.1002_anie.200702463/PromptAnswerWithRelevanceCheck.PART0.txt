 Unfortunately this literature does not contain information to answer any of the specific questions asked. The article is about water-promoted hydrocarbon activation catalyzed by binuclear gallium sites in ZSM-5 zeolite. It does not discuss propylene production, importance and applications of propylene, propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and kinetics, thermodynamic constraints, DFT calculations of propane dehydrogenation, microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation, or structure-activity relationships for propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

 Unfortunately, this scientific literature does not provide sufficient quotes or information to answer the given questions about propylene production through propane dehydrogenation. 

The article focuses instead on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over zeolites containing gallium active sites. It discusses how addition of steam to Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts leads to formation of binuclear gallium sites that demonstrate higher activity and stability for propane dehydrogenation compared to mononuclear sites.
