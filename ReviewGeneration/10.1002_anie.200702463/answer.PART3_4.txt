<English version answer>

1. Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single Ga Lewis acid sites in zeolitic ZSM-5 supports by quantitatively replacing Brønsted protons with Ga+ ions.  

2. No, the article does not evaluate metal encapsulation.

3. No, the article does not investigate catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. 

4. No, the article does not utilize in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

5. No, the article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces.

6. Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS/EXAFS) at the Ga K-edge to probe structural changes in the Ga species during reaction. Multiple shell fitting of the EXAFS data provides insights into the Ga coordination environment.

7. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types.
