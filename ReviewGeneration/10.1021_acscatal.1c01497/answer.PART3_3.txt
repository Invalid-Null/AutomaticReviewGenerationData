<quotes>
[1] "In situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy was employed to investigate the effect of C3H8 on GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 at reaction temperature."

[2] "In situ FTIR spectra were collected on an Agilent CARY 660 spectrometer equipped with an mercurycadmiumtelluride detector." 

[3] "In situ FTIR spectroscopy was employed to demonstrate the replacement of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) by gallium after reduction at high temperature and the formation of GaHx including Ga dihydride (2041 cm1) and Ga monohydride (2059 cm1) and suggested that GaHx plays an important role in PDH."

[4] "Control experiments rule out the possible influence of water vapor in the evacuated cell on the spectra based on the lack of the Ga(OH)x band at 3662 cm-1 (Figure S11)."

[5] "FTIR spectroscopy shows that a fraction of BAS on Ga/H-ZSM-5 is consumed in the presence of C3H8 and C3H6." 

[6] "This is clear evidence of C3H8 interacting with BAS at the reaction temperature."

4. Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in situ FTIR spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses in situ FTIR to investigate the effect of propane on GaHx species on Ga/H-ZSM-5 at reaction temperatures, to demonstrate the formation of GaHx species after high temperature reduction, to show propane's interaction with Brønsted acid sites, and to rule out the influence of water vapor. The data provides evidence for propane's role in promoting GaHx decomposition and its interaction with both Ga species and Brønsted acid sites.

4. 答:是的,这篇文章利用了原位傅里叶变换红外光谱技术来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。具体而言,它使用原位傅里叶变换红外光谱技术来研究丙烷对Ga/H-ZSM-5上的GaHx物种的影响,证明了高温还原后GaHx物种的形成,展示了丙烷与Brønsted酸碱点的相互作用,并排除了水蒸气的影响。数据提供了证据,表明丙烷促进GaHx的分解,并与Ga物种和Brønsted酸碱点都有相互作用。
