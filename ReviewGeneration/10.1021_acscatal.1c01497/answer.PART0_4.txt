[1] The elevated temperature (500 C) at which the PDH reaction takes place makes detection of reaction intermediates challenging, and mechanistic hypotheses are based largely on computational insights. (2) Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are typically characterized ex situ, at conditions at which Ga speciation could be significantly different from Ga speciation at PDH conditions.

2. Answer: The article explains that the high temperature of propane dehydrogenation makes detecting reaction intermediates difficult, so mechanistic hypotheses rely largely on computational insights. It also notes that catalysts are typically characterized under conditions where gallium speciation differs from that during propane dehydrogenation.
