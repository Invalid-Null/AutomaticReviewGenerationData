The key findings are:
- Ga/H-ZSM-5 is identified as highly active and selective for propane dehydrogenation. 
- The proximity of Ga+ sites to H+ sites (Ga+-H+ pairs) is critical, with Ga+-H+ pairs much more active than isolated Ga+ sites.
- An alkyl mechanism is proposed, with Ga+ sites activating propane to form alkyl species.

Therefore, I conclude that Ga/H-ZSM-5, specifically the Ga+-H+ pairs, are the main scientific contribution highlighted in this paper for propane dehydrogenation catalysis.
