Answer: The article does not investigate how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It focuses solely on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

<quotes>
[1] "Ga+ preferentially exchanges with one H+ in proton pairs to form Ga+H+ pair sites at low Ga loadings."

[2] "The turnover frequency on Ga+H+ pair sites in the PDH is higher than that of isolated Ga+ sites by a factor of 15." 

[3] "Instead of considering [GaH]2+ as the active site in the PDH reaction, we propose that [GaH]2+ is merely an intermediate formed in the rate-limiting hydride extraction of the propyl group."

[4] "C3H8 can be activated at BAS, isolated Ga+ sites, and Ga+ - H+ pair sites, though the resulting intermediates are different on BAS and Ga species."

[5] "We hypothesize that carbenium ions are formed on the BAS, and alkyl species are formed on Ga species."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes that propane dehydrogenation on Ga/H-ZSM-5 occurs via an alkyl mechanism, where propane is activated on Ga+H+ pair sites or isolated Ga+ sites to form alkyl species. The proximity of Ga+ cations to Brønsted acid sites facilitates hydride abstraction to form propylene. Key steps involve the formation of a Ga-propyl intermediate, abstraction of a hydride to form [GaH]2+ and propylene, and recombining hydrogen to evolve H2 gas. Carbenium ions can also form on the Brønsted acid sites.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
答:文章提出丙烷在Ga/H-ZSM-5上的脱氢发生烷基机理,丙烷在Ga+H+配位位点或隔离Ga+位点上被激活形成烷基种。靠近的Ga+阳离子与Brønsted酸位有利于提取氢形成丙烯。关键步骤包括形成Ga-丙基中间体,提取氢形成[GaH]2+和丙烯,以及重组氢气释放H2。碳离子还可以在Brønsted酸位上形成。

<quotes>
[1] "In this work, intrinsic PDH rates and activation energies were determined on Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with a wide range of Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios."

[2] "Experimental measurements combined with a dual-site model show the activation energy in the PDH on the Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites to be 90.8 ± 1.5 and 117 ± 4.7 kJ·mol−1, respectively." 

[3] "These results demonstrate that Ga+H+ pair sites are much more active in the PDH than isolated Ga+ sites."

[4] "Instead of considering [GaH]2+ as the active site in the PDH reaction, we propose that [GaH]2+ is merely an intermediate formed in the rate-limiting hydride extraction of the propyl group (step 2, Scheme 2c)."

[5] "C3H8 can be activated at BAS, isolated Ga+ sites, and Ga+ − H+ pair sites, though the resulting intermediates are different on BAS and Ga species." 

[6] "We hypothesize that carbenium ions are formed on the BAS as proposed by Iglesia and Biscardi, and alkyl species are formed on Ga species (Scheme 2b,c)."

Answer: The article proposes that propane dehydrogenation occurs via an alkyl mechanism, where propane is activated on Ga+H+ pair sites or isolated Ga+ sites to form alkyl intermediates. Ga+H+ pair sites have lower activation energy (90.8 kJ/mol) and are much more active than isolated Ga+ sites (117 kJ/mol). The key intermediate is proposed to be [GaH]2+ formed from hydride abstraction of the alkyl group. BAS can also activate propane to form carbenium ions, but this is proposed to be a minor pathway.

答:这篇文章提出丙烷脱氢发生乙基机理,丙烷在Ga+H+成对位点或孤立Ga+位点上被活化形成乙基中间体。Ga+H+成对位点的活化能(90.8 kJ/mol)较低,活性远高于孤立Ga+位点(117 kJ/mol)。关键中间体被提出为从乙基基团中提取氢化物形成的[GaH]2+。Lewis碱位点也��以活化丙烷形成碳正离子,但这被认为是次要途��。

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. Specifically, it determines the intrinsic PDH rates and activation energies on Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites, finding the former to be 15 times more active with a lower activation energy of 90.8 kJ/mol compared to 117 kJ/mol for isolated Ga+ sites. The article proposes that C3H8 can be activated on Brønsted acid sites (BAS), isolated Ga+ sites, and Ga+–H+ pair sites to form different intermediates, with carbenium ions on BAS and alkyl species on Ga species. The key intermediate [GaH]2+ is proposed to form via hydride extraction from the alkyl species on the Ga+–H+ pair sites.

答:该文章为在所研究的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂上丙烷脱氢提出了机理方案。具体来说,它确定了Ga+H+配位位点和孤立Ga+位点上的内在PDH速率和活化能,发现前者的活性比后者高15倍,活化能更低,为90.8 kJ/mol,而孤立Ga+位点的活化能为117 kJ/mol。该文章提出C3H8可以在Bronsted酸位点(BAS)、孤立Ga+位点和Ga+–H+配位位点上活化形成不同的中间体,在BAS上形成碳正离子,在Ga种形成烷基种。关键中间体[GaH]2+被提出是通过从Ga+–H+配位位点上的烷基种中提取氢化物而形成的。
