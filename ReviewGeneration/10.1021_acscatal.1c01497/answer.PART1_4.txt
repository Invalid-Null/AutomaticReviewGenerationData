<quotes>
[1] "In this work, intrinsic PDH rates and activation energies were determined on Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with a wide range of Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios."

[2] "Ga+H+ pair sites are more active in the PDH than isolated Ga+ sites by a factor of 15, and the activation energy in the PDH on the Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites to be 90.8 ± 1.5 and 117 ± 4.7 kJ·mol1, respectively."

[3] "The higher fitted activation energy for the isolated Ga+ sites than that of Ga+H+ pair sites is consistent with the mechanism proposed in Scheme 1."

[4] "Instead of considering [GaH]2+ as the active site in the PDH reaction, we propose that [GaH]2+ is merely an intermediate formed in the rate-limiting hydride extraction of the propyl group (step 2, Scheme 2c)."

[5] "C3H8 can be activated at BAS, isolated Ga+ sites, and Ga+  H+ pair sites, though the resulting intermediates are different on BAS and Ga species." 

[6] "We hypothesize that carbenium ions are formed on the BAS as proposed by Iglesia and Biscardi, and alkyl species are formed on Ga species (Scheme 2b,c)."

Answer: The article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. Specifically, it determines the intrinsic PDH rates and activation energies on Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites, finding the former to be 15 times more active with a lower activation energy of 90.8 kJ/mol compared to 117 kJ/mol for isolated Ga+ sites. The article proposes that C3H8 can be activated on Brønsted acid sites (BAS), isolated Ga+ sites, and Ga+–H+ pair sites to form different intermediates, with carbenium ions on BAS and alkyl species on Ga species. The key intermediate [GaH]2+ is proposed to form via hydride extraction from the alkyl species on the Ga+–H+ pair sites.

答:该文章为在所研究的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂上丙烷脱氢提出了机理方案。具体来说,它确定了Ga+H+配位位点和孤立Ga+位点上的内在PDH速率和活化能,发现前者的活性比后者高15倍,活化能更低,为90.8 kJ/mol,而孤立Ga+位点的活化能为117 kJ/mol。该文章提出C3H8可以在Bronsted酸位点(BAS)、孤立Ga+位点和Ga+–H+配位位点上活化形成不同的中间体,在BAS上形成碳正离子,在Ga种形成烷基种。关键中间体[GaH]2+被提出是通过从Ga+–H+配位位点上的烷基种中提取氢化物而形成的。
