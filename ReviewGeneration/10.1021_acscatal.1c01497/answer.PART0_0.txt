[1] "Catalysts employed in the two commercial PDH processes, i.e., supported PtSn for the Oleflex process and CrOx/Al2O3 for the Catofin process, suffer from either high cost and fast deactivation or undesirable environmental impacts, (1) which incentivizes the search for alternative catalysts."

[2] "In particular, the correlation between various Ga species present on the catalyst at the reaction conditions and the PDH activity has yet to be established."  

[3] "These results demonstrate that Ga+H+ pair sites are much more active in the PDH than isolated Ga+ sites."

[4] "Instead of considering [GaH]2+ as the active site in the PDH reaction, (47) we propose that [GaH]2+ is merely an intermediate formed in the rate-limiting hydride extraction of the propyl group (step 2, Scheme 2c)."

Answer: The article explains how catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers through providing alternative active sites to the commercial catalysts. It establishes that Ga+H+ pair sites have lower activation energy and are much more active than isolated Ga+ sites in propane dehydrogenation. The hydride extraction of the propyl group on Ga+H+ pair sites is proposed as the rate-limiting step.

答:该文解释了催化剂通过提供替代的活性位点来降低丙烷脱氢的活化能垒,促进丙烷脱氢反应。文中确立了Ga+H+成对位点相比孤立的Ga+位点具有更低的活化能,在丙烷脱氢反应中活性更高。在Ga+H+成对位点上丙基团的氢化物提取被提出为速率控制步骤。

[1] "Despite the extensive literature on Ga/H-ZSM-5, the determination of active species and the mechanism in the PDH reaction remain topics of considerable discussion."

[2] "The elevated temperature (500 C) at which the PDH reaction takes place makes detection of reaction intermediates challenging, and mechanistic hypotheses are based largely on computational insights."

[3] "Different research groups tend to use samples with different Si/Al ratios, which makes direct comparisons difficult."

[4] "On samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15, as the Ga/Al ratio increases, the TOFAl increases rapidly with the Ga loading up to the Ga/Al ratio of 0.05 and then increases more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3 before declining with the further addition of Ga (Figure 1a)." 

[5] "The large difference between the PDH rates on Ga/H-ZSM-5 and H-ZSM-5 indicates that the contribution to the overall PDH activity from the residual BAS in Ga/H-ZSM-5 is minor."

[6] "The apparent activation energy (Eapp) of the PDH on the Ga+H+ pair sites is lower than that on the isolated Ga+ sites."

[7] "Instead of considering [GaH]2+ as the active site in the PDH reaction, (47) we propose that [GaH]2+ is merely an intermediate formed in the rate-limiting hydride extraction of the propyl group (step 2, Scheme 2c)."

[8] "Propane promotion of the decomposition of GaHx is also supported by kinetic measurements, in which the decomposition rate of GaHx is determined via transmission FTIR spectroscopy." 

[9] "The activation energy of GaHx decomposition is higher than that of the PDH, indicating that the hydrogen evolution from GaHx decomposition is not part of the PDH mechanism."

Answer: The article discusses kinetic and thermodynamic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. It states that high reaction temperature of 500°C makes detection of intermediates challenging, leading to reliance on computational insights for mechanistic hypotheses. Different research groups using varying Si/Al ratios makes direct comparison difficult. It provides quantitative details on how propane dehydrogenation rates and apparent activation energies vary with Si/Al ratio and Ga loading on the catalysts. Kinetic measurements show Ga+H+ sites have lower activation energy than isolated Ga+ sites. Decomposition kinetics indicate GaHx is not part of the mechanism.

答:该文讨论了丙烷脱氢反应中涉及的动力学和热力学因素。它指出了高达500°C的反应温度使中间体的检测具有挑战性,导致依赖计算见解来提出反应机理假说。不同研究小组使用不同的Si/Al比使直接比较困难。文中提供了丙烷脱氢反应速率和表观活化能随Si/Al比和催化剂上的Ga负载量变化的定量细节。动力学测量显示Ga+H+位点的活化能低于孤立的Ga+位点。分解动力学表明GaHx不是机理中的一部分。
