To determine the consistency percentages, I compared the key points made in each answer against the correct answer provided. Questions with fully consistent answers were marked as 100%, while completely inconsistent were 0%. Partially consistent answers received intermediate percentage scores.

I parsed through the quote selections and answer texts to systematically evaluate consistency across questions and answer files on the key technical details. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
