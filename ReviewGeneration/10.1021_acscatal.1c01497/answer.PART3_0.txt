 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that directly address any of the questions. The article focuses on understanding the correlation between Ga speciation and propane dehydrogenation activity on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts through experimental techniques like rate measurements, activation energy modeling, and in situ FTIR spectroscopy. It does not discuss catalyst preparation methods, metal encapsulation, advanced microscopy characterization, different reactor types, or X-ray techniques for studying oxidation state changes during catalysis.

1. Answer: The article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports.

2. Answer: The article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability.

3. Answer: The article does not investigate catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. 

4. Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ FTIR spectroscopy to study propane and propylene interaction with Ga species and Brønsted acid sites in working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. This provides evidence for the alkyl mechanism being more likely than the carbenium mechanism.

5. Answer: The article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

6. Answer: The article does not use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis.

7. Answer: The article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.

8. Answer: The article does not provide insights into fixed beds, fluidized beds, or membrane reactors for propane dehydrogenation.
