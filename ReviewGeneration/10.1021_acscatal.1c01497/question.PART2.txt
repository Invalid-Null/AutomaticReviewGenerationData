Understanding the Correlation between Ga Speciation and Propane Dehydrogenation Activity on Ga/H-ZSM-5 Catalysts
Abstract
H-ZSM-5 zeolite-supported Ga (Ga/H-ZSM-5) has been considered as a selective catalyst for nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for decades; however, the reaction mechanism remains a topic of considerable discussion. In particular, the correlation between various Ga species present on the catalyst at the reaction conditions and the PDH activity has yet to be established. In this work, intrinsic PDH rates and activation energies were determined on Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with a wide range of Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios. The turnover frequency on Ga+H+ pair sites in the PDH is higher than that of isolated Ga+ sites by a factor of 15. Experimental measurements combined with a dual-site model show the activation energy in the PDH on the Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites to be 90.8  1.5 and 117  4.7 kJ·mol1, respectively. These results demonstrate that Ga+H+ pair sites are much more active in the PDH than isolated Ga+ sites. The activation energy of GaHx decomposition to form H2 was determined to be 4060 kJ·mol1 higher than that of the PDH on Ga species, suggesting that the GaHx decomposition is unlikely to be part of the PDH mechanism. Although both Brnsted acid and Ga sites interact with propane, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results provide strong evidence suggesting that the alkyl mechanism is more likely in the PDH on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The increasing demand for propylene and an abundant supply of propane in shale gas have led to a resurgence in interest in the direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction. (17) Catalysts employed in the two commercial PDH processes, i.e., supported PtSn for the Oleflex process and CrOx/Al2O3 for the Catofin process, suffer from either high cost and fast deactivation or undesirable environmental impacts, (1) which incentivizes the search for alternative catalysts. A large number of catalysts have been investigated, including Ga-based, (816) V-based, (1720) Zn-based, (21,22) Co-based, (2325) Fe-based, (2628) In-based, (29) Zr-based, (3032) and nanocarbon catalysts. (33,34) H-ZSM-5 zeolite-supported Ga (Ga/H-ZSM-5) has been considered as not only a promising PDH catalyst for its high selectivity but also an effective catalyst in propane dehydroaromatization (the Cyclar process). (33,34)
Despite the extensive literature on Ga/H-ZSM-5, the determination of active species and the mechanism in the PDH reaction remain topics of considerable discussion. Earlier studies by Iglesia and coworkers proposed that the Brnsted acid sites (BAS) on H-ZSM-5-activated propane and Ga species acted as portholes to remove H atoms produced in the PDH in the form of H2 (carbenium mechanism). (35,36) The applicability of this mechanism was later extended to Co/H-ZSM-5 and Zn/H-ZSM-5 systems. (3739) Hensen and coworkers employed diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to demonstrate the replacement of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) by gallium after reduction at high temperature and the formation of GaHx including Ga dihydride (2041 cm1) and Ga monohydride (2059 cm1) and suggested that GaHx plays an important role in PDH. (4042) They further proposed exchanged Ga species in the zeolite as the sites that activate alkanes to form the corresponding adsorbed alkyl species (alkyl mechanism) based on the observation of Ga-C2H5 and GaHx. (43) This theory was supported by later experimental and computational results. (44,45) Several more recent reports hypothesized that the proximity of BAS and Ga species is a relevant factor in determining the PDH activity of Ga species. Lercher and coworkers (46) reported that Ga+H+ pair sites possessed higher activity than isolated Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5. Bell and coworkers (47) proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites were the active centers of the PDH reaction, and the catalysts reactivity normalized by [GaH]2+ sites was independent of the Ga/Al ratio. Several factors contribute to the difficulty in elucidating the PDH mechanism on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts: (1) The elevated temperature (500 C) at which the PDH reaction takes place makes detection of reaction intermediates challenging, and mechanistic hypotheses are based largely on computational insights. (2) Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with a single Si/Al ratio are typically employed in a given work to draw mechanistic conclusions, which relies on an implicit and largely unsubstantiated assumption that the reaction mechanism and active sites are independent of the Si/Al ratio. Different research groups tend to use samples with different Si/Al ratios, which makes direct comparisons difficult. (3) Catalysts are typically characterized ex situ, at conditions at which Ga speciation could be significantly different from Ga speciation at PDH conditions. In a recent work, we thoroughly characterized Ga/H-ZSM-5 with varying Si/Al ratios (15, 28, and 39) and Ga/Al ratios (01.7), with in situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy. (48) We showed that the density of Ga+H+ pair sites could be correlated with GaHx bands on Ga/H-ZSM-5 reduced at 550 C and determined stoichiometric factors in the exchange between Ga+ and BAS during the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5. These insights pave the way for understanding the correlation between the formation of unique Ga species and their PDH activity.
In this work, we determined the turnover frequencies (TOF) and activation energies of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites in the PDH on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with varying Si/Al ratios (15, 28, and 39) and Ga/Al ratios (01.7). Ga+H+ pair sites are more active in the PDH than isolated Ga+ sites by a factor of 15, and the activation energy of the PDH on the former is 26 kJ·mol1 lower than the latter. This is the first rigorous determination of intrinsic PDH activity on these two Ga species. (47) Activation energies of GaHx decomposition on these samples were also determined in the absence and presence of C3H8. C3H8 is shown to accelerate the decomposition of GaHx, suggesting its intimate interaction with the sites capable of forming the hydride species. The activation energy of GaHx decomposition is 4060 kJ·mol1 higher than that of the PDH on Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites, suggesting against GaHx decomposition as part of the PDH mechanism. Further in situ FTIR results provide evidence supporting the alkyl mechanism.

Catalyst Preparation and Characterizations
NH4-ZSM-5 samples (Zeolyst, CBV 3024E, CBV 5524G, and CBV 8014) were calcined at 550 C for 8 h in flowing air with a ramp rate of 2 C·min1 to obtain the H-ZSM-5 with varying Si/Al ratios. The Si/Al ratios of the samples determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF, Rigaku WDXRF) were 15.4  1.3, 27.5  1.9, and 39.0  2.8. Incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of gallium(III) nitrate hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to prepare Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with varying Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios. Ga/MFI (8 wt % Ga), Ga/SiO2 (2.2 wt % Ga), and Ga/Al2O3 (8 wt % Ga) were prepared by the same method with siliceous MFI prepared according to a previous report, (49) SiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, silica gel davisil, grade 646), and Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar), respectively. Ga2O3 was obtained by calcining gallium(III) nitrate hydrate at 600 C in flowing air for 2 h with a ramp rate of 5 C·min1. The obtained Ga2O3 is dominated by the γ phase, as confirmed by XRD measurement on a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA). Micropore volumes of the samples (Table S1) were determined by N2 adsorption at 196 C and the t-plot method. N2 adsorption isotherms were collected on a Micromeritics 3Flex system. All samples were degassed for 24 h at 300 C prior to the adsorption measurements. The surface area of the Ga2O3 sample was determined to be 80 m2·g1 via the BET method. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected on an Agilent CARY 660 spectrometer equipped with an mercurycadmiumtelluride detector. Typical spectra presented are 128 coadded scans per spectrum at a spectral resolution of 2 cm1. Spectra for kinetic analysis are 32 coadded scans to improve the temporal resolution. Chemicals such as H2, C3H8, and C3H6 were introduced into the transmission cell, and pressure was controlled via the vacuum manifold. The detailed description of the preparation and characterization of these samples is shown in ref (48).
Catalytic Performance
Catalytic reactions were performed in a fixed-bed plug flow reactor with a 1/4 inch quartz glass tube. The catalyst bed typically contained 3.815 mg of the catalyst with a particle size range of 2040 mesh. Catalysts were diluted with SiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, silica gel davisil, grade 646) with a 1:3 mass ratio. A thermocouple was placed directly above the catalyst bed inside the reactor tube to ensure accurate temperature measurement. The thermocouple has no detectable catalytic activity at the reaction temperature. Prior to the catalytic activity measurements, the catalyst was heated to 550 C for 30 min with a ramp rate of 10 C·min1 in 10 vol % H2 with balancing N2 (20 mL·min1) followed by purging with N2 at the same temperature. The reduced sample was then exposed to 5 vol % C3H8 with balancing N2. The total pressure was maintained at 101.32 kPa. Gas flow rates were adjusted in the range of 20100 mL·min1 to vary the space times, which was defined as molAl·s·molC3H81 for Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples and gCat·s·molC3H81 for Ga supported on different supports. The reactor effluent was periodically sampled using an online gas chromatograph (GC) (Agilent 7890A), via a heated gas line, equipped with a Rt-Q-BOND column and a flame ionization detector (FID) used for product analysis. FID response factors for CH4, C2H4, C3H6, and C3H8 were calibrated prior to the activity measurements. The conversion of C3H8 was determined using eq 1, and the selectivity and yield of CH4, C2H4, and C3H6 were obtained using eqs 2 and 3.

where i represents the hydrocarbon products CH4, C2H4, and C3H6 in the effluent gas, ni is the number of carbon atoms of component i, and Fi is the molar flow rate. The C3H8 conversion was measured at differential conversions (<5.5%). PDH rates were determined based on the C3H6 yields, and C3H8 cracking rates were determined by the CH4 and C2H4 yields. Testing the catalyst under low C3H8 conversion limited secondary reactions, which was confirmed by the equimolar formation of CH4 and C2H4 derived from the cracking reaction when product selectivity was extrapolated to zero space time. PDH and cracking rates over Ga/H-ZSM-5 were normalized to the Al content of the catalyst. Apparent activation energies were determined in the temperature range of 530570 C. Deactivation was below 5% after 12 h time on stream in all cases. The carbon balance (eq 4) in all experiments was higher than 97%.

Dependence of PDH Rates on Si/Al Ratios and Ga/Al Ratios
PDH rates were measured on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with varying Si/Al ratios (15, 28, and 39) and Ga/Al ratios (01.7). Numerous studies have reported PDH on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a variety of Si/Al ratios and Ga/Al ratios; however, the reactivity and kinetics were measured at different conditions and on samples prepared by different methods, making direct comparisons difficult. (46,47,5052) In this work, all Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples were prepared via impregnation followed by calcination. These catalysts have been thoroughly characterized in our recent report, (48) and their key properties are summarized in Tables S1 and S2 of the Supporting Information. Calcined catalysts were reduced in 10 vol % H2 for 30 min at 550 C prior to the introduction of 5 vol % C3H8 (5.07 kPa with balancing N2).
PDH rates were measured in the kinetic regime, as confirmed by the linear correlation between the propane conversion/product yield (C3H6, C2H4, and CH4) and the catalyst loading at 550 and 570 C (Figure S1). (47) Rates and selectivities are determined by extrapolating to zero space time (Figure S2) in order to eliminate the impact of product inhibition and secondary reactions. (47) Stable conversion and good carbon balances were observed during the first 10 h time on stream (TOS) on all catalysts (Figure S3). The selectivity for C3H6 increases with decreasing space time, the selectivity for C2H4 decreases on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15 and Ga/Al = 0.21), and the selectivity for CH4 remains constant (Figure S2a). At zero space time, the selectivity toward C2H4 is close to twice that of CH4 (on a per carbon atom basis, eq 2), which is consistent with the stoichiometry of C3H8 cracking into C2H4 and CH4. (47,53) PDH rates extrapolated to zero space time on a per Al basis (referred to as TOFAl) over Ga/H-ZSM-5 with various Ga/Al and Si/Al ratios are shown in Figure 1a. Rates are expressed in terms of TOFAl to allow for fair comparison among samples with the same Si/Al ratio, which will be converted to rates normalized to specific Ga species later on in this work. On samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15, as the Ga/Al ratio increases, the TOFAl increases rapidly with the Ga loading up to the Ga/Al ratio of 0.05 and then increases more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3 before declining with the further addition of Ga (Figure 1a). This trend is in general agreement with the results reported by Bell and coworkers, (47,53) in which Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al of 16.5 was employed. TOFAl peaks at a value of 34.0 × 103 molC3H8·molAl1·s1 at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.31, which is 16 times higher than that on the parent H-ZSM-5 (2.1 × 103 molC3H8·molAl1·s1). The large difference between the PDH rates on Ga/H-ZSM-5 and H-ZSM-5 indicates that the contribution to the overall PDH activity from the residual BAS in Ga/H-ZSM-5 is minor. A much higher enhancement in the PDH rate (by a factor of 500) after the introduction of Ga to H-ZSM-5 was reported by Bell and coworkers; (47) this disparity could be attributed to the differences in the reaction conditions, e.g., the reaction temperature (460 C vs 550 C). A similar 3-segment dependence of the PDH rate on the Ga/Al ratio was observed on samples with a Si/Al ratio of 28 (Figure 1a). TOFAl on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 39 increases almost linearly up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.55, before declining at higher Ga/Al ratios (Figure 1a). The result is consistent with the trend reported by Lercher and coworkers, in which Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with a Si/Al ratio of 50 were employed. (46) Importantly, Figure 1 shows that TOFAl depends not only on the Ga/Al ratio, but it is also sensitive to the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite. This implies that a mechanistic interpretation of reactivity on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with a single Si/Al ratio is unlikely to be complete.

Reaction conditions: 550 C; C3H8 partial pressure, 5.07 kPa with balancing N2. The propane conversions are below 5.5% in the rate measurements.
A more quantitative analysis of the impact of the Si/Al ratio and the Ga/Al ratio of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts on the PDH rates reveals two types of active sites. The low Ga/Al range of Figure 1a is replotted in Figure 1b for further analysis: on samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15, the slope of the TOFAl versus the Ga/Al ratio at Ga/Al ratios below 0.042 is fitted to be 0.597  0.091 molC3H8·molGa1·s1 (Figure 1b). This slope represents the TOF of the PDH on a per Ga increment basis, referred to as TOFGa, which could be viewed as the intrinsic PDH activity of a small amount of Ga added in a given range of Ga/Al ratios. TOFGa decreases to 0.039  0.011 in the Ga/Al range of 0.042 to 0.21, which is smaller than that in the lower Ga/Al range by a factor of 15. This drastic change in the TOFGa implies that additional Ga introduced at in the Ga/Al ratio of 0.042 to 0.21 exists in a different state from that introduced to samples with the lower Ga/Al ratios, i.e., two types of Ga sites with distinct PDH activities are present. Similarly, for Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with a Si/Al ratio of 28, TOFGa are determined to be 0.223  0.031 and 0.041  0.021 molC3H8·molGa1·s1 in the Ga/Al ratio range of 00.15 and 0.150.46, respectively. The reduction in the TOFGa at the higher Ga/Al ratio range (by a factor of 7) on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 28) is lower than that on the Al-rich samples (Si/Al = 15). On samples with a Si/Al ratio of 39, TOFGa is low (0.045  0.005 molC3H8·molGa1·s1) from the lowest Ga loading evaluated (Figure 1b). A striking feature of TOFGa values is that they are similar (0.0390.045 molC3H8·molGa1·s1) for Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with Si/Al ratios of 15 (0.042 < Ga/Al < 0.21) and 28 (0.15 < Ga/Al < 0.44) after the initial rapid rise and the sample with a Si/Al ratio of 39 at Ga/Al ratios below 0.55 (Figure 1b). It can be inferred that within these Ga/Al ratio ranges, increasing the Ga loading introduces the same type of active site in the PDH in all samples. For samples with lower Si/Al ratios (15 and 28), a much more active Ga species is present at very low Ga loadings. Control experiments on unsupported Ga2O3, Ga2O3 supported on siliceous MFI (Ga/MFI), and Ga2O3 supported on Al2O3 (Ga/Al2O3) show much lower PDH activities compared with H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Figure S4). This shows that the fraction of Ga2O3 in Ga/H-ZSM-5 that does not diffuse into zeolite pores during reduction has a negligible contribution to the PDH rate. Similar trends are observed in the C3H8 cracking rates (Figure S5a). (47) The ratio between the PDH and cracking rates increases monotonically with the Ga/Al ratio on all Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples investigated (Figure S5b), that is, higher amounts of exchanged Ga favor the dehydrogenation pathway, while BAS promotes the cracking of C3H8, in agreement with a previous study. (46)
The observed reactivity trends on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with different Si/Al ratios and Ga/Al ratios suggest that Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites are the active species in the PDH. Our recent report provided strong evidence for two distinct Ga species, i.e., Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites, on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with distinct abilities to form GaHx (a combination of GaH2 and GaH, with the former being the dominant species) at 550 C after H2 treatment. (48) GaHx species were probed by in situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy, and their abundance was monitored via the integrated area of the corresponding band. The extinction coefficients for these GaHx species remain unknown, and thus, only their relative abundance, at different Ga/Al ratios rather than absolute densities, can be determined. The dependence of GaHx densities on Si/Al ratios and Ga/Al ratios have been reported in our previous report, (48) which is incorporated in Figure 2a. Importantly, the transition points from rapid to a more gradual rise in the density of the GaHx species with an increasing Ga/Al ratio in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratios of both 15 and 28 coincide with those of the TOFGa, at Ga/Al ratios of 0.074 and 0.15, respectively (Figure 2a). This is a clear indication that the changes in Ga speciation and the TOFGa are correlated. The slope of the Al normalized peak area of the GaHx band (AGaHx) versus the Ga/Al ratio (Figure 2a), referred to as SGaHx, represents the Ga normalized peak area of GaHx with the unit of AGaHx·molGa1. SGaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratios of 15 and 28 are determined to be 23  1.8 × 103 and 8.7  0.9 × 103AGaHx·molGa1, respectively, at Ga/Al ratios equal to or below 0.1. SGaHx/TOFGa ratios of Ga/H-ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratios of 15 and 28 agree almost quantitatively (3.8 × 104 and 3.9 × 104, respectively, Figure 2b). This observation further confirms the strong correlation between the Ga species propensity to form GaHx and the PDH activity at low Ga/Al ratios (0.1). In our previous report, we established that the Ga species capability of forming GaHx upon H2 treatment at 550 C was dependent on the proximity of Ga+ sites with neighboring BAS, i.e., Ga+H+ pair or isolated Ga+ sites. (48) It follows that the relative concentrations of these two types of Ga species are likely responsible for the different dependence of the TOFGa on the Ga/Al ratio (Figure 1). We have shown that Ga+ preferentially exchanges with one H+ in proton pairs to form Ga+H+ pair sites at low Ga loadings. (48) Thus, the observed PDH rates on the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts investigated (Figure 1) could be rationalized as follows: On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15), only Ga+H+ pair sites are initially produced during the reduction of the calcined catalyst due to the abundance of paired protons on the Al-rich zeolite at Ga/Al ratios below 0.042; these sites display high PDH rates. In the Ga/Al ratio range of 0.0420.21, only isolated Ga+ sites are introduced as the Ga loading increases (Scheme 1a), which is less active in the PDH reaction. Increasing the Ga/Al ratio further beyond 0.21 leads to the replacement of the protons present in Ga+H+ pair sites with Ga+ to form relatively inactive Ga+Ga+ pair sites, leading to a further decrease in the TOFGa. On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 28), the lower density of proton pairs, as compared to that on the Al-rich sample, leads to the formation of both Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites even at low Ga/Al ratios (00.15), and thus, TOFGa is lower than that on samples with only Ga+H+ pair sites. In the Ga/Al ratio range of 0.150.52, only isolated Ga+ sites are introduced with an increasing Ga loading, leading to a similar TOFGa to that on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) in the Ga/Al ratio range of 0.042 and 0.21. The decline in the TOFGa at Ga/Al ratios above 0.52 could also be rationalized by the replacement of Ga+H+ pair sites with less active Ga+Ga+ pair sites. The lack of proton pairs in the Al-lean Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples (Si/Al = 39) can only generate isolated Ga+ sites from the lowest Ga/Al ratio tested. The decrease in TOFGa at Ga/Al ratio increases above 0.55 on these samples cannot be explained by the formation of Ga+Ga+ pair sites due to the lack of Ga+H+ pair sites to start with (Scheme 1b). One possible explanation is that Ga oligomers are formed as suggested by Bell and coworkers, (52) which are less active than isolated Ga+ sites.

Apparent Activation Energy Measurements and Modeling
Activation energy measurements confirm that the apparent activation energy (Eapp) of the PDH on the Ga+H+ pair sites is lower than that on the isolated Ga+ sites. Apparent activation energies were determined based on the PDH rates on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 by varying the reaction temperature in the range of 530570 C. On H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15), the Eapp of the PDH was determined to be 188 kJ·mol1 (Figure 3a), a value consistent with the literature. (47) The Eapp decreases to 89.4 kJ·mol1 when the Ga/Al ratio is increased to 0.13, showing that a small amount of Ga can effectively reduce the Eapp. (46,47) This is consistent with the significantly enhanced PDH rate upon introducing Ga to H-ZSM-5 (Figure 1), as well as results reported by Bell and coworkers. (47) A further increase in the Ga/Al ratio up to 1.7 leads to a gradual increase in the Eapp, indicating the formation of less active Ga species with the increase in the Ga loading (Scheme 1a). The Eapp achieves a value of 127 kJ·mol1 at Ga/Al ratios of 1.7. A similar trend is observed for Ga/H-ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratios of 28. The Eapp for Ga/H-ZSM-5(Si/Al = 28) decreases from 166 to 110 kJ·mol1 as the Ga/Al ratio increases from 0 to 0.15, before rising again to 126 kJ·mol1 with a further increase in the Ga/Al ratio (Figure 3a). On Ga/H-ZSM-5(Si/Al = 39), the measured Eapp decreases from 156 to 113 kJ·mol1 as the Ga/Al ratio increases from 0 to 0.55, before gradually leveling off at 129 kJ·mol1 at a Ga/Al ratio of 1.7. The Eapp on H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39) is in agreement with the value reported by van Bokhoven and coworkers. (54) Also consistent with the literature, the Eapp (156 kJ·mol1) of the BAS on H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al =39) is lower than that on the Al-rich zeolite. (55) Three features of the dependence of the Eapp on the Ga/Al ratio are worth noting (Figure 3a): (1) the minimum Eapp on Ga/H-ZSM-5 increases with the Si/Al ratio, (2) the minimum Eapp occurs at an increasingly higher Ga/Al ratio as the Si/Al ratio rises, and (3) at the highest Ga/Al ratio tested (1.7), all tested catalysts exhibit nearly the same Eapp regardless of Si/Al ratio. The initial decrease in the Eapp as the Ga/Al ratio increases at low Ga loadings is attributed to the introduction of more active sites in the PDH than the BAS in H-ZSM-5, i.e., Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites. The observation that the value of the minimum Eapp increases with the Si/Al ratio in the parent H-ZSM-5 indicates that the Ga-based active sites introduced are less active at higher Si/Al ratios. This interpretation agrees with the hypothesis that the more active Ga+H+ pair sites are more abundant in Al-rich zeolites and the less active isolated Ga+ sites are more prevalent in samples with higher Si/Al ratios. The increasing Ga/Al ratio at which the minimum Eapp is reached as the Si/Al ratio in the parent H-ZSM-5 increases could be rationalized by a similar line of reasoning as above. For Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15), the minimum Eapp is expected to be on the catalyst with the highest density of the Ga+H+ pair sites, which occurs at relatively low Ga/Al ratios (0.05). Only isolated Ga+ sites are present on Ga/H-ZSM-5(Si/Al = 39) at low Ga loadings, which explains the slow reduction in the Eapp with the Ga loading as BAS in the zeolite are gradually replaced by isolated Ga+ sites. The Eapp on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39) does not increase substantially at Ga/Al ratios above 0.5 (Figure 3a) because active sites for the PDH remain the isolated Ga+ sites, and the proposed Ga oligomers are reported to be inactive. (47) The Eapp trend on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 28) versus the Ga/Al ratio could be rationalized by the coexistence of BAS, Ga+H+ pair sites, and isolated Ga+ sites. The fact that the Eapp at high Ga/Al ratios converges to a similar value suggests that all samples are dominated by a similar type of Ga site, e.g., Ga oligomers.

The inset in (b) shows the Eapp of the Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites in the PDH on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with Si/Al ratios of 15 and 39 and Ga/Al ratios from 0 to 0.042 and 0 to 0.55, respectively. The propane conversions are below 5.5% in the rate measurements.
A simple dual-site model based on the reasoning above bas been constructed to more quantitatively understand the dependence of the Eapp on the Ga/Al ratio. On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) with Ga/Al ratios  0.042, we assume that there are only two types of active sties in the PDH, i.e., BAS and Ga+H+ pair sites, as proposed above. (48) The Eapp can be expressed as eq 5 below
(5)
where x1 and x2 represent the ratio of the remaining BAS to Al amount and the Ga/Al ratio, respectively. The sum of x1 and x2 is the ratio of the BAS density to the Al density of the parent zeolite, which was determined in our recent work (Table S1). (48) The value of x2 is an experimentally controlled variable, which is used to determine x1. TOF1 and TOF2 represent the measured BAS-normalized and Ga-normalized PDH rates, respectively (Figure 1). For Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al =15 and Ga/Al  0.042), there are two types of active sites, i.e., BAS and Ga+H+ pair sites. TOFGa+H+ is assumed to be equal to TOFGa (0.597  0.091 molC3H8·molGa1·s1) based on the 1:1 stoichiometry in the exchange between the BAS and Ga+ on these samples determined in our recent work. (48)Ea1 and Ea2 represent the activation energy on the BAS and the Ga+H+ pair sites, respectively. Details of the model including derivations are described in the Supporting Information (Text S1 and Table S3). Ea1 is experimentally determined to be 188 kJ·mol1 on H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15), and the activation energy on Ga+H+ pair sites (Ea2) could be obtained by fitting Eapp at Ga/Al  0.042 (Figure 3b), which is 90.8  1.5 kJ·mol1. This value is within the experimental errors identical to the lowest Eapp determined on samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15 (89.4 kJ·mol1).
A similar strategy is applied to the PDH rates measured on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al =39) to determine the activation of isolated Ga+ sites in the PDH. Our previous work showed that exchanged gallium exists largely in the form of isolated Ga+ sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39). (48) Thus, we assume that there are two types of active sites in the PDH at Ga/Al  0.55: BAS and isolated Ga+ sites. TOFGa+ is assumed to equal TOFGa/60% (0.075  0.008 molC3H8·molGa1·s1) at Ga/Al ratios below 0.55 based on a 0.6:1 stoichiometry in Ga exchange on these samples (60% Ga atoms introduced exchanged with BAS to form Ga+). (48) Using the dual-site model described above, the activation energy associated with isolated Ga+ sites is fitted to be 117  4.7 kJ·mol1 (Figure 3b and Table S3). The higher fitted activation energy for the isolated Ga+ sites than that of Ga+H+ pair sites is consistent with the mechanism proposed in Scheme 1.
On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al =28, Ga/Al  0.52), a triple-site model is employed to fit the measured Eapp because BAS, Ga+H+ pair sites, and isolated Ga+ sites coexist at low Ga/Al ratios. The activation energies on all three types of sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 28) have been determined either by direct measurements (BAS, 166 kJ·mol1) or fitting using the dual-site model on Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with low and high Si/Al ratios. The fraction of the exchanged Ga in the forms of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites can be determined based on stoichiometry (eqs S6S8, details are provided in Text S1). The fractions of three types of active sites at different Ga/Al ratios  0.52 are plotted Figure 4a (data included in Table S4), with the BAS (x1) and the isolated Ga+ sites (x3) decreasing and increasing monotonically, respectively. Meanwhile, the fraction of Ga+H+ pair sites (x2) increases initially before dropping after Ga/Al > 0.2. The activation energy can be simulated with eq S9 (Text S1 and Table S4) by assuming a typical 15% experimental uncertainty (Figure 4b, shaded area). All experimentally determined Eapp values on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al of 28 (Ga/Al  0.52) are located in the shaded area, indicating the reliability of the estimated activation energies for Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites. This supports the three types of active sties identified in the PDH on Ga/H-ZSM-5. No attempt to extend the model to a fourth type of site, e.g., Ga+Ga+ or Ga oligomers, at higher Ga/Al ratios was made because of the lack of independent determination of Eapp for this type of site.

Interaction of GaHx with Propane and Propylene
Since the first report of GaHx species by Hensen and coworkers, (41) these species have been proposed to play a number of different roles in the PDH, e.g., a reaction intermediate and an active site. (43,46,47,50,56) However, experimental evidence regarding the interaction between GaHx and propane and propylene has been scarce. (44) In situ FTIR spectroscopy was employed to investigate the effect of C3H8 on GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 at reaction temperature. After reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 0.13) at 550 C with H2, IR bands attributable to Ga monohydride (2053 cm1) and Ga dihydride (2037 cm1) appear (Figure 5b(i)), as previously reported, (41,48,57) which were supported by DFT calculations by Bell and coworkers. (56) Upon introduction of C3H8 (0.27 kPa) to the transmission cell at the same temperature, peaks attributable to gas-phase C3H8 (28503000 cm1) are detected (Figure 5a(ii)), which agrees with bands detected in a control experiment (Figure S6). The GaHx bands gradually diminish and largely disappear within 10 min (Figure 5b(vi)). The intensity of C3H8 bands also decreases over time (Figure 5a), indicating that C3H8 is gradually consumed in its dehydrogenation (the transmission cell is sealed after dosing C3H8, as in a batch reactor). Moreover, two peaks centered at 3015 and 3055 cm1 appear and become more intense over time. These two peaks do not match those of the gas phase of C3H8 or C3H6 (Figure S7), suggesting that they likely originate from reaction intermediates. A control experiment in which C3H6 (0.27 kPa) was introduced to a reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15 and Ga/Al = 0.13) at 550 C showed the 3055 cm1 band with only weak bands corresponding to gas-phase C3H6 (Figure S8a). In contrast, only gas-phase C3H6 bands appeared when C3H6 was introduced to H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) at the same temperature (Figure S8b). These observations suggest that the 3055 cm1 band can be attributed to C3H6 adsorbed on Ga species. Thus, the gradual increase in the intensity of the 3055 cm1 band with time upon introduction of C3H8 indicates that C3H6 is produced via dehydrogenation on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Figure 5a). The appearance of the 3015 cm1 band upon introduction of C3H8 to reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 is likely to be attributed to the formation of reaction intermediates as this peak does not match those of gas-phase C3H8 or C3H6 and is not observed upon the introduction of C3H6 to reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Figures S6 and S7). Upon evacuation, the GaHx bands do not change appreciably, but all hydrocarbon bands in the CH stretching region disappear (Figure 5a,b(vii)), suggesting a weaker interaction with the catalyst surface than the hydride species. As expected, increasing the C3H8 pressure to 1.33 kPa leads to faster accumulation of bands corresponding to reaction intermediates and products (3015 and 3055 cm1) and less remaining GaHx (Figure S9(vii)). In contrast, the GaHx bands largely remain unchanged after 10 min in vacuum, with the integrated peak area only decreasing by about 50% within 30 min (Figure 5c), showing that the presence of C3H8 significantly accelerates the decomposition of GaHx. We observed a similar phenomenon on samples with different Ga/Al ratios (Figures S9c,d and S10). Control experiments rule out the possible influence of water vapor in the evacuated cell on the spectra based on the lack of the Ga(OH)x band at 3662 cm1 (Figure S11). The lack of GaHx bands observed on Ga/Si-MFI and Ga/SiO2 samples (Figure S12) suggests that extraframework Ga species do not impact the spectral assignment in this work. Extraframework Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, if present, are expected to resemble those on Ga/Si-MFI and Ga/SiO2 and thus do not contribute to the GaHx bands observed on Ga/H-ZSM-5. In addition, GaHx bands on bulk Ga2O3 and Ga/Al2O3 appear at significantly lower wavenumbers (1996 and 1992 cm1 for GaHx collected at 550 C on bulk Ga2O3 and Ga/Al2O3, respectively, Figure S12). The lack of these lower wavenumber bands on Ga/H-ZSM-5 suggests that bulk Ga2O3 does not exist on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5.

The background spectrum is collected in the spectral cell with a dehydrated sample pellet at 550 C under vacuum.
Propane promotion of the decomposition of GaHx is also supported by kinetic measurements, in which the decomposition rate of GaHx is determined via transmission FTIR spectroscopy. On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15 and Ga/Al = 0.042), the GaHx consumption rate is determined by the fraction of decomposed GaHx within 10 min under vacuum or 2 min in 0.27 kPa of C3H8 (or C3H6) in the temperature range of 530570 C. The apparent activation energies of GaHx decomposition are 175  16, 150  15, and 107  9.9 kJ·mol1 under vacuum, in C3H8, and in C3H6, respectively (Figure 6a). We note that Eapp is extracted by the Arrhenius equation, which only requires knowledge relative to, rather than absolute, decomposition rates of GaHx. The reduction of Eapp by 25 kJ·mol1 confirms that the presence of C3H8 promotes the decomposition of GaHx. The lower Eapp observed in cases in which C3H6 is present suggests that C3H6 is more effective in facilitating GaHx decomposition. This is consistent with the observation of an IR band (3055 cm1) corresponding to adsorbed C3H6 on Ga sites (Figure 5a), without a corresponding band for adsorbed C3H8. This could be rationalized by the stronger interaction between Ga sites and the CC bond in C3H6 than the saturated bonds in C3H8. (58) The promotional effect of C3H8 on GaHx decomposition indicates that C3H8 intimately interacts with the types of sites capable of forming GaHx, i.e., Ga+H+ pair sites. Similar GaHx decomposition activation energies were determined in the same conditions on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) with Ga/Al ratios of 0.13 and 0.31 (Figure 6b,c). This is consistent with the hypothesis that the GaHx species observed via IR are only present on the Ga+H+ pair sites at 550 C, as only the density, rather than the structure, of the GaHx species varies on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) with different Ga loadings.

The GaHx decomposition rate is determined by % decomposed GaHx during 10 min under vacuum or 2 min under 0.27 kPa propane or 2 min under 0.27 kPa propylene.
Interaction of BAS with Propane and Propylene
FTIR spectroscopy shows that a fraction of BAS on Ga/H-ZSM-5 is consumed in the presence of C3H8 and C3H6. The band at 3591 cm1 assigned to BAS decreases in intensity upon introducing 0.27 kPa of C3H8 to Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 0.13) at 550 C, which is clearly shown as a negative band in the spectra using a spectrum collected prior to propane dosage as the background (Figure 7a, original spectra are included in Figure S13). This is clear evidence of C3H8 interacting with BAS at the reaction temperature. The negative band disappears upon evacuation of propane, suggesting a dynamic, rather than irreversible, interaction between propane and BAS, e.g., formation of carbenium ions. (59,60) A similar negative band is observed upon introducing C3H6 (Figure 7b), which can be similarly attributed to the BAS-C3H6 interaction. No decrease in the BAS band intensity is observed upon introduction of H2 to the same Ga/H-ZSM-5 sample at 550 C, confirming that the negative band stems from the interaction between hydrocarbons and BAS. A decrease in the BAS band intensity was also observed when C3H8 and C3H6 were introduced to H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) at 550 C (Figure 7c,d), indicating that the BAS-hydrocarbon interaction does not depend on the presence of Ga species. Similar observations were made on Ga/H-ZSM-5 and H-ZSM-5 samples with different Ga/Al ratios and hydrocarbon partial pressures (Figures S14S18).

Propane Dehydrogenation Mechanism on Ga+H+ Pair Sites
To date, proposed PDH mechanisms on Ga/H-ZSM-5 can be largely categorized into the alkyl mechanism and the carbenium mechanism. (35,36,46,47) The key difference between these mechanisms is the identity of sites on which C3H8 is activated: C3H8 is considered to be activated on Ga species to form a Ga alkyl intermediate in the alkyl mechanism, (46,47) while the carbenium mechanism argues that C3H8 is initially activated on the BAS to form a carbenium ion with Ga facilitating the recombination of H atoms to form H2. (35,36) The in situ FTIR spectroscopic results presented above show that propane interacts both with Ga species and BAS, which do not readily rule out either mechanism. However, detailed analysis suggests that the alkyl mechanism is more likely. If the primary function of Ga species in the PDH is to facilitate the evolution of H2, then the Eapp of the PDH is expected to be dominated by the decomposition of GaHx. This is inconsistent with the higher Eapp determined for GaHx decomposition in the presence of propane than that of the PDH on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (150 kJ·mol1 vs 90 kJ·mol1, as shown in Figures 6 and 3, respectively), indicating that the recombination of hydrogen atoms on GaHx to form H2 is not part of the PDH mechanism.
IR spectra of adsorbed intermediates provide further evidence supporting the alkyl mechanism. Due to the relatively weak interactions between hydrocarbons and the active sites of interest and high temperature, no detectable hydrocarbon intermediate is present upon evacuation of the propane-treated Ga/H-ZSM-5 sample at 550 C (Figure 5a). Introducing C3H8 to reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 at high temperature and then cooling in the presence of C3H8 were employed as a strategy to preserve adsorbed reaction intermediates for spectral detection at a lower temperature (150 C). On H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15), after exposure to C3H8 at 550 C before quickly cooling to 150 C followed by evacuation, four peaks centered at 2976, 2937, 2903, and 2878 cm1 were present (Figure 8a(i)): these peaks have been assigned to antisymmetric CH3, antisymmetric CH2, symmetric CH3, and symmetric CH2 stretching modes, respectively. (63,64,64) These peaks could correspond to a reaction intermediate associated with BAS formed during the cooling process, which remains adsorbed at 150 C after evacuation. On Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 0.042 and 0.13), three peaks distinct from those on H-ZSM-5 centered at 2966, 2931, and 2874 cm1 were detected with similar procedures (Figure 8a(ii,iii)). These three new peaks have been assigned to antisymmetric CH3, antisymmetric CH2, and symmetric CH2 stretching modes, respectively. (6163) No hydrocarbon bands are present on H-ZSM-5 or Ga/H-ZSM-5 after evacuation when propane is introduced at 150 C, indicating that these adsorbed hydrocarbons originate from C3H8s interaction with catalytic sites at higher temperatures. This is in agreement with the Ga-methyl species detected by 13C solid-state NMR spectroscopy during CH4 treatment on Ga/H-ZSM-5 at 300550 C. (64) The distinct CH stretching bands on H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5 show that different adsorbed intermediates are present on these two catalysts.

FTIR spectra of C3H8 treatment on (a,b) Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) with Ga/Al ratios of (i) 0, (ii) 0.042, and (iii) 0.13 and (c,d) Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39) with Ga/Al ratios of (i) 0, (ii) 0.12, and (iii) 0.44. Black and red traces represent spectra on the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 cooled down from 550 to 150 C under 1.33 kPa C3H8 followed by evacuating the cell and under vacuum, respectively. The background spectrum is collected in the spectral cell with a sample pellet dehydrated at 550 C and cooled down to 150 C under vacuum.
The relative intensity of the GaH and GaH2 infrared bands provides additional mechanistic insights. As expected, no GaHx band is present on H-ZSM-5 (Figure 8b(i)), while both GaH and GaH2 bands appear at 150 C on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Figure 8b(ii,iii), black traces). The GaH band is the more intense feature on the C3H8-treated sample, while the GaH2 band is more prominent on H2-treated Ga/H-ZSM-5 at 150 C (Figure 8b(ii,iii), red traces). It could be inferred that the hydrocarbon intermediate is more effective in displacing/consuming GaH2 than GaH. The lack of the Ga(OH)x band at 3672 cm1 at 150 C confirms the negligible effect of any trace amount of water in the evacuated cell on these spectra (Figure S19). Heating leads to the desorption of the adsorbed hydrocarbon species on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 0.13) from 150 to 350 C, while the GaHx bands remain until 500 C (Figure S20). This is consistent with the observation of a [Ga3+(H)(C2H5)]+ species by Hensen and coworkers when heating reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 in the presence of ethane to 250 C. (42) Similar phenomena were observed on H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 39 (Figure 8c,d). The lack of CH stretching bands on H-ZSM-5 could be due to the low Al density in this sample.
A number of mechanistic deductions can be made based on the spectral results (Scheme 2). C3H8 can be activated at BAS, isolated Ga+ sites, and Ga+  H+ pair sites, though the resulting intermediates are different on BAS and Ga species. We hypothesize that carbenium ions are formed on the BAS as proposed by Iglesia and Biscardi (Scheme 2a), (36,62) and alkyl species are formed on Ga species (Scheme 2b,c). The fact that the CH stretching modes on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with primarily Ga+H+ pair sites (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 0.13) and isolated Ga+ sites (Si/Al = 39, Ga/Al = 0.44) are almost identical (Figure 8ac) suggests that Ga+, regardless of its isolation or pairing with a neighboring proton, is the site activating C3H8. The neighboring H+ in the Ga+H+ pair sites is proposed to facilitate the abstraction of the hydride in the propyl group, leading to the formation of C3H6, H2, and a [GaH]2+ species balanced by two neighboring framework negative charges. This hypothesis is supported by two observations: (1) the GaH species is preferentially preserved or less consumed when exposing GaHx-containing catalysts to C3H8 at 550 C (Figures 5b and 8b), and (2) the Eapp of the PDH reaction on Ga/H-ZSM-5 is lower than that of the GaHx decomposition. Since GaH2 is the dominant hydride species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, the measured Eapp in the GaHx decomposition should be representative of the decomposition of GaH2. It follows that the decomposition of GaH2 is not part of the PDH mechanism; otherwise, the GaH2 decomposition is expected to be the rate-limiting step (RLS) of the mechanism, and the measured Eapp of the PDH should be equal to that of the RLS. This mechanism agrees with two recently proposed mechanisms by Schreiber et al. (46) and Phadke et al. (47) in recognizing the importance of the proximity between Ga+ and H+ sites in the PDH. Instead of considering [GaH]2+ as the active site in the PDH reaction, (47) we propose that [GaH]2+ is merely an intermediate formed in the rate-limiting hydride extraction of the propyl group (step 2, Scheme 2c). This is supported by the observation that the GaH band at 2053 cm1 is less impacted upon introducing C3H8 to the Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 0.13) reduced at 550 C (Figure 5b), as active sites for C3H8 activation are expected to interact with C3H8 and thereby lose their infrared signature. The interaction between C3H8 and GaHx is reflected in the accelerated rates and lowered activation energy of GaHx decomposition in the presence of C3H8. This analysis is further corroborated by the coexistence of the adsorbed alkyl species and the GaH band when the catalyst is cooled to 150 C in the presence of propane (Figure 8b). Our mechanism bears more resemblance to the one proposed by Schreiber et al. largely based on computations, (46) with the key difference being whether the hydrogen evolution occurs prior to or concurrently with the hydride abstraction of the adsorbed propyl group. Our rationale for the latter is based on the observation of the GaH band in the presence of C3H8, which does not appear in the stepwise mechanism. We note that the proposed mechanism is also compatible with the earlier isotopic labeling results by Iglesia and Biscardi, (36,60) which indicated multiple fast CH activations in C3H8 prior to the RLS in the PDH. When a mixture of C3H8 and C3D8 is introduced to Ga/H-ZSM-5, H/D scrambling is expected to occur on BAS, either with or without a neighboring Ga+, leading to a mixture of C3HxD8x. The dehydrogenation of this mixture is then expected to lead to a corresponding isotopic mixture of C3HyD6y, as observed by Biscardi and Iglesia. (36,60)

Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In summary, PDH rates on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with broad ranges of the Si/Al ratio (1539) and the Ga/Al ratio (01.7) were measured, demonstrating that catalytic activity is sensitive to both the Si/Al ratio and the Ga/Al ratios. Intrinsic PDH activities of two Ga species, Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites, were determined, with the former being more active by a factor of 15. Activity energy measurements and modeling provided further evidence supporting the superior activity of the Ga+H+ pair sites and determined the activation energy for each type of species in the PDH. Activation energy of the decomposition of GaHx is lower by 25 kJ mol1 in the presence of C3H8 than under vacuum, indicating the effective interaction between C3H8 and Ga+H+ pair sites. Moreover, the activation energy of GaHx decomposition is higher than that of the PDH, indicating that the hydrogen evolution from GaHx decomposition is not part of the PDH mechanism. Together with additional in situ FTIR spectroscopic evidence, C3H8 is proposed to be activated on Ga+H+ pair and isolated Ga+ sites followed by hydride elimination and the concurrent formation of C3H6 and H2. GaH is proposed to be a reaction intermediate in the PDH, while GaH2 does not participate in the reaction.
