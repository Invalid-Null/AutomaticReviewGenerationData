 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative answer files, I have compiled the consistency ratio between each answer file and the correct answers as follows:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART2_4.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_1.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_0.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_3.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_2.txt": "50%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART2_4.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_1.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_0.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_3.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_2.txt": "50%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART2_4.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_1.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_0.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_3.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_2.txt": "50%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART2_4.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_1.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_0.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_3.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_2.txt": "50%"}, 
  "5": {"answer.PART2_4.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_1.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_0.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_3.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_2.txt": "50%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART2_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART2_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART2_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART2_3.txt": "0%", "answer.PART2_2.txt": "0%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART2_4.txt": "50%", "answer.PART2_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART2_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART2_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART2_2.txt": "0%"}
}
```

For questions 1-5, all answer files state there are no relevant quotes and do not provide the requested comparisons, evaluations, investigations, explorations or descriptions, so they have 50% consistency with the correct answers stating none of these actions are performed. 

For question 6, only answer.PART2_4.txt and answer.PART2_0.txt provide the correct assessment of H-ZSM-5 evaluation, so they have 100% consistency.

For question 7, only answer.PART2_0.txt and answer.PART2_3.txt provide the correct assessment of investigating Si/Al ratio effects, so they have 100% consistency.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
