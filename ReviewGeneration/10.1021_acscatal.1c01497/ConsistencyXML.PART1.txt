 Here is the XML structure comparing the consistency between the answer files and the correct answers:

To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key points in the answer text between each answer file and the correct answers. I labeled them as 100% consistent if they contained the same key ideas, and 0% if there was no overlap in content. For question 3, some answer files contained partial information but did not fully capture the key details, so I estimated a ratio accordingly.

I structured the XML with a <question> element for each question number, containing <answer> elements with the filename and text representing the percentage consistency. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
