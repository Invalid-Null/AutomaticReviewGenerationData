<quotes>
[1] "Ga+ preferentially exchanges with one H+ in proton pairs to form Ga+H+ pair sites at low Ga loadings."

[2] "The turnover frequency on Ga+H+ pair sites in the PDH is higher than that of isolated Ga+ sites by a factor of 15." 

[3] "Instead of considering [GaH]2+ as the active site in the PDH reaction, we propose that [GaH]2+ is merely an intermediate formed in the rate-limiting hydride extraction of the propyl group."

[4] "C3H8 can be activated at BAS, isolated Ga+ sites, and Ga+ - H+ pair sites, though the resulting intermediates are different on BAS and Ga species."

[5] "We hypothesize that carbenium ions are formed on the BAS, and alkyl species are formed on Ga species."

Answer: The article proposes that propane dehydrogenation on Ga/H-ZSM-5 occurs via an alkyl mechanism, where propane is activated on Ga+H+ pair sites or isolated Ga+ sites to form alkyl species. The proximity of Ga+ cations to Brønsted acid sites facilitates hydride abstraction to form propylene. Key steps involve the formation of a Ga-propyl intermediate, abstraction of a hydride to form [GaH]2+ and propylene, and recombining hydrogen to evolve H2 gas. Carbenium ions can also form on the Brønsted acid sites.

答:文章提出丙烷在Ga/H-ZSM-5上的脱氢发生烷基机理,丙烷在Ga+H+配位位点或隔离Ga+位点上被激活形成烷基种。靠近的Ga+阳离子与Brønsted酸位有利于提取氢形成丙烯。关键步骤包括形成Ga-丙基中间体,提取氢形成[GaH]2+和丙烯,以及重组氢气释放H2。碳离子还可以在Brønsted酸位上形成。
