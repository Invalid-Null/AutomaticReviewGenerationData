<quotes>
[1] "In this work, intrinsic PDH rates and activation energies were determined on Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with a wide range of Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios."

[2] "Experimental measurements combined with a dual-site model show the activation energy in the PDH on the Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites to be 90.8 ± 1.5 and 117 ± 4.7 kJ·mol−1, respectively." 

[3] "These results demonstrate that Ga+H+ pair sites are much more active in the PDH than isolated Ga+ sites."

[4] "Instead of considering [GaH]2+ as the active site in the PDH reaction, we propose that [GaH]2+ is merely an intermediate formed in the rate-limiting hydride extraction of the propyl group (step 2, Scheme 2c)."

[5] "C3H8 can be activated at BAS, isolated Ga+ sites, and Ga+ − H+ pair sites, though the resulting intermediates are different on BAS and Ga species." 

[6] "We hypothesize that carbenium ions are formed on the BAS as proposed by Iglesia and Biscardi, and alkyl species are formed on Ga species (Scheme 2b,c)."

Answer: The article proposes that propane dehydrogenation occurs via an alkyl mechanism, where propane is activated on Ga+H+ pair sites or isolated Ga+ sites to form alkyl intermediates. Ga+H+ pair sites have lower activation energy (90.8 kJ/mol) and are much more active than isolated Ga+ sites (117 kJ/mol). The key intermediate is proposed to be [GaH]2+ formed from hydride abstraction of the alkyl group. BAS can also activate propane to form carbenium ions, but this is proposed to be a minor pathway.

答:这篇文章提出丙烷脱氢发生乙基机理,丙烷在Ga+H+成对位点或孤立Ga+位点上被活化形成乙基中间体。Ga+H+成对位点的活化能(90.8 kJ/mol)较低,活性远高于孤立Ga+位点(117 kJ/mol)。关键中间体被提出为从乙基基团中提取氢化物形成的[GaH]2+。Lewis碱位点也��以活化丙烷形成碳正离子,但这被认为是次要途��。
