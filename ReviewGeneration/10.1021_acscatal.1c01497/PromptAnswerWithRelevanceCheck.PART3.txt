[2] "In situ FTIR spectra were collected on an Agilent CARY 660 spectrometer equipped with an mercurycadmiumtelluride detector." 

[3] "In situ FTIR spectroscopy was employed to demonstrate the replacement of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) by gallium after reduction at high temperature and the formation of GaHx including Ga dihydride (2041 cm1) and Ga monohydride (2059 cm1) and suggested that GaHx plays an important role in PDH."

[4] "Control experiments rule out the possible influence of water vapor in the evacuated cell on the spectra based on the lack of the Ga(OH)x band at 3662 cm-1 (Figure S11)."

[5] "FTIR spectroscopy shows that a fraction of BAS on Ga/H-ZSM-5 is consumed in the presence of C3H8 and C3H6." 

[6] "This is clear evidence of C3H8 interacting with BAS at the reaction temperature."

4. Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in situ FTIR spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses in situ FTIR to investigate the effect of propane on GaHx species on Ga/H-ZSM-5 at reaction temperatures, to demonstrate the formation of GaHx species after high temperature reduction, to show propane's interaction with Brønsted acid sites, and to rule out the influence of water vapor. The data provides evidence for propane's role in promoting GaHx decomposition and its interaction with both Ga species and Brønsted acid sites.
