<quotes>
[1] "Moreover, the activation energy of GaHx decomposition is 40–60 kJ·mol−1 higher than that of the PDH on Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites, suggesting against GaHx decomposition as part of the PDH mechanism."

[2] "PDH rates were measured on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with varying Si/Al ratios (15–39) and Ga/Al ratios (0–1.7), demonstrating that catalytic activity is sensitive to both the Si/Al ratio and the Ga/Al ratios." 

[3] "Activation energy measurements confirm that the apparent activation energy (Eapp) of the PDH on the Ga+H+ pair sites is lower than that on the isolated Ga+ sites."

[4] "On samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15, as the Ga/Al ratio increases, the TOFAl increases rapidly with the Ga loading up to the Ga/Al ratio of 0.05 and then increases more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3 before declining with the further addition of Ga (Figure 1a)."

[5] "This drastic change in the TOFGa implies that additional Ga introduced at in the Ga/Al ratio of 0.042 to 0.21 exists in a different state from that introduced to samples with the lower Ga/Al ratios, i.e., two types of Ga sites with distinct PDH activities are present."

7. Answer: The article investigates the effects of tuning zeolite Si/Al ratio on propane dehydrogenation catalyst performance. It measures PDH rates on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with varying Si/Al ratios of 15-39 and shows that the catalytic activity is sensitive to the Si/Al ratio. The article finds two types of active Ga sites - Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites - which have distinct PDH activities depending on the Si/Al ratio. At lower Si/Al ratios, Ga+H+ pair sites dominate at low Ga loadings, showing higher PDH activity. At higher Si/Al ratios and Ga loadings, isolated Ga+ sites are formed which have lower PDH activity. This reveals a structure-function relationship between zeolite composition, Ga speciation, and catalytic performance.

7. 答案:本文研究了调节沸石Si/Al比对丙烷脱氢催化剂性能的影响。它在Si/Al比为15-39的Ga/H-ZSM-5上测量了PDH反应速率,并显示催化活性对Si/Al比敏感。本文发现了两种活性Ga位点——Ga+H+配位位点和隔离Ga+位点,这两种位点的PDH活性与Si/Al比有明显区别。在较低的Si/Al比时,低Ga负载量时Ga+H+配位位点占主导地位,显示出更高的PDH活性。而在较高的Si/Al比和Ga负载量下,形成了隔离Ga+位点,其PDH活性较低。这揭示了沸石组成、Ga组分和催化性能之间的结构-功能关系。
