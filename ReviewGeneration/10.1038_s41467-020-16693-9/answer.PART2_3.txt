[1] "PtGaPb/SiO2 (Pt/Pb=2) was the best"

[2] "we tested Pt3Sn catalyst, the well-known catalyst selective for PDH1,7, which gave lower conversion, selectivity, and stability (higher deactivation rate, Supplementary Table 5) than PtGa"

[3] "Other bimetallic combinations that have been reported to be effective for PDH (PtSn (ref. 25) and Pt3In (ref. 8); see Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Fig. 16 for details and their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, respectively) were also tested at 600C. However, they all showed deactivation trends similar to that of Pt3Sn"

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts including Pt-Ga, Pt-Sn, and Pt-In for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing PtGaPb/SiO2 with a Pt/Pb ratio of 2 had the best performance. Pt3Sn gave lower conversion, selectivity and stability compared to PtGa. Other Pt-Sn and Pt-In alloys also showed similar deactivation trends to Pt3Sn.

2. 是的,该文献评估了Pt-Ga、Pt-Sn和Pt-In等Pt合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供的数据显示Pt/Pb比为2的PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂性能最佳。与PtGa相比,Pt3Sn的转化率、选择性和稳定性更低。其他Pt-Sn和Pt-In合金也表现出与Pt3Sn类似的失活趋势。
