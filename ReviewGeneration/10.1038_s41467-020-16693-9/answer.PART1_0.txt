[1] "Here, we report that single-atom Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic PtGa works as an ultrastable and selective catalyst for PDH at high temperatures."

[2] "The PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600C for 96h without lowering the performance."

[3] "We achieved the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene production in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580C: see Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 and Supplementary Fig. 11 for comparison with literatures; deactivation rate constant was defined in Supplementary Note 4)."

[4] "We also tested Pt3Sn catalyst, the well-known catalyst selective for PDH1,7, which gave lower conversion, selectivity, and stability (higher deactivation rate, Supplementary Table 5) than PtGa, highlighting the outstandingly high catalytic performance of PtGaPb."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It reports data on PtGa and Pt3Sn catalysts, showing that single-atom Pt included in intermetallic PtGa has high conversion (30%) and selectivity (99.6%) for propylene at 600C for 96 hours without deactivation. It also shows PtGaPb outperforms Pt3Sn in conversion, selectivity and stability.

[1] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation6,7,8,9,10."

[2] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis1. The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH11." 

[3] "The isolated Pt1 is highly selective (99.6%) for propylene production and the catalyst is outstandingly stable for long-term operation at high temperature (96h, 600C). The catalytic performance in PDH is much superior to those of the reported systems."

[4] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the supported Pt catalysts. It describes that isolation of Pt atoms inhibits over-dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis side reactions, leading to high propylene selectivity. The isolated Pt1 sites limit further C-H scissions and coke formation, resulting in excellent stability.
