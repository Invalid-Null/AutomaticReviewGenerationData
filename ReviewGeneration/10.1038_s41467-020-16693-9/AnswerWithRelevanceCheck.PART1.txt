         [1] "Here, we design and prepare the PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst for highly selective PDH, in which threefold hollow Pt3 ensembles were successfully blocked by Pb deposition, while the single-atom-like isolated Pt1 sites remained." 

         [2] "The results obtained in this study provide not only a highly efficient catalytic system for alkane dehydrogenation but also significant insights for material design to isolate and stabilize active metals."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         The article evaluates supported bimetallic Pt-Ga catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It found that modifying Pt-Ga/SiO2 with Pb to block threefold Pt ensembles and isolate single Pt sites gave a highly selective and stable catalyst.

      <Quotes>
         [1] "The isolated Pt1 is highly selective (99.6%) for propylene production and the catalyst is outstandingly stable for long-term operation at high temperature (96h, 600C)."  

         [2] "When the modifier for PtGa was changed from Pb to other metals such as In or Sn, no positive effects on activity and selectivity were obtained."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         The article found that isolating single Pt sites gave much higher propylene selectivity (>99%) compared to Pt clusters. Using Pb as a modifier was uniquely effective for stabilizing isolated Pt and achieving high catalytic performance.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         该文章发现,与铂簇相比,隔离单一铂位点使丙烯选择性大大提高(>99%)。使用铅作为修饰剂对于稳定隔离的铂和获得高催化性能是独特有效的。

      <Quotes>
         [1] "The isolated Pt1 well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability." 
         
         [2] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         The article proposes that isolated Pt sites promote the first and second C-H activations in propane dehydrogenation, while preventing the third C-H activation that leads to coke formation. This minimizes unwanted reactions and improves propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.
      </English>
