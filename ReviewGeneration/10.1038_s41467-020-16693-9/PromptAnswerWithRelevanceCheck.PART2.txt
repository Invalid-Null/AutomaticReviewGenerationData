<quotes>
[1] "Here, we report that single-atom Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic PtGa works as an ultrastable and selective catalyst for PDH at high temperatures. Intermetallic PtGa displays three-hold-Pt ensembles and single Pt atoms isolated by catalytically inert Ga at the surface, the former of which can be selectively blocked and disabled by Pb deposition."

[2] "The PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600C for 96h without lowering the performance."

[3] "The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article describes synergistic effects between Pt and Ga in the PtGa intermetallic catalyst, attributed to ensemble and ligand effects. The single Pt atoms isolated by inert Ga show high selectivity by catalyzing the first and second CH activations but inhibiting the third one. The Pt3 ensembles can be selectively blocked by Pb deposition. This synergism between Pt, Ga, and Pb results in the PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst exhibiting 99.6% propylene selectivity and stability at 600C.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:该文章描述了PtGa互金属催化剂中Pt和Ga之间的协同效应,这归因于团簇效应和配位效��。被惰性Ga隔离的单原子Pt通过催化第一和第二个碳化断裂但抑制第三个,表现出高选择性。Pt3团簇可以被Pb沉积选择性阻断。Pt、Ga和Pb之间的这种协同作用使PtGa-Pb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下表现出99.6%的丙烯选择性和稳定性。

[1] "PtGaPb/SiO2 (Pt/Pb=2) was the best"

[2] "we tested Pt3Sn catalyst, the well-known catalyst selective for PDH1,7, which gave lower conversion, selectivity, and stability (higher deactivation rate, Supplementary Table 5) than PtGa"

[3] "Other bimetallic combinations that have been reported to be effective for PDH (PtSn (ref. 25) and Pt3In (ref. 8); see Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Fig. 16 for details and their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, respectively) were also tested at 600C. However, they all showed deactivation trends similar to that of Pt3Sn"

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts including Pt-Ga, Pt-Sn, and Pt-In for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing PtGaPb/SiO2 with a Pt/Pb ratio of 2 had the best performance. Pt3Sn gave lower conversion, selectivity and stability compared to PtGa. Other Pt-Sn and Pt-In alloys also showed similar deactivation trends to Pt3Sn.  

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

2. 是的,该文献评估了Pt-Ga、Pt-Sn和Pt-In等Pt合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供的数据显示Pt/Pb比为2的PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂性能最佳。与PtGa相比,Pt3Sn的转化率、选择性和稳定性更低。其他Pt-Sn和Pt-In合金也表现出与Pt3Sn类似的失活趋势。
