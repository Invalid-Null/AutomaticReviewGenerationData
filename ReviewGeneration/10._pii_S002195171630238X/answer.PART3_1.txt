 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that address any of the specific questions asked. The literature focuses on atomic layer deposition methods for synthesizing isolated zinc sites on silica supports, and evaluating their catalytic activity for propylene hydrogenation and propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss zeolitic supports, metal encapsulation, reactor types, or advanced characterization of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

<English version answer>

1. The literature does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports.

2. The literature does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability.

3. The literature does investigate catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using reduced diethylzinc dosing during atomic layer deposition synthesis to increase zinc dispersion on the silica surface. It also evaluates pretreating the silica support via dehydration under vacuum to reduce surface hydroxyl concentration, resulting in improved zinc site isolation.

4. The literature does not utilize any in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. 

5. The literature does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

6. The literature does not use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis.

7. The literature does not evaluate different reactor types like fixed beds fluidized beds, or membrane reactors for propane dehydrogenation.

8. The literature focuses solely on evaluating atomic layer deposition methods for synthesizing isolated zinc sites on silica supports, and testing their catalytic activity for propylene hydrogenation and propane dehydrogenation. It does not address any of the specific topics asked about zeolitic supports, encapsulation, reactor types, or advanced characterization techniques for propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
