[1] "We introduced consecutive and interrupted propane pulses to investigate the surface reactions."
[2] "In situ XRD patterns showed that with lattice oxygen consuming, continuous phase transformation occurred over Mo1V6 from 100 to 500 °C, along with the disappearing reflections at 26.1 and 31.0 from V2O5, the intermediate reflections of 27.2 from VO2, and the intensified reflections at 33.1, 36.1, and 54.0 from V2O3 (Figure 4c)."

4. The article utilizes pulse reaction experiments and in-situ XRD to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The pulse experiments showed that interrupted propane pulses led to lower propylene selectivity over non-doped VOX, indicating evolution of bulk lattice oxygen to the surface. The in-situ XRD revealed continuous phase transformations of the MoVO catalyst during propane dehydrogenation, corresponding to consumption of lattice oxygen.

[1] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed binding energies in spectra of V 2p2/3 at 517.7, 516.8, and 515.7 eV were assigned to V5+, V4+, and V3+ ions, respectively (Figure 3c)." 
[2] "Additionally, ex situ XPS showed the fraction of V5+ decreased quickly than the crescendo-decrescendo fraction of V4+ and increased fraction of V3+ (Figure S21 and Table S7), corresponding to the quickly decreased VO, crescendo-decrescendo VOV, and increased V3O bands shown in Raman spectra."
