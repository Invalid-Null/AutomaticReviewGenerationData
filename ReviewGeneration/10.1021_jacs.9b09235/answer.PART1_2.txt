[1] "Vanadium oxides have been widely investigated for both of PDH and ODH. In ODH, highly active V5+ species promotes the ready activation of propane via Marsvan Krevelen mechanism." 

[2] "Comparatively, the V3+ species was more active for PDH than V5+ species. However, this highly reductive V3+ species leads to severe coking."

[3] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed binding energies in spectra of V 2p2/3 at 517.7, 516.8, and 515.7 eV were assigned to V5+, V4+, and V3+ ions, respectively."

[4] "For Mo1 V6, increasing ratios of V4+ and V3+ were observed, which are more selective for propylene than V5+."

Answer: The article investigates how tuning oxidation states of vanadium in vanadium oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows V5+ species promote propane activation but are not selective, while V3+ species are more selective but cause coking. Increasing V4+ and V3+ ratios by Mo-doping enhances selectivity.

Answer: 该文献研究了调控钒氧化物中的钒的氧化态如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它显示V5+物种促进丙烷活化但不选择性,而V3+物种更具选择性但会导致结焦。通过Mo掺杂增加V4+和V3+的比例可以提高选择性。

[1] "Lattice oxygen in MoVO mixed oxides contributes to oxidative dehydrogenation by hydrogen abstraction and oxygen transfer. With depletion of lattice oxygen, the V3+ species functions as a catalytic site for nonoxidative dehydrogenation."

[2] "In situ XRD patterns showed that with lattice oxygen consuming, continuous phase transformation occurred over Mo1 V6 from 100 to 500 C, along with the disappearing reflections at 26.1 and 31.0 from V2O5, the intermediate reflections of 27.2 from VO2, and the intensified reflections at 33.1, 36.1, and 54.0 from V2O3." 

[3] "Influenced by lattice oxygen evolution, different reaction regions are observed: an initial region influenced by CO2 from overoxidation (eq 1) and an oxidative dehydrogenation region dominated by C3H6 and H2O (eq 2)."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic scenario where lattice oxygen in MoVO catalysts abstracts hydrogen and transfers oxygen for oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene. As lattice oxygen is depleted, V3+ sites catalyze non-oxidative dehydrogenation. In situ XRD shows phase transformations reflecting lattice oxygen evolution.
