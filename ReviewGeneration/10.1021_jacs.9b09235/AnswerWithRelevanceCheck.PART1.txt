[1] "Vanadium oxides have been widely investigated for both of PDH and ODH. In ODH, highly active V5+ species promotes the ready activation of propane via Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
[2] "Comparatively, the V3+ species was more active for PDH than V5+ species. However, this highly reductive V3+ species leads to severe coking." 
[3] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed binding energies in spectra of V 2p2/3 at 517.7, 516.8, and 515.7 eV were assigned to V5+, V4+, and V3+ ions, respectively."
[4] "For Mo1 V6, increasing ratios of V4+ and V3+ were observed, which are more selective for propylene than V5+."
[5] "DFT calculations on optimized V2O5- and Mo-doped V2O5 indicated the Mo doping in V2O5 increased the binding energy of VO bonds."

<English>
The article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of vanadium oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows V5+ species promote propane activation but are not selective, while increasing V4+ and V3+ ratios by Mo-doping enhances selectivity. Mo-doping increases VO bond strength, inhibiting lattice oxygen mobility and overoxidation. XPS, DFT, and thermodynamic analysis reveal relationships between oxidation states, oxygen binding, and selectivity.

<Chinese>
该文献研究了调节钒氧化物的氧化态、氧迁移性和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。结果显示,V5+物种促进丙烷的活化,但选择性不高,而通过Mo掺杂增加V4+和V3+的比例可以提高选择性。Mo掺杂增强了VO键的强度,抑制了晶格氧的迁移性和过氧化。XPS、DFT和热力学分析揭示了氧化态、氧化键合和选择性之间的关系。

[1] "Lattice oxygen in MoVO mixed oxides contributes to oxidative dehydrogenation by hydrogen abstraction and oxygen transfer. With depletion of lattice oxygen, the V3+ species functions as a catalytic site for nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
[2] "Influenced by lattice oxygen evolution, different reaction regions are observed: an initial region influenced by CO2 from overoxidation (eq 1) and an oxidative dehydrogenation region dominated by C3H6 and H2O (eq 2)." 
</Quotes>

<English>
The article proposes a mechanistic scenario where lattice oxygen in MoVO catalyzes oxidative dehydrogenation of propane via hydrogen abstraction and oxygen transfer. As lattice oxygen is depleted, V3+ sites catalyze subsequent non-oxidative dehydrogenation. It describes reaction steps and intermediates for oxidative and non-oxidative pathways influenced by lattice oxygen evolution.
</English>

<Chinese>
该文献提出了MoVO中的晶格氧通过氢的提取和氧的转移来催化丙烷的氧化脱氢的机理场景。随着晶格氧的消耗,V3+位点催化后续的非氧化脱氢。文献描述了受晶格氧演变影响的氧化和非氧化途径的反应步骤和中间体。
