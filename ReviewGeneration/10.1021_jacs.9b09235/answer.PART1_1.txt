[1] "Vanadium oxides have been widely investigated for both of PDH and ODH."

[2] "In ODH, highly active V5+ species promotes the ready activation of propane via Marsvan Krevelen mechanism." 

[3] "Comparatively, the V3+ species was more active for PDH than V5+ species."

[4] "Highly reductive V3+ species leads to severe coking."

[5] "Until now, high propylene selectivity and productivity over vanadium oxides have not been achieved concurrently due to the unmanageable oxygen reactivity."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how tuning oxidation states of vanadium oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows V5+ species are active for ODH but unselective, while V3+ species are more active for non-oxidative PDH but cause coking. The unmanageable oxygen reactivity of V oxides has prevented concurrent high propylene selectivity and productivity.

答:该文研究调节钒氧化物的氧化态如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。结果显示V5+物种对氧化脱氢活性高但选择性差,而V3+物种对非氧化脱氢的活性较高,但会造成积炭。由于钒氧化物的氧反应性难以控制,至今还无法同时实现高丙烯选择性和产率。

[1] "Lattice oxygen in MoVO mixed oxides contributes to oxidative dehydrogenation by hydrogen abstraction and oxygen transfer."  

[2] "With depletion of lattice oxygen, the V3+ species functions as a catalytic site for nonoxidative dehydrogenation."

[3] "We attribute such high propylene yieldwhich exceeds that of previously reported ODH catalyststo the involvement and precise modulation of bulk lattice oxygen via atomic-scale doping of Mo and show that increasing the binding energy of VO bonds is critical to enhance the selectivity of propylene."

[4] "This work provides the fundamental understanding of metaloxygen chemistry and a promising strategy for alkane dehydrogenation."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic scenario where lattice oxygen in MoVO catalyzes oxidative dehydrogenation while V3+ sites catalyze subsequent non-oxidative dehydrogenation after lattice oxygen is depleted. Precise modulation of bulk lattice oxygen reactivity via Mo doping and increasing VO bond strength is proposed to enhance propylene selectivity. This provides insights into metal-oxygen chemistry for alkane dehydrogenation.

<Chinese version answer>
答:该文提出了以下机理:MoVO中的晶格氧促进氧化脱氢,而晶格氧耗尽后V3+位点催化后续的非氧化脱氢。通过Mo掺杂精确调控晶格氧的反应性及增强VO键能,提高了丙烯的选择性。这为烷烃脱氢过程中的金属-氧化学提供了见解。
