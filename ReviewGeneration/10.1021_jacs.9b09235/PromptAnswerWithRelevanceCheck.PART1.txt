[1] "Vanadium oxides have been widely investigated for both of PDH and ODH."

[2] "In ODH, highly active V5+ species promotes the ready activation of propane via Marsvan Krevelen mechanism." 

[3] "Comparatively, the V3+ species was more active for PDH than V5+ species."

[4] "Highly reductive V3+ species leads to severe coking."

[5] "Until now, high propylene selectivity and productivity over vanadium oxides have not been achieved concurrently due to the unmanageable oxygen reactivity."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how tuning oxidation states of vanadium oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows V5+ species are active for ODH but unselective, while V3+ species are more active for non-oxidative PDH but cause coking. The unmanageable oxygen reactivity of V oxides has prevented concurrent high propylene selectivity and productivity.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

[2] "The ΔG of CL-ODH over V2O5 is lower than 0 during 200500 C compared with PDH (ΔG > 0, 200500 C), suggesting lattice oxygen from V2O5 converts hydrogen intermediate or H2 to H2O and shifts the equilibrium toward C3H6."
