[1] "Vanadium oxides have been widely investigated for both of PDH and ODH. In ODH, highly active V5+ species promotes the ready activation of propane via Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."

[2] "The ΔG of CL-ODH over V2O5 is lower than 0 during 200500 C compared with PDH (ΔG > 0, 200500 C), suggesting lattice oxygen from V2O5 converts hydrogen intermediate or H2 to H2O and shifts the equilibrium toward C3H6."

[3] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed binding energies in spectra of V 2p2/3 at 517.7, 516.8, and 515.7 eV were assigned to V5+, V4+, and V3+ ions, respectively." 

[4] "H2-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was further performed to detect the effect of such interaction on lattice oxygen reactivity."

[5] "DFT calculations on optimized V2O5- and Mo-doped V2O5 indicated the Mo doping in V2O5 increased the binding energy of VO bonds."

2. The article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of V-Mo mixed metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows V5+ is highly active but not selective, while increasing V4+ and V3+ ratios by Mo doping improves selectivity. It reveals Mo doping increases VO bond strength, inhibiting lattice oxygen mobility and overoxidation. Thermodynamics, TPR, XPS, and DFT reveal relationships between oxidation states, oxygen binding, and selectivity.

2. 该文章研究了调节V-Mo混合氧化物的氧化态、氧迁移和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它显示V5+活性很高但选择性不好,而通过Mo掺杂增加V4+和V3+的比例可以改善选择性。它揭示Mo掺杂增加了VO键强度,抑制了晶格氧的迁移和过氧化。热力学、TPR、XPS和DFT揭示了氧化态、氧键合和选择性之间的关系。

[1] "Lattice oxygen in MoVO mixed oxides contributes to oxidative dehydrogenation by hydrogen abstraction and oxygen transfer. With depletion of lattice oxygen, the V3+ species functions as a catalytic site for nonoxidative dehydrogenation."

[2] "The reaction periods of CL-ODH over MoVO mixed oxides are determined as follows: 

I: Overoxidation
(1)

II: Oxidative dehydrogenation  
(2)

III: Nonoxidative dehydrogenation
(3)"

3. The article proposes a mechanistic scenario where lattice oxygen in MoVO catalyzes oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by hydrogen abstraction and oxygen transfer to make propylene and water. As lattice oxygen is depleted, V3+ sites catalyze nonoxidative dehydrogenation. It describes reaction steps and intermediates for oxidative and nonoxidative pathways.
