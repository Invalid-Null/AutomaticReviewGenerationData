<quotes>
[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes catalyzed by metal oxides is considered to be a thermodynamically favorable process for olefin production."

[2] "A major obstacle in its industrialization is the deep oxidation of olefin products over metal oxides catalysts, leading to poor yield of propene and serious CO2 emission."

[3] "Propene is one of the most useful building blocks in petrochemical industry. Commercial production of propene is either based on catalytic cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or direct dehydrogenation of propane to propene. These protocols are tremendously energy demanding and raise environmental concerns."

[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is featured by its exothermicity and free of equilibrium limitation and coking."

[5] "In the past decades, it has been extensively investigated nearly exclusively on metal oxide catalysts, e.g., solgel Li/MgO, CeNbNiOx, V2O5/SBA-15, and VMgO, to benefit from its thermodynamic advantages for propene production."

4. The article discusses the thermodynamic favorability of ODH for olefin production and the kinetic challenge of over-oxidation to CO2. It states that current propene production methods via cracking and dehydrogenation are energy intensive. ODH is exothermic and not limited by equilibrium, but metal oxide catalysts cause over-oxidation.
