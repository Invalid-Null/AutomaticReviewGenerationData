[1] "Pt supported on Ti3C2Tx and on Nb2CTx were prepared via a similar method."

[2] "Approximately 30% ammonium hydroxide solution (NH4OH, 28% NH3 in H2O, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was then added to the solution until the pH reached 11." 

[3] "The obtained catalysts were reduced at 550C in 5% H2/N2 for at least 0.5h before each catalytic test or characterization."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes using incipient wetness impregnation to deposit Pt onto Ti3C2Tx and Nb2CTx MXene supports. It also describes adjusting the pH of the platinum precursor solution and reducing the catalysts in H2/N2 prior to testing.

[1] "Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM was utilized to further characterize the structures of Pt-Ti and Pt-Nb NPs."

[2] "Figure 2a shows an image representative of the NPs supported by Ti3C2Tx MXene." 

[3] "The NP in the center of the figure is viewed along the [111] zone axis, whereas another NP in the upper left corner is viewed along the [001] zone axis."

[4] "Along the [111] axis of a NP, the projected unit cells are composed of periodic hexagonal arrays of Pt atoms that surround Ti atoms at the center of the hexagons (Fig. 2b), which indicates a specific L12 type symmetry and is consistent with formation of the Cu3Au type Pt3Ti IMC (Fig. 2c)22."

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM to image the structures of Pt-Ti and Pt-Nb nanoparticles supported on MXene surfaces, resolving their crystal orientations and intermetallic ordering.
