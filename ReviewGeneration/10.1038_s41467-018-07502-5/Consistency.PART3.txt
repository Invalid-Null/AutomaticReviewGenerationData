To summarize:
- For questions 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 all answer files matched the correct answers 100%.  
- For question 3, answer.PART3_1.txt was inconsistent, while the others matched.
- For question 5, answer.PART3_1.txt and answer.PART3_0.txt were inconsistent, while the others matched.

I carefully compared the English and Chinese answers in each file to the correct answers for determining the consistency ratios. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
