[1] "Another important feature of SOMC/TMP is that this synthetic approach generates isolated metal sites along with OH groups with similar density (ca. 1/nm2) and in close proximity (within 1 nm), providing opportunities to prepare bimetallic systems."

[2] "Successive SOMC/TMP approaches based on two different metal precursors can be used to generate nanoparticles in close proximity to isolated metal sites, Cu/ZrIV@SiO2 or Cu/TiIV@SiO2, or alloyed nanoparticles, PtGa@SiO2, when both metals are reduced."
