To generate the consistency ratios, I compared the answers in each file to the correct answers provided. For questions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7, all answer files were fully consistent (100%) with the correct answers. 

For question 3, answer files 0, 1, and 2 stated that the article does not discuss catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion, which is inconsistent (0%) with the correct answer. Files 3 and 4 accurately described the use of SOMC/TMP methods discussed in the article (100% consistency).
