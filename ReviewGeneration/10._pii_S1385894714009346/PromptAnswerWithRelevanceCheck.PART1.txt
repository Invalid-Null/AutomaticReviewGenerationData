[1] "The bimetallic platinumtin (PtSn) supported catalysts exhibited rather good catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], which had been commercialized by UOP."

[2] "Our previous work [40] demonstrated that the trimetallic PtSnIn/Al catalysts exhibited high catalytic performances in propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[3] "The catalytic stability of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction are markedly improved by introducing 0.61.5wt.% Ca species. The propane conversion has little decline and keep at higher level above 58.0% until 25 h reaction for the PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst in propane dehydrogenation reaction, which is evidently better than the catalysts reported in recent literatures."
