<quotes>
[1] "Pt-based catalysts attract much attention because of its high catalytic performance and eco-friendly property [5], [6]."

[2] "the catalyst deactivation and the production of other hydrocarbons are inevitable at high temperature due to coke deposition and cracking reaction [21]."

[3] "PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst exhibits the best catalytic stability, which is evidently higher than the catalysts reported in literatures after 4 h reaction."

</quotes>

2. The article explains that platinum-based catalysts are of interest because they exhibit high catalytic performance and are environmentally friendly. It states that catalyst deactivation and undesired cracking reactions occur at high temperatures due to coke deposition. The PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst synthesized in the study showed better stability compared to other catalysts in the literature after 4 hours of reaction.
