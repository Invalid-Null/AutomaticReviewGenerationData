         [1] "The bimetallic platinumtin (PtSn) supported catalysts exhibited rather good catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], which had been commercialized by UOP."
         [2] "Our previous work [40] demonstrated that the trimetallic PtSnIn/Al catalysts exhibited high catalytic performances in propane dehydrogenation reaction." 
         [3] "The catalytic stability of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction are markedly improved by introducing 0.61.5wt.% Ca species. The propane conversion has little decline and keep at higher level above 58.0% until 25 h reaction for the PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst in propane dehydrogenation reaction, which is evidently better than the catalysts reported in recent literatures."

         The article evaluates bimetallic Pt-Sn and trimetallic Pt-Sn-In supported catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Pt-Sn/Al catalysts showed good catalytic performance and have been commercialized (Quote 1). Pt-Sn-In/Al catalysts exhibited even higher catalytic performance (Quote 2). Adding 0.6-1.5 wt% Ca to Pt-Sn-In/Al markedly improved stability, with >58% conversion after 25 h for Pt-Sn-In/1.5CaAl, outperforming literature catalysts (Quote 3).

         该文章评估了双金属Pt-Sn和三金属Pt-Sn-In受支持的催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。Pt-Sn/Al催化剂表现出良好的催化性能,并已商业化(引用1)。Pt-Sn-In/Al催化剂表现出更高的催化性能(引用2)。向Pt-Sn-In/Al中添加0.6-1.5 wt% Ca可显著提高稳定性,Pt-Sn-In/1.5CaAl在25小时后转换率仍大于58%,优于文献报道的催化剂(引用3)。

         [1] "PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst exhibits the best catalytic stability, which is evidently higher than the catalysts reported in literatures after 4 h reaction."
         [2] "The catalytic stability of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction are markedly improved by introducing 0.6-1.5wt.% Ca species."
         [3] "The propane conversion has little decline and keep at higher level above 58.0% until 25 h reaction for the PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst in propane dehydrogenation reaction, which is evidently better than the catalysts reported in recent literatures."

         Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic PtSnIn/CaAl catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Data shows the PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst exhibits excellent stability compared to other reported catalysts, maintaining >58% propane conversion for 25 hours. Adding 0.6-1.5 wt% Ca markedly improved stability.

         是的,这篇文章评估了用于丙烷脱氢的负载单金属PtSnIn/CaAl催化剂。数据显示PtSnIn/1.5CaAl催化剂表现出色的稳定性,与其他报道的催化剂相比,在25小时内保持了58%以上的丙烷转化率。添加0.6-1.5 wt%的钙明显改善了稳定性。
