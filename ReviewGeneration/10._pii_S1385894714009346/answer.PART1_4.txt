[1] "The PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts were synthesized by sequential impregnation method for propane dehydrogenation to propylene reaction."

[2] "The BET and XRD measurements show that Ca species have no remarkable effect on the textural properties of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalyst."

[3] "Small Pt particle size can be obtained (5 nm) for PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst according to TEM image."  

[4] "The presence of Ca influences the interactions between metal species and support, leads more amounts of Sn to exist in nonmetallic state, which was observed by XPS and TPR methods."

<English version answer>

1. The article does not evaluate any metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

2. The article does not investigate tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides for propane dehydrogenation.

3. The article does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts. 

4. The article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

5. The article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

6. The article investigates how adding calcium affects the properties of supported PtSnIn catalysts. It found adding 1.5 wt% Ca helped synthesize small 5 nm Pt particles and increased non-metallic Sn species. 

7. The article does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the studied supported metal catalysts.
