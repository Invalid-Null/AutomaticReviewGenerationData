Abstract
The catalytic stability of the trimetallic PtSnIn supported catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction is markedly improved by using Ca-doped γ-Al2O3 as support. The NH3-TPD measurements verify that the surface acidity of the synthesized PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts decreases with the addition of Ca. The TEM images reveal that PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst has the smallest Pt particle size of 5 nm and satisfied particle distribution. The XPS and H2-TPR verify that the state of metal species and its interaction with support are influenced by Ca species. After adding 0.61.5 wt.% Ca species, the catalytic stability of the PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts is evidently improved. However, over high Ca loading leads to a decrease of propane conversion and catalytic stability. For PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst, the propane conversion has little decline and keep at higher level above 58.0% until 25 h reaction time, and the final propane conversion of 34.0% is obtained even after 100 h reaction.
1. Introduction
Since the demand for propylene is continuously growing, much more attention is paid to new technologies to produce propylene, which is mainly produced by conventional steam cracking or catalytic cracking process now. Among the new propylene production routes, catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance [1], [2], [3], [4]. Pt-based catalysts attract much attention because of its high catalytic performance and eco-friendly property [5], [6]. Additionally, several reactors including fixed bed reactor, fluidized bed reactor and membrane reactor are employed to the light alkanes dehydrogenation reactions [7], [8], [9].
The bimetallic platinumtin (PtSn) supported catalysts exhibited rather good catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], which had been commercialized by UOP. Since propane dehydrogenation reaction is an endothermic process, it requires a relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propylene. However, the catalyst deactivation and the production of other hydrocarbons are inevitable at high temperature due to coke deposition and cracking reaction [21]. Thus it is important to develop new catalysts with improved reaction activity, selectivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation reaction.
Many studies were devoted to improving the catalytic performance of PtSn catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reaction by doping additional promoters including rare earth metals (La, Ce, Y), alkali metals (Li, K, Na), alkaline earth metals (Mg, Ca,) and so on [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. Among these promoters, Ca additive exhibited a decent ability to improve the stability and dispersion of metal particles, and thus promoted the catalytic performance. Beside the improvements of PtSn catalysts, there are many modifications of other catalysts by introducing Ca additive. For example, Yu et al. [31], [32] studied the effects of Ca content on CaPt and CaAl interactions. They found that the Ca doped Pt/γ-Al2O3 exhibited a good catalytic stability for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. The existence of Ca promoted the dispersion of Pt particles, prevented the migration and coalescence of metal crystallites and reduced the acidity of catalysts. Yue et al. [33] reported that adding Ca to Pd/CeZr/Al2O3 catalyst could generate well dispersed PdO particles and improve the thermal stability of the active PdO species, which had a promotional effect for the low-temperature catalytic combustion of methane. Bai et al. [34] reported that the addition of Ca in Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts could improve the dispersion and stability of the active species, which can protect them from sintering and significantly improve catalytic activity. Several other works were also carried out to improve the catalytic activity by adding Ca or other alkaline earth metals [35], [36], [37], [38], [39].
Our previous work [40] demonstrated that the trimetallic PtSnIn/Al catalysts exhibited high catalytic performances in propane dehydrogenation reaction. However, the catalytic stability of PtSnIn/Al catalysts still needs further improvement. The purpose of this paper is to determine the promotion effect of Ca addition in PtSnIn/Al catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction. The Ca-doped γ-Al2O3 was firstly prepared, and then used as support to synthesize PtSnIn supported catalysts (PtSnIn/xCaAl) for propane dehydrogenation reaction. The improved catalytic stability of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts was obtained in propane dehydrogenation reaction compared to the PtSnIn/Al catalysts. Several state-of-art characterizations including XRD, BET, NH3-TPD, TEM, H2-TPR and XPS techniques were carried out to elucidate the structure-performance relationship of the catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A commercial γ-Al2O3 (Aladdin, SBET  180 m2 g1, 80100 mesh, labeled as Al) was used as support. PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation method. γ-Al2O3 powder was firstly impregnated in CaCl2 aqueous solution in a certain concentration at room temperature for 12 h. After impregnation, the sample was dried at 120 C for 10 h and then calcined in air at 550 C for 4 h to achieve Ca-doped γ-Al2O3 (labeled CaAl) material. Afterwards, Sn and In were deposited on CaAl material by co-impregnating SnCl2 (Sinoharm, 98.0%) and In(NO3)3 (Sinopharm, 99.5%) ethanol mixed solution at room temperature for 12 h, and then dried and calcined as the same as that mentioned above were followed. Finally, Pt specie was introduced by using H2PtCl6 as the precursor. After dried and calcined as well, the PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts were got. Unless otherwise specified, the loadings of Pt, Sn and In of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts were 0.3, 0.6 and 1.5 wt.%, respectively. All samples were labeled as PtSnIn/xCaAl, where x represents the mass percentage of Ca in the catalysts.
2.2. Catalyst characterizations
2.2.1. XRD
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts were obtained on a BraggBrentano diffractometer (Rigaku D/Max-2000) with monochromatic CuKa radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) of graphite curve monochromator. The X-ray diffraction data were collected from 10 to 80 with a 2θ scanning rate of 4/min.
2.2.2. Low temperature N2 adsorption/desorption
The textural properties of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts were obtained from N2 adsorptiondesorption measurements at liquid nitrogen temperature on an automatic analyzer (NOVA 4000, Quantachrome, USA). Before adsorption, the catalysts were degassed for 4 h under vacuum at 300 C. The BET (BrunauerEmmettTeller) surface areas of the samples were calculated by BET multi-points method. The porous volumes were calculated by BJH (BarrettJoynerHalenda) method using Halsey equation for multilayer thickness. The pore size distribution curves of the samples were obtained from the desorption branch of isotherms.
2.2.3. NH3-TPD
The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) measurements were implemented to analyze the acidity of the catalysts. About 0.05 g sample was placed into a quartz reactor between two quartz wool plugs. Before NH3 adsorption, the sample was treated by dry argon flow (99.99%, 30 mL min1) at 400 C for 1 h. Then the sample was saturated with NH3 at 120 C. After that, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was carried out to detect NH3-TPD profile from 120 to 700 C at the increasing rate of 10 C/min.
2.2.4. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS)
The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts were investigated on PerkinElmer PHI 5000C ESCA using Al Kα radiation. All samples were reduced in a hydrogen flow at 580 C for 2.5 h. The binding energies (BE) were calibrated using the C1s level at 284.8 eV as an internal standard.
2.2.5. H2-TPR
The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements for the PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts were implemented in a programmable temperature system. About 0.2 g sample was filled in the quartz reactor. Before analysis, the sample was flowed by dry argon (15 mL min1) at 500 C for 1 h and then the baseline was stabilized in the gas flow at 25 C for 60 min. Subsequently, the quartz reactor was heated in a temperature-programmed furnace from room temperature to 800 C at the rate of 10 C min1. Finally, a TCD cell was used to monitor and record the consumption of H2.
2.2.6. TEM
The TEM images of PtSnIn/CaAl catalysts were obtained by a transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL JEM2010).
2.3. Propane dehydrogenation reaction
The propane dehydrogenation reaction was performed in a quartz fix-bed reactor (8 mm in diameter). The catalyst (0.3 g) was set in the quartz reactor and reduced by H2 at 580 C for 2.5 h. Afterwards, the feed gas including H2, C3H8 and Ar (H2/C3H8/Ar molar ratio = 7:8:35, WHSV = 3.3 h1) was fed to the reactor. The propane dehydrogenation reactions were performed at 600 C. A gas chromatography (GC, SP-6980) equipped with a FID detector and an AT-PLOT PORA-Q capillary column was employed to analyze the gas compositions. The propane conversion (mol%) and propylene selectivity (mol%) were defined as follows:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterizations of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts
3.1.1. X-ray diffraction spectra of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts
Fig. 1 illustrates the XRD patterns of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts. As can be seen, all samples show three typical peaks at 37.6, 45.8 and 66.8 of γ-Al2O3 [41], indicating that γ-Al2O3 structure is not destroyed during the catalyst preparation process. However, it must be noted that the peak intensity at 66.8 slightly decreases with the increase of Ca loading, implying that the addition of Ca degrades the crystallinity of γ-Al2O3. The diffraction peaks of Pt, Sn and In species are not been detected due to their small particle size and/or low concentration below XRD detection limit. Part Ca species may enter into the channels of γ-Al2O3 in impregnation process because the average diameter of Ca2+ (0.204 nm) is less than the average mouth of γ-Al2O3 [30]. However, the characteristic peaks of Ca-related crystalline phases are not detected since Ca species are highly dispersed or poorly crystallized on the surfaces of γ-Al2O3 [34].

3.1.2. Textural properties
The textural properties of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts are illustrated in Table 1. It can be seen that SBET, VP and Dpore of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts decrease with the increase of Ca loading, implying that the Ca species have entered into and blocked part channels of γ-Al2O3. This is in agreement with the findings of He et al. [42] and Pinilla et al. [43]. From Table 1, it is clear that adding appropriate Ca can improve Pt dispersion and decrease its particle size. The average size of Pt particles reaches the minimum value for the PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst, which will be further discussed in the following section.

3.1.3. NH3-TPD
The NH3-TPD curves of four representative PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the addition of Ca has a great influence on the acidity of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts. A semi-quantitative analysis of the acidity strength distribution was achieved by deconvoluting these peaks using the Gaussian deconvolution method. The results containing total acidity and acidity strength distribution calculated from desorption peak areas are listed in Table 2. For the four representative PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts, there are three desorption peaks on the NH3-TPD curves. The first peak centered at 195 C is attributed to weak acid sites. The second peak centered at 238 C corresponds to medium strength acid sites. Finally, the third peak with a broad desorption in the range of 450500 C is assigned to strong acid sites. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 2 and Table 2 that the total acidity and the fraction of strong acid sites decrease dramatically with the increase of Ca loading, while the fraction of weak and medium acid are promoted. Thus it can be concluded that the doped Ca can neutralize the acidity, especially for the strong acid sites of catalysts, which is accomplished by anchoring onto the Al3+ acid sites [31]. The similar results were all reported by Pinilla et al. [43] and Vishnoi et al. [44].

3.1.4. H2-TPR
H2-TPR technique is used to analyze the reducibility of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts. The results are illustrated in Fig. 3. It can be seen that all catalysts except for γ-Al2O3 support have three reduction peaks with a maximum at about 380 C or even lower temperature (peak I), 524 C (peak II) and 798 C (peak III). The peak III is attributed to the reduction of OH groups or aluminum ions of γ-Al2O3 support [45]. In general, the peak I may be ascribed to the reduction of Pt oxide species. It can be observed that the intensity of peak I gradually increases as Ca loading increases up to 1.5 wt.%. The phenomena imply that the addition of Ca (1.5%) could reduce PtAl interaction, which promotes the reducibility of Pt oxides supported on Al2O3. With the further increase of Ca loading, the intensity of peak I slightly increases and shifts to lower temperature at 368 and 344 C for PtSnIn/1.8CaAl and PtSnIn/2.4CaAl catalysts, respectively. The behavior can be explained that excessive Ca content (>1.5%) covers on support and induces strong PtCa interaction. The shift and increased intensity may be attributed to the reduction of Pt oxides that interacted with Ca species. Similar results were also revealed by Bai et al. [30]. The peaks at about 524 C may be attributed to the reduction of Pt species in stronger interaction with the support and/or the reduction of the trimetallic system(Pt, Sn and In) of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts [40]. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the peak intensity at about 524 C decreases as the Ca addition increases up to 1.5 wt.%. Nevertheless, with the further increase of Ca content, the peak intensity grows instead, implying that excessive Ca content may lead to Sn and/or In species be reduced easily. The specified data about the reducibility of Sn oxides will be further discussed in XPS section. Moreover, our previous work [40] demonstrates that Pt species exists in a reduced state in the PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts after reduction at 580 C for 2.5 h.

3.1.5. XPS
The XPS spectra and detailed data of Sn3d5/2 of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 3 respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the Sn3d5/2 XPS spectra of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts can be deconvoluted into three peaks at 485.6, 486.5 and 487.4 eV, corresponding to different Sn species. Generally, the component at lower binding energy (485.6 eV) corresponds to the reduced Sn species either in zerovalent Sn (Sn0) or in alloyed (SnPtx) state; while the peaks at 486.5 and 487.4 eV are assigned to oxidized species of Sn. However, it is difficult to discriminate between Sn2+ and Sn4+ as their binding energies are very similar [14]. From Table 3, it can be observed that the Sn0 percentages (26% and 16%) of PtSnIn/0.6CaAl and PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalysts are less than that (33%) of PtSnIn/0.0CaAl catalyst. This suggests that the increased amount of Sn species exist in a nonmetallic state with addition of Ca (1.5 wt.%) in PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts. Nevertheless, a slight increase in the percentage of reduced Sn species (25%) for the PtSnIn/2.4CaAl sample compared to PtSnIn/1.5CaAl sample. It may be explained that excessive Ca loading weakens the interactions between Sn species and support, which leads Sn oxides species to be reduced easily. These results are in good agreement with the case of Ca-doped ZSM-5 reported by Bai et al. [30].

3.1.6. TEM
Fig. 5 illustrates the representative TEM images and corresponding Pt particle size distribution of the reduced PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts. The average particle size of Pt is listed in Table 1. It can be seen that PtSnIn/0.0CaAl catalyst exhibits a bad distribution and the largest average size of Pt particles (18 nm). However, as for the PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst, the Pt particles are well dispersed on the support and the mean particle size of Pt (5 nm) is smaller than others, which implies that adding a certain amount of Ca in PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts is advantageous to form small Pt particles and uniform distribution. This behavior may be explained that a suitable Ca content can hinder Pt particles from aggregating in preparation process [31]. However, it must be noted that with excessive Ca addition (>1.5 wt.%), Pt particles tend to agglomerate on the catalyst surface so that the average particle size of Pt particles (10 nm) increases. It can be explained that the excessive Ca may cover and block on the support surface and the strong PtCa interaction which leads to the larger size and worse dispersion of metallic Pt [31]. This result is also been observed for the case of Pd supported catalysts by Shi et al. [46]. In addition, the bigger metal particles may hinder the access of NH3 molecules to the acid centers in support and lead to the lower acidity of PtSnIn/2.4CaAl in return, which was also verified by the case of Pd/Pt and Pd/Rh supported catalysts [47]. In addition, the Pt particle size distributions of PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst after reaction for 100 h are still homogeneously dispersed, and the average particle size of Pt particles of that (8 nm) is only slightly higher than the fresh one. The results indicate that the addition of Ca to PtSnIn/Al catalyst can inhibit the Pt particles from sintering and stabilize the dispersion of the metal particles.

3.2. Catalytic performances
3.2.1. Effect of Ca loading
Fig. 6 shows the propane conversion and propylene selectivity over PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts. As can be seen from Fig. 6(a), the propane conversion of PtSnIn/0.0CaAl catalyst markedly decreases from 60.1% to 36.7% after 22 h reaction. However, after adding 0.61.5 wt.% Ca species, the catalytic stability of the catalysts is evidently improved. Although the catalysts of PtSnIn/0.0CaAl, PtSnIn/0.6CaAl, PtSnIn/1.2CaAl and PtSnIn/1.5CaAl have the similar initial conversions, the final conversions of them increase from 36.7%, to 54.0%, 57.0% and 58.9% respectively with the addition of Ca from 0.0 to 1.5 wt.% in the catalysts. Especially for PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst, the propane conversion only has a small decline (1.2%) after 22 h reaction. From Fig. 6(b), the propylene selectivity for the four catalysts (PtSnIn/0.0CaAl, PtSnIn/0.6CaAl, PtSnIn/1.2CaAl and PtSnIn/1.5CaAl) is about 97.5% and varies little in the whole 22 h reaction. However, the propane conversion, propylene selectivity and catalytic stability evidently decrease as Ca loading further increases to above 1.5 wt.%. The initial propane conversions decrease to 54.6% and 50.0%, and the final conversions after 22 h reaction only have 49.5% and 34.5% for PtSnIn/1.8CaAl and PtSnIn/2.4CaAl catalysts respectively. The propylene selectivity for these two catalysts is below 97%. This results verify that the excessive content of Ca (>1.5 wt.%) in PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts is disadvantageous to both propane conversion and propylene selectivity, which is consistent with the structure and surface properties in above sections.

These results indicate that the presence of Ca has an obvious impact on the catalytic performances of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts. To explain these, it must be noted that PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts are bifunctional, and the two kinds of active centers (metal active sites and acid sites) may collaboratively work, implying that an optimum ratio between the number of metal active sites and the number of acid sites may exist [23]. It is well known that the strong acid sites generally promote the formation of deeply dehydrogenation species through isomerization and coking reactions on the surfaces of catalysts [48], [49]. As analyzed before, the NH3-TPD profiles prove that Ca species can neutralize the strong acid sites of support, which can restrain isomerization and coking reactions. Thus, the change in acidity for PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts should be an explanation for the improvement of catalytic stability. However, it must be noted that for PtSnIn/2.4CaAl sample, a decrease in total acidity and strong acid sites could not lead to the contiguous improvement of stability. It can be explained that excessive Ca loading may destroy the optimum ratio between the number of active sites and the number of acid sites. From TEM and XPS results, the presence of Ca (0.61.5 wt.%) can promote the dispersion of metallic Pt and inhibit the reduction of SnOx. However, with the further addition of Ca, the agglomeration of Pt particles and weaker interactions of Pt with other metals are found, which may lead to the decrease of catalytic performance. Therefore, excessive Ca loading would destroy the optimum ratio between the number of metal active sites and acid sites.
3.2.2. Stability test
Fig. 7 shows the catalytic stability of PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst for propane dehydrogenation reaction. It can be observed that the propane conversion has little decline and keeps at higher level above 58.0% until 25 h reaction. The propane conversion gradually decline after reaction for 25 h. The final propane conversion of 34.0% is obtained even after 100 h reaction. The propylene selectivity is maintained about 98.0% for 100 h. The above results demonstrate that the excellent catalytic stability of PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst is obtained in this study.

3.3. The schematic diagram for the effects of Ca addition
Fig. 8 displays the schematic diagram for the effects of Ca addition on PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts. It is reported that penta-coordinated Al3+ sites are potential Lewis acid sites and the nucleation sites for CaO formation [31]. These Al3+ ions are also bonding sites of Pt on Al2O3 since their strong interactions with atomic Pt or Pt oxide phases [50]. Therefore, for the catalysts with low Ca content (1.5 wt.%), the competing adsorption of Ca with Pt species in impregnation procedure may not only neutralize acid sites but also promote the formation of small Pt particles with uniform distribution. The CaO particles formed on the surface of support isolate Pt species from aggregating during the reduction process, which is favorable for the higher catalytic properties in dehydrogenation reaction. However, for catalysts with over high Ca content (>1.5 wt.%), the excess Ca particles cover and block on Al2O3 surface, which leads some Pt species strongly to interact with Ca and the neighboring Pt particles. Thus the increased Pt size and low catalytic activity result are obtained.

Table 4 displays some recent reports about the catalytic stability of Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction. The initial propane conversions and propylene selectivities, and the final ones after 4 h propane dehydrogenation reaction are collected (the final ones after 2.5 h for PtSn/Al sample). Despite the some difference of catalyst compositions and reaction conditions, it can be seen that compared with bimetallic PtSn supported catalyst, the catalytic stability can be improved greatly by adding some promoters such as In, rare earth metals (La), alkali metals (K, Na) and alkaline earth metals (Mg, Ca,). However, the PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst synthesized in this study exhibits the best catalytic stability, which is evidently higher than the catalysts reported in literatures after 4 h reaction.

4. Conclusions
The PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts were synthesized by sequential impregnation method for propane dehydrogenation to propylene reaction. The BET and XRD measurements show that Ca species have no remarkable effect on the textural properties of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalyst. The NH3-TPD profiles prove that the addition of Ca can neutralize the strong acid sites of the carrier, which is benefit to improve the performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction. Small Pt particle size can be obtained (5 nm) for PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst according to TEM image. The presence of Ca influences the interactions between metal species and support, leads more amounts of Sn to exist in nonmetallic state, which was observed by XPS and TPR methods.
The catalytic stability of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction are markedly improved by introducing 0.61.5wt.% Ca species. The propane conversion has little decline and keep at higher level above 58.0% until 25 h reaction for the PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst in propane dehydrogenation reaction, which is evidently better than the catalysts reported in recent literatures.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
