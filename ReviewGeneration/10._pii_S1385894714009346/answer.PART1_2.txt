[1] "The bimetallic platinumtin (PtSn) supported catalysts exhibited rather good catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], which had been commercialized by UOP."

[2] "Our previous work [40] demonstrated that the trimetallic PtSnIn/Al catalysts exhibited high catalytic performances in propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[3] "The catalytic stability of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction are markedly improved by introducing 0.61.5wt.% Ca species. The propane conversion has little decline and keep at higher level above 58.0% until 25 h reaction for the PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst in propane dehydrogenation reaction, which is evidently better than the catalysts reported in recent literatures."

<English version answer>

1. Answer: The article evaluates bimetallic Pt-Sn and trimetallic Pt-Sn-In supported catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Pt-Sn/Al catalysts showed good catalytic performance and have been commercialized (Quote 1). Pt-Sn-In/Al catalysts exhibited even higher catalytic performance (Quote 2). Adding 0.6-1.5 wt% Ca to Pt-Sn-In/Al markedly improved stability, with >58% conversion after 25 h for Pt-Sn-In/1.5CaAl, outperforming literature catalysts (Quote 3).

2. Answer: No relevant quotes. The article does not investigate this.

3. Answer: No relevant quotes. The article does not propose mechanistic scenarios.

4. Answer: No relevant quotes. The article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects.

5. Answer: No relevant quotes. The article does not evaluate monometallic catalysts. 

6. Answer: No relevant quotes. The article does not investigate how metal particle properties affect performance.

7. Answer: No relevant quotes. The article does not propose mechanistic pathways.

8. Answer: No relevant quotes. The article does not propose mechanistic pathways.

1. 答案:该文章评估了双金属Pt-Sn和三金属Pt-Sn-In受支持的催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。Pt-Sn/Al催化剂表现出良好的催化性能,并已商业化(引用1)。Pt-Sn-In/Al催化剂表现出更高的催化性能(引用2)。向Pt-Sn-In/Al中添加0.6-1.5 wt% Ca可显著提高稳定性,Pt-Sn-In/1.5CaAl在25小时后转换率仍大于58%,优于文献报道的催化剂(引用3)。

2. 答案:没有相关引用。文章没有研究这方面。

3. 答案:没有相关引用。文章没有提出机理方案。 

4. 答案:没有相关引用。文章没有探讨金属-支撑体间的界面效应。

5. 答案:没有相关引用。文章没有评估单金属催化剂。

6. 答案:没有相关引用。文章没有研究金属粒子性质如何影响性能。
