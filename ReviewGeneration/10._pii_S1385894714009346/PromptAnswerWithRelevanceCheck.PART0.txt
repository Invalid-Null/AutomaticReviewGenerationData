<quotes>
[1] "Pt-based catalysts attract much attention because of its high catalytic performance and eco-friendly property [5], [6]."

[2] "the catalyst deactivation and the production of other hydrocarbons are inevitable at high temperature due to coke deposition and cracking reaction [21]."

[3] "PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst exhibits the best catalytic stability, which is evidently higher than the catalysts reported in literatures after 4 h reaction."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article explains that platinum-based catalysts are of interest because they exhibit high catalytic performance and are environmentally friendly. It states that catalyst deactivation and undesired cracking reactions occur at high temperatures due to coke deposition. The PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst synthesized in the study showed better stability compared to other catalysts in the literature after 4 hours of reaction.

</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>

2. 该文献解释了,铂基催化剂由于展现了高催化性能和环境友好性而受到关注。它指出,在高温下,由于焦炭沉积,催化剂失活和不期望的裂化反应会发生。文中合成的 PtSnIn/1.5CaAl 催化剂与文献中的其它催化剂相比,在反应4小时后显示出了更好的稳定性。
