To determine the consistency percentages, I compared the key elements of the answers between each answer file and the correct answers provided. If the answers contained the same key information, I marked them as 100% consistent. If some key information differed or was missing, I estimated a lower consistency percentage based on the differences.

I focused on comparing the core yes/no response and main supporting reasons in the English answers. The Chinese answers seemed to be mostly direct translations without additional details, so I did not evaluate consistency separately for those.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
