Low-temperature propane oxidative dehydrogenation over UiO-66 supported vanadia catalysts: Role of support confinement effects
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002197972201671X
AbstractAbstract
Overoxidation is the principal barrier against commercializing propane oxidative dehydrogenation (PODH) catalysts for propylene production. The current approach to reducing overoxidation, i.e., coating the non-selective support surface with a monolayer of active phase, can itself increase the probability of overoxidation of the produced propylene due to polymerization of active phase species. Incorporating the confinement agents onto the metal oxide support might be considered as an alternative solution to prevent hydrocarbons from reaching the support and overoxidizing. Herein, the UiO-66 metalorganic framework, which contains numerous organic ligands connected to the zirconia nodes, was used as support for the vanadia active phase to highlight the role of support's confinement effects on the overall catalytic performance toward the PODH. The UiO-66 supported vanadia catalysts with various vanadium loadings were fabricated via an ultrasonic-assisted wet impregnation procedure. The catalytic function is related to the underlying chemical processes at catalyst surfaces using physicochemical characterization techniques, PODH performance measurements, and machine learning tools. The results showed that the catalyst with a relatively low vanadia density of 2.7 nm2, equivalent to less than half of the entire support surface coverage, could achieve propylene productivity of 4.43

Incorporating the confinement agents onto the metal oxide support could prevent hydrocarbons from reaching the support and overoxidizing.
1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the key feedstocks in the chain value of petrochemical industries. It is used to mainly produce propylene and other crucial chemicals like propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acetone, isopropanol, and acrylic acid [1], [2], [3]. The present demand for propylene is more than 100 million tons per annum and is projected to grow at 34% per annum. The steam and fluidized catalytic crackers currently supply the majority (90%) of the market's propylene demand as their by-product. On-purpose technologies for direct production of propylene are being driven by rising demand and the economic attractiveness of utilization of low-cost feeds such as shale and natural gas [4], [5], [6]. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), among other on-purpose propylene production pathways, including methanol-to-propylene (MTP) and olefin metathesis, has received significant attention in past decades due to its higher cost-effectiveness [7], [8]. Nevertheless, due to the endothermic nature of the PDH reaction (Eq. (1)), existing dehydrogenation technologies suffer from limited equilibrium conversion and high energy consumption.
(1)
The PDH reaction is often accomplished at high temperatures (550700 C) using Pt and chromium oxide-based catalysts, which are expensive and have environmental concerns, respectively. The alternative catalysts like oxides of gallium, molybdenum, and vanadium, on the other hand, deactivate too rapidly, owing to coke deposition and partial recovery of their activity during the regeneration phase [9], [10], [11]. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (PODH) has been proposed as a promising variation of PDH to address the mentioned issues. Direct hydrogen combustion employing the catalyst's lattice oxygen in this route leads to a substantial reduction in the heat of reaction (even making it exothermic if O2 is used as an oxidant (Eq. (2))) and associated thermodynamic barriers. It also minimizes coke deposition on the catalyst surface and thus practically extends the lifespans of the catalysts [12], [13], [14].
(2)
The state-of-the-art PODH catalysts are constituted of active redox metal oxides like oxides of vanadium, chromium, and molybdenum deposited on conventional metal oxide supports, including silica (SiO2), zirconia (ZrO2), titania (TiO2), and alumina (Al2O3), which may work at lower temperatures (400550 C) than PDH [15], [16], [17], [18].
Despite the great efforts undertaken to develop highly selective catalysts toward propylene, the main present obstacle to the commercialization of PODH technology is the possibility of overoxidation of hydrocarbons, including generated propylene to COx [19], [20]. However, based on prior knowledge, the following aspects of the catalysts' structure-performance relationship could be utilized as heuristics to design new highly propylene-productive catalytic systems in PODH:
(I)
The lower interaction between catalyst and support has beneficial effects on the oxygen mobility of the active phase and the desorption easiness of produced propylene, which increases the activity of the catalyst and lowers the chance of propylene overoxidation, respectively [18], [21], [22].
(II)
The active phase is deposited on the support in different forms, including isolated, polymerized, and crystallized. To prevent lattice oxygen aggregation, which raises the risk of the adsorbed hydrocarbons being overoxidized, it is preferable to deposit the active phase in the isolated form on the support as much as possible [23], [24], [25].
(III)
The bare regions of support are susceptible to total oxidation of the hydrocarbons. So, any technique that creates a barrier between the support metal oxides and hydrocarbons would increase the catalyst's overall selectivity toward propylene. The current approach relies on support coverage by at least a monolayer of the active phase. However this solution is susceptible to polymerization of active phase species, which reduces propylene selectivity [17], [26], [27].
Herein, the catalytic systems composed of the UiO-66 metalorganic framework (MOF) as the support and vanadia as the active phase were fabricated. Vanadia is the most commonly used active phase for PODH due to its numerous oxidation states and outstanding redox properties [25], [28]. The UiO-66s building blocks are formed by connecting each zirconia node (Zr6O8) to the 12 carboxylates of terephthalate linkers [29], [30]. The acidic nature of both UiO-66 and vanadia would lower their interaction (heuristic I). To achieve better dispersion of the active phase in the final catalysts, ultrasonic waves are used during the impregnation step of the preparation route (heuristic II). The organic linkers, i.e., ligands, in UiO-66 could act as a barrier to prevent hydrocarbons from reaching the support metal oxide nodes (heuristic III). The physicochemical properties and performance of the UiO-66 supported vanadia catalysts in the PODH at a low-temperature region, i.e., 150350 C were studied. The governing structure-performance relationship of the synthesized catalysts was also fully described by using the machine learning tools. We hope that our contribution could provide some insights into the PODH catalytic behavior.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All of the compounds were acquired in analytical grade from Merck and Evonik. They were used without further preparation. In the synthesis and measurement procedures, deionized water was utilized.
2.2. Synthesis of UiO-66
The UiO-66 was synthesized through a facile one-pot solvothermal route [31]. Briefly, 0.424 g of zirconium chloride salt (ZrCl4) and 0.272 g of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (C8H6O4) were dissolved in 50 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF) by a magnetic stirrer at room temperature for 15 min. The resulting mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and hydrothermally treated for 24 h at 120 C in an electric oven. The precipitated materials were washed consecutively with DMF and then immersed in chloroform for 4 days to remove any extra unreacted reagents. The final white UiO-66 was separated by centrifugation and vacuum-dried at 190 C for 24 h in order to thermal activation.
2.3. Synthesis of UiO-66 supported vanadium oxide catalysts
The vanadium oxide phase as active sites of the catalysts were dispersed on the surface of UiO-66 through the ultrasonic-assisted wet impregnation method. Three catalysts with different vanadium contents were synthesized in a similar procedure to study the influence of vanadium loading on catalytic performance in PODH. In a typical route, 6.97 gr of oxalic acid (H2C2O4) and 3.24 gr of ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) were mixed in 1200 ml of deionized water for 1 h at 60 C by a magnetic stirrer [18], [32]. Then a definite mass of UiO-66 powder was added to the 20 ml of vanadium oxo-complexes solution. To reach a well-mixed dispersion, the mixture was exposed to ultrasonic waves for 4 h in an ultrasonic bath. The resultant material dried at 120 C for 14 h in the oven and then calcined in the electric furnace at 400 C for 3 h without any further any purification step. Mass loading of vanadium in the final catalysts was manipulated by the mass of the support introduced to the vanadium precursor solution, i.e., 3.0, 1.0, and 0.5 gr of UiO-66 powder. The catalysts were designated as xV/UiO-66, where x represents the mass loading of the vanadium in wt.%.
2.4. Physicochemical characterizations
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy were accomplished with a Mira 3-XMU (TESCAN). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) study was performed on Philips PW 1840 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected by a Thermo Nicolet Avatar 370. Raman spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker model SENTERRA (2009) Raman spectrometer using laser light with 785 nm wavelength as the source of excitation. The Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed using a NETZSCH-TG 209 F1 device. In a typical measurement, a few milligrams of the sample are heated in the presence of air from room temperature to 700 C with a temperature ramp of 10 C min-1, and the weight loss of the sample is measured. The specific surface area samples were determined by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K using a Micromeritics TriStar II plus and single point BET method. All samples were degassed at 373 K for 2 h before each BET surface area measurement. The UVvis absorption of the samples was acquired by an Evolution 201 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The edge energy (
) for permissible transitions in the samples was calculated from their UVvis spectra by Davis-Matts method (Eq. (3)):

The hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiment was conducted using the NanoSORD (Sensiran, Iran). In each measurement, about 40 mg of catalyst was charged in the quartz micro reactor and then degassed at 300 C under N2 gas flow for 1 h. After that, the sample was reduced under the flow of diluted H2 in Ar (5% H2) from 40 to 900 C with a rate of 10 C min1. The hydrogen consumption was measured by a gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD detector.
2.5. Catalytic performance measurements
The performance of catalysts toward the PODH was evaluated in terms of propane conversion (

The catalytic tests were done in a fixed bed reactor, i.e., a quartz tube (50 cm length and 6 mm inner diameter) at atmospheric pressure (Fig. 1). In each experiment, the catalyst bed was prepared by mixing 0.1 g catalyst and 0.1 g silicon carbide to improve temperature distribution through the bed. The reactor was located in an electrical furnace was equipped with a PID controller to control the catalyst bed temperature at the desired values. The mixture of air and propane in the required molar ratio was fed into the reactor with a total flow rate of 120 sccm. The gas product composition was analyzed online employing a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a methanizer (Ru/Al2O3) and two flame ionization detectors (0.53 mm ID capillary and packed column).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physicochemical characterizations of the catalysts
The crystalline structure of the synthesized samples was analyzed by their XRD spectra. As illustrated in Fig. 2(a), the XRD pattern of UiO-66 features well-defined sharp peaks consistent with previously published patterns [34]. The vanadium oxide diffraction peaks in the 1V/UiO-66 sample are weak, showing that the vanadium oxide moieties are well distributed on the UiO-66 support or that their crystalline sizes are predominantly less than 3 nm, which XRD cannot detect [35]. The peaks associated with the vanadia became more apparent as vanadium loading increased in 3V/UiO-66 and 6V/UiO-66 samples. When the XRD pattern of UiO-66 is compared to those of xV/UiO-66, it is clear that the framework structure of UiO-66 is essentially conserved after the inclusion of vanadium active sites via wet impregnation and subsequent heat treatment. This could also be confirmed by examining the UiO-66 TG curve and its first derivative, i.e., derivative thermogravimetry (DTG). The DTG curve has two distinct peaks, as represented in Fig. 2 (b). The first peak could be attributed to the vaporization of adsorbed water, and the second to the destruction of the framework due to organic linker combustion. The region between these two peaks, i.e., 100 up to 500 C, is recognized as the dehydroxylation of the Zr nodes [36], [37]. Hence, the structure of UiO-66 remains relatively unchanged during oxidation treatment at 400 C in the synthesis procedure of xV/UiO-66 samples.

The morphological structure of the samples was qualitatively explored with the aid of their FESEM images. The pristine UiO-66 shows clusters of regular inter-grown cubes with a mean size of about 200 nm (Fig. 3 (a)). The images of xV/UiO-66 samples display that the surface features of UiO-66 vanished to some extent, probably due to the formation of vanadia species and experiencing the post-treatment conditions, i.e., wet impregnation and calcination processes (Fig. 3 (b)-(d)).

The mass loading of vanadium in xV/UiO-66 samples were determined using ICP-OES elemental analysis. The finished catalysts have the vanadium loading of 0.96, 2.78, and 5.97 wt% (Table 1). Based on the synthesis procedure, the initial vanadium loading in samples is  0.74, 2.01, and 3.51 wt%. Since there is no purification step, i.e., washing with the solutions, all the introduced vanadium stays in the final catalyst. On the other hand, during the calcination step at 400 C, the volatile organic portion of the synthesized material is sublimated, which leads to an increase in the vanadium loading in the final catalyst.

To gain more insight into the influence of vanadium impregnation on the UiO-66 microstructure, the BET specific surface area of the fabricated samples was also evaluated (Table 1). The decrease in BET specific surface area caused by increasing vanadium loading in xV/UiO-66 samples might be regarded as additional evidence for the aging of the exterior surface of UiO-66, as shown in FESEM images, and the blockage of the entry of mesopore channels caused by the introduction of the vanadia phase [38], [39].
Raman spectroscopy is considered a powerful means to recognize the state of the vanadia phase in the supported catalysts [18], [40]. Raman spectrum of UiO-66 indicates well-defined bands in 1140, 1440, and 1616 cm1 corresponds to breathing mode of CC bonds, symmetric stretching of OCC bonds (carboxylates), and stretching of CC bonds in aromatic rings, respectively (Fig. 4 (a)) [41], [42], [43]. The spectrum of the 1V/UiO-66 shows one more feature at 1013 cm1 compared to the UiO-66 one, which could be assigned to symmetrical stretching of VO in crystalline V2O5 and isolated monovanadate surface species [21], [22], [40]. As the vanadium content in the samples increased, another band at 840 cm1 appeared, which might be attributed to VOV stretching in polyvandates as a result of surface vanadia species polymerization [18], [22], [40]. Based on these observations, i.e., the formation of microcrystalline vanadia particles, which was also confirmed by XRD analysis, even at low vanadium loading and aggregates of surface vanadia species at higher vanadium loading, it could be concluded that surface vanadia species would disperse on the surface of UiO-66 like in the cases of Al2O3 and ZrO2 rather than forming an integrated layer like in the case of TiO2 [18]. It is owing to the acidic nature of both vanadia and UiO-66 that minimizes their interaction.

Fig. 4. (a) Raman and (b) FTIR spectra of the prepared samples.
The FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded to assess the nature of their functional moieties qualitatively and are depicted in Fig. 4 (b). The broad peak centered at  3430 cm1 could be attributed to the OH stretching mode of physisorbed water [44]. The bands at  548, 793, and  1080 cm1 display asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration modes of Zr-O [45], [46], [47]. The peaks at  1630 and 1720 cm1 correspond to CC vibration in the aromatic skeleton and CO stretching vibration, respectively [48]. The peaks at  933 and  2030 cm1 represent the symmetric stretching vibration of VO and its overtone, respectively [21], [49]. Finally, the shoulder at  1230 cm1 shows the asymmetric stretching vibration of V-O-V [50].
The sample's UVvis spectra were used as a supplementary tool to investigate the structure of vanadia phases. The main characteristics observable in the UVvis spectra of supported vanadia catalysts are caused by charge transfer from the oxygen ligand to the vanadium centers, known as the ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT). As seen in Fig. 5 (a), increasing vanadium loading shifted the absorption edge of the samples to a higher wavelength. This phenomenon may be addressed by increasing the degree of surface vanadia species polymerization, particularly in the 6V/UiO-66 sample, suggesting that the charge transfer process in these species was facilitated [51], [52]. Furthermore, the absorption in the visible region is caused by the dd transitions in vanadium centers [53]. Based on various vanadium oxide reference materials, it is feasible to correlate the mean number of covalent V-O-V bonds surrounding V+5 centers with the edge energy of LMCT transitions. In this work, the samples' edge energy was determined using Davis-Matt's method from UVvis spectra (inset of Fig. 5 (a)), and the mean number of covalent V-O-V bonds as a measure of the degree of polymerization of surface vanadia species was retrieved from [52] and reported in Table 1. According to the V-O-V bond number value, it could be concluded that all surface vanadia species are almost isolated up to the mid-range of vanadium loading, i.e., 2.78 wt% with near zero V-O-V bond number value. At the vanadium loading of 5.97 wt%, the polymerization degree of vanadia species is significant as the mean number of V-O-V bonds has reached the high value of  3, which was previously confirmed by Raman spectroscopy.

The apparent site density of vanadium atoms in catalysts is a convenient metric for determining the extent of support surface coverage. It was calculated using mass loading of vanadium and BET specific surface area (Table 1). Based on the theoretical monolayer coverage for monovanadate (2.3V nm2) and polyvanadate (7.5V nm2) [26], [27], it could be concluded that the support surface coverage in synthesized catalysts is even less than half of the monolayer coverage. Because, as revealed by Raman and UVvis spectroscopy, the vanadia species in 1 V/UiO-66 and 3V/UiO-66 are practically isolated, but in 6V/UiO-66 are a mixture of all possible forms.
H2-TPR is used to evaluate the redox performance of the prepared catalysts, and the resulting profiles are demonstrated in Fig. 5 (b). There is one relatively broad reduction peak in all samples, centered around 544 up to 567 C. The vanadia species, in order of ease of their reducibility, are polymeric and monomeric vanadia surface species and crystalline V2O5 [54], [55]. As indicated in Fig. 5 (b), increasing the vanadium loading lowered the maximum reduction temperature, implying that the degree of polymerization of vanadia surface species over the catalyst grew as the vanadium loading was raised, which is in agreement with Raman and UVvis spectroscopy results. Furthermore, the hydrogen consumption in TPR experiments is considered a measure of lattice oxygen capacity or simply the amount of reducible vanadia active phase in the catalysts toward the PODH. The calculated hydrogen uptake (Table 1) raised as vanadium content increased in the samples, signifying that the density of the surface vanadia active phase increased.
3.2. Catalytic performance in PODH
The performance of the three synthesized catalysts with different vanadium loading toward the PODH was studied at three temperature levels (150, 250, and 350 C) and three C3/O2 molar ratios in the feed (1, 2, and 3). As discussed in section 3.1, the state of the surface vanadia species of synthesized catalysts with various vanadium loadings differs. As a result, the catalyst's vanadium loading could be considered a structural parameter to elucidate the structure-performance relationship. While temperature and C3/O2 ratio are operational parameters. In each case, propane conversion (
), propylene selectivity (
), turnover frequency (TOF), and propylene productivity (
) were calculated, and the results are represented in Table 2.

The machine learning approach was utilized to construct a reliable continuous relationship between PODH characteristics and catalysts vanadium loading, C3/O2 molar ratio in the feed, and reaction temperature. Machine learning algorithms are powerful and cost-effective tools that are rapidly being used in a wide range of applications, including catalyst design and optimization [56], [57]. They can find the true underlying relationship between input and output variables from even a small batch of noisy data points without any limitation on the level value of input variables in contrast to experimental design methodologies like the response surface method (RSM). The extracted models could be employed for predicting unmeasured conditions, trend analysis, and optimization purposes with reasonable accuracy.
In this work, several machine learning algorithms including linear regressions, decision trees, support vector machines, ensembles, and gaussian process regressions were trained for each PODH parameter by implying a 9-fold cross-validation scheme using the statistical and machine learning toolbox of MATLAB software [58]. The effectiveness and reliability of achieved models were examined in terms of coefficient of determination (Eq. S1), root mean square error (Eq. S2), and mean absolute error (Eq. S3) for validation data sets (Table S1). Finally, the Matern 5/2 GPR regression model was chosen as the best model for all PODH parameters based on the validation criteria provided due to its highest coefficient of determination and lowest root mean square error and mean absolute error. The Parity plots (Fig. S1) of the trained Matern 5/2 GPR regression models for all PODH parameters confirm their high ability to predict the experimental data (the root mean square errors are also calculated and reported in each figure). In the following sections, the influence of catalyst vanadium loading, C3/O2 molar ratio in the feed, and reaction temperature on each aspect of the PODH was examined by the aim of the developed models.
3.2.1. Propane conversion
The propane conversion could be considered a measure of catalyst activity (Eq. (4)). As shown in Fig. 6 (a-c), increasing temperature has increased propane conversion over the entire range of the C3/O2 molar ratio and vanadium loading. Temperature as a key kinetic parameter positively affects the rate of reactions and consequently the propane conversion.

Fig. 6. Propane conversion as a function of temperature, vanadium loading, and C3/O2 molar ratio.
Propane conversion is also increased along with vanadium loading, especially at high temperatures (over 300 C), proving that temperature is a key factor in active site excitation (Fig. 6 (d-f)). It is approved that the PODH on vanadia-based catalysts proceeds via Marsvan Krevelen redox mechanism [59], [60]. Based on this mechanism, the initial elementary steps of the PODH reaction are carried out by the lattice oxygen of vanadia species rather than the free gas-phase oxygen. The reduced vanadium active sites are then reoxidized by gas-phase oxygen. In other words, if there is no restriction on reactant accessibility, higher vanadium loading, regardless of their structure, results in more lattice oxygen atoms acting as active sites for the PODH.
By raising the C3/O2 molar ratio in the feed, the propane conversion is mildly decreased (Fig. 6 (g-i)). Notably, increasing the C3/O2 molar ratio from 2 to 3 did not significantly deplete the conversion, demonstrating that the PODH is driven by lattice oxygen rather than gas-phase oxygen molecules. According to the PODH reaction (Eq. (2)), the stoichiometric value of the C3/O2 molar ratio is 2. Therefore, at C3/O2 molar ratios of greater than 2, the amount of oxygen in the reaction medium is less than the stoichiometric conditions.
3.2.2. Selectivity toward propylene
In addition to the selective PODH toward propylene, several side reactions such as overoxidation, hydrogenolysis, cracking, and isomerization could take place depending on the catalyst surface properties and operating conditions [61]. As shown in Fig. 7 (a-c), rising the temperature reduces propylene selectivity (Eq. (5)). It could be attributed to increasing the side reactions rate at higher temperatures [54], [62].

Fig. 7. Propylene selectivity as a function of temperature, vanadium loading, and C3/O2 molar ratio.
The propylene selectivity is reduced by increasing vanadium loading, particularly in high temperature and low C3/O2 ratio regions (Fig. 7 (d-f)). The Raman and UVvis findings confirmed that vanadia species polymerized as vanadium loading increased. As a result, lattice oxygen clumps together, making it easier for produced propylene to reach a source of oxygen for further oxidation [24], [63]. This is consistent with previous studies that found highly dispersed isolated vanadia species have the highest selectivity for propylene among the different vanadia species [23], [24], [25]. Furthermore, raising the surface acidity as vanadium loading increases, as demonstrated by the H2-TPR (H2 uptakes in Table 1), makes cracking and isomerization reactions more likely [64].
Raising the C3/O2 molar ratio, i.e., lowering the O2 content in the feed, enhanced propylene selectivity (Fig. 7 (g-i)). As mentioned before, gas-phase oxygen has no direct role in PODH toward propylene, but it can wholly oxidize propylene to COx [63], [65].
3.2.3. TOF
TOF is a quantitative measure of the apparent specific activity of the catalysts in terms of moles of consumed propane per unit vanadium mole of catalyst and time (Eq. (6)). According to Fig. 8 (a-c), the TOF, similarly to propane conversion, increased by increasing the temperature. This might be attributed to enhancing lattice oxygen mobility of active sites. The variation scheme of TOF by vanadium loading changes as the temperature increases. Up to 250 C, increasing the vanadium loading almost led to the TOF reduction in each C3/O2 molar ratio (Fig. 8 (b)). It might be addressed due to vanadia species aggregation and specific surface area reduction by increasing vanadium loading (Table 1), which makes the efficient accessibility of propane molecules to active sites more difficult. But, at 350 C and C3/O2 molar ratios of more than  1.5, increasing vanadium loading up to  3 wt% boosted the TOF, whereas further increasing the vanadium loading caused the TOF to begin to decrease (Fig. 8 (c)). It could be explained by partially compensating for the effect of vanadia species polymerization by raising propane concentration and the activity of vanadia species due to temperature rise.

Fig. 8. Turnover frequency as a function of temperature, vanadium loading, and C3/O2 molar ratio.
A similar trend was observed at constant vanadium loading (Fig. 8 (d-f)). The maximum value of TOF first increased by increasing vanadium loading to 2.78 wt%, and further increases in vanadium loading resulted in a reduction in the maximum value of TOF.
The TOF is positively influenced by the C3/O2 molar ratio (Fig. 8 (g-i)). The increase in TOF with an increasing C3/O2 molar ratio is due to a higher propane content in the feed mixture, which increases their chances of colliding with active sites. It could also be considered another indication that lattice oxygen, rather than gas-phase oxygen, plays a principal role in PODH.
Among the synthesized catalysts, the 3V/UiO-66 with the vanadium loading of 2.78 wt% shows the highest TOF, i.e., 71.4
, at 350 C and C3/O2 = 3. As indicated earlier, the vanadia species are essentially isolated at this vanadium loading. So, it is plausible to say that polymerization of vanadia species as vanadium loading increased would degrade their utilization, i.e., the TOF. It was also determined through the genetic algorithm (GA) that the global maximum of TOF is 71.7
at 350 C, vanadium loading of 3.06 wt%, and C3/O2 = 3. At the maximum TOF, the conversion, selectivity, and productivity are 12.31%, 64.72%, and 4.11
, respectively.
3.2.4. Propylene productivity
As indicated in the preceding sections, conditions favorable for propane conversion are often detrimental for propylene selectivity. The productivity in terms of the mass of produced propylene per unit mass of catalyst and time (Eq. (7)) considers the contribution of both conversion and selectivity simultaneously, making it possible to find the optimal conditions in their trade-off. As illustrated in Fig. 9 (a-c), the productivity increases by increasing the temperature and C3/O2 ratio, but along with vanadium loading, it represents different behavior depending on the temperature. Increasing the vanadium loading almost resulted in an improvement in productivity up to 250 C. But, at 350 C, by increasing the vanadium loading at each C3/O2 ratio, the productivity first reaches a maximum and then starts to decrease. The same behaviors could be realized at constant vanadium loadings (Fig. 9 (d-f)) and C3/O2 ratios (Fig. 9 (g-i)).

Fig. 9. Propylene productivity as a function of temperature, vanadium loading, and C3/O2 molar ratio.
Among the prepared catalysts, the 6V/UiO-66 with the vanadium loading of 5.97 wt% exhibits the best productivity, i.e., 4.4
, at 350 C and C3/O2 = 3. Precisely, the global optimization by GA technique shows that the productivity has a maximum value of 4.74
at 350 C, vanadium loading of 4.62 wt%, and C3/O2 = 3.
This result may seem in contradiction with the previous finding that the TOF reaches its maximum at the vanadium loading of 3.06%, in which nearly all of its vanadia species are in isolated form. In addition, increasing vanadium loading from this amount leads to polymerization of vanadium species and, of course, reduced selectivity in favor of propylene. In fact, although isolated vanadia species are suitable for propylene selectivity, they dominate at low vanadium loading and hence might provide poor support surface coverage, allowing hydrocarbons, including propylene, to be adsorbed on the bare support and overoxidized to COx. In other words, in compromising between the population of isolated vanadia species and the support's surface coverage, the latter has a more significant effect on the final propylene productivity of the catalyst. At the achieved optimum conditions, the conversion, selectivity, and TOF are 16.05%, 53.11%, and 63.66
, respectively.
3.2.5. Comparison with previous studies
The best synthesized catalyst's performance toward the PODH in terms of productivity, as well as its key features, were compared to the previously reported traditional supported vanadia catalysts (Table 3). As can be realized from Table 3, the 6V/UiO-66 has higher propylene productivity than the other supported catalysts, even zirconia-based ones, despite its lower operating temperature and lower vanadium site density. The superior performance of 6V/UiO-66 could be addressed to structural characteristics of UiO-66. As mentioned before, the UiO-66 is constructed by zirconia nodes, each connected to 12 relatively long-tailed organic linkers (carboxylates of terephthalate), which can significantly dampen the diffusion of hydrocarbons to reach the unselective zirconia nodes (Fig. 10 (a)).

Fig. 10. Conceptual representation of (a) support-confined catalyst system and (b) traditional supported catalyst system.
In traditionally supported catalysts, the bare regions of support metal oxide are prone to overoxidizing the hydrocarbons to COx. So, there is a desire to cover as much of the support surface as possible with a monolayer of the active phase (Fig. 10 (b)). As a consequence, the amount of active phase required to cover the support, i.e., active site density, to control the overoxidation process is much more than the confined supports like UiO-66, where uncovered regions are protected by linkers against hydrocarbons. In other words, in the case of confined supports lower vanadium loading may be used, resulting in a higher density of selective isolated vanadia species. Additionally, as the chance of overoxidation is reduced, it would be possible to operate at lower temperatures [17].
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have presented for the first time the use of UiO-66 supported vanadia as an effective catalyst for low-temperature PODH, which was designed based on a-priori heuristics. Catalysts with different vanadia loadings were prepared using the ultrasonic-assisted incipient-wetness-impregnation technique. The structure-performance relationship of the catalysts was explored using several physicochemical characterization methods and experimental PODH measurements in terms of conversion, selectivity, productivity, and TOF at several operating conditions. The machine learning approach was also used to reconstruct the hypersurface that governs catalytic function toward the PODH. The results indicated that using UiO-66 as support provides not only a thermally stable high surface area platform for the well-dispersion of vanadia species but also its abundant organic ligands, i.e., linkers, act as spatial inhibitors against accessing hydrocarbons to metal oxide nodes and prevent their overoxidation. As a consequence, when compared to traditional supported catalysts, the amount of vanadia required to cover the support surface was reduced. Lower vanadium loading corresponds to a higher density of isolated vanadia species, which has a beneficial effect on propylene selectivity. The GA optimization on the regressed models, achieved with the aim of machine learning algorithms, revealed that the TOF and productivity reach their global maximums at vanadium loadings of 3.06 and 4.62 wt%, respectively. This demonstrates that in the trade-off between the density of isolated vanadia species and support surface coverage toward higher propylene productivity, the latter still has the upper hand. Finally, based on the concept of support confinement effect, the other methodologies for creating barriers on metal oxide supports like functionalizing and using inert phase could be pursued in future works.
