         [1] "Bimetallic PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, with the loading of 0.5 wt.% Pt and 3.0 wt.% tin, was prepared by sequential incipient impregnation method."  

         [2] "Kogan et al. [19], [20] found that dehydrogenation rates were higher in presence of steam than that in hydrogen atmosphere over their modified Pt/θ-Al2O3 and Pt/corundum catalysts."

         [3] "Fattahi et al. [21] to understand their observed higher propane conversion in presence of certain amount of steam over a commercial PtSn-K/γ-Al2O3 catalyst."
 
         [4] "Our previous DFT studies on the effect of C accumulation on Pt catalytic PDH, it was found that the coke deposition on platinum surfaces could increase the propane dehydrogenation energy barrier."

         [5] "Therefore, the decomposition of Sn-riched alloys into Pt3Sn alloy and further to Pt clusters could also contribute to the increase of catalytic activities."

         Yes, the article evaluates a Pt-Sn alloy catalyst supported on γ-Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing the Pt-Sn alloy has higher activity than monometallic Pt catalysts in the presence of steam. DFT studies suggest Pt-Sn alloys can lower the propane dehydrogenation barrier compared to Pt. Decomposition of Sn-rich alloys to Pt3Sn and Pt is suggested to improve activity.

         是的,该文献评估了载于γ-Al2O3上的Pt-Sn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显示,在水蒸气存在下,Pt-Sn合金的活性比单金属Pt催化剂更高。DFT研究表明,与Pt相比,Pt-Sn合金可以降低丙烷脱氢屏障。建议Sn-rich合金分解为Pt3Sn和Pt可以提高活性。
