[1] "The most promising catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation process are platinum based catalysts, with tin as promoters to further promote catalytic activity, selectivity and stability [4], [5], [6]."

[2] "The activation energies of propane dehydrogenation under different steam partial pressures were obtained by fitting Arrhenius plot. The results are shown in Fig. 4. All activation energies reported here are in the range of 50-80 kJ/mol, which is in accordance with those obtained for dehydrogenation on PtSn catalysts [4], [31]."
