      [1] "A γ-Al2O3 was used as support to prepare PtSn catalysts, which was obtained by calcinating pseudo-boehmite at 600 C for 8 h in air."
      
      [2] "Bimetallic PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, with the loading of 0.5 wt.% Pt and 3.0 wt.% tin, was prepared by sequential incipient impregnation method."
      
      [3] "The alumina support was firstly impregnated with an aqueous solution of SnCl4·5H2O (99.0%, Sinopharm). The tin containing liquid was added dropwise with stirring, followed by aging at room temperature for 12 h, drying at 120 C for 8 h and calcination at 500 C for 3 h with a heating rate of 1 K/min." 
      
      [4] "After that, the sample was impregnated with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O (99.9%, Sinopharm)) by using the same procedure for supporting tin."

      Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses γ-Al2O3 support and prepares PtSn catalysts by sequential incipient impregnation method. The support is first impregnated with Sn solution, aged, dried and calcined. Then it is impregnated with Pt solution using the same procedure.

      [1] "XPS spectra of Sn 3d and Pt 4f levels for catalysts subjected to different conditions are shown in Fig. 6."
      
      [2] "In Sn region spectrum (Fig. 6(a)), the broad peaks could be decomposed into three peaks centered around 485.3, 486.4 and 487.4 eV, respectively."
      
      [3] "For PtSn-0 sample, the situation is quite different from that of Pt/γ-Al2O3. Besides the peaks (2065 cm−1) from CO adsorption on Pt, a broad peak centered at 2003 cm−1 with shoulders around 2044 and 1980 cm−1 is recorded."
      
      [4] "The quantitative results for XPS are shown in Table 3. It is obvious that most of tin are in their oxidized states for all samples and only 10-25% of tin are assigned Sn(0)."

    <English>
      Answer: The article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe oxidation state changes of Sn and Pt during propane dehydrogenation catalysis after steam pretreatment. It shows that Sn is mostly oxidized while Pt remains metallic, and that the Pt-Sn alloy decomposes after steam treatment.
