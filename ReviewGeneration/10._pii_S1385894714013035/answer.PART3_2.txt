[1] "The changes of tins valences should also change the interactions between platinum and tin and thus the environment of platinum atoms are likely to be varied. The active states of Pt were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of CO adsorption."

[2] "XPS results have shown that tin could be oxidized in steam atmosphere. The changes of tins valences should also change the interactions between platinum and tin and thus the environment of platinum atoms are likely to be varied."

[3] "In accompany with the decomposition of original PtSn alloys, more accessible Pt sites would be generated and increase the catalytic activities."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe oxidation state changes of tin during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. XPS data reveals that tin can be oxidized in a steam atmosphere, which changes the Pt-Sn interactions and Pt environment. This oxidation and alloy decomposition generates more accessible Pt sites and increases catalytic activity.

答案:是的,该文献使用X射线光电子能谱技术来探测丙烷脱氢反应过程中锡的氧化态变化。XPS数据显示,锡可以在蒸汽气氛中氧化,这改变了Pt-Sn间的相互作用和Pt的环境。这种氧化和合金分解产生了更多可以访问的Pt位点,增加了催化活性。
