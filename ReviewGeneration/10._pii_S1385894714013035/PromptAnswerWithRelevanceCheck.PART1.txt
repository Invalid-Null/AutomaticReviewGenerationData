Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It prepares a γ-Al2O3 supported PtSn catalyst with 0.5 wt% Pt and 3 wt% Sn loading (Quote 2). It provides data on propane conversion, propylene selectivity/yield, and catalyst stability at different temperatures and steam partial pressures (Quotes 3, 4). It uses STEM, XPS, FTIR and other techniques to characterize changes in metal particle size, Pt/Sn oxidation states, and CO adsorption properties under different steam pretreatments (Quotes 5-7). The characterizations reveal insights into the structure-function relationships and active site requirements (Quote 8).

答:是的,文章评价了负载的PtSn单金属催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它制备了一种载有0.5 wt% Pt和3 wt% Sn的γ-Al2O3支持PtSn催化剂(引用2)。它提供了在不同温度和水蒸气压力下丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性/收率和催化剂稳定性的数据(引用3,4)。它使用STEM、XPS、FTIR等技术表征了在不同水蒸气预处理条件下金属颗粒大小、Pt/Sn氧化态以及CO吸附特性的变化(引用5-7)。表征结果揭示了结构-功能关系和活性位点的要求(引用8)。

[1] "Besides the peaks (2065 cm−1) from CO adsorption on Pt, a broad peak centered at 2003 cm−1 with shoulders around 2044 and 1980 cm−1 is recorded." 

[2] "The peaks between 1935 cm−1 and 1980 cm−1 are assigned to Sn-rich alloys."

[3] "These results are consistence with the XPS characterization results."

[4] "After contacting steam, tin will be oxidized, as indicated by the low Sn(0)/Sn(Total) ratio."

[5] "Moreover, PtxSny alloys will be decomposed, as evidenced by the CO adsorption." 

[6] "The redispersion of platinum tin catalysts was also observed by Kamiuchi et al. [58], [59], through oxidation and separation of tin in intermetallic compounds at mild oxidizing atmosphere in CO oxidation over Pt/SnO2."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of the PtSn catalysts. The FTIR CO adsorption studies reveal changes in the Pt ensemble size and Sn alloying, showing decomposition of Pt-Sn alloys in steam (Quotes 1,2). XPS confirms oxidation of Sn species (Quote 4). The decomposition of Pt-Sn alloys and redispersion of Pt is attributed to oxidation of Sn and its separation from Pt under steam conditions (Quotes 3,5). Prior work also showed similar redispersal of Pt-Sn catalysts via Sn oxidation (Quote 6). These changes in Pt particle size, ensemble, and Sn interaction are correlated with the improved propane dehydrogenation performance.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章研究了金属颗粒大小、形状和载体相互作用等性质如何影响PtSn催化剂的性能。FTIR的CO吸附研究揭示了Pt团簇大小和Sn合金化的变化,展示了Pt-Sn合金在水蒸气中分解(引用1,2)。XPS确认了Sn物种的氧化(引用4)。Pt-Sn合金的分解和Pt的再分散归因于Sn在水蒸气条件下的氧化和与Pt的分离(引用3,5)。先前的工作也显示了通过Sn氧化使Pt-Sn催化剂再分散(引用6)。这些Pt颗粒大小、团簇和Sn相互作用的变化与改善的丙烷脱氢性能相关。

[2] "In the Sn region spectrum (Fig. 6(a)), the broad peaks could be decomposed into three peaks centered around 485.3, 486.4 and 487.4 eV, respectively. The first peak is assigned to the 3d binding energy for Sn(0), in line with Virnovskaia [40] and Vus [41] study. The Sn 3d binding energy for tin oxides is usually reported in the region 486487 eV [42], [43], and thus the later two bands are assigned to tin oxidation state species."

[1] "Adding Sn into Pt samples might influence the properties of Pt in two ways: on one hand, addition of Sn could decrease the number of adjacent Pt atoms, thus reducing the COCO dipole coupling with an effect of lowering the CO stretching frequency compared to unprompted Pt (dilution effect) [51], [52], [53]. On the other hand, according to Blyholders theory [51], the electrons rich Sn atom could assist the back-donation of d-electrons into the 2π CO orbital, thus alloying with tin would also lower the vibration frequency of CO adsorbed on platinumtin alloy (electronic effect)."

[2] "Based on these assignments, a clear phase transfer process is observed when contacting with steam. The fresh catalyst PtSn-0 contains phases of Pt, PtSn, Pt3Sn and other Sn rich alloys. Steam pretreatment leads to disappearance of PtSn alloy and enrichment of Pt3Sn and Pt phases in sample PtSn-15. After contacting with steam for 3 h, only little PtSn phase exists, and the main phase becomes unalloyed Pt, indicating a nearly complete transfer of alloys to unalloy platinum. These results are consistence with the XPS characterization results."

[3] "The characterization of spent samples by TG and Raman suggest that coking index is lower and cokes with high graphitization degree tend to be depressed in the presence of steam. Lower coking index helps prolong the activity of catalyst and also contributes to the lower activation energy."

[4] "Structure characterization results of steam pretreated samples suggest that the oxidation of tin in PtSn alloys and subsequent segregation of platinum clusters occur, which lead to the increase of more active and accessible Pt sites."
