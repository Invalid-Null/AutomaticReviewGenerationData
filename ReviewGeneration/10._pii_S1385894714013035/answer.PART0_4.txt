[1] "The most promising catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation process are platinum based catalysts, with tin as promoters to further promote catalytic activity, selectivity and stability [4], [5], [6]." 

[2] "These two phases are often reported in PtSn catalysts [41], [43], [56], [57]. Deng et al. [57] found that Pt3Sn alloy was much active than PtSn alloy."

</quotes>

[1] "To achieve reasonably industrial interested per-pass conversion, this intrinsic highly endothermic process is usually operated at high temperatures to conquer thermodynamic limitations [2]."

[2] "But, after the introduction of coke index (coke content/yield of propene), which was used by Kogan et al. [19] to rule out the effect of large differences in propane conversions, a decrease of coke index all along from 0.32 to 0.14 is observed with the increase of steam amount, which clearly indicates the depression effect of steam on coke accumulation."

4. The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic process, so high temperatures are needed to overcome thermodynamic constraints. It states that adding steam lowers the coke index, which helps overcome limitations. But no quantitative thermodynamic or kinetic details are provided.
