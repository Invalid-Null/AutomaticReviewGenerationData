[1] "All the experiments were conducted at WHSVpropane = 14.7 h1 and a hydrogen to propane molar ratio of 0.8."

[2] "Kinetic experiments were carried out at temperatures ranging from 818 K to 878 K with the same total flow and catalyst loading as above, at which conditions mass transfer limitations were excluded."

[3] "The activation energies of propane dehydrogenation under different steam partial pressures were obtained by fitting Arrhenius plot." 

[4] "All activation energies reported here are in the range of 5080 kJ/mol, which is in accordance with those obtained for dehydrogenation on PtSn catalysts [4], [31]."

4. Yes, the article discusses some thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. It provides details on the reaction conditions used, including temperature, catalyst loading, and flow rates. It also presents activation energy values obtained from Arrhenius plots for the reaction under different steam partial pressures. The activation energies are said to be consistent with literature values for PtSn catalysts.
