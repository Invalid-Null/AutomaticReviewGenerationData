[1] "Adding Sn into Pt samples might influence the properties of Pt in two ways: on one hand, addition of Sn could decrease the number of adjacent Pt atoms, thus reducing the COCO dipole coupling with an effect of lowering the CO stretching frequency compared to unprompted Pt (dilution effect) [51], [52], [53]. On the other hand, according to Blyholders theory [51], the electrons rich Sn atom could assist the back-donation of d-electrons into the 2π CO orbital, thus alloying with tin would also lower the vibration frequency of CO adsorbed on platinumtin alloy (electronic effect)."

[2] "Based on these assignments, a clear phase transfer process is observed when contacting with steam. The fresh catalyst PtSn-0 contains phases of Pt, PtSn, Pt3Sn and other Sn rich alloys. Steam pretreatment leads to disappearance of PtSn alloy and enrichment of Pt3Sn and Pt phases in sample PtSn-15. After contacting with steam for 3 h, only little PtSn phase exists, and the main phase becomes unalloyed Pt, indicating a nearly complete transfer of alloys to unalloy platinum. These results are consistence with the XPS characterization results."

[3] "The characterization of spent samples by TG and Raman suggest that coking index is lower and cokes with high graphitization degree tend to be depressed in the presence of steam. Lower coking index helps prolong the activity of catalyst and also contributes to the lower activation energy."

[4] "Structure characterization results of steam pretreated samples suggest that the oxidation of tin in PtSn alloys and subsequent segregation of platinum clusters occur, which lead to the increase of more active and accessible Pt sites."
