[1] "In the present study, a tin modified platinum catalyst was prepared and tested as catalyst for propane dehydrogenation under different steam partial pressures."  

[2] "PtSn/γ-Al2O3, with the loading of 0.5 wt.% Pt and 3.0 wt.% tin, was prepared by sequential incipient impregnation method."

[3] "The propane conversion could be prominently elevated by nearly twofolds with only 1.0% loss of selectivity to propene when an optimum amount of H2O was added."

[4] "Similar hydroxyl involved model was also accepted by Fattahi et al. [21] to understand their observed higher propane conversion in presence of certain amount of steam over a commercial PtSn-K/γ-Al2O3 catalyst."

[6] "But the changes of platinum dispersion in steam conditions are related to the changes of tin oxidation states and the segregation of platinum from PtSn alloys, as revealed by CO-FTIR and XPS results."  

[7] "More accessible Pt sites that are generated in the steam due to the phase transformation of PtSn catalyst as well as the removal of coke accumulated on the catalyst surface would account for the increase of catalytic activities and the decrease of activation energies in steam atmosphere."

<English version answer>

1. The article evaluates a PtSn bimetallic catalyst supported on γ-Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on propane conversion and propene selectivity at varying steam partial pressures. 

2. No, the article does not investigate tuning metal oxide properties.

3. The article proposes that platinum is the active site for dehydrogenation, and that steam helps remove coke deposits from the catalyst surface.

4. No, the article does not explore metal-support effects.

5. No, the article does not evaluate any mono-metallic catalysts.

6. The article shows that oxidation of tin leads to decomposition of PtSn alloys and redispersion of Pt particles. This increases accessible Pt sites and catalytic activity.

7. The article proposes that propane dehydrogenates directly on Pt sites. Steam removes coke deposits, regenerates Pt sites from PtSn alloys, and decreases activation energy.

8. No, the article does not propose detailed mechanistic pathways.

1. 该文章评估了担载在γ-Al2O3上的PtSn双金属催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供了在不同水蒸气分压下丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性的数据。

2. 不,文章没有研究调谐金属氧化物性质。

3. 文章提出铂是脱氢活跃位点,水蒸气帮助去除催化剂表面上的焦炭沉积。

4. 不,文章没有探讨金属-支撑体间的效应。

5. 不,文章没有评估任何单金属催化剂。

6. 文章显示锡的氧化导致PtSn合金的分解和Pt颗粒的再分散。这增加了可达Pt位点和催化活性。

7. 文章提出丙烷在Pt位点上直接脱氢。水蒸气去除焦炭沉积,从PtSn合金中再生Pt位点,并降低活化能。

8. 不,文章没有提出详细的机理途径。
