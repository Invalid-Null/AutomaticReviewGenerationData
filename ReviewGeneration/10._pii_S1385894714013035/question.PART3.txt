AbstractHighlights
•
Both promoting and retarding effects of steam are observed.

Abstract
To investigate the role of steam on the structure and activities of platinum-based catalyst, a tin modified Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of steam. The propane conversion could be prominently elevated by nearly twofolds with only 1.0% loss of selectivity to propene when an optimum amount of H2O was added. The retarding effects of steam on the activities are also observed at higher H2O/C3H8 molar ratios (>1). Kinetic studies results show that the apparent activation energies for steam dehydrogenations are lower than those without steam addition. The fresh, spent and steam pretreated catalysts were characterized by TG, Raman, H2-chem, HAADF-STEM, XPS and CO adsorption FT-IR (CO-FTIR). It is observed that the platinum particles sizes are smaller in the samples subjected to certain period of steam pretreatment. The changes of platinum dispersion in steam conditions are related to the changes of tin oxidation states and the segregation of platinum from PtSn alloys, as revealed by CO-FTIR and XPS results. More accessible Pt sites that are generated in the steam due to the phase transformation of PtSn catalyst as well as the removal of coke accumulated on the catalyst surface would account for the increase of catalytic activities and the decrease of activation energies in steam atmosphere. Competitive adsorption of H2O and other reagent over Pt sites would lead to the retarding effects of steam on the activities at high H2O partial pressure.
1. Introduction
Propane is one of the most important building blocks for a wide array of commodity and specialty chemicals. Traditional ways of producing propene like steam cracking of petroleum-derived naphtha, now cannot meet the increasing demand in worldwide market. The alternative way of producing propene via dehydrogenation from propane, which is a naturally abundant source, is becoming more and more important to capture the marginal, additional capacity needed to compensate for the imbalance of propene market [1], [2], [3].
The most promising catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation process are platinum based catalysts, with tin as promoters to further promote catalytic activity, selectivity and stability [4], [5], [6]. To achieve reasonably industrial interested per-pass conversion, this intrinsic highly endothermic process is usually operated at high temperatures to conquer thermodynamic limitations [2]. However, this would lead to cracking and coking by-products, thus requiring repeated catalysts regenerations [1], [7], [8]. Some techniques were proposed to improve this process, including oxidative dehydrogenation [9], [10], [11], [12], steam dehydrogenation [13], hydrogen removal by selective oxidation [14] or by membrane [15], [16], [17]. From the point of view of thermodynamic, steam is a good medium to elevate propane equilibrium conversion by lower propane partial pressure. Steam can also be served as heat carrier and coke remover to elongate the catalysts activity [18]. Steam could be generated in hydrogen combustion reactor and enter the following dehydrogenation reactors if selective hydrogen oxidation process is incorporated in the processes. In addition, steam also present in catalysts regeneration process. Therefore, it is important to investigate the role of steam on the structure and activities of platinum based catalyst.
Very few investigations have reported the effects of steam on propane dehydrogenation process and some contradictive conclusions were seen in the literature [3]. Kogan et al. [19], [20] found that dehydrogenation rates were higher in presence of steam than that in hydrogen atmosphere over their modified Pt/θ-Al2O3 and Pt/corundum catalysts. They supposed that hydroxyl was involved in the rate limiting step thus promoting the dehydrogenation process. Similar hydroxyl involved model was also accepted by Fattahi et al. [21] to understand their observed higher propane conversion in presence of certain amount of steam over a commercial PtSn-K/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. However, retarding effects of steam was observed by Luu et al. [22] over tin modified Pt/γ-Al2O3, and steam was involved in the dominator of their kinetic model with a second order. Similar decrease of initial catalytic activity effects of steam was also observed by Dong et al. [23] and sintering of platinum particles was supposed to account for the observed activity decrease. Dong et al. [24] also reported better performance of PtSn/MgAl2O4 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 could be obtained in steam atmosphere and they supposed that the steam modified catalysts surface was responsible for the phenomena. It seems that the catalytic performances in presence of steam were closely related to the specific catalysts under investigation. But the relationship between the structure of catalysts and catalysts performances still needs further exploration.
In the present study, a tin modified platinum catalyst was prepared and tested as catalyst for propane dehydrogenation under different steam partial pressures. The catalysts were characterized by using TG, Raman, H2-chem, HAADF-STEM, XPS, CO-FTIR techniques. Finally, the changes of catalysts properties and their relationship with their activities were discussed.
2. Materials and method
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
A γ-Al2O3 was used as support to prepare PtSn catalysts, which was obtained by calcinating pseudo-boehmite at 600 C for 8 h in air. Bimetallic PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, with the loading of 0.5 wt.% Pt and 3.0 wt.% tin, was prepared by sequential incipient impregnation method. The alumina support was firstly impregnated with an aqueous solution of SnCl4·5H2O (99.0%, Sinopharm). The tin containing liquid was added dropwise with stirring, followed by aging at room temperature for 12 h, drying at 120 C for 8 h and calcination at 500 C for 3 h with a heating rate of 1 K/min. After that, the sample was impregnated with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O (99.9%, Sinopharm)) by using the same procedure for supporting tin. A supported Pt catalyst without tin was also prepared by a similar method.
2.2. Characterization of catalysts
The amounts of coke formed on the spent catalysts were determined by TG (thermal gravimetric) analysis (SDT Q600, TA Company, USA) in air. Raman analysis was performed at room temperature under ambient conditions on a via-Reflex Raman spectrometer (Renishaw), equipped with a 514.5 nm Ar-ion laser beam. H2 adsorption characterizations were carried out on ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics, USA). The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were obtained on a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin equipped with digitally processed STEM imaging system. The XPS spectra were obtained with a VG ESCALAB 200R spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electro analyzer and a Mg Kα 120 W X-ray source. FT-IR spectra were collected by using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum 100 spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector. The spectrum was collected at a resolution of 4 cm1 and in the wavenumber range of 6000400 cm1. All FT-IR measurements were performed at room temperature (RT) on self-supported pellets contained in a gold sample holder of IR cell with ZnSe windows.
2.3. Catalytic performances and kinetic studies
The propane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a μBenchCAT reactor (Altamira Instrument, USA) equipped with quartz reactor with a inner diameter of 6 mm. The reactor was placed in an electrical furnace and the reaction temperature could be maintained within 0.5 C of the desired set point. The catalyst loading was 0.1 g for catalytic performances experiments over PtSn/γ-Al2O3. All the experiments were conducted at WHSVpropane = 14.7 h1 and a hydrogen to propane molar ratio of 0.8. The water was introduced into the reactor system by using a pump and vaporized before reaching the reaction zone. Varying amount of steam was introduced during experiment and is indicated by H2O/C3H8. Argon was used as balance gas to get a total flow of 76.15 ml/min. Kinetic experiments were carried out at temperatures ranging from 818 K to 878 K with the same total flow and catalyst loading as above, at which conditions mass transfer limitations were excluded. The gas compositions (C1C3 hydrocarbons, H2, CO and CO2) were analyzed online with a 4-channel Micro-GC(INFICON 3000, USA).
2.4. Steam pretreatment
The fresh reduced samples were pretreated in steam at 773 K for 0, 15, 60 and 180 min, and denoted as PtSn-0, PtSn-15, PtSn-60 and PtSn-180, respectively. The steam partial pressure was kept at 17.3 kPa for all samples. Before exposure to ambient air, the fresh reduced and steam pretreated samples were passivated in flowing 0.5% O2/Ar (5 cm3g1s1) for 1.5 h at 293 K.
3. Results
3.1. Propane dehydrogenation in presence of steam
The catalytic performances of PtSn/γ-Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation at 848 K in the presence of different amount of steam are shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen from Fig. 1(a), the catalytic activities are greatly enhanced when steam is introduced. The conversion of propane increases from 19.0% to 24.9% when the H2O/C3H8 mole ratio increases from 0 to 0.5, and further increases to 35.5% at a H2O/C3H8 ratio of 1.0. However, any further increasing the amount of steam would only lead to the loss of catalytic activities. In all runs, the catalytic activities decline with TOS. But the deactivation extent, defined as the catalytic activity relative to the initial one, is slower in the presence of steam.

The selectivity to all the gas phase products are shown in Fig. 1(b)(d). It can be seen that the selectivity to C3H6 drops slightly in the presence of steam. With the introduction of steam, cracking products and carbon oxides are detected as by-products. The selectivity to these products increases with the increase of steam content while decreases with the increase of TOS. The variations of catalytic selectivity with steam partial pressure as well as TOS indicate that evolutions of the catalyst structures occur during the tests.
The catalytic performances were also evaluated at two other temperatures, i.e. 818 and 878 K. Some of the results are summarized in Fig. 2 (more details available in Supporting Information). Similar to the results obtained at 848 K, both promoting and retarding effects of steam on the catalytic performances can be seen at other two temperature levels. The best yields of C3H6 are obtained at H2O/C3H8 molar ratio of 1.0 and introducing steam amount exceeding this value would decrease the catalytic activities. The remaining activity, defined and shown in Fig. 2, could serve as an indicator of the catalyst stability. It is clear that, in all cases, the catalysts have higher stabilities with the addition of steam, especially at the lower temperature of 818 K. At elevated temperature, although still higher than that in the absence of steam, the catalysts stabilities decrease when more steam is introduced.

3.2. Coke analysis
The coke contents for spent catalysts at varied steam partial pressures at 848 K were collected by TG, and the results are listed in Table 1. It is found that the coke amounts do not decrease monotonously with the increase of steam amount. But, after the introduction of coke index (coke content/yield of propene), which was used by Kogan et al. [19] to rule out the effect of large differences in propane conversions, a decrease of coke index all along from 0.32 to 0.14 is observed with the increase of steam amount, which clearly indicates the depression effect of steam on coke accumulation.

H2O/CH = 2.0 3.90 0.14 0.68
Φ Represents the coke index = (coke content/yield of propene).
The coke properties were characterized by Raman characterization, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Peaks at 1336 cm1, 1602 cm1 and 25003300 cm1 are presented in Fig. 3. According to literature [25], [26], the peaks at 27003000 cm1 are assigned to the vibration of CH bond in aliphatic and the peaks at 1336 cm1, 1602 cm1 could be attributed to vibration of aromatic ring, which are D band and G band, respectively [27], [28]. The intensity ratio of them could indicate the graphitization degree of the coke and a higher ratio of ID/IG represents a lower degree of graphitization of carbonaceous materials [29]. The values of ID/IG listed in Table 1 show that the coke formed on spent catalysts in steam atmosphere have lower graphitization degree. The changes of coke properties were also observed in literature in the presence of steam dehydrogenation process [21], [30]. Duprez et al. [30] studied the coking of Pt/Al2O3 in catalytic cyclopentane dehydrogenation reactions and found that steam decreased the amount of carbon with highest degree of graphitization.

3.3. Kinetic analysis
The activation energies of propane dehydrogenation under different steam partial pressures were obtained by fitting Arrhenius plot. The results are shown in Fig. 4. All activation energies reported here are in the range of 5080 kJ/mol, which is in accordance with those obtained for dehydrogenation on PtSn catalysts [4], [31]. The activation energy for propane dehydrogenation in the absence of steam is 70.05 kJ/mol and a declining tendency is observed when steam is introduced, which reaches its lowest value of 58.39 kJ/mol at H2O/C3H8 molar ratio of 1.0. When the addition of steam exceeds this amount, the activation energy is increased to 60.15 kJ/mol.

In our previous DFT studies on the effect of C accumulation on Pt catalytic PDH, it was found that the coke deposition on platinum surfaces could increase the propane dehydrogenation energy barrier. Thus, the lower coke index might be one of the reasons accounting for the observed lower activation energy in the presence of steam [32], [33]. There were also reports that the steam may change the dehydrogenation mechanism due to the effect of hydroxyl radicals. But our DFT results (available in Supporting Information) find that the energy barrier for hydroxyl dehydrogenation is higher than that of direct dehydrogenation on Pt or PtSn surfaces. So, in the following work, we concentrated our research on the effects of steam on the catalysts structures, which could also influence the activation energy of propane dehydrogenation [34], [35], [36].
3.4. Characterization of catalysts
3.4.1. Metal dispersion
To understand the changes in catalysts structural properties when contacting with steam, the reduced PtSn/γ-Al2O3 samples were pretreated in 17.3% steam condition at 773 K for 15, 60, 180 min. These samples were characterized by H2-Chem and the metal dispersions and particle sizes are listed in Table 2. The results show that steam pretreatment could result in changes in metal dispersions. It is interesting to note that the sample pretreated in steam for 15 min has the highest metal dispersion. This indicates that redispersion of platinum catalyst happens when contacting with steam, as will be discussed in Section 4. As expected, contacting with steam for longer time has led to decrease of metal dispersion, which is in agree with the observations in literature [37], [38] that steam will weaken the mutual interactions between metal and support and further lead to slowly sintering of metal particles.

The particle sizes of PtSn-0, PtSn-15, PtSn-60 and PtSn-180 catalysts are determined statistically to be 2.29, 1.97, 2.69, and 2.73 nm, respectively. It is confirmed that the mean particle size of PtSn-15 pretreated in steam for 15 min is the smallest among these samples. These particle sizes obtained from STEM images are slightly higher than that calculated by H2 consumption. This discrepancy may be caused by hydrogen spillover phenomenon, which would overestimate the hydrogen consumption [39].

3.4.2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of catalysts
XPS spectra of Sn 3d and Pt 4f levels for catalysts subjected to different conditions are shown in Fig. 6. In Sn region spectrum (Fig. 6(a)), the broad peaks could be decomposed into three peaks centered around 485.3, 486.4 and 487.4 eV, respectively. The first peak is assigned to the 3d binding energy for Sn(0), in line with Virnovskaia [40] and Vus [41] study. The Sn 3d binding energy for tin oxides is usually reported in the region 486487 eV [42], [43], and thus the later two bands are assigned to tin oxidation state species. But it is quite difficult to differentiate between Sn(II) and Sn(IV) species by examining the shape of the peaks [40], [42]. Therefore, SnOx complex is used to describe the tin oxidation state species. As shown in Fig. 6(b), all samples contain one peak corresponding to Pt reduced state centered around 314.2 eV, which is 0.40.6 eV lower than the values taken from NIST X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy database [44] for metallic state platinum. This displacement suggests that tin might denote electronic density to platinum, which indicate that the platinumtin alloy was formed.

The quantitative results for XPS are shown in Table 3. It is obvious that most of tin are in their oxidized states for all samples and only 1025% of tin are assigned Sn(0). The low amount of reduced tin reflects the strong interactions between tin species and the alumina support [41], [45]. The molar ratio of Sn(0)/Sn(Total) decreases apparently for the samples either pretreated or tested in steam environment compared to their comparing counterparts. This observation indicates that tin species tend to be oxidized in steam and thus leading to de-alloying platinumtin alloys and segregation of platinum.

3.4.3. CO adsorption analysis
XPS results have shown that tin could be oxidized in steam atmosphere. The changes of tins valences should also change the interactions between platinum and tin and thus the environment of platinum atoms are likely to be varied. The active states of Pt were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of CO adsorption. For the purpose of comparison, the adsorption CO on supported monometallic platinum catalyst was also studied here. The results are shown in Fig. 7.

Fig. 7. Comparison of the FTIR spectra of CO adsorbed on sample Pt/γ-Al2O3, PtSn-0, PtSn-15 and PtSn-180.
For Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, a single peak at 2060 cm1 is observed and could be assigned to CO linearly adsorbed on Pt particles [46], [47], [48], [49], [50]. For the spectrum of PtSn-0 sample, the situation is quite different from that of Pt/γ-Al2O3. Besides the peaks (2065 cm1) from CO adsorption on Pt, a broad peak centered at 2003 cm1 with shoulders around 2044 and 1980 cm1 is recorded. For the spectrum of PtSn-15, the peak at 2003 cm1 is still the main peak, but with relatively lower intensity compared with that of PtSn-0. On the contrary, the peaks at 2044 cm1 and 2065 cm1 increase to some extent. After pretreatment in steam for 3 h, the spectrum of the PtSn-180 sample shows a main peak at 2060 cm1 with a shoulder at 2003 cm1.
Adding Sn into Pt samples might influence the properties of Pt in two ways: on one hand, addition of Sn could decrease the number of adjacent Pt atoms, thus reducing the COCO dipole coupling with an effect of lowering the CO stretching frequency compared to unprompted Pt (dilution effect) [51], [52], [53]. On the other hand, according to Blyholders theory [51], the electrons rich Sn atom could assist the back-donation of d-electrons into the 2π CO orbital, thus alloying with tin would also lower the vibration frequency of CO adsorbed on platinumtin alloy (electronic effect). The lower frequency of CO adsorbed on PtSn catalysts was monitored in literature [52], [53], [54], [55]. Palazov et al. [53] found that with the increase of the amount of tin, the CO adsorption band shifted to lower frequencies from 2090 cm1 for 5%Pt to 2053 cm1 for 5%Pt5%Sn sample. An electronic modification of the platinum surface by tin was suggested to account for the shift. Krishnan et al. [54] also found lowered CO frequency adsorbed on platinum by increasing tin amount, and they attributed the downward shifts to dilution effects. A theoretical study of PtM(M = Ru, Sn, Ge) by Liao et al. [55] indicated frequency downshifts of 1235 cm1 in Sn substituted PtnSn10n clusters compared to pure Pt10 cluster.
A theoretical study of CO adsorption on different platinumtin alloys was also carried out and the results are shown in Table 4, the models and computing method were reported elsewhere [35]. Compared with calculated CO vibration frequency (ν(CO)) for Pt(1 1 1), downshifts of 25 cm1 and 66 cm1 for Pt3Sn and PtSn model are observed, respectively. It should be noted that the calculated ν(CO) had systematically deviation from the experimental results possibly due to omitting of the support effect. But the peak differences are found to be consistent with the experimental results. So, the bands at 2044 cm1 and around 2003 cm1 are tentatively attributed to Pt3Sn and PtSn alloy phase, respectively. These two phases are often reported in PtSn catalysts [41], [43], [56], [57]. The peaks between 1935 cm1 and 1980 cm1 are assigned to Sn-rich alloys.
Table 4. CO stretching frequency on different platinumtin surface.
Surface Eads (eV) ν(PtC) (cm1) ν(CO) (cm1)
Pt(1 1 1) 1.67 509 2017
Pt3Sn(1 1 1) 1.84 499 1992
Pt2Sn(1 1 1) 1.55 489 1972
PtSn(1 1 1) 0.58 418 1949
PtSn2(1 1 1) 0.54 428 1909
Based on these assignments, a clear phase transfer process is observed when contacting with steam. The fresh catalyst PtSn-0 contains phases of Pt, PtSn, Pt3Sn and other Sn rich alloys. Steam pretreatment leads to disappearance of PtSn alloy and enrichment of Pt3Sn and Pt phases in sample PtSn-15. After contacting with steam for 3 h, only little PtSn phase exists, and the main phase becomes unalloyed Pt, indicating a nearly complete transfer of alloys to unalloy platinum. These results are consistence with the XPS characterization results.
4. Discussion
In order to understand the role of steam in propane dehydrogenation over PtSn catalysts, different amount of steam was introduced in feed on condition of keeping propane and hydrogen at constant proportion. The best performances of PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is achieved under an optimum H2O/C3H8 molar ratio of 1.0. Higher amount of steam could lead to the decrease of propane conversion, as shown in Fig. 1. This decrease could hardly be attributed to the sintering of platinum particles because throughout the time of contacting with steam for 15 min, a higher dispersion of platinum is revealed by H2-Chem and STEM images, shown in Table 2 and Fig. 5, respectively. Therefore, the competing adsorption of steam and propane on platinum clusters is suggested to illustrate the decrease of catalysts activity. As was suggested in Luus study, steam was the second order involved in the denominator of their kinetic equation [22].
Kogan et al. [19] and Fattahi et al. [21] supposed that the surface hydroxyl might also be involved in the dehydrogenation steps and thus lowering the overall activation energies and subsequently promoting dehydrogenation rates. However, our DFT results reveal that, compared with dehydrogenation on clean Pt surfaces, the coadsorbed surface H2O at a coverage of 0.11 ML on its favored adsorption sites (atop for H2O) would elevate the activation energies for the dissociation of propane by 515 kJ/mol at different sites on Pt(1 1 1) surface and 1950 kJ/mol on Pt3Sn(1 1 1) surface. As to surface OH (bridge sites), the values are 211 kJ/mol and 2831KJ/mol on Pt(1 1 1) and Pt3Sn(1 1 1), respectively. In the case of surface OH involved dehydrogenation, surface OH could abstract hydrogen atom in propane to give H2O, known as EleyRideal reaction mechanism, these reactions need higher activation energies to activate the CH bond in propane than that direct activation on clean platinum surfaces (more information are available in Supporting Information).
Results obtained by H2-Chem, HAAFD-STEM, XPS and CO-FTIR establish the evolution process of active Pt sites in presence of steam for platinum tin catalyst supported on γ-Al2O3. H2 chemisorptions experiments demonstrate the redispersion of bimetallic catalysts in steam atmosphere. After contacting steam, tin will be oxidized, as indicated by the low Sn(0)/Sn(Total) ratio. Moreover, PtxSny alloys will be decomposed, as evidenced by the CO adsorption. The redispersion of platinum tin catalysts was also observed by Kamiuchi et al. [58], [59], through oxidation and separation of tin in intermetallic compounds at mild oxidizing atmosphere in CO oxidation over Pt/SnO2. These results are in agreement with thermodynamic calculations, which shows that Sn is oxidized under steam environments at 500 C, while Pt could remain in reduced state (according to the thermodynamic data from Ref. [60]). In accompany with the decomposition of original PtSn alloys, more accessible Pt sites would be generated and increase the catalytic activities.
It should also be noted that different PtSn alloys have different activities for propane dehydrogenation reaction. Deng et al. [57] found that Pt3Sn alloy was much active than PtSn alloy. Similar results were also revealed by Siri et al. [43], by carefully characterizing the tin containing platinum catalysts, they found that the catalysts activity decreased with increasing PtSn alloy ratio in isobutane dehydrogenation. Our previous DFT calculation results also suggested the activity sequence of catalysts were Pt > Pt3Sn > Pt2Sn [35]. Therefore, the decomposition of Sn-riched alloys into Pt3Sn alloy and further to Pt clusters could also contribute to the increase of catalytic activities.
The pretreated samples were also tested in propane dehydrogenation, the results are shown in Fig. 8. As expected, the activities of the pretreated samples are higher than that of the fresh one, in consistence with the conclusions obtained above, that more accessible and active Pt site are present when contacting with steam. The decrease of activity for PtSn-180 is due to the sintering of platinum particles as verified by STEM results. The selectivity to propene is not affected by this degree of steam pretreatment, which indicates that the redispersed Pt clusters are still well promoted by SnOx complex.

5. Conclusions
Both promoting and retarding effects of steam on the catalytic activities of propane dehydrogenation over PtSn bimetallic catalyst have been testified. The propane conversion could be enhanced by nearly twofolds, while the selectivity loss to propene is within 1.0% in the 6 h run at the optimum steam amount. The apparent activation energy for steam dehydrogenation reaction is lower than that without steam. The retarding effect of steam is observed when excess amount of steam is introduced in the feed. The decrease in catalytic activity is not attributed to the sintering of platinum particles since the particle sizes are even smaller after contacting with steam for a certain time. Instead, steam could compete with propane to adsorb on active Pt sites and kinetically hindered dehydrogenation reaction.
The characterization of spent samples by TG and Raman suggest that coking index is lower and cokes with high graphitization degree tend to be depressed in the presence of steam. Lower coking index helps prolong the activity of catalyst and also contributes to the lower activation energy. Structure characterization results of steam pretreated samples suggest that the oxidation of tin in PtSn alloys and subsequent segregation of platinum clusters occur, which lead to the increase of more active and accessible Pt sites. The observed slight increase in selectivity loss to propene is attributed to the gasification of coke deposited on catalyst surface.
