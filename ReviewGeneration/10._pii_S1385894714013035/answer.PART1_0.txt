<quotes>
[1] "The most promising catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation process are platinum based catalysts, with tin as promoters to further promote catalytic activity, selectivity and stability [4], [5], [6]."

[2] "In the present study, a tin modified platinum catalyst was prepared and tested as catalyst for propane dehydrogenation under different steam partial pressures."

[3] "Structure characterization results of steam pretreated samples suggest that the oxidation of tin in PtSn alloys and subsequent segregation of platinum clusters occur, which lead to the increase of more active and accessible Pt sites."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
5. Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It studies a PtSn bimetallic catalyst, where Pt is the active metal. The article finds that Pt performs well for propane dehydrogenation when modified by Sn promoters. Oxidation of Sn leads to segregation of more active Pt sites.

5. 是的,本文评价了负载单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它研究了一个PtSn双金属催化剂,其中Pt是活性金属。本文发现,当Pt被Sn修饰时,其丙烷脱氢性能很好。Sn的氧化导致更活性的Pt位点分离。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "In accompany with the decomposition of original PtSn alloys, more accessible Pt sites would be generated and increase the catalytic activities." 

[2] "The particle sizes of PtSn-0, PtSn-15, PtSn-60 and PtSn-180 catalysts are determined statistically to be 2.29, 1.97, 2.69, and 2.73 nm, respectively. It is confirmed that the mean particle size of PtSn-15 pretreated in steam for 15 min is the smallest among these samples."

[3] "The decrease in catalytic activity is not attributed to the sintering of platinum particles since the particle sizes are even smaller after contacting with steam for a certain time."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like Pt particle size and support interactions affect performance. It finds that smaller Pt particles around 2 nm, generated by steam treatment, lead to higher activity. Larger particles around 2.7 nm are less active. Interactions with the support affect Pt dispersion.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
6. 是的,本文研究了Pt颗粒大小和载体相互作用等性质如何影响催化剂性能。它发现约2 nm的较小Pt颗粒,由蒸汽处理生成,会导致更高的活性。约2.7 nm的较大颗粒活性较低。与载体的相互作用会影响Pt的分散度。
