[1] "The most promising catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation process are platinum based catalysts, with tin as promoters to further promote catalytic activity, selectivity and stability [4], [5], [6]."

[2] "Bimetallic PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, with the loading of 0.5 wt.% Pt and 3.0 wt.% tin, was prepared by sequential incipient impregnation method."

[3] "The catalytic performances of PtSn/γ-Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation at 848 K in the presence of different amount of steam are shown in Fig. 1." 

[4] "Fig. 2 shows the propene yields and catalyst stability at different temperatures and steam amounts."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It prepares a γ-Al2O3 supported PtSn catalyst with 0.5 wt% Pt and 3 wt% Sn loading (Quote 2). It provides data on propane conversion, propylene selectivity/yield, and catalyst stability at different temperatures and steam partial pressures (Quotes 3, 4). It uses STEM, XPS, FTIR and other techniques to characterize changes in metal particle size, Pt/Sn oxidation states, and CO adsorption properties under different steam pretreatments (Quotes 5-7). The characterizations reveal insights into the structure-function relationships and active site requirements (Quote 8).

[1] "Besides the peaks (2065 cm−1) from CO adsorption on Pt, a broad peak centered at 2003 cm−1 with shoulders around 2044 and 1980 cm−1 is recorded." 

[2] "The peaks between 1935 cm−1 and 1980 cm−1 are assigned to Sn-rich alloys."

[3] "These results are consistence with the XPS characterization results."

[4] "After contacting steam, tin will be oxidized, as indicated by the low Sn(0)/Sn(Total) ratio."

[5] "Moreover, PtxSny alloys will be decomposed, as evidenced by the CO adsorption." 

[6] "The redispersion of platinum tin catalysts was also observed by Kamiuchi et al. [58], [59], through oxidation and separation of tin in intermetallic compounds at mild oxidizing atmosphere in CO oxidation over Pt/SnO2."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of the PtSn catalysts. The FTIR CO adsorption studies reveal changes in the Pt ensemble size and Sn alloying, showing decomposition of Pt-Sn alloys in steam (Quotes 1,2). XPS confirms oxidation of Sn species (Quote 4). The decomposition of Pt-Sn alloys and redispersion of Pt is attributed to oxidation of Sn and its separation from Pt under steam conditions (Quotes 3,5). Prior work also showed similar redispersal of Pt-Sn catalysts via Sn oxidation (Quote 6). These changes in Pt particle size, ensemble, and Sn interaction are correlated with the improved propane dehydrogenation performance.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章研究了金属颗粒大小、形状和载体相互作用等性质如何影响PtSn催化剂的性能。FTIR的CO吸附研究揭示了Pt团簇大小和Sn合金化的变化,展示了Pt-Sn合金在水蒸气中分解(引用1,2)。XPS确认了Sn物种的氧化(引用4)。Pt-Sn合金的分解和Pt的再分散归因于Sn在水蒸气条件下的氧化和与Pt的分离(引用3,5)。先前的工作也显示了通过Sn氧化使Pt-Sn催化剂再分散(引用6)。这些Pt颗粒大小、团簇和Sn相互作用的变化与改善的丙烷脱氢性能相关。
