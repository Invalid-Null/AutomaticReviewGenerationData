[1] "The most promising catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation process are platinum based catalysts, with tin as promoters to further promote catalytic activity, selectivity and stability [4], [5], [6]."

[2] "In the Sn region spectrum (Fig. 6(a)), the broad peaks could be decomposed into three peaks centered around 485.3, 486.4 and 487.4 eV, respectively. The first peak is assigned to the 3d binding energy for Sn(0), in line with Virnovskaia [40] and Vus [41] study. The Sn 3d binding energy for tin oxides is usually reported in the region 486487 eV [42], [43], and thus the later two bands are assigned to tin oxidation state species."

[3] "The catalysts were characterized by using TG, Raman, H2-chem, HAADF-STEM, XPS, CO-FTIR techniques. Finally, the changes of catalysts properties and their relationship with their activities were discussed."

[6] "The pretreated samples were also tested in propane dehydrogenation, the results are shown in Fig. 8. As expected, the activities of the pretreated samples are higher than that of the fresh one, in consistence with the conclusions obtained above, that more accessible and active Pt site are present when contacting with steam."
