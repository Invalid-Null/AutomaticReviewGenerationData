[1] "In this work, DFT calculations were performed with the VASP (3436) package using plane-wave basis sets."

[2] "Transition-state geometries were located by using the minimum-mode following the dimer method, (43) and the transition states were verified by frequency calculations in which only one imaginary frequency was obtained for each transition state."

[3] "Then, a detailed density functional theory (DFT)-assisted microkinetic model is built under the steady-state approximation and with the adsorbateadsorbate interactions considered."

[1] "Then, a detailed density functional theory (DFT)-assisted microkinetic model is built under the steady-state approximation and with the adsorbateadsorbate interactions considered."

[2] "The microkinetic analysis in this work was carried out using a modified CatMAP code." 

[3] "In general, the enthalpy (H) and entropy (S) were estimated under the ideal gas (47) (for gas-phase species) and harmonic (for reaction intermediates and transition states) approximations as implemented in the ASE package."

[4] "The rate constant (k) of elementary steps was evaluated based on the transition state theory (49)" 

[5] "In the modified code, the entropy and enthalpy of the activated complex in molecular adsorption or desorption were assumed to be equal to the entropy of the adsorbed intermediate and the enthalpy of gas-phase species, respectively, which has previously been reported to be a reasonable approximation."

6. The article presents microkinetic modeling efforts that have provided insights into propane dehydrogenation kinetics. It mentions building a DFT-assisted microkinetic model using a modified CatMAP code under steady state approximation. Enthalpy and entropy were estimated with ideal gas and harmonic approximations using the ASE package. Rate constants were evaluated based on transition state theory. The entropy and enthalpy of the activated complex were assumed to be equal to the adsorbed intermediate and gas phase species respectively in the modified code.
