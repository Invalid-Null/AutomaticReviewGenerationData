[1] The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is a reversible reaction where the equilibrium position lies too far to the reactant side and the propylene yield is severely limited by thermodynamics.

[2] The increase in temperature, however, has a negative effect on the catalyst selectivity because side reactions, such as cracking, hydrogenolysis, deep dehydrogenation, oligomerization, cyclization, and coke formation, are promoted even more dramatically at high temperatures.

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium towards propylene production. However, at the high temperatures required, side reactions become more favorable, decreasing catalyst selectivity. Specific mechanisms described include cracking, hydrogenolysis, deep dehydrogenation, oligomerization, cyclization, and coke formation.

[1] The increase in temperature, however, has a negative effect on the catalyst selectivity because side reactions, such as cracking, hydrogenolysis, deep dehydrogenation, oligomerization, cyclization, and coke formation, are promoted even more dramatically at high temperatures. 

[2] Propylene, which is an important chemical intermediate in the petrochemical industry, has conventionally been produced either as a coproduct to ethylene in steam crackers or as a byproduct in refineries.

[3] The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is a reversible reaction where the equilibrium position lies too far to the reactant side and the propylene yield is severely limited by thermodynamics. Because of its highly endothermic character under standard conditions at 298 K (ΔH°= 123.8 kJ/mol), the operating temperature of the existing commercial processes is typically kept as high as 800-980 K to achieve a reasonable propane conversion.

4. The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is limited thermodynamically, with an endothermic ΔH° of 123.8 kJ/mol, requiring high temperatures of 800-980 K industrially. However, high temperatures kinetically promote side reactions, decreasing selectivity. Propylene is an important petrochemical intermediate, conventionally produced as a byproduct in steam crackers or refineries.

[1] In this work, we have performed a combined experimental and theoretical study to formulate the catalytic reaction mechanism for PDH over both the close-packed Pt(111) and the stepped Pt(211) surfaces. 

[2] DFT calculations were performed with the VASP (34-36) package using plane-wave basis sets. 

[3] The exchange and correlation in the Kohn-Sham theory were treated with the BEEF-vdW functional. (40) In a previous study, Gautier et al. (41) showed that, compared with other vdW functionals, the BEEF-vdW functional makes reasonably reliable predictions of the geometries and energetics of the adsorption of covalently bound molecules such as ethylidyne on Pt(111).

[1] Then, a detailed density functional theory (DFT)-assisted microkinetic model is built under the steady-state approximation and with the adsorbate–adsorbate interactions considered.

[2] The microkinetic analysis in this work was carried out using a modified CatMAP code. (46) In general, the enthalpy (H) and entropy (S) were estimated under the ideal gas (47) (for gas-phase species) and harmonic (for reaction intermediates and transition states) approximations as implemented in the ASE package. (48) 

[3] Here, we first conducted a microkinetic analysis without adsorbate–adsorbate interactions to reveal the kinetics of PDH over Pt, and the results are presented in Figure 3b.
