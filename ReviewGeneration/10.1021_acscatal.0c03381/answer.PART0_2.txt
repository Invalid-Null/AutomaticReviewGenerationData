1. Propylene is an important chemical intermediate in the petrochemical industry. It has conventionally been produced either as a coproduct to ethylene in steam crackers or as a byproduct in refineries. The shale gas revolution in North America has made a significant impact on the global energy market. In addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain a considerable amount of ethane and propane. As a consequence, new steam cracker projects are based primarily on ethane as a feedstock and can only produce a negligible amount of propylene, which gives rise to an increased propylene supply-demand gap. On the other hand, shale-based propane is relatively cheap, making the current market conditions very favorable for propylene production via dehydrogenation.

2. The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is a reversible reaction where the equilibrium position lies too far to the reactant side and the propylene yield is severely limited by thermodynamics. Because of its highly endothermic character under standard conditions at 298 K (= 123.8 kJ/mol), the operating temperature of the existing commercial processes is typically kept as high as 800-980 K to achieve a reasonable propane conversion. The increase in temperature, however, has a negative effect on the catalyst selectivity because side reactions, such as cracking, hydrogenolysis, deep dehydrogenation, oligomerization, cyclization, and coke formation, are promoted even more dramatically at high temperatures.

4. The first step in the kinetic analysis of reactions is to establish the stoichiometry and network of the reaction. The inclusion of all possible elementary steps is essential to an accurate description of the kinetics. In most of the previous theoretical and experimental studies, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is thought of as occurring by the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, involving only two successive dehydrogenation steps in the propane molecule, followed by the desorption of propylene and H2 from the catalyst surface. In this way, the reaction pathway is actually a priori specified and, more importantly, one cannot determine the selectivity toward propylene by means of calculation and simulation without allowing the formation of undesired products, such as methane and ethylene. In PDH, whether propylene would be released from the catalyst surface or undergo deep dehydrogenation is of central importance because it not only determines the yield of propylene but also is intimately related to the amount of coke deposited and hence to the catalyst stability.

5. DFT calculations have been applied in previous studies to determine the energetics of various elementary steps involved in the propane dehydrogenation mechanism over metal catalysts. The calculations provide insights into the most favorable pathways for converting adsorbed propane species into propylene based on the activation energy barriers. For example, the calculations indicate whether sequential hydrogen abstractions from propane are kinetically favored over propylene dehydrogenation into coke precursors. This assists in evaluating the intrinsic selectivity of different catalysts toward propylene production vs. coke formation.

6. Microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation has been conducted to simulate the overall reaction kinetics by taking into account the network of elementary steps and their calculated rate constants. Specific rate equations for each step are combined to model the evolution of surface species coverages and overall rates of propane consumption and propylene production. Models have examined the effects of temperature, pressure, and H2 co-feeding ratio on the kinetics. The simulations provide insights into controlling steps and have suggested optimum conditions for maximizing propylene yield. However, previous models have faced challenges fully reproducing experimentally observed kinetics.

1. The article provides background that propylene is an important petrochemical intermediate traditionally made as a byproduct in ethylene production or refineries. However, increased shale gas availability has altered propylene supply, creating a need for on-purpose production from propane dehydrogenation. Propylene from propane dehydrogenation provides a route to meet market demand.

2. The article explains that catalysts like Pt lower the activation energy barriers for the endothermic propane dehydrogenation reaction. This enables the reaction to proceed at reasonably achievable temperatures. Without a catalyst, the equilibrium position of the reversible reaction limits propylene yields.

3. The article does not introduce specific examples of the major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation.

4. The article discusses how the reaction network and kinetics need to be accurately described, including avoiding a priori assumptions about the mechanism. It notes the importance of selectively producing propylene over deep dehydrogenation into coke precursors. Thermodynamic constraints limit propylene yields, while kinetics impact selectivity.

5. The article describes how DFT has been used to calculate activation energy barriers for elementary steps in proposed propane dehydrogenation mechanisms on metal catalysts. This assists in evaluating intrinsic catalyst selectivity trends.

6. The article discusses previous microkinetic modeling efforts for propane dehydrogenation. The models combine rate equations for elementary steps to simulate overall kinetics and effects of conditions. However, challenges remain in accurately reproducing experimental kinetics. 

7. The article does not describe specific computational or experimental work to identify structure-activity relationships and descriptors correlating catalyst properties to performance.
