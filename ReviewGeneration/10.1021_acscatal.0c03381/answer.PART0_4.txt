[1] "the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes over Pt catalysts is generally accepted to follow a reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism."

[2] "From the TS1 and TS2 in Figure 1a, it can be seen that on Pt(111) propane is dehydrogenated on top of a Pt atom, and the H atom detached from the C3 intermediates is relaxed to either the atop or bridge site."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article explains that catalysts like platinum lower activation energy barriers for propane dehydrogenation through mechanisms like the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, in which propane is dehydrogenated on top of a Pt atom and the detached H atom relaxes to another site.

[1] "the equilibrium position lies too far to the reactant side and the propylene yield is severely limited by thermodynamics." 

[2] "Because of its highly endothermic character under standard conditions at 298 K (ΔG° = 123.8 kJ/mol), the operating temperature of the existing commercial processes is typically kept as high as 800–980 K to achieve a reasonable propane conversion."

[3] "On the other hand, the kinetics of the dehydrogenation reaction were found to be strongly size-dependent."

</quotes>

[1] "DFT calculations have been performed with the VASP (34–36) package using plane-wave basis sets."

[2] "The interactions between valence electrons and ion cores were represented by Blöchl’s all-electron-like projector augmented wave (PAW) method." 

[3] "Transition-state geometries were located by using the minimum-mode following the dimer method, (43) and the transition states were verified by frequency calculations in which only one imaginary frequency was obtained for each transition state."

[1] "Here, we first conducted a microkinetic analysis without adsorbate–adsorbate interactions to reveal the kinetics of PDH over Pt, and the results are presented in Figure 3b."

[2] "In this work, the catalytic behavior of supported Pt catalysts was interpreted in terms of a multifaceted kinetic model, where the coordinatively saturated (terraces) and unsaturated (steps or edges) active sites are represented by the close-packed (111) and stepped (211) surfaces, respectively." 

[3] "The microkinetic analysis in this work was carried out using a modified CatMAP code."
