1. Propylene, which is an important chemical intermediate in the petrochemical industry, has conventionally been produced either as a coproduct to ethylene in steam crackers or as a byproduct in refineries.

2. The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes over Pt catalysts is generally accepted to follow a reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism.

3. Using a microkinetic analysis in combination with results from density functional theory calculations, we show that although propane dehydrogenation (PDH) occurs by two successive dehydrogenation steps on terraces, an unexpected non-reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism accounts for more than half the propylene production at the under-coordinated active sites that dominate the kinetics of PDH. 

4. The main reaction is composed of three dehydrogenation steps that have two β-H atoms and one α-H atom removed from propane, followed by the hydrogenation of CH3CCH2.

5. The proposed mechanism has been verified by exploring several key and general aspects of the kinetic behavior observed in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, and it is found that only when adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are taken into consideration can the experimentally determined kinetics be properly reproduced.
