         [1] "The alumina-supported monometallic Pt catalyst (Pt/Al2O3) used in this work was the same batch as that used in our previous study, which was prepared by the colloid method."

         [2] "The experimental results in Figure 3a indicate that the TOF for propane consumption () is increased by ten times when hydrogen is introduced to the inlet stream with a H2/C3H8 ratio of 1.25 and continued to increase with increasing the ratio." 

         [3] "On the other hand, the effect of the H2/C3H8 ratio on the rate for propylene production differs greatly on Pt(111) and Pt(211), as can be seen in Figure 7a."

      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article evaluates an alumina-supported monometallic Pt catalyst. It provides experimental data on the catalyst's propane consumption and propylene production rates at different H2/C3H8 ratios. The results show that propane consumption rate increases with H2 content, but propylene production rate exhibits different trends on Pt(111) versus Pt(211) surfaces.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         答案:是的,该文评估了一种氧化铝支撑的单金属Pt催化剂。它提供了在不同H2/C3H8比率下该催化剂的丙烷消耗率和丙烯产率的数据。结果显示,随着H2含量的增加,丙烷消耗率增加,但在Pt(111)和Pt(211)表面上,丙烯产率表现出不同的趋势。

         [1] "Because nanoparticles of different sizes and shapes have different relative occurrences of active sites of various types, the TOFs were evaluated on the assumption that the 5.0 nm Pt nanoparticles have an icosahedral shape."
   
         [2] "The activity of Pt(211) is orders of magnitude greater than that of Pt(111), and its selectivity toward propylene decreases steadily with the H2/C3H8 ratio, bearing close resemblance to the experiment. Thus, the under-coordinated Pt atoms cannot be completely deactivated under realistic reaction conditions and are expected to dominate the catalytic behavior of the prepared catalyst, even though terraces have a much higher mole fraction on the catalyst surface."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like particle size, shape, and surface structure affect the performance of the supported Pt catalyst. It shows that the under-coordinated Pt(211) sites are much more active than the close-packed Pt(111) terrace sites, despite having lower surface area. The Pt(211) sites dominate the overall catalytic behavior.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         答案:是的,该文研究了像粒子大小、形状和表面结构等性质如何影响支撑Pt催化剂的性能。它显示具有更多低配位位点的Pt(211)比密排Pt(111)台阶位点活性更高,尽管表面积更低。Pt(211)位点主导了整体催化性能。

         [1] "Through the flux analysis, we find that the conversion from propane to propylene on Pt(111) occurs by the generally accepted reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, and the formation of propylene and byproducts proceed essentially by way of two parallel reactions starting from CH3CHCH3."
      
         [2] "On Pt(211), however, an unexpected reaction pathway is proposed to dominate the kinetics, which consists of three dehydrogenation steps that have two β-H atoms and one α-H atom removed from propane, followed by the hydrogenation of CH3CCH2; at this species, the deep dehydrogenation reaction competes with the production of propylene."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article proposes different mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over Pt(111) versus Pt(211) surfaces. On Pt(111), it follows the reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism with two successive dehydrogenation steps. On Pt(211), an alternative non-reverse pathway is proposed, involving three dehydrogenations and one hydrogenation step.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         答案:是的,该文为Pt(111)与Pt(211)表面上的丙烷脱氢提出了不同的机理途径。在Pt(111)上,它遵循反向Horiuti-Polanyi机理,有两个连续的脱氢步骤。在Pt(211)上,提出了一个非反向途径,包括三个脱氢步骤和一个氢化步骤。
