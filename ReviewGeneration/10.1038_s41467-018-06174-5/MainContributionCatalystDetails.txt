The key points from the document are:

- The document is relevant to propane dehydrogenation. 

- The pivotal catalyst contribution is ZrO2 metal oxide. 

- ZrO2 showed high propene selectivity of 85% and stability for over 13 days.

- The active species is Zr. 

- The feed contained 40 vol% C3H8 in N2 at 1 bar pressure.

- The reaction temperature was 550-625°C.

- No promoters, support material, or alloy details were mentioned. Conversion rate, propane production rate, propylene yield, inlet flow rate, and catalyst loading details were not provided.
