[1] "Such distinctive effects of the reducing agents on the increase in the rate are related to their ability to remove lattice oxygen from ZrO2 as proven by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) tests with H2 or CO (Supplementary Fig. 5)."

[2] "Our DFT calculations also predict that oxygen vacancies are easier formed through removal of lattice oxygen by CO than by H2 (Supplementary Table 3)."

[3] "This result proves that all tested ZrO2 samples mainly possess ionic conductivity."

[4] "The crystallite size is also decisive for the formation of anion vacancies as proven by TPR tests with CO (Fig. 5f)."

Answer: Yes, the article explains how catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers. It describes specific mechanisms where the removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2 by reducing agents like H2 and CO creates oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites that are active for breaking C-H bonds and dehydrogenation. DFT calculations and temperature programmed reduction experiments are used to study these vacancy formation processes.

答:是的,这篇文章解释了催化剂如何通过降低活化能降低丙烷脱氢的难度。它描述了一些具体机制,比如用还原剂像H2和CO从ZrO2中去除晶格氧,形成氧空位和未饱和配位的锆位点,这些位点可以活化断裂C-H键和进行脱氢反应。DFT计算和程控还原实验被用来研究这些空位形成过程。

[1] "With the purpose to derive molecular insights into the kind of the catalytically active sites for propane dehydrogenation to propene over monoclinic ZrO2, we performed DFT calculations."

[2] "The focus was put on the role of Zrcus sites. As the (\(\bar 1\)11) facet represents the most stable surface plane of monoclinic ZrO245,46,47, it was used as the basis for computing stoichiometric (s-ZrO2(\(\bar 1\)11)) and oxygen-defective (d-ZrO2(\(\bar 1\)11)) surfaces." 

[3] "This figure shows that the apparent free energy barrier for propane dehydrogenation over the d- ZrO2(\(\bar 1\)11) facet is 1.66eV lower than that over the s-ZrO2(\(\bar 1\)11) facet (2.52 vs. 4.18eV) thus indicating that the dehydrogenation reaction is kinetically more favoured over the d-ZrO2(\(\bar 1\)11) facet than over the s-ZrO2(\(\bar 1\)11) facet."

Answer: Yes, the article describes how DFT calculations have been applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways. It focuses on modeling ZrO2 surfaces with and without oxygen vacancies to examine their effect on dehydrogenation kinetics. The calculations reveal that surfaces with oxygen vacancies (d-ZrO2) have much lower activation barriers for propane dehydrogenation compared to stoichiometric surfaces (s-ZrO2).
