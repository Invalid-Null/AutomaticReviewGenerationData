[1] Quantum chemical calculations suggest that two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy are responsible for the homolytic CH bond dissociation. 

[2] Methylene CH bond activation in propane: To identify the active sites and the modes of methylene CH bond dissociation on the s-ZrO2(1̅11) surface, we computed this route on a centre consisting either of one Zr site and one O site or two O sites.

[3] In contrast to s-ZrO2(1̅11), methylene CH bond cleavage over d-ZrO2(1̅11) is a homolytic process without involving lattice oxygen. This reaction should occur on two adjacent Zr cations, i.e. Zr5cI and Zr6cII ([Zr5cI, Zr6cII]Ov) or Zr5cI and Zr6cIII ([Zr5cI, Zr6cIII]Ov), and is exothermic by 1.04 or 0.55eV (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 8).

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing active sites that lower the activation energy barriers. DFT calculations revealed that two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy are responsible for homolytic CH bond dissociation of propane, which occurs through a different mechanism compared to the Zr and O site pair on the stoichiometric ZrO2 surface.
