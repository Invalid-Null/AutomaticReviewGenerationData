[1] "Due to the complexity of heterogeneous catalysts, identification of active sites and the ways for their experimental design are not inherently straightforward but important for tailored catalyst preparation."

[2] "Owing to the presence of such defects, this typically non-reducible metal oxide showed unexpectedly high activity in the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene and outperformed the state-of-the-art catalysts possessing supported metal oxides or platinum."

[3] "Its unique performance is related to the presence of surface coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) located at anion vacancies in the lattice of ZrO2."

[4] "Our DFT calculations predict that Zrcus sites open an alternative pathway of propene and hydrogen formation with a lower activation barrier in comparison with non-defect ZrO2."  

[5] "Two Zrcus sites directly participate in homolitic CH bond activation, while lattice oxygen and zirconium cation are required for this process on the stoichiometric surface of ZrO2."

2. Yes, the article explains how catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers. It describes mechanisms involving coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) located at anion vacancies in ZrO2 that provide an alternative pathway with a lower activation barrier compared to stoichiometric ZrO2. Zrcus sites directly participate in homolytic CH bond activation, while lattice oxygen and Zr cations are required on stoichiometric ZrO2 surfaces.

2. 是的,该文解释了催化剂如何通过降低活化能垒来促进丙烷脱氢。它描述了位于ZrO2阳离子空位的配位不饱和Zr阳离子(Zrcus)的机理,该机理相比饱和ZrO2提供了一个较低活化能垒的替代途径。Zrcus位点直接参与均裂CH键的活化,而在饱和ZrO2表面上,需要晶格氧和Zr阳离子。

[1] "To check the importance of oxygen defects for activation of methane, which is the most inert alkane, we computed breaking CH bond over the s-ZrO2(111) and d-ZrO2(111) surfaces."

[2] "All traditional catalysts with supported species of different metal oxides including chromium are less active than ZrO2."  

[3] "The latter also showed higher activity in comparison with doped ZrO2-based catalysts possessing supported Ru."

[4] "Even in comparison with highly active but expensive Pt-based catalysts, ZrO2 proved its outstanding PDH activity."
