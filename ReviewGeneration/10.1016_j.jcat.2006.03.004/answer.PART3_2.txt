[1] "Ga K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements were performed at beamline 17C of the European Synchrotron Radiation facility in Grenoble (ESRF, France)."

[2] "Fig. 2 displays the evolution of the XANES spectra during reduction of TMG/ZSM-5 from room temperature to 793 K in a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen."  

[3] "Fig. 5 shows the XANES spectra on oxidation of reduced TMG/ZSM-5 by nitrous oxide at 473 and 673 K. Clearly, there is a pronounced shift of the Ga K-edge to higher binding energies, due to oxidation of the Ga+ to Ga3+ cations."

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES) at the Ga K-edge to study the oxidation state changes of Ga species during reduction and oxidation treatments. Figures 2 and 5 show the changes in XANES spectra during reduction of TMG/ZSM-5 in H2/N2 and oxidation by N2O, indicating the transformation of Ga species between different oxidation states.
