[1] "Pronounced changes of the XANES region are observed between 573 and 673 K. The main absorption feature shifts to higher energies, whereas a shoulder at lower energy becomes visible at 673 K."

[2] "Clearly, the maximum belonging to Ga+ species slowly vanishes with decreasing temperature, concomitant with an increase of the feature around 10,377 eV."  

</quotes>

6. Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy to probe the oxidation state changes of gallium species during reduction and re-oxidation treatments. It shows that the reduction of dimethylgallium species results first in the formation of gallium hydride species, followed by monovalent Ga+ species at higher temperatures (Quote 1). Cooling the reduced sample leads to re-oxidation of Ga+ species to gallium hydride species (Quote 2).
