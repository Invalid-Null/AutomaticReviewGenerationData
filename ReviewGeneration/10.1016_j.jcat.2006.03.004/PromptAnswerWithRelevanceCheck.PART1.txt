3. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied cationic gallium species. It suggests that propane dehydrogenation occurs via C-H bond activation over monovalent Ga+ species to form a propyl species grafted to the Ga cation along with a hydride (Eq. 10), which then decomposes to propene (Eq. 11). The article also proposes that propane dehydrogenation over GaO+ species may occur via the formation of a pi-complex (Eq. 14), followed by decomposition to propene (Eq. 15).

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

The reaction data suggest that propane was converted over Ga+ cations but not over 
cations. The initial rate of propane dehydrogenation was highest for GaO+ ions, although rapid deactivation was observed, due to the higher barrier for regeneration of GaO+ ions than for formation of less active Ga+ ions.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. Yes, the article proposes that propane dehydrogenation occurs over Ga+ and GaO+ cations, but not over GaH2+ cations. GaO+ shows the highest initial activity but deactivates rapidly. This is attributed to the higher barrier for regenerating GaO+ compared to generating less active Ga+ ions.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

3. 是的,这篇文章提出丙烷脱氢发生在Ga+和GaO+阳离子上,但不发生在GaH2+阳离子上。GaO+显示出最高的初始活性,但快速失活。这是由于再生GaO+ 的能垒比生成活性较低的Ga+离子的能垒更高。
