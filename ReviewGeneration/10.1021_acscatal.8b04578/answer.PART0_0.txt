<quotes>
[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic reaction, and at elevated temperatures side reactions such as cracking, hydrogenolysis, and isomerization are likely to occur."

[2] "To overcome these limitations, Taccardi et al. have recently developed a new type of dehydrogenation catalyst called supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS)."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers. It states that catalytic dehydrogenation is highly endothermic, so side reactions can occur at elevated temperatures. It also introduces SCALMS as a new catalyst class that aims to overcome limitations like cracking and coking.
