<quotes>
[1] "Each sample was first reduced in 1 bar CO at 450 C to remove the passivation layer present on the material."

[2] "The deposition of Pt was obtained by partial galvanic displacement of metallic Ga by Pt2+."

[3] "In general, for all mentioned AIMD simulations at least two independent trajectories were simulated to compare the results."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes reducing samples in CO to remove passivation layers, depositing Pt by galvanic displacement of Ga, and using multiple simulations to compare results and optimize models.

[1] "The DRIFTS measurements were conducted using a high-temperature reactor chamber and Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance accessory (both from Harrick)." 

[2] "The complete setup can be operated in a programmed and automatized way. This makes it possible to perform accurate and simultaneous changes in temperature, pressure, and gas composition and reproduce temperature profiles in a reliable way on different samples."

[3] "In the present work, we combine diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and online gas chromatography (GC) measurements to correlate catalyst performance and the presence of surface sites during the dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "Using CO as a probe molecule, we demonstrate that it is possible to monitor the active Pt sites under operando conditions without affecting the catalytic performance."
