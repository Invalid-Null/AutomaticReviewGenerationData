[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic reaction, and at elevated temperatures side reactions such as cracking, hydrogenolysis, and isomerization are likely to occur."

[2] "To overcome these limitations, Taccardi et al. have recently developed a new type of dehydrogenation catalyst called supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS)."

[3] "The catalytic activity of GaPd IMCs has been proven in previous studies, e.g., for hydrogenation of acetylene and methanol steam reforming."

[4] "It was proposed that isolated noble metal atoms on the surface of the inert, liquid Ga matrix act as catalytically active sites. Thus, SCALMS can be described as a new type of single-atom catalyst (SAC)."

[5] "This study presents a detailed characterization of a Pt-containing SCALMS and comparison with the respective Ga/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 systems under operando conditions."

[6] "To that aim, we investigate Ga/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and Ga37Pt/Al2O3 during propane dehydrogenation using infrared (IR) spectroscopy with the use of CO as probe molecule."

<English version answer>

1. No, the article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

2. No, the article does not investigate tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides for propane dehydrogenation. 

3. No, the article does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts.

4. No, the article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

5. The article evaluates supported Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation under operando conditions using DRIFTS and online GC. The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst shows activity for propane dehydrogenation at temperatures below 300°C, but its performance is limited by carbon poisoning and CO poisoning. 

6. No, the article does not investigate how properties like particle size, shape and support interactions affect supported Pt catalysts.

7. No, the article does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported Pt catalysts.

8. No, the article does not evaluate other supported mono-metallic catalysts.

1. 不是,该文章没有评估任何有前途的金属氧化物催化剂,如Cr2O3、Pt-Sn、Ga2O3,用于丙烷脱氢。

2. 不是,该文章没有研究如何调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧迁移性和酸碱性从而影响丙烷脱氢性能。

3. 不是,该文章没有为所研究的金属氧化物催化剂提出丙烷脱氢的机理场景。 

4. 不是,该文章没有探讨金属氧化物催化剂中金属与载体界面的效应对丙烷脱氢的活性和选择性的调节。

5. 该文章评估了负载Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供了Pt/Al2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应条件下的催化性能数据,使用在线DRIFTS和GC进行表征。Pt/Al2O3催化剂在300°C以下表现出丙烷脱氢活性,但其性能受到碳污染和CO中毒的限制。

6. 不是,该文章没有研究诸如粒径、形状和载体相互作用等因素如何影响负载Pt催化剂。 

7. 不是,该文章没有提出负载Pt催化剂上的丙烷脱氢反应机理途径。

8. 不是,该文章没有评估其他负载单组分金属催化剂。
