         [1] "The catalytic activity of SCALMS has been proven in previous studies, e.g., for hydrogenation of acetylene and methanol steam reforming. (11,16)"

         [2] "In Figure 7 we show the data obtained from the Pt/Al2O3 sample. A pronounced peak is present in the DRIFT spectra, which shifts from 2050 to 2000 cm-1 upon heating."  

         [3] "Small Pt aggregates on the Pt/Al2O3 sample expose mainly intermediate- and low-coordinated Pt sites. These sites are active toward propane dehydrogenation at temperatures even below 300 °C."

         The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides DRIFTS data on Pt/Al2O3 showing a peak for CO adsorbed on Pt sites that shift upon heating. It states small Pt aggregates on Pt/Al2O3 expose intermediate and low coordinated sites that are active for propane dehydrogenation below 300°C.

         该文评估了负载的单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供了Pt/Al2O3上的DRIFTS数据,显示吸附在Pt位点上的CO峰随加热发生位移。文中指出,Pt/Al2O3上的小Pt聚集体暴露出中间配位和低配位位点,这些位点在300°C以下对丙烷脱氢活性很高。

         [1] "This effect is in qualitative agreement with the experiment. An explanation can be derived from the bonding mechanism of CO to the Pt atom, in the framework of the Blyholder model (62) and the density of states (DOS)."

         [2] "The spectra point to the coexistence of GaPt aggregates in a slightly different chemical and/or electronic environment, as there are at least two sites visible giving rise to the bands at 2071 and 2046 cm-1, respectively."

         The article investigates how Pt particle size, shape and interactions with Ga support affect Ga37Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, based on CO IR spectra showing two bands indicating different chemical/electronic environments of GaPt aggregates. DFT calculations using the Blyholder model explain the variations in CO binding.

         根据红外光谱显示两个带,表明GaPt聚集体存在略有不同的化学/电子环境,文中研究了Pt粒子大小、形状和与Ga载体的相互作用如何影响Ga37Pt/Al2O3催化剂。使用Blyholder模型的DFT计算解释了CO结合的变化。

         [1] "According to the Blyholder model, adsorption involves two contributions, namely, electron donation from the CO 5σ orbital to the metal and back-donation from the metal to the CO 2π* orbital."

         [2] "This scenario is reflected by the changes in the DOS before and after CO adsorption for the case of Pt in Ga."

      <English>
         The article proposes a mechanistic pathway for CO adsorption on Ga37Pt/Al2O3 based on the Blyholder model, involving electron donation from CO 5σ to Pt and back-donation from Pt to CO 2π*. DFT calculations show changes in density of states before/after CO adsorption reflecting this mechanism.

         根据Blyholder模型,文中为Ga37Pt/Al2O3上的CO吸附提出了一个机理途径,它包含CO的5σ轨道向Pt提供电子和Pt向CO的2π*轨道回供电子。DFT计算显示CO吸附前后电子态密度的变化反映了这一机理。

         The article does not propose specific mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the supported Pt catalysts beyond CO adsorption. No reaction steps, intermediates or active sites are described.

         除了CO吸附之外,文中没有提出负载Pt催化剂上的丙烷脱氢具体的机理途径。没有描述反应步骤、中间体或活性位点。
