 Here is the comparative analysis of the answer files:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%", 
    "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_2.txt": "70%", 
    "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", 
    "answer.PART1_2.txt": "70%",
    "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"
  },
  "3": {
    "answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_2.txt": "70%",
    "answer.PART1_0.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"  
  },
  "4": {
    "answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_0.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"
  }
}
```

To generate this analysis, I compared the English answers provided in each file to the correct English answers. I calculated a consistency ratio by assessing how similar the concepts and details were between the two answers. A ratio of 100% indicates the file's answer conveys the same information as the correct answer, while 0% means no overlap in content. For intermediate levels of similarity, I estimated a percentage based on the extent of conceptual alignment and presence of key details.
