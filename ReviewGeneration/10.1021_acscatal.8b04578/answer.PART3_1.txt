<English version answer>
Answer: The article utilizes in-situ DRIFTS and online GC to study propane dehydrogenation catalysts under operando conditions. DRIFTS with CO as a probe molecule is used to characterize the active surface sites, while online GC measures activity, conversion, and selectivity. Reactor experiments above 450°C to further examine SCALMS performance are mentioned as future work.
