 Here is the XML structure comparing the consistency between the answer files and the correct answers:

```xml
<questions>
  <question id="1">
    <answer file="answer.PART1_1.txt">0%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART1_4.txt">100%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART1_2.txt">100%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART1_0.txt">100%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART1_3.txt">100%</answer>
  </question>
  <question id="2">
    <answer file="answer.PART1_1.txt">0%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART1_4.txt">100%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART1_2.txt">100%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART1_0.txt">100%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART1_3.txt">100%</answer>
  </question>
  <question id="3">
    <answer file="answer.PART1_1.txt">0%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART1_4.txt">100%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART1_2.txt">100%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART1_0.txt">0%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART1_3.txt">100%</answer>
  </question> 
  <question id="4">
    <answer file="answer.PART1_1.txt">0%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART1_4.txt">100%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART1_2.txt">100%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART1_0.txt">0%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART1_3.txt">100%</answer>
  </question>
</questions>
```

To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key points extracted from the quotes and summaries in each answer file to the correct answers provided. For questions where the answer files contained the same key information as the correct answers, I assigned 100% consistency. For questions where the answer files did not cover the main points from the correct answers, I assigned 0% consistency.

I hope this analysis helps provide useful feedback on the accuracy and completeness of the various answer summaries. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
