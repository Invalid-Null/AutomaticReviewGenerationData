[1] "Conventional methods to produce light olefins are steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other crude oil distillation cuts."

[2] "The catalytic activity of the Ga37Pt/Al2O3 sample is not changed by the presence of CO as compared to the Ar-containing pulses, which in consequence means that the SCALMS system is not affected by CO poisoning."

[3] "According to the GaPt phase diagram, the 37:1 molar mixture melts at temperatures between 270 and 330 °C."

[4] "Independent of the model, both the surface and the NP show one peak for the CO stretching vibration at 2041 and 2040 cm−1, respectively, in agreement with experiments."

[5] "This shift can again be ascribed to coverage-related effects. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that the total area of the CO peak, which can serve as a measure for the CO coverage, is rather stable with increasing temperature, in contrast to the trend observed for Pt/Al2O3."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt for propane dehydrogenation. It studies a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and compares it to a Ga37Pt/Al2O3 SCALMS catalyst. The article provides DRIFTS spectra, DFT calculations, and catalytic performance data. It finds the SCALMS catalyst is more resistant to CO poisoning and has higher activity than the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. The isolated Pt atoms in the Ga matrix of the SCALMS are identified as the active sites by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO. DFT calculations confirm Pt atoms can reach the surface of the Ga matrix.

答:是的,这篇文章评估了Pt等负载单金属催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它研究了Pt/Al2O3催化剂,并与Ga37Pt/Al2O3 SCALMS催化剂进行了比较。该文提供了DRIFTS光谱、DFT计算和催化性能数据。它发现SCALMS催化剂比Pt/Al2O3催化剂更耐CO中毒,活性更高。通过对CO的红外光谱研究证实,SCALMS中Ga基体中的隔离Pt原子是活性位点。DFT计算证实Pt原子可以到达Ga基体的表面。

[1] "The catalytic activity cannot be ascribed to the presence of fully metallic (reduced) Ga, as Ga0 is known to be inactive toward dehydrogenation of alkanes." 

[2] "According to the GaPt phase diagram, the 37:1 molar mixture melts at temperatures between 270 and 330 °C."

[3] "Small Pt aggregates on the Pt/Al2O3 sample expose mainly intermediate- and low-coordinated Pt sites."

[4] "Independent of the model, both the surface and the NP show one peak for the CO stretching vibration at 2041 and 2040 cm−1, respectively, in agreement with experiments."

[5] "This shift can again be ascribed to coverage-related effects. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that the total area of the CO peak, which can serve as a measure for the CO coverage, is rather stable with increasing temperature, in contrast to the trend observed for Pt/Al2O3."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported Pt catalysts. It shows the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exposes mainly intermediate and low-coordinated Pt sites, which are active but also prone to coking. In contrast, the Ga37Pt/Al2O3 SCALMS contains isolated Pt atoms stabilized in the Ga matrix, which are the active sites resistant to coking. DFT and IR spectroscopy confirm the presence of isolated Pt atoms in the SCALMS. The onset of catalytic activity correlates with the melting temperature of the Ga37Pt alloy.

答:是的,这篇文章研究了诸如Pt粒子大小、形状和支撑体相互作用等性质如何影响负载Pt催化剂的性能。它表明Pt/Al2O3催化剂主要暴露中间配位和低配位的Pt位点,这些位点活性高但也易造成焦炭。相比之下,Ga37Pt/Al2O3 SCALMS包含了稳定在Ga基体中的孤立Pt原子,这些是抗焦炭的活性位点。DFT和红外光谱证实了SCALMS中孤立Pt原子的存在。催化活性的开始与Ga37Pt合金的熔点相关。
