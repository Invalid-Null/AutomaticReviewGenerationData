To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key points made in each answer file against the correct answers. The percentages reflect my assessment of how consistent each file's answer is with the correct one. 0% means completely inconsistent, 50% means partially consistent, and 100% means fully consistent. Let me know if you need any clarification on the analysis.
