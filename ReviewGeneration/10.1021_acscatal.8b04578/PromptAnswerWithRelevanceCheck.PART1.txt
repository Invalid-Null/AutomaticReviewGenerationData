<quotes>
[1] "Conventional methods to produce light olefins are steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other crude oil distillation cuts."

[2] "The catalytic activity of the Ga37Pt/Al2O3 sample is not changed by the presence of CO as compared to the Ar-containing pulses, which in consequence means that the SCALMS system is not affected by CO poisoning."

[3] "According to the GaPt phase diagram, the 37:1 molar mixture melts at temperatures between 270 and 330 °C."

[4] "Independent of the model, both the surface and the NP show one peak for the CO stretching vibration at 2041 and 2040 cm−1, respectively, in agreement with experiments."

[5] "This shift can again be ascribed to coverage-related effects. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that the total area of the CO peak, which can serve as a measure for the CO coverage, is rather stable with increasing temperature, in contrast to the trend observed for Pt/Al2O3."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt for propane dehydrogenation. It studies a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and compares it to a Ga37Pt/Al2O3 SCALMS catalyst. The article provides DRIFTS spectra, DFT calculations, and catalytic performance data. It finds the SCALMS catalyst is more resistant to CO poisoning and has higher activity than the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. The isolated Pt atoms in the Ga matrix of the SCALMS are identified as the active sites by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO. DFT calculations confirm Pt atoms can reach the surface of the Ga matrix.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,这篇文章评估了Pt等负载单金属催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它研究了Pt/Al2O3催化剂,并与Ga37Pt/Al2O3 SCALMS催化剂进行了比较。该文提供了DRIFTS光谱、DFT计算和催化性能数据。它发现SCALMS催化剂比Pt/Al2O3催化剂更耐CO中毒,活性更高。通过对CO的红外光谱研究证实,SCALMS中Ga基体中的隔离Pt原子是活性位点。DFT计算证实Pt原子可以到达Ga基体的表面。

[1] "The catalytic activity cannot be ascribed to the presence of fully metallic (reduced) Ga, as Ga0 is known to be inactive toward dehydrogenation of alkanes." 

[2] "According to the GaPt phase diagram, the 37:1 molar mixture melts at temperatures between 270 and 330 °C."

[3] "Small Pt aggregates on the Pt/Al2O3 sample expose mainly intermediate- and low-coordinated Pt sites."

[4] "Independent of the model, both the surface and the NP show one peak for the CO stretching vibration at 2041 and 2040 cm−1, respectively, in agreement with experiments."

[5] "This shift can again be ascribed to coverage-related effects. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that the total area of the CO peak, which can serve as a measure for the CO coverage, is rather stable with increasing temperature, in contrast to the trend observed for Pt/Al2O3."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported Pt catalysts. It shows the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exposes mainly intermediate and low-coordinated Pt sites, which are active but also prone to coking. In contrast, the Ga37Pt/Al2O3 SCALMS contains isolated Pt atoms stabilized in the Ga matrix, which are the active sites resistant to coking. DFT and IR spectroscopy confirm the presence of isolated Pt atoms in the SCALMS. The onset of catalytic activity correlates with the melting temperature of the Ga37Pt alloy.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 
答:是的,这篇文章研究了诸如Pt粒子大小、形状和支撑体相互作用等性质如何影响负载Pt催化剂的性能。它表明Pt/Al2O3催化剂主要暴露中间配位和低配位的Pt位点,这些位点活性高但也易造成焦炭。相比之下,Ga37Pt/Al2O3 SCALMS包含了稳定在Ga基体中的孤立Pt原子,这些是抗焦炭的活性位点。DFT和红外光谱证实了SCALMS中孤立Pt原子的存在。催化活性的开始与Ga37Pt合金的熔点相关。

[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic reaction, and at elevated temperatures side reactions such as cracking, hydrogenolysis, and isomerization are likely to occur."

[2] "To overcome these limitations, Taccardi et al. have recently developed a new type of dehydrogenation catalyst called supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS)."

[3] "The catalytic activity of GaPd IMCs has been proven in previous studies, e.g., for hydrogenation of acetylene and methanol steam reforming."

[4] "It was proposed that isolated noble metal atoms on the surface of the inert, liquid Ga matrix act as catalytically active sites. Thus, SCALMS can be described as a new type of single-atom catalyst (SAC)."

[5] "This study presents a detailed characterization of a Pt-containing SCALMS and comparison with the respective Ga/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 systems under operando conditions."

[6] "To that aim, we investigate Ga/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and Ga37Pt/Al2O3 during propane dehydrogenation using infrared (IR) spectroscopy with the use of CO as probe molecule."

Answer: The article evaluates a supported mono-metallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It provides DRIFTS data showing a pronounced peak shifting from 2050 to 2000 cm-1 during heating, indicating CO adsorption on Pt sites. It also states that small Pt aggregates on Pt/Al2O3 expose intermediate- and low-coordinated sites that are active for propane dehydrogenation below 300°C.

<quotes>
[1] "The spectra point to the coexistence of GaPt aggregates in a slightly different chemical and/or electronic environment, as there are at least two sites visible giving rise to the bands at 2071 and 2046 cm-1, respectively."

[2] "This effect is in qualitative agreement with the experiment. An explanation can be derived from the bonding mechanism of CO to the Pt atom, in the framework of the Blyholder model (62) and the density of states (DOS)."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of the Ga37Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Specifically, it shows two CO adsorption bands at different frequencies, indicating GaPt aggregates in different chemical/electronic environments. It proposes the variations arise from differences in Pt particle size, shape, and interactions with the Ga support, based on DFT calculations using the Blyholder model.

<Chinese version answer>  
回答:本文研究了像金属粒子大小、形状和载体相互作用等属性如何影响Ga37Pt/Al2O3催化剂的性能。具体来说,它显示了两个不同频率的CO吸附带,表明GaPt聚集体处于不同的化学/电子环境中。它根据使用Blyholder模型的DFT计算提出,频率变化源自Pt粒子大小、形状及与Ga载体相互作用的差异。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "According to the Blyholder model, adsorption involves two contributions, namely, electron donation from the CO 5σ orbital to the metal and back-donation from the metal to the CO 2π* orbital." 

[2] "This scenario is reflected by the changes in the DOS before and after CO adsorption for the case of Pt in Ga."

[3] "We assume that these reactive species may affect the charge distribution and, thereby, may also induce shifts of the CO band."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic pathway for CO adsorption on the Ga37Pt/Al2O3 catalyst based on DFT calculations using the Blyholder model. It describes CO adsorption as involving electron donation from CO 5σ to Pt and back-donation from Pt to CO 2π*. The DOS changes before and after CO adsorption reflect this mechanism. It also proposes that hydrocarbon species formed during propane dehydrogenation can affect the charge distribution and induce shifts in the CO bands.
