[1] "The catalytic activity of SCALMS has been proven in previous studies, e.g., for hydrogenation of acetylene and methanol steam reforming. (11,16)"

[2] "In Figure 7 we show the data obtained from the Pt/Al2O3 sample. A pronounced peak is present in the DRIFT spectra, which shifts from 2050 to 2000 cm-1 upon heating."  

[3] "Small Pt aggregates on the Pt/Al2O3 sample expose mainly intermediate- and low-coordinated Pt sites. These sites are active toward propane dehydrogenation at temperatures even below 300 °C."

Answer: The article evaluates a supported mono-metallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It provides DRIFTS data showing a pronounced peak shifting from 2050 to 2000 cm-1 during heating, indicating CO adsorption on Pt sites. It also states that small Pt aggregates on Pt/Al2O3 expose intermediate- and low-coordinated sites that are active for propane dehydrogenation below 300°C.

[1] "The spectra point to the coexistence of GaPt aggregates in a slightly different chemical and/or electronic environment, as there are at least two sites visible giving rise to the bands at 2071 and 2046 cm-1, respectively."

[2] "This effect is in qualitative agreement with the experiment. An explanation can be derived from the bonding mechanism of CO to the Pt atom, in the framework of the Blyholder model (62) and the density of states (DOS)."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of the Ga37Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Specifically, it shows two CO adsorption bands at different frequencies, indicating GaPt aggregates in different chemical/electronic environments. It proposes the variations arise from differences in Pt particle size, shape, and interactions with the Ga support, based on DFT calculations using the Blyholder model.

[1] "According to the Blyholder model, adsorption involves two contributions, namely, electron donation from the CO 5σ orbital to the metal and back-donation from the metal to the CO 2π* orbital." 

[2] "This scenario is reflected by the changes in the DOS before and after CO adsorption for the case of Pt in Ga."

[3] "We assume that these reactive species may affect the charge distribution and, thereby, may also induce shifts of the CO band."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic pathway for CO adsorption on the Ga37Pt/Al2O3 catalyst based on DFT calculations using the Blyholder model. It describes CO adsorption as involving electron donation from CO 5σ to Pt and back-donation from Pt to CO 2π*. The DOS changes before and after CO adsorption reflect this mechanism. It also proposes that hydrocarbon species formed during propane dehydrogenation can affect the charge distribution and induce shifts in the CO bands.
