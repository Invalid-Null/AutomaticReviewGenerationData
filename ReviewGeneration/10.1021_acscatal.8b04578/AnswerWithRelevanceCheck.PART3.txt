         [1] "SCALMS were prepared by deposition of metallic Ga on the support, followed by galvanic displacement with a noble metal salt solution."

         [2] "The deposition of Pt was obtained by partial galvanic displacement of metallic Ga by Pt2+." 

         [3] "This approach helps in the understanding of the spectroscopic properties of CO adsorbed during propane dehydrogenation on SCALMS."

      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it describes the preparation of supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS) by depositing metallic Ga on the support followed by galvanic displacement with Pt salts to disperse Pt species. Operando IR spectroscopy is then used to understand the nature of the active sites.

         [1] "In this study, we apply diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) with CO as a probe molecule to Ga/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and Ga37Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, to investigate in detail the nature of the active Pt species." 

         [2] "We combine diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and online gas chromatography (GC) measurements to correlate catalyst performance and the presence of surface sites during the dehydrogenation reaction."

         [3] "Reactor experiments that examine the catalytic performance of similar SCALMS systems in terms of activity, conversion, and selectivity at temperatures above 450°C are being performed currently and will be reported in a future publication."

      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses DRIFTS with CO as a probe molecule along with online GC to correlate surface sites with catalytic performance during propane dehydrogenation over Ga/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and Ga37Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. Reactor experiments above 450°C are also mentioned for future work.
