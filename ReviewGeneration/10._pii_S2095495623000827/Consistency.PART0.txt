To generate this, I compared each answer file's content to the correct answers for each question. I calculated a consistency ratio by checking if the key points from the correct answer were mentioned in the answer file. For files with no relevant content, the consistency is 0%. For the one file that fully matched the correct answers, the consistency is 100%. The ratios are expressed as percentages and formatted into the expected JSON structure.
