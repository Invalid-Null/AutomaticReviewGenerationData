1. The article provides background on the importance of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation by stating that propylene is an important building block for manufacturing chemicals like polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile. It notes that propane dehydrogenation has emerged as an effective route for propylene production by exploiting abundant shale gas resources.

2. No relevant quotes.

3. The article introduces metal oxides like Cr, V, Ga, and Zn that have been explored as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but notes they show low activity and fast deactivation. It also mentions Pt-based catalysts like commercial PtSn/Al2O3, but states their performance is suboptimal.  

4. The article discusses how propane dehydrogenation is thermodynamically unfavorable and subject to rapid catalyst deactivation. It provides the dissociation energies of the CH, CC, and CO bonds in propane and CO2 molecules.

5. No relevant quotes. 

6. No relevant quotes.

7. No relevant quotes.
