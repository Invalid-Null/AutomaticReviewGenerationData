Finned Zn-MFI zeolite encapsulated noble metal nanoparticle catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095495623000827
AbstractAbstract
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide (CO2-ODP) characterizes the tandem dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with the reduction of the greenhouse gas of CO2 to valuable CO. However, the existing catalyst is limited due to the poor activity and stability, which hinders its industrialization. Herein, we design the finned Zn-MFI zeolite encapsulated noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) as bifunctional catalysts (NPs@Zn-MFI) for CO2-ODP. Characterization results reveal that the Zn2+ species are coordinated with the MFI zeolite matrix as isolated cations and the NPs of Pt, Rh, or RhPt are highly dispersed in the zeolite crystals. The isolated Zn2+ cations are very effective for activating the propane and the small NPs are favorable for activating the CO2, which synergistically promote the selective transformation of propane and CO2 to propylene and CO. As a result, the optimal 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI catalyst shows the best propylene yield, satisfactory CO2 conversion, and long-term stability. Moreover, considering the tunable synergetic effects between the isolated cations and NPs, the developed approach offers a general guideline to design more efficient CO2-ODP catalysts, which is validated by the improved performance of the bifunctional catalysts via simply substituting Sn4+ cations for Zn2+ cations in the MFI zeolite matrix.

1. Introduction
Propylene is an important building block for manufacturing various chemicals such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and other related chemicals or materials [1], [2]. The industrial sources of propylene are mainly from the steam cracking of naphtha and the by-products of the fluid catalytic cracking [2]. Driven by the quick growing demand of the propylene, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as an effective way to produce propylene with the exploitation of the abundant and accessible resource of shale gas [3]. Indeed, the PDH route has been commercialized for decades. However, the unfavorable thermodynamics and the rapid catalyst deactivation make the PDH process less efficient [4]. In contrast, although the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen (O2-ODP) is thermodynamically favored, the teeter-totter phenomenon in the conversion of propane and the selectivity of propylene is commonly observed due to the deep oxidation of the hydrocarbons, which causes a low yield of propylene [5], [6]. Alternatively, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by using CO2 as a mild oxidant (CO2-ODP), which not only alleviates the thermodynamics limitation of PDH but also avoids the deep oxidation issue of O2-ODP, is revealed to be a green process for the production of propylene [5], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. More importantly, the CO2-ODP reaction characterizes in reducing the greenhouse gas of CO2 in tandem with PDH to produce two value-added products of CO and propylene with the water as the only by-product [12], [13]. However, the investigated catalysts for CO2-ODP are commonly metal oxides such as Cr, Ga, V, and Zn, which are essentially derived from those for the PDH reaction. As a result, a low propylene yield and the fast catalyst deactivation are generally reported [14], [15], [16]. This may be mainly originated from the less emphasis paid than deserved on the activation of CO2 molecules, which can be at least partially reflected from the few reports of CO2 conversions in studying CO2-ODP.
Fundamentally, the dissociation energy of CH, CC, and CO bonds in propane and CO2 molecules is around 410.5422.2, 370.3, and 532.2 kJ/mol, respectively [5], [13]. These data indicate that the cleavage of the CC bond is thermodynamically more favorable than that of the CH bond, which substantially decreases the selectivity towards the targeted propylene. If the simultaneous activation of CO2 molecules during CO2-ODP is considered, the situation becomes more severe due to the significantly higher dissociation energy of the CO bond. Thus, the key issue for designing an efficient CO2-ODP catalyst is to effectively activate the thermodynamically more stable CH and CO bonds while the thermodynamically favored CC bonds are kept intact. In this case, CO2 reforming of propane (CRP), which is the side reaction of CO2-ODP, can be inhibited. At the thermodynamically feasible temperatures for both CO2-ODP and CRP, the pioneering work by Chens group clearly differentiates the kinetically active component over CeO2-supported bimetallic catalysts for the two reactions, i.e., the cleavage of CH bonds for CO2-ODP is favored over FeNi composed of oxidized Fe while the split of CC bonds for CRP is preferred over bimetallic NiPt [4]. This is essentially consistent with the understandings of the active sites over Pt-based catalysts for PDH [1], [2]. Very recently, a significantly improved CO2 reduction is reported for CO2-ODP over the ternary Pt-Co-In alloy/CeO2 catalyst with a 3 wt% Pt loading [9].
In fact, significant research efforts have been dedicated to the selective activation of CH bonds for PDH over commercial PtSn/Al2O3 and related catalysts during the last decades [2], [17], [18], [19]. To date, although the trial and error route rather than the desired rational method is still prevailing for designing and screening Pt-based PDH catalysts, the structural and electronic effects on Pt induced from the introduced second metal such as Sn [17], [20], Zn [21], [22], Co [23], and Mn [24] can be considered as one of the key factors in controlling the activity and propylene selectivity of the PDH reaction since that both activating CH bonds for PDH and breaking CC bonds for hydrogenolysis are structural sensitive reactions [20]. If the chemical states of the Pt-based catalysts in the open literature are analyzed, the electron transfer between metallic Pt and the oxide or partially reduced oxide of the added second metal may be revealed as the other crucial factor in determining the PDH performance [21], [22], [23], [24]. This is nicely demonstrated from the PDH results over the CeO2-traped Pt catalysts, in which the addition of Sn into Pt/CeO2 undergoes a sharp transition from the almost 100% selective breaking of CC bonds over Pt/CeO2 to the selective activation of CH bonds over Pt-Sn/CeO2 [1]. These phenomena are generally explained as the structural/electronic effect on the desorption of propylene and/or the change in the rate-determining step of the reaction related to the activation of propane [1], [20]. In essence, this is exactly the case for the zeolite-based catalysts of Pt, Pt-La, or Pt-Sn restricted in zeolite crystals, and the adjustable geometric and/or electronic interaction between noble metals and the zeolite matrix makes PDH high activity, selectivity, and stability [25], [26], [27], [28].
From the molecular orbital characteristics of CO2 molecules, the transition of the linear CO2 molecule to the angled OCO configuration via the electron transfer from the catalyst surface to the empty carbon atom-centered lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) π-orbital is an important route in improving the reactivity of CO2 [29], [30], [31]. As a result, metals as electron donors are quantitatively investigated for catalyzing the conversion of CO2 to chemicals [31], [32], [33]. For enhancing the activation of CO2, the group VIII metals are expected to be good candidates for catalyzing CO2-ODP. Unfortunately, these metals are also good catalysts to break CC, CH, and HH bonds, the selectivity of which is generally dependent on the inherent electronic configuration of the metal, substrates, and reaction conditions. Thus, the electronic/structural modification of the group VIII metals may lead to a good catalyst for CO2-ODP provided that the activity for breaking CC bonds is effectively inhibited.
In comparison with the respective bulk oxide, the isolated coordinately unsaturated metal cations such as Zn2+ [34], Fe3+ [35], Ga3+ [36], [37], and Sn4+ [38] show significantly improved activity and selectivity for splitting CH bonds during PDH although the mechanism is not unambiguously revealed [34], [39]. In this case, the rich topology and microporous nature of zeolites are good hosts to isolate these cations, e.g. Zn2+, Ga3+, and Fe3+, via substituting for the framework Si or Al cations, and a generally high activity for PDH with a high selectivity of propylene is achieved [35], [36].
Based on these analyses and the tandem nature of CO2-ODP for producing propylene with the reduction of CO2 to CO, the assembly of the group VIII metal and the isolated metal cations into a bifunctional catalyst may facitate the selective activation of the CO2 and propane molecules with relatively matched activity if the potential synergetic effect between the two catalytic functions is optimized. In this work, the integration of the group VIII metal with the isolated metal cations in the MFI zeolites is demonstrated for the selective activation of CH and CO bonds for CO2-ODP. The diagram of cooperations between the isolated Zn2+ and the small noble metal nanoparticles (NPs, NPs refers to the noble metal nanoparticles) of Rh, Pt, or RhPt assembled in the pure silica MFI zeolite (silicalite-1) is illustrated in Scheme 1. Significantly, the bifunctional NPs@Zn-MFI catalyst shows a prominently promoted activation of CO2 and an inhibited CRP activity, and the optimal 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI catalyst exhibits the best propylene yield, satisfactoy CO2 conversion, and long-term stability in CO2-ODP. This can be ascribed to the the synergism effects between Rh, Pt, and the isolated Zn2+ cations in the zeolite matrix. In addition, the great potential of the bifunctional catalyst for CO2-ODP is further demonstrated by substituting Sn4+ cations for Zn2+ cations in the MFI zeolite matrix, which clearly emerges the enhanced CO2-ODP performance.

2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Fumed silica (Macklin), tetraacetyl orthosilicate (TEOS, Macklin), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 25 wt% in aqueous solution, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), zinc acetate dihydrate (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), platinic chloride (Macklin, Pt 57%), rhodium chloride tridyhdrate (Macklin, Rh 38.5%42.5%), tetraammine platinum(II) nitrate (Macklin, Pt 50%), tin chloride pentahydrate (Macklin), ethylenediamine (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) solution (PDDA, Mw< 100,000, 35 wt% in water, 100200 cP at 25 C, Aladdin) were used in this work.
2.2. Synthesis of the zeolites
To facilely and concisely prepare the desirable zeolite catalysts, a new method by using the polyelectrolyte of PDDA as an additive was developed in our lab and designated as the polyelectrolyte assisted pseudo-gelatinization (PAPG) methodology [40], and the detailed procedures are given in Scheme S1.
2.2.1. The preparation of Zn-MFI zeolites
The Zn-MFI zeolites were carefully synthesized at a molar ratio of SiO2: TPAOH: Zn(CH3COO)2: PDDA(C8H16NCl): H2O = 1: 0.13: (0.0180.037): 0.030: 6.4. The typical procedure was depicted for the synthesis of Zn-MFI with a Zn content of 3.0 wt%. Firstly, 6.25 g of fumed silica and 12.0 g of TPAOH were mixed together and ground for 15 min. Then, 0.68 g of zinc acetate dihydrate was added into the mixture. Continuing to grind for 15 min, 0.50 g of silicalite-1 seeds were added. After grinding for 20 min, 1.56 g of PDDA and 3.0 mL deionized water were mixed and added into the as-mentioned mixture drop by drop. Finally, the resultant gel was attentively ground into a ball-like shape and transferred into a Teflon-lined steel autoclave for the crystallization at 180 C. After crystallizing for 23 days, the solid sample was thoroughly washed with the deionized water, collected by the filtration, and dried at 80 C for 24 h. The calcination of the solid at 550 C for 6 h leads to the final product of 3.0%Zn-MFI sample. Following the same procedure, Zn-MFI samples with a Zn content of 2.0 or 4.0 wt% were prepared by simply changing the molar ratios of the added chemicals and the obtained zeolite was noted as 2.0%Zn-MFI or 4.0%Zn-MFI. For simplicity and clarity, Zn-MFI with 3.0 wt% Zn is abbreviated as Zn-MFI if it is not specified.
In addition, the pure silica MFI (silicalite-1) zeolites were synthesized via the same procedure as that of the Zn-MFI samples without adding the zinc acetate precursor.
As a reference, the 3.0 wt% Zn supported on the calcined pure silica MFI zeolite, which is abbreviated as Zn/MFI, was also prepared by the impregnation method. Specifically, 0.20 g of zinc acetate dihydrate and 2.0 g of pure silica MFI zeolite were added to 30 g of H2O at the room temperature. After stirring for 2 h, the mixture was heated to and kept at 60 C until the water was completely evaporated. The leaded solid was dried at 80 C for 24 h, and then transferred to a muffle and calcined in the flowing air at 550 C for 6 h.
2.2.2. The synthesis of silicalite-1 seeds
The silicate-1 seeds were synthesized through the conventional hydrothermal method, which employs a starting gel with the molar composition of TEOS: TPAOH: H2O = 1: 0.32: 45, and crystallized at 180 C for 3 days.
2.2.3. The fabrication of Metal@MFI zeolites
The metal@MFI zeolites were carefully synthesized by using the chemicals with a molar ratio of SiO2: TPAOH: metal chloride: ethylenediamine: PDDA(C8H16NCl): H2O = 1: 0.13: (0.7 × 1036 × 103): (0.0140.12): 0.030: 5.9. The procedure was explained in detail for the synthesis of Pt@MFI with a Pt content of 0.50 wt%. Firstly, 6.25 g of fumed silica and 12.0 g of TPAOH were mixed together and ground for 15 min. Then, 0.50 g of silicalite-1 seeds was added into the mixture. After grinding for 20 min, 0.058 g of PtCl4 was added and ground for 10 min, and 0.20 g of ethylenediamine was added drop by drop. After grinding for 20 min, 1.56 g of PDDA and 2.0 mL of the deionized water were mixed and added into the as-mentioned mixture drop by drop. Finally, the resultant gel was attentively ground into a ball and transferred into a Teflon-lined steel autoclave for crystallizing at 180 C for 23 days. After this, the solid sample was thoroughly washed with the deionized water, collected by the filtration, and dried at 80 C for 24 h. The dried product was calcined at 550 C for 6 h in a furnace by flowing air with a ramping rate of 2 C/min. Then, the calcined sample was reduced in 10% H2/Ar (150 mL/min) at 550 C for 2 h, leading to the 0.50%Pt@MFI catalyst. By adding the desired amount of the PtCl4 precursor, Pt@MFI catalysts with varied Pt loadings were obtained. Moreover, the application of the same procedure by using rhodium chloride tridyhdrate as the precursor of Rh leads to the Rh@MFI catalyst with different Rh loadings.
2.2.4. The fabrication of RhPt@MFI zeolites
The RhPt@MFI zeolites were carefully synthesized by using the chemicals with a molar ratio of SiO2: TPAOH: (PtCl4 + RhCl3·3H2O): ethylenediamine: PDDA(C8H16NCl): H2O = 1: 0.13: (0.7 × 1036 × 103): (0.0140.12): 0.030: 5.9. Following the same procedure as the preparation of metal@MFI zeolites, the bimetallic zeolite catalysts of 0.25 wt% Rh and 0.50 wt% Pt (0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@MFI) were obtained.
The synthesis procedures of metal@Zn-MFI, RhPt@Zn-MFI, Pt@Sn-MFI, and Rh@Sn-MFI are similar to Zn-MFI and metal@MFI zeolite, which could be found in the Supporting Information.
2.3. Characterizations
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were carried on a Brucker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer by utilizing a Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The samples were tested from 5 to 80 with a step of 5 /min. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra for the zeolite samples were collected on Nexus 870 infrared spectrometer with a resolution of 4 cm1, and the KBr was used as the background. Ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) spectra for the zeolites were tested by a PerkinElmer Lambda 7500 instrument in the range of 190800 nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the prepared samples were acquired on a Hitachi SU 8220 microscope at 3 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and high-angle annular-dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were achieved by utilizing an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Temperature programmed reduction of H2 (H2-TPR) was conducted on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. Typically, 0.10 g of zeolite was pretreated in flowing of Ar at 400 C for 1 h, and cooled down to 40 C. Then it was purged with 10% H2/Ar for 1 h and the H2-TPR profiles were recorded in flowing of 10% H2/Ar. The data were preserved in the temperature range of 401000 C with a heating rate of 10 C/min. Temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD) was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2950 instrument and the desorbed CO2 was detected by the mass spectrometer (Hidden HPR 20) with of m/z value of 44. Typically, ca. 0.10 g of sample was treated in flowing Ar at 600 C for 1 h, cooled down to 50 C in Ar, and saturated with 10% CO2/Ar. After that, the sample was purged with Ar for 1 h to eliminate the physically adsorbed CO2, and CO2-TPD profiles were recorded in flowing Ar in the temperature range of 50700 C with a heating rate of 10 C/min. The specific surface areas and pore volumes of these zeolite catalysts were characterized on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 with nitrogen adsorption-desorption at 196 C. The data of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) were analyzed on a Perkin-Elmer Optima 2000 spectrometer. H2-chemisorption measurements were conducted on a Micromeretics ASAP 2020C instrument. Prior to measurement, each of zeolites (about 0.10 g) was pretreated at 400 C for 3 h in a dynamic vacuum. Afterwards, the sample was transferred to the analysis station and measured at 60 C after in situ reduction at 430 C. Each measurement was operated 3 times to estimate the experimental error. The H/Pt and H/Rh ratios at zero pressure were determined by extrapolating the linear part of the H2 adsorption isotherm according to the previous literatures [41]. The reasonable assumption is made that the low index planes (100 and 110) of Pt and Rh are equally exposed on the average of the surfaces. Therefore, the surface site densities of Pt and Rh sites for 11.2 and 13.3 site/nm2, the atomic ratio stoichiometry of H/Pt and H/Rh for 1 and 1, and the atomic cross-sectional areas of Pt and Rh for 0.0800 and 0.0752 nm2 are used to estimate their particle sizes. The particle sizes of Pt and Rh are calculated with the formula of d(Pt)H = 2.93W1/X1 and d(Rh)H = 5.35W2/X2, where d(Pt)H and d(Rh)H are Pt and Rh particle size (nm), and W1 and W2 are the weight percentages of Pt and Rh (as ascertained by ICP-OES), and X1 and X2 are the total H2 uptakes (mmol/g) [41], [42], [43], [44]. According to given details, the particle size of RhPt alloy is estimated by referring to the molar ratio compositions of Rh and Pt. The chemical state of Zn, Rh, and Pt in the zeolite catalysts were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an Axis-Ultra DLD instrument. The core-level spectra were recorded using a monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hv = 1486.6 eV). The accurate binding energies for the tested elements were calibrated by the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The measurements of X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were conducted at room temperature in the fluorescent mode with a Lytle detector at beamline 1W1B of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF, China).
2.4. CO2-ODP procedure
The CO2-ODP reaction was performed in a fixed-bed reactor under the atmospheric pressure. Typically, 0.50 g zeolite catalyst was tableted to 2040 mesh and packed between two plugs of quartz wool in the quartz reactor tube (length of 50 cm, internal diameter of 0.80 cm). Once the catalyst was loaded in the reactor, it was pretreated in a He flow of 30 mL/min and the temperature was gradually increased from the room temperature to 600 C with a rate of 10 C/min, and kept at 600 C for 30 min. Then, the reaction was conducted at 600 C and the reaction mixture (C3H8, CO2, N2, and He with a volume ratio of 6: 6: 1.5: 16.5) passed through the catalyst bed at a total flow rate of 30 mL/min. The reactants and products were analyzed on an online gas chromatography by using N2 as an internal standard. The gaseous CO, CO2, and CH4 were separated with HQ and Molsieve 5A columns and detected by the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) while the hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8) were separated by HP-PLOT/Q capillary column (15 m × 0.53 mm) (Agilent, 19095P-QO3) and detected by the flame ionization detector (FID). The conversions of propane and CO2 and the selectivity of propylene were calculated by the equations presented as follows.
where FC3H8, FC3H6, and FCO2 represent the mole flow rate of propane, propylene, and CO2, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characteristics of zeolite catalysts
The steps for synthesizing the zeolite catalysts with MFI structure are illustrated in Scheme S1. Before the polyelectrolyte of PDDA is added, the raw materials are thoroughly mixed by grinding until a mobile emulsion is formed. The emulsion is gradually transformed to the viscous state with the addition of the PDDA, and finally becomes the quasi-solid gels. During the process, cationic PDDA was rapidly adsorbed on the negatively charged silica species via the electrostatic interactions, leading to the special confined nanointerfaces as reported in our previous work [40]. The just formed nanointerfaces are very favorable for the enrichment of the reaction nutrients including organic structure directing agents (OSDAs), silica species, Zn2+, and noble metals, which enables the incorporation of Zn2+ into MFI frameworks and the encapsulation of noble metals into the zeolite crystals during the crystallization. Importantly, the developed route avoids the use of an excessive amount of water to dissolve the raw materials and promotes the crystallization of the zeolites, and the desirable zeolites with well controlled MFI structure are precisely synthesized at high yields close to 100% with very low ratios of OSDAs/SiO2(0.13) and H2O/SiO2(6.4). Following these characteristics, the synthetic strategy is designated as the polyelectrolyte assisted pseudo-gelatinization (PAPG) methodology [40].
The XRD patterns show the characteristic diffractions of MFI topology (Fig. S1) and no peaks for ZnO, Rh, Pt, RhPt species or other phases are observed. These results preliminarily illustrate that the targeted MFI zeolites are successfully synthesized and the Zn and noble metal species are highly dispersed in the as-prepared zeolites. The FT-IR spectra of the representative samples exhibiting the well-defined MFI-type zeolite bands (Fig. S2) confirm the formation of the targeted zeolite. Specifically, the vibration absorption bands centered at 455, 545, and 795 cm1 are ascribed to the SiO bending vibration, pentasil framework vibration, and SiOSi symmetric stretching, respectively [45]. Comparing with the pure silica MFI and Zn/MFI samples, a new peak around 965 cm1 is observed for Zn-MFI, NPs@MFI, NPs@Zn-MFI, RhPt@MFI, and RhPt@Zn-MFI samples. This peak is unambiguously ascribed to the newly formed SiOH defects in the MFI zeolite, which is induced from either the incorporation of Zn2+ cations into the zeolite structure or the encapsulation of the NPs in the MFI zeolite crystals [46], [47].
The morphologies of the silicalite-1 seeds and the as-synthesized MFI zeolite samples are shown in Fig. 1(a and c) and Fig. S3. The pure silica MFI, Pt@MFI, Rh@MFI, and RhPt@MFI show hexagonal appearance and they are similar to the silicalite-1 seeds, and some crystals are interwoven with an average size of about 1.6 m. In the cases of Zn-MFI, Pt@Zn-MFI, Rh@Zn-MFI, and RhPt@Zn-MFI zeolites, they also present a similar size of 11.6 m to the aforementioned MFI zeolites. However, these zeolite samples exhibit finned morphologies, which are very different from the samples without Zn. This suggests that the introduction of zinc precursors in the synthesis gel may significantly influence the kinetics of the zeolite growth under the synthetic conditions. With the addition of zinc precursors, the partial substitution of newly formed SiOZn groups for the pristine SiOSi groups makes great changes of localized configurations of synthesis gels. Moreover, the ionic radius and valence states of zinc (74 pm, +2) and silicon (42 pm, +4) are clearly different. As a result, cationic PDDA exhibits stronger electrostatic interactions with the as-formed zincsilicate species than those with the pristine silica species. Thus, these changes result in the finned morphology of the Zn-MFI samples during the crystallization.

The as-prepared Zn-MFI and its related materials such as Pt@Zn-MFI, Rh@Zn-MFI, and RhPt@Zn-MFI are labled as finned zeolites. Especially, the finned morphology of the as-prepared Zn-MFI and its related materials is very favoable for the diffusion of reactants and products, which may make the improved catalytic performance and stability during the long-term reaction tests.
The specific surface areas and pore volumes for all of the samples exceed 350 m2/g and 0.14 cm3/g (Table S1, Supporting Information), respectively, indicating the high quality of the as-prepared zeolites. From the contents of the Zn, Rh, and Pt in these MFI zeolites (Table S1, Supporting Information), the almost identical value for the contents of Zn designed and measured by ICP-OES in the samples (less than 0.2 wt% difference) indicates that the zinc precursor is almost fully transferred into the zeolites. In contrast, a slight loss of Rh and Pt occurs during the synthetic processes, the extent of which is dependent on the specific noble metal and zeolite compositions.
The TEM and STEM characterizations are employed to visualize the structure and location of the Zn and noble metal species in the zeolite crystals, and the results are displayed in Fig. 1(di) and Figs. S4S6. The low-magnification TEM analysis reaches the same conclusion for the morphology of all MFI derived materials as SEM observations (Figs. S4S6). The clear lattice fringes and fast Fourier transformation (FFT, insets in Fig. 1d and Fig. S6) illustrate the high crystallization of the prepared zeolite samples. Noteworthy, no aggregation of Zn species is distinguished from the HR-TEM images of finned Zn-MFI samples even at the highest Zn loading of 4.0% (Fig. S4). Together with the FT-IR results (Fig. S2), the Zn species are revealed to be successfully incorporated into the MFI zeolite matrix with an atomic-level distribution. In the cases of the NPs@MFI and the finned NPs@Zn-MFI samples, the Pt, Rh, and RhPt NPs are directly observed (Fig. 1dg and Figs. S5 and S6). Moreover, the encapsulation of the NPs in the zeolites crystals is clearly revealed from the HAADF-STEM (Fig. 1h, i and Figs. S5 and S6) with the elemental mapping results of the finned 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI, in which the Zn, Pt, and Rh species are uniformly dispersed in the MFI zeolite matrix (Fig. 1i). The STEM images of NPs@MFI and finned NPs@Zn-MFI further confirm the effective encapsulation of Rh, Pt, and RhPt NPs in the MFI-derived zeolite crystals with a narrow particle-size distribution (Insets in Fig. 1h, and Figs. S5 and S6), of which the average diameter of Rh in 0.50%Rh@MFI and 0.50%Rh@Zn-MFI, Pt in 0.50%Pt@MFI and 0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI, and RhPt in 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@MFI and 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI is determined to be 1.6  0.2 and 1.5  0.2, 5.8  1.0 and 5.1  0.9, and 5.5  0.7 and 3.9  0.6 nm (Fig. 1h and Figs. S5 and S6), respectively. In addition, the H2-chemisorption is also employed to determine the sizes of the noble metal nanoparticles in the MFI and finned Zn-MFI zeolites. As indicated from the results in Table S2, the diameters of the NPs are 1.2  0.2 nm (0.50%Rh@MFI), 2.8  0.3 nm (0.50%Rh@Zn-MFI), 4.1  0.5 nm (0.50%Pt@MFI), 3.7  0.3 nm (0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI), 3.6  0.4 nm (0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@MFI), and 3.5  0.4 nm (0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI), which are very close to those of TEM measurements.
To shed some light on the RhPt structure, the representative finned 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI sample is further investigated by HR-TEM (Fig. 1d and e). The lattice spacing distance of the noble metal NPs is determined to be 2.25 Å, which is between 2.20 and 2.27 Å for the interplanar spacing of Rh (111) and Pt (111) planes, respectively. This indicates that the encapsulation of both Rh and Pt into the Zn-MFI zeolite crystals may generate the RhPt alloy [48]. To visualize the composition of the encapsulated noble metal NPs, the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping measurement is conducted. As shown in Fig. S7, the complete overlapping of Rh and Pt verifies the formation of an RhPt alloy, which is consistent to the co-reduction of the noble metal oxides in the H2-TPR profiles of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 1(jl), the H2-TPR profiles could be divided into two distinctive regions, i.e., the H2-consumption peaks above 550 C ascribed to the reduction of Zn2+ cations into metallic Zn (Fig. 1j and l) and those below 550 C due to the formation of noble metals over the catalysts (Fig. 1k and l). The H2-TPR results (Fig. 1k and l) confirm that the noble metal oxides in MFI and finned Zn-MFI zeolites could be fully reduced to metallic states below 550 C. Noteworthy, the encapsulation of Rh into zeolite crystals shows a significant and sharp reduction peak below 200 C, i.e., 123 C for 0.50%Rh@MFI and 150 C for 0.50%Rh@Zn-MFI. Moreover, a weak reduction peak for 0.25%Rh0.25%Pt@Zn-MFI and an obvious peak for 0.50%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI are observable at the peak maxima of 120 and 127 C, respectively. In contrast, the peak below 200 C is absent for the samples of 0.12%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI and 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI zeolites. Because that the reduction of Pt oxide species for the 0.50%Pt@MFI and 0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI samples mainly occurs in the temperature range of 220550 C, and it obviously reveals that the reduction of Rh oxide species in 0.12%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI and 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI zeolites completely overlaps with the Pt oxide species. Furthermore, the H2 reduction positions of Rh oxide species for 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@MFI are also coincidence with the Pt oxide species. Evidently, the appearance of the co-reduction peaks suggests that the Rh and Pt in the MFI and finned Zn-MFI zeolite crystals with appropriate contents (0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@MFI, 0.12%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI, and 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI) largely form RhPt alloys.
The UV-vis spectra of the as-prepared samples are depicted in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. S8. For the pure silica MFI zeolite, no obvious absorption appears in the whole spectra of 190800 nm. In contrast, a broad absorption band induced from ZnO at about 200 to 400 nm is observed for the Zn/MFI zeolite. In the cases of finned Zn-MFI and NPs@Zn-MFI, an absorption band centered at 196 nm evidently characterizes the charge-transfer transition from O2 to the isolated and tetra coordinated Zn2+ cations in the zeolites [49], [50], [51]. These results further support the incorporation of the Zn2+ cations into the MFI zeolite matrix.

To get more detailed structural information about Zn species in MFI zeolites, the XANES and EXAFS spectra of the samples are collected. As shown in Fig. 2(b and c), the Zn K-edge XANES energies of Zn-containing MFI samples resemble that of the ZnO reference, indicating that the Zn species are exclusively Zn2+ cations. Moreover, the Zn-containing MFI samples produce only a significant peak at around 1.95 Å attributing to the ZnO bond at the Zn K-edge (Fig. 2c) [22]. Meanwhile, the peaks at 2.66 and 3.32 Å, corresponding to ZnZn bonds in Zn foil and ZnO, are not observed in these samples. In contrast, the peaks at around 1.95 and 3.32 Å attributed to ZnO are distinctive appearing over 3.0%Zn/MFI sample. Thus, it is unambiguously confirmed that the Zn species in finned Zn-MFI and its derived materials are exclusively isolated Zn2+ cations in the MFI zeolite matrix.
The chemical states of Zn species in the MFI matrix are further probed by XPS, and the Zn 2p spectra of Zn/MFI and finned Zn-MFI with different Zn contents are provided in Fig. 2(d). The binding energies of 1021.6 and 1044.6 eV over Zn/MFI are assigned to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 of ZnO, respectively. The Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 peaks for finned Zn-MFI with different Zn contents are moved to 1022.7 and 1045.7 eV, which are about 1.1 eV higher than those of the Zn/MFI sample. This strongly evidences that the Zn2+ cations are incorporated into the MFI zeolite matrix as a result of the lower electronegativity of Zn (1.65) than that of Si (1.90), which induces the electron transfer from Zn to the zeolite matrix via the ZnOSi bonds [22], [49], [51]. Accordingly, the decreasing in the valence electron density of Zn is manifested from the increasing in the binding energy. After encapsulating noble metal NPs, the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 peaks of finned 0.50%Rh@Zn-MFI, 0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI, and RhPt@Zn-MFI with different contents of Rh and Pt are generally shifted towards a slightly lower binding energy (Fig. 2d and e), indicative of the electronic interactions between the NPs and the Zn-MFI zeolite matrix, the extent of which is dependent on the nature and content of the noble metals. Noticeably, a slight shift of the binding energy for Pt 4f and Rh 3d over RhPt@MFI and finned RhPt@Zn-MFI zeolites is also clearly observable (Fig. 2fi), which reveals the electron transfers from Pt to Rh [52]. This result robustly demonstrates the strong electronic interactions between the Rh and Pt metals over the alloyed RhPt NPs. In addition, the binding energy of Rh 3d is obviously centered at different regions in MFI (Fig. 2g and i) and finned Zn-MFI (Fig. 2f and h) matrices, suggesting the clear distinction of the two zeolite matrixes. Thus, the incorporation of isolated Zn2+ cations into the zeolite matrix changes the nature of the pure silica MFI zeolite.
According to the characterization results, the desired bifunctional zeolite catalysts are facilely synthesized by the developed method. Moreover, the zinc species are rigorously revealed as isolated Zn2+ cations in the MFI zeolite matrix while the highly dispersed noble metal NPs with a diameter of ca. 12 nm for Rh, ca. 47 nm for Pt, and ca. 36 nm for the RhPt alloy are encapsulated in the zeolite crystals. The noble metals of Rh and Pt with strong electronic interactions are alloyed with appropriate Rh/Pt ratios in the finned Zn-MFI zeolites. Importantly, the isolated Zn2+ cations in the zeolite can generate bridged hydroxyl groups or neighboring silanols (SiOH defects), and the possibly formed structures are shown in Scheme S2. Taking the electrostatic compatibility between zeolite interfaces and the NPs into account, the encapsulated NPs, i.e., Pt, Rh, and RhPt, are very possibly located on the bridged hydroxyl groups or silanols. As a result, the favored tandem reaction of CO2-ODP is expectable from the adjacent spatial locations of the two catalytically active sites within the MFI zeolite crystals.
3.2. Catalytic performance
The catalytic performance of the synthesized samples is comparatively evaluated for CO2-ODP. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the Zn/MFI catalyst prepared by the wetness impregnation method exhibits extremely low activity indexed by the propane conversion for CO2-ODP. In contrast, a significantly increased propane conversion is achieved over the finned Zn-MFI zeolites (about 22% to 30%), the extent of which is clearly dependent on the Zn content over the zeolites. These results indicate that the isolated Zn2+ cations in the MFI framework are considerably more active for CO2-ODP than the supported ZnO. When the CO2 conversion is examined as given in Fig. 3(b), however, it is almost the same over all of the Zn-MFI catalysts (around 3% at steady state), which is slightly higher than that over Zn/MFI (about 1%). This suggests that the conversion of propane to propylene contributed from CO2-ODP is very limited, i.e., PDH rather than CO2-ODP is the main reaction irrespective of finned Zn-MFI or Zn/MFI catalysts. If the selectivity of propylene is compared (Fig. 3a), it is about 86% over 2.0%Zn-MFI and around 76% for 3.0%Zn-MFI and 4.0%Zn-MFI, which are significantly higher than that over Zn/MFI (49%). Thus, Zn-MFI catalysts are much more active and selective than the Zn-supported catalyst for the activation of CH bonds in propane molecules although both of the catalysts are less efficient for activating CO2 molecules. In contrast with the results of finned Zn-MFI catalysts, the MFI encapsulated Rh catalyst (0.50%Rh@MFI, Fig. 3c and d) gives a significantly higher initial propane conversion of 34% and CO2 conversion of about 12%. However, the selectivity of propylene is only about 38%, which is consistent with the favorable CRP reaction of Rh via breaking both the CC and CH bonds in propane molecules. In the case of 0.50%Pt@MFI, the encapsulated Pt is still favorable for CRP reaction although its activity is significantly lower than that of the Rh. These observations are generally agreeable with the reports over the Pt-supported catalysts [1], [4]. Amazingly, the incorporation of Pt into the finned 3.0%Zn-MFI zeolite crystals, i.e., 0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI (Fig. 3e and f), leads to a slightly higher propane conversion (29%), a significantly higher CO2 conversion (9%), and a clearly higher selectivity of propylene (87%) than those over the 3.0%Zn-MFI catalyst. If the results are compared with those over 0.50%Pt@MFI, the changes become more significant. By increasing the Pt content to 0.75% (0.75%Pt@Zn-MFI, Fig. 3e and f), almost the same catalytic performance as that over 0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI is obtained, indicating a negligible effect of the slightly increased Pt loading on the catalytic performance. These results clearly manifest that the selective activation of propane and CO2 is favored over Pt@Zn-MFI catalysts, highlighting the synergetic effect between the encapsulated Pt NPs and the isolated Zn2+ cations in the MFI zeolite matrix. Simultaneously, the noble metals of Ru, Pd, Ir, and Au with the same weight percentage as Pt (0.50 wt%) are also respectively encapsulated into the Zn-MFI zeolite using the identical synthesis strategy. The catalytic properties of the as-prepared Ru@Zn-MFI, Pd@Zn-MFI, Ir@Zn-MFI, and Au@Zn-MFI catalysts also illustrate the consistent conclusion with the Pt@Zn-MFI in the CO2-ODP (Fig. S9). If the results over Rh@Zn-MFI are compared (Fig. 3af), the same conclusion can still be reached although the activity of Rh@Zn-MFI for the CRP reaction is obviously higher than that of Pt@Zn-MFI as directly reflected from the much lower selectivity of propylene at the initial stage of the reaction (47%, Fig. 3e and Table S3).

Reaction conditions: 600 C, 0.50 g of zeolite catalyst, 6 mL/min for the flow rates of propane, 6 mL/min of CO2, 1.5 mL/min of N2 as the internal standard, and 16.5 mL/min of helium.
Inspired by these results, we speculate that the selective activation of propane and CO2 may be enhanced by adding Rh into Pt. Although the catalytic performance of 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@MFI closely resembles that of the 0.50%Pt@MFI zeolite (Fig. 3c and d), the remarkably enhanced CO2-ODP performance is achieved over 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI, i.e., about 48%, 23%, and 60% for the initial conversions of propane and CO2 and the selectively of propylene, respectively. These promising results motivated us to optimize the RhPt@Zn-MFI catalyst. As shown in Fig. 3(g and h), the selectivity of propylene and the CO2 conversion over finned RhPt@Zn-MFI with different Pt or Rh contents are clearly changed in a reverse way although the propane conversion is slightly altered, leading to the highest initial propylene yield of 29% over 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI (Fig. 3i). Noteworthy, 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI zeolite gives markedly better propylene yield and higher CO2 conversion than either the finned Zn-MFI or Pt@Zn-MFI catalysts (Fig. 3b, f, h, i and Table S3), and it also exhibits an appreciable stability for a relatively long time-on-stream (TOS) of about 20 h (Fig. S10).
The regeneration activity of the 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI catalysts is also investigated. After the completion of each run, the reacted 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI is first calcined in air flow (30 mL/min) with linear heating (5 C/min) to 500 C and holding for 1 h to remove the coke, and then the temperature decreases to 25 C under He atmosphere. Subsequently, the catalyst is reduced in the flowing of 10%H2/He (30 mL/min) with linear heating (5 C/min) to 550 C and keeping for 2 h. After the reduction process, the catalyst is purged with the flowing of He (30 mL/min) for 0.5 h, and then heated to the reaction temperature for the catalytic tests. It shows that the regenerated catalyst kept approximately 81% of an initial propane conversion and maintained high propylene selectivity (Fig. 4). After two regeneration processes, the 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI catalyst showed similar initial propane conversion and propylene selectivity to the first regeneration cycle. The results indicate that the 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI catalyst nearly has no loss of some activity during the regeneration procedures. In addition, the catalytic performances of finned 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI zeolite in the presence and absence of CO2 are compared (Fig. S11). Indeed, the merits of CO2-ODP are clearly reflected from the higher selectivity of propylene and retarded decrease of the propane conversion with increasing TOS. The catalytic results nicely reveal the importance of the noble metal or alloy, the isolated Zn2+ cations, and the MFI zeolite matrix in determining the CO2-ODP performance of the bifunctional catalyst. Moreover, the synergy between the isolated Zn2+ cations and the encapsulated NPs in the MFI zeolite, and the easily adjustable Rh and Pt compositions for optimizing the electronic interactions offer a great room to optimize the selective activation of CO and CH bonds with inhibited activation of CC bonds for a high-performance CO2-ODP catalyst, which is discussed as follows with the structural properties of the bifunctional catalysts.

Fig. 4. The conversion of propane, selectivity of propylene, CO2 conversion, and propylene yield of regeneration tests over finned 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI zeolite. Reaction conditions: 600 C, 0.50 g of zeolite catalyst, 6 mL/min for the flow rates of propane, 6 mL/min of CO2, 1.5 mL/min of N2 as the internal standard, and 16.5 mL/min of helium.
As a common fact, the overwhelming majority of the CO2-ODP catalysts including Cr, V, In, and Ga oxides is originated from the PDH reaction, the consideration of which is concentrated on the selective breaking of CH bonds in propane without paying more than enough attention to the activation of CO2 molecules [8], [12], [53], [54]. As a result, these oxides generally show unsatisfactory catalytic activity and stability for CO2-ODP [55], [56]. Although the addition of Pd into a representative reducible oxide of CeZrAlOx is reported to increase the propylene selectivity via enhancing the redox cycles of the oxide, the CO2 conversion is not provided and considered [57]. Thanks to the theoretical and experimental efforts, the donation of electrons from transition metals such as Pt, Au, Rh, Cu, Ni, Fe, and their alloys to CO2 molecules is commonly believed to be one of the most important routes to activate CO bonds, which makes it possible for converting CO2 to value-added chemicals [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]. However, these metallic electron donors are also active to the cleavage of both CC and CH bonds during the CO2-ODP as revealed from the pioneering works [12], [58]. Thus, it is of great importance to rationally construct the bifunctional active sites within a distinctive matrix that can selectively break the CO and CH bonds and preserve the CC bonds provided that the potential electronic, structural, and the intimate effects of the catalytic functions and the associated matrix can be optimized.
Following our assumptions, the thus mentioned bifunctional zeolite catalysts are deliberately synthesized. The finned Zn-MFI zeolite is designated mainly for the selective activation of the CH bonds in propane molecules, and the formation of the isolated Zn2+ cations in the zeolite matrix is confirmed from the characterization results (Fig. 2ae and Figs. S2 and S8). Moreover, the key role of the isolated Zn2+ cations in MFI crystal for the selective activation of the CH bonds in propane is clearly revealed from the comparative results over the Zn/MFI catalyst (Fig. 3a). Thus, the isolated Zn2+ cations are active and selective for breaking the CH bonds during CO2-ODP as a result of the confinement effect of the zeolite matrix.
In the case of the encapsulated NPs of Pt or Rh in zeolite crystals, they are primarily devoted to activating the CO2 molecules. Indeed, the characterization results confirm that Rh NPs of 1.6  0.2 nm (Fig. S5a) and Pt NPs of 5.8  1.0 nm (Fig. S5b) are highly dispersed in the MFI crystals. Moreover, the CO2-TPD results indicate that the adsorption of CO2 is really enhanced by encapsulating either Pt or Rh NPs into the MFI zeolite although the extent over Rh@MFI is more significant (Fig. 5a). However, the breaking of both the CC and CH bonds in propane molecules happens clearly over the 0.50%Pt@MFI catalyst, and the cleavage of CC and CH bonds together with CO bonds in CO2 molecules occurs more significantly over 0.50%Rh@MFI catalyst (Fig. 3c and d). This is essentially agreeable with the non-selective nature of the supported noble metals for the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes as reported in previous works [1], [17], [22]. Moreover, the more significant CRP performance over 0.50%Rh@MFI than that over 0.50%Pt@MFI during CO2ODP can reasonably be ascribed to the differences in the nature of the noble metals and their particle sizes. Contrary to 0.50%Pt@MFI or 0.50%Rh@MFI, the selective activation of CH bonds in propane molecules and CO bonds in CO2 molecules with significantly inhibited breaking of CC bonds is achieved over 0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI catalyst, and the same phenomenon occurs over 0.50%Rh@Zn-MFI although the extent for the inhibited cleavage of CC bonds is less significant (Fig. 3e and f). Because the particle sizes and their distributions of Rh or Pt nanoparticles are essentially independent on the zeolite matrix of MFI or finned Zn-MFI (Figs. S5 and S6), the phase cooperation and the emergence of synergetic effects between the encapsulated NPs and the isolated Zn2+ cations in the MFI zeolites can be proposed to be responsible for the selective activation of CH bonds in propane molecules and CO bonds in CO2 molecules (Fig. 3e and f). This is further supported by the enhanced CO2 adsorption in different extents over the finned Zn-MFI and the Pt or Rh encapsulated finned Zn-MFI samples if the CO2-TPD results are analyzed (Fig. 5a). As revealed from the characterization results (Fig. 2 and Figs. S2 and S8), the Pt or Rh NPs are very possibly laid on the bridged hydroxyl groups induced from the isolated Zn2+ cations in the MFI zeolite matrix. As a result, the Pt or Rh NPs are expected to be separated from the isolated Zn2+ by the bridged hydroxyl groups (Scheme S2). Thus, the synergetic effect originates very possibly from the intimate contact between the NPs and Zn2+ cations in the MFI framework.

If the catalytic results over 0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI and 0.50%Rh@Zn-MFI (Fig. 3e and f) are compared, the differences in the conversions of propane and CO2 and the propylene selectivity may also be contributed from the variance in the electronic charge density of the noble metal. This is confirmed from the fact of the highly dispersed Pt, Rh, and RhPt alloy with similar particle sizes (Fig. 1h and Figs. S5 and S6) vs. the decreased propylene yield in the order of 0.50%Rh@Zn-MFI < 0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI < 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI (Fig. 3i). Moreover, this explanation is supported by the catalytic results over RhPt@Zn-MFI with different Rh and Pt contents (Fig. 3gi). Noteworthy, the 0.25%Rh0.25%Pt@Zn-MFI catalyst shows a slightly higher propylene yield than the 0.50%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI zeolite (Fig. 3i) although the CO2 conversion over 0.25%Rh0.25%Pt@Zn-MFI is much lower (Fig. 3h). Thus, taking the bifunctional characteristics, the electronic charge density of the metal or alloy, and the synergetic and intimate effects between the noble metal and the isolated Zn2+ cations into account, the best performance of the 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI zeolite for CO2-ODP can be explained.
In addition, considering the bifunctional nature of the finned NPs@Zn-MFI catalyst and the versatility in the metals and their easily tunable contents, a more efficient catalyst for CO2-ODP is reasonably expected providing the optimization of the the isolated metal cations, NPs and their loadings, and the electron and structure effects between the noble metals and isolated metal cations. To demonstrate this, we synthesized 0.50%Rh@3.0%Sn-MFI and 0.50%Pt@3.0%Sn-MFI by substituting Sn4+ cations for Zn2+ cations in the MFI framework. Significantly, the 0.50%Pt@3.0%Sn-MFI and 0.50%Rh@3.0%Sn-MFI catalysts show much higher and more stable propane conversion (Fig. 6) than 0.50%Rh@Zn-MFI (Fig. 3e and f). Moreover, the significantly higher propylene selectivity of above 90% is achieved over 0.50%Pt@3.0%Sn-MFI and 0.50%Rh@3.0%Sn-MFI (Fig. 6) than that of about 70% over 0.50%Rh@Zn-MFI (Fig. 3e). Meanwhile, the pristine Sn-MFI exhibits the relatively low activity for CO2-ODP, which demonstrates the importance of the encapsulated noble metals and the bifunctionality of the NPs@Sn-MFI catalyst (Fig. S12). The TEM and STEM images of 0.50%Pt@3.0%Sn-MFI show that the Pt nanoparticles with an average diameter of 1.1 nm are highly dispersed in the Sn-MFI matrix (Fig. S13). Thus, these preliminary results rigorously reveal the great optimization potential of the NPs@metal cation-MFI bifunctional catalyst, which is worthy to be further studied as a very promising high-performance CO2-ODP catalyst.

Reaction conditions: 600 C, 0.50 g of zeolite catalyst, 6 mL/min for the flow rates of propane, 6 mL/min of CO2, 1.5 mL/min of N2 as the internal standard, and 16.5 mL/min of helium.
To show the superior CO2-ODP performance of the bifunctional zeolite catalysts, the proplyene yield and the rates for the conversion of propane and the formation of propylene are calculated, the results of which are summarized in Tables S3 and S4 together with the representative results of typical catalysts reported in the references. Irrespective of the propylene yield, the rate for the conversion propane or the formation of propylene, our developed NPs@metal cation-MFI bifunctional catalysts are the best in comparison with the referenced results over oxide based catalysts including VOx and CrOx or noble metal based catalysts. For example, the 0.50%Pt@3.0%Sn-MFI bifunctional catalyst (Entry 31, Table S3) presents the highest propylene yield of 65.1% among all of the catalysts. Apparently, the recently reported 3%Pt-Co-In/CeO2 catalyst (Entry 33 and 34, Table S3) shows the highest rate for the conversion of propane or the formation of propylene. However, if the Pt loading over the catalysts is taken into account, as shown in Table S4, the specific rates are still the highest over the 0.50%Pt@3.0%Sn-MFI bifunctional catalyst, which are approximately twice to those over the 3%Pt-Co-In/CeO2 catalyst. Thus, the newly developed NPs@metal cation-MFI bifunctional catalysts are very promising for CO2-ODP.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the robust bifunctional catalysts of NPs@Zn-MFI zeolites for CO2-ODP are designed and precisely synthesized. The isolated Zn2+ cations and highly dispersed NPs in the MFI zeolite matrix are rigorously revealed to be responsible for the selective activation of propane and CO2 molecules in the reactants. As a result of the synergistically electronic and structural effects between Rh, Pt, and the isolated Zn2+ cations in the MFI zeolite matrix, the optimized 0.25%Rh0.50%Pt@Zn-MFI catalyst is active, selective, and stable for CO2-ODP. Considering the versatile choice and the combination of noble metal or alloy and isolated cations, the tailoring of the bifunctional zeolite catalyst is expected to be an important strategy to construct more efficient catalysts for the oxidative reactions by using CO2 as a soft oxidant. The clearly improved CO2-ODP performance by substituting Sn4+ cations for Zn2+ cations in the MFI zeolite matrix verifies the great potential of the bifunctional catalyst promising for CO2-ODP.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
