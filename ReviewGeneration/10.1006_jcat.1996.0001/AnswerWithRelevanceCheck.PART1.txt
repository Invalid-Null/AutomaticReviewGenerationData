         [1] "Pt and PtSn catalysts supported on SiO2and γ-Al2O3and prepared by impregnation have been studied"

         [2] "Without the promoter Pt shows the same initial specific activity on both supports"

         The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It studies Pt catalysts supported on SiO2 and γ-Al2O3 prepared by impregnation. Data shows Pt has the same initial specific activity on both supports, but deactivates rapidly due to coking without a promoter.

         文章评估了用于丙烷脱氢的单金属Pt催化剂。它研究了浸渍法制备的SiO2和γ-Al2O3支撑的Pt催化剂。数据显示,在两种支撑物上Pt具有相同的初始特定活性,但由于没有促进剂而快速失活。

           [1] "On γ-Al2O3tin interacts with the support and is stabilized in an oxidation state >0. The result is an increase in Pt dispersion and an improved stability of the catalytic activity without any change in the initial specific activity in dehydrogenation."

           [2] "On SiO2the Sn is more readily reduced, and alloy formation is possible. This leads to a similar increase in Pt dispersion and improved catalytic stability, but also to a strong reduction in the specific activity."

           The article investigates how properties like Pt dispersion, metal-support interactions and alloy formation affect performance of supported PtSn catalysts. Adding Sn increases Pt dispersion and stability on both supports. But on SiO2, Sn reduction causes alloy formation and loss of activity, while on γ-Al2O3 Sn interacts with support avoiding reduction and activity loss.

           文章调查了Pt分散度、金属支持物相互作用和合金形成等性质如何影响支撑PtSn催化剂的性能。在两种支撑物上添加Sn均可提高Pt分散度和稳定性。但在SiO2上,Sn的还原导致合金形成和活性损失,而在γ-Al2O3上,Sn与支撑物相互作用防止还原和活性损失。
