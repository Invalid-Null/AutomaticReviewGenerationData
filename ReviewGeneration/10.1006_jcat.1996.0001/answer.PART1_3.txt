[1] "Pt and PtSn catalysts supported on SiO2and γ-Al2O3and prepared by impregnation have been studied by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), hydrogen chemisorption, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "On γ-Al2O3tin interacts with the support and is stabilized in an oxidation state >0. The result is an increase in Pt dispersion and an improved stability of the catalytic activity without any change in the initial specific activity in dehydrogenation."

[3] "On SiO2the Sn is more readily reduced, and alloy formation is possible. This leads to a similar increase in Pt dispersion and improved catalytic stability, but also to a strong reduction in the specific activity."

[4] "The change in catalytic stability on both supports is paralleled by a dramatic change in the hydrogen adsorption properties, as seen from the TPD profiles after reduction."

[5] "Without the promoter Pt shows the same initial specific activity on both supports, but deactivates rapidly due to coking."
