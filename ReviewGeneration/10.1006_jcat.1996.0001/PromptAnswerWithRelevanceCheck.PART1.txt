Answer: 是的,本文评价了单金属Pt催化剂(支撑在SiO2和γ-Al2O3上)用于丙烷脱氢。研究了浸渍法制备的这些Pt催化剂。数据显示Pt在两种载体上的初始比活性相同,但由于结焦快速失活。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "The effect of Sn as a promoter depends on the support. On γ-Al2O3tin interacts with the support and is stabilized in an oxidation state >0. The result is an increase in Pt dispersion and an improved stability of the catalytic activity without any change in the initial specific activity in dehydrogenation." 

[2] "On SiO2the Sn is more readily reduced, and alloy formation is possible. This leads to a similar increase in Pt dispersion and improved catalytic stability, but also to a strong reduction in the specific activity."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article does investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported PtSn catalysts. It shows adding Sn increases Pt dispersion and improves stability on both SiO2 and γ-Al2O3 supports. But on SiO2, Sn reduction leads to alloy formation which reduces initial specific activity, while on γ-Al2O3 Sn interacts with support and does not reduce, avoiding activity loss.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 

Answer: 是的,本文确实研究了如金属颗粒大小、形状以及载体间相互作用等性质如何影响支撑PtSn催化剂的性能。结果显示,在SiO2和γ-Al2O3载体上添加Sn可提高Pt的分散性并改善稳定性。但在SiO2上,Sn的还原导致合金形成,降低了初始比活性,而在γ-Al2O3上,Sn与载体相互作用没有被还原,避免了活性损失。
