<quotes>
[1] "Pt and PtSn catalysts supported on SiO2and γ-Al2O3and prepared by impregnation have been studied"

[2] "On γ-Al2O3tin interacts with the support and is stabilized in an oxidation state >0. The result is an increase in Pt dispersion"

[3] "On SiO2the Sn is more readily reduced, and alloy formation is possible. This leads to a similar increase in Pt dispersion"
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies Pt and PtSn catalysts supported on SiO2 and γ-Al2O3 prepared by impregnation. The addition of Sn as a promoter increases Pt dispersion on both supports. On γ-Al2O3, Sn interacts with the support and is stabilized in a higher oxidation state, resulting in increased Pt dispersion. On SiO2, Sn is more readily reduced, allowing alloy formation with Pt and leading to similar improvements in dispersion.

Answer: 是的,本文探讨了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它研究了载于SiO2和γ-Al2O3上的浸渍制备的Pt和PtSn催化剂。 Sn作为助剂的添加在两种支撑体上都增加了Pt的分散。在γ-Al2O3上,Sn与支撑体发生作用,稳定在更高的氧化态,从而增加Pt分散。 在SiO2上,Sn更容易被还原,允许与Pt形成合金,从而导致类似的分散性改善。
