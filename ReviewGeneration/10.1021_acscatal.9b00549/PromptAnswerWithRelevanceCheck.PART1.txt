[1] "For the monometallic catalysts, there is a very sharp decrease in selectivity as the conversion increases. For monometallic Pt (without H2), the selectivity is around 88% at 10% conversion, which decreases to about 72% at 25% conversion."

[2] "The bimetallic PtCo samples, on the other hand, showed a very different trend in comparison to monometallic Pt and Co. As the conversion increases, all of the bimetallic samples showed a slight decrease in the selectivity." 

[3] "The 2Pt0.6Co catalyst maintained a constant selectivity at 96% from 10% to 25% conversion."

[4] "Both 2Pt1Co and 2Pt2Co catalyst, from 10% to 20% conversion, had a selectivity similar to that of 2Pt0.6Co, at 96% selectivity."

[1] "Bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared and characterized by scanning transmission electron microscopy, in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and catalytic conversion for propane dehydrogenation with and without added H2."

[2] "At low Co loading, the bimetallic nanoparticles form a Pt3Co intermetallic surface alloy with Pt-rich core."

[3] "As the Co content increased, the catalyst composition formed a full Pt3Co phase with the excess excess CoII remaining on the silica." 

[4] "Further increases in Co lead to a PtCo alloy phase in the core, despite the surface remaining as Pt3Co."

[5] "At high Co loadings, the Co in excess of that needed for bimetallic alloy formation resulted in large monometallic Co nanoparticles."

[6] "Despite the different nanostructures in these catalysts, the catalytic surface in each of these catalysts had a Pt3Co structure."

8. The article systematically investigates bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles supported on silica for propane dehydrogenation. At low Co loading, the nanoparticles form a Pt3Co intermetallic surface alloy with a Pt-rich core. As Co content increases, a full Pt3Co phase forms, then a PtCo core develops covered by a Pt3Co surface layer. At high Co loadings, excess Co forms large monometallic Co nanoparticles. Despite the different structures, all catalysts maintain a Pt3Co catalytic surface.

[1] "All of the bimetallic PtCo catalysts have significantly improved olefin selectivity, generally greater than about 95% in the absence of H2."

[2] "Pt is reduced at a much lower temperature (250 C) than for Co (750 C). Thus, it is likely that small Pt nanoparticles are initially formed."  

[3] "the catalytic surface in each of these catalysts had a Pt3Co structure."

[4] "The high olefin selectivity of the surface Pt3Co is suggested to be due to geometric effects, where there are smaller PtPt ensembles, as well as a decrease in the energy of the Pt 5d orbitals in comparison to that in monometallic Pt."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4-6. The article evaluates supported monometallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that small Pt nanoparticles around 2 nm in size are initially formed on the silica support. Bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles are then created, with Pt3Co surface structure in all cases. The Pt3Co surface leads to high propylene selectivity over 95% due to both ensemble size effects breaking up large Pt domains as well as electronic effects decreasing the Pt 5d orbital energies.

[4] "The high selectivity was maintained at high conversion and in the presence of cofed H2."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

7-8. The article shows that despite differences in the core nanostructure, the Pt3Co surface structure remains constant across the PtCo catalysts studied. This uniform Pt3Co surface leads to high propylene selectivity over 90% that is maintained even at high conversion and under cofeeding of H2. The surface structure controls the selectivity, with the Pt3Co geometry breaking up Pt ensembles.
