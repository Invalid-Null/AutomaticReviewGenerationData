<quotes>
[1] "For the monometallic catalysts, there is a very sharp decrease in selectivity as the conversion increases. For monometallic Pt (without H2), the selectivity is around 88% at 10% conversion, which decreases to about 72% at 25% conversion."

[2] "The bimetallic PtCo samples, on the other hand, showed a very different trend in comparison to monometallic Pt and Co. As the conversion increases, all of the bimetallic samples showed a slight decrease in the selectivity." 

[3] "The 2Pt0.6Co catalyst maintained a constant selectivity at 96% from 10% to 25% conversion."

[4] "Both 2Pt1Co and 2Pt2Co catalyst, from 10% to 20% conversion, had a selectivity similar to that of 2Pt0.6Co, at 96% selectivity."

[5] "Despite the large fraction of metallic Co in 2Pt4Co, this catalyst also had a constant selectivity of around 92% from 10% to 20% conversion."

5. Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing monometallic Pt has a selectivity of around 88% at 10% conversion, decreasing to 72% at 25% conversion. In contrast, the supported bimetallic PtCo catalysts maintained much higher and constant selectivity of 92-96% across a similar conversion range.
