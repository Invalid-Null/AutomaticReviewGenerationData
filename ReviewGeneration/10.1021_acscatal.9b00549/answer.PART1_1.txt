[1] "This leads to a decrease in the rate of the structure-sensitive hydrogenolysis, while it has little effect on the rate of the structure-insensitive dehydrogenation reaction." 

[2] "The high olefin selectivity of the surface Pt3Co is suggested to be due to geometric effects, where there are smaller PtPt ensembles, as well as a decrease in the energy of the Pt 5d orbitals in comparison to that in monometallic Pt."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like particle size and shape affect the performance of Pt/SiO2 catalysts. It finds smaller Pt ensembles in Pt3Co lead to lower hydrogenolysis rates and higher olefin selectivity. The electronic structure of Pt is also modified in the alloy.
