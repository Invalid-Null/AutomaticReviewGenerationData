<quotes>

[1] "Monometallic Pt and Co catalysts were also prepared for comparison."

[2] "For the monometallic catalysts, there is a very sharp decrease in selectivity as the conversion increases." 

[3] "For monometallic Pt (without H2), the selectivity is around 88% at 10% conversion, which decreases to about 72% at 25% conversion. For the monometallic Co, the selectivity is even lower, about 60% at 10% conversion."

[1] "Bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared and characterized by scanning transmission electron microscopy, in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and catalytic conversion for propane dehydrogenation with and without added H2."

[2] "At low Co loading, the bimetallic nanoparticles form a Pt3Co intermetallic surface alloy with Pt-rich core."

[3] "As the Co content increased, the catalyst composition formed a full Pt3Co phase with the excess excess CoII remaining on the silica." 

[4] "Further increases in Co lead to a PtCo alloy phase in the core, despite the surface remaining as Pt3Co."

[5] "At high Co loadings, the Co in excess of that needed for bimetallic alloy formation resulted in large monometallic Co nanoparticles."

[6] "Despite the different nanostructures in these catalysts, the catalytic surface in each of these catalysts had a Pt3Co structure."

8. The article systematically investigates bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles supported on silica for propane dehydrogenation. At low Co loading, the nanoparticles form a Pt3Co intermetallic surface alloy with a Pt-rich core. As Co content increases, a full Pt3Co phase forms, then a PtCo core develops covered by a Pt3Co surface layer. At high Co loadings, excess Co forms large monometallic Co nanoparticles. Despite the different structures, all catalysts maintain a Pt3Co catalytic surface.

8.该文系统地研究了负载在二氧化硅上的双金属PtCo纳米粒子用于丙烷脱氢。在低钴负载时,纳米粒子形成Pt3Co金属间化合物表面合金,具有Pt富集的核心。随着Co含量的增加,形成全Pt3Co相,然后形成PtCo核心,覆盖着Pt3Co表面层。在高Co负载量时,过量的Co形成大的单金属Co纳米粒子。尽管结构不同,但所有催化剂都保持Pt3Co催化表面。
