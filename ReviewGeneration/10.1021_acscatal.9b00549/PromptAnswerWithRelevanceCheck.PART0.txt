2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the activation energy barrier for breaking C-H bonds to form propylene (Quote 1). High temperatures are required which can lead to side reactions like hydrogenolysis and coke formation that deactivate the catalyst (Quote 2).
