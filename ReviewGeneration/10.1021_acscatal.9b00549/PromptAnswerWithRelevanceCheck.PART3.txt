[1] "The X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) characterization was carried out in the 10-BM bending magnet and 10-ID Insertion device beamlines, at the Advanced Photon Source facility at Argonne National Laboratory. The monochromator was calibrated by acquiring a metal foil spectrum at each absorption edge. A simultaneous measurement of the metal foil in a third chamber was performed for each catalyst for energy calibration. The spectra were obtained in situ in transmission mode for the Pt LIII edge and Co K edge in step scan mode in approximately 10 min. Before each measurement, the samples were reduced at 550 C for 30 min under a 100 cm3/min flow rate of 3.5% H2 in balance He. The XAS cell was purged in He, and the measurements were taken at room temperature in the presence of He."
