 Based on the provided text in the Correct Answers and Comparative Files attachments, I have analyzed each answer file's responses and calculated the consistency ratio with the correct answers for each question. The results are compiled in the following JSON format:

```json

    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", 
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"
  },
  "3": {
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"
  },
  "4": {
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "50%", 
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "50%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%"
  },
  "5": {
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", 
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%"
  },
  "6": {
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"
  },
  "7": {
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", 
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"
  }
}
```

In summary:
- All answer files were 100% consistent for questions 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7.
- answer.PART3_1.txt and answer.PART3_3.txt were 100% consistent for all questions. 
- answer.PART3_2.txt and answer.PART3_4.txt were only 50% consistent for question 4 about in-situ X-ray techniques.
