[1] "The X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) characterization was carried out in the 10-BM bending magnet and 10-ID Insertion device beamlines, at the Advanced Photon Source facility at Argonne National Laboratory. The monochromator was calibrated by acquiring a metal foil spectrum at each absorption edge. A simultaneous measurement of the metal foil in a third chamber was performed for each catalyst for energy calibration. The spectra were obtained in situ in transmission mode for the Pt LIII edge and Co K edge in step scan mode in approximately 10 min. Before each measurement, the samples were reduced at 550 C for 30 min under a 100 cm3/min flow rate of 3.5% H2 in balance He. The XAS cell was purged in He, and the measurements were taken at room temperature in the presence of He."

[1] "STEM images were obtained at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) to measure the particle size distribution." 

[2] "The nanoparticle size was determined by STEM. For an accurate representation, several images were taken at different spots on the SiO2 surface and the mean particle size and deviation were obtained on the basis of the frequency distribution between 200 and 400 nanoparticles for each catalyst."
