 Unfortunately the given literature does not evaluate any metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The article focuses on bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles supported on silica for propane dehydrogenation. As such, I do not have any relevant quotes or information to answer questions 1-3 about metal oxide catalyst performance, reaction mechanisms, or structure-function relationships.

[1] "All of the bimetallic PtCo catalysts have significantly improved olefin selectivity, generally greater than about 95% in the absence of H2."

[2] "Pt is reduced at a much lower temperature (250 C) than for Co (750 C). Thus, it is likely that small Pt nanoparticles are initially formed."  

[3] "the catalytic surface in each of these catalysts had a Pt3Co structure."

[4] "The high olefin selectivity of the surface Pt3Co is suggested to be due to geometric effects, where there are smaller PtPt ensembles, as well as a decrease in the energy of the Pt 5d orbitals in comparison to that in monometallic Pt."

4-6. The article evaluates supported monometallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that small Pt nanoparticles around 2 nm in size are initially formed on the silica support. Bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles are then created, with Pt3Co surface structure in all cases. The Pt3Co surface leads to high propylene selectivity over 95% due to both ensemble size effects breaking up large Pt domains as well as electronic effects decreasing the Pt 5d orbital energies.

4-6. 文章评估了负载的单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它显示在二氧化硅支撑上最初形成了约2 nm大小的小Pt纳米粒子。然后形成了双金属PtCo纳米粒子,在所有情况下具有Pt3Co表面结构。Pt3Co表面导致丙烯选择性高于95%,这是由于集团大小效应打破了大的Pt区域以及电子效应降低了Pt 5d轨道能量。

[1] "the catalytic surface in each of these catalysts had a Pt3Co structure." 

[2] "Despite the different nanostructures in these catalysts, the catalytic surface in each of these catalysts had a Pt3Co structure."

[3] "All PtCo catalysts have much higher propylene selectivity for propane dehydrogenation in comparison to monometallic Pt or Co."

[4] "The high selectivity was maintained at high conversion and in the presence of cofed H2."

7-8. The article shows that despite differences in the core nanostructure, the Pt3Co surface structure remains constant across the PtCo catalysts studied. This uniform Pt3Co surface leads to high propylene selectivity over 90% that is maintained even at high conversion and under cofeeding of H2. The surface structure controls the selectivity, with the Pt3Co geometry breaking up Pt ensembles.
