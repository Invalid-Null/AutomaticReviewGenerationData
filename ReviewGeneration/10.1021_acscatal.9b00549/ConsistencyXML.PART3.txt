To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the answers from each file to the provided correct answers. For questions where the file had the same assessment of whether the article discussed that topic or not, I assigned 100% consistency. For questions where the file did not provide any relevant information (as in answer.PART3_0.txt), I assigned 0% consistency. All the other files had complete agreement with the correct answers, so received 100% consistency scores. This XML structure presents the consistency ratios for each question and file combination as requested.
