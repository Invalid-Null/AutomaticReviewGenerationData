<quotes>
[1] "The increase in the olefin selectivity of the surface Pt3Co is suggested to be due to geometric effects, where there are smaller PtPt ensembles, as well as a decrease in the energy of the Pt 5d orbitals in comparison to that in monometallic Pt."

[2] "The XANES shift to higher energies in Pt3Co also suggests a lowering of the energy of the filled 5d orbitals. Since the filled Pt 5d orbitals form bonds with reactants, the resulting metaladsorbate bonds are weaker."

[3] "These weaker bonds result in lower surface coverage of reactants and products, including propylene and hydrogen." 

[4] "Facile desorption of propylene would also lead to fewer side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis and coking."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Co in the PtCo bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It suggests the high olefin selectivity of Pt3Co surface alloy is due to smaller Pt ensembles that inhibit hydrogenolysis (geometric effect) and lowering of Pt 5d orbital energies that weaken metal-adsorbate bonds, reducing surface coverage and side reactions (electronic effect).

答:是的,这篇文章研究了副金属Co在PtCo双金属和合金催化剂中的电子效应和几何效应。它认为Pt3Co表面合金的高烯烃选择性是由于较小的Pt配合位抑制了加氢裂解反应(几何效应),以及Pt 5d轨道能量的降低削弱了金属-吸附物键,减少了表面覆盖度和副反应(电子效应)。
