[1] "Since this reaction is highly endothermic, it requires high temperatures which also favor light gas formation by hydrogenolysis and rapid deactivation by coke formation."

[2] "Hydrogenolysis reactions are due to CC bond dissociation (reaction II) in the presence of H2, while the coke formation on the surface rapidly deactivates the catalysts by active sites blockage."

4. The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic reaction that requires high temperatures, which also favor light gas formation by hydrogenolysis (reaction II) and catalyst deactivation by coke formation. It provides quantitative details that hydrogenolysis involves C-C bond dissociation in the presence of H2, while coke formation blocks active sites.
