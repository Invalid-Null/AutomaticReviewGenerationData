<quotes>
[1] "Since hydrogenolysis is a structure-sensitive reaction, the decrease in the Pt ensemble size significantly inhibits the cleavage of CC bonds."
[2] "The XANES shift to higher energies in Pt3Co also suggests a lowering of the energy of the filled 5d orbitals."
[3] "These weaker bonds result in lower surface coverage of reactants and products, including propylene and hydrogen."  
</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Co in the bimetallic PtCo catalysts. It shows that the Pt3Co structure decreases the Pt ensemble size, which inhibits the hydrogenolysis reaction and improves selectivity (Quote 1). It also shows that alloying with Co raises the d-band center of Pt, weakening bonds to reactants like propylene, which improves selectivity (Quotes 2-3).

<quotes>
[1] "The increase in the olefin selectivity of the surface Pt3Co is suggested to be due to geometric effects, where there are smaller PtPt ensembles, as well as a decrease in the energy of the Pt 5d orbitals in comparison to that in monometallic Pt."

[2] "The XANES shift to higher energies in Pt3Co also suggests a lowering of the energy of the filled 5d orbitals. Since the filled Pt 5d orbitals form bonds with reactants, the resulting metaladsorbate bonds are weaker."

[3] "These weaker bonds result in lower surface coverage of reactants and products, including propylene and hydrogen." 

[4] "Facile desorption of propylene would also lead to fewer side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis and coking."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Co in the PtCo bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It suggests the high olefin selectivity of Pt3Co surface alloy is due to smaller Pt ensembles that inhibit hydrogenolysis (geometric effect) and lowering of Pt 5d orbital energies that weaken metal-adsorbate bonds, reducing surface coverage and side reactions (electronic effect).
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,这篇文章研究了副金属Co在PtCo双金属和合金催化剂中的电子效应和几何效应。它认为Pt3Co表面合金的高烯烃选择性是由于较小的Pt配合位抑制了加氢裂解反应(几何效应),以及Pt 5d轨道能量的降低削弱了金属-吸附物键,减少了表面覆盖度和副反应(电子效应)。

<quotes>
[1] "Since hydrogenolysis is a structure-sensitive reaction, the decrease in the Pt ensemble size significantly inhibits the cleavage of CC bonds."

[2] "The suppression of hydrogenolysis by structural changes on the surface leads to an increased propylene selectivity, similar to geometric effects for nonactive promoter atoms reported for Pt3M and PtM intermetallic alloys with Sn, Zn, In, Mn, and Cu."

[3] "The XANES shift to higher energies in Pt3Co also suggests a lowering of the energy of the filled 5d orbitals." 

[4] "Since the filled Pt 5d orbitals form bonds with reactants, the resulting metaladsorbate bonds are weaker."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article does investigate electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Co in the PtCo bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It shows that the decreased Pt ensemble size in Pt3Co compared to pure Pt leads to lower hydrogenolysis rates and higher propylene selectivity, demonstrating a geometric effect. It also shows that alloying with Co raises the energy of Pt's unfilled d-orbitals and lowers the energy of filled d-orbitals, weakening metal-adsorbate bonds, an electronic effect. 
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 
回答:本文的确研究了二次金属Co在PtCo双金属和合金催化剂中的电子效应和几何效应。结果显示,与纯Pt相比,Pt3Co中Pt配位体大小的减小可降低氢解反应速率并提高丙烯选择性,这证明了几何效应的存在。结果也显示,与Co合金化可提高Pt未填充的d轨道能量并降低填充的d轨道能量,因此减弱了金属-吸附物键,这证明了电子效应的存在。

 Unfortunately this literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the provided questions. The article focuses on investigating the structure and performance of PtCo bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, and does not compare metallic vs. oxidized catalysts, evaluate other Pt alloys like PtSn or PtGa, explore subsurface promoters, zeolite supports, or effects of varying Si/Al ratio. The article only examines PtCo bimetallic catalysts, and provides no examples of synergistic effects between metals.
