[1] "We tested the RhCu/SiO2 SAA catalyst for propane dehydrogenation in flow-reactor studies away from equilibrium in the kinetic regime."

[2] "Experiments were conducted both in the absence (fig. S14) and presence (Fig. 3A) of hydrogen in the feed (the latter experiment was performed to better simulate industrially relevant conditions in which a co-flow of H2 is required to prevent Pt from coking)." 

[3] "The data in Fig. 3A revealed that the RhCu/SiO2 SAA catalyst exhibited higher activity per mole of active metal, as well as a considerably lower reaction light-off temperature, than Pt/Al2O3."

<English version answer>

1. No, the article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

2. No, the article does not investigate tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides for propane dehydrogenation. 

3. No, the article does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts.

4. No, the article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

5. Answer: The article evaluates a supported RhCu single atom alloy catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Flow reactor studies show it exhibits higher activity and lower light-off temperature compared to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.

6. No, the article does not investigate how properties like particle size, shape and support interactions affect performance of supported metal catalysts.

7. No, the article does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts.
