[1] "We tested the RhCu/SiO2 SAA catalyst for propane dehydrogenation in flow-reactor studies away from equilibrium in the kinetic regime."

[2] "We performed a direct comparison of the RhCu/SiO2 SAA catalyst with a standard consisting of Pt NPs supported on Al2O3."

[3] "Experiments were conducted both in the absence (fig. S14) and presence (Fig. 3A) of hydrogen in the feed (the latter experiment was performed to better simulate industrially relevant conditions in which a co-flow of H2 is required to prevent Pt from coking)."

[4] "The data in Fig. 3A revealed that the RhCu/SiO2 SAA catalyst exhibited higher activity per mole of active metal, as well as a considerably lower reaction light-off temperature, than Pt/Al2O3."

[5] "The high reactivity of the RhCu/SiO2 SAA catalyst was coupled with Cu-like propene selectivity (100% on RhCu/SiO2 SAA versus 80% on Pt/Al2O3) and resistance to coking (fig. S15 and table S4)."

Answer: The article evaluates a supported RhCu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It provides flow reactor data comparing RhCu/SiO2 to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst standard, showing the RhCu SAA has higher activity and selectivity. The RhCu catalyst also shows resistance to coking.

[1] "To further understand these experimental observations, we used DFT to calculate and compare the propane dehydrogenation reaction energetics of the RhCu(111) SAA to those of pure Cu(111), Rh(111), and Pt(111)." 

[2] "Our DFT calculations (Fig. 3B, figs. S16 and S17, and table S5) show that the RhCu(111) SAA surface provided lower thermodynamic barriers for the formation of the isopropyl intermediate and propene than the pure Cu(111) surface."

[3] "In addition, relative to Cu(111), the SAA exhibited a considerably lower kinetic barrier for the first dehydrogenation step [0.57 eV on the RhCu(111) SAA versus 1.39 eV on Cu(111)] and a very small subsequent kinetic barrier for the C3H7-to-C3H6 step (0.10 eV), indicative of a highly active catalyst."

[4] "Notably, the activation barrier of propane on the RhCu(111) SAA is lower than that on pristine Pt(111) and very similar to that on Rh(111) [0.68 and 0.63 eV, respectively (fig. S16 and table S5)]."
