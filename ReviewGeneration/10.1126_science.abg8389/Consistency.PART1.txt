 Here is the comparison of the answer files to the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "80%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "8": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"}
}
```

To summarize:
- For questions 1-4 and 6-8, all answer files had 100% consistency with the correct answers.
- For question 5, answer1.txt had 80% consistency, while the other files had 100% consistency.

The comparison shows overall very high consistency between the answer files and correct answers, with just one file having slightly lower consistency for one question.
