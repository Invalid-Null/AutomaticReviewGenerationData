<quotes>
[1] "RhCu/SiO2 NPs of 3-nm diameter were synthesized through galvanic replacement of silica-supported copper NPs (figs. S8 and S9) by small amounts of Rh (10). "

[2] "CO diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and in situ extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies were performed to verify the successful alloying, as well as the absence of surface Rh aggregates."

[3] "DRIFTS results (figs. S10 and S11) revealed a narrow (15 cm1 full width at half maximum) peak corresponding to linear CO adsorption on Rh atoms at 2089 cm1. Notably, no infrared signals for Rh directly on SiO2 or Rh aggregates at the Cu surface were observed (23, 24), thereby demonstrating that a SAA was formed, in line with our EXAFS analysis (figs. S12 and S13 and table S3)."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It synthesizes 3 nm RhCu nanoparticles on silica with a Rh:Cu ratio of 1:100 using galvanic replacement to achieve isolated Rh atoms alloyed with Cu. Diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure studies verified successful alloying and absence of Rh aggregates.
