      [1] "Manipulating the amount of Mn precursor resulted in partial or full intermetallic transformation, forming coreshell or full-body intermetallic NPs (named as Pt3Mn-s (s stands for surface) and Pt3Mn, respectively)."

      [2] "With the same ordered NP surface, a Pt3Mn intermetallic subsurface instead of monometallic Pt significantly improved the CH activation selectivity during propane dehydrogenation by lowering the heats of hydrocarbon and hydrogen adsorption of the surface sites."

      [3] "According to the d band theory, an electronic effect leading to weaker adsorption strength is typically related with downward shifts of d states away from the Fermi level, which is indeed observed from the calculated density of states, showing a 0.05 eV shift for Pt3Mn (111) compared to Pt3Mn-2s(111)."

      Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Mn in the bimetallic Pt-Mn catalysts. It shows that manipulating the amount of Mn precursor allows tuning the extent of intermetallic formation, from core-shell to full body Pt3Mn nanoparticles. With the same Pt3Mn surface ordering, having a Pt3Mn intermetallic subsurface instead of Pt metal significantly improved propane dehydrogenation selectivity by lowering hydrocarbon and hydrogen adsorption strengths. This is attributed to an electronic effect related to downward shift of the Pt d-states due to Mn incorporation, as explained by d-band theory.

      是的,该文献研究了二元Pt-Mn催化剂中次要金属Mn的电子效应和几何效应。它显示调控Mn前驱物的量可以调控金属间化合物的形成程度,从核壳到全身Pt3Mn纳米粒子。在相同的Pt3Mn表面有序结构下,与Pt金属相比,Pt3Mn金属间化合物的次表面可以显著提高丙烷脱氢反应的选择性,通过降低烃和氢的吸附强度。这归因于Mn掺入引起的Pt d态向下移位的电子效应,可以用d带理论来解释。

      [1] "A Pt3Mn subsurface instead of Pt significantly improved the CH activation selectivity during propane dehydrogenation by lowering the heats of hydrocarbon and hydrogen adsorption of the surface sites."

      [2] "Models presented herein provide a beginning to microkinetic modeling to help in directly identifying the driving force for selectivity differences."

      [3] "This work highlights the distinct role of subsurface layers for altering the surface chemical and catalytic properties on NP catalysts."

      Yes, the article explores the use of the subsurface promoter Mn in the Pt3Mn bimetallic catalyst to tune selectivity. It shows that a Pt3Mn subsurface instead of Pt significantly improved the CH activation selectivity during propane dehydrogenation by lowering the heats of hydrocarbon and hydrogen adsorption. The article presents models to help identify the driving force for selectivity differences due to the distinct role of subsurface layers in altering surface chemical and catalytic properties.

      是的,该文献探讨了使用Mn作为亚表面促进剂在PtMn双金属催化剂中调节选择性。它显示PtMn亚表面取代Pt大大提高了丙烷脱氢反应中CH活化的选择性,通过降低烃和氢的吸附热。该文献提出了模型来帮助识别亚表面层不同作用对改变表面化学和催化性质从而导致选择性差异的驱动力。
