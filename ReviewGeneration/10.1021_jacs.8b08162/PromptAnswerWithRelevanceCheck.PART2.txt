This article explores the use of a subsurface promoter Mn to tune selectivity in PtMn bimetallic nanoparticles. The main example is the comparison between Pt3Mn-s nanoparticles, which have a Pt3Mn shell on a Pt core, and Pt3Mn nanoparticles, which are fully intermetallic. The Pt3Mn nanoparticles showed higher selectivity for propane dehydrogenation compared to Pt3Mn-s, indicating a promoting effect of the Mn subsurface.

[2] "With the same ordered NP surface, a Pt3Mn intermetallic subsurface instead of monometallic Pt significantly improved the CH activation selectivity during propane dehydrogenation by lowering the heats of hydrocarbon and hydrogen adsorption of the surface sites."

[3] "According to the d band theory, an electronic effect leading to weaker adsorption strength is typically related with downward shifts of d states away from the Fermi level, which is indeed observed from the calculated density of states, showing a 0.05 eV shift for Pt3Mn (111) compared to Pt3Mn-2s(111)."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Mn in the bimetallic Pt-Mn catalysts. It shows that manipulating the amount of Mn precursor allows tuning the extent of intermetallic formation, from core-shell to full body Pt3Mn nanoparticles. With the same Pt3Mn surface ordering, having a Pt3Mn intermetallic subsurface instead of Pt metal significantly improved propane dehydrogenation selectivity by lowering hydrocarbon and hydrogen adsorption strengths. This is attributed to an electronic effect related to downward shift of the Pt d-states due to Mn incorporation, as explained by d-band theory.

<Chinese version answer> 
答:是的,这篇文章研究了二元Pt-Mn催化剂中次要金属Mn的电子效应和几何效应。它显示调控Mn前驱物的量可以调控金属间化合物的形成程度,从核壳到全身Pt3Mn纳米粒子。在相同的Pt3Mn表面有序结构下,与Pt金属相比,Pt3Mn金属间化合物的次表面可以显著提高丙烷脱氢反应的选择性,通过降低烃和氢的吸附强度。这归因于Mn掺入引起的Pt d态向下移位的电子效应,可以用d带理论来解释。
