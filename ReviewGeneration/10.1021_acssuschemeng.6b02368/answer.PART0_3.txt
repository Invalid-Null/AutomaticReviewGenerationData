 Unfortunately, this scientific literature does not contain information to directly answer any of the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation mechanisms, kinetics, thermodynamics, computational studies, microkinetic modeling, or structure-activity relationships. The article focuses on the synthesis and characterization of hierarchical silica-platinum nanotubes for potential use as catalysts. It does not provide details on propane dehydrogenation beyond using it as an example reaction to test the nanotube catalysts.

Since there are no relevant quotes from the literature, here are the answers:
