<Answer>

 Unfortunately this literature does not provide direct answers to the questions asked. The paper focuses on describing a new method to synthesize hierarchical silica-platinum nanotubes and their potential applications in catalysis. It does not provide background on propane dehydrogenation specifically or discuss reaction mechanisms, kinetics, thermodynamics, computational studies, or structure-activity relationships for this reaction.
