 Unfortunately, the given literature does not provide direct information to answer the specific questions about propane dehydrogenation. The article focuses on the synthesis and characterization of hierarchical silica-Pt nanotubes, without discussing propane dehydrogenation mechanisms, kinetics, thermodynamics, or computational studies. Since there is no relevant content, I cannot provide any quotes or detailed answers from the literature. The questions seem mismatched to the provided text. Please let me know if you would like me to attempt answering the questions based on my own knowledge rather than the given literature.
