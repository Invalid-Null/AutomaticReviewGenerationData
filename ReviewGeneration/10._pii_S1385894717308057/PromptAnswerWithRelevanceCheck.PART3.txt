3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies the effect of calcination temperature of the Mg-Al hydrotalcite support on the dispersion of PtIn active phase. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts were prepared by successive impregnation with 0.6 wt% Pt and 1.5 wt% In loading. The average Pt particle size increased with increasing calcination temperature, with the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst calcined at 600°C having the smallest Pt particle size and best dispersion. This was attributed to the gradual collapse of the nanoflake support structure at higher calcination temperatures, leading to Pt particle accumulation.

5. Yes, the article employs TEM microscopy to characterize metal-support interfaces and dispersion in the propane dehydrogenation catalysts. TEM imaging at 200 kV showed isolated Pt nanoparticles around 0.5-1 nm on the supports. The Pt particle size increased with calcination temperature, with the nanoflake PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst calcined at 600°C having the smallest Pt size and best dispersion. This was attributed to gradual collapse of the support nanoflake structure at higher temperatures.
