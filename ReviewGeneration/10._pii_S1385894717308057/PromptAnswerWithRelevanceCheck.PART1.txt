<quotes>
[1] "Comparing the other samples with PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst, the reduction temperature of platinum oxides shifted to a higher temperature at 440 C, implying that the interaction between metal and support was enhanced so that Pt species were difficult to be reduced."

[2] "The peak at the lowest temperature was assigned to the reduction of Pt species with the highest hydrogen consumption [33], [34], indicating that much more platinum oxides can be reduced by H2 at rather lower temperature."

[3] "Besides, Pt dispersions, TOF values and average rC3H6 of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts presented an opposite trend compared to the average Pt particle size." 

[4] "PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst possessed the largest specific surface area, the lowest fraction of strong acidic sites and In0 species, the smallest Pt particle size (1.0 nm), the highest Pt dispersion (46.7%) and TOF values, and the highest average rate of propylene production during the whole reaction process."

[5] "This result may be explained that since reaction temperature (620 C) exceeded the calcination temperature of 600 C for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600, with the reaction time going, support structure could partly collapsed, which resulted in slit pore blockage, active sites coverage, and coke deposit so that the catalyst started inactivation seriously."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 with the smallest Pt particle size, highest dispersion and TOF has the best catalytic activity. Reducibility of Pt oxides, strong metal-support interaction, and structural collapse of the support at high temperature lead to loss of activity. 
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 该文献评估了负载的单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供了数据显示Pt颗粒大小最小、分散性最高和TOF值最大的PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600催化剂具有最佳催化活性。Pt氧化物的可还原性、强的金属-支撑体相互作用以及高温下支撑体结构坍塌导致活性损失。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "The peak at the lowest temperature was assigned to the reduction of Pt species with the highest hydrogen consumption [33], [34], indicating that much more platinum oxides can be reduced by H2 at rather lower temperature. It had a great effect on the initial stage of propane dehydrogenation reaction." 

[2] "Besides, Pt dispersions, TOF values and average rC3H6 of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts presented an opposite trend compared to the average Pt particle size."

[3] "PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst possessed the largest specific surface area, the lowest fraction of strong acidic sites and In0 species, the smallest Pt particle size (1.0 nm), the highest Pt dispersion (46.7%) and TOF values, and the highest average rate of propylene production during the whole reaction process."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article shows that smaller Pt particle size, higher dispersion, and strong metal-support interactions in PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 lead to better reducibility, initial activity, and lifetime for propane dehydrogenation. High reaction temperature causes support collapse and coking, deactivating the catalyst.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 该文献表明PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600中的较小Pt颗粒大小、更高分散性和强的金属-支撑体相互作用导致丙烷脱氢反应具有更好的可还原性、初始活性和使用寿命。高反应温度会导致支撑体塌陷和焦炭生成,使催化剂失活。
