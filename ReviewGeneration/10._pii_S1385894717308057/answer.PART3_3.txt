<English version answer>  
Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies the effect of varying the calcination temperature of Mg(Al)O hydrotalcite supports on the dispersion and activity of PtIn catalysts prepared by successive impregnation. Increasing calcination temperature is found to decrease Pt dispersion and catalytic activity.

<English version answer>
Answer: The article employs transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize metal-support interfaces and active phase dispersion in the PtIn/Mg(Al)O propane dehydrogenation catalysts. TEM reveals that increasing calcination temperature of the Mg(Al)O supports leads to larger Pt nanoparticle size.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
答:该文献采用透射电子显微镜(TEM)表征PtIn/Mg(Al)O丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-载体界面和活性相分散。TEM显示提高Mg(Al)O载体的煅烧温度会导致更大的Pt纳米粒子大小。
