[1] "The PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalysts were prepared by successive impregnation method."

[2] "The results showed that the highest catalysis reactivity and propylene selectivity were achieved over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst."

[3] "PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst had the smallest average metal particle size as well as the largest specific surface area." 

[4] "The smaller average Pt particle size was, the better Pt particles dispersed was observed, which was more beneficial to improve the catalytic activity."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies the effect of different hydrotalcite calcination temperatures on the dispersion of PtIn active sites. The PtIn catalysts are prepared by successive impregnation. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst calcined at 600°C shows the best dispersion with the smallest Pt particle size of 1.0 nm and highest surface area. This optimal dispersion results in the highest catalytic activity.

[1] "The TEM images of catalysts were carried out by JEM-2010 microscope operated at 200 kV." 

[2] "The average Pt particle size increased slowly with the growing calcination temperature in Table 3."

<English version answer> 
Answer: Yes, the article employs transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize metal-support interfaces and Pt particle sizes in the propane dehydrogenation catalysts. TEM imaging reveals that the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst calcined at 600°C has the smallest average Pt particle size of 1.0 nm. The images show that increasing calcination temperature leads to larger Pt particles due to sintering.

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,该文献运用了透射电子显微镜(TEM)来表征丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-支撑体界面和Pt粒子大小。TEM成像显示在600°C火成的PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600催化剂具有最小的平均Pt粒子大小1.0 nm。图像显示随着升高的火成温度会导致Pt粒子因烧结而增大。

Answer: No, the article does not use any X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Although XPS is used to characterize catalyst oxidation states, this is only done before and after the reaction, not in-situ during catalysis. No examples, data or insights into oxidation state changes during the reaction are provided.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 否,该文献没有使用任何X射线基于技术来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。虽然XPS被用来表征催化剂的氧化态,但这只是在反应前后而不是在原位催化过程中完成的。没有提供有关反应过程中氧化态变化的示例、数据或见解。
