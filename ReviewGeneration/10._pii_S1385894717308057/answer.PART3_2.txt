[1] "The PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts were prepared by successive impregnation method."

[2] "The detailed preparation process was described in our previous studies [40], [41], and the loadings of Pt and In were 0.6 and 1.5 wt% respectively."

[3] "The average Pt particle size increased slowly with the growing calcination temperature in Table 3."

[4] "PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 sample exhibited the smallest average Pt particle size." 

[5] "This result was in good agreement with SEM images and the results of textural properties."

[6] "With the increase of calcination temperature for the supports, the nanoflake structure of Mg(Al)O-T gradually collapsed and then resulted in the accumulation of Pt particles so that the average particle diameter increased gradually [51]."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies the effect of calcination temperature of the Mg-Al hydrotalcite support on the dispersion of PtIn active phase. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts were prepared by successive impregnation with 0.6 wt% Pt and 1.5 wt% In loading. The average Pt particle size increased with increasing calcination temperature, with the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst calcined at 600°C having the smallest Pt particle size and best dispersion. This was attributed to the gradual collapse of the nanoflake support structure at higher calcination temperatures, leading to Pt particle accumulation.

3. 是的,这篇文章研究了针对优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它研究了镁铝水滑石支持剂的煅烧温度对PtIn活性相分散的影响。PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T催化剂是通过连续浸渍法制备的,Pt加载量为0.6 wt%,In加载量为1.5 wt%。随着煅烧温度的升高,平均Pt颗粒大小也增加,在600°C煅烧的PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600催化剂具有最小的Pt颗粒大小和最佳分散性。这是由于较高煅烧温度下支持剂纳米薄片结构的逐渐坍��导致Pt颗粒聚集所致。

4. No, the article does not utilize any in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It focuses on ex-situ techniques like XRD, SEM, TEM, TPR, XPS etc. to characterize the fresh and spent catalysts. No in-situ data during propane dehydrogenation reaction is presented.

[1] "The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of catalysts were carried out by JEM-2010 microscope operated at 200 kV." 

[2] "The small Pt particles about 0.57 nm in diameter isolated from each other were observed in the TEM images, and the average Pt particle size increased slowly with the increase of calcination temperature in Table 3."

[3] "PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 sample exhibited the smallest average Pt particle size."

[4] "This result was in good agreement with SEM images and the results of textural properties."

5. Yes, the article employs TEM microscopy to characterize metal-support interfaces and dispersion in the propane dehydrogenation catalysts. TEM imaging at 200 kV showed isolated Pt nanoparticles around 0.5-1 nm on the supports. The Pt particle size increased with calcination temperature, with the nanoflake PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst calcined at 600°C having the smallest Pt size and best dispersion. This was attributed to gradual collapse of the support nanoflake structure at higher temperatures.

5. 是的,这篇文章采用TEM显微技术表征了丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-支持剂界面和分散性。在200 kV下的TEM成像显示支持剂上存在约0.5-1 nm的隔离Pt纳米颗粒。随着煅烧温度的增加,Pt颗粒大小也增加,在600°C煅烧的纳米薄片PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600催化剂具有最小的Pt大小和最佳的分散性。这是由于较高温度下支持剂纳米薄片结构的逐渐坍塌所致。
