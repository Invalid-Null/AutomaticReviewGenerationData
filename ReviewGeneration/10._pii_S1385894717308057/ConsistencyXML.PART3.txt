To generate the consistency ratios, I carefully compared the answers provided in each file to the correct answers. I determined the level of consistency by assessing if the key relevant information from the correct answers was also present or absent in the comparative answers. 

For questions where the comparative answers contained the same key insights and information as the correct answers, I assigned a consistency ratio of 100%, indicating complete consistency.

For questions where the comparative answers lacked some of the key details or insights relative to the correct answers, I assigned partial consistency ratios like 50%.

And for questions where the comparative answers contained no relevant information from the correct answers, I assigned a consistency ratio of 0%, indicating completely inconsistent or incorrect answers.

I structured the output into an XML format with each question as a separate element, and consistency ratios provided on a per-file basis for comparison. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
