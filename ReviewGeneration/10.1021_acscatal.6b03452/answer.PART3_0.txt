<quotes>
[1] "The sizes of Pt nanoparticles were analyzed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) employing a JEOL TEM-ARM 200F instrument equipped with a Cs corrector on the illumination system."

[2] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a FEI TECNAI G2 F20 (200 kV) high-resolution transmission electron microscope." 

[3] "The sizes of Pt nanoparticles were measured with the DigitalMicrograph software."

[4] "High-resolution STEM images of the as-prepared catalysts are shown in Figure 5. The morphologies and structures of the Pt NPs in Pt/ND@G are different from those in Pt/Al2O3. The shapes of the Pt NPs in Pt/ND@G are irregular (triangular and other shapes), while those in Pt/Al2O3 are dominated by more spherical and diamond shapes."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like STEM and HRTEM to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specific examples and insights are provided, including using STEM and HRTEM to analyze Pt nanoparticle sizes and shapes in different catalysts like Pt/ND@G and Pt/Al2O3. This reveals differences in morphology and structure resulting from interactions between the metal and support.
