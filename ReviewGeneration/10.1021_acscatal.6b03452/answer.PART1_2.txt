<quotes>

[1] "Al2O3-supported Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are high-efficiency catalysts for PDH."

[2] "The Pt/ND@G catalyst experienced slight deactivation during the 100 h PDH test, while the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst showed severe deactivation after the 20 h PDH test."  

[3] "the as-prepared nanocarbon-supported Pt NP catalyst with excellent catalytic activity and stability for the PDH reaction compared to those of the traditional Al2O3-supported Pt catalyst (Pt/Al2O3)"

</quotes>

<English version answer>

5. Yes, the article evaluates Al2O3-supported Pt nanoparticles as a catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It shows Pt/Al2O3 has high initial activity but severe deactivation after 20 hours. In comparison, the nanocarbon-supported Pt catalyst Pt/ND@G had higher stability over 100 hours with only slight deactivation.

5. 是的,本文评估了Al2O3支撑的Pt纳米粒子作为丙烷脱氢催化剂。它显示Pt/Al2O3具有高初始活性,但在20小时后活性严重下降。相比之下,纳米碳支撑的Pt催化剂Pt/ND@G在100小时内稳定性更好,活性降低较小。

[1] "The sizes of the Pt NPs in Pt/ND@G undergo negligible changes after PDH reaction for 20 h (Figure 2c,d and Figure S4c,d), revealing the superior antisintering ability of the as-prepared Pt/ND@G catalyst in the high-temperature PDH reaction."

[2] "the Pt NPs in the Pt/ND@G catalyst are essentially unchanged after the annealing process (Figure 3c,d and Figure S6c,d), which indicates that the SMSIs between the Pt NPs and ND@G support inhibit sintering of the Pt NPs during the high-temperature annealing."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like particle size and support interactions affect performance. It shows the Pt/ND@G catalyst with nanocarbon support inhibited sintering and aggregation of Pt nanoparticles during propane dehydrogenation, maintaining stable particle size. This was attributed to strong metal-support interactions between Pt and the nanocarbon support.

6. 是的,本文研究了诸如粒子大小和支撑剂相互作用等性质如何影响性能。它显示纳米碳支撑的Pt/ND@G催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中抑制了Pt纳米粒子的烧结和聚集,使粒子大小保持稳定。这被归因于Pt与纳米碳支撑剂之间强的金属-支撑相互作用。
