[1] "The sizes of Pt nanoparticles were analyzed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) employing a JEOL TEM-ARM 200F instrument equipped with a Cs corrector on the illumination system."

[2] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a FEI TECNAI G2 F20 (200 kV) high-resolution transmission electron microscope." 

[3] "The sizes of Pt nanoparticles were measured with the DigitalMicrograph software."

[4] "High-resolution STEM images of the as-prepared catalysts are shown in Figure 5. The morphologies and structures of the Pt NPs in Pt/ND@G are different from those in Pt/Al2O3. The shapes of the Pt NPs in Pt/ND@G are irregular (triangular and other shapes), while those in Pt/Al2O3 are dominated by more spherical and diamond shapes."

[2] "The morphologies and structures of the Pt NPs in Pt/ND@G are different from those in Pt/Al2O3." 

[3] "Additionally, the lattice fringes of the Pt NPs are more visible in Pt/Al2O3, which implies that the crystallinity of the Pt NPs in Pt/ND@G is lower than that in Pt/Al2O3."

[4] "The irregular morphology and low crystallinity of the Pt NPs in Pt/ND@G may be strongly affected by the SMSIs mentioned above."

[5] "In addition, the morphologies and structures of the Pt NPs in Pt/OLC are similar to those in Pt/Al2O3, both of which are also different from those in Pt/ND@G."

[6] "These results further confirm the existence of stronger metal-support interactions in Pt/ND@G."

5. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses high-resolution STEM imaging to compare the morphologies and structures of Pt nanoparticles supported on different materials like Al2O3, ND@G, and OLC. Key insights are that Pt nanoparticles on ND@G have irregular shapes and lower crystallinity compared to those on Al2O3 and OLC, which is attributed to strong metal-support interactions in the Pt/ND@G catalyst.

Answer: The article employs advanced microscopy techniques including scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specific examples include analyzing the size distribution of Pt nanoparticles before and after catalysis (Figure 2) and after high temperature annealing (Figure 3), as well as examining the morphology and structure of Pt nanoparticles on different supports (Figure 5). These microscopy analyses provided insights into metal-support interactions, sintering resistance, and the effects of the nanocarbon support structure.
