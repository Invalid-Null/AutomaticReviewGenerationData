[1] "The sizes of Pt nanoparticles were analyzed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) employing a JEOL TEM-ARM 200F instrument equipped with a Cs corrector on the illumination system."

[2] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a FEI TECNAI G2 F20 (200 kV) high-resolution transmission electron microscope." 

[3] "Figure 2. Scanning transmission electron microscopy images of fresh and spent (a and b) Pt/Al2O3 and (c and d) Pt/ND@G catalysts, respectively. The spent catalysts were used in a 20 h propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "Figure 3. Scanning transmission electron microscopy images of the (a and b) Pt/Al2O3, (c and d) Pt/ND@G, and (e and f) Pt/OLC catalysts before and after annealing in N2 at 600 C, respectively."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article employs advanced microscopy techniques including scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specific examples include analyzing the size distribution of Pt nanoparticles before and after catalysis (Figure 2) and after high temperature annealing (Figure 3), as well as examining the morphology and structure of Pt nanoparticles on different supports (Figure 5). These microscopy analyses provided insights into metal-support interactions, sintering resistance, and the effects of the nanocarbon support structure.
