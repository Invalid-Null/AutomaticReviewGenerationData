 Here is the JSON structure comparing the consistency of the answer files with the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},
  "6": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I carefully analyzed each answer file and compared it to the correct answers to determine the consistency percentage for each question. The answer files are fully consistent for questions 1-4 and 6-7. For question 5, only answer4.txt is completely inconsistent with the correct answer, while the other files match the correct answer.
