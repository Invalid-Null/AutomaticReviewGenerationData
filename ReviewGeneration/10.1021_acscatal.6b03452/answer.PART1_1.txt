4. "The nanocarbon support is composed of a nanodiamond core and a defective, ultrathin graphene nanoshell (ND@G)." 

"The origin of the good durability can be explained as follows. First, the strong electron transfer between the Pt NPs and ultrathin graphene nanoshell rich in defects increases the electron density of the Pt NPs, enhancing propylene desorption and inhibiting coke formation. Second, the strong electron transfer significantly promotes the SMSIs and effectively improves the Pt sintering resistance for Pt/ND@G."

6. "Nanocarbons have several advantages as supports. The acidity of the nanocarbons is weak and tunable, (17) which can decrease the level of coke formation during PDH." 

"Additionally, the large pore diameter and surface area of the nanocarbons can help to increase coke resistance. (18)" 

"Finally, the metallic or semimetallic nature of the nanocarbons ensures stronger electronic interactions with the metal catalysts. (19)"

1. The article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

2. The article does not investigate tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides for propane dehydrogenation.

3. The article does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts. 

4. The article explores metal-support interfacial effects in a nanocarbon-supported Pt nanoparticle catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It found that strong electron transfer between the Pt nanoparticles and the defective ultrathin graphene nanoshell support significantly enhanced propylene desorption and inhibited coke formation, as well as improved Pt nanoparticle sintering resistance.

5. The article does not propose mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the studied supported metal catalyst.

6. The article evaluates a nanocarbon-supported Pt nanoparticle catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It found the nanocarbon support provides weak and tunable acidity to decrease coke formation, high surface area and pore diameter to increase coke resistance, and strong electronic interactions with Pt to improve stability.

7. The article does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape and support interactions affect performance of supported metal catalysts.

8. The article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation.
