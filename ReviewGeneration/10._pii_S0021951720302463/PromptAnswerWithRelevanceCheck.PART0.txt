 <quotes>

[1] Propene as an important raw chemical intermediate is widely used for the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, etc. [2] With the rising demand for propene, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has attracted growing attention due to the price gap between propene and propane and the continuously explored of shale gas.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

1. Yes, the article provides background on the importance of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation. It states that propene is an important chemical intermediate used widely in the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile. The article also mentions the rising demand for propene and the price gap between propene and propane as reasons for the growing attention on propane dehydrogenation, along with the continuous exploration of shale gas.

<quotes>

[1] Supported Pt-based catalysts are mostly widely used for PDH process [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. However, catalyst deactivation caused by coke deposition and Pt sintering remains challenging and the frequent regeneration is required.

[2] Great efforts have been devoted to develop the stable Pt-based catalysts, including introduction metal promoter and modification of support. 

[3] The development of highly stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst is significant with the growing extraction of shale gas in the world.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article explains that catalysts like supported Pt can facilitate propane dehydrogenation, but suffer from deactivation issues like coking and sintering, requiring frequent regeneration. Efforts have been made to improve stability by adding promoters or modifying supports. The need for more stable PDH catalysts is significant given growing shale gas production. But no specific mechanisms of catalyst activity are described.

</English version answer>  

<Chinese version answer>

2. 文章解释说,类似负载Pt的催化剂可以促进丙烷脱氢,但会遭受如焦炭和烧结等失活问题,需要频繁再生。已经通过添加促进剂或修改载体来努力提高稳定性。由于页岩气生产不断增长,更稳定的丙烷脱氢催化剂需求量巨大。但是没有描述催化剂活性的具体机理。
