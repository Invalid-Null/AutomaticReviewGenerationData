[1] A facile in-situ emulsion method was used to construct Mn-DMSN support.

[2] Pt/Mn-DMSN catalysts were prepared by means of incipient wetness impregnation method using H2PtCl6·6H2O as the precursor. 

[3] Usually, the specific preparation method, including organometallic chemistry method and thermolytic molecular precursor approach, and expensive Pt or promoter metal precursors are used to synthesize the highly dispersed small nanoparticles catalyst [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. But it is restricted during the industrial process.

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes using an in-situ emulsion method to incorporate manganese species into a silica support, creating anchoring sites for platinum. It also uses incipient wetness impregnation with H2PtCl6 as a platinum precursor. The goal is to achieve high dispersion of small platinum nanoparticles on the support while using inexpensive industrial-compatible methods.

[1] The TEM images in Fig. 5 also demonstrate that the dispersion of Pt on Pt/Mn-DMSN catalysts increases with the increasing of Mn amounts.

[2] STEM characterization was carried out and Fig. 5d shows the STEM image and particle size distribution. The highly dispersed nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution (1.4 ± 0.2 nm) are distributed on the Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN catalyst.

[3] The elemental mapping on this sample in Fig. 5f indicates the Mn and Pt uniformly and highly dispersed.
