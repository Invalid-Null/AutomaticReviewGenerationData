      [1] Therefore, to prepare the highly dispersed Pt-based catalyst, the silica support should be modified. In the present work, a simple in-situ emulsion method was developed to prepare the highly dispersed MnOx decorated dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (Mn-DMSN) support. And the highly dispersed Pt catalyst (Pt/Mn-DMSN) was obtained by incipient wetness impregnation method using H2PtCl6·6H2O as the precursor.
