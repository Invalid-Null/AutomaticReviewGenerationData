 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative answer files, I have compiled the following JSON structure with consistency ratios:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "50%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I compared each answer file's response for each question to the correct answer provided and estimated a consistency percentage based on the overlap in content and meaning. 100% indicates fully consistent, 50% partially consistent, and 0% completely inconsistent. Let me know if you need any clarification on the analysis!
