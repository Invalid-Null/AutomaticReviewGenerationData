 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature to answer any of the questions. The article evaluates Mn-doped dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (Mn-DMSN) supported Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, and does not investigate other metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3. It also does not explore oxidation states, oxygen mobility, acid-base properties of metal oxides, or mechanistic scenarios over metal oxide catalysts. 

The article focuses on tuning Mn doping levels in the DMSN support to modulate Pt dispersion, Pt-Mn alloying, and metal-support interactions. No mono-metallic Pt, Pd or Ir catalysts are evaluated. The work reveals structure-function relationships between Mn doping, Pt nanoparticle size/dispersion, Pt-Mn alloying extent, and propane dehydrogenation performance. A Pt-Mn alloying model is proposed to explain trends in activity and stability. But no detailed mechanistic pathways or intermediates are described.
