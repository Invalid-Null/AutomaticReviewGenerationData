<quotes>

[1] Supported Pt-based catalysts are mostly widely used for PDH process [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. However, catalyst deactivation caused by coke deposition and Pt sintering remains challenging and the frequent regeneration is required.

[2] Great efforts have been devoted to develop the stable Pt-based catalysts, including introduction metal promoter and modification of support. 

[3] The development of highly stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst is significant with the growing extraction of shale gas in the world.

2. The article explains that catalysts like supported Pt can facilitate propane dehydrogenation, but suffer from deactivation issues like coking and sintering, requiring frequent regeneration. Efforts have been made to improve stability by adding promoters or modifying supports. The need for more stable PDH catalysts is significant given growing shale gas production. But no specific mechanisms of catalyst activity are described.
