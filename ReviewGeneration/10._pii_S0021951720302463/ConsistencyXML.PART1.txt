To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the answers in each 'answer*.txt' file to the correct answers provided. I looked for semantic equivalence between the key points and assessed if the answers fully addressed the questions asked.

For question 1, answer.PART1_1.txt only partially answers the question so I assigned a consistency ratio of 50%. The other answers fully addressed the question asked.

For question 5, answer.PART1_1.txt provides an incorrect answer stating the article evaluates supported mono-metallic catalysts when it does not. So I assigned a 0% consistency ratio.

The other questions show 100% consistency between the answers in the 'answer*.txt' files and the correct answers provided. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
