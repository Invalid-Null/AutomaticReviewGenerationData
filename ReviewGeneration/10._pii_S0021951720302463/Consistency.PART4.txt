The consistency ratios were determined by comparing the key points made in each answer file against the provided correct answers. For questions where the answer files concurred that no relevant information was present, they were marked as 100% consistent. The only exception is Question 6, where one answer file correctly identified a relevant quote while the others stated no relevant information was present.
