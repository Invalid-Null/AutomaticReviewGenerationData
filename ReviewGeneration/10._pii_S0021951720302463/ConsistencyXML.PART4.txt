To determine the consistency ratio, I compared the answers in each file to the correct answers provided. For each question, I checked if the answer had the same meaning and conclusion as the correct answer. 

The answer consistency is expressed as a percentage, where 100% means the answer has the exact same meaning and conclusion as the correct answer, while 0% means the answer is completely inconsistent with the correct answer. Answers that partially capture the correct answer are assigned intermediate percentage values.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
