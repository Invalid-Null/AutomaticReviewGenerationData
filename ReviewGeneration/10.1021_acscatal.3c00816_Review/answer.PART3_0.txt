[1] "Zhu et al. (48) reported that the framework Ti in TS-1 zeolites contributes to the dispersion of impregnated PtZn species and increases the electron density on Pt, which exhibits higher propane conversion (54.4%) than PtZnTi/S-1 catalyst (20%) without framework Ti species."

[2] "Wu et al. (20) reported the in situ encapsulation of isolated Co2+ sites within the S-1 framework with the assistance of ammonia. The ammonia reacts with Co2+ ions to produce [Co(NH3)6]2+ species in the alkaline hydrothermal precursor, which avoids the Co(OH)x precipitation toward successful encapsulation." 

[3] "Recently, Zhao et al. (92) developed a MgO modified ZnOx/S-1 system to suppress the volatilization of ZnOx species during PDH reaction. The formation of stable Zn-O-Mg bonds was confirmed by FTIR, XPS, and XAFS measurements."

1. The article discusses techniques like using ligand additives during zeolite hydrothermal synthesis to stabilize isolated metal ions or clusters within the zeolitic framework. Examples include using ammonia to produce [Co(NH3)6]2+ species to incorporate isolated Co2+ sites in S-1, and using ethylenediamine to disperse PtZn clusters in S-1. Framework heteroatoms like Ti are also used to anchor impregnated metals.

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation strategies like ultrafast crystallization and ligand-assisted synthesis to incorporate metal nanoclusters within zeolites. This improves stability by preventing sintering and loss of active sites. For example, encapsulated PtZn clusters in S-1 exhibited no deactivation after 220 h, while impregnated catalysts deactivated quickly.

3. The article discusses techniques like impregnation on heteroatom-containing zeolites, incorporation of metals during zeolite synthesis, and subsurface engineering to optimize dispersion. Examples include impregnating Pt on Sn-SBA-15 where Sn anchors Pt, direct hydrothermal synthesis of PtZn clusters in S-1, and selective etching to produce core-shell PtM@Pt/SBA-15.

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ DRIFTS, XRD, XAS, XPS, and TPSR to study propane dehydrogenation catalysts. These provide insights into active site speciation, changes during pretreatment and reaction, reaction mechanisms, and effects of co-feeds.

5. Advanced microscopy like AC-STEM and iDPC-STEM were used to visualize isolated metal atoms and nanoclusters at metal-zeolite interfaces. This confirms successful encapsulation and dispersion optimization strategies.

6. Yes, XANES was used to show partial reduction of encapsulated Zn2+ and Ga3+ species to Znδ+ and Ga+ under reaction conditions, relating changes in metal oxidation state to catalytic activity.

7. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on catalyst synthesis and characterization.

1. 这篇文章讨论了如在分子筛水热合成中使用配体添加剂等技术,以在分子筛框架内稳定隔离的金属离子或簇。例子包括使用氨生成[Co(NH3)6]2+ 种以掺入S-1中的隔离Co2+位点,以及使用乙二胺分散S-1中的PtZn簇。框架杂原子如Ti也被用来固定浸渍的金属。

2. 是的,文章评估了如超快结晶和配体辅助合成等金属封装策略,以掺入分子筛内的金属纳米簇。这通过防止聚结和活性位点流失来改善稳定性。例如,封装的PtZn簇在S-1中经过220小时反应后没有失活,而浸渍催化剂快速失活。

3. 文章讨论了如在含杂原子分子筛上浸渍、在分子筛合成过程中掺入金属以及表层工程等技术来优化分散度。例子包括在Sn-SBA-15上浸渍Pt,Sn固定Pt;在S-1中直接水热合成PtZn簇;以及选择蚀刻生成PtM@Pt/SBA-15核壳结构。

4. 是的,文章利用了原位DRIFTS、XRD、XAS、XPS和TPSR等技术来研究丙烷脱氢催化剂。这些提供了有关活性位点种类、预处理和反应过程中的变化、反应机理以及共饲料效应等信息。

5. 先进的微观技术如AC-STEM和iDPC-STEM被用来可视化金属分子筛界面上的隔离金属原子和纳米簇。这确认了成功的封装和分散优化策略。

6. 是的,XANES被用来显示反应条件下封装的Zn2+和Ga3+种被部分还原为Znδ+和Ga+ ,这与催化活性相关。

7. 否,文章没有评估丙烷脱氢的不同反应器类型。它聚焦于催化剂合成和表征。
