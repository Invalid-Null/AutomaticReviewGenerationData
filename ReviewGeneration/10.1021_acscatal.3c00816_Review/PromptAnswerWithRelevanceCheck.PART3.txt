[1] "Zhu et al. (48) reported that the framework Ti in TS-1 zeolites contributes to the dispersion of impregnated PtZn species and increases the electron density on Pt, which exhibits higher propane conversion (54.4%) than PtZnTi/S-1 catalyst (20%) without framework Ti species."

[2] "Wu et al. (20) reported the in situ encapsulation of isolated Co2+ sites within the S-1 framework with the assistance of ammonia. The ammonia reacts with Co2+ ions to produce [Co(NH3)6]2+ species in the alkaline hydrothermal precursor, which avoids the Co(OH)x precipitation toward successful encapsulation." 

[3] "Recently, Zhao et al. (92) developed a MgO modified ZnOx/S-1 system to suppress the volatilization of ZnOx species during PDH reaction. The formation of stable Zn-O-Mg bonds was confirmed by FTIR, XPS, and XAFS measurements."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

1. The article discusses techniques like using ligand additives during zeolite hydrothermal synthesis to stabilize isolated metal ions or clusters within the zeolitic framework. Examples include using ammonia to produce [Co(NH3)6]2+ species to incorporate isolated Co2+ sites in S-1, and using ethylenediamine to disperse PtZn clusters in S-1. Framework heteroatoms like Ti are also used to anchor impregnated metals.

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation strategies like ultrafast crystallization and ligand-assisted synthesis to incorporate metal nanoclusters within zeolites. This improves stability by preventing sintering and loss of active sites. For example, encapsulated PtZn clusters in S-1 exhibited no deactivation after 220 h, while impregnated catalysts deactivated quickly.

3. The article discusses techniques like impregnation on heteroatom-containing zeolites, incorporation of metals during zeolite synthesis, and subsurface engineering to optimize dispersion. Examples include impregnating Pt on Sn-SBA-15 where Sn anchors Pt, direct hydrothermal synthesis of PtZn clusters in S-1, and selective etching to produce core-shell PtM@Pt/SBA-15.

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ DRIFTS, XRD, XAS, XPS, and TPSR to study propane dehydrogenation catalysts. These provide insights into active site speciation, changes during pretreatment and reaction, reaction mechanisms, and effects of co-feeds.

5. Advanced microscopy like AC-STEM and iDPC-STEM were used to visualize isolated metal atoms and nanoclusters at metal-zeolite interfaces. This confirms successful encapsulation and dispersion optimization strategies.

6. Yes, XANES was used to show partial reduction of encapsulated Zn2+ and Ga3+ species to Znδ+ and Ga+ under reaction conditions, relating changes in metal oxidation state to catalytic activity.

7. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on catalyst synthesis and characterization.

[2] The ethylenediamine-assisted hydrothermal method. For example, Xie et al. (25) employed ethylenediamine as a ligand to encapsulate isolated Zn2+ cations within the S-1 zeolites. The isolated Zn2+ species were trapped in the SiOH groups.

[3] Liu et al. (24) encapsulated K-PtSn species (single atom and clusters) within S-1 zeolites through a similar one-pot hydrothermal process with ethylenediamine as the ligands. 

[4] Yu et al. (22) developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy based on the combination of precursor age, seed additives, and fast-heating tubular reactor. The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits initial propane conversion of 65%, which is much higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5.
