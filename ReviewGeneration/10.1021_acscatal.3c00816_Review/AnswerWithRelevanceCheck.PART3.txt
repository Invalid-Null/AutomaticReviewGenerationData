          [1] "Zhu et al. (48) reported that the framework Ti in TS-1 zeolites contributes to the dispersion of impregnated PtZn species and increases the electron density on Pt, which exhibits higher propane conversion (54.4%) than PtZnTi/S-1 catalyst (20%) without framework Ti species."

          [2] "Wu et al. (20) reported the in situ encapsulation of isolated Co2+ sites within the S-1 framework with the assistance of ammonia. The ammonia reacts with Co2+ ions to produce [Co(NH3)6]2+ species in the alkaline hydrothermal precursor, which avoids the Co(OH)x precipitation toward successful encapsulation."  

          [3] "In situ Zn K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies indicate that Zn/Na-ZSM-5 contains isolated and stable (ZnOH)+ species at the exchange position, while the (ZnOH)+ species in Zn/H-ZSM-5 would react with neighboring zeolite OH groups to produce isolated (O-Zn2+-O) sites."

          The article discusses techniques like using ligand additives during zeolite hydrothermal synthesis to stabilize isolated metal ions or clusters within the zeolitic framework. Examples include using ammonia to produce [Co(NH3)6]2+ species to incorporate isolated Co2+ sites in S-1, and using ethylenediamine to disperse PtZn clusters in S-1. Framework heteroatoms like Ti are also used to anchor impregnated metals. XAS studies also show that isolated and stable (ZnOH)+ sites can be produced in ZSM-5 zeolites.

          [1] "Yu et al. [22] developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy based on the combination of precursor age, seed additives, and fast-heating tubular reactor (Figure 5b)."  

          [2] "The encapsulation of metal sites within zeolites along with their crystallization (i.e., direct synthesis procedure) is promising to avoid the superficial metal species in postsynthesis procedure."

      <English>
          Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation strategies like ultrafast crystallization and ligand-assisted synthesis to incorporate metal nanoclusters within zeolites. This improves stability by preventing sintering and loss of active sites. For example, encapsulated PtZn clusters in S-1 exhibited no deactivation after 220 h, while impregnated catalysts deactivated quickly.

          是的,文章评估了如超快结晶和配体辅助合成等金属封装策略,以掺入分子筛内的金属纳米簇。这通过防止聚结和活性位点流失来改善稳定性。例如,封装的PtZn簇在S-1中经过220小时反应后没有失活,而浸渍催化剂快速失活。

          [1] "Ethylenediamine was used as the protecting ligand to prevent Pt and Zn ions from aggregation in the alkaline hydrothermal precursor, which slows down the precipitation of PtZn to match the zeolite crystallization rate in a time scale."

          [2] "Pt and M species (M = Ni, Fe, Co) were impregnated on an SBA-15 support to form PtM/SBA-15. Then, selective etching of the superficial M atoms by HNO3 produces PtM@Pt/SBA-15 with a Pt-shell and PtM-core structure."

          The article discusses techniques like impregnation on heteroatom-containing zeolites, incorporation of metals during zeolite synthesis, and subsurface engineering to optimize dispersion. Examples include impregnating Pt on Sn-SBA-15 where Sn anchors Pt, direct hydrothermal synthesis of PtZn clusters in S-1, and selective etching to produce core-shell PtM@Pt/SBA-15.

          Yes, the article utilizes in-situ DRIFT spectroscopy combined with pulse titration experiments to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. One example is probing the evolution of Ga and In species on CHA zeolites during H2 reduction to show they displace Bronsted acid sites and form isolated cationic species that are active for the reaction.
