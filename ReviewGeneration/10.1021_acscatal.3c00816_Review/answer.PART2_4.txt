[1] "The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits initial propane conversion of 65%, which is much higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5."

[2] "Among the investigated catalysts, PtFe/Sn-SBA-15 shows the highest initial propane conversion, while PtIn/Sn-SBA-15 exhibits the best catalytic stability."  

[3] "The Pt3Ga intermetallic alloys on hierarchical zeolites exhibit an initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion), and the conversion remains >8% after 30 days of reaction."

[4] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions."

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts including Pt-Sn, Pt-Ga, and Pt-Zn for propane dehydrogenation. Pt-Sn/ZSM-5 shows higher initial conversion than Pt/Sn-ZSM-5. PtFe/Sn-SBA-15 has the highest initial conversion while PtIn/Sn-SBA-15 has the best stability among SBA-15 supported catalysts. Pt-Ga intermetallic alloy on hierarchical zeolite maintains 8% conversion after 30 days. Pt-Zn on Beta zeolite approaches equilibrium conversion with 90% propylene selectivity.

[1] "ZSM-5 and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 1–2), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size."

[2] "The zeolitic framework surrounding the encapsulated Pt species suppressed propylene desorption, which reduces propylene selectivity and increases coke deposits."

[3] "The Pt3Ga intermetallic alloys on hierarchical zeolites exhibit an initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion), and the conversion remains >8% after 30 days of reaction." 

[4] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions."

6. Yes, the article evaluates MFI and BEA zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation, citing their facile synthesis, tunable acidity and suitable pore size. MFI suppresses propylene desorption while BEA approaches equilibrium conversion. Pt-Ga alloy on hierarchical MFI maintains 8% conversion after 30 days. Pt-Zn on BEA reaches 90% propylene selectivity near equilibrium conversion.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

6. 是��,该文评估了MFI和BEA沸石作为丙烷脱氢反应载体,并提到它们易合成、酸度可调节以及适宜的孔径。MFI抑制丙烯解吸,而BEA接近平衡转化。分层MFI上的Pt-Ga合金在30天后保持8%的转化率。 BEA上的Pt-Zn在接近平衡转化的条件下达到90%的丙烯选择性。

[1] "By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta)."

[2] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

7. Yes, the article investigates tuning zeolite Si/Al ratio by dealumination to create silanol nests in Beta zeolites. This enhances metal dispersion and stabilization.
