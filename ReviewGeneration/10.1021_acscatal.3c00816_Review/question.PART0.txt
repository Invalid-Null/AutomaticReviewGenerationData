Recent Progress in Metal-Molecular Sieve Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation
Abstract
Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive technology for propylene production that has received extensive attention. Molecular sieves with uniform porous structure, high thermal stability, and unique confinement capability have been proven to be ideal supports for well-dispersed active sites to generate efficient PDH performance. In this review, we describe the progress in the synthesis and PDH performance of metal-molecular sieve catalysts, including metal-mesoporous silica, metal-zeolite, and metal-hierarchical zeolite catalysts. The strategies in identifying and regulating active site microstructure and metal-molecular sieve interactions as well as their correlations with active site structure and PDH mechanism are introduced simultaneously. Finally, the current limitations and future opportunities of metal-molecular sieve materials in the PDH reaction are also discussed. This review is expected to provide some guidance for future catalyst design based on utilizing the molecular sieves structural confinement to facilitate propane activation and active site stabilization.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propylene is the important raw material for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, propylene oxide, etc. (Figure 1a). (1) According to a report from IHS Markit Ltd. and Dow Chemical Inc., the global propylene supply demand market renders a big gap since 2015, and the propylene demand would keep growing at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% up to 2030 (Figure 1b). (2,3) Conventional propylene production mainly comes from fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil. Due to the rapid consumption of crude oil, these traditional propylene production technologies cannot satisfy current and future demands well. Therefore, the development of highly efficient propylene production technologies is of vital importance. Over the past few decades, researchers have developed several new technologies for propylene production, including propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH), propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), methanol-to-olefin (MTO), and FischerTropsch to olefin (FTO). Especially, PDH is recognized as the most promising method considering following aspects: (1) The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c). (2)

To date, several PDH technologies have been developed and industrialized. Among them, Oleflex and Catofin have the widest applications, which, respectively, rely on Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts. The high cost of Pt and environmental issues of CrOx drive researchers to explore efficient nonprecious and nontoxic alternatives. (2,4) PDH is acknowledged as a structure-insensitive reaction where the CH bond cleavage can occur on every metal or metaloxygen site, while the undesired CC cracking reactions are typical structure-sensitive reactions that prefer to occur on aggregated sites. (6) Therefore, the design of subnanometric or single-site reactive centers could benefit the propylene yield, which is also the general trend for developing PDH catalysts. (1,2,4,79) However, PDH is a typical thermodynamically limited process that requires a high reaction temperature. In the meantime, the removal of coke deposits from spent catalysts requires frequent regeneration. The harsh PDH conditions (i.e., high temperature, strongly reductive atmosphere, and frequent regeneration) easily cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and structural reconstruction. The stabilization of subnanometric active sites requires large surface area support with a strong metalsupport interaction, which cannot be fully satisfied by conventional Al2O3 support. Researchers have developed defective Al2O3 to improve the metal stabilization and catalytic performance. (1012) Unfortunately, the insufficient Al3+5c concentration (27%) restricts the amount of stabilized metal sites (10) and thereby limits the catalytic performance. Besides, the relatively complicated synthesis procedure (synthesis of 0.5 g of defective Al2O3 nanosheets requires 180 mL of precursor) also limits the large-scale application. (10,13)
Valuable lessons could be learned from the mature fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) technologies that also operate in harsh conditions, which initially employ the SiO2Al2O3-based catalysts and gradually turn to molecular sieve (zeolite)-based catalysts. (14) Compared to Al2O3 or other oxide supports, the molecular sieve supports possess a larger specific surface area and well-defined pores/cavities, which have been proven to possess stronger capability to prevent subnanometric metal species from sintering. (15)
Considering these advantages of molecular sieves, researchers have developed several efficient strategies to stabilize highly dispersed active sites on/within molecular sieves, which exhibit outstanding catalytic PDH performance, especially in catalytic lifetime and propylene selectivity. (1640) In the past decade, the number of studies about molecular sieve-based PDH catalysts has reached up to 783 and is still rapidly growing based on the data from Web of Science (Figure 1d).
PDH serves as an important industrial reaction, and there have been several reviews involving the PDH technologies and catalyst development. (1,2,4,69) In 2014, Sattler (1) reported a pioneering review that summarized the catalytic alkane dehydrogenation on metals and metal oxides. The advances in catalyst design, such as single-atom catalysis, subsurface modification, organometallic chemistry, metal-hydrides chemistry, and so on, were further summarized in several recent reviews. (2,68,41) Othroshchenko (9) reviewed the developments of defective bulk oxide catalysts (e.g., ZrO2, TiO2, and γ-Al2O3) for the PDH reaction, wherein the coordinative unsaturated metal sites (MCus) due to oxygen vacancies display promising PDH performance. In addition to catalyst design, Li et al. (4) reviewed the advances in understanding PDH mechanisms (stepwise or concerted pathway) as well as the novel moving-bed and fluidized-bed PDH reactors. These previous PDH reviews generally summarize the catalytic systems based on elements of the active site, which describe the metal-molecular sieve catalysts as a part of support regulation. Recently, Sun et al. (42) summarized the advances in zeolite-based PDH catalysts. As indicated in Figure 1e, apart from zeolites, ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) and hierarchical zeolites are also typical molecular sieves. To provide a direct impression of the catalyst development based on molecular sieve supports, Tables 12 provide an overview of metal-molecular sieve PDH catalysts and representative catalysts on the basis of metal-oxide supports or bulk catalysts. Figure 2 illustrates an activity comparison of catalysts tested under industrial relevant conditions (propane conversion of at least 20% at reactants contain at least 20 vol % propane (9)) with respect to propylene productivity and the deactivation rate.

The hierarchical zeolite supported Pt catalysts typically show propylene productivity of 46 kgC3H6·kgcat1·h1 at a deactivation rate of 00.02 h1, which are superior to those on OMS, zeolite, and metal-oxide supports. Several promising Pt-hierarchical zeolite materials exhibit outstanding catalytic lifetimes that lasted longer than 300 h under industrially relevant conditions. (38,39,60) As for Pt-free catalysts, the promising Co and Zn-containing molecular sieve catalysts exhibit propylene productivity of 0.52 kgC3H6·kgcat1·h1) at a deactivation rate of 00.2 h1, which exhibits certain superiority compared to the counterparts on metal-oxide supports and the represented bulk ZrO2. In this regard, a review about the synthesis and structurefunction relationships of these molecular sieve-supported materials for PDH reaction is necessary and informative. Hereafter, we will discuss the advances in PDH based on metal-OMS materials (section 2), metal-zeolites (section 3), and metal-hierarchical zeolites (section 4). Several representative metalorganic framework (MOF) derived PDH catalysts on MFI zeolites were also introduced in section 3. Afterward, the challenges and perspectives on molecular sieve-based PDH materials were proposed (section 5). We expect that this perspective can provide some scientific guidance for designing more efficient PDH catalysts.
2. Metal-OMS Catalysts
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
OMS is a commonly used support in PDH, which is generally synthesized via a self-assembly process. In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity. (75,122) MCM-41 and SBA-15 are typical mesoporous silica materials with a hexagonal structure and long 1D pores. The VOx or CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 has been widely investigated in PDH reactions, which show considerable propylene productivity, but suffer from fast deactivation (Table 2). (75,7779) For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction. (78) Besides, the as-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior propylene productivity but inferior catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts. The results indicate that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for the deactivation. The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%. The calcination of impregnated Cr/MCM-41 in flowing air (Cr/MCM-41-FC) can promote the CrOx dispersion, which contributes to superior PDH performance compared to the counterpart calcinated in static air (Cr/MCM-41-TC). (123) In-situ Raman spectra revealed that Cr species in impregnated catalysts (after drying) exist in the form of CrO42. When the sample was calcinated in flowing air, the CrO42 species would dehydrate into isolated Cr6+ species in the form of CrO3. However, when the sample was calcinated in static air, the CrO42 species remained stable at 350 C, and further increasing the calcination temperature resulted in aggregated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline Cr2O3. Recently, He (77) reported that adsorbed water is essential to facilitate dispersion of Co species on SBA-15. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra reveal that adsorbed water could react with an impregnated Co(NO3)2 precursor to form [Co(H2O)6]2+ intermediates, which facilitates the dehydroxylation on SBA-15 support toward tetrahedral (Td) Co2+ sites during a direct H2 reduction process. The PDH reactivity over a series of Co/SBA-15 catalysts was positively correlated with the number of Td Co2+ sites. The optimized catalyst with the highest amount of Td Co2+ sites achieves a propane conversion of 37% and propylene selectivity of 96%.
In addition to impregnating metal species on molecular sieves, the coassembly of the metal precursor and silica source enables the metal species to be incorporated within the framework of MCM-41 and SBA-15. For example, Co@MCM-41 with only tetrahedral framework Coδ+ (δ = 23) species can be synthesized through a one-pot hydrothermal process. (16) This Co@MCM-41 was used as a model catalyst to investigate the effect of H2 prereduction on the Co structure and PDH activity. The as-prepared (unreduced) Co-MCM-41 exhibits a propane TOF of 0.004 s1 and propylene selectivity of 92%. The prereduction at 650 C to 700 C allows partial Co species to migrate to the extraframework forming small Co nanoparticles (3 nm), which display a superior TOF of 0.012 s1 with a propylene selectivity of 95%. Higher prereduction temperatures (>750 C) result in larger Co nanoparticles (>8 nm), which reduces the propylene selectivity (46%) due to CC cracking and overdehydrogenation.
Apart from acting as active sites, the framework heteroatoms in the OMS can serve as anchor sites to stabilize the postimpregnated metal/oxide species, which typically exhibit superior PDH performance compared to the coimpregnated counterparts. (28,31) For example, Li et al. (28) prepared Sn-SBA-15 with framework Sn and Sn/SBA-15 with impregnated SnOx species. The framework Sn species with a strong Sn-support interaction can better maintain the oxidation state of Sn during the PDH reaction. As a result, Pt/Sn-SBA-15 exhibits a higher propane conversion (43.8%) and propylene selectivity (98.5%) than the PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst (39.6% and 95%). Particularly, H2 temperature programmed desorption (H2-TPD) measurements reveal that the framework Sn species contribute to hydrogen desorption and spillover, which inhibits Pt sintering and facilitates the transfer of coke from Pt sites to the support. (124) The same group (29,30) also investigated the effect of second promoters (M = Ce, La, In, Fe, Mg) on the PDH performance over trimetallic PtM/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts. Among the investigated catalysts, PtFe/Sn-SBA-15 shows the highest initial propane conversion, while PtIn/Sn-SBA-15 exhibits the best catalytic stability. The Pt sintering and coke deposits are the main deactivation issues. For synthesizing PtIn/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts, the control of the hydrothermal reaction temperature enables regulation of the pore size of Sn-SBA-15 supports from 5 to 14 nm. (32) The best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 46.9% was obtained on the catalyst with a medium pore size (7.6 nm). For the supports with a smaller pore size (5.3 nm), the diffusion of impregnated metallic precursors was limited, while for the ones with larger pores (11.0 and 13.7 nm), the metal aggregation during the reaction becomes dramatic. Both cases lead to an inferior PDH performance.
Gong et al. (43) reported a pioneering work which uses a subsurface engineering strategy to improve the PDH performance. The Pt and M species (M = Ni, Fe, Co) were impregnated on an SBA-15 support to form PtM/SBA-15. Then, selective etching of the superficial M atoms by HNO3 produces PtM@Pt/SBA-15 with a Pt-shell and PtM-core structure. The Pt-shell structure can restrain CC cracking reactions on transition metal (M = Ni, Fe, Co) sites. Moreover, the subsurface PtM species enrich the electron density of superficial Pt sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the electronic enriched Pt has a more negative d-band center, while the d-band center values negatively correlate with propylene selectivity for PtM@Pt models. As a result, the PtFe@Pt/SBA-15 catalyst with subsurface PtFe modification exhibits 85% propylene selectivity, which is 10% higher than that of the Pt/SBA-15 catalyst.
Although the MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported catalysts have attracted steady attention in PDH, their long-range 1D channel structure may cause mass transport limitations for reactants (125) or metal precursors (32) during the impregnation step. Karakoulia et al. (126) investigated the effect of the support on PDH performance for a set of OMS supported VOx catalysts. The propane conversions follow the sequence of 4V/hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) > 4V/MCM-41 > 4V/SBA-15  4V/MCF. For the SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts, the mesopores would be partially destructed during NH4VO3 impregnation, resulting in the formation of an amorphous silica phase that is unfavorable for VOx dispersion, and accordingly the PDH activity. In comparison, the HMS support possesses a 3D wormhole pore structure, leading to a better VOx dispersion and enhanced catalytic activity. Similar to M-MCM-41 or M-SBA-15 materials, the in situ coassembly process also enables SnOx, CoOx, and Pd species to be incorporated within the HMS framework, which exhibits a stronger antireduction and anticoking capacity compared to the impregnated counterparts. (17,18,81) Notably, the Sn containing a hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) catalyst was synthesized with dodecylamine as the surfactant. (17) The incorporation of Sn within the HMS framework strengthens the SiOSn bonds, which inhibits the reduction and loss of Sn species. Specifically, the Sn content in Sn-HMS decreases from 3.58 to 3.54 wt % after 166 h of PDH reaction, which is indicative of 1.1 wt % loss of Sn species. The Sn loss is much lower than that in the Sn/SiO2 catalyst during a 70 h reaction (Sn loss of 6.0 wt %). This Sn-HMS obtained 40% propane conversion with 90% propylene selectivity. No deactivation was detected after the 170 h test, even after three oxidative regenerations.
The dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (DMSN) is another advanced mesoporous silica support, which was typically synthesized using quaternary ammonium cationic surfactants (CTAB, CTAC, etc.). (127) Researchers have indicated that the 3D interconnected central-radial porous structure, larger pore entrance, and uniform monodispersed morphology of DMSN can facilitate the accessibility of active sites and the diffusion efficiency of reactants compared to MCM-41, SBA-15, and HMS materials. (82) The addition of sodium salicylate in the synthesis precursor could increase the surface area and pore diameter of the DMSN support, leading to enhanced PDH performance for Sn-DMSN catalysts. (82) Besides, addition of an appropriate amount of sodium salicylate (φ = 1.5) would weaken the SnOSi bond strength to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Sn species upon H2 pretreatment, which improves the PDH activity. The optimized catalyst with 2.5 wt % Sn loading and φ value of 1.25 exhibits a propylene formation TOF of 0.021 s1 with a propylene selectivity of 88%. Wang et al. (128) revealed that simultaneous addition of Si and Cr sources during synthesis leads to the highest Cr dispersion on the DMSN support, resulting in superior performance of PDH. In comparison, later Cr addition leads to poor CrOx dispersion and partial blockage of DMSN channels, while earlier Cr addition produces Cr6+ species wrapped in the DMSN center, which limits the contact with reactants. Both cases lead to inferior activity. Fan et al. (44) prepared the Mn-substituted DMSN (Mn-DMSN) catalyst as a support for Pt active species. The introduction of MnOx species consumes partial silanol groups and decreases the negative charge for the Mn-DMSN support, which benefits the dispersion of the negatively charged [PtCl6]2 precursor during impregnation (Figure 3a). During the calcination and reduction processes, the MnOx species would react with Pt to form PtxMny alloys with different stoichiometric ratios on the basis of the Mn loadings. The alloyed Mn would donate electrons to Pt and isolate the Pt assembles, which helps the propylene desorption to suppress the formation of coke deposits. The Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN catalyst exhibits a deactivation rate of 0.06 h1, which is smaller than that of the Pt/DMSN (0.18 h1). Moreover, DFT calculations reveal that the Pt3Mn structure possesses a stronger CH bond activation ability than Pt4, which is consistent with the highest TOF of Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN catalyst (Figure 3b).

Recently, Wang et al. (84) reported novel silica nanomeshes (SiO2 NMs) that possesses abundant oxygen vacancies to anchor cobalt single atoms (Co SAs) sites for PDH. The SiO2 NMs possess ultrashort 3D channels (pore size of 3.7 nm) with a large surface area of 804 m2·g1, and this ordered porous structure could be maintained after 900 C calcination. The ultrashort 3D channels of SiO2 NMs were formed by gasifying carbon in self-assembled SiO2@polymer composites in air. Moreover, the carbon gasification process results in abundant oxygen (O*) defects within SiO2 NMs channels, which help produce three unique coordinated Co SAs sites (Figure 3c). Benefiting from the coordinative unsaturated and reduction-resistant Co SAs sites and the ultrashort 3D channels of SiO2 NMs support, this Co SAs/SiO2 NMs catalyst exhibits superior PDH activity (TOFCo = 196 h1, Figure 3d) and propylene selectivity (95%) compared to Co SAs/SiO2 (TOF = 49 h1 and propylene selectivity is 83%).
3. Metal-Zeolite Catalysts
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials consisting of tetrahedra TO4 (T could be Si, Al, P, etc.) linked together at the oxygen corners to form a uniform three-dimensional network. (129) The synthesis method of metal-zeolite catalysts mainly includes postsynthesis (e.g., ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduce metal sites along with zeolite crystallization).
Ion exchange procedure relies on the negative charge of zeolite framework (arising from Al substitution) to stabilize exchanged metal ions, which limits the metal loadings and metal types, as well as propylene selectivity. (130) Therefore, the preparation of metal-zeolite PDH catalysts employ impregnation and direct synthesis method. The developed zeolite materials were assigned to 235 framework types based on International Zeolite Association. Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 12), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size. Hereafter, the advances in metal-zeolite PDH catalysts would be in turn discussed based on their topologic structure and synthesis method.
3.1. MFI Zeolite-Based Catalysts
3.1.1. Postsynthesis Method
Kumar et al. (131) synthesized a set of catalysts with identical Pt loadings and similar Pt dispersion but varied pore geometries (SBA-15, Beta, and ZSM-5). Among the investigated catalysts, Pt-ZSM-5 with the smallest pores shows the highest TOF of 0.24 s1, followed by Pt-Beta (0.21 s1) and Pt-SBA-15 (0.17 s1). Besides, the propylene selectivity over microporous Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta is also higher than that over mesoporous Pt-SBA-15. The authors attributed the superior performance of microporous materials to the small 3D pores, which may facilitate the interaction between active sites and reactants. Similar to the case for an OMS, ZSM-5 also enables various heteroatoms to be incorporated within its framework to anchor impregnated Pt species. For example, Zhang et al. (33,34) reported that Sn substituted ZSM-5 (Sn-ZSM-5) was a promising support to load PtNa species for PDH. The resulting PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibits propane conversion of 39% with a propylene selectivity of 98%. Notably, the propane conversion could be retained at >30% with almost unchanged propylene selectivity during a 75 h stability test. The deactivation rate is only 0.006 h1, which is lower than that of PtNa/ZSM-5 (0.024 h1) and PtNaSn/ZSM-5 (0.014 h1) synthesized via the coimpregnation method. The superior catalytic stability of PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 is due to the stronger antireduction capacity of incorporated SnOx species, which is favorable for the stabilization of metallic Pt sites on Sn oxides. This helps transfer coke deposits from Pt active sites to the support and benefits the catalytic stability. (132,133) Besides, a H2 cofeed would also contribute to the catalytic stability because a H2 cofeed helps weaken the propylene adsorption strength and surface coverage of coke precusors. (134) ZSM-5 zeolites were also attractive for Pt-free PDH catalysts. Chen et al. (85) compared the PDH performance of impregnated ZnOx species on various supports including SiO2, Al2O3, and ZSM-5 (with differing SAR values). SiO2 and Al2O3 supported ZnO exhibit almost no PDH activity. On ZSM-5 zeolites with low SAR, the Zn species mainly exchange with the Bronsted acidic protons to produce isolated Zn2+ cations and a small part of ZnO particles. These catalysts exhibit a high initial propane conversion of 85%, but soon decrease to 30% after 6 h of reaction. The fast deactivation is associated with low propylene selectivity (20%), which is caused by the serious cracking reactions due to strong Bronsted acid sites. On high-silica ZSM-5 (SAR = 250) zeolites, the Zn species tend to form small ZnO nanoparticles (4.5 nm) that strongly bonded with the zeolite framework, which exhibit a superior propane conversion of 60% and propylene selectivity of >80%. Similarly, this group reported that high-silica ZSM-5 supported CrOx also displays superior PDH activity compared to low-silica ZSM-5, SiO2, and Al2O3 supports. (86) Higher SAR leads to a decreased total acidity for CrOx/ZSM-5 catalysts. The total acidity positively correlates with the propane conversions, while it negatively correlates with the propylene selectivity. Notably, by fixing the Cr loading and SAR value, the propylene productivity on CrOx/H-ZSM-5 is 35 times higher than that of CrOx/Na-ZSM-5. The C3H8-TPD measurements evidence that Na+ doping weakens the propane adsorption ability. Accordingly, the author indicated a strong synergy between Bronsted acid sites and the Lewis acidic CrOx sites, which promotes propane adsorption and CH bond activation on the CrOx/ZSM-5 catalyst.
Such a Lewis-Bronsted synergy effect in catalyzing PDH reactions was more carefully analyzed in the Ga/ZSM-5 system. Schreiber et al. (135) found that the propane dehydrogenation rate increases at low Ga/Al ratios (<0.5) and reaches maximum at Ga/Al = 0.5, while further increasing the Ga/Al ratios leads to a decreased dehydrogenation rate. By quantifying the amount of Lewis and Bronsted acid sites with pyridine-FTIR spectra, the authors found that the amount of Ga+ Lewis acidic sites was comparable to that of Si(OH)Al Bronsted acid sites for the catalysts with Ga/Al = 0.5, creating the highest amount of Lewis-Bronsted acidic pairs. During the reaction, the Bronsted acid site can protonate Ga+ to form [GaH]2+ species, which was indicated by the shift of the Ga K-edge white line peak from 10374.3 to 10370.2 eV in XANES spectra. DFT calculations indicate that the propane CH bond activation enthalpy barrier decreases from 176 kJ·mol1 on Ga+ sites to 56 kJ·mol1 on [GaH]2+ sites. Besides, the Bronsted acidic protons can also help eliminate H2 via a reaction with dehydrogenated H* species with a low barrier of 80 kJ mol1. Bell et al. (88,136) also indicated [GaH]2+ as an active center for both propane dehydrogenation and cracking, which was evidenced by the fact that [GaH]2+-normalized dehydrogenation and cracking rates are independent of the Ga/Al ratios. Besides, the reaction rates are first order in C3H8 at low C3H8 pressure and become zero-order kinetics at higher C3H8 pressure. Increasing H2 pressure in reactants leads to decreased reaction rates as indicated by the negative reaction order in H2, which is because the [GaH]2+ converts to a paired [GaH2]+-H+ site upon a H2 cofeed. Together with the experimental apparent activation energies and the DFT-calculated intrinsic activation enthalpies, it was indicated that both dehydrogenation and cracking reactions initiate through the heterolytic dissociation of propane at [GaH]2+ sites to produce [C3H7-GaH]+-H+. Then dehydrogenation proceeds via β-H elimination from C3H7* intermediates to produce C3H6 and H2 products, which act as the rate limiting step. On the other hand, cracking proceeds via rate limiting CC cleavage of C3H7*. Kinetic experiments also indicate the dehydrogenation TOF over [GaH]2+ sites is >2-times as that of cracking. (88) Yuan (137) proposed that instead of forming [GaHx] sites, the protons in Bronsted acid sites would remain stable and cooperate with the Ga sites in the form of a Ga+-H+ pair. The propane would be activated on the Ga+-H+ pair sites, followed by hydride elimination and the concurrent formation of C3H6 and H2. GaH acts as an intermediate in the PDH reaction, rather than a reactive site. The amounts of isolated Ga and the Ga+-H+ pair could be controlled by regulating SAR and Ga/Al ratios. The intrinsic activity of the Ga+-H+ pair is 15 times higher than that of isolated Ga+. The same group (87) further identified a unique Ga2O22+ site based on a set of H2/O2-pulsing experiments. In the 0.042 O2-pulsing experiments, the catalysts with Ga/Al  0.042 show no H2O formation and O2 consumption signals, indicating that these catalysts contain no oxidizable Ga sites (e.g., GaHx sites and Ga+-H+ pairs). In comparison, the samples with Ga/Al > 0.042 contain certain oxidizable Ga sites. The Co-exchanged (one exchanged Co2+ ion consumes one Al pair) ZSM-5 supported Ga sites exhibit comparable H2O formation and O2 consumption signals as parent ZSM-5 in the O2-pulse, while a negative correlation between Co-exchanged extent and GaHx formation was observed in H2-pulsing experiments. These quantitative pulse titration experiments identify two types of Ga sites with distinct redox properties: (1) Ga2O22+ site stabilized by framework Al pairs, which is redox-inert in H2 or O2 at 550 C; (2) the conventional isolated Ga+ site, which is redox-active. The further C3H8 pulsing experiments reveal that the Ga2O22+ site possesses a higher PDH reaction rate (0.478 molC3H8·molGa1·s1), which is about 20 times that of isolated Ga+ sites.
In addition to the above-described Bronsted-Lewis synergy effect, (86,135,137) there is also a contrary viewpoint that Bronsted acid sites only act as cracking sites but do not contribute to PDH. (107,138) Iglesia et al. (138) reported that Zn/Na-ZSM-5 has higher propane conversion than Zn/H-ZSM-5 by a factor of 4. In situ Zn K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies indicate that Zn/Na-ZSM-5 contains isolated and stable (ZnOH)+ species at the exchange position, while the (ZnOH)+ species in Zn/H-ZSM-5 would react with neighboring zeolite OH groups to produce isolated (O-Zn2+-O) sites. Compared to Zn/H-ZSM-5, the Zn/Na-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits a higher content of deuterated products in C3H8-D2 cofeed reactions, confirming that (ZnOH)+ sites could facilitate the H2 recombination/step process toward enhanced PDH performance.
S-1 is the Al-free analogue of ZSM-5. The absence of Bronsted acid sites facilitates propylene desorption toward superior propylene selectivity compared to the counterparts with ZSM-5 supports. For example, Liu et al. (89) reported that ZnO/S-1 exhibits propylene selectivity of 90% in PDH, which is higher than ZnO/ZSM-5 (SAR = 250) with a selectivity of 80%. Although the nonacidic S-1 zeolites contribute to propylene selectivity improvement, it also possesses limitations by the lack of efficient anchor sites for impregnated metal species. (52) As a result, part of the metal species would inevitably locate at the outer surface of zeolite crystals during the impregnation process. These superficial metal species would easily sinter into large particles during calcination or the PDH reaction, which is unfavorable for catalytic performance. Ren et al. (96) reported that the calcination atmosphere would largely impact the Co site structure in Co/S-1 systems, which impacts the PDH activity. The characterizations show that oxygen-free calcination (Ar, H2, vacuum) contributes to the formation of Td Co2+ species within the S-1 framework. Taking Ar calcination as an example, the in situ DRIFT measurements reveal that Ar could drive Co precursors to silanol nests, which would contribute to the incorporation of Co species within the S-1 framework. The framework Td Co2+ sites facilitate the Lewis acidity and propane adsorption, exhibiting superior PDH activity against the air-calcinated catalyst with huge extraframework Co3O4 species. Specifically, Co-normalized propane TOF over the Ar calcinated catalysts is nine times that over air calcinated catalyst.
The partial substitution of Si atoms in S-1 by Ti leads to titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1) zeolites. Zhu et al. (48) reported that the framework Ti in TS-1 zeolites contributes to the dispersion of impregnated PtZn species and increases the electron density on Pt, which exhibits higher propane conversion (54.4%) than PtZnTi/S-1 catalyst (20%) without framework Ti species. Moreover, the framework Ti species can consume certain SiOH groups, which would reduce the acidity of catalysts to facilitate propylene desorption, as indicated by C3H6-TPD measurements. Wu et al. (100) reported that the location of the Ti species could be finely tuned by controlling the Si/Ti ratios in TS-1 zeolites, which modulates the dispersion and chemical states of impregnated Co species. A moderate Si/Ti ratio of 30 leads to the coexistence of framework tetrahedral Ti and extraframework TiOx species, which would adjust the metal-zeolite interactions to an appropriate extent that enables the impregnated Co species to exist as a metallic state in PDH but avoids sintering into large nanoparticles. In contrary, smaller Si/Ti ratios (<30) lead to Co sites interacted with TiO2 crystallites, while larger Si/Ti ratios (>50) possess serious Co sintering. These two cases would both result in an inferior PDH performance. The optimal Co/TS-1 (Si/Ti = 30) catalyst obtains an initial propane conversion of 52% and gradually decreases to 26% after a 120 h PDH test with three regeneration cycles. The propylene selectivity remains >95%, and there is no obvious Co sintering throughout the test. Li et al. (46) reported the effect of the TS-1 particle size on PDH performance. TS-1 supports with varied particle sizes from 0.2 to 5 μm were synthesized by controlling the SiO2: TPAOH: H2O ratios in the hydrothermal precursor. The isopropanol additives further decrease the zeolite particle size to 0.1 μm. The zeolite particle sizes do not significantly affect the dispersion of impregnated PtSn species, but impact the mass transfer behavior toward different propane conversions. The PtSn catalyst on smaller-sized TS-1 (0.1 μm) exhibits the highest initial propane conversion of 55% and the least deactivation during a 7 h PDH test. The internal diffusion limitations were observed over large TS-1 zeolites (5.72 μm) based on the Weisz-Prater criterion, which causes the decrease in propane conversion and catalytic stability.
Zhao et al. (90) employed a MOF-assisted impregnation strategy to promote ZnOx dispersion on the S-1 support. First, the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) was used as Zn precursor to disperse onto an S-1 support. The 2-methylimidazole ligands can isolate the Zn species during impregnation and were carbonized to a N-doped C (NC) layer during N2 calcination, which could prevent the sintering and volatilization of Zn species during the PDH reaction. The subsequent HNO3 treatments can partially dissolve ZnO species and generate 2.0 nm ZnO nanoparticles. As a result, the optimal ZnO@NC/S-1 (1.0) exhibits propane conversion of 55%, which is about 3.6 times higher than that of the directly impregnated ZnO/S-1 catalyst. In another work, Wang et al. (95) employed the CoZn bimetallic ZIF-67 as the precursor to introduce highly dispersed CoOx species on the S-1 support (Figure 4a). The Zn species help isolate the CoOx species, which were completely evaporated during the calcination process. The optimized CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst exhibits a propane TOF of 48.5 h1 with a propylene selectivity >97% at 600 C, which is about 4 times that of the counterpart without Zn addition (Figure 4b). All catalysts exhibit an induction period in the form of increased propane conversion in the initial stage, which was attributed to the reduction of the as-prepared Co3+ sites to Co2+ sites. When the NC layer was removed by air treatment at 550 C, the Co2+ sites would be further reduced and aggregated to form bulk metallic Co particles during PDH, resulting in an obvious loss of PDH performance. As a result, the MOF-derived CoO@NC was deemed as an active site for PDH reaction.

The silanol nests arising from Si defects in zeolites can serve as effective anchor sites for metal and oxide sites. Zhao et al. (91) found that when treating the ZnO and silicalite-1 mixtures in a H2 flow, the reduced Zn0 species can react with silanol nests of S-1 to form binuclear Zn-O-Zn species (Figure 4cd). More Si-OH nests contribute to the formation of more Zn-O-Zn species and higher propylene productivity (Figure 4e). The optimized ZnO/S-1_3 with the most Zn-O-Zn sites exhibit exceptional PDH activity with a Zn-related TOF of 239 h1, which is two times higher than the counterparts with single site Zn or ZnO nanoparticles as active sites (Figure 4f). The propylene productivity over this ZnO/S-1_3 catalyst is three times that of commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst at a similar propylene selectivity, which is superior to the reported noble-metal-free PDH systems. This ZnO/S-1_3 catalyst also displays outstanding catalytic stability during a 400 h reaction. In addition, the highly reactive binuclear Zn-O-Zn sites can also be obtained when replacing S-1 by other molecular sieves or oxide supports with abundant Si-OH nests. In situ XAS and EPR spectra identify the coordinative unsaturated (partially reduced) Zn-O-Zn species as reactive center. DFT calculations further reveal that the Zn-O-Zn site possesses a lower apparent activation barrier (1.81 eV) than the single site Zn2+ (2.14 eV), which explains well the experimental observations.
3.1.2. Direct Synthesis Method
The encapsulation of metal sites within zeolites along with their crystallization (i.e., direct synthesis procedure) is promising to avoid the superficial metal species in postsynthesis procedure. However, the time-scale mismatch between the fast metal precipitation and the slow zeolite crystallization still causes challenges for effective encapsulation (Figure 5a). (22) To address this issue, Yu et al. (22) developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy based on the combination of precursor age, seed additives, and fast-heating tubular reactor (Figure 5b). The XRD spectra reveal that complete crystallization (i.e., relative crystallinity of 100%) of ZSM-5 zeolites could be achieved within a 5 min reaction at 170 C. Further increasing the reaction temperature to 190 C can reduce the crystallization time to 2 min. Benefiting from the ultrafast crystallization rate, the PtSn clusters can be fully encapsulated within ZSM-5 zeolites. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) data show that the Pt loadings in silica matrix increase with increasing zeolite crystallinity, which evidence the formation of Pt nanoclusters and show that the crystallization of ZSM-5 proceeds in the same ultrafast pace. In comparison, the Sn species were fully grafted into the silica matrix at the initial synthesis stage. Ultravioletvisible light diffuse reflectance (UVvis DR) spectra reveal that the Sn species initially transform into amorphous SnO2, which subsequently transform into the Td Sn species within the zeolite framework and help improve the Pt dispersion. When fixing the Pt loading at 0.32 wt % and increasing Sn loadings from 0 to 1.2 wt %, the size of PtSn clusters decreases from 4 nm to 1 nm. The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits initial propane conversion of 65%, which is much higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5.

In addition to accelerating the zeolite crystallization rate, slowing down the precipitation rate of metal ions with the assistance of ligand additives is more serviceable to encapsulate highly dispersed metal/oxide sites within the zeolite matrix along with crystallization (Figure 5c).
Yus group (23) reported a ligand-assisted direct H2 reduction strategy to encapsulate subnanometric PtZn clusters within the S-1 matrix. Ethylenediamine was used as the protecting ligand to prevent Pt and Zn ions from aggregation in the alkaline hydrothermal precursor, which slows down the precipitation of PtZn to match the zeolite crystallization rate in a time scale. Moreover, the direct H2 reduction of hydrothermal products also benefits the PtZn dispersion compared to that of the conventional calcination-reduction procedure. The optimized PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst consists of ultrasmall PtZn clusters (1.4 nm, Figure 5d) and obtains a propylene productivity of 65.5 molC3H6·gPt1·h1 (propane WHSV = 108 h1) with a propylene selectivity of 99.3% at 550 C (Figure 5e). This PtZn4@S-1-H is also highly stable throughout a 220 h stability test, which is attributed to the unique antisintering and antireduction capacity of encapsulated PtZn clusters. Besides, the Cs+ additives help to avoid metal migration and aggregation, which further improves the regeneration stability of the catalyst. As the reference materials, the Pt@S-1-H and PtZn4@S-1-C (treated by conventional calcination-reduction process) exhibit a lower propylene selectivity of 80% and fast deactivation during 6 h of the PDH reaction.
Liu et al. (24) encapsulated K-PtSn species (single atom and clusters) within S-1 zeolites through a similar one-pot hydrothermal process with ethylenediamine as the ligands. The K additives condense the SiOH defects to form the (O2K+) species, which stabilize the positively charged Pt species. As a result, the Pt particle size decreases from 4 nm (PtSn@MFI) to 0.9 nm (K-PtSn@MFI). The PtSn species in K-PtSn@MFI catalyst exist as an interfacial Pt-SnOx structure, instead of PtSn alloy. Particularly, the metal species were directly observed by using the advanced integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) technique. For noncalcined K-PtSn@MFI catalyst (i.e., after hydrothermal reaction), Pt species mainly locate in the sinusoidal 10-MR channels, which was because (1) the sinusoidal channels were larger than the straight channels; (2) the intersectional voids were mainly occupied by the TPA+ templates. On the contrary, although the Pt-SnOx species in impregnated K-PtSn/MFI were highly dispersed with a Pt particle size of 0.41.2 nm, they are distributed randomly in the S-1 zeolites. For the PDH reaction, the sinusoidal channel encapsulated Pt-SnOx sites (in K-PtSn@MFI) exhibit an initial propane conversion of 65% and gradually decrease to 50% during the 65 h test. No obvious sintering was observed for spent K-PtSn@MFI. In comparison, the randomly distributed Pt-SnOx sites (in K- PtSn/MFI) exhibit fast deactivation from 50% to 20% during 15 h of reaction. The structural evolution of K-PtSn active sites during H2 prereduction and its influence on PDH activity were further investigated in another work. (35) The K, Pt, and Sn species in noncalcined K-PtSn@MFI (after hydrothermal) were dispersed in the sinusoidal channels of S-1 zeolites. After reduction at 400 C, all Pt4+ species would be reduced to metallic Pt0 and exist as subnanometric Pt clusters, while only a small amount of Sn4+ was reduced to Sn2+. When the reduction was carried out at 600 C for 1 h, most of the Sn4+ species would transform into Sn2+, but the as-formed Sn2+ species still separate from the Pt clusters. After the reduction time was prolonged to 12 h, part of the Sn2+ species would migrate toward Pt clusters to produce PtSn alloys, which were stabilized by framework Sn sites. For the K-PtSn@MFI catalysts with various H2-reduction durations from 0 to 22 h at 600 C, their initial propylene productivity was comparable, while the deactivation rate decreases from 0.12 to 0.01 h1 with a prolonged reduction time.
After the publication of Lius and Yus work, the ligand-assisted synthesis of transition-metal-containing S-1 zeolites attracted growing attention in the PDH area. Xie et al. (25) employed ethylenediamine as a ligand to encapsulate isolated Zn2+ cations within the S-1 zeolites. The isolated Zn2+ species were trapped in the SiOH groups. The optimized Zn-4@S-1 catalyst can achieve a propane conversion of 42% and propylene selectivity of 97%. The in situ near-ambient pressure (NAP) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra reveal the Zn2+ would be partially reduced into Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) during the PDH reaction. Particularly, the cofeed of 0.5 vol% of O2 leads to more than 50% loss of propane conversion. C3H8-temperature programed surface reaction spectroscopy (TPSR) measurements further indicate that cofeed of 0.5 vol% O2 to the system did not influence the propane activation but suppressed the propylene production. Therefore, the authors indicated that the first step of propane activation occurs on Zn2+ sites, while the second step of propane activation requires Znδ+ sites. The O2 feed increases the oxidation state of Zn, which suppresses the formation of Znδ+ species toward decreased propane conversions. Besides, a cofeed of 0.5 vol% H2 did not obviously alter the TPSR profiles of propane consumption and propylene formation, which is because a small amount of H2 would not change the oxidation state of Zn sites. (25) The ethylenediamine ligand also enables bimetallic Ni-Zn and MgO-ZnOx species to be encapsulated within an S-1 matrix. (26,92) For Ni-Zn-S1 system, XPS spectra reveal an electron donation effect from Zn to Ni sites. The electron-enriched Ni favors propylene desorption, which contributes to higher propylene selectivity and fewer coke deposits. (26) The optimized 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S1 catalyst exhibits an initial propane conversion of 32.5% with a propylene selectivity of 90%. Recently, Zhao et al. (92) developed a MgO modified ZnOx/S-1 system to suppress the volatilization of ZnOx species during PDH reaction. The formation of stable Zn-O-Mg bonds was confirmed by FTIR, XPS, and XAFS measurements. The MgO modification did not impact the intrinsic activity of the ZnOx species. Notably, the Zn loss in ZnO/S-1(Mg) is about 15.0% (4.03.4 wt %) after 20 PDH reaction-regeneration cycles under industrial relevant conditions, which is much lower than the Mg-free counterpart with a Zn loss of 28.5% (5.64.0 wt %).
Hu et al. (97) constructed the isolated Co motifs within the S-1 framework via the ethylenediamine-assisted hydrothermal method. The advanced iDPC-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) technique and combined spectroscopic analyses reveal that the incorporated Co motifs exhibit a distorted (SiO)2Co(HOSi)2 coordination, which was homogeneously embedded at the T1(7) and T3(9) sites within the S-1 framework. DFT calculations reveal that the Co sites could activate propane to form the binding C3H7* and H* intermediates, which subsequently evolve into a (SiO)(C3H7)-Co(HOSi)3 coordination The second dehydrogenation step leads to the (SiO) CoHδ(Hδ+OSi)3 structure with the release of one C3H6 molecule. Finally, the reactive center restores its initial state after the H2 coupling-desorption step. The dynamic evolution and restoration of isolated framework Co motifs contribute to outstanding PDH performance with a propylene productivity of 7.2 mmolC3H6·gcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 100%. The zeolite framework provides an effective microenvironment for stabilizing the Co motifs during six reaction-regeneration cycles.
In addition to ethylenediamine, researchers have also explored other types of ligands for encapsulating metal species within zeolites. Yang et al. (19) reported the use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic sodium (EDTA-2Na) to assist in situ incorporation of isolated and reduction-resistant Feδ+ species within the S-1 framework. The resulting FeS1-EDTA catalyst displays good coke resistance in 200 h of an ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) reaction without any deactivation. Wu et al. (20) reported the in situ encapsulation of isolated Co2+ sites within the S-1 framework with the assistance of ammonia. The ammonia reacts with Co2+ ions to produce [Co(NH3)6]2+ species in the alkaline hydrothermal precursor, which avoids the Co(OH)x precipitation toward successful encapsulation. To date, several different ligands have been reported to assist in the encapsulation of metal/oxide species within zeolite. Since these ligands have different sizes, hydrolysis rates, and interactions with a silica matrix, modulating the ligand type and usage may affect the size, distribution, and coordination environment of the encapsulated metal species. (21,140) For example, Song et al. (21) reported the use of cobalt disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate and cobalt acetylacetonate as the metal sources to, respectively, introduce isolated framework Co2+ and extraframework subnanometric CoO clusters (1 nm) within S-1 zeolites. The successful synthesis was evidenced by spherical aberration-corrected (AC)STEM images and in situ DRIFT measurements. Owing to the strong SiOCo interactions, the CoO clusters and framework Co2+ were both reduction-resistant up to 700 C. Notably, the CoO clusters show a TOF value ten times that of the framework Td Co2+ site balanced with Na+ ions. The combined in situ DRIFT and theoretical frequency analysis indicates that the inferior activity of framework Td Co2+ sites (balanced with Na+ ions) may be due to the spatial restriction in propane adsorption/activation caused by the zeolite framework. Consistent with the previous studies, the reduction-resistant CoO clusters also exhibit superior propylene selectivity and catalytic stability than CoOx (evolve into metallic Co in PDH) nanoparticles in a Co/S-1 catalyst. DFT calculations reveal Π-bonding propylene on CoO clusters can prevent the overdehydrogenation reaction, which accounts for its superior propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. The same group (93) further reported the encapsulation of highly dispersed Zn species within S-1 by using zinc acetylacetone as the metal source. Particularly, the authors proposed a unique zinc hydride (ZnH) site transformed from an isolated framework Zn (ZnOH) site as evidenced by a series of in situ DRIFT measurements. AIMD simulations reveal such transformation was achieved by H2 dissociation on the ZnOH site to form a Zn(H)-(OH)3 moiety, and subsequently two OH groups spontaneously reacted to release one H2O molecule while retaining a stable ZnH moiety with a ZnHSi coordination. Kinetic experiments and DFT calculations reveal the ZnH site is more reactive than ZnOx clusters by decreasing the energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step. As a result, the regulation of ZnOH content in fresh catalysts allows control of the amount of in situ produced ZnH species in the PDH reaction. The promoter screening results suggest Cu additives exhibit the best promotive effect. This optimal Cu-ZnO@S-1 catalyst achieves 40% propane conversion with 90% propylene selectivity at 600 C under undiluted propane, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion. The kinetic experiments and DFT calculations indicate that the Cu-ZnO@S-1 catalyst follows a direct PDH mechanism identified by Zhu and colleagues, (107) in which the C3H7* intermediates attack the OH group (formed via the first dehydrogenated H* bond with the O atom in the SiOZn moiety) to directly produce propylene and H2. This direct pathway is kinetically more favorable than the stepwise mechanism involving two dehydrogenation steps and a subsequent H* coupling step. (107)
Apart from stabilizing metal ions, the ligand additives could also regulate the zeolite morphology toward variations in the PDH performance. Lv et al. (99) employed the cobalt acetylacetonate and urea as a Co source and morphology regulator to synthesize nanosheet-like CoO containing S-1 catalysts with controllable b axis thickness (50150 nm). The morphology engineering affects the regioselective localization of subnanometric CoO clusters, which was indicated by deconvolution of the UVvis diffuse-reflectance and in situ NODRIFT spectra. The optimized CoO@MFI-P50 catalyst (b axis of 50 nm) contains the most α-type CoO species located at straight channels of the MFI matrix, which contributes to the stronger acidity and benefits the propane conversion as indicated by in situ C3H8-DRIFT, TPSR measurements, and kinetic experiments. This CoO@MFI-P50 obtains a promising propane conversion of 41.8% and propylene selectivity of 95% under industrially relevant conditions.
Recently, Xu et al. (98) reported that atomically dispersed Coδ+ species could be incorporated within the S-1 framework via a ligand-free hydrothermal process. The resulting Co@MFI catalysts possess good MFI crystallinity at Co contents up to 10 wt %, which is much higher than the catalysts from a ligand-assisted synthesis approach (Co content is 13 wt %). (20,21,96,97) The atomically dispersed Co species form a stable -Coδ+-Oδ structure, which withstands H2 reduction up to 750 C. The authors indicate that PDH performance largely depends on the oxidation state of the Coδ+ sites. Specifically, the P modification, reduction of reaction temperature, and cofeed of oxidants (H2O, CO2) would increase the δ value toward decreasing C-H activation capacity. Besides, the Co sites in impregnated catalysts exhibit a lower δ value under PDH conditions (close to zero), which promotes both C-H and C-C cleavages. The optimized 6 wt % Co@MFI catalyst achieved a stable PDH activity that lasted for a 150 h test under 550 C, with propane conversion being maintained at 16% and propylene selectivity at 96%.
3.2. BEA Zeolite-Based Catalysts
Similar to MFI materials, BEA topologic zeolites can also be synthesized under a wide range of SAR values, which are another typical support for PDH catalysts. De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of PtZn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods. Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction. Various Zn species (including Zn2+, Zn(OH)+, (Zn-O-Zn)2+, (Zn-(O-Zn)n)2+ and ZnO nanoparticles) may exist after the ion-exchange process, and the different Zn statuses largely depend on the zeolite topologies. In particular, the catalysts with Na-Beta support possess a smaller amount of isolated Zn2+ sites, which inhibits the aromatization side-reactions and coke deposits compared to other topological counterparts (MFI, MEL, LTL, and FAU). The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 C, undiluted propane). By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta). The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species (Figure 6a). Besides, the resulting Si-Beta zeolites are free of Bronsted acid sites, which suppress the side cracking reactions and reduce coke deposits. Chen et al. (103) first reported the use of Si-Beta zeolites supported ZnOx for the PDH reaction. Abundant silanol nests in Si-Beta contribute to the formation of small ZnO nanoparticles (3 nm), while the impregnated ZnOx on Al-Beta supports tends to form large ZnO nanoparticles (7 nm). The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%. Chens group further investigated V, Co, and PtSn species loaded on Si-Beta zeolites, (54,104,106) which also exhibit a higher metal dispersion and superior PDH performance than the counterparts with Al-Beta or Al2O3 supports. It is noted that an obvious induction period with the form of increased propane conversion was observed for the Co/Si-Beta system. (104) Such induction periods can be eliminated after H2 prereduction. The characterizations reveal that the highly dispersed CoOx clusters would be reduced to ultrasmall metallic Co clusters under reductive conditions (e.g., H2 treatment or PDH reaction), which account for the induction periods. The optimal 0.5Co/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits a propylene formation TOF of 32.9 h1, which is superior to the previous Co catalysts with SiO2, ZrSiO2, and Al2O3 supports (TOF values were 115 h1).

Yue et al. (107) synthesized the Sn/Si-Beta catalysts via a similar dealumination-impregnation procedure. The impregnated Sn species was incorporated within a Si-Beta framework, which acts as Lewis acid sites to catalyze CH cleavage in PDH. It was found that the dehydrogenation rate was dependent on the Lewis acidity, while the Bronsted acidity contributes to the cracking rate but is independent of the dehydrogenation rate. The Na+ doping treatment weakens the Bronsted acidity of Sn-Beta catalysts without affecting the Lewis acidity. As a result, the propane conversion over Na-Sn-Beta catalysts remains unchanged compared to Sn-Beta, while the propylene selectivity is greatly improved. Among the catalysts with various Sn loadings, the Sn-Beta-30 sample with a Si/Sn ratio of 30 exhibits a propane conversion of 40% with a propylene selectivity of 92% at 630 C. No obvious conversion loss was observed throughout the 72 h stability test (Figure 6b). The DFT calculations reveal, on a closed -Sn-(OSi)4 site, the direct PDH mechanism is energetically and kinetically more favorable than the indirect (stepwise) PDH mechanism. Moreover, the open (-Sn-(OH)n-(OSi)4-n) sites possess a smaller energy barrier in the first dehydrogenation (170189 kJ·mol1) step compared to closed -Sn-(OSi)4 sites with a barrier of 203 kJ·mol1, suggesting open sites with higher flexibility contribute to propane activation.
The above studies suggest that abundant vacant T-sites in Si-Beta zeolites contribute to the metal dispersion as reactive sites, which exhibits promising PDH performance. In addition to acting as reactive sites, the introduced heteroatom could also act as anchor sites for impregnated Pt species, resulting in a Pt-oxide interface or PtxMy alloy. This helps modify the geometric and electronic structure of Pt species, which potentially improves the PDH performance. Ma et al. (36) reported the synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolites through a secondary hydrothermal process using Si-Beta as the silica source and SnCl4 as the tin source. The resulting Sn-Beta zeolites possess abundant framework Sn species, which enables all impregnated Pt species to be encapsulated within the Si-Beta channels due to the strong PtSn interactions (Figure 6c). After impregnation, the resulting Pt-Sn-Beta-P sample possesses highly dispersed and homogeneous Pt species (particle size ranged from 0.2 to 1 nm) within zeolite channels (Figure 6d). In comparison, the Pt-Si-Beta-P sample with Si-Beta (without framework Sn species) support possesses large and heterogeneous Pt nanoparticles (320 nm) located both in zeolite channels and on external surface of zeolites. The detailed XAS characterizations confirm that the skeleton Sn species contribute to form the (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-O-[PtCl5] moiety, which is crucial for producing subnanometric Pt sites during impregnation. The influence of different calcination procedures was further investigated. The Pt species would agglomerate into PtSn nanoparticles in air calcination, and subsequent H2 reduction leads to the formation of PtxSny alloys. In comparison, the direct H2 reduction of Pt-Si-Beta-P leads to the formation of subnanometric Pt species within the Si-Beta channels in the form of (SiO)2Sn(II)-Ptn(1<n<15). The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C (Figure 6e). Qi et al. (37) reported that the impregnation of Zn species on Si-Beta results in Zn-OH nests, which could anchor the isolated Pt atoms. The HAADF-STEM images visualize the highly isolated Pt atoms in catalyst, and the distance between Pt atoms is much larger than that in PtZn alloys. In the meantime, the nonmutant in situ XAS spectra indicate that the Pt coordination environment stoichiometrically changed during thermal treatment. These two features confirm the existence of highly isolated Pt sites and exclude them from the formation of PtZn alloys. After treatment in He at 823 K, the Pt species would be reduced to a nearly zerovalent state, while Zn exists with an average valence state of +1. Further detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting data reveal each Pt atom coordinates with about 6 Zn atoms to form (-Si-O-Zn)46-Pt coordination, which effectively contributes to the Pt dispersion and stabilization toward near 100% propylene selectivity and catalytic stability throughout the 160 h PDH test.
3.3. Other Topologic Zeolite-Based Catalysts
Apart from MFI and BEA, other topological zeolites have relatively fewer applications in the PDH reaction. Liu et al. (27) reported the encapsulation of well-dispersed Pt sites within purely siliceous MCM-22 zeolites (MWW topology) during swelling of the layered MWW-structured ITQ-1 by an expanding surfactant. For the resulting Pt@MCM-22 catalyst, most of the Pt species exist as single atoms and 0.7 nm clusters encapsulated within the hemicages and supercages. After five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550 C, the Pt@MCM-22 sample retains about 90% of its initial activity, while the conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 sample exhibits more than 40% activity loss. Afterward, the encapsulated Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 would grow into 12 nm nanoparticles. Gong et al. (141) employed the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique to introduce well-defined Zn species onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites. The isolated ZnOH+ site was the predominant species on both ZSM-5 and Y zeolites after the first ALD cycle. The increased ALD cycles lead to the formation of ZnOx clusters on Y zeolite, while the ZnOH+ species could be retained on ZSM-5 zeolite because the diethyl zinc precursor cannot enter the ZSM-5 micropores after the first ALD cycle. The Zn deposition on Y zeolites completely eliminates the Bronsted acid sites and greatly increases the amount of strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites were removed after Zn deposition. Due to the decreased amount of ZnOH+ species, the ZnY catalysts exhibit lower propane conversion than Zn-ZSM-5, while the propylene selectivity is largely enhanced due to low Bronsted acidity.
Recently, Yuan et al. (108,109) investigated the Ga/In speciation on CHA zeolites and the structurefunction relationships in PDH. The combined DRIFT spectra and pulse titration experiments demonstrate that the Ga2O3/In2O3 species would displace the protos of Bronsted acid sites to form isolated extraframework Ga+/In+ sites upon H2 reduction. The in situ DRIFT spectra and DFT calculations indicate that the isolated Ga+ sites can form GaHx species at 150500 C upon H2 reduction, and the higher temperature of 550 C leads to GaHx decomposition. There is no InHx species in the In-CHA system upon H2 treatment. As a result, the isolated Ga+/In+ sites were deemed as the PDH active center. The DRIFT spectra and pulse titration experiments show that the water molecules could oxidize Ga+ but not In+, suggesting the Ga+ is more susceptible to oxidation. Accordingly, it was indicated the Ga+ sites can better stabilize the intermediates due to propane CH cleavage (Ga+  [HGa3+C3H7]+) and therefore leads to the 43 times reaction rate of Ga-CHA than In-CHA. (108)
Zhou et al. (55) reported that the SUZ-4 supported PtSnNa catalyst exhibits a PDH stability superior to that of the counterpart with ZSM-5 support. The authors developed a dibenzothiophene poisoning experiment to investigate the Pt distribution. Specifically, dibenzothiophene has a molecule diameter larger than the micropore sizes of these two zeolites, and thus the dibenzothiophene molecules can only poison the surface Pt, while the Pt sites inside the zeolite channels remained untouched. The dibenzothiophene poisoning experiment indicates that Pt species mainly disperse on the external surface of SUZ-4 support, while more Pt species locate within the pores of ZSM-5 support. Variation in Pt distributions results in different coke distributions. Coke species in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 primarily locate inside ZSM-5 channels and cover the Pt sites, while most of coke deposits in PtSnNa/SUZ-4 locate on the zeolite surface and therefore lead to superior stability. Zhang et al. (57) reported the passivation effect of the NaX zeolite framework on PDH performance over encapsulated Pt clusters. The hydrothermally synthesized Pt@NaX catalyst with encapsulated Pt clusters exhibits a propane consumption TOF of 0.41 s1, which is inferior to the impregnated Pt/NaX catalyst consisting of superficial Pt clusters (TOF = 4.15 s1). Besides, the zeolitic framework surrounding the encapsulated Pt species suppressed propylene desorption, which reduces propylene selectivity and increases coke deposits.
Apart from these silicate and aluminosilicate zeolites, there are also a few PDH systems based on silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. Fei et al. reported that PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield. (142) O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions. (56) Similar to the above-described PtSn/ZSM-5 systems (132,133) the role of Sn in PtSn/SAPO-34 was understood by modification of the Pt sites electronic density and transfer of coke deposits from Pt to support. (56) It should be noted that stable and abundant framework P atoms are one unique feature of such a class of silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. In this context, the highly dispersed and ultrastable metal phosphides may be constructed based on silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, which potentially improve the PDH performance, especially in propylene selectivity, compared to the metal/oxide sites. (143)
4. Metal-Hierarchical Zeolite Materials
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Hierarchical zeolite combines the intrinsic micropores of zeolites with an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network, which achieves enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores/macropores) without sacrificing the intrinsic confinement effect (micropores). (144) For the PDH reaction, the reported hierarchical molecular sieves include mesoporous zeolites prepared via desilication or self-assembly, the 2D/layered zeolites synthesized via bifunctional surfactants, and pillared zeolites synthesized using TPAOH and TBPOH as cotemplates (Figure 7ac).

Wang et al. (58) reported the construction of a hierarchical structure on commercial ZSM-5 zeolites through the desilication method. The alkali treatment with various NaOH concentrations produces mesoporous structures to varying degrees, which impacts the specific surface areas and pore volumes. Specifically, the ZSM-5 (1.0) sample (treating parent ZSM-5 with 1 M NaOH) possesses a surface area of 406 m2·g1 and pore volume of 0.41 cm3·g1, which are much larger than those of the parent ZSM-5 (257 m2·g1 and 0.15 cm3·g1 respectively). Under the same testing conditions, PtSn supported on hierarchical ZSM-5 exhibits an initial propane conversion of 50% and propylene selectivity of 95%, which are much higher than those of the counterpart with parent microporous ZSM-5 (30% propane conversion and 65% propylene selectivity). The self-assembly is another efficient strategy to build hierarchical zeolites, which can be achieved via enwrapping zeolite crystals with the OMS through stepwise synthesis. Li et al. (63) synthesized a series of TS-1@SBA-16 composites by adding as-synthesized TS-1 crystals to the synthesis precursor of SBA-16 materials. Compared to Pt-SnOx/TS-1, the hierarchical Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 possesses a higher surface area and weaker acidity, thus greatly improving the stability of the catalyst. Compared to Pt-SnOx/SBA-16, the introduction of 10% TS-1 not only enhances the concentration of acid sites but also strengthens the Pt-support interactions, which contributes to the stabilization of Pt0 and SnOx species toward superior PDH performance. The excessive TS-1 additions (20%) cause the destruction of the three-dimensional pore structure of SBA-16, which is unfavorable for PDH performance. The optimized Pt-SnOx/10%TS-1@SBA-15 catalyst exhibits an initial propane conversion of 54.5% and was still as high as 52.4% after four reaction-regeneration cycles.
Ryoo (38) developed [C18H37]-N+(Me)2-C6H12-N+(Me)2-C4H9]Br2 as a micro-/mesoporous dual-functional structure-directing agent, leading to the formation of hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolites. The post degallation (deGa) process produces purely siliceous hierarchical MFI zeolites with abundant silanol nests. The silanol nests allow the rare-earth elements (La, Ce, and Y) to exist as high-chemical potential single-atom species, which can diffuse onto Pt species to produce the Pt-rare earth intermetallic alloys during thermal treatment (Figure 7d). Note that the formation of Pt-rare earth alloys from conventional rare earth oxides is not feasible because they are hard to be reduced to a metallic state. The alloyed PtLa, PtCe, and PtY structures and the hierarchical pores effectively contribute to the PDH performance and stability. Under a high propane WHSV of 11 h1 (no diluted gas), the optimized Pt3La intermetallic alloys on hierarchical zeolites exhibit an initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion), and the conversion remains >8% after 30 days of reaction. In comparison, the propane conversion was 22% and soon dropped to below 5% within 1.5 h on the microporous MFI catalyst with the same Pt/La loadings (Figure 7e). This work highlights the effect of silanol nests on the formation of single atom rare-earth species, which is the key to producing Pt-rare earth alloys. However, this Pt-rare earth alloy synthesis procedure is cumbersome that requires multisteps (hydrothermal, demetalation, impregnation, calcination, and reduction) and the use of explosive HNO3 reagent. To address this issue, Ryoos group (60) developed the direct synthesis of hierarchical MFI zeolites with abundant silanol nests. Similarly, well-defined PtY alloys were formed on the directly synthesized hierarchical zeolites. For the direct synthesis process, the sodium-free condition is highly important for generating silanol nests, and the use of different templates could also affect the formation of silanol nests to some extent. The minor NaCl causes a substantially decreased silanol concentration. As a result, the silanol nests effectively promote the PtY alloying effect, which improves the catalyst lifetime from 1 day to 20 days.
It is noted that the PtY on hydrothermal-synthesized hierarchical zeolites show a superior catalytic lifetime than the counterparts with the above-mentioned deGa hierarchical supports, which can be attributed to the higher silanol concentration in former cases. (38,60) After optimizing the Pt and Y loadings, the PtY(1)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic stability with an initial propane conversion of 45% that lasted for 30 days. Pan et al. (146) reported the synthesis of hierarchical TS-1 zeolites assembled by ultrathin ( 3 nm) nanosheets using hexanediamine and [C18H37]-N+(Me)2-C6H12-N+(Me)2-C4H9]Br2 as cotemplates. The zeolitic nanosheets provide high external surface areas and abundant isolated silanol/titanol (Si-OH/Ti-OH) groups, which helps strengthen the Pt-support interactions to promote the Pt dispersion. Moreover, the TS-1 nanosheets are rich in external (isolated) Si-OH/Ti-OH groups instead of internal (confined) Si-OH/Ti-OH species in conventional bulk zeolites, which contributes to weaker acidity. Besides, it was also found that the Pt dispersion on the hierarchical TS-1 support depended on synthesis methods, which follow the sequence of electrostatic adsorption method > solvent evaporation method  incipient wetness impregnation. (146)
Similar to the ligand-assisted synthesis of metal-containing bulk zeolites, the addition of metal precursor in the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites also produces encapsulated metal species. Recently, Ji et al. (62) reported the incorporation of Fe species within S-1 framework can lead to a hierarchical-like morphology for the Fe-S-1 catalyst. The time-resolved 2,3-dimethylpyridine (DMPyr)-DRIFT experiments indicate a faster diffusion efficiency on hierarchical-like catalysts than bulk counterparts. The Si-OH-Fe hydroxyl groups help produce isolated Pt sites as evidenced by AC-HAADF-STEM images and XAFS and CO-DRIFT measurements. DFT calculations reveal the isolated Pt sites in the SiOPtOFe moiety show a lower propylene desorption energy compared to the Pt 111 slab. Moreover, the former case also exhibits a higher barrier for propylene overdehydrogenation. The faster propylene desorption and limited overdehydrogenation help achieve high propylene selectivity and catalytic lifetime. The optimized Pt/Fe-3 catalyst obtains a propane conversion of 39.2% and a propylene selectivity of 96.2% with using undiluted propane reactants and a high propane WSHV of 17 h1, and no obvious deactivation was detected after 3 days reaction. Zhang et al. (61) designed a novel fin zeolite by using TPAOH and 1,8-diaminooctane as dual-templates. The 3060 nm finned S-1 crystals epitaxially grew on the surface of bulk S-1 seeds, and PtZn clusters were encapsulated in the S-1 fins with the assistance of ethylenediamine. In particular, the authors reveal that the propane diffusion rate in the PtZn@S-1-Fin catalyst (fin size is 3060 nm) is 1.4- and 1.7-fold higher than that in PtZn@S-1-200 (200 means crystal size of 200 nm) and PtZn@S-1-400 based on the intelligent gravimetric analyzer. Therefore, it was concluded that finned zeolites combine the advantages of short diffusion length, high crystallinity, and high surface permeability. The optimized PtZn@S-1-Fin catalyst exhibits a propylene productivity of 15 molC3H6·molPt1·s1 at a high propane WHSV of 180 h1, which is superior to the reference catalysts with propylene productivity of 912 molC3H6·molPt1·s1. Choi et al. (111) synthesized the hierarchical gallosilicate MFI zeolites via a one-pot hydrothermal method using 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) and TPAOH as mesoporous and microporous templates, respectively. The MPS additions improve the total surface area and mesoporous pore volumes while not significantly altering the micropore volumes. The hierarchical Ga-MFI catalysts possess lower concentrations of Bronsted acid sites and more Lewis acid sites, with significant concentrations of strong Lewis acid sites. The catalyst with more MPS additions possesses stronger Lewis acid sites and smaller Bronsted acid/Lewis acid ratios, leading to an improved PDH performance. The same group (39) further reported the encapsulation of well-defined Pt1Zn1 and Pt3Ga1 alloys within hierarchical MFI zeolites through a one-step hydrothermal process using [C18H37]-N+(Me)2-C6H12-N+(Me)2-C4H9]Br2 as a template. The as-obtained catalyst contains a layered nanosheet structure, leading to a large external surface area with an increased number of isolated silanols. This helps improve the reducibility of Zn and Ga oxide species to facilitate the formation of intermetallic compound-type alloys. With the same Pt and Zn/Ga loadings, the hierarchical catalysts exhibit superior PDH activity especially for catalytic stability compared to the counterparts with microporous MFI zeolites and mesoporous γ-Al2O3, MCM-48, and silica supports.
The hierarchical S-1 zeolites with a pillared structure could be synthesized using TBPOH and TPAOH as dual templates. (59) The hierarchical S-1 zeolites possess higher surface silanols compared to their bulk counterparts, which effectively enhances the metalsupport interactions. This contributes to the higher dispersion and electron density over Pt sites, leading to an enhanced PDH performance. Specifically, the Pt/hierarchical S-1 catalyst exhibits a higher Pt-related TOF of 1112.2 h1 than the catalyst with bulk S-1 supports (TOF is 157.6 h1). Qin et al. (147) compared the effect of different synthesis procedures (top-down and bottom-up) on the physicochemical properties of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites. The hydrothermally synthesized ZNS (using C22H45-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N+(CH3)2-C6H13 as templates) possess relatively larger mesoporous (external) surface area and pore volume but smaller microporous surface area and pore volume. In comparison, the NH4F or NaOH etching of bulk ZSM-5 crystals also produces mesopores with a sacrificing part of the micropores. Notably, the NH4+ species could preferentially extract the misoriented nanocrystalline domains followed by the uniform dissolution of the remaining part of the zeolite crystals, while conventional NaOH etching did not exhibit such a preferential property. The NH4F-treated zeolites possess a house-of-cards-like morphology containing large rectangular cavities surrounded by thin (1530 nm), flat, and highly crystalline walls. Meanwhile, NH4F treatment did not alter characteristic features including SAR, Bronsted/Lewis acidity, and high crystallinity compared to parent bulk zeolite. This contributes to the improvement of mesoporous (external) surface area and the accessibility of metal sites within zeolite. Kim et al. (110) reported the synthesis of hierarchical S-1 zeolites via a hydrothermal bottom-up procedure. Specifically, the tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) template leads to the formation of self-pillared pentasil (SPP) S-1 zeolites, and the long-chain diquaternary ammonium C22-N+-C6-N+-C6Br2 results in the layered S-1 zeolites. The SPP S-1 and layered S-1 zeolites were formed by repetitive crystal twinning and exhibit a stacked nanosheet morphology with a hierarchical structure. The SPP Ga-MFI and layered Ga-MFI catalysts exhibit larger surface area, mesoporous volume, and stronger acidity compared to conventional bulk Ga-MFI catalyst. The diffusion limitations were ruled out based on the Weisz-Prater criterion. The activity evaluation shows that propane conversion, Ga-related TOF, and propylene selectivity over hierarchical catalysts (SPP Ga-MFI and layered Ga-MFI) are respectively increased by 100500%, 180500%, and 10100% compared to bulk Ga-MFI catalyst. The superior activity on SPP and layered Ga-MFI was due to their quasi-2D morphology, which achieves a closer distance between Lewis acid sites and Bronsted acid sites than the 3D distributed active sites in the bulk zeolites, thus effectively promoting the Lewis-Bronsted synergistic PDH toward more efficient propane activation. The addition of MPS in the synthesis precursor of hierarchical catalysts further improves the PDH activity, but this improvement was not related to the catalysts acidity instead of porous and acid structures.
5. Summary and Perspectives
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In summary, the large surface area and ordered porous structure of molecular sieve materials provide grand opportunities to optimize the amount and coordination environment of reactive sites, which have attracted growing attention in PDH. This review focuses on the synthesis and structureactivity relationships of metal-molecular sieve PDH materials. Future perspectives remain:
5.1. Alternative Efficient Catalysts Based on Hierarchical Zeolite Support
Encapsulating of a subnanometric or single-site active center within zeolites is one of the hottest topics in the PDH area because the strong confinement effect prevents metal/oxide species from sintering and leaching. (17,20,21,23,24,37,62,84,103,107) On the other hand, the subnanometric pores of zeolites may cause diffusion limitations especially for the cases with a large granular size and small pore size (8-ring, comparable or smaller than the propane molecular size of 0.47 nm (86)). (148,149) In this context, although several FAU and CHA topologic zeolite-based materials were developed for the PDH reaction, (57,108,109) the diffusion limitations and their effect on activity/selectivity should be carefully checked. The diffusion limitations could be evaluated via the Weisz-Parter criterion, intelligent gravimetric analyzer, probe-DRIFT spectra, etc. (61,62,93) The high temperature of the PDH reaction makes the quantitative determination of the diffusion coefficient under reaction conditions difficult. One recent study employs theoretical force-field molecular dynamics (FFMD) simulations to indicate the propane molecules have no obvious diffusion limitations in typical MFI (S-1) and BEA (Si-Beta) topological zeolites. (150) In contrast, the diffusion of C4 molecules (isobutane and isobutene) inside the S-1 framework exhibits certain constraints. Moreover, DFT calculations also reveal that the CH cleavage in isobutane requires a higher barrier than that in propane due to the steric effect of the iso-C4H9* intermediates.
The hierarchical zeolites combine the advantages of fast diffusion of mesopores and the confinement of micropores, which provides a viable pathway to construct efficient PDH catalysts. As summarized in Figure 2 and Table 1, researchers have developed a set of promising Pt-hierarchical zeolite catalysts which obtain impressive propylene selectivity and catalytic lifetime at thermodynamic conversion. (38,39,6062) In the past decade, there is a significant progress of the Pt-free catalysts in PDH performance. Both industrially relevant propylene productivity and selectivity can be obtained using several promising Co/Zn-based molecular sieve systems, (9193,99,150) while the typical lifetime of these systems is still inferior to Pt-based systems, especially the Pt-hierarchical zeolite catalysts. In this regard, further developments in performance can be expected via the construction of alternative Co/Zn-based hierarchical zeolites.
5.2. The Identification of Actual Reactive Site and PDH Mechanism
Compared to the superficial active sites on metal-oxide supports, the visualization and characterization of the active site microstructure within a molecular sieve matrix are more challenging. Moreover, the dynamic evolution of active sites during pretreatment or the PDH reaction has been reported in several metal-molecular sieve systems, (25,35,84,88,91,93,95,97,104,108) which further brings difficulty to identify the actual reactive site and PDH mechanism. Revealing the actual active site locations, the metal/oxide-molecular sieve interfaces, and the reaction mechanisms under reaction conditions requires advanced characterizations including iDPC-STEM images, in situ spectroscopy with well-designed atmosphere, and two-dimensional soild-state NMR microscopy. (23,25,35,91,93,97,151) In addition to experimental efforts, DFT calculation is another powerful technique for identifying the active site evolution and reaction network. In particular, the ab initio metadynamics simulations can screen the potential reactions between active center and given reactants, which is different from the conventional transition state calculations that typically predefined a reaction pathway. (152,153) Therefore, it is expected that the advanced metadynamics simulations may help explore the potential active centers and the reaction mechanisms.
For the aluminosilicate zeolites, the framework Al species produce Bronsted acid sites. The Bronsted acid sites were generally considered as undesired species since they catalyze overdehydrogenation of propylene products toward decreased propylene selectivity, (107) while several studies also report the promotional effect Bronsted acidity in terms of the enhanced propane adsorption/activation and metalsupport interactions. (52,85,86) Notably, the Lewis-Bronsted synergetic effect was widely identified in Ga-ZSM-5 systems, (88,135137) where the Bronsted protons could facilitate the formation of more reactive [GaH]2+ sites and the H2 elimination. (135) In short, the complete functions of surface acid sites should be carefully explored in Al-containing systems, not limited to the negative effect as undesired sites for CC cracking. (7)
5.3. Industrial Application
Although great progress in activity has been achieved in metal/oxide-molecular sieve catalysts, the regeneration capacity of catalysts still remains a challenge for industrial application. In the air calcinated regeneration procedure, the reactions between O2 and coke (CxHy species) would inevitably produce steam which may induce sintering, leaching, and restructuring of active sites. For Al-containing molecular sieve materials, the hydrolysis of framework Al species was also essential in evaluating the catalysts regeneration stability. (154) The irreversible or faster deactivation after a few regeneration cycles has been reported for several molecular sieve systems, which is because of the aggregation and loss of active sites. (17,23,90,92,105) Reducing the zeolite crystal size is a promising pathway to improve regeneration (hydrothermal) stability. (154) Besides, the introduction of alkali metal ions to form multimetal/oxide active sites is another viable pathway to improve the regeneration capacity, as validated in MgO-ZnOx/S-1 and PtZn4@S-1-Cs systems. (23,92)
Apart from acting as supports, the MFI and CHA topologic zeolites were reported to show H2-permeable capacity at the PDH reaction window. The selective removal of H2 products potentially improves the propylene yield from the reaction engineering aspect. (155157) For example, Kim et al. designed hybrid Pt-MFI zeolite membrane catalysts, which achieve the high-temperature PDH reaction along with H2 removal. The permeation experiments indicate the H2/C3H8 separation factor increases with higher temperature and reaches >3 at 600 C. (155) On the other hand, the undesired cracking and coke reactions would be also accelerated under the H2-deficient atmosphere. (158) In this context, integrating a H2-permeable membrane and appropriate active species is promising for improving the propylene yield in industrial applications. Potential active species for this technology are Pt and Co, which show higher propylene selectivity and anticoking capacity compared to other elements as summarized in Tables 12. Moreover, future H2-permeable membrane PDH technology should carefully optimize the H2-permeable levels, which not only assess the thermodynamic advantages due to H2 removal but also consider the cracking and coking reactions in H2 deficient conditions. (158)
In addition to activity, the cost and toxicity of catalysts were also crucial for industrial applications. Thus, the development of green and low-cost methods for the synthesis of efficient molecular sieve-based catalysts is always an endless story. The solvent-free and template/ligand-free strategies are promising for potential large-scale production. (159,160) The calcination atmosphere is another important factor to affect the microstructure of active sites. (23,76,96,123) Considering the catalysts typically require H2 prereduction prior to PDH reaction, the H2 direct reduction strategy is a promising process compared to conventional air calcination in terms of cost (energy) savings, as well as improving metal dispersion. (23,76,96)
