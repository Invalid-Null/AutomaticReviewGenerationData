 <quotes>

[1] The promising Pt-hierarchical zeolite catalysts typically show propylene productivity of 4-6 kgC3H6·kgcat-1·h-1 at a deactivation rate of 0.02 h-1, which are superior to those on OMS, zeolite, and metal-oxide supports. Several promising Pt-hierarchical zeolite materials exhibit outstanding catalytic lifetimes that lasted longer than 300 h under industrially relevant conditions.

[2] As for Pt-free catalysts, the promising Co and Zn-containing molecular sieve catalysts exhibit propylene productivity of 0.5-2 kgC3H6·kgcat-1·h-1 at a deactivation rate of <0.2 h-1, which exhibits certain superiority compared to the counterparts on metal-oxide supports and the represented bulk ZrO2.
