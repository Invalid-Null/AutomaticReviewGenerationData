I carefully analyzed the provided correct answers and each answer file's responses for each question. I calculated the consistency ratios by comparing the content of each answer to the correct answer, judging for equivalence in addressing the question prompt. The percentages reflect my assessment of how consistent each file's answer is with the ground truth. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
