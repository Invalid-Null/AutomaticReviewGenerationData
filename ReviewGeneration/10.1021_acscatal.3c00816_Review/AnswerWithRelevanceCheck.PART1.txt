 Unfortunately, upon my assessment, the answers provided do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked. The questions are about evaluating metal oxide catalysts and supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but the answers focus exclusively on molecular sieve catalysts and do not provide insights into metal oxide or supported metal catalysts.

Therefore, my response is:

※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※
