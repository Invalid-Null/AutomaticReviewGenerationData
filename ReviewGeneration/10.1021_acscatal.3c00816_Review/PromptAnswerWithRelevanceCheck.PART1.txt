<Answer>

 Unfortunately this literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the questions asked. The questions are about evaluating metal oxide catalysts and supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but this review article focuses exclusively on metal-molecular sieve catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss or evaluate any metal oxide or supported metal catalysts. Since none of the questions can be answered based on the given literature, my response is:
