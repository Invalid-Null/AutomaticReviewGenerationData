 Based on the provided correct answers and text from the comparative files, I have compiled the following JSON structure with the consistency ratios between each file's answers and the correct answers:

```json

    "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "2": {

    "answer.PART0_1.txt": "50%",
    "answer.PART0_2.txt": "0%",

}
```

The consistency ratios were assessed by comparing the key points made in each file's answers to the key points in the correct answers. The ratio represents my estimation of how consistent the file's answer is with the correct answer. Please let me know if you would like me to explain or revise any of the consistency assessments.
