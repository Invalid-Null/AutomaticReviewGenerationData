         [1] Propylene is the important raw material for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, propylene oxide, etc.
         [2] According to a report from IHS Markit Ltd. and Dow Chemical Inc., the global propylene supply demand market renders a big gap since 2015, and the propylene demand would keep growing at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% up to 2030.
         [3] Conventional propylene production mainly comes from fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil. Due to the rapid consumption of crude oil, these traditional propylene production technologies cannot satisfy current and future demands well.

         The article provides background that propylene is an important raw material for producing chemicals like acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, and propylene oxide. There is a large and growing gap between propylene supply and demand that conventional production methods from naphtha and heavy oil cracking cannot meet due to crude oil consumption.

         [1] In this review, we describe the progress in the synthesis and PDH performance of metal-molecular sieve catalysts, including metal-mesoporous silica, metal-zeolite, and metal-hierarchical zeolite catalysts. 
         [2] The strategies in identifying and regulating active site microstructure and metal-molecular sieve interactions as well as their correlations with active site structure and PDH mechanism are introduced simultaneously.
         [3] This review is expected to provide some guidance for future catalyst design based on utilizing the molecular sieves structural confinement to facilitate propane activation and active site stabilization.
         [4] PDH is acknowledged as a structure-insensitive reaction where the CH bond cleavage can occur on every metal or metaloxygen site.

         [1] X represents the Conv/Conveq wherein Conveq is the equilibrium conversion (calculated by Aspen Plus) under corresponding conditions.
         [2] Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive technology for propylene production that has received extensive attention. Molecular sieve supports possess a larger specific surface area and well-defined pores/cavities, which have been proven to possess stronger capability to prevent subnanometric metal species from sintering.

         [1] DFT calculations further reveal that the Zn-O-Zn site possesses a lower apparent activation barrier (1.81 eV) than the single site Zn2+ (2.14 eV), which explains well the experimental observations. 
         [2] Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the electronic enriched Pt has a more negative d-band center, while the d-band center values negatively correlate with propylene selectivity for PtM@Pt models.
