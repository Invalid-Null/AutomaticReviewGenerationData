<quotes>
[1] "The high cost of Pt and environmental issues of CrOx drive researchers to explore efficient nonprecious and nontoxic alternatives."

[2] "In this context, a review about the synthesis and structure-function relationships of these molecular sieve-supported materials for PDH reaction is necessary and informative."

[3] "Therefore, the development of highly efficient propylene production technologies is of vital importance."

[4] "In particular, the ab initio metadynamics simulations can screen the potential reactions between active center and given reactants, which is different from the conventional transition state calculations that typically predefined a reaction pathway."
