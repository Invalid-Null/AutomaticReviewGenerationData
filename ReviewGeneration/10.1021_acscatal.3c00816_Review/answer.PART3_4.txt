[1] The catalysts with Na-Beta support possess a smaller amount of isolated Zn2+ sites, which inhibits the aromatization side-reactions and coke deposits compared to other topological counterparts (MFI, MEL, LTL, and FAU).

[2] The ethylenediamine-assisted hydrothermal method. For example, Xie et al. (25) employed ethylenediamine as a ligand to encapsulate isolated Zn2+ cations within the S-1 zeolites. The isolated Zn2+ species were trapped in the SiOH groups.

[3] Liu et al. (24) encapsulated K-PtSn species (single atom and clusters) within S-1 zeolites through a similar one-pot hydrothermal process with ethylenediamine as the ligands. 

[4] Yu et al. (22) developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy based on the combination of precursor age, seed additives, and fast-heating tubular reactor. The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits initial propane conversion of 65%, which is much higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5.

[5] The encapsulation of metal sites within zeolites along with their crystallization (i.e., direct synthesis procedure) is promising to avoid the superficial metal species in postsynthesis procedure.

[6] Yuan et al. (108,109) investigated the Ga/In speciation on CHA zeolites and the structure–function relationships in PDH. The combined DRIFT spectra and pulse titration experiments demonstrate that the Ga2O3/In2O3 species would displace the protons of Bronsted acid sites to form isolated extraframework Ga+/In+ sites upon H2 reduction.

1. Yes, the article discusses techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It provides examples like the ethylenediamine-assisted hydrothermal method to encapsulate isolated Zn2+ cations within S-1 zeolites (Quote [2]). It also discusses encapsulating isolated K-PtSn species within S-1 zeolites using ethylenediamine ligands (Quote [3]).

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. For example, it discusses Yu et al.'s work on an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy to fully encapsulate PtSn clusters within ZSM-5, leading to much higher initial propane conversion compared to impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 (Quote [4]). It also notes that encapsulating metal sites along with zeolite crystallization avoids superficial metal species compared to postsynthesis methods (Quote [5]).

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Examples include the direct synthesis procedure to encapsulate metal sites within zeolites along with crystallization, avoiding superficial metal species (Quote [5]). It also discusses ligand-assisted synthesis strategies using ethylenediamine to disperse isolated metal cations within zeolites (Quotes [2],[3]).

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ DRIFT spectroscopy and pulse titration experiments to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. For example, it reveals how Ga2O3/In2O3 species displace Bronsted acid site protons to form isolated Ga+/In+ sites upon H2 reduction during PDH over CHA zeolites (Quote [6]).

5. No, the article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

6. No, the article does not use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. 

7. No, the article does not evaluate different types for propane dehydrogenation.
