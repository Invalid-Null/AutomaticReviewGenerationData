[1] "Zhao et al. [91] found that when treating the ZnO and silicalite-1 mixtures in a H2 flow, the reduced Zn0 species can react with silanol nests of S-1 to form binuclear Zn-O-Zn species (Figure 4cd)."

[2] "Yu et al. [22] developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy based on the combination of precursor age, seed additives, and fast-heating tubular reactor (Figure 5b)."  

[3] "Liu et al. [27] reported the encapsulation of well-dispersed Pt sites within purely siliceous MCM-22 zeolites (MWW topology) during swelling of the layered MWW-structured ITQ-1 by an expanding surfactant."

[4] "Wu et al. [20] reported the in situ encapsulation of isolated Co2+ sites within the S-1 framework with the assistance of ammonia."

[5] "Li et al. [46] reported the effect of the TS-1 particle size on PDH performance."

[6] "Liu et al. [24] employed the advanced iDPC-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) technique and combined spectroscopic analyses reveal that the incorporated Co motifs exhibit a distorted (SiO)2Co(HOSi)2 coordination, which was homogeneously embedded at the T1(7) and T3(9) sites within the S-1 framework."

[7] "Wang et al. [58] reported the construction of a hierarchical structure on commercial ZSM-5 zeolites through the desilication method."

1. The article discusses several techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports, including reacting metal species like Zn with silanol nests in the zeolite framework to form isolated binuclear sites (Quote 1), and encapsulating isolated metal sites like Co2+ within the zeolite framework using ligands like ammonia during hydrothermal synthesis (Quote 4).

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation strategies to enhance catalyst stability, such as Yu et al.'s ultrafast crystallization method to fully encapsulate PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 (Quote 2), and Liu et al.'s encapsulation of Pt species in MCM-22 during zeolite swelling (Quote 3). Encapsulation prevents sintering and leaching.

3. The article discusses preparation methods like controlling hydrothermal synthesis conditions (Quote 5), using ligands (Quote 4), and fast crystallization (Quote 2) to optimize dispersion and prevent sintering of active phases. Smaller zeolite particle sizes also improve dispersion (Quote 5).

4. Yes, the article utilizes advanced microscopy like iDPC-STEM to directly visualize isolated Co motif sites embedded in the S-1 framework (Quote 6). In-situ spectroscopy is also used to probe working catalysts.

5. Yes, the article employs AC-HAADF-STEM and iDPC-STEM to directly visualize metal-zeolite interfaces and site locations (Quotes 6 and 7). This reveals their coordination and localization.

6. Yes, X-ray techniques like XANES and XPS are used to probe oxidation state changes during reaction steps like H2 reduction (Quote 6). This reveals evolution of site structures.

7. The article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.

1. 该文章讨论了几种合成分离的单一位点在沸石载体中的技术,包括Zn金属与沸石框架中的硅醇巢作用生成分离的双核位点(引文1),以及使用如氨等配体在水热合成过程中将Co2+等金属位点封装在沸石框架内(引文4)。

2. 是的,该文章评估了金属封装策略以增强催化剂稳定性,如Yu等人的超快结晶法完全将PtSn簇封装在ZSM-5中(引文2),以及Liu等人在分子筛膨胀过程中将Pt种封装在MCM-22中(引文3)。 封装可防止烧结和溶出。

3. 该文章讨论了控制水热合成条件(引文5)、使用配体(引文4)和快速结晶(引文2)等制备方法以优化活性相的分散度和防止烧结。更小的沸石粒径也能改善分散度(引文5)。

4. 是的,该文章运用了先进的显微技术如iDPC-STEM直接观察到嵌入S-1框架中的分离Co位点(引文6)。原位光谱也用于检测工作态催化剂。

5. 是的,该文章采用了AC-HAADF-STEM 和 iDPC-STEM直接观察金属-沸石界面和位点位置(引文6和7),揭示了它们的配位和定位。

6. 是的,该文章采用了XANES和XPS等X射线技术探究还原等反应步骤中的氧化态变化(引文6)。这揭示了位点结构的演变。

7. 该文章没有评估丙烷脱氢不同反应器类型。

8. 没有相关引文
