 Here are the relevant quotes and answers:

<quotes>

[1] Propylene is the important raw material for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, propylene oxide, etc.

[2] According to a report from IHS Markit Ltd. and Dow Chemical Inc., the global propylene supply demand market renders a big gap since 2015, and the propylene demand would keep growing at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% up to 2030.

[3] Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive technology for propylene production that has received extensive attention.

[4] PDH is acknowledged as a structure-insensitive reaction where the CH bond cleavage can occur on every metal or metaloxygen site.

[5] The harsh PDH conditions (i.e., high temperature, strongly reductive atmosphere, and frequent regeneration) easily cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and structural reconstruction. 

[6] The stabilization of subnanometric active sites requires large surface area support with a strong metalsupport interaction, which cannot be fully satisfied by conventional Al2O3 support.

[7] Molecular sieves with uniform porous structure, high thermal stability, and unique confinement capability have been proven to be ideal supports for well-dispersed active sites to generate efficient PDH performance.
