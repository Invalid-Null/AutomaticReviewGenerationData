[1] Propylene is the important raw material for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, propylene oxide, etc.

[2] According to a report from IHS Markit Ltd. and Dow Chemical Inc., the global propylene supply demand market renders a big gap since 2015, and the propylene demand would keep growing at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% up to 2030.

[3] Conventional propylene production mainly comes from fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil. Due to the rapid consumption of crude oil, these traditional propylene production technologies cannot satisfy current and future demands well.

1. The article provides background that propylene is an important raw material for producing chemicals like acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, and propylene oxide. It states there is a large gap between propylene supply and demand that is projected to continue growing 2-3% annually through 2030. It notes conventional production from naphtha and heavy oil cracking cannot meet current and future demand due to crude oil consumption.

[1] Molecular sieves with uniform porous structure, high thermal stability, and unique confinement capability have been proven to be ideal supports for well-dispersed active sites to generate efficient PDH performance. 

[2] Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts [are used in industry]. 

[3] The high cost of Pt and environmental issues of CrOx drive researchers to explore efficient nonprecious and nontoxic alternatives.

[4] Ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) and hierarchical zeolites are also typical molecular sieves [in addition to conventional zeolites].

3. The article introduces molecular sieves, Pt-based catalysts, CrOx-based catalysts, ordered mesoporous silica, and hierarchical zeolites as major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation. It states molecular sieves provide uniform pores to disperse active sites and their thermal stability and confinement effects improve PDH performance. Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts are used industrially, but researchers aim to find non-precious and non-toxic alternatives due to cost and environmental issues.

[1] Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the electronic enriched Pt has a more negative d-band center, while the d-band center values negatively correlate with propylene selectivity for PtM@Pt models.

[2] DFT calculations further reveal that the Zn-O-Zn site possesses a lower apparent activation barrier (1.81 eV) than the single site Zn2+ (2.14 eV), which explains well the experimental observations.
