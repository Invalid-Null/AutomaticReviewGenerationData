To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key semantic content between each answer file's response and the reference correct answer for each question. The ratios are expressed as percentages, with 100% meaning completely consistent and 0% meaning completely inconsistent.

The answers across most files showed strong consistency with the reference answers. The only exceptions were Questions 3 and 4 for answer.PART1_3.txt, which provided substantially different responses compared to the other files and correct answers. All other questions and files demonstrated semantic equivalence in their answers.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
