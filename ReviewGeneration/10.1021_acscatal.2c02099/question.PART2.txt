CO2-Assisted Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane over VOx/In2O3 Catalysts: Interplay between Redox Property and AcidBase Interactions
Abstract
In this work, a series of VOx-loaded In2O3 catalysts were prepared, and their catalytic performance was evaluated for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) and compared with In2O3 alone. The optimal composition is obtained on 3.4V/In2O3 (surface V density of 3.4V nm2), which exhibited not only a higher C3H6 selectivity than other V/In catalysts and In2O3 under isoconversion conditions but also an improved reaction stability. To elucidate the catalyst structureactivity relationship, the VOx/In2O3 catalysts were characterized by chemisorption [NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), NH3-diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), CO2-TPD, and CO2-DRIFTS], H2-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), in situ Raman spectroscopy, UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and further examined using density functional theory. The InOV structure and the extent of oligomerization, which play a crucial role in improving selectivity and stability, were identified in the VOx/In2O3 catalysts. In particular, the presence of surface VOx (i) inhibits the deep reduction of In2O3, thereby preserving the activity, (ii) neutralizes the excess basicity on In2O3, thus suppressing propane dry reforming and achieving a higher propylene selectivity, and (iii) introduces additional redox sites that participate in the dehydrogenation reaction by utilizing CO2 as a soft oxidant. The present work provides insights into developing selective, stable, and robust metal-oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP by controlling the conversion of reagents via desired pathways through the interplay between acidbase interactions and redox properties.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Light alkenes such as propylene (C3H6) are important building blocks for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. (1) Conventionally, C3H6 is produced as a byproduct in producing ethylene by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts. (2) Nowadays, there is a discrepancy between the market demand and productivity. (3) To make-up the shortfall of C3H6 supply, the on-purpose C3H6 production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have been implemented. (2,4,5) However, DHP suffers from intrinsic drawbacks such as thermodynamic restraints which require high reaction temperatures that inevitably result in severe coking and undesired thermal cracking. (6) Moreover, the indispensable addition of extra hydrogen in the feed gas and its regeneration make the process both energy and capital intensive. (710)
Due to its exothermicity and limited thermodynamic restraint, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) provides alternatives to complement the DHP route. (11) Presently, oxygen (O2) has been majorly used as the oxidant for ODHP, and higher C3H6 and light alkene (C2C3) selectivities can be achieved. Representative catalysts include hexagonal boron nitride and boron oxide catalysts through the Eley-Rideal (ER) mechanism (1218) and redox-active vanadium oxide-based catalysts via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism (MvK). (1) Over-oxidation to undesired carbon oxides (COx) is the major challenge with O2 as the oxidant, which reduces the selectivity toward alkenes. (1,19) Furthermore, concerns of process flammability due to the presence of O2 also exist. (11,20) To tackle these issues, introducing a soft oxidant such as carbon dioxide (CO2) provides a potential avenue and has been applied in the coupling of methane, (21) dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, (22) propane, (11,23) and iso-butane. (24) The positive roles of CO2 in the overall ODHP reaction include serving as (i) a diluent to enhance the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes and (ii) an agent to remove coke via the reverse Boudouard reaction. (25) Moreover, CO2 can help keep the metal components at a higher oxidation state during CO2-ODHP, such as inhibiting the formation of metallic iron and iron carbide with better activity toward isobutane dehydrogenation. (26) Combining CO2 with the ODHP reaction can also potentially allow for the utilization of the carbon source from CO2 via a hydrogen-free manner. (11)
In addition to ODHP, side reactions include reverse water gas shift (RWGS) and propane dry reforming (PDR) (see reactions below). (11,23,27) There are two proposed reaction cycles. The first scenario proposes that CO2-ODHP is a net reaction of DHP and RWGS, wherein RWGS can help remove the formed H2 to form CO and H2O, therefore boosting the DHP reaction by shifting the reaction equilibrium to the side of forming propylene. (11,28) Alternatively, the reaction can proceed through a one-cycle reaction, in which CO2 closes the cycle to produce CO without undergoing a separate RWGS route after the surface undergoes direct propane dehydrogenation. (29) PDR is endothermic, which could result in the increase in CO while a decrease in C3H6 selectivity at high temperatures. Therefore, designing catalysts that can selectively break the CH bond to produce alkenes while suppressing PDR is of great interest. Similar to the O2-ODHP route, redox-active metal oxides (Cr and V) are promising candidates for CO2-ODHP. (1,11,30) However, due to the toxic and carcinogenic properties of Cr(VI) oxides, it is vital to find alternatives. (30) Group IIIA mixed oxides such as Ga2O3Al2O3 (31,32) and In2O3Al2O3 (33) and supported In2O3 catalyst (25,34) show comparable catalytic performance as well. On Ga2O3, ODHP is proposed to proceed via the heterolytic propane dissociation on acidbase pairs, namely, Gaδ+O2 pairs. (28) Specifically, C3H7+ is adsorbed on O2 (basic sites), while H is adsorbed on Gaδ+ (acid sites). (28) The presence of CO2 aids in facilitating the removal of dissociatively adsorbed H2 on acidbase pairs of GaO and recovering the active sites for the subsequent CH activation for propylene formation. (28)
Our interest lies in the In2O3-based catalysts because of their comparable C3H6 selectivity to Ga2O3 under isoconversional conditions (11) and well-known capability in activating CO2 molecules, such as CO2 hydrogenation. (3538) However, the mechanism on In2O3 for ODHP is still elusive. CO2 is a more acidic gas than propane, which might negatively impact the CH activation of C3H8 during ODHP. (28) Thus, due to the strong basicity of In2O3, (3538) it might selectively activate CO2 instead of C3H8 during ODHP. Thus, the unbalanced acidbase properties of In2O3 is a major challenge for ODHP. (11) In the present work, we propose to incorporate an acidic metal oxide VOx onto the basic In2O3 to (i) neutralize the excess basic sites (oxygen vacancies and lattice oxygen) with controlled capability of CO2 activation and to (ii) improve the reaction stability through the intimate interaction between In2O3 and redox-active VOx. Thus, we aim at clarifying the interplay between redox property and acidbase interactions and their relationship with the activity performance and stability in CO2-ODHP. For these purposes, we prepared a series of VOx-loaded In2O3 catalysts with various surface V densities and evaluated their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP. To reveal the catalyst compositionstructureactivity relationship, a wide array of the characterization techniques has been applied, including chemisorption, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UVvis DRS), and Raman spectroscopy. Density functional theory (DFT) was also used to study the effect of surface VOx on the formation of oxygen vacancies of In2O3.

2.1. Catalyst Preparation
In2O3 (surface area, 70 m2 g1) was prepared by the calcination of In(OH)3, as reported elsewhere. (35) A brief description is provided in the Supporting Information. The crystalline V2O5 was prepared by calcining the precursor NH4VO3 at 550 C. The structure of V2O5 was characterized by Raman spectroscopy, and the resultant spectrum is shown in Figure S1.
V-loaded In2O3 catalysts were prepared by impregnation in an aqueous solution of NH4VO3 (99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) at 80 C for 4 h with vigorous stirring. The impregnated sample was dried at 100 C overnight and calcined in air at 550 C for 3 h at a ramp rate of 5 C min1. V surface density is used throughout the work, wherein the V loading [determined by ion-coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)] was normalized to the surface area of In2O3 (Table S1). Catalysts were denoted as xV/In, wherein x represents the surface V density and varies from 0 to 5.6V nm2.
2.2. Activity Tests
The following pre-mixed gas cylinders were purchased from airgas and used for activity tests, including 5% C3H8/He and 2% CO2/Ar. The activity test of the CO2-ODHP reaction was performed using an Altamira Instruments system (AMI-200). Typically, 100 mg of the catalyst was diluted with 600 mg of quartz sand (6080 mesh). The mixture was loaded in a quartz U-tube (i.d. = 10 mm) with quartz wool at both ends of the mixture. Prior to the activity test, 2% CO2/Ar was introduced to pretreat the catalyst at 500 C for 1 h under 30 mL min1. Then, the catalyst bed was cooled to the desired temperature. The activity test was initiated by switching to the reaction gas consisting of C3H8, CO2 and balanced with He/Ar (C3H8/CO2 = 1) with weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 18000 mL g1 h1. The reaction was conducted in the temperature range of 350540 C, and each reaction temperature was maintained for 2 h.
Compositions of effluent gas were analyzed periodically using an online SRI 8610C gas chromatograph equipped with both thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID) detectors. MTX-WAX and Molecular Sieve 5A columns were attached to the TCD detector, analyzing CO and CO2, while HayeSep-D and alumina were attached to the FID detector, analyzing hydrocarbons including C3H8, C3H6, C2H6, C2H4, and CH4. A mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum) was also coupled with GC to monitor the real-time fragments of reactants and products in the effluent gas. Conversion and selectivity were calculated based on the reported methods (see Section S3 in Supporting Information). (39,40)
To study the coking on spent catalysts, stability tests were run at 540 C for ca. 10 h. The spent catalyst bed was flushed with Ar in 30 mL min1, and the temperature was cooled to 50 C. Then, the temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiment was performed using either 2.5% O2/He or 2% CO2/Ar (40 mL min1). The temperature was ramped up to 730 C at a rate of 10 C min1 and maintained for 0.5 h. The generated CO2 or CO from the outlet was recorded by an OmniStar mass spectrometer (MS) (Pfeiffer Vacuum).
For kinetic studies, compositions were altered by varying the flow rates of 5% C3H8/He, 2% CO2/Ar, and Ar with a constant total flow rate of 40 mL min1. All reactions were conducted at 500 C where the conversion is below 10%, and the reduction of bulk In2O3 is limited according to H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) results. Of note, all flow rates in the present work are normal temperature and pressure (NTP)-based.
2.3. Characterization
Elemental analysis was performed using ICP-OES on a PerkinElmer Avio 500 model instrument. The thermal stability of the catalysts was performed by TGA/DTG analysis using a TA Instruments SDT Q50 instrument. Prior to ramping up the temperature, each sample was pretreated with 25 mL min1 N2 flow at 3035 C for 1 h to stabilize. Afterward, the sample was heated to 600 C at a ramp rate of 5 C min1 with 25 mL min1 N2. Such a process was recycled three times.
NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), CO2-TPD, and TPR were performed using AMI 200. 50 mg of the fresh catalysts was charged into a U tube for all measurements, except V2O5 (40 mg) for H2-TPR. In NH3-TPD, the catalyst was pretreated in 2% CO2/Ar at 500 C for 1 h. Then, the system was flushed in Ar, and the temperature was cooled to 120 C. NH3 adsorption (2% NH3/He) was carried out for 1 h (30 mL min1), followed by Ar flush at 30 mL min1 for 1 h. TPD was then initiated from 120 to 730 C (5 C min1) in Ar (30 mL min1) and maintained for 0.5 h. In CO2-TPD, after similar pretreatment, CO2 adsorption (2% CO2/Ar, 30 mL min1) was performed at 140 C for 1 h, followed by Ar flush and cooling to 50 C. TPD was initiated from 50 to 620 C (5 C min1) in Ar (30 mL min1) and maintained for 0.5 h. In H2-TPR, the pretreated catalyst bed was cooled to 50 C prior. Then, the catalyst was reduced in 4% H2/Ar (30 mL min1) ramping from 50 to 830 C (5 C min1) and maintained for 1 h. For both NH3- and CO2-TPD measurements, the effluent gas was recorded using the same mass spectrometer as TPO and activity tests. The TCD detector was used to record the H2 signals, and a cooling trap was applied prior to the detector to trap moisture.
The NH3 adsorption-DRIFTS experiment was performed using a Thermo Nicolet Nexus 670 FT-IR spectrometer with an MCT detector. Each spectrum was acquired with 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm1. The sample was loaded in a ceramic cup, and a DRIFTS cell (Pike Technologies) was used. In the experiment, the catalyst was pretreated at 500 C in 2% CO2/Ar (30 mL min1) for 1 h. The system was then cooled to 400, 300, and 200 C in Ar (30 mL min1), and corresponding spectra were collected as background references. The system was then cooled to 120 C and flushed with Ar for 1 h. The NH3 adsorption was performed at 120 C using 1% NH3/Ar/He (30 mL min1) for 30 min, followed by Ar flushing for 30 min (30 mL min1) to remove physisorbed NH3. The temperature was then heated up sequentially to 200, 300, and 400 C at a ramp of 10 C min1 in Ar. At each temperature, the spectra were continuously recorded every 30 s. The CO2-DRIFTS experiment was performed using the same equipment by following a similar procedure. 2% CO2/Ar was used during CO2-DRIFTS (30 mL min1). The temperature was elevated to 200, 300, 400, 500, and 550 C at a ramp of 10 C min1. The spectra were processed by using the background spectra acquired at corresponding temperatures.
The content and oxidation states of surface region VOx species were monitored by NAP-XPS. Spectra of the VOx-loaded In2O3 catalyst were acquired with a SPECS DeviSim NAP reactor coupled with a PHOIBOS 150 NAP electron energy analyzer equipped with a XR 50 MF Al Kα X-ray source (1486.7 eV). The sample was prepared by pressing the powder onto a SS 316 steel mesh by applying 5 MPa for 5 min. The pressed sample was then loaded onto a stainless-steel sample holder with a type K thermocouple enabling online measurement of the sample temperature as it was heated using an e-beam heater. The spectra were acquired with a 0.05 eV resolution and were repeated several times to reduce the noise-to-signal ratio. All gasses were flowed as to maintain a pressure of 1 mbar in the NAP reaction cell. The resulting spectra were processed using CasaXPS (version 2.3.22PR1.0). Due to the lack of a strong C 1s spectra after the initial in situ oxidation of the catalyst, the O 1s spectra were used for binding energy correction. While some contribution by the VOx species existed, In2O3 contributed the bulk of the O 1s signal, resulting in a reliable means of correction. The possible reduction of the In in the surface region was checked for by monitoring the In Auger spectra. (41) The V oxidation states were quantified by analyzing only the V 2p3/2 spinorbit split core spectra due to the weak intensity of the V 2p1/2 spinorbit split core spectra. Previously established binding energies, LorentzianGaussian mixing ratios, and relative full width at half maximum (fwhm) values were applied for the V 2p3/2 oxidation state quantification. (42) Consecutive treatments were carried out at 500 C for 1 h at a time in the following sequence: 10% O2/Ar, 5% CO2/Ar, 2.5% C3H8/2.5% CO2/Ar, 5% CO2/Ar, and 5% C3H8/Ar. There is no regeneration between steps, and these measurements are continuous.
In situ Raman scattering for the samples under reaction conditions was collected on a multiwavelength Raman system using 532 nm laser excitation. Raman scattering was collected via a customized ellipsoidal mirror and diffracted by a fiber optics bundle to the spectrograph stage of a triple Raman spectroscopy (Princeton Instruments Acton Trivista 555). An edge filter (Semrock) was used in front of the UVvis fiber optic bundle (Princeton instruments) to block the laser irradiation. A neutral density filter was used to attenuate the laser power to 20%, less than 10 mW at the sample position. An UV-enhanced liquid N2-cooled CCD detector (Princeton Instrument) was used to detect signals. The Raman catalytic reactor (Linkam CCR1000) was placed on an XY stage (Princeton Scientific, OptiScan XY system). During acquisition, the stage translates in a raster mode, which can provide the information of heterogeneity of the samples. The fast translation and the attenuated laser power are also able to minimize the laser damage of the sample. In the experiment, catalysts were pretreated in situ in the Raman reactor before Raman spectral collection at 120 C. The pretreatment was carried out by heating the sample in 2% CO2/Ar (30 mL min1) at 500 C (ramping rate 10 C min1) and held for 30 min. In the reaction, the pretreated catalyst experienced consecutive treatments in CO2, C3H8/CO2 (1/1), and CO2 again at 500 C. The Raman spectra of dehydrated catalysts were acquired at a different Raman system, and the detailed procedures are described in the Supporting Information.
UVvis DRS measurements were performed in the 200800 nm range with an Agilent Cary 5000 UVvis and NIR spectrophotometer. Polytetrafluoroethylene powder (35 μm, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a reflectance standard. VOx/In2O3 catalysts were thoroughly mixed with silica at a 1:1 weight ratio to overcome the samples signal nonlinearity with intensity. Fumed silica (Cab-O-Sil EH-5, Cabot) was first hydrated with Milli-Q ultrapure water and then dried under 100 mL min1 of dry air (AI D300, Airgas) for 16 h. A heating/cooling rate of 10 C min1 was used throughout. After crushing with an agate mortar and pestle, the silica was calcined at 500 C for 4 h under 100 mL min1 of air. The silica-diluted VOx/In2O3 samples were loaded into a reaction cell (Harrick Scientific HVC-DR2) and connected to a gas flow control system. A Harrick ATC temperature controller unit controlled the catalyst temperature. Dehydration was performed under 10% O2/Ar (airgas, 30 mL min1) as samples were heated to 500 C and held for 30 min, followed by cooling to 120 C where the dehydrated spectra were taken. The spectra were acquired with 1 nm resolution and a dwell time of 1.5 s (a scan rate of 40 nm min1) while using a double beam mode with full slit height and a slit beam width of 2 nm. The surface VOx direct band gap was determined using the KubelkaMunk formalism to convert the reflectance into the equivalent absorption coefficient function, F(R), where R is the ratio of the sample reflectance to the standard reflectance. The respective edge energies of the dehydrated V5+ molecular structures were calculated from the linear fit intercept of a plot of (F(R)hν)2 as a function of the photon energy (hν) on the linear low-energy side of the plot (errors are usually estimated to be 0.11 eV (43)). The direct band gap energy is assumed to have an absolute error lower than 0.11 eV related to the inherent uncertainty in the manual fitting process. (43)
XAS measurements were conducted at the materials research collaborative access team bending magnet line (10-BM) of the advanced photon source, Argonne National Laboratory. (44) Measurements at the V K edge (5465 eV) were performed in the fluorescence mode using a vortex four-element detector. The sample wafer and fluorescence detector were positioned 45 and 90 relative to the X-ray beam respectively. Fluorescence-mode samples were ground into a fine powder in a mortar and pestle and pressed into a self-supporting wafer inside a stainless-steel sample holder. The potential for over-absorption artifacts was assessed by estimating the transmission edge step at the V K edge of three absorption lengths worth of sample. The calculated edge step for each sample composition was found to be well below 0.1, meaning over-absorption artifacts are negligibly small for the fluorescence data. In situ treatments were performed in a heated reaction cell described previously. (45) The sample temperature was monitored using a K-type thermocouple, and gas was introduced using a set of mass flow controllers. He, CO2, and 5% propane in He were acquired from airgas (ultra-high purity grade). Samples were measured as-synthesized and after a sequence of four treatments in CO2 and C3H8/CO2, followed by in C3H8, and CO2 after the reaction. After each treatment, the sample was cooled to room temperature in the treatment atmosphere, and spectra were collected under 100 sccm of the flowing gas. A total of six scans were collected for each treatment and averaged to yield the final data set. No discernible changes were observed between scans for a given treatment. Detailed experimental description and data analysis can be found in the Supporting Information.

3.1. Activity Performance
To evaluate the reactivity of VOx-In2O3 catalysts, the CO2-ODHP reaction was conducted in the temperature range of 350540 C. A blank test was performed on quartz sand under the same reaction conditions, and no activity was observed (Figure S2). As shown in Figure 1A, In2O3 shows a high C3H6 selectivity at a lower C3H8 conversion, but the selectivity decreases rapidly with the increasing conversion. All VOx-loaded catalysts present a higher C3H6 selectivity than In2O3 under isoconversional conditions, and 3.4V/In exhibits the highest C3H6 selectivity among all VOx/In2O3 catalysts. For example, at 3.3% C3H8 conversion, the C3H6 selectivity of 3.4V/In is 73%, which is ca. 1.5-fold higher than that of In2O3. Moreover, 3.4V/In exhibits well-improved stability in comparison to In2O3 at both 500 and 540 C within the examined time-on-stream (TOS) (Figure 1B). The reduction in C3H6 yield is mostly related to the decrease in conversion (deactivation) but not the decrease in selectivity. C3H8 conversion decreases with the addition of VOx, and this is even more distinct in the trend of CO2 conversion (Figure S3).

To study the role of CO2 in the reaction paths, comparative studies between DHP and CO2-ODHP were performed on 3.4V/In and In2O3. As shown in Figure 2A, In2O3 presents a relatively lower C3H8 conversion (ca. 2%) but a higher C3H6 selectivity (ca. 90%) under DHP conditions. Introducing CO2 results in a significant reduction in selectivity to ca. 50%, while the C3H8 conversion is almost doubled. Differently, the selectivity of 3.4V/In is well retained in the presence of CO2, together with a nearly doubled conversion (Figure 2B). The formation rate of products is also evaluated in space-time-yield (STY), as shown in Figure S4. 3.4V/In shows a comparable C3H6 STY as In2O3 during CO2-ODHP cycles and even surpasses In2O3 during the third cycle of CO2-ODHP (Figure S4A). On the other hand, the presence of CO2 during CO2-ODHP significantly promotes the formation of CO on In2O3 in comparison to 3.4V/In (Figure S4B). Apparently, CO2 plays a positive role in promoting the dehydrogenation reaction in the presence of VOx. The CO2-based CO selectivity was tracked to study the carbon source of formed CO. For both RWGS and CO2-ODHP, the stoichiometry gives a 1/1 M ratio between consumed CO2 and formed CO, while that ratio is 1/2 for PDR. As shown in Figure S5, both In2O3 and 3.4V/In exhibit a CO selectivity beyond 100%, implying the contribution of PDR in CO formation other than CO2-ODHP. In2O3 presents an appreciably higher value (130140%) than 3.4V/In (110120%) under isoconversional conditions (Figure S5). In other words, 3040% of CO originates from PDR on In2O3, while that has been decreased to 1020% from PDR on 3.4V/In. In addition, the relationship between the CO/C3H6 molar ratio and CO2/C3H8 conversion ratio of three cycles of CO2-ODHP is plotted in Figure S6. Of note, the stoichiometries of CO2-ODHP and PDR suggest 1/1 and 3/1 M ratios, respectively. As shown in Figure S6, the CO2/C3H8 conversion ratio is higher than 1/1 for both In2O3 and 3.4V/In, again indicating the occurrence of PDR. On the other hand, 3.4V/In presents a drastically lower CO/C3H6 molar ratio than In2O3, clearly demonstrating a shift in reaction pathways from PDR to CO2-ODHP. Such a shift in reaction paths can also be reflected from mass spectrometer (MS) signals of H2. As shown in Figure S7, In2O3 shows significantly higher H2 signals (m/z = 2) than 3.4V/In during each ODHP cycle of DHP-ODHP alternating experiments. Such a distinction also signifies the VOx-induced shift in reaction pathways as PDR produces much more H2 than ODHP based on stoichiometry. It is further speculated that combining In2O3 with redox-active VOx enables the modification of surface active sites, which leads to such a shift from PDR to CO2-ODHP. This will be majorly explored by characterizations, which will be discussed in the following sections.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Catalytic performance of comparative studies between DHP and CO2-ODHP on In2O3 (A) and 3.4V/In (B). The reaction was conducted at 500 C. For both DHP and CO2-ODHP, C3H8 composition was fixed at 1.4%, and WHSV was 18000 mL g1 h1. In CO2-ODHP, the C3H8/CO2 ratio was 1/1.
As aforementioned, CO2-ODHP can proceed through two mechanisms. The first scenario includes a net reaction of DHP and RWGS, which can be linked by the H2 produced from DHP and then consumed by RWGS. (11,29) The other is a one-cycle mechanism, in which CO2 closes the cycle to form CO without going through a separate RWGS step. (29) To provide insights into the reaction mechanisms in the presence and absence of VOx on In2O3, RWGS activity tests were performed on In2O3 and 3.4V/In, and the temperature-dependent H2 and CO2 conversions are plotted in Figure S8. Both catalysts present only RWGS activity without any detectable methanation activity. 3.4V/In shows slightly lower conversions in both reagents than In2O3, especially at higher temperatures. Clearly, incorporating VOx barely impacts the reaction pathway of RWGS but only activity. This suggests that the lower H2 amount detected during CO2-ODHP over VOx/In2O3 than In2O3 is not because of the extensive RWGS consumption but rather related to less H2 production from the reactions including PDR and CO2-ODHP. Thus, it is reasonable to deduce that the one-cycle mechanism contributes more to CO2-ODHP on VOx/In2O3.
Arrhenius plots and apparent activation energy (Eapp) over 3.4V/In and In2O3 are present in Figure S9 and Table S3, respectively. Adding VOx reduces Eapp of C3H8 from 108.5 kJ mol1 of In2O3 to 87.6 kJ mol1 of 3.4V/In. This might be associated with a pathway shift from PDR to CO2-ODHP. Kinetics studies were then conducted on the same catalysts to examine the influence of reactant compositions on reactivity. As shown in Figure 3A, the C3H8 conversion rate declines monotonically with the increase in CO2 compositions. As a more acidic molecule, CO2 adsorption is more favorable than C3H8 on In2O3, exerting negative impacts on propane dehydrogenation. (28) Differently, the conversion rate for 3.4V/In shows a volcano-like shape with the increase in CO2 compositions. The presence of VOx likely alleviates the competitive adsorption of reagent molecules at relatively lower CO2 compositions (Figure 3A). This can also be associated with the VOx-induced shift of the reaction pathway from PDR to CO2-ODHP. Although the competition still governs at higher CO2 compositions, the activity of 3.4V/In starts to surpass that of In2O3. As shown in Figure 3B, the competitive adsorption of reagent molecules still occurs on In2O3, while that is not evident on 3.4V/In.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Effect of CO2 (A) and C3H8 (B) compositions on the C3H8 conversion rate over 3.4V/In and In2O3. Compositions were altered by varying the flow rates of 5% C3H8/He, 2% CO2/Ar, and Ar with a constant total flow rate of 40 mL min1. Compositions of C3H8 and CO2 were fixed at 0.8 and 1.0% for (A) and (B), respectively. All reactions were conducted at 500 C where the conversion is below 10%, and the reduction of bulk In2O3 is limited according to H2-TPR results.
To evaluate coking, TPO experiments were conducted on spent catalysts by using both O2 and CO2 as oxidants. As shown in Figure S10A and Table S2, the peak of formed CO2 shifts toward lower temperatures for 3.4V/In in comparison to In2O3; a reduced amount of formed CO2 from O2-TPO profiles is observed on 3.4V/In than In2O3. The presence of VOx facilitates the coke removal and resists coking. The CO2-TPO profile confirms the formation of CO at ca. 396 C (Figure S10B,C). The reverse Boudouard reaction likely occurs for coke removal during CO2-ODHP.
In sum, incorporating VOx into In2O3 improves the C3H6 selectivity and improved stability. Kinetic studies imply that VOx plays an important role in governing the reaction pathway via propane dehydrogenation instead of PDR on In2O3 in the presence of CO2. Whether these catalytic behaviors originate from the individual materials and/or in a cooperative fashion between VOx and In2O3 is of interest to explore in the next step, especially their correlations with surface acidbase properties and redox cycles. For this purpose, the catalysts were characterized by various techniques, and the results will be discussed in the following sections.
3.2. Reducibility and AcidBase Properties
3.2.1. Reducibility
Reducibility of catalysts was studied by H2-TPR, and the resulting profiles are shown in Figure 4A. In2O3 exhibits a peak at 161 C, corresponding to the reduction of In oxide species with smaller particle sizes. (25,34,46,47) With the increase in V loadings, this peak gradually shifts to higher temperatures, especially from 1.6 to 3.4V nm2, beyond which the shift becomes less significant. Clearly, these reducible In2O3 species represent the ones that have intimate interactions with VOx. A subpeak appears at 340350 C, which can be attributed to the reduction of VOx species. (48) Considering the reduction peaks of bulk V2O5 (660700 C, Figure S11), these VOx species are dispersed on In2O3. These reducible VOx species increase significantly from 130.0 μmol g1 at 1.6V/In to 288.7 μmol g1 at 3.4V/In, beyond which its increase becomes slow (Table 1). A similar trend can be evidenced from the increase in the reducible In2O3 species ranging from 160 to 230 C. It suggests that 3.4V nm2 is approaching a monolayer surface coverage, which might be associated with a higher C3H6 selectivity for 1.6V/In and 3.4V/In. (1) The reduction of bulk In2O3 starts from ca. 500 C and presents a maximum peak at ca. 751 C (Figure S11) for In2O3. Incorporating VOx into In2O3 shifts the reduction of bulk In2O3 toward higher temperatures, indicating its role in inhibiting the deep reduction of In2O3 (Figure S11). Considering the lower propylene selectivity and yield and poorer stability at higher temperatures of In2O3 (Figure 1), it is suggested that the deep reduction of In2O3 has a negative impact on the catalytic performance and stability.

3.2.2. Basicity
To study the surface basicity, CO2-TPD measurements were performed. Resultant profiles are present in Figure 4B, along with quantified CO2 amount in Table 1. For reference materials, V2O5 hardly exhibits CO2 adsorption, while In2O3 shows a significantly high adsorption capacity (96.6 μmol g1). On In2O3, the desorption peak within ca. 50300 C can be attributed to adsorbed CO2 on thermal-induced oxygen vacancies. (36,49) CO2-DRIFTS spectra show that CO2 is adsorbed as carbonate and bicarbonate on In2O3 (Figure S12 and Table S4). (5052) In addition to oxygen vacancies, the surface hydroxyl groups also play a role in CO2 adsorption, the consumption of which is evident from DRIFTS spectra (Figure S13A). The presence of VOx considerably reduces the CO2 adsorption capacity, especially the weakly bonded species, while retaining parts of the medium-bonded species (Figure 4B). Carbonate and bicarbonate are still evident on 3.4V/In through DRIFTS (Figure 4C and Table S5), except that the peak intensities are notably lower than those observed on In2O3 alone, again corroborating the suppression of CO2 adsorption after incorporating VOx. This is likely linked to the inhibited formation of surface oxygen vacancies and consumed hydroxyl groups by anchoring VOx (Figure S13B). Two negative IR bands, centered at 1029 and 2036 cm1, appear on 3.4V/In (Figure 4C), which correspond to the fundamental stretching vibration and the overtone of vanadyl groups (VO), respectively. (5355) The negative bands are indicative of the CO2 adsorption on vanadyl groups. (56) In sum, adding VOx significantly neutralizes the surface basicity of In2O3. Together with the retarded reduction of In2O3, the presence of VOx might explain the suppressed PDR pathway.
3.2.3. Acidity
The surface acidity of the dehydrated VOx/In2O3 catalysts was probed by NH3-TPD, and the resulting profiles are shown in Figure 4D. In2O3 presents a major peak at ca. 175 C with a wide range, as well as another bump at ca. 600 C. Incorporating VOx results in an extra peak at ca. 320440 C, the position of which gradually shifts to higher temperatures with the increase in V loadings. Meanwhile, the bump observed on In2O3 at ca. 600 C diminishes. All VOx/In2O3 catalysts exhibit a higher NH3 adsorption capacity than In2O3 (Table 1). VOx is known with its acid sites such as vanadyl groups (VO). (1) Adding VOx can increase the surface acid sites below or close to a monolayer-surface coverage.
The acid sites were further studied by in situ DRIFTS. In2O3 exhibits both Lewis (NH3 species bands at 1622 cm1) and Brnsted bands (NH4+ species at 1407 to 1434 cm1), as shown in Figure S14A. The adsorbed NH3 on Lewis acid sites is less thermally stable than that on Brnsted acid sites as it diminishes below 300 C. Thus, the peak at ca. 175 C from TPD profiles (Figure 4D) signifies the NH3 adsorption on Lewis acid sites of In2O3, while the bump at ca. 600 C is indicative of the NH3 adsorption on Brnsted acid sites such as hydroxyl groups. Both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites are also observed on 3.4V/In from Figure S14B. Except for the remaining Lewis sites on In2O3 responsible for the low-temperature desorption peak (175190 C) from the TPD profile (Figure 4D), the VOx-dependent peaks at ca. 320440 C (Figure 4D) correspond to the acid sites that are associated with VOx species, such as vanadyl groups and/or bridging hydroxyl groups (VO(H)In). Two negative bands, centered at 1024 and 2031 cm1, emerge upon NH3 adsorption (Figure S14B), corresponding to the consumption of vanadyl groups of VOx due to the interaction with NH3. (1,55) The negative peak becomes less intense with the desorption temperature of NH3 and almost disappears after 400 C desorption, suggesting that the surface VOx species on In2O3 at below or close to a monolayer coverage are responsible for the medium strength (below 400 C in Figure 4D) acid sites.
3.3. Catalyst Structure and Redox Cycle
3.3.1. Catalyst Structure
Figure 5A shows the Raman spectra of all dehydrated VOx/In2O3 catalysts at 120 C in O2/Ar after the pretreatment at 500 C. For 1.6V/In, the band at 1011 cm1, corresponding to the vanadyl groups, (55) signifies the presence of less polymerized vanadates such as monovanadate. With the increase in VOx loadings, the band gradually shifts to 1025 cm1 and finally to 1030 cm1, demonstrating the progressive formation of polyvanadate on the catalyst surface. A broad peak, centered at ca. 860 cm1, emerges on all VOx/In2O3 catalysts, indicating the presence of InOV structure in the catalyst. (1,55) The other V-involving species include the stretching vibration of VO for V2O5 particles at 995 cm1 for 5.6V/In (Figure S1) and the symmetric stretching vibration of VO43 in InVO4 at 912 cm1 for 3.45.6V/In catalysts. (1,55,5759) The Raman cross section of V2O5 is 10 times larger than dispersed VOx species. (60) Based on the peak intensities in Figure 5A, dispersed VOx is dominant. Among these species, mono- and polyvanadates have been demonstrated as active sites for the ODHP reaction, while V2O5 particles lead to over-oxidation. (1,27)

UVvis DRS measurements were performed to verify the structure of vanadate at the surface. The Tauc plots for VOx/In2O3 catalysts are presented in Figure S15. The edge energies of the ligand-to-metal-charge-transfer transitions of the dehydrated V5+ molecular structures were calculated from the abscissa intercept of the photon energy in the low-energy side of the in situ UVvis DRS-derived Tauc plots. The increasing addition of vanadium to In2O3 initially results in a decrease in the edge energy from 3.13 (1.6V/In) to 2.95 eV (3.4V/In), indicating an increase in the polymerization degree of surface VOx site. This suggests that at the lowest vanadium loading (1.6V/In), the surface VOx species are a mix of monomeric (20%) and polymeric (80%) VO4 sites. (61) At higher vanadium loadings, the edge energy first decreases to 2.95 eV (3.4V/In) and then increases slightly to 3.00 eV for both 4.6 and 5.6V/In, indicative of completely polymeric VO4 surface sites. (61) In sum, VOx surface species polymerize progressively on In2O3 with loadings, with only a limited fraction of monomeric sites (20%) present at a low surface V density of 1.6V. These observations are in general consistent with the Raman results.
In situ Raman experiments were performed to study the catalyst structures under reaction conditions. As shown in Figure 5B, In2O3 presents four major bands. The Raman feature at 305 cm1 is interpreted as the δ(InO6) bending vibration of octahedra of bcc-In2O3; the band at 360 cm1 is assigned to the ν(InOIn) stretching vibration of InOIn linkage; the other two bands at 492 and 622 cm1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of the same ν(InO6) octahedra. (36,49,6264) By switching from CO2 to C3H8/CO2, the relative intensity of 360 cm1 increases and subsequently decreases after switching back to CO2. In contrast, such a change is not significant on 3.4V/In under the same conditions (Figure 5C). The band at 360 cm1 is sensitive to the presence of oxygen vacancies in In2O3, and the ratio of the peak areas between 305 (I1) and 360 cm1 (I2) is usually adopted to quantify the relative content change in oxygen vacancies. (63,64) As shown in Figure 5D, the ratio for In2O3 varies significantly by switching from CO2 to C3H8/CO2, and it appears to have more oxygen vacancies under reaction conditions than that in CO2 alone. Recently, Hess et al. reported the oxygen and vacancy diffusion on In2O3 at elevated temperatures, in which the oxygen atoms diffuse to the surface for oxidation, creating oxygen defects in the bulk. (62) Combined with this self-diffusion of oxygen, the surface of In2O3 alone is likely partially reduced due to the presence of the reducing agent C3H8, while CO2 can reoxidize the catalyst. In contrast, the intensity ratio of 3.4V/In is relatively stable in CO2 and C3H8/CO2 (Figure 5D), signifying the role of VOx in inhibiting the deep reduction of In2O3 under CO2-ODHP reaction conditions, as well as in impeding the contact between CO2 and surface vacancies for PDR.
DFT calculations were performed to study the effect of VOx on the formation of vacancies on In2O3, and a model V2O5 dimer on In2O3 (110) was tested. As shown in Figure S16, the V2O5 dimer increases the oxygen vacancy formation energies to a certain extent for most lattice oxygen, such as the sites which are directly underneath VOx (Table S6). This simple model corroborates the role of VOx in inhibiting the deep reduction of In2O3. The Raman peaks of InOV structure and VO in polyvanadate show an evident decrease in intensity under reaction conditions (Figure 5C). By referring the peak area of VOx (I3) to that of I1 (305 cm1) (Figure 5D), quantification analysis reveals that the normalized area of VOx decreases in the C3H8/CO2 environment and recovers in the followed CO2 treatment. This signifies a potential redox cycle of VOx under CO2-ODHP reaction conditions via a MvK mechanism. (27)
3.3.2. Redox Behaviors
To gain insights into the redox characters and oxidation states, in situ NAP-XPS was performed on 3.4V/In and In2O3 under conditions similar to the reaction. Figure 6A,B presents the respective In 3d XPS spectra of In2O3 and 3.4V/In under consecutive treatments in O2, CO2, C3H8/CO2, and CO2 again after the reaction at 500 C. Based on H2-TPR and Raman results and catalytic performance, we expected to observe different reduction behaviors of surface indium oxide species between In2O3 and 3.4V/In, wherein 3.4V/In should be more resistant to reduction. However, the metallic In0 species are absent for both catalysts and nor can be found in In MNN Auger spectra (Figure S17). A possible explanation is the diffusion of oxygen vacancies between the surface and the bulk of In2O3, which can maintain the surface In species under oxidized conditions. (62) The bulk reduction via such an oxygen migration is discernible from the in situ Raman results (Figure 5). Of note, volatilization of the metallic In0 phase is possible at high temperatures. TGA analysis indicates that the weight loss (due to the potential volatilization of In0) of In2O3 and 3.4V/In in N2 is limited after three-cycle measurements (Figure S18).
Figure 6
Figure 6. In situ In 3d NAP-XPS spectra of In2O3 (A) and 3.4V/In (B) and V 2p3/2 XPS spectra of 3.4V/In (C) under consecutive treatments in O2, CO2, C3H8/CO2, and CO2 again after the reaction for regeneration and C3H8 at 500 C.
Figure 6C shows the XP spectra of 3.4V/In in the region of V 2p3/2 under similar consecutive treatments. The position of the maximal intensity barely changes, but the shape of the V 2p signal becomes less symmetric when C3H8 is present. This suggests the evolution of V4+ species under reaction conditions, especially in C3H8 alone. Besides, the normalized area of the V 2p3/2 region decreases after the exposure to C3H8 in the gas flow, implying the depletion of possibly reduced V into the bulk under reducing conditions. For the last three treatments, deconvolution analysis shows that the composition of V4+ decreases in the following order: C3H8 > C3H8/CO2 > CO2 (Table S7). Clearly, the joint presence of V4+ and V5+ under reaction conditions demonstrates the presence of a VOx redox cycle under reaction conditions, in line with the Raman results. This also corroborates the contribution of VOx to the overall activity performance via a MvK mechanism. (1,27)
To provide more information in the redox cycle of VOx and coordination environment of the catalysts, in situ XAS experiments were performed. Detailed data processing and analysis are elaborated in the Supporting Information (Figures S19S25 and Tables S8S16). Figure 7A shows the V K edge XANES spectra of 3.4V/In as synthesized and after four sequential treatments including 2.5% CO2, 2.5% CO2 + 2.5% C3H8, 2.5% C3H8 (post reaction), and 2.5% CO2 (post reaction), with each treatment carried out at 500 C for 30 min. For comparison, the XANES spectra of 3.4V/In under C3H8/CO2 is plotted with reference materials V2O3, VO2, and V(AcAc)3 in Figure 7B. The pre-edge peak of 3.4V/In after the treatment in C3H8/CO2 is at a lower energy than V(AcAc)3 and an intensity intermediate between V2O3 and V(AcAc)3, implying that vanadium has a local environment distinct from the octahedral or distorted octahedral symmetry of V(AcAc)3 or V2O3. The edge position that lies between the two V3+ references suggests that V is in the 3+ oxidation state. This is consistent with the XPS results, in which V3+ is missing from the surface region, and some of the V is depleted from the surface region under C3H8. The XANES of samples treated post reaction sequentially in C3H8-post and then in CO2-post show subtle variation in pre-edge shape and edge energy compared to the one treated in C3H8/CO2 (Figure 7A). This could be caused by partial redox or due to adsorbates on surface vanadium sites.

(C) R space V K edge EXAFS spectra of fresh 3.4V/In and the same catalyst after sequential treatment in 2.5% CO2 and 2.5% CO2 + 2.5% C3H8, as well as those after sequential treatments in 2.5% C3H8 and 2.5% CO2 after the reaction in 2.5% CO2 + 2.5% C3H8 (D). Treatment conditions are detailed in Table S8.
Figure 7C,D shows the V K edge R space EXAFS of 3.4V/In after the same sequential treatments, along with the structural parameters in Table 2. The fresh and CO2-treated catalysts have similar spectra, with a single large peak centered at 1.2 Å (phase uncorrected distance) due to VO scattering. After the treatment in CO2, VO coordination number drops to 4.2, which is likely due to the dehydration. The short VO bond distance (1.65 Å) and VO coordination number (45) are consistent with V in the 5+ oxidation state. No distinct structure is observed past the first shell which reflects the configurational complexity of surface vanadium sites. In contrast, after the treatment in C3H8/CO2, strong second and third shell scatterings are seen. This implies a more crystalline local structure around vanadium after treatment. To model the structure after C3H8/CO2 treatment, it was necessary to include both a VO bond and a VC bond to properly fit the first shell. The extended structure was modeled using VV and VIn scattering paths within an InV mixed oxide. The long VO bond distance (2.066 Å) is consistent with a more reduced vanadium and in agreement with the reduced edge energy seen in the XANES. The appearance of a more ordered V environment after C3H8/CO2 treatment may explain the difference in the oxidation state seen in XAS versus by XPS measurement. While XPS only measures V species in the near surface region, XAS measures all V present in the sample. The reduction to V3+ may allow vanadium to diffuse into the In2O3 lattice rapidly, which would explain the intensity loss in XPS after reducing treatment and the appearance of an ordered V environment in XAS.

aThe second light scatterer in the first shell is VC for C3H8/CO2 and C3H8-post and is VO for CO2-post.
After the treatment in the C3H8-post reaction (Figure 7D), the VO coordination number remains unchanged, while the VV and VIn coordination numbers drop by 0.6 and 0.9, respectively. The VC coordination number increases from 0.3 to 0.5. A subsequent treatment in CO2-post reaction increases the VM (V or In) coordination numbers close to the values seen after the C3H8/CO2 treatment. In the first shell, the CO2 post reaction treatment causes the VO coordination number to change from 3.5 to 2.9. Additionally, all VC coordination is lost, and instead a short VO bond is observed at 1.591 Å, indicative of the oxidation of V to higher oxidation states.
Taken together, these changes in coordination numbers show that under reaction conditions (C3H8/CO2), vanadium reduces and forms a mixed oxide with In2O3. A fraction of surface vanadium sites has bonded with a carbon-containing species, likely derived from propane under conditions of both C3H8/CO2 and C3H8 alone. When treated in C3H8 alone, this surface coverage of carbon-containing species increases, and the VM coordination number decreases. Likely, the reduction, occurring in the subsurface, results in the loss of oxygen and breaking of InOV (as evidenced by a smaller VO coordination number), followed by the self-diffusion of bulk oxygen to oxidize the surface. (62) This agrees with the observations from Raman results, in which the reduction and reoxidation of In2O3 are evidenced in the presence of C3H8 and CO2, respectively (Figure 5). Treating in CO2 removes the carbon-containing species bonded to V and regenerates the VO bond. These results are consistent with vanadium sites acting as binding sites for propane adsorption and dehydrogenation and with CO2 acting as a soft oxidant facilitating its removal.
4. Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Raman and UVvis DRS results reveal the presence of the InOV structure and dispersed polyvanadates for 3.4V/In with the optimal composition for the CO2-ODHP performance. In situ Raman, NAP-XPS, and XAS spectra provide strong evidence of the redox cycle of VOx under reaction conditions, wherein CO2 plays a role in reoxidizing V3+/V4+ to V5+. It is critical to link these observations with the acidbase and redox properties of VOx/In2O3 catalysts, as well as to advance the understanding of their correlations with the well-retained high C3H6 selectivity and improved stability.
In2O3 is a known catalyst candidate for ODHP reactions; however, its reaction mechanism is elusive. (11,33) Our in situ Raman results demonstrate the reduction and reoxidation of In2O3 under C3H8/CO2 and CO2 conditions, respectively (Figure 5). Although Raman probes the bulk, the redox has to start from the surface and then dynamically propagates into the bulk. Besides, the identified reducible In2O3 species that have intimate interactions with VOx species from H2-TPR profiles (160230 C from Figure 4A) are likely those redox-active InOx species. Thus, the redox property of InOx might play a role in CO2-ODHP, similar to MvK on VOx. (1) However, in situ NAP-XPS and AES results present a stable oxidation state of In species on the surface (Figure 6). Likely, the redox cycle happens too fast to be captured, or volatilization of metallic In may occur, both of which are responsible for the missing metallic In phase from spectra. As a result, even if the redox cycle of InOx indeed presents, it is limited based on our observations. In other words, both heterolytic dissociation and MvK are possible for In2O3 for CO2-ODHP. This is the place where more effort is needed in the future.
Our NAP-XPS results indicate that the surface In species stay at a stable oxidation state in the case for In2O3 during reactions (Figure 6). Thus, a similar heterolytic dissociation mechanism might be applicable to In2O3. Based on H2-TPR and Raman results, a deep reduction of In2O3 occurs at higher temperatures (>500 C, Figures 4 and S11), which results in decreased selectivity and deactivation. The first crucial role of surface vanadates and the bridging InOV structure is to help resist the deep reduction of In2O3 under reaction conditions, therefore maintaining the selectivity and improving the stability for CO2-ODHP.
In2O3 is a basic metal oxide that features CO2 adsorption on oxygen vacancies. (35,49,63,65,66) However, such a strong affinity toward CO2 may poison the surface to favor CO2 adsorption and activation for side reactions such as PDR. Most recently, by studying a series of Pd bimetallic catalysts for CO2-assisted ethane dehydrogenation, Chen et al. showed that a metallic surface favors dry reforming, while an oxidic surface favors CH scission in ethane. (67) Linked to our observations, it is suggested that the reduction of In2O3 under reaction conditions is another reason resulting in PDR and impairing the C3H8 dehydrogenation on In2O3. The presence of vanadates neutralizes these basic sites and inhibits the deep reduction of In2O3, as evidenced by the chemisorption results (Figure 4 and Table 1). This further enables the suppression of PDR, resulting in an enhanced C3H6 selectivity.
Studies of reaction paths in the current work shows that CO2-ODHP proceeds more through a one-cycle mechanism. In specific, CO2 can form CO without undergoing a separate RWGS step. In this case, CO2 plays a role in reoxidizing the VOx and potentially InOx to close the redox cycles, releasing CO and H2O as products. Noteworthily, the produced amount of CO is much less in CO2-ODHP than that in PDR, which can be reflected from the retained higher C3H6 selectivity over V/In catalysts than that over In2O3. Therefore, the second role of VOx is to shift the role of CO2 from contributing to PDR on In2O3 to completing the redox cycle for propane dehydrogenation as a soft oxidant. This is a promising way of utilizing the reagent molecules for a desired reaction pathway.
5. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In this work, we prepared a series of VOx/In2O3 with various surface V densities and compared the activity performance with In2O3 alone for CO2-ODHP. On In2O3, the C3H6 selectivity decreases sharply with the increase in C3H8 conversion and drops below 50% beyond 4% C3H8 conversion, as well as poor stability. This can be ascribed to the strong basicity and reduced In2O3 during ODHP that favor PDR to CO when the deep reduction occurs, especially at higher temperatures. In contrast, all VOx-loaded catalysts not only present higher C3H6 selectivity than In2O3 under isoconversional conditions (higher than 60% at 4% C3H8 conversion), but they also exhibit improved stability. The optimal surface V density is obtained at 3.4V nm2 for CO2-ODHP. Detailed characterization results identify the bridging InOV structure and dispersed mono-/polyvanadate on In2O3 at the VOx loading below a monolayer coverage (between 3.4 and 4.6V/nm2). The presence of the InOV structure and dispersed VOx species can help resist In2O3 reduction and suppress PDR, resulting in better selectivity and stability. Also, VOx itself contributes to the overall catalytic performance through the redox cycle by using CO2 as a soft oxidant. These findings provide insights into designing selective, robust catalysts for the CO2-ODHP reaction by manipulating the interplays between the redox property and acidbase interaction in catalysts based on mixed oxides.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
