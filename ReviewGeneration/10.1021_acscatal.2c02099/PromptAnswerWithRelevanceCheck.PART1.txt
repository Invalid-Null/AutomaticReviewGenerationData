1. Answer: No, the article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses only on vanadia loaded In2O3 catalysts.

2. Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of In2O3 and VOx/In2O3 affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that the presence of VOx helps resist reduction of In2O3 and neutralizes basic sites, leading to higher propylene selectivity and improved stability by suppressing propane dry reforming.

3. Answer: Yes, the article proposes a Mars-Van Krevelen type redox mechanism for VOx sites in propane dehydrogenation over VOx/In2O3 catalysts. It also suggests heterolytic dissociation of propane may occur on In2O3 sites. The active sites are identified as mono- and poly-vanadates species along with In-O-V linkages.  

4. Answer: Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects between VOx and In2O3 in the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows the interfacial VOx-InOx species help resist deep reduction of In2O3, leading to maintained selectivity and stability. The interfacial sites also facilitate VOx redox cycles during reaction.

5. Answer: No, the article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation.

6. Answer: The article does not investigate supported metal catalysts, so no examples or structure-function relationships are provided.

7. Answer: The article does not propose mechanistic pathways for supported metal catalysts, as none were studied.

[1] "Our interest lies in the In2O3-based catalysts because of their comparable C3H6 selectivity to Ga2O3 under isoconversional conditions (11) and well-known capability in activating CO2 molecules, such as CO2 hydrogenation."

[2] "Combining In2O3 with redox-active VOx enables the modification of surface active sites, which leads to such a shift from PDR to CO2-ODHP."

[3] "The first crucial role of surface vanadates and the bridging InOV structure is to help resist the deep reduction of In2O3 under reaction conditions, therefore maintaining the selectivity and improving the stability for CO2-ODHP."  

[4] "The presence of the InOV structure and dispersed VOx species can help resist In2O3 reduction and suppress PDR, resulting in better selectivity and stability."

[5] "Also, VOx itself contributes to the overall catalytic performance through the redox cycle by using CO2 as a soft oxidant."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. Specifically, it shows that incorporating redox-active VOx into basic In2O3 helps resist deep reduction of In2O3, modifies surface active sites to suppress propane dry reforming, and enables VOx to contribute through its own redox cycle. This tuning of properties results in higher propylene selectivity and improved catalyst stability.

[2] "Studies of reaction paths in the current work shows that CO2-ODHP proceeds more through a one-cycle mechanism. In specific, CO2 can form CO without undergoing a separate RWGS step. In this case, CO2 plays a role in reoxidizing the VOx and potentially InOx to close the redox cycles, releasing CO and H2O as products."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied In2O3 and VOx/In2O3 catalysts. It suggests CO2-ODHP proceeds through a one-cycle mechanism where CO2 helps close the redox cycle of VOx and potentially InOx species by reoxidizing them, without undergoing a separate RWGS step. The active sites are proposed to be the InOV structure and dispersed VOx species, which activate propane while CO2 acts as a soft oxidant.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文为所研究的In2O3和VOx/In2O3催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢反应的机理方案。它认为CO2-ODHP通过一个循环机理进行,CO2帮助关闭VOx和可能的InOx物种的氧化还原循环,将它们氧化,而不需要经过独立的RWGS步骤。活性位点被认为是InOV结构和分散的VOx物种,它们激活丙烷,而CO2作为软氧化剂发挥作用。

<quotes>
[1] "Over-oxidation to undesired carbon oxides (COx) is the major challenge with O2 as the oxidant, which reduces the selectivity toward alkenes."

[2] "Combining CO2 with the ODHP reaction can also potentially allow for the utilization of the carbon source from CO2 via a hydrogen-free manner." 

[3] "To tackle these issues, introducing a soft oxidant such as carbon dioxide (CO2) provides a potential avenue and has been applied in the coupling of methane, dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, propane, and iso-butane."

[4] "The positive roles of CO2 in the overall ODHP reaction include serving as (i) a diluent to enhance the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes and (ii) an agent to remove coke via the reverse Boudouard reaction."

[5] "Moreover, CO2 can help keep the metal components at a higher oxidation state during CO2-ODHP, such as inhibiting the formation of metallic iron and iron carbide with better activity toward isobutane dehydrogenation."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Answer: Yes, the article proposes CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation as a mechanistic scenario, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant to re-oxidize the catalyst and close the catalytic cycle. This helps overcome issues with over-oxidation and poor selectivity when using O2 as the oxidant. CO2 is proposed to act as a diluent, coke removal agent, and agent to keep metal sites oxidized. The specific reaction steps involve adsorption of propane, dehydrogenation over redox sites like VOx or InOx, and re-oxidation of these sites by CO2. 
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
3. 答案:是的,文章提出了CO2辅助氧化脱氢的机理方案,其中CO2充当软氧化剂的角色,可再氧化催化剂并闭合催化循环。这有助于解决使用O2作为氧化剂时过氧化和选择性差的问题。文章提出CO2可充当稀释剂、除炭剂和保持金属活性位氧化的剂。具体的反应步骤包括丙烷吸附、在VOx或InOx等氧化-还原活性位点上的脱氢,以及CO2对这些位点的再氧化。
