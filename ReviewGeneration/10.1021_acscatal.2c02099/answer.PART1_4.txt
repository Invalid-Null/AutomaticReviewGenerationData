2. Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of VOx/In2O3 affects propane dehydrogenation performance. Adding VOx helps resist reduction of In2O3, suppressing propane dry reforming and leading to higher propylene selectivity and improved stability. VOx also contributes through its own redox cycle, using CO2 as a soft oxidant.

2. 答案:是的,文章研究了调控VOx/In2O3的氧化态、氧迁移和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。添加VOx有助于抑制In2O3的还原,抑制丙烷干式重整,从而提高丙烯选择性和改善稳定性。 VOx还通过自身的氧化-还原循环发挥作用,利用CO2作为软氧化剂。

[1] "Over-oxidation to undesired carbon oxides (COx) is the major challenge with O2 as the oxidant, which reduces the selectivity toward alkenes."

[2] "Combining CO2 with the ODHP reaction can also potentially allow for the utilization of the carbon source from CO2 via a hydrogen-free manner." 

[3] "To tackle these issues, introducing a soft oxidant such as carbon dioxide (CO2) provides a potential avenue and has been applied in the coupling of methane, dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, propane, and iso-butane."

[4] "The positive roles of CO2 in the overall ODHP reaction include serving as (i) a diluent to enhance the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes and (ii) an agent to remove coke via the reverse Boudouard reaction."

[5] "Moreover, CO2 can help keep the metal components at a higher oxidation state during CO2-ODHP, such as inhibiting the formation of metallic iron and iron carbide with better activity toward isobutane dehydrogenation."

3. Answer: Yes, the article proposes CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation as a mechanistic scenario, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant to re-oxidize the catalyst and close the catalytic cycle. This helps overcome issues with over-oxidation and poor selectivity when using O2 as the oxidant. CO2 is proposed to act as a diluent, coke removal agent, and agent to keep metal sites oxidized. The specific reaction steps involve adsorption of propane, dehydrogenation over redox sites like VOx or InOx, and re-oxidation of these sites by CO2.

3. 答案:是的,文章提出了CO2辅助氧化脱氢的机理方案,其中CO2充当软氧化剂的角色,可再氧化催化剂并闭合催化循环。这有助于解决使用O2作为氧化剂时过氧化和选择性差的问题。文章提出CO2可充当稀释剂、除炭剂和保持金属活性位氧化的剂。具体的反应步骤包括丙烷吸附、在VOx或InOx等氧化-还原活性位点上的脱氢,以及CO2对这些位点的再氧化。

4. Answer: No, the article does not specifically explore metal-support interfacial effects in the VOx/In2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The focus is more on tuning the properties of the metal oxides themselves. No examples or insights into modulation of activity and selectivity by metal-support interfaces are provided.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
4. 答案:没有,文章没有具体探讨VOx/In2O3催化剂中金属-支撑物界面的效应对丙烷脱氢的影响。文章更多关注调控金属氧化物本身的性质。没有提供金属-支撑物界面的例子或调控活性和选择性的见解。
