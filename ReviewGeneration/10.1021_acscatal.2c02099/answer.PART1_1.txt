[1] "Our interest lies in the In2O3-based catalysts because of their comparable C3H6 selectivity to Ga2O3 under isoconversional conditions (11) and well-known capability in activating CO2 molecules, such as CO2 hydrogenation."

[2] "Combining In2O3 with redox-active VOx enables the modification of surface active sites, which leads to such a shift from PDR to CO2-ODHP."

[3] "The first crucial role of surface vanadates and the bridging InOV structure is to help resist the deep reduction of In2O3 under reaction conditions, therefore maintaining the selectivity and improving the stability for CO2-ODHP."  

[4] "The presence of the InOV structure and dispersed VOx species can help resist In2O3 reduction and suppress PDR, resulting in better selectivity and stability."

[5] "Also, VOx itself contributes to the overall catalytic performance through the redox cycle by using CO2 as a soft oxidant."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. Specifically, it shows that incorporating redox-active VOx into basic In2O3 helps resist deep reduction of In2O3, modifies surface active sites to suppress propane dry reforming, and enables VOx to contribute through its own redox cycle. This tuning of properties results in higher propylene selectivity and improved catalyst stability.

[2] "Studies of reaction paths in the current work shows that CO2-ODHP proceeds more through a one-cycle mechanism. In specific, CO2 can form CO without undergoing a separate RWGS step. In this case, CO2 plays a role in reoxidizing the VOx and potentially InOx to close the redox cycles, releasing CO and H2O as products."

[3] "The presence of the InOV structure and dispersed VOx species can help resist In2O3 reduction and suppress PDR, resulting in better selectivity and stability."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied In2O3 and VOx/In2O3 catalysts. It suggests CO2-ODHP proceeds through a one-cycle mechanism where CO2 helps close the redox cycle of VOx and potentially InOx species by reoxidizing them, without undergoing a separate RWGS step. The active sites are proposed to be the InOV structure and dispersed VOx species, which activate propane while CO2 acts as a soft oxidant.

答:是的,本文为所研究的In2O3和VOx/In2O3催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢反应的机理方案。它认为CO2-ODHP通过一个循环机理进行,CO2帮助关闭VOx和可能的InOx物种的氧化还原循环,将它们氧化,而不需要经过独立的RWGS步骤。活性位点被认为是InOV结构和分散的VOx物种,它们激活丙烷,而CO2作为软氧化剂发挥作用。

[2] "To reveal the catalyst compositionstructureactivity relationship, a wide array of the characterization techniques has been applied, including chemisorption, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UVvis DRS), and Raman spectroscopy."

Answer: Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in the VOx/In2O3 metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Specifically, it shows the presence of an InOV structure that arises from the interaction of VOx and In2O3. This structure, along with dispersed VOx species, helps resist reduction of In2O3 and suppress undesired reactions. The study provides insights into designing selective and robust catalysts by controlling metal-support interactions and properties like redox capability and acid-base interactions.
