[1] "To gain insights into the redox characters and oxidation states, in situ NAP-XPS was performed on 3.4V/In and In2O3 under conditions similar to the reaction." 

[2] "Our NAP-XPS results indicate that the surface In species stay at a stable oxidation state in the case for In2O3 during reactions (Figure 6)."

[3] "Figure 6C shows the XP spectra of 3.4V/In in the region of V 2p3/2 under similar consecutive treatments. The position of the maximal intensity barely changes, but the shape of the V 2p signal becomes less symmetric when C3H8 is present. This suggests the evolution of V4+ species under reaction conditions, especially in C3H8 alone."

[4] "To provide more information in the redox cycle of VOx and coordination environment of the catalysts, in situ XAS experiments were performed."

[5] "Figure 7A shows the V K edge XANES spectra of 3.4V/In as synthesized and after four sequential treatments including 2.5% CO2, 2.5% CO2 + 2.5% C3H8, 2.5% C3H8 (post reaction), and 2.5% CO2 (post reaction), with each treatment carried out at 500 °C for 30 min." 

[6] "The pre-edge peak of 3.4V/In after the treatment in C3H8/CO2 is at a lower energy than V(AcAc)3 and an intensity intermediate between V2O3 and V(AcAc)3, implying that vanadium has a local environment distinct from the octahedral or distorted octahedral symmetry of V(AcAc)3 or V2O3. The edge position that lies between the two V3+ references suggests that V is in the 3+ oxidation state."

[7] "Figure 7C,D shows the V K edge R space EXAFS of 3.4V/In after the same sequential treatments, along with the structural parameters in Table 2."

Answer: Yes, the article employs X-ray based techniques including NAP-XPS and XAS to probe oxidation state changes of vanadium during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. NAP-XPS revealed the evolution of V4+ species under reaction conditions. XANES identified the reduction of vanadium to V3+ under propane, while EXAFS provided insights into the coordination environments and bonding of vanadium with carbon species.

答:是的,该文采用基于X射线的技术,包括近ambient压X射线照电子能谱和X射线吸收光谱来探测脱氢反应过程中钒的氧化态变化。近ambient压X射线照电子能谱揭示了反应条件下V4+物种的演变。X射线吸收近边结构识别了钒在丙烷气氛下被还原至V3+,而扩展X射线吸收细微结构提供了钒与碳物种键合的配位环境和结合的见解。
