 Unfortunately this literature does not contain any relevant information to directly answer the questions asked. The article focuses on CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and does not provide background details on propane dehydrogenation in general. It does not discuss catalyst mechanisms, major catalyst classes explored, thermodynamic constraints, kinetics, DFT calculations, microkinetic modeling, or structure-activity relationships for propane dehydrogenation. The questions relate to propane dehydrogenation broadly, while the article is specifically about CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation using VOx/In2O3 catalysts.
