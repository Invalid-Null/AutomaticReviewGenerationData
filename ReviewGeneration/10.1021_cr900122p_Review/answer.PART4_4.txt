 Unfortunately, the given literature does not contain any relevant quotes or information to directly answer the questions asked. The article is a broad review of CH bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, but does not focus specifically on propane dehydrogenation or address the topics raised in the questions, such as process intensification, techno-economic analysis, safety issues, knowledge gaps, computational screening, characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation. Since the questions are quite specific, I cannot provide substantive answers based solely on the content of this review article. The general topic of the article is related, but the specific details needed to address the questions are not present.
