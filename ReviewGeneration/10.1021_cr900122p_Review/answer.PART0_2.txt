 Unfortunately, this literature review does not provide relevant information to answer the specific questions asked. The article focuses on CH bond activation and formation of organometallic intermediates on oxide surfaces for catalysis, but does not discuss propane dehydrogenation in detail or provide insights into catalyst design, kinetics, thermodynamics, descriptors, etc. for this specific reaction. While it touches on some catalytic dehydrogenation reactions in general, including propane dehydrogenation briefly, it does not go into the level of detail requested regarding propane dehydrogenation specifically.
