 Unfortunately the literature provided does not evaluate propane dehydrogenation catalysts or provide mechanistic insights specific to propane dehydrogenation. The article is a broad review focused more generally on CH bond activation of alkanes on metal oxides and other catalytic materials. I do not have relevant quotes or information to answer the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation.
