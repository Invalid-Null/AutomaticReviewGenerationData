 Based on my assessment, the provided answers do not contain information relevant to directly answering the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation. As the answers indicate, the literature review discusses general CH bond activation mechanisms in heterogeneous catalysis, but does not focus on propane dehydrogenation specifically or address the details requested in the questions. 

Therefore, I will respond as instructed:

"※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※"
