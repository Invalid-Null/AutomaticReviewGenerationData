 Unfortunately, there are no relevant quotes in the literature to answer the questions provided. The literature reviews CH bond activation of alkanes on oxide materials and related systems, but does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation mechanisms, kinetics, thermodynamics, catalyst design, or structure-activity relationships.

 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the literature provided that directly address the questions asked about propane dehydrogenation and propylene production. The article is focused on CH bond activation mechanisms on metal oxides, metal-exchanged zeolites, and supported organometallic complexes, but does not discuss propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since no relevant information is provided in the literature, I cannot provide substantive answers to the questions.

 Unfortunately, this literature review does not provide relevant information to answer the specific questions asked. The article focuses on CH bond activation and formation of organometallic intermediates on oxide surfaces for catalysis, but does not discuss propane dehydrogenation in detail or provide insights into catalyst design, kinetics, thermodynamics, descriptors, etc. for this specific reaction. While it touches on some catalytic dehydrogenation reactions in general, including propane dehydrogenation briefly, it does not go into the level of detail requested regarding propane dehydrogenation specifically.
