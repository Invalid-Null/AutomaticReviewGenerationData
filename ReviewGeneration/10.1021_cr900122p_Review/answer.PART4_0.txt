 Unfortunately this literature review does not discuss process intensification approaches, techno-economic factors, safety issues, remaining challenges, high-throughput methods, improved characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures specifically for propane dehydrogenation. The article focuses on reviewing fundamental mechanisms of CH bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis in general, not the application to propane dehydrogenation specifically.
