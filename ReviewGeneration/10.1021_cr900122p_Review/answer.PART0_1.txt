 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the literature provided that directly address the questions asked about propane dehydrogenation and propylene production. The article is focused on CH bond activation mechanisms on metal oxides, metal-exchanged zeolites, and supported organometallic complexes, but does not discuss propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since no relevant information is provided in the literature, I cannot provide substantive answers to the questions.
