 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that are directly related to evaluating metal oxide catalysts specifically for propane dehydrogenation. The literature provides a broad overview of CH bond activation and formation of organometallic intermediates on oxide materials, but does not go into detail on propane dehydrogenation performance over specific catalysts. Since the questions ask about propane dehydrogenation studies and results, I cannot provide direct quotes from the literature. Please let me know if you would still like me to attempt to summarize answers to the questions based on the general context of the literature review.
