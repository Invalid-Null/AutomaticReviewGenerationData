 Based on my assessment, the provided answers do not contain information directly relevant to the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation catalysts and mechanisms. While the literature covers CH bond activation broadly, it does not go into detail on propane dehydrogenation performance, structure-function relationships, or mechanistic pathways for the reaction over specific metal oxide or supported metal catalysts.

Therefore, I will respond with the indicated sentence:

※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※
