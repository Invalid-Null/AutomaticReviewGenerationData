 Unfortunately, this literature review does not provide any relevant quotes or discussion related to the questions asked. The article focuses on the fundamental chemistry and mechanisms of alkane and propane activation on metal oxides, but does not analyze process engineering, techno-economic factors, safety issues, remaining challenges, high-throughput methods, characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since there are no relevant quotes from the literature, I will summarize that none of these topics are addressed:
