 Unfortunately, the literature provided does not contain any relevant quotes or information to directly answer the specific questions asked. The article is a broad review of CH bond activation processes in heterogeneous catalysis, focusing on alkane activation on oxide materials, metal-exchanged zeolites and supported organometallic complexes. It does not go into depth on any specific propane dehydrogenation catalysts or provide details on catalyst synthesis, characterization or reactor studies for that reaction. The questions ask for specifics about propane dehydrogenation that are not discussed in this general review.

Since there are no relevant quotes from the literature, I cannot provide numbered quotes to the questions asked. Here are brief answers indicating that the questions cannot be directly answered from the information given:

1. The article does not specifically discuss techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It focuses more broadly on CH bond activation on various oxide materials.

2. The article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports. Propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability is not a major focus.

3. The article does not investigate specific catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It reviews work on various catalyst systems without going into preparation details.

4. The article does not utilize in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It is a broad literature review without original experimental work. 

5. The article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It does not focus on characterization of specific catalyst systems.

6. The article does not use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation. Again, no original experimental work is presented.

7. The article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation. It is focused entirely on catalyst composition and mechanisms rather than reactor design.

8. In summary, this broad literature review does not contain specific details relevant to the particular questions asked about propane dehydrogenation catalysts and reactors. It focuses on CH bond activation mechanisms on various oxide-based systems.
