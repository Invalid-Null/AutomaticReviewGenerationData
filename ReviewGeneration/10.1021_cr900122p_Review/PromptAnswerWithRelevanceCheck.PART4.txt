Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question’s section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<Answer>

 Unfortunately this literature review does not discuss process intensification approaches, techno-economic factors, safety issues, remaining challenges, high-throughput methods, improved characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures specifically for propane dehydrogenation. The article focuses on reviewing fundamental mechanisms of CH bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis in general, not the application to propane dehydrogenation specifically.

 Unfortunately this literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the provided questions about propane dehydrogenation. The article focuses on mechanisms of CH bond activation and alkane transformations on metal oxide surfaces, but does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation or the considerations raised in the questions. Since there are no relevant quotes or details provided, I cannot substantively answer the questions based on the given literature.

 Unfortunately, this literature review does not provide any relevant quotes or discussion related to the questions asked. The article focuses on the fundamental chemistry and mechanisms of alkane and propane activation on metal oxides, but does not analyze process engineering, techno-economic factors, safety issues, remaining challenges, high-throughput methods, characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since there are no relevant quotes from the literature, I will summarize that none of these topics are addressed:

 Unfortunately, the given literature does not contain any relevant quotes or information to directly answer the questions asked. The article is a broad review of CH bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, but does not focus specifically on propane dehydrogenation or address the topics raised in the questions, such as process intensification, techno-economic analysis, safety issues, knowledge gaps, computational screening, characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation. Since the questions are quite specific, I cannot provide substantive answers based solely on the content of this review article. The general topic of the article is related, but the specific details needed to address the questions are not present.
