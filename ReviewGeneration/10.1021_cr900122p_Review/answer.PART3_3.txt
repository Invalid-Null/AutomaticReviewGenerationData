 Unfortunately, the literature provided does not contain any relevant quotes or information to directly answer the specific questions asked. The article is a broad review of CH bond activation processes in heterogeneous catalysis, focusing on alkane activation on oxide materials, metal-exchanged zeolites and supported organometallic complexes. It does not go into depth on any specific propane dehydrogenation catalysts or provide details on catalyst synthesis, characterization or reactor studies for that reaction. The questions ask for specifics about propane dehydrogenation that are not discussed in this general review.

Since there are no relevant quotes from the literature, I cannot provide numbered quotes to the questions asked. Here are brief answers indicating that the questions cannot be directly answered from the information given:

<English version answer>

1. The article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports.

2. The article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability.  

3. The article does not investigate catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion.

4. The article does not utilize in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

5. The article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts.  

6. The article does not use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis.

7. The article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.
