 Unfortunately the literature provided does not directly evaluate specific metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation or provide mechanistic details and structure-function relationships for supported metal catalysts. I do not have sufficient information from the literature to provide direct answers to the specific questions asked. Since the questions cannot be adequately answered based on the given literature, I will not attempt to provide speculative responses. Please let me know if you would like me to elaborate further on any aspects of the literature that may be relevant.
