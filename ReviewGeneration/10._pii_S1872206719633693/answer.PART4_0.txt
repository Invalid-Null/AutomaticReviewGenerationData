 Unfortunately this literature does not contain relevant information to answer the provided questions. The article focuses on catalysis for propane dehydrogenation but does not discuss process intensification approaches, techno-economic factors, safety issues, remaining challenges and knowledge gaps, computational catalyst screening methods, improved characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures. Since there are no relevant quotes, I will respond "No relevant quotes" for each question below:
