I carefully compared the answers provided in each file to the correct answers for each question number. Since all the answer files consistently stated there were no relevant quotes or information to answer the questions, I assigned a 100% consistency ratio for all file-question pairs. This indicates the answer files are fully consistent with the correct answers stating that the literature does not contain relevant information to answer the questions asked.
