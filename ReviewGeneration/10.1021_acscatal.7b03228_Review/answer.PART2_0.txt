<quotes>
[1] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, (10) a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."

[2] "For example, Norskov and co-workers have shown that the binding energies of CO and HCO are correlated in CO2 reduction, which limits one to a single correlative relationship in reactivity. (11) Even moving to systems with chemical intermediates of a different nature such as HCN synthesis, Grabow and co-workers found that reactivity could be described by scaling relationships of N and C binding to the surface."  

[3] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It points out that while electronic modification can affect catalysis positively, it often affects reactants and products similarly, limiting improvements. Geometric effects like changing the bonding configuration of the adsorbate are needed to break from these limitations.
