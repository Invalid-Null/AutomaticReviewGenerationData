<quotes>
[1] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, (10) a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."

[2] "For example, Norskov and co-workers have shown that the binding energies of CO and HCO are correlated in CO2 reduction, which limits one to a single correlative relationship in reactivity. (11) Even moving to systems with chemical intermediates of a different nature such as HCN synthesis, Grabow and co-workers found that reactivity could be described by scaling relationships of N and C binding to the surface."  

[3] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It points out that while electronic modification can affect catalysis positively, it often affects reactants and products similarly, limiting improvements. Geometric effects like changing the bonding configuration of the adsorbate are needed to break from these limitations.

<quotes>

[1] "Once the perturbation of the d-band due to alloying is known, the adsorption behavior of alloys (to a first approximation) can be described by average d-band filling of the metal atoms in contact with the adsorbate."

[2] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."

[3] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It provides examples such as PtSn alloys where the secondary Sn metal perturbs the d-band center of Pt, altering adsorbate binding strengths. But it notes electronic effects have limits in improving selectivity. So it highlights the importance of geometric effects like changing ensemble sizes and adsorption configurations to improve selectivity beyond what's possible by electronic effects alone.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

3. 答:是的,文章研究了双金属和合金催化剂中次要金属的电子效应和几何效应。它给出了PtSn合金的例子,其中Sn金属扰动了Pt的d带中心,改变了吸附物的结合强度。但它指出电子效应在提高选择性方面存在局限性。所以它强调了改变配位体组和吸附配置等几何效应对于进一步改善选择性的重要性,这超出了仅仅依靠电子效应所能达到的效果。
