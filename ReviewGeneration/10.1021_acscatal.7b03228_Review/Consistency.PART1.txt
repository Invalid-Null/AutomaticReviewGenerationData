I carefully compared each answer file's responses to the correct answers provided for each question. Since all the answer files indicate that the literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the questions, I assessed them all as being 100% consistent with the correct answers stating that no examples, data, insights, etc. were provided. Please let me know if I have misunderstood anything or if you would like me to modify the comparison in any way.
