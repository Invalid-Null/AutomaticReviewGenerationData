<Answer>

 Unfortunately this literature does not contain any information relevant to the questions asked. The article is about catalysis by doped metal oxides, whereas the questions are about propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Since there are no relevant quotes from the literature, I will respond "No relevant quotes" to each question.
