 Unfortunately this literature review does not contain information to answer the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation. The review focuses on doped metal oxide catalysts for alkane oxidation reactions, and does not discuss propane dehydrogenation in detail. Since the questions are not addressed in the given text, I cannot provide relevant quotes or answers.
