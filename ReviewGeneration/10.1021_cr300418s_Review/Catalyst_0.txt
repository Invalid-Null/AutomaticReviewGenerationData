 Based on reviewing the document, this does not appear to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses heterogeneous catalysis and doped metal oxides, but does not focus specifically on propane dehydrogenation. Since the document is not relevant, I will not enumerate any catalysts or main contributions.
