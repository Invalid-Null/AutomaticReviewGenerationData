 Unfortunately the given literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the specific questions about propane dehydrogenation. The article is focused on catalysis by doped metal oxides, and does not discuss propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since there is no relevant content in the literature, I cannot provide any quotes or answers to the questions.
