 Based on reviewing the document, I do not believe it is directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses heterogeneous catalysis involving metal oxides, but does not specifically focus on propane dehydrogenation. Since the document does not seem directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation, I will not enumerate the catalysts or attempt to identify the main contribution.
