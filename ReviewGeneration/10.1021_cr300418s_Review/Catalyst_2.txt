 Based on reviewing the document, I do not believe it is directly related to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses heterogeneous catalysis by doped metal oxides in general, but does not focus specifically on propane dehydrogenation. Since the document does not seem relevant to propane dehydrogenation, I will not enumerate the catalysts or attempt to identify the main contribution.
