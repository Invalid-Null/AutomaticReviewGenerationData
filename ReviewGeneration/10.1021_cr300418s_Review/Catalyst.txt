 Based on my review, this document does not appear to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses heterogeneous catalysis by doped metal oxides in general, but does not focus specifically on propane dehydrogenation. Since propane dehydrogenation is not a major focus, I will leave the catalyst details blank.
