[1] "Nevertheless, the PdIn alloy catalyst does undergo modest deactivation during time-on-stream experiments, (15,35) and, given the low adsorbate coverages, this deactivation cannot be attributed to the deeply dehydrogenated species blocking the active sites. We, therefore, hypothesize that sintering, as opposed to site blocking and coking, may be the dominant mechanism responsible for the initially measured deactivation on PdIn alloy catalysts."

[2] "To test whether sintering plays a significant role, the PdIn catalyst was exposed to propane dehydrogenation reaction conditions for 24 h and then imaged by TEM. The average particle size increased from 2 nm (15) to 7 nm, which corresponds to a loss of approximately 50% total surface area of the nanoparticles (Figure S13). This result suggests that nanoparticle sintering may be a dominant mechanism of the initial deactivation for the PdIn intermetallic catalyst."

4. The article does summarize remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it identifies that PdIn alloy catalysts still undergo modest deactivation during time-on-stream experiments, even though deep dehydrogenation species do not seem to be blocking active sites at significant coverages based on the modeling. The authors hypothesize that sintering of nanoparticles, rather than site blocking or coking, may be responsible for the initial deactivation observed experimentally for PdIn alloys. They provide experimental TEM imaging showing that the PdIn catalyst nanoparticles grow from 2 nm to 7 nm after 24 hours under reaction conditions, corresponding to ~50% loss of surface area. This suggests sintering is a dominant deactivation mechanism initially for PdIn catalysts.

4. 该文确实概括了丙烷脱氢催化中剩余的挑战和知识空白。具体而言,它指出即使根据建模深度脱氢物种的覆盖率并不高,PdIn合金催化剂在反应过程中仍出现适度的失活。作者推测纳米粒子烧结,而不是位阻或焦炭化,可能是导致PdIn合金的初始失活的原因。他们提供了TEM成像实验结果,显示在反应条件下24小时后,PdIn催化剂纳米粒子从2 nm增长至7 nm,对应着约50%的表面积损失。这表明烧结是PdIn催化剂初始失活的主要机制。

<quotes>
[1] "Nevertheless, the endothermic nature of propane to propylene conversion necessitates the use of high temperatures which ultimately leads to deep dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis (CC bond breaking), and coke formation."

[2] "Improvements are still needed."

[3] "Recent increases in shale gas production have led to shifts in steam cracking feeds from naphtha to ethane, resulting in abundant ethylene production. (1) However, propylene, which is a side product of naphtha steam cracking, is produced to a far lesser extent during the ethane steam cracking process. (2) Interest in on-purpose production of propylene has, therefore, increased significantly,"

[4] "the selectivity toward propylene increases if the ratio of rh/rb decreases. To gain more insights into the specific kinetic and thermodynamic parameters that most impact the selectivity, we substitute the rate expressions for rb and rh (eqs S29 and S40), which are written in terms of forward rates multiplied by 1 minus the approaches to equilibrium for propylene (Z) and byproduct formation (Q). Since the conversions under investigation ( 20%) are far lower than equilibrium conversions (95%) at these conditions, the approaches to equilibrium are considerably less than unity (Z, Q  1). Neglecting these contributions leads to the ratio of equilibrium and rate constants, as shown in eq 7. The denominator in eq 7 corresponds to an effective barrier for the lumped reaction step of gas phase propane being converted to the transition state for CH bond breaking of propane* to form 1-propyl* + hydrogen*, termed as Geffb (Figure 14). The numerator, on the other hand, can be interpreted in terms of an effective barrier for the lumped reaction step of gas phase propylene conversion to the transition state of CC bond breaking of propyne (CH3CCH*) to form ethynyl (CCH*) and methyl (CH3*), termed as Geffh."

Answer: The article summarizes some remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It notes that the endothermic nature of the reaction requires high temperatures, which can lead to deep dehydrogenation, CC bond breaking, and coke formation. The article states that improvements in selectivity are still needed. It also notes an increased interest in on-purpose propylene production due to shifts in steam cracking feeds. The article provides an analysis of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters that impact selectivity, such as the rates of CC bond breaking in propyne vs CH bond breaking in propane. This analysis provides insights into how to improve selectivity by modifying these parameters. Overall, key challenges identified include avoiding deep dehydrogenation and coking while maintaining high selectivity toward propylene.

答案:这篇文章总结了丙烷脱氢反应催化剂所面临的一些剩余挑战和知识缺口。它指出反应的内吸热性质需要高温,这可能导致深度脱氢、CC键断裂和焦炭生成。文章说选择性方面的改进仍然是需要的。它也提到由于蒸汽裂解原料的改变,对丙烯的专用生产에兴趣增加了。文章分析了影响选择性的关键动力学和热力学参数,如丙炔的CC键断裂速率与丙烷的CH键断裂速率。这种分析提供了改进选择性的见解,即通过调节这些参数。总体来说,识别出的关键挑战包括避免深度脱氢和焦炭生成,同时保持对丙烯的高选择性。
