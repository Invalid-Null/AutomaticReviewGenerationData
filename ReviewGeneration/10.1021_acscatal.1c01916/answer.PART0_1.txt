[1]Recent increases in shale gas production have led to shifts in steam cracking feeds from naphtha to ethane, resulting in abundant ethylene production. (1) However, propylene, which is a side product of naphtha steam cracking, is produced to a far lesser extent during the ethane steam cracking process. (2) Interest in on-purpose production of propylene has, therefore, increased significantly, (3) with nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) being a promising strategy. (2)

1. Yes. The article provides background on the importance of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation by stating that the shift to ethane cracking has reduced propylene production as a byproduct, leading to increased interest in on-purpose propylene production through propane dehydrogenation. It explains that propylene is an important product used in the chemical industry, and that propane dehydrogenation is a promising strategy for on-purpose propylene production.
