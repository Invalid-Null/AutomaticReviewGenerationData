To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key content points between each answer file and the correct answers. If the answers contained the same main points, I marked it as 100% consistent. If the answers were completely different or unrelated, I marked it as 0% consistent. There are likely some borderline cases that could be open to interpretation in terms of an exact percentage. But overall this provides a high-level comparative analysis of the consistency across answers.
