```

To generate this, I compared each answer file's English response for each question to the correct English answer provided. I calculated a consistency percentage based on the content overlapping between the two answers. 100% indicates the answers contained the same relevant information, while 0% indicates completely inconsistent or missing information. For question 5, answer.PART0_4.txt had some but not all of the key details from the correct answer, so I assigned it 50% consistency.
