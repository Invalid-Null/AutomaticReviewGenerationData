[1] "Nevertheless, the PdIn alloy catalyst does undergo modest deactivation during time-on-stream experiments, (15,35) and, given the low adsorbate coverages, this deactivation cannot be attributed to the deeply dehydrogenated species blocking the active sites. We, therefore, hypothesize that sintering, as opposed to site blocking and coking, may be the dominant mechanism responsible for the initially measured deactivation on PdIn alloy catalysts."

[2] "To test whether sintering plays a significant role, the PdIn catalyst was exposed to propane dehydrogenation reaction conditions for 24 h and then imaged by TEM. The average particle size increased from 2 nm (15) to 7 nm, which corresponds to a loss of approximately 50% total surface area of the nanoparticles (Figure S13). This result suggests that nanoparticle sintering may be a dominant mechanism of the initial deactivation for the PdIn intermetallic catalyst."

4. The article does summarize remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it identifies that PdIn alloy catalysts still undergo modest deactivation during time-on-stream experiments, even though deep dehydrogenation species do not seem to be blocking active sites at significant coverages based on the modeling. The authors hypothesize that sintering of nanoparticles, rather than site blocking or coking, may be responsible for the initial deactivation observed experimentally for PdIn alloys. They provide experimental TEM imaging showing that the PdIn catalyst nanoparticles grow from 2 nm to 7 nm after 24 hours under reaction conditions, corresponding to ~50% loss of surface area. This suggests sintering is a dominant deactivation mechanism initially for PdIn catalysts.

4. 该文确实概括了丙烷脱氢催化中剩余的挑战和知识空白。具体而言,它指出即使根据建模深度脱氢物种的覆盖率并不高,PdIn合金催化剂在反应过程中仍出现适度的失活。作者推测纳米粒子烧结,而不是位阻或焦炭化,可能是导致PdIn合金的初始失活的原因。他们提供了TEM成像实验结果,显示在反应条件下24小时后,PdIn催化剂纳米粒子从2 nm增长至7 nm,对应着约50%的表面积损失。这表明烧结是PdIn催化剂初始失活的主要机制。
