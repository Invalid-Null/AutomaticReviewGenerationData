[1] Density functional theory (DFT)-based studies have analyzed ethane (2025) and propane dehydrogenation (2634) selectivity trends across pure Pt and Pt alloys. 

[2] Computational studies of PDH have considered Pt and industrially used Pt3Sn alloys, (2629) wherein the difference between the propylene binding energy and the propylene CH bond activation barrier was introduced as a selectivity descriptor to evaluate the relative rates of propylene desorption compared to unselective deep dehydrogenation. (27,28) 

[3] More recently, in-depth microkinetic studies on Pt surfaces concluded that the initial CH bond activation step in propane, CH bond activation in propylene, (30,34) and CC bond breaking in propyne (CH3CCH*) (30) are kinetically relevant steps in PDH.

[1] Gong and co-workers (31) have also carried out a trends-based study of PDH chemistry across a series of Pt3X(111) alloy surfaces. 

[2] By evaluating the first dehydrogenation barrier of propane, which was used as a proxy for PDH activity, in addition to a selectivity descriptor comparing the desorption and dehydrogenation barriers of propylene, the authors demonstrated that there exists a negative correlation between these activity and selectivity descriptors and that Pt3In represents a useful trade-off between these two reactivity measures.
