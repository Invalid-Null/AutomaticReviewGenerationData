<quotes>

[1] Density functional theory (DFT)-based studies have analyzed ethane (2025) and propane dehydrogenation (2634) selectivity trends across pure Pt and Pt alloys. 

[2] Computational studies of PDH have considered Pt and industrially used Pt3Sn alloys, (2629) wherein the difference between the propylene binding energy and the propylene CH bond activation barrier was introduced as a selectivity descriptor to evaluate the relative rates of propylene desorption compared to unselective deep dehydrogenation. (27,28) 

[3] More recently, in-depth microkinetic studies on Pt surfaces concluded that the initial CH bond activation step in propane, CH bond activation in propylene, (30,34) and CC bond breaking in propyne (CH3CCH*) (30) are kinetically relevant steps in PDH.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

5. The article describes how DFT calculations have been applied to analyze ethane and propane dehydrogenation selectivity trends across Pt and Pt alloys, develop a selectivity descriptor comparing propylene binding energy and dehydrogenation barrier, and identify through microkinetic studies that propane CH activation, propylene CH activation, and propyne CC bond breaking are kinetically relevant in propane dehydrogenation.

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] Gong and co-workers (31) have also carried out a trends-based study of PDH chemistry across a series of Pt3X(111) alloy surfaces. 

[2] By evaluating the first dehydrogenation barrier of propane, which was used as a proxy for PDH activity, in addition to a selectivity descriptor comparing the desorption and dehydrogenation barriers of propylene, the authors demonstrated that there exists a negative correlation between these activity and selectivity descriptors and that Pt3In represents a useful trade-off between these two reactivity measures.

</quotes>

<English version answer> 

6.

 <quotes>
[1]Recent increases in shale gas production have led to shifts in steam cracking feeds from naphtha to ethane, resulting in abundant ethylene production. (1) However, propylene, which is a side product of naphtha steam cracking, is produced to a far lesser extent during the ethane steam cracking process. (2) Interest in on-purpose production of propylene has, therefore, increased significantly, (3) with nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) being a promising strategy. (2)
</quotes>

<English version answer>
1. Yes. The article provides background on the importance of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation by stating that the shift to ethane cracking has reduced propylene production as a byproduct, leading to increased interest in on-purpose propylene production through propane dehydrogenation. It explains that propylene is an important product used in the chemical industry, and that propane dehydrogenation is a promising strategy for on-purpose propylene production.
