[1] "Recent increases in shale gas production have led to shifts in steam cracking feeds from naphtha to ethane, resulting in abundant ethylene production."
[2] "However, propylene, which is a side product of naphtha steam cracking, is produced to a far lesser extent during the ethane steam cracking process."  
[3] "Interest in on-purpose production of propylene has, therefore, increased significantly, with nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) being a promising strategy."

Answer: The article does investigate electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. Specifically, it analyzes a 1:1 alloy of PdIn and finds that Pd-terminated step edges are the most active sites, with rates 5 orders of magnitude higher than on PdIn terraces. This is attributed to the secondary In metal weakening binding energies of intermediates compared to pure Pd, which changes preferred adsorption sites and decreases kinetic barriers.

答:该文章确实研究了双金属和合金催化剂中辅助金属的电子和几何效应。具体来说,它分析了1:1的PdIn合金,发现Pd终止的台阶边缘是最活跃的位点,反应速率比PdIn台阶面高5个数量级。这归因于第二金属In削弱了中间体的结合能,与纯Pd相比改变了优先吸附位点并降低了动力学屏障。

[1] "Adsorption of all intermediates in the PDH reaction network is found to be weaker on the PdIn(110) terrace as compared to the Pd(111) terrace."
[2] "To provide an electronic structure interpretation of the weakened binding energies for intermediates on the PdIn alloys, as compared to pure Pd, we perform a density of states analysis (Figure S7). The results indicate that the d-band center shifts downward in energy by 0.6 eV for Pd atoms on the PdIn surfaces compared to the Pd surfaces."
[3] "These trends are in agreement with the generally accepted theory that, as the d-band center moves to the left of the Fermi level, the binding energies of intermediates become weaker."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article does describe synergistic effects between metals in bimetallic or alloy catalysts, attributed to ensemble and ligand effects. Specifically, it shows that the d-band center of Pd shifts downward in energy when alloyed with In, which weakens binding of intermediates according to the d-band theory. This synergistic electronic effect leads to weaker binding energies on the PdIn alloy compared to pure Pd.

答:该文章确实描述了双金属或合金催化剂中金属之间的协同效应,这归因于集团和配体效应。具体来说,它表明当Pd与In形成合金时,Pd的d带中心向低能量方向移动,这根据d带理论削弱了中间体的结合。这种协同电子效应导致PdIn合金上的结合能较纯Pd弱。
