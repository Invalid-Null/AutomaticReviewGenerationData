[1] "Nevertheless, the endothermic nature of propane to propylene conversion necessitates the use of high temperatures which ultimately leads to deep dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis (CC bond breaking), and coke formation."

[2] "Improvements are still needed."

[3] "Recent increases in shale gas production have led to shifts in steam cracking feeds from naphtha to ethane, resulting in abundant ethylene production. (1) However, propylene, which is a side product of naphtha steam cracking, is produced to a far lesser extent during the ethane steam cracking process. (2) Interest in on-purpose production of propylene has, therefore, increased significantly,"

[4] "the selectivity toward propylene increases if the ratio of rh/rb decreases. To gain more insights into the specific kinetic and thermodynamic parameters that most impact the selectivity, we substitute the rate expressions for rb and rh (eqs S29 and S40), which are written in terms of forward rates multiplied by 1 minus the approaches to equilibrium for propylene (Z) and byproduct formation (Q). Since the conversions under investigation ( 20%) are far lower than equilibrium conversions (95%) at these conditions, the approaches to equilibrium are considerably less than unity (Z, Q  1). Neglecting these contributions leads to the ratio of equilibrium and rate constants, as shown in eq 7. The denominator in eq 7 corresponds to an effective barrier for the lumped reaction step of gas phase propane being converted to the transition state for CH bond breaking of propane* to form 1-propyl* + hydrogen*, termed as Geffb (Figure 14). The numerator, on the other hand, can be interpreted in terms of an effective barrier for the lumped reaction step of gas phase propylene conversion to the transition state of CC bond breaking of propyne (CH3CCH*) to form ethynyl (CCH*) and methyl (CH3*), termed as Geffh."

Answer: The article summarizes some remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It notes that the endothermic nature of the reaction requires high temperatures, which can lead to deep dehydrogenation, CC bond breaking, and coke formation. The article states that improvements in selectivity are still needed. It also notes an increased interest in on-purpose propylene production due to shifts in steam cracking feeds. The article provides an analysis of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters that impact selectivity, such as the rates of CC bond breaking in propyne vs CH bond breaking in propane. This analysis provides insights into how to improve selectivity by modifying these parameters. Overall, key challenges identified include avoiding deep dehydrogenation and coking while maintaining high selectivity toward propylene.
