[1] Meanwhile, Sun and co-workers developed ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method to encage PtZn clusters around the 5- and 6-membered rings (MRs) of zeolites. (10) Both catalysts showed high specific activity (3.5 and 3.55 molC3H6 molPt1 s1 s1) and excellent long-term stability at high temperature.

[2] In this work, we first confirmed the trade-off effect between the configuration diffusion length and surface diffusion by preparing PtZn clusters encapsulated in bulk zeolites with different crystal sizes. 

[3] The novel finned structure of the zeolite for encapsulating metal species offers an opportunity to break the tradeoff effect. PtZn@S-1-Fin possessed some fins (3060 nm) growing epitaxially on the surface of zeolite seeds. 

[4] On catalysis by PtZn@S-1-Fin, a highly productive PDH of up to 17.0 molC3H6 molPt1 s1 (WHSV = 360 h1) and a low deactivation constant of 0.0017 h1 (WHSV = 12 h1) were achieved.

2. Yes, the article evaluates PtZn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing PtZn clusters encapsulated in zeolites achieve high specific activity of 3.5-3.55 molC3H6/molPt/s and 17.0 molC3H6/molPt/s for the finned zeolite catalyst PtZn@S-1-Fin. The finned zeolite structure enhances performance by improving diffusion limitations.

[1] Pt-based catalysts are widely applied in industrial PDH processes due to their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and the limited extent of CC bond cleavage. On the basis of the reversible, highly endothermic, and structure-insensitive characteristics, it is favorable to maintain high Pt dispersion on a sub-nanometric scale at a high reaction temperature.

[2] Zeolites, with a rigid microporous framework and high thermal stability, are considered as ideal supports to anchor sub-nanometric metal species. (57) 

[3] Regioselective encapsulation contributes to a special structure with a core of a sub-nanometric Pt cluster and a shell of single-site Snδ+/Zn2+. This structure ensures that CC bond cleavage is shut down with no or minimal loss of the dehydrogenation activity. On these highly active catalysts, internal diffusion easily becomes the rate-limiting step. The encapsulated species in bulk zeolites often suffer from poor availability caused by small micropore size and long diffusion length.

6. Yes, the article evaluates zeolite supports like MFI for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It states zeolites are ideal supports to anchor sub-nanometric Pt species due to their rigid microporous framework and high thermal stability. The regioselective encapsulation of PtZn clusters in the zeolite contributes to high activity but diffusion limitations become rate-limiting.
