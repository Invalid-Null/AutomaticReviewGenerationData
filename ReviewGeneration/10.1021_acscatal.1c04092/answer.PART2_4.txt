<quotes>
[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely applied in industrial PDH processes due to their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and the limited extent of CC bond cleavage."

[2] "Zeolites, with a rigid microporous framework and high thermal stability, are considered as ideal supports to anchor sub-nanometric metal species."

[3] "PtZn clusters were fixed in zeolites with a sub-nanometric scale (<1 nm) and templates were eliminated, as evidenced by Raman spectra (Figure S1)."

[4] "After direct H2 reduction, PtZn clusters were fixed in zeolites with a sub-nanometric scale (<1 nm) and templates were eliminated, as evidenced by Raman spectra (Figure S1)."

20. Yes, the article evaluates the use of MFI zeolite structures as supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It states that zeolites like MFI are ideal supports to anchor sub-nanometric Pt-based metal species due to their rigid microporous framework and high thermal stability. The article prepared PtZn clusters fixed in MFI zeolites with sub-nanometric size less than 1 nm after direct H2 reduction and template elimination.

20. 是的,这篇文章评价了使用MFI沸石结构作为丙烷脱氢催化剂的载体。它指出,像MFI这样的沸石由于其刚性微孔框架和高热稳定性,是固定子纳米级Pt基金属的理想载体。这篇文章制备了在MFI沸石中固定的PtZn簇,在直接H2还原和模板消除后,其大小低于1纳米。
