<quotes>
[1] Metal clusters encapsulated in zeolites have attracted increasing attention because of their unique electronic properties with high stability, but diffusion limitation is the bottleneck in the utilization efficiency of active sites, especially in bulk crystals. 
[2] Regioselective encapsulation contributes to a special structure with a core of a sub-nanometric Pt cluster and a shell of single-site Snδ+/Zn2+. This structure ensures that CC bond cleavage is shut down with no or minimal loss of the dehydrogenation activity.

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides examples of encapsulating PtZn clusters in zeolites, which helps stabilize the metal clusters and prevent carbon-carbon bond cleavage during catalysis. This improves stability compared to unsupported metal clusters.

[1] Nanosized zeolites could effectively improve mass transport by shortening the diffusion length. 
[2] Construction of a hierarchical zeolite structure also faces this problem. It is a challenge to design a novel topological zeolite structure to promote configuration diffusion and surface diffusion simultaneously.
[3] PtZn@S-1-Fin possessed some fins (30-60 nm) growing epitaxially on the surface of zeolite seeds.
