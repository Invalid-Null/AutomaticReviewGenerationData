<quotes>

[1] "Regioselective encapsulation contributes to a special structure with a core of a sub-nanometric Pt cluster and a shell of single-site Snδ+/Zn2+. This structure ensures that CC bond cleavage is shut down with no or minimal loss of the dehydrogenation activity."

[2] "The encapsulated species in bulk zeolites often suffer from poor availability caused by small micropore size and long diffusion length."

[3] "Nanosized zeolites, with reduced internal diffusion length, are commonly applied to improve the utilization efficiency." 

[4] "Nevertheless, a zeolite crystal size below 100 nm often suffers from low crystallinity and a rough surface, which lead to a high surface barrier that hinders the surface diffusion process."

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides examples of regioselective encapsulation of PtZn clusters in zeolites, which helps stabilize sub-nanometric Pt while avoiding carbon-carbon bond cleavage. However, encapsulation in bulk zeolites leads to poor availability, while encapsulation in nanosized zeolites results in low crystallinity and surface barriers.

2. 是的,该文评估了在分子筛载体中的金属封装,以提高丙烷脱氢催化剂的稳定性。它提供了在分子筛中选择性封装PtZn簇的示例,这有助于稳定亚纳米Pt同时避免碳碳键断裂。然而,在块状分子筛中的封装导致可利用性差,而在纳米级分子筛中的封装会导致低结晶性和表面阻隔。

[2] "Nevertheless, a zeolite crystal size below 100 nm often suffers from low crystallinity and a rough surface, which lead to a high surface barrier that hinders the surface diffusion process." 

[3] "Recently, Rimer et al. developed finned MEL and MFI zeolites to enhance the mass-transport properties by the epitaxial growth of fin-like protrusions on seed crystals."

[4] "Furthermore, a metal encapsulated in a small and epitaxial highly crystallized zeolite may realize highly productive PDH."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using nanosized zeolites to reduce diffusion length and improve utilization efficiency. However, nanosized zeolites below 100 nm result in low crystallinity and surface barriers. Instead, the article develops finned zeolites with epitaxial fin-like protrusions to enhance mass transport while maintaining crystallinity.

[1] "Tomographic section images in Figure 2c,f provide direct proof that PtZn clusters were fixed in the zeolites (Figure S5)." 

[2] "The average sizes of PtZn clusters were 0.92 and 0.91 nm for PtZn@S-1-200 and PtZn@S-1-Fin, respectively."

[3] "These correspond to no characteristic Pt peak in enlarged XRD patterns (Figure S6)."

[4] "Nevertheless, the average particle size of PtZn@S-1-100 was 1.55 nm with a bimodal distribution (Figure 2i)."

5. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides tomographic section images showing PtZn clusters fixed in the zeolites with sizes around 0.9 nm. Enlarged XRD patterns confirm no characteristic Pt peaks. However, PtZn@S-1-100 shows some agglomeration with an average size of 1.55 nm.
