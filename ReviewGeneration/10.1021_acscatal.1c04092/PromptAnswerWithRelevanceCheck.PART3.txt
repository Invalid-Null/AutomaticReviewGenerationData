<quotes>

[1] "Regioselective encapsulation contributes to a special structure with a core of a sub-nanometric Pt cluster and a shell of single-site Snδ+/Zn2+. This structure ensures that CC bond cleavage is shut down with no or minimal loss of the dehydrogenation activity."

[2] "The encapsulated species in bulk zeolites often suffer from poor availability caused by small micropore size and long diffusion length."

[3] "Nanosized zeolites, with reduced internal diffusion length, are commonly applied to improve the utilization efficiency." 

[4] "Nevertheless, a zeolite crystal size below 100 nm often suffers from low crystallinity and a rough surface, which lead to a high surface barrier that hinders the surface diffusion process."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
