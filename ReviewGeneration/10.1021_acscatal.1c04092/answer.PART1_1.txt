[1] "PtZn@S-1-Fin exhibited a high activity of 17.0 molC3H6 molPt1 s1 at 600 C, which was about 1.7 times higher than that of PtZn confined in a nanosized zeolite."

[2] "Propane conversions of all catalysts were about 49% (near thermodynamic equilibrium) when the WHSV was less than 60 h1."

[3] "The PtZn@S-1-Fin catalyst exhibited a high activity of 17.0 molC3H6 molPt1 s1, which was about 1.5 and 1.7 times higher than those of PtZn@S-1-200 and PtZn@S-1-100, respectively."

[4] "After 80 h on stream, the propane conversion of PtZn@S-1-Fin was maintained at 45.0% while that of PtZn@S-1-200 was only 34.4%."

Answer: The article evaluates supported PtZn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing PtZn@S-1-Fin had a high activity of 17.0 molC3H6 molPt-1 s-1 at 600 C, 1.7 times higher than PtZn in nanosized zeolite. All catalysts gave ~49% propane conversion at WHSV <60 h-1. After 80 hours, PtZn@S-1-Fin maintained 45.0% conversion while PtZn@S-1-200 had only 34.4%.
