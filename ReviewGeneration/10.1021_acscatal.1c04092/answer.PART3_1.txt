[1] Regioselective encapsulation contributes to a special structure with a core of a sub-nanometric Pt cluster and a shell of single-site Snδ+/Zn2+. This structure ensures that CC bond cleavage is shut down with no or minimal loss of the dehydrogenation activity.

[2] The encapsulated species in bulk zeolites often suffer from poor availability caused by small micropore size and long diffusion length. 

[3] In comparison, the propane conversion of PtZn@S-1-Fin was maintained at 45.0% while that of PtZn@S-1-200 was only 34.4%. The propene selectivity of PtZn@S-1-Fin was 97.4%, slightly higher than that of PtZn@S-1-200 (96.7%).

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides examples of regioselectively encapsulating PtZn clusters in zeolites, which helps maintain high propene selectivity and conversion after long-term reaction compared to PtZn in bulk zeolites.

[1] Nanosized zeolites, with reduced internal diffusion length, are commonly applied to improve the utilization efficiency.

[2] PtZn@S-1-Fin possessed some fins (30−60 nm) growing epitaxially on the surface of zeolite seeds. 

[3] On catalysis by PtZn@S-1-Fin, a highly productive PDH of up to 17.0 molC3H6 molPt−1 s−1 (WHSV = 360 h−1) and a low deactivation constant of 0.0017 h−1 (WHSV = 12 h−1) were achieved.

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like synthesizing nanosized zeolites to shorten diffusion length and growing epitaxial fins on zeolite seeds to encapsulate PtZn clusters. This led to improved propane dehydrogenation activity and stability with PtZn@S-1-Fin.

[1] Tomographic section images in Figure 2c,f provide direct proof that PtZn clusters were fixed in the zeolites.

[2] The average sizes of PtZn clusters were 0.92 and 0.91 nm for PtZn@S-1-200 and PtZn@S-1-Fin, respectively. 

[3] PtZn@S-1-100 exhibited coarse external surfaces and ill-defined external shapes, as shown in Figure 2g,h.
