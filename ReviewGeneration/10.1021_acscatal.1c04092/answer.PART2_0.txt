[1] "In particular, the concept of regioselective encapsulation was proposed with the development of a synthetic strategy, which could stabilize Pt sites of less than 1 nm. (8) Liu and co-workers introduced a controllable amount of K+ to stabilize PtSn clusters in sinusoidal channels. (9) Meanwhile, Sun and co-workers developed ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method to encage PtZn clusters around the 5- and 6-membered rings (MRs) of zeolites. (10) Both catalysts showed high specific activity (3.5 and 3.55 molC3H6 molPt1 s1 s1) and excellent long-term stability at high temperature."

[2] "Regioselective encapsulation contributes to a special structure with a core of a sub-nanometric Pt cluster and a shell of single-site Snδ+/Zn2+. This structure ensures that CC bond cleavage is shut down with no or minimal loss of the dehydrogenation activity."

[3] "Figure 2 displays the zeolite morphology and metal distribution of PtZn@S-1-200, PtZn@S-1-Fin and PtZn@S-1-100 after reduction at 550 C. PtZn@S-1-200 exhibited a typical hexagonal crystal (Figure 2a,b) In comparison, PtZn@S-1-Fin possessed many fins with a size of 3060 nm formed on the surface of zeolite seeds. PtZn@S-1-100 exhibited coarse external surfaces and ill-defined external shapes, as shown in Figure 2g,h. Tomographic section images in Figure 2c,f provide direct proof that PtZn clusters were fixed in the zeolites (Figure S5). The average sizes of PtZn clusters were 0.92 and 0.91 nm for PtZn@S-1-200 and PtZn@S-1-Fin, respectively. These correspond to no characteristic Pt peak in enlarged XRD patterns (Figure S6)."

6. Yes, the article evaluates PtZn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing PtZn clusters with sub-nanometric size (0.91-0.92 nm) encapsulated in zeolites through regioselective synthesis methods, which exhibit high specific activity of 3.5-3.55 molC3H6/molPt/s for propane dehydrogenation. The regioselective encapsulation is explained to contribute to isolating single Pt sites while preventing loss of dehydrogenation activity.

6. 是的,这篇文章评估了PtZn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供了数据,显示了通过区域选择合成方法封装在分子筛中的亚纳米PtZn簇(0.91-0.92 nm),其对丙烷脱氢表现出高达3.5-3.55 molC3H6/molPt/s的高比活性。文章解释区域选择封装有助于隔离单个Pt位点,同时防止脱氢活性的损失。

[1] "Nanosized zeolites, with reduced internal diffusion length, are commonly applied to improve the utilization efficiency. (11,12) Nevertheless, when the crystal size was decreased to 100 nm, the uniformity of the zeolite surface obviously decreased (Figure 1c), leading to low surface permeability and crystallinity." 

[2] "The novel finned structure of the zeolite for encapsulating metal species offers an opportunity to break the tradeoff effect. PtZn@S-1-Fin possessed some fins (3060 nm) growing epitaxially on the surface of zeolite seeds. The relative diffusion rate in PtZn@S-1-Fin was similar to that in nanosized zeolite (PtZn@S-1-100), owing to the short configuration diffusion length provided by the finned structure (Figure S2a). Moreover, the fins on zeolite seeds exhibited high crystallinity and a smooth surface."

7. Yes the article evaluates MFI zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides examples showing nanosized MFI zeolites can improve utilization efficiency due to shorter diffusion lengths, but suffer from low crystallinity and surface permeability when crystal size is below 100 nm. It shows a finned MFI structure can overcome this tradeoff by providing short diffusion lengths while maintaining high crystallinity and surface smoothness.

7. 是的,这篇文章评估了MFI分子筛作为丙烷脱氢催化剂的载体。它提供了例子,显示纳米MFI分子筛由于更短的扩散长度可以提高利用效率,但当结晶体大小低于100nm时,会遭受低结晶度和表面通透性的影响。它显示了鳍片MFI结构可以通过提供短的扩散长度而同时保持高结晶度和表面平滑度来克服这种权衡。
