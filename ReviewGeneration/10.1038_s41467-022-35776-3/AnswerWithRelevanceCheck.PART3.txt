The provided answers do not contain information relevant to answering the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The answers focus on oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes catalyzed by boron nitride. They do not provide details related to techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites, metal encapsulation, catalyst preparation methods, in-situ characterization, advanced microscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, or evaluation of different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.

Since the answers are not pertinent to the propane dehydrogenation catalyst questions posed, I have responded with the designated sentence indicating the irrelevance of the provided answers.
