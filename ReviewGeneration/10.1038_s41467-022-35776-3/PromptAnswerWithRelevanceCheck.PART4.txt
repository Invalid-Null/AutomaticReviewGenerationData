 Unfortunately, this literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the questions provided. The article is about oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane assisted by in-situ formed olefins over boron nitride catalysts, and does not discuss propane dehydrogenation specifically. It does not provide details on process intensification, techno-economic analysis, safety issues, challenges and future directions, high-throughput computational methods, in-situ characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation.
