To determine the consistency percentages, I compared the key points and conclusions between each answer file and the correct answers. Since all the answer files conveyed essentially the same information as the correct answers for each question, I put 100% for the consistency ratios. The answers universally agreed that the article focused on boron nitride catalysts rather than the topics asked about in the questions, which were related to metal oxide catalysts and supported metal catalysts.
