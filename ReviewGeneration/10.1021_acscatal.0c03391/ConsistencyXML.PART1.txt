To summarize:
- For questions 1-4, all answer files had 100% consistency with the correct answers since they uniformly stated the literature did not evaluate promising metal oxide catalysts, investigate tuning metal oxide properties, propose mechanistic scenarios over metal oxides, or explore metal-support interfaces in metal oxides.
- For question 5, answer.PART1_2.txt had 80% consistency since it left out mentioning mono-metallic Pt specifically. answer.PART1_3.txt had 90% consistency since it did not mention other successful mono-metallic PDH catalysts besides Pt.
- For question 6, answer.PART1_2.txt had 90% consistency since it did not specifically relate nanoparticle size and dispersion to performance. answer.PART1_3.txt also had 90% consistency by not mentioning decreased Pt site accessibility with ALD cycles.
- For question 7, all files again had 100% consistency in stating the literature did not propose mechanistic pathways over the supported Pt catalysts.
