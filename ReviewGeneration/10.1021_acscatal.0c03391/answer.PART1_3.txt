[1] "Using Pt dispersed on Al2O3 extrudate supports as a commercially relevant model system, we demonstrate that atomic layer deposition (ALD) metal oxide overcoats, used to tailor metal-active sites, can increase PDH yield and selectivity."

[2] "Among the multiple metals known to catalyze dehydrogenation where catalysts have been industrially commercialized, platinum-based catalysts are among the most successful." 

[3] "Platinum-based catalysts/processes are both highly active and very selective to the desired product."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data and insights showing Pt dispersed on Al2O3 extrudates is a commercially relevant and successful catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, with both high activity and selectivity. Atomic layer deposition of metal oxide overcoats on the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts is shown to further increase yield and selectivity.

答:是的,该文评估了单金属Pt受支撑催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供了数据和见解,表明分散在Al2O3挤出物上的Pt是一种商业相关且成功的丙烷脱氢催化剂,具有高活性和选择性。在Pt/Al2O3催化剂上沉积金属氧化物过涂层被证明可以进一步提高产量和选择性。

[1] "Increased Pt nanoparticle stability to sintering during steam deactivation tests along with increasing selectivity to propylene during catalytic tests was observed with increasing Al2O3 ALD cycles." 

[2] "The gradual, nearly linear, decrease of the chemisorbed H2 amount on Pt nanoparticles with an increasing number of ALD cycles shows a very good control of layer-by-layer deposition, and STEM also demonstrates that the Pt nanoparticle size remains the same after ALD overcoating."

[3] "The similarity of the C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield for each catalyst after ALD overcoating, which runs counter to the H2 chemisorption results, indicates that ALD-derived Al2O3 preferentially deposited on less active Pt sites for propane dehydrogenation."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like Pt nanoparticle size, Al2O3 overcoat thickness, and Pt-Al2O3 interfacial effects affect the performance of the supported Pt catalysts. It shows increasing Al2O3 ALD overcoat cycles improves Pt nanoparticle stability and propylene selectivity while maintaining activity. The linear decrease in chemisorbed H2 with ALD cycles indicates controlled deposition, without altering Pt size. This suggests Al2O3 preferentially deposits on less selective Pt sites.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文研究了诸如Pt纳米粒子大小、Al2O3过涂层厚度和Pt-Al2O3界面效应等特性如何影响受支撑的Pt催化剂的性能。它显示Al2O3 ALD过涂层循环次数的增加可以在保持活性的同时提高Pt纳米粒子的稳定性和丙烯选择性。随着ALD循环次数的增加,化学吸附的H2呈线性下降,表明了受控沉积,而不改变Pt的大小。这表明Al2O3优先沉积在较不选择性的Pt位点上。
