[1] "Using Pt dispersed on Al2O3 extrudate supports as a commercially relevant model system, we demonstrate that atomic layer deposition (ALD) metal oxide overcoats, used to tailor metal-active sites, can increase PDH yield and selectivity."

[2] "Among the multiple metals known to catalyze dehydrogenation where catalysts have been industrially commercialized, platinum-based catalysts are among the most successful."

[3] "In these Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, we focus on incorporation of Al or Ti overcoats throughout the length and width of the extruded catalyst."  
</Quotes>
<English>
Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts on Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data and insights showing Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with ALD Al2O3 or TiO2 overcoats can increase propane dehydrogenation yield and selectivity. The overcoats are incorporated throughout extruded Pt/Al2O3 catalysts.
</English>
<Chinese>
是的,文献评估了载于Al2O3上的单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供了数据和见解,显示具有ALD Al2O3或TiO2覆层的Pt/Al2O3催化剂可以提高丙烷脱氢的收率和选择性。这些覆层遍布压制的Pt/Al2O3催化剂中。

[1] "Increased Pt nanoparticle stability to sintering during steam deactivation tests along with increasing selectivity to propylene during catalytic tests was observed with increasing Al2O3 ALD cycles."

[2] "The gradual, nearly linear, decrease of the chemisorbed H2 amount on Pt nanoparticles with an increasing number of ALD cycles shows a very good control of layer-by-layer deposition, and STEM also demonstrates that the Pt nanoparticle size remains the same after ALD overcoating." 

[3] "The overcoated catalyst shows improved performance in terms of resistance to sintering and appears to be optimized after five to seven ALD cycles (6‒8 Å thickness of Al2O3 coating)."
</Quotes>
<English>
Yes, the article investigates how properties like Pt particle size, Al2O3 overcoat thickness affect the performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. It shows increasing Al2O3 ALD cycles leads to more stable Pt nanoparticles and higher propylene selectivity, with optimal results after 5-7 ALD cycles giving a 6-8 Å Al2O3 coating. STEM and H2 chemisorption data support layer-by-layer Al2O3 deposition without altering Pt size.
</English>
<Chinese>
是的,文献研究了诸如Pt颗粒大小、Al2O3覆层厚度等性质如何影响Pt/Al2O3催化剂的性能。它显示Al2O3 ALD循环次数的增加导致更稳定的Pt纳米颗粒和更高的丙烯选择性,在5-7个ALD循环后获得最佳结果,形成6-8 Å的Al2O3涂层。STEM和H2化学吸附数据支持层层沉积Al2O3而不改变Pt尺寸。
