[3] "The similarity of the C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield for each catalyst after ALD overcoating, which runs counter to the H2 chemisorption results, indicates that ALD-derived Al2O3 preferentially deposited on less active Pt sites for propane dehydrogenation."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like Pt nanoparticle size, Al2O3 overcoat thickness, and Pt-Al2O3 interfacial effects affect the performance of the supported Pt catalysts. It shows increasing Al2O3 ALD overcoat cycles improves Pt nanoparticle stability and propylene selectivity while maintaining activity. The linear decrease in chemisorbed H2 with ALD cycles indicates controlled deposition, without altering Pt size. This suggests Al2O3 preferentially deposits on less selective Pt sites.   
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文研究了诸如Pt纳米粒子大小、Al2O3过涂层厚度和Pt-Al2O3界面效应等特性如何影响受支撑的Pt催化剂的性能。它显示Al2O3 ALD过涂层循环次数的增加可以在保持活性的同时提高Pt纳米粒子的稳定性和丙烯选择性。随着ALD循环次数的增加,化学吸附的H2呈线性下降,表明了受控沉积,而不改变Pt的大小。这表明Al2O3优先沉积在较不选择性的Pt位点上。

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported platinum catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It uses Pt dispersed on Al2O3 extrudates as a model catalyst system. The article provides data and insights showing that ALD overcoating of Al2O3 or TiO2 on the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts can increase propane dehydrogenation yield and selectivity. It also notes that platinum-based catalysts are among the most successful for propane dehydrogenation.

<quotes>
[1] "The thickest Al2O3 layer deposited after seven cycles of ALD is 0.9 nm, which is not thick enough to change the surface area of the support with the largest average pore size 16.1 nm (cf. Table 1)." 

[2] "Because ALD processes deposit the precursor via reaction with surface hydroxyls, for lower surface area catalysts, less Al2O3 is deposited per cycle."

[3] "The gradual, nearly linear, decrease of the chemisorbed H2 amount on Pt nanoparticles with an increasing number of ALD cycles shows a very good control of layer-by-layer deposition, and STEM also demonstrates that the Pt nanoparticle size remains the same after ALD overcoating."

[4] "While the number of accessible Pt sites after ALD overcoating is decreased, an increase in the number of accessible Pt sites after air annealing suggests nanopore formation in the ALD overcoat."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like Al2O3 overcoat thickness, pore size, and surface area affect the performance of the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. It shows the Al2O3 overcoat thickness can be precisely controlled by the number of ALD cycles. Lower surface area supports deposit less Al2O3 per cycle. STEM and H2 chemisorption data reveal layer-by-layer deposition that maintains Pt nanoparticle size. Nanopores are also shown to form in the overcoat upon air annealing.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,这篇文章研究了诸如Al2O3覆层厚度、孔大小和表面积等性质如何影响Pt/Al2O3催化剂的性能。它显示Al2O3覆层的厚度可以通过ALD循环次数精确控制。较低表面积的支持体每次循环沉积的Al2O3更少。STEM和H2化学吸附数据揭示了层层沉积法能够维持Pt纳米粒子的大小。结果也表明,空气退火过程中覆层中形成了纳米孔。
