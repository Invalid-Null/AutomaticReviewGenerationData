<quotes>
[1] "Using Pt dispersed on Al2O3 extrudate supports as a commercially relevant model system, we demonstrate that atomic layer deposition (ALD) metal oxide overcoats, used to tailor metal-active sites, can increase PDH yield and selectivity."

[2] "Among the multiple metals known to catalyze dehydrogenation where catalysts have been industrially commercialized, platinum-based catalysts are among the most successful." 

[3] "In these Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, we focus on incorporation of Al or Ti overcoats throughout the length and width of the extruded catalyst."

[4] "Through combined synthetic, characterization, and catalytic studies, we have shown that ALD overcoating can be applied to formed Pt catalysts (e.g., extrudates) to improve the performance of propane dehydrogenation reaction."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported platinum catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It uses Pt dispersed on Al2O3 extrudates as a model catalyst system. The article provides data and insights showing that ALD overcoating of Al2O3 or TiO2 on the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts can increase propane dehydrogenation yield and selectivity. It also notes that platinum-based catalysts are among the most successful for propane dehydrogenation.

[1] "The thickest Al2O3 layer deposited after seven cycles of ALD is 0.9 nm, which is not thick enough to change the surface area of the support with the largest average pore size 16.1 nm (cf. Table 1)." 

[2] "Because ALD processes deposit the precursor via reaction with surface hydroxyls, for lower surface area catalysts, less Al2O3 is deposited per cycle."

[3] "The gradual, nearly linear, decrease of the chemisorbed H2 amount on Pt nanoparticles with an increasing number of ALD cycles shows a very good control of layer-by-layer deposition, and STEM also demonstrates that the Pt nanoparticle size remains the same after ALD overcoating."

[4] "While the number of accessible Pt sites after ALD overcoating is decreased, an increase in the number of accessible Pt sites after air annealing suggests nanopore formation in the ALD overcoat."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like Al2O3 overcoat thickness, pore size, and surface area affect the performance of the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. It shows the Al2O3 overcoat thickness can be precisely controlled by the number of ALD cycles. Lower surface area supports deposit less Al2O3 per cycle. STEM and H2 chemisorption data reveal layer-by-layer deposition that maintains Pt nanoparticle size. Nanopores are also shown to form in the overcoat upon air annealing.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,这篇文章研究了诸如Al2O3覆层厚度、孔大小和表面积等性质如何影响Pt/Al2O3催化剂的性能。它显示Al2O3覆层的厚度可以通过ALD循环次数精确控制。较低表面积的支持体每次循环沉积的Al2O3更少。STEM和H2化学吸附数据揭示了层层沉积法能够维持Pt纳米粒子的大小。结果也表明,空气退火过程中覆层中形成了纳米孔。
