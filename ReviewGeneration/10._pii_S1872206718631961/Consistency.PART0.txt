 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative answer files, here is the compiled JSON output comparing the consistency of each answer file's responses to the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%", 
    "answer1.txt": "50%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "0%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer0.txt": "30%",
    "answer1.txt": "80%", 
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "0%"
  },
  "3": {
    "answer0.txt": "50%",
    "answer1.txt": "30%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "30%", 
    "answer4.txt": "0%"
  },  
  "4": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "5": {
    "answer0.txt": "30%",
    "answer1.txt": "80%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "80%",
    "answer4.txt": "30%"
  },
  "6": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%",

I carefully compared the quotes, summary answers, and key points made in each comparative answer file to the correct answers provided to calculate a consistency percentage for each question and file. This JSON output summarizes the comparative analysis results across all questions and answer files.
