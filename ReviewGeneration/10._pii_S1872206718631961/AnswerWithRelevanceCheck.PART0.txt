      [1] "Therefore, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) process is one of the efficient industrial routes to produce propylene [4, 5]."

      [2] "In particular, coke covers the active sites, leading to reduced activity and loss of stability, which requires the periodic regeneration of the catalyst. The main challenge in the PDH process is that the active sites of the catalyst should be able to activate the stable CH bond in the propane molecule, which has a strong bonding energy of 409 kJ/mol." 

      [3] "The calculations clearly highlight the challenge faced by active centers in PDH. For propene formation, they should possess a reactivity sufficient to break the strong CH bonds of propane; however, their reactivity should not be too active to hinder propene desorption and lead to deep dehydrogenation."

      The articles explain that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation through the propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) process, which provides an efficient industrial route for propylene production. Catalysts help activate the stable C-H bonds in propane, but must balance reactivity to break C-H bonds while avoiding deep dehydrogenation. DFT calculations highlight the challenge of achieving the appropriate reactivity. However, the articles do not provide details on specific mechanisms of catalyst activity.

      [1] "Platinum and chromium oxides are the conventional catalysts used in the PDH process."

      [2] "Bao's group [8] used highly dispersed Fe catalysts (0.5% mass loading) supported on SiO2 for the non-oxidative methane conversion."

      [3] "Hock's group [9, 10, 11] synthesized a series of highly dispersed single metal atom catalysts (Zn, Fe, Co) and applied them in the PDH reaction."

      [4] "our previous computational work demonstrated that single Pt atoms supported on nitrogen- or boron-doped graphene are potentially useful PDH catalysts [12]."

      [1] "More importantly, the calculations indicated the tunable effects of nitrogen or boron dopants on the graphene support, which can be used to continuously adjust the catalytic performance of the single Pt atoms."

      [2] "First-principles calculations were performed to study the direct dehydrogenation of propane on single Pt atoms supported on boron and nitrogen vacancies in a boron nitride nanosheet."

      [3] "Furthermore, the calculations reveal that dissociative adsorption is preferred over radical formation for the first CH bond activation in propane."

      [4] "Moreover, Pt supported on a boron vacancy exhibits a much smaller barrier along the reaction pathway leading from propane to propene, compared with its Pt-Nvac counterpart."

      [5] "Recently, SACs have exhibited excellent catalytic performance in the activation of light alkanes. In particular, SACs deliver high alkene selectivity and excellent stability. Bao's group [8] used highly dispersed Fe catalysts (0.5% mass loading) supported on SiO2 for the non-oxidative methane conversion. At 1363 K, the conversion of methane reached 48.4% and the selectivity of ethene was 48.1%. More impressively, almost no coke was formed during a 60-h test and the carbon efficiency was nearly 100%. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) experiments showed that a single Fe atom was embedded into the SiO2 crystalline structure, bonded with two carbon and one silicon atoms."

      [6] "On the other hand, our previous computational work demonstrated that single Pt atoms supported on nitrogen- or boron-doped graphene are potentially useful PDH catalysts [12]. More importantly, the calculations indicated the tunable effects of nitrogen or boron dopants on the graphene support, which can be used to continuously adjust the catalytic performance of the single Pt atoms."

      The articles describe the application of DFT calculations to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways on single atom catalysts, particularly platinum supported on doped graphene and boron nitride. The calculations provide some insights into the effects of different dopants and anchoring sites on reactivity and reaction barriers. Experimental results demonstrate high selectivity for ethene conversion using iron catalysts. However, the computational insights are limited and not comprehensive across all the major catalysts and pathways involved.
