<Answer>

 Unfortunately, after carefully reviewing the literature, I do not find any relevant quotes or information to answer the provided questions. The article focuses on the synthesis and characterization of Co single atom catalysts supported on SiO2 nanomeshes for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss zeolitic supports, metal encapsulation, optimization of active phase dispersion, in-situ characterization, advanced microscopy of metal-support interfaces, X-ray techniques to probe oxidation states, or evaluation of different reactor types.

[1] "Using the HAADF-STEM image to confirm the form of Co single atoms (Figure 2h), the heavier isolated Co atoms could be readily discerned on the surface of the mesopore walls of the SiO2 NMs (see red circles in Figure 2i)."

[2] "To further demonstrate the stability of the Co SAs/SiO2 NMs catalyst, a series of characterization of the catalyst after 24 h PDH reaction was executed. No clusters or nanoparticles appear in the HAADF-STEM image (Figure S32), which meant that the Co atoms are still atomically dispersed on SiO2 NMs after catalysis."

[1] "Then, the CoO3 active center was simulated on the basis of experimental data."
[2] "The calculation results show that the bond length of SiO is 1.99 Å, which is comparable with the EXAFS results (2.05 Å) (Table S2)." 
[3] "Combining all of the above information, we concluded that Co in Co SAs/SiO2 NMs was still atomically dispersed on the support after a 24 h PDH process, and the catalyst displayed high long-term stability against the reaction."
[4] "After the reaction, the catalyst still maintained the high surface area of SiO2 NMs with the BET surface area of 813 m3 g1, which nearly exhibited no change compared to the fresh catalyst (Figure S33)."
[5] "Specifically, the EXAFS fitting result confirmed the robustness of Co single sites after the reaction (Figure S34)."
