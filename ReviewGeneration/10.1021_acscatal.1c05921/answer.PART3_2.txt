[1] "Then, the CoO3 active center was simulated on the basis of experimental data."
[2] "The calculation results show that the bond length of SiO is 1.99 Å, which is comparable with the EXAFS results (2.05 Å) (Table S2)." 
[3] "Combining all of the above information, we concluded that Co in Co SAs/SiO2 NMs was still atomically dispersed on the support after a 24 h PDH process, and the catalyst displayed high long-term stability against the reaction."
[4] "After the reaction, the catalyst still maintained the high surface area of SiO2 NMs with the BET surface area of 813 m3 g1, which nearly exhibited no change compared to the fresh catalyst (Figure S33)."
[5] "Specifically, the EXAFS fitting result confirmed the robustness of Co single sites after the reaction (Figure S34)."

5. Answer: The article employs advanced microscopy and X-ray techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses EXAFS to determine bond lengths and confirm that cobalt single sites remain stable during catalysis. AC-HAADF-STEM imaging is also used to visualize isolated cobalt atoms on the silica support.
