[1] Thus, developing cheap and efficient alternatives is a crucial research topic. Currently, supported non-noble metal nanoparticles/cluster catalysts have been explored as they are earth-abundant, eco-friendly, highly tunable, and considerably active for PDH. 

[2] Single-atom catalysts (SACs), in which isolated active sites are anchored on the support, offer a solution to selectively produce propylene and prevent further CC (H) scissions during the PDH reaction.
