In summary:

- answer.PART3_0.txt provided no relevant information, so I marked 0% consistency for all questions
- The other answer files showed high consistency with the provided correct answers, so I marked 100% for the questions where there was clear alignment
- The only exception was answer.PART3_3.txt for question 5, which stated there were no advanced microscopy techniques used. So I marked 0% consistency for that specific question.
