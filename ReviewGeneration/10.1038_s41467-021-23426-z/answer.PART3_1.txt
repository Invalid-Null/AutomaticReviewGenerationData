[1] "Supported metal nanoclusters consisting of several dozen atoms are highly attractive for heterogeneous catalysis with unique catalytic properties. However, the metal nanocluster catalysts face the challenges of thermal sintering and consequent deactivation owing to the loss of metal surface areas particularly in the applications of high-temperature reactions."

[2] "To understand the direction of charge transfer between metal clusters and the SC support, we calculated the valence band maximum (VBM) level of SGraphene and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of Pt38 cluster by using the Frontier Orbital Theory."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it prepares supported metal nanoclusters consisting of several dozen atoms to maximize metal utilization and mitigate thermal sintering issues. It also calculates charge transfer between the metal clusters and sulfur-doped carbon support to understand metal-support interactions.

[1] "High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) measurements of the SC supported Pt nanocluster (Pt/SC) catalyst showed that numerous Pt nanoclusters with size in the range of 0.8-1.3nm (mean size, 1.0nm) homogeneously distributed over the whole carbon matrix, without any large particles or nanocluster aggregates."

[2] "Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM image with atomic resolution indicates that the Pt nanoclusters are highly crystalline and mainly enclosed by (111) and (200) crystal planes of face-centered cubic Pt."

[3] "HAADF-STEM measurements was employed to monitor the morphology change of these catalysts before and after the PDH reaction. As speculated, serious sintering of the Pt nanoclusters happened on Pt/S-free-C, Pt/C, Pt/Al2O3, and PtSn/Al2O3, while the size and morphology of the Pt nanoclusters in Pt/SC were essentially unchanged."
