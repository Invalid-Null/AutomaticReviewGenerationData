I carefully compared the content of each answer file to the provided correct answers to determine consistency percentages. For questions where the provided answers contained the same key information as the correct answers, I assigned 100% consistency. For questions where the provided answers did not contain relevant information or differed significantly from the correct answers, I assigned 0% consistency.
