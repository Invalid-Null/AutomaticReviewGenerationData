[1] "Considerable efforts have, therefore, been devoted in the past decade to developing different physical and chemical approaches for suppressing metal nanocluster sintering at high temperatures."

[2] "The most adopted method is to elaborately tune the spatial arrangement of metals and supports at the nanoscale for constructing the physical barriers against sintering, such as the maximization of inter-particle spacing by filling metal nanoclusters in the channels of mesoporous silica and carbon supports and the encapsulation of metal nanoclusters with porous nanoshells (e.g., zeolite and metal oxides)"

<English version answer>
Answer: The article discusses methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion, such as maximizing inter-particle spacing by filling metal nanoclusters into mesopores of silica and carbon supports, and encapsulating metal nanoclusters in porous shells of zeolites or metal oxides. These methods aim to construct physical barriers against sintering.

[1] "High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) measurements of the SC supported Pt nanocluster (Pt/SC) catalyst showed that numerous Pt nanoclusters with size in the range of 0.81.3nm (mean size, 1.0nm) homogeneously distributed over the whole carbon matrix, without any large particles or nanocluster aggregates."  

[2] "Atomic resolution HAADF-STEM image with atomic resolution indicates that the Pt nanoclusters are highly crystalline and mainly enclosed by (111) and (200) crystal planes of face-centered cubic Pt."

[3] "HAADF-STEM measurements was employed to monitor the morphology change of these catalysts before and after the PDH reaction. As speculated, serious sintering of the Pt nanoclusters happened on Pt/S-free-C, Pt/C, Pt/Al2O3, and PtSn/Al2O3, while the size and morphology of the Pt nanoclusters in Pt/SC were essentially unchanged."
