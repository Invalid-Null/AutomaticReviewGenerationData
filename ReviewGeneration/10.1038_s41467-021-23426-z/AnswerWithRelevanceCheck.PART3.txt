         [1] "To understand the direction of charge transfer between metal clusters and the SC support, we calculated the valence band maximum (VBM) level of SGraphene and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of Pt38 cluster by using the Frontier Orbital Theory."

         [2] "The most adopted method is to elaborately tune the spatial arrangement of metals and supports at the nanoscale for constructing the physical barriers against sintering, such as the maximization of inter-particle spacing by filling metal nanoclusters in the channels of mesoporous silica and carbon supports and the encapsulation of metal nanoclusters with porous nanoshells (e.g., zeolite and metal oxides)"

         The article does not specifically describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It focuses more on sulfur-doped carbon supports for stabilizing metal nanoclusters. The article does discuss methods for optimizing metal-support interactions and preventing sintering of metal nanoclusters on various supports like mesoporous silica, carbon, zeolites, and metal oxides. But isolated single sites in zeolites are not emphasized.

         该文没有具体描述在分子筛支撑体上合成隔离的单点位的技术。它更多地集中在使用硫掺杂的碳支撑体来稳定金属纳米簇。该文确实讨论了优化金属-支撑体相互作用和防止各种支撑体(如介孔氧化硅、碳、分子筛和金属氧化物)上的金属纳米簇烧结的方法。但是没有强调分子筛中的隔离单点位。

         [1] "Pt nanocluster catalysts with sulphur-doped carbon (SC) supports were prepared by wet impregnation of H2PtCl6 and subsequent H2 reduction at 700 °C." 

         [2] "Bimetallic (PtIr and IrRu) and multi-metallic (PtIrRu) cluster catalysts were prepared with same method."

         The article does not specifically evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolites for enhancing propane dehydrogenation stability. It focuses more on sulfur-doped carbon supports to stabilize metal nanoclusters. The article describes using wet impregnation and H2 reduction to prepare Pt, bimetallic, and multi-metallic nanoclusters on sulfur-doped carbon supports. But encapsulation in zeolites is not discussed.

         Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It prepares Pt, bimetallic, and multi-metallic nanoclusters on sulfur-doped carbon supports using wet impregnation and H2 reduction. This method helps disperse the small nanoclusters uniformly on the support.

         [1] "High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) measurements of the SC supported Pt nanocluster (Pt/SC) catalyst showed that numerous Pt nanoclusters with size in the range of 0.8-1.3nm (mean size, 1.0nm) homogeneously distributed over the whole carbon matrix, without any large particles or nanocluster aggregates."

         [2] "Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM image with atomic resolution indicates that the Pt nanoclusters are highly crystalline and mainly enclosed by (111) and (200) crystal planes of face-centered cubic Pt."
