[1] "In principle, these obstacles can be overcome by oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with molecular oxygen, but despite much work being conducted on developing this technology, (3,4) there are very few examples of commercial ODH processes. The major limitation is that the presence of O2 often leads to overoxidation of the alkane, resulting in poor alkene selectivity and a high CO2 penalty."

[2] "To overcome these problems, the potential use of softer oxidants has been evaluated for some time. (5,6)"

[3] "Among the soft oxidants, CO2 has recently received much attention due to the surge in interest in new ways of utilizing this greenhouse gas. (7) In comparison with molecular oxygen, CO2 has many advantages in the process of dehydrogenation: it can minimize overoxidation of hydrocarbons, therefore enhancing the selectivity for the targeted alkenes; it is also cheap, inert, and thermodynamically stable."

Answer: The article explains that catalysts can facilitate propane dehydrogenation by overcoming thermodynamic constraints and lowering activation energy barriers. Specifically, it mentions that oxidative dehydrogenation using molecular oxygen as the oxidant can help overcome equilibrium limitations, but often leads to overoxidation and poor selectivity. As an alternative, the use of "softer" oxidants like CO2 is proposed, which can minimize overoxidation and enhance selectivity. The advantages of CO2 over O2 are described, including its inertness, low cost, and thermodynamic stability.

Answer: 该文献解释了催化剂可以通过克服热力学限制和降低活化能垒来促进丙烷脱氢。具体来说,它提到氧化脱氢使用分子氧作为氧化剂可以帮助克服平衡限制,但通常会导致过氧化和选择性差。作为替代,提出使用“更软”的氧化剂如CO2,这可以最小化过氧化并提高选择性。文中描述了CO2相对O2的优势,包括其惰性、低成本和热力学稳定性。
