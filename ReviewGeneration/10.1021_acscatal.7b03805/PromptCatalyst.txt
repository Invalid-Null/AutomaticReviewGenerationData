Elucidating the Role of CO2 in the Soft Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane over Ceria-Based Catalysts

Abstract
A mixed oxide support containing Ce, Zr, and Al was synthesized using a physical grinding method and applied in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 as the oxidant. The activity of the support was compared with that of fully formulated catalysts containing palladium. The Pd/CeZrAlOx material exhibited long-term stability and selectivity to propene (during continuous operation for 140 h), which is not normally associated with dehydrogenation catalysts. From temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2 it was found that the catalyst possessed both acidic and basic sites. In addition, temperature-programmed reduction showed that palladium promoted both the reduction and reoxidation of the support. When the role of CO2 was investigated in the absence of gas-phase oxidant, using a temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor, it was found that CO2 dissociates over the reduced catalyst, leading to formation of CO and selective oxygen species. It is proposed that CO2 has the dual role of regenerating selective oxygen species and shifting the equilibrium for alkane dehydrogenation by consuming H2 through the reverse water-gas-shift reaction. These two mechanistic functions have previously been considered to be mutually exclusive.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
There is a large and growing worldwide demand for short-chain alkenes, particularly ethene and propene. It is estimated that production of these two chemical building blocks will exceed 300 M tons in 2020. In the case of propene, current primary methods for its production (naphtha steam cracking and refinery fluid catalytic cracking) are not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of the market, creating a “propene gap”. (1) Therefore, the direct dehydrogenation of alkanes, which is already providing an alternative route to alkenes, is both supplementing and replacing traditional methods as the propene gap widens. (2) However, to obtain high productivity, the dehydrogenation of light alkanes needs to be performed at high temperatures to overcome equilibrium limitations and low rates of reaction. Thus, in turn, drawbacks such as high energy consumption, low selectivity toward the desired alkene, and accelerated catalyst deactivation are apparent, since thermal cracking reactions are favored at high reaction temperatures. In principle, these obstacles can be overcome by oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with molecular oxygen, but despite much work being conducted on developing this technology, (3,4) there are very few examples of commercial ODH processes. The major limitation is that the presence of O2 often leads to overoxidation of the alkane, resulting in poor alkene selectivity and a high CO2 penalty. To overcome these problems, the potential use of “softer” oxidants has been evaluated for some time. (5,6)
Among the soft oxidants, CO2 has recently received much attention due to the surge in interest in new ways of utilizing this greenhouse gas. (7) In comparison with molecular oxygen, CO2 has many advantages in the process of dehydrogenation: it can minimize overoxidation of hydrocarbons, therefore enhancing the selectivity for the targeted alkenes; it is also cheap, inert, and thermodynamically stable. In view of these advantages, the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes and alkylated aromatics with CO2 has been arousing considerable interest. (8−13) Although reaction with CO2 generally leads to lower conversion in comparison to commercialized dehydrogenation processes, the selectivity in a CO2-ODH reaction is significantly improved. (14,15)
The mechanism for the ODH of light alkanes with CO2 has not been thoroughly explained, although different pathways have been proposed. It has been reported that the redox and acid–base properties of oxides can determine which of two pathways the reaction takes. (16) The first route is believed to occur via a Mars–van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, which involves the participation of lattice oxygen ions as the selective oxygen species and oxygen vacancies as the adsorption sites. The alternative two-step route is the direct dehydrogenation of the alkane coupled with the reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS) reaction (eq 1):
(1)
The reaction pathway depends on the nature of the catalyst used and the reaction conditions. (17) The MvK mechanism is generally accepted for reactions over metal oxides possessing high oxygen capacity and high redox potential (e.g., vanadium oxide or chromium oxide). The presence of gallium oxide or indium oxide is more likely to increase conversion of alkanes due to the RWGS reaction. Both pathways are limited at low temperature: MvK by oxygen mobility and RWGS by thermodynamics. There is, however, a tradeoff to operation of the reaction at higher temperatures (>550 °C), which favor combustion of both the reactants and products. Therefore, reducible metal oxides capable of activating CO2 at lower temperatures could be potential candidates for this reaction. (18)
Cerium(IV) oxide (ceria) is widely used in catalysis, primarily as a component of support materials for metal nanoparticles. However, it has been reported that ceria can be an effective catalyst in its own right for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of CO2. (19,20) The high activity of ceria is attributed to its oxygen storage/release capacity (OSC), which is dependent upon the creation and replenishment of oxygen vacancies. (21,22) The number of potential oxygen vacancies can be further increased and stabilized by the addition of ZrO2. Such a combination of metal oxides leads to higher catalytic performance and a lower temperature for coke oxidation during the regeneration of the spent catalyst. Previous reports have shown that CO2 can dissociate on the surface on CeZrOx, yielding highly oxidizing O species, which maintain Ce in a highly oxidized state. (23) Unfortunately, these materials are not renowned for their durability, and therefore they are often stabilized by using Al2O3 as the underlying support. The presence of Al2O3 increases the total surface area of the catalyst, which also has been reported to influence catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. (24) To sum up, the catalytic performance of CeZrOx materials depends both on their textural properties, such as crystalline phase, particle size, and surface area, and on their redox properties.
In this study, a CeO2–ZrO2–Al2O3-based material, which was synthesized by a mechanochemical route, was found to be highly selective and durable in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) using CO2 as a soft oxidant. The subsequent addition of palladium did not reduce the selectivity or durability but significantly improved the catalytic activity. Conventional characterization indicates that the role of palladium is to promote oxygen transfer by enhancing the reducibility and reoxidation of the CeO2–ZrO2, while reactive characterization indicates that the role of CO2 is to replace the selective oxygen consumed during dehydrogenation and to increase propene formation by shifting the equilibrium through the RWGS reaction.

Catalyst Preparation
The catalyst supports used in this study were prepared by a physical grinding method. Appropriate amounts of the precursors (Ce(acac)3, 1.12 g, 99%, Aldrich and/or Al(acac)3, 99%, Aldrich, 1.66 g and/or Zr(acac)4, 97%, 1.215 g, Aldrich) were added together and ground thoroughly for period of 10 min using a mortar and pestle to form a homogeneous powder. The powder was calcined in flowing air at 300 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 °C/min to give a support composition with Ce:Zr:Al molar ratio 1:1:2. Subsequently, Pd was wet-impregnated onto the calcined support according to the following protocol: H2O (2 cm3, HPLC grade, VWR) and an aqueous solution of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 (10%, 0.7 cm3, Aldrich) were added to the support (0.5 g) under vigorous stirring conditions at room temperature to give a catalyst with 5% Pd loading (5%Pd/CeZrAlOx). The solution was agitated in this way until it formed a paste, which was then dried (120 °C, 12 h) and further calcined in flowing air (500 °C, 5 °C min–1, 4 h).
Propane Dehydrogenation
Previous reports showed that, in the presence of CO2 and C3H8 at a molar ratio of 1:1, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be lowered by 50 °C. (25) We therefore performed all the catalytic studies reported herein utilizing a 1:1 ratio between CO2 and C3H8 in the reaction mixture.
Catalytic measurements were performed at atmospheric pressure using a fixed-bed laboratory microreactor, maintaining the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) at 6000 h–1 and total flow rate of gases at 15 cm3 min–1. Catalyst (0.2 g) was loaded into the reactor tube (length 30 cm, diameter 1.2 cm) and packed between two plugs of quartz wool. The temperature of the catalyst bed was measured with a K-type thermocouple. The inlet gas flow was set using MKS mass-flow controllers. The catalyst was pelletized to give particles in the size range 200–300 μm. Once the catalyst was loaded into the reactor, it was pretreated prior to reaction in the presence of He for 30 min at a temperature of 110 °C. Reaction mixtures consisted of He (98%, BOC), CO2 (99.99%, BOC), and C3H8 (99.99%, BOC) with a relative ratio of 26:37:37 by volume, unless otherwise stated. The catalyst was in contact with the reaction gas mixture while the reactor was heated from 110 to 500 °C. Thermal dehydrogenation was performed under a stream of He and C3H8 at 500 °C for 1.5 h. The catalyst was subsequently reoxidized for 2.5 h under a stream of pure CO2 at 500 °C, before the standard ODH reaction in the presence of He, C3H8, and CO2 was repeated. The reactants and products were analyzed using a Varian 3800 online gas chromatograph fitted with Porapak Q and Molsieve columns and TCD (CO, CO2) and FID detectors (CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, C3H8). Conversion and selectivity were calculated according to equations presented in the Supporting Information. For regeneration of the catalyst, a stream of 15 cm3 min–1 of CO2 or He (2.5 h, 500 °C) was used. For the quantification of H2, a Shimadzu GC-2014 instrument with HaysepQ and Molsieve columns was used. The GC was fitted with TCD and FID detectors and a methanizer.
Catalyst Characterization
BET Surface Area Analysis
Surface area measurements were performed using a Gemini 2360 Surface Area Analyzer. A five-point analysis was performed using N2 as the adsorbate gas. Samples (100 mg) were degassed under a flow of He for 1 h at 120 °C prior to analysis. Surface area analysis of the Pd/CeZrAlOx material (140 h used and reoxidized in CO2) was performed using a Quantachrome Nova 2200e Surface Area Analyzer, using N2 as the adsorbate gas after degassing the sample for 2 h at 120 °C.
X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
XRD analysis was conducted using a PANalytical X’pert pro diffractometer employing a Cu Kα X-ray source. Typical scans were taken over a 2θ angular range between 15 and 80° (1°/min) using 40 kV and 40 mA X-ray source settings. The mean crystallite sizes of Pd and PdO in the samples were estimated using the Scherrer equation.
Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
TGA was performed using a PerkinElmer TGA 4000 instrument. The sample was heated from 30 to 750 °C at 10 °C min–1, in flowing air (20 cm3 min–1).
Temperature-Programmed Reduction Analysis (TPR)
TPR analyses were performed on a Quantachrome ChemBet instrument. The instrument was calibrated for quantitative measurements of hydrogen consumption using different known masses of CuO wires. These were heated to 600 °C under an atmosphere of 10% H2/Ar at a rate of 15 °C min–1. In all cases, catalysts (0.05 g) were pretreated under a flow of He at 110 °C for 1 h. TPR analyses were performed using 10% H2/Ar (BOC 99.9%, 15 cm3 min–1) over the temperature range 30–750 °C using a 10 °C min–1 heating rate. To derive more information from the TPR thermogram, a computed curve was fitted to the experimental curve, and the output parameters were analyzed. A least-squares approach was used to compare the computed and experimental profiles. Regression was performed on the experimental curves using least squares and a Nelder–Mead Simplex (as described by Lagarias et al. (26)); the algorithm in MATLAB was employed to minimize the variables. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) analyses were performed on a Quantachrome ChemBet instrument using NH3 and CO2 as adsorbates to determine acidic and basic sites, respectively. Prior to analysis, the catalyst surface was saturated with the required gas (NH3 or CO2) at room temperature for a period of 30 min, before tracking desorption during heat treatment from 30 to 800 °C in the presence of He.
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Analysis
XPS was carried out using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD system employing a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source operating at 120 W. Data were collected with pass energies of 160 eV for survey spectra and 40 eV for higher-resolution scans. The system was operated in the hybrid mode, using a combination of magnetic immersion and electrostatic lenses, and a signal was acquired by illuminating an area of approximately 300 × 700 μm2. A magnetically confined charge compensation system was used to minimize charging of the sample surface, and all spectra were acquired with a 90° takeoff angle. A base pressure of ∼1 × 10–9 Torr was maintained during collection of the spectra.
X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) Analyses
XAS studies were performed on the B18 Beamline at the UK Diamond Light Source. All samples were formed into compressed pellets using cellulose, and the measurements were performed in transmission mode with ion chamber detectors. Acquisition of the Ce L3-edge data was performed in a vacuum environment using a Si (111) monochromator, whereas the Pd K-edge and Zr K-edge data were obtained by using the Si (311) monochromator. XAS data processing was performed using the Demeter IFEFFIT package.
The Ce L3-edge XANES spectra were fitted using a combination of arctangent (for background subtraction) and Gaussian (for Ce oxidation state) line-shape functions. The data were fitted in the range of −15 ≤ Eo ≤ 30 eV. The spectra were fitted with five Gaussian peaks at fixed eV: namely, a high-energy peak at 5740 eV (peak A), peaks at 5732 and 5730 eV (peaks B1 and B2, respectively), a peak associated with Ce3+ at 5728 eV, and a pre-edge feature fixed at 5722 eV (peak C), associated with multiple scattering phenomena with final states having d band character at the bottom of the conduction band of CeO2. (27) The width of the Gaussian functions was fixed at ∼3 eV to account for lifetime broadening of a 2p hole state. Ce3+ content was determined from the area of the Ce3+ peak area (28) as
EXAFS fitting of the Zr K-edge was used to evaluate two Zr–oxygen (Zr–O1 and Zr–O2) distances and their coordination numbers around the Zr atom. During the fitting process, the amplitude reduction factor was fixed at a value of 1 and the data were fitted at k window = 3–12.5 and r window = 1–3 Å. In addition, a Debye–Waller model with a single parameter, at room temperature, was used to set the Debye–Waller factor (σ2) parameter during the fitting. For Pd K-edge EXAFS, the data were fitted at a k window of 3–14 and r = 1–4 Å. The amplitude reduction factor was constrained at 0.83. EXAFS fitting of the Ce L3-edge was used to evaluate Ce–O first shell distances and their coordination numbers. Multielectron excitations were removed prior to EXAFS analysis. (29) During the fitting process, the amplitude reduction factor was fixed at a value of 0.8 and the data were fitted at k window = 2.5–8.8 and r window = 1–3 Å. In addition, a Debye–Waller model with a single parameter, at room temperature, was used to set the Debye–Waller factor (σ2) parameter during the fitting.
Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy analysis was performed using a Renishaw in Via microscope operated with a green argon ion laser (λ 514 nm). A typical spectral acquisition sequence consisted of 10 accumulations of 10 s acquisition time per sample.
Electron Microscopy Analysis
Samples for examination by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) were prepared by dispersing the catalyst powder (calcined at 500 °C) onto a holey-carbon film supported by a 300 mesh copper TEM grid. Bright field (BF) and high angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM images were taken using an aberration-corrected JEM ARM-200CF microscope operating at 200 kV. Samples for analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (XEDS) analysis were prepared by attaching the Pd/CeZrAlOx catalyst to an Al sample stub using adhesive carbon tape. The samples were examined in a Tescan MAIA3 FEG-SEM operating at an accelerating voltage of 20 keV, which was equipped with an Oxford Instruments silicon drift detector.
Experimental Methods To Determine the Role of CO2
Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP)
TAP experiments were performed using a modified TAP-2 system. (30) The catalyst was first reduced by repeatedly pulsing 5% H2/Ar (99.9%, BOC) at 400 °C until no more uptake of H2 was detected. Once the catalyst was reduced, a train of 30 CO2 (99.99%, BOC) pulses was sent over the catalyst at room temperature, and the exit responses at m/z 28 (CO) and m/z 44 (CO2) were recorded. After the pulsing of CO2, the catalyst was then heated to 400 °C until no further release of CO2 was detected. This ensured the removal of any surface-bound CO2. The experiment was then repeated but with the catalyst heated to 400 °C after the reduction procedure.
Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS)
Diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was performed using a Bruker Tensor 27 instrument with a HgCdTe (MCT) detector and a Harrick Praying Mantis HVC-DRP-4 cell equipped with ZnSe windows. Gas flows (N2, (98%, BOC) 10–40 cm3 min–1, O2 (98%, BOC) 10–20 cm3 min–1, CO (99.9%, BOC) 0.5–1 cm3 min–1, and CO2 (99.99%, BOC)10–20 cm3 min–1) were regulated by Bronkhorst mass flowmeters. The sample cell was heated in the temperature range 30–350 °C, and the analyses were run in the 600–4000 cm–1 spectral range, with 64 scans being acquired every 5 min.

Catalytic Activity
To identify the key interactions between the various components in the Pd/Ce–Zr–Al–O catalytic system, a matrix of materials was initially evaluated at a reaction temperature of 500 °C (see Table 1 and Table S1 and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Any material combination without Ce or Pd being present resulted in low activity or poor selectivity. However, both 5% Pd/CeO2 and 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx showed high conversion levels of propane, but their selectivity patterns differed significantly. While Pd/CeZrAlOx gave 93% selectivity toward propane, Pd/CeO2 exhibited only 84%, which could be the result of the absence of coexisting basic and acidic sites provided by ZrO2 and Al2O3 in the CeZrAlOx catalyst support (see below). The Pd-free material (i.e., CeZrAlOx only) resulted in lower conversion but a selectivity pattern (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) similar to that of the Pd/CeZrAlOx catalyst. This suggests that Pd was responsible for high conversion, and the selectivity was more related to the support composition. Among the materials containing different ratios of Ce, Zr, and Al, screening studies showed that a support with a composition of Ce0.25Zr0.25Al0.5Ox performed best (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). As the previous studies had been performed with relatively high Pd loading, the effect of varying the loading was initially assessed. This showed that setting the Pd loading below 5% did not increase the activity of the catalyst to a satisfactory level. On the other hand, Pd loadings greater than 5% resulted in improved activity but also affected selectivity of the material.

Of all the materials tested, 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx performed the best and was chosen for further investigation and optimization. We examined the activity of this catalyst over a range of temperatures (450–600 °C). As can be seen in Table 1, the conversion progressively increased as the reaction temperature was increased. However, operation at higher temperatures (i.e., above 500 °C) adversely affected the product selectivity, which lowered the yield toward propene, leading mostly to formation of undesirable byproducts (i.e., CH4 and CO).
Furthermore, we studied the activity of the 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx catalyst under reducing conditions (i.e., in the absence of CO2), and we refer to this as thermal dehydrogenation. The activity of the catalyst decreased rapidly during the first 1.5 h of reaction, although there was a small decrease in the selectivity toward propene (Figure 1). The decrease in conversion can be related to the consumption of reactive oxygen species stored within the support, which play a significant role in the first few minutes of the reaction. As these unselective species are likely to be electrophilic, we suggest that they are singly charged interstitial oxide ions. Because the reaction was performed in the absence of oxidant, both the interstitial oxygen species and the oxygen vacancies formed in the ceria lattice cannot be refilled from the gas phase; therefore, direct dehydrogenation comes into play. As described earlier, the catalyst will behave differently in the presence of an oxidant. It is known that CO2 will dissociate on the ceria surface, forming CO and selective oxygen species, which then are capable of refilling oxygen vacancies and thus further facilitating the dehydrogenation reaction. Such a cycle has a positive effect on the product selectivity, as only the selective oxygen species are involved in further reaction. This hypothesis was tested by exposing the catalyst to He and C3H8 and then examining if the activity of the material could be restored by reoxidation with CO2. As can be seen in Figure 1, not only was the activity of the catalyst restored but also there was also a significant improvement in catalyst selectivity. Under ODH conditions, propene is the main product with CH4 as the second and only detectable byproduct. A full reaction profile of reactions 1 and 2 are shown in the Figures S2 and S3 in the Supporting Information.

Propane conversion and propene selectivity during thermal dehydrogenation (37% C3H8, 67% He; open symbols □, ○) and subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation (37% C3H8, 37% CO2, 26% He; filled symbols ■, ●) after treatment of the 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx catalyst with CO2; Reaction conditions: GHSV = 6000 h–1, T = 500 °C.
After showing that the catalytic activity can be restored by treatment in the presence of CO2, we performed a subsequent experiment. First, we carried out the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 and then further exposed the catalyst to either CO2 or He, before repeating the ODH reaction to investigate how the intermediate “regenerative” treatment influenced catalyst activity (Figure 2).
Figure 2

More specifically, two identical batches of the catalyst were prepared and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. With the first batch of catalyst, after 1.5 h of the ODH reaction, the gas inlet was switched to pure CO2 and the catalyst was oxidized in this environment for 2.5 h. Then, the gas flow was changed back to C3H8, CO2, and He and the second reaction cycle was performed. In the case of the second batch, after the first ODH reaction, the gas inlet was changed to pure He. The rest of the steps remained the same as for the first batch. Figure 2 shows that, under oxidizing conditions, the catalytic activity can be restored, while treatment under reducing conditions did not improve the performance of the material. It is also noteworthy that the activity of the catalyst in the second cycle after contact with CO2 reached a level similar to that of the first cycle, suggesting that full reactivation of the catalyst had taken place. In addition, the selectivity of the catalyst was improved on moving from reaction 1 to reaction 2. In reaction 1, the initial selectivity to propene was 87.8%, while after CO2 treatment it reached 94%.
The stability of the catalyst is a major issue in the commercial operation of propane dehydrogenation processes. (34) Most current technologies, which are based on direct (nonoxidative) dehydrogenation, are performed at higher temperatures to achieve cost-effective yields of propene, but this can lead to rapid deactivation of the catalysts through coking. Therefore, in order to maintain a stable yield of propene, the commercial processes require a number of supplementary operations: e.g., addition of steam to the gas feed (to suppress coking), frequent regeneration of the catalyst, continuous partial replacement of the catalyst, or a rising profile for the operating temperature. (35) Nonetheless, the commercial catalysts generally exhibit relatively short lifetimes, up to a maximum of 3 years. (2)
We have therefore tested our materials for extended periods to observe any changes in catalytic activity. In our investigation, we focused on the selectivity profile, since it became quite apparent that the selectivity improves within time on stream. The 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx catalyst exhibited high stability over 140 h of reaction at 500 °C, as shown in Figure 3. Selectivity to propene clearly improved during the reaction, whereas the C3H8 conversion significantly decreased during the first 1 h of reaction. This is consistent with our interpretation above that unselective oxygen is initially consumed from the catalyst, followed by CO2 dissociation on the catalyst surface, resulting in the formation of selective oxygen species which are subsequently consumed in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. Kovacevic et al. have reported a similar observation on studying the effect of morphology on a CeO2 ODH catalyst in the presence and absence of CO2. (20) They found that exposure to CO2 initially led to overoxidation due to the presence of excess oxygen species triggering the formation of a byproduct before reaching stable activity. In our case, it is interesting to note that a gradual decrease in activity to the 4% conversion level was observed, and then relatively stable activity was maintained until the end of the 140 h test. This implies that our 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx catalyst underwent changes not only during the first 1 h of the reaction but also during the remaining period of the test. To further understand this aspect, we performed detailed characterization of the “fresh” and “140 h used” material.

Structural Characterization of the Catalysts
We have carried out detailed textural and structural characterization in order to understand the promoting effect of Pd on the CeZrAlOx material. BET surface area data of the fresh and used Pd impregnated CeZrAlOx catalysts are presented in Table 2. The surface area of the 5%Pd/CeZrAlOx catalyst decreased by 41%, whereas a more substantial change was found for the sample after 140 h of testing with the surface area having decreased by 68% in comparison to the fresh catalyst (Table 2). Nevertheless, the relatively high retained surface area of the used catalyst may partially explain the stability of the material over the course of the catalytic reaction. After the catalyst had been used for 140 h and then reoxidized in CO2, a significant increase in surface area was recorded. This suggests that treatment with CO2 is needed to restore catalyst activity and may be related to the removal of deposited carbon from the material. The fact that the surface area measured over the 140 h used and reoxidized sample exceeded the area of fresh sample must be assigned to the error in analysis, estimated to be ±5%.

XRD analysis of the catalysts revealed the CeZrAlOx material to have a disordered character (Figure 4). This was the expected outcome of the preparation method, in which metal acetylacetonates precursors are mixed and undergo a calcination step that leads to the acetylacetonates being oxidized and converting to a mixed-metal oxide form. XRD analyses of the material after impregnation with Pd show relatively broad and low-intensity peaks consistent with a modified fluorite-type CeO2 structure. A lack of highly crystalline phases might be indicative of a high fraction of mobile lattice oxygen in the catalyst. When a used sample (after 4 h reaction) was analyzed, some weak additional CeO2 reflections (at 2θ values of 28.64 and 46.99°) were apparent in the XRD pattern. Palladium was detectable in its ionic form in the fresh catalyst by the presence of peaks at 2θ values of 33.9, 54.7, and 60.2°, which correspond to the (101), (112), and (200) reflections of PdO. The average PdO crystallite size was calculated to be relatively large at 17.4 nm. Furthermore, in the used sample, the PdO reflections were no longer visible but were replaced by peaks at 2θ values of 40.3, 47.8, and 68.4° which correspond to the (111), (200), and (220) reflections of fcc Pd metal (mean crystallite size calculated to be 48.4 nm).

Since XRD showed that there was an absence of long-range order in the bulk of CeZrAlOx, we used XAFS to probe the local structures of the fresh and used samples of CeZrAlOx and Pd/CeZrAlOx, concentrating on the Zr-K, Pd-K, and Ce-L3 edge. First, the Zr K-edge data were studied to determine the local structure of Zr and to determine if a solid solution of ceria and zirconia was present in the initial and used catalysts. Figure S4 in the Supporting Information shows the k3-weighted fittings for the Zr K-edge and the corresponding Fourier transforms derived from CeZrAlOx, Pd-CeZrAlOx, and used Pd-CeZrAlOx materials. Given that the 1:1 Ce:Zr composition of the samples should result in a tetragonal CeZrO2 type phase according to well-reported phase diagrams, (36,37) the data were fitted with a model proposed by Prado and co-workers with two different Zr–O distances, indicative of Zr4+ being in a distorted-tetragonal structure. (38) The rationale for such a fitting is corroborated by the presence of a pre-edge feature (1s to 4d) in the Zr K-edge XANES in all samples (Figure S4), which is sensitive to centrosymmetric distortions, as would exist in tetragonal ZrO2. (38,39) However, it was noted that the pre-edge feature was less pronounced than that in a tetragonal ZrO2 standard, which possibly indicates the presence of some other ZrO2 character.
Further analysis of the Zr–O first shell fit and comparison with a crystalline tetragonal ZrO2 standard suggest that the sample is more complex in nature. The calculated Zr–O(2) bond length for CeZrAlOx, fresh Pd-CeZrAlOx, and used Pd-CeZrAlOx materials can be seen to be notably shorter than in the crystalline tetragonal ZrO2. Fitting of crystalline monoclinic ZrO2 can also be performed with two Zr–O distances (Zr–O(2) represents the average distance of square-planar oxygens and Zr–O(1) those of triangular coordination in a Zr coordination polyhedron), (40) and it was found that, when this model was used, the calculated Zr–O(2) length was comparable with that of all the CeZrAlOx samples. Therefore, on the basis of first shell fitting, the samples seem to have a character that is more monoclinic than tetragonal. As seen from the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the EXAFS data of crystalline monoclinic and tetragonal phases, the clearest defining difference between the two structures is in the difference in Zr–Zr distances: at 3.46 and 4.01 Å for the monoclinic structure and 3.62 Å in the tetragonal structure.
However, the disordered nature of Zr species in the catalysts, evident from the lack of definable Zr–Zr distances within the Fourier transform data, resulted in no realistic second shell fitting being possible. Given the lack of long-range order and nonideal ZrO2 bond lengths it is best to describe the sample as being disordered with respect to Zr. Previously reported disordered ZrOx supported on Al2O3 has been found to have EXAFS features comparable to those reported here for the CeZrAlOx catalysts, specifically monoclinic such as first shell Zr–O distances and no observable Zr–Zr distances.
Therefore, the reduction in the pre-edge feature could be associated with the local disorder as opposed to the presence of Zr in a cubic structure. Importantly, no notable changes in Zr XANES or EXAFS data were observed between the fresh and used catalysts (Figures S4 and S5 in the Supporting Information), showing that this level of disorder was retained throughout the reaction.
Unfortunately, due to the close proximity of the Ce L3 and other L edges, extended k data could not be acquired for Ce and so only limited EXAFS analysis was possible. The first shell Ce–O was fitted to EXAFS data for CeZrAlOx, fresh Pd-CeZrAlOx, and used Pd-CeZrAlOx material after 4 h reaction time (an insufficient range in usable k data prevented analysis of the 140 h used catalyst). EXAFS fitting considered the presence of multielectron excitations, (29) which if not accounted for has been shown to give reduced Ce–O distances. However, even when multielectron excitations were taken into account, the Ce–O distances observed in all catalyst samples were notably shorter at 2.26(2) Å than those seen in CeO2 at 2.34 Å. Shortened Ce–O bond lengths have previously been observed and used as evidence for Ce–Zr–O solid solutions. (41) However, in tetragonal or cubic solid solutions the literature reports first shell EXAFS models having coordination numbers (CN) of 8, while all catalysts prepared in this study had a notably lower CN of ca. 4.5 (Table 3). L3 Ce EXAFS of nanoparticular CeO2 (ca. 2 nm) has been shown to have a lower first shell CN of 6 and Ce–O distances between 2.28 and 2.34 Å. (42) The low CN demonstrates that the local Ce structure is highly disordered according to EXAFS, as with the Zr edge data, and therefore it is difficult to attribute the reduced Ce–O distances to being associated with a solid solution.

Despite the disorder seen from the EXAFS, the Ce L3 edge XANES of the CeZrAlOx catalysts (Figure 5) was clearly identifiable as being CeO2 with varying Ce3+ content. Ce-L3 edge XANES was therefore used to ascertain the Ce3+/Ce4+ content in CeZrAlOx prior to addition of Pd (Figure 5a), in the fresh Pd-CeZrAlOx material (Figure 5b) and in the catalyst after 4 and 140 h time online (Figure 5c,d, respectively). The XANES of Ce4+ in CeO2 is characterized by two white lines arising from many-body final state effects associated with hybridization of Ce 4f and O 2p states. (43) The peak at 5740 eV corresponds to a 2p4f05d1 final state (peak A in Figure 5), while an excitation to 2p4f15d1L (where L denotes a O 2p ligand hole) final state is associated with split peaks at 5732 and 5730 eV (peaks B1 and B2 in Figure 5). (27) The splitting of this to a 2p4f15d1L final state is due to crystal field effects. Furthermore, a low-intensity peak located at 5722 eV can be assigned to an excitation to a delocalized final state at the bottom of the conduction band of CeO2 (peak C in Figure 5). In addition to these features which are present in all samples, a band at 5728 eV associated with Ce3+ can be seen. The Ce3+/Ce4+ content was determined from the spectral weight of Gaussian fitted peak areas and the concentration of Ce3+ reported in Table 5. Given the closeness in energy position of B2 and the Ce3+ white line, the Ce3+ contents of 6% and 8% for fresh CeZrAlOx and Pd-CeZrAlOx are considered to be effectively the same within fitting error. As the reaction with propane progresses, the determined Ce3+ content increased to 23% at 4 h time online and then further increased to 47% at 140 h, clearly demonstrating bulk reduction of the catalyst support during reaction.

In addition, Pd K-edge EXAFS (k3 EXAFS) FT data and fitting results are shown in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information and Table 4, respectively. These clearly show that the PdO present in the fresh Pd-CeZrAlOx catalyst is reduced to metallic Pd during reaction. The evidence for PdO is constituted by the clear Pd–O distance at 2.01 Å, which is entirely absent from the samples analyzed after 4 and 140 h online. In addition, the Pd–Pd distances shorten from those characteristic of PdOx in the fresh sample to that of fcc Pd metal in the used samples. Also clear from the EXAFS fitting data is an increase in Pd coordination number with time online, which is associated with a growth in Pd particle size during the reaction.

Additionally, XPS analyses of the fresh, used, and reoxidized 5%Pd/CeZrAlOx samples were performed (Table 5 and Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). For the fresh sample, surface Pd is confirmed as being present in an oxidized form (PdO), and most (ca. 90%) of the Ce exists in the higher (4+) oxidation state. In the used catalyst, after the reduction, the Pd had been converted into its metallic form, with the cerium undergoing partial reduction. These results are in the full agreement with the XAFS analysis. When the reaction was performed for 140 h, even more Ce3+ was present than in the 4 h used catalyst. According to XANES analysis, 47% of the cerium present in the sample is in the 3+ valence state, while from XPS analysis it is only 26.5%. This discrepancy between the numbers can be assigned to the two techniques analyzing at different levels, with EXAFS analyzing all the sample whereas XPS is surface sensitive. In the sample reoxidized with CO2, it was noted that the palladium is once again present as PdO and to the cerium predominantly as Ce4+. This would suggest that the coexistence of Pd and Ce in oxidized forms is beneficial for the ODH reaction. Additionally, Pd and Ce must be involved in the catalytic cycle, as their presence is crucial in catalyzing the reaction. XPS analysis also revealed that reoxidation by CO2 does not completely restore the same balance of Ce4+ to Ce3+ as was found in the fresh sample.

The acid–base properties of the metal oxide catalysts are expected to play a pivotal role in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. (44) Higher basicity on the catalyst surface prevents side reactions by facilitating easier desorption of desired alkenes, avoiding further reactions. CO2 is activated on the acidic sites via the lone pair on the oxygen atom to form a unidentate or bidentate complex. (14) The correct balance between basic and acidic sites is therefore extremely important in activating CO2 and propane. Since the catalyst tested contains CeO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3, both types of sites are expected to be present in the material. To obtain information concerning the acidic and basic properties of our 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx catalysts, NH3 and CO2-TPD experiments were carried out. The CO2 and NH3-TPD profiles of Pd/CeZrAlOx support are presented in Figure S8 in the Supporting Information. Regarding NH3-TPD, most of the NH3 desorption occurs between 200 and 500 °C (Figure S8a in the Supporting Information), indicating the presence of both medium and strong acid sites, respectively. The medium-strength sites are more likely to be associated with the presence of CeO2 and ZrO2, while strong acidic sites can probably be assigned to Al2O3. (45) The total amount of NH3 consumed was 2.52 mmol gcat–1.
In terms of CO2-TPD, three different types of basic sites can be distinguished in Figure S8b in the Supporting Information. Clear weak basic sites are seen below 200 °C (A), followed by a strong signal for CO2 desorption at 395 °C, which can be assigned to medium/strong basic sites (B). In addition, a strong desorption peak is visible between 700 and 800 °C, clearly demonstrating the presence of strong basic sites (C). The total CO2 uptake for the analyzed catalyst was determined to be 3.48 mmol CO2 gcat–1.
TPR provided information on the sample reducibility and the influence of palladium on the redox properties of the support. We analyzed the reduction properties of CeZrAlOx and compared it with those of 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx. As presented in Figure 6a, two major reduction peaks were observed for CeZrAlOx. The reduction peak at 474 °C was assigned to reduction of Ce4+ at the surface, while that at 633 °C corresponds to the reduction of Ce4+ and Zr4+ in the bulk. (46) Corresponding TPR analysis of the 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx sample showed that the presence of Pd shifts the reduction temperature of surface Ce4+ sites to lower values, implying that a strong interaction between Pd and the support is occurring. Further analysis of the TPR pattern indicated that signals at 81 and 89 °C could be assigned to PdO particles supported on the CeZrAlOx.

TPR analysis of the CeZrAlOx and 5%Pd/CeZrAlOx catalysts: (a) experimentally determined TPR profiles; comparison of experimental and simulation TPR profiles in (b) the 60–220 °C temperature range (5% Pd/CeZrAlOx), (c) the 220–440 °C temperature range (5% Pd/CeZrAlOx), and (d) the 320–680 °C temperature range (CeZrAlOx).
As shown in Table 6, for the reduction of the supported PdO particles (peaks 1 and 2), the values for the parameter n in the kinetic expression for the Sestak–Berggren function (47) were calculated to be 0.4 and 1.3, respectively (see Temperature-programmed reduction: simulation of experimental data in the Supporting Information). This indicates that, for the lower temperature TPR peak, the reduction of the PdO is the rate-limiting step, whereas for a higher temperature peak, the H2 adsorption is the rate-limiting step. (48) For both peaks, a γ value of 0 indicates that reduction is occurring on either very small PdO particles or the edge of already largely reduced metallic particles, as the activation energy does not change with an increasing quantity of Pd0. It can be assumed that the Pd metal is acting as a promoter for the reduction of the PdO in both cases, but at higher temperatures the removal of oxygen from the PdO lattice is easier. Peaks 4 and 5 can be assumed to be reduction of CeZrAlOx support particles that are on the boundary between the reduced Pd particles, as the peak appears at a temperature lower than one would expect the reduction of the bare CeZrAlOx support to occur, but at a temperature higher than one would expect PdO to still exist. (49) This is also supported by the low value derived for m (average 0.3) and the 0 value for γ in the kinetic expression. The low m parameter indicates that the reduction process is largely unaffected by the reduced material, as Pd0 would be the site performing the H2 dissociation, and the 0 value of γ indicates that the reduction is within close proximity to the active site. When the higher temperature peaks are studied (peaks 6–9), which have been assigned to reduction of bare CeZrAlOx, the decrease in corresponding reduction temperature for the 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx catalyst indicates that Pd is playing a role in the reduction of bare CeZrAlOx. This hypothesis is supported by the increase in the m parameter in peak 6 in comparison to peak 8, the decrease in the n parameter, and the lower temperature of reduction. As the previous peak has been assigned to CeZrAlOx surrounding the reduced Pd particles, it can be hypothesized that the Pd facilitates the reduction of the CeZrAlOx either by an electronic metal–support interaction or by hydrogen spillover.

Electron Microscopy Analysis
Electron microscopy studies were used to understand the nature and distribution of the Pd component in the 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx catalyst in the fresh, 4 h used, and used/reoxidized state. In the fresh state, HAADF-STEM imaging shows that the Pd-containing phase exists as a highly uniform dispersion of 3–5 nm particles on the complex mixed oxide support (Figure 7a). Atomic resolution HAADF images of these nanoparticles in profile view (e.g., Figure 7b) show them to be consistent with the tetragonal PdO phase. XEDS mapping (Figure S9 in the Supporting Information) also shows that the Ce, Zr, and Al species are uniformly distributed in the support particles down to the nanometer scale. Such observations are in agreement with the Raman analysis, which shows no discrete crystalline ZrO2 phases or indication of Ce–Zr phase separation (Figure S10 in the Supporting Information). (50) After 4 h of use in the ODH reaction, HAADF-STEM imaging showed that the form of the Pd-containing particles had changed significantly (Figure 8a). The number density of these particles had dropped dramatically due to sintering, and their size now spanned the 5–30 nm size range. Lattice image analysis showed that they had completely converted to the fcc metallic Pd phase (Figure 8b) in agreement with the previous XRD analysis (Figure 4).

A sample of the used 5%Pd/CeZrAlOx catalyst after it had undergone a reoxidation process in CO2 was also analyzed by electron microscopy. In this case it was not possible to use HAADF-STEM analysis to unambiguously distinguish the Pd-containing part from the underlying CeZrAlOx support by mass contrast (Figure 9a). Instead, we resorted to secondary electron imaging (Figure 9c), local XEDS point spectra (Figure 9b), and complementary XEDS mapping (Figures 9d–g) in the SEM to pick out the Pd-containing particles. This allowed us to determine that the Pd-containing component was now dispersed as large (20–50 nm) PdO particles over the CeZrAlOx support (once again in agreement with the XRD analysis shown in Figure 4b).

TAP Reactor and DRIFT Studies To Elucidate the Role of CO2 in the Reaction Mechanism
As described above, our tests with CO2 present in the gas feed improved the selectivity of the reaction to propene. When dehydrogenation was performed in the absence of oxidant, the selectivity to methane was relatively high. This indicates that oxygen species from catalyst were consumed in the initial process, resulting in the fragmentation of the dehydrogenation product: i.e., propene. Simultaneously, oxygen vacancies formed during the initial step could not be refilled, as there was no oxidant available in the gas stream. We also showed that, when a reduced catalyst was treated in a flow of CO2 at 500 °C, the catalytic activity increases, suggesting that oxygen vacancies have somehow been replenished with oxygen, facilitating further reaction. This can be rationalized by CO2 dissociation on the reduced CeZrAlOx surface, forming CO and additional oxygen species, the latter of which can refill oxygen vacancies. The replenishment of the oxygen species should be therefore independent of the presence of Pd species, since it is mostly related to the oxygen storage capacity of ceria.
To confirm the dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst surface, CO2 was pulsed over reduced CeZrAlOx and 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx catalysts using a TAP reactor.
The experiment was first performed at room temperature, and it was found that CO2 irreversibly binds to both materials. It was also found that 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx was able to dissociate CO2 to form CO (Figure 10), whereas CeZrAlOx was not (Figure 11), indicating that Pd facilitates the formation of CO at lower temperatures. When the experiment was repeated at a higher temperature (400 °C), a stronger CO response was detected in both cases, demonstrating that CO2 was being dissociated more readily at the higher temperature. The increased temperature also caused the CO2 adsorption to become reversible, causing the CO2 response to increase (Figures 10 and 11).

Our TAP experiments clearly show that CO2 dissociation on a reduced catalyst surface is possible and that CO species are formed. However, the TAP experiment was performed under high-vacuum conditions; therefore, to ensure that the data could be related to the use of the materials at atmospheric pressure, we performed complementary DRIFTS analysis of the 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx. The catalyst was first reduced at 400 °C for 4 h in the presence of 5% H2/Ar and was then divided into two identical batches. The first batch of catalysts was placed in the DRIFTS sample holder, and N2 was flowed over it at 340 °C (Figure 12a). The flow was then changed to 1% CO/N2, and further scans were taken. From the data shown in Figure 12b, it was found that CO was adsorbed in a linear mode on Pd2+/Pd0, giving a characteristic band at 2150 cm–1. In addition, a strong band at 1934 cm–1 is visible, which is assigned to bridging CO adsorption on metallic Pd. The second batch of the reduced catalyst in this experiment was exposed to CO2. It was first heated to 340 °C in N2, and then the flow was changed to 1% CO2 in N2. DRIFTS spectra (Figure 12c) show characteristic bands at 2144 and 1932 cm–1, as in the previous experiment with CO gas. Although the bands are weaker than those in the experiment involving CO, they can be easily distinguished in the spectrum, suggesting that CO2 had dissociated on the surface of the catalyst to form CO, which interacted further with palladium, giving rise to this strong characteristic signal in the DRIFTS spectra.

Figure 12. DRIFTS analysis of the 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx catalyst performed in the presence of (a) N2 only, (b) 1% CO/N2, and (c) 1% CO2/N2.
As expected, a similar experiment performed on the fresh (nonreduced) CeZrAlOx support did not lead to CO2 dissociation (Figure S11 in the Supporting Information). It is thus important to consider the role of Pd in CO2 dissociation. The literature contains reports speculating that ceria alone can dissociate CO2 to CO without the presence of noble metals. (51) On the other hand, it was reported that when reduced ceria dissociates some CO2 to maintain a highly oxidized state, migration of O species coming from the ceria–zirconia material toward the active catalytic phase would alter the oxidation state of the palladium, improving catalytic activity. (23) It is possible that CO2 adsorbs on the peripheral interface sites between Pd and the metal oxide, rather than on Pd only. It has been reported previously that, depending on the synthesis techniques and conditions, Pd can be stabilized as ionic species in CeO2, forming a palladium–ceria interaction phase. (52) Indeed, our TPR analysis suggests a close interaction between Pd and CeO2, supporting the above hypothesis.
As has been stated previously, propane interaction with CO2 can follow different reaction pathways, among which (i) the direct dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) route and (ii) the direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) route are the major ones. In addition, dry reforming of propane, propane cracking, and hydrogenolysis reactions may take place. (44) Quantification of the amount of H2 formed in the overall reaction gives a general idea about the relative contributions from the two major reaction pathways. The obtained volume of H2 was therefore used to calculate the quantity of C3H6 formed in the direct dehydrogenation reaction (TDH), in which propene and hydrogen are formed in equimolar ratios and do not participate further in the reverse water-gas-shift reaction. On the basis of this calculation, the contribution of direct dehydrogenation to the overall propene formation was ∼44%. Furthermore, by subtracting the volume percent of C3H6 generated from TDH from the overall amount of C3H6 formed, we estimated the quantity of propane that originates from the oxidative dehydrogenation and direct dehydrogenation coupled with the reverse water-gas-shift reaction. These two reactions account for ∼56% of all propene formed.
It has previously been proposed that propane ODH using CO2 can proceed either via a direct dehydrogenation route coupled with the RWGS reaction or alternatively via one-step oxidative dehydrogenation. (25) However, the data presented here are consistent with a pathway that includes aspects of both the MvK mechanism and the RWGS reaction. In order for the reaction to follow the MvK mechanism, it needs to possess certain favorable redox properties. In particular, the formation of oxygen vacancies on and near the surface of mixed metal oxides generates active sites and provides a pathway for the transport of lattice oxygen ions. As the number of oxygen vacancies is related to the reducibility of the material, it is often assumed that the number can be calculated from the volume of hydrogen consumed during TPR. (53) Following this line of reasoning, we calculated that the amount of readily accessible oxygen present in the Pd/CeZrAlOx accounted for 8% of all the oxygen available in the fresh catalyst. However, this does not provide a direct measure of the potential number of oxygen vacancies, because it includes the nonselective (interstitial) oxygen species that are consumed during the initial period of the reaction. Collectively, our results indicate that the presence of Pd promotes both the formation of oxygen vacancies and their replenishment with selective (nucleophilic) oxygen ions.
Interestingly the CO2/CO mass balance was consistently 100 ± 2% during ODH over the Pd/CeZrAlOx, which suggests minimal deposition of carbon on the catalyst during the reaction. This was supported by elemental analysis of the used catalyst after 4 h of reaction, which showed that the amount of retained carbon was equivalent to only 3.7% of all the converted propane. Additional TGA analysis showed that, even after 140 h of reaction, the amount of carbon deposition was very low (Figure S12 in the Supporting Information). These results imply that an additional function of the Pd is to suppress carbon deposition on the catalyst by enhancing the mobility of the surface oxygen or by promoting the reverse-Boudouard reaction (eq 2).

Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The role of CO2 as a soft oxidant in the dehydrogenation of alkanes over reducible metal oxides has previously been attributed to its ability either (i) to reoxidize the reduced surface as part of an MvK reaction mechanism or (ii) to consume the hydrogen released by direct dehydrogenation through the RWGS reaction. These two pathways have previously been thought to be mutually exclusive. It is worth noting that the RWGS reaction may also proceed by a redox mechanism. (54,55) Our results indicate that, in ceria-based catalysts such as CeZrAlOx, the MvK and RWGS mechanisms can be linked by a common step. We propose that lattice oxygen ions abstract hydrogen from the reactant alkane molecules to form the product alkene and H2O, while the CO2 replenishes these selective oxygen species, releasing CO into the gas phase (see Figure 13). Although the byproducts (CO and H2O) are also the products of the RWGS, this route to alkenes does not require the stepwise formation of H2 as an intermediate. The high selectivity to the desired alkene can be explained by the exclusive formation of fully reduced oxygen ions when CO2 dissociatively adsorbs at surface oxygen vacancy sites. In contrast, the adsorption of O2 is known to lead to the formation of transient electrophilic oxygen species (such as adatoms, O2–, O–) before O2– ions are formed. (56) Although these electrophilic species are generally short-lived, they account for the formation of CO2 (and any CO) when O2 is used as the oxidant. (57)

Figure 13. Representative scheme of the reactions involved in the overall ODH process.
The ability of Pd to increase the oxidation activity of redox metal oxide catalysts is well-known (58) and correlates with the observed enhanced reducibility and reoxidation of the metal oxide surface. (59) This rapid cycle of creating surface oxygen vacancies and then refilling them from the gas phase prevents the rate of the catalytic reaction becoming limited by the transfer of lattice oxygen ions. (60) However, when O2 is the oxidant, the presence of Pd promotes the rate of both the selective and nonselective oxidation reactions. By way of contrast, our results demonstrate that, when CO2 is used as the oxidant, the presence of Pd has the critical function of increasing conversion without sacrificing selectivity to propene.

Figure 7. Representative STEM-HAADF images of the fresh 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx catalyst: (a) lower magnification image showing ultrasmall (3–5 nm) Pd-containing particles (highlighted by the white arrow) in profile view on a CeZrAlOx support particle; (b) higher magnification DF-lattice image highlighting one of the particles. The inset shows the Fourier transform obtained from the particle marked with an arrow, which matches the tetragonal PdO structure (reference ICSD 647283) viewed along the [100] zone axis.

Figure 8. Representative STEM-HAADF images of the “4 h used” 5%Pd/CeZrAlOx catalyst: (a) lower magnification image showing 5–30 nm Pd-containing particles dispersed on the CeZrAlOx support; (b) higher magnification BF-lattice image of one of the supported particles. The inset shows the Fourier transform obtained from the area highlighted, which matches the fcc structure of metallic Pd (reference ICSD 648680) viewed along the [110] zone axis.
Figure 9
Figure 9. Representative STEM-HAADF image, SE image, and XEDS spectra and maps of the “4 h used and reoxidized in CO2” 5% Pd/CeZrAlOx catalyst: (a) HAADF image showing that any Pd-containing particles, which in this sample will be reoxidized, are difficult to distinguish from the CeZrAlOx support by mass contrast; (b) XEDS point spectra acquired from the regions labeled 1 and 2 in the secondary electron image shown in (c), showing that region 1 corresponds to an ∼50 nm Pd-containing particle; corresponding (d) Ce, (e) Al, (f) Zr, and (g) Pd XEDS maps of the area shown in (c), confirming that the Pd is now dispersed as large (20–50 nm) PdO particles over the CeZrAlOx support.
