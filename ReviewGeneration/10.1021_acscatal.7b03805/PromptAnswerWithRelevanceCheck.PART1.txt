<quotes>

[1] "The activity of the support was compared with that of fully formulated catalysts containing palladium. The Pd/CeZrAlOx material exhibited long-term stability and selectivity to propene (during continuous operation for 140 h), which is not normally associated with dehydrogenation catalysts."  

[2] "From temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2 it was found that the catalyst possessed both acidic and basic sites. In addition, temperature-programmed reduction showed that palladium promoted both the reduction and reoxidation of the support."

[3] "When the role of CO2 was investigated in the absence of gas-phase oxidant, using a temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor, it was found that CO2 dissociates over the reduced catalyst, leading to formation of CO and selective oxygen species."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article investigated how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of the CeZrAlOx metal oxide affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It found the Pd/CeZrAlOx catalyst exhibited long-term stability and high propene selectivity, attributed to the presence of both acidic and basic sites. TPR showed Pd promoted reduction and reoxidation of the support. TAP experiments showed CO2 dissociates over the reduced catalyst to form CO and selective oxygen species.

</English version answer>  

<Chinese version answer>

2. 文章研究了调节CeZrAlOx金属氧化物的氧化态、氧的运动能力以及酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。结果发现Pd/CeZrAlOx催化剂表现出长期稳定性和高丙烯选择性,这被归因于同时存在酸性和碱性位点。TPR结果显示Pd促进了载体的还原和再氧化。TAP实验显示CO2在还原催化剂表面发生解离,形成CO和选择性氧化物种。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "We have therefore tested our materials for extended periods to observe any changes in catalytic activity. In our investigation, we focused on the selectivity profile, since it became quite apparent that the selectivity improves within time on stream." 

[2] "The ability of Pd to increase the oxidation activity of redox metal oxide catalysts is well-known (58) and correlates with the observed enhanced reducibility and reoxidation of the metal oxide surface. (59) This rapid cycle of creating surface oxygen vacancies and then refilling them from the gas phase prevents the rate of the catalytic reaction becoming limited by the transfer of lattice oxygen ions."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. The article proposes that the mechanistic pathway involves creating oxygen vacancies on the metal oxide surface during dehydrogenation, and CO2 dissociatively adsorbing to refill those vacancies with selective oxygen species and release CO. This rapid redox cycle prevents the rate becoming limited by oxygen ion transfer. The improved selectivity over time suggests unselective oxygen species are consumed initially.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

3. 文章提出机理路径涉及在脱氢过程中在金属氧化物表面产生氧空位,然后CO2发生解离吸附以用选择性氧化物种重新填充这些空位并释放CO。这种快速的氧化-还原循环防止了反应速率被氧离子转移所限制。随时间改善的选择性暗示最初消耗了非选择性氧化物种。

[1] "We propose that lattice oxygen ions abstract hydrogen from the reactant alkane molecules to form the product alkene and H2O, while the CO2 replenishes these selective oxygen species, releasing CO into the gas phase."

[2] "Although the byproducts (CO and H2O) are also the products of the RWGS, this route to alkenes does not require the stepwise formation of H2 as an intermediate." 

[3] "The high selectivity to the desired alkene can be explained by the exclusive formation of fully reduced oxygen ions when CO2 dissociatively adsorbs at surface oxygen vacancy sites."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

7. The article proposes a mechanistic pathway where lattice oxygen abstracts hydrogen from alkane molecules to form alkene and H2O, while CO2 replenishes the selective oxygen species and releases CO. This avoids intermediate H2 formation compared to RWGS. Selectivity is explained by CO2 dissociatively adsorbing at vacancies to form fully reduced oxygen ions.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

7. 文章提出了以下机理pathway:晶格氧从烷烃分子中吸出氢形成烯烃和H2O,同时CO2补充选择性氧化物种并释放出CO。与RWGS相比,这避免了H2的中间体形成。选择性的形成是由CO2在空位发生解离吸附形成完全还原的氧离子来解释的。

[1] "In this study, a CeO2ZrO2Al2O3-based material, which was synthesized by a mechanochemical route, was found to be highly selective and durable in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) using CO2 as a soft oxidant." 

[2] "Our results indicate that, in ceria-based catalysts such as CeZrAlOx, the MvK and RWGS mechanisms can be linked by a common step."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. The article proposes that the CeZrAlOx catalyst promotes propane dehydrogenation through a combination of the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) and reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) mechanisms. It suggests CO2 dissociates on the catalyst surface, generating CO and selective oxygen species that refill oxygen vacancies. The oxygen ions then abstract hydrogen from propane to form propene, while the RWGS reaction consumes hydrogen and shifts the equilibrium.

[1] "Reducible metal oxides capable of activating CO2 at lower temperatures could be potential candidates for this reaction."

[2] "The activity of ceria is attributed to its oxygen storage/release capacity (OSC), which is dependent upon the creation and replenishment of oxygen vacancies." 

[3] "The number of potential oxygen vacancies can be further increased and stabilized by the addition of ZrO2."

[4] "The presence of Al2O3 increases the total surface area of the catalyst, which also has been reported to influence catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that reducible metal oxides like ceria that can activate CO2 at lower temperatures are good candidates. The oxygen storage capacity of ceria from creation of oxygen vacancies is key. Adding ZrO2 increases potential oxygen vacancies, while Al2O3 increases surface area. These compositional effects tune oxidation state, oxygen mobility and acid-base properties to influence performance.
