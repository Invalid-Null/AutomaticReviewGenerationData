[1] "Reducible metal oxides capable of activating CO2 at lower temperatures could be potential candidates for this reaction."

[2] "The activity of ceria is attributed to its oxygen storage/release capacity (OSC), which is dependent upon the creation and replenishment of oxygen vacancies." 

[3] "The number of potential oxygen vacancies can be further increased and stabilized by the addition of ZrO2."

[4] "The presence of Al2O3 increases the total surface area of the catalyst, which also has been reported to influence catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes."

2. The article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that reducible metal oxides like ceria that can activate CO2 at lower temperatures are good candidates. The oxygen storage capacity of ceria from creation of oxygen vacancies is key. Adding ZrO2 increases potential oxygen vacancies, while Al2O3 increases surface area. These compositional effects tune oxidation state, oxygen mobility and acid-base properties to influence performance.

2. 该文献研究了调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧的迁移性和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它显示出可以在较低温度下活化CO2的可还原金属氧化物(如硅酸铈)是很好的候选材料。硅酸铈氧缺陷的形成导致的氧储存容量是关键。添加ZrO2增加潜在的氧缺陷,而Al2O3增加表面积。这些组成效应调谐了氧化态、氧的迁移性和酸碱性,从而影响性能。

[1] "It is believed that the reaction can occur via a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, which involves the participation of lattice oxygen ions as the selective oxygen species and oxygen vacancies as the adsorption sites."

[2] "The alternative two-step route is the direct dehydrogenation of the alkane coupled with the reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS) reaction."

[3] "These two routes account for 56% of all propene formed."

3. The article proposes two main mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. One is a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involving lattice oxygen as the selective species and oxygen vacancies as sites. The other is direct dehydrogenation coupled with the reverse water-gas shift reaction. The data shows the RWGS route accounts for 56% of propene formed.
