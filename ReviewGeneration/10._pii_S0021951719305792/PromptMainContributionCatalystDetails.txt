Abstract
Co-based catalysts are promising alternatives to replace Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) in view of the catalytic activity for C–H bond activation, low cost, and low toxicity. However, the reduction of unstable CoOx species and coke deposition cause serious catalyst deactivation. In this work, a sheet-shaped Co–Al2O3 catalyst comprising of isolate Co2+ sites shows a high intrinsic activity (specific reaction rate > 16 mmol g−1 h−1) and catalytic stability in highly selective PDH reaction (>97% C3H6 selectivity). Extensive characterization demonstrates that the tetrahedral Co2+ isolated site is stabilized by the γ-Al2O3 matrix, facilitating propylene desorption to inhibit formation of coke and other byproducts and to free the active Co sites.

1. Introduction
Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [1], [2], [3], [4]. The increasing global demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene. The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst [5]. For Pt-based catalysts, the electronic modification by promoters and the specific interaction with the optimized supports lead to the enhancement in both catalytic activity and stability [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process. Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24].
Low-coordinate cobalt species (Co+/Co2+) are known to be efficient in C–H activation for hydrocarbons [25]. It has been reported that the oxygen-deficient cobalt/oxygen cluster ions could accomplish the dehydrogenation of isobutane via the insertion into the C–H bond with formation of the [CoxOx-1C4H8]+ intermediates [26]. The isotopic labelling kinetics of Co+-catalyzed C–H and C–C activation of C3H8 show a remarkable dependence on the electronic state of Co+ cation adducts [27]. The activation of C–H and C–C bonds and H2/CH4 elimination favored the Co+ with the exited-state rather than with the ground-state [28]. Co2+ ion-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst is capable of C3H8 activation; however it also reveals fast reaction rates of C–C cracking pathways [29], [30]. Nearly 80% propylene selectivity could be obtained on a mesoporous CoAl2O4 spinel catalyst in the PDH reaction, whereas the rapid deactivation was observed [31]. The optimal catalytic performance of 21.5% C3H6 yield was achieved on a 5 wt% Co/Al2O3 catalyst [32]. Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory C3H6 selectivity of 83.6% indicated that the co-existence of the diverse Co active sites on the surface of Al2O3 support that caused significant side reactions. This is partly due to the lacking of structure-control on the Co sites. Modified spinel Co3O4 has shown good activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, however, it can be easily reduced to metallic Co0 species during the anaerobic PDH reaction, causing the C–C cracking and formation of significant methane and C2 molecules [33], [34]. Therefore, exposure of stabilized and active surface Co sites with a single state still remain as a key challenge for facilitating both catalytic selectivity and stability in Co-catalyzed PDH reaction [35].
Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability. For instance, the coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites present on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites to anchor atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites [36], [37]. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, leading to an enhanced activity and stability in PDH reaction [38]. The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support [39]. This PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst displayed an excellent performance at an ultrahigh space velocity in a long-term PDH reaction. In addition to being an appropriate support, the hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 showed a high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as the surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene [40]. Furthermore, the diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction. It is therefore desirable to tailor the structure of Co2+ and Al2O3 composites for improving the catalytic performance in the PDH reaction.
Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction. The structural and catalytic stabilities as well as the Co–Al2O3 interaction for these catalysts are benchmarked to an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. We further illustrate the effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in the Co-catalyzed PDH reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The γ-Al2O3 sheets were synthesized according to a previously reported hydrothermal procedure with minor modifications. The formation of the shaped boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)) precursor with the aid of urea is regard as the key to control the sheet-like morphology of the resultant catalysts [41]. 6.44 g of Al(NO3)3·9H2O and 9.4 g of urea (CO(NH2)2) were dissolved in 190 mL of deionized water to form a homogeneous solution under vigorous stirring for 15 min. The solution with a pH of approximately 4 was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and then maintained at 100 °C for 48 h. After natural cooling, the white precipitate was filtered and then washed with deionized water and anhydrous alcohol several times. The powder was dried at 100 °C overnight and calcined in air at 600 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 1 °C/min to obtain the γ-Al2O3 sheets.
All Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts were prepared using the same hydrothermal procedure except of the addition of Co precursor salt. Urea was used as the precipitating agent and the certain molar ratio of Co and Al was adjusted by changing the dosages of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O. Typically, the molar ratio of urea to total metals (Co+Al) was approximately 9:1. The synthesis of 5 wt% Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst as the reference catalyst was followed the incipient wetness impregnation method. The diluted Co(NO3)2 solution was incipient impregnated into the γ-Al2O3 sheet support. The sample was maintained at room temperature for 2 h and then dried at 70 °C overnight. All the Co catalysts were finally obtained by the calcination in air at 600 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 °C/min.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance (UV–Vis–DR) spectra were recorded from 250 to 900 nm on a Lambda 950 spectrometer (PerkinElmer) equipped with a 150 mm integrating sphere. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected between 10° and 80° in 2θ value on a Bruker AXS D8 Focus diffractrometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were performed on a JEOL JEM 3010 instrument operated at 300 kV. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping were carried out on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN system operated at 200 kV. The metal ratios of Co/Al in all catalysts were quantified using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Avio 200, PerkinElmer). Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a TGA 2 (Mettler Toledo) with a raising rate of 10 °C/min in air for coke measurement.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained on an Escalab250Xi electron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with monochromatic 150 W Al Kα radiation, and the binding energy was referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The peak fitting is on the basis of the constraints as follow: the two doublet peaks and the two satellite peaks have the equal peak width, respectively. The Co 2p3/2 level peak with a binding energy (BE) of 780.9–781.7 eV and the Co 2p1/2 level peak with a BE of 795–706 eV are the characteristic of the octahedral Co3+ species of Co3O4. The Co 2p3/2 level peak with a BE of 779.5–780.3 eV and the Co 2p1/2 level peak with a BE of 795–706 eV are attributed to the tetrahedral Co2+ species.
27Al magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance III 400 equipped with 89 mm wide-bore 9.4 T superconducting magnets in 4 mm rotors at Larmor frequencies of 104.3 MHz. Single pulse 27Al MAS NMR spectrum was acquired at a spinning speed of 14 kHz and 1.0 s recycle delay. 27Al chemical shifts were referenced to 1 M Al(NO3)3 at 0 ppm.
Ex-situ Co K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) experiments were performed in transmission mode on the XAFCA beamline of the Singapore Synchrotron Light Source. The collected data was analyzed by by the IFEFFIT software package package follow the standard protocol [42]. EXAFS oscillations χ(k) were extracted from normalized spectrum and then Fourier transformation was performed in Athena to obtain k2-weighted r-space data. The r-space spectra were fitted in Artemis. The fitting window in k space is 3–11 Å−1 while in r-space is 1–3 Å. The amplitude reduction factor So2 was obtained from the fitting for Co foil, assuming the coordination number of the first shell scattering atoms is 12. Then So2 was constrained as a constant in the following data fitting for the Co K edge spectrum from samples. The coordination number (CN), distance and Debye-Waller factor (σ2) were used as fitting variables.
Temperature programmed analyses were performed on a chemisorption analyzer (AutoChem 2920, Micromeritics) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) or a mass spectrometry (MS) detector (QGA, Hiden Analytical Ltd.). For temperature programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR), 150 mg of sample was pretreated at 400 °C for 2 h and cooled down to 100 °C under 30 mL/min of Ar stream. The sample was reduced by a 10% H2/Ar mixture gas (30 mL/min) in the temperature range of 100–900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min for the signal recording. For temperature programmed desorption of propylene (C3H6-TPD), 50 mg of catalyst was pretreated in Ar (30 mL/min) at 400 °C for 120 min and cooled to 50 °C. Subsequent absorption of propylene gas (99.99%, 10 mL/min) was lasted for 30 min and the system was then purged with Ar for 60 min. The catalyst was heated to 900 °C at a constant rate of 10 °C/min in Ar to collect the signal. 50 mg of sample was used in temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and first pretreated in Ar stream (30 mL/min) at 400 °C for 120 min. When the catalyst cooled to 50 °C, NH3 was adsorbed for 30 min with 10% NH3/N2 (20 mL/min) and the gas was then switched to Ar to remove the physically absorbed NH3. The signal of NH3-desorption was recorded with heating sample at a rate of 10 °C/min in 30 mL/min of Ar.
2.3. Catalytic tests
Catalytic PDH reaction was performed on a fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure. The inner diameter of the quartz tubular reactor is 10 mm. Catalyst (0.15 g) with 30–60 mesh was diluted with 0.15 g of quartz sand, loaded in the middle of the reactor. The catalyst was pretreated in N2 from room temperature to 590 °C at 15 °C/min and kept for 30 min for reaching the steady state and removing the impurities. For the PDH reaction, the molar ratio of C3H8:H2:N2 was 1:0.8:3.2 with the total flow rate of 20 mL/min. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was 2.9 h−1. To study the diffusion effect, 0.15 g or 0.30 g of catalyst with 40–50 mesh and varied flow rates were used. Based on the calculation result by ChemOffice software, the thermodynamical equilibrium conversion was 51.5% under used reaction conditions. An online gas chromatograph equipped a TCD detector channel with a 3 m TDX-1 column and a flame ionization detector (FID) channel with a KB-Al2O3 capillary column (60 m × 0.32 mm × 10 mm) was used to analyze the products including N2, C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, C2H6, C2H2, CH4, CO and CO2. The conversion of propane, selectivity to propylene, and turnover frequency (TOFCo) were determined from the following equations:
where i represents the hydrocarbon products in the effluent gas, ni is the number of carbon atoms of component i, Fi is the corresponding flow rate, t is the reaction time, nin(C3H8) is the total number of C3H8 in the feeding gases, and NCo is the number of total Co atoms in the catalyst. If we convert the coke weights to reacted C3H8 moles, the contribution of coke is less than 0.05% in all cases. Therefore, the effect of coke on the evaluation of catalytic performances is ignored in this work.
For the coke removal and the catalyst regeneration in recycling tests, the reused catalyst was oxidized in 30 mL/min of O2 at 500 °C, and then purged in 30 mL/min of N2 or post-reduced in 30 mL/min of H2 at 590 °C.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structures of Al2O3 sheets supported Co catalysts
Two kinds of Co-based catalysts on γ-Al2O3 sheets, Co–Al2O3–HT and Co/Al2O3-IMP, are prepared by one-step hydrothermal procedure and incipient witness impregnation, respectively. The similar Co loadings with approximately 5 wt% for both catalysts are clarified with ICP-OES results. The structural differences between these two Co catalysts are firstly investigated using detailed characterizations.
The TEM images reveal the sheet-like morphology for these two catalysts. Individual nanoparticles with 5 nm disperse on the Al2O3 sheets for Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, as shown in Fig. 1A. Nonetheless, only nanosheets with <6 nm in thickness but no nanoparticles are found in Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst (Figs. 1B and S1 in Supporting Information). Highly homogeneous distribution of Co, Al and O elements in Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst is further demonstrated by EDX elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 1C-F). This results indicate that the one-step hydrothermal synthesis added with Co salt cannot change the sheet-like shape of Al2O3 matrix. The BET surface areas of bare Al2O3 support and two Co catalysts are also measured and listed in Table 1. A slightly decreased surface area is obtained on Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst (174 m2 g−1) compared to Al2O3 support (226 m2 g−1) and Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst (230 m2 g−1), due to the impregnated deposition of Co3O4 nanoparticles on the surface of Al2O3 sheets.

The UV–Vis–DR spectra (Fig. 2A) provide the structural information of Co species in these two catalysts. A board absorption band with the maximum peaks at approximately 543, 578 and 630 nm are observed on Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst, which are associated with ν3 (4A2 →4T1(P)) transition characteristic of the pseudo-tetrahedral Co2+ species [43], [44]. For Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, the peaks of Co2+ species are insignificant, and broad adsorption bands at ca. 405 and 690 nm are emerged. These two bands are assigned to the ligand-metal charge-transfer of O2– →Co2+ and O2– →Co3+ in spinal Co3O4, which is agreement with the pattern of the reference sample of commercial Co3O4 particles (Fig. S2). This result suggests the existence of Co3O4 phase on the Al2O3 surface in Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst [45], [46].

Fig. 2. (A) UV–Vis–DR spectra and (B) XRD patterns of fresh and spent Co–Al2O3–HT (HT) and Co/Al2O3-IMP (IMP) catalysts.
Fig. 2B shows representative XRD patterns of as-prepared Al2O3 sheet support, Co–Al2O3–HT and Co/Al2O3-IMP catalysts, and Table S1 in Supporting Information summarizes the comparative results. The diffraction peaks of Al2O3 sheet support match well with the pattern of γ-Al2O3 phase (PDF#29-0063). For Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst, no significant peak shift is observed (<0.1° shifts compared to γ-Al2O3 phase), and neither metallic Co0 phase nor Co oxide is found, implying high dispersion of isolate Co sites. For Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, the peak shift toward low-angle is obviously observed. For instance, the peak positions of 31.2°, 36.7° and 59.4° are markedly lower than 32.0°, 37.2° and 60.5° which are corresponding to (220), (311) and (511) peaks of γ-Al2O3 support, respectively. The position of these peaks of Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst is close to that of spinel Co3O4 phase (PDF#78-1970) and CoAl2O4 phase (PDF#44-0160). Although these two phases have similar characteristic diffraction peaks, we expect that Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst consists of γ-Al2O3 phase coexisted with Co3O4 particles rather than with CoAl2O4 species. The conclusion is supported by the following experimental evidences. A weak peak at 55.6° is exclusively observed on the pattern of Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, which is assignment to the (422) plane of Co3O4 phase (Fig. 2B and Table S1). The UV–Vis spectrum of Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst displays a typical Co3O4 pattern but not the feature of spinel CoAl2O4 with Co2+ ions. The high dispersion of nanoparticles, which is confirmed by the TEM images, also suggests that the Co atoms cannot completely embed into Al2O3 matrix to form CoAl2O4 structure. Therefore, Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst possesses separated phases of Co3O4 nanoparticles and γ-Al2O3 sheets.
Fig. 3A presents the XPS spectra of Co 2p electronic levels in two Co catalysts. No peaks corresponding to the metallic Co0 state is observed on both Co catalysts. All Co 2p core-level spectra are deconvoluted into four individual contributions, including two spin-orbit doublets of Co2+ and Co3+ at Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, as well as two satellite peaks. The peak fitting results suggest that the Co species on the Co–Al2O3–HT surface mainly exist as Co2+ state (Co2+/Co3+ = 92/8). The Co3+ species dominates over the Co2+ species on the Co/Al2O3-IMP surface with the Co2+/Co3+ratio of 44/56 that is slightly higher than that in spinel Co3O4 (Table 1).

The XANES analyses (Fig. 3B) of these two Co catalysts provide the information on the oxidation state and the geometry of the Co sites. The Co K-edge pattern of Co–Al2O3–HT is close to the CoO but far from the Co3O4 reference. A pre-edge peak located at 7709.4 eV and a shoulder peak located at 7719.3 eV are also observed, which are typically corresponding to the tetrahedral coordination of Co2+ in CoAl2O4 structure [33], [47]. In contrast, the photon energy at Co K-edge in Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst shifts to a higher value, and the peak energy reaches 7729.0 eV, which is identical to that of Co3O4 standard sample. The pre-edge peak at 7710.1 eV suggests the octahedral environment of Co3+ sites in Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst [48].
The 27Al MAS NMR spectra after the normalization with the intensity (Fig. 3C) provides the coordination of Al3+ species in various catalysts. The signals of both tetrahedral Al3+ (Al3+tetra, at 63 ppm) and octahedral Al3+ (Al3+oct, at 5 ppm) coexist in the spectra [36], [37], [49]. As summarized in Table 1, the ratio of Al3+tetra to Al3+oct in Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst is comparable to that in bare γ-Al2O3 sheet support, indicating that the deposition of Co3O4 species do not affect the intrinsic crystal structure as well as the coordination distribution of γ-Al2O3. However, the relatively lower ratio of Al3+tetra to Al3+oct is obtained on Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst, because the tetrahedral Co2+ species occupy the Al3+tetra sites. A higher lattice energy of octahedral Al3+ sites results in its high stability in the Al2O3 structure, limiting the substitution of Co2+ for Al3+oct [50]. In addition, a similar coordinate environment allows that the substitution of tetrahedral Co2+ for Al3+tetra occurs easily.
The difference in Co-related coordinate structures between these two Co catalysts is further studied by Co K-edge EXAFS spectra (Fig. 3D). The Fourier transform moduli are limited to the first shell of neighbors (up to R = 4.0 Å) and the corresponding fits for both Co catalysts are listed in Table 2. A typical Co3O4 pattern appears for Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst with a strong peak (label A at R = 1.5 Å) for the first shell Co–O coordination (CN = 4.9) and a dual-peak (label B and C) of different Co–O–Co coordinations (CN = 2.3 and 3.4). The peak B is ascribed to the environment of two adjacent octahedral Co sites with 2.87 Å distance, while peak C is contributed to the scattering between Co ions in tetrahedral and octahedral sites (3.35 Å aside) [51]. A first shell Co–O coordination with the distance of 1.98 Å was obtained on Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst. The corresponding CN number is 4.4, which is remarkably lower than the average number of spinel Co3O4 phase, suggesting that tetra-coordinated Co species dominate over hexa-coordinated Co species in Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst. In addition, particularly evident peak shifts in the R range of 2.5–3.5 Å is observed compared to Co3O4 and Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. These signals are also significantly different from the CoO phase (R = 2.6 Å) and the spinel CoAl2O4 phase (R = 3.2 Å) [33]. Combining the results of UV–Vis and 27Al NMR characterizations, a structural model of Co2+-substituted γ-Al2O3 is built, the simulated spectrum fits well with the EXAFS experimental data. The isolated Co2+ ion is embedded in the γ-Al2O3 matrix to form a local spinel structure, occupying a Al3+tetra site. Two kinds of bridged Co–O–Al bonds connecting tetrahedral Co2+ and octahedral Al3+ with different bond angle and distance (3.00 and 3.49 Å) make the primary contribution to the dual-peak scattering signal. Above detailed characterization results provide the structural information of these two Co-based catalysts, which the aggregated Co3O4 nanoparticles are supported on the γ-Al2O3 nanosheets in Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, while tetrahedral Co2+ sites are isolated in thin γ-Al2O3 nanosheets in Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst.

3.2. Performances of Co-catalyzed PDH reactions
The catalytic performances of Co–Al2O3–HT and Co/Al2O3-IMP in the PDH reactions with a WHSV of C3H8 of 2.9 h−1 at 590 °C are displayed Fig. 4A. It should be noted that the bare γ-Al2O3 support is inactive for the PDH reaction, which the C3H8 conversion and the C3H6 selectivity are 0.8% and 73%, respectively. For the first 5 h on reaction stream, the satisfactory selectivity of C3H6 is maintained at >97.1% and >94.6% over Co–Al2O3–HT and Co/Al2O3-IMP catalysts, respectively. A small amount of the byproducts includes ethylene, ethane and methane. The C3H8 conversion of Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst slightly decreases from 24.8% to 21.1% (specific rate: 4.5–3.9 μmol g−1 s−1) in 5 h reaction duration. In contrast, the conversion over Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst drops from 21.2% to 13.9% (3.9–2.6 μmol g−1 s−1) in 5 h. A higher TOFCo of 0.093 s−1 can be obtained under kinetic region, and a smaller deactivation rate constant of 0.06 h−1 quantitatively demonstrates its better stability compared to Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst (0.16 h−1). The C3H8 conversions of less than 10% are obtained by changing the space velocity in the temperature range between 550 and 610 °C for plotting the Arrhenius dependences of these two Co-based catalysts (Fig. 4B). The apparent activation energy (Ea) of Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst is 168.9 kJ/mol, which is lower than that of Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst (206.7 kJ/mol). These values are lower than that of Pt-based catalysts but similar to that of Ru/ZrO2-based catalysts [24], [52], [53].

For Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst, the nanosheets with relatively smaller thickness and larger surface area can allow more active Co2+ sites exposed on the catalyst surface, leading to enhanced PDH activity. It is also worth emphasizing that the mass-transfer and the diffusion kinetics cannot be limited by thin nanosheet structure [39], [54], [55]. The PDH reaction is carried out on the sheet-shaped Co catalyst at different gas flow rates but constant contact time (constant W/F ratio), and similar C3H8 conversions are obtained in six runs, as shown in Fig. 5A. The elimination of the mass transport limitations is also supported by the linear relation between C3H8 conversion and W/F value in the diffusion experiments (Fig. 5B). In addition, a high C3H6 selectivity and a low degree of C–C cracking and coking can be achieved on these Co catalysts, as compared to the most frequently reported Pt- and Cr-based catalysts (Table S2). In-situ reduction of CoOx species to metallic Co0 in the reductive PDH reaction environment leads to the formation of CH4 via C–C cleavage [32], [56]. In this study, no metallic Co0 exists in the fresh and the spent catalyst based on the characterization results, supporting the fact that almost no CH4 is produced in the PDH reactions over our Co catalysts.

3.3. Characterizations of the spent catalysts
In spite of similarly high C3H6 selectivity (94–97%), the long-term stability is distinct for these two Co catalysts, which is determined by the different structures of Co sites interacted with γ-Al2O3 sheet. The characterizations of spent Co/Al2O3-IMP and Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts are performed to shed further light on the correlation between the catalytic stability and the catalyst structure. The XRD patterns (Fig. 2B) show that the phase of γ-Al2O3 and its crystal size for these two catalysts are well-maintained in a 5 h dehydrogenation reaction. For Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst, neither Co-related phases of metal and oxide nor deposited carbon species is observed, implying the excellent structural stability of embedded Co2+ sites in the γ-Al2O3 sheet support. Such structural stability is further evidenced by the triplet peaks of the isolated tetrahedral Co2+ species in the UV–Vis–DR spectrum of the spent Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst (Fig. 2A). The stable Co2+ local coordination and oxidation state are also reflected on the XANES Co K-edge spectrum and the XPS Co 2p spectrum, as shown in Figs. 3B and S3. The 27Al NMR spectrum of the spent Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst in Fig. 3C displays that there is no obvious difference in the ratio of Al3+tetra to Al3+oct between the fresh and the spent catalysts, suggesting stable coordination environment of Co2+-containing Al2O3.
However, the structure of Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst dramatically changes during the PDH reaction. The diffraction peaks of Co3O4 including (4 2 2) peak at 55.6° disappears from XRD pattern (Fig. 2B), indicating that the atomic rearrangement of unstable Co3O4 species on the of γ-Al2O3 sheet surface occurs under the reductive reaction atmosphere. The UV–Vis–DR spectrum of the spent Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst displays a triplet signal of the isolated tetrahedral Co2+ species rather than a dual-band signal of Co3O4 species that appears in the fresh sample (Fig. 2A), revealing the change of Co3+-to-Co2+ in Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst during the PDH reaction. However, the great majority of reduced Co species cannot embed into the matrix to form spinel CoAl2O4 structure, because the ratio of Al3+tetra to Al3+oct from 27Al NMR spectrum (Fig. 3C) is 0.32 for the spent Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, which is close to that of pure Al2O3 sheet support (0.35). In the Co K-edge XANES spectrum in Fig. 3B, a slight shift of rising-edge line toward low-energy is observed. The spectrum also shows a relatively stronger absorbance at 7710–7715 eV in pre-edge region, which is assignment to metallic Co species, as shown in the insert in Fig. 3B. In addition to the feature of first-shell Co–O coordination at R = 1.5 Å, the characteristic signal of metallic Co species with Co–Co coordination at R = 2.2 Å (label D) is also reflected on the Co K-edge EXAFS spectrum (Fig. 3D) of the spent Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. These results strongly demonstrate that both Co3+-to-Co2+ and Co3+-to-Co0 transformations occur during the PDH reaction over Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. As with the large-size metallic Co particles, these in-situ generated and highly dispersed metallic Co species can also cause severe C–C cracking and coking issues on Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst [32], [56], [57]. As expected, obvious diffraction peaks of deposited coke species (the (0 0 2) and (0 0 4) planes of graphite carbon locate at 26.6° and 54.8°) arise on the XRD pattern of the spent Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. The coke amounts are further quantified by TGA analyses. As shown in Fig. 6A, the coke amount on Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst is 28.5%, remarkably larger than 4.4% on Co-Al2O3-HT catalyst. Therefore, both serious coke deposition and Co3O4 restructure result in rapid deactivation of Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. A superior catalytic stability of Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst is benefited from the stable isolated Co2+ site and the great anti-coke capability. The catalytic effects with these two respects would be discussed independently in the following sections.

3.4. Stabilization of Co2+ site and desorption of C3H6
The stabilization of active Co2+ sites on the catalyst surface during the PDH reaction might be due to the strong interaction between Co2+ site and the γ-Al2O3 sheet support. The reduction behavior of oxidative Co species in these two Co/Al2O3 catalysts is investigated by H2-TPR characterizations (Fig. 6B). The TPR curve of commercial Co3O4 particles as the reference reveals three consecutive peaks located at 350–500 °C, which are corresponding to the sequential reduction of Co3O4 to metallic Co via CoO [57], [58], [59]. The reduction temperatures of Co3O4 species in Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst are 478, 579 °C and 833 °C. These reduction temperatures are significantly higher than that of Co3O4 reference, suggesting that the CoOx species strongly interact with the γ-Al2O3 sheet to inhibit reduction. Different reduction curve is obtained on Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst. A single broad peak exists at 678 °C, which is attributed to the reduction of surface CoO species that strongly interacted with the support by significant anchoring effect [59], [60], [61]. Considering that the temperature beyond 800 °C is usually ascribed to the reduction of spinel CoAl2O4 species [32], [57], the lack of reduction peak at such high temperatures indicates that the bulk CoOx species inside Al2O3 matrix are still not be reduced. This result confirms that the surface Co2+ species in Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst are stable at the PDH reaction temperature of 590 °C, and cannot be further reduced into metallic Co0 species that lead to the CH4 formation.
The C3H6-TPD profiles (Fig. 6C) show that the starting temperature for the C3H6 desorption is 50 °C and 75 °C for Co–Al2O3–HT and Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, respectively. The maximum C3H6 desorption occurs at 80 °C and 125 °C for these two catalysts, respectively. The easier C3H6 desorption from Co–Al2O3–HT surfaces suppresses further transformation of the electron-rich C3H6 into byproducts especially coke during the reaction, therefore maintaining the excellent selectivity and extending the catalyst lifetime [39], [62], [63]. Furthermore, the facile C3H6 desorption quickly release the active Co2+ sites for devoting these “free” sites to activate C–H bond of C3H8 that serves the key step of PDH reaction, and consequently enhances the catalytic performances.
The NH3-TPD profiles provide the information about the strength and the amount of the surface acidic sites in these two Co catalysts, as shown in Fig. 6D. Similar integral area for the NH3 desorption peaks is observed, indicating the equal total acid content on these two catalysts. However, the NH3 can be completely desorbed from Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst at a relatively lower temperature, compared with Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst (ca. 600 °C vs 700 °C). The results suggest that Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst has a slightly larger content of the weaker acid sites in contrast to Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. The low-coordinate Al3+ of Al2O3 is normally responsible for coke formation by serving as the acid site [50], [64], [65]. The substitution of tetrahedral Al3+ with Co2+ in Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst reduces these acid sites to suppress the coke deposits, and thus promotes the catalytic stability in the PDH reaction.
The Co2+ sites stabilized by γ-Al2O3 matrix in Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst shows superior activity against deactivation during the PDH reaction, which is benefited from the strong metal-support interaction, whereas Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst leads to a dramatic deactivation. In addition, the facile desorption of C3H6 from the catalyst surface with lower acidity not only accelerates the catalytic PDH reaction rate, but also largely inhibits the side reactions especially the coke formation for satisfactory propylene selectivity and long-term stability.
3.5. Regeneration behaviors of catalysts
Based on the understanding on the structural information of Co–Al2O3–HT and Co/Al2O3-IMP catalysts before and after PDH reaction, their regeneration behaviors are further investigated independently. Similar deactivation curves in recycling reaction runs are observed on Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, as shown in Fig. S4. Its regeneration process not only includes the removal of large amounts of coke species, but the redox circle of Co-related species also occurs on the catalyst surfaces. Such redox process of surface Co species determines that the catalytic activity of the regenerated catalyst can recover to the initial level without reduction with H2 before next reaction run. However, unstable Co species on the catalyst surface may ultimately embed into Al2O3 matrix to form comparatively stable Co2+ active sites after several reaction runs, leading to similar catalytic properties with Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst. For the regenerated Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst, the post-reduction is necessary to renew originally high activity. Fig. 7A displays a near 10 h climbing stage for pre-activating the regenerated Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst without post-reduction, whereas Fig. 7B reveals the absence of such pre-activation stage for the regenerated Co–Al2O3–HT catalyst with post-reduction. During its regeneration process, there may be a strong trend to form “Troy” Co2+ sites in locally stable structure of CoAl2O4 spinel by Co2+–Al2O3 matrix interaction under the high-temperature oxidizing atmosphere. Although the releasing of these Co2+ sites to the catalyst surface can be achieved under the reductive reaction atmosphere consisting of C3H8 and H2, a long time duration needs to be spent due to the weak status in the competition with PDH reaction. However, the migration of inner Co2+ species toward the surface can be rapidly completed for their exposure during the post-reduction process, which is supported by significantly increased relative intensity of tetrahedral Co2+ signal reflected on UV–Vis–DR spectra in Fig. S5. These results demonstrate again that to recreate surface Co2+ sites by optimized regeneration procedure is critical for enhancing Co-catalyzed PDH performance.

3.6. Co2+–Al2O3 interactions at regulated Co loadings
Compared with supported Co3O4 particles in Co/Al2O3-IMP, the isolate Co2+ sites anchored in Al2O3 sheet benefits the catalytic PDH performance over Co–Al2O3–HT. Further optimization might be achieved by increasing the active Co2+ sites in the γ-Al2O3 sheet. Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts with 2–15 wt% Co loadings are prepared by the same hydrothermal strategy and the Co–Al2O3 interactions in these catalysts are also carefully examined. UV–Vis–DR spectra (Fig. 8A) reveal that only sharp triple-peaks of tetrahedral Co2+ sites are observed on 2–7 wt% Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts. The weak Co2+ signal is reflected on 10 wt% and 15 wt% Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts, and the peaks corresponding to Co3+ species are also recognized, indicating the co-existence of Co2+ and Co3+ species in the Co-rich Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts. The XRD patterns (Fig. 8B) demonstrates the phase separation between γ-Al2O3 and Co3O4 in 7–15 wt% Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts. The results of UV–Vis and XRD analyses suggest that the tetrahedral Co2+ species dominate in 2–7 wt% catalysts, while Co2+ species and Co3O4 particles co-exist in 10–15 wt% catalysts. The XANES and XPS spectra also reveal that the Co2+/Co3+ ratio gradually decreases with increasing Co loading in Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts (Figs. 8C, S6 and Table 1). It is expected that Co species energetically prefer self-assembly to form oxide nanoparticles on the support surface beyond the maximum capacity of sheet matrix to anchor the isolated Co2+ sites. The aggregation is verified with 27Al NMR results, the relation between the Al3+tetra/Al3+oct ratio and the Co loading displays a reverse volcano variation trend (Fig. 8D and Table 1). The EXAFS spectra (Fig. 8E and Table 2) also clarify that the isolated Co2+ species with Co–O–Al bonds exist in the low-Co-content Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts and the aggregated Co3O4 species with Co–O–Co bonds dominate in the high-Co-content catalysts.

The state of Co species determines their interaction with Al2O3 support, as well as the PDH performance. The H2-TPR profiles (Fig. 8F) demonstrate that the reducible species are hardly observed on 2 wt% catalyst, indicating a strong interaction of single-site Co2+ with Al2O3 sheet. Two peaks corresponding to the Co3O4 reduction shift towards low temperature, and their intensities increase with raising Co loadings of 7–15 wt%, suggesting that the formed Co3O4 nanoparticles weakens the interaction with the support.
Satisfactory C3H6 selectivities (93–98%) are obtained on all Co catalysts in the PDH reactions (Fig. 9). The specific reaction rate varies with the Co loadings in Co–Al2O3–HT catalysts. The maximal activity and stability are obtained on 7 wt% catalyst with a specific rate of 5.5 μmol g−1 s−1 and a lowest kd value of 0.05 h−1. A higher TOFCo of 0.144 s−1 can also be achieved on 7 wt% catalyst under kinetic region. Larger kd values of 0.13 and 0.12 h−1 are observed on 10 wt% and 15 wt% Co catalysts (Table 1), which are equal to that of some supported Pt catalysts [7], [66], [67], [68]. The serious deactivation of the high Co loading catalysts is caused by the coking (59.5% coke in the spent 15 wt% catalyst from TGA result in Fig. S7) and restructure of Co3O4 species, which is consistent with the observations on 5 wt% Co/Al2O3-IMP as discussed early. The presented coke deposit and disappeared Co3O4 phase are simultaneously observed on XRD patterns of spent 10–15 wt% catalysts (Fig. S8). A small amount of coke deposit is found on 7 wt% catalyst and no evident structural change is observed on 2–5 wt% catalysts. These results highlight the effect of Al2O3 sheet support on the stabilization of isolate Co2+ active sites via a strong interaction, not only preventing the reconstruction of surface Co species during the reaction but also inhibiting the formation of coke deposits.

4. Conclusions
In summary, PDH catalysts composed of γ-Al2O3-sheet-stabilized isolate Co2+ sites are prepared in the present study. Reaction testing and extensive characterizations of the catalysts reveal their excellent structural stability and the strong interaction of Co with the support. In the PDH reaction, this catalyst displays a high specific activity with >97% C3H6 selectivity and a superior coke resistance compared to Al2O3-supported Co3O4 nanoparticle catalyst. The facile C3H6 desorption can effectively inhibit the side reactions of C–C cracking and coke formation for enhancing the selectivity and the stability in PDH reaction.
