<Answer>

 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the literature that directly address the questions asked. The article is focused on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using cerium oxide-based catalysts and hydrogen chloride. It does not provide substantial background on propane dehydrogenation in general, compare different catalyst classes, discuss computational studies, kinetic modeling, or structure-activity relationships for this reaction.
