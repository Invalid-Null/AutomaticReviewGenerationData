 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that directly address any of the questions asked. The article focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using cerium oxide-based catalysts in the presence of hydrogen chloride. It does not discuss catalyst preparation methods for optimizing metal dispersion, encapsulation, or isolated single sites in zeolite supports. Nor does it utilize advanced characterization techniques to study metal-support interfaces or oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation. The article also does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.
