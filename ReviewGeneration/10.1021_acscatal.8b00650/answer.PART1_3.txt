<quotes>
[1] "We propose that the surface Cl•-like species prefers to react with C3H8 rather than to couple and desorb into gas phase in the presence of C3H8. Therefore, we propose that the surface reaction between Cl•-like species and C3H8 is the main path for the formation of C3H6."

[2] "The C3H7• intermediate may be transformed into C3H6 via a direct path by removing another H atom with an energy barrier of 1.0 eV (Figure 12a). The indirect path via C3H7Cl can also produce C3H6 (Figure 12b). In this path, C3H7Cl is first formed by coupling C3H7• and Cl• radicals without energy barrier, followed by dehydrochlorination."

[3] "We propose that oxygen is adsorbed on the O-vacancy site on CeO2 surfaces, forming O22 species and the O22 species oxidizes Cl into Cl•-like species, which accounts for the activation and selective conversion of C3H8 to C3H6."

Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the CeO2 and NiO-CeO2 catalysts studied. It describes the key reaction steps involving Cl• radical species reacting with propane to form a C3H7• intermediate, which can then lose a hydrogen atom to form propylene directly or via a C3H7Cl intermediate followed by dehydrochlorination. The active sites are proposed to be oxygen vacancy sites where O2 adsorbs and forms O22 species that activate HCl to generate the Cl• radicals.

答:文章为所研究的CeO2和NiO-CeO2催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢的机制情景。它描述了关键的反应步骤,Cl•基与丙烷反应生成C3H7•中间体,后者可以直接失去一个氢原子形成丙烯,或者经过C3H7Cl中间体后发生脱氢氯化反应生成丙烯。活性位点被认为是氧空位,O2在此吸附形成O22物种,激活HCl生成Cl•自由基。
