</Chinese version answer>

<quotes> 
[1] "We propose that the surface oxygen vacancy and the surface chloride coverage are two crucial factors determining the activity and selectivity."

[2] "We speculate that an active chlorine species, possibly a Cl•-like species, is generated from HCl, which accounts for the selective conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 on our CeO2-based catalysts." 

[3] "The C3H7• intermediate may be transformed into C3H6 via a direct path by removing another H atom with an energy barrier of 1.0 eV. The indirect path via C3H7Cl can also produce C3H6."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article does propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. It suggests oxygen vacancies and surface chloride species play key roles. It proposes active chlorine radicals are generated from HCl, which activate propane to form allyl radicals. These can be converted to propylene either directly or via propyl chloride intermediate.  
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:这篇文章确实提出了在所研究的金属氧化物催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机制场景。它认为氧空位和表面氯化物种起关键作用。它提出活性氯自由基从HCl生成,激活丙烷形成烯丙基自由基。这些可以直接转换成丙烯,或者通过丙基氯中间体转化成丙烯。

<quotes>
[1] "We propose that the surface Cl•-like species prefers to react with C3H8 rather than to couple and desorb into gas phase in the presence of C3H8. Therefore, we propose that the surface reaction between Cl•-like species and C3H8 is the main path for the formation of C3H6."

[2] "The C3H7• intermediate may be transformed into C3H6 via a direct path by removing another H atom with an energy barrier of 1.0 eV (Figure 12a). The indirect path via C3H7Cl can also produce C3H6 (Figure 12b). In this path, C3H7Cl is first formed by coupling C3H7• and Cl• radicals without energy barrier, followed by dehydrochlorination."

[3] "We propose that oxygen is adsorbed on the O-vacancy site on CeO2 surfaces, forming O22 species and the O22 species oxidizes Cl into Cl•-like species, which accounts for the activation and selective conversion of C3H8 to C3H6."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the CeO2 and NiO-CeO2 catalysts studied. It describes the key reaction steps involving Cl• radical species reacting with propane to form a C3H7• intermediate, which can then lose a hydrogen atom to form propylene directly or via a C3H7Cl intermediate followed by dehydrochlorination. The active sites are proposed to be oxygen vacancy sites where O2 adsorbs and forms O22 species that activate HCl to generate the Cl• radicals.
</English version answer>  

<Chinese version answer>  
答:文章为所研究的CeO2和NiO-CeO2催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢的机制情景。它描述了关键的反应步骤,Cl•基与丙烷反应生成C3H7•中间体,后者可以直接失去一个氢原子形成丙烯,或者经过C3H7Cl中间体后发生脱氢氯化反应生成丙烯。活性位点被认为是氧空位,O2在此吸附形成O22物种,激活HCl生成Cl•自由基。
