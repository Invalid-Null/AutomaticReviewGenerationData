To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the text answers from each file to the correct answers. I labeled an answer as 100% consistent if it conveyed the same meaning and information as the correct answer, and 0% consistent if it provided completely different or contradictory information.

For most questions, all answer files matched the correct answers. However, for question 3, only answer2.txt provided a fully consistent response, while the other files stated the article did not discuss the topic at all. So I marked those 0% consistent compared to the detailed correct answer.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
