 Unfortunately the provided answers do not contain relevant information to directly address the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation. As the answers indicate, the referenced article focuses on a different reaction - oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using O2 and HCl. It does not provide substantial details on the background, mechanisms, catalysts, thermodynamics, kinetics, computations, or structure-activity relationships pertaining to thermal catalytic propane dehydrogenation. Therefore, I will not attempt to extract non-existent quotes or compile an aggregated review, and will simply provide the following response:

"The provided answers are not relevant to the questions."
