<quotes>
[1] "Recent emergence and use of abundant shale gas resources, in particular ethane, as the feedstock to a steam cracker would increase the gap between the production of ethylene and propylene. This has motivated the development of on-purpose propylene-production technologies such as the dehydrogenation of propane, which produces exclusively propylene of high purity suitable for polymer synthesis instead of a mixture of lower olefins."

[2] "However, this reaction is a thermodynamically restricted reaction at moderate temperatures (equilibrium C3H8 conversion = 20% at 773 K). The need of a high reaction temperature and the endothermic nature make this reaction less energy efficient."  

[3] "Despite some recent encouraging progress, high C3H6 selectivity (>70%) is still difficult to achieve at a high C3H8 conversion (>30%)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
4. The article summarizes remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis, including:

- Thermodynamic limitations restrict propane conversion to around 20% at moderate temperatures. 

- High reaction temperatures are needed, making the endothermic process less energy efficient.

- Achieving high propylene selectivity (>70%) at high propane conversion (>30%) remains difficult.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
4. 该文章总结了丙烷脱氢催化中仍存在的挑战和知识空白,包括:

- 温和反应条件下,热力学限制使丙烷转化率只能达到20%左右。

- 需要高反应温度,使得该端othermic过程的能量效率较低。 

- 在高丙烷转化率(>30%)条件下,实现高丙烯选择性(>70%)仍然困难。

 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the literature that directly address any of the questions asked. The article focuses on investigating cerium oxide-based catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using oxygen and hydrogen chloride. It does not discuss process intensification, techno-economic analysis, safety issues, remaining challenges and future research directions, high-throughput computational catalyst screening, in-situ characterization needs, or transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation specifically.
