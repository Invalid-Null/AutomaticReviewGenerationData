[1] "The as-prepared Zn-4@S-1 catalysts exhibit good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and regeneration capability in PDH reaction under employed conditions."

[2] "Through regeneration via simple calcination process, the partially reduced Znδ+ species could be oxidized back to Zn2+ species, which is the basis of the good regeneration capability achieved (Fig. 7a)."

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It shows that Zn-4@S-1 catalysts prepared by encapsulating Zn in S-1 zeolites exhibit good regeneration capability, retaining activity after multiple calcination regenerations. This is attributed to the ability to re-oxidize partially reduced Zn species back to the Zn2+ active state.

[1] "Zn2+ in H-ZSM5 participated in all dehydrogenation steps required for alkane aromatization and could induce the heterolytic cleavage of the carbonhydrogen bond, leading to ZnH species." 

[2] "Well-isolated zinc cations are successfully trapped and stabilized by the Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites via in-situ hydrothermal synthesis."

[3] "TEM images of the selected zeolite samples in Fig. 1 demonstrated the formation of zeolite crystals with neat surface while significant increases in the crystal size could be observed with the introduction of zinc species especially at high loadings."

[4] "Mapping the elemental distribution of zeolite catalyst was conducted under STEM mode using a JEOL built-in energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) software."

[5] "Selected-area element mapping analyses undoubtedly confirmed the existence and the homogeneous dispersion of zinc species in the Zn@S-1 zeolite at zinc loading of 4 wt% (Fig. 3) or even 8 wt% (Fig. S3)."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses in-situ hydrothermal synthesis to trap isolated Zn2+ cations in zeolite frameworks, avoiding aggregation. TEM and STEM-EDS mapping confirm high dispersion of Zn in Zn@S-1 catalysts up to 8 wt% loading. This optimized dispersion is linked to high activity.

[1] "In-situ near-ambient pressure (NAP) XPS of Zn-4@S-1 samples under PDH-relevant conditions were performed on a SPECS NAP-XPS spectrometer with monochromatic Al Kα X-ray as the excitation source."

[2] "In-situ NAP XPS was employed to monitor the oxidation states of zinc species in Zn-4@S-1 under PDH-relevant conditions (Fig. 9a). Feeding propane to Zn-4@S-1 at 623 K could not reduce the Zn2+ species (unchanged Zn LMM binding energy value at 500.0 eV) while feeding propane at higher temperatures could."

[3] "Ex-situ spectrum of Zn-4@S-1 after PDH at 853 K for 6 h showed the Zn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 binding energy values at 1022.4 and 1045.4 eV, respectively, also attributed to the partially reduced Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species (Fig. 9b)."
