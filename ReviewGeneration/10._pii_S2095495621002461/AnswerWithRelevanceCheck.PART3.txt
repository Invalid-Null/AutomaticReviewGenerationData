         "Zinc cations were coordinated with ethyleniamine for stabilization against aggregation in the alkaline environment of zeolite synthesis."
         "Well-isolated zinc cations are successfully trapped and stabilized by the Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites via in-situ hydrothermal synthesis."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         The article describes using zeolites as supports to stabilize isolated zinc active sites via direct hydrothermal synthesis. Coordinating zinc cations with ethylenediamine and trapping them in the pores of S-1 zeolite during crystallization prevents aggregation. Zn@S-1 with well-isolated zinc cations is a specific example discussed.

         该文描述了使用分子筛作为载体来通过直接水热合成法稳定隔离的锌活性中心。在结晶过程中,用乙二胺配位锌离子并将其困在S-1分子筛的孔内,可防止聚集。 Zn@S-1 中的锌离子就是一个具体例子。

         "The as-prepared Zn-4@S-1 catalysts exhibit good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and regeneration capability in PDH reaction under employed conditions."
         "Through regeneration via simple calcination process, the partially reduced Znδ+ species could be oxidized back to Zn2+ species, which is the basis of the good regeneration capability achieved (Fig. 7a)."

      <English>
         Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in S-1 zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. Zn-4@S-1 catalysts prepared by encapsulating Zn in S-1 zeolites exhibit good regeneration capability, retaining activity after multiple calcinations. This is attributed to re-oxidizing reduced Zn species back to the active Zn2+ state.

         "Zn-4@S-1 prepared by in-situ hydrothermal route exhibited higher activity than Zn-4/S-1 prepared by incipient wetness impregnation."
         "Well-isolated zinc cations are successfully trapped and stabilized by the Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites via in-situ hydrothermal synthesis."
         "TEM images of the selected zeolite samples in Fig. 1 demonstrated the formation of zeolite crystals with neat surface while significant increases in the crystal size could be observed with the introduction of zinc species especially at high loadings."
         "Mapping the elemental distribution of zeolite catalyst was conducted under STEM mode using a JEOL built-in energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) software." 
         "Selected-area element mapping analyses undoubtedly confirmed the existence and the homogeneous dispersion of zinc species in the Zn@S-1 zeolite at zinc loading of 4 wt% (Fig. 3) or even 8 wt% (Fig. S3)."

      <English>
         Yes, the article investigates direct hydrothermal synthesis for optimizing active zinc phase dispersion in S-1 zeolite supports. TEM, STEM-EDS, and elemental mapping confirm high dispersion of zinc species at loadings up to 8 wt% without aggregates. The in-situ approach prevents nanoparticle formation seen in impregnation.
