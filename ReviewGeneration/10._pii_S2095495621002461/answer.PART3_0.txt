1. "Various metal-containing zeolites with B, Ga, Sn and Zn species have been recently explored to replace the traditional Pt- or Cr-based catalysts [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]."

2. "Zeolites are commonly used as support materials and their well-ordered porous structure enables the efficient stabilization as well as the good distribution of zinc species."

3. "Typically, propylene yield of 41% at selectivity of 97% could be achieved on Zn-4@S-1 at 873 K (major by-products: methane, ethane and ethylene)." 

4. "After two continuous regenerations, the good dispersion of zinc species in S-1 zeolite was preserved and no signs of aggregations could be observed, as shown in Fig. 7(b)."

5. "No relevant quotes."

6. "In-situ near-ambient pressure (NAP) XPS of Zn-4@S-1 samples under PDH-relevant conditions were performed on a SPECS NAP-XPS spectrometer with monochromatic Al Kα X-ray as the excitation source."

7. "In-situ NAP XPS was employed to monitor the oxidation states of zinc species in Zn-4@S-1 under PDH-relevant conditions (Fig. 9a)."

8. "No relevant quotes."

1. The article describes using zeolites as supports to stabilize isolated zinc active sites via direct hydrothermal synthesis. Zn@S-1 with well-isolated zinc cations is a specific example discussed.

2. The article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolites for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability.

3. The article investigates direct hydrothermal synthesis for optimizing active zinc phase dispersion in S-1 zeolite supports. Zn-4@S-1 with 4 wt% zinc loading is an optimized example.  

4. The article achieves 41% propylene yield at 97% selectivity on Zn-4@S-1 at 873 K, and the zinc sites show regeneration capability without agglomeration after reactions.

5. The article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces.

6. The article utilizes in-situ NAP XPS to monitor oxidation state changes of zinc species in Zn-4@S-1 during propane dehydrogenation conditions. 

7. The article uses in-situ NAP XPS to reveal partial reduction of� Zn2+ sites to Znδ+ sites as active for propane dehydrogenation over Zn-4@S-1.

8. The article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.
