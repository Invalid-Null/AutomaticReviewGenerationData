         "Various metal-containing zeolites with B, Ga, Sn and Zn species have been recently explored to replace the traditional Pt- or Cr-based catalysts [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]."
         "Zeolites are commonly used as support materials and their well-ordered porous structure enables the efficient stabilization as well as the good distribution of zinc species."
         "Well-isolated zinc cations are successfully trapped and stabilized by the Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites via in-situ hydrothermal synthesis."

         "Zn-4@S-1 prepared by in-situ hydrothermal route exhibited higher activity than Zn-4/S-1 prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, while the pre-reduction of Zn-4@S-1 in H2 resulted in the sharp decline in the catalytic activity."
         "Well-isolated zinc cations are successfully trapped and stabilized by the Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites via in-situ hydrothermal synthesis."
         "TEM images of the selected zeolite samples in Fig. 1 demonstrated the formation of zeolite crystals with neat surface while significant increases in the crystal size could be observed with the introduction of zinc species especially at high loadings." 
         "Mapping the elemental distribution of zeolite catalyst was conducted under STEM mode using a JEOL built-in energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) software."
         "Selected-area element mapping analyses undoubtedly confirmed the existence and the homogeneous dispersion of zinc species in the Zn@S-1 zeolite at zinc loading of 4 wt% (Fig. 3) or even 8 wt% (Fig. S3)."
