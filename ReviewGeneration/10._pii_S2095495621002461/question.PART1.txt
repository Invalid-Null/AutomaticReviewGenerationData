Propane dehydrogenation catalyzed by in-situ partially reduced zinc cations confined in zeolites
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095495621002461
AbstractAbstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), employing Pt- or Cr-based catalysts, represents an emerging industrial route for propylene production. Due to the scarcity of platinum and the toxicity of chromium, alternative PDH catalysts are being pursued. Herein, we report the construction of Zn-containing zeolite catalysts, namely Zn@S-1, for PDH reaction. Well-isolated zinc cations are successfully trapped and stabilized by the Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites via in-situ hydrothermal synthesis. The as-prepared Zn@S-1 catalysts exhibit good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and regeneration capability in PDH reaction under employed conditions. The in-situ partial reduction of zinc species is observed and the partially reduced zinc cations are definitely identified as the active sites for PDH reaction.

1. Introduction
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to non-petroleum based propylene with significant industrial relevance [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Pt- [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13] and Cr- [14] based catalysts have been intensively investigated in the past decades, and they are currently applied in commercial PDH processes. However, the scarcity of platinum and the environmental toxicity of chromium remain key drawbacks of the current commercial PDH catalysts, which trigger great interest in exploring alternative non-noble metal and environment-friendly active components for PDH catalysts. Zinc, an earth-abundant (75 ppm in crust) and non-toxic metal, has been investigated as a promising promoter in Pt-based PDH catalysts. Recently, it has been disclosed that the Zn species can act as the active components for PDH catalysts instead of just being promoters [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. However, the structure and role of zinc sites in PDH reaction or more general alkane activation processes are under debates. For example, Mole et al. [26] proposed that Zn2+ in H-ZSM5 participated in all dehydrogenation steps required for alkane aromatization and could induce the heterolytic cleavage of the carbonhydrogen bond, leading to ZnH species. Miller et al. [27] claimed that low-coordinated, single-site Zn2+ might be capable of dehydrogenating alkanes to olefin and hydrogen if it could be stabilized toward reduction, and the coordination geometry of the Zn2+ site was a key parameter controlling its catalytic activity. In contrast, Pidko et al. [28] deemed that clustered oxygenated zinc species were more active than isolated Zn cations. The oxidation of reduced Zn-ZSM-5 resulted in a 2-fold increase in the propane conversion, and the highly dispersed multinuclear cationic Zn complexes exhibited much higher activity toward propane activation than the more agglomerated forms of Zn.
Zeolites are commonly used as support materials and their well-ordered porous structure enables the efficient stabilization as well as the good distribution of zinc species. Both experimental [29], [30] and theoretical studies [31], [32] have been performed to understand the active sites and reaction mechanism of propane activation on zinc species supported on zeolites [28], [33], [34], [35], however, the catalytic behaviors of zinc-containing zeolites are still inconclusive. In our recent work, isolated Zn species stabilized by beta zeolites exhibited certain dehydrogenation activity and high propylene selectivity in PDH reaction [36]. In view of their known activity in alkane activation, zinc species confined in Silicate-1 zeolite, i.e., Zn@S-1, are prepared via direct hydrothermal route and investigated for PDH reaction. The main purposes of this study are to clarify the potential of zinc-containing zeolite catalysts for commercial PDH process and to identify the active zinc sites for the reaction, which can resolve some of the current disagreements on Zn-based PDH catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Synthesis of S-1 zeolite
S-1 zeolite was synthesized via conventional hydrothermal route. Briefly, 6 g tetrapropylammonium hydroxide aqueous (TPAOH, 25 wt% in water) was added into 7 mL deionized water containing 4.2 g tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and stirred for 6 h to obtain transparent liquid. The mixture was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave for static crystallization at 443 K for 3 days. The solid products were collected by centrifugation, thoroughly washed with deionized water, dried at 353 K for 12 h, and finally calcined at 823 K for 6 h to remove the template.
Synthesis of Zn-x@S-1 (x = 28) zeolite
The Zn-x@S-1 zeolites with different zinc loadings were synthesized via similar hydrothermal route described above, and the zinc precursor [Zn(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](OAc)2 was added the during the process. In a typical synthesis, 6 g of TPAOH was mixed with 7 g of deionized water, and 4.2 g of TEOS was added into the solution. The mixture was then stirred for 6 h to form transparent liquid, denoted as solution A. Meanwhile, 2 mL of ethylenediamine was mixed with 8 mL deionized water and 0.7 g of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O was added into the solution, the mixture being denoted as solution B. A certain amount of solution B was added into the solution A and stirred for 0.5 h, and then the clear solution was transferred to autoclave for static crystallization at 443 K for 3 days. The solid products were collected by centrifugation, thoroughly washed with deionized water and dried at 353 K for 12 h. The zinc-containing S-1 zeolites were placed in a tubular reactor, sealed and heated at 823 K for 6 h derive Zn-x@S-1 zeolites, where the x represents the designated weight loading of zinc.
Synthesis of Zn-4/S-1 sample
The reference Zn-4/S-1 sample was prepared via incipient wetness impregnation route. Typically, 1 g of S-1 zeolite host was impregnated with 0.14 g of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O in 40 mL H2O, and dried at 353 K to achieve an intimate mixture powder. The solid mixture was placed in a tubular reactor and heated at 823 K for 6 h derive the Zn-4/S-1 sample.
2.2. Sample characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed at a scanning rate of 6/min on a Rigaku Mini Flex II diffractometer employing the graphite filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å).
The surface areas of selected samples were determined by argon adsorption/desorption isotherms at 87 K on a Quantachrome iQ-MP gas adsorption analyzer. The Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the total surface area. The t-plot method was employed to calculate the micropore volumes.
The diffuse reflectance ultravioletvisible (UVvis) spectra of the dehydrated samples were recorded against BaSO4 on a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 UVVis-NIR spectrophotometer in the range of 200800 nm.
The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of selected zeolite samples were collected on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer with 256 scans at a resolution of 2 cm1, and the spectra were recorded against KBr as the background.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2800 transmission electron microscope at 200 kV. Mapping the elemental distribution of zeolite catalyst was conducted under STEM mode using a JEOL built-in energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) software.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of selected samples were performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer with monochromatic Al-Kα X-rays as the excitation source. Accurate binding energies were determined with respect to the position of the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.8 eV.
2.3. Steady-state reaction
Propane dehydrogenation was performed in a fixed-bed micro-reactor at atmospheric pressure. In a typical test, the catalyst sample (0.1 g, sieve fraction of 0.250.5 mm) was placed in a quartz reactor, and pretreated in He at 473 K for 1 h. Subsequently, the reactant gas mixture containing 10 vol% propane (balanced by He) was fed to the reactor at the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 2.47.2 h1. The reaction was conducted isothermally and the gaseous products were analyzed by using an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2010). The conversion of propane and the selectivity toward propylene were calculated as follows:
2.4. Temperature-programmed surface reaction
Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) of propane dehydrogenation were performed in a quartz tubular reactor and a downstream gas sampling mass spectrometer (MS, Pfeiffer-Balzer Omnistar). Typically, the catalyst sample was pretreated in He at 473 K for 1 h, cooled to 373 K and the reactant gas mixture was then fed to the system. The TPSR experiment was recorded in the range of 373973 K at a heating rate of 5 K min1.
2.5. In-situ near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
In-situ near-ambient pressure (NAP) XPS of Zn-4@S-1 samples under PDH-relevant conditions were performed on a SPECS NAP-XPS spectrometer with monochromatic Al Kα X-ray as the excitation source. The binding energies (0.1 eV) were determined with respect to the position of Si 2p peak.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preparation and characterization of Zn@S-1
Zinc cations were coordinated with ethylenediamine for stabilization against aggregation in the alkaline environment of zeolite synthesis. After crystallization and calcination in air, the Zn-x@S-1 samples with different Zn loadings could be obtained. The XRD patterns of the S-1 and Zn-x@S-1 (x = 2, 4, 6, 8) in Fig. S1 showed the diffraction peaks of the typical MFI zeolite structure, while a noticeable decline in the intensity could be observed after the introduction of Zn species. Argon sorption isotherms in Fig. S2 showed the typical type I curves of all samples, revealing the ordered microporous structure. The detailed textural properties of S-1 and Zn-x@S-1 samples were summarized in Table S1 and all samples exhibited similar high surface areas of 383463 m2 g1 and large micropore volumes of 0.2340.271 cm3 g1.
SEM images of the selected zeolite samples in Fig. 1 demonstrated the formation of zeolite crystals with neat surface while significant increases in the crystal size could be observed with the introduction of zinc species especially at high loadings. Overall, zinc-containing zeolites, namely Zn@S-1, with good crystallinity could be successfully prepared via in-situ hydrothermal route at zinc loadings of <6%.

3.2. Distribution of Zn species in S-1 zeolite
The interaction between Zn species and S-1 zeolite in Zn@S1 was first investigated by means of infrared spectroscopy. Fig. 2(a) displayed the hydroxyl stretching region FTIR spectra of calcined S-1 and Zn-x@S-1. The S-1 zeolite exhibited two major bands at 3730 and 3510 cm1, corresponding to the isolated terminal silanol (Si-OH) and the hydroxyl nests containing hydrogen-bonded Si-OH groups, respectively [37], [38]. With the introduction of zinc species at increasing loadings, the intensities of these two bands (3740 and 3510 cm1) decreased gradually, revealing the trapping of zinc species by Si-OH groups. Meanwhile, IR bands at 3640 cm1 due to Zn-OH groups appeared at high zinc loadings. The interaction between zinc species and Si-OH groups was also supported by NMR spectroscopic analyses. As shown in Fig. 2(b), two signals at 113 and 103 ppm could be observed in the 29Si MAS NMR spectrum of S-1. The signal at 113 ppm was attributed to framework Si(OSi)4 species (Q4), and the signal at 103 ppm was attributed to framework Si(OSi)3(OH) species (Si-OH groups, Q3) at so-called defect sites [38]. The introduction of zinc species to the S-1 zeolite resulted in significant decreases of the Q3 signal due the trapping of zinc species by Si-OH and the consumption of Si-OH groups thereof.

Electronic microscopy was further employed to visualize the distribution of zinc species in S-1 zeolite crystals. No traces of Zn aggregates could be identified in the TEM and STEM images shown in the Fig. 3. Selected-area element mapping analyses undoubtedly confirmed the existence and the homogeneous dispersion of zinc species in the Zn@S-1 zeolite at zinc loading of 4 wt% (Fig. 3) or even 8 wt% (Fig. S3). That is, highly dispersed Zn species could be trapped by the Si-OH groups in the S-1 zeolite via in-situ hydrothermal route. For comparison, Zn-containing aggregates of 25 nm could be clearly observed for Zn-4/S-1 zeolite prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with similar zinc loading of 4 wt% (Fig. S4).

In order to evaluate the chemical states of zinc species in S-1, UVvis analyses were performed. As shown in Fig. 4(a), strong ultraviolet absorption with edge at 370 nm was observed for ZnO, corresponding to the band-band transition of this type of semiconductor (Eg = 3.35 eV). Zn-4/S-1 exhibited similar absorption edge but much lower intensity, demonstrating the formation of ZnO nanoparticles on zeolite [39], [40], [41] as also revealed by TEM observations (Fig. S4). In contrast, Zn-x@S-1 (x = 2, 4, 6 and 8) only showed the ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, i.e., O2 to Zn2+ in SiOZn structure, at below 240 nm. It could be therefore proposed isolated zinc cations dominated in Zn@S-1, in good consistence with TEM observations (Figs. 3 and S3).

The oxidation states of zinc species in Zn@S-1 samples were then investigated by means of XPS and the results were shown in Fig. 4(b). Typically, two binding energy signals positioned at 1023.1 and 1046.1 (Δ = 23 eV) were observed for all Zn-x@S-1 samples, originated from the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 photoelectrons of Zn2+ species [36]. It should be noted that these binding energy values are significantly higher than those from bulk ZnO (1021.7 and 1044.7 eV) due to the electron transfer from Zn to zeolite framework, which make it possible to distinguish between the cationic and metallic form of zinc species.
According to the above-mentioned characterization results, it can be stated that highly dispersed Zn2+ species have been successfully trapped and stabilized by Si-OH groups via in-situ hydrothermal route.
3.3. Catalytic performance in PDH reaction
PDH reaction was evaluated using Zn@S-1 zeolites with different Zn loadings as catalysts and the results were shown in Fig. 5(a). The catalytic activity of S-1 zeolite in PDH was negligible. Interestingly, upon the introduction of 4 wt% zinc to S-1 zeolite, significant improvement in propane conversion and propylene selectivity could be simultaneously obtained. Zn-4@S-1 prepared by in-situ hydrothermal route exhibited higher activity than Zn-4/S-1 prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, while the pre-reduction of Zn-4@S-1 in H2 resulted in the sharp decline in the catalytic activity. Intuitively, zinc cations acted as the preferred active sites for PDH reaction than the metallic zinc. The impacts of zinc loadings on the PDH performance of Zn@S-1 were further investigated. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the yield of propylene increased with increasing zinc loading from 2 to 4%, stayed stable at zinc loading of 4%6%, and decreased with further increase in zinc loading to 8%. Zinc loading of 4% was optimized for Zn@S-1 PDH catalyst. Typically, propylene yield of 41% at selectivity of 97% could be achieved on Zn-4@S-1 at 873 K (major by-products: methane, ethane and ethylene). It should be noted that the propane conversion gradually dropped with time-on-stream during PDH reaction while the propylene selectivity was kept stable (Fig. S5). To improve the catalytic stability of Zn-4@S-1, alkali or alkaline-earth ions were introduced as the promoters. However unfortunately, all these promoters showed negative impacts on the catalyst stability or even caused the decline in activity (Figs. S6 and S7).

A small amount of O2 was then co-fed with propane during PDH reaction to suppress the reduction of zinc cations to less active metallic zinc (vide supra) and to alleviate the formation of coke species. The presence of O2 showed severe negative impacts on the catalytic activity of Zn-4@S-1 at 723873 K, with propane conversion decline by more than a half (Fig. 6a). Meanwhile, the selectivity to propylene could be kept at a high level (Fig. 6b). On the other hand, the presence of O2 could even slightly promote propane conversion (54%56%) at higher reaction temperature of 923 K. According to these results, the impacts of O2 on PDH reaction were tentatively ascribed to the changes in the oxidation states of active zinc species, which will be discussed in detail in the next section.

The reaction conditions of PDH were also optimized with Zn-4@S-1 as a model catalyst. The reaction temperature was optimized to be 853 K, at which considerable propane conversion and high propylene selectivity could be simultaneously achieved. Increasing the WHSV from 1.2 to 7.2 h1 resulted in significant declines in propane conversion from 50% to 15% and meanwhile the propylene selectivity could be kept at a high level of >96% (Fig. S8). In terms of propylene spacetimeyield (STY), the WHSV of 4.8 h1 could be optimized, giving a propylene STY of 24 
at 853 K. This value is at the same level of Pt-based (2102 
) and Cr-based catalysts (0.0459 
) under comparable reaction conditions (high STY values exclusively obtained at high WHSV; see Table S2 for more details).
The catalytic deactivation and regeneration behaviors of Zn-4@S-1 in PDH reaction were investigated. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the catalytic activity of Zn-4@S-1, reflected as the propane conversion, gradually decreased from 30 to 13% after PDH reaction for 6 h with a deactivation rate of 0.18 h1. The formation of coke deposit was indeed observed on Zn-4@S-1. However, the amount of coke was determined to be as low as 2.8% by TG-DSC analysis (Fig. S9), which did not necessarily lead to the severe catalytic deactivation. Other factors, for example the changes in the active zinc sites, might also contribute to the catalytic deactivation. Nevertheless, the catalytic activity of Zn-4@S-1 could be fully recovered through a very simple calcination process in flowing air (at 873 K for 2 h). After two continuous regenerations, the good dispersion of zinc species in S-1 zeolite was preserved and no signs of aggregations could be observed, as shown in Fig. 7(b). That is, the isolated zinc species could be efficiently stabilized by S-1 zeolite in Zn-4@S-1 during the processes of PDH reaction as well as catalyst regeneration even under harsh conditions. Summarizing the catalytic data, Zn@S-1 zeolites appear to be very promising PDH catalysts due to their good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, regeneration capability as well as the high abundance and nontoxicity of active zinc component.

3.4. Active zinc sites for PDH reaction
For insights into the active zinc sites for PDH reaction, the TPSR profiles on Zn-4@S-1 model catalyst were recorded under different conditions. As shown in Fig. 8(a), a weak but noticeable H2 signal could be observed at 503 K, due to the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from propane molecules on zinc sites and the combination of two hydrogen atoms to generate gaseous H2. Meanwhile, no signal of propylene could be observed. With increasing temperature to 723 K, the H2 signal increased rapidly, accompanied by the consumption of propane and the formation of propylene. That is, the PDH reaction was initiated. According to these observations, a two-step activation process of propane could be proposed, i.e.,
(i) and
(ii). The hydrogen atoms could reduce the zinc sites and two of the hydrogen atoms could also combine to gaseous H2. Co-feeding O2 to the system did not influence the first step of propane activation (Fig. 8b), however, it significantly suppressed the second step of propane activation and therefore showed severe negative impacts on the propane conversion (Fig. 6a). Once the O2 was completely consumed (rationally by the H2 from non-catalytic propane dehydrogenation,
, Fig. S10), the second step of propane activation started to proceed and the PDH reaction run on the rails at high temperatures of 923 K (Figs. 6a and 8b). On the other hand, the co-feeding of H2 to the reaction system did not influence the both steps of propane activation (Fig. 8c). In other word, H2 co-feeding would not markedly change the oxidation states of zinc sites and showed neglectable impacts on PDH reaction catalyzed by Zn-4@S-1. However, the pre-reduction of Zn-4@S-1 showed vital impacts on propane activation (Fig. S11), which also resulted in very low catalytic activity in PDH reaction (Fig. 5a). On the basis of TPSR profiles, it could be tentatively proposed that the first step of propane activation occurred on Zn2+ sites and the second step of propane (C3H7 motif) activation occurred on the in-situ reduced Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species. The metallic zinc showed very low activity in PDH reaction.

In-situ NAP XPS was employed to monitor the oxidation states of zinc species in Zn-4@S-1 under PDH-relevant conditions (Fig. 9a). Feeding propane to Zn-4@S-1 at 623 K could not reduce the Zn2+ species (unchanged Zn LMM binding energy value at 500.0 eV) while feeding propane at higher temperatures could. Typically, the Zn LMM Auger peak gradually shifted from 500.0 to 499.3 eV with increasing temperature from 623 to 923 K. The Zn LMM binding energy value was distinctly higher than that of metallic zinc (494.6 eV), and under such circumstance, the shifts toward lower binding energy values could be definitely ascribed to the partial reduction of Zn2+ to Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2). The ex-situ spectrum of Zn-4@S-1 after PDH at 853 K for 6 h showed the Zn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 binding energy values at 1022.4 and 1045.4 eV, respectively, also attributed to the partially reduced Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species (Fig. 9b). Through regeneration via simple calcination process, the partially reduced Znδ+ species could be oxidized back to Zn2+ species, which is the basis of the good regeneration capability achieved (Fig. 7a).

4. Conclusions
A series of Zn-containing zeolites with different zinc loadings, namely Zn@S-1, have been successfully prepared via ligand-protected direct hydrothermal route. Characterization results from FTIR, NMR, TEM, UVvis and XPS reveal that well-isolated zinc cations are trapped and efficiently stabilized by the Si-OH groups of S-1.
The as-prepared Zn@S-1 zeolites are applied as potential PDH catalysts with zinc species as the exclusive active components. The catalyst compositions and reaction parameters have been optimized. Zn-4@S-1 catalyst exhibits good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity and regeneration capability in PDH reaction. Typically, propylene STY of 24 
and selectivity of 97% can be achieved at 853 K, demonstrating the great potential of such catalyst for industrial PDH process.
TPSR and co-feeding experiments indicate the two-step activation of propane on zinc sites via hydrogen abstraction. In-situ NAP XPS and ex-situ XPS analyses evidence the partial reduction of Zn2+ to Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species during PDH reaction, and the partially reduced Znδ+ species are identified as the preferred active sites for the reaction.
