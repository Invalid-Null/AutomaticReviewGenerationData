[1] "Zn-4@S-1 prepared by in-situ hydrothermal route exhibited higher activity than Zn-4/S-1 prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, while the pre-reduction of Zn-4@S-1 in H2 resulted in the sharp decline in the catalytic activity."

<English version answer> 

3. The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It compares Zn-4@S-1 prepared by in-situ hydrothermal route to Zn-4/S-1 prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, finding the former has higher catalytic activity likely due to better dispersion. Pre-reducing Zn-4@S-1 sharply decreased activity, suggesting isolated Zn2+ sites are preferred.

[1] "In-situ NAP XPS was employed to monitor the oxidation states of zinc species in Zn-4@S-1 under PDH-relevant conditions (Fig. 9a)." 

[2] "In-situ NAP XPS and ex-situ XPS analyses evidence the partial reduction of Zn2+ to Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species during PDH reaction, and the partially reduced Znδ+ species are identified as the preferred active sites for the reaction."

[1] "TEM images of the selected zeolite samples in Fig. 1 demonstrated the formation of zeolite crystals with neat surface while significant increases in the crystal size could be observed with the introduction of zinc species especially at high loadings."

[2] "Selected-area element mapping analyses undoubtedly confirmed the existence and the homogeneous dispersion of zinc species in the Zn@S-1 zeolite at zinc loading of 4 wt% (Fig. 3) or even 8 wt% (Fig. S3)."
