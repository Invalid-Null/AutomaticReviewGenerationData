1. Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It discusses coordinating zinc cations with ethylenediamine to stabilize them against aggregation during zeolite synthesis (Quote 1). 

2. No, the article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability.

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses direct hydrothermal synthesis to prepare Zn@S-1 catalysts with well-isolated and highly dispersed zinc species (Quotes 1, 3, 4).

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts (Quotes 5, 6). This technique allowed monitoring of zinc oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation. 

5. Yes, the article employs transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with elemental mapping to characterize metal-support interfaces in the catalysts (Quote 3, 4). This provided insights into dispersion of active zinc species.

6. Yes, the article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), including in-situ NAP-XPS, to probe oxidation state changes of zinc during propane dehydrogenation catalysis (Quotes 5, 6). The data revealed partial reduction of Zn2+ to Znδ+ species as the active sites.

7. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.
