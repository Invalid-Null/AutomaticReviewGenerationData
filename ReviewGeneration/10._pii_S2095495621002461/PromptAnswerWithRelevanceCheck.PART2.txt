[1] "Zn@S-1 zeolites with different zinc loadings as catalysts and the results were shown in Fig. 5(a)."

[2] "Zn-4@S-1 prepared by in-situ hydrothermal route exhibited higher activity than Zn-4/S-1 prepared by incipient wetness impregnation"

[3] "That is, zinc cations acted as the preferred active sites for PDH reaction than the metallic zinc."

[4] "Typically, propylene yield of 41% at selectivity of 97% could be achieved on Zn-4@S-1 at 873 K (major by-products: methane, ethane and ethylene)."

[5] "Zn-4@S-1 catalyst exhibits good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity and regeneration capability in PDH reaction."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates MFI zeolite support for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It studies Zn@S-1 catalysts with different zinc loadings. The results in Fig. 5(a) show Zn-4@S-1 prepared by in-situ hydrothermal route has higher activity than Zn-4/S-1 prepared by impregnation. This indicates zinc cations act as preferred active sites over metallic zinc. Zn-4@S-1 achieved 41% propylene yield at 97% selectivity at 873 K. The article concludes Zn-4@S-1 exhibits good activity, high selectivity, and regenerability for propane dehydrogenation.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文评价了MFI沸石作为丙烷脱氢反应催化剂的支持体。它研究了不同锌负载的Zn@S-1催化剂。图5(a)中的结果显示,原位水热法制备的Zn-4@S-1比浸渍法制备的Zn-4/S-1具有更高的活性。这表明锌阳离子相比金属锌而言是优先的活性中心。Zn-4@S-1在873K时达到了41%的丙烯收率和97%的选择性。本文总结Zn-4@S-1表现出良好的活性、高选择性和再生能力用于丙烷脱氢反应。
