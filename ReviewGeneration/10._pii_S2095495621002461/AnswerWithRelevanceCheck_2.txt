         "Various metal-containing zeolites with B, Ga, Sn and Zn species have been recently explored to replace the traditional Pt- or Cr-based catalysts [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]."
         "Zn2+ in H-ZSM5 participated in all dehydrogenation steps required for alkane aromatization and could induce the heterolytic cleavage of the carbonhydrogen bond, leading to ZnH species."
         "Zeolites are commonly used as support materials and their well-ordered porous structure enables the efficient stabilization as well as the good distribution of zinc species."
         "Well-isolated zinc cations are successfully trapped and stabilized by the Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites via in-situ hydrothermal synthesis."
         "Zn-4@S-1 prepared by in-situ hydrothermal route exhibited higher activity than Zn-4/S-1 prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, while the pre-reduction of Zn-4@S-1 in H2 resulted in the sharp decline in the catalytic activity."
