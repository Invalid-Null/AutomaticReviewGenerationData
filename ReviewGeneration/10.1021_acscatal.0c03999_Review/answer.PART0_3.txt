 Unfortunately this literature review does not contain any information that directly answers the questions provided. The review focuses on recent progress in developing catalysts and understanding mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using soft oxidants such as CO2, N2O, sulfur compounds, and halogens. It does not discuss the importance of propylene production, thermodynamic constraints, kinetics, computational studies, microkinetic modeling, or structure-activity relationships related to propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since there are no relevant quotes from the given text, I cannot provide verbatim quotes to support answers to the questions. Please let me know if you would like me to attempt to answer the questions based on my own knowledge rather than quoting the provided literature.
