I carefully compared the answer files to the correct answers for each question. I judged consistency based on how well the key points in the correct answer were covered in the answer file. For completely inconsistent answers, I assigned 0%. For fully consistent answers covering all main points, I assigned 100%. For partial answers, I estimated a percentage based on the fraction of key points addressed. Please let me know if you would like me to modify the consistency ratios in any way.
