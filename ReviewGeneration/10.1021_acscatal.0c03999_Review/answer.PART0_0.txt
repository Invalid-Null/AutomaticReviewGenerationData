[1] The article provides background on the importance of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation, stating "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives." 

[2] The article explains how catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by activating C-H bonds, stating "On metal oxides, this commonly occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acid-base pair."

[3] The article introduces major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation, including "transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements" like CrOx, VOx, and Ga2O3, as well as "supported counterparts" like zeolites.

[4] The article discusses thermodynamic constraints, stating "direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures." It also provides quantitative kinetics, like apparent activation energies.

[5] The article describes how DFT has been applied, stating computational studies have "provided useful insights toward this problem with regards to mechanistic understanding and catalyst design principles."

[6] The article presents microkinetic modeling efforts, stating "Modeling these pathways through microkinetics or kinetic Monte Carlo has been shown to be very useful." 

[7] The article describes computational and experimental work identifying catalyst descriptors, like the "oxygen binding energy on the metal node" correlating to catalyst reoxidation.
