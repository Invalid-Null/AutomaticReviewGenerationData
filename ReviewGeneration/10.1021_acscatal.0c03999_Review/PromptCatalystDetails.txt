Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene with Soft Oxidants via Heterogeneous Catalysis

Abstract
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene can be achieved using conventional, oxygen-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (O2–ODHP) or via the use of soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogens/halides. The major roles of soft oxidants include inhibiting overoxidation and improving propylene selectivity, which are considered to be current challenges in O2-assisted dehydrogenation. For both CO2– and N2O–ODHP reactions, significant efforts have been devoted to developing redox-active (e.g., chromium, vanadate, iron, etc.), nonredox-type main group metal oxide (e.g., group IIIA, gallium), and other transition metal/metal oxide catalysts (e.g., molybdenum, palladium platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, etc.), as well as zeolite-based catalysts with adjustable acid–base properties, unique pore structures, and topologies. Metal sulfides have shown promising performance in DHP, whereas the development of suitable catalysts has lagged for SO2- or S-assisted ODHP. Recently, significant efforts have been focused on homogeneous and heterogeneous ODHP using halogens (e.g., Br2, I2, Cl2, etc.) and hydrogen halides (e.g., HCl and HBr) for the development of facile processes for C3H6 synthesis. This Review aims to provide a critical, comprehensive review of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with these soft oxidants, particularly highlighting the current state of understanding of the following factors: (i) relationships between composition, structure, and catalytic performance, (ii) effects of the support, acidity, and promoters, (iii) reaction pathway and mechanistic insights, and (iv) the various roles of soft oxidants. Theoretical and computational insights toward understanding reaction mechanisms and catalyst design principles are also covered. Future research opportunities are discussed in terms of catalyst design and synthesis, deactivation and regeneration, reaction mechanisms, and alternative approaches.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. (1) However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives. (2) At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP). (3) Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation. (4) Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures. (5) Presently, oxygen (O2) has been widely used as an oxidant for ODHP. Though major progress has been made by using redox-active transition metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (1,6) and molybdenum, (6) the presence of O2 can cause overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in the inefficient use of the reactant and low process selectivity. (1,6) Most recently, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has emerged as an outstanding catalyst for O2–ODHP with high C3H6 selectivity (e.g., 79% selectivity with 14% C3H8 conversion at 490 °C) and well-suppressed overoxidation. (7) To date studies have mainly focused on low-temperature activity (8) and probing possible active sites and mechanisms, including surface oxy-functionalization, peculiar kinetic features, and radical chemistry in the gas phase. (9,10) Despite potential advantages, concerns of process flammability due to the presence of O2 exist and might impair practical implementation. (5,11) To address this issue, an alternative approach is to introduce soft oxidants to replace O2 for ODHP, such as CO2, NOx, and S-containing compounds, as well as halogen/halides. Furthermore, the combination of these soft oxidants in ODHP offers avenues to directly utilize them for chemical conversion to reduce or mitigate acid-gas emissions, thereby adding environment-sustainability-energy benefits to ODHP reactions. For example, an approach of H2-free CO2 conversion through the ODHP process using renewable energy could potentially help to reduce CO2 emissions. (12)
There have been several excellent reviews regarding ODHP with CO2 as an oxidant. (6,13−16) Most of them have concentrated on the feasibility of utilizing CO2 as an oxidant for multiple reactions but fewer focused on the details of the ODHP reaction. Also, there has been little covered regarding the development of catalysts for other soft oxidant-assisted ODHP. In addition, the growing “propylene gap” between market demand and productivity and the continuously increasing concerns of environmental burden motivate the need for developing alternative approaches using soft oxidants for sustainable chemical production. All of these factors necessitate a timely analysis and summary of the literature to highlight current progress in catalyst development for alkane conversion utilizing soft oxidants. (17) Therefore, the present Review describes state-of-the-art catalysts that have been developed for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants and provides an overview of the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and catalytic performance by extrapolating the reported kinetic and characterization results. Major soft oxidants including CO2, N2O, and S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides are reviewed. Among these, CO2-/NOx-assisted ODHP reactions have been mostly studied, with significant efforts aimed at developing supported metal oxide catalysts including redox-type transition metal oxides (e.g., chromium, vanadium, and iron) (5,18−20) and main group metal oxides with nonredox property (e.g., gallium). (5) Catalytic performance has been found to strongly depend on the dispersion of active species and the nature of the support. (1) Based on the variation of these aspects, the roles of CO2 and N2O also differ among catalysts. (21−24)
In sharp contrast to CO2 and N2O, sulfur-assisted DHP and ODHP have not been well studied in the context of active sites, structure, composition, or reaction mechanism, despite these soft oxidants being potential promoters for the reaction. Additionally, sulfur compounds, such as H2S, are a common cocontaminant in natural gas. (25−27) Therefore, significant effort is needed to realize the feasibility of this chemistry. Recently, catalytic oxychlorination over metal phosphate (e.g., CrPO4 and FePO4) and rare earth metal oxides/oxychlorides (e.g., CeO2 and EuOCl) has garnered more interest, as propylene yields up to 55% have been achieved at 500 °C. Oxychlorination chemistry is found to be largely correlated with the ability of catalyst to oxidize HCl to molecular Cl2.
In the present Review, we start with a thermodynamic analysis of ODHP with various soft oxidants, then endeavor to cover the progress in ODHP with each soft oxidant, with emphasis on the following aspects: (i) the relationship between composition, structure, and catalytic performance, presenting the composition-induced molecular structure and active sites of catalysts in correlation with observed kinetic behavior; (ii) the influence of the nature of the support and its acidity on the activity and selectivity; and (iii) mechanistic insights, using the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and catalytic performance in conjunction with theoretical calculations to provide an overview of the working principles of ODHP reactions for different soft oxidants. In addition, this Review underlines various roles of different soft oxidants in these reactions, such as shifting reaction equilibria, reoxidizing catalysts, removing coke, serving as cocatalyst, and possessing competitive adsorption against C3H8. A perspective on future research opportunities is also provided at the very end.

2.1. Thermodynamic Analysis
2.1.1. CO2–ODHP
For the reaction between CO2 and propane, as listed in Table 1, isotope-labeling experiments reveal the presence of parallel-consecutive reaction networks consisting of direct dehydrogenation (eq 2-1), reverse water–gas shift (eq 2-2), and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (eq 2-3). (28) As is well-known, one major advantage of O2–ODHP is its thermodynamic favorability due to its exothermicity (eq 2-11). (29) However, this advantage is no longer relevant in the case of CO2–ODHP because all major reactions are endothermic. One of the roles of CO2 is to shift the equilibrium of the ODHP reaction (eq 2-3) to the product side by consuming produced H2 via the RWGS (eq 2-2), thereby resulting in enhanced C3H8 conversion. (22) Meanwhile, dry reforming of propane (DRP, eq 2-4) can also occur and dominate in the same temperature range (Figure 1A). DRP is thermodynamically less restrained than dry reforming of ethane and methane. (12) Of note, since the CO2–ODHP reaction is a volume-increasing process, adding inert gas such as He and N2 allows a further enhancement of the equilibrium C3H8 conversion. (30) In relation to the effect of C3H8/CO2 ratios, a high CO2 partial pressure leads to higher C3H8 conversion, yet presents a detrimental impact on C3H6 production. (30) This stems from the existing competition between DRP and CO2–ODHP. Therefore, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit DRP and improve ODHP, which becomes a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for CO2–ODHP. (30)

Other side reactions, such as propane decomposition and cracking, as well as propylene decomposition (eqs 2-6–2-9), show less thermodynamic restraint and can readily occur, especially at higher temperatures. Among them, propylene decomposition (eq 2-9) is thermodynamically more favorable than propane decomposition (eq 2-6). (31) Undoubtedly, these reactions have negative impacts on activity and selectivity to the target product propylene at high temperatures in both ODHP and DHP. In addition, the decomposition reactions are one of the major causes of severe catalyst deactivation through coking, with the extent varying depending on the catalysts used. For example, the decomposition reaction (eq 2-7) dominates and causes severe deactivation in the case of Fe–Ce solid solution catalysts, (29) while the cracking reaction (eq 2-8) may occur on precious Pt catalysts. (32,33) Coke formation (eq 2-10) is one of the major causes of deactivation of the catalysts for CO2–ODHP. (34) This reaction is endothermic and not a spontaneous reaction at room temperature because of its highly positive Gibbs free energy. However, it becomes spontaneous starting from ∼400 °C (i.e., ΔG400°C = −6.5 kJ mol–1), resulting in catalyst deactivation in turn. In addition, propane hydrogenolysis (32,33) and CO2 methanation (29) are also reported side reactions during CO2–ODHP reaction on different catalysts, yet they are scarcely studied. These thermodynamic analyses highlight the critical role of catalysts in kinetically controlling these side reactions.
The reverse Boudouard reaction (eq 2-5) is a side reaction that has been extensively studied for CO2–ODHP. Its occurrence can aid coke removal, therefore inhibiting coking and improving stability. (23) This is considered one of the positive roles of utilizing CO2 as an oxidant and is discussed in detail in section 3.5.3.
2.1.2. N2O–ODHP
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is also a soft oxidant that has been used widely in ODHP. Two parallel reactions are involved, including N2O decomposition to O2 and N2 (eq 2-12) and the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction (eq 2-13). (19,35,36) As listed in Table 1, these reactions are exothermic and spontaneous at room temperature. Similar to O2–ODHP, this reaction route is free of thermodynamic restraint.
2.1.3. ODHP in the Presence of Sulfur-Containing Compounds
Sulfur-containing compounds can serve as either soft oxidants or promoters for ODHP reactions. SO2 is a potential oxidant for the ODHP reaction (eq 2-14), but the reaction is endothermic and not spontaneous at room temperature (Table 1). (37,38) In comparison to CO2–ODHP, SO2–ODHP requires less energy and becomes spontaneous at ∼300 °C (i.e., ΔG300°C = −2.1 kJ mol–1), lower than that for CO2–ODHP (i.e., ΔG700°C = −1.9 kJ mol–1). An alternative is to use S2 as an oxidant, and it can be generated/regenerated in situ with the introduction of H2S in the feed gas. (39,40) In this reaction, H2S partial oxidation to form S2 is the initial step (eq 2-15), followed by C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 with S2 being reduced to H2S (eq 2-16). Notably, the thermodynamic restraint of S2–ODHP is lower than that of N2O–ODHP (i.e., ΔG175°C = −0.4 kJ mol–1). Considering the exothermicity and spontaneity of H2S partial oxidation (Table 1), the S2(H2S)–ODHP reaction can readily occur in the temperature range that has been examined in the literature (400–950 °C). S2 can be regenerated through partial H2S oxidation to complete the reaction cycle. Inspired by the Claus Process in the industry, (41) the use of SO2 has been proposed to oxidize H2S for S recovery (eq 2-17), which does not pose a thermodynamic limit (Table 1). (42) Despite the thermodynamic feasibility of using molecular sulfur for ODHP, it presents problems because of the temperature sensitivity of sulfur polymorphs. To obtain reactive, diradical species S2, high temperatures (i.e., 648–800 °C) are required. (43,44) However, thermal cracking of C3H8 may occur at such high temperatures, making this reaction more challenging.
2.1.4. Halogen(X2)-Promoted ODHP and Oxyhalogenation
Halogens have been known as effective promoters for oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. (45,46) As listed in Table 1, a halogen can react with C3H8 by abstracting hydrogen to form hydrogen halide (eqs 2-18, 2-20, and 2-22), followed by regeneration of the halogen via oxidation with O2 (eqs 2-19, 2-21, and 2-23). (43) Cl2-promoted ODHP (eq 2-18) is exothermic and spontaneous at room temperature; therefore, it is free from thermodynamic restraint. Br2-promoted ODHP is slightly endothermic but still spontaneous at room temperature (eq 2-20). Despite such difference, the thermodynamic restraint is negligible, as 100% C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield can be achieved starting from 25 °C (not shown here). Differently, I2-promoted ODHP is endothermic and not a spontaneous reaction at room temperature (eq 2-22). As presented in Figure 2A, the conversion and yield start to increase at ∼200 °C, gradually rise with temperature, and ultimately reach ∼100% at 1000 °C. Although Cl2-promoted ODHP is more thermodynamically favorable, the reaction is always fast and nonselective toward the formation of propylene, and there is a risk of explosion under some conditions. (47) On the other hand, I2-promoted ODHP suffers from limited recycling efficiency of expensive I2, hampering its industrial implementation. (47) By contrast, Br2-promoted ODHP is more feasible from a practical point of view, yet a high C3H8/Br ratio is necessary to avoid the formation of 2,2-C3H6Br2. (47) As reported, the activity of the ODHP reaction in the presence of a halogen relies heavily on the ease with which the hydrogen halide is oxidized back to the halogen. (43) As presented in Figure 2B and 2C, clearly, HI oxidation is thermodynamically more favorable than the rest, rendering it an outstanding candidate among the halogens in the case of the halo-dehydrogenation reaction.

Equilibrium conversion and yield of I-promoted C3H8 dehydrogenation reaction (A) as a function of temperature; equilibrium halide (HX) conversion (B) and halogen yield (X2) (C) of halide oxidation along with temperatures. Conditions: C3H8/halide = 2/0.5, C3H8/I2 = 1/1 (stoichiometric ratio, as shown in Table 1), and ambient pressure.
An alternative is to integrate the functionalization of C3H8 and the regeneration of halogen-based compounds in one step via propane oxyhalogenation, followed by the formation of propylene through dehydrohalogenation (eqs 2-24–2-29). (48,49) Dehydrohalogenation requires energy input, but these reactions possess no thermodynamic restraint as a whole, as the total reaction is analogous to O2–ODHP in eq 2-11. Besides, dehydrohalogenation becomes spontaneous at mild reaction temperatures, such as with HCl at ∼175 °C (i.e., ΔG175°C = −2.0 kJ mol–1), with HBr at ∼275 °C (i.e., ΔG275°C = −2.1 kJ mol–1), and with HI at ca. 300 °C (i.e., ΔG300°C = −1.1 kJ mol–1). Different to halogen-promoted ODHP, the evolution of a halogen via halide oxidation should be suppressed during oxyhalogenation, especially in the gas phase reaction, as it triggers undesired reaction paths including polyhalogenation, coking, cracking, and combustion. (50) In this context, HI is less favorable among halides in oxyhalogenation of propane, whereas HCl is a better candidate. This can also be reflected from the lower values in the changes of enthalpy and Gibbs free energy (Table 1).
2.2. Comparison between ODHP Reaction with Various Soft Oxidants
For ODHP reactions with various soft oxidants discussed above, O2-/N2O-assisted ODHP, as well as Cl2-promoted ODHP and oxyhalogenation, reactions are exothermic and spontaneous, leading to no thermodynamic limit. The remaining reactions including CO2-/SO2-assisted and Br2-/I2-promoted ODHP reactions are endothermic, whereas the later reactions are thermodynamically more favorable than the former ones if the halogen regeneration reactions are taken into consideration. Between CO2- and SO2-assisted ODHP reactions, the former reaction is the least favorable, as CO2 is both thermodynamically and chemically stable.
Figure 3 compares equilibrium C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield for the cases of CO2– and SO2–ODHP under their respective stoichiometric ratio, as well as those of the direct dehydrogenation reaction. As presented in Figure 3A, both SO2– and CO2–ODHP exhibit higher C3H8 conversion than exhibited for direct dehydrogenation, especially for SO2–ODHP, which displays a rapid increase in C3H8 conversion at low temperatures (i.e., 25–200 °C). Such prominence can also be reflected from the highest C3H6 yield in Figure 3B, demonstrating the promising role of SO2 as a soft oxidant for selective C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6. By contrast, CO2–ODHP shows no conversion between 25 and 200 °C and can only occur at ∼300 °C and above, analogous to the DHP reaction. Although it shows a slight enhancement in C3H8 conversion between ∼300 and 800 °C, the C3H6 yield of CO2–ODHP decreases in comparison to that of DHP. High temperatures can trigger both RWGS and DRP reactions because of their endothermicity, which promotes C3H8 conversion. Yet, the initiation of these two reactions also results in production of more undesired CO as a carbonaceous product, in turn, reducing the C3H6 yield. As shown in Figure 3C, SO2–ODHP also presents limited thermodynamic restraint, as it shows a similar, rapid increase in SO2 conversion, reaching the highest value at a lower temperature than CO2–ODHP. Combined with the above observations, SO2–ODHP is thermodynamically easier than CO2–ODHP, along with limited thermodynamic restraint at low temperatures (i.e., 25–200 °C).

To verify the feasibility of CO2–ODHP, early screening tests were conducted on metal oxides that are active for DHP and O2–ODHP, including transition metal oxides (Fe2O3 and Cr2O3) and main-group metal oxides (Ga2O3, Al2O3, and SiO2). (51,52) Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 ≥ Cr2O3 ≫ Al2O3 > SiO2 ∼ none. For SiO2 and Al2O3-supported counterparts, Cr2O3 performs better than the other two metal oxides in terms of both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity (Table 2). Continuous efforts have been put forth to clarify the relationship of catalytic performance and essential factors for enhancements, primarily focusing on metal oxide dispersion (e.g., active site configuration, redox properties, etc.) and the nature of the support (e.g., textural property, acid–base property, etc.).

Of note, deactivation is rapid on individual metal oxides, especially on Ga2O3 (∼75% from 0.17 to 0.75 h on stream) and Cr2O3 (∼78% within the same time range). (52) Carbon deposition and reduction in active sites might be responsible for such rapid deactivation, the dominance of which depends on the nature of metal oxide, roles of CO2, and reaction mechanisms. Hence, unraveling the deactivation mechanisms and seeking solutions for catalyst regeneration are another area that has been extensively studied. In addition, there are other challenges to be addressed, such as the competitive adsorption between CO2 and C3H6 and elusive reaction mechanisms.
On the basis of the achievements in these areas, this section mainly covers the progress in (i) developing fundamental understanding of the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and activity with representative redox-active and nonredox metal oxide catalysts (i.e., loading-dependent evolution of active sites during reaction, support/promoter nature), (ii) catalyst deactivation and regeneration, and (iii) the roles of CO2 in affecting reaction paths, modifying catalyst surfaces, and coke removal.

Cr Content-Dependent Evolution of Cr Sites
For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2–ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. (5)Table 3 summarizes the surface density of commonly used redox-active metal oxides on supports. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species follows the sequence of grafted Cr6+ → dispersed Cr6+ oxide → microcrystalline Cr3+ → crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. (76) α-Cr2O3 is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, yet inactive for catalysis because of its high resistance to reduction and oxidation. (54) Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity. Below monolayer coverage, the C3H6 yield usually increases with an increase in Cr content; but beyond this threshold, the excess redox Cr species cannot be attached with the support so that unstable Cr species may decompose to nonredox crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles with no activity. (54) An analogous monolayer “threshold” is also known for supported VOx catalysts for the O2–ODHP reaction. (77)

The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity. Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.5–7.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion ≥ 50% and olefin ≥ 90%). (55) (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 (5 wt. % Cr loading) exhibits the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while (Cr2O3)7.5/SiO2 with a higher Cr loading leads to reductions in both (Table 2). Diffuse reflectance UV–vis results reveal the evolution of Cr structures along with the loadings: (i) Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates for all fresh catalysts and (ii) Cr(III) only exists in the form of (α-Cr2O3) at higher Cr loadings (i.e., ≥ 3.0 wt. %). The prominent activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 correlates to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates; yet high Cr loadings give rise to the formation of extended polychromate structures that are less active.
Redox Cycle
As shown in Figure 4, there exists a clear correlation of C3H6 yield with the number of redox sites, corroborating the important role of redox Cr species in assuring high C3H6 yield in CO2–ODHP. (22) However, the redox cycles are not unambiguously established. There are two major types of redox cycles that have been proposed, namely, Cr6+ ↔ Cr3+/Cr2+ and Cr3+ ↔ Cr2+. The former redox cycle is proposed on MCM-41- (Figure 5), TUD-1-, (11) and Al2O3-supported Cr catalysts, (80−82) while the latter is known on Ni-promoted (56) (Figure 5) and unpromoted CrOx/SiO2. (57) On the basis of these supported Cr catalysts, one can postulate a potential correlation of the nature of the support with Cr reducibility, as well as with Cr loading-dependent dispersion. Major progress has been made in unveiling the later correlation. However, the support effect has been scarcely studied.

On Cr-MCM-41 with high Cr dispersion, CO2 enables the completion of the redox cycle by reoxidizing the reduced Cr(III)O6 to Cr(VI)O4, though the oxidation efficiency is not comparable to O2 (Figure 5). (58) In contrast, Michorczyk et al. reported a redox cycle of Cr3+ ↔ Cr2+ on CrOx/SiO2 below a monolayer Cr coverage (0.34 Cr nm–2, see Table 3). (57) As shown in Table 2, C3H8 conversion increases with the rise of reaction temperatures, and C3H6 selectivity is higher than 94%. Meanwhile, CO2 conversion is evident, yet the values are not comparable to those of C3H8 conversion. In situ diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) spectra reveal that the reoxidation of Cr3+ to Cr6+ (eq 3-1) hardly occurs during regeneration, even if the catalyst is exposed to an excess of CO2. Hence, the redox-property scenario in O2–ODHP (i.e., Cr6+ → Cr3+/Cr2+) is unlikely replicated in CO2–ODHP (eq 3-2). Given their capability to catalyze both DHP and RWGS reactions, (83) CrOx might take part in the reaction through the redox cycle of Cr3+ → Cr2+ with H2, formed via RWGS (eq 3-3), as the reducing agent, followed by reoxidation of Cr2+ to Cr3+ by CO2 (eq 3-4). Of note, such a case might only happen below a monolayer coverage, because the migration of Cr3+ species to form stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow, giving rise to the further reduction of Cr3+ ↔ Cr2+.

Comprehensive reaction paths have been proposed by incorporating both redox and nonredox sites. (59) As illustrated in Figure 5, the oxidized CrOx and reduced CrOx–1 sites are proposed as the major active sites responsible for C3H8 dehydrogenation. Generally, the C3H6 yield increases with the concentration of Cr6+ species, indicative of their crucial role as precursors to form active species. At the initial stage, the reduction of Cr6+ species leads to the generation of Cr2+/Cr3+ species (i.e., CrOx–1), which triggers the C3H6 formation through a nonoxidative pathway. Also, the nonredox Cr3+ sites (CrOy), formed through Cr3+ oxide agglomeration, may contribute to the nonoxidative pathway, though insignificantly. Alternatively, the presence of CO2 contributes to the completion of the redox cycle, namely, CrOx ↔ CrOx–1, enabling C3H6 formation through the oxidative pathway. The presence of a redox cycle can boost the H2 consumption via RWGS and therefore promote C3H6 formation by shifting the equilibrium of the ODHP to the product side.
3.1.1.2. Effects of Support
The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity. Among support materials, metal oxides have been widely used, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2. For better Cr dispersion, ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups are also promising candidates. To clarify the support effect, the following aspects have been explored, including (i) metal–support interaction, (ii) acid–base properties in the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, and (iii) textural properties and their correlation with dispersion of Cr species and mass transfer.
Metal Oxides
In an early work led by Ge et al., the prominent activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 has been confirmed via screening tests on Cr2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, Cr2O3/γ-Al2O3, Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/TiO2, and Cr2O3/MCM-41 (Table 2). (51) Relatively weak metal–support interaction appears to benefit C3H6 formation, such as SiO2. (60) In the presence of CO2, the partially oxidized Cr2O3 surface and the boundaries of Cr2O3 and SiO2, are responsible for the improved C3H6 yield. (74,75) Although high CO2 conversion can be achieved on the ZrO2-supported counterpart, its strong basicity leads to lower C3H6 selectivity but higher selectivity toward CO and CH4. (51,60,61) Competitive adsorption between CO2 and C3H8 occurs on supports with amphoteric property, such as γ-Al2O3, leading to decreased catalytic performance (Table 2), especially at higher CO2 partial pressures. (62,82) MCM-41-supported Cr catalysts exhibit comparable activity to the SiO2-supported counterpart, which is associated with its ordered mesoporous structure with large surface area and pore volume. (51) Such prominence is also evident on SBA-15 and SBA-1 (Table 2). (54) The ordered mesoporous structure and large surface area not only helps to improve Cr surface density but also the dispersion of the Cr6+ species, thereby benefiting C3H6 formation.
Because of the high activity of Ga2O3 in CO2–ODHP (discussed in section 3.2.1), it has been applied as support for Cr catalysts with expectation of synergistic effect. Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr2O3/β-Ga2O3 with various loadings for CO2–ODHP. (63) The CO2-promoting effect is observed on Cr6.8/β-Ga2O3 at temperatures higher than ∼570 °C (Table 2). Adding Cr neutralizes the acid sites on β-Ga2O3, leading to coking resistance through a CO2-induced reverse Boudouard reaction.
Ordered, Mesoporous Silica (MCM-41, MSU-x, SBA-15/SBA-1, and TUD-1)
As mentioned above, the redox properties and appropriate dispersion of Cr species on the surface are important for CO2–ODHP. To achieve high activity and selectivity, introducing mesoporous silica as a support offers avenues to tune these factors. The materials that have been explored include MCM-41, MSU-x, SBA-15/SBA-1, and TUD-1.
MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, features well-ordered channels, controllable uniform pore size (2–10 nm), and large surface area, and can be incorporated by heteroatoms, such as Cr, into the wall substituting Si4+ and forming isolated active centers. (84) Direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods are effective in tuning the locations and coordination environments of the incorporated metal cations. (84−86) Wang et al. have prepared Cr-incorporated MCM-41 catalysts by both DHT and TIE methods, and found different Cr species in the calcined forms. (58) DHT results in monochromate species on the wall surface of MCM-41, while TIE produces a large quantity of polychromate species other than monochromate. Despite such differences, both catalysts are reduced from Cr6+ to Cr3+ oxide clusters during reaction, which explains their analogous activity and selectivity (Table 2). X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS) spectroscopic measurements reveal the reduction of Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination in the formed monochromate species to Cr(III)O6 octahedra during the reaction, in which Cr(VI)O4 is more active than Cr(III)O6. (80,81) CO2 enables the completion of the redox cycle by participating in the reoxidation of Cr(III)O6 to Cr(VI)O4 in Cr-MCM-41 (Figure 5). In a later work, Piotr et al. have also found prominent activity and selectivity on MCM-41-supported CrOx catalysts with optimal Cr loading at 6.8 wt. % (Table 2). (64) Similarly, well-dispersed Cr species play a pivotal role in promoting the catalytic performance; yet differently, a redox cycle of Cr2+ ↔ Cr3+ is proposed (Figure 5), analogous to the scenario reported by Yun et al. (56) and Ohishi et al. (87)
MSU-x features high surface area (600–1000 m2 g–1 and 3–5 nm pore size) and 3D wormlike channels, which can potentially improve the dispersion of Cr species and facilitate the diffusion of reagent molecules. (88) For these reasons, Liu et al. have prepared Cr-MSU-x catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (i.e., 1–20 wt. %) for CO2–ODHP. (65) C3H8 conversion reaches the highest at Cr = 5 wt. % at 550 °C (Table 2). At 600 °C, C3H8 conversion is as high as 50%, and C3H6 selectivity is 83.5%. A Cr loading-dependent transformation of Cr sites has been evident in the calcined catalysts, such as Cr(VI) in monochromate → V(VI) in di/trichromates → crystalline/amorphous α-Cr2O3. The trade-off between active Cr(VI) and α-Cr2O3 with elevated Cr loading determines the optimized Cr loading at 5 wt. %, and coordinatively unsaturated Cr(III) ions are active sites responsible for dehydrogenation.
A comparative study, led by Zhang et al., finds that a SBA-15-supported Cr catalyst exerts better catalytic performance and stability than γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and ZrO2-supported counterparts for CO2–ODHP (Table 2). (60) Such prominent activity and coking resistance are associated with the preservation of active Cr(III) species in the presence of CO2, weak metal–support interactions, and the high surface area of the support. Similarly, SBA-1 is also a promising candidate not only because of its high surface area, narrowed pore size, and 3D channels but also due to its characteristic cubic mesoporous phase, which is mechanically more stable than materials with hexagonal mesopores. (89,90) This is valuable for industrial applications where catalyst shaping processes are necessary. Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr-SBA-1 catalysts via a direct synthesis method using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), ammonium dichromate, and tetraethyl orthosilicate as surfactant, Cr precursor, and Si source, respectively. (66) The as-prepared catalysts present characteristic 3D pore structures, though the incorporation of Cr results in limited perturbation of the structural order. The catalytic performance varies depending on the Cr/Si molar ratios and reaches optimal performance at Cr/Si = 0.04 (Table 2). The same group has also continued their work by exploring the Cr loading-dependent evolution of Cr species on Cr/SBA-1 catalysts. (59) Incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) is used to prepare the catalysts because this allows a higher density of active sites, while preserving the pore structure. Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline α-Cr2O3 have been observed on Cr/SBA-15 catalysts in the calcined form, with Cr loading increasing from 1 to 15 wt. %. Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and dichromates present in all catalysts, regardless of Cr loadings; Cr5+ species exist at Cr loading below 7 wt. %; inactive α-Cr2O3 species can be detected at a Cr loadings higher than 5 wt. %. As compared in Table 2, the catalytic performance reaches maximum at Cr = 7 wt. % and barely changes with elevated Cr loadings, which is associated with the dominance of inactive α-Cr2O3 species. Similarly, activity performance is a function of well-dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ sites and the redox cycle, the formation of which stems from the rapid reduction of Cr6+ species upon contact with C3H8.
To better disperse CrOx species and facilitate mass transfer within the pores, TUD-1, with high surface area and unique 3D mesoporous network structure, has been introduced as support. (11) To ascertain the formation of CrOx with small, uniform crystals, a microwave irradiation method is used to prepare the catalysts. 5%Cr/TUD-1 exhibits higher C3H8 conversion at ∼24% and C3H6 selectivity at ∼90% at 550 °C (Table 2), while good stability at 8 h on stream is observed on 7%Cr/TUD-1. High catalytic performance can be attributed to the unique 3D mesoporous structure enabling the encapsulation of CrOx particles with high dispersion.
Activated Carbons (ACs)
ACs are also promising support materials because of their high surface area and abundant surface oxygen functional groups (OFGs) with tunable acid–base properties. Kuśtrowski et al. have introduced HNO3-activated AC with high surface area support for Cr catalysts and obtained optimal catalytic performance at Cr = 5 wt. % (Table 2). (67) Carbonyl and carboxyl species, known as respective basic and acid OFGs on the surface of AC, are identified as additional active sites in the reaction. Their gradual reduction with time on stream (TOS) is linked with the fast deactivation other than coking.
3.1.1.3. Effects of Promoter
CO2 has been proposed to participate in the redox cycles of Cr2+ → Cr3+ (59,64) or Cr3+ → Cr6+; (56,80,91) however, its oxidation potential is rather weak. Besides, CO2 is quite inert and not easily activated by CrOx. (59) The addition of O2 in the reactants as a co-feed with CO2 has been initially proposed to overcome these issues, yet the selectivity drops. (55) An alternative is to introduce promoters to facilitate CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts and to improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance.
Alkali Metal Oxides
Because of their basic property, alkali metal oxides have been widely used as promoters for CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions. (92) Ge et al. have prepared K-promoted Cr2O3/SiO2 with various K loadings for CO2–ODHP. (51) The addition of K results in the reduction of C3H8 conversion in comparison to unpromoted Cr2O3/SiO2, though a higher C3H6 selectivity is obtained (Table 2). According to characterization results, K addition modifies the Cr2O3 surface by decreasing its redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in the drop in C3H8 conversion. Similar impacts are evident on Li-/Na-promoted Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts, except that the stability of C3H6 yield can be improved by K. (93) IR results show that a substantial part of protons in hydroxyl groups on the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 are replaced by alkali metal ions, the loss of which accounts for the drop in activity on promoted catalysts.
Transition Metals (Ru and Ni)
Ru is a potential promoter because of its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation. (94,95) Jin et al. have prepared Ru-promoted Cr2O3/SiO2 and clarified the Ru loading-dependent reactivity in CO2–ODHP. (68) C3H8 conversion presents a volcano-like trend that maximizes at Ru = 1 wt. % with almost doubled C3H8 conversion and improved C3H6 selectivity in comparison to the unpromoted counterpart (Table 2). A proper amount of Ru plays an important role in optimizing activity and selectivity because it can balance the RWGS and C3H6 reforming.
Ni is also a potential candidate because of its activity in CO2 activation for CO2 reforming reactions (96,97) and RWGS. (98−100) Yun et al. have prepared Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalysts for CO2–ODHP. (56) In the calcined form, NiO and CrOx distribute in the vicinity of one another, and the presence of Ni can affect the Cr species by converting them to nickel chromate. The Ni-promoted catalyst outperforms the unpromoted counterpart in both activity and stability (Table 2). Particularly, CO2 conversion has been significantly improved. The major role of Ni is to facilitate CO2 dissociation to CO and an adsorbed O* next to the Ni site, which can subsequently regenerate Cr3+ via reoxidation.
3.1.1.4. Innovation in Preparation Methods
Dispersion and types of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts are crucial in determining the catalytic performance, and can be generally tuned by pH, ligand effect, and surfactant. Synthetic approaches include (N0Mn+)I0 pathway, (69) metal vapor synthesis method, (70) and sol–gel method. (71) Efforts are also devoted to improving selectivity while preserving activity of CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, as they present outstanding C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, though CH4 is dominant (section 3.1.1.2). Synthetic methods revolve around tuning the surface acid–base properties, crystalline structure, and textural properties. Developed synthetic approaches include hydrothermal methods (61) and acid–base pairs. (101)
(N0Mn+)I0 Pathway Driven by Electrostatic Driving Force
Dispersion of Cr6+ species and crystallite size are sensitive to pH during the synthesis. (69) At pH < 2, Cr species are present in the forms of tri- and tetrachromates (Cr3O102– and Cr4O132–, respectively), which are highly polymerized and susceptible to forming inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3; at 2 < pH < 6, the formation of smaller Cr anions, such as dichromate (Cr2O72–), is favored, leading to better Cr dispersion; at pH > 8, isolated CrO4– is stable but hardly leads to high activity for CO2–ODHP. To obtain highly dispersed Cr species with desired types, Baek et al. have introduced a (N0Mn+)I0 pathway to prepare MSU-x-supported Cr catalysts at pH = 4, in which N0 is a nonionic poly(ethylene oxide) surfactant, Mn+ is the metal cation, and I0 is an electrically neutral silica precursor, and the assembly process of metal cations is driven by electrostatic control. (69) Chromium(III) acetate hydroxide ((CH3CO2)7Cr3(OH)2) is used to offer both Cr3+ cations and electrostatic driving force, as well as helping to disperse the precursor molecules through the steric effect of ligands. The as-prepared catalysts present a mesopore structure resembling 3D wormhole-like holes with high surface areas (e.g., 730–903 m2 g–1), pore volumes (e.g., 0.71–1.03 cm3 g–1), and narrow pore size (e.g., 3.9–4.5 nm). Optimal catalytic performance is achieved at Cr = 1.27 wt. %, which also outperforms the catalyst prepared by IWI with the same Cr loading (Table 2). The H2-TPR profiles reveal the presence of isolated and polymeric Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts, which are designated as “hard” and “soft” Cr6+ species, respectively, based on their reducibility. Soft Cr6+ species are crucial to achieve high catalytic performance, while hard species have a negative impact on activity. During the reaction, these soft Cr6+ species-derived coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species promote RWGS and C3H6 formation through the redox cycle of Cr3+ ↔ Cr6+.
Metal Vapor Synthesis Method
The metal vapor synthesis (MVS) method enables the co-condensation of metal vapor with the vapor of weakly stabilizing organic ligands during the preparation, the well-defined organometallic species or solvent-stabilized metal clusters are formed, which is conducive to prepare supported metal catalysts on a wide range of organic and inorganic support materials. (102−105) On Cr-based catalysts, this method allows high Cr dispersion even at quite high loadings, particularly useful for the support with limited surface area. Botavina et al. have prepared Cr/SiO2 catalysts by the MVS method with a wide range of Cr loadings, namely, 0.25–10 wt. %. (70) An optimal Cr loading is obtained at 6.0 wt. % (Table 2), at which both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield have been substantially increased by ∼1.8- and ∼1.7-fold, respectively, in comparison to Cr0.25/SiO2, while the reduction of C3H6 selectivity is merely 7.3%.
Sol–Gel Method
Wang et al. have prepared CrOx-doped mesoporous silica sphere (Cr/MSS) catalysts by one-pot synthesis via a sol–gel method, and systematically investigated the influence of adding active precursors on the morphology, pore structure, and active species, as well as their correlation with catalytic performance. (71) Generally, all synthetic procedures entail the first step of preparing a surfactant solution (CTAB and triethanolamine, TEAH3) and the second step of adding a Si source. The catalysts are categorized into three groups, namely, MSS-1, MSS-2, and MSS-3, representing adding the Cr precursor in the first step, second step, and after the second step, respectively. For Cr/MSS-2, adding the Cr precursor concurrently with the Si source exerts well-dispersed Cr species on the micelle-silica walls with the gradual generation of silica walls, and no Cr species enter the core of the silica sphere. Such a feature results in high dispersion of Cr species with more isolated chromates, enhanced medium acid sites, and well-retained pore structure of the silica sphere. Therefore, Cr/MSS-2 exhibits the highest C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, with slightly lower C3H6 selectivity among three catalysts, and also outperforms the benchmark Cr/MSS-4, prepared by IWI (Table 2).
Hydrothermal Method
Oliveira et al. have prepared Cr/ZrO2 via a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, a facile, time-efficient method to prepare oxides with smaller crystallites through fast nucleation. (61) The incorporation of microwave results in the formation of smaller tetragonal t-ZrO2 crystallite. At lower Cr content (i.e., 5 wt. %), m-Cr/ZrO2, prepared by the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, displays higher activity in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield than c-Cr/ZrO2, prepared by a conventional hydrothermal method, but lower C3H6 selectivity, as well as faster deactivation (Table 2). Wu et al. have investigated the temperature effects of hydrothermal treatment on the catalytic performance on Cr–Zr bimetallic oxides, and obtained optimal activity and selectivity on the catalyst treated at 180 °C (Table 2). (72) At this temperature, more Cr6+ species, a precursor of active species Cr3+/Cr2+ species, are formed, leading to the substantially enhanced activity with well-retained high selectivity.
Acid–Base Pair
The “acid–base pair” concept is a self-adjusted process that has been widely used to prepare ordered, mesoporous multimetal oxides, (101) in which the pH of the desired sol–gel reaction is adjusted by a self-generated reaction medium between two or more inorganic species with the correct acidity. (106) Xie et al. have prepared Cr oxide-modified mesoporous ZrO2 (Cr-ZrO2) via the acid–base pair pathway. (73) The as-prepared bimetallic oxides feature mesoporous structures resembling 3D wormholes. The crystalline structure of ZrO2 shifts from a monoclinic to tetragonal, then to disordered crystals with the increased Cr content, which in turn affects the dispersion of Cr species. 7Cr-ZrO2 presents more abundant well-dispersed Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species, which are precursors for the formation of active Cr3+/Cr2+ species during reaction, thereby leading to the highest initial activity and selectivity (Table 2).
3.1.1.5. Deactivation and Regeneration
Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts. Coking is relatively easier to reverse by reoxidation; moreover, the presence of CO2 can help to remove coke in situ through a reverse Boudouard reaction or to inhibit the coking process. (73) Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550–650 °C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable. For example, regeneration in O2 at 600 °C for 5 min can completely restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, and such recovery is repeatable after 4 cycles. (67) Differently, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, beyond which, however, it cannot prevent the catalyst from further deactivation. Alternatively, co-feeding O2 in CO2–ODHP can promote the removal of coke during the reaction, but it is accompanied by a drastic decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2–C3 olefin selectivity. (55)
By contrast, a complete recovery of active sites is rather challenging yet is still achievable if a proper method is used to prepare well-dispersed Cr species. As aforementioned (section 3.1.1.4), Baek et al. have introduced a (N0Mn+)I0 pathway to prepare MSU-x-supported Cr catalysts with highly dispersed Cr species. (69) The activity can be completely recovered under simple oxidation in air at 650 °C, retaining its repeatability after 6 cycles.
From a practical point of view, increasing Cr loading while preserving high dispersion is necessary to attain comparable catalytic performance that meets industrial requirements. However, the formation of inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 is inevitable at higher Cr loadings, the presence of which limits the activity and is also detrimental to stability. To overcome this issue, Botavina et al. have prepared highly dispersed Cr–SiO2 catalysts by direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. (21) By following the procedure of MCM-41 synthesis, the as-prepared catalysts exhibit MCM-41-type mesoporous structure with high surface area (600–1000 m2 g–1). Long-term tests demonstrate better stability of Cr2.0–SiO2 in C3H8 conversion after 900 min on stream in the joint presence of CO2 and O2 (Figure 6A), but accompanied by a lower C3H6 yield than the other reaction conditions (Figure 6B). The improved stability originates from the trade-off between the reduced C3H6 yield and increased C2H4 yield (Table 2). Notably, a relatively well-retained yield is obtained under the condition of CO2 alone (Figure 6B). Spectroscopic studies (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy) reveal that the average oxidation state of Cr in CO2–ODHP is 2+, which is lower than that (i.e., Cr3+) in the presence of co-fed O2. This is indicative of a lower probability of forming crystalline α-Cr2O3 if CO2 is the only oxidant. Apparently, the combination of the soft oxidant CO2 and well-dispersed Cr species in the 3D pore structure with high surface area is effective in avoiding fast deactivation and in prolonging the catalyst lifetime.

As discussed in section 3.1.1.2, the unique pore structure and large surface area of mesoporous support materials are effective in confining the growth of Cr species and affecting dispersion and structure of Cr species. However, the preservation of pore structure and porosity under reaction conditions is challenging. Michorczyk et al. find that the irreversible degradation of the pore structure after multiple cycles leads to decreased selectivity on Cr0.04-SBA-1. (66) An option to preserve the unique pore structure is to control the Cr loading at a lower level, however, this sacrifices the activity. Choosing proper synthetic methods to prepare catalysts provides solutions to overcome this issue. Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr/SBA-1 catalyst by IWI. (59) Compared to the Cr-SBA-1 prepared by direct synthesis method, the pore structure of IWI-prepared catalysts is preserved to a larger degree, significantly alleviating the irreversible deactivation caused by pore collapse.
3.1.2. Vanadium(V)-Based Catalysts
3.1.2.1. Identification of Active V Sites and Redox Cycle
VOx is another redox-active metal oxide that has been extensively studied in the O2–ODHP reaction, and the overoxidation still impairs the effort to achieve high C3H6 selectivity. Early attempts have tried to neutralize the sites for overoxidation on vanadate catalysts. Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorption–desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites. (107,108)
Similar to CrOx, catalytic performance of VOx depends on its structure, dispersion, and interaction with the support. (1) Depending on the ratio of metal loading and surface area of support, four types of VOx species are present during reaction, including monovanadate, oligomeric vanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite. (77,109)Figure 7 illustrates the evolution of surface VOx configurations as a function of surface V density on VOx/Al2O3. Monovanadate VOx species are proposed as active sites (see Table 3 for monolayer surface density on various metal oxide supports). The oxygen of V═O (vanadyl) groups of the monomeric VOx species are reported to account for propylene formation. (115) As the vanadia surface density increases, oligomeric species appear to emerge and are considered more active for propylene synthesis than the monomeric species. (77) Bulk V2O5 favors overoxidation, thus reducing C3H6 selectivity. (77,110,111) Noteworthily, there is another type of proposed active site at submonolayer V coverages, in which the bridging V–O-support bond is critical for O2–ODHP. (1) Its strength appears to associate to the ODHP reaction kinetics, as evidenced from the variations in apparent activation energy among vanadium catalysts supported on NbO5, SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, and TiO2. However, this scenario is scarcely reported in CO2–ODHP.
Figure 7
Figure 7. Schematic illustration of surface V density-dependent configurational evolutions of VOx species on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. (77,109)
Results of isothermal reduction confirm that CO2 cannot reoxidize the catalyst completely to V2O5 but is capable of oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4. (28) Redox mechanisms have been proposed on the silsesquioxane cluster with an isolated V5+–O–V3+ pair via density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the entire reaction network including CO2–ODHP, DHP, and RWGS. (28) As illustrated in Figure 8, V4+ plays an important role in the activation of the secondary C–H bond of C3H8 (RDS) by hydrogen abstraction in both CO2–ODHP and DHP routes. Yet the regeneration of active V sites differs, in which V3+ can be reoxidized through the dissociative CO2 adsorption, while the regeneration in DHP follows the path of hydrogen migration from the bridge oxygen to V3+ → hydrogen migration from the vanadyl oxygen (V5+–O–H) to bridge oxygen → desorption of H2. In RWGS, V4+ sites are involved in H2 dissociation and water formation and desorption. CO2 dissociation also occurs on reduced V3+ sites, reoxidizing V3+ sites through oxygen abstraction. Of note, alternative redox cycles have also been known, such as the V5+ ↔ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst. (112)

3.1.2.2. Effects of Support
Mesoporous silica has been introduced as support to prepare VOx catalysts with high dispersion. (1) However, these materials have long, isolated channels and inefficient mass transfer, leading to low catalytic activity. (113) Therefore, mesoporous materials with short-range, ordered mesopores with highly dispersed VOx species are desired. Xue et al. have prepared homogeneous, monodispersed 3D dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres (3D dendritic MSNSs) and used them as support for VOx catalysts. (114) The catalysts have been prepared via an oil–water biphase stratification reaction system that allows the delicate control of monolayer coverage and prohibit agglomeration of V species to V2O5. The as-prepared catalyst displays higher C3H6 selectivity and comparable C3H8 conversion in comparison to other catalysts in Table 4. Both conversion and selectivity can be completely recovered after simple reoxidation in air.

Diamond is another form of carbon that can be a potential support candidate, because its surface can be functionalized with various surface oxygen functional groups (OFGs), such as C–O–C ether type structures and C═O carbonyl type structures, through oxidative treatment in acids (HNO3, HClO, H2O2, etc.) and oxidation in O2. (115,116) Nakagawa et al. have introduced oxidized commercial diamond as a support and conducted comparative studies among different metal oxides and support materials for CO2–ODHP. (112) Cr and V oxides supported on diamond display better catalytic performance than other metal oxides, including Ga, Mn, and Fe oxides (Table 4). Of note, the diamond-supported VOx catalyst outperforms Al2O3-, SiO2-, and activated carbon (AC)-supported VOx catalysts in terms of VOx surface area-based C3H6 formation rates.
3.1.2.3. Effects of Promoter
VOx/SiO2 possesses a lower monolayer coverage of VOx (∼3.3 V nm–2) compared to more reactive oxide support materials such as Al2O3 (∼7–8 V nm–2). (117) To enrich the surface VOx species with monovanadate and improve their retention against compression to form polymerized species or bulk V2O5, incorporating another metal component featuring a noninteracting nature offers avenues to achieve this goal. (30) Tungsten oxide (WOx) is known to influence the dispersion of VOx in this regard. (1,118,119) Ascoop et al. have introduced WOx into VOx/SiO2 catalysts for CO2–ODHP. (28) The highest C3H6 turnover frequency (TOF) is obtained at W/V = 0.1 molar ratio, while W/V = 0.6 achieves the highest C3H6 selectivity. The apparent activation energy (127–147 kJ mol–1) appears to be independent of W/V molar ratios, demonstrating that the WOx addition only preserves VOx dispersion rather than mediating active sites. Sandupatla et al. have carried out comparative studies among Cr2O3-, MoO3-, and WO3-modifed VOx/Al2O3 catalysts under a monolayer VOx coverage. (30) The catalytic performance of monometallic oxide catalysts decreases in the order of V > Cr > Mo > W (Table 4), and both Mo and W display poor activity. By sharp contrast, the mixed oxide catalysts V7Mo5 and V7W7 exert synergistic promoting effects on C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, especially for V7W7, while that synergy is absent for V7Cr4. Characterization results imply that these metal oxides are noninteracting with one another in the mixed oxides, and both VOx and CrOx are more readily reduced than MoOx and WOx. Another reason for the less synergetic effect on V7Cr4 originates from the improved CO2 adsorption on more reduced V and Cr sites, leading to CO2 poisoning. (30) To alleviate CO2 poisoning, a relatively higher but proper CO2 partial pressure is necessary to ensure more oxidized metal species for the ODHP reaction. Na-promoted SiO2 supports have also been employed in an attempt to anchor more monovanadate species with the surface Si–O–Na+. (120) Characterization results confirm the improved surface V density, but along with the formation of inactive Na metavanadate species that selectively produce CO instead of C3H6 (Table 4).

3.2.1. Identification of Active Ga2O3 Polymorphs
To establish the correlation between activity and Ga2O3 polymorphs, Zheng et al. have evaluated the activity performance of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs for CO2–ODHP. (121) β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5). Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3. Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites. Such differences in Lewis acidity explain the activity trend. On the other hand, surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8. Nevertheless, the surface base site density shows the correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of reaction. Combined with the weak reducibility of Ga2O3 (1–5 mol % of the fresh Ga2O3) and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ in catalysts (XPS), one can postulate that the reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP but only at the initial stage of the reaction. At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle, which is discussed in section 3.2.3.

3.2.2. Mixed Ga-Containing Oxide Catalysts
Ga2O3−Al2O3 solid solutions are characteristic of unique surface acid properties and have shown promising reactivity in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with hydrocarbons. (122−124) Chen et al. have prepared mixed GaxAl10–xO15 (i.e., x = 2, 5, and 8) oxides with high surface areas (e.g., 119–147 m2 g–1). (53) These solid solution catalysts enable the changes of Ga ions between tetrahedral Ga(IV) and octahedral Ga(VI) sites by tuning the Ga/Al ratios. The proportion of Ga(IV) sites correlates to weak acid sites, as shown in Figure 9A, implying the essential role of tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in creating the surface acidity. Ga8Al2O15 oxide exhibits the best catalytic performance among all solid solution catalysts, and far outperforms the benchmark γ-Ga2O3 in C3H8 conversion (Table 5). Furthermore, a positive correlation of surface area-based weak acid site density with initial C3H8 conversion is evident in Figure 9B. Combined with the fact that Brønsted acid sites are absent in these catalysts, these tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in the form of Al3+–O–Ga3+ are weak Lewis acid sites that account for dehydrogenation reactions. (125) The Ga2O3–Al2O3 solid solution catalysts also exhibit better stability than the benchmark γ-Ga2O3, which is attributed to the improved desorption of C3H6 on Ga–Al catalysts, as evidenced from transient responses of pulsed C3H6 adsorption.

Mixed Ga2O3–ZrO2 oxides have also been prepared by a coprecipitation method for CO2–ODHP. (126) The as-prepared catalysts present higher surface areas (e.g., 34–59 m2 g–1) than the bare ZrO2 (e.g., 19 m2 g–1). Characterization results confirm the homogeneous mixing of Ga with Zr in the oxides with strong interactions, as well as the monotonic increase in Lewis acid sites with the increase in Ga content in the oxides. These features can be reflected from enhanced C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield (Table 5). However, the C3H6 selectivity is not comparable to Ga2O3–Al2O3 solid solution catalysts under isoconversional conditions (Table 5).
3.2.3. Effects of Support
The nature of the support and its interaction with gallium oxide are crucial to manipulate the reactivity, and can be reflected in the differences in H2 adsorption capacities and acid–base properties. (127) Early efforts have been put forth to modify the acid–base properties of Ga2O3 catalysts by introducing alkali metal oxides such as K. (23) However, the incorporated K covers the acid sites on Ga2O3, exerting a negative impact on both conversion and selectivity (Table 5)
Xu et al. have systematically investigated the support effect by using TiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, and MgO as support materials in DHP and CO2-DOHP, and studied the aspects of acid–base properties, adsorption properties, and metal–support interactions. (127) TiO2-, ZrO2-, and Al2O3-supported Ga2O3 catalysts display higher activity than MgO- and SiO2-supported counterparts, again corroborating the crucial role of acid sites on Ga2O3 for C3H8 dehydrogenation (Table 5). Ga2O3/MgO shows the lowest activity and selectivity toward C3H6 production due to the strong basicity of MgO, which not only neutralizes the acid sites on Ga2O3 but also favors CO2 adsorption over C3H8. A similar negative impact on activity is also evident for the Li-promoted MgO catalyst. (128)
Since these catalysts show no reduction behavior as evidenced from H2-TPR profiles, the C3H6 formation on Ga2O3 should not proceed through redox mechanisms but rather by following the heterolytic dissociation pathway. Detailed steps in the absence and presence of CO2, as well as the conjugated effect of gallium oxide and the proton on DHP, are illustrated in Figure 10A. (129) For C3H8 heterolytic dissociation (eqs 3-6 and 3-7 in Figure 10) in DHP, eq 3-6 (Figure 10) proceeds slowly and is, therefore, proposed as the RDS. The presence of acid sites can facilitate eqs 3-10 and 3-11 (Figure 10), providing an alternative to promote C3H6 formation by bypassing eq 3-6 (Figure 10). Such a reaction path likely occurs in the cases of TiO2-, ZrO2-, and Al2O3-supported Ga2O3 catalysts with abundant acid sites. For CO2–ODHP, dissociative chemisorbed H2 from eqs 3-6 and 3-10 (Figure 10) can be removed through eq 3-8 (i.e., RWGS), as well as eq 3-7(Figure 10). On Ga2O3/TiO2, eq 3-8 is faster than eq 3-7 (Figure 10). More produced H2 is consumed through RWGS, therefore, significantly boosting C3H6 formation by shifting the equilibrium because of the weak adsorption of H2. Eq 3-7 (Figure 10) is fast and still a dominant reaction for the cases of Al2O3-, ZrO2-, and MgO-supported catalysts. Therefore, the CO2-promoting effect on these catalysts is absent (Figure 10B). The promoting effect is not evident on Ga2O3/SiO2 either, resulting from its poor activity in RWGS (Figure 10B). The absence of the CO2-promoting effect is also reported for Ga2O3–Al2O3 solid solution catalysts. (53) Another drawback of Ga2O3/TiO2 is that the presence of abundant reduced Gaδ+ on the surface is detrimental to C3H6 selectivity (Table 5), as it is known with high aromatization efficiency. (130)

3.2.4. Explorations to Prepare Ga2O3 with High Surface Area
β-Ga2O3 is the most active among all Ga2O3 polymorphs, yet its surface area (e.g., 30 m2 g–1) limits its overall activity. For the DHP reaction, various methods have been developed to tune the textural properties of Ga2O3, such as the nanocasting technique using mesoporous carbon as a hard template (131) and the urea-based hydrothermal method using polyethylene glycol as a soft template agent. (132) The former method enables a significant increase in surface area up to 307 m2 g–1, but it is tedious and time-consuming; the latter one exerts limited accessible area (∼29 m2 g–1).
Wu et al. have demonstrated a method to synthesize mesoporous Ga2O3 with high surface area using a water-soluble, ecofriendly sucrose as a nonsurfactant template. (133) By increasing the sucrose/Ga2O3 molar ratio, the surface area of as-prepared β-Ga2O3 can be varied in the range of 65–98 m2 g–1. Among the catalysts, β-Ga2O3–S4 (sucrose/Ga2O3 molar ratio = 4) exhibits the highest catalytic performance, and outperforms the thermal decomposition-prepared β-Ga2O3 (Table 5). Furthermore, nearly 90% initial activity can be recovered after regeneration, which surpasses the value (∼74%) reported by Zheng et al. (121)
To prepare Ga2O3 with high surface area and mesophase, other soft templating approaches have been undertaken. (134,135) However, these are rather challenging because the yielded surfactant–Ga2O3 mesophase often collapses during thermal treatment, resulting in poorly ordered mesoporous Ga2O3 with low surface area. A nanocasting technique using a hard template, on the other hand, provides avenues to improve the heat tolerance, which uses a well-ordered, mesoporous structured matrix as a hard template, such as siliceous (e.g., SBA-15, KIT-6) or carbonaceous (e.g., CMK-3) materials. Michorczyk et al. have used SBA-15 as a hard template to prepare mesoporous Ga2O3-m and mixed Ga2O3–Al2O3 oxides (Ga/Al = 4/1 and 1/4) by the nanocasting method. (136) The as-prepared catalysts feature (i) high surface area, ranging from 231 to 322 m2 g–1, wherein the mixed oxide catalysts even show higher surface area than Ga2O3-m, (ii) uniform mesopores in the range of 3–14 nm, and (iii) characteristic pore architectures analogous to SBA-15 (hexagonal structure). As listed in Table 5, Ga2O3-m and Ga2O3–Al2O3(4/1) show comparable initial C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity as the benchmark Ga2O3-t, which is produced by thermal decomposition of precursors. Notably, the nanocasting technique-prepared catalysts exert better stability, and all surpass the benchmark Ga2O3-t at TOS = ∼3.75 h, particularly for Ga2O3–Al2O3(1/4). A short regeneration in air can help Ga2O3-m almost completely recover its activity.
Alternatively, Xiao et al. have prepared Ga2O3–Al2O3 (GA) catalysts with high surface area (i.e., 234 and 220 m2 g−1, respectively) by hydrothermal synthesis (HS) and coprecipitation method (CP). (137) GA-HS exhibits the highest C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5). In addition to high surface area, the HS-prepared catalyst also features large pore sizes and more tetrahedral Ga ions as Lewis acid sites, all of which give rise to the improved catalytic performance.
3.3. Zeolite-Supported Catalysts
As discussed in section 3.1.1.3, the nature of the support has a crucial role in affecting metal dispersion and preserving redox Cr species; therefore, it strongly influences catalytic performance in CO2–ODHP. In addition to the aforementioned mesoporous silica and various metal oxides, zeolites are also promising support materials because of their microporosity with large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. (138−140) To selectively activate C–H bond rather than C–C bond, the modification of acid sites is critical, especially the strong acid sites. (22) Dealumination is widely used to eliminate the surface acidity, and approaches include acid treatment (22) and steaming treatments at temperatures. (141,142) Weakening acidity is an alternative to control the surface acidity and can be achieved by tuning the Al amount (143) and incorporating another element into the framework of zeolite to displace the original strong Brønsted acid sites. (144) Zeolites that have been introduced as a support include Beta zeolite, (22) HZSM-5 (141) and phosphorus-modified HZSM-5, (144) HZSM-48, (145,146) and boron-containing MFI. (147)
3.3.1. Dealumination
3.3.1.1. Acid Treatment
Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr-loaded Beta zeolite catalysts by wet impregnation for CO2–ODHP. (22) Acid sites of the tetraethylammonium Beta (TEABeta) support are eliminated by dealumination with a nitric acid solution, resulting in SiBeta zeolite with Si/Al at 1000. For comparison, AlBeta is prepared by simple calcination of TEABeta with a lower Si/Al ratio of 17. As listed in Table 6, C3H8 and CO2 conversion and C3H6 selectivity show an increase with an increase in Cr loading on Cr-SiBeta catalysts under the same reaction conditions, and are all higher than those on Cr-AlBeta. This demonstrates that a high concentration of strong acid prefers C3H8 cracking, thus significantly promoting the formation of C2H6, C2H4, and CH4.

3.3.1.2. Steaming Treatment
Ga-loaded HZSM-5 catalysts become a potential candidate for CO2–ODHP because of their reported high activity in aromatization of light paraffins. (148) The reaction is proposed to follow a bifunctional mechanism, in which Ga2O3 accounts for catalyzing propane dehydrogenation to light alkenes, while Brønsted acid sites are responsible for subsequent oligomerization of light alkenes and the cyclization of C6–C9 alkenes. (148) To transfer this catalyst into CO2–ODHP, treatments are necessary to eliminate the acid sites or weaken their strength on HZSM-5 by dealumination. Xu et al. have carried out dealumination on HZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al = 60) by steaming treatments at temperatures (i.e., 600–800 °C), followed by loading Ga2O3 via IWI. (141) NH3–TPD results indicate that the number of acid sites monotonically decreases with the rise of steaming temperature. The dealumination not only enables the reduction of the acid sites on HZSM-5, but it also weakens the interaction between Ga2O3 and HZSM-5, resulting in an additional decease in the number of acid sites. As proposed in Figure 10A, CO2–ODHP proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway on the gallium oxide catalysts. The presence of strong acid sites on HZSM-5 can facilitate the conjugated effect of protons and gallium oxide, resulting in promoted activity (eq 3-10 in Figure 10A). However, excess acid sites on HZSM-5 can promote coke formation via oligomerization and cyclization, causing deactivation. Therefore, a balance of such a trade-off can optimize the catalytic performance on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 treated at 700 °C (Table 6).
Zhu et al. eliminate the acid sites on boron-containing MFI zeolite-supported CrOx catalysts by steaming treatment. (147) Cr/H[B]MFI exhibits higher C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity than the benchmark Cr/silicate-1 (Table 6). The steaming-treated catalyst, namely Cr/H[B]MFI-st, has comparable C3H6 selectivity, yet lower C3H8 conversion. Characterization results demonstrate that the steaming treatment results in the autoreduction of some Cr6+ to Cr3+ which is located at the ion-exchange sites in the vicinity of boron sites. As known in the literature, Cr3+ polychromate is less active for CO2–ODHP than Cr6+ monochromate, though it still can catalyze the reaction. (80) This explains the lower conversion observed on Cr/H[B]MFI-st. Noteworthily, Cr/H[B]MFI-st presents higher C3H8 conversion after TOS = ∼40 h, indicating its better stability than Cr/H[B]MFI.
3.3.2. Surface Acidity Weakening
Increasing Si/Al ratios is an option to weaken the acidity. HZSM-48 is also a candidate of support material because of its medium pore size and high Si/Al molar ratio, accompanied by weaker acidity compared to HZSM-5. (145,146) Ren et al. have prepared a Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalysts with the Si/Al ratios from 130 to 220, and performed comparative studies with Ga2O3/HZSM-5 for CO2–ODHP. (149) HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher C3H6 selectivity than the HZSM-5 supported counterpart and comparable C3H6 yield, but lower C3H8 conversion (Table 6). Despite high selectivity, Ga2O3/HZSM-48 has worse stability than the HZSM-5-supported counterpart. This can be ascribed to weak-acid-induced side reactions, through which the formed coke clogs the 2D channels. This is reflected from the more serious degradation of pores on HZSM-48 after reaction than on HZSM-5.
Differently, Ren et al. tune the Si/Al molar ratio (i.e., 60–242) of ZnO/HZSM-5 by varying the amount of Al source, namely, NaAlO2, during preparation. (143) As proposed, the reaction proceeds through dissociative adsorption of C3H8 on Zn oxide sites and a subsequent one-step elimination to produce H2 and C3H6. This requires that both [Zn–C3H7]+ and the framework attached H+ ions are in proximity. Therefore, the presence of protons from the zeolite framework can facilitate the recovery of active sites, resulting in enhanced activity. However, excess acid sites are detrimental to the activity and stability because of the catalyzed reactions to form coke. Therefore, an optimal Si/Al ratio is obtained at 160 with the highest C3H6 yield (Table 6). At TOS = 10 h, the C3H8 conversion drops from 68.3% to 50.2%. Regeneration in O2 twice can help to completely recover the C3H8 conversion. Alternatively, dealumination of the ZnO/HZSM-5 catalysts has also been examined by a steaming treatment, and the 650 °C-treated catalyst exhibits the highest C3H6 yield and C3H8 conversion (Table 6). (142)
Introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 is another option to displace the original strong Brønsted acid sites by newly created weakened Brønsted acid sites, as well as to improve hydrothermal stability. (144) Compared to the benchmark Ga2O3/HZSM-5, the enhanced activity and yield are evident (Table 6); yet the Ga2O3/P-HZSM-5 catalysts fail to show comparable C3H8 conversion or C3H6 yield to the steaming-treated, P-free catalyst Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700). The created weak acid sites barely show any promotional effect on C3H6 formation, while mainly on side reactions, thus leading to deactivation. Clearly, reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is a more effective approach to boost C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 than weakening the acidity.
3.4. Other Transition Metal Catalysts
3.4.1. Fe-Based Catalysts
3.4.1.1. Fe2O3 Catalysts
Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2–ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane. (150−153) Michorczyk et al. have conducted screening tests on bare Fe2O3, supported Fe2O3 (active carbon (AC) and γ-Al2O3) catalysts, and hydrotalcite-derived Mg–Fe oxides. (154) Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7). H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe. However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived Fe–Mg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support. For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix. Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2–ODHP. Noteworthily, the absence of H2 from the reaction excludes the occurrence of RWGS. Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant.

3.4.1.2. Fe–Ni Bimetallic Catalysts
To prepare cost-effective, selective, and coke-resistant catalysts for CO2–ODHP, Gomez et al. have conducted screening tests of monometallic and bimetallic transition metals and attempted to establish a library to determine the inherent activity toward either ODHP or DRP. (155) Transition metals that are active in ODHP and dry reforming, as well as efficient in coke resistance, were chosen, such as Fe, Ni/Co, and Pt/Pd. The FexNiy catalysts favor the CO2–ODHP path, and selectivity can be manipulated by varying the Ni content; others are active and selective for the DRP path (Table 7). The same group has continued to examine the competitive paths between CO2–ODHP and DRP at industrial operational conditions over these catalysts. (12) Monometallic catalysts exhibit low activity and selectivity toward C3H6 production (Table 7). The combination of Fe and Ni substantially improves both activity and selectivity, while combining Ni and Pt favors dry reforming products with much higher conversion of both reactants (Table 7). Clearly, there is a synergistic effect on Fe3Ni1 (i.e., C3H6 yield = 1.6%) in comparison to the simple sum of yields on the monometallic counterpart (e.g., 0.4% and 0.2% for Ni1 and Fe3, respectively). In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements (XANES and EXAFS) demonstrate that the Ni3Pt catalyst consists of metallic Pt and Ni with the formation of Pt–Ni bimetallic bonds, while the metallic Ni and oxidized Fe species present an inserted oxygen through Fe–O–Fe, as well as Fe–O bonds. Combined with DFT calculations, C–H bond scission is shown to be more thermodynamically favorable and kinetically feasible than C–C bond scission on the bulk-terminated Fe3Ni(111) surface (Figure 11A), while Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) favors C–C bond scission (Figure 11B). Other identified interfacial active sites Fe–O–Ni show competitiveness in the first step of C–H and C–C bond scissions, whereas the following step of C–H scission is downhill in energy, while that of C–C scission is uphill in energy (Figure 11C). These results corroborate the crucial roles of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni in C3H6 production.

3.4.1.3. Fe–Ce Solid Solution Catalysts
Inspired by the well-recognized characteristics of CeO2 in improving oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity, Wang et al. report Fe-doped CeO2 solid solution catalysts for CO2–ODHP. (29) Among the catalysts with Fe/Ce ratios from 1 to 15%, both activity (C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield) and C3H6 selectivity are optimized at higher Fe/Ce ratios (Table 7). Deactivation as a consequence of coking occurs at low Fe/Ce ratios (i.e., <5%), while the FeCeO2 catalysts with higher Fe/Ce ratios (i.e., >5%) suffer from CeO2 crystal sintering and Fe migration to form nanosized crystals. Therefore, Fe5CeO2 has the optimal activity at Fe/Ce = 5 and exerts stable performance for more than 20 h on stream.
3.4.2. Mo-Based Catalysts: Mo2C
Supported Mo2C is reported to be active for methane conversion to benzene, in which Mo2C is crucial in activating the C–H bond of methane and subsequently forming CHx fragments on the surface. (156,157) Also, it is established as an effective catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2. (158) On the basis of these findings, Solymosi et al. have prepared SiO2-supported Mo2C catalysts and evaluated their catalytic performance in CO2–ODHP. (159) At low temperatures (i.e., ≤ 500 °C), CO2 adsorption is too weak to dissociate on Mo2C, leading to poor activity at 500 °C, though a high C3H6 selectivity is attained (Table 7). At high temperatures (i.e., 670 °C), CO2 can oxidize Mo2C, resulting in enhanced activity, yet C3H6 selectivity is compromised because of the thermo-induced cracking to C2H4 (Table 7). Oxidation of Mo2C with CO2 is proposed as the initial step to activate the Mo2C surface, through which the Mo oxycarbide is formed with active oxygen to activate the methylene C–H bond in C3H8 molecules. (160)
3.4.3. Precious Metal Catalysts (Rh, Ru, Pt, and Pd)
An early work, led by Solymosi et al., shows that Al2O3-, SiO2-, TiO2-, and MgO-supported Rh catalysts have relatively low C3H6 selectivity (i.e., 50–60%) in the DHP reaction at 550–650 °C, along with the C3H8 conversion varying from ∼1 to 6%. (161) In the presence of CO2, the reaction pathway shifts from DHP to dry reforming of propylene on the Rh catalyst, resulting in the dominance of CO and H2 with decreased C3H6 selectivity. Similar results are also evident on the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (162) and supported Au catalysts. (163) CO and H2 become the major products in the case of Ru/CeO2 and Ru/ZrO2, regardless of the reducibility of these support materials. (164) Precious and noble metals are active in C–C cleavage and the dry reforming reaction, which make them less suitable for catalyzing CO2–ODHP as a single active component. An option to use precious metals is to make them an assistant component responsible for the regeneration of active sites.
Ceria proves to be an effective catalyst for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, and the high activity is linked with its oxygen storage/release capacity (OSC) in terms of creation and replenishment of oxygen vacancies. (165−168) Adding ZrO2 into CeO2 endows the formed bimetallic oxides with more stabilized oxygen vacancies; moreover, CO2 dissociation can occur on CeZrOx and lead to a highly oxidized state of Ce. (169) To improve the durability of such oxide combination, Al2O3 is used as the underlying support. (170) Inspired by the functionalities of these components in mixed oxide catalysts, Nowicka et al. have prepared Pd catalysts supported on CeZrAlOx mixed oxides with various compositions and evaluated their activity in CO2–ODHP. (171) Screening tests clarify that the optimal composition and Pd loading are obtained on Ce0.25Zr0.25Al0.5Ox-supported Pd catalyst (Table 7); Pd/Ce0.25Zr0.25Al0.5Ox also displays long-term stability of C3H8 conversion from 40 to 140 h on stream, along with a slight rise of C3H6 selectivity from ∼94% to 98%. As proposed in Figure 12, reactions on Ce0.25Zr0.25Al0.5Ox proceed through a combined Mars van Krevelen (MvK) and RWGS mechanism linked by a common step. The lattice oxygen ions abstract H from C3H8 to form C3H6 and H2O. CO2 takes part in the replenishment of the consumed O species in both Ce0.25Zr0.25Al0.5Ox and Pd sites, releasing CO as a byproduct. Of note, Pd only promotes the oxidation activity of the redox sites Ce3+ ↔ Ce4+ in the catalyst rather than the secondary reaction, such as dry reforming of propylene. Therefore, its presence boosts overall C3H8 conversion without sacrificing C3H6 selectivity.

3.5. Roles of CO2 in CO2–ODHP
Early work has considered co-fed CO2 merely as a diluent and heating medium, yet continuing studies unravel its other important roles. (57) Liu et al. have conducted DFT studies of CO2–ODHP over Ga2O3(100) surface and suggested that C3H6 forms via DHP in CO2–ODHP. (172) Positive roles of CO2 include (i) reoxidizing the reduced catalyst surface, (ii) shifting the reaction equilibrium to the product side of CO2–ODHP by consuming the produced H2 via RWGS, and (iii) removing surface deposited carbon via reverse Boudouard reaction. These positive effects are generally applicable to all catalysts that have been developed but vary depending on the redox properties of the active metal oxides and the nature of the support. Negative impacts also exist, which are mainly reflected in the competitive CO2 adsorption against C3H8.
3.5.1. Oxidation State and Redox Cycle
Redox-active metal oxides can be reduced upon the contact with C3H8. In comparison to the direct DHP reaction, a donation of oxygen species in CO2 can help to maintain Cr at high oxidation states. (173,174) Despite the weak oxidizing potential, CO2 can take part in the reoxidation of CrOx to complete the redox cycle, benefiting C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6. This positive role in the case of CrOx has already been discussed in section 3.1. Similarly, adding CO2 can change the redox properties of the V-based catalysts, such as the oxidation states. Takahara et al. report that using CO2 as an oxidant results in the presence of V5+ rather than V4+/V3+ in the direct DHP reaction. (175) In DHP, the V–OH sites adjacent to V4+/V3+ are proposed as acid sites on VOx, which are detrimental to C3H6 yield by boosting the reaction of propylene to aromatics. (176) CO2 addition reduces the number of acid sites by changing the oxidation state to V5+, leading to a higher propylene yield by inhibiting aromatization.
3.5.2. CO2-Promoting Effects in Shifting Reaction Equilibrium of CO2–ODHP
Isotope-labeling experiments have been conducted by introducing D2 in the feed with C3H8 and CO2, and revealed only 45% of the formed water contains D2O. (28) This observation confirms the existence of parallel-consecutive reaction networks consisting of ODHP, DHP, and RWGS. Figure 13 shows changes in the C3H6 formation rate during switch-operation mode between DHP and CO2−ODHP on CrSiBeta and CrAlBeta catalysts. (22) Clearly, the CO2-promoting effect on C3H6 formation is only evident on the CrSiBeta catalyst, as evidenced from the alternatingly highest C3H6 and H2 formation rates in CO2–ODHP (Figure 13A). This indicates that the H2 formed through the DHP is consumed by reacting with CO2, which shifts the reaction equilibrium of the ODHP to the product side with a higher C3H6 formation rate. This CO2-promoting effect is also valid on other catalysts, such as Cr/HZSM-5 (141,143) and Cr-SBA-1, (66) and Ga2O3 catalysts, (121,129) regardless of redox properties.
Figure 13

It is noteworthy that the CO2-promoting effect is not universal and is affected by the nature of the support, such as CrAlBeta in Figure 13B. Combined with the low Si/Al ratio in this catalyst, the stronger acidity might interfere in the CO2-promoting effect by shifting the reaction pathways. (22) Among Al2O3-, activated carbon (AC)-, and SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts for CO2–ODHP, Takahara et al. observe that the CO2-promoting effect is only evident on Cr2O3/SiO2. (74,75) The correlation between CO/H2 ratio and C3H6 yield demonstrates that DHP and RWGS occur in the case of Cr2O3/Al2O3, while the combination of DHP and DRP occurs on Cr2O3/SiO2.
3.5.3. Agent for Coke Removal
The reverse Boudouard reaction is an endothermic reaction, which likely happens in the temperature range that has been explored (i.e., 500–650 °C) for CO2–ODHP. Pulse experiments have confirmed that little coke forms in the presence of CO2 on bulk Ga2O3 catalysts, and CO2 can serve as an agent to remove deposited carbon through the reverse Boudouard reaction. (23) A similar effect on coke removal has also been observed on other catalyst systems, including Cr2O3/SiO2, (74,75) Cr/HZSM-5, (141,143) and Cr-MCM-41. (173,174) Of note, CO2 cannot completely prevent deactivation or completely eliminate coke, but it can help to alleviate coke formation.
COx-derived coke may form through two conditions on Cr sites: (i) CO2 fixation caused by reduced Cr species with abundant H species at the surface and (ii) carbon chain growth and aromatization reaction triggered at high temperatures (i.e., >300 °C). (73) The presence of CO2 consumes the surface atomic H species, the concentration of which becomes too low to deoxygenate C–O species to form hydrocarbon species through C–C coupling chain growth or aromatization. Clearly, not only can CO2 contribute to the coke removal, but it can also inhibit coking, benefiting the overall stability of Cr catalysts for CO2–ODHP.
3.5.4. Competitive Adsorption between CO2, C3H8, and C3H6
A negative role of CO2 has also been reported on redox CrOx catalysts, in which the presence of CO2 in the feed gas hampers the adsorption of C3H8. (24) On the other hand, it prevents the adsorption of C3H6 and its subsequent conversion into coke. (24) Therefore, an overall CO2-promoting effect still predominates in the case of CrOx. On HZSM-5-supported Ga2O3 catalysts with a non-redox property, the reaction proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation mechanism, in which C3H8 dissociates on acid–base pairs in the forms of H– and C3H7+, respectively (Figure 10A). (127) As a more acidic molecule than C3H8, CO2 adsorption on basic sites will negatively impact C3H8 adsorption on Ga2O3, causing drop in activity. In particular, the negative impact prevails at higher CO2 partial pressures. Hence, a proper C3H8/CO2 ratio is of importance for high dehydrogenation activity in CO2–ODHP. This is the area where more efforts are needed in future studies.
4. Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane with Nitrous Oxide
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Another milder oxidant that is favored to reduce formation of unwanted overoxidation is nitrous oxide (N2O). Using N2O as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize N2O, which is an acidic, strong greenhouse gas. Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. (20,177−181) While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well. (179,182−185) However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2O–ODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2. (180−184,186,187) While an in depth study regarding the rate of deactivation or deactivation mechanism has not been reported for molybdenum oxide catalysts, both vanadium- and iron-based catalysts are reported to deactivate within several hours on stream. Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O.
4.1. Metal Oxide Catalysts
4.1.1. Vanadium Oxides
In general, for vanadium catalysts, using N2O instead of O2 in ODHP results in increased selectivity of C3H6. (20,177,186−189) For example, Baerns et al. show that a significant increase in C3H6 selectivity from ∼55% to 75% can be obtained by using N2O instead of O2 as an oxidant for 0.5% VOx/γ-Al2O3. (188) Also, Dingerdissen et al. show that C3H6 selectivity of up to ∼90% can be obtained with a V2O5 catalyst when using N2O as an oxidant, while the highest selectivity obtained using O2 as the oxidant is ∼78%. (186) Furthermore, while selectivity tends to decrease as C3H8 conversion increases, this effect is much less pronounced when N2O is used as the oxidant. (179,186,189) As reported by Kondratenko et al., when O2 is used for ODHP, a decrease in C3H6 selectivity from ∼75% to ∼50% is observed as C3H8 conversion increases from ∼2% to ∼10% using a 2.8% VOx/SiO2 catalyst. (186) In contrast, when N2O is used, a less significant decrease in selectivity is observed, falling from ∼93% to 81%, for a similar change in C3H8 conversion.
Such improved C3H6 selectivity using N2O is attributed to the lesser ability of N2O to oxidize reduced VOx species. It is observed in numerous reports that VOx species tend to be in a more oxidized state when exposed to O2 than N2O. (20,186,188,189) UV–vis measurements of a 9.5% VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in different gas mixtures, as shown in Figure 14, are one example that supports such a notion. (188) The intensity of the two bands at 230 and 300 nm, indicating the presence of V5+ species, decreases substantially when C3H8 oxidation is performed with N2O rather than O2. This indicates that more V5+ cations are reduced when C3H8 oxidation is performed with N2O than O2. Similarly, as shown in Table 8, XPS analysis of V2O5, VO2, and V2O3 catalysts after O2–ODHP also indicates that VOx species are much more reduced in N2O than in O2. (186) Interestingly, as shown in Table 9, C3H6 selectivity tends to be higher as the VOx species are more reduced. From such observations, it is proposed that C3H6 selectivity is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity.

Regarding the vanadium oxide species that are formed in ODHP using O2 and N2O, Sauer et al. propose that the formation of peroxovanadate species can be responsible for the decreased selectivity to C3H6 when using O2. (177) In their DFT analysis, it was reported that formation of peroxovanadate species is much more favored in O2, while the formation of vanadyl oxygen species is more favored under N2O. On the basis of this observation, Sauer et al. assert that the peroxovanadate site leads to consecutive C3H6 oxidation, while such a phenomena is more limited on the vanadyl oxygen site, leading to higher selectivity of C3H6 during ODHP. (177) More detailed discussion regarding progress in theoretical studies is covered in section 6.2. In the analysis of ODHP on a VOx/MCM-41 catalyst using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Bruckner et al. state that higher activity and lower selectivity toward C3H8 with O2 than N2O are attributed to the formation of highly reactive electrophilic O– species under O2, while nucleophilic, less active O2– ions serve as reactants under N2O. (20) Their results indicate that electrophilic Vn+···O·– (n = 4 or 5) species form when the catalyst is pretreated with O2, likely through the dissociation of adsorbed oxygen species. However, such species are not observed after treatment with N2O, likely due to rapid formation of O2– oxide ions, which are not EPR-active. Combining previous DFT results with their observation from EPR, Kondratenko et al. propose that high activity and low selectivity of C3H6 in ODHP using O2 is likely due to electrophilic Vn+···O– site formation, which is formed as a result of decomposition of peroxovanadate sites, OxV5+···O22–, as summarized in Figure 15. For OxV4+ species, it is suggested that OxV5+···O2·– forms upon the reoxidation to further react with another OxV4+ or OxV3+ to yield a Vn+···O·– site. Meanwhile for ODHP using N2O, only less active O2– ions are formed through decomposition of N2O on OxV3+ sites. DFT results have showed that the reoxidation of OxV4+ species is not favored under N2O, so it is assumed only OxV3+ species can be reoxidized.

Lastly, type of support and loading of vanadium oxide have been reported as additional factors to affect catalytic activity and C3H6 selectivity. (179,189,190) Baerns et al. report that silica-supported VOx catalysts show higher C3H6 selectivity than alumina-supported catalysts, whether O2 or N2O is used as oxidant (Figure 16). It is also noted that the C3H6 selectivity increases as the loading of VOx increases, up to a certain loading on the alumina, while it barely shows any change in selectivity for the silica-supported counterpart. On the basis of such observations, it was hypothesized that C3H6 adsorption is more likely to occur on the exposed surface of the acidic γ-Al2O3 support. The adsorbed C3H6 might further transform to COx, thereby decreasing C3H6 selectivity. (190) For weakly acidic supports, like silica, adsorption of C3H6 does not occur well, so very small change in selectivity despite change in the exposed support surface area. Apart from the exposed surface area of the support, the dispersion of VOx species is another factor that has a crucial impact on the C3H6 selectivity. (179,188,189) It has been observed in multiple reports that regardless of the oxidant and support type used, above a certain VOx loading, the selectivity toward C3H6 tends to decrease. On the basis of these observations, it is reported that isolated VOx sites tend to be more selective toward C3H6, while more polymerized VOx species lead to drop in selectivity.

4.1.2. Molybdenum Oxides
Molybdenum catalysts also show decreased C3H8 conversion and increased C3H6 selectivity upon addition of N2O during C3H8 dehydrogenation. (184,185,191−193) For example, in their work on ODHP using a NiMoO4 catalyst, Ruiz et al. report an increase in C3H6 selectivity from 18.3% to 24.2%, along with a decrease in CO2 selectivity from 23.2% to 21.4%, occurs with a decrease in C3H8 conversion from 14.6% to 12.4% with 300 ppm of N2O in the feed gas. (184) Similar results are also evident using a mixture of NiMoO4 and α-Sb2O4 catalyst. (191) In the presence of 300 ppm of N2O, an increase in C3H6 selectivity from 34.6% to 37.5% and decrease in C3H8 conversion from 9.3% to 8.1% is observed. A decrease in CO2 selectivity from 24.2% to 22.0% is evident as well. It should be noted that 300 ppm of N2O has been co-fed with 10% O2 in all these reports.
In an effort to observe the surface species present after performing ODHP with different concentrations of N2O as a co-feed, XPS analysis has been performed on the catalysts, with the results shown in Table 10. (184) From these studies, while no Mo5+ species are present in the absence of N2O, Mo5+ species emerge after the N2O dopant is used in the ODHP reaction. On the basis of this result, it was hypothesized that the reduction of molybdenum is induced by propane due to the weaker oxidation capability of N2O. Surface sites of the NiMoO4 material are further studied by in situ DRIFT spectroscopy. DRIFTS is conducted under 1% N2O, 10% N2O, and synthetic air over the NiMoO4 catalyst. As shown in Figure 17, the intensity of the band at 1000 cm–1, assigned as a MoO3 vibration band ν(Mo═O), decreases in the order of synthetic air >10% N2O > 1% N2O. These results corroborate the prior observations from XPS.

Combining the observations made from XPS and DRIFTS, Ruiz et al. assert that while both oxygen and N2O are able to interact with the surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, N2O stabilizes molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate compared to molecular oxygen. (184,185) Furthermore, it was hypothesized that N2O limits the oxidation rate of the catalyst by adsorbing on the same vacancy that O2 would adsorb, thereby inhibiting adsorption of O2 on the surface of the catalyst. Consequently, the formation of electrophilic O– or O2– species would be limited, resulting in the decrease in the secondary oxidation of C3H6 and higher C3H6 selectivity in return. The adsorbed N2O would further dissociate to O2– species (eq 4-1 and eq 4-2), which can be responsible for the improved C3H6 selectivity observed upon addition of N2O during the ODHP reaction, as O– is known to lead to overoxidation products, while O2– leads to selective oxidation products. (194)

Of note, there is an optimum amount of N2O that is beneficial for elevating the C3H6 selectivity. It has been observed that, when the concentration of N2O is too high, a decrease in C3H6 selectivity is observed. On the basis of these observations, it was hypothesized that there is an optimum oxidation state for Mon+ species that allows for maximum selectivity; if the extent of reduction is too high, COx products are favored, leading to decreased C3H6 selectivity. Catalytic performances of reported metal oxide catalysts are summarized in Table 11.

4.2. Zeolite-Based Catalysts
4.2.1. Metal-Modified Zeolites
Different metal-containing zeolites, such as MFI (19,35,36,178,180−183,195−199) or BEA, (18,182,200,201) have been widely studied for the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction. In particular, iron-containing ZSM-5 has been reported as one of the most effective catalysts. (36,182,183,199,202,203) An early work reported that iron-containing ZSM-5, synthesized by steam treatment of an isomorphously substituted zeolite framework, shows C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450 °C. (180−183) Further studies show that Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, showing C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 °C. (19,35,36,198,199,204)
The high-temperature steam pretreatment of iron-containing zeolites has a positive effect on the C3H6 yield and selectivity, as this synthetic method produces extra-framework iron species that are more active than framework iron species for N2O–ODHP. (178,181,182) This pretreatment also enables reduction in surface acidity, resulting in higher C3H6 selectivity. Combined with characterization techniques, such as NH3–TPD and XRD, studies report a significant decrease in the acid site concentration after high-temperature steam pretreatment of Fe-ZSM-5, likely because of extensive dealumination of the zeolite and concomitant decrease in the density of Brønsted acid sites. (205−207) Such pretreated samples present a clear decrease in selectivity toward CO2, along with increased C3H6 selectivity.
On iron containing ZSM-5, studies report that Fe–O–Al species are likely active sites for N2O-mediated ODHP. (19,35,36) Grunert et al. have used FT-IR analysis paired with NO adsorption to characterize the abundant Fe species (Figure 18A) and catalytic evaluation of Fe-ZSM-5 (Figure 18) to support such hypothesis. (36) Of note, FT-IR spectroscopy, along with NO adsorption, is commonly used to characterize active sites for Fe-containing catalysts. For samples without calcination (Fe-MFI-24G), NO adsorption results in a broad band at 1850 cm–1, indicating mononitrosyl on ferrous ions in the straight channels of ZSM-5. When samples are calcined at high temperatures, two strong bands at 1875 and 1890 cm–1 are observed in the IR spectra. The band at 1875 cm–1 corresponds to the mononitrosyl species on extra-framework Fe2+–O–Al sites; the other band at 1890 cm–1 is assigned to the mononitrosyl species on isolated ferrous ions located on γ sites of the ZSM-5 structure. The band observed at 1810 cm–1 is assigned to poly nitrosyl species on ferrous ion sites. As initial adsorption of NO on Fe-MFI-1173 results in the emergence of a band at 1875 cm–1, it is hypothesized that both bands at 1810 and 1875 cm–1 come from the same ferrous species, namely isolated extra-framework Fe2+–O–Al species. Clearly, calcining Fe-MFI-24G samples leads to the transformation of iron sites from isolated ions to isolated extra-framework Fe–O–Al species. Figure 18B shows the C3H6 yield during N2O-mediated ODHP for samples calcined at different temperatures. An increase in C3H6 yield is observed as the calcination temperature rises from 600 °C (Fe-MFI-24G-873) to 800 °C (Fe-MFI-24G-1073), while the samples calcined at 800 (Fe-MFI-24G-1073) and 900 °C (Fe-MFI-24G-1173) show similar highest C3H6 yields between 27% and 30%. On the basis of this correlation between exposed active iron sites and the observed catalytic performance, it is proposed that the isolated Fe–O–Al site is the active center responsible for N2O-mediated ODHP reaction. (19,35,36)

Further analyses with in situ DRIFTS and TPD reveal that reoxidation of the Fe2+–O–Al site with N2O forms an O– species, which is thermally stable and highly selective in the target reaction. (19,35,36) On the basis of such observations, the following mechanism is proposed:
(4-3)
(4-4)
(4-5)
(4-6)
(4-7)
(4-8)
In the proposed mechanism, the Fe3+–Fe2+ cycle operates on the highly isolated extra-framework Fe–O–Al site to decompose N2O to N2 and O2 (eq 4-3-eq 4-6) and forms Fe3+–O– species. (208−210) Since the direct reaction of C3H8 and gaseous O2 produces COx as the main products, it is hypothesized that C3H8 reacts with the deposited O– species to produce C3H6 with a high selectivity (eq 4-7). The C3H6 may further react with adsorbed O– to form undesired COx species, as depicted in eq 4-8.
Despite its high initial catalytic performance, a major drawback of iron-containing zeolites is deactivation by coke, which causes a rapid decrease in C3H6 yield. (180−183) A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled with GC analysis (Figure 19) performed on MFI, BEA, and silicate catalysts is used to illustrate how zeolite catalysts deactivates over time during ODHP reaction. (182) Of note, c- indicates calcined only, and ex- indicates steam-activated samples after calcination; As presented in Figure 19, most catalysts show their highest C3H6 yields within the first few minutes on stream, and then deactivate rapidly within the first 20 min on stream. An excellent correlation between the increase in coke formation and decrease in C3H6 yield is observed, and based on such correlation it is hypothesized that coke formation is responsible for deactivation of the catalysts during the reaction. (182,183) Among the different zeolites tested, steam activated Fe-ZSM-5, with abundant extra-framework iron sites, presents the highest resistance to deactivation, and shows a C3H6 yield above 20% up to 75 min on stream. Even after 400 min on stream, it is able to maintain a C3H6 yield of 8%, unlike other catalysts that deactivate almost completely. It is hypothesized that this elevated performance likely originates from the absence of large cages in ZSM-5. Since the size of the channel and intersections are similar, coke precursors are not trapped in intersections and are hypothesized to more effectively diffuse out. On the other hand, BEA zeolites have large cavities with relatively small apertures in the framework. Such cavities may trap bulky organics, completely blocking the access to active sites and causing rapid deactivation. While the amount of coke formation and the C3H6 yield usually display a nice correlation, for ex-Fe-ZSM-5 and ex-H-ZSM-5, this is not the case. While the coke content is 4 to 5 times higher for ex-Fe-ZSM-5 than ex-H-ZSM-5, similar C3H6 yields are obtained after 400 min on stream. On the basis of this observation, Gallardo-Llamas and co-workers hypothesize that the location of the coke is another important factor that affects the deactivation process. (182,183) Such a hypothesis is also supported by the work of Pérez-Ramírez et al., in which gallium-containing MFI zeolites exhibit higher coke formation than the corresponding aluminum-containing zeolite, yet still show a higher C3H6 yield after 120 min on stream for the ODHP reaction. (196) While such deactivated zeolite catalysts can be regenerated by treatment with air at elevated temperatures, it is reported that regenerated catalysts tend to deactivate much faster than the fresh ones, showing a sharp decrease in catalytic activity within a few minutes on stream. (180,183,196) Better understanding of catalyst deactivation and improvement of catalyst stability still remain as challenge for efficient utilization of N2O for ODHP reactions.

There have only been a few reports where other metal-containing MFI catalysts such as cobalt or manganese have been tested for N2O–ODHP. (198,211) While it is reported that both cobalt- and manganese-containing ZSM-5 catalysts are less active in N2O–ODHP than iron-containing ZSM-5, there are insufficient data to definitively draw assertion. Furthermore, stability or deactivation studies using N2O–ODHP on such catalysts are still very scarce, thereby making it difficult to evaluate their potential for this reaction at this stage.
4.2.2. Effect of Zeolite Topology
There have been reports deploying other zeolite frameworks for the N2O–ODHP reaction as well, including MOR, FAU, and BEA. (18,36,182,200,201,204,212) However, the catalytic performance of most of these frameworks is inferior to the MFI zeolites, not only possessing lower C3H6 yield but also fast deactivation. FAU and BEA zeolites are the frameworks that show relatively better performance and are close to the MFI-based catalysts, with their highest C3H6 yields between 7% and 17%. (36,204) However, the BEA zeolites suffer from rapid deactivation. (182,200) Sobalik and co-workers find that C3H6 yield decreases to 25% of its initial yield for iron-containing BEA within 2 h on stream. (201) Pérez-Ramírez et al. also report that a lab-synthesized Fe-BEA deactivates rapidly, showing a decrease by 90% of its initial yield within the first hour of reaction. (182) MOR or FER frameworks are much less active in the N2O–ODHP reaction, exhibiting very low C3H6 yields (i.e., <2%). (36,204) A summary of the catalytic performance of different zeolite catalysts is shown in Table 12. While Fe-ZSM-5 has been extensively studied for this reaction because of its superior performance, studies of other frameworks are still limited. More efforts are needed to explore the effect of other framework topologies on catalytic performance.

5. Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane with Sulfur-/Halogen-Containing Compounds
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Alternate oxidants, such as sulfur or halogen-based oxidants, have shown promising results to selectively dehydrogenate propane to propylene. For example, co-feeding sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can improve propylene yield. Using SO2 as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize SO2, which is an acidic gas. However, the SO2–ODHP pathway results in low propylene because of the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts. Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2. (213) Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2–ODHP. (213) In the future, developing a structure–activity relationship will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field.
Selective activation of C3H8 can also be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways, such as (i) dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), (ii) oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), (iii) propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and (iv) molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2). Specifically, oxychlorination chemistry over CeO2, EuOX, and metal phosphate-based, such as CrPO4, catalysts have shown good selectivity (up to 95%) and conversion (up to 70% at 500 °C) in comparison to conventional ODHP. (48−50) Still, the olefin selectivity is limited because of the formation of COx and polyhalogenation products. Continuous efforts have been put forth to obtain an optimal propane oxyhalogenation catalyst, which should exhibit moderate redox properties so that it enables alkane activation but does not favor alkane overoxidation, combustion, and evolution of Cl2, while possessing fast dehydrochlorination kinetics.
5.1. Propane Dehydrogenation in the Presence of Sulfur-Based Feed
Thermal (or steam) cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of hydrocarbons are the most important processes in the production of olefins, the building blocks of the chemical industry. To improve selectivity (i.e., reduce hydrogenolysis or coke formation), sulfur-based additives, such as dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and H2S, are often added as a dilute co-feed during the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons. (214−216) The role of sulfur as a promoter or inhibitor is well studied in the literature for hydrogenation reactions. (217−219) In particular, sulfur has been found to suppress the cracking of organic molecules on metal catalysts. Assuming the ability of sulfur to suppress the cracking reactivity is stronger than its ability to poison the dehydrogenation reactivity of metallic (or metal oxide) catalysts (Fe, Ni, Cu, Co, Zn Mn, Mo), sulfur compounds can be good promoters for enhancing the dehydrogenation performance. (220−222) Typically, the effect of sulfur on the catalytic propane dehydrogenation has been studied in one of the following categories (Figure 20), namely, (i) in situ catalyst sulfidation (in the presence of H2S) but in the absence of O2, (ii) mixture of H2S + O2 or (iii) SO2, and (iv) S2. (39,40,44,220−234)

5.1.1. H2S-Catalyzed DHP/ODHP
Several patents highlight the merits of adding H2S during the uncatalyzed propane dehydrogenation. (235,236) For example, the addition of H2S in the reactant stream doubles the C3H6 yield to 31% at 815 °C. (235) Further, Resasco et al. demonstrate that the Ni/Al2O3, treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), exhibits improved selectivity and decreased coke formation during isobutane dehydrogenation. (237) Similarly, the selectivity of C3H6 on Pt/MgAl2O4 is significantly improved from 47% to 95% without changing its activity when H2S (425 ppm) is co-fed, thus establishing a promoting effect. (238) On the basis of CO-chemisorption and Bader charge analysis, Wang et al. explain that the improved selectivity in the presence of H2S is due to the electron transfer from adsorbed sulfur species to Pt atoms, thereby resulting in weaker Pt–C3H6 interactions. (239) Of note, H2S can inhibit the conversion and adversely affect the selectivity of propylene at higher concentrations (about 850 ppm) over Pt/Al2O3 underlining the dual role of H2S as an inhibitor and promoter depending on H2S concentration in the feed. (238) Subsequently, Shan et al. show that the exposure of metal oxides to sulfur feed can lead to the formation of corresponding metal sulfides (or surface sulfur species) and reported improved isobutane dehydrogenation yield, suggesting that the sulfur can play a key role in modifying the active phase of the catalyst. (220−222) The authors argued that higher selectivity is due to the preferential activation of C–H bonds over C–C bonds on metal–sulfur ensembles, coupled with facile olefin desorption, thus, effectively reducing the possibility of side reactions and coke generation. (220−222) In summary, the resulting metal sulfides formed due to exposure to H2S, show improved dehydrogenation performance over their parent metals or metal oxides, presenting a unique opportunity to design new catalysts with enhanced oxidative or nonoxidative dehydrogenation capability with improved selectivity and stability. (220−223)
Sulfur compounds, such as S2 and H2S, have been used as cocatalysts to reduce overoxidation of alkanes and olefins during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions (ODH). (40,42,44,240) Clark et al. have investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using γ-Al2O3 and 13% V/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of H2S + O2 at short residence times (t = 5 ms) and achieved a C3H6 yield of ∼30.4% at 700 °C. (40) The C3H6 selectivity increases at residence times below 0.5 s, indicating that shorter residence times are required to suppress the cracking reaction. (40) Gasper et al. demonstrate that C3H6 yields of up to 60% can be obtained for H2S-promoted ODH over LiCl/KCl/MnCl2 molten salt at 705 °C. (39) As postulated, sulfur in the diatomic state (active species) may abstract H species from an alkane. Of particular note is that significantly higher C3H6 yield (i.e., 60%) is evident in the presence of molten salt for H2S-assisted ODH than is obtained with the catalyst (i.e., 30%) or in gas-phase reactions (i.e., 20%) at 700 °C. (39,40,44)
The addition of gaseous sulfur, either S2/COS/SO2/H2S or combinations of sulfur compounds over Al2O3, (Co, Mo, Fe, W, Ni-mono or bimetallic) metals supported either on Al2O3 or SiO2 demonstrates excellent performance (up to 98% C3H8 conversion, C3H6 selectivity = 95%, and CS2 selectivity = 1%) in the temperature range of 400–750 °C, which is summarized in Table 13. (42,229−233) In these studies, the catalyst precursor, which may be metal oxides/metal sulfides/metal oxysulfides, is typically activated in the presence of one or more sulfur-containing compounds, such as S2, H2S, SO2, COS. Recently, oxidative propane dehydrogenation utilizing sulfur vapor (S2: C3H8 = 1: 0.3) as an oxidant has been investigated at 600–950 °C over bulk Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3 catalysts that are activated in a mixture of S2/H2S. (234) The study reveals that the C3H6 yield and selectivity improve in the presence of S2; however, the conversion (C3H8 conversion = 10% and C3H6 selectivity = 73%, at 650 °C) is barely affected by the catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions. DFT calculations on the H2S-assisted gas-phase ODH reaction reveal that the in situ generated sulfur intermediate (S2) can abstract the hydrogen from the alkane, leading to the formation of olefin products (see section 6.3 for details). (44) It highlights that the sulfur is participating in the reaction as a catalyst. The formation of sulfur-based byproducts, such as CS2, 1- and 2-propyl thiol mercaptan, and sulfur (S8), is also observed in the reactor effluent. (229−234) Recently, Marks and co-workers have evaluated the role of sulfur as a soft oxidant for propane dehydrogenation (S2–ODHP) over transition metal oxide (ZrO2, TiO2, Cr2O3) and sulfide (PdS, MoS2) at milder reaction temperature (T = 470–550 °C). (213) They found that the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with lower metal–sulfur bond strength, indicating a more active sulfur species. The authors proposed that C–H activation (RDS) proceeds by a surface sulfur species based on first order dependence on propane. Consequently, propylene and H2S formation leads to sulfur vacancy, and gas phase S2 replenishes these sulfur vacant sites.

5.1.2. Metal Sulfate- and SO2-Assisted DHP/ODHP
The effect of sulfation has been studied via either synthesizing Me–SO4 (Me = Co, Fe, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Mn) or the introduction of SO2 as an oxidant in the co-feed. In the former case, sulfate-promoted FeOx and Co/Al2O3 catalytic systems show excellent activity in C3H8 dehydrogenation accompanied by relatively better stability than the nonsulfated catalyst. (225−228) The improved performance of the catalyst is attributed to the electron-withdrawing effect of sulfate species from the metal ion, as illustrated in Figure 21. The strong interaction of SO42– species with the support and Fe results in C3H8 polarization, followed by cleaving of the C–H bond over the Feδ+ and Oδ− pair. The loss of sulfate groups via in situ generation of SO2 or FeSx over prolonged reaction times induces coke formation and results in a loss of activity. The loss in activity with TOS has motivated Sun et al. to introduce SO2 into the reactant stream over sulfated 20% Fe/Al2O3, which results in stable performance for up to 15 h with 20% C3H6 yield at 560 °C. (227) Further tests are carried out over 20% Fe anchored on different supports including ZrO2, SiO2, and γ-Al2O3. Among them, γ-Al2O3 has the best performance, which is probably due to the formation of stable sulfate species.

Additionally, propane dehydrogenation has been performed with the introduction of SO2 as an oxidant. (37,38,241−245) Ashmawy has investigated the reaction of propane with SO2 over a 0.5% Pd–Al2O3 catalyst. (37,38) The addition of SO2 (i.e., C3H8: SO2 of 6: 1) to the co-feed increases the C3H8 conversion; however, the selectivity decreases markedly (i.e., 93.1% to ∼20%) with increasing SO2 partial pressure in the co-feed. As suggested, SO2 can abstract a H atom from C3H8, and the low selectivity may be caused by oxidation of C3H8 or C3H6 to form water and COx species. Adams et al. further investigate C3H8 oxidation with SO2 using a calcium–nickel phosphate catalyst and reported 14% selectivity toward C3H6, along with 31% C3H8 conversion at 550 °C and GHSV = 90 h–1. (241) To investigate the factors behind the low C3H6 selectivity, the same group has conducted additional experiments in which ammonia is added to the C3H8 and SO2 mixture. It was hypothesized that, in the presence of ammonia, the calcium–nickel phosphate catalyst would scavenge the C3H6 molecule formed under reaction conditions via the formation of isothiazole and prevents its oxidation to COx compounds. However, the selectivity barely changes with ammonia addition, indicating that the initial reaction of SO2 with C3H8 can be related to the formation of undesired combustion products (COx) rather than C3H6.
Sokolovskii et al. have investigated the role of activated carbon in selective catalytic oxidation of propane in the presence of SO2. (242) Improved C3H6 formation can be obtained over γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and Ga2O3 because of the in situ generation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) or activated coke. (243) In contrast, Fe2O3, Bi2O3, and PbO-based bulk catalysts undergo sulfidation, which leads to decreases in the C3H6 yield under similar reaction conditions (Table 13). Danilova and Ivanova have investigated the effect of pore size (textural properties) on the catalytic performance of SO2-assisted ODHP over SiO2–Al2O3 catalysts at 640 °C with an SO2 co-feed of 10 mol %. (244) Pores that are smaller than 10 nm lead to oxidation or coke products, whereas pores between 10 and 100 nm are optimal for C3H6 formation. Similar to Sokolovskii’s observation, the accrual of OCP over silica is accompanied by the improved C3H6 yield from 3.4 to 46 mol % at 640 °C with a C3H8: SO2: He ratio of 10: 10: 80 mol %. It is important to note that, because of the formation of OCP, the carbon balance is reported to vary between 60% and 100%. Danilova et al. have studied the effect of OCP accumulation (0–40 wt %) on catalytic performance over SiO2 via various ex situ techniques. (245) DRIFTS spectra reveal that the OCP system is composed of a polycyclic aromatic structures consisting of C, O, H, and S atoms with the spectral signature of carbonyl, carboxylic acid, and lactone groups. However, the exact nature of the active sites remain elusive because of the lack of structure–activity relationship and characterization studies using state-of-the-art, in situ/operando techniques. (242−245)
5.2. Halogen-Assisted Dehydrogenation
A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 °C. To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2). It is important to note that the catalytic transformation of C3H8 in these routes is quite different from other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of the differences in reactivity of the respective alkanes. (45,46)
Figure 22
Figure 22. Various routes investigated in past decades for propane conversion to propylene, homogeneous reaction (red box), and catalyst-assisted reaction (brown). Reaction conditions are mentioned for each route.
5.2.1. Propane Oxyhalogenation
The propane oxyhalogenation reaction proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water (eqs 2-24–2-29). Theoretically, 100% halogen atom efficiency can be achieved in the presence of O2, whereas efficiency is limited to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation (eqs 2-18, 2-20, and 2-22) due to the formation of HX. (46) C3H6 selectivity during the C3H8 oxidative dehydrogenation is generally lower than that of C2H4 from C2H6 because of the presence of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms in the case of C3H6, which can lead to successive oxidation of C3H6. (246) It is important to note that during oxyhalogenation reactions, the alkane conversion can be enhanced due to the gas-phase reactions. The highly reactive radical species are liberated from the catalyst surface and allow the formation of desired and undesired products in the gas phase. To date, research has mainly focused on the propane oxychlorination (POC), including reports of a wide range of catalytic materials, such as metal oxides (i.e., CeO2), metal phosphates, and metal oxyhalides. On the other hand, propane oxybromination (POB) leads to much lower yields because of polyhalogenation and overoxidation.
5.2.1.1. CeO2-Based Catalyst
CeO2-based catalysts have been studied extensively because of their high activity toward hydrogen halide oxidation, alkane, and alkene oxyhalogenation. (247) Xie et al. have investigated bulk transition metal oxide catalysts (i.e., RuO2, Fe2O3, CuO, NiO) and rare earth metal oxides (i.e., CeO2, La2O3, Eu2O3) for POC. (49) Among transition metal oxides, Fe2O3, CuO, and NiO are unstable during the reaction, whereas RuO2 leads to the formation of COx as major products, indicating high reactivity of oxygen species on the RuO2 surface. Bulk CeO2 shows the highest C3H8 conversion (i.e., 29%) and a good C3H6 selectivity of 61% at 500 °C (Table 14). The POC is demonstrated to be structure-sensitive over various facets and morphology of CeO2. CeO2 nanorods (110 + 100 facet) are the most active for POC. (49) To improve activity and selectivity and suppress the overoxidation potential during POC, a solid solution of transition metal oxides with CeO2 has been investigated (Table 14). (49) In particular, 8% NiO–CeO2 demonstrates an excellent single pass yield up to 55% with 80% C3H6 selectivity, outperforming other catalysts with different compositions. Raman results demonstrate that the catalyst activity is correlated with surface oxygen vacancies. The band at 831 cm–1 due to O22– surface species is the strongest for 8% Ni–CeO2 followed by CeO2 nanorods and CeO2 nanocubes, while the bands for CeO2 nano-octahedra and CeO2 particles are too weak to be registered. Similarly, surface chloride coverage is determined to be crucial for controlling olefin selectivity, as evidenced by XPS results. (49)

The presence of HCl not only suppresses the reactivity toward oxidation products over CeO2 but also induces new active site pairs for selective C3H6 production. DFT calculations reveal that the reaction is initiated by the formation of peroxide species over oxygen vacancies, which can oxidize Cl– into Cl•, and the surface-bound Cl• radical is responsible for C–H activation. (49) DFT calculations combined with detailed kinetic analysis provide insights into the reaction mechanisms, in which the reaction proceeds via propyl chloride generation and subsequent dehydrochlorination into C3H6 over the catalyst surface, as illustrated in Figure 23. (49) The energy barrier of C–H activation on Ce4+–O2– (1.8 eV) is higher than that on Cl• adjacent to O2– (0.9 eV), indicating that the latter pair is responsible for C3H8 activation. (248) It is generally agreed that the formation of propyl chloride inhibits the overoxidation. (49,248) The formation of Cl2 is found to be negligible in the presence of C3H8, suggesting gas-phase conversion is unlikely.

5.2.1.2. Metal Oxyhalide
While CeO2 exhibits the highest activity (Table 14), europium oxychloride (EuOCl) leads to better C3H6 selectivity (i.e., >95% with C3H8 conversion of 20%) during POC. (48,249) The excellent performance in the case of EuOCl can be rationalized by the unique balance of its mild redox nature that enables alkane activation, minimizes gas-phase reaction by inhibiting the evolution of Cl2 (Figure 24), and suppresses alkane overoxidation. Europium is predominantly found in Eu3+ with minor contributions from Eu2+ via XPS analysis. As suggested, the presence of a redox couple (Eu3+/Eu2+) is responsible for propane activation. (45) LaOCl is less selective toward C3H6 (i.e., 40% with C3H8 conversion of 51%) at 400 °C, in contrast to EuOCl (Table 14).

In the case of EuOBr, the POB reaction favors the formation of alkyl bromides (C3H7Br), resulting in poor C3H6 selectivity (i.e., 22% with C3H8 conversion of 45%) at 500 °C. (45) It is postulated that the C3H8 activation during POB occurs in the gas phase by the in situ generated Br2, leading to polyhalogenation, cracking, and combustion (Figure 25). (45) Characterization of the spent EuOBr catalyst reveals the presence of the EuBr2 and EuBr phases after POB reaction, indicating bromination of the catalyst; whereas the EuOBr phase is stable during HBr oxidation and methane oxybromination in contrast to POC. (250) The bromination of the catalyst is formed due to the reduction of the catalyst surface by the C3H7Br generated in situ during the reaction.

5.1.1.3. Metal Phosphates
Transition metal phosphates such as V, Ti, Mn, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu have been investigated for the oxyhalogenation reaction of alkanes (Table 14). (50,249) The product distribution is strongly dependent on the nature of catalyst and the type of halogen. Among the metal phosphates, CrPO4 and FePO4 have shown excellent C3H6 selectivity (i.e., > 95%) during C3H8 oxychlorination. In contrast, Mn-, Ni-, Co-, and Ti-based phosphates result in cracking, V-phosphate only yields oxidation products, and Cu-phosphate favors the formation of chlorinated hydrocarbons. CrPO4 exhibits the maximum C3H6 yield ∼50% with selectivity of ∼95%. (50) Similar to EuOBr, vanadium-phosphate (VPO) shows 35% C3H8 conversion and 24% C3H6 selectivity during POB, but with a yield as low as 8% (Table 14). (251)
Pérez-Ramírez and co-workers describe several kinetic parameters to explain the differences in activity and selectivity toward different products over different catalysts. (50) In particular, the catalytic ability for the oxidation of HCl to molecular Cl2 is quantified based on the temperature at which 10% conversion of HCl oxidation (T10(HCL)) can be achieved (Figure 24). Similarly, the trends toward dehydrochlorination of C3H7Cl, cracking, and oxidation of propane are investigated for all catalysts. As shown in Figure 24, the rate of propane consumption via POC reaction correlates linearly with catalyst ability to evolve molecular Cl2 during oxidation of HCl. The high C3H6 selectivity over CrPO4 is attributed to the fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a low propensity to cracking and overoxidation, as well as hindered ability to evolve Cl2.
Operando photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy enables the detection of reactants, products, and short-lived intermediates such as radicals under reaction conditions. Recently, PEPICO has been applied in propane oxyhalogenation over the CrPO4 catalyst to shed light on mechanisms, especially in the gas phase. (246) Operando PEPICO reveals that neither Cl• nor Cl2 are present under POC reaction conditions. This indicates that propane activation occurs primarily on the catalyst surface, namely, a surface-confined mechanism, and proceeds via the formation of C3H7Cl, followed by fast dehydrochlorination to yield olefins. This is in line with the kinetic studies and corroborates that propane oxychlorination proceeds via surface-driven reaction pathways. (50,246)
The propane oxybromination chemistry leads to a lower propylene yield due to the formation of coke, cracking, and oxidation products (COx), as well as brominated hydrocarbons (such as C3H7Br and C3H5Br) over VOPO4/CrPO4/EuOBr. (45,246,251,252) Detailed kinetic analysis, complemented by operando PEPICO, demonstrates that C3H8 activation proceeds in the gas phase with in situ generated bromine species (Br•/Br2) via catalytic HBr oxidation over CrPO4. The evolution of reactive intermediates, such as Br•, is correlated with C3H6 formation via operando PEPICO with increasing temperatures indicates that reaction takes place in gas phase primarily. Similar to POC, POB also proceeds through the formation of propyl halide, which subsequently undergo dehydrohalogenation to yield C3H6. (246) Further, this technique sheds light on the coking and cracking reaction pathways observed under oxybromination reaction conditions during POB (Figure 25). The presence of C3 radicals due to the resonance stabilization prolongs their lifetime in the reactor, leading to coke formation. The coke formation proceeds via consecutive hydrogen abstraction of 2-propyl by Br• to yield allyl and propargyl species which results in the formation of coke precursors such as benzene. Additionally, the cracking of C–C bonds may also form ethyl and methyl radicals. The presence of methyl radicals likely facilitates the formation of C4–C6 species through chain growth, thus contributing to the formation of coke precursors from alternative pathways. (246)
In brief, the relationships between propane oxyhalogenation, gas-phase halogenation, C3H7X elimination, hydrogen halide oxidation, and propane oxidative dehydrogenation have been elucidated over a wide set of catalysts. Results suggest that the selectivity in the oxyhalogenation reaction depends on (i) the ability of the catalyst to selectively dehydrogenate the propyl halide into propylene, (ii) hindered ability to evolve molecular halogen, and (iii) suppressed overoxidation and combustion tendency. Of note, the high reactivity toward HCl oxidation can give rise to undesired products because of the gas-phase reactions, indicating the need for a balanced redox nature. (48,249,253)
5.2.2. Other Halogen-Assisted Systems
Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst that achieves ∼50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400 °C. (254) The HCl generated during the reaction requires an oxychlorination reactor to recycle Cl2 via the Deacon reaction (4 HCl + O2 → Cl2 + 2H2O). Alkali metal chloride catalysts also have been probed for oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8, though scarcely. (46,255,256) The C3H6 yield obtained over Li–K/Dy2O3 is below 20% at 600 °C, along with propylene selectivity lower than 60%. (255)
The effect of organochloride compounds, such as CCl4, has also been studied for oxidative propane dehydrogenation over CeO2, Fe2O3, and CuO, in which improved C3H6 selectivities of up to 80% are evident at P(CCl4) = 0.17 kPa under oxygen-limiting conditions. (257−259) These studies are conducted under relatively low conversions (i.e., 25% at 450 °C and FT/W ∼ 4000–6000 cm3 h–1 gcat–1), which limits the C3H8 yield below 20%. Of note, the presence of chlorinated species near the surface region and in the gas phase accounts for the improved performance with the addition of CCl4. (257,258) Oxychlorination on a Pt–Sn/θ-Al2O3 catalyst also shows the restoration of catalytic activity during conventional DHP because of the excellent dispersion of sintered Pt agglomerates. (260)
5.2.3. Molten Salt-Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenation
The oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons on metal iodide-based molten salt was first developed by Shell. (261,262) In those approaches, the ODHP reaction can occur between 450 and 600 °C in the presence of metal iodides (i.e., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2), and a C3H6 yield up to 70% can be achieved (Table 15). The molten salt catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation can be considered a special case of halogen-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation, in which a halogen, such as I2, is generated in situ via the reaction between metal iodide and oxygen. The reaction, however, primarily takes place in the gas phase.

It is generally accepted that the interplay between the metal iodide and metal oxide (LiI/LiOH) plays an important role in the generation of iodine to initiate a radical chain reaction. (263,264) A constant-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics study has been used to investigate the reactions between LiI and gaseous molecules (O2, H2O, and I2). (265) Results demonstrate that the most favorable process is the formation of gaseous I2, coproduced with LiOH or Li2O, depending on the availability of water; the reaction most likely occurs in the gas phase. These observations are supported by the fact that a similar product distribution is observed using either LiI/LiOH or I2 as an iodine source for the dehydrogenation reaction. (263) The high C3H6 yield can be achieved if the molten salt meets the following prerequisites: (i) the metal oxide can be converted into the corresponding iodide by exposure to iodide species under the reaction conditions and vice versa and (ii) I2 (g) can be obtained by oxidation under dehydrogenation conditions. (261) Similarly, an optimal concentration of O2 is vital for this reaction because (i) it is responsible for generating iodine radicals for chain reactions and (ii) excess oxygen can cause combustion reactions. (263,264) It is important to note that the corrosive nature of the mixture of molten salt, I2, HI, and alkyl halides, is a serious concern that might impair efforts for its commercial applications.

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Regardless of the oxidant or catalyst used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the C–H bond must first be activated. In metal oxides, this commonly occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acid–base pair. (266−268) In the redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a C–H bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group. (269) This forms water, which desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst. (270−272) In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies. (273−275) In this context, the role of the oxidant is to regenerate the catalyst by either reoxidizing the vacancy site through providing its oxygen, or reacting with adsorbed hydrogen species on the surface.
While ODHP has featured extensively in theoretical studies, examples where soft oxidants are explicitly considered are considerably fewer. In this section, we include examples of ODHP with soft oxidants but also supplement similar examples with other alkanes, such as ethane and methane partial oxidation, which share many similarities in their reaction mechanism. Oxidants discussed in this section include CO2, N2O, NOx, and other soft oxidants, such as sulfides and halides. We discuss both scenarios where the soft oxidant participates in the reaction by regenerating oxygen vacancy sites and where they react with surface hydrogen directly, as well as additional routes such as via forming gas-phase radicals.
6.1. Reactions with CO2
6.1.1. CO2 Dissociation in ODHP
When CO2 is used as an oxidant, there are generally two proposed mechanisms for its participation in ODHP. One involves direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, and the other involves the hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO. For the CO2 dissociation route, its high stability can be problematic because it prevents it from being easily activated to oxidize the surface. Therefore, finding a catalyst with a strong affinity for CO2 and its dissociation is an important criterion for ODHP with CO2. Fan et al. have explored the feasibility of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 on a V2O5 catalyst. (276) They found the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV, suggesting an extremely difficult process. The authors therefore have concluded that CO2 is unable to reoxidize the surfaces following dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, which leads to a deactivation of the catalyst. Meanwhile, on a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy. (28) It is concluded that vanadia in the WOx–VOx/SiO2 cannot be fully oxidized to V2O5 with CO2 but instead oxidized to V2O4. In contrast, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily on the CeO2 (110) surface with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies. (277) The ability of the reduced CeO2 surface to dissociate CO2 is utilized in a series of studies with bifunctional catalysts containing a CeO2 support. (12,155,278−280) Transition metals, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have also been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation. One study found a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV could be obtained on Ni4/MgO which provides active oxygen species for alkane C–H activation. (281)
6.1.2. Factors Controlling Selectivity between ODH and Dry Reforming
CO2 can often participate in parallel competing reactions from ODHP, such as dry reforming and the RWGS at high temperatures. Selective ODHP catalysts, therefore, need to prevent dry reforming from occurring. In one such study, Myint et al. have examined a number of bifunctional catalysts, containing CoPt, CoMo, and FeNi supported on CeO2 for ethane ODH with CO2 from experiments and theory. (280) The authors observe the highest selectivity to the ODH product with FeNi/CeO2. DFT is used to rationalize this behavior by comparing the energy profiles for successive C–H dissociation and C–C dissociation reactions. As shown in Figure 26, these two paths represent the formation of the ODH product ethylene and the dry reforming product, respectively. On the CoPt surface, the intermediates for C–C dissociation are found to be considerably more favorable in energy than the C–H products, whereas the trend is reversed on the FeNi surface. The clear differences in energetics between the two paths in this comparison supports the experimentally observed selectivity trends. Thermodynamic comparisons from DFT have also been used to explain selectivity of ODHP versus dry reforming on a variety of other catalytic systems, such as Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C, (282) FeNi3 and FeOx/Ni(111), (278) and Ni3Pt and FeO/Ni(111). (12)

Kattel et al. have followed up on this study with a thorough theoretical investigation of the reaction network and kinetics. (283) In the studied reaction network for ethane ODH, CO2 goes through either a dissociative mechanism or an associative one forming HOCO (Figure 27A). In the dissociative mechanism, CO is formed and desorbs into the gas phase, while the remaining oxygen can assist in the C–H activation or become hydrogenated after unassisted C–H activation. In the associative mechanism, C–H activation first occurs independently of CO2, which provides hydrogen to form the HOCO intermediate. Once formed, it can dissociate with a barrier of 0.83 eV, significantly lower than the direct dissociation of CO2 having a barrier of 2.13 eV. In the dry reforming path, ethylene is also formed via the same intermediates (Figure 27B). However, the paths diverge upon further oxidation of ethylene to CH2CH2O, CH2CH, CH3CH, or CH2CHO, which eventually leads to C–C scission. Kinetic Monte Carlo calculations find dry reforming to be favored over ODH. Interestingly, it is revealed that the CO2 dissociation is favored over HOCO formation, despite the higher energy barriers for the former. The calculations also find the dehydrogenation of CH3CH2 to CH2CH2 to be a key descriptor of ODH selectivity, which should be promoted to improve the selectivity on the catalyst.

6.1.3. CO2 Hydrogenation in ODHP
In a work by Gomez et al., ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and subsequent aromatization by CO2 is investigated for P- and Ga-modified ZSM-5 catalysts. (284) The associative pathway for CO2 is computed with DFT, where CO2 is hydrogenated by a nearby H2 that is formed as part of the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H5 (Figure 28). The reaction of CO2 follows roughly that of reverse water–gas shift, which forms CO and H2O. The concerted hydrogenation of CO2 occurs with the dissociation of H2 to form COOH with a barrier of 1.00 eV, followed by a second concerted dissociation of the C–OH bond to form CO and H2O in a single step with a barrier of 1.78 eV. The authors find the primary role of CO2 for this reaction on Ga/ZSM5 is to consume hydrogen, which promotes portions of the reaction where H2 formation is kinetically and thermodynamically less favorable. The mechanism is also found to be consistent with 13CO2 isotope studies in the same paper, which does not report any carbon from CO2 in the final hydrocarbon products.

6.1.4. CO2 Poisoning in ODHP
On catalysts with strong basic sites, such as MgO, CO2 can interact strongly with surface sites and poisons the catalyst, which is an issue when considering CO2 as an oxidant. In oxidative coupling and dehydrogenation, it has long been noted in experiments that CO2 strongly inhibits the reaction from proceeding. (128,285,286) This is consistent with theoretical calculations which find very negative CO2 adsorption energies of −2 to −3 eV on the MgO and CaO surfaces, particularly at the step sites. (287) On these surfaces CO2 interacts with the lattice oxygen to form surface bound carbonate species. The same sites which strongly bind CO2 are also responsible for C–H activation, which remain blocked because of the much weaker interaction between the alkane and the surface. Similarly, on the perovskite BaZrO3, CO2 is found to bind strongly to form a stable carbonate layer under ambient concentrations, which suggests such a catalyst would also be inactive for ODHP with CO2. (288) Consequently, poisoning by CO2 is an important potential factor preventing its use in ODHP and may also apply to the other oxidants as well.
6.2. Reactions with N2O and NOx
6.2.1. Reactions with N2O
In an early work, Rozanska et al. have investigated ODHP on vanadia using DFT for a cluster model, and compared the differences between O2 and N2O as oxidants. (177) On this catalyst, propane first undergoes homolytic C–H activation on the terminal oxygen of the V5+ sites, reducing the site to V4+ and forming a hydroxyl. The propyl then undergoes a second C–H activation on the hydroxyl site forming propylene and a water and leaving a further reduced V3+ site, which must be regenerated by an oxidant to close the catalytic cycle. From their calculations, they find N2O to be a weaker oxidant for the catalyst, which can only oxidize the V3+ sites, whereas O2 can oxidize both V3+ and V4+ sites, as evidenced by the lower energy barriers required for O2 (Figure 29A). The oxidization of the V4+ site by O2 also leads to the formation of HO2 radicals, which can either oxidize another V4+ site or activate the C–H bonds in a side reaction, with a barrier of 0.67 eV for propane. Finally, when oxidizing the sites, N2O restores the V3+ sites back to V5+ by providing its single oxygen, whereas O2 instead forms a peroxovanadate species. This is found to be possible on both the monomeric and dimeric vanadate. Subsequent investigation found the peroxovanadate to be more active for both propane activation and propylene oxidation than the V5+ site, having lower reaction barriers and a more exothermic reaction by comparison (Figure 29B). In particular, propylene activation on peroxovanadate has a low barrier of 0.84 eV and is exothermic by 2.59 eV, whereas activation on V5+ has a barrier of 1.43 eV and is endothermic by 1.17 eV. The authors estimate the oxidation rate of propylene is one to 2 orders of magnitude greater than propane under the reaction conditions, which could contribute to the overoxidation of propane to undesired COx, when O2 is used as the oxidant. Thus, the authors point toward peroxovanadate formation as a key factor in the lower selectivity to propylene with O2 as the oxidant over N2O.

A similar hypothesis regarding differences in active oxygen sites due to the choice of oxidant has been put forward by Dasireddy et al. for butane ODH on the NiMoO4 catalyst. (289) On the basis of the DFT reaction energies for surface oxidation by O2, N2O, and CO2, it is found that the full oxidation of Ni and Mo sites is thermodynamically favorable with O2, whereas N2O and CO2 can only partially oxidize the surface, recovering only the Mo sites. On the fully oxidized surface, C–H activation is facile with a barrier of 0.05 eV, irreversibly forming butan-1-ol in a single, highly exothermic step, which eventually leads to the formation of COx. By comparison, on the partially oxidized surface, C–H activation is rate-limiting with a barrier of 1.49 eV, in reasonable agreement with the experimental activation energies in the same paper. Therefore, the higher oxidizing ability of O2 provides more reactive oxygen species on the surface, leading to the overoxidation of butane.
Using N2O as an oxidant has also been explored in metal–organic framework (MOF) systems for alkane partial oxidation and ODH. In methane partial oxidation, the terminal oxygen of the metal nodes is commonly proposed to be the active site, which activates the methane C–H bond and forms methanol via a radical-rebound mechanism. (290,291) Upon desorption of the product, N2O reoxidizes the site. In a more recent combined experimental and theoretical study, Barona et al. propose a similar mechanism for alkane ODH on the Fe3M nodes of MOF PCN-250 (Figure 30A). (292) Here, the alkane undergoes homolytic C–H activation on the terminal oxygen of the metal node, resulting in a hydroxyl group which is further reduced to form water or an alcohol. The products, then, desorb and leave an open metal site, which is subsequently filled by the oxygen from N2O activation, regenerating the site and closing the catalytic loop. In this work, they find the ability of the site to regenerate the oxygen from N2O activation and the ability of the oxygen to activate the C–H bond are correlated to a single descriptor, the oxygen binding energy on the metal node. The more negative the oxygen binding energy, the lower the N2O activation energy and the higher the C–H activation energy, and vice versa. In the regime where N2O activation is rate-limiting, a direct correlation between the DFT N2O activation energies and the experimental rates is observed, supporting this mechanism (Figure 30B). The rational design of better MOF catalysts following this mechanism may be realized by tuning the oxygen binding energy of the metal node from changing its elemental composition.

6.2.2. Reactions with NOx
NOx is another potential oxidant for alkane oxidation, though few theoretical studies have been conducted in the context of ODHP. However, some hints toward its role and reactivity in ODHP can be found in existing studies of NOx dissociation and reduction. One DFT study finds that the dissociation of NO2 can be a moderately facile process on certain metal surfaces, such as Cu(111) with a barrier of 0.61 eV. (293) Another study has looked at NO2 reduction on V2O5, and found that the reduction of NO2 to HNO2 over a hydroxyl on the V4+ site can occur with little to no barrier. (294) These V4+ sites are identical with those formed from C–H activation in ODHP, suggesting that NO2 can similarly oxidize the V4+ site like O2 as previously described (Figure 29A). (177) For the case of NO, a DFT study on Pt(100) has investigated both dissociation and hydrogenation pathways, finding the dissociation to N and O to be more favorable with a barrier of 0.96 eV. (295) These results provide guidance for catalysts which could effectively use NOx as an oxidant in the ODHP reaction.
Another perspective for the participation of NOx in ODHP has been introduced in a recent experimental and theoretical study by Annamalai et al. (296) They find that gas phase NOx can promote selective ODHP via the formation of OH radicals, which can then activate C–H bonds in ODHP in the absence of a solid catalyst. A reaction mechanism is proposed where OH radicals are formed continuously from the reaction of NO and NO2 with O2 and sacrificial H donors, such as the alkyl radicals. The reason behind the high selectivity of OH radicals for ODHP is then explained by the differences in the activation energy of various C–H bonds as a function of the hydrogen abstraction strength of the catalytic site. It is found that sites with low hydrogen abstraction strength have a greater preference for activating weaker C–H bonds (such as propylene) over stronger ones (such as propane), leading to overoxidation and a reduced selectivity to propylene. Meanwhile, the OH radical, having a strong hydrogen abstraction strength (measured by a hydrogen adsorption energy of −5.39 eV from DFT), has no such preference to the weaker C–H bonds, which prevents overoxidation from occurring. Relating this back to heterogeneous catalysis, NO is also found to be generated from boron nitride catalysts under ODHP conditions, which could also participate in this process. (297) Further theoretical studies are needed to elucidate the impact of radical formation by NOx on the ODHP reaction in the presence of a solid catalyst.
6.3. Reactions with Other Soft Oxidants
6.3.1. Sulfides
Zhu et al. have explored the possibility of sulfur as another less active oxidant for alkane conversion, specifically for methane oxidative coupling. (298) The authors note that the thermodynamic well for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2 is −13.41 eV, whereas for sulfur oxidation to CS2, it is considerably higher in energy at −3.45 eV. Therefore, the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation is much lower for the sulfur oxidant. This approach is realized by carrying out the reaction under gaseous sulfur flow on a selection of transition metal sulfides. Presumably, the gaseous sulfur regenerates vacancies on the surface formed from H2S desorption during methane coupling. An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 °C. High temperatures are needed for this process due to both the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high C–H activation barriers on the sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides. These barriers range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2. While the performance of this catalyst is found to be relatively modest and far from practical consideration, it is conceivable that future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening. In particular, the authors have observed the M–S bond energy to be a good descriptor for both C–H activation and C–C coupling reaction barriers.
Premji et al. have explored the role of H2S in ODHP in the gas phase from experimental and theoretical perspectives. (44) From theoretical calculations, it was proposed the co-feed of H2S/O2 and partial oxidation of H2S can produce sulfur radical species SH and HS2 which participate in hydrogen abstraction along with OH and OOH. Subsequently, after C–H activation to form propyl radicals, both O2 and S2 can then form adducts with the propyl and undergo further reactions. With the propyl-O2 adduct, the propylene is the kinetic product, though a side distribution of other products can be formed, such as propanal, methyloxirane, and oxetane, all of which are more thermodynamically stable than propylene. On the other hand, with the propyl-S2 adduct, propylene is more favored both kinetically and thermodynamically, in part due to the relative instability of the S-containing hydrocarbon products. The more favorable energetics for propylene formation with sulfide species is consistent with experimental observation of higher propylene selectivity observed in the paper.
6.3.2. Halides
There has been recent interests in using halogens, such as Cl2 and Br2, as oxidants, particularly in oxyhalogenation reactions, which can be used for alkane to alkene conversion. (249,299) Zichittella et al. have explored the mechanism and factors governing alkene selectivity for oxyhalogenation in a combined theoretical and experimental study of an iron phosphate catalyst. (252) Interestingly, the authors have observed a divergence in the mechanism for ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination, with the former being dominated by surface reactions and the latter being mainly dominated by gas-phase reactions (Figure 31). In the proposed mechanism, ethane oxychlorination follows a surface-mediated C–H activation (with a barrier of 0.61 eV) to form an ethyl intermediate which then reacts with a surface chloride to form ethyl chloride in a barrierless process. Ethyl chloride is subsequently dehydrohalogenated (where a hydrogen and halogen are both removed from the alkyl in a concerted step) to ethylene, the desired product, in another surface reaction. By contrast, when Br2 is used, a gas-phase reaction is found to be more favorable where bromine desorbs as radicals which dehydrogenate and polybrominate ethane in a process unselective to ethylene. These results highlight the importance of the competition between surface and gas phase reactions that control the selectivity of the alkene and how the different oxidants shift their relative contributions.

7. Conclusions and Future Directions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants over a variety of catalysts are reviewed in this work. Figure 32 summarizes and compares the catalytic performance of key catalysts explored in each reaction route in the form of the correlation between selectivity and conversion. In general, transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides. For CO2- and N2O–ODHP, the explored catalyst systems are analogous. However, differences in inherent properties of reactions and difficulties in dealing with corrosiveness have led to complications in advancing the research, resulting in unique challenges and future research directions for each route. In general, future efforts should be devoted to designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the C–H bond in C3H8 with good regenerability, as well as to renovating the reaction systems that can reconcile the need for industrial processes with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases.
Figure 32
Figure 32. Summarized catalytic performance of developed catalysts for CO2–ODHP at 550 °C (A), N2O–ODHP at 400 °C (B), oxyhalogenation at 500 °C (C), and SO2-mediated dehydrogenation at 640 °C (D).
In CO2–ODHP, the major efforts have been devoted toward exploring redox-type and nonredox-type catalysts and developing composition–structure–catalysis relationship. As a representative of redox-type catalysts, CrOx exhibits higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion among all catalysts at 550 °C, as presented in Figure 32A. The activity is found to depend on the redox cycles, dispersion of Cr species, surface Cr density, and nature of the support. The catalytic performance of other redox-type catalysts, VOx, has not yet reached high C3H8 conversion at 550 °C (i.e., >20%), though high C3H6 selectivity (i.e., ∼95%–98%) is achieved at low conversion (Figure 32A). The non-redox-type catalyst, Ga2O3, shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion. Although Ga2O3 can be reduced upon contact with C3H8 molecules, its oxidation state remains stable during reaction. Instead, the reaction appears to proceed through the proposed heterolytic dissociation mechanism. (127) Combined with these developed redox- and nonredox-type catalysts, the zeolite-supported counterparts are also promising candidates (Figure 32A). Other catalysts that have been explored include Fe, precious metal, Mo2C, and Ni catalysts. Screening tests and mechanistic studies on these materials shed light on their roles in the selective activation of the C−H bond. For example, the Mo oxycarbide, formed through CO2-induced oxidation of Mo2C, favors the activation of methylene C–H bond in C3H8 molecules; (160) the presence of Pd can promote the oxidation activity of redox sites such as Ce4+ ↔ Ce3+, through which it promotes not only C3H8 conversion, but also inhibits Pd-catalyzed DRP reactions to undesired CO and H2, leading to well-preserved C3H6 selectivity. (171)
The presence of CO2 shows an overall promoting effect on C3H6 formation. Major positive roles of CO2 include: (i) completing redox cycles, though the oxidation potential is weak, (ii) shifting the reaction equilibrium of ODHP to the product side by consuming the produced H2 via RWGS, and (iii) serving as an agent for coke removal by the reverse Boudouard reaction. Competitive adsorption between C3H8 and CO2 is known for CrOx (24) and HZSM-5-supported Ga2O3. (127) However, the presence of CO2 also enhances C3H6 production on CrOx as a result of promoted C3H6 desorption. (24)
Despite these achievements, there are still elusive points that need to be addressed in future studies:
(i) Identification of redox cycles on redox-type catalysts. In the case of redox-type catalysts, there exist two different redox scenarios, including Cr6+ ↔ Cr3+/Cr2+ and Cr3+ ↔ Cr2+, which seems to depend on the nature of the support and metal–support interactions. Such divergence necessitates the efforts to develop an in-depth understanding of the correlations.
(ii) Reaction mechanisms. Liu et al. have observed the resemblance of DRIFT spectra between DHP and the reverse reaction C3H6 hydrogenation in terms of strong adsorbed surface species. (109) A new intermediate propenyl-vanadium (V–C3H5) has been proposed as an alternative key intermediate for CO2–ODHP by taking the elementary steps of C3H6 hydrogenation into consideration, yet still requiring solid evidence. Besides, side reactions are involved in addition to CO2–ODHP reaction, such as RWGS and reverse Boudouard reaction. Continuous efforts have been put forth to identify the intermediates and plausible reaction paths of each reaction by both experimental and computational approaches. However, there is a lack of studies in clarifying the key intermediates and dominating reaction paths by taking the entire reaction network of CO2–ODHP into consideration. In particular, this requires a sufficient amount of in situ characterization techniques to fill the gap.
(iii) Competitive adsorption between CO2, C3H8, and C3H6. There is a competitive adsorption between these molecules, which impacts the C3H8 adsorption and C3H6 yield. Dopants that enable the balance between C3H8 and CO2 adsorption and inhibition of strong C3H6 adsorption are desired.
(iv) Catalyst deactivation and regeneration. For CO2–ODHP, rapid deactivation occurs as a consequence of reduction of active sites and coke formation. Although catalyst stability and regenerability have been examined, testing of long-term stability is rather scarce, nor have regeneration guidelines been comprehensively covered for different catalyst systems. Therefore, endeavors should be made in developing robust, coke-resistant catalysts that meet the requirement of practical implementation in the mid to long-term.
VOx and Fe-containing zeolites are reported to be the most superior catalysts for N2O–ODHP (Figure 32B). Because of the absence of thermodynamic restraints, these Fe-containing zeolite catalysts show activity at a relatively lower temperature of 400 °C. Notwithstanding, potential catalysts that have been tested for N2O–ODHP are still scarce, and more catalyst screening is needed in future studies. For example, there are only a few works regarding metals other than iron-supported/modified zeolites which have been reported. Also, while there are multiple reports regarding MFI and BEA zeolite topology for N2O–ODHP, the effects of other zeolite topologies remain unknown.
Similar to CO2–ODHP, deactivation and regeneration of catalysts in N2O–ODHP remains a challenge. As discussed in section 3.5.3, CO2 can serve as an agent for coke removal, thereby enhancing the catalyst stability, while N2O cannot. Together with the variation in oxidation potential between N2O and CO2, these are likely the reasons why similar catalysts show worse stability in N2O–ODHP. Although a few studies have reported the rapid deactivation of iron-containing zeolite catalysts and vanadia oxide-based catalysts for N2O–ODHP, deactivation studies regarding molybdenum oxide catalysts have been scarcely touched. Thus, further study of these catalysts is needed to address the challenges of stability of catalysts for N2O–ODHP route. (180−183,186,187) For iron-containing zeolite catalysts, there have been studies suggesting that the nature and strength of acid sites have significant impacts on the rate of deactivation, implying that catalyst stability can be further improved based on catalyst design. (182,211) Noteworthily, dehydrogenation using N2O as a soft oxidant has been studied for other alkanes as well, such as ethane, butane, or isobutane, of which isobutane dehydrogenation shows better catalytic performance than propane dehydrogenation using N2O. (211,289,300−303) Therefore, further study to improve catalyst stability seems to be warranted, as dehydrogenation using N2O may not only offer additional ways to subvert challenges faced by O2 oxidant but also may provide a method to utilize N2O.
The introduction of exogenous mild oxidizers is a potentially selective route for DHP. Catalytic oxyhalogenation is a promising route for single-step C3H6 production and yields of up to 55% have been achieved. (49,50) Specifically, oxychlorination chemistry over CeO2 and metal phosphate-based catalysts show good selectivity (up to 95%) and conversion (up to 70% at 500 °C) in comparison to conventional ODHP (Figure 32C). In contrast, the selective activation of propane in oxybromination chemistry is impractical either because of poor selectivity or insufficient stability of catalysts. (45,251) CeO2 possesses strong oxidizing characteristics and results in the highest reactivity in oxychlorination reactions. The overoxidation potential of Ce-based catalysts can be improved by heteroatom doping into the CeO2 structure. The high C3H6 yield (i.e., 55%) and selectivity (i.e., 80%) for 8% NiO–CeO2 are mainly due to a balanced redox ability at 500 °C. (49) On the other hand, metal phosphates such as CrPO4 (yield = 50% at 500 °C) are moderate oxidizers, leading to high selectivity (i.e., ≥95%) but lower activity than CeO2 under identical conditions. (50) To summarize, an optimal propane oxychlorination catalyst should exhibit moderate redox properties so that it enables alkane activation but does not favor alkane overoxidation, combustion, and evolution of Cl2, while possessing fast dehydrochlorination kinetics.
The gaseous sulfur compounds, on the other hand, act as effective DHP mediators because of their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction from a hydrocarbon molecule (Figure 32D). C3H6 yield rises up to 81% over Al2O3 at 750 °C and 93% over Co–Mo/Al2O3 at 450 °C, indicating a potential to revolutionize propane dehydrogenation chemistry. (231,232) Interestingly, the highest reported yield for C3H6 (either in DHP or ODHP) in various patents are over Al2O3 and Co–Mo/Al2O3, which are used in industrial Claus or hydrodesulfurization process. However, the exact nature of the active sites is still unclear from the studies to date because of the lack of catalyst characterization and mechanistic studies. (40,222,242−245)
Because of the extremely corrosive nature of sulfur or halogen, operando and in situ techniques are seldom used. The potential scalability of the underlying process and corrosion issues combined with the recovery process of sulfur, halogen, or hydrogen halide products will require suitable materials, reactors, and sophisticated process engineering. Sulfur-mediated dehydrogenation chemistry in particular has shown potential to selectively activate propane by capitalizing on abundant natural gas reserves. (25,26) However, the susceptibility of the material to be attacked by sulfur, halogens, HX, and halogenated products requires testing of materials under actual reaction conditions. To deal with the above-mentioned hurdles, significant endeavors should be devoted to developing a sufficiently active and stable catalyst with an in-depth understanding of the structure–activity relationship, as well as reaction kinetics. This is especially true for various recent industry efforts outlined in a number of patents, where efforts toward developing innovative strategies, such as either using gaseous sulfur or some sulfur compound (H2S/S2/COS) with O2 have ensued. However, catalyst characterization, stability tests, structure–activity relationships, and reaction kinetics are nearly nonexistent in the patent literature. The absence of detailed kinetic studies makes it impossible to have information about the reaction network for sulfur-based ODHP. Therefore, this process requires the systematic kinetic and operando studies (such as PEPICO) to understand the genesis of sulfur-based byproducts obtained in the process. Furthermore, techno-economic analysis is scarce and should be performed comparing the best catalyst (or processes) with existing technologies, such as DHP and ODHP.
A comparison of catalytic performance is also made between O2–ODHP and ODHP with soft oxidants in the form of selectivity–conversion correlation over the array of developed catalysts, as presented in Figure 33. In comparison to O2–ODHP, ODHP with soft oxidants shows comparable C3H6 selectivity under the same range of C3H8 conversion (i.e., <∼20%). In particular, CO2–ODHP exhibits higher selectivity among all reaction routes. Moreover, the high selectivity, namely, >∼80%, can be well retained at the C3H8 conversion as high as ∼53%. The C3H8 conversion of other reaction routes with soft oxidants, such as SO2-mediated DHP and oxyhalogenation can also reach high values (i.e., 30–70%), yet with lower selectivity (i.e., 50–80%). Noteworthily, this way of comparison is not completely fair, as it overlooks the effects of other critical parameters, such as temperature, feed compositions, GHSV, etc. However, a general trend of activity–selectivity spans of each reaction route has been revealed and provided perspective for further research in the dehydrogenation of propane and other light alkanes.

While there is still significant progress to be made in the development of better ODHP catalysts, theoretical studies in the literature have provided useful insights toward this problem with regards to mechanistic understanding and catalyst design principles. With CO2 for example, its dissociation, hydrogenation, and poisoning on the surface can all factor prominently toward its catalytic activity. In addition, there are a number of competing reactions that can govern the selectivity to the ODHP product that also should be considered. (304) Modeling these pathways through microkinetics or kinetic Monte Carlo has been shown to be very useful in that regard. (283) On the other hand, descriptors, when available, have also proven to be useful when there is a need to screen across a large number of potential catalysts. (292,298) However, high-throughput screening of catalysts for alkane conversion has remained primarily focused on C–H activation, with far less study on the catalyst reoxidation step. (269) In addition, investigations into the catalyst stability using soft oxidants have yet to feature prominently in modeling efforts, which is relevant for the practical applications. In conclusion, additional theoretical studies in these areas would be highly beneficial to move the field forward and guide experimental efforts, particularly in finding catalysts suitable for corrosive or less-studied oxidants, such as NOx, SOx, and halides.
Efforts are also devoted to developing alternative technologies beyond packed catalyst bed, such as chemical looping and membrane reactor. Chemical looping offers opportunities for process intensification and energy loss minimization, which is of significance in future commercialization. (305) Current progress focuses on the feasibility of O2-assisted dehydrogenation of light alkanes. (306,307) Membrane reactors are emerging as an active research direction in light alkane conversion, such as propane dehydrogenation (308,309) and methane conversion, (310) because it enables the process intensification by integrating oxidant permeability and catalytic activity in one unit. (311) In ODHP, this novel reactor can achieve a uniform distribution of oxidant, thereby resulting in inhibited overoxidation and enhanced C3H6 selectivity. Kawi et al. have applied a novel hollow fiber catalytic membrane reactor for O2–ODHP, in which the membrane reactor was fabricated by integrating BaBi0.05Ci0.8Nb0.15O3−δ (BBCN) perovskite hollow fiber membrane with silica-supported isolated Co2+ catalyst. (311) The fabricated membrane reactor has achieved C3H6 yield and selectivity of ∼50% and ∼74%, respectively, at 650 °C with the TOS at 50 h. The key aspect to guarantee a higher C3H6 selectivity is to optimize the C3H8/O2 ratio to maintain high C3H8 conversion and to avoid overoxidation. Specifically, the C3H8 feeding rate should match the oxygen permeation through the membrane. The soft oxidants discussed in this review have similar kinetic diameters (i.e., ∼320–360 pm), which are all smaller than the reagent C3H8 (i.e., 430 pm) and target product C3H6 (i.e., 450 pm), corroborating the feasibility of utilizing membrane reactors for further enhancement in activity and selectivity.
