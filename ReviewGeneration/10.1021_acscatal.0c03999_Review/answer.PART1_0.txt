[1] Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none.

[2] Relatively weak metalsupport interaction appears to benefit C3H6 formation, such as SiO2. In the presence of CO2, the partially oxidized Cr2O3 surface and the boundaries of Cr2O3 and SiO2, are responsible for the improved C3H6 yield.

[3] The catalytic performance of Ga2O3 polymorphs for CO2ODHP decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α. Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the same order, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3. 

[4] Characterization results confirm the homogeneous mixing of Ga with Zr in the Ga2O3ZrO2 oxides with strong interactions, as well as the monotonic increase in Lewis acid sites with the increase in Ga content in the oxides.

[5] The CH bond scission is shown to be more thermodynamically favorable and kinetically feasible than CC bond scission on the bulk-terminated Fe3Ni(111) surface, while Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) favors CC bond scission.

1. The article evaluates promising metal oxide catalysts including Cr2O3, Fe2O3 and Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. Among them, Ga2O3 exhibited the highest C3H6 yield, followed by Fe2O3 and then Cr2O3. Weak metal-support interactions, such as with SiO2, were found to benefit C3H6 formation for Cr2O3 catalysts.

2. The article investigates how tuning oxidation states and acid-base properties affects performance. For Ga2O3 polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 with the highest surface acidity showed the best initial activity. Increasing Ga content in Ga2O3-ZrO2 mixed oxides also increased Lewis acid sites and improved performance. 

3. For Fe3Ni bimetallic catalysts, DFT calculations revealed CH bond scission to be more favorable than CC bond scission on Fe3Ni(111), leading to propane dehydrogenation. In contrast, CC scission was more favorable on Ni3Pt(111), leading to dry reforming.

1. 该文评估了Cr2O3、Fe2O3和Ga2O3等有前景的金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。其中,Ga2O3的C3H6收率最高,其次是Fe2O3,然后是Cr2O3。弱的金属载体相互作用,如SiO2,有利于Cr2O3催化剂上的C3H6形成。

2. 该文研究了如何调节氧化态和酸碱性以影响性能。对于Ga2O3多型体,表面酸度最高的β-Ga2O3表现出最好的初始活性。在Ga2O3-ZrO2混合氧化物中,Ga含量的增加也增加了Lewis酸位,改进了性能。

3. 对于Fe3Ni双金属催化剂,DFT计算显示CH键断裂在Fe3Ni(111)上比CC键断裂更有利,导致丙烷脱氢反应。相比之下,CC键断裂在Ni3Pt(111)上更有利,导致干式改造反应。
