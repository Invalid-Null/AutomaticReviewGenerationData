 Unfortunately the literature provided does not contain relevant quotes or information to answer any of the questions. The article is focused on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using soft oxidants like CO2 and N2O, and does not evaluate bimetallic or alloy catalysts, effects of subsurface promoters, zeolite supports, or tuning zeolite properties like Si/Al ratio.
