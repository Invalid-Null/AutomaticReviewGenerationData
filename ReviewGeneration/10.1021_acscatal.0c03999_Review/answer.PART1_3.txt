1. The article evaluates promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3 and Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on how the dispersion, oxidation states, and evolution of Cr and Ga species with increasing metal loading affects dehydrogenation performance. For example, Cr3+/Cr2+ and tetrahedral Ga3+ sites are identified as active sites.

2. The article investigates how tuning oxidation states and acid-base properties affects performance. For Cr oxides, completing the Cr6+/Cr3+/Cr2+ redox cycle is crucial. For Ga oxides, the surface acid site density correlates with initial activity, with β-Ga2O3 showing the highest acid site density and activity.

3. The article proposes redox cycles involving Cr3+/Cr2+ or Cr6+/Cr3+/Cr2+ species as active sites for Cr oxide catalysts. For Ga oxides, a heterolytic dissociation mechanism is proposed, with tetrahedral Ga3+ sites as active Lewis acid sites. 

4. The article explores metal-support interactions. Weaker interaction with SiO2 benefits Cr oxide performance. Acid-base properties of supports like Al2O3 and ZrO2 also modulate Ga oxide activity by affecting surface Ga3+ site density.

5. The article does not evaluate supported noble metal catalysts.

6. The article does not investigate properties like particle size and shape effects for supported metals.
