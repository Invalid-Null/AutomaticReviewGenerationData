[1] This review covers recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants over a variety of catalysts, including transition metal oxides, non-redox metal oxides, zeolites, and carbon-based materials. It discusses the importance of propylene as a key building block in the petrochemical industry and the challenges faced in its production through catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. 

[2] The article describes how catalysts lower the activation energy barriers for dehydrogenation reactions by providing alternative reaction pathways. Specific mechanisms discussed include redox cycles of transition metal oxides, heterolytic dissociation of C-H bonds over acid-base site pairs, and hydrogen transfer between surface species.

[3] The major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation mentioned in the review include transition metal oxides (e.g. CrOx, VOx), non-redox metal oxides (e.g. Ga2O3), zeolites (e.g. H-ZSM-5), and supported metals (e.g. Pt, Pd).

[4] The article discusses how thermodynamic limitations and kinetic factors affect propane dehydrogenation. For example, it states that CO2-assisted dehydrogenation is endothermic and thermodynamically limited, while N2O-assisted dehydrogenation is exothermic and kinetically controlled. 

[5] The review covers the application of DFT calculations to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms on surfaces. For example, calculations have provided insights into CO2 dissociation, competing reaction pathways, and descriptors correlating catalyst properties to activity.

[6] The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation.

[7] The review describes computational and experimental work identifying structure-activity relationships for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. For example, it relates Cr and V dispersion, oxidation states, and support interactions to observed catalytic performance.
