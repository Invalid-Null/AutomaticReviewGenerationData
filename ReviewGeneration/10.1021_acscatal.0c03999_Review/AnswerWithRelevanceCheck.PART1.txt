         [1] Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none.
         [2] Relatively weak metalsupport interaction appears to benefit C3H6 formation, such as SiO2. In the presence of CO2, the partially oxidized Cr2O3 surface and the boundaries of Cr2O3 and SiO2, are responsible for the improved C3H6 yield.
         [3] The catalytic performance of Ga2O3 polymorphs for CO2ODHP decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α. Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the same order, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3.
         [4] Characterization results confirm the homogeneous mixing of Ga with Zr in the Ga2O3ZrO2 oxides with strong interactions, as well as the monotonic increase in Lewis acid sites with the increase in Ga content in the oxides.
         [5] Cr2O3/SiO2 outperforms the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3.

         The article evaluates promising metal oxide catalysts including Cr2O3, Fe2O3 and Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. Among them, Ga2O3 exhibited the highest C3H6 yield, followed by Fe2O3 and then Cr2O3. Weak metal-support interactions, such as with SiO2, were found to benefit C3H6 formation for Cr2O3 catalysts. The catalytic performance of Ga2O3 polymorphs correlates with surface acidity, with β-Ga2O3 showing the highest initial activity. Increasing Ga content in Ga2O3-ZrO2 mixed oxides also increased Lewis acid sites. Additionally, Cr2O3/SiO2 showed high C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield compared to other metal oxides.

         [1] Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene can be achieved using conventional, oxygen-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (O2ODHP) or via the use of soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogens/halides.
         [2] β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity.
         [3] The authors find the highest selectivity to the ODH product with FeNi/CeO2. DFT is used to rationalize this behavior by comparing the energy profiles for successive CH dissociation and CC dissociation reactions.
         [4] For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support.  
         [5] β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites.

          The article investigates how tuning oxidation states and acid-base properties affects performance. For Cr oxides, the dispersion and evolution of Cr3+/Cr2+ species with loading determines activity. Completing the Cr3+/Cr2+ redox cycle is crucial. For Ga oxides, the surface acid site density correlates with initial activity, with β-Ga2O3 showing the highest acid site density and activity. Tetrahedral Ga3+ Lewis acid sites are also identified as active sites. DFT studies reveal CH bond scission is favored over CC bond scission on FeNi bimetallics, explaining the high selectivity.

         [1] The redox cycle: Cr6+ → Cr3+/Cr2+ and Cr3+ → Cr2+. The former redox cycle is proposed on MCM-41  
         [2] Ga2O3 can be reduced upon contact with C3H8 molecules, its oxidation state remains stable during reaction. Instead, the reaction appears to proceed through the proposed heterolytic dissociation mechanism.
         [3] As illustrated in Figure 10A, C3H8 heterolytic dissociation (eqs 3-6 and 3-7) in DHP, eq 3-6 proceeds slowly and is, therefore, proposed as the RDS.

         The article proposes mechanistic scenarios involving redox cycles for Cr oxides with Cr3+/Cr2+ or Cr6+/Cr3+/Cr2+ as active sites. For Ga oxides, a heterolytic dissociation path involving tetrahedral Ga3+ sites is proposed, with C3H8 dissociation as the rate-limiting step.

          [2] The nature of the support and its interaction with gallium oxide are crucial to manipulate the reactivity, and can be reflected in the differences in H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties.
          [3] TiO2-, ZrO2-, and Al2O3-supported Ga2O3 catalysts display higher activity than MgO- and SiO2-supported counterparts, again corroborating the crucial role of acid sites on Ga2O3 for C3H8 dehydrogenation.

         The article explores metal-support interfacial effects. For Cr oxides, weaker interaction with SiO2 improves performance. For Ga oxides, the acid-base property of the support affects activity by modulating surface Ga3+ site density, with TiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3 showing higher activity than SiO2 and MgO.
