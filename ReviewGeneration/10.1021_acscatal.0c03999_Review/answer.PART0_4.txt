[1] "The dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers through two key mechanisms: (i) overcoming the thermodynamic limit imposed by the endothermic nature of the reaction, which requires high energy input, and (ii) reducing catalyst deactivation from coke formation.

[1] "In an early work led by Ge et al., the prominent activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 has been confirmed via screening tests on Cr2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, Cr2O3/γ-Al2O3, Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/TiO2, and Cr2O3/MCM-41"

[2] "Ga2O3, β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity" 

[3] "Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons"

[4] "Supported Mo2C is reported to be active for methane conversion to benzene, in which Mo2C is crucial in activating the CH bond of methane and subsequently forming CHx fragments on the surface."

[1] "On VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy."

[2] "For the CO2ODHP reaction, the reaction is endothermic and not a spontaneous reaction at room temperature because of its highly positive Gibbs free energy."

[3] "CO2ODHP is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. The article discusses thermodynamic constraints like the endothermic nature of the reaction and kinetic factors like activation energy barriers. It provides quantitative details such as the Gibbs free energy being highly positive at room temperature, and activation barriers around 1.76 eV on VOx/SiO2 catalysts. It also notes the exothermic nature of ODHP helps overcome thermodynamic limitations.

[1] "On the basis of these supported Cr catalysts, one can postulate a potential correlation of the nature of the support with Cr reducibility, as well as with Cr loading-dependent dispersion."

[2] "DFT calculations reveal that the reaction is initiated by the formation of peroxide species over oxygen vacancies, which can oxidize Cl into Cl•, and the surface-bound Cl• radical is responsible for CH activation."

[3] "DFT studies of CO2ODHP over Ga2O3(100) surface and suggested that C3H6 forms via DHP in CO2ODHP."
