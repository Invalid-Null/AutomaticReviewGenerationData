[1] The article provides background on the importance of propylene production, stating "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives."

[2] The article explains how catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by activating C-H bonds, stating "To achieve high activity and selectivity, introducing mesoporous silica as a support offers avenues to tune these factors. The materials that have been explored include MCM-41, MSU-x, SBA-15/SBA-1, and TUD-1."

[3] The article introduces major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation such as "transition metal oxides (Fe2O3 and Cr2O3) and main-group metal oxides (Ga2O3, Al2O3, and SiO2)...ordered, mesoporous materials, such as SBA-1/SBA-15/MCM-41, and carbon-based supports with tunable surface functional groups." 

[4] The article discusses thermodynamic constraints, stating "one major advantage of O2ODHP is its thermodynamic favorability due to its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures. However, this advantage is no longer relevant in the case of CO2ODHP because all major reactions are endothermic." It also provides kinetic factors like apparent activation energies.

[5] The article describes how DFT has provided insights into mechanisms and pathways, stating "DFT calculations combined with detailed kinetic analysis provide insights into the reaction mechanisms" for CeO2 catalysts. 

[6] The article presents microkinetic modeling of ODH pathways and controlling factors like the trade-off between ODHP and dry reforming paths.

[7] The article describes structure-activity relationships revealed from theory and experiments, like the correlation between oxygen binding energies of metal nodes in MOFs and N2O activation barriers.
