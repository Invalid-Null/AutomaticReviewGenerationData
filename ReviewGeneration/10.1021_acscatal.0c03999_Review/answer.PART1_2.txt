[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene can be achieved using conventional, oxygen-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (O2ODHP) or via the use of soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogens/halides."

[2] "Botavina et al. have prepared a series of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts with a wide range of Cr loadings (0.57.5 wt. %) and have attained comparable activity to that required by industrial processes (e.g., conversion  50% and olefin  90%). (55) (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 (5 wt. % Cr loading) exhibits the best performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity, while (Cr2O3)7.5/SiO2 with a higher Cr loading leads to reductions in both (Table 2)."  

[3] "Zheng et al. have evaluated the activity performance of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs for CO2ODHP. (121) β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5). Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3."

[4] "Nowicka et al. have prepared Pd catalysts supported on CeZrAlOx mixed oxides with various compositions and evaluated their activity in CO2ODHP. (171) Screening tests clarify that the optimal composition and Pd loading are obtained on Ce0.25Zr0.25Al0.5Ox-supported Pd catalyst (Table 7); Pd/Ce0.25Zr0.25Al0.5Ox also displays long-term stability of C3H8 conversion from 40 to 140 h on stream, along with a slight rise of C3H6 selectivity from 94% to 98%."
