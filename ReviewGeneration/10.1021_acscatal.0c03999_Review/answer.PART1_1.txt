[1] Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene can be achieved using conventional, oxygen-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (O2ODHP) or via the use of soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogens/halides.

[2] β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity. 

[3] The authors find the highest selectivity to the ODH product with FeNi/CeO2. DFT is used to rationalize this behavior by comparing the energy profiles for successive CH dissociation and CC dissociation reactions.

[4] Operando photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy enables the detection of reactants, products, and short-lived intermediates such as radicals under reaction conditions. Recently, PEPICO has been applied in propane oxyhalogenation over the CrPO4 catalyst to shed light on mechanisms, especially in the gas phase.

<English version answer>

1. The article mentions that oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene can be achieved using soft oxidants like CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogens/halides, in addition to conventional oxygen-assisted dehydrogenation.

2. The article evaluates β- and γ-Ga2O3 as promising metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that they outperform other Ga2O3 polymorphs in conversion and selectivity, which correlates with their higher surface acidity.

3. The article proposes mechanistic scenarios that the FeNi/CeO2 catalyst favors propane dehydrogenation over other undesired pathways like cracking, based on DFT calculations comparing CH versus CC bond activation. This explains its high selectivity experimentally.

4. The article utilizes operando PEPICO spectroscopy to detect radical intermediates during propane oxychlorination over CrPO4. This provides mechanistic insights, showing activation occurs on the catalyst surface rather than in the gas phase.

1. 这篇文章提到,除了常规的氧辅助丙烷脱氢之外,也可以通过软氧化剂比如CO2、N2O、含硫化合物和卤素/卤化物来实现丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢。

2. 这篇文章评估了β-和γ-Ga2O3这两种有前途的金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它显示这两种都优于其他Ga2O3多形,相关到它们更高的表面酸性。

3. 这篇文章根据DFT计算结果提出FeNi/CeO2催化剂更倾向于丙烷脱氢而不是其他不需要的途径比如裂化,这可以解释它的高选择性。

4. 这篇文章利用在线PEPICO光谱技术检测CrPO4催化剂上丙烷氧卤化过程中的自由基中间体。这为机理提供了见解,表明活化发生在催化剂表面而不是气相中。
