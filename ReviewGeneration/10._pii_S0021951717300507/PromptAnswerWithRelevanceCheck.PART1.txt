1. No, the article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on investigating ZrO2-based catalysts promoted with La2O3 or Y2O3.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
1. 本文没有评价类似Cr2O3、Pt-Sn、Ga2O3等有前景的金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。文章的重点是研究掺杂La2O3或Y2O3的ZrO2基催化剂。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] High activity, selectivity, and durability of our catalysts were verified by comparing their performance under industrially relevant conditions with that of a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material in a series of 60 PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles at 550, 600, and 625 °C.
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that high temperature reduction of the ZrO2 catalysts increases their activity by generating more Zr coordinatively unsaturated sites, which are active for dehydrogenation. However, over-reduction decreases activity, likely by removing too much lattice oxygen or changing the intrinsic activity of the Zr sites.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
2. 是的,文章研究了调节氧化态如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。结果显示,高温还原ZrO2催化剂可以增加其活性,因为会生成更多的Zr配位不饱和位点,这些位点对脱氢反应活性很好。但是,过度还原会降低活性,可能是因为去除了过多的晶格氧,或者改变了Zr位点的固有活性。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] On the basis of the above results and our previous study [20], as well as under consideration of literature data on alkane dehydrogenation over CrOx- [45], [46], [47] and GaOx-containing catalysts [48], [49], we put forward that a PDH active site consists of Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen (Fig. 5(a)).

[2] Such pair is responsible for breaking CH bond in C3H8 resulting in the formation of surface Zrcus-C3H7 and OH species. After the elimination of the β-hydrogen in the former species, gas-phase C3H6 and H2 are formed and the active site is regenerated.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the ZrO2 catalysts. It suggests the active site consists of a Zr cation with unsaturated coordination (Zrcus) paired with a neighboring lattice oxygen. This site breaks the C-H bond in propane, forming a Zrcus-C3H7 intermediate and OH species. Elimination of a β-hydrogen then releases propene and regenerates the active site.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
3. 是的,文章提出了ZrO2催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机理场景。文中认为活性位点由配位不饱和的锆阳离子(Zrcus)和相邻的晶格氧组成。该位点可以断裂丙烷中的C-H键,形成Zrcus-C3H7中间体和氢氧根。随后β位氢的消除释放出丙烯,并再生活性位点。
