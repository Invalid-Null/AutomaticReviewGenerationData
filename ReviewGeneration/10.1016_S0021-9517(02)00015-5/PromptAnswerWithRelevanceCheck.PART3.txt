<quotes>
[1] "Several papers published in recent years have examined a variety of catalytic systems [1], [2], [3]. These systems can be roughly classified into two groups, the first including oxides of reducible transition metal ions, for which a mainly heterogeneous, ionic-type process is involved, provided temperatures below 550600 C are used, and the second including non-redox-type or hardly reducible oxides, which operate at temperatures higher than 600 C and with mechanisms, usually beginning on the catalyst surface and then transferring into the gas phase."

[2] "Amongst the former class of catalysts, vanadium oxide, either supported or in combination with other ions to form mixed oxides, is recognized to be a key component for the activation and oxifunctionalization of paraffins [6], [7]."

[3] "In the present paper we compare the performance in propane oxydehydrogenation of vanadium-oxide-based catalysts where the active compound has been dispersed in a silica matrix by the one-pot, cogel procedure [25], [26]."

[1] "Systems based on vanadium oxide dispersed in silica gel through the one-pot, co-gelation procedure were tested as catalysts for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene under co-feeding and under cyclic (redox-decoupling) conditions."

[2] "Evidence was obtained showing that an important factor for the achievement of better selectivity to propylene in oxydehydrogenation of propane is the amount of vanadium oxide, and thus the degree of dispersion of the active sites, specifically V ions, in an inert matrix."  

[3] "Higher dispersion provides the necessary isolation of active sites, which is one fundamental factor in selective oxidation reactions to avoid the occurrence of consecutive reactions on the desired product."
