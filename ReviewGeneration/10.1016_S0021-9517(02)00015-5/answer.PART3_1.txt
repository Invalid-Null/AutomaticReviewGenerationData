<quotes>
[1] "Several papers published in recent years have examined a variety of catalytic systems [1], [2], [3]. These systems can be roughly classified into two groups, the first including oxides of reducible transition metal ions, for which a mainly heterogeneous, ionic-type process is involved, provided temperatures below 550600 C are used, and the second including non-redox-type or hardly reducible oxides, which operate at temperatures higher than 600 C and with mechanisms, usually beginning on the catalyst surface and then transferring into the gas phase."

[2] "Amongst the former class of catalysts, vanadium oxide, either supported or in combination with other ions to form mixed oxides, is recognized to be a key component for the activation and oxifunctionalization of paraffins [6], [7]."

[3] "In the present paper we compare the performance in propane oxydehydrogenation of vanadium-oxide-based catalysts where the active compound has been dispersed in a silica matrix by the one-pot, cogel procedure [25], [26]."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses dispersing vanadium oxide active sites in a silica matrix using a one-pot cogelation procedure. This is done to optimize dispersion of the active sites.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,文章研究了针对优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它讨论了使用一锅共凝胶法在硅基质中分散钒氧化物活性位点。这样做是为了优化活性位点的分散。
