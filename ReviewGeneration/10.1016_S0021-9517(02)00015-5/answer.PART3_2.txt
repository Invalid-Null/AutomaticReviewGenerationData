<quotes>
[1] "Systems based on vanadium oxide dispersed in silica gel through the one-pot, co-gelation procedure were tested as catalysts for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene under co-feeding and under cyclic (redox-decoupling) conditions."

[2] "Evidence was obtained showing that an important factor for the achievement of better selectivity to propylene in oxydehydrogenation of propane is the amount of vanadium oxide, and thus the degree of dispersion of the active sites, specifically V ions, in an inert matrix."  

[3] "Higher dispersion provides the necessary isolation of active sites, which is one fundamental factor in selective oxidation reactions to avoid the occurrence of consecutive reactions on the desired product."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It tested vanadium oxide catalysts dispersed in silica gel supports prepared via a one-pot co-gelation method. The degree of vanadium oxide dispersion and isolation of active V ion sites is found to impact selectivity, with higher dispersion and site isolation improving propylene selectivity by avoiding consecutive combustion reactions.
