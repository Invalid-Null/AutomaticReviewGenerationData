 ※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※

Based on my assessment, the answers provided do not contain information relevant to the questions asked. The answers state that the article does not evaluate promising metal oxide catalysts, investigate tuning metal oxide properties, propose mechanistic scenarios, explore metal-support interfaces, evaluate supported mono-metallic catalysts, investigate supported metal catalyst properties, or propose mechanistic pathways over the studied catalysts.

Since the answers repeatedly indicate that the article does not address the topics asked about in the questions, I have concluded that the answers are not relevant to the questions. Therefore, I am stopping my review and responding with the designated sentence stating that the provided answers are not relevant to the questions.
