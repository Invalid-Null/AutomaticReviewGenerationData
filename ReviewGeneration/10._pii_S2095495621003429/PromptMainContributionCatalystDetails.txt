AbstractAbstract
Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation reaction for the production of propylene. Suppressing irreversible deactivation caused by the sintering of Pt particles under harsh conditions and regeneration process is a significant challenge in this catalyst. Herein, a series of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites, are fabricated and used as the support to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters. Characterizations of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 with XRD, NMR, CO-IR, STEM, TG, and Raman techniques along with propane dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles test reveal the structure-stability-regenerability relationship. The coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) can strongly anchor Pt atoms via a formation of Al-O-Pt bond, and thus stabilize the Pt-based particles at the surface of Al2O3. The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. The Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 with the highest level of Al3+penta (50.8%) delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which exhibits propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity above 98% at 570 °C with 10 vol% C3H8 and 10 vol% H2 feed. A slow deactivation in this catalyst is ascribed to the formation of coke, and the catalytic performance can be fully restored in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles via a simple calcination treatment.

1. Introduction
Propylene as the second-largest petrochemical commodity, has been widely used for the production of a wide array of chemicals, such as polypropylene, acetone, propylene oxide, and propionaldehyde [1]. With an increasing demand for the downstream chemicals from propylene, considerable effort has been dedicated to the development of on-purpose propylene production technology [2]. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has recently attracted a great deal of attention, because it uses cheap and abundant shale gas as the feedstock and achieves high propylene selectivity in the catalytic reaction [3], [4], [5], [6], [7].
The Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst has been successfully commercialized in propane dehydrogenation known as Oleflex process developed by the UOP company. The propane dehydrogenation reaction is highly endothermic, and thus it should be carried out at a high temperature of above 550 °C to obtain a feasible propane conversion [8]. Under such high temperature, Pt sintering always takes place. The consequent growth of Pt particle leads to both a rapid deactivation and a significant decrease in selectivity. To overcome these drawbacks, an oxychlorination process is required to re-disperse the agglomerated Pt particles [9], [10]. The oxychlorination treatment can dissolve large Pt particles via the formation of oxychloridic platinum complexes. These complexes possess a high level of mobility at the high temperature, which enables Pt species to be re-dispersed at the surface of Al2O3. The oxychlorination treatment allows restoring the initial catalytic performance of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. However, the use of harmful halogenated species (such as Cl2, HCl, CCl4, or C2H6Cl2) poses serious problems of corrosion of the dehydrogenation facility, with economic and safety implications. Besides, the growing attention to environmental issues stimulates the elimination of this critical regeneration step. Therefore, one of the most promising alternative strategy is represented by the development of the sinter-resistant Pt catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
Pt clusters below 2 nm are frequently used in the propane dehydrogenation [11], [12], [13], [14]. The bulk Pt metal has a melting temperature of up to 1772 °C, but Pt particle melting temperature decreases to 405 °C when its size reduces to 1.5 nm [15]. Moreover, Pt clusters possess a very high surface-to-volume ratio and become thermodynamically unstable. Therefore, the sintering of Pt clusters takes place via the migration of nanoparticles and Ostwald ripening process [16]. The stability of the Pt cluster at the surface of a support can be dramatically enhanced by the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) [17], [18], [19]. The Pt clusters can be firmly anchored at the heteroatom in the lattice of different support. The raft-like Pt clusters stabilized in the lattice-confined Sn (IV/II) generates a highly selective and durable Pt-Sn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, because the confined Sn (IV/II) sites facilitate the Pt clusters with good durability and stability through Pt-Sn interactions [20]. Pt clusters localized at the Sn single-site in zeolite framework deliver high catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation, and the improved performance of Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is mainly due to a strong interaction between the Pt cluster and the framework of Sn-zeolite [21]. Al2O3 with some defective structures is also found to be able to stabilize the atomically dispersed Pt species [22]. The coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) centers at the surface of the Al2O3 are confirmed to be the anchoring sites that are able to confine the Pt clusters. The Al2O3 materials with different structure and morphology have been used as the support for the dispersion of Pt clusters, and the obtained catalysts exhibit high catalytic activities with 99% selectivity [23].
Pt-based catalysts mentioned above exhibit enhanced stability in propane dehydrogenation, but less attention was dedicated to studying their regeneration property. The possibility to easily and effectively regenerate a catalyst is of paramount importance for the practical application, especially in the case of Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. In this study, we investigate the impact of the structure of different Al2O3 supports on the stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation, and the structure-stability-regenerability relationship was elucidated. It was found that the stability and regenerability of these Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts is greatly dependent on the amount of pentacoordinate Al3+ sites, and the activity of Pt-Sn2/Al2O3 catalysts with 50.8% of pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can be fully restored in the regeneration process.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
2.1 g EO20PO70EO20 (Aldrich, Pluronic P123, average molecular weight = 5800 g/mol) was dissolved in a mixture of 40 mL ethanol (Sinopharm, AR) and 3.2 mL 67 wt% nitric acid (Sinopharm, AR) at room temperature. Then 20 mmol aluminum isopropoxide (Sinopharm, AR) was added into the above solution, which was stirred for 6 h. The clear solution was then transferred into an oven and dried at 60 °C for 48 h. The dried gel was ground into powders and then calcined in a flow of air at 600 °C, 800 °C and 1000 °C for 4 h (1 °C/min ramping rate), and the obtained mesoporous Al2O3 were labeled as meso-Al2O3-600, meso-Al2O3-800 and meso-Al2O3-1000, respectively.
Pt-Sn2/Al2O3 catalysts with 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.6 wt% Sn (Pt/Sn atomic ratio of 1/2) were synthesized by a simple co-impregnation method. Al2O3 supports were calcined at 500 °C overnight. The calcined Al2O3 was co-impregnated with Pt and Sn solution. The obtained samples were dried and then reduced in a flow of H2 at 300 °C for 4 h. γ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3 from Sasol company were used as reference alumina in this study. The synthesized catalysts were labeled as Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600, Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-800, Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-1000, Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3, and Pt-Sn2/θ-Al2O3.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Ultimate III diffractometer using Cu Kα (γ = 1.5406 Å) radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA in the 2θ range of 10–80° with a scan rate of 8°/min.
Surface area and pore volume were analyzed by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at liquid nitrogen temperature using a Micromeritics ASAP 2046 M nitrogen adsorption instrument. Before measurement, samples were preheated under vacuum at 300 °C for 6 h. The specific surface area of the samples was determined by the BET method. The cumulative pore volume and pore size were calculated from the desorption branches of the isotherms employing the BJH method.
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of CO adsorption measurement was performed on an IS 50 spectrometer equipped with a cooling and evacuation system. Typically, a 13 mm diameter self-supporting disk compressed from about 10 mg of sample was carefully transferred into the in-situ cell and reduced in a flow of 10 vol% H2 at 300 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, the apparatus was flushed with N2 for 1 h to eliminate any adsorbed hydrogen, and then cooled to room temperature to collect the background spectrum. Afterward, the sample contacted with a flow of CO for 15 min, followed by purging with N2 for 30 min. The frequency of CO chemisorbed was evaluated using IR spectra obtained by after the subtraction of the spectra recorded before CO chemisorption.
High-resolution TEM and HAADF-STEM images were obtained on the aberration-corrected FEI Titan instrument. Before the measurement, samples were prepared on carbon-coated copper by using a drop of an alcohol dispersion of catalyst and evaporating at room temperature. The sizes of Pt-Sn particles were analyzed with the Digital Micrograph software.
27Al MAS NMR measurements were performed at room temperature on a Bruker Avance III 400 WB spectrometer, operating in a magnetic field of 14.4 T, using a 4 mm MAS NMR probe with the spinning rate of 130 kHz at ambient temperature.
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the spent catalysts were conducted on a Mettler-Toledo thermobalance from ambient temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min at a flow of 10 vol% O2 in N2.
Raman spectra were collected using an in Via Reflex Raman spectrometer equipped with a 514.5 nm Ar-ion laser beam and operated at room temperature. Raman spectrum was recorded with an exposure time of 10 s and 4 accumulations.
The dispersion of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts was measured by CO chemisorption on the BELSORB-max apparatus (Bel-Japan). 200 mg of catalysts were pretreated at 200 °C in Ar for 0.5 h. Then the samples were reduced at 300 °C for 2 h with 20 mL/min 10 vol% H2/Ar. After the catalysts were cooled and kept in 20 mL/min Ar at 25 °C. 10 vol% CO/Ar mixture was injected pulses until the consumption peaks become stable. The Pt metal dispersion was calculated by the following equation:
where VCO represents the volume of the adsorbed CO volume (mL), SF represents the stoichiometry factor, MW represents the Pt atomic weight (g/mol) and WPt represents the weight of metallic Pt in the catalyst (g).
2.3. Catalysts reaction
A tubular quartz reactor was filled with 0.2 g of catalyst (20–40 mesh pellets) and placed inside a fixed-bed reactor. The catalyst was pretreated under H2 at 300 °C for 2 h before the catalytic reaction. The propane dehydrogenation was performed under 10 vol% C3H8 and 10 vol% H2 in N2 (total flow = 50 mL/min) at 570 °C for 20 h with a WHSV of 2.9 h−1. After the dehydrogenation reaction in each cycle, the spent catalyst was regenerated by passing O2 over the catalyst at 430 °C at 30 min followed by a 90 min H2 reduction step at 570 °C. 7 consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles were carried on these catalysts to appreciate their regenerability. The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (TCDs) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The FID was used to measure the concentrations of all hydrocarbons, including CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H6, and C3H8 (no dimerization or aromatization product was detected), and TCDs was used to measure the concentrations of N2 and H2.
The carbon balance (above 98%) was calculated from the following equation: carbon balance (%) = 
, and the flow rate of CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H6, and C3H8 was estimated by using the flow rate of N2 as a reference. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were defined as:
The reaction rates of propane divided by mass of Pt (specific activity) and mol of surface Pt atom (normalized activity) are used to express the activity of the catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. The detailed calculation equations of specific activity and normalized activity are shown as follows:
Ã
where FC3H8 represents the volume of gas in the propane reaction (mL), XC3H8 represents the conversion of propane, Wc represents the weight of catalysts (g), MW represents the Pt atomic weight (g/mol), WPt represents the loading of Pt in the catalysts (%) and D represents dispersion (Ptsurface/Pttotal).
A first-order deactivation model was apply to estimate the catalyst stability: kd = {ln [(1 − Xfinal)/Xfinal] − ln[(1-Xinitial)/Xinitial]}/t. Xinitial and Xfinal suggest the initial and final conversion, respectively; t represents the reaction time (h); kd is the deactivation rate constant (h−1).
3. Results and discussion
Highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with amorphous, crystalline γ-phase, or crystalline θ-phase framework walls were prepared through a simple sol–gel route with block copolymers as the soft template. The concentration of pentacoordinate Al3+ sites in these mesoporous Al2O3 can be rationally tuned by varying the calcination temperature in the synthesis procedure.
The direct proof of the formation of meso-structure in these mesoporous Al2O3 is evidenced from small-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns as shown in Fig. 1a. The meso-Al2O3 sample calcined at 600 °C shows a strong diffraction peak at around 1.0°, which can be attributed to p6mm hexagonal symmetry [24]. The meso-structure of mesoporous Al2O3 possesses a certain level of stability, because the diffraction peaks relevant to meso-structure can be kept even after the calcinations at the high temperatures of 800 °C. Fig. 1b exhibits the wide-angle XRD patterns of meso-Al2O3 samples calcined at different temperatures. The crystalline structure of the wall in these mesoporous Al2O3 depends on the calcination temperature, and high calcination temperature leads to the transformation of amorphous wall into the γ-phase or θ-phase [25]. The wall of meso-Al2O3-600 is amorphous, and the amorphous wall is transformed to γ-phase and θ-phase when the calcinations were carried out 800 °C and 1000 °C, respectively. The X-ray diffraction investigation on these meso-Al2O3 samples with the small- and wide-angle techniques confirms that the ordered mesoporous Al2O3 with amorphous, γ-phase or θ-phase framework wall can be prepared at 600–1000 °C. It should be noted that the characteristic diffraction peaks are still well kept after the Pt and Sn components are loaded into the meso-Al2O3 (Fig. S1). Moreover, no reflection peak relative to Pt and Sn structure is observable in these Pt-Sn/meso-Al2O3 samples, which suggests that the Pt and Sn species are highly dispersed at the surface of meso-Al2O3.

The texture properties of these meso-Al2O3, γ-Al2O3, and θ-Al2O3 samples were studied by the N2 adsorption–desorption technique (Fig. 2). All the samples show a typical type IV curve, which gives an evident condensation with a hysteresis at a P/P0 range of 0.6–0.9. The pore size distribution estimated from the BJH model suggests that there is mesopore about 10 nm in these mesoporous Al2O3. The texture properties of these samples are summarized in Table S1. The meso-Al2O3-600 has a large BET surface area of 223 m2/g and a pore volume of 0.52 cm3/g. The calcination of meso-Al2O3 at high temperatures leads to the decrease of both surface area and pore volume. The BET surface areas of 201, and 119 m2/g along with the pore volumes of 0.42, and 0.31 cm3/g are observed in meso-Al2O3-800, and meso-Al2O3-1000.

The 27Al MAS NMR measurement was recorded to know the chemical environment of Al atom in different meso-Al2O3 samples (Fig. 3). Three resonance peaks located at 7, 37, and 66 ppm are detected in these samples, which can be attributed to the central 〈−1/2, 1/2〉 transition of the Al3+ ion in octahedral (AlO6), pentahedral (AlO5), and tetrahedral (AlO4) coordination environments, respectively [26]. A great number of Al3+penta sites (about 50.8%) are detected in the meso-Al2O3-600 sample, and the Al3+octa sites and Al3+tetra sites only account for 21.7% and 27.5%, respectively (Table S2). The formation of pentahedral coordinated Al is due to a large number of defects caused by the large surface area of network [27]. The concentration of Al3+penta site is essentially affected by the calcination temperature, and the high treatment temperature results in a conversion of Al3+penta sites into Al3+octa and Al3+tetra sites [28]. 16.6% and 6.0% of Al3+penta sites are found in meso-Al2O3-800 and meso-Al2O3-1000 samples. By contrast, much less Al3+penta sites are in γ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3 samples, and only about 5.7% and 3.5% Al3+penta sites are detected in these two samples. It has been confirmed that the Al3+penta is the coordinatively unsaturated site, and this site is able to anchor the Pt species via the strong interaction between Al3+penta and Pt atom [22], [23], [29], [30]. The strong interaction between Al3+penta and Pt species is probably due to the formation of Al-O-Pt bond in the structure.

HAADF-STEM characterization was carried out on a typical Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 sample to know the morphology of mesoporous Al2O3 and Pt dispersion (Fig. 4). In fact, the meso-Al2O3-600 possesses a two-dimensional pore architecture, because the ordered hexagonal arrangement of pores and alignment of cylindrical pores can be observed along [0 0 1] and [1 1 0] directions, respectively. The highly dispersed Pt-Sn clusters are distinguishable in the HAADF-STEM images, and these clusters with an average size of 0.70 nm have no well-defined morphology. A further CO chemisorption measurement (Table S3) shows that the dispersity of Pt in this sample is 67.2%, suggesting that most Pt atoms are exposed on the surface. Moreover, the EDX element mapping (Fig. S2) shows that both Pt and Sn elements are homogeneously distributed at the surface of meso-Al2O3-600, and no evident phase separation between Pt and Sn species is observable.

IR spectroscopy with CO as the probe was used to study the local electronic environment of Pt species in γ-Al2O3 and meso-Al2O3-600 (Fig. 5). According to the previous report, the IR absorption of CO adsorbed on metallic Pt species is generally composed of two υ(CO) regions: the band between 2090 and 2000 cm−1 is assigned to linear adsorption on Pt atoms, and the band at 1860–1780 cm−1 is attributed to the bridged adsorption on two neighboring Pt atoms [31]. Recent studies reveal that the Pt(CO)2 dicarbonyl species can be formed selectively on single atoms or small clusters, which is characterized by double bands at 2086 and 2069 cm−1 [32], [33]. For Pt/Al2O3, the band at 2084 cm−1 can be assigned to linearly adsorbed CO on Pt (1 1 1) surface of large particles [33], and other two peaks at around 2064 and 2040 cm−1 can be ascribed to linearly adsorbed CO on high index facets and low-coordinated sites of Pt clusters, respectively [34]. In addition, a broad peak at about 1815 cm−1 is detectable, which is due to the bridge type of CO adsorption. The adsorption of CO on the Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 gives a vibration at 2080 cm−1 with a visible shoulder at 2060 cm−1. The double absorption bands are assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of CO in the Pt(CO)2 dicarbonyl species on small Pt particles. The band assigned to bridge type of CO adsorption become weaker in Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3, which is mainly due to the doping of Pt structure with Sn species for the formation of Pt-Sn cluster. The CO adsorption on Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 gives a different adsorption spectrum. The absorption band at 2054 cm−1 in this sample can be assigned to linearly adsorbed CO on Pt clusters [34], [35], [36], [37], [38]. The wavenumber of this adsorption is lower than that in Pt/meso-Al2O3, which is probably due to the separation of neighboring Pt atoms by Sn for the formation of Pt-Sn cluster [39]. Besides, a linearly absorbed CO peak at a low a wavenumber of 2010 cm−1 is observed, which corresponds to the CO adsorption on weakly coordinated Pt atoms of particularly small metallic Pt particles [31], [40]. A segregation of Pt with Sn leads to a decrease of the band of bridge type of CO adsorption in Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 sample. On the basis of CO-IR characterization, it can be inferred that the Pt species are highly dispersed at the surface of meso-Al2O3-600, which gives rise to the formation of ultra-small Pt-Sn clusters.

A deep investigation on the catalytic performance of obtained catalysts in propane dehydrogenation was carried out. The Weisz-Prater analysis was made so as to eliminate the internal mass transfer limitation (Seeing supporting information), and the Madon-Boudart test was carried out in order to eliminate the external mass transfer limitation (Fig. S3-S5). Based on the results of these two studies, it can be inferred that the propane dehydrogenation over these catalysts takes place in the kinetic regime that is not affected by mass transport limitations.
The propane conversion, propylene selectivity and propane conversion rate in the catalysts in 7 consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles for propane dehydrogenation are shown in Fig. 6. In each cycle, the dehydrogenation reaction was carried out for a long period of 20 h, and then the deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a calcination in the flow of air at 430 °C for 30 min followed by a H2 reduction step at 570 °C for 90 min. Indeed, these catalysts are active and selective in propane dehydrogenation reaction, but they show completely different regeneration behaviors. A general trend can be observed that these Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts have much better regenerability than the conventional Pt-Sn2/θ-Al2O3 and Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The Pt-Sn2/θ-Al2O3 and Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts which have a low content of Al3+penta sites in their structure, undergo an irreversible deactivation, and the loss of propane conversion and propane reaction rate in these two catalysts become more and more evident with an increase of dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. The initial propane conversion in Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 keeps at 47% in the first run, but it drops to 12% after 7 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. Although the Pt-Sn2/θ-Al2O3 has a better regenerability than Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3, the initial propane conversion decreases to 22% in the 7th dehydrogenation-regeneration cycle. On the contrary, the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts show an enhanced regenerability in propane dehydrogenation, and their regenerability essentially depends on the concentration of Al3+penta sites in their structures. The Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-1000 possesses 6.0% Al3+penta sites, and its activity can be partially restored in each dehydrogenation-regeneration cycle. The increase of Al3+penta sites in meso-Al2O3 structure leads to the substantial improvement of regenerability, and the activity in each dehydrogenation-regeneration cycle can be fully restored in the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 which has the highest level of Al3+penta sites (50.8%). The propane conversion in this catalyst slightly decreases from 42.4% to 40.8% in the first run, and propane conversion curves in the following 6 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles remain the same as that in the first run. Excellent regenerability of the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 catalyst can be further revealed from the normalized activity (Fig. S6), and the it keeps unaltered in the dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

The regenerable capability of these catalysts can be directly demonstrated from the average propane conversion in each dehydrogenation-regeneration cycle, as shown in Fig. S7. Average propane conversions and propane reaction rates decrease fast in Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 and Pt-Sn2/θ-Al2O3 catalysts. A slow drop of average propane conversion and propane reaction rates are observed in the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-1000 and Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-800 catalysts. No evident loss of average propane conversion and propane reaction rate is observable in the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 catalyst, which strongly suggests that this catalyst has excellent regenerability in propane dehydrogenation. Note that the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 exhibit better regenerability than those in the recent reports [41], [42], [43], and an evident drop of average propane conversion in each dehydrogenation-regeneration cycle can be observed in these reports. The normalized propane reaction rate with surface Pt atom in Fig. S8 also indicates that its activity can be fully restored in each regeneration process. The regeneration rate, which is defined as follows: Re = Xn/X0 (Where X0 and Xn refer to the initial and the Nth average propane conversion, respectively) is used to identify the dependence of the regenerability on concentration of Al3+penta sites in Al2O3 structure. As shown in Fig. 7, the regeneration rate decreases with the loss of the Al3+penta concentration in Al2O3 structure. The regeneration rate of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 catalyst maintains ~100% in each dehydrogenation-regeneration cycle.

Fig. 7. Regenerate rate of different Pt-Sn2/Al2O3 catalysts in 7 consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles for propane dehydrogenation.
A first-order deactivation model is applied to understand the deactivation behavior, and the deactivation rates of all the catalysts in each cycle are summarized in Fig. 8 [44]. The deactivation rates of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 in each cycle are lower than those in Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3. Moreover, the deactivation rates of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 keep almost unchanged in each cycle; however, the deactivation rates of Pt-Sn2/θ-Al2O3 and Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 decrease with an increase of dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. The carbon formation is the main factor leading to the deactivation of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3. The elimination of carbon deposition by a simple calcination leads to restoring the structure of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 in the regeneration process (Fig. S9 confirms the total removal of carbon deposition, and no carbon was detected in the element analysis of the restored catalyst), and therefore the deactivation rates in Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 remain unaltered. On the contrary, both carbon deposition and sintering of Pt particle occur in the propane dehydrogenation over Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. Therefore, the deactivation rates in Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts is higher than those in Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3. Moreover, the sintering of Pt particle in Pt-Sn2/θ-Al2O3 and Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts is irreversible, and it becomes less evident when Pt particles grow larger. In such a case, the deactivation rates in the Pt-Sn2/θ-Al2O3 and Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts firstly decrease and then remain stable with the increase of regeneration cycles.

Fig. 8. Deactivation rate of different Pt-Sn2/Al2O3 catalysts in 7 consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles for propane dehydrogenation.
The spent catalysts were studied with different techniques in order to elucidate the deactivation mechanism. Raman measurements were conducted on the selected deactivated catalyst after the 7th run, in order to explore the coke structure (Fig. 9). Two distinct peaks can be observed around 1350 cm−1 (D band) and 1580 cm−1 (G band) in the deactivated catalysts, which are generally ascribed to the disordered graphitic lattice and ideal graphitic lattice, respectively [45]. The ratio of AD/AG is regarded as an index for the graphitization degree of carbon materials, and higher AD/AG ratio represents lower graphitization degree [46], [47]. Obviously, the spent Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 catalyst has the highest AD/AG ratio (2.48), indicating the lowest graphitization degree of the coke on the catalyst [48].

These deactivated catalysts were further studied by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis to quantify the amount of coke deposition in the propane dehydrogenation. The amount of coke in the spent catalyst after 7 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles is summarized in Table 1. More carbon is found in Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts than those in Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 and Pt-Sn2/θ-Al2O3. The acid center in Al2O3 structure is the active site for propylene polymerization, which leads to the coke formation in these catalysts. Interestingly, a large amount of unsaturated Al3+penta sites does not bring about high acid density in meso-Al2O3 structure, which can be directly proved from Py-IR analysis (Table S4). Therefore, the high level of carbon deposition in Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts is mainly due to high activity in these catalysts. Thus, it can be inferred that the loss of activity in Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalyst is mainly due to the carbon deposition, and the loss of activity in Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 and Pt-Sn2/θ-Al2O3 is mainly attributed to the sintering of Pt particles.

The microstructure of the spent Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 and Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 after 7 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles were examined by different characterization techniques. The Pt-Sn2 cluster about 0.8 nm are still well dispersed at the surface of meso-Al2O3-600, and no evident agglomeration is detected in the STEM characterization (Fig. 10). The bimetallic structure of Pt-Sn2 cluster is still well kept, and there is no segregated Pt and Sn oxide observable in EDS analysis of the spent catalyst (Fig. S10). Also, no diffraction peak related to bulk Pt and Sn structure is detectable in the XRD of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 after regeneration (Fig. S11). Moreover, the IR spectra of the CO adsorption suggests that there is no bridge type of CO adsorption, and thus the bimetallic structure of Pt-Sn2 cluster remains unchanged (Fig. S12). On the contrary, a serious sintering of Pt particle takes place in the spent Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The Pt particle in the spent Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 is much bigger than that in the fresh Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 (Fig. S13). A high level of heterogeneity in Pt particle is observed in Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3, and big nanoparticles about 5.28 ± 0.50 nm and a few large Pt aggregates above 10 nm are observed in this sample. Thus, it can be concluded that Pt-Sn2 clusters at the surface of γ-Al2O3 are not stable, which leads to a growth of these clusters at the high reaction temperature.

The Al3+penta site is believed to be the anchoring site for localizing the Pt-Sn2 clusters, a strong Pt-O-Al3+penta bond could be formed in the structure of the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts. The formation of Pt-O-Al3+penta bond could be confirmed from the 27Al MAS NMR measurement. As shown in Fig. S14, when Pt specie is loaded into meso-Al2O3 sample, the concentration of Al3+penta site decreases from 51.7% to 43.1%. It strongly suggests that Pt atoms are bonded to Al3+penta site for the generation of Pt-O-Al (Al3+penta site) structure, which leads to an evident consumption of Al3+penta site when Pt is loaded into meso-Al2O3. The H2-TPR record on different Pt/Al2O3 samples (Pt/meso-Al2O3-600, Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/θ-Al2O3) further proves that there is an enhanced interaction between Pt species and meso-Al2O3 (Fig. S15). The reduction temperature of PtOx in Pt/meso-Al2O3 is higher than those in Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/θ-Al2O3 samples, which gives an indirect proof that a Pt-O-Al linkage exists in Pt/meso-Al2O3 sample. On the contrary, the reduction temperature of SnOx in meso-Al2O3-600 is similar to those in Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/θ-Al2O3 samples, which suggested that there is no enhanced interaction between SnOx and meso-Al2O3-600 (Fig. S16). The XPS measurement on Sn3d band energy was recorded on the meso-Al2O3-600 catalyst (Fig. S17), and the adsorption band can be assigned to the metallic Sn, Sn(II), and Sn(IV) species, respectively. The metallic Sn is incorporated into Pt particles, which lead to the formation of a Pt-Sn bimetallic cluster. The Sn(II) and Sn(IV) could be ascribed to the Sn atom weakly bonded into Al2O3 support. On a basis of discussion above, it can be inferred that the high stability of Pt-Sn cluster on meso-Al2O3-600 is mainly ascribed to the interaction between Pt species and meso-Al2O3-600.
The stability of Al3+penta structure under the harsh dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle is of importance to localize the Pt-Sn2 clusters, and therefore the 27Al NMR measurement was recorded on the spent Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 (Fig. 11). It is interesting that the Al3+penta structure has a good thermal stability, and the concentration of Al3+penta site is still kept at a high level (46.2% before reaction versus 43.5% after reaction) after 7 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a regenerable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation is developed via loading the Pt-Sn2 clusters onto highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3. The Pt-Sn clusters about 1 nm are highly dispersed at the surface of meso-Al2O3 support, and Pt species have a strong interaction with the Al3+penta sites probably via an Al-O-Pt bond, which allows Pt-Sn2 clusters to be firmly anchored in the structure of mesoporous Al2O3. In the propane dehydrogenation reaction, the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts developed in this study display high propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity above 98% at 570 °C. More inspiringly, these ultra-small Pt-Sn2 clusters have high stability in the harsh reaction condition. The regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalyst depends on the concentration of Al3+penta site in the structure, and the catalytic performance of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 with the highest level of Al3+penta (50.8%) can be fully restored in the dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles by a simple calcination treatment.
