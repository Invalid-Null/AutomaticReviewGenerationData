<quotes>
[1] "Pt-Sn clusters anchored at Al3+penta sites as a sinter-resistant and regenerable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation"

[2] "The Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts developed in this study display high propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity above 98% at 570 C."

[3] "The regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalyst depends on the concentration of Al3+penta site in the structure, and the catalytic performance of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 with the highest level of Al3+penta (50.8%) can be fully restored in the dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles by a simple calcination treatment."
