Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It fabricates highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters. The catalysts are synthesized by a simple co-impregnation method with 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.6 wt% Sn at a Pt/Sn ratio of 1/2.

[1] "HAADF-STEM characterization was carried out on a typical Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 sample to know the morphology of mesoporous Al2O3 and Pt dispersion (Fig. 4)." (Section 2.2)

[2] "The highly dispersed Pt-Sn clusters are distinguishable in the HAADF-STEM images, and these clusters with an average size of 0.70 nm have no well-defined morphology." (Section 2.2)

[3] "The microstructure of the spent Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 and Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 after 7 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles were examined by different characterization techniques." (Section 3)

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques, specifically HAADF-STEM, to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses HAADF-STEM to determine the morphology of mesoporous Al2O3 supports and the dispersion of Pt-Sn clusters, finding highly dispersed Pt-Sn clusters around 0.7 nm in size. It also examines the microstructure of spent catalysts after cycling using microscopy techniques.
