[1] "Pt clusters below 2 nm are frequently used in the propane dehydrogenation [11], [12], [13], [14]. The bulk Pt metal has a melting temperature of up to 1772 C, but Pt particle melting temperature decreases to 405 C when its size reduces to 1.5 nm [15]."

[2] "The Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 with the highest level of Al3+penta (50.8%) delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which exhibits propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity above 98% at 570 C with 10 vol% C3H8 and 10 vol% H2 feed."

[3] "A high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."

[2] "In summary, a regenerable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation is developed via loading the Pt-Sn2 clusters onto highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3. The Pt-Sn clusters about 1 nm are highly dispersed at the surface of meso-Al2O3 support, and Pt species have a strong interaction with the Al3+penta sites probably via an Al-O-Pt bond, which allows Pt-Sn2 clusters to be firmly anchored in the structure of mesoporous Al2O3."

In fact, the meso-Al2O3-600 possesses a two-dimensional pore architecture, because the ordered hexagonal arrangement of pores and alignment of cylindrical pores can be observed along [0 0 1] and [1 1 0] directions, respectively. The highly dispersed Pt-Sn clusters are distinguishable in the HAADF-STEM images, and these clusters with an average size of 0.70 nm have no well-defined morphology. A further CO chemisorption measurement (Table S3) shows that the dispersity of Pt in this sample is 67.2%, suggesting that most Pt atoms are exposed on the surface."
