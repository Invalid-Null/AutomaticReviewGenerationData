 Unfortunately, the given literature does not contain any relevant information to directly answer the questions asked. The article focuses on the development of a regenerable Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation but does not provide background details on the importance and applications of propylene, mechanisms of catalyst activity, major catalyst classes explored, thermodynamic and kinetic factors, DFT calculations, microkinetic modeling, or structure-activity relationships. As the questions seek insights beyond the scope of this particular study, I cannot provide any relevant quotes or answers from the given text.
