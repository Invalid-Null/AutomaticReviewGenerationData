[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation reaction for the production of propylene."

[2] "The Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst has been successfully commercialized in propane dehydrogenation known as Oleflex process developed by the UOP company."

[3] "In this study, we investigate the impact of the structure of different Al2O3 supports on the stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation, and the structure-stability-regenerability relationship was elucidated."

[4] "0.5 wt% Pt and 0.6 wt% Sn (Pt/Sn atomic ratio of 1/2) were synthesized by a simple co-impregnation method." 

[5] "The Pt-Sn2 clusters about 1 nm are highly dispersed at the surface of meso-Al2O3 support, and Pt species have a strong interaction with the Al3+penta sites probably via an Al-O-Pt bond, which allows Pt-Sn2 clusters to be firmly anchored in the structure of mesoporous Al2O3."
