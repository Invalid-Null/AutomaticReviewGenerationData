[1] "Pt clusters below 2 nm are frequently used in the propane dehydrogenation [11], [12], [13], [14]. The bulk Pt metal has a melting temperature of up to 1772 C, but Pt particle melting temperature decreases to 405 C when its size reduces to 1.5 nm [15]."

[2] "In summary, a regenerable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation is developed via loading the Pt-Sn2 clusters onto highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3. The Pt-Sn clusters about 1 nm are highly dispersed at the surface of meso-Al2O3 support, and Pt species have a strong interaction with the Al3+penta sites probably via an Al-O-Pt bond, which allows Pt-Sn2 clusters to be firmly anchored in the structure of mesoporous Al2O3."

[3] "HAADF-STEM characterization was carried out on a typical Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 sample to know the morphology of mesoporous Al2O3 and Pt dispersion (Fig. 4). In fact, the meso-Al2O3-600 possesses a two-dimensional pore architecture, because the ordered hexagonal arrangement of pores and alignment of cylindrical pores can be observed along [0 0 1] and [1 1 0] directions, respectively. The highly dispersed Pt-Sn clusters are distinguishable in the HAADF-STEM images, and these clusters with an average size of 0.70 nm have no well-defined morphology. A further CO chemisorption measurement (Table S3) shows that the dispersity of Pt in this sample is 67.2%, suggesting that most Pt atoms are exposed on the surface."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it utilizes ultra-small Pt-Sn clusters of around 1 nm size to achieve high dispersion on the mesoporous Al2O3 support. STEM imaging and CO chemisorption data confirm the high dispersion, with an average Pt-Sn cluster size of 0.7 nm and 67.2% Pt dispersion.

[2] "The microstructure of the spent Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 and Pt-Sn2/γ-Al2O3 after 7 dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles were examined by different characterization techniques. The Pt-Sn2 cluster about 0.8 nm are still well dispersed at the surface of meso-Al2O3-600, and no evident agglomeration is detected in the STEM characterization (Fig. 10). The bimetallic structure of Pt-Sn2 cluster is still well kept, and there is no segregated Pt and Sn oxide observable in EDS analysis of the spent catalyst (Fig. S10)."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses HAADF-STEM imaging to examine the morphology and dispersion of sub-nanometer Pt-Sn clusters on the mesoporous Al2O3 support, both before and after reaction. The images reveal highly dispersed 0.7-0.8 nm clusters with no evident agglomeration after cycling.
