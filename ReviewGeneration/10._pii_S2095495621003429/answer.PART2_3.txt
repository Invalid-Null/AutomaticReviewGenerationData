<quotes>
[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation reaction for the production of propylene."

[2] "The Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst has been successfully commercialized in propane dehydrogenation known as Oleflex process developed by the UOP company."

[3] "In this study, we investigate the impact of the structure of different Al2O3 supports on the stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation, and the structure-stability-regenerability relationship was elucidated."

[4] "0.5 wt% Pt and 0.6 wt% Sn (Pt/Sn atomic ratio of 1/2) were synthesized by a simple co-impregnation method." 

[5] "The Pt-Sn2 clusters about 1 nm are highly dispersed at the surface of meso-Al2O3 support, and Pt species have a strong interaction with the Al3+penta sites probably via an Al-O-Pt bond, which allows Pt-Sn2 clusters to be firmly anchored in the structure of mesoporous Al2O3."

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It mentions that Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used commercially for propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The article investigates the stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2 clusters on various Al2O3 supports. The Pt-Sn2 catalysts were prepared with 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.6 wt% Sn by co-impregnation. The sub-nm Pt-Sn2 clusters showed high stability when anchored on mesoporous Al2O3, attributed to strong metal-support interactions.

2. 是的,本文评估了用于丙烷脱氢的Pt-Sn双金属催化剂。它提到Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂被广泛用于商业丙烷脱氢制丙烯中。本文研究了Pt-Sn2簇合物在各种Al2O3载体上的稳定性和再生能力。该Pt-Sn2催化剂是通过共淋洗法制备的,Pt含量为0.5 wt%,Sn含量为0.6 wt%。次纳米Pt-Sn2簇合物在介孔Al2O3上的稳定性很高,这是由于强的金属与载体间相互作用。
