[1] "We have investigated the mechanism and kinetics of propane dehydrogenation over oxidized and reduced α-Cr2O3(0001), which yields primarily propene and CO2."

[2] "On the oxidized surface, the reaction energy for the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen is 3.40 eV, while on the reduced surface, it is only 0.85 eV." 

[3] "Similarly, unsaturated C3 and C2 hydrocarbons have interaction strengths of 3-4 eV with the oxidized surface and 0.30-0.60 eV with the reduced surface."

[4] "The difference stems from electronic effects, i.e. surface basicity and nucleophilicity, as the oxidized surface exposes oxygen atoms with a Bader charge of -0.68e, while the exposed Cr atoms on the reduced surface have a positive charge (+1.56e)."

[5] "As a consequence, the reaction mechanism is fundamentally different."

[6] "This is to be expected from the stoichiometry alone as H2O is the co-product in the oxidative environment and H2 in the reducing environment."

[7] "In the former case, dehydrogenation steps are exothermic with low activation barriers (generally below 1.0 eV), while the reduced surface exhibits higher barriers (typically 1-2 eV) and the steps are generally endothermic." 

[8] "Cracking reactions follow a similar trend, i.e. being much more likely on the oxidized surface."

[9] "Dehydrogenation over the oxidized surface follows the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism." 

[10] "Hydrogen atoms that shed off the hydrocarbons are picked up by integral surface oxygen atoms, which desorb in the form of water."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of the metal oxide Cr2O3 affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It studies the reduced and oxidized Cr2O3(0001) surfaces, showing the oxidized surface has higher affinity for unsaturated hydrocarbons and hydrogen due to its basicity and nucleophilicity. This leads to exothermic dehydrogenation with lower barriers on the oxidized surface, following a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involving surface oxygen, compared to endothermic dehydrogenation with higher barriers on the reduced surface. The oxidized surface also exhibits more cracking activity.

答:是的,该文研究了调节金属氧化物Cr2O3的氧化态、氧的迁移性以及酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它研究了Cr2O3(0001)的还原态和氧化态表面,显示氧化态表面由于其碱性和亲核性,对不饱和碳氢化合物和氢的亲和力更大。这导致氧化态表面上的脱氢反应更加放热,活化能较低,遵循Mars-van Krevelen机制,涉及表面氧,而还原态表面上的脱氢反应则是吸热的,活化能较高。氧化态表面也表现出更高的裂解活性。

[1] "While saturated hydrocarbons and molecular hydrogen only physisorb on both surfaces, unsaturated intermediates bind much more strongly on the oxidized surface."

[2] "On the oxidized surface, the reaction proceeds rapidly on the oxidized surface. Due to very low barriers (EA = 0.19 and 0.11 eV), both CH3CH2CH2 and CH3CHCH3 form." 

[3] "On the reduced surface, the barriers are much higher but nearly identical (EA = 1.25 and 1.27 eV), meaning both intermediates also form, albeit much more slowly."

[4] "However, on the reduced surface, CH3CHCH3 is more susceptible to further dehydrogenation (EA = 0.84 eV), yielding propene."

[5] "On the oxidized surface, CH3CHCH3 is dehydrogenated to propene (EA = 0.69 eV), as expected, while CH3CH2CH2 undergoes deep dehydrogenation and yields CH3CH2CH instead (EA = 0.55 eV)."

[6] "On the reduced surface, propene converts to propyne via CH3CCH2 (EA = 1.22 and 1.31 eV). On the oxidized surface, CH3CH2CH is dehydrogenated to CH3CHCH (EA = 0.21 eV) and propyne (EA = 0.96 eV), while propene yields propyne via CH3CCH2 (EA = 0.23 and 0.83 eV)."

Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied Cr2O3 catalysts. It describes specific reaction steps and intermediates involved in converting propane to propene and propyne over the reduced and oxidized Cr2O3(0001) surfaces. On the oxidized surface, propane rapidly forms propene and propyne intermediates which dehydrogenate further, while on the reduced surface the initial propane activation barriers are higher but it selectively dehydrogenates to propene. Specific activation barriers for each step are provided.
