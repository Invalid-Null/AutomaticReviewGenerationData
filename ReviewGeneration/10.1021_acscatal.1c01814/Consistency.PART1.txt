I parsed the correct answers and each comparative answer file to extract the relevant English responses. I compared these responses to calculate a consistency percentage for each question and answer file pairing, which estimates how consistent that file's response is with the correct answer. The percentage is based on semantic similarity of the content. Let me know if you have any other questions!
