[1] "By utilizing propane as a feedstock, which represents a more prudent use than burning it as fuel, hydrogen is produced when the process is carried out non-oxidatively." 

[2] "The reaction presents an alternative to conventional processes based on petroleum resources."

[3] "Propane is a rather inert compound (a heat of formation of 104 kJ mol−1) with stable CH bonds (bond-dissociation energy of 410−420 kJ mol−1), requiring high temperatures and pressures for activation."

[4] "To steer the reaction toward propene and avoid extensive cracking (non-oxidative) or oxidation (oxidative), appropriate catalysts must be used."

[5] "This work investigate theoretically how Cr2O3 catalyzes this reaction in oxidative and reducing environments." 

[6] "Using density functional theory with the Hubbard correction...parameters describing adsorption, desorption, and surface reactions are used in a kinetic Monte Carlo simulation, which employed industrially relevant conditions (700–900 K, pressures up to 2 bar, and varying oxidants: N2O, O2, and none)."

[7] "We observe that over the reduced surface, propene and hydrogen form with high selectivity. When oxidants are used, the surface is oxidized, which changes the reaction mechanism and kinetics." 

[8] "The complete reaction pathway for propane dehydrogenation, including CC cracking, formation of side products (propyne, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, and methane), and catalyst coking on oxidized and reduced surfaces of α-Cr2O3(0001), is calculated using density functional theory with the Hubbard correction."

[11] "The use of chromia dates back to the 1930s, while the first commercial technology was the Pacol process from 1968, using alumina-supported platinum catalysts."

1. The article explains that propane dehydrogenation provides an alternative route to produce propylene from propane feedstock rather than from petroleum sources. It notes that propane is relatively inert and requires high temperatures and pressures to activate. 

2. The article describes how catalysts like Cr2O3 lower the activation barriers and facilitate propane dehydrogenation under milder conditions. It calculates reaction parameters using DFT to model the mechanisms.

3. The article briefly mentions alumina-supported Pt catalysts used in commercial Pacol process starting in 1968, but does not introduce other catalyst classes explored for this reaction.

4. The article discusses the high temperatures needed to activate propane bonds and steer the reaction towards propylene while avoiding cracking or oxidation. It provides quantitative energetics from DFT calculations.

5. The article uses DFT calculations to model the full reaction pathway and mechanisms of propane dehydrogenation over Cr2O3 under varying conditions.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics. 

7. The article does not identify any structure-activity relationships or descriptors correlating catalyst properties to performance.
