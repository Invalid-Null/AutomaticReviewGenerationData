[1] "To steer the reaction toward propene and avoid extensive cracking (non-oxidative) or oxidation (oxidative), appropriate catalysts must be used."

[2] "In addition to the experimentally (1216) and theoretically well-researched alumina-supported Pt/Sn catalysts, which underpin the CATOFIN process and operate at 500700 C and 24 bar, chromia-based catalysts are also used extensively."

[3] "Chromium oxide was used for ethylene polymerization."

[4] "Zhang et al. investigated the SBA-15-supported chromia." 

[5] "Chang et al. showed that doping with Pt improves the performance of α-Cr2O3(0001) and ZnO(1010)."

[6] "We have investigated the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on the reduced α-Cr2O3(0001) surface using kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) on DFT-obtained data (28) and butane dehydrogenation in an idealized plug flow reactor using DFT-fed microkinetic modeling."

[7] "In this work, we investigated theoretically how Cr2O3 catalyzes this reaction in oxidative and reducing environments."

[8] "Although previous studies showed that the reduced catalyst is selective for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, real operating conditions are oxidative."  

[9] "Herein, we use multiscale modeling to investigate the difference between the oxidized and reduced catalyst and their performance."

[10] "Dehydrogenations are exothermic and kinetically more accessible on the oxidized surface and endothermic with higher barriers on the reduced surface."

[11] "On the oxidized surface, dehydrogenation steps are exothermic with low activation barriers (generally below 1.0 eV), while the reduced surface exhibits higher barriers (typically 1-2 eV) and the steps are generally endothermic."

[12] "On the oxidized surface, the reaction energy for the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen is 3.40 eV, while on the reduced surface, it is only 0.85 eV." 

[13] "Similarly, unsaturated C3 and C2 hydrocarbons have interaction strengths of 3-4 eV with the oxidized surface and 0.3-0.6 eV with the reduced surface."

[14] "The difference stems from electronic effects, that is, surface basicity and nucleophilicity, as the oxidized surface exposes oxygen atoms with a Bader charge of 0.68e0, while the exposed Cr atoms on the reduced surface have a positive charge (+1.56e0)."

[15] "Using multiscale modeling, we demonstrate a Goldilocks effect. For optimum conversion of propane to propene, the surface should be partially oxidized."

[16] "Additionally, the selectivity and activity were strongly dependent on the oxidant and propane pressure and oxidant type." 

[17] "Further investigation of surfaces with varying degrees of oxidation showed that there exists an optimum degree of surface oxidation, which is 0.2 when using O2 and 0.5 when using N2O."

<English version answer>

1. Yes, the article evaluates chromia (Cr2O3) catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on the performance of reduced vs oxidized Cr2O3 surfaces, showing the oxidized surface is more active but less selective. It also shows doping Cr2O3 with Pt improves performance.

2. Yes, the article investigates tuning the oxidation state of chromia to affect propane dehydrogenation. It shows the oxidized surface has lower dehydrogenation barriers and stronger adsorbate binding vs the reduced surface. There is an optimal degree of surface oxidation around 0.2-0.5. 

3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic pathway for propane dehydrogenation over Cr2O3. It describes dehydrogenation steps to propene and propylene, with the oxidized surface favoring exothermic pathways with lower barriers.  

4. No, the article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts.

5. No, the article does not evaluate supported mono-metallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

6. No, the article does not investigate properties like particle size and support interactions for supported metal catalysts.

7. No, the article does not propose mechanistic pathways over supported metal catalysts.
