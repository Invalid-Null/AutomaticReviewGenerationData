      [1] "Chromium oxide was used for ethylene polymerization."

      [2] "Zhang et al. investigated the SBA-15-supported chromia."

      [3] "Chang et al. showed that doping with Pt improves the performance of α-Cr2O3(0001) and ZnO(1010)."

      [4] "We have investigated the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on the reduced α-Cr2O3(0001) surface using kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) on DFT-obtained data (28) and butane dehydrogenation in an idealized plug flow reactor using DFT-fed microkinetic modeling."

      The article evaluates chromia (Cr2O3) catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on doping Cr2O3 with Pt to improve performance. The reduced and oxidized α-Cr2O3(0001) surfaces are investigated using DFT calculations. Kinetic Monte Carlo and microkinetic modeling are used to study propane and butane dehydrogenation on Cr2O3.

      [1] "On the oxidized surface, the reaction energy for the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen is 3.40 eV, while on the reduced surface, it is only 0.85 eV."

      [2] "Similarly, unsaturated C3 and C2 hydrocarbons have interaction strengths of 3-4 eV with the oxidized surface and 0.30-0.60 eV with the reduced surface." 

      [3] "The difference stems from electronic effects, i.e. surface basicity and nucleophilicity, as the oxidized surface exposes oxygen atoms with a Bader charge of -0.68e, while the exposed Cr atoms on the reduced surface have a positive charge (+1.56e)."

      [4] "As a consequence, the reaction mechanism is fundamentally different."

      [5] "In the former case, dehydrogenation steps are exothermic with low activation barriers (generally below 1.0 eV), while the reduced surface exhibits higher barriers (typically 1-2 eV) and the steps are generally endothermic."

    <English>
      The article investigates tuning the oxidation state of Cr2O3 to affect propane dehydrogenation. The oxidized surface interacts more strongly with hydrogen and unsaturated hydrocarbons due to its higher basicity/nucleophilicity. This leads to exothermic dehydrogenation with lower barriers on the oxidized surface compared to endothermic dehydrogenation with higher barriers on the reduced surface.

      该文研究了调节Cr2O3的氧化态以影响丙烷脱氢。氧化态表面由于具有更高的碱性/亲核性,与氢和不饱和碳氢化合物的相互作用更强。这导致氧化态表面上的脱氢反应更加放热,活化能较低,而还原态表面上的脱氢反应则为吸热的,活化能较高。

      [1] "Dehydrogenation over the oxidized surface follows the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism."
      
      [2] "Hydrogen atoms that shed off the hydrocarbons are picked up by integral surface oxygen atoms, which desorb in the form of water."

      [3] "The ensuing surface oxygen vacancy corresponds to the reduced site. These are replenished with N2O, which heals one vacancy and yields N2, or O2, which donates two oxygen atoms."
    </Quotes>
    
    <English>
      The article proposes a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for propane dehydrogenation on the oxidized Cr2O3 surface. Surface oxygen picks up hydrogen from hydrocarbons to form water, leaving an oxygen vacancy. The vacancy can be replenished by N2O or O2.
