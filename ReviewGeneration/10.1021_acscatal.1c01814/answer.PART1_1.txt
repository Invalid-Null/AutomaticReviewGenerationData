[1] "Purely first-principles theoretical descriptions of chromia-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation remain scarce."

[2] "In this work, we investigate theoretically how Cr2O3 catalyzes this reaction in oxidative and reducing environments."

[3] "Herein, we use multiscale modeling to investigate the difference between the oxidized and reduced catalyst and their performance."

[4] "The complete reaction pathway for propane dehydrogenation, including CC cracking, formation of side products (propyne, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, and methane), and catalyst coking on oxidized and reduced surfaces of α-Cr2O3(0001), is calculated using density functional theory with the Hubbard correction."

[5] "We observe that over the reduced surface, propene and hydrogen form with high selectivity. When oxidants are used, the surface is oxidized, which changes the reaction mechanism and kinetics." 

[6] "It is shown that the oxidized surface is much more active but prone to the formation of CO2, while the reduced surface is less active but highly selective toward propene."

[7] "Moreover, the effect of the oxidant used is investigated, showing that N2O is preferred to O2 due to higher selectivity and less catalyst coking."

[8] "We show that there exists an optimum degree of surface oxidation, where the yield of propene is maximized."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of Cr2O3 affects propane dehydrogenation performance. The article calculates complete reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over oxidized and reduced Cr2O3 surfaces using DFT. It shows the oxidized surface is more active but prone to CO2 formation, while the reduced surface is less active but more selective for propene. The effect of oxidants like O2 and N2O is explored, with N2O giving higher selectivity and less coking. An optimum degree of surface oxidation is found where propene yield is maximized.

Answer: 是的,该文章研究了如何调节Cr2O3的氧化状态、氧的迁移性和酸碱性以影响丙烷脱氢性能。该文章使用DFT计算了氧化和还原Cr2O3表面上的完整丙烷脱氢反应途径。它表明氧化表面活性更高但易生成CO2,而还原表面活性较低但更选择性地生成丙烯。探讨了O2和N2O等氧化剂的效果,N2O给出更高的选择性和更少的焦炭生成。找到了一个优化的表面氧化度,其中丙烯产率最大化。

[1] "Already in 1977 Suzuki and Kaneko proposed a macrokinetic model." 

[2] "Our calculations also showed that this further reducing of the reduced surface is energetically not favorable as the formation energy of such a vacancy is +4.07 eV (with respect to 1/2O2)."

[3] "Dehydrogenation over the oxidized surface follows the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Hydrogen atoms that shed off the hydrocarbons are picked up by integral surface oxygen atoms, which desorb in the form of water." 

[4] "The ensuing surface oxygen vacancy corresponds to the reduced site. These are replenished with N2O, which heals one vacancy and yields N2, or O2, which donates two oxygen atoms."

[5] "While both reactions are exothermic, N2O functions as a soft oxidant with a higher barrier. O2, however, first adsorbs without a barrier in a strongly exothermic step and then readily dissociates, making it a strong oxidant."

[6] "In the former case, dehydrogenation steps are exothermic with low activation barriers (generally below 1.0 eV), while the reduced surface exhibits higher barriers (typically 1‒2 eV) and the steps are generally endothermic."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over Cr2O3. It describes a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism on the oxidized surface, where surface oxygen picks up hydrogen to form water, leaving an oxygen vacancy that can be replenished by N2O or O2. On the reduced surface, dehydrogenation steps are endothermic with higher barriers. O2 is a stronger oxidant than N2O. Specific reaction steps, intermediates, and active sites like chromyl oxygen and chromium atoms are described.

Answer: 是的,该文提出了Cr2O3上的丙烷脱氢的机理场景。它描述了氧化表面上的Mars-van Krevelen机理,表面氧摄取氢形成水,留下氧空位,可以通过N2O或O2补充。在还原表面上,脱氢步骤为吸热的,活化栏垒更高。O2比N2O是一个更强的氧化剂。文中具体描述了类似铬基氧和铬原子等反应步骤、中间体和活性位点。
