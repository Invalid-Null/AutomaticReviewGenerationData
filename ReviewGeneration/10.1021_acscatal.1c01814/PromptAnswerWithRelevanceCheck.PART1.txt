 Here are the relevant quotes and answers:

<quotes>
[1] "To steer the reaction toward propene and avoid extensive cracking (non-oxidative) or oxidation (oxidative), appropriate catalysts must be used."

[2] "In addition to the experimentally (1216) and theoretically well-researched alumina-supported Pt/Sn catalysts, which underpin the CATOFIN process and operate at 500700 C and 24 bar, chromia-based catalysts are also used extensively."

[3] "Chromium oxide was used for ethylene polymerization."

[4] "Zhang et al. investigated the SBA-15-supported chromia." 

[5] "Chang et al. showed that doping with Pt improves the performance of α-Cr2O3(0001) and ZnO(1010)."

[6] "We have investigated the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on the reduced α-Cr2O3(0001) surface using kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) on DFT-obtained data (28) and butane dehydrogenation in an idealized plug flow reactor using DFT-fed microkinetic modeling."

[7] "In this work, we investigated theoretically how Cr2O3 catalyzes this reaction in oxidative and reducing environments."

[8] "Although previous studies showed that the reduced catalyst is selective for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, real operating conditions are oxidative."  

[9] "Herein, we use multiscale modeling to investigate the difference between the oxidized and reduced catalyst and their performance."

[10] "Dehydrogenations are exothermic and kinetically more accessible on the oxidized surface and endothermic with higher barriers on the reduced surface."

[11] "On the oxidized surface, dehydrogenation steps are exothermic with low activation barriers (generally below 1.0 eV), while the reduced surface exhibits higher barriers (typically 1-2 eV) and the steps are generally endothermic."

[12] "On the oxidized surface, the reaction energy for the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen is 3.40 eV, while on the reduced surface, it is only 0.85 eV." 

[13] "Similarly, unsaturated C3 and C2 hydrocarbons have interaction strengths of 3-4 eV with the oxidized surface and 0.3-0.6 eV with the reduced surface."

[14] "The difference stems from electronic effects, that is, surface basicity and nucleophilicity, as the oxidized surface exposes oxygen atoms with a Bader charge of 0.68e0, while the exposed Cr atoms on the reduced surface have a positive charge (+1.56e0)."

[15] "Using multiscale modeling, we demonstrate a Goldilocks effect. For optimum conversion of propane to propene, the surface should be partially oxidized."

[16] "Additionally, the selectivity and activity were strongly dependent on the oxidant and propane pressure and oxidant type." 

[17] "Further investigation of surfaces with varying degrees of oxidation showed that there exists an optimum degree of surface oxidation, which is 0.2 when using O2 and 0.5 when using N2O."

[1] "Purely first-principles theoretical descriptions of chromia-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation remain scarce."

[2] "In this work, we investigate theoretically how Cr2O3 catalyzes this reaction in oxidative and reducing environments."

[3] "Herein, we use multiscale modeling to investigate the difference between the oxidized and reduced catalyst and their performance."

[4] "The complete reaction pathway for propane dehydrogenation, including CC cracking, formation of side products (propyne, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, and methane), and catalyst coking on oxidized and reduced surfaces of α-Cr2O3(0001), is calculated using density functional theory with the Hubbard correction."

[5] "We observe that over the reduced surface, propene and hydrogen form with high selectivity. When oxidants are used, the surface is oxidized, which changes the reaction mechanism and kinetics." 

[6] "It is shown that the oxidized surface is much more active but prone to the formation of CO2, while the reduced surface is less active but highly selective toward propene."

[7] "Moreover, the effect of the oxidant used is investigated, showing that N2O is preferred to O2 due to higher selectivity and less catalyst coking."

[8] "We show that there exists an optimum degree of surface oxidation, where the yield of propene is maximized."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of Cr2O3 affects propane dehydrogenation performance. The article calculates complete reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over oxidized and reduced Cr2O3 surfaces using DFT. It shows the oxidized surface is more active but prone to CO2 formation, while the reduced surface is less active but more selective for propene. The effect of oxidants like O2 and N2O is explored, with N2O giving higher selectivity and less coking. An optimum degree of surface oxidation is found where propene yield is maximized.

[1] "Already in 1977 Suzuki and Kaneko proposed a macrokinetic model." 

[2] "Our calculations also showed that this further reducing of the reduced surface is energetically not favorable as the formation energy of such a vacancy is +4.07 eV (with respect to 1/2O2)."

[3] "Dehydrogenation over the oxidized surface follows the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Hydrogen atoms that shed off the hydrocarbons are picked up by integral surface oxygen atoms, which desorb in the form of water." 

[4] "The ensuing surface oxygen vacancy corresponds to the reduced site. These are replenished with N2O, which heals one vacancy and yields N2, or O2, which donates two oxygen atoms."

[5] "While both reactions are exothermic, N2O functions as a soft oxidant with a higher barrier. O2, however, first adsorbs without a barrier in a strongly exothermic step and then readily dissociates, making it a strong oxidant."

[6] "In the former case, dehydrogenation steps are exothermic with low activation barriers (generally below 1.0 eV), while the reduced surface exhibits higher barriers (typically 1‒2 eV) and the steps are generally endothermic."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over Cr2O3. It describes a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism on the oxidized surface, where surface oxygen picks up hydrogen to form water, leaving an oxygen vacancy that can be replenished by N2O or O2. On the reduced surface, dehydrogenation steps are endothermic with higher barriers. O2 is a stronger oxidant than N2O. Specific reaction steps, intermediates, and active sites like chromyl oxygen and chromium atoms are described.

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,该文提出了Cr2O3上的丙烷脱氢的机理场景。它描述了氧化表面上的Mars-van Krevelen机理,表面氧摄取氢形成水,留下氧空位,可以通过N2O或O2补充。在还原表面上,脱氢步骤为吸热的,活化栏垒更高。O2比N2O是一个更强的氧化剂。文中具体描述了类似铬基氧和铬原子等反应步骤、中间体和活性位点。

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of the metal oxide Cr2O3 affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It studies the reduced and oxidized Cr2O3(0001) surfaces, showing the oxidized surface has higher affinity for unsaturated hydrocarbons and hydrogen due to its basicity and nucleophilicity. This leads to exothermic dehydrogenation with lower barriers on the oxidized surface, following a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involving surface oxygen, compared to endothermic dehydrogenation with higher barriers on the reduced surface. The oxidized surface also exhibits more cracking activity.

答:是的,该文研究了调节金属氧化物Cr2O3的氧化态、氧的迁移性以及酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它研究了Cr2O3(0001)的还原态和氧化态表面,显示氧化态表面由于其碱性和亲核性,对不饱和碳氢化合物和氢的亲和力更大。这导致氧化态表面上的脱氢反应更加放热,活化能较低,遵循Mars-van Krevelen机制,涉及表面氧,而还原态表面上的脱氢反应则是吸热的,活化能较高。氧化态表面也表现出更高的裂解活性。

[1] "While saturated hydrocarbons and molecular hydrogen only physisorb on both surfaces, unsaturated intermediates bind much more strongly on the oxidized surface."

[2] "On the oxidized surface, the reaction proceeds rapidly on the oxidized surface. Due to very low barriers (EA = 0.19 and 0.11 eV), both CH3CH2CH2 and CH3CHCH3 form." 

[3] "On the reduced surface, the barriers are much higher but nearly identical (EA = 1.25 and 1.27 eV), meaning both intermediates also form, albeit much more slowly."

[4] "However, on the reduced surface, CH3CHCH3 is more susceptible to further dehydrogenation (EA = 0.84 eV), yielding propene."

[5] "On the oxidized surface, CH3CHCH3 is dehydrogenated to propene (EA = 0.69 eV), as expected, while CH3CH2CH2 undergoes deep dehydrogenation and yields CH3CH2CH instead (EA = 0.55 eV)."

[6] "On the reduced surface, propene converts to propyne via CH3CCH2 (EA = 1.22 and 1.31 eV). On the oxidized surface, CH3CH2CH is dehydrogenated to CH3CHCH (EA = 0.21 eV) and propyne (EA = 0.96 eV), while propene yields propyne via CH3CCH2 (EA = 0.23 and 0.83 eV)."

Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied Cr2O3 catalysts. It describes specific reaction steps and intermediates involved in converting propane to propene and propyne over the reduced and oxidized Cr2O3(0001) surfaces.
