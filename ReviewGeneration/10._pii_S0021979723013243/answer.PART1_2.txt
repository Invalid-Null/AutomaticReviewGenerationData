 Unfortunately, this literature does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, propose mechanistic scenarios, explore metal-support interfacial effects, or evaluate supported mono-metallic catalysts for this reaction. The article focuses solely on Pd-Mn3O4 catalysts for complete propane oxidation, not dehydrogenation. Since the questions are completely unrelated to the content of the given literature, I cannot provide any relevant quotes or answers. The literature is not about propane dehydrogenation at all.
