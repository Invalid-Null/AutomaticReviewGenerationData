1. The literature does not provide any background information on the importance of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation is not discussed.

2. The literature does not explain how catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers. Propane dehydrogenation mechanisms are not discussed.

3. The literature does not introduce catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation. Only Pd-Mn3O4 catalysts for propane total oxidation are presented.

4. The literature does not discuss thermodynamic or kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. 

5. The literature does not describe DFT calculations applied to propane dehydrogenation mechanisms. DFT is only used to study propane total oxidation.

6. The literature does not present microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation. 

7. The literature does not identify descriptors correlating catalyst properties to propane dehydrogenation performance. Only propane total oxidation structure-activity relationships are discussed.
