Abstract
Adjusting the interaction between dual active components for enhancing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) degradation is an effective but still challenging means of air pollution control. Herein, a limited pyrolysis oxidation strategy was adopted to prepare Pd-Mn3O4 spinel catalysts with uniform morphology and active component dispersion. Among these, 1.08Pd-Mn3O4 presented the highest catalytic efficiency with a T90 value of 240 C, which was 94 C lower than that of Mn3O4. Characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results revealed that the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect between Pd and Mn3O4 promoted the redistribution of surface charges, thus strengthening the oxidation-reduction ability of the active sites. Moreover, the SMSI effect led to a better migration of surface oxygen species, and boosted the generation of active surface oxygen species. Simultaneously, the Pd catalyst further reduced the energy barrier in the initial stage of the dehydrogenation of propane. Overall, this study provided a novel design strategy for dual active components catalysts with SMSI effect and extended the application of these catalysts in the important field of VOCs elimination.

1. Introduction
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a kind of major atmospheric pollutants with significant environmental and human health impacts [1]. VOCs are a diverse group of substances and originate from a wide range of sources [2]. The main precursors of ozone and particulate matter are short-chain alkanes, represented by propane, which are mainly derived from industrial waste gases and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) carriers [3]. Catalytic oxidation technology is the most widely used and effective method of removing VOCs [4], the key to which lies in designing and applying catalysts [5]. Small amounts of precious metal materials are usually employed in the best catalysts for VOCs removal in current industrial applications [6]. Due to their expensive price, environmental research is currently focused on how to reduce the metal amount used and cost [7].
Among the precious metal catalysts, Pd catalysts have the advantages of relatively cheaper price and higher thermal stability, so that are widely used for the catalytic degradation of VOCs [8]. And the strong metal support interaction (SMSI), that is, the interaction between metal species and the geometric and electronic structure of the support [9], is the key in the heterogeneous catalysis of precious metals, and has attracted extensive attention [10], [11]. Zhan et al. used γ-Al2O3 nanosheets with moderate anchoring sites as a support of Pd, to prepare Pd/Al2O3 nanosheet for propane catalytic combustion [12]. Due to the occurrence of SMSI effect at high temperature, the Pd/Al2O3 nanosheet displayed outstanding catalytic activity and resistance to high temperature. Meanwhile, Pd-based catalysts possessed superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds [13], which was very beneficial for improving the low-temperature catalytic performance of propane [14]. However, research has indicated that the surface state of Pd has a decisive impact on catalytic performance [15]. Therefore, how to adjust the SMSI effect of Pd and carrier is great significance to enhance the activity [16].
Besides, Pd-based catalysts were extremely sensitive to halogens and water vapour [17]. When using supports with weak SMSI effect and poor oxygen activation/migration ability, PdO active site was easily transformed to Pd(OH), resulting in irreversible loss of activity [18]. In comparison with TiO2, CeO2 and other support materials, manganese oxide (MnOx) demonstrated high redox properties and oxygen mobility at low temperatures [19], and has strong SMSI effect with Pd [20]. Among various MnOx, Mn3O4 was quite active, durable and insusceptible to poisoning [21]. Depending on its typical spinel structure, a strong SMSI effect was observed between Pd and Mn3O4 [22]. Mn3O4 could promote the anchoring of Pd particles on the surface, effectively controlling the generation of smaller Pd particles [23]. Simultaneously, the Pd loading greatly improved the reducibility of Mn3O4 catalyst, and the presence of Pd2+ could provide more lattice oxygen for oxidation reactions [24]. Therefore, how to introduce Pd into the Mn3O4 spinel structure is the key to the design of catalytic materials.
Compared with the dispersion-precipitation and solgel methods, the confined pyrolysis oxidation strategy is a more effective means for morphology-controlled synthesis [3]. The preparation of Pd-Mn3O4 spinel catalysts using metal organic framework (MOF) as precursors showed the following benefits [25], [26], [27]. First, due to the metal coordination of Pd as a MOF, the metals of Pd and Mn in the precursor can be uniformly dispersed, which could be inherited by metal oxides. Second, polyhedron frames were easily formed in the metal oxides synthesized through limited pyrolysis oxidation, exhibiting more stable structures. Last, the amorphous carbon produced during pyrolysis was conducive to obtaining catalysts with uniform particle size, and preventing metal agglomeration in oxidation process.
Herein, a controlled pyrolysis oxidation path was used to construct highly dispersed Pd-Mn3O4 catalysts. With bimetallic Pd-Mn-MOF-74 as precursor, the mass ratio of Pd to Mn was effectively regulated to prepare Pd-Mn spinel catalyst with high active site exposure, uniform morphology and desirable active component dispersion. The purpose is to study the effect of Pd doping on the low-temperature catalytic oxidation of propane over Mn3O4 catalyst, and explore the mechanism of the catalyst in the reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation.
All reagents with a purity of analytical reagent (AR) were purchased from Aladdin.
Synthesis of Pd-Mn-MOF-74. In a typical process, under magnetic stirring, x mmol of MnCl2·4H2O, y mmol of C10H16O4Pd (x + y = 6.66), and 0.4 g of 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid were added into a mixed solution of 148.2 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 12 mL of ethanol, and 12 mL of deionized water. After stirring for 1 h, the solution was transferred into a 250 mL hydrothermal reactor for reaction at 135 Cfor 24 h. After the reaction was complete, the product was collected through suction filtration, washing three times with deionized water and ethanol, and finally drying in oven at 80 C for 30 min to obtain the Pd-Mn-MOF-74 precursor (dark brown sample).
Synthesis of Pd-Mn3O4. The synthesized Pd-Mn-MOF-74 was placed into a tube furnace, purged in a N2 flow of 25 mL·min1 for 30 min, then heated up to 600 C for 3 h. After the tube furnace was cooled down to room temperature, N2 was switched to Air for further oxidation at 350 C for 4 h. According to the Pd content measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (Table S1), the samples were named as Mn3O4, 0.50Pd-Mn3O4, 1.08Pd-Mn3O4, 1.91Pd-Mn3O4 and 3.30Pd-Mn3O4, respectively.
2.2. Catalyst characterization.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns was measured by Bruker D8 Advance. The N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherm were evaluated over a Micromeritics ASAP2010 instrument. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded on a Hitachi S-4800 apparatus. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were collected on a JEM-2100UHR instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) patterns were measured on a Shimadzu AXIS SUPRA + electronic energy spectrum. Raman spectra were collected on a ThermoFisher DXR microscope. The Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra was collected on a Bruker A300 spectrometer. H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and O2-temperature programmed desorption (O2-TPD) were performed on a Quantachchrome Chembet Pulsar apparatus with the same pretreatment. In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in-situ DRIFTs) were obtained on a Bruker V80 instrument equipped with an MCT/A detector and a ZnSe in-situ cell. The sample was purged with the feed gas consisting of 2500 μmol/mol C3H8 + Air (25 mL·min1).
2.3. Catalytic activity evaluation.
The photothermal catalytic activity in the total propane was measured using 200 mg of the catalyst (4060 mesh) in a fixed bed reactor, and a thermocouple was placed to contact with the surface of catalyst layer to measure the reaction temperature. The light-driven catalytic oxidation reaction was evaluated by xenon lamp irradiation. The activity was measured at the temperature of 120280 C. A gas with flow rate of 100 mL min1 (weight hourly space velocity (WHSV): 30000 mL·g1·h1) mixture consisted of 2500 ppm C3H8 and air as the balance gas. The inlet and outlet gas was monitored and analyzed online using a Fuli instrument GC-9720 gas chromatograph for VOC detection. The catalytic activities were expressed as propane conversion (%). The C3H8 conversion (XC3H8) and specific surface activity (SSA) were calculated by Eq. (1), (2), respectively.
(1)
(2)
where [C3H8]inlet and [C3H8]outlet are the C3H8 concentrations in the inlet and outlet gas (vol.%), respectively. NC3H8 is the propane flow rate (mol·s1), Wcat is the mass of cobalt oxide in the reactor (g), and SBET represents the specific surface area (m2·g1).
The reaction rate, (rC3H8) and Turnover frequency (TOF) is defined as follows (Eq. (3), (4)):
(3)
(4)
When the extent of conversion of propane is lower than 20%, a dependence of the reaction rate (rC3H8) on the products CO2 and H2O can be ignored. Therefore, Vas is the concentration of the active sites on the surface obtained by analyzing the results obtained using CO chemical adsorption technique.
2.4. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation details.
All the DFT calculations were performed by using Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [28]. Spin-polarised calculations were performed using the generalised gradient approximation with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) method to describe the exchange and correlation energy in all the calculations. For geometry optimisation, forces were converged below 0.03 eV/Å, and the self-consistent field convergence energy was 1 × 10-5 Ha an energy cutoff of 400 eV was used for basis-set expansion. A 1 × 1 × 1 k-point mesh was used in all the calculations.
For the calculation of oxygen vacancy formation energy, the slab model surfaces of Mn3O4 were developed. A p (2 × 2) unit cell expansion was used for modelling. A vacuum of 15 Å was used to simulate the surface under the periodic boundary condition.
The adsorption energy (Eads) of the adsorbed molecule on the surface was calculated as Eq. (5):
(5)
where Esurface is the clean surface relaxation energy of the surface slab, Egas is the energy of free gas molecules in the vacuum, and Eadsorbate+surface is the energy of the composite system. Because the calculations were performed at 0 K and fixed cell volume, the differences in Gibbs free energy should be equal to the differences in the total energy. Thus, a negative value of Eads corresponds to exothermic and spontaneous adsorption.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Textural characteristics.
The XRD patterns of Pd-Mn-MOF-74 (Fig. S1) and Pd-Mn3O4 (Fig. S2) were measured to analyse the crystalline structure. The diffraction peaks of Pd-Mn-MOF-74 were corresponded to those of Mn-MOF-74 and simulated Mn-MOF-74, indicating the successfully dispersion of Pd in MOF structure [29]. After limited pyrolysis oxidation, the obtained Pd-Mn3O4 displayed a typical Mn3O4 spinel structure (PDF#800382) [30]. The diffraction peaks appearing at 18.0, 29.0, 32.5, and 36.1 in the XRD patterns were ascribed to the (1 0 1), (1 1 2), (1 0 3), and (2 1 1) crystal planes of Mn3O4, respectively. Meanwhile, the calculated lattice parameters and grain sizes (Table S1) did not vary significantly. Due to the low content and highly level dispersion of Pd on the surface, no characteristic peaks of Pd or Pd oxides can be observed [31]. Similar homogeneous structures of Pd-Mn3O4 catalysts also exhibited similar type IV adsorption/desorption curves and pore size distribution (Fig. S3) [32], leading to a similar specific surface area and pore volume (Table S2).
The structure and morphology of Pd-Mn3O4 were investigated by SEM and TEM technique. Due to the constraints of the MOF-74 precursor, a carbon nitrogen skeleton was formed by controlled atmosphere heat treatment [3]. Therefore, 1.08Pd-Mn3O4 sample displayed connected Mn3O4 nanoparticle frameworks, and retained the typical hexagonal crystal morphology with nearly 5 μm in diameter (Fig. 1a-c). Additionally, only crystal planes belonging to the (2 0 0) and (2 0 2) of Mn3O4 were observed in 1.08Pd-Mn3O4 [33] (Fig. 1d) with HRTEM and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images. No crystal planes belonging to Pd or Pd oxides were observed, indicating the low Pd loading with high dispersion in the Mn3O4 lattice rather than the agglomeration to form particles. High Angle Annular Dark Field (HAADF) - scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS) - mapping also observed that Pd, O, and Mn were uniformly dispersed on surface (Fig. 1e-h), further confirming the successful synthesis of Mn3O4 spinel structure with uniform and high level doping of Pt [29].

3.2. Surface chemical properties analysis.
XPS was used to analyse the surface elemental composition and chemical state of Pd-Mn3O4 catalysts. The contents of Mn4+, Mn3+ and Mn2+ were obtained based on the Mn 2p spectra (Fig. 2a) [34]. Compared to Mn3O4, the introduction of Pd increased the Mn4+ and Mn3+ ratio (Table S3). It implied that after Pd loading, the SMSI effect will cause electrons to move from Pd to Mn, strengthening the coordination of surface Mn and O. However, with the rising amount of Pd doping, the molar ratio of Mn4+ first increased and then decreased. A higher Mn4+ content also means more Mn4+-Osur-Mn3+ active sites, promoted the ability to adsorb and activate propane and oxygen molecules, thereby benefiting to the enhancement of catalytic activity [35].

Based on the O 1 s spectra, two peaks were identified (Fig. 2b), which could be attributed to lattice oxygen (O2, Olatt) and surface active oxygen (O-, O2, Osur) and adsorbed oxygen (O2, OH, Oads) [36], respectively. Pd-Mn3O4 catalysts presented more Osur species on surface, due to the activation of oxygen vacancies on lattice oxygen, as well as the SMSI effect between Pd and Mn3O4 [37].
From the Pd 3d spectra, the peaks belonging to Pd2+ and Pd4+ were observed (Fig. 2c). The ratio of Pd2+/Pd4+ was also increased and then decreased, with a maximum ratio of 2.34 for the 1.08Pd-Mn3O4 catalyst [38]. The presence of Pd2+ was responsible for the high activity of the catalyst for the catalytic oxidation by oxygen molecules [18]. Meanwhile, the enhancement of the SMSI effect promoted the electron transfer between Pd2+/Pd4+ and Mn4+/Mn3+, thus boosted electron activity, and was conducive to promoting the catalytic performance of Mn active site.
Additionally, more characterizations of oxygen species were conducted to the surface oxidation status. EPR spectra revealed that due to the excellent activation effect of Pd on Olatt, Pd incorporation into Mn3O4 lattice improved the content of oxygen vacancies (Fig. 2d). The increase of oxygen vacancies effectively regulated the electronic structure of the catalyst surface, and facilitated the electron enrichment and activation of oxygen molecules, so the content of oxygen vacancies is also one of the main factors affecting the catalytic activity of propane [39].
Meanwhile, more analysis of surface oxygen species was adopted through O2-TPD. The O2-TPD profile of 1.08Pd-Mn3O4 exhibited lower temperature for chemical adsorption oxygen (O2 and O-) desorption (250350 C) than Mn3O4 (Fig. 2e) [40]. Besides, 1.08Pd-Mn3O4 possessed maximum lattice oxygen (O2) desorption temperature and amount (Table S4), representing a highest oxygen migration rate on the surface [41].
The introduction of Pd usually enhanced the low-temperature reduction capacity of the catalyst [42]. There were notable peaks in H2-TPR curves of Mn3O4 and 1.08Pd-Mn3O4 at 200300 C and 300400 C, which corresponding to the reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+ and Mn3+ to Mn2+ [43], individually (Fig. 2f). Although no additional reduction peaks were introduced because of the low Pd content. However, the excellent reducibility of Pd and high surface lattice oxygen mobility led to a maximum low-temperature hydrogen consumption of 1.08Pd-Mn3O4 (Table S5).
3.3. DFT calculation analysis.
The influence of Pd loading on SMSI effect was verified by DFT calculation. From the charge density difference, an obvious decrease and increase of the electron density cloud on Pd and Mn surface could be observed, respectively (Fig. 3a), and the transfer of charge from Pd to Mn was established. The reduction of surface electrons on Pd led to the weakening of Pd-O bonds, which could be confirmed in the electron localization function (ELF) diagram (Fig. 3b and 3c). In the density of states (DOS), the d-band of Mn was shifted to Fermi level after Pd loading (Fig. 3d and 3e), indicating the increase in surface Mn charge [44]. Additionally, the SMSI effect between Pd and Mn3O4 was quantified by Bader charge analysis (Fig. S4). The higher number of valence electron of Mn in Pd-Mn3O4 than that of Mn3O4 accurately described the stronger SMSI effect between Pd and Mn3O4 (Table S6) [45].

(f) Change of Gibbs free energy during propane initial oxidation. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
Besides, the influence of SMSI effect on the surface adsorption activation state was also simulated. The calculated C3H8 and O2 adsorption energies revealed that C3H8 and O2 were more easily adsorbed on the surface of Pd-Mn3O4 than Mn3O4 (Fig. S5). However, the O vacancy formation energies were in the order Mn3O4 Pd-Mn3O4 (Fig. S6), signifying that the size difference of Pd after loading led to a significant increase in the surrounding lattice oxygen mobility [29]. Moreover, due to the stronger SMSI effect, lower O dissociation energy designated that O2 are more likely to dissociate near Pd after adsorption, forming active oxygen species. Furthermore, according to the reaction mechanism catalysed by propane on Mn3O4 surface [3], the intermediate state energy transformation were calculated in the initial stage. Similar to the literature, the rate-limiting steps of propane dissociation were the first CH bond (C3H8 to C3H8O) and CC bond (C3H6O to C3H6O2) activations [32]. The lower energy barriers illustrated that the SMSI effect promoted the reduction of propane on the surface (Fig. 3f).
Additionally, the influence of oxygen vacancies was also verified. When oxygen vacancies were present on the surface, both the d-band center of Mn3O4-O and Pd-Mn3O4-O was moved to Fermi level, indicating the increase in surface energy (Figs. S7 and S8). Thus, the number of electrons in Mn on the surface of Mn3O4 was further improved. As a consequence, both Mn3O4-O and Pd-Mn3O4-O exhibited Mn projected density of states (PDOS) center much close to Fermi level, and possessed more Bader charge than Mn3O4 and Pd-Mn3O4 (Fig. S9 and Table S7). It indicates that due to the destruction of surface Mn-O coordination, more electrons are left on the Mn surface near the defect [46]. Therefore, the presence of oxygen vacancies greatly enhanced the activation performance of propane and oxygen molecules (Fig. S10). Meanwhile, the formation of surface oxygen vacancies will form electron voids near Mn, enhancing the adsorption ability to oxygen molecules (Fig. S11).
3.4. Catalytic activity and stability.
The synthesized Pd-Mn3O4 catalysts were used for the catalytic activity evaluation of propane oxidation reaction. Only CO2 products were detected during the reaction process (Table S8), indicating that the synthesized catalysts have excellent selectivity for propane oxidation. The curve of propane conversion rate with temperature is shown in Fig. 4a, the Pd-Mn3O4 catalysts exhibited significantly better performance than Mn3O4 (T90 = 334 C), indicating that the loading of Pd had an obvious impact on propane total oxidation catalytic activity. In the meantime, based on the T90 temperature values, the 1.08Pd-Mn3O4 catalyst had the best catalytic activity (T90 = 240 C) (Table 1, S9), specific surface area (SSA) (Fig. S12) and turnover frequency (TOF) (Fig. S13), which was also confirmed by the activation energy (Ea) calculation results (Fig. S14).

Structure-effect relationships were investigated by correlating catalytic activity with the surface species ratio (Fig. 4b). For Mn3O4 catalysts, the influence of Mn4+/Mn3+ on the catalytic activity was decisive. As the reactive site of Mn3O4, a higher Mn4+/Mn3+ ratio was conducive to absorbing and activating propane and oxygen molecules [3]. Furthermore, because surface-active oxygen species are the main low-temperature active species compared to the more stable lattice oxygen, Osur/Olatt represented a stronger activity correlation. To achieve low temperature oxidation of propane molecules, the highly oxidisable Osur could be directly inserted into the CH or CC bond by nucleophilic reaction [35]. In addition, the SMSI effect between Pd and Mn3O4 was also quite important, due to the fact that Pd provides more Osur on the surface of Mn3O4 through the activation of oxygen molecules [47]. Meanwhile, Pd and adjacent Mn formed an oxidationreduction cycle. The electron transfer between Pd4+/Pd2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ accelerated the charge transfer between substrate and catalyst at low temperatures.
In practical applications, the stability of catalysts was also of great significance. When 5% water was present in the reaction system, it could be observed that the catalytic activity of the catalyst has been weakened to a certain extent (Fig. 4c), due to the competitive adsorption of propane and water [48]. The order of resistance of catalysts to water is 1.08Pd-Mn3O4 Mn3O4 (Fig. 4d). Meanwhile 1.08Pd-Mn3O4 catalyst displayed excellent long-term stability (Fig. S15), crystal stability (Fig. S16), structure stability (Fig. S17, Table S10) and value states stability (Fig. S18). Moreover, 1.08Pd-Mn3O4 catalyst exhibited an outstanding high-low temperature change stability (Fig. S19) and cycle stability (Fig. S20, Table S11).
3.5. Catalytic reaction mechanism
In-situ DRIFTs technique was measured for analysing the transformation of surface intermediate species during reaction processes. Except for the CC, CH vibration absorption peaks belonging to propane molecules (Table S12) [49], the vibration modes of intermediates over Mn3O4 (Fig. 5a) and 1.08Pd-Mn3O4 (Fig. 5b) mainly included stretching vibration of υs(H-OH), υs(CO), υas(COO), υs(CH3COO), υs(COCH), υas(CO) and υ(COC) bonds [50], [51], [52]. It indicated that the carboxylates and carbonates were the principal intermediates [35]. The vibrational peaks of the 1.08Pd-Mn3O4 and Mn3O4 catalysts had similar positions in the in-situ DRIFTs spectra, signifying that the oxidation path of propane on the surface of the 1.08Pd-Mn3O4 catalyst was the same as that of Mn3O4. Propane was adsorbed and activated on the catalyst surface, and the activated propane reacted with active oxygen to form alcohol or aldehyde, which was then oxidized to form carboxylate intermediates. The intermediates underwent the oxidation process and are converted into products carbon dioxide and water. Although the reaction pathways of propane were similar, more carboxylate species peaks were observed on the surface of 1.08Pd-Mn3O4, indicating that the SMSI effect promoted the synergistic effect between Mn and Pd, and improved ability to adsorb and activate propane and oxygen [53], as well as the ability to decompose intermediate products. This resulted in differences in the complete oxidation performance of propane between the two catalysts [54].

Moreover, similar to Ag [14] and Cr [3], Pd could also generate a small amount of propylene intermediate through dehydrogenation during the initial stage of propane oxidation (Fig. 5c). The additional adsorbed peaks appeared at 1433 and 1631 cm1 on Pd-Mn3O4 surface belonged to the asymmetric vibration of CC bond. Due to the fact that the CC bond was more easily oxidized and broken than the CC bond, the formation of propylene could greatly reduce the energy for initial propane degradation. It was also confirmed by DFT calculation (Fig. S21), that through propylene as an intermediate, the energy barrier of the reaction would further decrease. It is also an important reason why introducing Pd improves the catalytic activity of propane.
4. Conclusions
In sum, the Pd doping with a limited pyrolysis oxidation strategy to prepare Pd-Mn3O4 spinel catalysts resulted in a uniform morphology and dispersion of active components. Among the catalysts, 1.08Pd-Mn3O4 presented the highest catalytic efficiency with a T90 value of 240 C, which was 94 C lower than that of Mn3O4. For the first time, we focused on the Structureactivity relationship between the SMSI effect and propane total oxidation. Characterization and DFT calculation results revealed that the SMSI effect between Pd and Mn3O4 promoted the redistribution of surface charges. Thus, the high dispersion of Pd increased the active sites on the surface and enhanced the activation and migration of surface oxygen species. Moreover, we focused on investigating the effect of Pd introduction on the complete oxidation of propane. The presence of surface oxygen vacancies from Pd doping enhanced the adsorption capacity of Mn3O4 on the reactants, and boosted the active surface oxygen species generation. Meanwhile, the presence of Pd will alter the initial reaction path and lower the initial energy barrier. Overall, this study provided a design strategy for novel catalysts with dual active components catalysts based on the SMSI effect and extended the application of these catalysts in the important field of VOCs elimination.

Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
