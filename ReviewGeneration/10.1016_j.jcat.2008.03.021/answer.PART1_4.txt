<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states and acid-base properties affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that the enhanced activity of Ga-Al mixed oxides is linked to abundant weak Lewis acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ sites, which arise from the formation of Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution. A correlation is revealed between weak acid site density and propane conversion.

[1] "Whereas the same tendency was observed for the specific activity normalized by BET surface area, significantly enhanced stability was achieved for Ga2O3Al2O3 with higher aluminum content." 

[2] "The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 due to the formation of spinel-type γ-Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solutions is suggested to play a key role in the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, which makes GaxAl10xO15 composites highly active and stable for the reaction."

3. Yes, the article proposes that the formation of spinel-type Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution leads to favorable dispersion of surface gallium sites, making the mixed oxide catalysts highly active and stable. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 enables abundant tetrahedral gallium sites which are involved in activating propane.
