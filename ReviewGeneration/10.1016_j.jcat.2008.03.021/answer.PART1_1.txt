 Unfortunately, the given text does not contain relevant quotes or information to directly answer any of the specific questions asked about evaluating promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3 and Pt-Sn, investigating how tuning oxidation states and acid-base properties affects performance, proposing mechanistic scenarios, exploring metal-support interfacial effects, evaluating supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir, investigating how properties like metal particle size and support interactions affect performance, or proposing mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts.

The text focuses solely on spinel-type gallia-alumina solid solution catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane and does not evaluate or discuss any of the other catalysts or topics asked about in the questions.
