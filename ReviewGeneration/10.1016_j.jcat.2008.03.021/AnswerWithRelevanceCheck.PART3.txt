         [1] "A series of mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide catalysts with various compositions as well as the simple oxide of Al2O3 and Ga2O3 were prepared through an alcoholic coprecipitation pathway [31]."

         [2] "Despite extensive efforts dedicated to the reaction mechanism and the factors that control activity, the aforementioned Ga2O3-based catalysts all deactivate drastically within a few hours [21], [23], [24], because a high density of medium-strong acid sites on the surface of the Ga2O3-based materials favors considerable coke formation under alkane dehydrogenation conditions [21], [23], [25]."

         [3] "It is noteworthy that an appreciable increase in the intensity of the
band of adsorbed pyridine also has been identified for the mixed-oxide catalysts with respect to the simple oxide of γ-Ga2O3, further confirming the greater surface density of Lewis acid sites that can be achieved over the mixed-oxide materials."

         Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It prepares a series of gallium-aluminum mixed oxide catalysts with different compositions using an alcoholic coprecipitation method to achieve high dispersion of the active gallium phase. It shows that the mixed oxides have greater surface density of gallium Lewis acid sites compared to simple gallium oxide, which enhances activity and stability.
