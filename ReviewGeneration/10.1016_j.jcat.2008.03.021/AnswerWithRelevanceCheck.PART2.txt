 ※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※

The answers provided do not contain information relevant to answering the questions asked. All the answers state that the article does not compare selectivity profiles, evaluate Pt alloy catalysts, investigate electronic/geometric effects, use subsurface promoters, describe synergistic effects, evaluate zeolite supports, or investigate effects of tuning zeolite properties. 

Since the answers do not provide substantive information related to the questions, I have responded with the sentence indicating the answers are not relevant, per the instructions.
