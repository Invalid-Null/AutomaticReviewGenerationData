 Based on the provided answers, I do not see quotes or information that are directly relevant to answering the specific questions asked about evaluating different metal oxide catalysts, investigating tuning of oxidation states and acid-base properties, proposing mechanistic scenarios, supported metal catalysts, etc. for propane dehydrogenation.

The answers focus solely on spinel Ga-Al mixed oxide catalysts without providing insights into the other specific catalysts and topics asked about.

Therefore, I will provide the single sentence indicating that the answers are not relevant:

※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※
