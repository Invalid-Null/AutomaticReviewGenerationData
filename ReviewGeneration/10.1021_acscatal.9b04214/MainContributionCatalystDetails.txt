The key points are:
- The main catalyst studied is Pt/Al2O3, which contains Pt metal supported on aluminum oxide. 
- The conversion rate is 10-20% and selectivity is 70-80% for propane dehydrogenation.
- The catalyst is unstable and Pt tends to sinter into nanoparticles under reaction conditions. Deactivation rate is around 50% in 2 hours.  
- Propylene yield is 10-15%.
- Reaction temperature is 600°C and catalyst loading is 140 mg.
