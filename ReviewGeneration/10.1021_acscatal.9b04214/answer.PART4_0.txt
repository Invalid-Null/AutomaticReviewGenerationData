 Unfortunately this literature does not contain information to answer any of the specific questions. The article focuses on studying the catalytic properties of platinum single atoms, clusters, and nanoparticles for hydrogenation reactions, CO oxidation, propane dehydrogenation, and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. It does not provide details on process intensification, techno-economic analysis, safety issues, remaining challenges, computational catalyst screening, improved characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures specifically for propane dehydrogenation.
