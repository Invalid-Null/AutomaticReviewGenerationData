 Unfortunately, the literature provided does not contain any relevant information to answer the questions asked. The article focuses on Sn-Beta zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and does not evaluate Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 or supported Pt, Pd, Ir catalysts. No mechanistic insights, structure-activity relationships, or metal-support effects are provided for those unsupported or supported metal oxide catalysts.
