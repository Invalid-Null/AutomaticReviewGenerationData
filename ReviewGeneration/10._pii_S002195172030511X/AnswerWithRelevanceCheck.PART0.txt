[1] Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation. 

[2] Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.

<English>
The article explains that the Sn-Beta zeolite catalyst with Lewis acid sites is able to activate the C-H bond in propane and catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction. Theoretical calculations suggest the propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites from single-site Sn atoms incorporated into the zeolite framework, which lower the activation energy barriers.

[1] The catalytic behaviors of these Beta catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reaction (Fig. 9). The H-Beta zeolite can activate propane and catalytically convert it into propylene, ethylene, ethane, and methane.

[2] The iron-silicate zeolites show high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction, and a redox catalytic cycle occurring over the isolated or single-site Fe framework sites in Fe-zeolites for the formation of propane radical cations is suggested to the reaction mechanism in propane dehydrogenation.
