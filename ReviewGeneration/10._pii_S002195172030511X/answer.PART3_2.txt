<quotes>
[1] "The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite."

[2] "Most importantly, Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It utilizes an indirect synthesis method to incorporate Sn atoms into vacancies in the zeolite framework, generating isolated Sn single atom sites. This encapsulation provides excellent stability, as the Sn-Beta zeolites show no detectable deactivation after 72 hours under harsh reaction conditions.
