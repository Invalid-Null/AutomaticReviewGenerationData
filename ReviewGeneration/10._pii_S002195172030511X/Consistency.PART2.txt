I compared each answer file's responses to the correct answers for each question, and calculated the consistency ratio as the percentage of correct information provided. For questions 1-5, all files were completely inconsistent (0% overlap) with the correct answers. For question 6, some files partially addressed the zeolite BEA support while others did not. For question 7, again all files were completely inconsistent.
