<quotes>

[1] Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation. 

[2] Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article explains that the Sn-Beta zeolite catalyst with Lewis acid sites is able to activate the C-H bond in propane and catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction. Theoretical calculations suggest the propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites from single-site Sn atoms incorporated into the zeolite framework, which lower the activation energy barriers.

</English version answer>

[1] Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

5. The article describes how DFT calculations were applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways. The calculations revealed that the direct dehydrogenation pathway is kinetically more favorable than the indirect pathway in closed Sn-Beta sites, and open Sn sites appear more reactive depending on hydroxylation extent.
