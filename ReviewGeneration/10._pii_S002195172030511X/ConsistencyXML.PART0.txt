I compared each answer file's content to the correct answers provided and assessed the consistency percentage. Files answer1.txt and answer3.txt contained relevant quotes and summaries consistent with the correct answers, so they have 100% consistency. The other files contained no relevant information, so they have 0% consistency. The XML structure presents these consistency ratios for each question and answer file as requested. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
