[1] Sn-Beta zeolites with different Sn/Si ratios obtained from two steps were investigated with XRD characterization, to verify the possible structural changes in the post-synthesis procedures.

[2] The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite.

[3] The incorporation of Sn species into Beta zeolite structure will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites.

[4] These tetracoordinated Sn single atoms are intensively bonded to the zeolite framework, which enables these Sn atoms to be highly stable under the harsh reaction condition.

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It discusses the indirect synthesis method to first dealuminate the zeolite framework to create vacancies, and then incorporate Sn atoms into these vacancies. This encapsulation results in isolated tetracoordinated Sn single atoms that are intensively bonded to the framework, leading to high stability under harsh reaction conditions.

[1] STEM characterization was carried out on a typical Sn-Beta-30 sample, in order to know the morphology and elemental distribution in its structure.

[2] An energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping in the STEM analysis confirms that Si, O, and Sn elements are homogeneously distributed in the Sn-Beta sample. 

[3] Note that there is no evident phase separation among these three elements. It can be therefore inferred that Sn species are uniformly dispersed in Beta zeolite structure, and most probably the Sn species enters into zeolitic framework and exists as isolated or single-site Sn.
