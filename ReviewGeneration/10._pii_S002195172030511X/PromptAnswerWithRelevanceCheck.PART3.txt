1. The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite [35], [36].

2. The incorporation of Sn species into Beta zeolite structure will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites [61].

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It shows that incorporating Sn species into the zeolite framework as isolated single sites leads to high thermal stability without deactivation after 72 hours under harsh reaction conditions. This is attributed to the strong anchoring effect and metal-support interaction for framework incorporated Sn compared to extra-framework SnO2 particles.
