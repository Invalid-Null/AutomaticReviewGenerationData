[1] "Herein, we introduce a methodology to describe the microenvironment and determine the effectiveness of active sites in a Pt-based alloy catalyst for the industrially important PDH reaction, whose target product propylene has been experiencing steady demand growth over recent decades. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we construct specific models to separately identify the electronic regulation and geometric modulation of the Pt site within the PtM ensemble, and thereby define a simple descriptor, φ."
