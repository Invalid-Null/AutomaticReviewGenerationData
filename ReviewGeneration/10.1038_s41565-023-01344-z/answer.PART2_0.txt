<quotes>
[1] "Herein, we introduce a methodology to describe the microenvironment and determine the effectiveness of active sites in a Pt-based alloy catalyst for the industrially important PDH reaction, whose target product propylene has been experiencing steady demand growth over recent decades"

[2] "Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we construct specific models to separately identify the electronic regulation and geometric modulation of the Pt site within the PtM ensemble, and thereby define a simple descriptor, φ. It depicts the degree of PtC repulsion, corresponding to a kind of isolation effect, and is thus called degree-of-isolation."

[3] "The catalytic performance of PtM single-site alloy is examined thoroughly using this descriptor for an industrially important reaction, propane dehydrogenation."

[4] "Manifesting a moderate degree-of-isolation, PtZn IMA is the optimal catalyst, which reveals a Sabatier-type principle for designing selective single-site alloys, and the superior experimental performance of PtZn IMA has been reported recently."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It introduces a descriptor called "degree-of-isolation" to describe the microenvironment and determine the effectiveness of Pt-based alloy catalyst active sites for propane dehydrogenation. DFT calculations are used to construct models to separately identify electronic regulation and geometric modulation of the Pt site within PtM ensembles. The catalytic performance of PtM single-site alloys is examined using this descriptor. PtZn IMA with a moderate degree-of-isolation is found to be the optimal catalyst, revealing a Sabatier-type principle for designing selective single-site alloys.

Answer: 是的,该文研究了双金属和合金催化剂中次要金属的电子和几何效应。它提出了一个称为“隔离程度”的描述符来描述微环境并确定丙烷脱氢Pt基合金催化剂活性位点的有效性。使用DFT计算构建模型以独立识别PtM集团中的Pt位点的电子调节和几何调谐。使用该描述符全面考察了PtM单点合金的催化性能。具有适度隔离程度的PtZn间化合物被发现是最佳的催化剂,揭示了设计选择性单点合金的Sabatier原则。
