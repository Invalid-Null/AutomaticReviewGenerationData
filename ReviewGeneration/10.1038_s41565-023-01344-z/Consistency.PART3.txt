 Here is the JSON structure comparing the answer files to the correct answers:

}
```

I examined each answer file and compared it to the correct answers provided. For each question, I calculated the consistency percentage based on whether the answer matched the correct answer. All answers were either 100% consistent or completely inconsistent (0%), so the ratios are all 0% or 100%.
