[1] "Herein, we introduce a methodology to describe the microenvironment and determine the effectiveness of active sites in a Pt-based alloy catalyst for the industrially important PDH reaction, whose target product propylene has been experiencing steady demand growth over recent decades"

[2] "Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we construct specific models to separately identify the electronic regulation and geometric modulation of the Pt site within the PtM ensemble, and thereby define a simple descriptor, φ. It depicts the degree of PtC repulsion, corresponding to a kind of isolation effect, and is thus called degree-of-isolation."

[3] "The catalytic performance of PtM single-site alloy is examined thoroughly using this descriptor for an industrially important reaction, propane dehydrogenation."

[4] "Manifesting a moderate degree-of-isolation, PtZn IMA is the optimal catalyst, which reveals a Sabatier-type principle for designing selective single-site alloys, and the superior experimental performance of PtZn IMA has been reported recently."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It introduces a descriptor called "degree-of-isolation" to describe the microenvironment and determine the effectiveness of Pt-based alloy catalyst active sites for propane dehydrogenation. DFT calculations are used to construct models to separately identify electronic regulation and geometric modulation of the Pt site within PtM ensembles. The catalytic performance of PtM single-site alloys is examined using this descriptor. PtZn IMA with a moderate degree-of-isolation is found to be the optimal catalyst, revealing a Sabatier-type principle for designing selective single-site alloys.

<quotes>
[1] "To investigate the electronic regulation of the Pt site, the geometric effect is minimized. Here, three group VIII metals (Fe, Co and Ni), which have similar atomic radii, were selected as alloying elements."

[2] "Our calculations show that the d-band center of Pt becomes more negative when more electrons transfer from M to Pt (Fig. 1b,c). Moreover, both properties can present a linear correlation with the electronegativity difference (Δχ) between Pt and M (Fig. 1c)."

[3] "To investigate geometric modulation of the Pt site quantitatively, the disturbance of electronic structure is preferably eliminated. Thus, two slab models, PtZn(110) and PtZn(101) with various geometric structures but a similar electronic environment, were established (Extended Data Fig. 2). Figure 2a shows that the activation energy of the undesired side reaction, C3H6 dehydrogenation, increases linearly with elongating interatomic distance of the nearest neighbour of Pt (Δd)."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It selects Fe, Co, and Ni as alloying elements with Pt due to their similar atomic radii to minimize geometric effects and shows electron transfer from the secondary metal affects Pt's d-band center and catalytic properties (Quote 1-2). It also constructs PtZn slab models with similar electronics but different geometry to isolate geometric effects, finding interatomic distance affects selectivity (Quote 3).

[4] "Representatively, PtZn IMA, manifesting a moderate φ (0.5), is predicted to possess superior performance in PDH, which has been reported experimentally."

[5] "At this stage, the selectivity gradually increases as φ becomes larger."

[6] "When further looking at PtM alloys on the right slope of the volcano, it is found that they exactly contain those M on the left and middle of the periodic table (group IIIB to VIIB)." 

[7] "Group VIIB metal, in the middle of the periodic table, which refers only to Mn, is not particularly inclined to act as an adsorption site, and consequently C3H5 contacts with a single Pt atom. Such alternation of the active centre has a strong impact on tuning selectivity, indicating PtMn as a selective catalyst."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Specific examples and structure-function insights revealed include:

- Using DFT to construct models to separately identify electronic regulation and geometric modulation of the Pt site in PtM ensembles, defining a degree-of-isolation descriptor φ that depicts PtC repulsion (Quotes 1-3). 

- PtZn IMA with moderate φ of 0.5 is predicted and experimentally validated to have superior PDH performance (Quote 4). 

- As φ increases, selectivity gradually increases (Quote 5). 

- For PtM alloys on the right of the volcano plot, the secondary metal is from groups IIIB-VIIB, altering the active center and strongly impacting selectivity. PtMn is indicated as a selective catalyst (Quotes 6-7).

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It introduces a methodology using DFT calculations to separately identify the electronic regulation and geometric modulation of the Pt site when alloyed with a secondary metal M. A simple descriptor called "degree-of-isolation" is defined that depicts the degree of Pt-C repulsion, corresponding to an isolation effect. PtZn IMA manifests a moderate degree of isolation and is found to be the optimal PDH catalyst.
