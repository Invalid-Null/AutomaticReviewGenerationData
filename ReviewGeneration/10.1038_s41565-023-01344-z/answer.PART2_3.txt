[1] "Herein, we introduce a methodology to describe the microenvironment and determine the effectiveness of active sites in a Pt-based alloy catalyst for the industrially important PDH reaction, whose target product propylene has been experiencing steady demand growth over recent decades."

[2] "Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we construct specific models to separately identify the electronic regulation and geometric modulation of the Pt site within the PtM ensemble, and thereby define a simple descriptor, φ."

[3] "It depicts the degree of PtC repulsion, corresponding to a kind of isolation effect, and is thus called degree-of-isolation."

[4] "Representatively, PtZn IMA, manifesting a moderate φ (0.5), is predicted to possess superior performance in PDH, which has been reported experimentally."

[5] "At this stage, the selectivity gradually increases as φ becomes larger."

[6] "When further looking at PtM alloys on the right slope of the volcano, it is found that they exactly contain those M on the left and middle of the periodic table (group IIIB to VIIB)." 

[7] "Group VIIB metal, in the middle of the periodic table, which refers only to Mn, is not particularly inclined to act as an adsorption site, and consequently C3H5 contacts with a single Pt atom. Such alternation of the active centre has a strong impact on tuning selectivity, indicating PtMn as a selective catalyst."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Specific examples and structure-function insights revealed include:

- Using DFT to construct models to separately identify electronic regulation and geometric modulation of the Pt site in PtM ensembles, defining a degree-of-isolation descriptor φ that depicts PtC repulsion (Quotes 1-3). 

- PtZn IMA with moderate φ of 0.5 is predicted and experimentally validated to have superior PDH performance (Quote 4). 

- As φ increases, selectivity gradually increases (Quote 5). 

- For PtM alloys on the right of the volcano plot, the secondary metal is from groups IIIB-VIIB, altering the active center and strongly impacting selectivity. PtMn is indicated as a selective catalyst (Quotes 6-7).

Answer: 是的,该文研究了双金属和合金催化剂中第二金属的电子和几何效应。具体的例子和结构-功能关系包括:

- 使用DFT建立模型,分离识别PtM集合中Pt位点的电子调节和几何调制,定义了描述PtC反差的φ度隔离描述符(引用1-3)。

- PtZn中间型金属间化合物 的适度φ值为0.5,预测和实验验证了它在丙烷脱氢反应中具有卓越性能(引用4)。

- 随着φ的增加,选择性逐渐提高(引用5)。

- 对于火山曲线右侧的PtM合金,第二金属来自IIIB-VIIB族,改变了活性中心并对选择性产生了强烈影响。PtMn被指示为选择性催化剂(引用6-7)。
