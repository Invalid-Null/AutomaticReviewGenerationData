[1] "The electronic states of this PtMn ensemble are further monitored using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. After H2 reduction, Pt is reduced to metallic Pt0 for PtMn/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2. In comparison, for PtMn/SiO2, the binding energy of Pt0 in the Pt 4f7/2 peak is 70.4eV, lower than that over Pt/SiO2 (70.7eV). This indicates the electron transfers from Mn to the 5d band of Pt and the formation of electron-rich Pt in the PtMn ensemble37, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction (Figs. 1f and 4h and Supplementary Fig. 3)."
