[1] "In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was performed in a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi photoelectron spectrometer using monochromated X-ray irradiation Al Kα (hν=1,486.6eV) and a 180 double focusing hemispherical analyser with a six-channel detector."

[2] "After this calibration the low-intensity adventitious carbon peak was in the range 284.0284.8eV. Reduction of samples was performed in an ultrahigh-vacuum-connected high-pressure gas cell. The samples were heated in 10% hydrogen diluted in Ar (5mlmin1 H2 and 45mlmin1 Ar, total pressure 1bar) flow from room temperature to 600C with a change rate of 10Cmin1 and then left for 60min for reduction. The photoelectron spectra were recorded after ultrahigh-vacuum transfer of the samples to an analyser chamber without contact with the atmosphere."

6. The article uses in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to probe oxidation state changes during reduction of catalyst samples in hydrogen. The samples are reduced in a high-pressure gas cell connected to ultrahigh vacuum, then transferred without air exposure for XPS analysis. This allows monitoring of changes in oxidation state during the reduction process.
