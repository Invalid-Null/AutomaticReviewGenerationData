[1] "Moreover, PtZn IMA, displaying remarkable initial performance, deactivates gradually in the long-term test, while PtZn IMA[13] has the lowest deactivation rate in a list of representative Pt-based catalysts (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Table 3). As they show similar structural stabilities (Extended Data Figs. 4–6 and Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14), this can be attributed to the superior selectivity of PtZn, which has a moderate φ, demonstrated by the volcano-shaped relationship between φ and propylene selectivity, both theoretical and experimental, among a series of PtM single-site alloys (Figs. 3a and 4j, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 15). Consequently, PtZn preferentially avoids side reactions such as coking, and contributes to a stable performance during reaction when compared with PtMn, which emphasizes the Sabatier-type principle for designing selective single-site alloys."

[2] "The reason for the deactivation of PtMn is also investigated. It is found that low-coordination sites (for example edge and corner sites) facilitate coke formation and contribute to the deactivation at the initial stage of catalysis (Extended Data Fig. 8). Moreover, HAADF-STEM images of the catalysts before and after 50h reaction indicate that the particle size of PtMn grows from 1.1±0.3nm to 1.8±0.5nm, which may be the main reason for catalyst deactivation at the later stage (Supplementary Fig. 16)."

1. The article does not discuss process intensification approaches for propane dehydrogenation.

2. The article does not analyze techno-economic factors affecting propane dehydrogenation. 

3. The article does not discuss safety issues like flammability and explosion hazards for propane dehydrogenation.

4. The article summarizes remaining challenges including catalyst deactivation. PtZn IMA shows lower deactivation than PtMn IMA due to higher selectivity and avoiding coking. Deactivation of PtMn is attributed to coke formation at low-coordination sites initially and particle growth later. Future research on improving stability is identified.

5. The article does not propose leveraging high-throughput computational methods for catalyst screening and design.

6. The article does not highlight needs for improved in-situ characterization tools for propane dehydrogenation catalysts.  

7. The article does not envision transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation.

1. 该文没有讨论丙烷脱氢的过程强化方法。

2. 该文没有分析影响丙烷脱氢经济效益的技术经济因素。

3. 该文没有讨论丙烷脱氢的安全问题,如易燃性和爆炸危险。

4. 该文总结了剩余挑战,包括催化剂失活。PtZn金属间化合物比PtMn金属间化合物失活更慢,因为选择性更高,避免了焦炭形成。PtMn失活起初是由于低配位位点上的焦炭形成,后期是因为颗粒增长。确定了未来提高稳定性的研究方向。

5. 该文没有提出利用高通量计算方法来加速丙烷脱氢催化剂的筛选和设计。

6. 该文没有强调对丙烷脱氢催化剂需要改进的原位表征工具。

7. 该文没有设想出可能实现突破的丙烷脱氢催化剂结构。
