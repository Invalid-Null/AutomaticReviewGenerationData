<quotes>
[1] "To investigate the electronic regulation of the Pt site, the geometric effect is minimized. Here, three group VIII metals (Fe, Co and Ni), which have similar atomic radii, were selected as alloying elements."

[2] "Our calculations show that the d-band center of Pt becomes more negative when more electrons transfer from M to Pt (Fig. 1b,c). Moreover, both properties can present a linear correlation with the electronegativity difference (Δχ) between Pt and M (Fig. 1c)."

[3] "To investigate geometric modulation of the Pt site quantitatively, the disturbance of electronic structure is preferably eliminated. Thus, two slab models, PtZn(110) and PtZn(101) with various geometric structures but a similar electronic environment, were established (Extended Data Fig. 2). Figure 2a shows that the activation energy of the undesired side reaction, C3H6 dehydrogenation, increases linearly with elongating interatomic distance of the nearest neighbour of Pt (Δd)."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It selects Fe, Co, and Ni as alloying elements with Pt due to their similar atomic radii to minimize geometric effects and shows electron transfer from the secondary metal affects Pt's d-band center and catalytic properties (Quote 1-2). It also constructs PtZn slab models with similar electronics but different geometry to isolate geometric effects, finding interatomic distance affects selectivity (Quote 3).

Answer: 是的,该文研究了二元和合金催化剂中第二金属的电子和几何效应。它选择了Fe、Co和Ni作为Pt的合金元素,因为它们的原子半径相似,可以最小化几何效应,并表明第二金属的电子传递会影响Pt的d带中心和催化性质(引文1-2)。它还构建了具有相似电子属性但不同几何结构的PtZn薄膜模型,以隔离几何效应,发现原子间距会影响选择性(引文3)。
