[1] "Herein, to trace the origin of h-BNs decomposition comprehensively during the ODHP process, we analyze the structure change of the h-BN catalyst under a harsh reaction environment..."
[2] "The XRD pattern revealed that the diffraction peaks of the (002) plane of h-BN shifted to a smaller angle after a long-term ODHP treatment, which indicated that the lamellar spacing of adjacent layers became larger."
[3] "Structural characterizations were then performed for h-BN-F and h-BN-S to investigate the catalytic activity decay at a high water vapor concentration (11%). From transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figures 1c and S3a,b), it could be observed that h-BN-F had a smooth surface and neat edge."

20. The article evaluates zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it investigates h-BN, which has a layered structure analogous to certain zeolites. TEM and XRD data in the quotes show that the interlayer spacing of h-BN increases after long-term use for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, indicating some degradation of the layered structure. This provides insights into the importance of maintaining structural integrity of the support under harsh reaction conditions.

[1] "The outstanding stability was consistent with previous literature, and this demonstrated that h-BN had remarkable catalytic stability under a low water vapor concentration."  
[2] "After replacing fresh h-BN catalysts and increasing the reaction temperature, the initial propane conversion was increased to 42% and olefin selectivity was about 79% at 556 C."
[3] "Structural characterizations were then performed for h-BN-F and h-BN-S to investigate the catalytic activity decay at a high water vapor concentration (11%)."

21. The article investigates the effects of water vapor concentration on propane dehydrogenation over h-BN catalysts. At low water vapor concentrations, h-BN shows remarkable stability. But at higher concentrations around 11%, the catalytic activity decays rapidly. This provides insights into the importance of managing water vapor levels to maintain catalyst performance.
