<English version answer>

1. The article states that propylene and ethylene are important building blocks for producing value-added chemicals. 

2. The article explains that oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) facilitates propane dehydrogenation by being exothermic with lower energy consumption compared to nonoxidative dehydrogenation. The mechanisms involve oxidative activation of propane on the catalyst surface.

3. The article does not introduce major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation.

4. The article discusses how the edges of h-BN catalysts can be oxidized/hydrolyzed to generate active sites that catalyze propane dehydrogenation. Isolated indium hydroxide sites are also described as active for alkane C-H bond activation.

5. The article does not describe DFT calculations applied to study propane dehydrogenation.

6. The article does not present microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics. 

7. The article does not describe computational or experimental work to identify catalyst descriptors that correlate to propane dehydrogenation performance.
