 <quotes>
[1] "Light olefins (e.g., propylene and ethylene) are the most important building blocks for producing various value-added fine chemicals for daily use. (1,2)"

[2] "Different from the highly endothermic nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), (6) oxidation dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has a lower energy consumption (strong exothermic and high propane conversion) and better catalytic stability (prevention of coke deposition)."

[3] No relevant quotes.

[4] "The outstanding performance has attracted attention from academia and industry. Subsequent studies have reported that the edges of h-BN could be oxidized/hydrolyzed, and the generated BOx/B(OH)xO3x species are the active sites for catalyzing ODHP. (1214)" 

"Meanwhile, the latest research found the atomically dispersed [InOH]2+ sites could efficiently activate CH in light alkanes. (62)"

<English version answer>

1. The article states that propylene and ethylene are important building blocks for producing value-added chemicals. 

2. The article explains that oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) facilitates propane dehydrogenation by being exothermic with lower energy consumption compared to nonoxidative dehydrogenation. The mechanisms involve oxidative activation of propane on the catalyst surface.

3. The article does not introduce major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation.

4. The article discusses how the edges of h-BN catalysts can be oxidized/hydrolyzed to generate active sites that catalyze propane dehydrogenation. Isolated indium hydroxide sites are also described as active for alkane C-H bond activation.

5. The article does not describe DFT calculations applied to study propane dehydrogenation.

6. The article does not present microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics. 

7. The article does not describe computational or experimental work to identify catalyst descriptors that correlate to propane dehydrogenation performance.

<Answer>
 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the literature that directly address the questions asked. The article focuses on the development of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, and does not provide background information, mechanisms, or computational insights related to non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically.

<Answer>
 Unfortunately the given literature does not contain enough relevant information to provide substantive quotes and answers for the questions asked. The literature focuses on a specific catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, while the questions ask about general background, mechanisms, and trends in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, which are not discussed in depth. Since there is insufficient content in the given text to generate meaningful quotes and answers for these questions, I cannot provide a detailed response in the requested format. In summary, the literature and questions do not align in terms of the specific topic and level of detail. More targeted questions or appropriate reference texts would be needed to generate the formatted quotes and answers as exemplified. I apologize that I cannot be more helpful given the mismatch between questions and materials provided. Please let me know if I can clarify or expand on this in any way.
