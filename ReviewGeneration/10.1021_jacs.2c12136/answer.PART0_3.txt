 Unfortunately the given literature does not contain enough relevant information to provide substantive quotes and answers for the questions asked. The literature focuses on a specific catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, while the questions ask about general background, mechanisms, and trends in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, which are not discussed in depth. Since there is insufficient content in the given text to generate meaningful quotes and answers for these questions, I cannot provide a detailed response in the requested format. In summary, the literature and questions do not align in terms of the specific topic and level of detail. More targeted questions or appropriate reference texts would be needed to generate the formatted quotes and answers as exemplified. I apologize that I cannot be more helpful given the mismatch between questions and materials provided. Please let me know if I can clarify or expand on this in any way.
