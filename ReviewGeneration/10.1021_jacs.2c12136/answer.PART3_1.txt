[1] "Herein, we precisely construct a novel h-BNxIn2O3 composite catalyst using the site-selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) process."

[2] "H-doped In2O3 was synthesized on the edge of h-BN by alternatively exposing cyclopentadienyl indium (InCp), H2O, and O2 plasma at 150 C."

[3] "h-BNxIn2O3 with different ALD cycles displayed distinct stabilities, for example, h-BN30In2O3 had an initial propane conversion of 44.3% (at 554 C), and the corresponding olefin selectivity and yield were 78.5 and 34.8%, respectively." 

[4] "The catalysts service lifetime was further enhanced as the number of deposition cycles was increased to 70 cycles."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses atomic layer deposition (ALD) to precisely deposit H-doped In2O3 on the edges of h-BN supports. Increasing the number of ALD cycles results in better dispersion and enhanced catalyst lifetime.
