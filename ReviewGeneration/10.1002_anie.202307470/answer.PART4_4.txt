 Unfortunately this literature does not contain any relevant quotes or information to answer the questions posed. The literature is about borocarbonitride catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, while the questions are asking about general propane dehydrogenation technology, economics, safety, challenges, computational methods, characterization tools, and novel catalyst architectures. Since the questions are not relevant to the content of the literature provided, I cannot provide any quotes or answers. The literature focuses specifically on the synthesis, characterization, and activity of a new class of borocarbonitride catalysts. It does not address the broader technology context or future directions asked about in the questions.
