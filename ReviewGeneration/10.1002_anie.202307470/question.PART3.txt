Surface Chemistry and Catalytic Reactivity of Borocarbonitride in Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane
Graphical Abstract
A suitable amount of carbon in h-BN catalyst effectively inhibits the excessive oxidation of BCN in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Density functional theory calculations show that the presence of dispersed rather than aggregated carbon atoms can affect the electronic microenvironment of h-BN to render a superior catalytic performance.
Abstract
Borocarbonitride (BCN) materials are newly developed oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts that can efficiently convert alkanes to alkenes. However, BCN materials tend to form bulky B2O3 due to over-oxidation at the high reaction temperature, resulting in significant deactivation. Here, we report a series of super stable BCN nanosheets for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The catalytic performance of the BCN nanosheets can be easily regulated by changing the guanine dosage. The control experiment and structural characterization indicate that the introduction of a suitable amount of carbon could prevent the formation of excessive B2O3 from BCN materials and maintain the 2D skeleton at a high temperature of 520C. The best-performing catalyst BCN exhibits 81.9% selectivity towards olefins with a stable propane conversion of 35.8%, and the propene productivity reaches 16.2mmolh1g1, which is much better than hexagonal BN (h-BN) catalysts. Density functional theory calculation results show that the presence of dispersed rather than aggregated carbon atoms can significantly affect the electronic microenvironment of h-BN, thereby boosting the catalytic activity of BCN.
Introduction
Propane dehydrogenation is an attractive source of propene for the production of high-value petrochemical products such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acetone and isopropanol.1 In this context, the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP), which is characterized by no thermodynamic equilibrium conversion limitation, no coking and a low operating temperature, is considered to be a promising alternative route to industrialized direct dehydrogenation of propane.2 Metal oxide-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction have been extensively studied over the past few decades,2b, 3 and the main challenge explored so far has been the massive co-production of COX, which has been identified as a critical bottleneck in achieving successful process implementation at the commercial scale.1b, 4 Under this background, it is of paramount importance to develop a highly selective catalyst for limiting the deep oxidation pathways.
In recent years, heterogeneous boron-based catalysts, such as h-BN,5 SiB,6 supported boron-based catalysts,7 metal borate materials8 and so on, have demonstrated excellent catalytic performance for the ODH of alkane. h-BN was first found to exhibit ultra-high selectivity towards propene for the ODHP reaction, which significantly outperformed the previously reported metal-based catalysts, opening up a new field of research in boron catalysis for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane.4a, 5a, 9 To date, a number of studies have indicated that the BOX group on the surface of the h-BN material is critical for high catalytic performance.4b, 10 However, the fact is that the less BOX-active species have been far from sufficient to satisfy industrial feasibility, due to the lack of reactive edge defects and the small exposed surface area of the h-BN catalyst. The synthesized high-surface-area h-BN materials also showed structural collapse and decomposition by over-oxidation and hydrolysis under ODHP reaction conditions, which also posed problems for their further fundamental research and practical applications.11
BCN materials, as a type of relatively novel boron-based catalysts, integrate the merits of both graphene and h-BN,12 among which carbon could modify the physicochemical properties of h-BN, such as facilitating the electron transport process for electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen peroxide production,12d, 13 providing multiple active sites for methanol conversion,14 forming defects for alkane ODH reactions.12a, 15 In the synthesis of BCN, carbon doping is usually accompanied by the creation of tunable defects, providing the possibility to control the number of BOX active sites during the reaction. Our previous studies have shown that BCN materials can take advantage of both h-BN and nanocarbon catalysis, enabling ultra-high alkene selectivity and catalytic activity in the ODH of alkanes.12a, 12c The advantages of BCN catalysis can be categorized as follows: (a)BCN catalysts with arbitrary carbon content are suitable for relatively low temperature ethylbenzene ODH reaction, whereas they show opposite effects in the high temperature ODHP reaction; (b)A moderate amount of carbon doping (1520%, based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) can induce more defects and produce more BOX active sites to increase the activity in the ODHP reaction above 500C; (c)Excessive carbon doping (>20%, based on XPS) leads to a deactivation due to the decomposition and sintering in ODHP reaction. Nevertheless, the regulation for BCN materials with lower carbon content (<10%) has not been reported and it is rather difficult to prepare and study the functional mechanism of BCN materials with low carbon levels.
In the current study, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of biomolecule guanine-derived BCN nanosheets with tunable and relatively low carbon content, using guanine as both the carbon and nitrogen source, while boron was derived from boric acid without solvent and template. The optimized-catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance with a selectivity of 61.8% towards propene and 81.9% towards alkenes together with a propane conversion of 35.8%, which far exceeded the catalytic activity of commercial h-BN. The correlation between catalyst structure and catalytic performance was studied to elucidate the reaction active sites. Furthermore, our study, unlike previous reports, serendipitously found that the carbon element can avoid the excessive oxidation over BCN materials and ensure the stability for ODHP reaction at high temperature.
Results and Discussion
BCN nanosheets were typically synthesized using a high-temperature pyrolysis strategy (Scheme1). In detail, the mixture of a certain of amount of guanine together with boric acid was ball-milled and then calcinated at a high temperature under NH3 flow to obtain the BCN nanosheets. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure1ac and FigureS1) show the formation of homogeneous, stacked and partially curved thin 2D sheet-morphologies in all BCN materials (five samples with different carbon contents as comparison). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations confirm the curled nanosheet-like structure of individual nanosheets (Figure1d,e). Note that the nanosheets are transparent to the electron beam, indicating their relatively thin thickness, which is further confirmed by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Figure1f) and the HAADF-STEM image (Figure1g). In addition, the corresponding EDS elemental mappings of a selected area clearly illustrates the common presence and uniform distribution of B, C, N, and O in the framework of the BCN nanosheets.

The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Figure2a) patterns of all the fresh samples show two coinciding peak positions centered at about 26 and 43.3, corresponding to the (002) and (100) reflections typical of the layered BCN structure.16 With the increasing guanine doses during synthesis, the diffraction peak for the (002) plane becomes weaker and the FWHM (full width at half maximum) is broader, and it is gradually shifted to lower angles, as shown from BCN2-1 to BCN1-5. This can be explained by the increased incorporation of carbon into the h-BN lattice. The broadening of the peak implies the formation of a more disordered and defective structure, which is verified by the specific surface area below. In the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR, Figure2b) spectra, two strong absorption peaks at 780cm1 and 1380cm1 are attributed to out-of-plane BNB bending vibration and in-plane BN transverse stretching vibration, respectively.17 Note that the BC bond at about 1100cm1 is rather weak due to the low carbon content.18 It can also be seen that a small peak appears around 3200cm1 to 3400cm1, which can be assigned to the stretching vibration modes of the OH bond. In the UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV/Vis DRS, Figure2c), the absorption bands at 200nm and 245nm are due to the σ-electron and n electron excitation of h-BN.19 In addition, the band at 330nm corresponding to the π-electron is also detected, confirming the formation of the π-bond between the carbon and nitrogen atoms. The Elemental analysis (EA, TableS1) result shows that the as-synthesized materials contain B, C, N, O, H elements and the carbon content gradually increases with the incorporation of guanine in the synthesis. These results confirm the formation of a ternary hybrid system for BCN nanosheets. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms (Figure2d) are also investigated to clarify the porosity of BCN materials. The BET specific surface areas (Table1, FigureS2) are found to increase from BCN2-1 to BCN1-5, i.e., 26m2g1 for BCN2-1, 210m2g1 for BCN1-3, 236m2g1 for BCN1-4 and 270m2g1 for BCN1-5. This indicates that the guanine-derived BCN nanosheets can not only provide abundant C and N sources, but also possess an adjustable specific surface area, which is beneficial for regulating the distribution of active sites.

The catalytic performance of BCN materials is evaluated by the ODHP reaction. The blank experiment with quartz sand shows a negligible propane conversion of 0.5% at 520C due to the homolysis and combustion of propane (FigureS3). At the chosen reaction temperature, h-BN delivers relatively low catalytic performance with approximately 13% propane conversion and 80.1% propene selectivity (FigureS4). Interestingly, the catalytic conversion of BCN catalysts exhibits a volcanic curve depending on the carbon doping content (Figure3a). For example, 18.7%, 35.8% and 27.3% of propane conversions are achieved over BCN2-1, BCN1-3 and BCN1-5, respectively. In particular, BCN1-3 shows more than 2.7times higher propane conversion than h-BN (35.8% vs. 13%), and the propene selectivity and total light olefins selectivity both plateaued at 61.8% and 81.9%, respectively. The catalytic activity of different powder size and loading mass of BCN1-3 catalyst was also tested to exclude the void effect on gas-phase radical reaction (FigureS5). When the catalytic performances are normalized on the same mass of BCN catalysts, it can be seen that the BCN1-3 catalyst exhibits a reaction mass rate of 26.3mmolh1g1 and the propene productivity can reach 16.2mmolh1g1, which also remarkably exceed the performance of the h-BN (7.7mmolh1g1, 2.1times) and other BCN catalysts (Figure3b). In contrast, the catalytic performances of as-synthesized BCN catalysts are superior to those of high-surface-area h-BN (h-BNs), CB4, C3N4 and OCNT (Table1). These data suggest that the appropriate carbon in BCN catalysts could significantly facilitate the ODHP reaction.

The long-term stability of the prepared BCN catalysts is also investigated, and shown in Figure3c and FigureS6S11. Contrary to the previous report,12a after an induction period of around 2h, the BCN1-3 catalyst does not show significant deactivation in the propane conversion in performance. Moreover, the propane conversion shows a positive trend as the temperature is gradually increased from 500C to 520C, while the propene selectivity decreases accordingly (FigureS6). It is worth noting that BCN1-3 maintains a relatively stable catalytic conversion and product selectivity with no sign of decrease for the constant temperature period, which also proves that BCN can exhibit excellent ODHP reaction stability over wide operating temperature windows. However, other BCN materials with lower carbon content suffer from severe deactivation, conversion decrease from 18.7% (230min point) to 14.6% (630min point) over BCN2-1 (FigureS7), and slower deactivation, conversion decrease from 25.3% (230min point) to 22% (630min point) over BCN1-2 (FigureS9). In fact, h-BN (FigureS4), h-BNs (FigureS12a) and CB4 (FigureS13) with containing only C and B elements also deliver a slow decrease in propane conversion in the long reaction time, instead, robust stabilities are detected over BCN1-3 (Figure3c), BCN1-4 (FigureS10) and BCN1-5 (FigureS11) after induction period. It is evident that the presence of the appropriate carbon could significantly increase the catalytic stability for BCN materials, which will be discussed below.
Measurements of the apparent activation energy (Ea) and reaction orders provide further insight into the catalytic reaction mechanism of the BCN catalysts. Compared to 227.04kJmol1 of propane conversion over h-BN (FigureS14a), the lower Ea over the BCN catalyst indicates that the carbon could promote the activation of propane (FigureS15a). In addition, the Ea of oxygen conversion is 110.81kJmol1, lower than that of propane conversion (FigureS15b). This indicates that the rate-determining step is the dehydrogenation step of propane under the current reaction condition.4a, 10c The reaction orders with respect to propane and oxygen are 1.9 and 0.52, respectively (FigureS15c,d), which are approximately identical to those calculated from the h-BN kinetics (FigureS14b,c). Furthermore, a roughly linear relationship between the propene selectivity and yield over propane conversion are also observed for h-BN and synthesized BCN materials (Figure3d, FigureS16). The above experimental results demonstrate that the reaction mechanisms are analogous for the two materials.
The XRD patterns and FT-IR spectra of used BCN catalysts (uBCNx-y) are investigated to reveal their surface structure. The XRD patterns (Figure4a) show new peaks at 14.6 and 27.8 are observed for the uBCN2-1, uBCN1-1, uBCN1-2 and used h-BNs (FigureS12b), indicating the formation of crystalline B2O3 (JCPDS 060297) after the time-on-stream reaction. This confirms the over-oxidation of the catalyst surface during the ODHP reaction, as well as some changes in the nature of the oxygen functionalization. FT-IR spectra (Figure4b) confirm the presence of the BO stretching vibration at 1190cm1 after the reaction, corresponding to the formation of B2O3 crystals on the surface of BCN catalysts. The OH stretching mode at about 3200cm1 increases synchronously, which can be attributed to the HOH bending mode of adsorbed water. In contrast, the XRD patterns remain almost unchanged for BCN1-3, BCN1-4 and BCN1-5, where no crystalline B2O3 diffraction peaks are detected after the ODHP reaction. The formation of crystalline B2O3 domains during the reaction may strongly depend on the catalyst structure, which is also investigated by O2-TPO-MS measurement. As shown in Figure4c-d, no NO2 signals are observed in all BCN catalysts except for a small NO peak in BCN2-1 and BCN1-1. In detail, the NO signals of BCN2-1 and BCN1-1 are detected at 535C and 680C, respectively, confirming that the molecular oxygen breaks the BN bond above 500C, leading to excessive oxidation for the surface of BCN nanosheets, corresponding to the generated B2O3 phase, as confirmed by XRD peaks. In contrast, both of BCN1-3 and BCN1-4, as the same as commercial h-BN, no obvious NO signal could be detected, indicating the stable structure. In addition, thermogravimetric analyses in air (Air-TGA, FigureS17) also confirm that BCN materials show a trend of increasing antioxidant properties with the increase of carbon content in a low concentration range (<10%, based on XPS, Table2). Our previous report suggested that the decrease in catalytic conversion resulted from the formation of bulky B2O3 during the reaction process as well as doping carbon (>15%, based on XPS) may lead to catalyst sintering in ODHP reaction.12a While these results are found that low existence for carbon (<10%, based on XPS, Table2) may be beneficial to improve the stability for BCN materials, ensuring the long-term stability for catalytic performance.

Note: elemental compositions from XPS analysis.
The BET specific surface areas of the spent BCN materials also decrease to varying degrees due to the formation of functional groups on the catalyst surface (Table12, FigureS18), i.e. a sharp decrease from 160m2g1 to 19.8m2g1 for uBCN1-1, a moderate decrease from 210m2g1 to 117.2m2g1 for uBCN1-3 and from 270m2g1 to 146.8m2g1 for uBCN1-5, respectively. Indeed, the higher the level of crystalline B2O3 formation in the BCN catalysts, the higher the possibility of surface pore blockage, resulting in a lower specific surface area. It is also observed that the surface area is maintained by appropriate carbon doping. More directly, SEM images of spent BCN catalysts (FigureS19) show that the condensation and agglomeration morphology for BCN1-1, conversely the majority of BCN1-3 and BCN1-5 still retain 2D sheet-morphology. These phenomena indicate that an appropriate amount of carbon could stabilize and support the 2D morphology in BCN plants. In particular, TEM images of spent BCN1-3 (FigureS20) show an apparent sheet except for the presence of local wrinkles on the surface, and the highly uniform distribution of B, C, N, and O elements from EDS mappings (FigureS21) also confirms the stability of the BCN structure.
The elemental composition and chemical environment of the BCN materials are further investigated by XPS measurements (Table2, FigureS22S26). The survey spectra of BCN1-3-fresh (FigureS22) show that the elements B, C, N and O are the primary surface species and the relative atomic contents are about 45.8%, 6.6%, 40.4% and 7.2%, respectively. The B1s signal can be deconvoluted into three peaks centered at 189.7eV, 190.5eV and 192.0eV, corresponding to the BC, BN and BO bonds,14 respectively. The C1s signal can be resolved into four peaks, including CB, CC, CN and C=O at 283.9eV, 284.6eV, 285.8eV and 287.2eV, respectively. Correspondingly, the N1s XPS fine spectrum are deconvoluted into NB and NC species at 397.8 and 400.2eV.20 Upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, there is a dramatic increase in the O concentration from 7.2% to 19.8% (Table2). In the B1s XPS fine spectra of spent BCN catalysts, new oxygen species correspond to BO3 species (193.3eV) (FigureS24). The increased O content on the surface of spent catalysts suggests that oxygen is functionalized on the surface of BCN materials to form BOX active sites, which play a critical role in the ODHP reaction. In addition, no significant change in carbon concentration also confirms the stable presence of a relatively low carbon level in the h-BN lattice when exposed to the oxygen-enrichment environment, which is due to the formation of a stable BCN ternary solid solution (Table2, FigureS22, FigureS25).
Elemental content analysis of all spent BCN materials also shows a growth trend for the carbon content in the range of 4.9% to 10% with the guanine insertion (Table2). Deconvolution of O1s XPS fine spectra (FigureS26) shows that the major oxygen species on spent BCN materials include BOX (including B2O3 crystals and amorphous BOX), C=O and OH groups. Besides BOX, it has been reported that C=O groups can also be considered as active components of alkane ODH reactions,21 and these functional groups are identified and quantified here.
A linear positive correlation between propane reaction area rate and the surface BOX content is observed in FigureS27a, suggesting that the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane molecules occurs mainly at BOX sites. In contrast, the propane reaction area rates show a non-linear dependence on the amount of C=O groups, indicating that the C=O groups on BCN catalysts may not be mainly active sites for the ODHP reaction (FigureS27b). The best fit is obtained by testing BOX and C=O combinations with different oxygen content (FigureS27c). There is no linear dependence of the propane reaction mass rates on the amount of BOX and C=O groups (FigureS28). Previous studies have confirmed that dynamically generated BOX sites can trigger propane dehydrogenation.4b, 22 In our case, when the carbon content is less than 10% for BCN materials, the main body is h-BN domain, and BOX groups indeed play a major catalytic role in the ODHP reaction. To further confirm our hypothesis, the correlation of area rate versus BOX groups by B1s XPS deconvolution is also displayed in FigureS29. An approximately identical positive linear dependence is also present for the as-synthesized BCN materials with the exception of BCN1-1, as BCN1-1 contains massive bulky crystalline B2O3. In addition, the BCN-N2 with high carbon content (64.5%, Table2) shows a significant combustion under ODHP condition (FigureS17) and the reliable reaction data fails to obtain (FigureS30).
For a reasonable calculation, we assume that crystalline B2O3 provides the same catalytic effect as amorphous BOX species and that these sites are collectively BOX based on O1s XPS fine spectra. The experimentally observed propane consumption rates as dependent variables are linearly fitted with the surface concentration of C=O and BOX functional groups as independent variables using the turnover frequency (TOF) as fitting parameter. The derived equation is as following:
(1)
As shown in Figure5a, the propane consumption rate appears to have a good linear positive dependence on the BOX concentration, from which the intrinsic catalytic activity (propane conversion rate normalized by the number of active sites) of BCN catalysts could be calculated. The TOF for BCN catalysts in the ODHP reaction (the slope of the line) is determined as 6.12×104mmol molecules of propane converted per mmol molecules of BOX per second. The consumption rates are also fitted as a function of other groups (FigureS31). When the surface concentration of BOX groups combined with C=O groups as the object of study (Figure5b), the TOF value decreases from 6.12×104 to 5.97×104s1. The slight decrease also confirms the negligible catalytic role of C=O groups over BCN materials in the ODHP reaction. It means that the consumption rate of propane in terms of active sites can be described as

To further elucidate the role of carbon doping on h-BN catalysts, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. The first dehydrogenation step of ODHP usually starts with the methylene group of propane, which is widely considered to be the rate determining step of the overall reaction.5a This is also consistent with the Ea calculation result described above. The ODHP activity of BCN catalysts with different carbon contents is assessed by using the free energy barrier (Ga) for the first CH bond cleavage of propane as an indicator. Based on the experimental observations of the active sites, the models with the >BOOB< site at the zigzag edge of h-BN are proposed (Figure6a (left)). The possible model of the >BOOB< active sites at the oxygen-terminated zigzag edge is also considered, but the OO bond lengths of the C-doped structures are shortened compared to that of pure h-BN (FigureS32), which is not beneficial for the activation of the OO bond. Therefore, this model was not employed for the subsequent calculations. Noted that the C atoms are chosen to be doped near the BOX active site because the calculation results show that the C near the edge is thermodynamically more stable than those not near the edge (TableS4) and the Ga of the first dehydrogenation of propane is found to be larger as the distance between the doped C atom and the BOX increases (FigureS33). According to the experimental doped C content, we considered two models of C-doped h-BN, BCN-a (Figure6a, middle) and BCN-b (Figure6a, right), containing 3.8% and 7.6% C content, respectively. Free energy barrier calculations show that the Ga of the first dehydrogenation of propane is up to 2.29eV on h-BN without C doping (Figure6b, TableS5), which is consistent with the experimental value (2.37eV, FigureS14a). The reaction releases a ΔG of 3.00eV (Figure6c). After carbon doping, the Ga drops to 1.64eV and 1.54eV (Figure6b), and the ΔG becomes 3.07eV and 3.50eV for BCN-a and BCN-b, respectively (Figure6c, TableS5). It can be seen from Figure6b that during the reaction the C(β)-H bond of propane breaks and the dissociated H species approaches the >BOOB< site to form an OH bond, accompanied by the cleavage of the OO bond at the >BOOB< site. The structures of the initial state, transition state (TS) and final state on h-BN and BCN-a are shown in FigureS34. The above DFT results are in agreement with the experimentally observed activity trend, i.e. the BCN catalysts exhibit higher propane dehydrogenation activity than h-BN (FigureS14a, FigureS15a). Further electronic structure analysis was carried out to unravel the origin of the catalytic propane dehydrogenation activity of the BCN catalysts. The local density of states (DOS) of the O species in the BOX show that the carbon doping increases the electron density near the Fermi level (EF) of the O-2p orbitals on both BCN-a and BCN-b compared to the pristine h-BN (FigureS35), which may contribute to the higher reactivity of ODHP reaction.

The structures of the initial state, transition state (TS) and final state on BCN-b are also displayed. Grey, pink, red, white and blue spheres represent C, B, O, H and N atoms, respectively. (c)Calculated free energy barrier (Ga) and free energy change (ΔG) for the rate-determining step (RDS) on h-BN, BCN-a and BCN-b. (d)Calculated Ga for the RDS on h-BN, BCN-c1, BCN-c2, BCN-c3, BCN-c4 and BCN-cs.
BCN catalysts doped with aggregated carbon atoms in the form of benzene are also constructed. The BCN-cn (n=1-4) are denoted according to the distance of the benzene ring from the BOX active site (FigureS36) and their ODHP activity is investigated. It can be seen that this C doping hardly changes or even weakens the BCN activity (Figure6d, TableS6). However, when dispersed carbon atoms are added near the BOX active site of BCN-c3 (denoted as BCN-cs), the catalyst becomes active again with the Ga decreased from 2.29eV to 1.64eV (Figure6d). Clearly, dispersed carbon atoms in the BCN catalyst are more beneficial for the catalytic ODH reaction than aggregated carbon atoms.
From the current experimental results, a suitable amount of carbon element is able to stabilize in the BCN catalysts due to the presence of h-BN during the high-temperature oxidative reaction. The appropriate carbon-doping could be beneficial to improve the structural stability and prevent the BN bond from oxygen molecular attack, support and maintain the 2D sheet skeleton as well as prevent the surface of the BCN nanosheet from excessive oxidation. It provides long-term stability for catalytic performance. Further DFT calculations show that it is the dispersed carbon atoms, as opposed to the aggregated carbon atoms, that are intrinsically responsible for changing the ODH activity of the BCN catalyst. These results demonstrate the existence of a synergistic effect between carbon and h-BN in BCN materials during the ODHP reaction.
Conclusion
In summary, a series of novel BCN nanosheets with tunable low carbon contents (<10%) were successfully prepared by a simple solvent-free strategy derived from the biomolecule guanine. In the ODHP process, the optimized catalyst exhibits a 22.2% yield of propylene at a stable 35.8% conversion of propane, which is significantly better than h-BN and traditional carbon-based catalysts. Several techniques including XRD, TEM, XPS prove that BOX groups in BCN catalysts are the predominant active sites during the ODHP reaction. In addition, an appropriate level of carbon doping can stabilize the chemical structure of BCN during the high-temperature oxidative reaction, which results from the existence of a synergistic effect between carbon and h-BN. The DFT results also confirm that the dispersed rather than aggregated carbon atoms can promote the activation of the CH bond in propane. Therefore, the optimum doping of the BCN carbon content should be precisely controlled in order to achieve the promising catalytic performance. These findings provide a new insight into the role of carbon in BCN catalysts, provide principles for the design of stable boron-based catalysts, and pave the way for the exploitation of biomolecular resources.
