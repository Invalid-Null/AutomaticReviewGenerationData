 Unfortunately the given literature does not contain information to directly answer any of the specific questions asked. The article focuses on elucidating the role of hydrogen spillover in platinum-encapsulated aluminosilicate catalysts for hydro-/dehydrogenation reactions, and does not evaluate metal oxide or supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. As such, I cannot provide any relevant quotes or answers from the given literature. My apologies that I cannot be of more help in answering the propane dehydrogenation questions posed. Please let me know if I can attempt to answer any other questions based on the provided scientific literature.
