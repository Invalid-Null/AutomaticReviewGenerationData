 Unfortunately, this scientific literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the questions asked. The article is focused on elucidating the phenomenon of hydrogen spillover in platinum-encapsulated aluminosilicates and designing optimized nanostructures to maximize this effect for selective hydro-/dehydrogenation catalysis. It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation specifically.
