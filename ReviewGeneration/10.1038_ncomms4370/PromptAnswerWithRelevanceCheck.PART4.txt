 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes that directly address any of the questions. This article focuses solely on presenting experimental results on improving hydrogen spillover in platinum-encapsulated aluminosilicates for hydro-/dehydrogenation reactions. It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation specifically or any of the broader questions posed about process improvements, economics, safety, characterization methods, computational screening, or transformational catalyst architectures.
