<quotes>
[1] The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising pathway to synthesize propene, as it is an exothermic reaction with no thermodynamic limitation and prevents the frequent carbon deposition removal and catalyst regeneration that occur during the commercialized propane direct dehydrogenation process (PDH)
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explains that catalysts like those for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) can facilitate propane dehydrogenation by making it an exothermic process without thermodynamic limitations, unlike direct dehydrogenation which requires frequent catalyst regeneration due to coking.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 该文献解释了氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)等催化剂可以通过使其成为放热过程且没有热力学限制来促进丙烷的脱氢,而与直接脱氢不同,直接脱氢需要由于炭化而频繁地催化剂再生。

<quotes>
[1] Although the ODHP process is a low-temperature favorable reaction that is more energy-efficient in theory, it has not yet been implemented on a large scale.

[2] The lack of highly selective catalysts to effectively prevent the overoxidation of propane into carbon oxides is one of the most critical challenges.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is thermodynamically favorable at low temperatures, but kinetics have been a challenge. Specifically, it mentions the need for selective catalysts that prevent overoxidation of propane into COx.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 该文献讨论了丙烷脱氢在低温下在热力学上是可行的,但动力学一直是一个挑战。具体来说,它提到了需要选择性催化剂,防止丙烷过氧化生成COx。
