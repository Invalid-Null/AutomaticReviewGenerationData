<quotes>
[1] The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising pathway to synthesize propene, as it is an exothermic reaction with no thermodynamic limitation and prevents the frequent carbon deposition removal and catalyst regeneration that occur during the commercialized propane direct dehydrogenation process (PDH)
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explains that catalysts like those for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) can facilitate propane dehydrogenation by making it an exothermic process without thermodynamic limitations, unlike direct dehydrogenation which requires frequent catalyst regeneration due to coking.
</English version answer>

<quotes>
[1] Although the ODHP process is a low-temperature favorable reaction that is more energy-efficient in theory, it has not yet been implemented on a large scale.

[2] The lack of highly selective catalysts to effectively prevent the overoxidation of propane into carbon oxides is one of the most critical challenges.
