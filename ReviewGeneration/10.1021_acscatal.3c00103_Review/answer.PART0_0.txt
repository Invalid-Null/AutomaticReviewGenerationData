1. Propylene, underpinning many highly valued products (polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and acetone), has a big industrial demand for the foreseeable future. (14)

2. The explosive growth of propylene consumption, coupled with the soaring oil price, makes it difficult for traditional techniques (fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil and steam cracking of naphtha) to satisfy the demand. (5,6)  

3. The propane dehydrogenation technique has been considered a novel and promising route to produce propylene in the context of the appearance of abundant propane resources from the exploitation of shale gas. (7)

4. Propylene, with the unsaturated CC bond is more reactive than propane, causing the practical operating environment to be more complex.
