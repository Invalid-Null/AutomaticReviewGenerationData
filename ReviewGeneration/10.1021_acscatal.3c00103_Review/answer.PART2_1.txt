1. "Sn is a widely utilized promoter for Pt catalysts. Alloying Pt with Sn can significantly alter the electronic and geometric structure of Pt sites. [30,72-74] The electronic effects are reflected in the reduction in the d band of Pt sites and the adjustment of reaction barriers, effectively reducing the coke formation." 

2. "The PtGa catalyst system has also been implemented in production plants (FCDh technique). Recently, Payard et al. investigated the structure-activity relationship over silica-supported PtGa nanoparticles at a molecular level. [82] It was found that the presence of Ga could reduce the sintering of Pt sites by enhancing the interaction between the support and nanoparticles, increasing the dispersion of Pt, and accelerating the mobility of surface atoms."

3. "In has also been developed as a promising promoter of Pt-based catalysts. Zha et al. reported that the bimetallic alloy (Pt3In) exhibited a high activity comparable to those of pure Pt and PtSn alloys and a considerable improvement in the propylene selectivity and stability compared to pure Pt."
