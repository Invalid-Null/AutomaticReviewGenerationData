[1] "This PtSn/SiBeta catalyst exhibited high selectivity toward propylene (98%) with an ultralow deactivation rate of 0.02 h−1 (Figure 6k)."

[2] "A catalyst consisting of nanometric bimetallic PtSn clusters encapsulated in K-MFI zeolite was synthesized via a one-pot direct synthesis using H2[PtCl6] and SnCl4·5H2O as precursors.140 After modulating the interaction between Pt and Sn through the introduction of partially reduced Sn species by adjusting the H2 treatment time, the PtSn nanoclusters were encapsulated in the 10R sinusoidal channels of S-1 zeolite, as determined by a combination of high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-HAADF-STEM) and iDPC imaging. This catalyst exhibited high stability and only slight propane conversion deactivation from 20% to 17% after 70 h."

[3] "PtZn4@S-1 catalyst presented no obvious deactivation of catalytic activity after 13000 min on stream without H2 cofeeding on account of the well-remained subnanometer Pt clusters encapsulated in zeolite channels (Figure 7f)."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. The article discusses examples of encapsulating PtSn and PtZn nanoclusters inside the channels of zeolites like silicalite-1 and ZSM-5. Data shows these encapsulated catalysts have high stability, with very low deactivation rates on the order of 0.02 h-1 over 70+ hours of propane dehydrogenation. The zeolite encapsulation helps stabilize the metal clusters against sintering.

答:是的,该文评估了金属在分子筛载体中的封装来提高丙烷脱氢催化剂的稳定性。该文讨论了在硅硅酸盐-1和ZSM-5等分子筛的通道内封装PtSn和PtZn纳米簇的例子。数据显示,这些封装的催化剂具有高稳定性,在70多个小时的丙烷脱氢反应中,失活率很低,在0.02 h-1的数量级。分子筛的封装有助于抑制金属簇的烧结。

[1] "The PtGa/SAB-15 catalyst with a Pt/Ga molecular ratio of 1:1 exhibited high propane conversion (up to 60%) and selectivity toward propylene (98.2%), even obtaining a propane conversion of 51.6% and a propylene selectivity of 99.5% after 25 h in the PDH stream. However, the amorphous channels of traditional mesoporous zeolites have low hydrothermal stability and weak interactions to fix active compounds, severely limiting their applications in industrial propylene production." 

[2] "Pt has already been recognized as an effective catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to its high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. As discussed above, the PDH reaction is a structure-insensitive reaction whose kinetics is independent of the Pt particle size, while the side reactions are usually structure-sensitive reactions that are dependent on the particle size of Pt and the exposed crystal faces. Small-sized and highly dispersed Pt particles are usually preferable for the PDH reaction due to their considerable catalytic activity and high selectivity toward propylene."

[3] "The prepared PtZn/SiO2 catalyst exhibited high propylene productivity (up to 703 gC3H6 gPt−1 h−1) with >98% propene selectivity and excellent durability with a low deactivation rate (kd = 0.0271). "

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using mesoporous supports like SBA-15 to increase dispersion of PtGa nanoparticles. It also highlights the importance of achieving small, highly dispersed Pt particles, as the PDH reaction kinetics are independent of Pt size while side reactions depend on Pt ensemble size. Data shows a PtZn/SiO2 catalyst prepared by surface organometallic chemistry had excellent durability and high propylene productivity due to uniform dispersion.

答:是的,该文研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它讨论了使用SBA-15等介孔支持物来增加PtGa纳米粒子的分散度。它还强调实现小的、高度分散的Pt颗粒的重要性,因为PDH反应动力学与Pt尺寸无关,而副反应则取决于Pt集合体尺寸。数据显示,通过表面有机金属化学制备的PtZn/SiO2催化剂由于均匀的分散度而具有优异的稳定性和高丙烯生产率。

[1] "The location, uniformity, and exact structure of Co active sites were characterized, indicating that the isolated Co active sites existing in a distorted tetrahedral structure of (SiO)2Co(HOSi)2 were located in the T1(7) and T3(9) sites of MFI zeolites (Figure 6e)."

[2] "After the impregnation process and the subsequent calcination process under an air atmosphere, Co compounds were successfully confined into the hydroxyl nests of the SiBeta support, as confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure 6i)."

[3] "Ultrasmall Pt particles encapsulated in MCM-22 zeolite were fabricated by using dimethylformamide (DMF) as a capping agent along with the hexadecyltrimethylammonium surfactant to wrap Pt precursors during the swelling process of the lamellar zeolitic precursor of a two-dimensional (2D) zeolite into three-dimensional (3D) zeolite (Figure 7a). After the calcination process to remove the organic surfactant and the subsequent reduction process, atomically distributed Pt atoms, coupled with ultrasmall Pt particles of 0.20.7 nm (Figure 7b), were fabricated, possessing high catalytic activity and stability."

[1] "Besides, through the confirmation of XANES spectra presented in Figure 3c,d, it is typically observed that electron transfer from Sn to Pt occurs after alloying of Pt with Sn."

[2] "The electronic effects are reflected in the reduction in the d band of Pt sites and the adjustment of reaction barriers, effectively reducing the coke formation."

[3] "It was indicated that ZnO was a strong Lewis acid because the electron transfer from Zn to Pt put ZnO in an electron-deficient state. After the introduction of Pt, higher activity and stability were achieved, which resulted from the inhibition effect on the reduction of zinc oxide."
