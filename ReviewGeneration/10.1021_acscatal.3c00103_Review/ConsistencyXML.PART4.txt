To determine the consistency, I compared the key points made in each answer file against the correct answers. I scored 100% for fully consistent, 50% for partially consistent, and 0% for inconsistent. The XML shows this percentage consistency for each question and answer file combination.

I hope this helps provide useful insights for evaluating and comparing the different responses! Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.
