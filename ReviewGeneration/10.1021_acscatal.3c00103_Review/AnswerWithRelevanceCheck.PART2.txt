          [1] Sn is a widely utilized promoter for Pt catalysts. Alloying Pt with Sn can significantly alter the electronic and geometric structure of Pt sites.
          [2] The PtGa catalyst system has also been implemented in production plants (FCDh technique). Recently, Payard et al. investigated the structure-activity relationship over silica-supported PtGa nanoparticles at a molecular level.
          [3] In has also been developed as a promising promoter of Pt-based catalysts. Zha et al. reported that the bimetallic alloy (Pt3In) exhibited a high activity comparable to those of pure Pt and PtSn alloys and a considerable improvement in the propylene selectivity and stability compared to pure Pt.
          [4] Zn is another analogous but economical promoter for Pt-based catalysts. Cybulskis et al. investigated the explicit influence of introducing Zn to the Pt species. The Zn selectively tuned the valence orbitals and the surface electronic structure of Pt, resulting in increased product selectivity and stable catalytic performance.

          Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn, Pt-Ga, and Pt-Zn for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing how these promoters can modulate the electronic structure, geometric structure, and ensemble effects of Pt to improve catalytic performance and stability. Specific examples include Pt-Sn helping inhibit coke formation, Pt-Ga improving dispersion and stability, and Pt-Zn tuning the valence orbitals of Pt to increase selectivity.

          [1] Sn is a widely utilized promoter for Pt catalysts. Alloying Pt with Sn can significantly alter the electronic and geometric structure of Pt sites. The electronic effects are reflected in the reduction in the d band of Pt sites and the adjustment of reaction barriers, effectively reducing the coke formation.
          [2] The PtGa catalyst system has also been implemented in production plants (FCDh technique). Recently, Payard et al. investigated the structure-activity relationship over silica-supported PtGa nanoparticles at a molecular level. It was found that the presence of Ga could reduce the sintering of Pt sites by enhancing the interaction between the support and nanoparticles, increasing the dispersion of Pt, and accelerating the mobility of surface atoms. 
          [3] In has also been developed as a promising promoter of Pt-based catalysts. Zha et al. reported that the bimetallic alloy (Pt3In) exhibited a high activity comparable to those of pure Pt and PtSn alloys and a considerable improvement in the propylene selectivity and stability compared to pure Pt. The role of In was to promote electron transfer from In to Pt, which impacted the adsorption energy of propylene.
          [4] Zn is another analogous but economical promoter for Pt-based catalysts. Cybulskis et al. investigated the explicit influence of introducing Zn to the Pt species. The Zn selectively tuned the valence orbitals and the surface electronic structure of Pt, resulting in increased product selectivity and stable catalytic performance.

          Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metals in Pt alloy catalysts. It provides examples like Sn reducing the Pt d-band center and transferring electrons to Pt, altering reaction barriers. In and Zn also modulate the electronic properties of Pt through electron transfer, impacting product adsorption energies and selectivity. The secondary metals also help disperse Pt sites.

          Yes, the article briefly describes some synergistic effects between metals in bimetallic catalysts. For example, it states that Sn alloying with Pt impacts both the electronic structure and geometric dispersion of Pt sites.
