<quotes>
[1] "Currently, albeit with the favorable thermodynamic condition achieved in the oxidative propane dehydrogenation (OPDH) approach, a poor propane utilization ratio and low propylene yield are usually detected on account of the complex reaction atmosphere." 

[2] "In contrast, the nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique with simple reaction components has already been put into industrial production."

[3] "CrOx-based catalysts, the catalytic activity of which originates from the Lewis acid sites, are usually preferable because of the low production cost." 

[4] "With regard to Pt-based catalysts, although metallic Pt is broadly identified as a promising PDH catalyst due to its environmental amiability and excellent affinity to CH bonds on alkanes, the rapid deactivation of catalytic activity induced by sintering and coke and the high production cost are still big challenges."

[5] "In addition to adjustment of the reaction conditions, many strategies in catalyst design have been proposed, making big steps in the development of the PDH process."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article introduces CrOx-based catalysts and Pt-based catalysts as two major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation. CrOx catalysts are preferable due to low cost but have issues with deactivation. Pt-based catalysts have good activity but high cost and deactivation issues. Strategies in catalyst design are needed to address these challenges.
