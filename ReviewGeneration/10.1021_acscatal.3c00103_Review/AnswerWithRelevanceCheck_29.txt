      [1] "The dealuminated Beta zeolite, named SiBeta, was identified as an excellent support on account of the existence of the vacant Al sites and the generated SiOH nests." 

      [2] "After the impregnation process and the subsequent calcination process under an air atmosphere, Co compounds were successfully confined into the hydroxyl nests of the SiBeta support, as confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure 6i)."

      [3] "Isolated Ga3+ sites with outstanding antireduction ability that were derived from the establishment of GaO bonds were obtained by grafting Ga(CH2CH(CH3)2) on fully dehydrated and partially dehydrated γ-Al2O3 and SiO2."

    <English>
      Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It discusses dealuminating Beta zeolite to generate vacant Al sites and SiOH nests to anchor isolated metal sites. Examples include grafting gallium precursors onto dehydrated Al2O3 and SiO2 to achieve isolated Ga3+ sites, and confining Co species into hydroxyl nests of dealuminated SiBeta zeolite.

      [1] "PtSn nanoparticles encapsulated in K-MFI zeolite was synthesized via a one-pot direct synthesis using H2[PtCl6] and SnCl4·5H2O as precursors."

      [2] "After modulating the interaction between Pt and Sn through the introduction of partially reduced Sn species by adjusting the H2 treatment time, the PtSn nanoclusters were encapsulated in the 10R sinusoidal channels of S-1 zeolite, as determined by a combination of high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-HAADF-STEM) and iDPC imaging." 

      [3] "This catalyst exhibited high stability and only slight propane conversion deactivation from 20% to 17% after 70 h."

    <English>
      Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides examples of encapsulating PtSn nanoparticles and nanoclusters in K-MFI and S-1 zeolites, respectively. Data shows only slight deactivation (20% to 17% propane conversion) over 70 hours for the PtSn nanoclusters encapsulated in S-1. The encapsulation helps stabilize the active metal sites.

      是的,该文评估了在分子筛载体中金属的封装来增强丙烷脱氢催化剂的稳定性。它分别提供了在K-MFI和S-1分子筛中封装PtSn纳米粒子和纳米簇的示例。数据显示封装在S-1中的PtSn纳米簇在70小时内仅略微失活(丙烷转化率从20%下降到17%)。封装有助于稳定活性金属位点。

      [1] "PtREE alloys were successfully incorporated into a siliceous MFI zeolite with surface skeleton defects (silanol nests) via a coimpregnation process followed by calcination under an O2 flow and subsequent H2 treatment."

      [2] "Co compounds were successfully confined into the hydroxyl nests of the SiBeta support, as confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy."

      [3] "The hydroxyl nests on the zeolite framework derived from the dealumination of Beta zeolite provided an anchoring effect to construct highly dispersed and stabilized Zn species that served as the anchoring sites for the Pt species."
    </Quotes>
    
    <English>
      Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like confining active species into zeolite defects/hydroxyl nests, stabilizing isolated metal sites in zeolite frameworks through metal-support bonding, and anchoring active metals in dealuminated zeolites. Examples include incorporating PtREE alloys in MFI zeolites with silanol nests, confining Co compounds in hydroxyl nests of SiBeta, and anchoring PtZn species in dealuminated Beta. These methods help disperse and stabilize the active sites.

      是的,该文研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它讨论了将活性物质限制在分子筛缺陷/羟基巢穴中、通过金属支撑键稳定分子筛框架中的隔离金属位点以及在去铝分子筛中锚定活性金属等技术。示例包括在具有硅醇巢穴的MFI分子筛中掺入PtREE合金,在SiBeta的羟基巢穴中限制Co化合物,以及在去铝Beta分子筛中锚定PtZn物种。这些方法有助于活性位点的分散和稳定。
