[1] The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism proposed in 1934 is a widely acknowledged mechanism to describe the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process, dividing the whole process into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2.

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing active sites that can adsorb propane and activate C-H bonds through mechanisms like the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. This mechanism has three key steps: dissociative adsorption of propane with elimination of H, extraction of a β-H to form a C=C double bond, and desorption of propylene.

[1] The PDH reaction is a catalytic dehydrogenation process to convert propane to propylene, as shown in reaction 1: 

C3H8 → C3H6 + H2 (Δ298=124.3kJ/mol)  

[2] To have a comprehensive understanding of the whole process, the main endothermic side reactions that may happen are also listed as follows:

C3H8 → CH4 + C2H4 (Δ298=98.9kJ/mol) 

C3H8 → 3C + 4H2 (Δ298=119.5kJ/mol)

[3] It can be observed that the primary reaction (reaction 1) is a thermodynamically limited endothermic process with an increase in the number of gas molecules, indicating that a high temperature (823-973 K) coupled with moderately low partial pressure (1 bar) is necessary to achieve desirable thermodynamic equilibrium.

4. The article discusses thermodynamic constraints, explaining that propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction that requires high temperatures of 823-973 K and moderately low pressures around 1 bar to achieve equilibrium conversion. It also notes that side reactions like cracking are endothermic, and provides the reaction enthalpies of the main reaction and side reactions.
