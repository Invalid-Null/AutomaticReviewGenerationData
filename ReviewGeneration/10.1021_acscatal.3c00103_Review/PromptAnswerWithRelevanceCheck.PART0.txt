[1] CrOx-based catalysts, the catalytic activity of which originates from the Lewis acid sites, are usually preferable because of the low production cost.

[2] With regard to Pt-based catalysts, although metallic Pt is broadly identified as a promising PDH catalyst due to its environmental amiability and excellent affinity to CH bonds on alkanes, the rapid deactivation of catalytic activity induced by sintering and coke and the high production cost are still big challenges.  

[3] With the further development of the PDH technique, an array of alternative catalysts, including Fe, Co, ZnOx, VOx, GaOx, and ZrOx, have also been explored as economical, environmentally friendly, and efficient alternatives, which can be roughly classified into two sorts: metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts.

[1] To have a comprehensive understanding of the whole process, the main endothermic side reactions that may happen are also listed as follows: 

C3H8 → CH4 + C2H4 (ΔH298 = 98.9 kJ/mol) 

C3H8 → 3C + 4H2 (ΔH298 = 119.5 kJ/mol)

It can be observed that the primary reaction (reaction 1) is a thermodynamically limited endothermic process with an increase in the number of gas molecules, indicating that a high temperature (823–973 K) coupled with moderately low partial pressure (1 bar) is necessary to achieve desirable thermodynamic equilibrium.

[1] The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism proposed in 1934 is a widely acknowledged mechanism to describe the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process, dividing the whole process into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2.  

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing active sites that can adsorb propane and activate C-H bonds through mechanisms like the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. This mechanism has three key steps: dissociative adsorption of propane with elimination of H, extraction of a β-H to form a C=C double bond, and desorption of propylene.

[2] The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.  

[3] CrOx-based catalysts, the catalytic activity of which originates from the Lewis acid sites, are usually preferable because of the low production cost. However, the intrinsic toxicity of CrOx species along with the severe side reactions greatly impedes the application in industrial production.

[5] Thermal-induced deactivation of PDH catalysts is a significant problem that can arise from several processes, including (I) coke formation, (II) sintering, and (iii) loss of active compounds.

[6] Coke deposition can occur on both the active compounds and the support surface, ultimately leading to catalytic deactivation by impeding mass transfer and poisoning the active sites.
