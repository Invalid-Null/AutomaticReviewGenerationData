      [1] "The dealuminated Beta zeolite, named SiBeta, was identified as an excellent support on account of the existence of the vacant Al sites and the generated SiOH nests."
      
      [2] "PtGa alloys supported on mesoporous silica SBA-15 were designed as an active and stable catalyst for PDH."
      
      [3] "After the impregnation process and the subsequent calcination process under an air atmosphere, Co compounds were successfully confined into the hydroxyl nests of the SiBeta support, as confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure 6i)."

      Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It discusses dealumination of Beta zeolite to generate vacant Al sites and SiOH nests that can anchor and isolate active metal sites. Examples include incorporating Ga species into the SiBeta framework to achieve single Ga sites stabilized by the zeolite, and confining Co compounds in hydroxyl nests of dealuminated SiBeta.

      [1] "A catalyst consisting of nanometric bimetallic PtSn clusters encapsulated in K-MFI zeolite was synthesized via a one-pot direct synthesis using H2[PtCl6] and SnCl4·5H2O as precursors.140 After modulating the interaction between Pt and Sn through the introduction of partially reduced Sn species by adjusting the H2 treatment time, the PtSn nanoclusters were encapsulated in the 10R sinusoidal channels of S-1 zeolite, as determined by a combination of high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-HAADF-STEM) and iDPC imaging. This catalyst exhibited high stability and only slight propane conversion deactivation from 20% to 17% after 70 h."

      Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides examples of encapsulating PtSn nanoparticles and nanoclusters in zeolites like K-MFI, S-1, and SiBeta. The encapsulated catalysts show high stability, with very low deactivation rates on the order of 0.02 h-1 over 70+ hours of propane dehydrogenation. The zeolite encapsulation stabilizes the metal clusters.

      [1] "Pt has already been recognized as an effective catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to its high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. As discussed above, the PDH reaction is a structure-insensitive reaction whose kinetics is independent of the Pt particle size, while the side reactions are usually structure-sensitive reactions that are dependent on the particle size of Pt and the exposed crystal faces. Small-sized and highly dispersed Pt particles are usually preferable for the PDH reaction due to their considerable catalytic activity and high selectivity toward propylene."
      
      [2] "A precise molecular approach, surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), can make use of the organic groups (usually hydroxyl groups) on the support and graft metal active sites on the support by the formation of strong covalent MO bonds."
      
      [3] "Isolated Ga3+ sites with outstanding antireduction ability that were derived from the establishment of GaO bonds were obtained by grafting Ga(CH2CH(CH3)2) on fully dehydrated and partially dehydrated γ-Al2O3 and SiO2."
