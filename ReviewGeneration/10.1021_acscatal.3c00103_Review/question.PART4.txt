Design Strategies of Stable Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation to Propylene
Abstract
Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry. Traditional propylene production, which is based on oil-based cracking processes, is being challenged by the drastic changes in the global energy situation. The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene. Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem. Substantial progress has been made to inhibit the deactivation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts. In this review, we briefly introduce the mechanism of catalytic deactivation, including coke deposition and sintering of active compounds. The design strategies of PDH catalysts, focused on improving the catalytic stability and recyclability, are highlighted from the aspects of active site regulation, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification. Finally, the current status and prospects of future catalyst development are also discussed.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propylene, underpinning many highly valued products (polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and acetone), has a big industrial demand for the foreseeable future. (14) Thereinto, polypropene with high chemical durability and elasticity can be applied in various sectors like construction and packaging. Noteworthily, during the epidemic of COVID-19, polypropene has been playing an important role in the fabrication of protective equipment. The explosive growth of propylene consumption, coupled with the soaring oil price, makes it difficult for traditional techniques (fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil and steam cracking of naphtha) to satisfy the demand. (5,6) The propane dehydrogenation technique has been considered a novel and promising route to produce propylene in the context of the appearance of abundant propane resources from the exploitation of shale gas. (7) Currently, albeit with the favorable thermodynamic condition achieved in the oxidative propane dehydrogenation (OPDH) approach, a poor propane utilization ratio and low propylene yield are usually detected on account of the complex reaction atmosphere. (8) In contrast, the nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique with simple reaction components has already been put into industrial production. Until now, several main industrial processes for propane dehydrogenation have been successfully commercialized, among which the Catofin and Oleflex techniques are widely planted around the world. (5,6,9) In detail, the Catofin process utilizing 58 parallel adiabatic fixed bed reactors was developed using CrOx-based catalysts, while the Oleflex process using fluidized bed reactors instead runs with Pt-based catalysts. CrOx-based catalysts, the catalytic activity of which originates from the Lewis acid sites, are usually preferable because of the low production cost. However, the intrinsic toxicity of CrOx species along with the severe side reactions greatly impedes the application in industrial production. With regard to Pt-based catalysts, although metallic Pt is broadly identified as a promising PDH catalyst due to its environmental amiability and excellent affinity to CH bonds on alkanes, the rapid deactivation of catalytic activity induced by sintering and coke and the high production cost are still big challenges. With the further development of the PDH technique, an array of alternative catalysts, including Fe, (10,11) Co, (12,13) ZnOx, (14,15) VOx, (1618) GaOx, (19,20) and ZrOx, (21) have also been explored as economical, environmentally friendly, and efficient alternatives, which can be roughly classified into two sorts: metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts. Besides, several types of supports have been explored, among which oxide supports (Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 and zeolites have been widely applied. Some catalysts with high catalytic activity often suffer from rapid deactivation and poor regeneration ability on account of coke accumulation and/or sintering of active compounds under the high temperature required in the reaction and regeneration processes. (2224) Coke deposition can occur on both the active compounds and th esupport surface, ultimately leading to catalytic deactivation by impeding mass transfer and poisoning the active sites. Sintering is a process where the supported active compounds agglomerate via a particle migration and coalescence process or the Ostwald ripening process into bigger particles. (25,26) Coke formation, coupled with the sintering behavior, is usually inevitable, resulting in an inexorable catalytic deactivation. The regeneration process is necessary to restore the catalytic activity and is commonly performed in an air atmosphere under high temperatures for the oxidative removal of coke. Besides, Cl2 is usually brought in to help the redispersion of the sintered active compounds in industrially utilized Pt-based catalysts.
To alleviate the catalytic deactivation and increase the potential for practical applications, plentiful researchers have been dedicated to transforming this situation and have already thought out certain optimized strategies. In practical propylene production, hydrogen as a cofeeding gas has been utilized to inhibit the deactivation rate, obviously improving the stability of Pt-based catalysts. (27) On the one hand, the desorption barrier of propylene can be reduced; on the other hand, metallic active sites can be preserved with the existence of hydrogen. However, increasing the partial pressure of hydrogen could result in a lower propane conversion and a higher financial input. In parallel to hydrogen, carbon dioxide as a mild oxidative cofeeding gas can help inhibit the aggregation of coke precursors on the catalyst surface and resist the reduction of active metal oxides under the reductive atmosphere during the PDH process. (28,29) In addition to adjustment of the reaction conditions, many strategies in catalyst design have been proposed, making big steps in the development of the PDH process.
Driven by passionate scientific interests and practical demands, a series of reviews have been published to summarize previous studies, yet these mainly focus on comprehensive summaries of the PDH reaction or the introduction of various catalytic systems. (3,5,6,30) Consequently, a review of the strategies for enhancing catalytic stability is necessary and informative. This review will precede a comprehensive introduction of catalytic deactivation factors with a brief description of the fundamental mechanism of the PDH reaction. Then we will scientifically and systematically summarize the latest representative advances in approaches for achieving eximious catalytic stability. Various design strategies are usually entangled and may have different effects on the catalytic performance depending on different catalytic systems. We endeavor to deconvolute the complicated catalytic systems that may interlace more than one synthetic strategy to understand how these strategies function. This section focusing on catalyst design will be divided into three parts: promoter introduction, metalsupport interaction enhancement, and support modification. Finally, the challenges and prospects of the current status of catalyst synthesis are also discussed.
2. The Mechanisms of Deactivation
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism proposed in 1934 is a widely acknowledged mechanism to describe the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process, dividing the whole process into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2. (31) However, whether the dissociative adsorption process or the extraction of the β-H is the rate-controlling step of PDH process remains to be confirmed. (3236)
With regard to the thermodynamics, the PDH reaction is a catalytic dehydrogenation process to convert propane to propylene, as shown in reaction 1:

It can be observed that the primary reaction (reaction 1) is a thermodynamically limited endothermic process with an increase in the number of gas molecules, indicating that a high temperature (823973 K) coupled with moderately low partial pressure (1 bar) is necessary to achieve desirable thermodynamic equilibrium. However, propylene with the unsaturated CC bond is more reactive than propane, causing the practical operating environment to be more complex. Side reactions, including hydrogenolysis, deep dehydrogenation, polymerization, isomerization, and coke formation, may coexist within the PDH process. The complex network of surface reactions in the PDH process over a Pt-based catalyst has been investigated, as presented in Figure 1. (37) The harsh reaction conditions required in the PDH process can be important incentives for those endothermic side reactions (reactions 2 and 3), which reduce the propylene selectivity and further contribute to catalytic deactivation.

The thermal-induced deactivation of PDH catalysts is a significant problem that can arise from several processes, including (I) coke formation, (II) sintering, and (III) loss of active compounds.
2.1. Coke Formation
Although the PDH technique has been commercialized for decades and demonstrated desirable catalytic activity with high propylene selectivity, coke deposition as the dominant reason for the deactivation of PDH catalysts is still a big challenge for further industrial application. (38) At high reaction temperatures, the undesirable formation of various adsorptive carbocation intermediates can be attributed to negative contributions by active components in detrimental states or inappropriate support acidity. Due to their higher reactivity compared to paraffinic compounds, alkenes can readily undergo reactions with these intermediates, contributing to the growth of hydrocarbon species and ultimately resulting in coke formation. The intuitive representation of coke generation is the blackening of PDH catalysts. Coke deposition can severely undermine the catalytic stability and activity by covering or poisoning active sites and blocking the pore structure. The specific effect brought by coke accumulation significantly depends on the catalytic system and the location of coke deposition. In Pt-based catalysts, coke accumulation is commonly initiated by the large Pt ensembles located on the catalyst surface. This can subsequently result in a downshift of the Pt d band by coke deposited over Pt atoms, which curbs the CH bond activation ability and leads to reduced catalytic activity. During coke formation in metal oxide-based catalysts, the cracking reaction of the hydrocarbon species (especially the alkenes that are strongly adsorbed on the active sites) can be catalyzed by the Brnsted acid sites, which induces the deposition and extension of coke on the catalyst surface. The coke deposition can impede the contact between the Lewis acid sites and the reactant, further changing the catalytic properties. It is worth noting that although coke deposition on the catalyst surface is typically detrimental to catalytic performance, it can also have some positive effects in some cases. The accumulation of clad coke on the catalyst surface can result in an improvement of propylene selectivity to some extent due to the alteration in electronic structure of active sites and a consequent increase in the energy barrier for deep dehydrogenation. (39,40) The process of coke formation is very complicated. Su et al. divided the coke evolution of the PDH process into two stages, quick deactivation and steady state, through a first-principles density functional theory (DFT)-based kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation. (37) In the quick deactivation stage, the availability of active sites was hindered by the coverage of coke precursors on the catalyst surface. After the quick deactivation stage, active sites and clad surface species became stable, leading to lower activity but higher and more stable selectivity.
Coke can deposit on both the support surface and active metal sites. (41) The distribution of coke on a Pt-based catalyst was investigated through temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis. (42) Two different peaks were detected, ascribed to the coke deposited on the metal sites, which was responsible for the catalytic deactivation, and the graphitic coke deposited on the support, which was harder to remove but had a relatively lower impact on the catalytic performance. When it comes to metal oxide-based catalysts, the coke deposition on a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst was investigated by operando Raman spectroscopy, which also manifested two different distributions. The structure and formation of coke on the alloyed Pt sites over a PtSn/Al2O3 catalytic system were also studied. (43) Several C3 species, including propyl, propylidene, and propylidyne, were detected by Raman spectroscopy (Figure 2a) and infrared spectroscopy (Figure 2b) on the surface of the PtSn alloy (Figure 2c). While the precursors of coke may have diverse compositions, they all seem to originate from the process of deep dehydrogenation. Elementary steps involved in the PDH process over Pt-based catalysts were studied through DFT calculations aiming to identify the precursors of coke. (44) As the sole C3 derivative that prefers cleavage of the CC bond to CH bond breaking, propyne is supposed to be the initial point to start CC cracking. Saerens et al. analyzed the consecutive reaction path from propane to coke precursors under simulated reaction conditions (H2/C3H8 inlet ratio = 1.25) (Figure 2d). (45) The dominant reaction path for the side reactions is the formation of propylene via deep dehydrogenation of 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl. Sequentially, during the CC scission of propyne, which has a high turnover frequency (TOF) (284 s1, which is 47% of the net propane adsorption rate) and is identified as the rate-controlling step of side reactions, the most important coke precursors (ethylidyne (CCH3) and methylidyne (CH)) are generated.

The process of coke formation is complicated, involving complex surface reactions and various intermediates in the PDH process. Several models were established to describe the kinetics of coke formation. (46,47) Up front, abundant experimental data indicated that the coke yield on the catalyst surface was approximately a logarithmic function of the reaction time. A monolayer coke growth model was proposed based on this accumulating behavior and with consideration of the catalytic deactivation, and it was believed that the coke formation rate depended on the number of free active sites, which evinced a certain amount of feasibility. After this, the monolayermultilayer coke growth model as a widely accepted model developed a relationship between the catalyst activity and the total catalyst coke content. (48) This model accepted the monolayer of coke deposition and believed that the formation rate of multilayer coke was well related to the formed monolayer coke. Although several models are effective to a certain extent, the whole process of coke formation is still too hard to fully understand and describe due to the complicated types of coke formed under intricate reaction conditions and in different catalyst systems.
2.2. Sintering
Pt-based catalysts as the most representative metal-based catalysts are confronted with severe deactivation arising from metal sintering. (49) Generally, the PDH reaction is a structure-insensitive reaction whose analytical dynamics are unrelated to the size of Pt particles. (50) Nevertheless, side reactions, including cracking, hydrogenolysis, deep dehydrogenation, and hydrogenation, are structure-sensitive ones and can be activated by the PtPt ensemble effect. (51) The collective PtPt bonds play a crucial role in inducing the CC cracking during the PDH process, which can significantly impact the selectivity and overall stability of the catalyst. Thus, highly dispersed Pt sites are commonly identified as selective and efficient active sites (Figure 2e). (52) However, small-sized Pt particles with high surface energy tend to agglomerate into large particles at high reaction temperatures during the PDH process. (5355) The sintering-caused shrinkage of surface area causes a rapid reduction in catalytic activity, while Pt assemblies with diverse structures and particle sizes lead to the generation of undesired side products, decreasing propylene selectivity, and finally overall catalyst deactivation.
Two operative mechanisms have been suggested to understand the growth of the nanoparticles, including the Ostwald ripening (OR) mechanism and the particle migration and coalescence (PMC) mechanism. (56,57) The OR mechanism usually applies to nanoparticles with distinguishing sizes. Mobile components can diffuse from smaller particles to larger ones nearby due to different surface energies, forming large metal particles. (58) Meantime, the PMC mechanism usually describes the sintering behavior of nanoparticles with approximately equal sizes on the catalyst surface through particle coalescence driven by Brownian motion. The sintering behavior of Ni over MgAl2O4 was studied to identify whether OR or OMC functions. (26) The process of sintering was divided into three phases (Figure 2f): (I) rapid loss in surface area; (II) sintering slowing down; (III) reaching a stable state. A combination of in situ transmission electron microscopy and Monte Carlo simulations indicated that OR, which dominated the rapid loss of Pt dispersion in Phase I and existed in the whole sintering process, was the dominant process causing the growth of nanoparticle size.
At present, the mechanism of the sintering process is still ambiguous. Grain-boundary diffusion, viscous flow, plastic deformation, and surface tension gradients are also important factors in the sintering of different particles and need further research.
2.3. Loss of Active Components
The high temperature required for the PDH reaction and subsequent generation processes may induce volatilizing and leaching of catalytic components, especially when the temperature exceeds the Tammann temperature. (59) Zn has been proven as a promising promoter for Pt-based catalysts and is prone to volatilize during the reaction process on account of its low melting point. A detailed study of the reasons for deactivation in a PtZn/MFI zeolite catalytic system was reported. (60) The deep dehydrogenation and coke formation could be greatly suppressed, as confirmed by thermogravimetric analysisdifferential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis on the spent and fresh catalysts revealed the obvious loss of Zn, which possessed great consistency with the reduction of the Zn signal in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum (Figure 2g). It turned out that the key reason was not the coke formation but rather the Pt sintering due to the volatility of the Zn promoter under hyperthermic conditions. In terms of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, the decrease in their dehydrogenation activity usually results from coke deposition in the single-pass PDH process. However, it is observed that the initial catalytic performance cannot be completely restored after oxidative removal of coke, which indicates that irreversible deactivation occurs. During each regeneration process, the migration of chromium ions into the support, coupled with the entrapment of the chromium species inside the bulk of alumina, caused the reduction of catalytically active chromium species, which was responsible for the formation of inactive alumina-incorporated chromium species and further irreversible deactivation (Figure 2h). (61) When it comes to VOx-based catalysts, the reactive V2+/V3+ species can agglomerate and be oxidized to form large V2O5 crystallites, which possess the lower catalytic activity and cannot easily be reduced into active polymeric vanadium species under normal reaction conditions. (62) Besides, the generation of hydrogen during the PDH process makes the atmosphere strongly reductive, which makes this situation more complicated. During the PDH catalytic process, the active sites in the oxidized state may be reduced into lower oxidation states or even the metallic state reversibly and/or irreversibly. For instance, in the CoOx-based catalysts, tetracoordinate Co(II) species formed at low Co loading and large Co3O4 crystallites at high Co loading could be reduced to metallic Co particles, which can catalyze cracking reactions and easily migrate on the supports. (63)
3. Strategies for Catalytic Stability Enhancement
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Although the direct dehydrogenation technique has been industrialized, the fabrication of the corresponding catalysts is still confronted with a series of plights. The design of supported metal catalysts is significantly important. Decades have witnessed the efforts made and strategies proposed by devoted researchers to optimize the catalyst performance and improve the catalytic stability from a wide panorama. In this section, strategies focused on catalytic stability enhancement in recently reported works are summarized.
3.1. Introducing Promoters
Effectively regulating the active compounds in both Pt-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts can be achieved by soundly introducing promoters. Promoters can greatly impact the catalytic behaviors in PDH catalysts, showing advantages in suppression of side reactions, inhibition of coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds and so on. In this section, promoters for Pt-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts are summed up (Table 1) with the sharp revelation of the functional mechanisms.

3.1.1. Pt-Based Catalysts
Metallic Pt has already been recognized as an effective catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to its high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. As discussed above, the PDH reaction is a structure-insensitive reaction whose kinetics is independent of the Pt particle size, while the side reactions are usually structure-sensitive reactions that are dependent on the particle size of Pt and the exposed crystal faces. Small-sized and highly dispersed Pt particles are usually preferable for the PDH reaction due to their considerable catalytic activity and high selectivity toward propylene. (64,65) Aguilar-Rios et al. investigated the relationship between the catalytic activity and the Pt dispersion and found that the dehydrogenation activity was enhanced along with the increase of Pt dispersion. (66) Pt particles with different exposed lattice planes usually manifest distinct catalytic behaviors. (67) Definitely, Pt particles with the exposed (211) surface have higher CH activation ability, while Pt particles with the exposed (111) surface exhibit higher selectivity resulting from the low binding energy to propylene. (50)
Currently, adding metal promoters to form alloys or intermetallic compounds is one of the most effective methods to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation in Pt-based catalytic systems. As is generally acknowledged, these promoters are believed to exert geometric and electronic effects pivotally to active components. (6871) Metal promoters can inhibit the aggregation of active sites and reduce the number of neighboring Pt atoms within the assembles, and the electron transfer they provide can tune the electronic properties of central sites, increasing the energy barriers of deep dehydrogenation and adjusting the ability to adsorb propylene.
Sn is a widely utilized promoter for Pt catalysts. Alloying Pt with Sn can significantly alter the electronic and geometric structure of Pt sites. (30,7274) The electronic effects are reflected in the reduction in the d band of Pt sites and the adjustment of reaction barriers, effectively reducing the coke formation. Singh et al. found that after alloying with Sn, the Pt d band became narrower and moved down relative to the Fermi energy level, which resulted in lower adsorption of the hydrocarbons and hydrogen. (75,76) Unlike Pt alone, the energy barrier of propylene dehydrogenation increased with a lower barrier for propylene desorption, indicating that the addition of Sn could help to achieve higher catalytic selectivity (Figure 3a,b). (77) Furthermore, through the confirmation of X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra presented in Figure 3c,d, it is typically observed that electron transfer from Sn to Pt occurs after alloying of Pt with Sn. (78) The geometric effect is reflected in the improvement of the Pt dispersion and antisintering ability. A detailed segregation role of Sn in PtSn catalysts was investigated by employing an acid etching technique for the simulation of Sn species loss on the PtSn alloy surface and the structure evolution of coreshell particles. (79) It was shown that this PtSn alloy surface could recover completely due to the migration of Sn atoms from the core to the shell, which was a pivotal property for obtaining highly stable and renewable catalysts. Besides, DFT calculations performed at the atomic level investigated the relationship between the segregation energy (the energy needed for the migration of Sn atoms from the core to the surface) and the number of Sn on the surface and indicated that the PtSn surface particle is recoverable and thermodynamically preferable due to the Sn segregation. Though the PtSn catalysts have already been applied in commercial production for decades, stability improvement is still possible and necessary in this field. Recently, a SiO2-supported PtSn nanoparticle catalyst that could operate the PDH reaction at thermodynamically limited conversion levels was reported. (80) The key was the premixing of the metallic precursors (chloroplatinic acid and tin(II) chloride with a proper ratio) to form a heterometallic PtSn coordination complex that could maintain the atomic mixing of Pt and Sn during reduction and catalytic operation. The electron transfer from Sn to Pt increased the local electron density of Pt, strengthened the local Coulombic repulsion, and lowered the electron binding energy, while the geometric effect conferred by the Sn addition effectively reduced the ambient PtPt ensembles and elevated the anticoking ability. The prepared PtSn/SiO2 was stable and could operate at the thermodynamic selectivity to propylene (>99%) during a 30 h PDH reaction with a low deactivation rate (0.003), which was derived from the reasonable introduction of Sn. In our previous work, a Pt-supported Sn-rich zeolite catalyst was ingeniously designed. (81) After the alloying process, highly dispersed Pt in the form of small PtSn nanoparticles was detected. Besides, the strong electronic interaction between Sn and Pt formed Pt sites in an electron-rich state that were more reactive and selective than mono-Pt sites, as proved by the deviation of the binding energy of Sn and Pt in XPS spectra. The prepared PtSn catalyst exhibited superb catalytic durability on account of its excellent coke-resistant ability and outstanding cycling stability with no obvious decrement in the initial catalytic activity after four successive reactionregeneration cycles.

The PtGa catalyst system has also been implemented in production plants (FCDh technique). Recently, Payard et al. investigated the structureactivity relationship over silica-supported PtGa nanoparticles at a molecular level. (82) It was found that the presence of Ga could reduce the sintering of Pt sites by enhancing the interaction between the support and nanoparticles, increasing the dispersion of Pt, and accelerating the mobility of surface atoms. Both Pt and Ga interacted with SiO bonds at the interface between the nanoparticles and the oxide support, contributing to the stability of the PtGa catalyst.
In has also been developed as a promising promoter of Pt-based catalysts. Zha et al. reported that the bimetallic alloy (Pt3In) exhibited a high activity comparable to those of pure Pt and PtSn alloys and a considerable improvement in the propylene selectivity and stability compared to pure Pt. (83) The role of In was to promote electron transfer from In to Pt, which impacted the adsorption energy of propylene.
Zn is another analogous but economical promoter for Pt-based catalysts. (84,85) Cybulskis et al. investigated the explicit influence of introducing Zn to the Pt species. (70) The Zn selectively tuned the valence orbitals (Figure 3e) and the surface electronic structure of Pt (Figure 3f), resulting in increased product selectivity and stable catalytic performance. In another case, PtZn particles supported on H-ZSM-5 were devised and also exhibited excellent stability with no obvious deactivation after a 65 h dehydrogenation reaction on stream (0.011 deactivation rate) as a result of the interaction between Zn and Pt. (86)
Many other metals, including Fe, (8789) Cu, (90,91) and Co, (92) can also be promoters for Pt-based catalysts to adjust the electronic properties and improve the dispersion of Pt atoms for further stability enhancement. A catalyst with PtFe nanoparticles supported on dendritic mesoporous silica was developed and exhibited high propylene selectivity and catalytic activity during a 60 h long-term test. (89) In parallel to Fe, the addition of Cu to a Pt catalyst promoted propylene desorption and inhibited CC cracking, resulting in higher catalytic performance, while the Co could serve as a less active structural promoter to break up large Pt ensembles and thus achieve higher olefin selectivity. (91,92)
Alloying of Pt with rare-earth elements (REEs) has barely been accomplished through the conventional H2 reduction route due to the low chemical potential of REE oxides. Recently, however, supported PtREE alloy nanoparticle catalysts for the PDH reaction were reported. (93) PtREE alloys were successfully incorporated into a siliceous MFI zeolite with surface skeleton defects (silanol nests) (94) via a coimpregnation process followed by calcination under an O2 flow and subsequent H2 treatment (Figure 3g). The PtREE catalysts exhibited a high initial conversion of propane (nearly a thermodynamically limited conversion level) and a long catalytic lifetime. The surface silanol nests on the mesoporous zeolite, which provided a unique local electronic ambiance, stabilized the single-atom REEs through the formation of coordination bonds and further incorporated REEs with Pt to form the PtREE alloy, providing a new insight for developing efficient metal alloy PDH catalysts.
Apart from the intensive attention paid to single-promoter systems, multipromoter systems have also been developed with considerable catalytic performance. Lately, a PtGa catalyst with dual decoration of Pb and Ca was synthesized via a pore-filling coimpregnation method. (95) Briefly, Pb metal that was situated on threefold Pt3 sites could increase the Pt dispersion (Figure 3h) and impose a blocking effect to expose Pt1 sites, which were more selective for propylene (Figure 3i). Meanwhile, the Ca promoters were located between PtGa nanoparticles and the SiO2 support and could donate electrons to Pt. The introduction of Pb and Ca made this catalyst system exhibit outstandingly high catalytic stability for 30 days with no obvious deactivation. Likewise, Qiu et al. selected various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) as second promoters to improve the catalytic stability of a Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst. (96) InPt/Sn-SBA-15 exhibited the best catalytic performance because the In promoter significantly affected the resistance to coke deposition and sintering, improving the catalytic stability.
Subsurface regulation has been demonstrated as a promising method to tune the adsorptive properties with the aim of enhancing the catalytic performance of metal alloys. A series of PtMn intermetallic nanoparticle catalysts with different coreshell structures were synthesized by sequential incipient wetness impregnation. (97) The effect of different subsurface compositions on the catalytic behavior was comprehensively investigated. Compared to the monometallic Pt subsurface, the Pt3Mn intermetallic subsurface exhibited higher CH activation and propylene selectivity due to lower adsorption energy of the surface sites according to DFT calculations and experimental measurements (Figure 3j). Likewise, supported PtGa nanoparticles with different surface and subsurface compositions (Figure 3k) were also investigated. (98) The Pt corePtGa shell alloy supported on MFI zeolite (Pt/Ga-MFI) was prepared by impregnating Pt on Ga-MFI, while the PtGa corePtGa shell alloy catalyst (PtGa/MFI) was prepared by the PtGa coimpregnation method. PtGa/MFI exhibited higher propylene selectivity (Figure 3l) and anticoking ability because the constructed PtGa subsurface effectively increased the electron density of surface Pt and thus promoted propylene desorption.
In summary, introducing metal promoters into the Pt-based catalysts can adjust the geometric and electronic properties of Pt species, significantly improving the catalytic stability. Several metals (Sn, Ga, In, Zn, and Cu) were developed as effective promoters, as discussed above. This provides great opportunities for the sufficient utilization of Pt at the atomic scale and reduction of Pt dosage. However, in practical production, excessive amounts of metal promoters are usually utilized to construct stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, which makes this strategy uneconomical. For instance, during the PDH process, PtSn nanoparticles may separate into Sn and Pt atoms and finally form SnOx and large Pt particles. (3) To avert this situation, large amounts of Sn are usually introduced into Pt-based catalysts (Sn:Pt atomic ratio  4) to help stabilize the PtSn alloy or intermetallic. (99) Thus, there is still a long way to take measures for the reasonable introduction of promoters.
3.1.2. Metal Oxide-Based Catalysts
Supported metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, are other important PDH catalysts and have been extensively studied for decades. (51) The catalytic activity emanates from the Lewis acid MO sites that can effectively activate the CH bonds on alkanes. Unlike Pt-based catalysts, the dehydrogenation pathways strongly depend on their disparate structures and coordination states. Investigations to reveal the nature of the active sites on diverse metal oxide-based catalysts are still ongoing due to the complicated structure of the active compounds. The coke formation rate typically increases with the degree of oxide polymerization in many metal oxide-based catalytic systems, indicating that crystalline bulk oxides are usually not preferred for the dehydrogenation reaction. (17,18,63,100) Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound is an effective approach to improve the dispersion of active species and enhance the catalytic stability under the applied conditions, showing advantages in modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites. (101,102) A series of binary CrZrOx species supported on commercial SiO2 with different Cr and Zr ratios were recently devised. (103) The prepared Cr20Zr80/SiO2 catalyst exhibited splendid catalytic stability with no obvious activity decrease in 50 dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, which was ascribed to the synergy and dilution effects between ZrOx and CrOx species that were generated from the positive impact on the lattice of ZrO2 due to the introduction of Cr. Additionally, the presence of alkali metal and alkaline-earth metal promoters could increase the dispersion of the active phase and help immobilize the oxidative active sites by forming strong interactions. ZnOx-based catalysts have been demonstrated as promising catalysts for PDH reaction, although they suffer from serious volatilization. MgO as a stabilizer was introduced into a ZnOx/S-1 catalyst to control the reaction-induced loss of the active Zn component. (104) The catalytic cyclic stability of ZnOx/S-1(1.0 Mg) in the PDH reaction was improved, and no obvious loss in catalytic activity was observed after six reaction/regeneration cycles compared with the MgO-free sample (Figure 4a) on account of the inhibitory effect on the loss of ZnOx species derived from the formation of stable ZnOMg bonds (Figure 4b) as confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. In addition, the introduction of MgO did not affect the intrinsic activity and phase of ZnOx species (Figure 4c,d).

Another effective approach to improve the dehydrogenation performance is to regulate metal oxides with noble metals. A trace amount of Pt-modified ZnO supported on mesoporous Al2O3 catalyst was synthesized, in which the Pt acted as the promoter while Zn2+ species were identified as active sites. (105) It was indicated that ZnO was a strong Lewis acid because the electron transfer from Zn to Pt put ZnO in an electron-deficient state. After the introduction of Pt, higher activity and stability were achieved, which resulted from the inhibition effect on the reduction of zinc oxide. Besides, the achieved accelerated H2 desorption and easier CH activation (Figure 4e,f) significantly improved the selectivity toward propylene. In parallel to the ZnOx-based catalyst, Pt-promoted GaOx/Al2O3 as a highly active, selective, and stable catalyst was also devised for the dehydrogenation of propane. (106) With a mere 1000 ppm Pt addition, high catalytic activity and selectivity coupled with excellent durability were achieved due to the existence of bifunctional active phases. Lately, the intrinsic effect of a Pt-modified GaOx catalyst for propane dehydrogenation with H2 cofeeding was investigated. (107) The presence of Pt promoted the H2 dissociation (Figure 4g) and boosted the formation of a high coverage of surface Gaδ+H species that were more stable and selective to propylene (Figure 4h).
Compared with the studies on metal promoters, there are relatively few reports on metal oxide promoters. Metal oxide and noble metal promoters are commonly used to stabilize the active compounds and adjust the valence of metal oxides for metal oxide-based catalysts. The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal into a catalytic system can greatly enhance the catalytic performance. However, the introduction of an inappropriate metal oxide may suppress the intrinsic activity of the active compound and result in bad PDH performance. Thus, how to select an effective metal oxide reasonably based on different catalytic systems is the key to this design strategy.
3.2. MetalSupport Interaction Enhancement
Enhancing the metalsupport interactions via immobilization of active compounds on well-tailored supports to form stable and well-defined active sites can exert profound effects on catalytic performance and is especially responsible for the activity, selectivity, and stability of solidgas heterogeneous catalysts. (113116) Strong metalsupport interactions can be realized in both chemical and physical ways (Table 2). For the former, stable chemical bonds are usually established, while the latter adopts physical encapsulation to fix the active compounds.

3.2.1. Hydroxyl Anchoring Method
Crystal materials with abundant hydroxyl groups can provide a subtle ambiance to graft metal sites or anchor metal compounds, providing a feasible pathway to fabricate well-tuned materials with various catalytic properties. (117) Controllable incorporation of active compounds on the support can be accomplished by using a hydroxyl anchoring approach (grafting or confining active sites on isolated hydroxyls and/or hydroxyl nests).
A precise molecular approach, surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), can make use of the organic groups (usually hydroxyl groups) on the support and graft metal active sites on the support by the formation of strong covalent MO bonds. (118) Through the selective reaction of hydroxyl groups on tailored supports with specific thermolytic molecular precursors (TMPs), such as metal hydrocarbyls, siloxides, and alkoxides, under high temperatures, highly dispersed metal oxide species can be generated. Surface CrOx species usually exist in the form of different valence states (+6, +5, +4, +3, +2), among which low-valent CrOx species are identified as active and selective sites for propane dehydrogenation. CrOx species with low coordination and uniform valence can be obtained by the adoption of the SOMC approach. A CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with well-defined Cr3+ sites was prepared by grafting a synthesized TMP, [(SiO)Cr(OSi(OtBu)3)3·2THF], on a SiO2 support (Figure 5a) and exhibited considerable catalytic performance compared to an industrial CrOx-based catalyst. (119) The CH bond of propane was activated by the well-established CrO bonds, while the silica-supported Cr3+sites selectively catalyzed the dehydrogenation of small hydrocarbons based on a σ-bond metathesis mechanism.

Analogously to CrOx-based catalysts, GaOx-based catalysts can effectively catalyze propane dehydrogenation, as discussed above. Isolated Ga3+ sites with outstanding antireduction ability that were derived from the establishment of GaO bonds were obtained by grafting Ga(CH2CH(CH3)2) on fully dehydrated and partially dehydrated γ-Al2O3 and SiO2 (Figure 5b). (120) The synthesized Ga/Al2O3 with mononuclear [(AlO)Ga(CH2CH(CH3)2)2O] sites exhibited promising catalytic performance and relatively high durability compared to the Ga/SiO2 catalyst with dinuclear [(SiO)2Ga2(i-Bu)3] sites. Besides, the single-site GaOx catalyst conferred by the SOMC method was found to be more selective and active than the impregnated GaOx catalyst. (121)
In parallel to Cr and Ga, VOx species with high dispersion are usually preferable for propane dehydrogenation and can be prepared through the SOMC approach. With the grafting of an organovanadium complex [V(O)(Mes)3] on two partially dehydroxylated SiO2 supports at 973 and 473 K, two surface VOx species, monopodal [(SiO)V(O)(Mes)2] and bipodal [(SiO)2V(O)(Mes)], were obtained on SiO2700 and SiO2200, respectively (Figure 5c). (122) Despite a relatively unsatisfactory catalytic performance observed for the bipodal species, all of those synthesized surface species sites exhibited higher selectivity and durability than the impregnated V2O5/SiO2 catalyst on account of the formation of isolated V sites.
The SOMC approach can also achieve the precise adjustment of metal-supported catalysts at an atomic level. After processes to graft TMPs on tailored supports and subsequent reduction treatment under high temperature, supported metal catalysts with narrow-size-distribution metallic nanoparticles can be identically prepared. Ultrasmall PtSn nanoparticles stemming from well-defined surface species were prepared to boost the PDH reaction (Figure 5d) through sequential grafting of TMPs (Pt(COD)Me2 and Ph3SnH) on dehydroxylated Al2O3. (123) After the protonolysis reaction of TMPs with hydroxyl groups on the Al2O3 support, [(AlO)Pt(COD)Me] and [(AlO)SnPh3] surface species formed, as confirmed by FTIR and solid-state NMR spectroscopy (Figure 5e,f). A consecutive controllable hydrogenolysis of the prepared surface species resulted in the formation of a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. Compared to PtSn/Al2O3 prepared via wet impregnation, this catalyst from SOMC synthesis exhibited higher PDH performance (37% propane conversion and >99% propylene selectivity at 823 K) (Figure 5g) with excellent catalytic stability (no obvious deactivation in a 72 h PDH reaction) resulting from the existence of the ultrasmall particle size with the uniform size distribution. Bimetallic PtZn catalysts prepared via SOMC have also been achieved, analogously to PtSn catalysts. (124,125) A SiO2-based catalyst supporting PtZn alloy particles with subnanometric size and a uniformly narrow size distribution was synthesized by sequential grafting of [Zn(OSi(OtBu)3)2]2 and [Pt(OSi(OtBu)3)2(COD)] on the surface hydroxyl groups of SiO2 and performing reduction treatments under a H2 atmosphere. (124) The prepared PtZn/SiO2 catalyst exhibited high propylene productivity (up to 703 gC3H6 gPt1 h1) with >98% propene selectivity and excellent durability with a low deactivation rate (kd = 0.0271).
Significantly, zeolites are ideal supports for the PDH reaction with plenty of marvelous traits, including but not limited to their large surface area, ordered channels, and adjustable framework. The formation of hydroxyls on zeolites can result from various synthetic methodologies, including controlling the nature and purity of the used reagents and postsynthesis treatments. (126,127) It is worth noting that the hydroxyl groups on the zeolite support can provide a unique electronic and geometric ambiance, facilitating the anchoring of active compounds and inhibiting catalytic deactivation. The existence of hydroxyl groups during the zeolite formation process can promote the incorporation of active metal sites into the zeolite framework. (128130) The FeS-1 catalyst exhibiting superior durability in olefin dehydrogenation was synthesized by incorporating Fe atoms into the MFI zeolite framework during the zeolite synthesis process. (128) The isolated Fe sites that were stabilized and modulated by the siliceous zeolite framework in the form of FeOSi bonds, as confirmed by UV Raman spectra (Figure 6a) and EXAFS (Figure 6b), possessed excellent antireduction ability (Figure 6c) and contributed to the coke resistance ability and catalytic stability, with no obvious deactivation after 200 h reaction under 873 K (Figure 6d). Hu et al. identically encapsulated Co species in pure-silica MFI zeolite frameworks (Co-MFI) for PDH reaction and subtly studied the local structure and microenvironment of the isolated Co atoms. (130) The location, uniformity, and exact structure of Co active sites were characterized, indicating that the isolated Co active sites existing in a distorted tetrahedral structure of (SiO)2Co(HOSi)2 were located in the T1(7) and T3(9) sites of MFI zeolites (Figure 6e). DFT calculations and deuterium-labeling reactions revealed that the isolated Co motif along with the zeolite microenvironment provided a unique microcircumstance to preactivate propane and a braced structure to stabilize the C3H7* intermediate, jointly realizing highly efficient PDH performance (initial propylene formation rate of 5.05 mmol gcat1 h1 accompanied by 96.7% selectivity and six reaction cycles with no loss in catalytic performance) compared to the impregnated Co/S-1 catalyst.

Post-treatment of peculiar zeolites, dealumination for instance, can help with the generation of hydroxyl nests with infrangibleness typical of the zeolite framework but only a little reduction of the crystal crystallinity due to the formation of vacant T sites in particular orientations. A highly selective Ga/Beta catalyst for the PDH reaction was devised through incorporation of Ga3+ into the zeolite framework and subsequent thermal removal of lattice Zn2+ of a Zn/Beta zeolite under a H2 atmosphere (Figure 6f). (131) The IR spectra demonstrated that well-defined Ga3+ sites were incorporated into the zeolite framework formed during Zn removal (Figure 6g). The dehydrated and tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ in the dezincated BEA lattice promoted the desorption of propylene and H2, resulting in high selectivity toward propylene (Figure 6h).
The dealuminated Beta zeolite, named SiBeta, was identified as an excellent support on account of the existence of the vacant Al sites and the generated SiOH nests. (100,132134) In our previous work, the VOx catalyst prepared through the incipient wetness impregnation method was synthesized as a promising PDH catalyst utilizing the SiBeta zeolite. (100) After a series of operations, including impregnation of NH4VO3 and the subsequent calcination process, unsaturated [VO4] units were finally prepared due to the resounding insertion of V atoms into the SiBeta framework through the formation of VOSi bonds, as confirmed by DR UVvis spectra. These framework VOx species as selective and stable Lewis acid sites originated from the strong electron transfer effect due to the electronic difference between V and Si atoms. Besides, with increasing V loading, the vacant Al sites were gradually occupied by V atoms and finally completely consumed. The VOx species outside of the framework along with Lewis acid sites built a synergetic catalytic effect and achieved considerable propane conversion (40%) and excellent propylene selectivity (95%) with no obvious loss during four reactionregeneration cycles. In parallel to V, a Co/SiBeta catalyst with highly dispersed Co species was prepared via the wet impregnation method. (63) After the impregnation process and the subsequent calcination process under an air atmosphere, Co compounds were successfully confined into the hydroxyl nests of the SiBeta support, as confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure 6i). Compared to the Co/AlBeta catalyst, the prepared Co/SiBeta catalyst presented a higher catalytic performance (57% propane conversion and 96% propylene selectivity at 823 K) with stable catalytic durability and recycling capacity, attributed to the dispersed and confined Co active compounds.
Likewise, the hydroxyl nests on the dealuminated zeolite can be utilized for anchoring bimetallic PtM alloys. Xie et al. synthesized a dealuminated-zeolite-stabilized bimetallic PtZn catalyst through sequential wetness impregnation of Zn and Pt precursors (Zn(NO3)2 and [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2) and the subsequent reduction process (Figure 6j). (60) The hydroxyl nests on the zeolite framework derived from the dealumination of Beta zeolite provided an anchoring effect to construct highly dispersed and stabilized Zn species that served as the anchoring sites for the Pt species. The prepared PtZn/SiBeta catalyst exhibited high selectivity toward propylene (98%) with an ultralow deactivation rate of 0.02 h1 (Figure 6k).
The hydroxyl anchoring method is identified as an effective approach to anchor active compounds for constructing strong metalsupport interactions. Currently, the SOMC method provides a novel approach to achieve the controlled and precise synthesis of PDH catalysts at the atomic level by making full use of well-tailored supports and TMPs. Nevertheless, the complicated fabrication processes of suitable supports with uniform organic groups, coupled with the high-priced TMPs, make it untoward to apply to practical industrial manufacture. When it comes to the dealumination of peculiar zeolites to produce hydroxyl nests. which is considered to be a relatively handy approach, the acid treatment may reduce the zeolite crystallinity, leading to low hydrothermal stability and a high surface diffusion barrier, albeit the holistic zeolite framework is retained. Therefore, developing other effective methods to fabricate and utilize hydroxyl groups is still urgent.
3.2.2. Encapsulation
Physically encapsulating metal or metal oxide assemblies is one of the hottest themes in the construction of stable PDH catalysts, showing advantages in size control, site adjustment, and spatial segmentation. (135) Although the direct encapsulation route may exist in many catalytic systems, encapsulation with zeolites is more representative because of their highly ordered porous structure, high surface area, and unique chemical internal ambiance. (136,137) The special chemical internal environment in the zeolite matrix allows the existence of size-controlled nanoclusters and can impose an encapsulation effect. (138) Active compounds are spatially and electrostatically encapsulated in the zeolite matrix, where all of the catalytic reactions are carried out. Well-entrapped metal oxide sites can also be synthesized during the hydrothermal synthesis process of the zeolite through even blending of the metal precursors into the zeolite gel precursors. With the subsequent reduction process, metal nanoparticles with a uniform and ultrasmall size distribution can be obtained. Recently, ultrasmall Pt particles encapsulated in MCM-22 zeolite were fabricated by using dimethylformamide (DMF) as a capping agent along with the hexadecyltrimethylammonium surfactant to wrap Pt precursors during the swelling process of the lamellar zeolitic precursor of a two-dimensional (2D) zeolite into three-dimensional (3D) zeolite (Figure 7a). (139) After the calcination process to remove the organic surfactant and the subsequent reduction process, atomically distributed Pt atoms, coupled with ultrasmall Pt particles of 0.20.7 nm (Figure 7b), were fabricated, possessing high catalytic activity and stability. The prepared Pt@MCM-22 catalyst, moreover, exhibited excellent cycling stability with 90% of the initial activity retained, compared to retention of less than 60% of the initial activity of the Pt/MCM-22 synthesized by the conventional impregnation method after five reactionregeneration cycles at 823 K (Figure 7c). A catalyst consisting of nanometric bimetallic PtSn clusters encapsulated in K-MFI zeolite was synthesized via a one-pot direct synthesis using H2[PtCl6] and SnCl4·5H2O as precursors. (140) After modulating the interaction between Pt and Sn through the introduction of partially reduced Sn species by adjusting the H2 treatment time, the PtSn nanoclusters were encapsulated in the 10R sinusoidal channels of S-1 zeolite, as determined by a combination of high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-HAADF-STEM) and iDPC imaging. This catalyst exhibited high stability and only slight propane conversion deactivation from 20% to 17% after 70 h.

The ligand-protected direct synthesis method is an advanced synthesis method to encapsulate small clusters into zeolites using metal ligand-stabilized precursors (usually metal coordination complexes) to prepare stable catalysts during the zeolite formation process. (141,142) This method makes full use of the cooperation effect among organic groups, zeolite precursors, and organic structure-orienting agents and can effectively inhibit the deposition of metal hydroxides in an alkaline solution. Besides, this synthesis route can help achieve regioselective encapsulation and prepare ultrasmall nanoclusters. Recently, stable ZnOx species encapsulated in S-1 zeolite were prepared via the ligand-protected method. (143) [Zn(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](OAc)2 was utilized as the Zn precursor. ZnOx species were trapped and efficiently stabilized in S-1 zeolite, in which the partially reduced ZnOx (0 < x < 1) species were identified as the active sites for PDH reaction. This Zn@S-1 catalyst also exhibited high propylene selectivity and renewability. Likewise, encapsulating bimetallic particles into zeolites can also be accomplished by this ligand-protected direct synthesis method. For instance, bimetallic PtZn clusters encapsulated in the S-1 zeolite matrix were designed via the ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method by using [Pt(NH2CH2CH2NH2)2]Cl2 and [Zn(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](OAc)2 as precursors (Figure 7d). (144) After directly reducing the as-prepared catalysts in pure H2 at 673 K without a calcination process in the air for the purpose of suppressing sintering of metal nanoclusters during the calcinationreduction processes, subnanometer and even atomically dispersed bimetallic PtZn species were successfully encapsulated into the five- and six-membered rings of silicalite-1 zeolite, as confirmed by HAADF-STEM (Figure 7e). The formation of PtZn4 significantly enhanced the stability of the Pt particles and induced a superhigh selectivity toward propylene (99.3%). The prepared PtZn4@S-1 catalyst presented no obvious deactivation of catalytic activity after 13000 min on stream without H2 cofeeding on account of the well-remained subnanometer Pt clusters encapsulated in zeolite channels (Figure 7f).
The overlayer deposition method is another effective strategy to encapsulate active sites on the surface of supports, especially for oxide supports. (113) The prepared catalyst with active nanoparticles or nanoclusters can be covered by a protecting layer to stabilize these active compounds. The additional shell can help prevent active sites from aggregation and exert a size limitation effect. To stabilize the PtGa sites, PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst coating silica layers were recently designed. (145) Tetraethyl orthosilicate as the organic silicon source was mixed with the prepared PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts, which were synthesized by coimpregnation using nitrates of Pt and Ga as precursors under continuous stirring. After a series of procedures, including drying and calcination, Si@PtGa/Al2O3 was prepared, as shown in Figure 7g. The silica shell covered the internal and external surface of the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst in amorphous form, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure 7h) and TEM (Figure 7i). The encapsulation of the silica shell provided Pt active sites with a stable coordination environment, enhancing the metalsupport interaction and suppressing the immigration of Pt during the PDH reaction. This catalyst exhibited outstanding catalyst stability with a deactivation rate constant of 0.007 h1 (Figure 7j) compared to the nonshell catalyst because of the strong antisintering abilities deriving from the amorphous silica coating, as confirmed by DRIFT-CO spectra of the fresh (Figure 7k) and spent catalysts (Figure 7l). The atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique can also be used to add metal oxide overcoats for controllable encapsulation of active sites due to its self-limiting surface reaction nature. (146) A stable Pt/Al2O3 catalyst with an Al2O3 overcoat (68 Å thickness) added by the ALD technique was synthesized and achieved the optimal integration of stability and activity. (147) This Al2O3 overcoat binding to the undercoordinated sites on the Pt nanoparticles could effectively prevent Pt nanoparticles from sintering, thus increasing the catalytic stability.
A series of catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with high catalytic performance were designed with the specific function of physical encapsulation. The ligand-protected direct synthesis method helps to accomplish controllable encapsulation of metal or metal oxide clusters into the zeolite matrix on a nanosized or atomic scale on account of the cooperation effect among organic groups. The ALD technique possessing a wide range of application coverage provides an advanced method to encapsulate active compounds that are located on the surface of the support. At the present stage, though great progress has been made to promote the application of these strategies in large-scale industrial production, the complicated production processes and expensive raw materials are still big problems. However, the encapsulation method still has profound significance in future PDH development.
3.3. Support Modification
The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency. In this section, strategies focused on support modification for dehydrogenation catalysts are summarized (Table 3).

3.3.1. Acidity Adjustment
PDH is an acid-sensitive reaction, which signifies that proper acidity of the support is preferable for CH activation and propylene desorption, while unduly strong acidity, on the other hand, can generate a negative impact on the PDH process, possibly leading to CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation. (5,6,148) Al2O3 as a conventional support for many catalytic processes has already been applied to commercial propylene production due to its high specific surface area, excellent chemical stability, and thermodynamic stability for active compound dispersion. (149,150) However, the inappropriate acidity of Al2O3 could lead to hydrogenolysis and polymerization reactions, inducing coke accumulation. The introduction of an alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal is an effective approach to balance the strong acidity of the Al2O3 support and further inhibit catalytic deactivation. (151) Rimaz et al. regulated the acid property of PtGe/Al2O3 catalysts by introducing Ca. (152) NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was carried out to investigate the effect of Ca on the acid properties of the synthesized catalysts and indicated that the amounts of acid centers (strong, medium, and weak) decreased with the incorporation of Ca into the Al2O3 support. High propylene selectivity (98.5% at 873 K) and catalytic stability were obtained due to the decrease of acid centers of Al2O3, which were responsible for side reactions conducive to the formation of coke. The deactivation constant of propane conversion decreased from 0.22 to 0.05 h1, while an increasing residual activity was observed along with the introduction of the Ca promoter.
As for zeolites, the Lewis acid sites are preferable for propane dehydrogenation, while the Brnsted acid sites are inductive factors in catalyzing cleavage reactions. In most aluminosilicate zeolites, extraframework cations are needed to balance the negative charges of [AlO4] units. When the extraframework cations are hydrogen ions, the Brnsted acid sites are generated. Thus, dealumination could be an effective method to reduce the Brnsted acid sites of zeolite supports while creating hydroxyl nests to anchor active sites into the zeolite framework. (100) In parallel to the dealumination, the ion-exchange method and the addition of promoters (such as K, Na, Ca, Zn, and Mg) can also help neutralize the Brnsted acid sites. (153156) Gao et al. applied a mild alkaline treatment process on a ZrAlBeta zeolite to regulate their active sites and found that the Brnsted acid sites were weakened significantly by alkali metal cations. (154) Analogously, Ponomaryov et al. added a large amount of NaCl in the impregnation process of a Pt catalyst and then erased the excess part by washing the calcined catalyst, which efficiently suppressed the zeolite acidity. The prepared Na-modified Pt catalyst exhibited increased catalytic durability and a decreased deactivation rate from 0.175 to 0.078 h1 compared to the non-Na sample. (156)
Generally, adjusting the acid property of the catalyst support by reducing the acidity or changing the acid type can significantly improve the catalytic stability and selectivity toward propylene. However, this strategy may also cause a reduction of catalytic activity. Hu et al. demonstrated that the Brnsted acid sites can play an important role in determining the catalytic performance of CrOx/ZSM-5. (157) A series of Na+ doping experiments were carried out to eliminate the Brnsted acid sites of H-ZSM-5. The activity of the CrOx/ZSM-5 catalyst decreased obviously with the increase of the Na+ doping. Besides, C3H8-TPD indicated that the C3H8 desorption signal of this catalyst also decreased obviously after the Na+ doping. Further investigations thus must be performed to consummate this strategy.
3.3.2. Morphology and Porosity Regulation
For heterogeneous catalysts, one kinetic factor, the diffusion efficiency of the reactants and products, which is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports, should be taken into consideration. (158161) Diffusion limitations imposed by various supports are a bottleneck to achieve stable catalytic activity and also can induce overreaction of the product, leading to low selectivity and further deactivation of catalysts. Several strategies are proposed, focusing on shortening the diffusion path or diffusion resistance, including developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with particular morphologies and high external surfaces, e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, and mesh-shaped structures.
Mesoporous SiO2 and Al2O3 are quintessential classes of supports that are widely utilized in both research and industrial applications on account of their excellent hydrothermal stabilities and large surface areas. Designing oxide supports with particular morphologies is an effective way to further facilitate mass transport. Sheet-shaped Al2O3 was synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal process in which the key step to control the sheetlike morphology is the formation of the shaped boehmite (AlO(OH)) precursor with the assistance of urea, which is utilized to anchor Co2+ species for catalytic propane dehydrogenation. (162) These nanosheets with relatively thin thickness provided a large external surface to expose active Co2+ sites, allowing efficient mass transport and low diffusion limitation. The prepared CoAl2O3 catalysts exhibited high stability and catalytic selectivity toward propylene (>97%). Similarly, single-atom Co supported on SiO2 nanomeshes (Co SAs/SiO2-NMs), synthesized by applying cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a soft template, was devised to boost nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation, as shown in Figure 8a. (163) The prepared Co SAs/SiO2-NMs exhibited higher propylene selectivity (95%) and higher activity (TOF = 196 h1), compared to the common mesoporous SiO2-supported catalyst (83% selectivity and TOF = 49 h1) on account of the sufficient contact of the active sites with the substrates in the nanomesh structure (Figure 8b,c).

Traditional microporous zeolites are outstanding supports for supported metal catalysts due to their thermal stability, chemical stability, and large internal surface area. However, when the reactants and products have similar or larger dimensions than the micropores of zeolites, the narrow channels of microporous zeolites would impose a significant restriction on the mass transport, limiting further applications in catalytic fields. (164) Fabricating nanosized and particularly morphological microporous zeolites could be effective approach to reduce the diffusion length. Nanosized zeolites exhibit high diffusion efficiency due to the short internal diffusion length. (165) Nevertheless, with decreasing zeolite crystal size, lower crystallinity follows. (166) The nonuniformity of the zeolite surface negatively influences the diffusion of molecules adsorbed on the surface due to the high surface barrier. Therefore, it is a challenge to balance the diffusion length and the crystallinity. Earlier, a finned zeolite for enhancement of the mass transport property was synthesized through the epitaxial growth method. (167) PtZn encapsulated in this finned MFI zeolite catalyst was designed for the PDH reaction, exhibiting high catalytic stability on account of its high diffusion efficiency, lower surface barrier, and easier active site accessibility. (168) Different-sized nanozeolites (100, 200, and 400 nm) were also prepared for contrast, among which PtZn@S-1-100 (100 nm zeolite) exhibited irregular surface and low crystallinity differing from others, as shown in Figure 8d. The intracrystalline diffusion and surface barrier of propane were quantified by the intelligent gravimetric analyzer (IGA) (Figure 8f,g), indicating that the surface barrier increased with decreasing crystal size (Figure 8e), and the finned zeolite exhibited the most efficient mass transfer. Moreover, the accessibility of PtZn clusters was characterized by XPS depth profiling via detection of the Pt amount after the same and proper Ar-ion sputtering times, indicating that the PtZn@S-1-Fin catalyst possessed the easier active site accessibility as well.
Traditional mesoporous zeolites possess high diffusion ability and generally low acidity, which give them great potential as competent PDH supports. (169,170) PtGa alloys supported on mesoporous silica SBA-15 were designed as an active and stable catalyst for PDH. (171) Mesoporous SBA-15 increased the dispersion of PtGa nanoparticles and inhibited the further growth of those particles. The PtGa/SAB-15 catalyst with a Pt/Ga molecular ratio of 1:1 exhibited high propane conversion (up to 60%) and selectivity toward propylene (98.2%), even obtaining a propane conversion of 51.6% and a propylene selectivity of 99.5% after 25 h in the PDH stream. However, the amorphous channels of traditional mesoporous zeolites have low hydrothermal stability and weak interactions to fix active compounds, severely limiting their applications in industrial propylene production.
Hierarchical zeolites possessing secondary porosity at the micro and meso levels exhibit fast transport and relatively high hydrothermal stability, combining catalytic properties of microporous and mesoporous zeolites. (172) Applying these hierarchical zeolites provides an effective solution to mass transport limitations and an ideal circumstance to form strong interactions between zeolites and active catalytic phases. Several strategies have been developed to synthesize hierarchical zeolites, which can be mainly summarized as top-down methods and bottom-up methods. The top-down methods are applied to develop hierarchical zeolites via post-treatment procedures (etching away a part of the zeolite through dealumination and desilication or recrystallizing the zeolite crystal), while bottom-up methods usually utilize templates as mesoporogens, including soft templates (surfactants, polymers, and organosilanes) and hard templates (carbon materials, polymers, and biological materials), to develop hierarchical structures during the zeolite synthesis process. Wang et al. designed a series of PtSn/ZSM-5 catalysts in which bimetallic PtSn nanoparticles were confined in hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite synthesized by a desiliconization treatment in NaOH solution with appropriate concentration under mild conditions (Figure 8h). (173) The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of this zeolite exhibited typical adsorption behavior for a hierarchical structure with a representative type-IV isotherm and H3-type hysteresis loop (Figure 8i), while the morphological images of the ZSM-5 zeolite obtained by treatment using 0.8 mol/L NaOH solution were revealed by SEM (Figure 8j). The PtSn/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by wetness impregnation utilizing Bu3SnH and Pt(COD)Me2 as precursors with the subsequent direct reduction process. The prepared PtSn/ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst showed high catalytic performance (an initial propane conversion of 46% and a 98% selectivity to propylene) with excellent single-pass stability (deactivation rate  0.017 s1) and cycling stability. In another work, hierarchical titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1)-nanosheet-supported Pt catalysts were prepared for nonoxidative alkane dehydrogenation. (174) These 2D M-TS-1 zeolites were synthesized utilizing a diquaternary ammonium surfactant template (C2266Br2) that was prepared following the reported procedure, (94) while other zeolites (2D M-ZSM-5, 2D M-Silicalite-1, 3D C-ZSM-5, and 3D C-TS-1) were also synthesized for contrast (C stands for conventional while M stands for multilamellar). The SEM images revealed the different morphologies of the prepared zeolites (Figure 8k), while the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms along with the corresponding pore size distributions extracted from the adsorption branch revealed the textural properties (Figure 8l,m). All of the 2D zeolites possessed microporous and mesoporous structures, while 3D zeolites only had microporous structures. Besides, the 2D zeolites exhibited relatively high external surface areas and volumes compared with their 3D analogues. The 2D Pt-TS-1 catalyst exhibited the highest alkene selectivity and long-term stability, with no significant catalytic deactivation in long-term stability tests, due to fast mass transport among zeolite-supported catalysts.
In summary, traditional microporous zeolites with high thermal stability, chemical stability, and large internal surface area are outstanding supports for the PDH reaction. However, in the PDH process, the diffusion limitation becomes obvious due to their small pores. To lower the diffusion limitation, mesoporous and hierarchical zeolites are utilized as promising substitutions for traditional microporous zeolites. Mesoporous zeolites with amorphous structure can contribute to low hydrothermal stability in the PDH process. Besides, the interaction between the active sites and mesoporous zeolite is usually weak, leading to sintering of the active compounds. The complicated synthesis process along with the costly mesoporogens will restrain the industrial application of hierarchical zeolites. Thus, it is still urgent to exploit new synthetic routes and cheap templates.
4. Conclusion and Outlook
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts. Currently, exploring catalysts with high stability and propylene selectivity is still urgent to meet further demand for industrial production.
Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts. In this review, we have briefly introduced reasons for sintering and coke formation and how they impact catalytic stability. Small-sized particles with high surface energy tend to agglomerate into large particles during the PDH process, causing rapid deactivation, while coke generated from side reactions under high temperatures can deposit on the active sites, inhibiting the contact of reactants. Currently, there still exist intricate debates over the behavior of sintering and coke formation, which is complicated and needs further research.
Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability. Though great progress has been made, there are still challenges remaining to be solved, including the following:
(1) Adding promoters is one of the most efficient strategies in active site regulation to inhibit sintering and coke deposition. Excessive amounts of metal promoters are needed in metal-based catalysts to construct and sustain stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, making these catalysts uneconomical. Meantime, for metal oxide-based catalytic systems, the introduction of inappropriate oxides may suppress the intrinsic activity of active compounds. Thus, deeply figuring out the specific effect along with the functional mechanism of the promoters and exploring cheap promoters are still urgent.
(2) The hydroxyl anchoring method could be an effective approach to anchor active sites. At the present stage, the controllable introduction of heteroatoms can be achieved through SOMC. However, the complicated processes for the fabrication of supports with uniform organic groups and expensive TMPs make it difficult to apply in practical production. The hydroxyl groups on zeolites also can be used to anchor active sites into the zeolite framework, whereas post-treatment of current zeolites for fabricating hydroxyl nests could reduce the crystallinity of supports, causing low hydrothermal stability and a high surface barrier, severely limiting intracrystal diffusion. Thus, an alternative strategy needs to be developed imminently.
(3) Encapsulation is one of the hottest topics in the construction of stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, sites adjustment, and spatial segmentation. At the present stage, controllably encapsulating metal or metal oxide clusters into a zeolite matrix can be achieved through the ligand-protected direct synthesis route, making full use of the cooperation effect among organic groups. However, excess ligands are usually required to form coordinative metal compounds, and the difficulty comes with the selection of proper ligands that are based on different supports and metals, making this technique uneconomical and complex. The ALD technique provides an advanced method to add a protective layer for encapsulating active compounds. At the present stage, the complicated production processes and the expensive raw materials are still big problems that limit the further application in industrial production. Therefore, it is urgent to develop an economical and universal strategy to realize controllable encapsulation.
(4) For the traditional microporous zeolites and metal oxide supports, utilizing different morphologies of supports with large outer surfaces can efficiently decrease the diffusion restriction in heterogeneous catalytic systems. Preparing this type of supports usually needs rare templates, which hinders the application in industrial production. Mesoporous zeolites can serve as potential supports for PDH reaction due to their lower diffusion limitation compared to microporous zeolites. The amorphous structure of mesoporous zeolites induces low hydrothermal stability and weak interactions for the fixation of active components. Constructing hierarchical zeolites as PDH supports provides an effective solution to alleviate the diffusion limitation due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional microporous zeolites and mesoporous zeolites. Currently, the methods of synthesizing hierarchical zeolites can be classified into two sorts: top-down and bottom-up methods. The former, which are post-treatment processes, including dealumnization, desiliconization, and recrystallization, can induce low hydrothermal stability and poor repeatability, while the latter, which utilize porogens in the synthesis process, need expensive templates and complicated synthesis routes that are uneconomical. Therefore, there is still a long way to explore facile templates and simplify the synthesis process.
In conclusion, we have summarized the mechanism of catalytic deactivation and the advanced strategies in catalytic design for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. We hope that this review will provide different insights on catalyst design and promote the development of propane dehydrogenation.
