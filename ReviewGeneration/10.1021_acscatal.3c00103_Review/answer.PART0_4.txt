[1] Propylene, underpinning many highly valued products (polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and acetone), has a big industrial demand for the foreseeable future.

[2] The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.  

[3] CrOx-based catalysts, the catalytic activity of which originates from the Lewis acid sites, are usually preferable because of the low production cost. However, the intrinsic toxicity of CrOx species along with the severe side reactions greatly impedes the application in industrial production.

[4] With regard to Pt-based catalysts, although metallic Pt is broadly identified as a promising PDH catalyst due to its environmental amiability and excellent affinity to CH bonds on alkanes, the rapid deactivation of catalytic activity induced by sintering and coke and the high production cost are still big challenges.

[5] Thermal-induced deactivation of PDH catalysts is a significant problem that can arise from several processes, including (I) coke formation, (II) sintering, and (iii) loss of active compounds.

[6] Coke deposition can occur on both the active compounds and the support surface, ultimately leading to catalytic deactivation by impeding mass transfer and poisoning the active sites.

<English version answer>
1. The article states that propylene is used to produce valued products like polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and acetone, and has big industrial demand. Propane dehydrogenation is seen as a promising alternative route to produce propylene due to the price difference between propane and propylene.

2. The article does not explain how catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation barriers. No specific mechanisms are described.

3. The article introduces CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts. It also briefly mentions catalysts based on metals like Fe, Co, ZnOx, VOx, GaOx, and ZrOx.

4. The article discusses that high temperature (823-973 K) and moderately low pressure (1 bar) are needed to achieve favorable thermodynamics for propane dehydrogenation. No specific kinetics details are provided.

5. The article does not describe the use of DFT calculations to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways. 

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics. No rate equations, parameters, or models are discussed.

7. The article does not describe computational or experimental work identifying catalyst descriptors that correlate to performance. No quantitative structure-activity relationships are revealed.
