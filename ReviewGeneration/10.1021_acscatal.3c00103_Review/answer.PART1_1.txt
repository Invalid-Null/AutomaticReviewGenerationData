<quotes>

[1] "Pt is broadly identified as a promising PDH catalyst due to its environmental amiability and excellent affinity to CH bonds on alkanes."
[2] "Pt particles with the exposed (211) surface have higher CH activation ability, while Pt particles with the exposed (111) surface exhibit higher selectivity resulting from the low binding energy to propylene."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

5. The article briefly evaluates supported Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It notes that Pt is identified as promising due to its affinity for alkane CH bonds and environmental friendliness. It also provides data showing Pt particles with (211) surfaces have higher CH activation while (111) surfaces provide higher selectivity, due to differences in propylene binding energy. However, no other detailed data or characterizations are provided.

[1] "Small-sized and highly dispersed Pt particles are usually preferable for the PDH reaction due to their considerable catalytic activity and high selectivity toward propylene." 
[2] "The addition of Sn could help to achieve higher catalytic selectivity by increasing the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation while lowering the barrier for propylene desorption."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

6. The article investigates how properties like particle size and promoters affect supported Pt catalyst performance. It states small, highly dispersed Pt particles provide higher activity and selectivity. It also shows adding Sn helps improve selectivity by altering energy barriers for propylene dehydrogenation and desorption. However, no other specific structure-function relationships are revealed.
