 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative answer files, here is the analysis of consistency ratios for each question:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%",  
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "0%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "50%", 
    "answer4.txt": "0%"
  },
  "3": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "50%",
    "answer4.txt": "50%"
  },
  "4": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "75%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "50%" 
  },
  "5": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "6": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "7": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  }
}
```

I analyzed each answer file's response for each question and compared it to the provided correct answer to estimate a consistency percentage. 100% indicates complete consistency, while 0% means completely inconsistent.
