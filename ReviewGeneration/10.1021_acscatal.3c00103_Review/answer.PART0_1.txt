[1] Propylene, underpinning many highly valued products (polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and acetone), has a big industrial demand for the foreseeable future. 

[2] Thereinto, polypropene with high chemical durability and elasticity can be applied in various sectors like construction and packaging. 

[3] The explosive growth of propylene consumption, coupled with the soaring oil price, makes it difficult for traditional techniques (fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil and steam cracking of naphtha) to satisfy the demand.

[4] The propane dehydrogenation technique has been considered a novel and promising route to produce propylene in the context of the appearance of abundant propane resources from the exploitation of shale gas.

1. The article provides background that propylene is important in the chemical industry and has applications in polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acetone, construction, and packaging. It states that the demand for propylene is increasing rapidly but traditional production methods like catalytic cracking and steam cracking are having difficulty meeting demand. Propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a promising new route for propylene production due to abundant propane resources from shale gas.

[1] CrOx-based catalysts, the catalytic activity of which originates from the Lewis acid sites, are usually preferable because of the low production cost.

[2] With regard to Pt-based catalysts, although metallic Pt is broadly identified as a promising PDH catalyst due to its environmental amiability and excellent affinity to CH bonds on alkanes, the rapid deactivation of catalytic activity induced by sintering and coke and the high production cost are still big challenges.  

[3] With the further development of the PDH technique, an array of alternative catalysts, including Fe, Co, ZnOx, VOx, GaOx, and ZrOx, have also been explored as economical, environmentally friendly, and efficient alternatives, which can be roughly classified into two sorts: metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts.

3. The article introduces major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation including CrOx-based, Pt-based, Fe-based, Co-based, ZnOx-based, VOx-based, GaOx-based, and ZrOx-based catalysts. It notes CrOx catalysts are low cost but Pt-based catalysts have excellent alkane CH bond affinity. Alternative metal and metal oxide catalysts have been explored as more economical and environmentally friendly options.

[1] To have a comprehensive understanding of the whole process, the main endothermic side reactions that may happen are also listed as follows: 

C3H8 → CH4 + C2H4 (ΔH298 = 98.9 kJ/mol) 

C3H8 → 3C + 4H2 (ΔH298 = 119.5 kJ/mol)

It can be observed that the primary reaction (reaction 1) is a thermodynamically limited endothermic process with an increase in the number of gas molecules, indicating that a high temperature (823–973 K) coupled with moderately low partial pressure (1 bar) is necessary to achieve desirable thermodynamic equilibrium.

4. The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction that requires high temperatures of 823-973 K and low pressures around 1 bar to reach desirable thermodynamics equilibrium. It notes two main side reactions are methane and ethylene formation and carbon formation, which are also endothermic.
