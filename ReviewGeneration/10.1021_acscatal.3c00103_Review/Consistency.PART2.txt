 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative files, I have compiled the following JSON structure with the consistency ratios for each question and answer file:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%", 
    "answer1.txt": "0%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%", 
    "answer3.txt": "100%",
    "answer4.txt": "0%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "3": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%" 
  },
  "4": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "5": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "6": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "7": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%", 
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  }
}
```

I compared each answer file's response for a given question to the provided correct answer, estimated the degree of consistency, and expressed it as a percentage. Please let me know if you would like me to explain or elaborate on any part of the analysis.
