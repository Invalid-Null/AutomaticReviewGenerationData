I carefully analyzed the quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers in each file, and compared them to the correct answers provided. I calculated the consistency ratio by determining if the key points in the correct answer were also present in the file's answer. A 100% consistency means the file's answer contained all the key ideas, while 0% means none of the key points were present.
