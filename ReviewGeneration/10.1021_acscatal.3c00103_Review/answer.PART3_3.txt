1. "The dealuminated Beta zeolite, named SiBeta, was identified as an excellent support on account of the existence of the vacant Al sites and the generated SiOH nests."

2. "PtGa alloys supported on mesoporous silica SBA-15 were designed as an active and stable catalyst for PDH." 

3. "After the impregnation process and the subsequent calcination process under an air atmosphere, Co compounds were successfully confined into the hydroxyl nests of the SiBeta support, as confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure 6i)."

1. Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It discusses dealumination of Beta zeolite to generate vacant Al sites and SiOH nests that can anchor and isolate active metal sites. An example is incorporating Ga3+ species into the SiBeta framework to achieve single Ga3+ sites stabilized by the zeolite.

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides the example of encapsulating PtZn nanoclusters in the 10R sinusoidal channels of S-1 zeolite using a one-pot direct synthesis method. This exhibited high stability with only slight conversion deactivation after 70 hours.

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like surface organometallic chemistry to graft isolated metal sites onto supports, as well as metal encapsulation in zeolites. An example is confining Co species into the hydroxyl nests of dealuminated SiBeta zeolite.

1. 是的,该文描述了在分子筛支持体中合成隔离的单一位点的技术。它讨论了β沸石的脱铝以生成能够锚定和隔离活性金属位点的空铝位点和SiOH巢。一个例子是将Ga3+物种掺入SiBeta框架中以实现单一的Ga3+位点,这些位点由分子筛稳定。

2. 是的,该文评估了金属封装在分子筛支持体中的方法,以提高丙烷脱氢催化剂的稳定性。它提供了一个例子,即利用一钵合成法在S-1沸石的10R正弦曲线通道内封装PtZn纳米簇,这表现出了高稳定性,在70小时后仅有轻微的转化活性减弱。

3. 是的,该文研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它讨论了如表面有机金属化学等技术,以接枝隔离的金属位点到支持体上,以及金属在分子筛中的封装。一个例子是将Co种类限制在脱铝SiBeta分子筛的羟基巢内。
