[1] A catalyst consisting of nanometric bimetallic PtSn clusters encapsulated in K-MFI zeolite was synthesized via a one-pot direct synthesis using H2[PtCl6] and SnCl4·5H2O as precursors. 
[2] These PtSn nanoclusters were encapsulated in the 10R sinusoidal channels of S-1 zeolite, as determined by a combination of high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-HAADF-STEM) and iDPC imaging. 
[3] This catalyst exhibited high stability and only slight propane conversion deactivation from 20% to 17% after 70 h.

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides examples of encapsulating PtSn nanoclusters in K-MFI and S-1 zeolites using direct hydrothermal synthesis methods. Data shows only slight deactivation over 70 hours for the PtSn nanoclusters encapsulated in S-1. The zeolite encapsulation helps stabilize the active metal clusters.

[1] PtREE catalysts were successfully incorporated into a siliceous MFI zeolite with surface skeleton defects (silanol nests) via a coimpregnation process followed by calcination under an O2 flow and subsequent H2 treatment.
[2] Isolated Ga3+ sites with outstanding antireduction ability that were derived from the establishment of GaO bonds were obtained by grafting Ga(CH2CH(CH3)2) on fully dehydrated and partially dehydrated γ-Al2O3 and SiO2. 
[3] The synthesized Ga/Al2O3 with mononuclear [(AlO)Ga(CH2CH(CH3)2)2O] sites exhibited promising catalytic performance compared to the Ga/SiO2 catalyst with dinuclear [(SiO)2Ga2(i-Bu)3] sites.

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like co-impregnation of Pt and rare earth elements (REE) into siliceous MFI zeolite with surface defects to incorporate isolated PtREE sites. It also describes grafting gallium complexes onto dehydrated Al2O3 and SiO2 supports to obtain isolated mononuclear Ga sites. Data shows the mononuclear Ga sites on Al2O3 exhibited better catalytic performance than the dinuclear sites on SiO2.
