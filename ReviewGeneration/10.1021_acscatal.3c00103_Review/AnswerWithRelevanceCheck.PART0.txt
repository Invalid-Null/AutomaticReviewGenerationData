         [1] Propylene, underpinning many highly valued products (polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and acetone), has a big industrial demand for the foreseeable future. (14)

         [2] Thereinto, polypropene with high chemical durability and elasticity can be applied in various sectors like construction and packaging.

         [3] The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.

         The article provides background that propylene is important in the chemical industry and has applications in polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acetone, construction, and packaging. It states that the demand for propylene is increasing rapidly but traditional production methods like catalytic cracking and steam cracking are having difficulty meeting demand. Propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a promising new route for propylene production due to abundant propane resources from shale gas.

         [1] The reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism proposed in 1934 is a widely acknowledged mechanism to describe the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process, dividing the whole process into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a CC double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2.

      <English>
         The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing active sites that can adsorb propane and activate C-H bonds through mechanisms like the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism. This mechanism has three key steps: dissociative adsorption of propane with elimination of H, extraction of a β-H to form a C=C double bond, and desorption of propylene.

         [1] CrOx-based catalysts, the catalytic activity of which originates from the Lewis acid sites, are usually preferable because of the low production cost.

         [2] With regard to Pt-based catalysts, although metallic Pt is broadly identified as a promising PDH catalyst due to its environmental amiability and excellent affinity to CH bonds on alkanes, the rapid deactivation of catalytic activity induced by sintering and coke and the high production cost are still big challenges. 

         [3] With the further development of the PDH technique, an array of alternative catalysts, including Fe, Co, ZnOx, VOx, GaOx, and ZrOx, have also been explored as economical, environmentally friendly, and efficient alternatives, which can be roughly classified into two sorts: metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts.

         The article introduces major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation including CrOx-based, Pt-based, Fe-based, Co-based, ZnOx-based, VOx-based, GaOx-based, and ZrOx-based catalysts. It notes CrOx catalysts are low cost but Pt-based catalysts have excellent alkane CH bond affinity. Alternative metal and metal oxide catalysts have been explored as more economical and environmentally friendly options.

         [1] To have a comprehensive understanding of the whole process, the main endothermic side reactions that may happen are also listed as follows:  

         C3H8 → CH4 + C2H4 (ΔH298 = 98.9 kJ/mol)  

         C3H8 → 3C + 4H2 (ΔH298 = 119.5 kJ/mol)

         [2] It can be observed that the primary reaction (reaction 1) is a thermodynamically limited endothermic process with an increase in the number of gas molecules, indicating that a high temperature (823–973 K) coupled with moderately low partial pressure (1 bar) is necessary to achieve desirable thermodynamic equilibrium.

         The article discusses thermodynamic constraints, explaining that propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction that requires high temperatures of 823-973 K and moderately low pressures around 1 bar to achieve equilibrium conversion. It also notes that side reactions like cracking are endothermic, and provides the reaction enthalpies of the main reaction and side reactions.
