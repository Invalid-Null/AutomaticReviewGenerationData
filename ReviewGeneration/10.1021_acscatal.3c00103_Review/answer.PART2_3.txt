[1] Sn is a widely utilized promoter for Pt catalysts. Alloying Pt with Sn can significantly alter the electronic and geometric structure of Pt sites. 

[2] The PtGa catalyst system has also been implemented in production plants (FCDh technique). Recently, Payard et al. investigated the structure-activity relationship over silica-supported PtGa nanoparticles at a molecular level.  

[3] In has also been developed as a promising promoter of Pt-based catalysts. Zha et al. reported that the bimetallic alloy (Pt3In) exhibited a high activity comparable to those of pure Pt and PtSn alloys and a considerable improvement in the propylene selectivity and stability compared to pure Pt.

[4] Zn is another analogous but economical promoter for Pt-based catalysts. Cybulskis et al. investigated the explicit influence of introducing Zn to the Pt species. The Zn selectively tuned the valence orbitals and the surface electronic structure of Pt, resulting in increased product selectivity and stable catalytic performance.

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn, Pt-Ga, and Pt-Zn for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing how these promoters can modulate the electronic structure, geometric structure, and ensemble effects of Pt to improve catalytic performance and stability. Specific examples include Pt-Sn helping inhibit coke formation, Pt-Ga improving dispersion and stability, and Pt-Zn tuning the valence orbitals of Pt to increase selectivity.
