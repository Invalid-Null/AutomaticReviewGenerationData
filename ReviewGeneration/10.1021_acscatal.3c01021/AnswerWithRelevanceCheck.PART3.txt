The answer results do not contain information directly relevant to answering the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Key topics brought up in the questions such as catalyst synthesis methods, encapsulation, dispersion, in-situ characterization, microscopy, and reactor types are not addressed. 

While the answers discuss using X-ray absorption spectroscopy to probe gallium oxidation states in some catalysts, this technique is only relevant to one of the questions asked. The answers do not aggregate insights or compile comprehensive responses across the range of questions posed.

Therefore, I have determined the answers are not adequately relevant to constitute a full review of the questions asked. Per the initial instructions, I am providing this single sentence indicating the irrelevance of answers instead of any further compiled response.
