 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative answer files, I have analyzed the consistency of each file's answers and structured the results in the requested JSON format:

```json

    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",

    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "0%"
  }
}
```

I carefully compared each answer file's responses for the 8 questions to the provided correct answers, and calculated the consistency percentage based on whether the meanings matched or not. Most answers show 100% consistency, except for question 6 where answer.PART3_2.txt has 0% consistency since it incorrectly states the article does not use X-ray techniques. And for question 8, answer.PART3_4.txt has 0% consistency since it talks about reaction conditions instead of reactor types. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the analysis.
