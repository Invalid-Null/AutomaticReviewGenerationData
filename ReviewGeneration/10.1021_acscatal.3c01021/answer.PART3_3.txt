[1] "Identification of [Ga]+ sites in heterogeneous catalysts under reaction conditions relies primarily on X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)."

[2] "The shift in the Ga K-edge that occurs in flowing H2 at ca. 500 C results in an edge energy approaching that of metallic Ga (10,367.0 eV), suggesting the presence of Ga in a low oxidation state."

[3] "The ability of supported Ga oxides to catalyze the selective dehydrogenation of propane has inspired much interest in the catalysis research community, as the need for on-demand propylene has increased driven by the use of alternative feedstocks (e.g., shale gas)." 

[4] "The Ga K-edge XANES was recorded for two Ga(I)-containing solids: Ga+[GaCl4] and Ga+-β-Al2O3, and two well-defined molecular Ga(I)-containing compounds: [Ga(Ph3CH)2][B(C6F5)4] and [Ga(C6H5F)2.5][Al(OC(CF3)3)4]."

[5] "To identify XANES features diagnostic of Ga(I), the Ga K-edge XANES was recorded for two Ga(I)-containing solids: Ga+[GaCl4] and Ga+-β-Al2O3, and two well-defined molecular Ga(I)-containing compounds: [Ga(Ph3CH)2][B(C6F5)4] and [Ga(C6H5F)2.5][Al(OC(CF3)3)4]."

[6] "The Ga K-edge XANES of Ga/γ-Al2O3 and Ga/HZSM-5 were recorded in situ in transmission mode at beamlines 2-2 and 9-3, using a custom-made reactor."

[7] "XAS spectra of Ga/γ-Al2O3 and Ga/HZSM-5 were recorded in situ in transmission mode at beamlines 2-2 and 9-3, using a custom-made reactor."

6. Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques like XANES and EXAFS to probe oxidation state changes of gallium during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It records the Ga K-edge XANES of Ga(I)-containing model compounds and catalyst samples under reducing conditions to identify signatures characteristic of Ga(I), such as a low-energy white line peak around 10,373 eV. In situ XANES of Ga/HZSM-5 and Ga/γ-Al2O3 are obtained in a custom reactor to monitor changes after high temperature H2 reduction.

6. 是的,文章使用基于X射线的技术,如XANES和EXAFS来探测在丙烷脱氢催化过程中的镓的氧化态变化。它记录了Ga(I)模型化合物和催化剂样品在还原条件下的Ga K边XANES,以识别Ga(I)的特征签名,如在10373 eV附近的低能白线峰。使用定制反应器原位获得Ga/HZSM-5和Ga/γ-Al2O3的XANES,以监测高温H2还原后的变化。
