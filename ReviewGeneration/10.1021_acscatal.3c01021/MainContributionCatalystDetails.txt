The document focuses on the Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Key details:
- The catalyst is composed of gallium metal supported on HZSM-5 zeolite.
- It is identified as having a high fraction (~70%) of Ga(I) sites after treatment in H2 at 550Â°C, likely responsible for its propane dehydrogenation activity.
- No other catalyst details like conversion rate, selectivity, etc. are provided.
