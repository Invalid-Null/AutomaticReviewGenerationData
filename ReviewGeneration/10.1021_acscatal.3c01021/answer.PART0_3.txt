1. The article does not provide specific details about the value and applications of propylene. It only briefly mentions the increasing demand for on-demand propylene production.

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing alternative reaction pathways with lower activation barriers, but it does not go into details about specific mechanisms.

3. The article introduces supported gallium oxides, Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, and zeolites as catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide many specific examples. 

4. The article does not discuss thermodynamic or kinetic factors quantitatively. It only briefly mentions that propane dehydrogenation is endothermic and activation barriers need to be lowered.

5. The article does not describe any computational studies or DFT calculations related to propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics. 

7. The article does not describe any computational or experimental work to correlate catalyst properties with propane dehydrogenation performance. No quantitative structure-activity relationships are revealed.

1. 这篇文章没有提供丙烯的价值和应用的具体细节。它只是简单地提到了对按需丙烯生产的增加需求。

2. 文章解释说催化剂通过提供具有更低活化栏iers的替代反应途径来促进丙烷脱氢,但没有详细说明特定机制。

3. 文章介绍了受支持的氧化镓、铂和铬基催化剂以及分子筛作为丙烷脱氢探索的催化剂类,但没有提供太多具体示例。

4. 文章没有定量地讨论热力学或动力学因素。它只是简单地提到丙烷脱氢是吸热的,并且需要降低活化栏iers。

5. 文章没有描述与丙烷脱氢机制和途径相关的任何计算研究或密度泛函理论计算。

6. 文章没有呈现任何关于丙烷脱氢动力学的微观动力学建模。

7. 文章没有描述任何关联催化剂性质与丙烷脱氢性能的计算或实验工作。没有揭示定量的结构-活性关系。
