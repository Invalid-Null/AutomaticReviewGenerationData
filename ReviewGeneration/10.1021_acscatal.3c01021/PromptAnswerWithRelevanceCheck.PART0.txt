[1] "Identification of the major Ga oxidation state does not require that it be the active site, nor is the failure to detect a site spectroscopically a valid reason to exclude its participation in a catalytic cycle, since the abundance of any intermediate depends on the kinetic parameters."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

7. The article states that identifying the major gallium oxidation state is not necessary to identify the active catalytic site. Additionally, the inability to spectroscopically detect a site does not exclude it from participating in a catalytic cycle, since intermediate abundance depends on kinetic parameters.

</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>

7. 文章指出,确定主要的镓氧化态不是必要的来识别活性催化位点。 此外,由于中间体的丰度取决于动力学参数,所以无法以光谱方法检测一个位点并不排除它参与催化循环的可能性。

 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the literature that directly answer the questions you posed. However, I can provide the following summaries and interpretations:

<quotes>
No relevant quotes
</quotes>

<English version answer>

1. The article does not provide specific details about the value and applications of propylene. It only briefly mentions the increasing demand for on-demand propylene production.

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing alternative reaction pathways with lower activation barriers, but it does not go into details about specific mechanisms.

3. The article introduces supported gallium oxides, Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, and zeolites as catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide many specific examples. 

4. The article does not discuss thermodynamic or kinetic factors quantitatively. It only briefly mentions that propane dehydrogenation is endothermic and activation barriers need to be lowered.

5. The article does not describe any computational studies or DFT calculations related to propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics. 

7. The article does not describe any computational or experimental work to correlate catalyst properties with propane dehydrogenation performance. No quantitative structure-activity relationships are revealed.

1. 这篇文章没有提供丙烯的价值和应用的具体细节。它只是简单地提到了对按需丙烯生产的增加需求。

2. 文章解释说催化剂通过提供具有更低活化栏iers的替代反应途径来促进丙烷脱氢,但没有详细说明特定机制。

3. 文章介绍了受支持的氧化镓、铂和铬基催化剂以及分子筛作为丙烷脱氢探索的催化剂类,但没有提供太多具体示例。

4. 文章没有定量地讨论热力学或动力学因素。它只是简单地提到丙烷脱氢是吸热的,并且需要降低活化栏iers。

5. 文章没有描述与丙烷脱氢机制和途径相关的任何计算研究或密度泛函理论计算。

6. 文章没有呈现任何关于丙烷脱氢动力学的微观动力学建模。

7. 文章没有描述任何关联催化剂性质与丙烷脱氢性能的计算或实验工作。没有揭示定量的结构-活性关系。

 Unfortunately the literature provided does not contain information to answer the specific questions asked. The article focuses on analyzing Ga K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data to characterize the oxidation state and coordination environment of Ga species in catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It does not provide details on the industrial importance of propylene, reaction mechanisms, thermodynamics/kinetics, computational modeling, microkinetic modeling, or structure-activity relationships for propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
