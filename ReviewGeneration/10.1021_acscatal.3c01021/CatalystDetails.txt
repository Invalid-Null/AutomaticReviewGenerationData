The document is relevant to propane dehydrogenation as it discusses Ga/HZSM-5 and Ga/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for this reaction. The two catalysts mentioned are Ga/HZSM-5 and Ga/γ-Al2O3. 

Ga/HZSM-5 appears to be the main contribution as the document focuses on analyzing the oxidation state of Ga in this catalyst under reaction conditions and proposes it contains mainly Ga(I) which may be the active site. No other catalytic performance details are provided.
