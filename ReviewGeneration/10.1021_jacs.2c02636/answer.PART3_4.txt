[1] "Recently, cobalt (Co)-containing catalysts have been reported to be active for alkane dehydrogenation."

[2] "The ligand-protected hydrothermal synthesis approach can construct the isolated active center of {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2} with tetrahedrally coordinated Co species in Co-MFI, which presents high efficiency and selectivity in the PDH reaction."

[3] "In this work, we construct Co-MFI zeolites and present direct evidence for single Co atoms embedding into the purely siliceous MFI zeolite framework."  

[4] "The location, uniformity, and exact structure of Co-MFI are fully identified by iDPC-STEM, XAS, pyridine/CD3CN FT-IR, and UVvis spectroscopy, revealing that the isolated Co-motifs with the distorted tetrahedral structure of {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2} are homogeneously embedded into the T1(7) and T3(9) sites of MFI zeolites."

[5] "To understand the reaction mechanism, DFT calculations of C3H8 activation were performed over Co-MFI with framework Si atoms replaced by Co atoms at the observed sites (T1, T3, T7, and T9, Figure 1) and a referenced site (T10) according to the MFI topology."

[6] "Bader charge analysis reveals that the Co reaction center is unique and acts as an electron reservoir, where the charge of the Co atom is dynamically evolved in the whole catalytic process (Figure 4a)."

[7] "The online mass spectrometry (MS) results demonstrate the formation of HD molecules at the initial stage of the PDH reaction (Figure 4f)."

[8] "In situ FTIR measurement detects that the OD absorbance band at 2500–2800 cm−1 progressively declines and finally disappears with continuous C3H8 feeding (Figure 4g), and at the same time, the OH bonds (3400–3700 cm−1) on the surface are restored."

1. Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single Co sites in zeolitic MFI supports. It uses a ligand-protected hydrothermal synthesis approach to construct isolated Co-motifs with a distorted tetrahedral structure of {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2} that are homogeneously embedded into the T1(7) and T3(9) sites of the MFI framework. This is evidenced by advanced characterization techniques like iDPC-STEM, XAS, and FTIR.

2. Yes, the article evaluates Co encapsulation in the MFI zeolite framework for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It shows the Co-MFI catalyst maintains high activity and selectivity after 6 reaction-regeneration cycles. TEM shows the Co-MFI structure is unchanged after cycling. 

3. Yes, the article investigates ligand-protected hydrothermal synthesis aimed at optimizing Co dispersion. This method constructs isolated Co-motifs in the MFI framework and avoids the formation of CoOx clusters or nanoparticles. The isolated Co-motifs show much higher PDH activity than CoOx clusters/nanoparticles.

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ FTIR and online MS during PDH catalysis over Co-MFI. FTIR tracks evolution of OH groups during reaction, showing they participate in dehydrogenation. MS detects HD and H2 formation, confirming the proposed PDH mechanism.

5. Yes, the article employs iDPC-STEM microscopy to characterize the Co-support interface. It directly images individual Co atoms embedded in the MFI framework at T1 and T3 sites. This reveals the isolated nature of the Co active sites.

6. No, the article does not use X-ray techniques to probe oxidation state changes during PDH catalysis. 

7. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on catalyst synthesis and characterization.

1. 是的,该文描述了在硅酸盐MFI支撑体中合成隔离的单一Co位点的技术。它使用配体保护的水热合成方法构建了扭曲的四面体结构{(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2}的隔离Co基团,均匀嵌入MFI框架的T1(7)和T3(9)位点。这通过先进的表征技术如iDPC-STEM、XAS和FTIR证实。

2. 是的,该文评价了Co封装在MFI沸石框架中,以增强丙烷脱氢催化剂稳定性。它显示Co-MFI催化剂在6个反应-再生循环后保持高活性和选择性。TEM显示Co-MFI结构在循环后保持不变。

3. 是的,该文研究了配体保护的水热合成方法,旨在优化Co分散度。该方法在MFI框架中构建了隔离的Co基团,避免了CoOx簇或纳米粒子的形成。 隔离的Co基团显示比CoOx簇/纳米粒子具有更高的PDH活性。
