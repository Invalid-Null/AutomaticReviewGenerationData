 is the JSON formatted comparison of the answer files to the correct answers:

```json

  }
}
```

I carefully compared the quotes and answers provided in each file to the correct answers. I calculated the consistency ratio for each question by determining if the provided answer contained the same key points as the correct answer. For completely consistent answers I assigned 100%, for completely inconsistent 0%, and for partially consistent answers an intermediate percentage. The JSON output summarizes the consistency percentages for each file and question.
