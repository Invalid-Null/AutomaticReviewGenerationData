         [1] "Co-MFI zeolites were prepared by the ligand-protected hydrothermal synthesis method starting from the gel of 1SiO2:nCoO:2nETD (ethanediamine):0.3TPAOH (tetrapropylamium hydroxide):4IPA (isopropanol):35H2O (n = 0.03, 0.05, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0)."
         [2] "Combining Cs-corrected HAADF-STEM, iDPC-STEM, XAS, pyridine/CD3CN FT-IR, and UV–vis spectroscopy, the location, uniformity, and exact structure of Co-MFI are fully identified, revealing that the isolated Co-motifs with the distorted tetrahedral structure of {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2} are homogeneously embedded into the T1(7) and T3(9) sites of MFI zeolites."
         [3] "The ligand-protected hydrothermal synthesis approach can construct the isolated active center of {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2} with tetrahedrally coordinated Co species in Co-MFI, which presents high efficiency and selectivity in the PDH reaction."
         [4] "In this work, we construct Co-MFI zeolites and present direct evidence for single Co atoms embedding into the purely siliceous MFI zeolite framework."

         Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single Co sites in zeolitic MFI supports. It uses a ligand-protected hydrothermal synthesis approach to construct isolated Co-motifs with a distorted tetrahedral structure of {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2} that are homogeneously embedded into the T1(7) and T3(9) sites of the MFI framework. This is evidenced by advanced characterization techniques like iDPC-STEM, XAS, and FTIR.

         [1] "Co-MFI exhibits a high TOF of 124.3 h−1, which is comparable to that of some Pt-based catalysts and much higher than that of previously reported Co- and Cr-based catalysts, illustrating the excellent PDH performance of Co-MFI."
         [2] "The Cs-corrected TEM characterization of the spent Co-MFI zeolite (Figure 3f–h) after the sixth reaction-regeneration cycle shows the same micromorphology as that of the fresh Co-MFI zeolite (Figure 1). The STEM-EDS mapping images also reveal the homogeneous distribution of Co species in the spent Co-MFI (Figure 3h)."
         [3] "The cycle stability test demonstrates the high cycle stability of the Co-MFI catalyst."

         Yes, the article evaluates Co encapsulation in the MFI zeolite framework for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It shows the Co-MFI catalyst maintains high activity and selectivity after 6 reaction-regeneration cycles. TEM shows the Co-MFI structure is unchanged after cycling.

         [2] "In situ FTIR measurement detects that the OD absorbance band at 2500–2800 cm−1 progressively declines and finally disappears with continuous C3H8 feeding (Figure 4g), and at the same time, the OH bonds (3400–3700 cm−1) on the surface are restored."

         Yes, the article investigates ligand-protected hydrothermal synthesis aimed at optimizing Co dispersion. This method constructs isolated Co-motifs in the MFI framework and avoids the formation of CoOx clusters or nanoparticles. The isolated Co-motifs show much higher PDH activity than CoOx clusters/nanoparticles.
