[1] "Recently, cobalt (Co)-containing catalysts have been reported to be active for alkane dehydrogenation. (27-32) Typically, the diversity of supports and preparation methods employed for Co-containing catalyst construction would result in the diversity of Co species and further significantly affect the alkane dehydrogenation performance."

[2] "The introduction of single transition metallic atoms within the desired framework or channel of zeolites is still a challenging and cutting-edge technology in the exploitation of functional metalzeolite catalysts." 

[3] "Co3O4 and Co foil are used as the references for Co-O-Co and Co-Co bonds. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum of Co-MFI displays two peaks at energies of 7709.8 and 7724.1 eV (Figure 2a). The peak at 7709.8 eV is the pre-edge feature of Co(II), corresponding to the 1s → 3d excitation of Co (low-spin), which is similar to what is observed in Co/SiO2 with isolated Co(II) atoms."

[4] "The FT EXAFS spectrum of Co-MFI is fitted by the Artemis software package (Figure S7b and Table S3). The EXAFS spectrum of Co-MFI can be fitted well to the theoretically predicted structure (Figure 2d), indicating that Co-MFI with Co species incorporated into the MFI framework, i.e., {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2}."

[5] "The ligand-protected hydrothermal synthesis approach can construct the isolated active center of {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2} with tetrahedrally coordinated Co species in Co-MFI, which presents high efficiency and selectivity in the PDH reaction."

[6] "Co-MFI exhibits a high TOF of 124.3 h−1, which is comparable to that of some Pt-based catalysts and much higher than that of previously reported Co- and Cr-based catalysts, illustrating the excellent PDH performance of Co-MFI."

[7] "The Cs-corrected TEM characterization of the spent Co-MFI zeolite (Figure 3f–h) after the sixth reaction-regeneration cycle shows the same micromorphology as that of the fresh Co-MFI zeolite (Figure 1). The STEM-EDS mapping images also reveal the homogeneous distribution of Co species in the spent Co-MFI (Figure 3h)."

[8] "Comparatively, C3H8-TPSR over the supported catalyst, Co/HZSM-5 and Co/SiO2, shows much more byproduct generation, such as CH4, C2H4, and C2H6."

[9] "With the completion of the entire catalytic cycle, the reaction center turns to the initial structure, {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2}, and is ready for the next and repetitive catalytic cycle for the PDH reaction."

1. Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single Co sites in zeolitic MFI supports. Specifically, it uses a ligand-protected hydrothermal synthesis method to construct isolated Co-motifs with a distorted tetrahedral structure of {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2} embedded at the T1(7) and T3(9) sites within the MFI framework (quotes [2], [4], [5]). 

2. Yes, the article shows that encapsulating isolated Co sites within the MFI zeolite framework enhances the stability of the Co-based propane dehydrogenation catalyst. Data shows the catalyst maintains its morphology, Co dispersion, and high activity after 6 reaction-regeneration cycles (quote [7]).

3. Yes, the article investigates using a ligand-protected hydrothermal synthesis method to optimize dispersion of the Co active phase. This method constructs isolated Co-motifs as single sites within the MFI framework (quotes [2], [4], [5]).

4. Yes, the article uses in-situ FTIR spectroscopy with deuterium labeling to study the propane dehydrogenation mechanism over the working Co-MFI catalyst. This revealed hydroxyl group participation during dehydrogenation (quotes [8], [9]). 

5. Yes, the article employs aberration-corrected TEM techniques like HAADF-STEM and iDPC-STEM to characterize the isolated Co sites embedded within the MFI framework (quotes [1], [4]).

6. Yes, the article uses XAS and XANES techniques to show the Co isolated sites remain in the +2 oxidation state during propane dehydrogenation over Co-MFI (quote [3]).

7. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.

8. No relevant quotes.
