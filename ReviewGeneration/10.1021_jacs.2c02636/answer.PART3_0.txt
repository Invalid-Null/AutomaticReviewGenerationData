[1] "The location, uniformity, and exact structure of Co-MFI are fully identified by iDPC-STEM, XAS, pyridine/CD3CN FT-IR, and UVvis spectroscopy, revealing that the isolated Co-motifs with the distorted tetrahedral structure of {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2} are homogeneously embedded into the T1(7) and T3(9) sites of MFI zeolites."

5. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques including iDPC-STEM to characterize the interfaces between cobalt atoms and the MFI zeolite framework. It reveals that isolated cobalt motifs with a distorted tetrahedral structure are embedded at specific T1 and T3 sites within the MFI lattice.

[1] "Furthermore, the structure of Co species in Co-MFI is identified by Co K-edge XAS (Figures 2 and S7). Co3O4 and Co foil are used as the references for CoOCo and CoCo bonds. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum of Co-MFI displays two peaks at energies of 7709.8 and 7724.1 eV (Figure 2a)."

[2] "To confirm the proposed mechanism, deuterium-labeling experiments were performed over Co-MFI before the catalytic test (Figure S39). The H atoms in the Co-motif {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2} of Co-MFI can be exchanged by D atoms to form OD groups in the D2 atmosphere at a temperature of 580 C, evidenced by the in situ FTIR spectroscopy with the emergence of new absorbance bands from OD in the region of 25002800 cm1."

6. Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and deuterium labeling experiments monitored by in situ FTIR to probe oxidation state changes of cobalt during propane dehydrogenation. The XAS data reveals distinct cobalt oxidation states in the catalyst. The deuterium labeling shows that cobalt-associated hydroxyl groups participate in dehydrogenation steps.
