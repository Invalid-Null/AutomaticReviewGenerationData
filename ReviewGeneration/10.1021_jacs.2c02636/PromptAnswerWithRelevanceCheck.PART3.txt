[1] "Recently, cobalt (Co)-containing catalysts have been reported to be active for alkane dehydrogenation. (27-32) Typically, the diversity of supports and preparation methods employed for Co-containing catalyst construction would result in the diversity of Co species and further significantly affect the alkane dehydrogenation performance."

[2] "The introduction of single transition metallic atoms within the desired framework or channel of zeolites is still a challenging and cutting-edge technology in the exploitation of functional metalzeolite catalysts." 

[3] "Co3O4 and Co foil are used as the references for Co-O-Co and Co-Co bonds. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum of Co-MFI displays two peaks at energies of 7709.8 and 7724.1 eV (Figure 2a). The peak at 7709.8 eV is the pre-edge feature of Co(II), corresponding to the 1s → 3d excitation of Co (low-spin), which is similar to what is observed in Co/SiO2 with isolated Co(II) atoms."

[4] "The FT EXAFS spectrum of Co-MFI is fitted by the Artemis software package (Figure S7b and Table S3). The EXAFS spectrum of Co-MFI can be fitted well to the theoretically predicted structure (Figure 2d), indicating that Co-MFI with Co species incorporated into the MFI framework, i.e., {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2}."

[5] "The ligand-protected hydrothermal synthesis approach can construct the isolated active center of {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2} with tetrahedrally coordinated Co species in Co-MFI, which presents high efficiency and selectivity in the PDH reaction."

[6] "Co-MFI exhibits a high TOF of 124.3 h−1, which is comparable to that of some Pt-based catalysts and much higher than that of previously reported Co- and Cr-based catalysts, illustrating the excellent PDH performance of Co-MFI."

[7] "The Cs-corrected TEM characterization of the spent Co-MFI zeolite (Figure 3f–h) after the sixth reaction-regeneration cycle shows the same micromorphology as that of the fresh Co-MFI zeolite (Figure 1). The STEM-EDS mapping images also reveal the homogeneous distribution of Co species in the spent Co-MFI (Figure 3h)."

[8] "Comparatively, C3H8-TPSR over the supported catalyst, Co/HZSM-5 and Co/SiO2, shows much more byproduct generation, such as CH4, C2H4, and C2H6."

[9] "With the completion of the entire catalytic cycle, the reaction center turns to the initial structure, {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2}, and is ready for the next and repetitive catalytic cycle for the PDH reaction."
