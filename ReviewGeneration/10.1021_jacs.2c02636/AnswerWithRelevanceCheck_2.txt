         [1] "Recently, cobalt (Co)-containing catalysts have been reported to be active for alkane dehydrogenation." 

         [2] "Employing zeolites as the environment to accommodate Co sites is a promising approach to achieve a uniform Cozeolite catalytic system for efficient conversion, as well as for the structure definition, acid site identification, and catalysis understanding."

         [3] "The ligand-protected hydrothermal synthesis approach can construct the isolated active center of {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2} with tetrahedrally coordinated Co species in Co-MFI, which presents high efficiency and selectivity in the PDH reaction."

      <English>
         The article discusses techniques for synthesizing isolated cobalt active sites in zeolitic supports, specifically MFI. It utilizes a ligand-protected hydrothermal synthesis approach to construct {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2} motifs with tetrahedral cobalt coordination embedded in the MFI framework. This achieves high efficiency and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation.

         [1] "With zeolites as the support, metal species are encapsulated inside or highly dispersed on the zeolite surface resulting in nano- or subnano-scale metal particles, which are responsible for the high efficiency and long-life reaction performance of alkane dehydrogenation."

         [2] "The cycle stability test demonstrates the high cycle stability of the Co-MFI catalyst." 

         [3] "Co-MFI exhibits a high TOF of 124.3 h−1, which is comparable to that of some Pt-based catalysts and much higher than that of previously reported Co- and Cr-based catalysts, illustrating the excellent PDH performance of Co-MFI."
