[1] "Co-MFI zeolites were prepared by the ligand-protected hydrothermal synthesis method starting from the gel of 1SiO2:nCoO:2nETD (ethanediamine):0.3TPAOH (tetrapropylamium hydroxide):4IPA (isopropanol):35H2O (n = 0.03, 0.05, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0)."

[2] "Combining Cs-corrected HAADF-STEM, iDPC-STEM, XAS, pyridine/CD3CN FT-IR, and UV–vis spectroscopy, the location, uniformity, and exact structure of Co-MFI are fully identified, revealing that the isolated Co-motifs with the distorted tetrahedral structure of {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2} are homogeneously embedded into the T1(7) and T3(9) sites of MFI zeolites."

[3] "The Co-motif active center in Co-MFI goes through the dynamic evolutions and restoration in electronic states and coordination states in a continuous and repetitive way, which meets the requirements from the series of elementary steps in the PDH catalytic cycle and fulfills the successful catalysis like enzyme catalysis."

[4] "To understand the reaction mechanism, DFT calculations of C3H8 activation were performed over Co-MFI with framework Si atoms replaced by Co atoms at the observed sites (T1, T3, T7, and T9, Figure 1) and a referenced site (T10) according to the MFI topology."

[5] "Then, the deuterium-labeled Co-MFI was tested for C3H8 conversion. The online mass spectrometry (MS) results demonstrate the formation of HD molecules at the initial stage of the PDH reaction (Figure 4f)."
