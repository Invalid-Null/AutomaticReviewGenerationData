4. The superior PDH performance of the Co-MFI zeolite, C3H8-TPSR experiments were performed over Co-MFI in a stable C3H8 flow (Figure S28). The H2 and C3H6 signals increase predominantly, while signals from CH4, C2H4, and C2H6 are detected in very low intensity even at 600 °C, indicating the highly reactive and selective PDH reaction over Co-MFI.

1. The article does not discuss process intensification approaches for propane dehydrogenation.

2. The article does not analyze techno-economic factors affecting propane dehydrogenation viability. 

3. The article does not discuss safety issues like flammability and explosion hazards with propane dehydrogenation.

4. To understand the superior PDH performance of Co-MFI, C3H8-TPSR experiments showed much lower byproducts like CH4, C2H4, C2H6 over Co-MFI versus supported catalysts, indicating highly selective PDH catalysis by Co-MFI. This suggests remaining challenges in achieving similarly selective PDH with other catalysts.

5. The article does not propose high-throughput computational catalyst screening and design methods.

6. The article does not highlight needs for improved in-situ characterization tools for understanding PDH catalysts. 

7. The article does not envision transformational PDH catalyst architectures for breakthrough performance.

1. 文章没有讨论丙烷脱氢的工艺强化方法。

2. 文章没有分析影响丙烷脱氢可行性的技术经济因素。

3. 文章没有讨论丙烷脱氢的安全问题,如易燃性和爆炸危险。

4. 为了理解Co-MFI的优异PDH性能,C3H8-TPSR实验表明,与 Supported催化剂相比,Co-MFI上CH4、C2H4、C2H6等副产物很低,表明Co-MFI实现了高选择性的PDH催化。这意味着实现其他催化剂同样选择性PDH仍存在挑战。

5. 文章没有提出高通量计算催化剂筛选和设计方法。 

6. 文章没有强调需要改进原位表征工具以更好地理解PDH催化剂。

7. 文章没有设想可能实现PDH性能突破的转化催化剂结构。
