[5] DFT calculations have been applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways over Co-MFI. Specifically, the computational insights reveal:

- The CH bond dissociation of adsorbed propane (C3H8*) at the T3 site is the most energetically favorable with a kinetic barrier of 1.51 eV and a reaction free energy of 1.12 eV (Figure 4b). 

- The unique microenvironment at the T3 site results in very weak steric hindrance effects from the zeolite framework on the C3H7* intermediate, explaining the preference for this site (Page 8, paragraph 2).

- PDOS analysis shows the LUMO of propane shifts down when confined inside the Co-MFI zeolite, indicating propane can be preactivated by the Co-MFI environment (Figure 4c-d). 

- Bader charge analysis reveals dynamic charge transfer between the Co center and adsorbates during the reaction steps (Figure 4a).

5. DFT calculations reveal the T3 site in Co-MFI is most favorable for propane dehydrogenation, due to weak steric effects on the intermediate. Computational analysis also shows propane can be preactivated by the zeolite environment, and charge transfer occurs between Co and adsorbates.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation. No models, rate equations, or parameters are discussed.
