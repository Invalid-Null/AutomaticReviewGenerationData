[1] "Employing zeolites as the environment to accommodate Co sites is a promising approach to achieve a uniform Cozeolite catalytic system for efficient conversion, as well as for the structure definition, acid site identification, and catalysis understanding."

[2] "With zeolites as the support, metal species are encapsulated inside or highly dispersed on the zeolite surface resulting in nano- or subnano-scale metal particles, which are responsible for the high efficiency and long-life reaction performance of alkane dehydrogenation."

[3] "The ligand-protected hydrothermal synthesis approach can construct the isolated active center of {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2} with tetrahedrally coordinated Co species in Co-MFI, which presents high efficiency and selectivity in the PDH reaction." 

[4] "The cycle stability test demonstrates the high cycle stability of the Co-MFI catalyst."
