<quotes>

[1] "Catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O."  
[2] "The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio."
[3] "For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In."
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It prepares Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts by dispersing Pt on a hydrotalcite support containing In and Al. It finds the catalyst activity for propane dehydrogenation depends strongly on the In/Pt ratio, with maximum activity at In/Pt = 0.48 forming a PtIn alloy with 12% In.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,这篇文章评估了单金属Pt载体催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它通过在含有In和Al的水滑石支撑体上分散Pt来制备Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂。它发现催化剂对丙烷脱氢的活性强烈依赖于In/Pt比,In/Pt = 0.48时活性最高,形成含12% In的PtIn合金。

<quotes>

[1] "The average size of the Pt and PtIn particles is about 1 nm independent of the bulk In/Pt ratio of the catalyst."
[2] "With increasing bulk In/Pt ratios, the fraction of the alloy consisting of In increases linearly and the fraction of Pt atoms at the alloy surface capable of adsorbing H2 decreases." 
[3] "Whereas only 0.1% of the initial activity for ethane dehydrogenation is lost in 2 h on stream, 20% of the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation is lost over the same period."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of the supported Pt and PtIn catalysts. It finds the particle size is constant at 1 nm regardless of In content. Increasing In content linearly increases In fraction in the PtIn alloy and decreases exposed Pt sites. It also finds ethane dehydrogenation is more stable than propane dehydrogenation over 2 hours, attributed to differences in carbon deposition.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
答:是的,文章研究了像金属颗粒大小、形状和支持体相互作用等属性如何影响Pt和PtIn载体催化剂的性能。它发现无论In含量如何,粒径均为1 nm不变。In含量的增加会线性地增加PtIn合金中的In含量,并降低暴露的Pt位点。它还发现乙烷脱氢在2小时内比丙烷脱氢更稳定,这归因于碳沉积的差异。
