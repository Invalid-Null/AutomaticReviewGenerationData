<quotes>

[1] "The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In."  

[2] "Whereas only 0.1% of the initial activity for ethane dehydrogenation is lost in 2 h on stream, 20% of the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation is lost over the same period."

2. Yes, the article evaluates PtIn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows the propane dehydrogenation activity peaks at a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to 12% In in the PtIn alloy. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O-0.48 catalyst loses 20% of its initial propane dehydrogenation activity after 2 hours on stream.

2. 是的,该文评价了PtIn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它显示丙烷脱氢活性在体积In/Pt比为0.48时达到峰值,对应于PtIn合金中12%的In。PtIn/Mg(Al)O-0.48催化剂在2小时反应后丙烷脱氢初始活性损失20%。

[1] "With increasing bulk In/Pt ratios, the fraction of the alloy consisting of In increases linearly and the fraction of Pt atoms at the alloy surface capable of adsorbing H2 decreases."

[2] "Evidence is also found for increasing In to Pt charge transfer with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio."  

[3] "It is also observed that following reduction at 873 K, there is an increase in the Pt LIII edge energy by about 1 eV with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio. This shift in edge is a further indicator of alloy formation."

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal In in the PtIn bimetallic catalysts. It shows the In content in the PtIn alloy increases linearly with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio. There is evidence of increasing In to Pt charge transfer, and the Pt LIII edge shifts by ~1 eV with increasing In content, indicating modification of Pt's electronic structure by In in the alloy.

3. 是的,该文章研究了In作为二金属在PtIn双金属催化剂中的电子和几何效应。它显示随着体积In/Pt比的增加,PtIn合金中的In含量呈线性增加。有证据显示In到Pt的电荷转移在增加,并且随着In含量的增加,Pt LIII边缘产生约1 eV的位移,表明In在合金中改变了Pt的电子结构。
