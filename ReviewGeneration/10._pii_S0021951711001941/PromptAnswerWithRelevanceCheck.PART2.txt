[1] "Pt LIII edge XANES characterizes dipole transitions from the 2p3/2 to the 5d5/2 orbital, since the 5d3/2 orbital is fully occupied [46], [47]." 

[2] "Therefore, changes in the intensity of the white line indicate changes in the unoccupied states of the 5d5/2 orbital associated with metal oxidation and/or alloy formation."

[3] "It has generally been observed that the formation Pt alloys, such as PtSn [41], PtCu [42], PtIn [30], PtAu [43], leads to a decrease in white line intensity of Pt LIII edge."

[4] "The observed increase in Pt binding energy in both cases can be attributed to charge transfer from the alloying element to Pt since the electronegativity of Pt (2.28 eV) is higher than that of Sn (1.8 eV) or In (1.7 eV)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES) to examine changes in the electronic structure of Pt when alloyed with In. The data shows charge transfer from In to Pt due to differences in electronegativity, as well as changes in the occupancy of Pt 5d orbitals associated with alloy formation. These electronic structure changes are correlated with observed catalytic effects.

<quotes>

[1] "The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In."  

[2] "Whereas only 0.1% of the initial activity for ethane dehydrogenation is lost in 2 h on stream, 20% of the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation is lost over the same period."

</quotes>


<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article evaluates PtIn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows the propane dehydrogenation activity peaks at a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to 12% In in the PtIn alloy. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O-0.48 catalyst loses 20% of its initial propane dehydrogenation activity after 2 hours on stream.

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "With increasing bulk In/Pt ratios, the fraction of the alloy consisting of In increases linearly and the fraction of Pt atoms at the alloy surface capable of adsorbing H2 decreases."

[2] "Evidence is also found for increasing In to Pt charge transfer with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio."  

[3] "It is also observed that following reduction at 873 K, there is an increase in the Pt LIII edge energy by about 1 eV with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio. This shift in edge is a further indicator of alloy formation."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal In in the PtIn bimetallic catalysts. It shows the In content in the PtIn alloy increases linearly with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio. There is evidence of increasing In to Pt charge transfer, and the Pt LIII edge shifts by ~1 eV with increasing In content, indicating modification of Pt's electronic structure by In in the alloy.

[1] "This element can be introduced by coimpregnation of Pt and Sn precursors into a metal oxide support or by first forming a supported Pt catalyst and then impregnating it with a solution containing the Sn precursor." 

[2] "The properties of the catalyst have been found to depend on the composition of the Pt and Sn precursors and the catalyst preparation procedure [14]."

[3] "Pt LIII-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data shows that the In content of the bimetallic particles increases with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio and reduction temperature."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It mentions that Sn can be introduced by co-impregnation with Pt or by impregnating Sn onto existing Pt catalysts. It also notes that Pt-In catalyst properties depend less on preparation method compared to Pt-Sn. The article provides EXAFS data showing increasing In content in Pt-In particles with higher In/Pt ratio.

</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>

2. 是的,这篇文章评估了Pt-Sn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提到Sn可以通过与Pt共浸渍引入,或者通过在现有Pt催化剂上浸渍Sn引入。它还指出Pt-In催化剂的性质相比Pt-Sn而言不太依赖制备方法。文章提供了EXAFS数据,显示随着In/Pt比增加,Pt-In颗粒中的In含量增加。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that PtSn adsorbs ethene more weakly than pure Pt, and isotopic labeling studies conducted on PtSn/Mg(Al)O have shown that readsorption of ethene formed during ethane dehydrogenation is the primary cause of methane formation and the deposition of carbon."

[2] "As seen in Fig. 6, the incorporation of In into Pt nanoparticles results in an upward shift of Pt Fermi energy and, hence, a decrease in the d band vacancy." 

[3] "The electronic effect of In on Pt is evidenced by XAFS. As seen in Fig. 6, the incorporation of In into Pt nanoparticles results in an upward shift of Pt Fermi energy and, hence, a decrease in the d band vacancy."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic effects of the secondary metal on Pt. It shows Pt-Sn weakens ethene adsorption compared to pure Pt, and attributes increased selectivity to weakened readsorption and reduced coking. It also shows an upward shift in Pt Fermi energy with In incorporation, indicating electron donation from In to Pt that reduces d-band vacancies.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

3. 是的,这篇文章研究了副金属对Pt的电子效应。它显示Pt-Sn较纯Pt削弱了乙烯的吸附,并将选择性的提高归因于削弱的再吸附和减少的结焦。它还显示随着In掺入,Pt的费米能级上移,这表明In向Pt提供了电子,减少了d带空隙。

1. 文章没有比较金属和氧化的受支撑金属催化剂的选择性概况。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "Of the promoting elements listed earlier, the greatest attention has been given to Sn [13], [14], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. This element can be introduced by coimpregnation of Pt and Sn precursors into a metal oxide support or by first forming a supported Pt catalyst and then impregnating it with a solution containing the Sn precursor."

[2] "Pt LIII- and In K-edge XAS data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Lab on beamline 10-BM with a Si(1 1 1) monochromator crystal detuned by 40%. The sample was located between two ionization chambers, and a reference foil was placed after the second ionization chamber for energy calibration. Nitrogen and argon gas was used in the ionization chambers for Pt LIII- and In K-edges, respectively, and all samples were investigated in transmission mode."

[3] "The properties of the catalyst have been found to depend on the composition of the Pt and Sn precursors and the catalyst preparation procedure [14]."

[4] "Table 6 shows that for propane dehydrogenation, the catalyst activity decreases in the order Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O 0.48 > Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O 2.9 > PtSn/Mg(Al)O 0.6 > PtGa/Mg(Al)O 3.0 > Pt/Mg(Al)O."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
2. Yes, the article evaluates PtSn/Mg(Al)O catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on Pt LIII- and In K-edge XAS characterization of PtSn catalysts. It also compares the propane dehydrogenation performance of PtSn/Mg(Al)O to other catalysts including Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O and Pt/Mg(Al)O, showing PtSn/Mg(Al)O has higher activity than Pt/Mg(Al)O but lower than Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O. The performance depends on composition and preparation method.

<Chinese version answer>
2. 是的,文章评估了PtSn/Mg(Al)O催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供了PtSn催化剂的Pt LIII边缘和In K边缘XAS表征的数据。它还将PtSn/Mg(Al)O的丙烷脱氢性能与包括Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O和Pt/Mg(Al)O在内的其他催化剂进行了比较,结果显示PtSn/Mg(Al)O的活性高于Pt/Mg(Al)O,但低于Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O。性能取决于组成和制备方法。

<quotes>
[1] "EXAFS spectra of Pt/Mg(Al)O and Pt/Mg(In)(Al) reduced in H2 at 723 K (see supplementary material) were analyzed to determine the coordination numbers for PtPt, PtIn, and PtO nearest neighbors." 

[2] "Fig. 7 shows that the fraction of the alloy consisting of In increases almost linearly with the bulk In/Pt ratio, in Fig. 7."

[3] "The electronic effect of In on Pt is evidenced by XAFS. As seen in Fig. 6, the incorporation of In into Pt nanoparticles results in an upward shift of Pt Fermi energy and, hence, a decrease in the d band vacancy."

[4] "Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that PtSn adsorbs ethene more weakly than pure Pt, and isotopic labeling studies conducted on PtSn/Mg(Al)O have shown that readsorption of ethene formed during ethane dehydrogenation is the primary cause of methane formation and the deposition of carbon [53], [56]. Thus, it is reasonable to propose that In addition, similar with Sn addition, causes a decrease in alkene adsorption on Pt, leading to rapid desorption of alkenes and therefore high selectivity toward alkene production."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It analyzes EXAFS data to determine coordination numbers and alloy composition as a function of bulk In/Pt ratio. It shows In incorporation results in an upward shift in Pt Fermi energy and decrease in d-band vacancies. It relates this to weaker ethene adsorption on PtIn versus pure Pt, leading to higher selectivity, similar to PtSn.
