         [1] "Catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes were prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing In and Al, Mg(In)(Al)O."

         [2] "The dispersion of Pt on Pt/Mg(Al)(In)O was determined by H2 chemisorption using a AutoChem II 2920 (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation)."

         [3] "Electron micrographs of the support, with and without Pt, were taken using an aberration-corrected FEI Titan 80/300-kV TEM/STEM located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory."
