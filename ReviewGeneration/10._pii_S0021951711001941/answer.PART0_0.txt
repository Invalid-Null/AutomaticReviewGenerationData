 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes to the questions asked. The article is focused on synthesizing and characterizing Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. It does not provide background on the applications and value of propylene, explain general mechanisms of catalyst activity, introduce major catalyst classes for propane dehydrogenation, discuss thermodynamic or kinetic factors, or present computational or experimental work on structure-activity relationships. The article is narrowly focused on the catalyst synthesis and testing results.
