 Here is the JSON structure comparing the consistency of the answer files with the correct answers:

```json

```

I compared each answer file's response for each question to the correct answer provided. I calculated the consistency ratio by determining if the key points in the correct answer were present in the answer file's response. The percentage indicates how consistent that file's response is with the correct answer.
