To summarize, I carefully compared the answers provided in each file to the correct answers. I expressed the consistency as a percentage, with 100% meaning completely consistent and 0% meaning completely inconsistent. 

For most questions, all answer files were consistent with the correct answers. The only exceptions were:

Question 3: answer.PART3_3.txt provided an inconsistent answer stating the article does investigate methods to optimize active phase dispersion. 

Question 5: answer.PART3_3.txt provided an inconsistent answer stating advanced microscopy was used to characterize metal-support interfaces.

All other questions showed fully consistent answers across all files. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
