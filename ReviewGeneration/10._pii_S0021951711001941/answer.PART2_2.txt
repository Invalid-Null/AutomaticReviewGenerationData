[1] "This element can be introduced by coimpregnation of Pt and Sn precursors into a metal oxide support or by first forming a supported Pt catalyst and then impregnating it with a solution containing the Sn precursor." 

[2] "The properties of the catalyst have been found to depend on the composition of the Pt and Sn precursors and the catalyst preparation procedure [14]."

[3] "Pt LIII-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data shows that the In content of the bimetallic particles increases with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio and reduction temperature."

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It mentions that Sn can be introduced by co-impregnation with Pt or by impregnating Sn onto existing Pt catalysts. It also notes that Pt-In catalyst properties depend less on preparation method compared to Pt-Sn. The article provides EXAFS data showing increasing In content in Pt-In particles with higher In/Pt ratio.

2. 是的,这篇文章评估了Pt-Sn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提到Sn可以通过与Pt共浸渍引入,或者通过在现有Pt催化剂上浸渍Sn引入。它还指出Pt-In催化剂的性质相比Pt-Sn而言不太依赖制备方法。文章提供了EXAFS数据,显示随着In/Pt比增加,Pt-In颗粒中的In含量增加。

[1] "Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that PtSn adsorbs ethene more weakly than pure Pt, and isotopic labeling studies conducted on PtSn/Mg(Al)O have shown that readsorption of ethene formed during ethane dehydrogenation is the primary cause of methane formation and the deposition of carbon."

[2] "As seen in Fig. 6, the incorporation of In into Pt nanoparticles results in an upward shift of Pt Fermi energy and, hence, a decrease in the d band vacancy." 

[3] "The electronic effect of In on Pt is evidenced by XAFS. As seen in Fig. 6, the incorporation of In into Pt nanoparticles results in an upward shift of Pt Fermi energy and, hence, a decrease in the d band vacancy."

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic effects of the secondary metal on Pt. It shows Pt-Sn weakens ethene adsorption compared to pure Pt, and attributes increased selectivity to weakened readsorption and reduced coking. It also shows an upward shift in Pt Fermi energy with In incorporation, indicating electron donation from In to Pt that reduces d-band vacancies.

3. 是的,这篇文章研究了副金属对Pt的电子效应。它显示Pt-Sn较纯Pt削弱了乙烯的吸附,并将选择性的提高归因于削弱的再吸附和减少的结焦。它还显示随着In掺入,Pt的费米能级上移,这表明In向Pt提供了电子,减少了d带空隙。
