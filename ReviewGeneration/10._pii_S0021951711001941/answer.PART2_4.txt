[1] "Of the promoting elements listed earlier, the greatest attention has been given to Sn [13], [14], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. This element can be introduced by coimpregnation of Pt and Sn precursors into a metal oxide support or by first forming a supported Pt catalyst and then impregnating it with a solution containing the Sn precursor."

[2] "Pt LIII- and In K-edge XAS data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Lab on beamline 10-BM with a Si(1 1 1) monochromator crystal detuned by 40%. The sample was located between two ionization chambers, and a reference foil was placed after the second ionization chamber for energy calibration. Nitrogen and argon gas was used in the ionization chambers for Pt LIII- and In K-edges, respectively, and all samples were investigated in transmission mode."

[3] "The properties of the catalyst have been found to depend on the composition of the Pt and Sn precursors and the catalyst preparation procedure [14]."

[4] "Table 6 shows that for propane dehydrogenation, the catalyst activity decreases in the order Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O 0.48 > Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O 2.9 > PtSn/Mg(Al)O 0.6 > PtGa/Mg(Al)O 3.0 > Pt/Mg(Al)O."

2. Yes, the article evaluates PtSn/Mg(Al)O catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on Pt LIII- and In K-edge XAS characterization of PtSn catalysts. It also compares the propane dehydrogenation performance of PtSn/Mg(Al)O to other catalysts including Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O and Pt/Mg(Al)O, showing PtSn/Mg(Al)O has higher activity than Pt/Mg(Al)O but lower than Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O. The performance depends on composition and preparation method.

2. 是的,文章评估了PtSn/Mg(Al)O催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供了PtSn催化剂的Pt LIII边缘和In K边缘XAS表征的数据。它还将PtSn/Mg(Al)O的丙烷脱氢性能与包括Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O和Pt/Mg(Al)O在内的其他催化剂进行了比较,结果显示PtSn/Mg(Al)O的活性高于Pt/Mg(Al)O,但低于Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O。性能取决于组成和制备方法。

[1] "EXAFS spectra of Pt/Mg(Al)O and Pt/Mg(In)(Al) reduced in H2 at 723 K (see supplementary material) were analyzed to determine the coordination numbers for PtPt, PtIn, and PtO nearest neighbors." 

[2] "Fig. 7 shows that the fraction of the alloy consisting of In increases almost linearly with the bulk In/Pt ratio, in Fig. 7."

[3] "The electronic effect of In on Pt is evidenced by XAFS. As seen in Fig. 6, the incorporation of In into Pt nanoparticles results in an upward shift of Pt Fermi energy and, hence, a decrease in the d band vacancy."

[4] "Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that PtSn adsorbs ethene more weakly than pure Pt, and isotopic labeling studies conducted on PtSn/Mg(Al)O have shown that readsorption of ethene formed during ethane dehydrogenation is the primary cause of methane formation and the deposition of carbon [53], [56]. Thus, it is reasonable to propose that In addition, similar with Sn addition, causes a decrease in alkene adsorption on Pt, leading to rapid desorption of alkenes and therefore high selectivity toward alkene production."

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It analyzes EXAFS data to determine coordination numbers and alloy composition as a function of bulk In/Pt ratio. It shows In incorporation results in an upward shift in Pt Fermi energy and decrease in d-band vacancies. It relates this to weaker ethene adsorption on PtIn versus pure Pt, leading to higher selectivity, similar to PtSn.

3. 是的,文章研究了双金属和合金催化剂中次要金属的电子和几何效应。它分析EXAFS数据以确定配位数和合金组成与体积In/Pt比的关系。它显示In的引入导致Pt Fermi能级上移和d带空穴减少。它将这与PtIn上乙烯的吸附较纯Pt弱相关联,从而导致选择性更高,类似于PtSn。
