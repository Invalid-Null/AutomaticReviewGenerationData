I carefully compared the content of each answer file to the correct answers provided. For questions where the answer files contained the same relevant information as the correct answers, I assigned a consistency ratio of 100%. For questions where the answer files did not address the question or lacked key details present in the correct answers, I assigned a consistency ratio of 0%.

The XML format organizes the comparison by question, with each question containing the consistency ratios for the corresponding answer across the multiple answer text files. This allows you to see at a glance where there is agreement or disagreement between the answer files and correct answers for each specific question.

Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
