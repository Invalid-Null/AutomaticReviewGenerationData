         [1] "This element can be introduced by coimpregnation of Pt and Sn precursors into a metal oxide support or by first forming a supported Pt catalyst and then impregnating it with a solution containing the Sn precursor."
         [2] "The properties of the catalyst have been found to depend on the composition of the Pt and Sn precursors and the catalyst preparation procedure [14]." 
         [3] "Pt LIII- and In K-edge XAS data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Lab on beamline 10-BM with a Si(1 1 1) monochromator crystal detuned by 40%. The sample was located between two ionization chambers, and a reference foil was placed after the second ionization chamber for energy calibration. Nitrogen and argon gas was used in the ionization chambers for Pt LIII- and In K-edges, respectively, and all samples were investigated in transmission mode." 
         [4] "Table 6 shows that for propane dehydrogenation, the catalyst activity decreases in the order Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O 0.48 > Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O 2.9 > PtSn/Mg(Al)O 0.6 > PtGa/Mg(Al)O 3.0 > Pt/Mg(Al)O."

         Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn catalysts like PtSn/Mg(Al)O for propane dehydrogenation. It provides XAS characterization data and compares propane dehydrogenation performance to other catalysts, showing PtSn has higher activity than Pt but lower than PtIn alloys. The performance depends on composition and preparation method.

         是的,文章评价了PtSn/Mg(Al)O等Pt-Sn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供了XAS表征数据,并与其他催化剂的丙烷脱氢性能进行了比较,结果显示PtSn的活性高于Pt,但低于PtIn合金。性能取决于组成和制备方法。

         [1] "EXAFS spectra of Pt/Mg(Al)O and Pt/Mg(In)(Al) reduced in H2 at 723 K (see supplementary material) were analyzed to determine the coordination numbers for PtPt, PtIn, and PtO nearest neighbors."
         [2] "Fig. 7 shows that the fraction of the alloy consisting of In increases almost linearly with the bulk In/Pt ratio, in Fig. 7." 
         [3] "The electronic effect of In on Pt is evidenced by XAFS. As seen in Fig. 6, the incorporation of In into Pt nanoparticles results in an upward shift of Pt Fermi energy and, hence, a decrease in the d band vacancy."
         [4] "Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that PtSn adsorbs ethene more weakly than pure Pt, and isotopic labeling studies conducted on PtSn/Mg(Al)O have shown that readsorption of ethene formed during ethane dehydrogenation is the primary cause of methane formation and the deposition of carbon [53], [56]. Thus, it is reasonable to propose that In addition, similar with Sn addition, causes a decrease in alkene adsorption on Pt, leading to rapid desorption of alkenes and therefore high selectivity toward alkene production."

         Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metals like In and Sn in bimetallic Pt catalysts using XAFS data. It shows In/Sn incorporation modifies Pt's electronic structure and weakens ethene adsorption, leading to higher selectivity. 
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         是的,文章使用XAFS数据研究了如In和Sn等副金属在双金属Pt催化剂中的电子和几何效应。它显示In/Sn的掺入改变了Pt的电子结构,削弱了乙烯的吸附,从而提高了选择性。
