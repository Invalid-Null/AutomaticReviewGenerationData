 Unfortunately the provided answers do not contain relevant information to address the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts and supported metal catalysts. As the answers indicate, the article focuses on ethane and propane dehydrogenation over Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts and does not provide insights into the topics outlined in the questions. 

Since the answers are not relevant to the questions asked, I will stop my review process and simply respond:
