 Unfortunately, this literature does not contain information relevant to answering any of the questions asked. The questions seem focused on propane dehydrogenation, catalyst design, process intensification, techno-economic analysis, safety issues, and future research directions in that area. However, the given literature is a study on hydrogen production from methane steam reforming using a palladium membrane reactor. It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or related topics asked about in the questions.
