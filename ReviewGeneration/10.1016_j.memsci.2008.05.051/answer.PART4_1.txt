 Unfortunately, I do not see any quotes in the given literature that are relevant to answering the questions about propane dehydrogenation. The questions ask about process intensification approaches, techno-economic analysis, safety issues, remaining challenges, use of high-throughput computational methods, and new catalyst architectures specifically for propane dehydrogenation, but the literature is about methane steam reforming in a palladium membrane reactor. There is no mention of propane or propane dehydrogenation.

Therefore, my response is:

<English version answer>
1. No, the article does not discuss process intensification approaches that can be applied to propane dehydrogenation. It is about methane steam reforming.

2. No, the article does not analyze techno-economic factors affecting the viability of propane dehydrogenation processes. It is about methane steam reforming.  

3. No, the article does not discuss safety issues like flammability and explosion hazards associated with propane dehydrogenation. It is about methane steam reforming.

4. No, the article does not summarize remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It is about methane steam reforming.

5. No, the article does not propose leveraging high-throughput computational methods to accelerate propane dehydrogenation catalyst screening and design. It is about methane steam reforming.  

6. No, the article does not highlight needs for improved in-situ characterization tools to better understand propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It is about methane steam reforming.

7. No, the article does not envision potentially transformational catalyst architectures that could enable performance breakthroughs in propane dehydrogenation. It is about methane steam reforming.
