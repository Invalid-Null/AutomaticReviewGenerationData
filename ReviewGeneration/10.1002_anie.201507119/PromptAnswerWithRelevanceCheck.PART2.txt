<quotes>

[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions.1 An alumina-supported Pt catalyst is a vital component of the DHP process owing to its superior ability to activate paraffinic CH bonds and its low activity in CC bond cleavage. Further addition of a Sn promoter has proved necessary to obtain the optimum catalyst.2"

[2] "A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst shows its sheet-like morphology with distinct surface roughness (Figure1A). Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images show that small discrete clusters, with sizes ranging from 0.91.6nm and a mean diameter of 1.3nm, are homogenously distributed on the surface of the Al2O3 nanosheet (Figure1B,C)." 

[3] "Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) element mapping analysis (FigureS1) visually confirmed that the clusters on the Al2O3 nanosheets consist of both Pt and Sn atoms."

[1] "Further addition of a Sn promoter has proved necessary to obtain the optimum catalyst.2"  

[2] "In the case of Al2O3 supports, the coordinatively unsaturated aluminum atoms have a great impact on the anchoring Pt atoms and on maintaining high stability.6"

[3] "Combining the results of the Sn 3d XPS (Figure2C) and the temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR; FigureS5), it could be confirmed that Sn is mainly present in the +2 valence state in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst.15"

[4] "All of these results, especially the new band at 2010cm1 and the disappearance of the vibration at 2040cm1 in the CO DRIFT spectra, directly corroborate the hypothesis that there are strong electronic interactions between Pt and Sn in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst, while the reduced frequency of the CO vibration clearly demonstrates an increase in the electron density on Pt."

[1] "A further H2/O2 titration measurement (Supporting Information, TableS1) showed that the dispersity of Pt is close to 100%, suggesting that almost all of the Pt atoms are exposed on the surface."
