<quotes>

[1] "A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst shows its sheet-like morphology with distinct surface roughness (Figure1A)."

[2] "Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) element mapping analysis (FigureS1) visually confirmed that the clusters on the Al2O3 nanosheets consist of both Pt and Sn atoms."  

[3] "The propane dehydrogenation reaction was investigated under atmospheric pressure at 590C. As shown in Figure3A, the initial conversion of propane on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was 48.7% at a space velocity (WHSV) of 9.4h1 near equilibrium (50%) in a feed of 16.2kPa C3H8, 20.3kPa H2, and N2 balance."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides TEM data showing Pt-Sn clusters on Al2O3 supports with sheet-like morphology (Quote 1). EDX mapping confirmed Pt and Sn on the clusters (Quote 2). Catalytic testing showed 48.7% propane conversion at WHSV 9.4 h-1 using PtSn/Al2O3 (Quote 3). 

</English version answer>

[1] "Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images show that small discrete clusters, with sizes ranging from 0.91.6nm and a mean diameter of 1.3nm, are homogenously distributed on the surface of the Al2O3 nanosheet (Figure1B,C)."

[2] "Combining the results of the Sn 3d XPS (Figure2C) and the temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR; FigureS5), it could be confirmed that Sn is mainly present in the +2 valence state in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst."

[3] "STEM analysis (Figure4A,B) showed that the size and morphology of Pt-Sn clusters supported on the Al2O3 sheet had undergone negligible changes even after a 24h dehydrogenation reaction, which demonstrates the excellent sintering resistance of this catalyst."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like particle size, shape and support interactions affect performance of Pt-Sn catalysts. HAADF-STEM showed small 1.3 nm clusters homogenously distributed on Al2O3, indicating strong metal-support interactions (Quote 1). XPS and H2-TPR confirmed Sn2+ species interacting with Pt (Quote 2). After reactions, Pt-Sn clusters maintained size and morphology, demonstrating excellent thermal stability (Quote 3).

[1] "An alumina-supported Pt catalyst is a vital component of the DHP process owing to its superior ability to activate paraffinic CH bonds and its low activity in CC bond cleavage."

[2] "Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images show that small discrete clusters, with sizes ranging from 0.9-1.6nm and a mean diameter of 1.3nm, are homogenously distributed on the surface of the Al2O3 nanosheet."

[3] "Combining the results of the Sn 3d XPS (Figure 2C) and the temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR; Figure S5), it could be confirmed that Sn is mainly present in the +2 valence state in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst."

[1] "To further clarify the effect of unsaturated Al3+ sites on the structure of the supported Pt-Sn clusters, a commercial γ-Al2O3 carrier (denoted Al2O3ref., Alfa Aesar) with only few (5%) pentacoordinate Al3+ sites (Figure2A, FigureS3) was chosen for comparative studies and loaded with Pt and Sn using the same preparation procedure as for our PtSn/Al2O3 sheet." 

[2] "Combining the results of the Sn 3d XPS (Figure2C) and the temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR; FigureS5), it could be confirmed that Sn is mainly present in the +2 valence state in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst.15 All of these results, especially the new band at 2010cm1 and the disappearance of the vibration at 2040cm1 in the CO DRIFT spectra, directly corroborate the hypothesis that there are strong electronic interactions between Pt and Sn in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst, while the reduced frequency of the CO vibration clearly demonstrates an increase in the electron density on Pt."

11. The article compares a PtSn/Al2O3 nanosheet catalyst rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ sites to a reference PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst with fewer pentacoordinate sites. The nanosheet catalyst showed smaller and better dispersed PtSn clusters due to strong metal-support interactions with the unsaturated Al3+ sites. This led to increased electron density on the Pt sites.
