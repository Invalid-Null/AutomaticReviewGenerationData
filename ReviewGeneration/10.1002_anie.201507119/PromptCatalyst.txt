Graphical Abstract
Stable and selective: γ-Al2O3 nanosheets rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ ions can well disperse and stabilize raft-like Pt-Sn clusters, which results in an increase of the electron density of the Pt sites. This material catalyzes the conversion of propane into propylene with >99 % selectivity, and minimizes coke formation and sintering processes.
Abstract
In heterogeneous catalysis, supports play a crucial role in modulating the geometric and electronic structure of the active metal phase for optimizing the catalytic performance. A γ-Al2O3 nanosheet that contains 27 % pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can nicely disperse and stabilize raft-like Pt-Sn clusters as a result of strong interactions between metal and support. Consequently, there are strong electronic interactions between the Pt and Sn atoms, resulting in an increase in the electron density of the Pt sites. When used in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, this catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99 % selectivity, and superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties. Its exceptional ability to maintain the high activity and stability at ultrahigh space velocities further showed that the sheet construction of the catalyst facilitated the kinetic transfer process.

The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions.1 An alumina-supported Pt catalyst is a vital component of the DHP process owing to its superior ability to activate paraffinic CH bonds and its low activity in CC bond cleavage. Further addition of a Sn promoter has proved necessary to obtain the optimum catalyst.2 Nevertheless, the fast deactivation of the catalyst by coke deposition or Pt sintering is still a major problem.3 During the DHP process, coke formation generally occurs as a result of side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, and isomerization, that are sensitive to the Pt particle size.4 Therefore, the use of smaller Pt particles can effectively inhibit coke formation. Alternatively, increasing the electron density on the Pt atoms can also effectively weaken the adsorption of alkene molecules and coke precursors, thus reducing coke deposition.5
The catalyst support plays a crucial role in modulating the geometric and electronic structure of active metal phases for optimizing the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. In the case of Al2O3 supports, the coordinatively unsaturated aluminum atoms have a great impact on the anchoring Pt atoms and on maintaining high stability.6 From a kinetics point of view, thin, sheet-like nanoarchitectures are an ideal choice for improving the mass-transfer and diffusion kinetics,7 which can in principle inhibit the secondary reaction that generates coke. However, owing to the structural complexity and our poor understanding of the crystalline structures of Al2O3, it is still challenging to precisely tailor the structure of Al2O3 for optimizing the catalyst performance.8
Herein, a highly active and stable PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for the DHP reaction has been synthesized, using γ-Al2O3 nanosheets as a support that is rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ ions. Such Al2O3 nanosheets perform extremely well in dispersing and stabilizing raft-like Pt-Sn clusters. The electronic interactions between the two metals and the electron densities of the Pt sites are thus increased. Together with the improved diffusion kinetics caused by the nanosheet structure, these properties simultaneously and substantially increase the catalytic reactivity and especially the catalyst stability in the DHP reaction.
A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst shows its sheet-like morphology with distinct surface roughness (Figure 1 A). Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images show that small discrete clusters, with sizes ranging from 0.9–1.6 nm and a mean diameter of 1.3 nm, are homogenously distributed on the surface of the Al2O3 nanosheet (Figure 1 B, C). A higher-magnification STEM image reveals that these clusters are tightly attached to the surface of the Al2O3 nanosheet, indicating a strong interaction between metal and support (Figure 1 D). A small number of isolated atoms and dimers or trimers were also observed, as shown in the magnified area (Figure 1 E). The intensity profiles of the close-up images (Figure 1 F, G) show that the annular dark-field intensities of clusters along the F direction in Figure 1 E are 1 to 1.5 times higher than that of an individual atom in the G direction, indicating that the cluster consists of a stack with a thickness of less than two atoms.9 A further H2/O2 titration measurement (Supporting Information, Table S1) showed that the dispersity of Pt is close to 100 %, suggesting that almost all of the Pt atoms are exposed on the surface. These results nicely support the conclusion that the clusters on the Al2O3 nanosheet have a raft-like structure and experience strong metal–support interactions. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) element mapping analysis (Figure S1) visually confirmed that the clusters on the Al2O3 nanosheets consist of both Pt and Sn atoms. All of these observations suggest that the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet is an excellent support for dispersing and stabilizing raft-like Pt-Sn clusters because of the strong metal–support interactions.

For the γ-Al2O3 nanosheets, several XRD diffraction peaks, namely (222), (311), and (511), that are sensitive to the Al3+ distribution8c are extremely weak or even absent (Figure S2), indicating a high degree of Al3+ disorder. To obtain a definitive picture of the local structure of the Al3+ cations, the nanosheets were analyzed by two-dimensional 27Al multiple-quantum magic angle spinning (MQ MAS) NMR spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 2 A, three distinct Al species were observed for the Al2O3 sheet and PtSn/Al2O3 sheet samples. The isotropic chemical shifts (δiso, Table S2) of 11 ppm and 74 ppm represent Al3+ ions with octahedral [Al(VI)] and tetrahedral [Al(IV)] coordination geometries, respectively.10 The resonance at approximately 41 ppm was attributed to unsaturated Al3+ cations with pentahedral coordination [Al(V)].11 It is generally accepted that surface Al3+ centers with unsaturated coordination are the important anchoring sites for maintaining the high dispersion and thermal stability of the catalytically active phase.6 The Al2O3 nanosheet synthesized in this work contains a large percentage (27 %) of pentacoordinate Al3+ sites (Figure S3). This unique structure could account for the formation of the highly dispersed and stabilized Pt-Sn clusters on its surface.

To further clarify the effect of unsaturated Al3+ sites on the structure of the supported Pt-Sn clusters, a commercial γ-Al2O3 carrier (denoted Al2O3 ref., Alfa Aesar) with only few (5 %) pentacoordinate Al3+ sites (Figure 2 A, Figure S3) was chosen for comparative studies and loaded with Pt and Sn using the same preparation procedure as for our PtSn/Al2O3 sheet. Instead of the complete dispersion of PtSn on the Al2O3 sheet surface, TEM images of the PtSn/Al2O3 ref. catalyst revealed the presence of a considerable number of three-dimensional nanoparticles with sizes of 2 to 3 nm (Figure S4). H2/O2 titration analysis revealed a lower Pt dispersity (Table S1), which is consistent with the TEM results. These data clearly demonstrate that the dispersion state and the morphology of the Pt-Sn active phase are strongly affected by the interaction with unsaturated Al(V) sites.
As mentioned previously, the electronic states of active phases are another crucial factor that influences the catalytic behavior.12 DRIFT spectroscopy with CO as the probe was used to investigate the local electronic environment of Pt. As shown in Figure 2 B, the adsorption of CO on the Pt/Al2O3 sheet catalyst produced a vibration at 2040 cm−1 and a visible shoulder at 2070 cm−1. The former can be assigned to the linear adsorption of CO on Pt sites with saturated coordination, whereas the latter corresponds to coordinatively unsaturated Pt sites.13 For the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst, a new and strong band appeared at 2010 cm−1 while the band at 2040 cm−1 vanished.
It was previously reported that Sn was more inclined to selectively cover low-coordination Pt sites in the Pt-Sn system.14 Given that the Sn addition is the only difference, such a change in the CO vibration frequency must originate from the interaction of Pt and Sn species. Metallic Sn or Sn2+ species in close contact with Pt are able to transfer electrons to the 5d band of Pt.5 Combining the results of the Sn 3d XPS (Figure 2 C) and the temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR; Figure S5), it could be confirmed that Sn is mainly present in the +2 valence state in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst.15 All of these results, especially the new band at 2010 cm−1 and the disappearance of the vibration at 2040 cm−1 in the CO DRIFT spectra, directly corroborate the hypothesis that there are strong electronic interactions between Pt and Sn in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst, while the reduced frequency of the CO vibration clearly demonstrates an increase in the electron density on Pt. On the other hand, CO DRIFT spectroscopy of the PtSn/Al2O3 ref. catalyst revealed a strong vibration band at 2070 cm−1 and a small vibration at 2015 cm−1, suggesting that Pt and Sn only weakly interact in this reference catalyst. By comparing the Sn/Al(V) ratios (Table S2) and H2 consumption (Figure S5) of the two catalysts during reduction, it was confirmed that Sn can maintain a higher dispersion on the surface of the Al2O3 sheet. Therefore, in this sheet catalyst, the probability for a Sn species to be located in close proximity to a Pt species is high, which leads to the stronger electronic interactions. These SnO promoter interactions will further help to disperse and stabilize the tiny Pt clusters, especially during the course of reactions. Overall, these geometric and electronic features are very attractive for a dehydrogenation catalyst with excellent catalytic reactivity and stability.
The propane dehydrogenation reaction was investigated under atmospheric pressure at 590 °C. As shown in Figure 3 A, the initial conversion of propane on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was 48.7 % at a space velocity (WHSV) of 9.4 h−1 near equilibrium (50 %) in a feed of 16.2 kPa C3H8, 20.3 kPa H2, and N2 balance. After 24 h, the dehydrogenation reaction showed a very small decrease in conversion of 0.17 % per hour, suggesting that only slight deactivation had occurred. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity was as high as 99.1 % after a 24 h test. On the other hand, for the PtSn/Al2O3 reference catalyst, propane conversion dramatically dropped from an initial 43.8 % to 28.3 % after 24 h. The propylene selectivity was also lower than for the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst. A first-order deactivation model was used to evaluate the catalyst stability (for details, see the Supporting Information).16 As shown in Table S3, a low deactivation rate of 0.007 h−1 and a catalyst life time of 143 h for the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst quantitatively demonstrate its high stability compared to the PtSn/Al2O3 ref. catalyst (0.026 h−1, 38 h). The propylene yields of these two PtSn-based catalysts and previously developed catalysts are compared as a function of the deactivation rate in Figure 3 B. The best yield at a low kd value clearly demonstrates the superior reactivity and stability of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst in the DHP reaction. To optimize its dehydrogenation performance, the WHSV effect was further investigated. As shown in Figure 3 C and Table S3, when an ultra-high WHSV of 56.5 h−1 was used, a very high specific rate (i.e., the moles of C3H6 formed per mole of Pt per second) of 5.36 s−1 and a low deactivation rate (0.014 h−1) were achieved with the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst; these values are superior to those of state-of-the-art Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts (Tables S3 and S4).2

It is important to note that the 2D sheet structure might promote diffusion and thereby influence the catalytic behavior in the DHP reaction. When higher space velocities are used, the effects of mass transfer and diffusion on the reaction rate will be more obvious. The increase in the specific activity of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was substantially larger than that of the PtSn/Al2O3 ref. catalyst when the WHSV was increased from 1.9 h−1 to 56.5 h−1 (Figure 3 C). This trend reveals that the sheet-like construction of the catalyst has a great impact on the catalyzed reactions, mostly likely by accelerating mass transfer and diffusion and, possibly, by allowing easy heat transfer. From the kinetics point of view, these results nicely confirm the promoting role of this nanosheet catalyst in the DHP reaction.
Characterization of the spent catalysts was performed to shed further light on the correlation between the high reaction rate and stability of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst and its structure. STEM analysis (Figure 4 A, B) showed that the size and morphology of Pt-Sn clusters supported on the Al2O3 sheet had undergone negligible changes even after a 24 h dehydrogenation reaction, which demonstrates the excellent sintering resistance of this catalyst. As mentioned earlier, coke deposition during propane dehydrogenation is another main cause of catalyst deactivation;2 therefore, the amount, type, and location of the coke formed on the two Pt-Sn catalysts were studied. As shown in Figure 4 C, the amount (3.7 %) of coke deposited on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet was much lower than on the PtSn/Al2O3 ref. (7.6 %) catalyst. A comparison of the intensity ratios (ID1/IG=0.85 vs. 0.79, AD/AG=3.11 vs. 2.92) of the D to G bands in the Raman spectra (Figure 4 D) of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet and PtSn/Al2O3 ref. catalysts suggests that the coke on the surface of the former is more amorphous.17 The TPO profiles (Figure 4 C) of the two spent catalysts reveal that most of the coke is located on the support surface.18 Pt dispersion measurements (Table S1) for the spent catalysts further imply that the proportion of active sites covered by coke is far smaller for the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet than for the PtSn/Al2O3 ref. catalyst. The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (C3H6-TPD; Figure 4 E) profiles indicate that the interaction between the C3H6 molecules and the metal sites is weaker for the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet than for the PtSn/Al2O3 ref. catalyst. This weak interaction minimizes coke formation of the electron-rich C3H6 on the metal sites of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet during reactions, which therefore remain highly stable under the reaction conditions.19 These results account for the experimental observation that the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was only slightly deactivated during a 24 h dehydrogenation reaction, whereas a dramatic deactivation was observed for the PtSn/Al2O3 ref. catalyst.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a γ-Al2O3 nanosheet that contains a large amount of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions is exceptionally able of dispersing and stabilizing Pt-Sn clusters. We could clarify that the electronic interactions between the two metals are enhanced on such a support, which leads to an increase in the electron density of the Pt sites. In the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, this catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99 % selectivity, and did not suffer from coke formation or sintering processes. Our work has also demonstrated that the sheet construction of the catalyst facilitates mass-transfer and kinetically controlled diffusion processes during propane dehydrogenation.
Experimental Section
The Pt-Sn catalysts supported by Al2O3 nanosheets were prepared using the incipient co-impregnation method. Propane dehydrogenation was performed in a fixed-bed reactor with a feed consisting of C3H8/H2/N2 (1:1.25:4) under atmospheric pressure at 590 °C. The amount of deposited coke was determined by combustion of the deposited material on a thermogravimetric analyzer. For details, see the Supporting Information.
