[1] "Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images show that small discrete clusters, with sizes ranging from 0.91.6nm and a mean diameter of 1.3nm, are homogenously distributed on the surface of the Al2O3 nanosheet."

[2] "A higher-magnification STEM image reveals that these clusters are tightly attached to the surface of the Al2O3 nanosheet, indicating a strong interaction between metal and support." 

[3] "STEM analysis (Figure4A,B) showed that the size and morphology of Pt-Sn clusters supported on the Al2O3 sheet had undergone negligible changes even after a 24h dehydrogenation reaction, which demonstrates the excellent sintering resistance of this catalyst."
