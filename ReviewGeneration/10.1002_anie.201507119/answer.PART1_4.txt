[1] "To further clarify the effect of unsaturated Al3+ sites on the structure of the supported Pt-Sn clusters, a commercial γ-Al2O3 carrier (denoted Al2O3ref., Alfa Aesar) with only few (5%) pentacoordinate Al3+ sites (Figure2A, FigureS3) was chosen for comparative studies and loaded with Pt and Sn using the same preparation procedure as for our PtSn/Al2O3 sheet." 

[2] "Combining the results of the Sn 3d XPS (Figure2C) and the temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR; FigureS5), it could be confirmed that Sn is mainly present in the +2 valence state in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst.15 All of these results, especially the new band at 2010cm1 and the disappearance of the vibration at 2040cm1 in the CO DRIFT spectra, directly corroborate the hypothesis that there are strong electronic interactions between Pt and Sn in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst, while the reduced frequency of the CO vibration clearly demonstrates an increase in the electron density on Pt."

11. The article compares a PtSn/Al2O3 nanosheet catalyst rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ sites to a reference PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst with fewer pentacoordinate sites. The nanosheet catalyst showed smaller and better dispersed PtSn clusters due to strong metal-support interactions with the unsaturated Al3+ sites. This led to increased electron density on the Pt sites.

11. 文章比较了一个富含五配位Al3+位点的PtSn/Al2O3纳米片催化剂和一个五配位位点更少的参考PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。纳米片催化剂由于与不饱和Al3+位点的强烈金属-支撑相互作用而显示出更小和更好分散的PtSn簇。这导致Pt位点上的电子密度增加。
