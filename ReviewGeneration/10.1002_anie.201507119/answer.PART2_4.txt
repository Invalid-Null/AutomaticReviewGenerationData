[1] "A further H2/O2 titration measurement (Supporting Information, TableS1) showed that the dispersity of Pt is close to 100%, suggesting that almost all of the Pt atoms are exposed on the surface."

[2] "Given that the Sn addition is the only difference, such a change in the CO vibration frequency must originate from the interaction of Pt and Sn species."  

[3] "Metallic Sn or Sn2+ species in close contact with Pt are able to transfer electrons to the 5d band of Pt."

[4] "Combining the results of the Sn 3d XPS (Figure2C) and the temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR; FigureS5), it could be confirmed that Sn is mainly present in the +2 valence state in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst."

[5] "All of these results, especially the new band at 2010cm1 and the disappearance of the vibration at 2040cm1 in the CO DRIFT spectra, directly corroborate the hypothesis that there are strong electronic interactions between Pt and Sn in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst, while the reduced frequency of the CO vibration clearly demonstrates an increase in the electron density on Pt."

<English version answer>

1. No, the article does not compare selectivity profiles of metallic vs oxidized supported metal catalysts.

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and stability for Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts. 

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of Sn as a secondary metal with Pt. It shows Sn helps disperse and stabilize tiny Pt clusters on the support due to strong metal-support interactions. The close proximity of Sn and Pt leads to electron transfer from Sn to Pt, increasing Pt electron density.

4. No, the article does not explore the use of subsurface promoters like Re or Mn.

5. Yes, the article describes synergistic ensemble and ligand effects between Pt and Sn. The presence of Sn helps disperse Pt and increases Pt electron density, enhancing activity and stability.

6. No, the article does not evaluate zeolite supports.

7. No, the article does not investigate effects of varying Si/Al ratio or mesoporosity.

1. 否,该文献没有比较金属氧化物支持的金属催化剂的选择性谱。

2. 是的,该文献评估了用于丙烷脱氢的 Pt-Sn 双金属催化剂。它提供了 Pt-Sn/Al2O3 催化剂的丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和稳定性数据。

3. 是的,该文献研究了 Sn 作为 Pt 的二次金属时的电子和几何效应。它表明 Sn 有助于通过强的金属-载体相互作用在载体上分散和稳定 Pt 微团簇。Sn 和 Pt 的近距离接触导致从 Sn 向 Pt 的电子传递,增加 Pt 的电子密度。

4. 否,该文献没有探讨如 Re 或 Mn 等次表面促进剂的使用。
