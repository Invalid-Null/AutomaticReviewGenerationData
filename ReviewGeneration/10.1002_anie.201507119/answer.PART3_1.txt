[1] "In heterogeneous catalysis, supports play a crucial role in modulating the geometric and electronic structure of the active metal phase for optimizing the catalytic performance."

[2] "The catalyst support plays a crucial role in modulating the geometric and electronic structure of active metal phases for optimizing the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability."

[3] "To obtain a definitive picture of the local structure of the Al3+ cations, the nanosheets were analyzed by two-dimensional 27Al multiple-quantum magic angle spinning (MQ MAS) NMR spectroscopy." 

[4] "These results nicely support the conclusion that the clusters on the Al2O3 nanosheet have a raft-like structure and experience strong metalsupport interactions."

24. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using Al2O3 nanosheets as supports which contain a large percentage of pentacoordinate Al3+ sites. These sites interact strongly with the Pt-Sn active phase, helping disperse and stabilize tiny raft-like clusters as confirmed by HAADF-STEM imaging and H2/O2 titration.

[1] "Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images show that small discrete clusters, with sizes ranging from 0.91.6nm and a mean diameter of 1.3nm, are homogenously distributed on the surface of the Al2O3 nanosheet."

[2] "A higher-magnification STEM image reveals that these clusters are tightly attached to the surface of the Al2O3 nanosheet, indicating a strong interaction between metal and support." 

[3] "STEM analysis (Figure4A,B) showed that the size and morphology of Pt-Sn clusters supported on the Al2O3 sheet had undergone negligible changes even after a 24h dehydrogenation reaction, which demonstrates the excellent sintering resistance of this catalyst."

26. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides images showing tiny 1.3 nm Pt-Sn clusters tightly attached to the Al2O3 sheet support, even after 24 hours of reaction. This demonstrates a strong metal-support interaction and excellent sintering resistance.
