[1] "In heterogeneous catalysis, supports play a crucial role in modulating the geometric and electronic structure of the active metal phase for optimizing the catalytic performance." 

[2] "The catalyst support plays a crucial role in modulating the geometric and electronic structure of active metal phases for optimizing the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability."

[3] "Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images show that small discrete clusters, with sizes ranging from 0.91.6nm and a mean diameter of 1.3nm, are homogenously distributed on the surface of the Al2O3 nanosheet."

[4] "A γ-Al2O3 nanosheet that contains a large amount of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions is exceptionally able of dispersing and stabilizing Pt-Sn clusters."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a large percentage of pentacoordinate Al3+ sites as a support, which helps disperse and stabilize small Pt-Sn clusters with a narrow size distribution. Aberration-corrected STEM imaging confirmed the high dispersion of discrete 0.9-1.6 nm clusters achieved.

[1] "Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images show that small discrete clusters, with sizes ranging from 0.91.6nm and a mean diameter of 1.3nm, are homogenously distributed on the surface of the Al2O3 nanosheet." 

[2] "STEM analysis showed that the size and morphology of Pt-Sn clusters supported on the Al2O3 sheet had undergone negligible changes even after a 24h dehydrogenation reaction, which demonstrates the excellent sintering resistance of this catalyst."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced aberration-corrected STEM imaging to characterize the metal-support interface and morphology in the propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows that 0.9-1.6 nm Pt-Sn clusters are uniformly dispersed on the Al2O3 nanosheet support. STEM of spent catalysts also revealed negligible sintering or changes in cluster morphology after reaction.  
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答案:是的,该文采用了先进的球差校正 STEM 成像来表征丙烷脱氢催化剂的金属-载体界面和形态。它显示 0.9-1.6 nm 的 Pt-Sn 簇均匀分散在 Al2O3 纳米片载体上。反应后催化剂的 STEM 也显示在反应后簇的烧结或形态变化可忽略。
