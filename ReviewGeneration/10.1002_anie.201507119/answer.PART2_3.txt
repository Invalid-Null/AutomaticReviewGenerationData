<quotes>

[1] "Further addition of a Sn promoter has proved necessary to obtain the optimum catalyst.2"  

[2] "In the case of Al2O3 supports, the coordinatively unsaturated aluminum atoms have a great impact on the anchoring Pt atoms and on maintaining high stability.6"

[3] "Combining the results of the Sn 3d XPS (Figure2C) and the temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR; FigureS5), it could be confirmed that Sn is mainly present in the +2 valence state in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst.15"

[4] "All of these results, especially the new band at 2010cm1 and the disappearance of the vibration at 2040cm1 in the CO DRIFT spectra, directly corroborate the hypothesis that there are strong electronic interactions between Pt and Sn in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst, while the reduced frequency of the CO vibration clearly demonstrates an increase in the electron density on Pt."

2. Yes, the article evaluates the Pt-Sn bimetallic catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing that adding Sn as a promoter to Pt/Al2O3 improves the catalyst stability and minimizes coking. The article also provides insights into how Sn interacts electronically with Pt, increasing electron density on Pt sites.
