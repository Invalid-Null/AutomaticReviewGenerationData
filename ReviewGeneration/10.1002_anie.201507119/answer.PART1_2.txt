[1] "An alumina-supported Pt catalyst is a vital component of the DHP process owing to its superior ability to activate paraffinic CH bonds and its low activity in CC bond cleavage."

[2] "Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images show that small discrete clusters, with sizes ranging from 0.9-1.6nm and a mean diameter of 1.3nm, are homogenously distributed on the surface of the Al2O3 nanosheet."

[3] "Combining the results of the Sn 3d XPS (Figure 2C) and the temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR; Figure S5), it could be confirmed that Sn is mainly present in the +2 valence state in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst."  

[4] "By comparing the Sn/Al(V) ratios (Table S2) and H2 consumption (Figure S5) of the two catalysts during reduction, it was confirmed that Sn can maintain a higher dispersion on the surface of the Al2O3 sheet."

<English version answer>

1. The article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation.

2. The article does not investigate how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance.

3. The article does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over any studied metal oxide catalysts. 

4. The article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

5. The article evaluates an alumina-supported Pt catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It states that this catalyst is important for activating paraffinic C-H bonds while minimizing C-C bond cleavage.

6. The article shows Pt-Sn clusters of 0.9-1.6 nm size distributed on alumina support. It confirms Sn is present as Sn2+ and has higher dispersion on the sheet alumina support compared to reference alumina.

7. The article does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the Pt-Sn/alumina catalyst.

8. The article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir.
