<quotes>
[1] "The Pt3Sn alloy phase forms at the surface of Pt in the early stage of alloy formation, and Sn propagates gradually to the center of the particle as a result of Sn diffusion. Pt3Sn is also proposed as an effective candidate for alkane dehydrogenation. Especially, propane dehydrogenation is intriguing as a highly value-added on-purpose process for propene production."

[2] "With the addition of Sn and the formation of a Pt3Sn alloy, the initial propane conversion increases to 40%, and the propene selectivity increases to 92%, which is attributed to the geometric effect and electronic effect of the Pt-Sn alloy."

[3] "The initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of monometallic Pt/SBA-15 are 24 and 65%, respectively." 

[4] "With Sn addition, the carbon balance is up to 0.98, implying that the C3H8 feed gas is primarily converted to carbon-containing species in the gas state."

[5] "The formation rate of propene over Pt-Sn/SBA-15 is 20 mol C3H6·gPt1·h1, much higher than the 8 mol C3H6·gPt1·h1 over Pt/SBA-15, suggesting excellent activity of the Pt-Sn catalyst."

5. Yes, the article evaluates the supported mono-metallic Pt catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing the Pt/SBA-15 catalyst has 24% propane conversion and 65% propene selectivity. With the addition of Sn to form a Pt-Sn alloy, conversion increases to 40% and selectivity to 92%, attributed to geometric and electronic effects. The Pt-Sn catalyst has higher propene formation rate and carbon balance compared to monometallic Pt, suggesting superior performance.

[1] "The Pt3Sn alloy surface is determined to be recoverable and thermodynamically preferable by experiments and DFT calculations. In this study, an acid etching-reduction process was used to modulate the loss of Sn and investigate the structure evolution of the Pt-Sn alloy catalyst after Sn loss. Based on quasi in situ XPS, TEM, EDS, etc., the surface Sn species were removed during acid etching, and the Pt3Sn alloy surface got restored easily during the followed reduction because the Sn atoms at the alloy core can segregate to the surface once the Sn content at the surface is insufficient, driven by the negative segregation energy."

[2] "Coupling structure characterizations and catalytic performance, the Sn segregation for the surface recovery of the Pt-Sn alloy is revealed to be fundamentally important for sustaining the high catalytic efficiency of Pt-Sn catalysts upon component fluctuations."

[3] "This discovery of the surface recoverability provides an interesting way of engineering nanostructure for catalysis and other applications."

7. Yes, the article proposes that the mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over the Pt-Sn catalyst involves the recoverable Pt3Sn alloy surface. Experiments and calculations show Sn atoms can segregate from the core to the surface to restore the Pt3Sn structure when surface Sn is lost. This Sn segregation is crucial for sustaining high catalytic efficiency despite component fluctuations. The recoverable nanostructure provides a new approach to engineering catalysts.
