[1] "Quasi in situ XPS was used to provide further insights into the surface property and composition over Pt-Sn/SBA-15 after the calcination-reduction procedure, which was conducted without being exposed to air."

[2] "When switching the atmosphere from H2 to a mixture of C3H8 and H2, an atmosphere of propane dehydrogenation, we find that the peak positions of Pt0 and Sn0 in XPS profiles (Figure 2) are almost unchangeable after 60 min of exposure, indicating the existence of an alloy structure during propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "Fringe spacings expanded from 0.225 nm of Pt(111) (Figure 1a) to 0.237 nm of Pt3Sn(111) (Figure 1b). These phenomena indicate that the relatively larger Sn atoms were incorporated into the Pt lattice to form a disordered Pt3Sn alloy with the face-centered cubic (fcc) configuration maintained."
