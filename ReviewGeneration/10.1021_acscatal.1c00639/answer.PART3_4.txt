[1] The article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports.

[2] The article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability.

[3] The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it discusses using a co-impregnation method with SBA-15 as the support to synthesize well-dispersed Pt-Sn nanoparticles. 

[4] The article utilizes quasi in situ XPS to study propane dehydrogenation catalysts under reaction conditions. This reveals changes in Pt and Sn oxidation states and allows analysis of the Pt/Sn ratio at the surface.

[5] The article employs HRTEM and STEM/EDS mapping to characterize metal-support interfaces and distribution in Pt-Sn/SBA-15 propane dehydrogenation catalysts. This provides insights into nanoparticle size, composition, and structure.

[6] The article does not use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis.

[7] The article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation. It only studies catalyst performance in a fixed bed reactor.
