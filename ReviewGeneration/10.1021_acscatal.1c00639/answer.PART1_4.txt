[1] "Pt-Sn catalysts always play a unique role as one of the commercial catalysts."
[2] "Pt/SBA-15 and Pt-Sn/SBA-15 catalysts were synthesized by coimpregnation followed by a calcination-reduction procedure."
[3] "Over Pt-Sn/SBA-15, the ratio of Pt0/Sn0 determined by XPS is around 2.55, close to the one of the Pt3Sn alloy (Table S1)."
[4] "The Pt3Sn phase forms at the surface of Pt in the early stage of alloy formation, and Sn propagates gradually to the center of the particle as a result of Sn diffusion." 
[5] "With the introduction of Sn and the formation of a Pt3Sn alloy, the initial propane conversion increases to 40%, and the propene selectivity increases to 92%, which is attributed to the geometric effect and electronic effect of the Pt-Sn alloy."
[6] "The formation rate of propene over Pt-Sn/SBA-15 is 20 mol C3H6·gPt1·h1, much higher than the 8 mol C3H6·gPt1·h1 over Pt/SBA-15, suggesting excellent activity of the Pt-Sn catalyst."
