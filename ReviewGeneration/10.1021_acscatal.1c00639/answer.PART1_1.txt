[1] "Various efficient Pt-based catalysts, such as Pt-Sn, (23,3133) Pt-Ga, (34,35) Pt-Cu, (36,37) Pt-Mn, (38) Pt-Co, (39) Pt-Fe, (17,40) and Pt-In (41) have been applied in this reaction, but Pt-Sn catalysts always play a unique role as one of the commercial catalysts. Nonetheless, few investigations are conducted to reveal the surface recoverability of the Pt-Sn alloy and its role in catalysis, which could provide fundamental insights into engineering the nanostructure of Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts and revealing their structureperformance relationships from a new perspective."  

[2] "In terms of TEM measurements, the particle size distribution of Pt/SBA-15 is broad and around 8.1 nm (Figure 1a), while the size of supported nanoparticles over Pt-Sn/SBA-15 is centered at 7.6 nm (Figure 1b), suggesting a decreased particle size after addition of Sn."

[3] "The introduction of Sn helps to improve the dispersion of Pt and minimize sintering of nanoparticles, consistent with the geometric effect over Pt-Sn catalysts." 

[4] "Fringe spacings expanded from 0.225 nm of Pt(111) (Figure 1a) to 0.237 nm of Pt3Sn(111) (Figure 1b). These phenomena indicate that the relatively larger Sn atoms were incorporated into the Pt lattice to form a disordered Pt3Sn alloy with the face-centered cubic (fcc) configuration maintained."

[5] "The energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) line profiles and maps show the coexistence of Pt and Sn at both the surface and the core of nanoparticles over Pt-Sn/SBA-15, illustrating the formation of Pt-Sn alloy nanoparticles (Figure 1d,e)."
