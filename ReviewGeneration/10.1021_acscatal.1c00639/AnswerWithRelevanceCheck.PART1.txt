         [1] "Pt-Sn catalysts always play a unique role as one of the commercial catalysts."
         [2] "Pt/SBA-15 and Pt-Sn/SBA-15 catalysts were synthesized by coimpregnation followed by a calcination-reduction procedure."
         [3] "Over Pt-Sn/SBA-15, the ratio of Pt0/Sn0 determined by XPS is around 2.55, close to the one of the Pt3Sn alloy (Table S1)."
         [4] "The Pt3Sn phase forms at the surface of Pt in the early stage of alloy formation, and Sn propagates gradually to the center of the particle as a result of Sn diffusion."  
         [5] "With the introduction of Sn and the formation of a Pt3Sn alloy, the initial propane conversion increases to 40%, and the propene selectivity increases to 92%, which is attributed to the geometric effect and electronic effect of the Pt-Sn alloy."
         [6] "The formation rate of propene over Pt-Sn/SBA-15 is 20 mol C3H6·gPt1·h1, much higher than the 8 mol C3H6·gPt1·h1 over Pt/SBA-15, suggesting excellent activity of the Pt-Sn catalyst."

         [1] "The introduction of Sn helps to improve the dispersion of Pt and minimize sintering of nanoparticles, consistent with the geometric effect over Pt-Sn catalysts." 
         [2] "With the addition of Sn and the formation of a Pt3Sn alloy, the initial propane conversion increases to 40%, and the propene selectivity increases to 92%, which is attributed to the geometric effect and electronic effect of the Pt-Sn alloy."

         [1] "The catalytic performance of Pt-Sn/SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation was evaluated and compared to that of monometallic Pt/SBA-15."
         [2] "With the addition of Sn and the formation of a Pt3Sn alloy, the initial propane conversion increases to 40%, and the propene selectivity increases to 92%, which is attributed to the geometric effect and electronic effect of the Pt-Sn alloy."

         Yes, the article evaluates monometallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It compares the performance of Pt/SBA-15 to Pt-Sn/SBA-15, showing Pt-Sn has higher propane conversion (40% vs 24%) and propene selectivity (92% vs 65%). This improved performance is attributed to geometric and electronic effects of the Pt-Sn alloy.
