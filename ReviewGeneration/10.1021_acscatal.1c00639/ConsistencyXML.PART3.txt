I carefully compared each answer file's responses to the correct answers provided and calculated a percentage consistency score for each question. For questions where the answer file provided no relevant information, I assigned 0% consistency. For questions where the answer file matched the correct answer, I assigned 100% consistency. The XML structure organizes this comparison with a <question> element for each question number, containing <answer> elements with the percentage consistency score for each file.
