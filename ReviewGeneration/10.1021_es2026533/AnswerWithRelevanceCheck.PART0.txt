 ※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※

The answers do not contain information relevant to the set of questions asked about propane dehydrogenation, catalyst design, reaction mechanisms, kinetics modeling, computational studies, structure-activity relationships, etc. The answers focus on an unrelated topic of atmospheric photolysis of o-tolualdehyde. 

As the answers are not pertinent to the questions posed, I have provided the single sentence response indicating their irrelevance as instructed.
