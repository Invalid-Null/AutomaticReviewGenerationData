[1] "However, the current ODHP processes have a big problem of the overoxidation of propene, which is more reactive than propane, into thermodynamically stable CO/CO2, resulting in insufficient propene selectivity."

[2] "The ODHP would save 45.0% of the energy consumption because of the favorable thermodynamic features including exothermicity and lower reaction temperatures."

[3] "Compared with the nonoxidative process, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) would save 45.0% of the energy consumption because of the favorable thermodynamic features including exothermicity and lower reaction temperatures."  

[4] "The apparent activation energies (Ea) of propane ODH were calculated based on the Arrhenius equation."

Answer: The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers. It states that oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has favorable thermodynamics compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation, being exothermic and requiring lower temperatures, thus saving 45% of energy consumption. It also calculates and compares apparent activation energies using the Arrhenius equation to quantify kinetics.

[1] "However, the current ODHP processes have a big problem of the overoxidation of propene, which is more reactive than propane, into thermodynamically stable CO/CO2, resulting in insufficient propene selectivity."

[2] "The ODHP also has superior catalyst durability by preventing the coke formation on the catalyst surface."

[3] "The apparent activation energies (Ea) of propane ODH were calculated based on the Arrhenius equation."

[4] "Kinetic insights were obtained by measuring the reaction rates with different reactant concentrations, giving first-order rate dependence with respect to propane partial pressure and zero-order rate dependence in oxygen partial pressure over the MnOx/CeO2-SOSI catalyst."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article discusses the thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. It mentions the problem of overoxidation of propene to CO/CO2 due to thermodynamic stability. It also notes coke formation affects catalyst durability. Kinetically, it calculates apparent activation energies, and shows the reaction has first order dependence on propane partial pressure but is zero order in oxygen.
