[1] "The key technique is to anchor the amorphous manganese oxide with thin-layer morphology on a ceria support, which forms strong oxidesupport interactions (SOSIs) with interfacial MnOCe sites for carbonhydrogen bond activation and oxygen-deficient manganese oxide layers to hinder the propene overoxidation under the ODHP conditions."

[2] "According to these results, it was proposed that different reaction regions exist on the MnOx/CeO2-SOSI catalyst, including the propane activation on the interfacial oxygen sites and propene stabilization on the oxygen-deficient Mn sites."

[3] "Specifically, propane was activated on the interfacial oxygen species to form propene. Both the propane and propene could be overoxidized by the interfacial oxygen of MnOCe and the surface oxygen of MnOx layers (MnOMn) of the as-synthesized MnOx/CeO2-SOSI catalyst at the beginning of the reaction, forming oxygen-deficient MnOxCeO2 interfaces and MnOx layers." 

[4] "The interfacial oxygen can be easily regenerated, while the oxygen defects on MnOx layers are stabilized by the SOSI to hinder the oxygen regeneration under the ODHP conditions."

[5] "In the subsequent propane dehydrogenation, propene, which might be as-formed on the interface, can be significantly stabilized by the oxygen-deficient Mn sites because of the favorable interaction between Mn2+ sites and the nucleophilic CC group."

[6] "The lack of active oxygen on these Mn sites could efficiently hinder the overoxidation."

Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the Mn-Ce oxide catalyst studied. It describes propane activation occurring on interfacial Mn-O-Ce sites to form propene. Then propene can be stabilized on oxygen-deficient Mn sites, while interfacial oxygen and MnOx layer oxygen can cause overoxidation to COx initially. But oxygen defects in MnOx layers are stabilized by strong oxide-support interactions, hindering full oxygen regeneration and overoxidation. This allows propene to be protected on oxygen-deficient Mn sites.

答:该文针对所研究的Mn-Ce氧化物催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢的机理场景。其描述了丙烷在Mn-O-Ce界面的位点活化生成丙烯。然后丙烯可以稳定在氧缺损的Mn位点上,而界面氧和MnOx层氧最初可以导致COx的过氧化。但是MnOx层中的氧缺陷受到强氧化物载体相互作用的稳定,抑制了完全的氧再生和过氧化。这使得丙烯可以被保护在氧缺损的Mn位点上。

[1] "Our characterizations have confirmed the existence of stable oxygen defects on the amorphous MnOx layers of MnOx/CeO2-SOSI, which exhibits the same kinetic behavior as the supported vanadium oxide catalysts." 

[2] "The MnOx species should play a dominant role in the ODHP because the bare CeO2 support exhibits CO2 as a dominant product with low propane transformation rate and high apparent activation energy."

[3] "Decreasing the MnOx loading in MnOx/CeO2-SOSI reduced the catalytic activity, but the propene selectivity was mostly maintained, while raising the MnOx loading led to overoxidation."

[4] "These results indicate that the MnOx-related species rather than the bare ceria are the active sites for the catalytic turnover." 

[5] "The SOSI, which stabilizes the oxygen-deficient Mn species under the ODHP conditions, displays the crucial role for realizing the unusual performances, which even outperform the practically promising vanadium oxide catalysts."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explores metal-support interfacial effects in the Mn-Ce oxide catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that MnOx species, rather than bare CeO2, are the active sites. Strong oxide-support interactions between MnOx and CeO2 help stabilize oxygen defects on MnOx layers, which is key to achieving high propene selectivity that exceeds vanadium oxide catalysts. Decreasing MnOx loading reduces activity but maintains selectivity, while increasing MnOx causes overoxidation, further demonstrating the role of MnOx-CeO2 interfaces.

答:该文探究了Mn-Ce氧化物催化剂中金属-载体界面效应对丙烷脱氢的影响。其显示MnOx物种而非裸CeO2是活性位点。MnOx与CeO2之间的强氧化物载体相互作用有助于稳定MnOx层上的氧缺陷,这是实现高丙烯选择性以超过钒氧化物催化剂的关键。减少MnOx负载会降低活性但保持选择性,而增加MnOx会导致过氧化,进一步证明了MnOx-CeO2界面的作用。
