[1] The current dominant route for propene production is the steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, which relies on the raw materials from crude oil. 
[2] Compared with the nonoxidative process, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) would save 45.0% of the energy consumption because of the favorable thermodynamic features including exothermicity and lower reaction temperatures.
[3] However, the current ODHP processes have a big problem of the overoxidation of propene, which is more reactive than propane, into thermodynamically stable CO/CO2, resulting in insufficient propene selectivity.

2. Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is more favorable thermodynamically than non-oxidative dehydrogenation, but it suffers from overoxidation of propene to COx due to high reactivity of lattice oxygen.

[1] These phenomena suggest that the MnOx/CeO2-SOSI catalyst might follow a similar mechanism of vanadium oxide catalysts in tuning the reaction pathways from combustion to selective ODHP: the surface oxygen is modulated to hinder the overoxidation.
[2] When propane was introduced (Figure 5a), the mode of MnOx was unchanged in position but remarkably decreased in intensity with a rise in the temperature (Figures 5a, S33a, and S34a). This phenomenon might be due to the primary interaction of propane with the MnOxCeO2 interfacial oxygen species, which is well consistent with the general knowledge that the CH bond in hydrocarbons easily reacts with the active oxygen on the interface with an asymmetric Coulomb interaction with Mn and Ce.  
[3] Introducing propene to the MnOx/CeO2-SOSI catalyst led to a red shift in the Raman mode of MnOx from 656 to 652 cm-1 (Figure 5b), which is different from the phenomenon observed in the propane case. This might be assigned to the fact that the nucleophilic CC group in propene favors to react with the oxygen-deficient Mn rather than O sites, in good agreement with the phenomenon in the literature.

3. Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. It suggests propane is activated on MnOx-CeO2 interfacial sites to form propene. Propene can further react with oxygen-deficient Mn sites, which stabilizes propene against overoxidation. The specific steps involve propane reacting with interfacial oxygen species, propene interacting with Mn sites, and modulation of surface oxygen to prevent overoxidation.

3. 答:文中确实提出了金属氧化物催化剂促进丙烷脱氢反应的机理假说。该机理认为丙烷在MnOx-CeO2界面活性位发生活化生成丙烯,丙烯进一步与缺氧Mn位点反应,抑制过氧化。具体步骤包括丙烷与界面氧反应、丙烯与Mn位点作用,以及调控表面氧种抑制过氧化。
