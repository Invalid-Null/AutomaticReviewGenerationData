<English version answer>

1. Answer: No, the article does not evaluate any Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses solely on manganese oxide based catalysts.

2. Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of manganese oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that anchoring amorphous manganese oxide on ceria support creates active interfacial oxygen sites for propane activation and oxygen-deficient manganese oxide layers that stabilize propene and hinder overoxidation. 

3. Answer: Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario where propane is activated on the interfacial Mn-O-Ce oxygen species to form propene. Propene can then be stabilized by the oxygen-deficient Mn sites which lack active oxygen species. This prevents overoxidation of propene.

4. Answer: Yes, the article extensively explores metal-support interfacial effects between Mn oxide and Ce oxide. It shows anchoring amorphous MnOx on CeO2 creates strong interfacial interactions that generate active sites for propane activation and propene stabilization, improving activity and selectivity.

<quotes>
[1] "The key technique is to anchor the amorphous manganese oxide with thin-layer morphology on a ceria support, which forms strong oxidesupport interactions (SOSIs) with interfacial MnOCe sites for carbonhydrogen bond activation and oxygen-deficient manganese oxide layers to hinder the propene overoxidation under the ODHP conditions."

[2] "According to these results, it was proposed that different reaction regions exist on the MnOx/CeO2-SOSI catalyst, including the propane activation on the interfacial oxygen sites and propene stabilization on the oxygen-deficient Mn sites."

[3] "Specifically, propane was activated on the interfacial oxygen species to form propene. Both the propane and propene could be overoxidized by the interfacial oxygen of MnOCe and the surface oxygen of MnOx layers (MnOMn) of the as-synthesized MnOx/CeO2-SOSI catalyst at the beginning of the reaction, forming oxygen-deficient MnOxCeO2 interfaces and MnOx layers." 

[4] "The interfacial oxygen can be easily regenerated, while the oxygen defects on MnOx layers are stabilized by the SOSI to hinder the oxygen regeneration under the ODHP conditions."

[5] "In the subsequent propane dehydrogenation, propene, which might be as-formed on the interface, can be significantly stabilized by the oxygen-deficient Mn sites because of the favorable interaction between Mn2+ sites and the nucleophilic CC group."

[6] "The lack of active oxygen on these Mn sites could efficiently hinder the overoxidation."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the Mn-Ce oxide catalyst studied. It describes propane activation occurring on interfacial Mn-O-Ce sites to form propene. Then propene can be stabilized on oxygen-deficient Mn sites, while interfacial oxygen and MnOx layer oxygen can cause overoxidation to COx initially. But oxygen defects in MnOx layers are stabilized by strong oxide-support interactions, hindering full oxygen regeneration and overoxidation. This allows propene to be protected on oxygen-deficient Mn sites.

答:该文针对所研究的Mn-Ce氧化物催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢的机理场景。其描述了丙烷在Mn-O-Ce界面的位点活化生成丙烯。然后丙烯可以稳定在氧缺损的Mn位点上,而界面氧和MnOx层氧最初可以导致COx的过氧化。但是MnOx层中的氧缺陷受到强氧化物载体相互作用的稳定,抑制了完全的氧再生和过氧化。这使得丙烯可以被保护在氧缺损的Mn位点上。

[1] "Our characterizations have confirmed the existence of stable oxygen defects on the amorphous MnOx layers of MnOx/CeO2-SOSI, which exhibits the same kinetic behavior as the supported vanadium oxide catalysts." 

[2] "The MnOx species should play a dominant role in the ODHP because the bare CeO2 support exhibits CO2 as a dominant product with low propane transformation rate and high apparent activation energy."

[3] "Decreasing the MnOx loading in MnOx/CeO2-SOSI reduced the catalytic activity, but the propene selectivity was mostly maintained, while raising the MnOx loading led to overoxidation."

[4] "These results indicate that the MnOx-related species rather than the bare ceria are the active sites for the catalytic turnover." 

[5] "The SOSI, which stabilizes the oxygen-deficient Mn species under the ODHP conditions, displays the crucial role for realizing the unusual performances, which even outperform the practically promising vanadium oxide catalysts."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explores metal-support interfacial effects in the Mn-Ce oxide catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that MnOx species, rather than bare CeO2, are the active sites. Strong oxide-support interactions between MnOx and CeO2 help stabilize oxygen defects on MnOx layers, which is key to achieving high propene selectivity that exceeds vanadium oxide catalysts. Decreasing MnOx loading reduces activity but maintains selectivity, while increasing MnOx causes overoxidation, further demonstrating the role of MnOx-CeO2 interfaces.

<Chinese version answer>  
答:该文探究了Mn-Ce氧化物催化剂中金属-载体界面效应对丙烷脱氢的影响。其显示MnOx物种而非裸CeO2是活性位点。MnOx与CeO2之间的强氧化物载体相互作用有助于稳定MnOx层上的氧缺陷,这是实现高丙烯选择性以超过钒氧化物催化剂的关键。减少MnOx负载会降低活性但保持选择性,而增加MnOx会导致过氧化,进一步证明了MnOx-CeO2界面的作用。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] The current dominant route for propene production is the steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, which relies on the raw materials from crude oil. 
[2] Compared with the nonoxidative process, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) would save 45.0% of the energy consumption because of the favorable thermodynamic features including exothermicity and lower reaction temperatures.
[3] However, the current ODHP processes have a big problem of the overoxidation of propene, which is more reactive than propane, into thermodynamically stable CO/CO2, resulting in insufficient propene selectivity.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
2. Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is more favorable thermodynamically than non-oxidative dehydrogenation, but it suffers from overoxidation of propene to COx due to high reactivity of lattice oxygen.

<Chinese version answer>
2. 答:文中探讨了调控金属氧化物的氧化态、氧的迁移能力以及酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢反应性能。结果表明,丙烷氧化脱氢反应相比非氧化脱氢反应在热力学上更有利,但过量氧化丙烯生成COx的问题更严重,因为晶格氧的高活性。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] These phenomena suggest that the MnOx/CeO2-SOSI catalyst might follow a similar mechanism of vanadium oxide catalysts in tuning the reaction pathways from combustion to selective ODHP: the surface oxygen is modulated to hinder the overoxidation.
[2] When propane was introduced (Figure 5a), the mode of MnOx was unchanged in position but remarkably decreased in intensity with a rise in the temperature (Figures 5a, S33a, and S34a). This phenomenon might be due to the primary interaction of propane with the MnOxCeO2 interfacial oxygen species, which is well consistent with the general knowledge that the CH bond in hydrocarbons easily reacts with the active oxygen on the interface with an asymmetric Coulomb interaction with Mn and Ce.  
[3] Introducing propene to the MnOx/CeO2-SOSI catalyst led to a red shift in the Raman mode of MnOx from 656 to 652 cm-1 (Figure 5b), which is different from the phenomenon observed in the propane case. This might be assigned to the fact that the nucleophilic CC group in propene favors to react with the oxygen-deficient Mn rather than O sites, in good agreement with the phenomenon in the literature.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. It suggests propane is activated on MnOx-CeO2 interfacial sites to form propene. Propene can further react with oxygen-deficient Mn sites, which stabilizes propene against overoxidation. The specific steps involve propane reacting with interfacial oxygen species, propene interacting with Mn sites, and modulation of surface oxygen to prevent overoxidation.

[1] "The Mn0.05Ce0.95Ox, MnOx/CeO2, MnOx/SiO2, and MnO2 dominantly catalyze the combustion rather than ODHP, giving insufficient propene production rates with high selectivity to invaluable CO/CO2 (50.0–78.0%) (Figures 3b and S21)."  
[2] "Compared with the general manganese oxide catalysts, the most significant advantage of MnOx/CeO2-SOSI is tuning the reaction pathways from combustion to the selective oxidative dehydrogenation."
[3] "By the construction of manganese oxide with amorphous and layered structures on the ceria matrix, the obtained MnOx/CeO2-SOSI catalyst modulates surface oxygen to hinder the overoxidation of propene on the oxygen-deficient Mn sites."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
4. Answer: The article explores metal-support interfacial effects in the MnOx/CeO2-SOSI catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that depositing amorphous, layered MnOx on ceria leads to strong oxide-support interactions that modulate surface oxygen species. This tunes the reaction pathways from combustion to selective oxidative dehydrogenation by hindering propene overoxidation on oxygen-deficient Mn sites. In contrast, Mn oxides without ceria support like MnO2 show high combustion selectivity.
