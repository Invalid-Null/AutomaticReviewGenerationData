<Answer>

 Unfortunately, the given literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the provided questions about propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The article focuses on comparing single atom catalysts (SAC), single atom alloy catalysts (SAAC), and surface organometallic chemistry catalysts (SOMCat) for various catalytic reactions, but does not evaluate propane dehydrogenation specifically. It does not discuss effects of metal oxidation state, Pt alloying, electronic/geometric effects of metals, use of promoters, synergistic effects in bimetallics, or zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation.

Since there is no relevant information in the literature to answer the questions, my response for each question is:

 Unfortunately the given literature does not contain any relevant information to directly answer the specific questions asked. The article is a broad review comparing single atom catalysis (SAC), single atom alloy catalysis (SAAC), and surface organometallic catalysis (SOMCat) methodologies. While propane dehydrogenation is discussed briefly in the context of SOMCat and SAC, the article does not provide any data or insights on the specific areas asked about in the questions, such as effects of metal oxidation state, Pt bimetallic catalysts, zeolite supports and structure-function relationships.

Since there is no relevant content in the literature to quote, I cannot provide numbered quotes. My answers to each question are below:
