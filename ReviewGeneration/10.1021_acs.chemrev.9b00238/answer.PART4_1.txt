 Unfortunately, the given literature does not contain any relevant quotes or information to answer the specific questions about propane dehydrogenation. The article is a broad review comparing single atom catalysis (SAC), surface organometallic catalysis (SOMCat), and single atom alloy catalysis (SAAC) across various reaction types, but does not focus specifically on propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss process intensification, techno-economic factors, safety issues, remaining challenges, high-throughput computational screening, in-situ characterization, or potentially transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation.
