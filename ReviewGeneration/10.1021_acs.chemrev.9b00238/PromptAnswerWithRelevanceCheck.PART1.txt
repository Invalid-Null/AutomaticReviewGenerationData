<Answer>
 Unfortunately this literature review does not contain relevant information to answer the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation catalysts, their performance evaluation, mechanistic investigations, metal-support interactions, etc. The review focuses on comparing single atom catalysis (SAC), single atom alloy catalysis (SAAC) and surface organometallic catalysis (SOMCat) across different reaction types like hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, alkane metathesis, methane activation etc., but does not go into significant depth on any specific catalytic reaction. Since the questions are seeking detailed insights on propane dehydrogenation catalysts, which this review does not substantially cover, I cannot provide relevant quotes or answers from the given literature.

 Unfortunately the given literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the provided questions about propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The article is a review comparing single atom catalysis (SAC), single atom alloy catalysis (SAAC), and surface organometallic catalysis (SOMCat). It focuses on characterizing techniques, computational tools, and classifications of catalytic reactions, but does not go into detail on propane dehydrogenation specifically. The article does not evaluate promising metal oxide or supported metal catalysts, investigate how their properties affect performance, propose mechanistic scenarios, or explore metal-support interfacial effects for propane dehydrogenation.
