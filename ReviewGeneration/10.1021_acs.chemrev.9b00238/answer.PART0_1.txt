 Unfortunately, the given literature does not provide any details related to propane dehydrogenation or propylene production. The literature is focused on comparing single atom catalysis (SAC), surface organometallic catalysis (SOMC), and single atom alloy catalysis (SAAC) methodologies for applications like hydrogenation, alkane metathesis, dehydrogenation, methane activation etc. It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation specifically. Therefore, I am unable to provide any relevant quotes or answers to the questions.
