 Based on reviewing the document, it does not appear to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses various catalysts for different reactions, but does not focus specifically on propane dehydrogenation. Since the document is not relevant to propane dehydrogenation, I will not enumerate the catalysts or attempt to identify the main contribution.
