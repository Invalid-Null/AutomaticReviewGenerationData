 Unfortunately, there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that directly answer the specific questions about propane dehydrogenation. The article focuses on comparing single atom catalysts prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMCat) and single atom catalysis (SAC), and does not analyze technical or economic factors related to propane dehydrogenation specifically. A few examples of propane dehydrogenation catalysts prepared by SOMCat are discussed briefly, but no details on process intensification, techno-economics, safety, challenges, computational screening, in-situ characterization, or transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation are provided.
