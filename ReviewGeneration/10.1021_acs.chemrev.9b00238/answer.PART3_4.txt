 Unfortunately, there are no relevant quotes from the literature provided that directly answer the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The literature review focuses more broadly on comparing single atom catalysts prepared via surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) and single atom catalysis (SAC) for various catalytic reactions, and does not go into details on propane dehydrogenation specifically.

1. The article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. Propane dehydrogenation is not a focus of the literature review.

2. The article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. Propane dehydrogenation is not a focus of the literature review.

3. The article does not investigate catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion specifically for propane dehydrogenation. The review looks at catalyst preparation more broadly.

4. The article does not utilize any in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Propane dehydrogenation is not a focus of the literature review.

5. The article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Propane dehydrogenation is not a focus of the literature review. 

6. The article does not use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Propane dehydrogenation is not a focus of the literature review.

7. The article does not evaluate different reactor types like fixed beds, fluidized beds, or membrane reactors for propane dehydrogenation. Propane dehydrogenation is not a focus of the literature review.

8. The article does not provide specific insights into propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The focus is on comparing SOMC and SAC more broadly.
