 Unfortunately, the given literature does not discuss propane dehydrogenation specifically. The article is a broad review comparing single-atom catalysis (SAC), single-atom alloy catalysis (SAAC), and surface organometallic catalysis (SOMCat) for various catalytic reactions, but does not focus on propane dehydrogenation. Since the literature does not substantially cover the topic of the questions, I am unable to provide any relevant quotes or detailed answers.
