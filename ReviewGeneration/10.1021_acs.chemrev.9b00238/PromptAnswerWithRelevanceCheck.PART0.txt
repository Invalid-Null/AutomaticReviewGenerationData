<Answer>
 Unfortunately, the given literature does not provide any details related to propane dehydrogenation or propylene production. The literature is focused on comparing single atom catalysis (SAC), surface organometallic catalysis (SOMC), and single atom alloy catalysis (SAAC) methodologies for applications like hydrogenation, alkane metathesis, dehydrogenation, methane activation etc. It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation specifically. Therefore, I am unable to provide any relevant quotes or answers to the questions.

<Answer>
 Unfortunately, the given scientific literature does not contain information to directly answer the specific questions about propane dehydrogenation. The article is a broad review comparing single atom catalysts prepared by surface organometallic chemistry and single atom catalysis methodologies for various catalytic reactions. It does not focus in depth on propane dehydrogenation specifically.
