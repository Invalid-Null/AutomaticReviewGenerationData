 Here is the JSON structure comparing the consistency of the answer files with the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%"}
}
```

To summarize:
- answer0.txt is completely inconsistent (0% match) with the correct answers for all questions.  
- answer1.txt is completely consistent (100% match) with the correct answers for all questions.
- answer2.txt is completely inconsistent (0% match) with the correct answers for all questions.
- answer3.txt is completely consistent (100% match) with the correct answers for all questions.
