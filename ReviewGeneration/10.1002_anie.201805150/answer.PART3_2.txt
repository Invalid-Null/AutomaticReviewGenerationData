[1] "Pt clusters are narrowly distributed and most of them are similar to the dimension of α cage in LTA zeolites."

[2] "The HAADF-STEM image of spent Pt@NaA after 120h on-stream showed that the diameter of the majority of Pt clusters remained to be 1.1nm, while that of Pt particles supported on silica aggregated rapidly from 2.3nm to 6.1nm after only 25h on-stream." 

[3] "This result clearly showed the superior sintering resistance of encapsulated Pt clusters, consistent with previous observations."

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides examples of encapsulating Pt clusters in LTA zeolites, and shows data from HAADF-STEM imaging indicating that the encapsulated Pt clusters are stable against sintering during propane dehydrogenation, while Pt particles on silica rapidly aggregate. This demonstrates the superior sintering resistance provided by encapsulating metal clusters within zeolites.

[1] "Encapsulation of Pt clusters within NaA was achieved via hydrothermal synthesis using ligand-stabilized platinum precursors."

[2] "The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the mean Pt particle sizes were 1.1nm, 1.4nm, and 1.1nm for Pt@NaA, Pt@KA, and Pt@CaA, respectively."

[3] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the high crystallinity of shell zeolites, but no peaks could be assigned to Pt phases, suggesting their high dispersion."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes using ligand-stabilized platinum precursors and hydrothermal synthesis to encapsulate highly dispersed Pt clusters within zeolites. TEM and XRD data confirm the high dispersion of the Pt, with cluster sizes around 1 nm and no detectable Pt peaks in XRD.

5. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like HRTEM and HAADF-STEM to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides examples of imaging Pt cluster sizes within zeolite supports, and shows that the zeolite encapsulation preserves 1 nm Pt clusters while Pt on silica rapidly sinters to 6 nm particles. This reveals insights into the superior metal-support interaction provided by zeolites.
