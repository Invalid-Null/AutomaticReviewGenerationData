         [1] "Encapsulation of Pt clusters within NaA was achieved via hydrothermal synthesis using ligand-stabilized platinum precursors."
         [2] "The HAADF-STEM image of spent Pt@NaA after 120h on-stream showed that the diameter of the majority of Pt clusters remained to be 1.1nm, while that of Pt particles supported on silica aggregated rapidly from 2.3nm to 6.1nm after only 25h on-stream." 
         [3] "This result clearly showed the superior sintering resistance of encapsulated Pt clusters, consistent with previous observations."

         Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides examples of encapsulating Pt clusters within zeolites and shows HAADF-STEM data indicating the encapsulated clusters are resistant to sintering during reaction, unlike Pt on silica. This demonstrates the superior stability provided by encapsulation.

         [1] "Encapsulation of Pt clusters within NaA was achieved via hydrothermal synthesis using ligand-stabilized platinum precursors." 
         [2] "The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the mean Pt particle sizes were 1.1nm, 1.4nm, and 1.1nm for Pt@NaA, Pt@KA, and Pt@CaA, respectively."
         [3] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the high crystallinity of shell zeolites, but no peaks could be assigned to Pt phases, suggesting their high dispersion."

         Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods for optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses hydrothermal synthesis with ligand-stabilized precursors to encapsulate Pt clusters in zeolites. TEM and XRD data show the Pt clusters are highly dispersed with sizes around 1 nm.
