<quotes>
[1] "Encapsulation of Pt clusters within NaA was achieved via hydrothermal synthesis using ligand-stabilized platinum precursors."

[2] "The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the mean Pt particle sizes were 1.1nm, 1.4nm, and 1.1nm for Pt@NaA, Pt@KA, and Pt@CaA, respectively." 

[3] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure1c) revealed the high crystallinity of shell zeolites, but no peaks could be assigned to Pt phases, suggesting their high dispersion."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses hydrothermal synthesis with ligand-stabilized platinum precursors to encapsulate small Pt clusters within zeolites, as shown by TEM imaging and lack of detectable Pt phases by XRD.

[1] "The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the mean Pt particle sizes were 1.1nm, 1.4nm, and 1.1nm for Pt@NaA, Pt@KA, and Pt@CaA, respectively (Figure1b; Supporting Information, FigureS1)."

[2] "HAADF-STEM image of spent Pt@NaA after 120h on-stream showed that the diameter of the majority of Pt clusters remained to be 1.1nm, while that of Pt particles supported on silica aggregated rapidly from 2.3nm to 6.1nm after only 25h on-stream (Supporting Information, FigureS4)."
</quotes>

<English version answer> 
Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like TEM and HAADF-STEM to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows encapsulated Pt clusters in zeolites are stable, while Pt on silica sinters rapidly under reaction conditions.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,文章采用了TEM和HAADF-STEM等先进的显微技术来表征丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-载体界面。结果显示,封装在分子筛中的Pt簇稳定,而硅胶载体上的Pt在反应条件下迅速烧结。
