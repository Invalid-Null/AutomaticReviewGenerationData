 Based on the provided correct answers and text from the answer files, here is the comparative analysis of the consistency between each answer file and the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},
  "3": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"}, 
  "7": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I examined the quotes and answers provided in each file and compared them to the correct answers to determine consistency. For each question, I rated the answer as 100% consistent if it fully matched the correct answer, 0% if completely inconsistent, and approximate percentages in between based on degree of matching content. The JSON object summarizes the consistency ratio for each answer file per question.
