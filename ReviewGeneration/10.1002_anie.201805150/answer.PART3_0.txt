[1] Linde type A (LTA) zeolites with effective pore size similar or smaller than 0.43nm (0.43nm, 0.41nm, and 0.3nm for CaA, NaA, and KA, respectively) that are prospective sieves of H2 and O2 from hydrocarbons were selected as the shell matrix.

[3] The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the mean Pt particle sizes were 1.1nm, 1.4nm, and 1.1nm for Pt@NaA, Pt@KA, and Pt@CaA, respectively. Pt clusters are narrowly distributed and most of them are similar to the dimension of α cage in LTA zeolites.

[5] The HAADF-STEM image of spent Pt@NaA after 120h on-stream showed that the diameter of the majority of Pt clusters remained to be 1.1nm, while that of Pt particles supported on silica aggregated rapidly from 2.3nm to 6.1nm after only 25h on-stream.

<English version answer>

1. The article selects Linde type A zeolites with pore sizes of 0.43nm, 0.41nm, and 0.3nm for CaA, NaA, and KA, respectively, as shell matrices that can sieve H2 and O2 from hydrocarbons.

2. No, the article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports.

3. The article characterizes Pt particle sizes of 1.1-1.4nm encapsulated in LTA zeolites using TEM, with dimensions similar to the α-cage size. This suggests good dispersion of the active phase.

4. No, the article does not utilize any in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

5. The article uses HAADF-STEM to show encapsulated Pt clusters in spent Pt@NaA retained 1.1nm size after 120h, while Pt on silica aggregated from 2.3 to 6.1nm after 25h. This demonstrates improved stability from zeolite encapsulation.

6. No, the article does not use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis.

7. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.

8. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.

1. 文章选择了孔径分别为0.43nm、0.41nm和0.3nm的CaA、NaA和KA型林德A型分子筛作为壳体矩阵,可以将H2和O2从碳氢化合物中筛选出来。

2. 文中没有描述用于在硅铝酸盐支持中合成隔离的单点位的技术。

3. 文章使用TEM表征了封装在LTA分子筛中的Pt颗粒大小为1.1-1.4nm,与α笼大小相似。这表明活性相分散良好。

4. 文中没有利用任何原位表征技术来研究工作中的丙烷脱氢催化剂。

5. 文章使用HAADF-STEM显示,在流化120小时后,封装在NaA中的Pt簇保持1.1nm大小,而负载在二氧化硅上的Pt从2.3nm聚集到了6.1nm。这证明了分子筛封装改善了稳定性。

6. 文中没有使用X射线技术来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。

7. 文中没有评估不同的反应器类型用于丙烷脱氢反应。 

8. 文中没有评估不同的反应器类型用于丙烷脱氢反应。
