[1] "In this contribution, we show that by promoting amorphous silica with low amounts of sodium, the surface density of two-dimensional metal oxide species can be significantly enhanced to the same level as all other oxide supports previously reported in the literature."

[1] "In this contribution, we show that by promoting amorphous silica with low amounts of sodium, the surface density of two-dimensional (2D) metal oxide species can be significantly enhanced to the same level as all other oxide supports previously reported in the literature."

[2] "It appears that sodium ions have the optimal properties to facilitate this unique dispersion enhancement."

[3] "This effect is demonstrated for the case of supported vanadia using a variety of spectroscopic techniques (i.e., Raman, diffuse reflectance UVvis, and 51V-MAS NMR), as well as a catalytic activity study for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), a structure-sensitive probe reaction."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It shows that adding small amounts of sodium to amorphous silica enhances the dispersion of vanadia and other metal oxides, allowing higher loadings of 2D metal oxide species compared to untreated silica. This is demonstrated through Raman, UV-vis, NMR spectroscopy, and by using propane ODH activity as a probe reaction.
