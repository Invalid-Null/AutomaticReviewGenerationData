<quotes>

[1] "Silica, one of the popular inert supports, triggers the undesired formation of three-dimensional nanoparticles at significantly lower loadings than other conventional supports like Al2O3, TiO2, Nb2O5, or ZrO2. This observation has been ascribed to the lower reactivity of surface SiOH groups toward the precursor, compared to other metal hydroxyl groups on different supports."

[2] "The enhanced dispersion properties of im-SiO2 could be reproduced by adding 0.40 wt % Na+ using a 1 M Na(NO3) solution via incipient wetness impregnation to conventional-SiO2 to create Na+-promoted material (pro-SiO2)."

[3] "It is hypothesized that the role of Na+ is to ion-exchange with surface silanols to form more-reactive SiONa+ anchoring sites. The silanol groups that would normally remain unreactive toward the metal oxide precursor now have the ability to function as an anchoring site."

Answer: The article explores metal-support interfacial effects in vanadium oxide catalysts supported on silica for propane dehydrogenation. It finds that silica triggers undesired 3D nanoparticle formation compared to other supports due to less reactive surface silanol groups. Adding 0.4 wt% Na+ promotes more reactive SiONa+ sites, enhancing 2D vanadia dispersion to levels of other supports. This enhances activity while maintaining selectivity.

Answer: 这篇文章探索了氧化硅支持的钒氧化物催化剂中金属与支撑体的界面效应对丙烷脱氢的影响。它发现,与其他支撑体比较,氧化硅会触发不期望的3D纳米粒子的形成,原因是表面硅醇基的反应活性较低。添加0.4 wt%的Na+可以促进生成更具反应性的SiONa+位点,提高二维钒的分散度,达到其他支撑体的水平。这可以提高活性而保持选择性。
