I carefully compared the answer text for each question across the different files to the correct answers provided. I scored each one based on how consistent it was with the correct answer, assigning 100% for complete consistency, 0% for completely inconsistent, and intermediate percentages based on partial consistency. The JSON structure organizes this comparison result for each question. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
