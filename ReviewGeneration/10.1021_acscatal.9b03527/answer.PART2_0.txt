<quotes>

[1] "Herein, a novel strategy for the synthesis of highly stable Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is developed, which is realized by the stabilization of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn sites in a zeolite framework."

[2] "The achieved Pt-Sn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity and did not suffer from coke formation and sintering processes."  

[3] "A propylene selectivity of above 99% with a conversion close to the equilibrium was attained at 550 C, and no visible sintering of Pt clusters was observed in the long-term DHP reaction in the Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O catalyst."

[4] "A propylene selectivity of above 99%, initial propane conversion of 50%, low deactivation rate of 0.006 h1, high TOF of 114 s1, and good regenerability have been achieved in the Pt-Sn2.00/Sn-Beta catalyst for propane dehydrogenation at 570 C, and these performances are higher than those achieved in the state-of-the-art catalysts reported in the reference."
