[1] The achieved Pt-Sn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity and did not suffer from coke formation and sintering processes. 

[2] The Pt particles are homogeneously distributed in small raft-like clusters on Mg(Sn)(Al)O due to its interaction with the SnIV/II sites located in Mg(Al)O lattices. A propylene selectivity of above 99% with a conversion close to the equilibrium was attained at 550 C, and no visible sintering of Pt clusters was observed in the long-term DHP reaction in the Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O catalyst.

[3] Monitoring the local structure of the reduced catalyst (Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2) with an in situ X-ray absorption technique reveals that the GaxPt (0.5 < x < 0.9) bimetallic particles are anchored at the isolated gallium sites.

[4] A propylene selectivity of above 99% with an initial propane conversion of 50%, low deactivation rate of 0.006 h1, high TOF of 114 s1, and good regenerability have been achieved in the Pt-Sn2.00/Sn-Beta catalyst for propane dehydrogenation at 570 C.

[1] Propylene, as one of the most important basic chemicals, is used as the feedstock for the production of a great deal of chemicals. (1) The steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the traditional ways for the production of propylene. (2) However, the propylene productivity in these two ways still cannot produce sufficient propylene to satisfy the increasing market demand. Recently, the propane dehydrogenation to propylene becomes one of the most promising and attractive techniques for the production of propylene because the success in the large-scale exploitation of shale gas can supply an abundance of cheap propane for this process.
