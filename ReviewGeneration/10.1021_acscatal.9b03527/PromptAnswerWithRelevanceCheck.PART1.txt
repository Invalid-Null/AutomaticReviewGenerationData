[1] "The dispersion and stability of a Pt particle at surface of support are the key factors, which essentially affect the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst. (6,7) The high dispersion of the Pt particle enables most Pt atoms to be accessible for the catalytic reaction. The good stability of the Pt particle prevents the sintering of Pt particles under the harsh reaction condition, which significantly increases the catalyst lifetime." 

[2] "In light of the N2 adsorption result, it can be inferred that all the samples exhibit a similar N2 adsorption behavior to that of parent Al-Beta and the highly distributed Sn and Pt species in the zeolite structure has no influence on its pore architecture."

[3] "Further CO titration measurement (Table S3) shows that the dispersion of the PtSn bimetallic particle is in dependent on the ratio of Sn/Pt and a high Sn/Pt ratio leads to a slight increase in their dispersion. The dispersion of the PtSn bimetallic particle in the samples with a high Sn/Pt ratio is around 50%, suggesting that almost all of the Pt atoms are located at the surface and become accessible to the reactant."

[1] "Herein, a novel strategy for the synthesis of highly stable Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is developed, which is realized by the stabilization of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn sites in a zeolite framework."

[2] "Characterizations with XRD, STEM, XPS, CO-IR, H2-TPR, and Py-IR techniques confirm that the Pt clusters are firmly anchored on the single Sn atom incorporated zeolitic framework, which leads to high dispersion and good stability of Pt clusters at the surface of Sn-zeolite."

[1] "Recently, the propane dehydrogenation to propylene becomes one of the most promising and attractive techniques for the production of propylene because the success in the large-scale exploitation of shale gas can supply an abundance of cheap propane for this process. In fact, this process has been commercialized by the UOP company, which is operated with the moving bed reactor based on an alumina-supported Pt catalyst."

[2] "Herein, a novel strategy for the synthesis of highly stable Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is developed, which is realized by the stabilization of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn sites in a zeolite framework 

[3] "Rational design of the precise control of the structure of the support is a useful way to obtain a strong interaction between Pt and the support, and various types of materials have been used as the support to disperse the Pt particle."

[4] "The dispersion and stability of a Pt particle are the key factors, which essentially affect the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst."

[5] "The high performance of Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts under a high reaction temperature is mainly due to a strong interaction between the Pt cluster and Sn-zeolite."

[6] "An initial propane conversion of 50%, high propylene selectivity of above 99%, low deactivation rate of 0.006 h1, high TOF of 114 s1, and good regenerability have been achieved in the Pt-Sn2.00/Sn-Beta catalyst for propane dehydrogenation at 570 C."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

1. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn catalysts supported on zeolite Beta for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on initial propane conversion (50%), propylene selectivity (>99%), deactivation rate (0.006 h-1), turnover frequency (114 s-1) and regenerability. The insights are that stabilizing Pt clusters on isolated Sn sites in the zeolite framework leads to strong metal-support interactions and high performance.  

2. No, the article does not investigate tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides for propane dehydrogenation.

3. Yes, the article proposes that the Pt clusters anchored on Sn sites lead to isolated Pt active sites, which are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. No specific reaction intermediates are described.

4. Yes, the article explores metal-support effects by stabilizing Pt clusters on isolated Sn sites to achieve strong metal-support interactions. This leads to high dispersion of Pt and inhibition of sintering under reaction conditions, which modulates the activity and selectivity.

5. No, the article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts besides Pt-Sn.

6. Yes, the article shows stabilizing Pt clusters on Sn sites leads to small, highly dispersed Pt particles that are resistant to sintering. This structure-function relationship improves catalytic performance.

7. No, the article does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the supported Pt-Sn catalysts beyond the role of isolated Pt sites.
