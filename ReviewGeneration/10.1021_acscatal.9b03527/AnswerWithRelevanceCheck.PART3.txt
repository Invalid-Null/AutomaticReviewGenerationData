      Herein, a novel strategy for the synthesis of highly stable Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is developed, which is realized by the stabilization of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn sites in the zeolite framework. This strategy consists of three basic steps: (i) removal of framework Al atoms from the zeolite crystalline structure to create the lattice defects, (ii) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite, and (iii) soft landing of the Pt particle at the surface of Sn-zeolite to achieve Pt/Sn-zeolite catalysts.

      The grafting synthesis was monitored by an in situ FTIR technique (Figure 1). In fact, the grafting of a HSnBu3 or Pt(COD)Me2 organometallic compound onto oxides is the well-established reaction. The grafting reaction takes place upon the protonolysis of a methyl group in Pt(COD)Me2 or the hydride group in HSnBu3, which leads to the formation of a SnBu3/oxide or Pt(COD)Me/oxide compound. Thus, it can be inferred that the sequential grafting of HSnBu3 and Pt(COD)Me2 organometallic complexes on to the dealuminated Beta zeolite gives rise to a Pt(COD)Me/SnBu3/Beta surface compound.
