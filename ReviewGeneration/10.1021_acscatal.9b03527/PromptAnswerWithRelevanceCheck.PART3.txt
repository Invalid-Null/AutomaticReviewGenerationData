2. Rational design of the precise control of the structure of the support is a useful way to obtain a strong interaction between Pt and the support, and various types of materials have been used as the support to disperse the Pt particle.

3. The dispersion and stability of the Pt particle is closely related to the interaction between the Pt particle and support. In fact, the strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) leads to two evident consequences on the properties of catalyst: first, it can remarkably facilitate the dispersion of Pt species on the support, which results in ultra-small Pt clusters uniformly distributed at the surface of the support; second, it can essentially decrease the mobility of the Pt particle under the harsh reaction condition, which notably hinders the Pt agglomeration in the catalytic reaction.

4. Much effort has been dedicated to developing new strategies for enhancing the metalsupport interaction so as to achieve a highly dispersed and sinter-resistant Pt catalyst for a propane dehydrogenation reaction.

1. Herein, a novel strategy for the synthesis of highly stable Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is developed, which is realized by the stabilization of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn sites in the zeolite framework. This strategy consists of three basic steps: (i) removal of framework Al atoms from the zeolite crystalline structure to create the lattice defects, (ii) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite, and (iii) soft landing of the Pt particle at the surface of Sn-zeolite to achieve Pt/Sn-zeolite catalysts.

2. The grafting synthesis was monitored by an in situ FTIR technique (Figure 1). In fact, the grafting of a HSnBu3 or Pt(COD)Me2 organometallic compound onto oxides is the well-established reaction. The grafting reaction takes place upon the protonolysis of a methyl group in Pt(COD)Me2 or the hydride group in HSnBu3, which leads to the formation of a SnBu3/oxide or Pt(COD)Me/oxide compound. Thus, it can be inferred that the sequential grafting of HSnBu3 and Pt(COD)Me2 organometallic complexes on to the dealuminated Beta zeolite gives rise to a Pt(COD)Me/SnBu3/Beta surface compound. 

3. In Structure A, Sn atoms are totally incorporated into the structure of Beta zeolite, and each Sn atom is chemically bonded into the zeolite framework through four SiOSn linkages; therefore, such Sn atoms in the zeolite framework exist as Sn(IV). In Structure B, the Sn atoms stay at the interface between Beta zeolite and Pt particles, and each Sn atom is partially incorporated into the zeolite framework through two SiOSn linkages; thus, these Sn atoms exist as Sn(II). These unsaturated Sn(II) species enable to anchor the Pt particles, which serve as the linking sites to localize the Pt particles.
