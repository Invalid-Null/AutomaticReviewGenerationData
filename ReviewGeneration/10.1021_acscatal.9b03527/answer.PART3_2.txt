<English version answer>
1. Answer: The article describes several techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It discusses dealumination of zeolites like Beta and Y zeolites using nitric acid to remove framework aluminum and create vacancies. It then describes grafting tin complexes like tributyltin hydride onto the dealuminated zeolites to incorporate isolated tin atoms into the vacancies. This results in zeolites with isolated tin sites.

2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports to enhance propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It describes stabilizing platinum clusters on isolated tin sites in the zeolite framework. This localization of platinum on tin sites results in high dispersion and excellent stability of the platinum clusters on the zeolite surface. The platinum-tin catalysts anchored on tin sites in zeolites like Sn-Beta and Sn-Y show much higher stability than platinum-tin catalysts physically loaded on Al-Beta without isolated tin sites.

2. 答案:是的,该文评估了沸石支撑体中的金属封装,以增强丙烷脱氢催化剂的稳定性。它描述了在沸石框架中的隔离锡位点上稳定铂簇。铂在锡位点上的这种定位导致铂簇在沸石表面上的高分散和优异的稳定性。锚定在诸如Sn-Beta和Sn-Y等沸石中的锡位点上的铂锡催化剂的稳定性明显高于物理加载在没有隔离锡位点的Al-Beta上的铂锡催化剂。

3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes using a grafting approach to load platinum and tin precursors onto dealuminated zeolites. This results in small, highly dispersed platinum-tin particles on the zeolite surface. STEM imaging shows the platinum-tin particles are only 1-1.4 nm in size. The article also varies the Sn/Pt ratio and shows higher ratios lead to increased metal dispersion.
