 Here is the structured comparison of the answer files with the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%"},
  "5": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"}
}
```

To generate this, I first extracted the question number, English answer, and Chinese answer from each answer file. 

I then compared the English and Chinese answers in each file to the corresponding correct English and Chinese answers from the provided Answer.txt file. 

For each question, I calculated the consistency ratio by determining if the answers matched the correct answers. Matches were scored 100% and mismatches 0%.

The consistency ratios were then structured into the JSON format with the question numbers as keys and the answer file names and ratios as values.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
