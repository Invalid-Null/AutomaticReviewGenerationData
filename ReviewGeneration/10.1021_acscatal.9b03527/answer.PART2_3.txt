<quotes>

[1] "Herein, a novel strategy for the synthesis of highly stable Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is developed, which is realized by the stabilization of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn sites in a zeolite framework."

[2] "A propylene selectivity of above 99%, initial propane conversion of 50%, low deactivation rate of 0.006 h1, high TOF of 114 s1, and good regenerability have been achieved in the Pt-Sn2.00/Sn-Beta catalyst for propane dehydrogenation at 570 C, and these performances are higher than those achieved in the state-of-the-art catalysts reported in the reference."

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It reports that the Pt-Sn2.00/Sn-Beta catalyst achieved above 99% propylene selectivity, 50% initial propane conversion, low deactivation rate of 0.006 h-1, and high TOF of 114 s-1 at 570°C. These results were better than state-of-the-art catalysts.
