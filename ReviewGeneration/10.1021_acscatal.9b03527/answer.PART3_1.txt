[1] "Rational design of the precise control of the structure of the support is a useful way to obtain a strong interaction between Pt and the support, and various types of materials have been used as the support to disperse the Pt particle."

[2] "The HAADF-STEM characterization was further carried out on this sample to know the nature of PtSn bimetallic particles. As shown in Figure 4, it is found that ultra-small particles ranging from 1.0 to 1.4 nm with an average diameter of 1.26 nm are uniformly dispersed."

[3] "Further CO titration measurement (Table S3) shows that the dispersion of the PtSn bimetallic particle is in dependent on the ratio of Sn/Pt and a high Sn/Pt ratio leads to a slight increase in their dispersion."

2. Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses rational design of the support structure to obtain strong metal-support interaction and high dispersion of Pt particles. It uses HAADF-STEM characterization to show ultra-small and uniformly dispersed PtSn particles of 1-1.4 nm size. CO titration data also shows high dispersion that increases slightly with higher Sn content.

[1] "The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurement on Sn 3d band energy was recorded on the Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts with different Sn/Pt ratios in order to know the chemical state of Sn (Figure 6)." 

[2] "The XPS measurement on Sn 3d band energy was recorded on the Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts with different Sn/Pt ratios in order to know the chemical state of Sn (Figure 6)."

[3] "Based on the XPS study result, it can be known that there are metallic Sn, Sn(II), and Sn(IV) species in these Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts."

[1] "The dispersion and stability of the Pt particle is closely related to the interaction between the Pt particle and support."

[2] "The anchoring of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn site in the zeolite framework can be confirmed from FTIR analysis of the pyridine adsorption."

[3] "Characterizations with XRD, STEM, XPS, CO-IR, H2-TPR, and Py-IR techniques confirm that the Pt clusters are firmly anchored on the single Sn atom incorporated zeolitic framework, which leads to high dispersion and good stability of Pt clusters at the surface of Sn-zeolite."

<English version answer>
7. Answer: The article utilizes FTIR pyridine adsorption, XRD, STEM, XPS, CO-IR, and H2-TPR to characterize the anchoring and dispersion of Pt clusters on isolated Sn sites in the zeolite framework. These techniques provide insights into the metal-support interface and how anchoring Pt on Sn sites enhances dispersion and stability.
