         [1] "Recently, the propane dehydrogenation to propylene becomes one of the most promising and attractive techniques for the production of propylene because the success in the large-scale exploitation of shale gas can supply an abundance of cheap propane for this process. In fact, this process has been commercialized by the UOP company, which is operated with the moving bed reactor based on an alumina-supported Pt catalyst."

         [2] "Herein, a novel strategy for the synthesis of highly stable Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is developed, which is realized by the stabilization of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn sites in a zeolite framework"

         [3] "An initial propane conversion of 50%, high propylene selectivity of above 99%, low deactivation rate of 0.006 h1, high TOF of 114 s1, and good regenerability have been achieved in the Pt-Sn2.00/Sn-Beta catalyst for propane dehydrogenation at 570 C."

         Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn catalysts supported on zeolite Beta for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on initial propane conversion (50%), propylene selectivity (>99%), deactivation rate (0.006 h-1), turnover frequency (114 s-1) and regenerability. The insights are that stabilizing Pt clusters on isolated Sn sites in the zeolite framework leads to strong metal-support interactions and high performance.

      <English>
         Yes, the article proposes that the Pt clusters anchored on Sn sites lead to isolated Pt active sites, which are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. No specific reaction intermediates are described.

      <English>
         Yes, the article explores metal-support effects by stabilizing Pt clusters on isolated Sn sites to achieve strong metal-support interactions. This leads to high dispersion of Pt and inhibition of sintering under reaction conditions, which modulates the activity and selectivity.

         [1] "The dispersion and stability of a Pt particle are the key factors, which essentially affect the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst."
         
         [2] "Characterizations with XRD, STEM, XPS, CO-IR, H2-TPR, and Py-IR techniques confirm that the Pt clusters are firmly anchored on the single Sn atom incorporated zeolitic framework, which leads to high dispersion and good stability of Pt clusters at the surface of Sn-zeolite."
