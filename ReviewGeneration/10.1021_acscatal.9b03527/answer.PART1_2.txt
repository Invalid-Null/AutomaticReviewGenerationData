[1] "The dispersion and stability of a Pt particle at surface of support are the key factors, which essentially affect the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst. (6,7) The high dispersion of the Pt particle enables most Pt atoms to be accessible for the catalytic reaction. The good stability of the Pt particle prevents the sintering of Pt particles under the harsh reaction condition, which significantly increases the catalyst lifetime." 

[2] "In light of the N2 adsorption result, it can be inferred that all the samples exhibit a similar N2 adsorption behavior to that of parent Al-Beta and the highly distributed Sn and Pt species in the zeolite structure has no influence on its pore architecture."

[3] "Further CO titration measurement (Table S3) shows that the dispersion of the PtSn bimetallic particle is in dependent on the ratio of Sn/Pt and a high Sn/Pt ratio leads to a slight increase in their dispersion. The dispersion of the PtSn bimetallic particle in the samples with a high Sn/Pt ratio is around 50%, suggesting that almost all of the Pt atoms are located at the surface and become accessible to the reactant."

1. The article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation.

2. The article does not investigate how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance.

3. The article does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts. 

4. The article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

5. The article evaluates supported Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on how dispersion and stability of Pt particles affects catalytic performance. Higher dispersion enables more Pt atoms to be accessible for reaction. Preventing sintering under harsh conditions increases catalyst lifetime.  

6. The article shows high Sn/Pt ratio leads to slight increase in dispersion of PtSn particles. Around 50% dispersion achieved at high Sn/Pt ratio, suggesting most Pt atoms are accessible to reactants.

7. The article does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the studied Pt catalysts.

1. 这篇文章没有评估任何有前景的金属氧化物催化剂,如Cr2O3、Pt-Sn、Ga2O3,用于丙烷脱氢。

2. 这篇文章没有研究调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧迁移性和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。

3. 这篇文章没有为金属氧化物催化剂提出丙烷脱氢的机理场景。

4. 这篇文章没有探索金属氧化物催化剂中金属载体界面效应。

5. 这篇文章评估了负载Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供了Pt颗粒分散度和稳定性如何影响催化性能的数据。更高的分散度使更多的Pt原子可用于反应。防止严酷条件下的烧结增加催化剂的使用寿命。

6. 这篇文章显示高Sn/Pt比率导致PtSn颗粒分散度略有增加。在高Sn/Pt比率下达到约50%的分散度,意味着大多数Pt原子可为反应物所及。

7. 这篇文章没有为所研究的Pt催化剂提出丙烷脱氢的机理反应途径。
