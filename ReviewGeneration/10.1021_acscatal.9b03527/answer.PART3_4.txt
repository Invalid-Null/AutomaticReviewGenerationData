1. Herein, a novel strategy for the synthesis of highly stable Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is developed, which is realized by the stabilization of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn sites in the zeolite framework. This strategy consists of three basic steps: (i) removal of framework Al atoms from the zeolite crystalline structure to create the lattice defects, (ii) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite, and (iii) soft landing of the Pt particle at the surface of Sn-zeolite to achieve Pt/Sn-zeolite catalysts.

2. The grafting synthesis was monitored by an in situ FTIR technique (Figure 1). In fact, the grafting of a HSnBu3 or Pt(COD)Me2 organometallic compound onto oxides is the well-established reaction. The grafting reaction takes place upon the protonolysis of a methyl group in Pt(COD)Me2 or the hydride group in HSnBu3, which leads to the formation of a SnBu3/oxide or Pt(COD)Me/oxide compound. Thus, it can be inferred that the sequential grafting of HSnBu3 and Pt(COD)Me2 organometallic complexes on to the dealuminated Beta zeolite gives rise to a Pt(COD)Me/SnBu3/Beta surface compound. 

3. In Structure A, Sn atoms are totally incorporated into the structure of Beta zeolite, and each Sn atom is chemically bonded into the zeolite framework through four SiOSn linkages; therefore, such Sn atoms in the zeolite framework exist as Sn(IV). In Structure B, the Sn atoms stay at the interface between Beta zeolite and Pt particles, and each Sn atom is partially incorporated into the zeolite framework through two SiOSn linkages; thus, these Sn atoms exist as Sn(II). These unsaturated Sn(II) species enable to anchor the Pt particles, which serve as the linking sites to localize the Pt particles.

5. The HR-TEM image of Pt/Sn-Beta clearly shows that these PtSn particles are not located in the micropore of Beta zeolite. The HAADF-STEM characterization was further carried out on this sample to know the nature of PtSn bimetallic particles. 

6. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of dehydrated samples were recorded on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer with a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) and pass energy of 160 eV and a multichannel plate and delay line detector (DLD) under a vacuum of 107 mbar.
