<quotes>
[1] "Herein, a novel strategy for the synthesis of highly stable Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is developed, which is realized by the stabilization of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn sites in a zeolite framework."

[2] "Characterizations with XRD, STEM, XPS, CO-IR, H2-TPR, and Py-IR techniques confirm that the Pt clusters are firmly anchored on the single Sn atom incorporated zeolitic framework, which leads to high dispersion and good stability of Pt clusters at the surface of Sn-zeolite."  

[3] "A propylene selectivity of above 99%, initial propane conversion of 50%, low deactivation rate of 0.006 h1, high TOF of 114 s1, and good regenerability have been achieved in the Pt-Sn2.00/Sn-Beta catalyst for propane dehydrogenation at 570 C, and these performances are higher than those achieved in the state-of-the-art catalysts reported in the reference."

5. Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It develops Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts where Pt clusters are anchored on isolated Sn sites in the zeolite Beta framework. Characterizations confirm high dispersion and stability of the Pt clusters due to strong interaction with Sn sites. The Pt-Sn2.00/Sn-Beta catalyst achieved >99% propylene selectivity, 50% propane conversion, low deactivation rate of 0.006 h-1, and 114 s-1 TOF at 570°C, outperforming state-of-the-art catalysts.

[1] "The dispersion and stability of a Pt particle at surface of support are the key factors, which essentially affect the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst."

[2] "Characterizations with XRD, STEM, XPS, CO-IR, H2-TPR, and Py-IR techniques confirm that the Pt clusters are firmly anchored on the single Sn atom incorporated zeolitic framework, which leads to high dispersion and good stability of Pt clusters at the surface of Sn-zeolite."

[3] "On the basis of a comparative study above, it is definitely confirmed that anchoring of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn site in the zeolite framework is an effective strategy for the fabrication of an efficient PtSn catalyst."
