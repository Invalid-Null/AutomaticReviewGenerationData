<quotes>

[1] The achieved Pt-Sn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity and did not suffer from coke formation and sintering processes. 

[2] The Pt particles are homogeneously distributed in small raft-like clusters on Mg(Sn)(Al)O due to its interaction with the SnIV/II sites located in Mg(Al)O lattices. A propylene selectivity of above 99% with a conversion close to the equilibrium was attained at 550 C, and no visible sintering of Pt clusters was observed in the long-term DHP reaction in the Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O catalyst.

[3] Monitoring the local structure of the reduced catalyst (Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2) with an in situ X-ray absorption technique reveals that the GaxPt (0.5 < x < 0.9) bimetallic particles are anchored at the isolated gallium sites.

[4] A propylene selectivity of above 99% with an initial propane conversion of 50%, low deactivation rate of 0.006 h1, high TOF of 114 s1, and good regenerability have been achieved in the Pt-Sn2.00/Sn-Beta catalyst for propane dehydrogenation at 570 C.

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn, Pt-Ga, and Pt-Mg-Sn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing high propylene selectivity (>99%) and stability for Pt-Sn/Al2O3, Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O, and Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 catalysts. The Pt-Sn2.00/Sn-Beta catalyst also achieved 99% propylene selectivity along with high activity and stability.
