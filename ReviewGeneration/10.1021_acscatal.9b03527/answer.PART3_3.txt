1. Herein, a novel strategy for the synthesis of highly stable Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is developed, which is realized by the stabilization of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn sites in the zeolite framework. 

2. Rational design of the precise control of the structure of the support is a useful way to obtain a strong interaction between Pt and the support, and various types of materials have been used as the support to disperse the Pt particle.

3. The dispersion and stability of the Pt particle is closely related to the interaction between the Pt particle and support. In fact, the strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) leads to two evident consequences on the properties of catalyst: first, it can remarkably facilitate the dispersion of Pt species on the support, which results in ultra-small Pt clusters uniformly distributed at the surface of the support; second, it can essentially decrease the mobility of the Pt particle under the harsh reaction condition, which notably hinders the Pt agglomeration in the catalytic reaction.

4. Much effort has been dedicated to developing new strategies for enhancing the metalsupport interaction so as to achieve a highly dispersed and sinter-resistant Pt catalyst for a propane dehydrogenation reaction.

5. Rational design of the precise control of the structure of the support is a useful way to obtain a strong interaction between Pt and the support, and various types of materials have been used as the support to disperse the Pt particle.

7. The HAADF-STEM characterization was further carried out on this sample to know the nature of PtSn bimetallic particles. As shown in Figure 4, it is found that ultra-small particles ranging from 1.0 to 1.4 nm with an average diameter of 1.26 nm are uniformly dispersed.
