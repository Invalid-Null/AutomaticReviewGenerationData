1. Herein, highly efficient Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts are developed for propane dehydrogenation, which exhibits high activity, selectivity, and stability in this reaction.

2. Rational design of the precise control of the structure of the support is a useful way to obtain a strong interaction between Pt and the support, and various types of materials have been used as the support to disperse the Pt particle.

3. A grafting approach based on surface organometallic chemistry concept is applied for the synthesis of the Pt/Sn-Beta catalyst, through which the Sn and Pt species can be loaded into the zeolite structure in a controllable manner. 

4. The grafting synthesis was monitored by an in situ FTIR technique.

5. The grafting of a HSnBu3 or Pt(COD)Me2 organometallic compound onto oxides is the well-established reaction. The grafting reaction takes place upon the protonolysis of a methyl group in Pt(COD)Me2 or the hydride group in HSnBu3, which leads to the formation of a SnBu3/oxide or Pt(COD)Me/oxide compound.

6. Thus, it can be inferred that the sequential grafting of HSnBu3 and Pt(COD)Me2 organometallic complexes on to the dealuminated Beta zeolite gives rise to a Pt(COD)Me/SnBu3/Beta surface compound.

1. Answer: The article describes a grafting approach based on surface organometallic chemistry to synthesize isolated single Sn sites in dealuminated zeolite Beta. The Sn precursor HSnBu3 is grafted onto the dealuminated zeolite, leading to incorporation of isolated Sn atoms into the zeolite framework vacancies. 

2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates stabilizing Pt clusters on single Sn sites in the zeolite framework to enhance stability for propane dehydrogenation. Increasing the Sn/Pt ratio leads to stronger interaction between PtSn particles and the zeolite, greatly improving catalyst lifetime.

3. Answer: Yes, the grafting approach aims to achieve high dispersion of Pt on Sn sites. The article also discusses strong metalsupport interaction and rational design of supports like Sn-modified zeolites to optimize dispersion.

4. Answer: No in-situ characterization techniques are discussed.

5. Answer: Yes, the article uses HR-TEM and STEM imaging to characterize PtSn metal-support interfaces. The images reveal small 1-1.4 nm PtSn clusters firmly anchored on isolated Sn sites in the zeolite Beta framework.

6. Answer: No X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation states are mentioned.

7. Answer: No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types. Only a fixed bed reactor is used.

8. Answer: No, the article does not mention membrane reactors.
