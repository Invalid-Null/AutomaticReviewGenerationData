[1] Propylene, as one of the most important basic chemicals, is used as the feedstock for the production of a great deal of chemicals. (1) The steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the traditional ways for the production of propylene. (2) However, the propylene productivity in these two ways still cannot produce sufficient propylene to satisfy the increasing market demand. Recently, the propane dehydrogenation to propylene becomes one of the most promising and attractive techniques for the production of propylene because the success in the large-scale exploitation of shale gas can supply an abundance of cheap propane for this process.

[1] The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the parent Al-Beta, Si-Beta, Sn-Beta, and Pt/Sn-Beta are shown in Figure 2. 

[2] The parent Al-Beta sample exhibits diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 8.00, 8.84, 21.76, and 22.46, which are attributed to the characteristic reflection peaks of the BEA topology.
