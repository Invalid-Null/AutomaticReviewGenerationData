[1] "Recently, the propane dehydrogenation to propylene becomes one of the most promising and attractive techniques for the production of propylene because the success in the large-scale exploitation of shale gas can supply an abundance of cheap propane for this process. In fact, this process has been commercialized by the UOP company, which is operated with the moving bed reactor based on an alumina-supported Pt catalyst."

[2] "Herein, a novel strategy for the synthesis of highly stable Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is developed, which is realized by the stabilization of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn sites in a zeolite framework 

[3] "Rational design of the precise control of the structure of the support is a useful way to obtain a strong interaction between Pt and the support, and various types of materials have been used as the support to disperse the Pt particle."

[4] "The dispersion and stability of a Pt particle are the key factors, which essentially affect the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst."

[5] "The high performance of Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts under a high reaction temperature is mainly due to a strong interaction between the Pt cluster and Sn-zeolite."

[6] "An initial propane conversion of 50%, high propylene selectivity of above 99%, low deactivation rate of 0.006 h1, high TOF of 114 s1, and good regenerability have been achieved in the Pt-Sn2.00/Sn-Beta catalyst for propane dehydrogenation at 570 C."

<English version answer>

1. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn catalysts supported on zeolite Beta for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on initial propane conversion (50%), propylene selectivity (>99%), deactivation rate (0.006 h-1), turnover frequency (114 s-1) and regenerability. The insights are that stabilizing Pt clusters on isolated Sn sites in the zeolite framework leads to strong metal-support interactions and high performance.  

2. No, the article does not investigate tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides for propane dehydrogenation.

3. Yes, the article proposes that the Pt clusters anchored on Sn sites lead to isolated Pt active sites, which are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. No specific reaction intermediates are described.

4. Yes, the article explores metal-support effects by stabilizing Pt clusters on isolated Sn sites to achieve strong metal-support interactions. This leads to high dispersion of Pt and inhibition of sintering under reaction conditions, which modulates the activity and selectivity.

5. No, the article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts besides Pt-Sn.

6. Yes, the article shows stabilizing Pt clusters on Sn sites leads to small, highly dispersed Pt particles that are resistant to sintering. This structure-function relationship improves catalytic performance.

7. No, the article does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the supported Pt-Sn catalysts beyond the role of isolated Pt sites.

1. 是的,该文评估了负载在沸石Beta上的Pt-Sn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供了初期丙烷转化率(50%)、丙烯选择性(>99%)、失活率(0.006 h-1)、周转频率(114 s-1)和再生性的数据。论点是,稳定Pt簇在沸石框架中的隔离Sn位点上可实现强的金属-载体相互作用和高性能。

2. 否,该文没有研究调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧迁移性和酸碱性以用于丙烷脱氢。

3. 是的,该文提出Pt簇锚定在Sn位点上导致隔离的Pt活性位点,这些是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。没有描述具体的反应中间体。

4. 是的,该文通过稳定Pt簇在隔离的Sn位点上实现强的金属-载体相互作用来探究金属-载体效应。这导致Pt高度分散和抑制烧结,调节了活性和选择性。

5. 否,该文没有评估Pt-Sn之外的任何受支撑的单金属催化剂。 

6. 是的,该文表明稳定Pt簇在Sn位点上导致小的、高度分散的Pt颗粒,抵抗烧结。这一结构-功能关系改善了催化性能。

7. 否,该文没有对受支撑的Pt-Sn催化剂提出丙烷脱氢的机理途径,仅提及了隔离Pt位点的作用。
