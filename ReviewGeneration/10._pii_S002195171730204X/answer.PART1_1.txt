<quotes>

[1] "The diminished size introduces mesopores among crystals, as certified by N2 sorption results." 

[2] "The external surface area of as-prepared TS-1 zeolite increases with the reduction of crystal size, because a secondary mesopore system is gradually formed among the small crystal particles."

[3] "Supports with suitable physical morphology (small crystal size accompanied by hierarchical pore) and chemical properties (acidity) are of fundamental importance for the PDH reaction."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

13. Yes, the article investigates how properties like particle size and hierarchical pore structure affect the performance of the PtSn/TS-1 catalysts. It finds that smaller crystal size introduces mesopores between the crystals, increasing external surface area. This hierarchical pore structure improves mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites, leading to better catalytic performance, especially for the 100 nm TS-1 supported PtSn catalyst. Acidity of the support is also an important factor.

13. 是的,这篇文章研究了类似粒子大小和分层孔结构等性质如何影响PtSn/TS-1催化剂的性能。它发现更小的结晶尺寸在晶体之间引入了介孔,增加了外表面积。这种分层孔结构改善了质量转移和活性位点的可及性,导致了更好的催化性能,尤其是对于100 nm TS-1负载的PtSn催化剂。载体的酸度也是一个重要因素。

<quotes>

[1] "The reactants on PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalysts are more apt to contact the active centers; the conversion of propane is therefore higher."

[2] "The diminished size introduces mesopores among crystals, as certified by N2 sorption results. The hierarchical pores are beneficial to the entry of reactant molecules and the departure of product molecules." 

[3] "Because the activity is restored as discussed above, the deposited carbon is believed to be burnt out after regeneration."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

14. Yes, the article proposes that the smaller crystal size and hierarchical pore structure of the 100 nm TS-1 supported PtSn catalyst improves contact between reactants and active sites, enhancing propane conversion. The mesopores facilitate reactant access and product departure, improving performance. Coke deposits during reaction, but can be burnt off during regeneration, restoring activity.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

14. 是的,这篇文章提出,100 nm TS-1负载的PtSn催化剂较小的结晶尺寸和分层孔结构改善了反应物与活性位点的接触,提高了丙烷转化率。介孔促进了反应物的进入和产物的流出,提高了性能。反应过程中会生成焦炭沉积,但可以在再生过程中被燃烧掉,恢复活性。
