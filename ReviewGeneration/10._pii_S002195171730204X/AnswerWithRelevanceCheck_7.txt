         [1] A series of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts with systematically controlled zeolite sizes were successfully synthesized. 

         [2] The contents of platinum and tin in the final catalyst were fixed at 0.5 and 0.6 wt.%, respectively.

         [3] Dissection of diffraction peaks indicates that the smaller samples show a lower diffraction intensity generally...Particularly, no peaks of crystalline platinum or tin are detected in any sample, which indicates a very small size of these.

         [4] The initial conversion of propane can reach as high as 53.5% and is still as high as 52.4% in the fourth cycle.

         Yes, the article evaluates PtSn bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It synthesizes a series of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts with 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.6 wt% Sn, showing high initial propane conversion up to 53.5% that remains stable after multiple cycles. The PtSn nanoparticles are highly dispersed and have small size based on the XRD patterns.

         [1] A series of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts with systematically controlled zeolite sizes were successfully synthesized. 

         [2] All PtSn/TS-1 samples exhibit typical MFI-type XRD patterns at (011), (020), (051), (303), (313), and (532), as observed in the 2θ ranges of 7.88.7 and 2225, implying the high purity of catalysts.

         [3] The TS-1 zeolites have an average crystal diameter of 100 nm initially and increase by 2, 3, or even 50 times when the synthesis conditions are changed; the largest TS-1 crystals are approximately 5.7 μm.
