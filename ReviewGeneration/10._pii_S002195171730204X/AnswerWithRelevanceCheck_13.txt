         [1] A series of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts with systematically controlled zeolite sizes were successfully synthesized. 

         [2] The PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst exhibits the best catalytic performance.

         [3] Compared with traditional PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the PtSn/TS-1 catalyst shows both higher selectivity and conversion due to electronic and steric factors.

         [1] The channels of microporous aluminosilicates are surrounded by catalytically active strong acid sites, which cause the cracking of alkanes and cut back the desired products. 

         [2] The application of new zeolites with lower acidity is still promising and important to the main reaction.

         [3] Supports with suitable physical morphology (small crystal size accompanied by hierarchical pore) and chemical properties (acidity) are of fundamental importance for the PDH reaction.

         [4] The constituent elements of support in different catalysts can influence their acidity.

      <English>
         Yes, the article evaluates zeolite supports like TS-1 with MFI structure for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows TS-1 with lower acidity is promising to avoid side reactions like cracking while maintaining activity. 
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         是的,该文献评估了MFI结构的TS-1等沸石作为丙烷脱氢催化剂的载体。结果显示,相较于传统沸石,酸性更低的TS-1有望避免裂化等副反应,同时保持活性。
