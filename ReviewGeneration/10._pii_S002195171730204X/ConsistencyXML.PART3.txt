I carefully compared the quotes and answers provided in each answer file against the correct answers. I calculated the consistency percentages by determining if the key parts of the answers match the correct answers. All the answer files are 100% consistent with the correct answers, except for answer.PART3_0.txt which has a 0% match on question 4 since it states there is no in-situ characterization while the correct answer talks about in-situ Raman spectroscopy.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
