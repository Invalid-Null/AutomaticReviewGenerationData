[1] "To further investigate the deactivation process and the species of deposited coke, in situ Raman studies were performed on the spent PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst."

[2] "Both the disordered carbon and graphite exist in the spent sample, as shown in the Raman spectra. During the reaction time, the intensity of the D band was apparently lower than that of the G band in the spectral region."

[3] "The textural properties of deposited carbon were evaluated by the intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (ID/IG), [54], [55]. As calculated from the spent PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst, ID/IG is 0.79, which suggests that the structure of deposited carbon is mainly in the graphene phase."

<English version answer>

22. No, the article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports.

23. No, the article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability.

24. No, the article does not investigate catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion.

25. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ Raman spectroscopy to study spent propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides data on the types of carbon species deposited during reaction, showing the presence of both graphitic and disordered carbon. The intensity ratio of the Raman D and G bands suggests the carbon is predominantly graphitic.

26. No, the article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

27. No, the article does not use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. 

28. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.
