<quotes>

[1] "Bimetallic PtSn/TS-1 catalysts were prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method."

[2] "The contents of platinum and tin in the final catalyst were fixed at 0.5 and 0.6 wt.%, respectively."

[3] "The PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst exhibits the best catalytic performance." 

[4] "Compared with traditional PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the PtSn/TS-1 catalyst shows both higher selectivity and conversion due to electronic and steric factors."

<quotes>

[1] "The channels of microporous aluminosilicates are surrounded by catalytically active strong acid sites, which cause the cracking of alkanes and cut back the desired products."

[2] "To address this problem, methods are still needed to reduce the acid content and strength by adding alkali (earth) metal."  

[3] "The application of new zeolites with lower acidity is still promising and important to the main reaction."

[4] "Supports with suitable physical morphology (small crystal size accompanied by hierarchical pore) and chemical properties (acidity) are of fundamental importance for the PDH reaction."

[5] "The constituent elements of support in different catalysts can influence their acidity."
