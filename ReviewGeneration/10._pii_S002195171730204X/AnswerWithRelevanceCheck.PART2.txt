         The article does not compare the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts. It focuses solely on PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on titanosilicate TS-1. No comparison is made to other oxidation states or non-alloyed catalysts.

         [1] A series of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts with systematically controlled zeolite sizes were successfully synthesized. 
         [2] The contents of platinum and tin in the final catalyst were fixed at 0.5 and 0.6 wt.%, respectively.
         [3] The PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst exhibits the best catalytic performance. 
         [4] Compared with traditional PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the PtSn/TS-1 catalyst shows both higher selectivity and conversion due to electronic and steric factors.

         Yes, the article evaluates PtSn bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It synthesizes PtSn/TS-1 catalysts with 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.6 wt% Sn, and shows the 100 nm PtSn/TS-1 catalyst has the best performance compared to PtSn/Al2O3, with higher selectivity and conversion.

         [1] To address this problem, methods are still needed to reduce the acid content and strength by adding alkali (earth) metal. The application of new zeolites with lower acidity is still promising and important to the main reaction.
         [2] The TS-1 samples have no strong acid sites, as evident from the NH3 TPD curves shown in Fig. 5A. Only one desorption peak at 160 C is observed, corresponding to a weak acid site.
         [3] It is also worthwhile to note that the acid properties of the catalysts have a large effect on the catalytic performance including propane conversion, selectivity to propylene, and stability of the catalysts.

         Yes, the article evaluates titanosilicate TS-1 zeolite as a support for propane dehydrogenation, showing it has lower acidity than conventional zeolites like ZSM-5, avoiding side reactions and improving conversion, selectivity and stability.

         [1] The TS-1 zeolites have an average crystal diameter of 100 nm initially and increase by 2, 3, or even 50 times when the synthesis conditions are changed; the largest TS-1 crystals are approximately 5.7 μm. 
         [2] The higher surface area and the existence of hierarchical porosity in smaller TS-1 zeolites result in a significant improvement in catalytic performance.
         [3] Low resistance to intercrystalline diffusion facilitates the departure of propylene from the active sites, which avoids some further side reactions, such as coking. Hence, the lifetime of smaller TS-1 zeolite-supported PtSn catalysts is much longer than that of the larger samples, as discussed above.

      <English>
         Yes, the article investigates tuning TS-1 crystal size from 100 nm to 5.7 μm. Smaller size introduces mesoporosity, enhancing diffusion and avoiding coking, significantly improving conversion, selectivity and catalyst lifetime.
