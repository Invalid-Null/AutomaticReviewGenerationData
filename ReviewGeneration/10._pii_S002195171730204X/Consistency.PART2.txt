I carefully compared each answer file to the correct answers provided and calculated the consistency percentage based on how much of the key content from the correct answer was contained in each comparative answer. The answer.PART2_2.txt file did not contain any relevant content, so it received 0% consistency. The other files contained all the key points from the correct answers, so I marked those as 100% consistent. Please let me know if you would like me to explain or elaborate on any part of the comparison.
