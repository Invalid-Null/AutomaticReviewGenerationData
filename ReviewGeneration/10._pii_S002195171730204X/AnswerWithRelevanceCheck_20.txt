         [1] "Bimetallic PtSn/TS-1 catalysts were prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method." 

         [2] "The contents of platinum and tin in the final catalyst were fixed at 0.5 and 0.6 wt.%, respectively."

         [3] "The PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst exhibits the best catalytic performance."
         
         [4] "Compared with traditional PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the PtSn/TS-1 catalyst shows both higher selectivity and conversion due to electronic and steric factors."

         [1] "The channels of microporous aluminosilicates are surrounded by catalytically active strong acid sites, which cause the cracking of alkanes and cut back the desired products."

         [2] "To address this problem, methods are still needed to reduce the acid content and strength by adding alkali (earth) metal." 

         [3] "The application of new zeolites with lower acidity is still promising and important to the main reaction."

         [4] "Supports with suitable physical morphology (small crystal size accompanied by hierarchical pore) and chemical properties (acidity) are of fundamental importance for the PDH reaction."

         [5] "The constituent elements of support in different catalysts can influence their acidity."
