 Here is the JSON structure comparing the consistency of the answers in each file to the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"}, 
  "6": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I manually compared each answer file's response to the correct answer for each question and calculated the consistency percentage. The answer.PART3_0.txt file contains completely incorrect answers, while the other files match the correct answers 100%.
