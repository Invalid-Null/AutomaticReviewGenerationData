<quotes>
[1] Bimetallic PtSn-based catalysts exhibit higher catalytic activity and better tolerance of coke formation [2].

[2] PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst is continuously regenerated and tested. After the redispersion of PtSn active components and coke combustion, the catalyst still preserves its better catalytic performance, which makes it suitable for commercial application.

<quotes>
[1] A series of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts with systematically controlled zeolite sizes were successfully synthesized. The particle sizes of the supports are in the range from 100 nm to 5.72 μm, while keeping a narrow size distribution.

[2] The minimal size TS-1 (100 nm)-supported PtSn catalyst gave the best catalytic performance and almost preserved the activity after a four-cycle reaction. 

[3] Supports with suitable physical morphology (small crystal size accompanied by hierarchical pore) and chemical properties (acidity) are of fundamental importance for the PDH reaction.
