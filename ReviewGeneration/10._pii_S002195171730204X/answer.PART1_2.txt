<quotes>

[1] "To further increase the production of propylene, a great deal of effort has been devoted to improving the catalytic performance of PtSn-based catalysts."

[2] "The catalysts were characterized by means of SEM, XRD, BET, UV-DRS, Raman, TEM, and XPS. Their microscopic structures are similar, such as the coordination state of titanium, the area of micropores, and acidity."

[3] "PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) shows the highest activity due to having the lowest diffusion resistance."

[4] "The minimal size TS-1-supported PtSn catalyst exhibits the best catalytic performance."

5. Yes, the article evaluates a supported mono-metallic PtSn alloy catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It synthesizes PtSn supported on TS-1 zeolites of varying crystal sizes from 100 nm to 5.72 μm, and finds the 100 nm support gives the highest activity and lowest diffusion resistance. The catalysts are characterized by SEM, XRD, BET, UV-DRS, Raman, TEM, and XPS.

[1] "Supports with suitable physical morphology (small crystal size accompanied by hierarchical pore) and chemical properties (acidity) are of fundamental importance for the PDH reaction." 

[2] "The catalysts with the smallest crystal size show the largest BET surface area of 431.6 m2/g and the surface area gradually decreases as the particle size increases."

[3] "PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst is continuously regenerated and tested. After the redispersion of PtSn active components and coke combustion, the catalyst still preserves its better catalytic performance, which makes it suitable for commercial application."

6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like crystal size, porosity, surface area, and acidity affect performance of the PtSn/TS-1 catalysts. It finds smaller crystal size gives higher surface area and hierarchical porosity, improving activity and lifetime. The 100 nm catalyst maintains performance after regeneration, making it promising.
