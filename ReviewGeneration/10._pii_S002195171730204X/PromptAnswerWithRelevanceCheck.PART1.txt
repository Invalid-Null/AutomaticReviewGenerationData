<Chinese version answer>
回答:这篇文章没有探索金属氧化物催化剂中金属与载体的界面效应,因为它仅关注PtSn/TS-1沸石催化剂。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "Supported noble metal catalysts are extensively used for propane dehydrogenation in both the academy and industry."

[2] "Bimetallic PtSn/TS-1 catalysts were prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method." 

[3] "The contents of platinum and tin in the final catalyst were fixed at 0.5 and 0.6 wt.%, respectively."

[4] "It is obvious that the activity is relevant to the crystal size of TS-1; all other samples with medium size show middle activity."

[5] "The minimal size TS-1-supported PtSn catalyst exhibits the best catalytic performance."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported PtSn bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It prepares a series of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts with different crystal sizes by incipient wetness impregnation with fixed Pt and Sn loadings. The data shows that smaller crystal size TS-1 supports lead to higher propane conversion, with the 100 nm TS-1 catalyst showing the best performance. 

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
回答:是的,这篇文章评估了载有PtSn双金属的催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它通过起始湿度浸渍法制备了一系列不同晶体大小的PtSn/TS-1催化剂,Pt和Sn的载量是固定的。数据显示,更小的TS-1晶体尺寸支撑导致更高的丙烷转化率,100 nm TS-1催化剂显示出最佳性能。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "The smaller samples exhibit better catalytic performance. For the PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst, the initial conversion of propane can reach as high as 53.5% and still remains at 47.7% after 7 h reaction."

[2] "Supports with suitable physical morphology (small crystal size accompanied by hierarchical pore) and chemical properties (acidity) are of fundamental importance for the PDH reaction."

[3] "To achieve better catalytic performance, a smaller support is necessary."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like crystal size affect the performance of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts. It shows that smaller crystal sizes lead to higher propane conversion and selectivity to propylene. The 100 nm TS-1 catalyst maintains high activity after 7 hours due to its hierarchical pore structure improving reactant/product diffusion. Smaller size also increases surface area and active site accessibility.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
回答:是的,这篇文章研究了诸如晶体大小等性质如何影响PtSn/TS-1催化剂的性能。它显示更小的晶体尺寸导致更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。100 nm TS-1催化剂在7小时后保持高活性,这是因为其分级孔结构改善了反应物/产物的扩散。更小的尺寸也增加了表面积和活性位点的可及性。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "The diminished size introduces mesopores among crystals, as certified by N2 sorption results." 

[2] "The external surface area of as-prepared TS-1 zeolite increases with the reduction of crystal size, because a secondary mesopore system is gradually formed among the small crystal particles."

[3] "Supports with suitable physical morphology (small crystal size accompanied by hierarchical pore) and chemical properties (acidity) are of fundamental importance for the PDH reaction."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

13. Yes, the article investigates how properties like particle size and hierarchical pore structure affect the performance of the PtSn/TS-1 catalysts. It finds that smaller crystal size introduces mesopores between the crystals, increasing external surface area. This hierarchical pore structure improves mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites, leading to better catalytic performance, especially for the 100 nm TS-1 supported PtSn catalyst. Acidity of the support is also an important factor.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

13. 是的,这篇文章研究了类似粒子大小和分层孔结构等性质如何影响PtSn/TS-1催化剂的性能。它发现更小的结晶尺寸在晶体之间引入了介孔,增加了外表面积。这种分层孔结构改善了质量转移和活性位点的可及性,导致了更好的催化性能,尤其是对于100 nm TS-1负载的PtSn催化剂。载体的酸度也是一个重要因素。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "The reactants on PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalysts are more apt to contact the active centers; the conversion of propane is therefore higher."

[2] "The diminished size introduces mesopores among crystals, as certified by N2 sorption results. The hierarchical pores are beneficial to the entry of reactant molecules and the departure of product molecules." 

[3] "Because the activity is restored as discussed above, the deposited carbon is believed to be burnt out after regeneration."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

14. Yes, the article proposes that the smaller crystal size and hierarchical pore structure of the 100 nm TS-1 supported PtSn catalyst improves contact between reactants and active sites, enhancing propane conversion. The mesopores facilitate reactant access and product departure, improving performance. Coke deposits during reaction, but can be burnt off during regeneration, restoring activity.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

14. 是的,这篇文章提出,100 nm TS-1负载的PtSn催化剂较小的结晶尺寸和分层孔结构改善了反应物与活性位点的接触,提高了丙烷转化率。介孔促进了反应物的进入和产物的流出,提高了性能。反应过程中会生成焦炭沉积,但可以在再生过程中被燃烧掉,恢复活性。
