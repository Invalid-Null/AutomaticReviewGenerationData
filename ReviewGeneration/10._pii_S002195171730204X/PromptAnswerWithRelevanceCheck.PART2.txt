<quotes>

[1] "To address this problem, methods are still needed to reduce the acid content and strength by adding alkali (earth) metal. The application of new zeolites with lower acidity is still promising and important to the main reaction."

[2] "The TS-1 samples have no strong acid sites, as evident from the NH3 TPD curves shown in Fig. 5A. Only one desorption peak at 160 C is observed, corresponding to a weak acid site."  

[3] "It is also worthwhile to note that the acid properties of the catalysts have a large effect on the catalytic performance including propane conversion, selectivity to propylene, and stability of the catalysts."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

6. Yes, the article evaluates titanosilicate zeolite TS-1 as a support for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It notes that TS-1 exhibits only weak acidity compared to conventional zeolites like ZSM-5, avoiding side reactions like cracking and coking. NH3-TPD data in Fig. 5 shows TS-1 has only a single peak at 160°C indicating weak acid sites, while ZSM-5 has additional strong acid sites. The weak acidity of TS-1 is noted to improve propane conversion, propylene selectivity and catalyst lifetime compared to ZSM-5.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

6. 是的,本文评估了硅钛质沸石TS-1作为丙烷脱氢催化剂载体。它指出,与传统沸石(如ZSM-5)相比,TS-1仅仅展示弱酸性,避免了裂化和结焦等副反应。图5中的NH3-TPD数据显示,TS-1仅有单一峰位于160°C,表示弱酸中心,而ZSM-5有额外的强酸中心。文中指出TS-1的弱酸性与ZSM-5相比可以提高丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和催化剂使用寿命。

[1] "The TS-1 zeolites have an average crystal diameter of 100 nm initially and increase by 2, 3, or even 50 times when the synthesis conditions are changed; the largest TS-1 crystals are approximately 5.7 μm."

[2] "The higher surface area and the existence of hierarchical porosity in smaller TS-1 zeolites result in a significant improvement in catalytic performance." 

[3] "Low resistance to intercrystalline diffusion facilitates the departure of propylene from the active sites, which avoids some further side reactions, such as coking. Hence, the lifetime of smaller TS-1 zeolite-supported PtSn catalysts is much longer than that of the larger samples, as discussed above."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

7. Yes, the article investigates the effects of tuning TS-1 crystal size from 100 nm to 5.7 μm. Smaller crystal size introduces mesoporosity between crystals, enhancing mass transfer. The 100 nm catalyst shows higher surface area and hierarchical porosity, significantly improving propane conversion to 53.5% and catalyst lifetime. Faster diffusion through intercrystalline mesopores avoids side reactions like coking, increasing lifetime.

</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>

7. 是的,本文研究了调节TS-1晶粒大小从100 nm到5.7 μm的效应。较小的晶粒大小在晶粒之间引入了介孔,增强了质量传递。100 nm催化剂显示出更高的表面积和层次多孔结构,显著提高了丙烷转化率至53.5%和催化剂使用寿命。 通过晶格间介孔更快的扩散避免了结焦等副反应,增加了使用寿命。
