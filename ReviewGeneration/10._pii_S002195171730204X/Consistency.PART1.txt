 Here is the comparison of the answer files against the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%", 
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%", 
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "3": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "4": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "5": {
    "answer0.txt": "100%",
    "answer1.txt": "0%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "0%"
  },
  "6": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "0%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "0%"
  },
  "7": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "0%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "0%"
  }
}
```

The percentage indicates the consistency ratio between each answer file's response and the correct answer for that question. 0% means completely inconsistent, 100% means completely consistent.
