        [1] "As coke plays a significant role in the deactivation of the propane dehydrogenation process, its detailed composition and formation deserve systematic investigation. In situ characterization studies offer the opportunity to investigate the nature of catalysts under controlled conditions [49]. In order to further analyze the process of deactivation and the species of deposited coke, in situ Raman studies were performed on the spent PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst."
        
        [2] "The intensity of the D band was apparently lower than that of the G band in the spectral region. The textural properties of deposited carbon were evaluated by the intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (ID/IG) [54], [55]. As calculated from the spent PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst, ID/IG is 0.79, which suggests that the structure of deposited carbon is mainly in the graphene phase."

        Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ Raman spectroscopy to study deposited carbon species on spent propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It performs in-situ Raman studies on spent PtSn/TS-1 catalysts to analyze the deactivation process and composition of coke deposits. The Raman data reveals the presence of both graphitic and disordered carbon species.
