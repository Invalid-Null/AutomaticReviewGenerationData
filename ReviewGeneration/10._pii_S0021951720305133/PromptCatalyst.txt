Abstract
The effects of Si-additive modification on nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) over γ-Al2O3 sheet-supported isolate Co2+ catalysts have been investigated. Si addition cannot change the nanosheet structure and tetrahedral Co2+ coordination of the Co catalysts; nonetheless, it introduces a number of moderate-strength acid sites by the formation of composite SiAl oxides. Promoted catalytic stability is achieved on Si-modified Si–Co–Al2O3 in comparison with the Si-free Co–Al2O3 catalyst. In spite of similar total content and H/C ratios of deposited coke species on these two spent catalysts, a relatively lower graphitization degree and a higher ratio of highly reactive coke species are observed on the Si–Co–Al2O3 catalyst. Furthermore, the co-feeding of C3H6 significantly changes the coking reaction rates but not the coke distributions on Co-based catalysts. The C3H6 temperature-programmed desorption profiles and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra suggest that the interaction of C3H6 with Co catalysts can be affected by Si modification tuning the coking property and the catalytic stability of Co2+–Al2O3-based catalysts for the PDH reactions.

1. Introduction
Light olefins such as ethylene and propylene are important building blocks in modern chemical industries, and their growing demands and increasing exploration of shale gas have prompted interest in the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes [1]. The commercial production of propylene by propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been developed worldwide as a valuable complement to the traditional naphtha-cracking process. Two types of catalytic technologies are primarily employed: the Cr/Al2O3-catalyzed Catofin process and the PtSn/Al2O3-catalyzed Oleflex process [2]. Cobalt-based catalysts also display the potential to catalyze the PDH reaction effectively due to their ability in hydrocarbon C–H activation and hydrogen recombinative desorption (Table S1) [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. For instance, single-site Co2+ on SiO2 exhibits high C3H6 selectivity by following a non-redox mechanism [8]. Considering its endothermal nature, the PDH process requires a high temperature to achieve economically viable production efficiency. However, harsh high-temperature reaction conditions result in severe PDH catalyst deactivation by sintering/change of active metallic sites and coke deposition [9], [10], [11], [12], [13].
The catalytic stability of Co-based catalysts largely depends on the structural properties of active Co sites [14], [15], [16]. Li et al. have reported that the PDH reaction pathways, dehydrogenation and pyrolysis, are determined by the dispersion and the chemical state of Co species on γ-Al2O3 surfaces [17]. Structural change from Co2+ to metallic Co0 during the PDH reaction most likely leads to the cracking of C–C bonds and the formation of CH4, C2 byproducts, and even coke species, if the active Co2+ site lacks proper stabilization by supports. By means of a strong anchoring effect provided by modification with Zr species, the PDH reaction rate and the catalyst life of Co2+/SiO2 catalysts can be promoted [18]. The high structural stability of sheet-shaped γ-Al2O3-supported isolate Co2+ catalysts during the PDH reactions benefits from moderate interaction between Co species and the Al2O3 matrix [19].
Coke-caused catalyst deactivation in PDH reactions is commonly attributed to the poisoning of the active sites and/or the blocking of catalyst pores or channels over a long time on stream [20], [21], [22]. The coke species deposited on the Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst during the PDH reaction have been identified as including aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphites, and aliphatics can be further transformed into aromatics through deep dehydrogenation reactions [23]. For the formation of these coke species on the metal sites, the dimerization of adsorbed C3H6 intermediates is regarded as the kinetically relevant step [24]. The strong adsorption of C3H6 has also been confirmed to be involved in a kinetic model of monolayer–multilayer coke growth on the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst [25]. Therefore, the coking processes in the metal-catalyzed PDH reactions are significantly affected by propylene chemisorption [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. Relatively weaker interaction of propylene with catalyst surfaces leads to its facile desorption for high selectivity and anti-coke properties. For instance, one of the positive effects of co-feeding hydrogen in the PDH reactions is to decrease the adsorption strength of C3H6 on Pt(1 1 1) surfaces and to increase the energy barriers for inhibiting deep dehydrogenation and coking processes [31]. The hydroxyl (V–OH) groups blocking the exposed V ions in VOx/Al2O3 catalysts can significantly enhance the catalytic stability and anti-coke properties by facilitating C3H6 desorption [32], [33]. In addition to the adsorption strength, the chemisorption geometry of C3H6 on the catalyst surfaces is also a critical factor in selecting the further transformation pathways, such as dehydrogenation, cracking, and oligomerization, causing the formation of various byproducts and coke species. The chemisorption of C3H6 on single-crystal Pt surfaces has been investigated extensively using in situ spectral experiments and theoretical calculations [34]. Scheme S1 in the Supplementary Materials shows three C3H6 adsorption modes on Pt(1 1 1) surfaces, dehydrogenated propylidyne, di-σ bonding, and π-bonding, and these modes can be affected by the C3H6 coverage and the temperature [35], [36]. Nonetheless, the influence of the C3H6 adsorption configuration on catalytic stability and coke formation in powder-based PDH catalysts in consideration of the pressure gap and material gap in catalysis has rarely been reported. The key steps of the PDH reaction on Co-based catalysts, including coking and C3H6 adsorption–desorption, still remain unclear and have been far less widely studied.
In this work, the relationship between catalytic performance and catalyst structure for sheet-shaped Al2O3-supported isolate Co2+ catalysts modified by Si additives in the PDH reaction is explored, considering that newly introduced surface sites may affect the interaction with propylene as well as the coking process. The structural changes of Si-modified catalysts, especially the physicochemical states of Co2+ sites and acid sites, and catalytic PDH performance are first characterized. The amount and distribution of the formed coke species are analyzed using thermogravimetry, Raman spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed hydrogenation techniques. The adsorption–desorption behavior of C3H6 on the Co catalysts is investigated by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectrum and temperature-programmed desorption experiments. The interaction between C3H6 and the catalyst is discussed further to better understand the stability of Co2+-based PDH catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The sheet-shaped γ-Al2O3 support was prepared by a modified hydrothermal method [37]. Al(NO3)3·9H2O (6.44 g) and urea (CO(NH2)2, 9.40 g) were dissolved in 190 mL of deionized water and stirred vigorously at 25 °C for 20 min. The formed solution was transferred into an autoclave and hydrothermally treated at 100 °C for 48 h. Then the precipitate was filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried overnight. For 5Co-Al2O3 and xSi-5Co-Al2O3 (x = 1, 5, 10) catalysts, a similar procedure was used, except for adding certain amounts of Co and/or Si precursors, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, Si(OC2H5)4). All these samples were finally obtained by calcination in air at 600 °C for 2 h. The Co loadings were fixed at 5 wt% for these catalysts, and the molar ratios of Si to Co were 1:5, 1:1, and 2:1 for 1Si-5Co-Al2O3, 5Si-5Co-Al2O3, and 10Si-5Co-Al2O3, respectively.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The loadings of Al, Co, and Si were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer Avio 200). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Bruker AXS D8 Focus diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The operating conditions were 40 kV and 40 mA, and the scan range was 10°–80° in 2θ. By choosing the sharp peaks of the γ-Al2O3 (3 1 1), (4 0 0), and (4 4 0) planes, the relative crystallinity degree of 5Si-5Co-Al2O3 catalyst relative to 5Co-Al2O3 catalyst was calculated. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded on an Autosorb-iQ analyzer from Quantachrome. After degassing under vacuum conditions at 200 °C for 4 h, adsorption–desorption was performed at −196 °C. The ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance (UV–Vis-DR) spectrum was obtained on a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrometer equipped with a 150 mm integrating sphere and a BaSO4 reference. The measurement range was 300–900 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a JEOL JEM 3010 model at 300 kV. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping analysis was carried out on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 TEM equipped with a high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) detector with 200 kV operation voltage. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of coke species was conducted in air on a TGA 2 (Mettler Toledo). Spent catalyst powder (20 mg) separated carefully from quartz was used, and the heating rate was 10 °C/min. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum was measured on an Escalab250Xi electron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with monochromatic 150 W AlKα radiation. The C1s peak at 284.6 eV was used as a reference to calibrate the binding energy (BE). The Raman spectrum was obtained on a Horiba HR Evolution spectrometer with a 532-nm excitation laser, operated at an exposure time of 1 s and three accumulations.
The 31P magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) experiment was performed on a Bruker Ascend-500 spectrometer at a resonance frequency of 202.63 MHz with a 4 mm triple-resonance MAS probe at a spinning rate of 12 kHz. The spectra with high-power proton decoupling were recorded using a π/2 pulse length of 3.2 μs and a recycle delay of 30 s. The chemical shift of 31P was externally referenced to 1 M aqueous H3PO4. Prior to the adsorption of trimethylphosphine (TMP) molecules, the sample was placed in glass tubes and then connected to a vacuum line for dehydration. The sample was heated to 400 °C at 1 °C/min and kept at a pressure below 10−3 Pa for 10 h. After cooling to room temperature, sufficient TMP molecules were introduced into the activated sample and then frozen by liquid N2 to reach adsorption equilibration. Subsequently, the sample was evacuated at room temperature for 15 min on the vacuum line to eliminate physisorbed TMP. Finally, the sample tube was flame-sealed. Prior to the NMR experiments, the sealed sample was transferred into a ZrO2 rotor with a Kel-F end cap under dry nitrogen in a glovebox.
The temperature-programmed desorption of propylene (C3H6-TPD) was performed on a chemisorption analyzer (AutoChem 2920, Micromeritics) connected with an online mass spectrometer (MS, QGA, Hiden Analytical Ltd.). The sample (50 mg) was pretreated in 30 mL/min of Ar at 400 °C for 2 h and cooled to 0 °C under liquid nitrogen. The adsorption of pure C3H6 (10 mL/min) was carried out for 1 h and then purged with Ar for 1 h. The MS signal of C3H6-TPD measurement was collected till 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Coke species on the spent catalyst were also characterized by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) and hydrogenation (TPH). The sample was first purged in Ar at 100 °C for 1 h, and the feed gas was subsequently switched to 10 vol% O2/Ar for TPO and 10 vol% H2/Ar for TPH to achieve a stable baseline. The temperature was increased from 100 to 900 °C at a ramping rate of 5 °C/min, and the formed CO2, CO, H2O, or CH4 were monitored by an online MS.
The in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of C3H6 adsorption and desorption were obtained on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 spectrometer equipped with a mercuric cadmium telluride (MCT) detector and a low-temperature cell (Harrick Scientific). Dry KBr (pretreated in N2 at 300 °C) was used to collect the background at different temperatures in N2 flow. To eliminate the influence of the condensed water at low temperatures as far as possible, 1.5 L/min of N2 was used to purge the light-path chamber outside the sample cell. The sample was pretreated to 400 °C for 2 h under 50 mL/min of N2 and cooled down to −20 °C under liquid nitrogen. The adsorption of C3H6 (20 mL/min) and the purge by N2 (50 mL/min) were carried out for 30 min each. The heating rate was 5 °C/min and the equilibrium time was 15 min at each temperature point. The spectrum of the C3H6 adsorbed on the catalyst at different temperatures was recorded.
The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of pyridine adsorption–desorption were collected in transmission mode on a Thermo Nicolet iS50 spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector. A certain amount of the sample was pressed into a self-supporting wafer and placed in a cell equipped with CaF2 windows. The sample was pretreated under vacuum at 300 °C for 1 h and the adsorption of pyridine was conducted at 30 °C for 30 min. For removal of the gaseous and the weakly adsorbed pyridine, degassing was then performed for 1 h. The pyridine adsorption spectra were recorded in situ with 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm−1 at 150 and 300 °C. The absorbance signals were finally plotted by normalizing the wafer weight to compare the acid contents and strengths.
2.3. Catalytic reaction
The catalytic PDH reaction was performed on a quartz tubular fixed-bed reactor with 8 mm inner diameter under atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (0.15 g, 40–60 mesh) was diluted with quartz sand loaded in the center of the reactor. The effect of the dilution ratio of catalyst to quartz was first clarified. Quartz sand (0.15–1.5 g) was used to mix with the catalyst, and the conversions of the PDH reactions at various dilution ratios were similar, as shown in Fig. S1 (Supplementary Materials). To facilitate separation for the characterization of the spent catalysts, an equal weight (0.15 g) of quartz sand relative to the catalyst was used in the reactions. The catalyst was pretreated in N2 from room temperature to 590 °C at a heating rate of 15 °C/min and kept for 30 min to reach steady state and remove the impurities. As shown in Fig. S2, online MS signals confirmed that the impurities, such as adsorbed water and CO2, as well as the water molecules that might originate from the condensation of surface hydroxyl groups were eliminated during the pretreatment stage. For the PDH reaction, the molar ratio of C3H8:H2:N2 was 1:0.8:3.2. The space velocity of propane on the catalyst was regulated from 27 to 500 mLC3H8 min−1 gcat−1 to reach different-level conversions. Based on calculation by ChemOffice software, the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion was 51.5% under the reaction conditions in this study. An online gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD detector channel with a 3 m TDX-1 column and a flame ionization detector (FID) channel with a KB-Al2O3 capillary column (60 m × 0.32 mm × 10 mm) was used to analyze the products, including N2, C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, C2H6, C2H2, CH4, CO, and CO2. The conversion of propane and selectivity to propylene were determined from the equations
where i represents the hydrocarbon products in the effluent gas, ni was the number of carbon atoms of component i, and Fi is the corresponding flow rate. If the coke weights are converted to the reacted C3H8 moles, the contribution of coke is minor, and can be ignored for the evaluation of catalytic performances in this work.
The turnover frequency (TOF) of C3H8 per Co atom in the catalyst for the PDH reaction with low conversion levels was calculated according to
where nin(C3H8), MCo, mcat, and wCo are the molar number of the feeding C3H8, the atomic weight of Co, the catalyst weight, and the mass fraction of Co in the catalyst, respectively. Furthermore, by converting the formed coke to reacted C3H8, the contributions were less than 0.1% in all PDH reactions., while the carbon balances under the typical evaluating conditions were within 100 ± 3%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation performance of Si–Co–Al2O3 catalysts
The catalytic PDH reaction was performed on Co-based catalysts at 590 °C, and the performance is presented in Fig. 1. For 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, C3H8 conversion initially reached 24.7% and decreased to 19.0% in 10 h of the reaction (Fig. 1A). The C3H6 selectivity increased slightly from 87.8% to 90.6% along with the declining conversion (Fig. 1B). C2H4, C2H6, and CH4 were the primary byproducts, and their selectivities were 4.0–5.7%, 2.1–1.5%, and 1.5–1.8%, respectively. The Si-modified 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst displayed an initial conversion of 24.0% and a maximal conversion of 25.3% at 3 h. A slower deactivation in the conversion was observed in the following reaction stage, and the final conversion at 10 h was 22.9%. Additionally, steady C3H6 selectivity was obtained in the range of 90.3% to 91.8% on 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst. The selectivity of C2H4, C2H6, and CH4 was 2.8–4.0%, 1.5–1.8%, and 1.1–1.4%, respectively.

A high-Si-loading 10Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst was also used in the PDH reaction to investigate the effect of the loaded amount of Si additives. The doping of 10% Si species into the Co–Al2O3 matrix increased the C3H6 selectivity to approximately 96%. However, the initial C3H8 conversion and the catalytic stability of 10Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst were both lower than those of 5Co–Al2O3 and 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalysts. Relatively rapid deactivation was observed, while the conversion decreased from ca. 23% to 15% within 10 h. These results suggested that the modification of an appropriate amount of Si additives on Co–Al2O3 catalysts was effective in facilitating the catalytic PDH performance, especially the catalyst stability.
By increasing the space velocity of C3H8 on the catalyst, low-level conversion could be achieved to compare the activities and stabilities of 5Co–Al2O3 and 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalysts. In view of the inhibition effect of C3H6 as the product in the PDH reactions, it was noted that these data may be subject to corruption even at low conversion [38]. As shown in Fig. 2, similar initial conversions were obtained at 5–6% on these two catalysts. The conversion at 20 h was 3.6% and 4.3% for 5Co–Al2O3 and 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalysts, respectively, suggesting a better stability of the Si-modified catalyst than of the Si-free catalyst at low conversion levels. The TOFCo values within 20 h of PDH reactions were estimated as 85–54 and 72–55 h−1 for 5Co–Al2O3 and 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, respectively.

The PDH reactions were also performed over 5Si–Al2O3 and a physical mixture of 5Si–Al2O3 and 5Co–Al2O3 (0.5:0.5) under identical reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 3A, a low conversion of 4% was obtained on the Co-free 5Si–Al2O3 catalyst, while the conversion of 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst (0.5 equivalent of Co) mixed with 5Si–Al2O3 catalyst was 13%, which was approximately half of 25% observed on 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst (1 equivalent of Co). The coexistence of the low-activity 5Si–Al2O3 catalyst did not affect the catalytic activity of the Co2+ sites in 5Co–Al2O3, which was in accordance with the observation that 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 and 5Co–Al2O3 catalysts exhibited similar intrinsic activities at both high and low conversion levels. However, 5Si–Al2O3 catalyst displayed a C3H6 selectivity of approximately 75%, whereas the physical mixture exhibited ca. 90% selectivity, which was close to the selectivity of 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 3B. It was speculated that 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst with a remarkably higher PDH activity of the Co-relevant site showed a strong competitive edge over 5Si–Al2O3 catalyst. Consequently, the latter could not efficiently transform C3H8 into C3H6 (75% selectivity) and byproducts (25% selectivity). Therefore, the synergistic effect between the Co, the Si species, and the Al2O3 matrix in the Si–Co–Al2O3 catalyst would be manifested in enhancing the catalytic stability rather than increasing the intrinsic activity. As shown in Fig. 2, a poorer stability of the physical mixture of 5Si–Al2O3 and 5Co–Al2O3 relative to 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 in 20 h of the PDH reaction at low conversion level also demonstrated the lack of the Si-caused synergistic effect in the mixture sample.

By regulating the space velocities to measure the low-level C3H8 conversion (<6%) without the co-feeding of C3H6, the Arrhenius dependences of these Co-based catalysts were plotted in the temperature range of 570–610 °C without consideration of the product inhibition artifact. As shown in Fig. 4, the apparent activation energy (Ea) was 165 ± 7 and 162 ± 12 kJ/mol for 5Co–Al2O3 and 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, respectively. The similar values indicated that these two catalysts might display comparable reaction rates in the rate-limiting step for the PDH reaction, which was regarded as the activation of the C3H8 C–H bond [39]. A higher Ea value of 185 ± 8 kJ/mol was obtained on 10Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, reflecting its relatively lower C–H activation ability. There was no difference in the C–H activation ability and the initial conversion in the PDH reactions between the Si-free 5Co–Al2O3 and the Si-modified 5Si–5Co–Al2O3. The distinct deactivation performances observed on these two catalysts might be related to either the structural stability of Co2+ sites or varied coking processes determined by the modification with Si additives.

3.2. Physicochemical properties of Si–Co–Al2O3 catalysts
A number of characterizations were carried out to reveal the effect of Si addition on the structure of the Al2O3-supported Co catalyst, in particular Co and Si sites. Similar loading amounts of Co was verified as approximately 5 wt% for both catalysts based on the ICP-OES analysis results. The TEM images in Fig. 5A–5B illustrated that both 5Co–Al2O3 and 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalysts possessed sheet-like morphology without clearly visible nanoparticles. The γ-Al2O3 nanosheets were transformed from sheet-shaped boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)) precursors, exposing the most densely packed γ-Al2O3(1 1 1) as the dominant basal plane [37]. The EDX mapping analyses for Co, Al, O, and Si further demonstrated highly homogeneous distribution of the individual elements in 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 5C–5F. One-pot hydrothermal synthesis with Co and Si additives could not induce the formation of any new phase except sheet-shaped γ-Al2O3, which was also supported by the XRD patterns. Fig. S3 showed that all diffraction peaks were well matched with the typical pattern of the γ-Al2O3 phase (JCPDS 29-0063). Neither Co-relevant phases including metallic Co0 and Co oxide nor a SiO2 phase appeared, indicating the high dispersion of both Co and Si species in the γ-Al2O3 matrix. No significant peak shift was observed on 5Co–Al2O3 or 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalysts; nonetheless, 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst displayed slightly broader full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) values of the peaks than 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst. When 5Co–Al2O3 was used as the reference, the relative crystallinity of 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 was approximately 72%, suggesting that the existence of Si heteroatoms could lead to the formation of the amorphous structure for the catalysts. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms are presented in Fig. S4, and the BET surface area and porosity data are provided in Table S2. 5Co–Al2O3 and 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 showed similar surface areas and pore volumes, indicating that the modification of Si species with a 1Si:1Co ratio could not change the porous texture of Co2+-doped Al2O3 nanosheets. When the Si loading increased further to 10%, the catalyst morphology could not be maintained well. Both the surface area and the pore volume of 10Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst were dramatically lower than those of 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst (SBET = 193 and 125 m2/g, Vtotal = 0.50 and 0.34 cm3 g−1, respectively).

The UV–Vis DR spectra (Fig. 6) of 5Co–Al2O3 and 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalysts clearly showed a group of absorption bands located at 540, 577, and 631 nm, which were assigned to the ν3 (4A2→4T1(P)) transition characteristic of the tetrahedral Co2+ ions [40]. An additional broad band at ca. 370 nm appeared on 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, which may be attributed either to the transformation of symmetrical tetrahedral Co2+ to highly distorted tetrahedral coordination that was caused by the Si modification or to possible oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+ species [41]. The absence of the peak at ca. 680 nm suggested that there might be no spinal Co3O4 phase with the ligand–metal charge transfer of O2–→Co3+ [42], [43]. The Co2p XPS spectra of the Co-based catalysts displayed two spin–orbit doublet peaks of Co2+ and Co3+ at Co2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbits, and corresponding broad satellite peaks, as shown in Fig. S5. Two doublet peaks and two satellite peaks were fitted with equal peak widths. The Co2p3/2 peak at 781.6 eV and the Co2p1/2 peak at 797.4 eV were responding to Co2+ species, while the Co2p3/2 peak at 779.8 eV and the Co2p1/2 peak at 795.5 eV were attributed to Co3+ species [44], [45], [46]. The ratios of Co2+ and Co3+ were similar for 5Co–Al2O3 and xSi–5Co–Al2O3 (x = 1, 5, 10) catalysts, approximately 91–92%/9–8%, indicating that the Si additives could not change the oxidation state of Co sites. According to combining analysis results, the tetrahedral Co2+ sites dominated the Co species on the catalyst surface, which was not affected by the modification with Si additives.

The Si2p XPS spectra in Fig. S6 showed a single peak of Si4+ species at ca. 102.0 eV, while the signal-to-noise ratio reflecting the density of the surface Si species increased with increasing Si loading for xSi–5Co–Al2O3 (x = 1, 5, 10) and 5Si–Al2O3 catalysts. Considering that these Si additives might afford a certain number of acid sites by forming composite Si–Al oxides, the surface acidic properties of 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 and 5Co–Al2O3 catalysts therefore studied with FT-IR characterizations of pyridine adsorption–desorption. The adsorption of pyridine on the catalyst was performed at 25 °C, and the IR spectrum was recorded after vacuum desorption at 150 and 300 °C. As shown in Fig. 7A, only the characteristic bands of Lewis acid sites located at 1450, 1491, 1575, 1612, and 1622 cm−1 were observed, while the Brønsted-acid-sites-relevant band at 1540 cm−1 was absent on both catalysts. Similar integral peak areas at 1450 cm−1 were obtained on these two catalysts after pyridine desorption at 150 °C. However, when the temperature of pyridine desorption reached to 300 °C, the Lewis acidity peak area was reduced to 25% and 41% for 5Co–Al2O3 and 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalysts respectively, indicating that Si doping led to the formation of relatively stronger Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface. The 31P MAS NMR spectra using TMP as probe molecules further provided more sensitive information on the surface acidity for the Si-modified catalysts [47], [48]. As shown in Fig. 7B, a sharp peak at −64 ppm was assigned to physically adsorbed TMP molecules, while a strong peak at −50 ppm corresponded to the adsorption of TMP with the Lewis acid sites [49], [50]. A barely distinguishable peak at −4 ppm from the sideband (8 ppm) was attributed to the interaction between TMPH+ species and Brønsted acid sites [51], [52]. For 1Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, a clear signal related to Lewis acid sites was observed, while the signal responding to Brønsted acid sites could not be distinguished from the sideband. The Lewis acid sites dominated over 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, while Brønsted acid sites might be isolated due to its dramatically low content. For 10Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, a stronger peak at −4 ppm was observed, indicating that the ratio of Brønsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites increased with increasing Si loading. Considering the interference from the magnetic Co species, the TMP-labelled 31P NMR spectra were also obtained on the Co-free xSi–Al2O3 (x = 0, 1, 5, 10) samples, as shown in Fig. 7C. The spectra with better data quality showed a clear trend for the content of Brønsted acid sites (peaks at −5 ppm) to increase with increasing loadings of Si species in the catalysts. The peaks in the range from –32 to −58 ppm were attributed to the TMP bound to the Lewis acid sites [49], [50]. Relative to the chemical shift at −52 and −43 ppm over pure γ-Al2O3, changed positions were observed on the Si-containing catalysts; for instance, the peaks of 10Si–Al2O3 moved to −51 and −42 ppm, reflecting enhanced Lewis acid strength of the Si-modified catalyst surfaces. Therefore, modification with Si species not only changed the Lewis acid sites but also introduced a certain number of Brønsted acid sites into the Co–Al2O3 matrix (Scheme S2). It was assumed that the Lewis acid sites might originate either from the insertion of mismatched Si heteroatoms into the Co–Al2O3 matrix or from the transformation from Si-involved Brønsted acid sites via dehydration at high temperatures. Less crystallinity of 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 than of 5Co–Al2O3 was evidenced by the XRD results. A significant structural difference between 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 and high-loading 10Si–5Co–Al2O3 was also confirmed by the BET data.

It was generally accepted that the C3H8 C–C cracking, as one of the primary side reactions, was influenced by the acid sites on the catalyst surfaces. The kinetic studies of the Co/H-ZSM-5-catalyzed PDH reaction from the Iglesia group demonstrated that the reaction rate constant of C3H8 C–C cracking was affected by acid sites in zeolites but not by Co2+ cations [6]. The Lewis acid site was responsible for abstracting a hydride from the C3H6 intermediate to form the carbenium ion, and subsequently the Brønsted acid site played a crucial role in further cracking processes [1]. For the γ-Al2O3-supported Co2+ catalyst, though modification with Si additives enhanced the Lewis acidity, it could not introduce a large number of Brønsted acid sites, which was verified by the pyridine-adsorption FT-IR spectra and the TMP-labeled 31P NMR spectra.
Extensive characterization results have demonstrated the structural stability of tetrahedral Co2+ sites during the PDH reactions, due to a stabilization effect of the γ-Al2O3 matrix [19]. The Si-modified 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst also exhibited stability against the reactions. As shown in Fig. S7, TEM images of the spent 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst showed that the thin sheet shape was kept well, and there were no large Co or CoOx particles dispersed on the catalyst. The UV–Vis DR spectrum of the spent 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst is presented in Fig. 6. Only characteristic peaks of the tetrahedral Co2+ species were observed, suggesting that the catalyst surfaces were dominated by the stable Co2+ species.
3.3. Formation of coke species
The deactivation of these Co-based catalysts with stable active Co2+ sites might be attributed to the deposition of coke species during the PDH reactions. TGA analysis was performed to provide the amount of coke formed on the spent catalysts. The thermal weight loss curves in Fig. S8 showed that the coke amount on the spent 10Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst was estimated as 13.8 wt%. Smaller amounts of coke were obtained on the spent 5Co–Al2O3 and 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, 6.6 and 8.0 wt%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8A. 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst showed a slightly larger amount of coke deposits than 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst. However, taking the total amount of the converted C3H8 into account, 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst displayed a coking degree similar to that of 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst (0.60 vs. 0.54 gcoke/molC3H8). The two-stage weight-loss curves suggested the formation of at least two coke species during the PDH reactions. Furthermore, the relative content of these two coke species was different between 5Co–Al2O3 and 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalysts. The amount of coke species eliminated in the first stage was 6.1% and 5.5%, and that in the second stage was 0.5% and 2.5% for 5Co–Al2O3 and 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, respectively.

The oxidation behavior of coke species was further investigated by TPO analysis. The MS signals of CO2, CO, and H2O formation were plotted as a function of the temperature, as shown in Fig. 8B. Two-stage oxidation of coke was also observed on both the spent 5Co–Al2O3 and 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalysts. For most of the coke species, which could be oxidized at relatively low temperatures (300–530 °C), the coke oxidation temperature for the spent 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst was slightly higher than that for 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, which agreed with the results of TGA curves. Small amounts of coke on these two catalysts were oxidized at temperatures as high as 620 °C. Similar MS peak area ratios of formed H2O to CO2 + CO were obtained on these two catalysts, suggesting that their coke species might possess close H/C ratios.
Operando Raman spectra provided links between the chemistry of coke deposits and the Si-modification effect on the PDH reaction [23], [28]. Typical signals of coke species, the D band and the G band, could be distinguished in the Raman spectra of two spent Co-based catalysts, as shown in Fig. 8C. In a detailed interpretation, the most intense G band, at 1595 cm−1, responded to the doubly degenerate phonon mode with E2g symmetry at the Brillouin zone for perfect graphite lattices. An intense D1 band, at 1325 cm−1, originated from double-resonant Raman scattering of the graphene lattices with defects and in-plane transverse optic phonon modes, whose intensity usually increased with either increasing defects in the graphitic lattices or decreasing size of the graphite crystallites. The D3 band at 1220 cm−1 was assigned to amorphous carbon, while the D4 band at 1495 cm−1 was attributed to disordered graphitic lattices with A1g symmetry [53], [54], [55]. The D2 band located at 1620 cm−1 was absent in the Raman spectra, which was ascribed to E2g symmetry vibration of disordered graphitic lattices [56]. For coke analysis, Lorentzian functions were employed to fit the G and D1 bands, while Gaussian functions were used to fit the D3 and D4 bands. The deconvolution results are summarized in Table 1. Similar content of disordered graphic coke species was observed on these two catalysts. The coked 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst possessed more amorphous carbon species (10.7% vs. 7.6%) and less perfectly crystallized graphite (26.6% vs. 31.8%) than the spent 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst. According to the multistage coking model classified by Ferrari et al., the transformation sequence of coke species on catalyst surfaces was sp3 and sp2 amorphous carbons, nanocrystalline graphite, and more perfect graphite [57]. Therefore, these two catalysts were in different coking stages due to their different distributions of coke deposits. The Si-modified 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst might prevent further transformation of the coke species into perfectly crystallized graphite, and in contrast, a higher degree of graphitization was obtained in the coking process over 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst.

The TPH-MS profiles in Fig. 8D further provide the information about the hydrogenation reactivity of the coke species deposited on the spent 5Co–Al2O3 and 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalysts. The hydrogenation reaction of coke species led to the formation of methane, and the methanation temperature presented the reactivity of these carbon species [58], [59]. According to the quantitative analysis method for TPH curves of coke species reported by Eliason and Bartholomew, four types of carbon species could be classified: α-carbon (carbidic), β-carbon (amorphous), γ-carbon (carbidic), and δ-carbon (graphitic) [60], [61]. For both spent catalysts, the coke species were identified as coexisting γ-carbon and δ-carbon with the hydrogenation reactivity order γ-carbon > δ-carbon. The methanation peaks of γ-carbon and δ-carbon on the spent 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst were at approximately 570 and 800 °C, and slightly shifted peaks at approximately 550 and 760 °C were obtained on the spent 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst. However, the distributions of γ-carbon and δ-carbon were distinctly different for these two spent catalysts. The ratios of γ-carbon to δ-carbon were 62:38 and 24:76 for 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 and 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, respectively. Considering that the methanation temperature of δ-carbon species was significantly higher than the PDH reaction temperature (760, 800 °C ≫ 590 °C), a larger amount of chemically inert δ-carbon species accumulated on 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst rather than on the Si-modified 5Si–5Co–Al2O3. By comprehensively analyzing the above characterization results of the coke species on the spent catalysts, despite similar total amounts and H/C ratio of deposited coke on two spent catalysts, a higher ratio of coke species with high hydrogenation reactivity and a lower graphitization degree were observed on 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst than on 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, which could promote the catalytic stability of Co-based PDH catalysts by inhibiting coking-caused deactivation to a certain extent.
3.4. Effect of propylene co-feeding in propane dehydrogenation reactions
The C3H6 co-feeding PDH reaction was performed to study the effects of C3H6 on the catalytic performance of 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst further, especially the coking properties. As shown in Fig. 9A, the initial conversion was 3.4% at a feeding ratio of C3H8:C3H6 = 3:1. The corresponding initial reaction rate was estimated as 3 h−1, which was remarkably lower than 93 h−1 obtained in the C3H6-free PDH reaction at the low conversion level (Fig. 2). In comparison with the stability in the C3H6-free reaction, more rapid deactivation within the first 3 h was observed in the presence of C3H6. The amount of coke species deposited on the spent catalyst after the C3H6 co-feeding PDH reaction was measured by the TGA profile. As shown in Figs. 9B and S9, the coke amount was estimated as 18.0 wt%, which was significantly higher than that generated in the C3H6-free PDH reaction (8.0 wt%, Fig. 8A). When pure C3H6 instead of C3H8 was fed into the catalyst bed under identical conditions (same temperature, space velocity, and reaction time as the PDH reaction), the generated coke amount was 25.2 wt%. The corresponding distributions of coke species were analyzed with Raman spectral results. The Raman spectra are shown in Fig. S10, and the fitting results are summarized in Table 1. The distributions of various coke species were not significantly affected by the feeding ratios of C3H8 to C3H6. For instance, the formation of ideal graphite-type coke species was reduced in the 5Si-5Co-Al2O3-catalyzed C3H6 co-feeding PDH reaction: 25.8%, 24.4%, and 26.6% for pure C3H6 feeding, C3H8:C3H6 = 3:1 co-feeding, and the C3H6-free PDH reaction, respectively. Combined TGA and Raman results suggested that the co-feeding of C3H6 to increase the C3H6 coverage degree could accelerate the coking reaction, but nonetheless could not change the coking mechanism. Therefore, it was necessary to study the interaction between C3H6 and the catalyst considering its critical role in determining the coking reactions.

3.5. Interaction between propylene and catalysts
Not only the coking properties but also the overall PDH reaction performance could be influenced by the interaction of C3H6 with the catalyst surface [31]. More specifically, this interaction depended on the adsorption configuration and strength of C3H6 molecules on the catalyst surfaces; for instance, excessively strong adsorption might result in deep hydrogenation and/or C–C cleavage for the formation of byproducts (e.g., C2H4, C2H6, and CH4) and/or coke species, thus reducing the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst stability. The effect of Si additives on the adsorption and desorption of propylene was studied by the C3H6-TPD-MS technique and in situ DRIFT spectroscopy. The former detected the desorbed C3H6 molecules from the catalyst, while the latter monitored the adsorbed C3H6 molecules on the catalyst in equilibrium at a certain temperature.
The C3H6-TPD-MS profiles in Fig. 10 show the desorption curves of C3H6 on the Si-modified and Si-free catalysts. Although 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a slightly lower starting desorption temperature than 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, these two catalysts displayed similar temperatures for both the maximum desorption and complete desorption, which were approximately 30 and 80 °C, respectively. The amount of C3H6 desorbed from 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst was ca. 1.5 times higher than that from 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst. This high C3H6 adsorption amount suggested the existence of a large number of active sites on the Si-modified catalyst surfaces to anchor C3H6 molecules, in comparison with the number of the Si-free catalyst. These extra sites might include newly introduced acid sites at Al3+ in Al–O–Si pairs due to the good dispersion of Si species into the Al2O3 matrix. The π-bonded C3H6 species have been proposed as one of the intermediates to interact with the surface Lewis acid sites on Mo–V–Nb–Te mixed metal oxides [62]. This result also agreed with the report that the high surface acidity of the modified θ-Al2O3 support could promote both the activity and stability of supported PtSnK-based PDH catalysts [63]. In view of the ultrathin nanosheet morphology of 5Si–5Co–-Al2O3 catalyst, the doped Si atoms may mostly be exposed on the surface or dispersed in the subsurface, and consequently they could enhance both surface acidic properties and adsorption capacity of C3H6 molecules to a great extent, which was evidenced by the XPS Si2p spectra, the FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption, and C3H6-TPD profiles.

The interaction of C3H6 molecules with these two catalysts was further investigated by in situ DRIFT spectral characterizations. As presented in Fig. 11A and 11B, for both catalysts as references that were pretreated in dry N2 at 400 °C, a single band was located at approximately 1100 cm−1, which was ascribed to the characteristics of Al2O3 with the Al–O stretching vibration (1075 cm−1) or the Al–O–Al bending vibration (1116 cm−1). C3H6 chemisorption was performed on the catalysts at −20 °C, and the spectra of the adsorbed C3H6 were recorded after adsorption–desorption equilibrium was reached. A broad band at around 3400 cm−1 and a weak peak at around 1650 cm−1 corresponded to the signal of water, suggesting that a small amount of water still existed on the windows of the cell at −20 °C. The peak of the stretching vibration of the C3H6 C = C bond (1640 cm−1) might be covered by the H–O–H bending vibration peak of water, due to its low intensity [35]. Clear peaks of the adsorbed C3H6 at 2944 and 2825 cm−1 were observed on both 5Co–Al2O3 and 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalysts during the C3H6 desorption processes, which were assigned to the C–H stretching vibration modes [64]. A peak at 1451 cm−1 was also observed on these two catalysts, which was indexed to the asymmetric deformation vibration of the methyl C–H bond [65]. Specifically, only for the chemisorption of C3H6 on the Si-modified 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 11B), distinguished shoulder peaks were observed at 3102 and 1465 cm−1. This result reflected a slight difference in the chemisorption configurations of C3H6 on the surfaces of the Si-free and the Si-modified Co catalysts. Furthermore, 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst exhibited higher relative intensities than 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst with respect to the C3H6 C–H vibration peaks, which was in agreement with the C3H6-TPD-MS results.

Two modes might be proposed to describe the adsorption of C3H6 on the catalysts. In contrast to the strong di-σ bonding configuration of C3H6 adsorbed on the single-crystal Pt(1 1 1) surface under ultra-high-vacuum conditions, the relatively weaker π-bonded geometry might conform more to the atmospheric pressure adsorption of C3H6 on the practical Co-based catalysts [35], [64]. The C–H vibration peaks on the spectra might be determined by the different geometry of the neighboring methyl moiety relative to the C = C bond on the catalyst surfaces [34], [66]. Another possible mode might be the adsorption of the alkoxy species with varied C–H vibrations on the Brønsted acid sites of the Si-modified 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst. However, the C–O stretching vibration modes of the alkoxy species with typical peaks at 1000–1200 cm−1 might be overlapping with the Al2O3-related bands [67].
The spectra of the adsorbed C3H6 molecules in adsorption–desorption equilibrium states were further monitored on these two catalysts with temperatures rising from −20 to 250 °C. The position of the C–H stretching vibration peaks was maintained in the whole temperature range for the two catalysts. However, for the C–H asymmetric deformation vibration mode of C3H6, the peak slightly shifted from 1451 to 1466 cm−1 with increasing desorption temperature, indicating that the adsorption mode represented by the latter peak might be more stable. When the desorption temperature increased, the peak intensities of C3H6 adsorption on these two catalysts displayed the same decreasing trends. Nearly steady peak intensities were observed when the temperature exceeded ca. 160 °C for both catalysts, suggesting that the Si-free 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst and the Si-modified 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst showed similar interaction strengths with adsorbed C3H6 molecules, which was in accordance with the C3H6-TPD-MS results. Furthermore, no peaks corresponding to coke precursor species (e.g., 1555 and 1585 cm−1 for unsaturated and aromatic hydrocarbons) were detected during C3H6 desorption on these two Co-based catalysts, indicating that coking processes of oligomerization and consequent aromatization could not occur at such low temperatures (≤250 °C) [68].
Weak interaction between C3H6 molecules and the catalysts was assumed to play a positive catalytic role for the metal-catalyzed PDH reactions, because it could minimize coke formation by the electron-rich C3H6 intermediate on the metal sites [69], [70]. However, as presented by the above C3H6 TPD-MS profiles and DRIFT spectra, as well as the catalytic PDH reaction results, the Si-modified 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst possessed a similar C3H6 interaction strength but a greater amount of C3H6 chemisorption in comparison with the Si-free 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst, whereas it displayed a superior anti-coke property and higher long-term catalytic stability. Not only the strength and amount of C3H6 chemisorption on the catalyst, but also their interaction mode should be taken into account in discussing the effect of C3H6 desorption on the PDH performance, especially the catalytic stability and the coking properties, of the metal catalysts.
4. Conclusions
In summary, sheet-shaped γ-Al2O3-stabilized isolated Co2+ catalysts were further modified with Si additives. The Si modification could not change the chemical state of Co2+ sites; nonetheless, it introduces Brønsted acid sites onto the catalyst surfaces by the formation of SiAl oxides. 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst displays 24.0% initial conversion and 90.3% C3H6 selectivity, and it maintains 22.9% conversion and 91.8% selectivity in 10 h of PDH reaction at 590 °C, suggesting that the Si modification promotes the catalytic stability of the Co2+ catalyst. The spent 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst reveals a higher ratio of highly reactive carbon species and a lower graphitization level under similar total content and H/C ratio of coke species, in comparison with the spent 5Co–Al2O3 catalyst. The co-feeding of C3H6 can change both reaction rates for dehydrogenation of C3H8 and coking over 5Si–5Co–Al2O3 catalyst; nonetheless, it cannot vary the distributions of the deposited coke species. The C3H6-TPD-MS and in situ DRIFT spectral results further demonstrate that the adsorption geometry of C3H6 molecules depends on the Si-modified surface properties. The chemisorption of C3H6, a key step in the PDH reaction to determine the activity, selectivity, and coking step, is affected not only by the adsorption amount and strength but also by the specific configuration. Therefore, the enhanced catalytic stability of Al2O3-supported Co2+ catalysts modified by moderate Si species may be achieved by tuning the interaction with C3H6 and the coking process.
