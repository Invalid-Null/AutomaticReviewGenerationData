         "The paper evaluates the performance of Ga2O3 polymorphs including α-Ga2O3, β-Ga2O3, and γ-Ga2O3 as well as silica-supported β-Ga2O3/SiO2 and γ-Ga2O3/SiO2 in propane dehydrogenation."
         "It also studies a benchmark amorphous Ga/SiO2 catalyst prepared by impregnation."

         The article evaluates the performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs including α-Ga2O3, β-Ga2O3, and γ-Ga2O3 as nanocrystalline unsupported catalysts as well as silica-supported β-Ga2O3/SiO2 and γ-Ga2O3/SiO2 in propane dehydrogenation. It also studies a benchmark amorphous Ga/SiO2 catalyst prepared by impregnation.

          "A higher activity of monoclinic β-Ga2O3 (the thermodynamically stable gallia polymorph) relative to hexagonal α-Ga2O3 was ascribed to the higher ratio of tetrahedral vs octahedral Ga sites present in bulk β-Ga2O3 (GaIV:GaVI = 1:1), in contrast to the absence of bulk GaIV sites in α-Ga2O3."
          "β-Ga2O3 showing more weak Lewis acid sites compared to γ-Ga2O3."

       <English>
          The article investigates how the coordination geometry of Ga sites affects propane dehydrogenation activity. β-Ga2O3 shows higher activity compared to α-Ga2O3 which is attributed to a higher ratio of tetrahedral GaIV sites in β-Ga2O3 bulk structure. Acidity also plays a role, with β-Ga2O3 showing more weak Lewis acid sites compared to γ-Ga2O3.

          这篇文章研究了Ga位点的配位几何如何影响丙烷脱氢反应活性。与α-Ga2O3相比,β-Ga2O3显示出更高的活性,这被归因于β-Ga2O3的组分结构中四面体GaIV位点的比例更高。酸度也起着作用,β-Ga2O3相比γ-Ga2O3显示出更多弱路易斯酸位点。

          "Tetracoordinated Lewis acidic Ga3+ sites (4,5) were proposed as active sites for PDH on Ga2O3-based catalysts."
          "Pentacoordinated GaV sites are associated with catalyst deactivation."
       </Quotes>
       <English>
          The article proposes that tetracoordinated GaIII sites act as active sites for dehydrogenation, while cracking to light alkanes occurs on different sites. Pentacoordinated GaV sites are associated with catalyst deactivation.

         "The catalytic cracking of propane to ethene and methane (Scheme 1, eq 2) is an undesired side reaction commonly observed on various MOx PDH catalysts, including Ga2O3."
         "The interaction between gallia nanoparticles and the silica support is found to introduce acidity. This results in more cracking and reduced selectivity compared to unsupported catalysts."
