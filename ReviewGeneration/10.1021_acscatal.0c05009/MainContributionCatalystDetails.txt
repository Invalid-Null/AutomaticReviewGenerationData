The document discusses propane dehydrogenation catalysts. β-Ga2O3 is identified as having the highest initial activity among the unsupported gallium oxide catalysts tested. Key details extracted:
- Name: β-Ga2O3 
- Type: Metal oxide
- Composition Elements: Ga, O
- Active Species Element: Ga
- No promoter elements mentioned
- Unsupported (no support material)
- Conversion Rate: 15.4%  
- Selectivity: 86%
- Reaction Temperature: 550°C
- Inlet Flow Rate: 10% C3H8 in N2

Other details like stability, deactivation rates, propane production rate, propylene yield, feed composition ratios, propane partial pressure, catalyst loading/GHSV were not mentioned for β-Ga2O3 specifically and hence not included.
