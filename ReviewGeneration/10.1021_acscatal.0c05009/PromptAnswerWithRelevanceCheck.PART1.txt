Answer: No relevant quotes. The article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:没有相关引用。这篇文章没有评估Cr2O3、Pt-Sn、Ga2O3等有前途的金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。

</Chinese version answer>


<English version answer>
Answer: The article focuses specifically on investigating Ga2O3-based catalysts. It provides detailed characterization data and insights into how the polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-Ga2O3), coordination environments, and acid-base properties affect catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. Key findings include:

- β-Ga2O3 showed higher initial activity than α-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3, attributed to a higher fraction of weak Lewis acid sites associated with undercoordinated Ga3+ sites. 

- Unsupported γ-Ga2O3 had more strong acid sites than β-Ga2O3 based on IR studies with pyridine probe.

- Silica-supported β-Ga2O3/SiO2 and γ-Ga2O3/SiO2 showed higher activity but lower selectivity than their unsupported counterparts, due to the introduction of interfacial Brønsted acid sites.

- Nitrate-derived amorphous Ga/SiO2 showed lower activity but stable performance attributed to its tetracoordinated Ga sites and strong Brønsted acidity.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:这篇文章专门研究了Ga2O3基催化剂。它提供了详细的表征数据和见解,探讨了多晶型(α-、β-、γ-Ga2O3)、配位环境和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢催化性能。 主要发现包括:

- β-Ga2O3的初始活性高于α-Ga2O3和γ-Ga2O3,这是由于它含有更高比例的弱路易斯酸性位点,与低配位的Ga3+位点有关。

- 根据吡啶探针的红外研究,非支撑的γ-Ga2O3具有比β-Ga2O3更强的酸性位点。 

- 支持在二氧化硅上的β-Ga2O3/SiO2和γ-Ga2O3/SiO2与其非支撑对应物相比,显示出更高的活性但更低的选择性,这是由于界面产生了强的勃洛塞德酸性位点。

- 源自硝酸盐的无定形Ga/SiO2显示出更低的活性但稳定的性能,这被归因于其四配位的Ga位点和强的勃洛塞德酸性。

</Chinese version answer>


<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes the following mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3-based catalysts:

- Propane can undergo either a concerted (direct) dehydrogenation or a stepwise dehydrogenation pathway on gallia surfaces. 

- Tricoordinated Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity are proposed as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation to propene. These sites can facilitate the concerted dehydrogenation mechanism.

- Pentacoordinated Ga5+ sites are more likely to follow the stepwise pathway via alkyl intermediates like propyl species. Slow β-hydrogen transfer from these intermediates can lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

- The strong Brønsted acid sites formed at the gallia-silica interface contribute to propane cracking to ethene and methane.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:这篇文章为Ga2O3基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢提出了以下机理场景:

- 丙烷可以在二氧化镓表面上经历协同(直接)脱氢或步骤式脱氢途径。

- 三配位的Ga3+位点因其弱路易斯酸性被提出为丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的活性位点。这些位点可以促进协同脱氢机理。

- 五配位的Ga5+位点更可能遵循通过丙基等烷基中间体的步骤式途径。这些中间体β氢移位的缓慢可以导致焦炭生成和催化剂失活。 

- 在二氧化镓-二氧化硅界面形成的强勃洛塞德酸性位点促进了丙烷裂化生成乙烯和甲烷。

</Chinese version answer>


<English version answer>
Answer: No, the article does not specifically explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on gallium oxide polymorphs and does not investigate other metal oxide systems. The only metal-support interface effects explored are between gallium oxide nanoparticles and a silica support. The key findings are:

- Dispersion of gallium oxide nanoparticles on silica introduced interfacial Brønsted acid sites, leading to higher activity but lower selectivity compared to unsupported gallium oxide. 

- The interfacial Brønsted acid sites contribute to propane cracking to form ethene and methane.

- Amorphous gallium oxide derived from gallium nitrate on silica showed tetracoordinated gallium sites and strong Brønsted acidity leading to stable performance.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:不,这篇文章没有具体探讨金属氧化物催化剂中的金属-支撑体界面效应对于丙烷脱氢的影响。它关注镓氧化物多晶型,没有研究其他金属氧化物体系。所探讨的唯一金属-支撑体界面效应是二氧化镓纳米粒子与二氧化硅支撑体之间的界面。主要发现有:

- 二氧化镓纳米粒子分散在二氧化硅上引入了界面勃洛塞德酸性位点,导致比非支撑二氧化镓具有更高的活性但更低的选择性。

- 界面勃洛塞德酸性位点促进了丙烷裂化生成乙烯和甲烷。

- 源自硝酸镓的无定形二氧化镓分散在二氧化硅上的材料表现出四配位镓位点和强勃洛塞德酸性,导致稳定的催化性能。

1. The article does not evaluate any of the mentioned metal oxide catalysts. It focuses solely on Ga2O3 based catalysts.

2. The article investigates how properties like oxidation states, coordination numbers, and acid-base properties of Ga2O3 affect propane dehydrogenation performance. For example, it shows β-Ga2O3 is more active than γ-Ga2O3 and α-Ga2O3 due to a higher fraction of weak Lewis acid sites.

3. The article proposes a concerted dehydrogenation mechanism on tricoordinated Ga sites and a stepwise pathway via alkyl intermediates on pentacoordinated Ga sites. The latter can lead to coking and deactivation.

4. The article explores metal-support interactions between Ga2O3 nanoparticles and a SiO2 support. It shows this induces mild Brønsted acidity, lowering selectivity vs unsupported Ga2O3.

1. "supported gallium oxide catalysts are typically prepared by impregnation of precursor salts such as gallium nitrate on a support followed by a calcination that gives an amorphous supported gallia phase."  

2. The paper evaluates the performance of Ga2O3 polymorphs including α-Ga2O3, β-Ga2O3, and γ-Ga2O3 as well as silica-supported β-Ga2O3/SiO2 and γ-Ga2O3/SiO2 in propane dehydrogenation.

3. "A higher activity of monoclinic β-Ga2O3 (the thermodynamically stable gallia polymorph) relative to hexagonal α-Ga2O3 was ascribed to the higher ratio of tetrahedral vs octahedral Ga sites present in bulk β-Ga2O3 (GaIV:GaVI = 1:1), in contrast to the absence of bulk GaIV sites in α-Ga2O3."

4. "The catalytic cracking of propane to ethene and methane (Scheme 1, eq 2) is an undesired side reaction commonly observed on various MOx PDH catalysts, including Ga2O3."

5. "Tetracoordinated Lewis acidic Ga3+ sites (4,5) were proposed as active sites for PDH on Ga2O3-based catalysts."

1. The article evaluates the performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs including α-Ga2O3, �-Ga2O3, and γ-Ga2O3 as nanocrystalline unsupported catalysts as well as silica-supported β-Ga2O3/SiO2 and γ-Ga2O3/SiO2 in propane dehydrogenation. It also studies a benchmark amorphous Ga/SiO2 catalyst prepared by impregnation.

2. The article investigates how the coordination geometry of Ga sites affects propane dehydrogenation activity. β-Ga2O3 shows higher activity compared to α-Ga2O3 which is attributed to a higher ratio of tetrahedral GaIV sites in β-Ga2O3 bulk structure. Acidity also plays a role, with β-Ga2O3 showing more weak Lewis acid sites compared to γ-Ga2O3.

3. The article proposes that tetracoordinated GaIII sites act as active sites for dehydrogenation, while cracking to light alkanes occurs on different sites. Pentacoordinated GaV sites are associated with catalyst deactivation.

4. The interaction between gallia nanoparticles and the silica support is found to introduce acidity. This results in more cracking and reduced selectivity compared to unsupported catalysts.

5-8. The article does not evaluate supported mono-metallic catalysts.

1. 这篇文章评估了不同的Ga2O3多晶体的性能,包括α-Ga2O3、β-Ga2O3和 γ-Ga2O3,以纳米结晶无载体催化剂的形式,以及硅胶支持的β-Ga2O3/SiO2和γ-Ga2O3/SiO2。它还研究了一种通过浸渍法制备的无定型Ga/SiO2基准催化剂。

2. 这篇文章研究了Ga位点的配位几何如何影响丙烷脱氢反应活性。与α-Ga2O3相比,β-Ga2O3显示出更高的活性,这被归因于β-Ga2O3的组分结构中四面体GaIV位点的比例更高。酸度也起着作用,β-Ga2O3相比γ-Ga2O3显示出更多弱路易斯酸位点。

3. 这篇文章提出四配位的GaIII位点起催化剂脱氢作用,而裂化生成轻烷发生在不同的位点上。五配位的GaV位点与催化剂失活有关。

4. 镓氧化物纳米粒子与硅胶载体的相互作用引入了酸位点。这导致裂化反应增加,选择性降低,与无载体催化剂相比。

5-8. 这篇文章没有评估单金属受支持催化剂。
