 Unfortunately, the provided answers do not contain relevant information to address the questions asked. As the answers indicate, the article focuses solely on fundamental characterization and evaluation of gallium oxide-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, without discussing process intensification approaches, techno-economic factors, safety considerations, remaining challenges, computational techniques, advanced characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures. 

Since the answers are not relevant to the questions, I will provide the designated response:
