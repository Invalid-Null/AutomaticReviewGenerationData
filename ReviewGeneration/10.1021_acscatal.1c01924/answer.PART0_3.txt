Propylene is one of the most important chemicals produced by the chemical industry with a current annual production exceeding 100 million tons.
Propene is a key building block in the petrochemical industry for plastics synthesis.
The need for propylene is projected to grow further by 45% until 2030, with most of the additional required propylene to be produced through propane dehydrogenation (PDH). 
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene represents an attractive route for onpurpose propylene generation.
However, this equilibriumlimited endothermic reaction requires elevated temperatures of 500–600 °C to achieve sufficient conversion levels

1. The article provides background that propylene production through propane dehydrogenation is very important, as propylene is a key building block for plastics synthesis. Current annual production exceeds 100 million tons, and demand is projected to grow 45% by 2030. PDH is an attractive route for on-purpose propylene generation, but its endothermic equilibrium-limited nature requires high temperatures of 500-600°C.
