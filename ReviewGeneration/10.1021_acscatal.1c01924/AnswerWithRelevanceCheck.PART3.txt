         [1] "The GaPt-SCALMS catalysts were prepared with a targeted Ga/Pt ratio &gt;40 to ensure a fully liquid system under the applied reaction conditions." 

         [2] "In order to determine potential effects of the new SCALMS preparation route on the catalytic performance, we first compared the performance of Ga49Pt-SCALMS on Al2O3 prepared by the traditional chemical route with the same composition prepared by our new ultrasonification method."

         [3] "Using this ultrasonication method, GaPt SCALMS catalyst were synthesized on three different supports (alumina, silica, SiC) and tested for propane dehydrogenation in the temperature range of 500600 C."

         [1] "Scanning electron microscopy was applied to characterize the morphology of all catalysts prepared (Figure 3). The images reveal differences induced by the applied support materials."

         [2] "The distribution of gallium and platinum was further analyzed by SEM-EDX (Figure 4). As platinum is introduced to the materials by galvanic displacement, most of it is expected to be found at the gallium droplets. EDX mapping of the metals for the freshly prepared catalysts (Figure 4) as well as for the spent catalyst (see Figure S8, Supporting Information) shows indeed this colocation of Ga and Pt on the surface of the alloy droplets or crystallites for all materials." 

         [3] "After propane dehydrogenation, we selected the spent SiO2-supported SCALMS systems for further analytical studies to shed light on the deactivation mechanism during PDH. Because of its smooth surface, the SiO2-supported system would allow for easily recognizable agglomeration phenomena that might be responsible for the observed loss of activity. In our SEM investigation, however, it was found that the droplet size distribution of the catalytic materials did not undergo major changes and was very similar for all the catalysts after PDH at all the temperature tested when compared to the fresh SCALMS system (Figure 10ac)."

         Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like SEM and SEM-EDX to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses SEM to study morphology changes induced by different supports, and SEM-EDX to analyze distribution of Ga and Pt in fresh and spent catalysts. SEM is also used to investigate deactivation by examining droplet size changes after reaction.
