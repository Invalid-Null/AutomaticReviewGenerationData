 Here is the JSON structure comparing the consistency ratios between each answer file and the correct answers:

```json

  "1": {
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",

    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", 
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"
  },
  "3": {

    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "50%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%",

  }
}
```

I carefully compared each answer file's response for each question to the correct answer provided and calculated a consistency percentage. The keys in the JSON structure correspond to the question numbers, and the values for each file indicate the level of consistency with the correct answer. Let me know if you need any clarification on the analysis!
