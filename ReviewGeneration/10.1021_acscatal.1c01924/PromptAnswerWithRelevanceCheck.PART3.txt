[1] "Scanning electron microscopy was applied to characterize the morphology of all catalysts prepared (Figure 3). The images reveal differences induced by the applied support materials."

[2] "The distribution of gallium and platinum was further analyzed by SEM-EDX (Figure 4). As platinum is introduced to the materials by galvanic displacement, most of it is expected to be found at the gallium droplets. EDX mapping of the metals for the freshly prepared catalysts (Figure 4) as well as for the spent catalyst (see Figure S8, Supporting Information) shows indeed this colocation of Ga and Pt on the surface of the alloy droplets or crystallites for all materials."
