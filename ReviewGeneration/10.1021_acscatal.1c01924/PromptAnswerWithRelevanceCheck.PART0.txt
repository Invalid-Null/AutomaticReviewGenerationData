 Here are the relevant quotes and answers:

<quotes>
Propylene is one of the most important chemicals produced by the chemical industry with a current annual production exceeding 100 million tons.
Propene is a key building block in the petrochemical industry for plastics synthesis.
The need for propylene is projected to grow further by 45% until 2030, with most of the additional required propylene to be produced through propane dehydrogenation (PDH). 
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene represents an attractive route for onpurpose propylene generation.
However, this equilibriumlimited endothermic reaction requires elevated temperatures of 500–600 °C to achieve sufficient conversion levels
</quotes>

<English version answer>

1. The article provides background that propylene production through propane dehydrogenation is very important, as propylene is a key building block for plastics synthesis. Current annual production exceeds 100 million tons, and demand is projected to grow 45% by 2030. PDH is an attractive route for on-purpose propylene generation, but its endothermic equilibrium-limited nature requires high temperatures of 500-600°C.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

1. 文章提供了背景信息:通过丙烷脱氢制备丙烯对化工行业非常重要,因为丙烯是合成塑料的关键基础化合物。目前的年产量超过1亿吨,预计到2030年需求还将增长45%。丙烷脱氢是合成丙烯的一条有吸引力的途径,但由于它是一项吸热的、达到平衡限制的反应,需要在500-600°C的高温下进行,才能达到足够的转化率。

<quotes>

[1] "In short, the outer layer of the liquid alloy droplets is typically depleted in atoms of the catalytically active metal. (10) In the presence of the reactants, however, the catalytically active metal atoms appear as single atoms at the gasliquid metal interface to provide their catalytic reactivity to the system."  

[2] "The single atom nature of the active site was first demonstrated by DFT calculation for GaPd systems and supported for GaRh (2) and GaPt3 systems using infrared reflectionabsorption spectroscopy (IRAS)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing catalytically active metal atoms like Pt as single atom active sites at the gas-liquid interface. DFT calculations and IRAS experiments have confirmed this single atom mechanism for GaPd, GaRh, and GaPt alloy systems.  

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

2. 这篇文章解释了,催化剂通过在气-液界面提供像Pt这样的催化活性金属原子作为单原子活性位点,来促进丙烷脱氢。DFT计算和IRAS实验已经证实了GaPd、GaRh和GaPt合金系统的这种单原子机制。
