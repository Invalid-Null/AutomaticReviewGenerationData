[1] "The formation of carbon-containing species was studied during propane dehydrogenation on a chromia/alumina catalyst with 13.5 wt% chromium. The deposition was monitored by in situ DRIFT spectroscopy combined with mass spectrometry, and by in situ Raman spectroscopy combined with gas chromatography."

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation was investigated by in situ spectroscopic methods."  

[3] "The DRIFTS measurements were performed with a Nicolet Nexus FTIR spectrometer and a Spectra-Tech high-temperature/high-pressure chamber. The gaseous products were monitored on-line with a Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar mass spectrometer."

[4] "The Raman spectra were measured with a Renishaw Micro-Raman System-1000 equipped with a cooled CCD detector and a holographic super-Notch filter for removing the elastic scattering. An Ar+ laser (514 nm) was used as the exciting source. The experiments were performed in a homemade quartz reaction cell."

[1] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements indicated that the catalyst contained Cr3+ and Cr6+ after oxidation, and mainly Cr3+ after reduction with hydrogen or alkane (butane)"

[2] "Although spectra were measured after every 25C rise in temperature, only the spectra obtained after the sample cell was flushed with nitrogen are shown. Thus the strong CH stretching band of gas-phase propane does not dominate the CH area, allowing the changes between 3100 and 2800 cm1 to be observed."

[3] "Chromate overtones were not seen above about 300C, and above 450C the amounts of hydrogen and propene detected by MS increased. Therefore, the catalyst was reduced before dehydrogenation started."
