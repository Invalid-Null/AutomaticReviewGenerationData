[1] "The chromia/alumina catalyst used in the study was prepared by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique, in which the precursor of the metal oxide is deposited on the support from the gas phase through saturating gassolid reactions, as described in detail elsewhere [3], [8]."

[2] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements indicated that the catalyst contained Cr3+ and Cr6+ after oxidation, and mainly Cr3+ after reduction with hydrogen or alkane (butane); the treatments were done in a reactor connected directly to the spectrometer system, permitting sample transfer in vacuum."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses atomic layer deposition to deposit chromium oxide on the alumina support, resulting in high dispersion without crystalline Cr2O3 detected. XPS shows the chromium is present as Cr3+ and Cr6+ after oxidation and mainly Cr3+ after reduction.

答:是的,文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它使用原子层沉积将铬氧化物沉积在氧化铝载体上,从而获得高分散度,没有检测到结晶Cr2O3。 X射线光电子能谱显示铬在氧化后以Cr3+和Cr6+存在,在还原后主要以Cr3+存在。

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation was investigated by in situ spectroscopic methods. The reduction of Cr6+, present as chromates, and the formation of hydroxyl and carbon-containing species were studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) combined with mass spectrometry (MS)."  

[2] "The Raman spectra were measured with a Renishaw Micro-Raman System-1000 equipped with a cooled CCD detector and a holographic super-Notch filter for removing the elastic scattering. An Ar+ laser (514 nm) was used as the exciting source."

[3] "The experiments were performed in a homemade quartz reaction cell. The catalyst (0.2 g) was loaded between two layers of silicon carbide and was kept in place with quartz wool plugs at both ends of the reactor. In this way, there was no void volume in the reactor. The reaction products were analysed with a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector."

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses in-situ DRIFTS combined with MS to study chromate reduction and carbon species formation. It also uses in-situ Raman spectroscopy combined with GC to study chromate reduction and carbon deposition over time during propane dehydrogenation. A homemade quartz cell reactor connected to GC analysis is used.

[1] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements indicated that the catalyst contained Cr3+ and Cr6+ after oxidation, and mainly Cr3+ after reduction with hydrogen or alkane (butane); the treatments were done in a reactor connected directly to the spectrometer system, permitting sample transfer in vacuum."

[2] "Although spectra were measured after every 25C rise in temperature, only the spectra obtained after the sample cell was flushed with nitrogen are shown. Thus the strong CH stretching band of gas-phase propane does not dominate the CH area, allowing the changes between 3100 and 2800 cm1 to be observed."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based XPS techniques to probe oxidation state changes of chromium during pretreatments and propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows the catalyst contains Cr3+, Cr6+ after oxidation but mainly Cr3+ after reduction with H2 or butane. It also uses in-situ DRIFTS to monitor changes in CH stretches during temperature programmed reactions.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章使用基于X射线的XPS技术来探测铬在预处理和丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。它显示氧化后的催化剂含有Cr3+、Cr6+,但在H2或丁烷还原后主要含有Cr3+。它还使用现场DRIFTS监测温度程序反应过程中CH伸缩的变化。
