[1] "The chromia/alumina catalyst used in the study was prepared by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique, in which the precursor of the metal oxide is deposited on the support from the gas phase through saturating gassolid reactions, as described in detail elsewhere [3], [8]."

[2] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements indicated that the catalyst contained Cr3+ and Cr6+ after oxidation, and mainly Cr3+ after reduction with hydrogen or alkane (butane); the treatments were done in a reactor connected directly to the spectrometer system, permitting sample transfer in vacuum."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses atomic layer deposition (ALD) to prepare the chromia/alumina catalyst, which helps disperse the chromia phase well on the alumina support. XPS data show the oxidation state changes before and after reduction treatments.

[1] "The deposition was monitored by in situ DRIFT spectroscopy combined with mass spectrometry, and by in situ Raman spectroscopy combined with gas chromatography."

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation was investigated by in situ spectroscopic methods. The reduction of Cr6+, present as chromates, and the formation of hydroxyl and carbon-containing species were studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). In situ Raman spectroscopy was used to study further the reduction of chromates and the formation of carbon-containing deposits."
