[1] "The Oleflex process employs fluidized bed reactors with Pt-based catalysts, with propane conversion and propylene selectivity of 3040% and 85.588%, respectively."[8, 9]

[2] "Compared with other catalysts, Pt-based catalysts show the highest turnover frequency (TOF) in PDH (Table 1). TOF normalized by Pt, or TOFPt, varies substantially with the support, the alloying metal, and the catalyst preparation method."

[3] "Addition of a second metal to form bimetallic (intermetallic PtM, PtM alloy, or PtMOx clusters, M = metal) catalysts, such as PtSn,[32-34] PtGa,[35-38] PtZn,[30, 39-41] PtCu,[42], and PtCo,[43] can reduce the particle size of Pt, thereby improving the catalytic activity and inhibiting coke formation."

1. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on the Pt-based Oleflex process, which uses fluidized bed reactors with Pt catalysts and achieves 30-40% propane conversion and 85.5-88% propylene selectivity. The article also notes Pt-based catalysts show the highest turnover frequencies compared to other PDH catalysts. Bimetallic Pt catalysts like PtSn, PtGa, PtZn, PtCu, and PtCo are explored as a way to improve Pt's activity and selectivity.

[1] "The most accepted mechanism for Pt-based catalysts is the HoriutiPolanyi mechanismfirst proposed in 1934involving: i) cleavage of the first CH bond in C3H8; ii) activation of the second CH bond in C3H7; iii) formation of a dihydrogen molecule; iv) desorption of hydrogen and propylene." 

[2] "The first CH cleavage is considered the RDS."

3. Yes, the article proposes a Horiuti-Polanyi mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over Pt-based catalysts. This involves cleavage of the first CH bond in propane, activation of the second CH bond, formation of H2, and desorption of propylene. The first CH cleavage is considered the rate-determining step.
