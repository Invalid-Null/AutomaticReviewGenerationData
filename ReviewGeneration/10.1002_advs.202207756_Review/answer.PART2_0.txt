[1] "Pt-based catalysts exhibit superior ability in activating CH bonds in alkanes and low activity for CC cracking and coke formation. Compared with other catalysts, Pt-based catalysts show the highest turnover frequency (TOF) in PDH (Table 1). TOF normalized by Pt, or TOFPt, varies substantially with the support, the alloying metal, and the catalyst preparation method. The best-reported TOFPt is more than 1000 times higher than that of TOFCr (Table 1)."

[2] "Addition of a second metal to form bimetallic (intermetallic PtM, PtM alloy, or PtMOx clusters, M = metal) catalysts, such as PtSn,[32-34] PtGa,[35-38] PtZn,[30, 39-41] PtCu,[42], and PtCo,[43] can reduce the particle size of Pt, thereby improving the catalytic activity and inhibiting coke formation."

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn, Pt-Ga, Pt-Zn, Pt-Cu, and Pt-Co for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt-based catalysts have much higher turnover frequencies compared to Cr-based catalysts. It also explains that adding a second metal can improve catalytic activity and inhibit coke formation by reducing the Pt particle size.

<quotes> 
[1] “Ga3+ and Zn2+ exchanged in zeolites are isoelectronic and could play a role in their similarity in speciation when exchanged into zeolite pores and PDH activity.”

[2] “Metal cation exchanged zeolites (Ga/H-ZSM-5, Zn/H-ZSM-5, Co/H-ZSM-5) are efficient catalysts for PDH with 90% propylene selectivity.”
</quotes>

<English version answer>
6. Yes, the article evaluates zeolite supports like H-ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It notes that Ga, Zn, and Co exchanged H-ZSM-5 are efficient PDH catalysts with 90% propylene selectivity. It also suggests similarities between Ga and Zn speciation and PDH activity when exchanged into zeolites due to their isolectronic nature.
