<Answer>

 Unfortunately this literature review does not directly discuss process intensification approaches, techno-economic factors, safety issues, remaining challenges and knowledge gaps, computational catalyst screening methods, or needs for improved characterization tools for propane dehydrogenation. The review is focused on summarizing the current understanding of catalyst active site structures and reaction mechanisms.

However, the review does highlight some remaining challenges and future research directions for propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it notes that side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, and coke formation can occur at higher propane conversions and lead to catalyst deactivation. It suggests exploring zeolite catalysts with hierarchical pore structures or nanosheet morphologies to improve mass transport and stability. It also proposes combining computational modeling with experiments to help identify the structures of active sites in metal-exchanged zeolite catalysts.
