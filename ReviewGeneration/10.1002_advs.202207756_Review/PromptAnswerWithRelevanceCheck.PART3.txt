[1] Metal-exchanged zeolites are well-known propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts; however, the structure of the active species remains unresolved. 

[2] Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are commonly prepared by impregnating a Ga salt, for example, Ga(NO3)3, on the H-ZSM-5 support, followed by calcination in the air. 

[3] Spectral assignments were made based on the distinct Ga K edge energies for these species, though later results showed that the edge energy could not be treated as diagnostic information regarding the Ga species at different oxidation states.

[4] It was found that In(0), formed during the reaction, was the cause of catalyst deactivation.

[5] They applied organic and inorganic structure-directing agents to tune the Al distribution in CHA and MFI zeolites, which offers a viable path to optimize the PDH activity of Ga/H-ZSM-5.

[6] Reducing the diffusion length of propane and propylene from the active Ga species could also enhance PDH activity. Wannapakdee et al. prepared Ga/H-ZSM-5 nanosheets, and found that the propane conversion is three times higher than that of conventional zeolites.
