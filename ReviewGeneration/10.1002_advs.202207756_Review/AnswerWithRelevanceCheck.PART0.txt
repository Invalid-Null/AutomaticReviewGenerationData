      [1] Propylene is one of the main feedstocks in the chemical industry, used in the production of a great number of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene.

      [2] The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030, laying bare a growing gap between the supply and demand of propylene.

      [3] The rapid increase in shale gas production with its substantial content of natural gas liquids and thus propane has led to increased interest in PDH: it currently accounts for 10% of global propylene production.

      Yes, the article provides background on the importance of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation. It states that propylene is a key chemical feedstock used to produce polymers, chemicals, and plastics (quote 1). There is increasing demand for propylene, currently 130 megatons annually, expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030. Propylene is mainly produced as a byproduct from naphtha cracking, but propane dehydrogenation is an alternative route that accounts for 10% of production (quotes 2-3).

      [1] To achieve significant propylene yields, PDH typically operates at 550-700 C. Common side reactions include CC bond cleavage via cracking and hydrogenolysis.

      [2] Metal cation exchanged zeolites are efficient catalysts for PDH with 90% propylene selectivity. As shown in Figure 2, metal cations exchanged zeolites are prepared by replacing Brønsted acid sites (BAS) with metal cations via ion-exchange. Metal cations entering zeolite matrices via ion exchange (IE) generally exhibit Lewis acidity, and are generally believed to be responsible for catalyzing alkane dehydrogenation.

      Yes, the article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering energy barriers. It states that propane dehydrogenation typically operates at 550-700°C to achieve good yields, but side reactions can occur (quote 1). The article describes how metal-exchanged zeolites replace Brønsted acid sites with metal cations via ion exchange, introducing Lewis acidity that catalyzes dehydrogenation (quote 2).

      [1] Pt-based catalysts exhibit superior ability in activating C-H bonds in alkanes and low activity for C-C cracking and coke formation.

      [2] CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts deactivate quickly due to coke formation and aggregation of Cr3+ species.

      [3] Ga- and Zn- based catalysts show moderate levels of catalytic activity with high propylene selectivity.

    <English>
      Yes, the article introduces major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation. It states Pt-based catalysts activate C-H bonds with low cracking (quote 1). It also describes CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts that deactivate from coking (quote 2), and Ga- and Zn-based zeolite catalysts with good selectivity (quote 3).

      [1] PDH can be broadly grouped into two categories: non-oxidative and oxidative. In non-oxidative PDH, propane is catalytically dehydrogenated to produce stoichiometric amounts of propylene and hydrogen. It is endothermic (ΔH298Kθ = 124.3 kJ mol−1) and a volume-increasing reaction (C3H8 → C3H6 + H2), and thus is favored at high temperature and low pressure.

      [2] Oxidants, usually O2, can be co-fed with propane to enhance the thermodynamic driving force in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process. This process is exothermic (ΔH298Kθ = 117 kJ mol−1) and thus the conversion of propane is no longer limited by thermodynamics.

      [3] CO2-assisted ODHP (CO2-ODHP, C3H8 + CO2 → C3H6 + CO + H2O) could, in theory, improve the thermodynamics of PDH. CO2 has two advantages: i) consumes H2 through the reverse water-gas-shift reaction (RWGS: CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) increasing the equilibrium conversion of propane; ii) CO2 can remove coke via the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C → 2CO).

      Yes, the article discusses the thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors in propane dehydrogenation. It describes non-oxidative PDH as endothermic and favored by high temperature and low pressure (quote 1). It explains how oxidative PDH with O2 or CO2 co-feeds can improve thermodynamic conversion by providing exothermic oxidation reactions (quotes 2-3).
