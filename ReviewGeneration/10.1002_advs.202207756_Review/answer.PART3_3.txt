<quotes>
[1] "In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) could be conducted in situ or operando, and thus is well suited for determining the Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions."

[2] "Hensen and co-workers applied DRIFTS to investigate the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 and reported the first definitive spectral evidence of Ga hydrides on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5."

[3] "Bell and co-workers recognized the importance of the framework Al distribution in PDH more explicitly."

[4] "Yuan et al. investigated Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with three Si/Al ratios of the zeolite support, that is, 15, 28, and 39, and each in a wide range of Ga loadings." 

[5] "Quantitative pulse titration results on Ga supported on Co-exchanged H-ZSM-5 (Ga/Co-ZSM-5 (15, Y)), in which all framework Al pairs were occupied by Co2+, were similar to those on Ga/H-ZSM (15, Y) except for a key feature."

4. The article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, DRIFTS, and quantitative pulse titration to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. These techniques provided insights into the Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 under reaction conditions, the presence of Ga hydrides, the importance of framework Al distribution, and the identification of Ga2O2^2+ as the most active species.

[1] "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) could be conducted in situ or operando, and thus is well suited for determining the Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions." 

[2] "In situ XAS investigations provided crucial information regarding how Ga species migrate into the zeolite pore upon reduction."

[3] "Pulse titration results on Ga supported on Co-exchanged H-ZSM-5 (Ga/Co-ZSM-5 (15, Y)) showed that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species."
</quotes>

6. The article uses in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and quantitative pulse titration to probe oxidation state changes of Ga species during propane dehydrogenation on Ga/H-ZSM-5. These techniques revealed how Ga species migrate into the zeolite pores upon reduction and identified the divalent cation Ga2O2^2+ as the precursor to the active GaHx species.
