22. Yes, the article discusses several methods for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. These include vapor-phase ion exchange of H+ with metal chlorides like GaCl3 (Quote 5), and controlling framework Al distribution to stabilize isolated metal sites (Quote 3). Examples given are for Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

23. No, the article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing catalyst stability.

24. No, the article does not investigate catalyst preparation methods aimed specifically at optimizing active phase dispersion. 

25. Yes, the article utilizes several in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts, including in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), infrared spectroscopy, temperature programmed reduction, and pulse titrations to probe metal speciation and oxidation states under reaction conditions (Quotes 1-2).

26. No, the article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces.

27. Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy to probe oxidation state changes of gallium during propane dehydrogenation on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts (Quote 2).

28. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.
