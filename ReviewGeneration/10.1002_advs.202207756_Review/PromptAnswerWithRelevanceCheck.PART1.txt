[1] "The Oleflex process employs fluidized bed reactors with Pt-based catalysts, with propane conversion and propylene selectivity of 3040% and 85.588%, respectively."[8, 9]

[2] "Compared with other catalysts, Pt-based catalysts show the highest turnover frequency (TOF) in PDH (Table 1). TOF normalized by Pt, or TOFPt, varies substantially with the support, the alloying metal, and the catalyst preparation method."

[3] "Addition of a second metal to form bimetallic (intermetallic PtM, PtM alloy, or PtMOx clusters, M = metal) catalysts, such as PtSn,[32-34] PtGa,[35-38] PtZn,[30, 39-41] PtCu,[42], and PtCo,[43] can reduce the particle size of Pt, thereby improving the catalytic activity and inhibiting coke formation."

<English version answer>

1. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on the Pt-based Oleflex process, which uses fluidized bed reactors with Pt catalysts and achieves 30-40% propane conversion and 85.5-88% propylene selectivity. The article also notes Pt-based catalysts show the highest turnover frequencies compared to other PDH catalysts. Bimetallic Pt catalysts like PtSn, PtGa, PtZn, PtCu, and PtCo are explored as a way to improve Pt's activity and selectivity.

1. The article evaluates Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. 

[1] "Pt-based catalysts exhibit superior ability in activating CH bonds in alkanes and low activity for CC cracking and coke formation. Compared with other catalysts, Pt-based catalysts show the highest turnover frequency (TOF) in PDH (Table 1). TOF normalized by Pt, or TOFPt, varies substantially with the support, the alloying metal, and the catalyst preparation method. The best-reported TOFPt is more than 1000 times higher than that of TOFCr (Table 1)."

[2] "Addition of a second metal to form bimetallic (intermetallic PtM, PtM alloy, or PtMOx clusters, M = metal) catalysts, such as PtSn,[32-34] PtGa,[35-38] PtZn,[30, 39-41] PtCu,[42], and PtCo,[43] can reduce the particle size of Pt, thereby improving the catalytic activity and inhibiting coke formation."
