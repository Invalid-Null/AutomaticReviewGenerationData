 Here are the relevant quotes and answers:

<quotes>

1. Propylene is one of the main feedstocks in the chemical industry, used in the production of a great number of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene.[1] 

2. Metal-exchanged zeolites are well-known propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts; however, the structure of the active species remains unresolved.

3. Pt-based catalysts exhibit superior ability in activating CH bonds in alkanes and low activity for CC cracking and coke formation. Compared with other catalysts, Pt-based catalysts show the highest turnover frequency (TOF) in PDH.

4. PDH can be broadly grouped into two categories: non-oxidative and oxidative. In non-oxidative PDH, propane is catalytically dehydrogenated to produce stoichiometric amounts of propylene and hydrogen. It is endothermic (ΔH298Kθ = 124.3 kJ mol1) and a volume-increasing reaction (C3H8 → C3H6 + H2), and thus is favored at high temperature and low pressure.[8,9]

 <quotes>

[1] Propylene is one of the main feedstocks in the chemical industry, used in the production of a great number of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene.

[2] Propylene is primarily a by-product of steam cracking (SC) and the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha. In 2015, SC and FCC combined accounted for 81% of global propylene production capacity. 

[3] The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030, laying bare a growing gap between the supply and demand of propylene.

[4] In addition to SC and FCC, several on-purpose propylene technologies have been developed to increase propylene production including propane dehydrogenation (PDH), olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propylene. The rapid increase in shale gas production with its substantial content of natural gas liquids and thus propane has led to increased interest in PDH: it currently accounts for 10% of global propylene production.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

1. Yes, the article provides background on the importance of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation, stating that propylene is a key chemical feedstock used to produce polymers, chemicals, and plastics (quotes 1-2). There is increasing demand for propylene, currently 130 megatons annually, expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030. Propylene is mainly produced as a byproduct from naphtha cracking, but propane dehydrogenation is an alternative route that accounts for 10% of production (quotes 3-4).

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

1. 是的,这篇文章提供了丙烯通过丙烷脱氢生产的重要背景,指出丙烯是一种关键的化学原料,用于生产聚合物、化学品和塑料(引用1-2)。丙烯的需求量正在增加,目前每年为1.3亿吨,预计到2030年将达到1.91亿吨。丙烯主要作为轻质烃裂解的副产品生产出来,但丙烷脱氢是一种替代途径,占生产量的10%(引用3-4)。

[1] To achieve significant propylene yields, PDH typically operates at 550-700 C. Common side reactions include CC bond cleavage via cracking and hydrogenolysis.

[2] Metal cation exchanged zeolites are efficient catalysts for PDH with 90% propylene selectivity. As shown in Figure 2, metal cations exchanged zeolites are prepared by replacing Brønsted acid sites (BAS) with metal cations via ion-exchange. Metal cations entering zeolite matrices via ion exchange (IE) generally exhibit Lewis acidity, and are generally believed to be responsible for catalyzing alkane dehydrogenation.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering energy barriers. It states that propane dehydrogenation typically operates at 550-700°C to achieve good yields, but side reactions can occur (quote 1). The article describes how metal-exchanged zeolites replace Brønsted acid sites with metal cations via ion exchange, introducing Lewis acidity that catalyzes dehydrogenation (quote 2).

[1] Pt-based catalysts exhibit superior ability in activating C-H bonds in alkanes and low activity for C-C cracking and coke formation.

[2] CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts deactivate quickly due to coke formation and aggregation of Cr3+ species. 

[3] Ga- and Zn- based catalysts show moderate levels of catalytic activity with high propylene selectivity.

3. Yes, the article introduces major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation. It states Pt-based catalysts activate C-H bonds with low cracking (quote 1). It also describes CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts that deactivate from coking (quote 2), and Ga- and Zn-based zeolite catalysts with good selectivity (quote 3).

[1] PDH can be broadly grouped into two categories: non-oxidative and oxidative. In non-oxidative PDH, propane is catalytically dehydrogenated to produce stoichiometric amounts of propylene and hydrogen. It is endothermic (ΔH298Kθ = 124.3 kJ mol−1) and a volume-increasing reaction (C3H8 → C3H6 + H2), and thus is favored at high temperature and low pressure.

[2] Oxidants, usually O2, can be co-fed with propane to enhance the thermodynamic driving force in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process. This process is exothermic (ΔH298Kθ = 117 kJ mol−1) and thus the conversion of propane is no longer limited by thermodynamics. 

[3] CO2-assisted ODHP (CO2-ODHP, C3H8 + CO2 → C3H6 + CO + H2O) could, in theory, improve the thermodynamics of PDH. CO2 has two advantages: i) consumes H2 through the reverse water-gas-shift reaction (RWGS: CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) increasing the equilibrium conversion of propane; ii) CO2 can remove coke via the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C → 2CO).

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. Yes, the article discusses the thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors in propane dehydrogenation. It describes non-oxidative PDH as endothermic and favored by high temperature and low pressure (quote 1). It explains how oxidative PDH with O2 or CO2 co-feeds can improve thermodynamic conversion by providing exothermic oxidation reactions (quotes 2-3).
