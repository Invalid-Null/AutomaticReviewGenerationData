<quotes>
[1] "Metal-exchanged zeolites are well-known propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts; however, the structure of the active species remains unresolved."

[2] "In this review, existing PDH catalysts are first surveyed, and then the current understanding of metal-exchanged zeolite catalysts is described in detail."

[3] "The case of Ga/H-ZSM-5 is employed to showcase that advances in the understanding of structureactivity relations are often accompanied by technological or conceptional breakthroughs."  

[4] "The understanding of Ga speciation at PDH conditions has evolved owing to the advent of in situ/operando characterizations and to the realization that the local coordination environment of Ga species afforded by the zeolite support has a decisive impact on the active site structure."

[5] "In situ/operando quantitative characterization of catalysts, rigorous determination of intrinsic reaction rates, and predictive computational modeling are all significant in identifying the most active structure in these complex systems."

6. The article evaluates metal-exchanged zeolites like Ga/H-ZSM-5 as propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides an overview of existing PDH catalysts, and focuses on recent advances in understanding the active site structure in Ga/H-ZSM-5 specifically enabled by in situ characterization and consideration of the zeolite framework.
