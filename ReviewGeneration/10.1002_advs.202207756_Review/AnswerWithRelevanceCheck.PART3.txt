         [1] "Metal-exchanged zeolites are well-known propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts; however, the structure of the active species remains unresolved. In this review, existing PDH catalysts are first surveyed..."

         [2] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared via vapor-phase exchange of H+ with GaCl3 at 205 C, followed by H2 reduction at 550 C to remove Cl ligands."

         [3] "They applied organic and inorganic structure-directing agents to tune the Al distribution in CHA and MFI zeolites, which offers a viable path to optimize the PDH activity of Ga/H-ZSM-5."

      <English>
         Yes, the article discusses several methods for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. These include vapor-phase ion exchange of H+ with metal chlorides like GaCl3 (Quote 2), and controlling framework Al distribution to stabilize isolated metal sites (Quote 3). Examples given are for Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.
