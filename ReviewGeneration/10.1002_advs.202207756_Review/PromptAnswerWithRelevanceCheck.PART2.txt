1. The literature review does not compare metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
1. 文献综述没有比较金属与氧化支持金属催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的选择性。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "Pt-based catalysts exhibit superior ability in activating CH bonds in alkanes and low activity for CC cracking and coke formation. Compared with other catalysts, Pt-based catalysts show the highest turnover frequency (TOF) in PDH (Table 1). TOF normalized by Pt, or TOFPt, varies substantially with the support, the alloying metal, and the catalyst preparation method. The best-reported TOFPt is more than 1000 times higher than that of TOFCr (Table 1)."

[2] "Addition of a second metal to form bimetallic (intermetallic PtM, PtM alloy, or PtMOx clusters, M = metal) catalysts, such as PtSn,[32-34] PtGa,[35-38] PtZn,[30, 39-41] PtCu,[42], and PtCo,[43] can reduce the particle size of Pt, thereby improving the catalytic activity and inhibiting coke formation."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn, Pt-Ga, Pt-Zn, Pt-Cu, and Pt-Co for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt-based catalysts have much higher turnover frequencies compared to Cr-based catalysts. It also explains that adding a second metal can improve catalytic activity and inhibit coke formation by reducing the Pt particle size.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
2. 是的,文献评估了Pt合金催化剂,如Pt-Sn、Pt-Ga、Pt-Zn、Pt-Cu和Pt-Co用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供了数据表明,与Cr基催化剂相比,Pt基催化剂具有更高的周转频率。它还解释说,添加第二种金属可以通过减小Pt粒径来提高催化活性并抑制焦炭形成。

It notes that Ga, Zn, and Co exchanged H-ZSM-5 are efficient PDH catalysts with 90% propylene selectivity. It also suggests similarities between Ga and Zn speciation and PDH activity when exchanged into zeolites due to their isolectronic nature.

<quotes>
[1] "Metal-exchanged zeolites are well-known propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts; however, the structure of the active species remains unresolved."

[2] "In this review, existing PDH catalysts are first surveyed, and then the current understanding of metal-exchanged zeolite catalysts is described in detail."

[3] "The case of Ga/H-ZSM-5 is employed to showcase that advances in the understanding of structureactivity relations are often accompanied by technological or conceptional breakthroughs."  

[4] "The understanding of Ga speciation at PDH conditions has evolved owing to the advent of in situ/operando characterizations and to the realization that the local coordination environment of Ga species afforded by the zeolite support has a decisive impact on the active site structure."

[5] "In situ/operando quantitative characterization of catalysts, rigorous determination of intrinsic reaction rates, and predictive computational modeling are all significant in identifying the most active structure in these complex systems."

<quotes>

[1] "Vanadium-based materials have been the most extensively investigated catalysts in ODHP,[5] but B, Co, Cr, Fe, and Ni-based materials have also been explored.[5, 10-12] For example, hexagonal boron nitride achieves 79% propylene selectivity at 490 C with C3H8:O2 = 2:1 (14% propane conversion).[11]"

[2] "To date, proposed PDH mechanisms on Ga/H-ZSM-5 can be broadly categorized into carbenium and alkyl mechanisms.[76, 77, 133, 134] The carbenium mechanism claims that C3H8 is initially activated on the BAS to form a carbenium ion, and the role of Ga is to facilitate the recombination of the H atom on the catalyst surface to form H2, thereby increasing the reaction rate.[133, 134]"
