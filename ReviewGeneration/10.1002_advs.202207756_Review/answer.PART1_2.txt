1. The article evaluates Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. 

[1] "Pt-based catalysts exhibit superior ability in activating CH bonds in alkanes and low activity for CC cracking and coke formation. Compared with other catalysts, Pt-based catalysts show the highest turnover frequency (TOF) in PDH (Table 1). TOF normalized by Pt, or TOFPt, varies substantially with the support, the alloying metal, and the catalyst preparation method. The best-reported TOFPt is more than 1000 times higher than that of TOFCr (Table 1)."

[2] "Addition of a second metal to form bimetallic (intermetallic PtM, PtM alloy, or PtMOx clusters, M = metal) catalysts, such as PtSn,[32-34] PtGa,[35-38] PtZn,[30, 39-41] PtCu,[42], and PtCo,[43] can reduce the particle size of Pt, thereby improving the catalytic activity and inhibiting coke formation."

1. The article evaluates Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt-based catalysts have the highest turnover frequency, which is over 1000 times higher than Cr-based catalysts. It also shows adding a second metal like Sn, Ga, Zn, Cu, or Co to Pt can improve activity and inhibit coking by reducing Pt particle size.

[1] "The most accepted mechanism for Pt-based catalysts is the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanismfirst proposed in 1934involving: i) cleavage of the first CH bond in C3H8; ii) activation of the second CH bond in C3H7; iii) formation of a dihydrogen molecule; iv) desorption of hydrogen and propylene." 

[2] "The first CH cleavage is considered the RDS."
