1. Propylene is one of the main feedstocks in the chemical industry, used in the production of a great number of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene.[1] 

2. Metal-exchanged zeolites are well-known propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts; however, the structure of the active species remains unresolved.

3. Pt-based catalysts exhibit superior ability in activating CH bonds in alkanes and low activity for CC cracking and coke formation. Compared with other catalysts, Pt-based catalysts show the highest turnover frequency (TOF) in PDH.

4. PDH can be broadly grouped into two categories: non-oxidative and oxidative. In non-oxidative PDH, propane is catalytically dehydrogenated to produce stoichiometric amounts of propylene and hydrogen. It is endothermic (ΔH298Kθ = 124.3 kJ mol1) and a volume-increasing reaction (C3H8 → C3H6 + H2), and thus is favored at high temperature and low pressure.[8,9]

1. The article states that propylene is a key feedstock used to produce chemicals like polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene.

2. The article explains that metal-exchanged zeolite catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation, but the structure of the active catalytic sites is not fully understood. 

3. The article introduces Pt-based catalysts as having superior ability to activate C-H bonds in alkanes like propane while avoiding coke formation. Pt catalysts show the highest turnover frequencies for propane dehydrogenation.

4. The article describes how propane dehydrogenation is endothermic with a large positive enthalpy change, and favors high temperatures and low pressures. Quantitative thermodynamic and kinetic details are provided.

5. The article does not describe DFT calculations of propane dehydrogenation mechanisms.

6. The article does not present microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation. 

7. The article does not identify quantitative structure-activity relationships for propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
