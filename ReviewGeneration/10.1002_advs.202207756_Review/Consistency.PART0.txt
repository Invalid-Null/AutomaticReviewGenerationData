 Based on the provided correct answers and answer files, I have compared each answer file's responses to the correct answers and calculated the consistency percentages. Here is the JSON structure with the results:

```json

  "1": {
    "answer.PART0_0.txt": "0%", 
    "answer.PART0_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_2.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART0_3.txt": "50%",
    "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer.PART0_0.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART0_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_2.txt": "0%", 
    "answer.PART0_3.txt": "50%",
    "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "3": {
    "answer.PART0_0.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART0_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_2.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART0_3.txt": "50%", 
    "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "4": {
    "answer.PART0_0.txt": "50%",
    "answer.PART0_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_2.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART0_3.txt": "50%",
    "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "5": {
    "answer.PART0_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "6": {
    "answer.PART0_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "7": {
    "answer.PART0_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART0_4.txt": "100%"
  }
}
```

I carefully read each answer file and compared it to the provided correct answer for similarities in content and meaning. The percentage indicates the estimated consistency between each answer file's response and the correct answer. 0% means completely inconsistent, 50% means partially consistent, and 100% means fully consistent. Let me know if you need any clarification on the analysis!
