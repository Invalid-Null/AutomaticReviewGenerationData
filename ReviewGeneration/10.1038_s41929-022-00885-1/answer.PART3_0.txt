<quotes>
[1] "C2H4N4 (12g), C3H7NO2 (3g) and Ru(acac)3 (40mg) were added together to a ball mill jar. The mixture was then ground at a speed of 400rpm for 2h."

[2] "The resulting powder was transferred to a tubular furnace under N2 atmosphere (flow rate=60mlmin1) via the following treatment: The temperature was increased from 25 to 600C (3Cmin1) and maintained at 600C for 2h; and then it was further increased from 600 to 900C (2Cmin1) and maintained at 900C for 1h."

[1] "To get in-depth insight into the structural stability of Ru1/NC, we performed in situ EXAFS tests of Ru1/NC subjected to high-temperature treatments under different conditions." 

[2] "As shown in Fig. 4a, the XANES spectra of Ru species remain almost unchanged compared with the fresh catalyst, regardless of reduction treatment by H2 at 600C or during the in situ PDH reactions at 520C, indicating the valence state of the Ru1 centre over Ru1/NC is still slightly positive in the reaction."

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ XANES characterization to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it performs in-situ EXAFS on Ru1/NC catalysts during high temperature H2 reduction and propane dehydrogenation reaction, finding that the Ru1 oxidation state remains slightly positive during reaction.

[1] "HAADF-STEM images of Ru1/NC at different image magnifications (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1) do not show any Ru nanoparticles. Furthermore, aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM (AC-HAADF-STEM) reveals that a large number of uniformly dispersed Ru single atoms are clearly observed over Ru1/NC (Fig. 1c,d)."

[2] "For comparison, Ru nanoparticles can be discerned clearly over 1RuNP/NC and 6RuNP/NC by HAADF-STEM (Supplementary Figs. 2a and 3a). Statistical analysis for approximately 200 particles shows that the average particle sizes of Ru metal over 1RuNP/NC and 6RuNP/NC are 1.1 and 2.3nm, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 2b and 3b)."

5. Yes, the article employs HAADF-STEM and AC-HAADF-STEM microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses these techniques to show isolated single Ru atoms dispersed on the N-doped carbon support for the Ru1/NC catalyst, and Ru nanoparticles on the support for the RuNP catalysts.
