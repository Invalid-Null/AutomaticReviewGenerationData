[1] "To investigate the effect of peripheral nitrogen on Ru1 sites, Ru1 on activated carbon (Ru1/AC) and Ru1/NC with a low Ru loading of 0.1wt% (0.1Ru1/NC) were prepared for comparison."

[2] "The PDH activity test shows that the initial selectivity of propylene over 0.1Ru1/NC (94%) is superior to that over 0.1Ru1/AC (79%) at 600°C under similar propane conversion (Supplementary Fig. 8), demonstrating the positive effect of nitrogen species on propylene selectivity."

5. Answer: The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Ru catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It prepares Ru single atoms supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (Ru1/NC) and activated carbon (Ru1/AC). It shows that Ru1/NC with 0.1% loading has higher initial propylene selectivity (94%) compared to Ru1/AC (79%) under similar propane conversion, demonstrating the positive effect of nitrogen species on selectivity.

[1] "Experimental and density functional theory studies reveal the important role of peripheral N species around the Ru1 centre. The inner-shell N stabilizes the atomically dispersed Ru to inhibit structure-sensitive propane cracking, while the outer-shell N promotes electron accumulation at the Ru1 centre, inducing a significant charge repulsion between Ru1 and propylene to facilitate its desorption."

[2] "The comparison between 0.1Ru1/AC and 0.1Ru1/NC in Supplementary Fig. 8 indicates the positive effect of N species on propylene selectivity."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

6. Answer: The article investigates how properties like coordination environment and electron donation ability of nitrogen species affect the performance of supported Ru catalysts. It shows inner-shell nitrogen stabilizes atomically dispersed Ru to inhibit propane cracking while outer-shell nitrogen promotes electron accumulation at Ru sites, inducing charge repulsion with propylene to improve selectivity. Comparisons between Ru1/NC and Ru1/AC indicate positive effects of nitrogen species on propylene selectivity.

6. 答案:该文研究了诸如协调环境和氮种类的电子供体能力等性质对支撑Ru催化剂性能的影响。结果显示内层氮稳定了原子分散的Ru以抑制丙烷裂化,而外层氮促进了Ru位点的电子累积,诱导Ru与丙烯之间的电荷排斥以提高选择性。Ru1/NC与Ru1/AC的比较表明氮种类对丙烯选择性有正面影响。

[1] "As shown in Fig. 5c, the calculated free energy barriers of the first dehydrogenation step (CH3CH2CH3*CH3CHCH3*+H*) are 1.061 and 1.357eV for RuN3C-13 and RuN4-14, respectively." 

[2] "In the transition state, the corresponding lengths of the breaking C(β)H bond are 1.483 and 1.599Å and the distances for the forming C(β)Ru bond are 2.339 and 2.352Å for these two systems, respectively."

[3] "For the second dehydrogenation step (CH3CHCH3*+H*CH3CHCH2*+2H*), the calculated free energy barriers are much lower (0.701eV on RuN3C-13 and 0.444eV on RuN4-14), suggesting the first dehydrogenation step is rate determining for propane conversion."

7. Answer: The article calculates free energy barriers for propane dehydrogenation steps over different Ru1/NC models. It shows the first dehydrogenation step has higher barriers of 1.061-1.357 eV and is likely rate-determining, with C-H bond breaking and C-Ru bond forming distances provided. The second dehydrogenation step has lower barriers around 0.444-0.701 eV.
