<quotes>
[1] "The development of alternative catalysts, at low cost and high stability, to replace the industrial Pt-based catalysts is a long-term pursuit for the PDH reaction."
[2] "Although interest in MNC (where M refers to transition metals) materials has recently flourished in the rational design of stable SACs due to strong covalent bonding between the N species and M1 metal, to date most studies have focused on regulation of inner-shell coordination N species, whereas the effect of the outer-shell N species on single-atom sites and catalytic properties has attracted little attention."
[3] "In summary, we developed a highly efficient and stable Ru1/NC SAC for the high-temperature PDH reaction."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article summarizes remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It notes the need to develop alternative catalysts to replace expensive Pt-based industrial catalysts as a long-term goal for PDH. It also identifies that most prior work on metal-nitrogen-carbon single atom catalysts has focused on regulating the inner coordination shell, while the outer coordination shell's effects are not well understood. The article summarizes that developing highly efficient and stable single atom catalysts like their Ru1/NC material remains an ongoing challenge for propane dehydrogenation.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:本文总结了丙烷脱氢催化中仍存在的挑战和知识空白。它指出开发替代催化剂来取代昂贵的铂基工业催化剂是丙烷脱氢的长期目标。它还指出,在金属-氮-碳单原子催化剂方面,目前多数工作集中在调控内层配位壳,而外层配位壳的影响还不甚了解。本文总结说,开发如他们的Ru1/NC等高效稳定的单原子催化剂仍是丙烷脱氢所面临的持续挑战。
