<quotes>
[1] "C2H4N4 (12g), C3H7NO2 (3g) and Ru(acac)3 (40mg) were added together to a ball mill jar. The mixture was then ground at a speed of 400rpm for 2h."

[2] "The resulting powder was transferred to a tubular furnace under N2 atmosphere (flow rate=60mlmin1) via the following treatment: The temperature was increased from 25 to 600C (3Cmin1) and maintained at 600C for 2h; and then it was further increased from 600 to 900C (2Cmin1) and maintained at 900C for 1h."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it uses ball milling of ruthenium acetylacetonate, L-alanine, and dicyandiamide, followed by pyrolysis under nitrogen atmosphere, to synthesize single atom Ru sites dispersed on N-doped carbon support.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

3. 该文探究了优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。具体而言,该文使用乙酰丙酮铑、L-丙氨酸和双氰胺的球磨,接着在氮气氛下进行焙烧,在氮掺杂的碳支撑上合成单原子 Ru 位点。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "To get in-depth insight into the structural stability of Ru1/NC, we performed in situ EXAFS tests of Ru1/NC subjected to high-temperature treatments under different conditions." 

[2] "As shown in Fig. 4a, the XANES spectra of Ru species remain almost unchanged compared with the fresh catalyst, regardless of reduction treatment by H2 at 600C or during the in situ PDH reactions at 520C, indicating the valence state of the Ru1 centre over Ru1/NC is still slightly positive in the reaction."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ XANES characterization to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it performs in-situ EXAFS on Ru1/NC catalysts during high temperature H2 reduction and propane dehydrogenation reaction, finding that the Ru1 oxidation state remains slightly positive during reaction.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

4. 是的,该文利用了原位 XANES 表征来研究正在进行丙烷脱氢反应的催化剂。具体而言,该文在高温氢气还原和丙烷脱氢反应过程中,对 Ru1/NC 催化剂进行了原位 EXAFS 测试,发现 Ru1 氧化态在反应过程中保持略为正电。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "HAADF-STEM images of Ru1/NC at different image magnifications (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1) do not show any Ru nanoparticles. Furthermore, aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM (AC-HAADF-STEM) reveals that a large number of uniformly dispersed Ru single atoms are clearly observed over Ru1/NC (Fig. 1c,d)."

[2] "For comparison, Ru nanoparticles can be discerned clearly over 1RuNP/NC and 6RuNP/NC by HAADF-STEM (Supplementary Figs. 2a and 3a). Statistical analysis for approximately 200 particles shows that the average particle sizes of Ru metal over 1RuNP/NC and 6RuNP/NC are 1.1 and 2.3nm, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 2b and 3b)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

5. Yes, the article employs HAADF-STEM and AC-HAADF-STEM microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses these techniques to show isolated single Ru atoms dispersed on the N-doped carbon support for the Ru1/NC catalyst, and Ru nanoparticles on the support for the RuNP catalysts.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

5. 是的,该文采用 HAADF-STEM 和 AC-HAADF-STEM 显微技术来表征丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-载体界面。该文利用这些技术展示了 Ru1/NC 催化剂中单分散的 Ru 原子存在于氮掺杂的碳载体上,而 RuNP 催化剂上存在 Ru 纳米颗粒。
