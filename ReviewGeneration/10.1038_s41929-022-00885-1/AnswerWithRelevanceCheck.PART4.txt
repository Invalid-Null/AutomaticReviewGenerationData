      [1] "The development of alternative catalysts, at low cost and high stability, to replace the industrial Pt-based catalysts is a long-term pursuit for the PDH reaction."
      [2] "Although interest in MNC (where M refers to transition metals) materials has recently flourished in the rational design of stable SACs due to strong covalent bonding between the N species and M1 metal, to date most studies have focused on regulation of inner-shell coordination N species, whereas the effect of the outer-shell N species on single-atom sites and catalytic properties has attracted little attention." 
      [3] "In summary, we developed a highly efficient and stable Ru1/NC SAC for the high-temperature PDH reaction."

      The article summarizes remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It notes the need to develop alternative catalysts to replace expensive Pt-based industrial catalysts as a long-term goal for PDH. It also identifies that most prior work on metal-nitrogen-carbon single atom catalysts has focused on regulating the inner coordination shell, while the outer coordination shell's effects are not well understood. The article summarizes that developing highly efficient and stable single atom catalysts like their Ru1/NC material remains an ongoing challenge for propane dehydrogenation.
