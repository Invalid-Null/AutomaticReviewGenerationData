[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is believed to have great potential for intentional propylene production, and as a result, it has been extensively investigated."

[2] "However, a complete understanding of the reactions, including coke formation and deactivation, at an elementary step level is lacking."  

[3] "Most of the reported propane or ethane reaction order is identical to 1, and the hydrogen reaction order changes from 1.9 to 1, depending on the active metals, bimetallic structures, and supports as well as the reaction conditions."
