 Unfortunately the provided answers do not contain relevant information to address the questions asked. The answers focus solely on supported platinum catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, and do not provide any details about metal oxide catalysts, tuning metal oxide properties, mechanistic scenarios over metal oxides, or metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts.

Since the answers are not pertinent to the questions posed, I will refrain from providing aggregated responses and simply state:
