[1] "Calcined hydrotalcite-supported platinum catalysts of different cluster sizes (3-9 nm) were prepared by the stepwise growth method."

[2] "It has been shown that dehydrogenation of propane on a Pt catalyst is highly structure-sensitive." 

[3] "The activity of propane conversion decreases with an increasing Pt cluster size, while the selectivity to propylene performs in an inverse way."

[4] "The catalyst with smaller cluster sizes, with (211) dominating on the surface, has a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier and thus a higher activity."

[5] "However, the weakened binding strength of propylene and increased energy barrier for propylene deep dehydrogenation on Pt(111) contribute to the high selectivity toward propylene and better stability on the Pt catalysts of larger cluster sizes, on which (111) is dominant on the surface."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It prepares calcined hydrotalcite-supported Pt catalysts with controlled cluster sizes from 3-9 nm using a stepwise growth method. It shows that propane dehydrogenation over Pt is highly structure-sensitive. The activity decreases but propylene selectivity increases with increasing Pt size, due to changes in dehydrogenation barriers and propylene binding on different Pt facets like (111) and (211).

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like Pt particle size, shape, and dominant surface facets affect the performance of supported Pt catalysts. It shows activity decreases but selectivity increases with increasing size due to changes in dehydrogenation barriers and propylene binding on different facets. Kinetic analysis reveals the rate-limiting step changes from first to second CH activation as dominant facets shift from (211) to (111).
