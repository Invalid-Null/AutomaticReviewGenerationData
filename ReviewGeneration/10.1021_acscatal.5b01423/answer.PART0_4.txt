<quotes>
[1] "Platinum catalysts are widely used in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons."

[2] "The coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms on steps and corners have high activity toward cracking."

[3] "Platinum cluster size has a significant influence on the activity, selectivity, and stability as well as the reaction mechanism during propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
2. The article explains that platinum catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing active sites like steps and corners that can activate C-H bonds with lower activation barriers. Specifically, it notes that smaller platinum clusters have more under-coordinated atoms that promote high activity but also cracking side reactions.

<quotes>
[1] "Developing alternative routes of propylene production is therefore of great interest."

[2] "However, a complete understanding of the reactions, including coke formation and deactivation, at an elementary step level is lacking." 

[3] "It reveals that the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms on steps and corners have high activity toward cracking."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
4. The article discusses that thermodynamic limitations make propylene selectivity difficult, while elementary steps like coke formation and catalyst deactivation are not fully understood. It notes the tradeoff between high activity sites that promote desired dehydrogenation vs. cracking side reactions. However, no quantitative thermodynamic or kinetic details are provided.
