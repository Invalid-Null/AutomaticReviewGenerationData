[1] "Calcined hydrotalcite-supported platinum catalysts of different cluster sizes (3–9 nm) were prepared by the stepwise growth method."

[2] "The Pt colloids were homogeneously distributed with nearly monodispersion."

[3] "It has been shown that dehydrogenation of propane on a Pt catalyst is highly structure-sensitive." 

[4] "The activity of propane conversion decreases with an increasing Pt cluster size, while the selectivity to propylene performs in an inverse way."

[5] "The catalyst with smaller cluster sizes, with (211) dominating on the surface, has a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier and thus a higher activity."

[6] "However, the weakened binding strength of propylene and increased energy barrier for propylene deep dehydrogenation on Pt(111) contribute to the high selectivity toward propylene and better stability on the Pt catalysts of larger cluster sizes, on which (111) is dominant on the surface."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic platinum catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Specific data, characterizations and insights are provided on how platinum cluster size affects activity and selectivity. Smaller Pt clusters with more Pt(211) facets have higher activity but lower selectivity, while larger Pt clusters with more Pt(111) facets have lower activity but higher propylene selectivity.

However, large Pt clusters with Pt(111) dominating result in a weakened binding strength of propylene and an increased energy barrier for the activation of CH bonds in propylene, which leads to higher selectivity toward propylene by lowering the possibility of deep dehydrogenation."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and exposed facets affect the performance of supported Pt catalysts. Smaller Pt clusters with more Pt(211) steps/edges have higher activity but lower selectivity, while larger Pt clusters with more Pt(111) terraces have lower activity but higher propylene selectivity due to weaker propylene binding and higher barrier for deep dehydrogenation.

答:是的,这篇文章研究了金属粒子大小、形状和暴露的面这样的性质如何影响Supported Pt催化剂的性能。较小的Pt簇具有更多Pt(211)阶梯/边缘,活性更高但选择性较低,而较大的Pt簇具有更多Pt(111)陡峭,活性较低但丙烯选择性较高,这是由于丙烯结合较弱以及深度脱氢的屏障更高。

[1] "Here the elementary step with a higher energy barrier is taken into account on each facet; that is, the first CH bond activation refers to the activation of the -CH2- group on Pt(111), while on Pt(211) and Pt(100), the CH bond at the -CH3 group is first activated."

[2] "On Pt(211), the activation energy for the first CH bond activation is much higher than that of the second CH bond activation, and the potential energy diagram going from propane to propylene is apparently downhill; therefore, the first CH bond activation is most likely the RDS." 

[3] "On the Pt(111) surface, however, the activation energies are quite close for both CH activations. Considering the low surface coverage of C3H7 at very low C3H8 partial pressures, it is reasonable to expect that the second CH bond activation is the RDS."

[4] "Through kinetic analysis, including a multifaceted kinetic model coupled with DFT calculations and kinetic isotope effect experiments, the first CH bond activation is identified as the RDS on Pt(211) and Pt(100) while the second CH bond activation is found to be kinetically relevant on Pt(111)."
</quotes>

<English version answer> 
Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the studied Pt catalysts. The first CH bond activation is identified as rate-limiting on Pt(211) and Pt(100) facets, while the second CH activation is rate-limiting on Pt(111) facets. This facet-dependent mechanism is supported by kinetic analysis, DFT calculations, and kinetic isotope experiments.

答:是的,这篇文章为研究的Pt催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢的机理反应途径。第一CH键激活被确定为Pt(211)和Pt(100)面上的速率控制步骤,而第二CH激活是Pt(111)面上的速率控制步骤。这种取决于面の机制得到了动力学分析、DFT计算和动力学同位素实验的支持。
