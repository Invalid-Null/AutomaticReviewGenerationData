[1] "Pt nanoparticles of varied cluster sizes (3–9 nm) were prepared by the stepwise growth method."

[2] "It has been shown that dehydrogenation of propane on a Pt catalyst is highly structure-sensitive." 

[3] "The activity of propane conversion decreases with an increasing Pt cluster size, while the selectivity to propylene performs in an inverse way."

[4] "The catalyst with smaller cluster sizes, with (211) dominating on the surface, has a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier and thus a higher activity."

[5] "However, the weakened binding strength of propylene and increased energy barrier for propylene deep dehydrogenation on Pt(111) contribute to the high selectivity toward propylene and better stability on the Pt catalysts of larger cluster sizes, on which (111) is dominant on the surface."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It prepares Pt nanoparticles of 3-9 nm cluster sizes and shows they exhibit structure-sensitive performance - smaller Pt clusters with more Pt(211) sites have higher activity but lower selectivity, while larger Pt clusters with more Pt(111) sites have lower activity but higher propylene selectivity and stability. DFT calculations confirm the Pt(211) sites activate propane more easily but also lead to over-dehydrogenation of propylene.

答:是的,这篇文章评估了单金属Pt载体催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它制备了3-9 nm团簇大小的Pt纳米粒子,并表明它们表现出结构敏感性能——更小的Pt簇具有更多Pt(211)位点,活性更高但选择性更低,而更大的Pt簇具有更多Pt(111)位点,活性较低但丙烯选择性和稳定性更高。 DFT计算确认Pt(211)位点更容易激活丙烷,但也会导致丙烯过度脱氢。

<English version answer> 
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like Pt particle size, shape, and facets affect the performance of supported Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows smaller Pt particles with more Pt(211) sites have higher activity but lower selectivity, while larger Pt particles with more Pt(111) sites have lower activity but higher propylene selectivity and stability. DFT calculations confirm the structure-function relationships.

[1] "The Pt clusters of small cluster sizes, with (211) dominating on the surface, have a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier and thus higher activity. However, large Pt clusters with Pt(111) dominating result in a weakened binding strength of propylene and an increased energy barrier for the activation of CH bonds in propylene, which leads to higher selectivity toward propylene by lowering the possibility of deep dehydrogenation."

[2] "It is assumed that propane is first physisorbed on the Pt surface, followed by the surface reaction of the first and second CH activation, and desorption of propylene and hydrogen molecules." 

[3] "On Pt(211) and Pt(100), the first CH bond activation is the RDS, while on Pt(111) the second CH bond activation is kinetically relevant."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the supported Pt catalysts. It describes propane first physisorbing, then undergoing 1st and 2nd CH bond activation steps. On Pt(211) and Pt(100) sites, the 1st CH activation is rate-limiting, while on Pt(111), the 2nd CH activation is relevant. Pt(211) sites lead to over-dehydrogenation of propylene.

<Chinese version answer> 
答:是的,这篇文章提出了载体Pt催化剂上的丙烷脱氢的机理反应途径。它描述了丙烷先物理吸附,然后经历第1和第2个CH键激活步骤。在Pt(211)和Pt(100)位点上,第1个CH激活是速率控制步骤,而在Pt(111)上,第2个CH激活是相关的。Pt(211)位点会导致丙烯过度脱氢。
