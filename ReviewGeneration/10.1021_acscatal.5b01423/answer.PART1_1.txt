 Unfortunately this literature does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, discuss how tuning metal oxide properties affects performance, propose mechanistic scenarios over metal oxides, or explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts. The literature focuses entirely on supported platinum catalysts.

<quotes>
[1] "It has been shown that dehydrogenation of propane on a Pt catalyst is highly structure-sensitive. The activity of propane conversion decreases with an increasing Pt cluster size, while the selectivity to propylene performs in an inverse way."

[2] "The catalyst with smaller cluster sizes, with (211) dominating on the surface, has a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier and thus a higher activity. However, the weakened binding strength of propylene and increased energy barrier for propylene deep dehydrogenation on Pt(111) contribute to the high selectivity toward propylene and better stability on the Pt catalysts of larger cluster sizes, on which (111) is dominant on the surface."

[3] "The Pt colloids were homogeneously distributed with nearly monodispersion." 

[4] "The Pt nanoparticles are dispersed in ethanol and then supported on calcined hydrotalcite, Mg(Al)O, by the incipient wetness impregnation method."

[5] "The catalysts were dried overnight in vacuum at 343 K and calcined under a N2 (Yara Praxair, 99.999%, approximately 1 cm3 s1) flow at 873 K for 6 h."

5. Yes, the article evaluates supported monometallic platinum catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on how platinum particle size affects activity and selectivity, with smaller sizes favoring activity but larger sizes improving selectivity. The platinum colloids were prepared with good monodispersion and supported on calcined hydrotalcite. Details on drying, calcination, and N2 flow during preparation are also provided.

6. Yes, the article investigates how platinum particle size, shape, and support interactions affect performance. It shows activity decreases but selectivity increases with larger sizes. DFT calculations reveal the (211) facet dominates on smaller particles, improving activity, while the (111) facet on larger sizes enhances selectivity. The platinum nanoparticles were well dispersed and supported on calcined hydrotalcite.

[1] "The elementary steps involved in propane dehydrogenation are shown in Scheme 1. Equation 3-1 or 3-2 shows the forward dehydrogenation reaction rate, assuming that the first or second CH bond activation is the RDS, respectively." 

[2] "It is assumed that propane is first physisorbed on the Pt surface, followed by the surface reaction of the first and second CH activation, and desorption of propylene and hydrogen molecules."

[3] "To understand the effects of different facets on the catalytic performances, DFT calculations were performed to obtain the adsorption energies of intermediates and energy barriers for elementary steps involved in propane dehydrogenation."

7. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the platinum catalysts. It describes the elementary steps like physisorption of propane, first and second CH bond activation, and desorption of propylene and hydrogen. DFT calculations provide energies and barriers for these steps on different platinum facets.
