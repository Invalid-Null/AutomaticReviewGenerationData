         [1] "Platinum catalysts are widely used in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons."
         [2] "Many of these reactions are known to be structure-sensitive, which has been intensively studied for supported metal catalysts."
         [3] "The coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms on steps and corners have high activity toward cracking."
         [4] "Platinum cluster size has a significant influence on the activity, selectivity, and stability as well as the reaction mechanism during propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."

         2. The article explains that platinum catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing active sites like steps and corners that can activate C-H bonds with lower activation barriers. Specifically, it notes that smaller platinum clusters have more under-coordinated atoms that promote high activity but also cracking side reactions.

         2. 该文献解释了铂催化剂通过提供如步阶和拐角等活性位点来促进丙烷脱氢,这些位点能以较低的活化能激活C-H键。具体来说,它提到较小的铂簇具有更多未配位原子,这促进了高活性但也促进了裂化副反应。

         [1] "Developing alternative routes of propylene production is therefore of great interest."  
         [2] "However, a complete understanding of the reactions, including coke formation and deactivation, at an elementary step level is lacking."
         [3] "It reveals that the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms on steps and corners have high activity toward cracking." 
      </Quotes>
      
      <English>
         4. The article discusses that thermodynamic limitations make propylene selectivity difficult, while elementary steps like coke formation and catalyst deactivation are not fully understood. It notes the tradeoff between high activity sites that promote desired dehydrogenation vs. cracking side reactions. However, no quantitative thermodynamic or kinetic details are provided.
      </English>
      
      <Chinese>
         4. 该文献讨论了热力学限制使得丙烯选择性存在困难,而诸如焦炭生成和催化剂失活等基元步骤还不完全明白。它指出促进所需脱氢反应的高活性位点与促进裂化副反应之间的权衡。但是,没有提供定量的热力学或动力学细节。
