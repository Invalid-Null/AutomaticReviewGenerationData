[1] "Platinum catalysts are widely used in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Many of these reactions are known to be structure-sensitive."

[2] "The fact that Pt cluster size has a significant effect on both activity and selectivity toward methane and coke formation in propane dehydrogenation is in good agreement with the results of our previous experiments."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article explains that platinum catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing active sites that can selectively break CH and CC bonds. It states that many dehydrogenation reactions are structure-sensitive, so the size and composition of platinum clusters affects the activity and selectivity. Smaller platinum clusters were found to have higher activity but lower selectivity.

[1] "Developing alternative routes of propylene production is therefore of great interest. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is believed to have great potential for intentional propylene production." 

[2] "However, a complete understanding of the reactions, including coke formation and deactivation, at an elementary step level is lacking."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. The article states that propane dehydrogenation is an attractive route for propylene production, but the thermodynamics tend to favor cracking reactions and coke formation. It notes that current understanding of reaction mechanisms, kinetics and deactivation at a molecular level is still incomplete. No quantitative details of thermodynamics or kinetics are provided.

[1] "Our previous work has shown that Pt cluster size has a significant effect on both activity and selectivity toward methane and coke formation in propane dehydrogenation." 

[2] "To understand the effects of different facets on the catalytic performances, DFT calculations were performed to obtain the adsorption energies of intermediates and energy barriers for elementary steps involved in propane dehydrogenation."

5. The article presents DFT calculations of energetics for elementary steps in propane dehydrogenation on different platinum surface facets like Pt(111) and Pt(211). This provided insights into the effects of cluster size and composition on catalytic performance. The calculations revealed variations in dehydrogenation barriers and propylene binding energies that correlated with activity and selectivity differences.

[1] "It reveals that the smaller Pt clusters with more coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms on steps and corners have higher activity toward cracking."

[2] "On the Pt(211) surface, however, the desorption barrier on Pt(211) is higher than the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation, which leads to a strong preference for the formation of deeply dehydrogenated intermediates."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

7. The article identifies several structure-activity relationships for propane dehydrogenation over platinum catalysts. Smaller platinum clusters with more low-coordination sites like steps and corners were found to favor cracking reactions. Pt(111) facets were shown to bind propylene more weakly and hinder over-dehydrogenation compared to Pt(211) facets. These insights correlated platinum nanoparticle size and composition to catalytic performance.
