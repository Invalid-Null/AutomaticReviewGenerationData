[1] "The demand for propylene is growing rapidly. (1-3) There has been a large increase in the demand for polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, phenol, isopropyl alcohol, and many other propylene derivatives." 

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is believed to have great potential for intentional propylene production, and as a result, it has been extensively investigated."

[3] "However, a complete understanding of the reactions, including coke formation and deactivation, at an elementary step level is lacking."

[4] "Most of the reported propane or ethane reaction order is identical to 1, and the hydrogen reaction order changes from 1.9 to 1, depending on the active metals, bimetallic structures, and supports as well as the reaction conditions."

[5] "However, few of these studies have discussed the mechanism for the change in reaction order with respect to hydrogen."

[6] "The kinetics for this reaction has been previously studied both theoretically and experimentally, (4-11) and the well-accepted reaction mechanism is shown in Scheme 1."

[7] "It is assumed that propane is first physisorbed on the Pt surface, followed by the surface reaction of the first and second CH activation, and desorption of propylene and hydrogen molecules."

[8] "Recent progress in nanocatalysis by sizing and shaping nanoparticles provides new approaches for tuning the catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability." 

[9] "Atomic steps, kinks, and sites with special coordination properties can selectively break HH, CH, CC, CO, and OO bonds."

[10] "Many of these reactions are known to be structure-sensitive, (16) which has been intensively studied for supported metal catalysts." 

[11] "The population of atoms on steps is inversely proportional to the size of Pt particles, and it has a significant effect on the catalytic behavior."

[12] "The effect of cluster size on propane dehydrogenation has very rarely been reported."

[13] "Our previous work has shown that Pt cluster size has a significant effect on both activity and selectivity toward methane and coke formation in propane dehydrogenation." 

[14] "It reveals that the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms on steps and corners have high activity toward cracking."

[15] "The details kinetic model with elaborate DFT calculations was employed to provide the mechanistic insights during the propane dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts with diverse cluster sizes."

[16] "The apparent activation energy and reaction orders were studied with multifaceted kinetic model as a function of Pt particle size."

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing alternate reaction pathways with lower activation energy barriers compared to uncatalyzed reactions. It describes mechanisms such as the adsorption of reactants onto active sites, activation of C-H and C-C bonds through interactions with the catalyst surface, and desorption of products.

3. The article introduces supported metals (e.g. Pt), metal oxides, alloys, and zeolites as the major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation. 

4. The article discusses how thermodynamic limitations make propane dehydrogenation unfavorable, and kinetic factors determine catalyst performance. It provides quantitative details on reaction orders and activation energies.

5. The article describes using DFT calculations to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms on different Pt surface facets. Computational insights reveal differences in dehydrogenation barriers and propylene binding.

6. The article presents a microkinetic model incorporating DFT results to interpret the particle size effects on kinetics. Rate equations, activation energies, site coverages, and multifaceted models provide insights.

7. The article reveals structure-activity relationships between Pt particle size/exposed facets and catalytic performance. Smaller sizes favor dehydrogenation activity while larger sizes improve selectivity.
