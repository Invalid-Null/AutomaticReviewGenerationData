The given scientific literature does not discuss propane dehydrogenation specifically. It focuses on the alkylation of benzene with propane over bifunctional metal-acid catalysts. The questions ask about various aspects of propane dehydrogenation technology, processes, economics, safety, challenges, computational methods, characterization tools, and catalyst design, none of which are covered in this literature on benzene alkylation. Therefore, I have responded that the article does not address any of the specific details asked about in the questions, as it is not relevant to propane dehydrogenation.
