<Answer>

 Unfortunately this literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the provided questions about propane dehydrogenation. The article is focused on the alkylation of benzene with propane over bifunctional metal-acid catalysts to produce isopropylbenzene. It does not provide details on propane dehydrogenation mechanisms, kinetics, thermodynamics, computational studies, structure-activity relationships, or applications of propylene.
