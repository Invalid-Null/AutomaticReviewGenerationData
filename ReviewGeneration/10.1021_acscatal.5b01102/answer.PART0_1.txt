 Unfortunately, this scientific literature does not contain relevant information to answer the questions you have provided. The article is focused on the alkylation of benzene with propane over bifunctional metal-acid catalysts to produce isopropylbenzene. It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation mechanisms, kinetics or computational modeling efforts. There are no details provided about propylene production, applications or value. The article also does not introduce major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation. Since the content of the literature is not relevant to the questions, I do not have any quotes or answers to provide. Please let me know if you would like me to attempt to answer questions based on a different scientific literature.
