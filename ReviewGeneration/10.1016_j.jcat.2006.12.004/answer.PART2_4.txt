 I am unable to provide relevant quotes or answers for any of the given questions from the provided literature. The literature discusses bimetallic PtSn catalysts promoted by ceria supported on carbon for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane. It does not contain information related to propane dehydrogenation, zeolite supports, subsurface promoters, or specific comparisons of metallic versus oxidized catalysts that are asked about in the questions.

<English version answer>

1. No, the article does not compare selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts. It focuses only on bimetallic PtSn catalysts.

2. No, the article does not evaluate Pt alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It studies bimetallic PtSn catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation.  

3. No data or insights related to propane dehydrogenation or zeolite supports are provided.

4. No, the article does not investigate use of subsurface promoters in the catalysts studied.

5. No examples of synergistic effects between metals are provided. The article focuses on bimetallic PtSn catalysts.

6. No, the article does not evaluate zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

7. No investigation of effects of tuning Si/Al ratio or mesoporosity on propane dehydrogenation performance is provided.

<Chinese version answer>

1. 否,该文章没有比较金属氧化物与氧化支撑金属催化剂的选择性概况。它仅聚焦于双金属 PtSn 催化剂。

2. 否,该文章没有评估丙烷脱氢的 Pt 合金催化剂。它研究了异丁烷脱氢的双金属 PtSn 催化剂。

3. 没有提供与丙烷脱氢或沸石载体相关的数据或见解。

4. 否,该文章没有研究在所研究的催化剂中使用表面促进剂。  

5. 没有提供金属之间协同作用的示例。文章关注双金属 PtSn 催化剂。

6. 否,该文章没有评估丙烷脱氢催化剂的沸石载体。

7. 没有提供调节 Si/Al 比或介孔性对丙烷脱氢性能影响的研究。
