The answers do not contain information relevant to answering the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation catalysts, effects of metals and supports, etc. The answers focus solely on PtSn bimetallic catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation, without comparisons to other systems. I am unable to extract meaningful quotes or aggregate answers from the irrelevant information provided. As instructed, I have stopped the review process and responded that the answers are not relevant.
