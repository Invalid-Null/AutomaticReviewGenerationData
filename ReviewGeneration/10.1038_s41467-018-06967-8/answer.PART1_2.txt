[1] "Subsequent catalytic tests demonstrate the transferability from DFT calculations to practical catalytic reaction and the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with the low loading of Pt (0.1wt%) displays propylene selectivity of 90% with the high formation rate of 10.6molg−1Pth−1 under the conditions of atmospheric pressure, 520C, WHSV=4h−1, C3H8/N2=1/1."

[2] "Catalytic tests were performed in a quartz fixed-bed reactor with 8mm inner diameter and 24cm length at atmosphere pressure." 

[3] "The spent catalysts were characterized to further shed light on the relationship between the improved reaction rate and stability and the structure of Pt/Cu SAA."

[4] "Combining the results of TPSR of PD scrambling and TOFs, we conclude that the intrinsic activity of Pt/Cu SAA for PDH is only slightly lower than that of Pt nanoparticle while Cu nanoparticles presents an extremely low capacity for CH activation."

5. Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It performs catalytic tests on a Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst and a Pt nanoparticle catalyst supported on alumina. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with 0.1 wt% Pt loading showed 90% propylene selectivity and a high formation rate of 10.6 mol/g-Pt/h under atmospheric pressure at 520°C. The intrinsic activity of the Pt/Cu SAA was found to be slightly lower than Pt nanoparticles based on isotope scrambling experiments. The spent Pt/Cu SAA catalyst was characterized to understand its improved stability compared to Pt nanoparticles.

5. 是的,文章评估了载体单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它在氧化铝上进行了Pt/Cu单原子合金(SAA)催化剂和Pt纳米粒子催化剂的催化测试。含Pt 0.1 wt%的Pt/Cu SAA催化剂在大气压强下520°C显示出90%的丙烯选择性和高的形成速率10.6 mol/g-Pt/h。根据同位素交换实验,Pt/Cu SAA的固有活性略低于Pt纳米粒子。已用Pt/Cu SAA催化剂被表征以了解其比Pt纳米粒子更好��稳定性。

[1] "Our DFT calculation shows that different from the conventional Pt alloys, the Pt/Cu SAA breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship during PDH, displaying a quite negative difference between the desorption energy and further dehydrogenation barrier of propylene, and at the same time maintaining a reasonable dehydrogenation energy barrier for propane."

[2] "The deep dehydrogenation thus becomes strongly endothermic over Pt/Cu SAA with a significant free energy barrier (>2eV), compared with the same step over Pt(111) with a surmountable barrier (<1eV), leading to a much higher propylene selectivity over Pt/Cu SAA."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
7. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic reaction pathway for propane dehydrogenation over the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst. DFT calculations showed the Pt/Cu SAA breaks the typical scaling relationship seen for Pt alloy catalysts. The high barrier for deep dehydrogenation of propylene to coke precursors on Pt/Cu SAA leads to much higher propylene selectivity compared to Pt(111). Isolated Pt active sites limit further dehydrogenation steps.

7. 是的,文章提出了Pt/Cu SAA催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机理反应途径。DFT计算表明Pt/Cu SAA打破了典型的Pt合金催化剂缩放关系。Pt/Cu SAA上丙烯深度脱氢形成焦炭前驱物的高能垒导致其比Pt(111)具有更高的丙烯选择性。隔离的Pt活性位点限制了进一步的脱氢步骤。
