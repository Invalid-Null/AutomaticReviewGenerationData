[1] "Noble-metal alloys are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts. However, due to the existence of scaling properties of adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces, the enhancement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by side reactions leading to a reduction in selectivity for the target product."

[2] "Our previous DFT calculations indicate that the catalytic properties of these PtM alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehydrogenation of propane."

2. The article explains that catalysts like noble metal alloys lower activation energy barriers for propane dehydrogenation, but side reactions can occur due to scaling relationships between adsorption energies, reducing selectivity. DFT calculations show PtM alloy catalytic properties are restricted by scaling relationships, enhancing propylene selectivity while suppressing propane dehydrogenation activity.

[1] "Given the assumption that Pt atoms are individually dispersed in Cu nanoparticles for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, keeping the content of Cu (10wt%) unchanged, we decreased progressively the amount of Pt from 0.1wt% to 0.025wt%, which guarantees the structure unchanged. The initial activity correlates linearly with the Pt content, which again suggests the formation of Pt/Cu SAA (Fig. 2b)." 

[2] "Unlike over Pt surfaces, the isolated Pt atom in Pt/Cu SAA can only interact with a single Pt atom for the deep dehydrogenated C3H5, a model precursor of coke formation, instead of more stable three PtC interactions on threefold hollow site over Pt(111) (Fig. 1c). The deep dehydrogenation thus becomes strongly endothermic over Pt/Cu SAA with a significant free energy barrier (>2eV), compared with the same step over Pt(111) with a surmountable barrier (<1eV), leading to a much higher propylene selectivity over Pt/Cu SAA (Fig. 1d)."

4. The article discusses how the initial catalytic activity scales linearly with Pt content in Pt/Cu SAA, indicating intrinsic kinetic constraints. DFT calculations reveal thermodynamic constraints, with deep dehydrogenation endothermic on Pt/Cu SAA but surmountable on Pt, enhancing propylene selectivity. Quantitative free energy barriers for deep dehydrogenation are given.

[1] "As shown in previous theoretical studies, the PDH activity can be described by the first dehydrogenation barrier which is the rate-determining step, and the selectivity was estimated by the difference between di-σ propene desorption barrier and its further dehydrogenation barrier (the highest barrier for di-σ propene dehydrogenation to C3H4 shown in Fig. 1d and Supplementary Figure 1)11."

[2] "Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the catalysts based on Pt/Cu SAA have the potential to achieve a decent catalytic performance for PDH."

[3] "However, isolated Pt atoms dispersed in Cu nanoparticles maintain a reasonable dehydrogenation activation barrier and at the same time display a quite high selectivity, which is reflected by the low binding strength of propylene and high deep dehydrogenation barrier (Fig. 1a)."
