[1] "We simply synthesized the catalysts with Pt/Cu SAA supported on γ-alumina by means of atomic dilution."

[2] "Given the appearance of the co-reduction peaks (Supplementary Figure 6), the close contact between Cu oxide species and Pt oxide species leads to preferential formation of PtCu bimetallic nanoparticles rather than two metal phases apart from each other during reduction."

[3] "Then with the amount of Pt fixed, further addition of Cu lowers the concentration of Pt in the Pt/Cu surface alloy leading to easier formation of Pt/Cu SAA."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes using an atomic dilution method to synthesize Pt/Cu single atom alloys (SAA) supported on alumina, by fixing the Pt content and increasing the Cu content to achieve high dispersion of isolated Pt atoms in Cu nanoparticles. The close contact of Pt and Cu oxide species leads to preferential formation of PtCu bimetallic nanoparticles during reduction.

[1] "In situ EXAFS performed at the PtLIII edge and CuK edge reveals the coordination of Pt and Cu in monometallic Pt and bimetallic PtCu catalysts."

[2] "At the Pt-LIII edge, there are 6.8 PtCu bonds at 2.53Å and no PtPt coordination is detected in the fully reduced 0.1Pt6.7Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, providing direct evidence for the isolated Pt atoms in the bimetallic PtCu catalysts at high Cu to Pt molar ratios."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article utilizes in-situ EXAFS characterization to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It performs EXAFS at the Pt LIII edge and Cu K edge to reveal Pt-Cu bonding and lack of Pt-Pt bonding in the 0.1Pt6.7Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, providing evidence for isolated Pt atoms at high Cu:Pt ratios.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:这篇文章利用了原位EXAFS表征技术来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它在Pt LIII边和Cu K边进行EXAFS,揭示了0.1Pt6.7Cu/Al2O3催化剂中的Pt-Cu键合和缺乏Pt-Pt键合,为高Cu:Pt比率下Pt的隔离存在提供了证据。

[1] "Single Pt atoms can be distinguished from Cu atoms due to differences in the Z-contrast." 

[2] "Figure 4a indicates the presence of individual brighter Pt atoms in Cu nanoparticles."

[3] "HAADF-STEM images of 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 after successive oxidationreduction cycles show that Pt atoms identified from their higher brightness comparing to their surrounding area are still individually dispersed in Cu nanoparticles, confirming its good cycle stability."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article employs aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM microscopy to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses Z-contrast imaging to distinguish single Pt atoms dispersed in Cu nanoparticles, both before and after reaction. This confirms stable dispersion of isolated Pt atoms in the Cu nanoparticles.
</English version answer>
