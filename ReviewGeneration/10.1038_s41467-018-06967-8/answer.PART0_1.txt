[2]According to our previous DFT calculations, the catalytic properties of these PtM alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehydrogenation of propane11.

[3] Noble-metal alloys are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts.

[4] It indicates that the best catalysts should bind reactive intermediates with suitable interaction strength: neither too strong that leads to surface poisoning, nor too weak which fails to activate the reactants1.

<English version answer>

1. The article does not provide background information on the importance and applications of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation.

2. The article explains that PtM alloy catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation barriers, but are restricted by scaling relationships that limit simultaneous improvements in activity and selectivity.

3. The article briefly mentions that noble metal alloys are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide specific examples.

4. The article discusses the Sabatier principle which states that ideal catalysts should bind intermediates with optimal strength, and provides a quantitative example of avoiding overly strong or weak binding.

5. The article does not describe applying DFT calculations to study mechanisms and pathways of propane dehydrogenation.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics. 

7. The article does not identify any computational or experimental descriptors correlating catalyst properties to propane dehydrogenation performance.
