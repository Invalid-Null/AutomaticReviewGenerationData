2. The article explains that catalysts like noble metal alloys lower activation energy barriers for propane dehydrogenation, but side reactions can occur due to scaling relationships between adsorption energies, reducing selectivity.

[1] "Given the assumption that Pt atoms are individually dispersed in Cu nanoparticles for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, keeping the content of Cu (10wt%) unchanged, we decreased progressively the amount of Pt from 0.1wt% to 0.025wt%, which guarantees the structure unchanged. The initial activity correlates linearly with the Pt content, which again suggests the formation of Pt/Cu SAA (Fig. 2b)." 

[2] "Unlike over Pt surfaces, the isolated Pt atom in Pt/Cu SAA can only interact with a single Pt atom for the deep dehydrogenated C3H5, a model precursor of coke formation, instead of more stable three PtC interactions on threefold hollow site over Pt(111) (Fig. 1c). The deep dehydrogenation thus becomes strongly endothermic over Pt/Cu SAA with a significant free energy barrier (>2eV), compared with the same step over Pt(111) with a surmountable barrier (<1eV), leading to a much higher propylene selectivity over Pt/Cu SAA (Fig. 1d)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. The article discusses how the initial catalytic activity scales linearly with Pt content in Pt/Cu SAA, indicating intrinsic kinetic constraints. DFT calculations reveal thermodynamic constraints, with deep dehydrogenation endothermic on Pt/Cu SAA but surmountable on Pt, enhancing propylene selectivity. Quantitative free energy barriers for deep dehydrogenation are given.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

4. 文章讨论了Pt/Cu SAA中的初始催化活性与Pt含量线性相关,提示内在的动力学约束。DFT计算揭示了热力学约束,深度脱氢在Pt/Cu SAA上是吸热的,而在Pt上是可逾越的,提高了丙烯选择性。文中给出了深度脱氢的自由能垒的定量值。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "As shown in previous theoretical studies, the PDH activity can be described by the first dehydrogenation barrier which is the rate-determining step, and the selectivity was estimated by the difference between di-σ propene desorption barrier and its further dehydrogenation barrier (the highest barrier for di-σ propene dehydrogenation to C3H4 shown in Fig. 1d and Supplementary Figure 1)11."

[2] "Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the catalysts based on Pt/Cu SAA have the potential to achieve a decent catalytic performance for PDH." 

</quotes>

<English version answer>

5. The article describes how DFT calculations of dehydrogenation barriers and desorption barriers have provided insights into propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and selectivity on Pt/Cu SAA versus Pt surfaces. This guides design of Pt/Cu SAA catalysts predicted to achieve enhanced performance.
