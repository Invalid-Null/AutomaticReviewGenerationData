         [1] "We simply synthesized the catalysts with Pt/Cu SAA supported on γ-alumina by means of atomic dilution." 

         [2] "It can be expected that Pt atoms would be individually dispersed in Cu nanoparticles if diluted to a certain degree and the structure would stay the same with further dilution."

         [3] "Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the catalysts based on Pt/Cu SAA have the potential to achieve a decent catalytic performance for PDH."

         Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques including in-situ DRIFTS, in-situ EXAFS, and temperature programmed experiments to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. These provide insights into the metal coordination, oxidation states, and coke formation during catalysis.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         答:是的,本文利用包括原位DRIFTS、原位EXAFS和程序升温实验在内的原位表征技术来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。这些为催化过程中的金属配位、氧化态和焦炭生成提供了洞见。

        [1] "Figure 4a indicates the presence of individual brighter Pt atoms in Cu nanoparticles."
   
        [2] "Single Pt atoms in Cu nanoparticles are repeatedly observed in different regions of the reduced 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, and no clusters or nanoparticles of Pt on γ-alumina are found."
   
        [3] "HAADF-STEM images of 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 after successive oxidation-reduction cycles show that Pt atoms identified from their higher brightness comparing to their surrounding area are still individually dispersed in Cu nanoparticles, confirming its good cycle stability."

     <English>
        Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques, specifically aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM, to characterize the metal-support interfaces in the Pt/Cu propane dehydrogenation catalysts. This provides direct visualization of the isolated Pt atoms dispersed in the Cu nanoparticles.
     </English>
     <Chinese>
        答:是的,本文采用先进的显微技术,即球差校正的HAADF-STEM,来表征Pt/Cu丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-载体界面。这直接显示了分散在Cu纳米粒子中的隔离Pt原子。
