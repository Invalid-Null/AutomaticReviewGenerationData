[1] "In situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra at the Zn K absorption edge were recorded at the P65 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg) in transmission mode."

[2] "For in situ XANES, the S-1_1(H2) catalyst with a sieve fraction of 100-200μm was loaded in an in situ micro-reactor (quartz capillary, 1.5mm diameter, 0.02mm wall thickness34). The sample was heated stepwise to 500°C under 5vol% H2 in He (30ml/min flow rate). Before recording the spectra, the sample was kept at each temperature for 10min."

[3] "In situ diffuse reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements were performed on a Bruker VERTEX 70 equipped with a ZnSe window at a resolution of 4cm-1 from 600cm-1 to 4,000cm-1." 

[4] "In situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests were performed on Bruker ELEXSYS 500-10/12 X-band cw-spectrometer with a microwave power of 6.3mW, a modulation frequency of 100kHz and modulation amplitude of 5G."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS) to probe oxidation state changes of the catalyst during reaction. It also uses in-situ DRIFTS and EPR spectroscopy to characterize the catalyst structure and active sites.

<quotes>
[1] "The oxidation state of Zn in S-1_1(H2) is +2 as the absorption edge in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum is close to 9,662eV characteristic for ZnO."

[2] "As concluded from the Fourier transformed k2-weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of these catalysts (Fig. 1f), the first and the second shell scatterings at 1.5 and 2.9Å correspond to O and Zn neighbours as in ZnO, respectively."

[3] "To determine if and how the structure of such species in S-1_1(H2) changes upon catalyst treatment in H2 to mimic its state in PDH, the position of the Zn K-absorption edge shifts to lower energy upon heating from 100 to 500°C (Fig. 1g)." 

[4] "In addition, CN in the first ZnO shell decreases from 3 to 2. The intensity in the EXAFS spectra at 1.5Å decreases too (Extended Data Fig. 2c, d). Contrarily, the intensity in the EXAFS spectra at 2.9Å decreases only slightly upon heating to 200°C and does not change with a further temperature rise. Thus, no changes in CN of ZnZn occur upon catalyst reductive treatment."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques like XANES and EXAFS to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows how the Zn oxidation state and coordination environment changes under reaction conditions, indicating reduction of the catalyst and loss of lattice oxygen.
