<quotes>

[1] "The spectra were recorded every 5min automatically." 

[2] "For in situ DRIFTS measurements, bare support or its physical mixture with ZnO (10wt%) was heated to 550C in N2 and then exposed to H2/Ar=1 for 90min."

[3] "For in situ XANES, the S-1_1(H2) catalyst with a sieve fraction of 100200m was loaded in an in situ micro-reactor (quartz capillary, 1.5mm diameter, 0.02mm wall thickness34). The sample was heated stepwise to 500C under 5vol% H2 in He (30mlmin1 flow rate). Before recording the spectra, the sample was kept at each temperature for 10min."
