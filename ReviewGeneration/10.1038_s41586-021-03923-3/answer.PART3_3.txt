[1] "X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra at the Zn K absorption edge were recorded at the P65 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg) in transmission mode."

[2] "For in situ XANES, the S-1_1(H2) catalyst with a sieve fraction of 100-200 μm was loaded in an in situ micro-reactor (quartz capillary, 1.5mm diameter, 0.02mm wall thickness). The sample was heated stepwise to 500C under 5vol% H2 in He (30ml/min flow rate). Before recording the spectra, the sample was kept at each temperature for 10min." 

[3] "In situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests were performed on Bruker ELEXSYS 500-10/12 X-band cw-spectrometer with a microwave power of 6.3mW, a modulation frequency of 100kHz and modulation amplitude of 5G. About 30mg of catalyst were loaded into an in house-developed continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactor, and heated to 550C in flow of Ar. Then the sample was exposed to a flow of H2/Ar=1 (20ml/min) for 1h at 550C. The EPR spectra were recorded at 20C before and after H2 reduction."

[1] "The oxidation state of Zn in S-1_1(H2) is +2 as the absorption edge in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum is close to 9,662eV characteristic for ZnO. Partially reduced ZnOx (defect structure with oxygen vacancies) should be present in MCM-41(H2) (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b)."

[2] "As concluded from the Fourier transformed k2-weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of these catalysts (Fig. 1f), the first and the second shell scatterings at 1.5 and 2.9Å correspond to O and Zn neighbours as in ZnO, respectively." 

[3] "To determine if and how the structure of such species in S-1_1(H2) changes upon catalyst treatment in H2 to mimic its state in PDH. The position of the Zn K-absorption edge shifts to lower energy upon heating from 100 to 500C (Fig. 1g). In addition, CN in the first ZnO shell decreases from 3 to 2. The intensity in the EXAFS spectra at 1.5Å decreases too (Extended Data Fig. 2c, d)."
