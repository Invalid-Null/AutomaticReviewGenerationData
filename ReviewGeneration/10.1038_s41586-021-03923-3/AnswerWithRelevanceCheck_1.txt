         [1] "Using different complementary characterization methods, we identify the decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnOx species."
         
         [2] "The important role of OH groups of the support is demonstrated further."
         
         [3] "Physical mixtures of ZnO and a certain support were prepared as follows. 0.08g of ZnO powder and 0.92 of SiO2-based supports were ground in a mortar for 10min. Afterwards, the resulting mixtures were pressed and sieved to 315710m."

         Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using defective OH groups on the support to react with ZnO to form highly dispersed ZnOx species upon reductive treatment. This is shown to enhance propane dehydrogenation activity compared to bulk ZnO nanoparticles. The article also discusses preparing physical mixtures of ZnO and different silica-based supports by grinding and sieving them to a certain particle size range.

         [1] "X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra at the Zn K absorption edge were recorded at the P65 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg) in transmission mode."
         
         [2] "In situ diffuse reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements were performed on a Bruker VERTEX 70 equipped with a ZnSe window at a resolution of 4cm1 from 600cm1 to 4,000cm1."
         
         [3] "In situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests were performed on Bruker ELEXSYS 500-10/12 X-band cw-spectrometer with a microwave power of 6.3mW, a modulation frequency of 100kHz and modulation amplitude of 5G." 
         
         [4] "For in situ XANES, the S-1_1(H2) catalyst with a sieve fraction of 100200m was loaded in an in situ micro-reactor (quartz capillary, 1.5mm diameter, 0.02mm wall thickness34). The sample was heated stepwise to 500C under 5vol% H2 in He (30mlmin1 flow rate). Before recording the spectra, the sample was kept at each temperature for 10min."
         
         [5] "Transient studies were performed in the temporal analysis of products (TAP-2) reactor, a time-resolved technique with a resolution of around 100s"
