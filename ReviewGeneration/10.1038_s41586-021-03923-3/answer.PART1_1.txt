[1] "Zn-containing catalysts were also tested but show commercially unattractive performance17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27."

[2] "Against the above background, our intention was to offer a preparation method with a potential of large-scale applications using commercially available ZnO and oxidic supports to yield catalysts with industrially relevant activity, durability and selectivity."  

[3] "Using different complementary characterization methods, we identify the decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnOx species."

[4] "The ability of binuclear ZnOx species to lose lattice oxygen upon reductive treatment was independently proven by O2-titration tests with S-1_1(H2) treated in H2 at 550C."

2. The article investigates how the oxidation state and oxygen mobility of ZnO affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that defective OH groups in the support are crucial for forming active binuclear ZnOx species that can lose lattice oxygen upon reduction. O2 titration tests confirm the ability of the binuclear sites to create oxygen vacancies.

[1] "The calculated energy profiles along the minimum energy pathways and the optimized intermediates (AC) and transition states (TS) at the PBE+D3+ZPE level upon PDH on the reduced binuclear ZnOx (blue) and single ZnOx (red) sites on the surface of S-1."

[2] "For the most preferred route (Fig. 2), the first CH bond cleavage occurs on the low-coordinated Znδ+ with a barrier of 1.35eV. The formed n-C3H7 is in a bridged position between two Znδ+ after substituting one ZnO bond of the 3O-coordinated Znδ+ by ZnZn coordination." 

[3] "In comparison with the binuclear ZnOx species, the first CH bond cleavage is favourable on this site, but the whole energy span and the apparent activation barrier are higher, that is, 3.39 versus 2.38eV and 2.14 versus 1.81eV, respectively (Fig. 2). Therefore, single-site ZnOx should be much less active, in agreement with the experimental data (Fig. 1h)."

3. The article proposes a mechanistic pathway for propane dehydrogenation over binuclear ZnOx sites. It describes the first CH bond cleavage occurring on low-coordinated Zn sites with a barrier of 1.35eV. The formed propyl intermediate bridges between two Zn sites. It shows the binuclear sites have lower overall energy span and activation barrier compared to single ZnOx sites.
