[1] "Supported ZnOx species are in situ formed through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C."

[2] "Using different complementary characterization methods, we identify the decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnOx species."

[3] "The important role of OH groups of the support is demonstrated further."  

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using defective OH groups on the support to react with ZnO to form highly dispersed ZnOx species upon reductive treatment. This is shown to enhance propane dehydrogenation activity compared to bulk ZnO nanoparticles.
