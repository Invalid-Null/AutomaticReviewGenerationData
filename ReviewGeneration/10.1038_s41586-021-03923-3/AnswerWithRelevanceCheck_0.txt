      <English>
         Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using defective OH groups on the support to react with ZnO to form highly dispersed ZnOx species upon reductive treatment. This is shown to enhance propane dehydrogenation activity compared to bulk ZnO nanoparticles.

	 [1] "X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra at the Zn K absorption edge were recorded at the P65 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg) in transmission mode."
	 [2] "For in situ XANES, the S-1_1(H2) catalyst with a sieve fraction of 100-200μm was loaded in an in situ micro-reactor (quartz capillary, 1.5mm diameter, 0.02mm wall thickness34). The sample was heated stepwise to 500°C under 5vol% H2 in He (30ml/min flow rate). Before recording the spectra, the sample was kept at each temperature for 10min." 
	 [3] "In situ diffuse reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements were performed on a Bruker VERTEX 70 equipped with a ZnSe window at a resolution of 4cm-1 from 600cm-1 to 4,000cm-1."
	 [4] "In situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests were performed on Bruker ELEXSYS 500-10/12 X-band cw-spectrometer with a microwave power of 6.3mW, a modulation frequency of 100kHz and modulation amplitude of 5G."
	 [5] "Transient studies were performed in the temporal analysis of products (TAP-2) reactor, a time-resolved technique with a resolution of around 100s"
