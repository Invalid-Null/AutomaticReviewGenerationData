         [1] "Physical mixtures of ZnO and a certain support were prepared as follows. 0.08g of ZnO powder and 0.92 of SiO2-based supports were ground in a mortar for 10min. Afterwards, the resulting mixtures were pressed and sieved to 315710m." 

         [2] "A simple method was developed for depositing ZnOx species on the surface of various supports"

         [3] "ZnO and the bare supports tested separately are practically inert. The activity of the physical mixtures depends on the kind of support and pre-treatment"

         [4] "Using different complementary characterization methods, we identify the decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnOx species."

         [5] "The important role of OH groups of the support is demonstrated further."

         Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses preparing physical mixtures of ZnO and different silica-based supports by grinding and sieving them to a certain particle size range. It also develops a method to deposit active ZnOx species on various supports by flowing ZnO vapor over them under reducing conditions. The activity of the resulting catalysts depends on the support and pretreatment method. Defective OH groups on the support are shown to be important for forming highly dispersed and active ZnOx species.

         [1] "In situ diffuse reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements were performed on a Bruker VERTEX 70 equipped with a ZnSe window at a resolution of 4cm-1 from 600cm-1 to 4,000cm-1."

         [2] "For in situ DRIFTS measurements, bare support or its physical mixture with ZnO (10wt%) was heated to 550C in N2 and then exposed to H2/Ar=1 for 90min." 

         [3] "In situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests were performed on Bruker ELEXSYS 500-10/12 X-band cw-spectrometer with a microwave power of 6.3mW, a modulation frequency of 100kHz and modulation amplitude of 5G."

         [4] "Transient studies were performed in the temporal analysis of products (TAP-2) reactor, a time-resolved technique with a resolution of around 100μs"

         [5] "X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra at the Zn K absorption edge were recorded at the P65 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg) in transmission mode."

         [6] "For in situ XANES, the S-1_1(H2) catalyst with a sieve fraction of 100-200μm was loaded in an in situ micro-reactor (quartz capillary, 1.5mm diameter, 0.02mm wall thickness34). The sample was heated stepwise to 500C under 5vol% H2 in He (30ml/min flow rate). Before recording the spectra, the sample was kept at each temperature for 10min."

         [1] "The oxidation state of Zn in S-1_1(H2) is +2 as the absorption edge in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum is close to 9,662eV characteristic for ZnO."

         [2] "The position of the Zn K-absorption edge shifts to lower energy upon heating from 100 to 500C (Fig. 1g)."

         [3] "To determine if and how the structure of such species in S-1_1(H2) changes upon catalyst treatment in H2 to mimic its state in PDH, the position of the Zn K-absorption edge shifts to lower energy upon heating from 100 to 500°C (Fig. 1g). In addition, CN in the first ZnO shell decreases from 3 to 2. The intensity in the EXAFS spectra at 1.5Å decreases too (Extended Data Fig. 2c, d)."

         Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques like XANES and EXAFS to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It provides examples of tracking the oxidation state of Zn during H2 treatment to mimic catalytic conditions, showing partial reduction of Zn species and changes in coordination environment indicating the formation of oxygen vacancies.
