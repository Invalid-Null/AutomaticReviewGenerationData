[1] "Physical mixtures of ZnO and a certain support were prepared as follows. 0.08g of ZnO powder and 0.92 of SiO2-based supports were ground in a mortar for 10min. Afterwards, the resulting mixtures were pressed and sieved to 315710m."

[2] "A simple method was developed for depositing ZnOx species on the surface of various supports"

[3] "ZnO and the bare supports tested separately are practically inert. The activity of the physical mixtures depends on the kind of support and pre-treatment"

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses preparing physical mixtures of ZnO and different silica-based supports by grinding and sieving them to a certain particle size range. It also develops a method to deposit active ZnOx species on various supports by flowing ZnO vapor over them under reducing conditions. The activity of the resulting catalysts depends on the support and pretreatment method.

[1] "In situ diffuse reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements were performed on a Bruker VERTEX 70 equipped with a ZnSe window at a resolution of 4cm1 from 600cm1 to 4,000cm1."

[2] "In situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests were performed on Bruker ELEXSYS 500-10/12 X-band cw-spectrometer with a microwave power of 6.3mW, a modulation frequency of 100kHz and modulation amplitude of 5G." 

[3] "Transient studies were performed in the temporal analysis of products (TAP-2) reactor, a time-resolved technique with a resolution of around 100s"

[4] "X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra at the Zn K absorption edge were recorded at the P65 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg) in transmission mode."

[1] "The oxidation state of Zn in S-1_1(H2) is +2 as the absorption edge in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum is close to 9,662eV characteristic for ZnO."

[2] "As concluded from the Fourier transformed k2-weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of these catalysts (Fig. 1f), the first and the second shell scatterings at 1.5 and 2.9Å correspond to O and Zn neighbours as in ZnO, respectively."

[3] "To determine if and how the structure of such species in S-1_1(H2) changes upon catalyst treatment in H2 to mimic its state in PDH, the position of the Zn K-absorption edge shifts to lower energy upon heating from 100 to 500C (Fig. 1g)."

<English version answer> 
6. Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques like XANES and EXAFS to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows that Zn is in +2 oxidation state initially, but becomes partially reduced upon heating in H2, indicating the formation of oxygen vacancies during PDH conditions.
