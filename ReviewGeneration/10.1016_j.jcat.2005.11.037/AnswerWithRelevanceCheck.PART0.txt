 Unfortunately, based on my assessment, the provided answers do not contain information relevant to the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation for propylene production. The answers state that the given literature focuses narrowly on propane activation mechanisms over Zn/MFI zeolite catalysts and does not provide background or details related to the broader context of propane dehydrogenation that were asked about.

Since the answers clearly indicate a lack of relevance to the questions posed, I will simply respond:

※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※
