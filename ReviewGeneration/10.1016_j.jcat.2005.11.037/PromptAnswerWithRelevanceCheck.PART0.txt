<Answer>

 Unfortunately, this literature does not provide background information on propylene production through propane dehydrogenation or discuss its applications and value in the chemical industry. The article is focused on investigating the mechanisms of propane activation specifically over Zn/MFI zeolite catalysts using NMR and IR spectroscopy. 

As such, there are no relevant quotes for questions 1-7 about propylene production, catalyst facilitation of propane dehydrogenation, major catalyst classes explored, thermodynamic constraints, DFT calculations, microkinetic modeling, or structure-activity relationships.

 Unfortunately, the given literature does not provide clear answers to the specific questions asked about the importance and applications of propylene, catalyst mechanisms for propane dehydrogenation, major catalyst classes explored, thermodynamic and kinetic factors, DFT calculations, microkinetic modeling, or structure-activity relationships. 

The literature focuses narrowly on studying the mechanisms of propane activation over Zn/H-MFI catalysts using NMR and IR spectroscopy. It does not provide background information, quantitative details, or modeling results related to the broader context of propane dehydrogenation and propylene production.
