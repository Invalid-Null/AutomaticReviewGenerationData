 Unfortunately, this literature does not provide background information on propylene production through propane dehydrogenation or discuss its applications and value in the chemical industry. The article is focused on investigating the mechanisms of propane activation specifically over Zn/MFI zeolite catalysts using NMR and IR spectroscopy. 

As such, there are no relevant quotes for questions 1-7 about propylene production, catalyst facilitation of propane dehydrogenation, major catalyst classes explored, thermodynamic constraints, DFT calculations, microkinetic modeling, or structure-activity relationships.
