[1] "The development of in situ MAS NMR spectroscopic techniques [11] has allowed monitoring of the catalytic transformations directly on a catalyst surface during the course of the reaction. These techniques have turned out to be very informative in the mechanistic catalytic studies over heterogeneous catalysts, particularly zeolite catalysts."

[2] "13C MAS NMR measurements were carried out on ADX-200 and ADVANCE DSX400 Bruker spectrometers operating at 50.3 and 100.6 MHz, respectively. Quantitative conditions were achieved using high-power gated proton decoupling with suppressed NOE effect (90 pulse, 6 s recycle delay)." 

[3] "IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Protg FTIR spectrometer at 4 cm1 optical resolution with one level of zero-filling for the Fourier transform."

[4] "Application of in situ 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy has enabled identification of the proposed detailed bifunctional mechanism of propane activation over Ga-modified acidic MFI zeolite [11](a), [11](c), [11](e), [12]. This mechanism implies synergetic action of acidic and (Ga3+O2) ion pair sites in the formation of the protonated pseudocyclopropane (PPCP) intermediate, which further decomposes into propene and dihydrogen, methane and ethene or recombines back to propane [11](a), [11](c), [11](e), [12]."

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in situ NMR and infrared (IR) spectroscopic techniques to study propane activation on Zn/H-MFI catalysts. It uses 13C magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR on spectrometers operating at 50.3 and 100.6 MHz to detect species formed at the initial stages of the reaction. IR spectroscopy is also used to probe changes in OH groups and identify zinc propyl species formed during propane conversion. The techniques provide evidence that propane undergoes dissociative adsorption on zinc oxide sites to form zinc propyl species and ZnOH groups.
