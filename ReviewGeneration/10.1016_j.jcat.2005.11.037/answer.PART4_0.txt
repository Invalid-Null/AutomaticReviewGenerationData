 Unfortunately, after carefully reviewing the literature, I did not find any relevant quotes or information to answer the questions provided. The literature is focused on describing the initial stages of propane activation over a Zn/MFI catalyst studied by NMR and IR spectroscopic techniques. It does not discuss process intensification, techno-economic analysis, safety issues, remaining challenges, computational methods, characterization tools, or new catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation specifically.

As there were no relevant quotes, I have provided the following answers:
