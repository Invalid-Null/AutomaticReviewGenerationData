[1] "The results were accounted for by propane dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide species."

[2] "The mechanism proposed for propane activation involves propane dissociation, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen."  

[3] "Propene further oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the Zn/MFI catalysts studied. It suggests propane first undergoes dissociative adsorption on zinc oxide species to form propyl species. Then propene evolves via dehydrogenation, along with recombinative desorption of hydrogen. The propene can further oligomerize on acidic sites, while the hydrogen can participate in propane hydrogenolysis.
</English version answer>

[1] "The results of 13C MAS NMR and IR spectroscopic in situ studies point to the formation of zinc propyl and ZnOH groups at the onset of propane reaction over Zn/H-MFI catalysts with high zinc content."

[2] "The results were accounted for by propane dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide species."

[3] "The mechanism proposed for propane activation involves propane dissociation, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen."

[4] "At low partial pressure of the reactants, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution is favoured, whereas at high pressures, implied under NMR batch conditions, the hydrogenolysis route is preferred."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the studied zinc-modified H-MFI zeolite catalysts. The key steps described are:

1) Dissociative adsorption of propane over zinc oxide species to form zinc propyl species and ZnOH groups. 

2) Dehydrogenation of the zinc propyl species to form propene and dihydrogen. 

3) Recombinative desorption of the dihydrogen.

4) Propene evolution and further oligomerization over acidic sites.

The relative rates of hydrogen evolution vs hydrogenolysis to form ethane and methane depend on the partial pressure.
