[1] "The results were accounted for by propane dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide species."

[2] "The mechanism proposed for propane activation involves propane dissociation, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen."  

[3] "Propene further oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the Zn/MFI catalysts studied. It suggests propane first undergoes dissociative adsorption on zinc oxide species to form propyl species. Then propene evolves via dehydrogenation, along with recombinative desorption of hydrogen. The propene can further oligomerize on acidic sites, while the hydrogen can participate in propane hydrogenolysis.

答:是的,本文为所研究的Zn/MFI催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢的机理场景。它认为丙烷首先在氧化锌物种上发生解离吸附形成丙基物种。然后,通过脱氢生成丙烯,同时发生氢的重组解吸。丙烯可以在酸性位点上进一步低聚,而氢可以参与丙烷加氢裂解。

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic pathway for propane dehydrogenation over the Zn/MFI catalysts studied. As quoted, it suggests propane first dissociates, then propene evolves along with hydrogen recombinative desorption. The propene can further oligomerize on acidic sites, while the hydrogen can participate in hydrogenolysis reactions.
