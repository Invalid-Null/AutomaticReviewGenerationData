[1] "The development of in situ MAS NMR spectroscopic techniques [11] has allowed monitoring of the catalytic transformations directly on a catalyst surface during the course of the reaction. These techniques have turned out to be very informative in the mechanistic catalytic studies over heterogeneous catalysts, particularly zeolite catalysts."

[2] "13C MAS NMR measurements were carried out on ADX-200 and ADVANCE DSX400 Bruker spectrometers operating at 50.3 and 100.6 MHz, respectively. Quantitative conditions were achieved using high-power gated proton decoupling with suppressed NOE effect (90 pulse, 6 s recycle delay)." 

[3] "IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Protg FTIR spectrometer at 4 cm1 optical resolution with one level of zero-filling for the Fourier transform."

[4] "Application of in situ 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy has enabled identification of the proposed detailed bifunctional mechanism of propane activation over Ga-modified acidic MFI zeolite [11](a), [11](c), [11](e), [12]. This mechanism implies synergetic action of acidic and (Ga3+O2) ion pair sites in the formation of the protonated pseudocyclopropane (PPCP) intermediate, which further decomposes into propene and dihydrogen, methane and ethene or recombines back to propane [11](a), [11](c), [11](e), [12]."

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in situ solid-state NMR and infrared spectroscopy to study propane activation over Zn/H-MFI catalysts. It shows these techniques can provide detailed information on catalytic mechanisms and transient intermediates like zinc propyl species formed during the reaction. The data reveals propane undergoes dissociative adsorption on zinc oxide sites to form propylene and hydrogen.
