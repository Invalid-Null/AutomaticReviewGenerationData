Structured Bifunctional Catalysts for CO2 Activation and Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane
Abstract
The direct ink writing of metal oxide/ZSM-5 inks has been developed and is used to structure bifunctional catalysts for CO2 reduction in tandem with propane dehydrogenation. The structured catalysts of (i) H-ZSM-5 (with two different Si/Al ratios of 50 and 280), (ii) 4 wt % Ga2O3/ZSM-5, (iii) 1.3 wt % Ga2O31.3 wt % V2O51.3 wt % ZrO2/ZSM-5, (iv) 0.7 wt % Cr2O31.1 wt % Ga2O31.1 wt % V2O51.1 wt % ZrO2/ZSM-5, (v) 2 wt % Ga2O32 wt % V2O5/ZSM-5, and (vi) 1 wt % Cr2O31.5 wt % Ga2O31.5 wt % V2O5/ZSM-5 have been synthesized and characterized by N2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, H2-TPR, and NH3-TPD. The structured bifunctional catalysts have microporous, mesoporous, and macroporous structures that generate a higher specific surface area and enhanced molecular mass transfer of reactants and products from the active sites. A fixed bed reactor was used to assess the effects of structuring bifunctional catalysts on a process that uses CO2 as a soft oxidant for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene at 550 C and space velocity of 4500 mL/gcat·h for 6 h time-on-stream. The CO2-ODHP experiments with CO2 revealed the best performance over 2 wt % Ga2O32 wt % V2O5/ZSM-5, which achieved 35% propane conversion and 94% propylene selectivity. Also, it is worth noting that all structured bifunctional catalysts showed zero production of BTX both with and without CO2 and minimal deactivation after 6 h when CO2 was present, but displayed varying degrees of deactivation when CO2 was absent. Effectively, these results signified the importance of CO2 as an oxidant over these materials, as they mitigated coke formation and led to exceptional long-term stabilities. Overall, this study reports a new formulation of directly printed oxide/ZSM-5 structured bifunctional catalysts and provides a deeper understanding of the exciting materials generated by this new method.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Given its extensive use as a precursor for many commodity chemicals, including plastics, various aromatic carbons, and fuel sources, propylene is one of the most important compounds in the petrochemical industry. (1,2) Traditional propylene synthesis is performed via thermal steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons, such as naphtha cracking, which is both energy-intensive and produces a high amount of greenhouse emissions. (26) In recent years, one attractive alternative for propylene synthesis has been oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODHP) over heterogeneous catalysts, including boron nitride/oxide/silica, (7) Cr/SiO2, (8) and various oxide/zeolite composites. To date, some of the most common materials used for this reaction have been various metal oxidessuch as Cr, V, Ga, and Zrdoped onto a H-ZSM-5 zeolite. (912) This combination of materials is particularly effective for ODHP because the zeolites acid sites promote initial H2 removal from propane, whereas the metals mixture of oxidation states and acid/base sites promote bond reformation and enhanced olefin selectivity. Besides, propane dehydrogenation over such heterogeneous catalysts has also gathered significant attention as a propylene manufacturing route because it allows CO2 to act as a light oxidant in the reactionary feedstock, (13,14) which is a promising means of utilizing a harmful greenhouse gas for the production of marketable commodity chemicals. As is generally accepted, however, such catalysts should be formed into structured contactors for use in industrial reactionary columns to eliminate scattering, improve packing, and reduce coke formation. (2,15,16)
For use in industrial reactor columns, heterogeneous catalysts are most often formed into pellets or granules, as these formulation processes are rapid and allow for a high manufacturing output. Nevertheless, columns packed with pellets or granules display considerable pressure drops, on account of the impedance to fluid flow imparted by the tightly packed bed designs, which give rise to elevated process energy costs. (17,18) To address this issue, structured monolithic catalysts with open channel design have been developed extensively over the past few decades, as the honeycombed geometry allows for a resistance-free fluid flow and therefore yields reduced pressure drops, lower energy costs, and enhanced mass transfer. (15,19) When formulating structured monolithic catalysts, the hydraulic extrusion technique, where the catalyst components are bound to an inert binder and pressed through a machined mold to generate the desired geometry, has been the standard way of manufacturing. (20,21) Although this process does allow for high manufacturing output and tunable catalyst loading, extrusions dependency on mold production has drawn extensive criticism because new molds must be machined should the reactor geometry ever be modified, which drives up operating costs. Ergo, developing an alternative way of structuring catalytic monoliths which does not require mold use is an important area of catalysis research.
In recent years, a cutting-edge way of generating structured monolithic catalysts has been to utilize additive manufacturing [i.e., three-dimensional (3D) printing] technology. Additive manufacturing is an especially attractive structurization route because unlike hydraulic extrusion, 3D printing allows for the monolith geometry to be digitally designed, thus eliminating the need for extrusion molds and reducing manufacturing costs. Conventionally, printed structured bifunctional monolithic catalysts have been formulated either (i) by utilizing secondary growth to generate thin oxide coatings on the printed support surfaces (22,23) or (ii) by dissolving a nitrate precursor into the printing pastes and calcining the metal salt to generate oxide dopants. (2427) Between these approaches, secondary growth is less common and less attractive than nitrate printing, as this technique generates a great deal of chemical waste and does not yield desirable contact between the active support and secondary dopant. On the other hand, nitrate salt printing, otherwise referred to as incipient impregnation leads to a better dispersion of the oxide component; however, it is only capable of loading up to 10 wt % metal because the inks become supersaturated with dissolved salt above this threshold, making them unprintable. Therefore, neither incipient impregnation nor secondary growth exhibit the desired freedom in heterogeneous catalyst designs and it is worth exploring the emerging techniques.
Recently, we reported a novel alternative to traditional catalyst printing which overcame the limitations of both incipient impregnation and secondary growth approaches. Specifically, we reported a third route of catalyst printing where insoluble metal oxides can be dispersed alongside ZSM-5 within a single printing paste to form a stable rheology, thereby allowing for loadings beyond the 10 wt % threshold and generating desirable contact between the various active species. Not only did this new method allow for oxide loadings up to 85 wt %, but it also gave rise to catalysts with exceptional stability, olefin selectivity, and reactant conversion across multiple reactions, including ODHP and n-hexane cracking. (2830) Specifically looking at ODHP, one of our recent studies reported that printing a catalyst containing a mixture of 5 wt % Cr, 10 wt % Ga, 10 wt % V, and 10 wt % Zr oxides balanced against 65 wt % ZSM-5 could achieve 40% propane conversion, 95% propylene selectivity, zero BTX production, and no deactivation at 550 C over 6 h. (29) In this regard, the catalysts produced by this new printing method can be considered exceptionally promising materials for industrial reactionary processes. Be that as it may, because of these materials novelty, their behavior for any reaction has not yet been thoroughly documented, and therefore, it is worth developing new iterations of directly printed oxide/ZSM-5 catalysts to understand the underlying factors which impact their reactionary performances.
Given that the activities of heterogeneous catalysts arise from both the zeolite and metal oxide components, it can be reasonably expected that modifying the zeolitic ZSM-5 Si/Al ratio and manipulating the oxides concentrations will lead to considerable differences in reactivity. Ergo, these properties are worth exploring in efforts to better understand the directly printed oxide/ZSM-5 catalysts. Motivated by the potential to further develop our directly printed oxide/ZSM-5 structured bifunctional monolithic catalysts, in this study we generated another iteration of these materials with reduced oxide loadings and a different variant of H-ZSM-5. Specifically, we 3D-printed a bare ZSM-5 structured monolith without any dopant (ZSM-5) as well as structured monoliths with 4 wt % Ga2O3 (Ga4/ZSM-5), 2 wt % Ga2O3, 2 wt % V2O5 (Ga2V2/ZSM-5), 1.3 wt % Ga2O3, 1.3 wt % V2O5, 1.3 wt % ZrO2 (Ga1.3V1.3Zr1.3/ZSM-5), 1 wt % Cr2O3, 1.5 wt % Ga2O3, 1.5 wt % V2O5 (Cr1Ga1.5V1.5/ZSM-5), 0.7 wt % Cr2O3, 1.1 wt % Ga2O3, 1.1 wt % V2O5, and 1.1 wt % ZrO2 (Cr0.7Ga1.1V1.1Zr1.1/ZSM-5) balanced with ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 280). The samples were again characterized by N2 physisorption, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and their performances for propane dehydrogenation were assessed with and without CO2 at 550 C for 6 h. Once again, the structured monolithic catalysts in this study showed an exceptional long-term stability and propylene selectivity. Of the various samples, the best behavior was observed for Ga2V2/ZSM-5, which achieved 35% propane conversion and 94% propylene selectivity. Overall, the results in this study further develop directly printed oxide/ZSM-5 structured bifunctional catalysts and demonstrate that small changes in their composition can lead to pronounced differences in their catalytic activity.

Materials
The following materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used in their acquired purities for structured monolith formulation without modification: Cr2O3 (98%, CAS: 1308-38-9), V2O5 (97%, CAS: 1314-62-1), ZrO2 (99%, CAS: 1314-23-4), Ga2O3 (99%, CAS: 12024-21-4), bentonite clay, and methylcellulose. H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 280) was purchased from Zeolyst International. All UHP gases were purchased from Airgas.
Structured Bifunctional Catalyst (Monoliths) Formation
The paste ratios in Table 1 were 3D printed to form structured monolithic catalysts using the techniques described in our recent publications. (2830) As before, 10 mL of distilled water was the only solvent required to formulate a printable rheology, where a printable rheology was considered to be one with self-standing behavior, good retention of solvent, and separation of printed layers. The pastes were rolled for 48 h prior to printing to achieve homogeneity and were densified at 400 rpm at 60 C for 3 h to reach a printable rheology. After printing, the samples were dried for 24 h at 25 C to remove the remaining water and prevent cracking, followed by calcination in air at 750 C (heating rate = 10 C/min) for 6 h.

Characterization
Themonoliths crystalline structures were assessed via XRD on a PANalytical XPert multipurpose X-ray diffractometer with a scan step size of 0.02/step at the rate of 137.2 s/step from 5 < 2θ < 50. XRF was conducted on an Oxford X-Supreme 8000 XRF under with a tungsten X-ray tube under both light and heavy element operational modes. For the light elements, He was purged through the system, whereas the heavier transition elements were assessed using air. The samples textural properties were assessed via N2 physisorption on a Micromeritics (3Flex) gas analyzer at 77 K. The surface area and pore volume were calculated from the N2 physisorption data using the BrunauerEmmetTeller (BET) and non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) methods, respectively. The samples were degassed on a Micromeritics Smart VacPrep system for 6 h under vacuum at 350 C prior to analysis. NH3-TPD and H2-TPR were both performed on 3Flex using a method which was outlined in our previous works. (25,31) The gathered H2-TPR and NH3-TPD profiles were the changes in ionization intensity (e.g., ionization current) gathered from an MKS Cirrus 2 Mass Spectrometer for water and ammonia, respectively.
Catalysis Experiments
The structured performances of the monolithic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation were assessed with and without CO2 at 550 C at WHSV = 4500 mL/gcat·h for 6 h. Here, it should be noted that these conditions were found to generate the best balance of propane conversion and propylene selectivity in our earlier works, (29,30) and hence, they were kept constant in this study to compare the performance of the new catalyst formulations. The reactor bed dimensions were inner diameter 10 mm × 2 cm height. The individual monoliths were 0.2 g (approximately 1 cm tall and 0.9 cm outer diameter) and were packed into the bed on both sides with quartz wool to prevent bypass of the reactant through the structural channels. The effluent product concentrations were analyzed every 30 min using an in-line gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with FID-TCD detectors. The full set of pretreatment conditions and experimental setup can be found in our recent publications, (29,30) and they were held constant here to allow for comparison between the various materials ODHP performances. Here, it should be noted that the dilutant for all reactions was UHP N2, which was used to ensure that the same feed of propane was used with and without CO2. The structured monolithic catalysts were collected after their reactions, and the coke concentrations were analyzed by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) on a Q500 TGA from TA instruments. Therein, the sample was heated at 10 C/min from 25900 C under 60 mL/min of air to determine the coking differences between the ODHP reactionary modes at 550 C. The rates of propylene productivity were calculated from the reactionary data by eq 1
(1)
where the factor of 10,000 arises from converting the percent propane conversion and propylene selectivity back into their decimal values, while the factor of 1 mol/22.4 L arises from converting the volumetric propane flow into a molar flow. It is also worth noting here that the propane conversion and product selectivities can be reported with or without the CO2, CO, H2, and H2O species. In our earlier work, we did not report these species and only reported the effluent CxHy compounds. The same format of presentation was used here to be consistent with our earlier works and to allow for better comparison between samples. That said, when CO2 was present, N2, CO2, H2, CO, CH4, C2H4, C3H6, H2O, and C3H8 were detected in the effluent stream, whereas N2, H2, CO, CH4, C2H4, C3H6, H2O, and C3H8 were present when CO2 was absent.

Printed Structured Monolithic Catalyst Characterization
The XRD spectra of the structured monolithic catalysts are shown in Figure 1. As evident, all samples displayed major diffractive indices that were identical to the bare H-ZSM-5. This signified that (i) the ZSM-5 crystalline structure was not affected by mixing with the low-concentration oxides and (ii) that most of the bulk phase within the composite structured monolithic catalysts was H-ZSM-5. Compared to our recent works, (29,30) this retention was expected for Ga4/ZSM-5, as we previously demonstrated that there are no interactions between Ga2O3 and H-ZSM-5 during calcination. However, the retained indices were not expected for the vanadium-containing samples, as our recent studies both indicated that calcining vanadium alongside H-ZSM-5 can lead to dealumination of the zeolite and decomposition of the crystalline structure. In particular, elevated V2O5 loadings have been shown to cause dealumination of the ZSM-5 and losses in diffractive indices throughout the XRD spectra, especially at 2θ = 7.5, 10, 22.5, and 25. Granted, here, the vanadium concentrations were reduced from 15 to 1.12 wt %, and therefore, the XRD pattern in Figure 1 suggests that ZSM-5 dealumination requires a higher concentration of V2O5 than is present here. As such, from Figure 1, it was concluded that the oxide particles were well dispersed within the bulk phase and that decreasing the metal oxide loading from 15 wt % promotes better ZSM-5 structural retention.

The XRF spectra of the structured monolithic catalysts are shown in Figure 2. As can be seen from Figure 2a, the light elements relative peak intensities were nearly identical across the six monoliths. This was unsurprising given that the light elements present in the sample were aluminum and silicon, which were contained in the ZSM-5 and therefore comprised most of the bulk phase. As would be expected, the Si concentration (Si = 1.9 keV (32)) was much greater than the Al concentration (Al = 1.5 keV (32)) for all samples, which was attributed to the high Si/Al ratio of 280 within ZSM-5. From detection of the heavier metals (Figure 2b), it could be clearly observed that the bare sample contained no representative peaks for any transition element as was anticipated. Between the metal-doped structured monoliths, vanadium addition produced small peaks at 4.9 and 5.1 keV, (33) zirconium addition produced peaks at 16 and 17.5 keV, (34) and chromium addition produced a peak centered at 5.4 keV. Meanwhile, gallium doping produced peaks centered at 9.2 and 10.2 keV. (35) Overlaying the gallium peaks (Figure 2c) revealed that the gallium concentration descended in the following order: Ga4/ZSM-5 > Ga2V2/ZSM-5 > Cr1Ga1.5V1.5/ZSM-5 Cr0.7Ga1.1V1.1Zr1.1/ZSM-5  Ga1.3V1.3Zr1.3/ZSM-5 > ZSM-5. This order was essentially consistent with the Ga2O3 loadings used in paste formulation (Table 1). Such retention of the metal oxide loadings not only signified that there was no species leeching during the calcination step, but also indicated that the various dopants were well dispersed during paste formulation. Therefore, it was concluded from the XRF spectra in Figure 2 that direct oxide/ZSM-5 3D printing allows for precise control of the metal dopant concentrations, as the final metal loadings present were in agreement with the original ink compositions.

N2 physisorption was used to assess the textural properties of the structured monolithic catalysts. The N2 physisorption isotherms are displayed in Figure 3a,b, and the pore distributions are shown in Figure 3c,d. The corresponding textural properties are summarized in Table 2. As evident, all six samples exhibited type-II physisorption isotherms with type-H4 hysteresis. These physisorption behaviors were consistent with the IUPAC profiles for microporous materials (36) and were expected because the bulk phase (ZSM-5) is a microporous zeolite. This microporosity was further supported by the samples pore size distributions, where the pore space was clearly observed just above 2.0 nm. Granted, the micropore was observed at 2.5 nm instead of 2.0 nm; however, this is a byproduct of the NLDFT technique and does not represent the presence of a mesoporous zeolite. This conclusion is further supported by the samples textural properties in Table 2, where 50% of the monoliths pore space was allocated to the microporous regime. Granted, the monoliths did display a considerable amount of mesopore volume, but said volume arises from bentonite clay as well as from the oxides themselves, as these particular metals are known to be somewhat mesoporous. (3739) Between the individual samples, the textural properties were essentially constant regardless of the metal dopant present. This indicated that the surface area and pore volumes were unaffected by the metal dopants and there were minimal interactions between the various species during calcination. This being the case, there was a slight reduction in surface area and pore volume for Ga2V2/ZSM-5, which may have arisen from slight ZSM-5 dealumination by V2O5. (29,30) However, given that the samples XRD pattern indicated retention of the bulk zeolite crystallinity, it was concluded that these interactions were minimal. As such, it was concluded from Figure 3 that directly printing oxide/ZSM-5 with reduced oxide loadings leads to better H-ZSM-5 retention compared to high-concentration oxide printing, especially in the presence of V2O5.

Structured Monolithic Catalyst Surface Acidities
The surface acidities of the structured monolithic catalysts were assessed using NH3-TPD, as shown in Figure 4. As evident, all structured monolithic catalysts displayed a major peak below 250 C, which can be ascribed to the weak acid sites. In fact, this was the only peak present in Ga2V2/ZSM-5 and Ga1.3V1.3Zr1.3/ZSM-5, indicating that these samples were composed entirely of weak acid sites. Given that the bare ZSM-5 also displayed a broad peak at 550 C, which can be ascribed to strong acid sites, these effects indicated that doping small amounts of Ga2O3V2O5 or Ga2O3V2O5ZrO2 decreased the zeolites acidity. This reduced acidity can likely be attributed to V2O5 addition, given that Ga4/ZSM-5 displayed a similar concentration of strong acid sites to the bare ZSM-5 sample. Granted, the presence of strong acid sites in Cr0.7Ga1.1V1.1Zr1.1/ZSM-5 and Cr1Ga1.5V1.5/ZSM-5 seems to contradict this notion; however, these samples elevated acidities can be attributed to Cr2O3 doping, as chromium is known to contain a high concentration of strong acid sites. (25) This is further supported by the increased peak intensity for Cr1Ga1.5V1.5/ZSM-5 from Cr0.7Ga1.1V1.1Zr1.1/ZSM-5, which corresponds to the formers elevated chromia concentration. Therefore, on the basis of these results, the samples acidities were approximated in the following order: Cr1Ga1.5V1.5/ZSM-5 > Cr0.7Ga1.1V1.1Zr1.1/ZSM-5 > Ga4/ZSM-5 > Ga1.3V1.3Zr1.3/ZSM-5  ZSM-5  Ga2V2/ZSM-5.

Structured Monolithic Catalyst Redox Properties
The redox properties of the structured monolithic catalysts were assessed using H2-TPR, as shown in Figure 5. First, it should be noted that all samples displayed a reductive peak at 150 C, which has previously been ascribed to H2 reaction into H2O over zeolitic OH clusters. (40,41) It should be clarified here that this reaction solely occurs between OH functional groups on the ZSM-5 surface and does not stem from the reduction of the zeolite, itself. It is also worth noting that the bare ZSM-5 displayed an additional peak centered at 425 C; however, the peaks low intensity relative to the low-temperature peak likely indicated that it could be attributed to residual water desorption from the bentonite binder. In all of the gallium-containing samples, an additional peak was observed at 700 C, which could be attributed to the reduction of bulk Ga2O3 into Ga2O. (25,29) In Ga2V2/ZSM-5, Cr1Ga1.5V1.5/ZSM-5, and Ga1.3V1.3Zr1.3/ZSM-5, a peak was also present at 560 C, which has been ascribed to V2O5 reduction into V6O13. (42) Notably, these reductions occurred at a considerably lower temperature compared to their literary counterparts (650 C), (2830) suggesting that there may be some synergetic effect presented in this iteration of our printed structured bifunctional monoliths. Finally, the chromium-containing samples displayed small peaks in and around 400 C, which could be attributed to the reduction of Cr(IV) species. (25) Overall, the results from Figure 5 indicate that the samples redox properties were similar but were affected slightly by the individual metal dopants.

Catalytic Evaluation
The performances of the structured bifunctional monolithic catalysts at 550 C in the presence of CO2 over 6 h are shown in Figure 6, whereas the corresponding catalytic data are summarized in Table 3. First, it should be noted here that all samples showed a higher CO2 conversion compared to the propane consumption, which could be attributed to additional CO2 reaction via the Boudouard and reverse watergas shift reactions. (2) More importantly, all oxide/ZSM-5 structured monoliths outperformed the bare H-ZSM-5 sample (Figure 6a), which was attributed to the additional active sites imparted by the various metals lattice oxygens and thoroughly demonstrated the need for heterogeneity in directly printed structured monolithic catalysts. It is also worth noting that the bare ZSM-5 structured monolith with a Si/Al ratio of 280 displayed a lower propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to the bare ZSM-5 structured monolith reported in our recent works with Si/Al ratio of 50. (29,30) This signified that, for ODHP reaction, it is preferable to print with ZSM-5 that has an Si/Al ratio of 50 and not of 280. Of course, this comparison just considers two Si/Al ratios, so it is possible that the optimal value could lie between these two values or could even be lower than 50. Between the various metal-doped samples, the samples achieved between 32 and 42% propane conversion and 5091% propylene selectivity, where the best performance was observed in Ga2V2/ZSM-5 (Figure 6c). The maximal balance of propane conversion and propylene selectivity was observed in Cr0.7Ga1.1V1.1Zr1.1/ZSM-5 (Figure 6f); however, because the sample showed signs of deactivation after 4 h, Ga2V2/ZSM-5 was concluded to be the better overall catalyst. Indeed, this was supported by the calculated propylene productivities (Table 3), where the catalysts could be ranked in the order of Ga2V2/ZSM-5 > Cr0.7Ga1.1V1.1Zr1.1/ZSM-5 > Cr1Ga1.5V1.5/ZSM-5 > Ga4/ZSM-5 > Ga1.3V1.3Zr1.3/ZSM-5 > ZSM-5. Harkening back to the H2-TPR profiles, these results were not all that surprising, given that H2-TPR indicated that Ga2V2/ZSM-5 had the highest reductive potential, it should be capable of switching oxidative states and re-oxidizing with CO2. Granted, NH3-TPD also indicated that this sample was also among the least acidic, which suggests that samples with lower strength acid sites may be favorable for propylene production at these particular conditions with ZSM-5 that has an Si/Al ratio of 280.

At the same time, it should also be noted here that although we did optimize the reaction conditions in our earlier works, a great deal of information about the kinetic properties of these materials is still unknown. This area of study is important to understanding where the rate limitation of these materials lies, as this issue is of a high level of complexity and is not something that can easily be determined from the current data. The reason is that our earlier work indicated that the kinetic properties of 3D-printed materials can be divided between the film and molecular regimes. (43) While this work focused on adsorbents, it likely has implications to catalysis because these properties are innate to the printed geometry, as the film rate refers to the mass transfer from the bulk fluid to the monolith surface and is derived from the monolith cell density, while the molecular diffusion rate refers to a gaseous transport within the printed structural wall and is contingent on the structural macropore volume. Regarding catalysis, however, a third area of transport should also be present, as there is additional transport of the reactant between the individual active sites (intrinsic transport). This mode of transport mostly relates to the active site density but also has some dependence on the space between active sites of multiple particles, so the intrinsic transport is also likely contingent upon the rate of molecular diffusion to some degree. Due to the complex nature of these three transport modes, it is difficult to say which regime limits the mass transfer rate of these catalysts. Hence, a separate study should be performed to better understand the kinetic properties of these materials. Having said this, it is worth noting here that, compared to powdered catalysts used under similar conditionssuch as VOx/SiO2 at 450 C (35% C3H8 conversion, 84% C3H6 selectivity), (44) NiO/ZrO2 at 400 C (18% C3H8 conversion, 46% C3H6 selectivity), (45) or Nb2O5/CeO2 at 300 C (18% C3H8 conversion, 16% C3H6 selectivity) (46) the structured catalysts in this study displayed vastly superior propane conversion and propylene selectivity, suggesting that the kinetic rates were higher. Granted, the reaction in this study did occur at a higher temperature than that for the aforementioned powder materials, which should produce a shift toward thermal cracking and reduced propylene selectivity. While this shift clearly occurred for the bare ZSM-5, as is evident by the samples favorable methane selectivity, the shift toward thermal cracking did not occur for the oxide/ZSM-5 composites. Therefore, it could also be concluded from Figure 6 that the catalysts in this study are exceptional materials for ODHP reaction, as they displayed high stability, good olefin selectivity, and improved propane conversion from powdered benchmarks.
The catalytic performances of structured bifunctional monolithic catalysts at 550 C in the absence of CO2 over 6 h are shown in Figure 7, whereas the corresponding catalytic data are summarized in Table 4. Notably, the bare ZSM-5 (Figure 7a) and Ga1.3V1.3Zr1.3/ZSM-5 (Figure 7d) showed vastly enhanced propylene selectivity compared to the runs with CO2. This suggested that these samples could favor olefin production by way of thermal cracking without an oxidant; however, the increased propylene selectivities in these samples likely resulted from a less extent of propane conversion, namely, reducing the extent of propane conversion led to a less amount of methane and ethylene synthesis, yielding inflated propylene selectivities compared to the CO2-containing runs. Indeed, this was supported by the fact that all samples exhibited a 50% reduction in propane conversion compared to the CO2-containing runs, thereby demonstrating that the oxidizer should be present to optimize the dehydrogenation performance of these catalysts. In particular, CO2 reacts with lattice oxygen within the metal dopants to re-oxidize the active sites. Hence, when CO2 is not present, the reactionary mode switches from oxidative dehydrogenation toward thermal dehydrogenation, which is less favorable at the relatively low temperature of 550 C. Granted, given that the performances of the monolithic catalysts were still high without CO2, it is possible that the metal oxide dopants acted as oxidative sources to some degree. Besides, the catalysts still maintained their enhanced performances from powdered benchmarks, (4446) which indicated that these materials can be considered effective for propylene production under both oxidative and nonoxidative reactionary modes. It is also worth noting here that the propylene productivities of the catalysts could be ranked in the order of Ga2V2/ZSM-5 > Ga1.3V1.3Zr1.3/ZSM-5 > ZSM-5 > Cr1Ga1.5V1.5/ZSM-5 > Cr0.7Ga1.1V1.1Zr1.1/ZSM-5 = Ga4/ZSM-5, which differed from the ranking for the CO2-containing runs. These differences in propylene productivities were not surprising, given that different metal mixtures should have varying degrees of effectiveness for H2 removal depending on their lattice oxygen accessibilities. Therefore, it could be definitively concluded from Figure 7 that CO2 is an important component in the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) performances of these catalysts.

The TGA profiles of the structured monolithic catalysts after reaction with and without CO2 are shown in Figure 8. As can be seen, there were slight differences across the samples coking and between the modes of reaction operation. In the bare ZSM-5 (Figure 8a), Ga4/ZSM-5 (Figure 8b), and Ga1.3V1.3Zr1.3/ZSM-5 (Figure 8d) samples, performing the reaction with CO2 led to slightly more coking compared to when CO2 was absent. For the other three structured monolithic catalysts, however, the opposite trend was observed, as Ga2V2/ZSM-5 (Figure 8c), Cr1Ga1.5V1.5/ZSM-5 (Figure 8e), and Cr0.7Ga1.1V1.1Zr1.1/ZSM-5 (Figure 8f) all showed slightly more coking in the CO2-free runs. This being the case, across all six structured monolithic catalysts the amount of coking observed in either mode of operation was extremely small, much to the point that differences between samples could mostly be considered negligible. This signified the ultrahigh stability of these structured monolithic catalysts for ODHP reaction and further indicated the exceptional performance of directly printed oxide/ZSM-5 structured monolithic catalysts.

Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In this work, we assessed the ODHP performance of directly printed oxide/ZSM-5 structured monolithic catalysts with low oxide loading and ZSM-5 Si/Al ratio of 280 with and without CO2 as an oxidant. The reactionary performances revealed the importance of CO2 as an oxidant because all samples displayed lower propane conversion when CO2 was absent. The reaction experiments also indicated the importance of heterogeneity in these printed catalysts because the oxide-containing samples all displayed enhanced propane conversion and propylene selectivity over the bare ZSM-5. Besides, the oxide-containing structured monolithic catalysts displayed exceptional stability, zero production of BTX, and vastly enhanced performance from literary powdered benchmarks, thereby further cementing direct oxide/ZSM-5 printing as a highly effective route of catalyst manufacturing. On the other hand, this study also indicated that an Si/Al ratio of 50 is advantageous compared to 280 for these materials, as the lower ratio produces higher propane conversion with comparable propylene selectivity. Overall, this study further develops directly printed oxide/ZSM-5 catalysts and provides important new understanding of these exciting materials.
