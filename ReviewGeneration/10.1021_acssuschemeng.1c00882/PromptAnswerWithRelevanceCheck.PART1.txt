<Answer>

 Unfortunately this literature does not contain any relevant quotes or information to answer the provided questions. The article focuses on structured bifunctional catalysts made of metal oxides like Ga2O3, V2O5, ZrO2, Cr2O3 supported on zeolite ZSM-5 for CO2 utilization in tandem with propane dehydrogenation to propylene. It does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir. The article also does not provide any mechanistic insights, reaction pathways, intermediates or active sites for propane dehydrogenation over the studied catalysts. Since there is no relevant information in the literature to address the questions, I cannot provide any quotes or substantive answers. Please let me know if you would like me to attempt answering any of the questions based on my own knowledge rather than the provided literature.

[1] "Of the various samples, the best behavior was observed for Ga2V2/ZSM-5, which achieved 35% propane conversion and 94% propylene selectivity."

[2] "Given that the samples XRD pattern indicated retention of the bulk zeolite crystallinity, it was concluded that these interactions were minimal." 

[3] "Between the various metal-doped samples, the samples achieved between 32 and 42% propane conversion and 50­91% propylene selectivity, where the best performance was observed in Ga2V2/ZSM-5 (Figure 6c)."

<English version answer>

Answer: The article does investigate how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It provides examples of how doping ZSM-5 with different metal oxides like Ga2O3, V2O5, ZrO2 affects the redox properties, acidity, crystallinity, and ultimately the conversion and selectivity. The combination of Ga2O3 and V2O5 was found to give the best propane conversion and propylene selectivity.
