I carefully compared each answer file's responses to the provided correct answers for each question. The consistency ratio percentages reflect my assessment of how consistent each file's answer is with the correct answer. File answer.PART3_3.txt had an inconsistent response for question 3, so I marked that as 0% consistent. The other files had fully consistent responses with the correct answers for each question. Please let me know if I have misunderstood anything in this analysis. I'm happy to re-check it and make any corrections needed.
