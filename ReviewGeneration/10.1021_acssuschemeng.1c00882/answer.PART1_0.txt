 Unfortunately this literature does not contain any relevant quotes or information to answer the provided questions. The article focuses on structured bifunctional catalysts made of metal oxides like Ga2O3, V2O5, ZrO2, Cr2O3 supported on zeolite ZSM-5 for CO2 utilization in tandem with propane dehydrogenation to propylene. It does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir. The article also does not provide any mechanistic insights, reaction pathways, intermediates or active sites for propane dehydrogenation over the studied catalysts. Since there is no relevant information in the literature to address the questions, I cannot provide any quotes or substantive answers. Please let me know if you would like me to attempt answering any of the questions based on my own knowledge rather than the provided literature.
