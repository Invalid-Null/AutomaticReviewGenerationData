[1] "Therefore, the development of highly efficient technologies to meet the rising global demand for propylene is greatly desired." 

[2] "Although the direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) has been studied and industrialized for this purpose, high reaction temperatures (typically 650C) are required to obtain a sufficiently high propylene yield due to the processs endothermicity."

[3] "Previous studies on the CO2-ODP focused predominantly on early transition or typical metal oxides (Cr2O3, V2O5, Ga2O3 and In2O3) and late transition metals (Pd and Fe3Ni) as the main active species."

[4] "For all the catalysts, the products were CO, C3H6, C2H4, C2H6, CH4, H2O and H2." 

[5] "The experimental reaction orders were positive and could be higher than unity for P_{C3H8}, while they were negative for P_{CO2}."

<English version answer>

1. The article states that there is a rising global demand for propylene, so developing highly efficient technologies to produce propylene is greatly desired. It provides background on the importance of propylene as a raw material for petrochemicals across several industries.

2. The article explains that catalysts can facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the required reaction temperatures. It states that the direct dehydrogenation of propane is endothermic, so temperatures of 650C are typically needed without a catalyst to achieve good propylene yield. 

3. The article introduces metal oxides like Cr2O3 and V2O5, and metals like Pd and FeNi, that have been explored as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation using CO2.

4. The article lists the products formed during propane dehydrogenation over the catalysts tested, including propylene (C3H6), ethylene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and hydrogen (H2).

5. The article provides quantitative kinetics details, stating the experimental reaction orders were positive for propane partial pressure and negative for CO2 partial pressure. 

6. The article does not describe any DFT calculations applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways.

7. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics.

1. 文章指出丙烯的全球需求量正在增加,所以开发高效的丙烯生产技术非常必要。它阐述了丙烯作为多个行业石化产品的原料的重要性。

2. 文章解释催化剂可以通过降低所需的反应温度来促进丙烷脱氢。它指出丙烷直接脱氢是吸热反应,所以如果不使用催化剂,通常需要650°C的温度才能获得良好的丙烯产率。

3. 文章介绍了Cr2O3和V2O5等金属氧化物,以及Pd和FeNi等金属,这些都被探索用作利用CO2进行丙烷脱氢的催化剂。

4. 文章列出了在测试的催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢时形成的产物,包括丙烯(C3H6)、乙烯(C2H4)、乙烷(C2H6)、甲烷(CH4)、一氧化碳(CO)、二氧化碳(CO2)、水(H2O)和氢(H2)。

5. 文章提供了定量动力学细节,指出丙烷分压的实验反应级数为正,而CO2分压的实验反应级数为负。

6. 文章没有描述应用DFT计算来研究丙烷脱氢机理和途径的内容。

7. 文章没有呈现丙烷脱氢动力学的微观动力学建模。
