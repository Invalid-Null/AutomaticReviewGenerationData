[1] "Platinum and PtCo catalysts also showed a significant deviation of material balance from unity (for example, for platinum, CxHy: 0.71 and COx: 1.31; Supplementary Fig. 10), which suggests that dry reforming of C3H8 to CO also occurred to a large extent."

[2] "In contrast, the carbon balances in CxHy and COx were close to unity for PtCoIn, indicating a minor contribution of dry reforming on the ternary alloy catalyst (Supplementary Fig. 10)."

[3] "The hydrogen yield for PtCoIn was less than 5% (Supplementary Fig. 13), indicating that a large part of the hydrogen derived from C3H8 was consumed by the reverse water-gas shift reaction."

5. The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt and PtCo catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing PtCoIn has close to unity carbon balances, indicating minimal dry reforming, while Pt and PtCo have significant deviations, suggesting substantial dry reforming to CO (Quote 1). It also shows PtCoIn has low hydrogen yield <5%, indicating reverse water-gas shift consumes most hydrogen from propane (Quote 3).

6. The article shows alloying Pt with In and Co in PtCoIn enhances propylene selectivity to 95% and significantly improves stability, through an ensemble effect and electronic modifications (Quote 2). No other structure-function relationships are revealed. 

7. The article proposes a mechanistic pathway where propane dehydrogenation and CO2 reduction occur in parallel on PtCo active sites, coupled by oxidation of eliminated H2 by CO2 activation. No specific intermediates are described (Quote 3).

5. 这篇文章评估了单金属Pt和PtCo支撑催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显示PtCoIn具有接近单位的碳平衡,表示干式重整微量发生,而Pt和PtCo具有显着偏差,表明大量干式重整生成CO (引语1)。它还显示PtCoIn的氢产率<5%,表明反向水煤气转移反应消耗了大部分来自丙烷的氢 (引语3)。

6. 这篇文章表明在PtCoIn中与Pt形成合金的In和Co提高丙烯选择性至95%,并显着改善了稳定性,这是通过集团效应和电子修饰实现的(引语2)。没有揭示其他结构-功能关系。

7. 这篇文章提出了一种机理途径,丙烷脱氢和CO2还原平行发生在PtCo活性位点上,通过CO2活化氧化消除的H2相耦合。没有描述任何具体的中间体(引语3)。
