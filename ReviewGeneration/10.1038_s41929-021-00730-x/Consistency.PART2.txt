 Here is the JSON structure comparing the answer files to the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I analyzed each answer file and compared it to the correct answers provided to determine the consistency percentage for each question. answer0.txt is completely inconsistent, while the other answer files are completely consistent with the correct answers.
