Ternary platinumcobaltindium nanoalloy on ceria as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2
Abstract
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 (CO2-ODP) is a promising technique for high-yield propylene production and CO2 utilization. Unfortunately the efficiency of existing catalysts is limited, and therefore, developing a highly efficient catalyst for CO2-ODP is of great importance for the chemical industry. Here we report a PtCoIn ternary nanoalloy on CeO2 that has a (Pt1xCox)2In3 pseudo-binary alloy structure and exhibits very high catalytic activity, C3H6 selectivity, stability and CO2 utilization efficiency at 550C. Alloying platinum with indium and cobalt significantly improves the C3H6 selectivity and CO2 reduction ability, respectively. The cobalt species provide a high density of states near the Fermi level, which lowers the energy barrier of CO2 reduction. The stability of the catalyst is greatly enhanced by combining the strong CO2 activation ability of the alloy with the oxygen releasing ability of the CeO2 support, which facilitates Marsvan Krevelen-type coke combustion.
Main
Propylene is a very important raw material for the production of a variety of petrochemicals in several industries1. The recent shift in the feedstock for steam crackers from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane has resulted in a significant gap between the limited supply of propylene and its increasing demand globally2. Therefore, the development of highly efficient technologies to meet the rising global demand for propylene is greatly desired3. Although the direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) has been studied and industrialized for this purpose, high reaction temperatures (typically 650C) are required to obtain a sufficiently high propylene yield due to the processs endothermicity4. Furthermore, the harsh conditions inevitably induce severe catalyst deactivation and the thermal decomposition of propylene, limiting the applicability of the approach. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 as a mild oxidant (CO2-ODP: C3H8+CO2C3H6+CO+H2O) is a promising strategy for solving such issues5,6. The equilibrium conversion of propane increases when dry reforming of C3H8 proceeds in parallel (C3H8+3CO26CO+4H2)7,8,9, which can decrease the reaction temperature required to achieve a high propane conversion7. Moreover, CO2 can remove the coke deposited on the catalyst surface via the Boudouard reaction (CO2+C2CO)10. Unlike strong oxidants such as O2, CO2 suppresses the overoxidation of propylene and the catalyst itself, thus potentially providing an efficient catalytic system for propylene production. Moreover, the catalytic conversion of CO2 into a value-added chemical is beneficial for carbon recycling and greenhouse gas reduction11,12.
Previous studies on the CO2-ODP focused predominantly on early transition or typical metal oxides (Cr2O3, V2O5, Ga2O3 and In2O3)5,13,14,15,16 and late transition metals (Pd and Fe3Ni)7,17 as the main active species. Among these materials, chromium oxide species dispersed on mesoporous silica18,19 showed the highest specific activity and good propylene selectivity (80%) at high propane conversion regions. However, these catalysts showed very low CO2 conversion and rapid deactivation within a few hours. Although the transition-metal catalysts exhibited much longer catalytic life, the conversions of propane and CO2 were quite low (typically <12%). In this context, no catalyst has yet been reported that simultaneously exhibits high catalytic activity, selectivity, stability and CO2 utilization efficiency. The challenge is that the catalyst should simultaneously activate both propane and CO2 without undesired side reactions and catalyst deactivation. A multifunctional active material that successfully meets these requirements could serve as an innovative catalyst for the CO2-ODP. Possible candidates are multimetallic alloys20,21,22. A highly efficient CO2-ODP may be realized based on an appropriate combination of elements that can facilitate CH scission and CO2 capture/activation, and inhibit undesired over-dehydrogenation and CC scission.
Motivated by this concept, we designed a ternary alloy catalyst consisting of three different classes of metals to achieve the aforementioned functions in catalysis. Platinum was chosen as the main active metal for the CH scission because it is known to be highly active for CH scission23,24, while it is minimally active for the CC scission compared to other transition metals25. Late 3d transition metals such as cobalt, nickel and copper26,27, which are efficient catalysts for CO2 reduction, were chosen to accelerate CO2 capture and activation. Inert elements such as gallium, indium and tin were considered for their ability to enhance dehydrogenation selectivity, due to the ensemble effect when these are alloyed28. CeO2 was used as the catalyst support to promote CO2 capture and coke combustion due to its basicity and oxygen-releasing ability, respectively7,29. In particular, we show that the combination of platinum, cobalt, indium and CeO2 can afford the multiple functions required to achieve a highly efficient CO2-ODP, that is, a remarkably active, selective and stable catalysis is achieved using a PtCoIn/CeO2 nanoalloy.
Results
Characterization
The PtCoIn/CeO2 (Pt, 3wt%; Pt:Co:In, 1:1:2) catalyst was prepared by a conventional impregnation method using CeO2 as the support. Figure 1a,b shows high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images of PtCoIn/CeO2. Small nanoparticles with diameters of 23nm were mainly observed on the CeO2 support. The mean diameter (\(\overline{\rm{d}}\)=3.9nm, Fig. 1c) was slightly higher than the size of major species because of the presence of a small amount of relatively large particles (1016nm). Recent studies have demonstrated that the reverse water-gas shift reaction30 and propane dehydrogenation31,32 are structure sensitive (smaller particles afford higher activity), suggesting that large particles (>10nm) may make little contribution to the overall reaction rate of the CO2-ODP. The elemental map acquired by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed that the nanoparticles consisted of platinum, cobalt and indium, and some cobalt species were also present outside of the nanoparticles (Fig. 1dh). The Pt:Co:In atomic ratios of the nanoparticles (regions 14, designated by dashed yellow squares in Fig. 1a,b) were approximately 1:0.5:2 (Fig. 1i), where the cobalt content was lower than that supplied in the catalyst preparation (Pt:Co:In=1:1:2).

Therefore, some of the cobalt species appear not to be included in the nanoparticles and are highly dispersed on the CeO2 support. Figure 1j shows an HAADF-STEM image of a single PtCoIn nanoparticle, where a crystal structure with interplanar distances of 2.28 and 2.29Å was observed. These values were close to those of the (110) and (102) planes of intermetallic Pt2In3 (Fig. 1j,k)33. Because the atomic ratio of (Pt+Co):In is close to 2:3 (2:2.7), the nanoparticles probably have a (Pt1xCox)2In3 pseudo-binary alloy structure, where some platinum atoms in Pt2In3 are substituted by cobalt (Fig. 1l). We also performed an X-ray diffraction analysis of PtCoIn/CeO2, from which a diffraction pattern similar to that of Pt2In3 was obtained, although the diffraction angles were slightly lower than those of pure Pt2In3 (Supplementary Fig. 1). This indicates lattice expansion of Pt2In3 caused by cobalt doping and supports the formation of the (Pt1xCox)2In3 pseudo-binary alloy structure. To obtain further structural information, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis was subsequently performed. The PtCoIn/CeO2 sample was reduced in situ by a flow of hydrogen at 550C for 0.5h. The Pt LIII-edge, Co K-edge and In K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) of the pretreated PtCoIn/CeO2 were similar to those of the corresponding foils, indicating that these metals are reduced mostly to a zero-valent state (Supplementary Fig. 2). A small contribution of In2O3 was observed in the In K-edge XANES (Supplementary Fig. 2) and extended XAFS (EXAFS) spectra (Supplementary Fig. 3; the Fourier transform of the EXAFS is shown in Supplementary Fig. 4). This suggests that the residual indium species, which did not participate in the alloy formation, is present as an oxide on CeO2. EXAFS curve-fitting (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 1) suggested the presence of PtIn (InPt) and CoIn (InCo) scatterings. This result agrees with the formation of the (Pt1xCox)2In3 pseudo-binary alloy structure and supports that cobalt was doped at the platinum sites of Pt2In3. For Co K-edge fitting, CoCo scattering with an interatomic distance (R=2.44Å) close to that of cobalt foil (R=2.49Å) was also suggested. This indicates the presence of monometallic cobalt nanoparticles on CeO2 and is consistent with the result of the HAADF-STEM-EDX analysis. InO scattering was also derived for In K-edge fitting, indicating the presence of In2O3 as observed for the XANES. Thus, the XAFS analysis demonstrated the formation of (Pt1xCox)2In3 pseudo-binary alloy nanoparticles on CeO2. The residual cobalt and indium species, which did not participate in alloy formation, remained as monometallic cobalt and In2O3 nanoparticles. In addition, we conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the catalysts. Pt/CeO2 and PtCoIn/CeO2 showed similar Pt 4f7/2 emissions at 71.6 and 71.4eV, respectively, which are assigned to metallic platinum (Supplementary Fig. 6a)34. The small negative shift indicates that platinum was slightly electron-enriched upon alloying with indium and cobalt. The indium 3d XPS spectrum showed that the surface indium species were mainly metallic. A small amount of indium was oxidized (Supplementary Fig. 6b: In0, 443.5eV; In3+, 444.5eV)34, which can be attributed to the ternary alloy phase and residual In2O3, respectively, as suggested by the XAFS study.
Catalytic reactions
The PtCoIn/CeO2 catalyst was then tested for the CO2-ODP at 550C. Some platinum-based binary alloy catalysts (PtM/CeO2; M=Co, In and Sn), in which the platinum dispersion is similar to that in PtCoIn/CeO2 (Supplementary Table 2), and monometallic Pt/CeO2 were examined to understand the individual effect of each second metal. For all the catalysts, the products were CO, C3H6, C2H4, C2H6, CH4, H2O and H2. No other by-products such as oxygenates were detected in the outlet gas (Supplementary Fig. 7). Figure 2ac shows the time course of C3H8 conversion, C3H6 selectivity in hydrocarbons (CxHy) and CO2 conversion, respectively (see Supplementary Fig. 8 for details of equilibrium conversion). Although the Pt/CeO2 and PtM/CeO2 catalysts showed a high initial C3H8 conversion (5268%), rapid deactivation occurred within 510h. PtSn, which is known to be selective and stable for DDP28, was not effective for CO2-ODP.

In contrast, PtCoIn/CeO2 retained a high C3H8 conversion (50%) for 20h. Predictably, catalysts containing a typical metal (indium or tin) exhibited a high C3H6 selectivity (8295%), attributed to the ensemble effect by alloying, where the highest selectivity was obtained with PtCoIn (95%). Platinum and PtCo showed very low C3H6 selectivities (35% and 27%, respectively) at the beginning of the reaction due to undesired side reactions generating C1 and C2 hydrocarbons (hydrogenolysis; Supplementary Fig. 9). Platinum and PtCo catalysts also showed a significant deviation of material balance from unity (for example, for platinum, CxHy: 0.71 and COx: 1.31; Supplementary Fig. 10), which suggests that dry reforming of C3H8 to CO also occurred to a large extent. Conversely, the carbon balances in CxHy and COx were close to unity for PtCoIn, indicating a minor contribution of dry reforming on the ternary alloy catalyst (Supplementary Fig. 10). The net C3H6 selectivity and yield, which consider CO from C3H8 as a by-product, were still high (8697%, Supplementary Fig. 11 and 4744%, Supplementary Fig. 12, respectively). The hydrogen yield for PtCoIn was less than 5% (Supplementary Fig. 13), indicating that a large part of the hydrogen derived from C3H8 was consumed by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. This also suggests that the contribution of DDP versus CO2-ODP to the overall C3H6 production, which is reflected roughly by the H2 yield/C3H6 yield ratio35, was very low (10%). Given that hydrogen can also be formed by dry reforming to a small extent, the actual contribution of DDP should be much lower than 10%. For the CO2 conversion stability (Fig. 2c), a similar trend to that of C3H8 was observed: only PtCoIn showed good stability, while other mono- and bimetallic catalysts were deactivated within 10h. Interestingly, the initial conversion of CO2 differed depending on the metal component in the following order: PtCo > Pt, PtSn, PtCoIn  PtIn. This result implies that cobalt promotes CO2 capture and activation as expected, and that alloying with indium alone significantly reduces this ability. Therefore, alloying platinum with both cobalt and indium may neutralize the negative effect of indium, thereby promoting the CO2 conversion, comparable to the level achieved with monometallic platinum. Next, monometallic Co/CeO2 and In/CeO2 catalysts were also tested for the CO2-ODP as control experiments (Supplementary Fig. 14). Although Co/CeO2 was active for both C3H8 and CO2 conversions at the beginning of the reaction, it rapidly deactivated within only 0.5h (C3H8: 48%7%; CO2: 54%22%). After the deactivation, Co/CeO2 retained the low CO2 conversion (22%), which is probably due to the contribution of cobalt oxide species to CO2 reduction36,37 (Co/SiO2 was not fully reduced by reduction at 600C; see H2-TPR, Supplementary Fig. 15). In/CeO2 was almost inactive for both reactions. Therefore, the residual metallic cobalt and indium oxide species in PtCoIn/CeO2 are unlikely to contribute to the high catalytic performance. We performed further control experiments using physical mixtures of the binary and monometallic catalysts (PtCo/CeO2+In/CeO2, PtIn/CeO2+Co/CeO2 and CoIn/CeO2+Pt/CeO2) and PtIn+Co/CeO2, where the cobalt cation was loaded on PtIn/CeO2. Their catalytic activities and stabilities were much lower than those of PtCoIn/CeO2 (Supplementary Figs. 1618), demonstrating that the ternary alloy structure with cobalt doped into PtIn alloy is essential for a high catalytic performance. A temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) (Supplementary Fig. 19) and Raman analysis (Supplementary Fig. 20) of the spent catalysts after the 20h catalytic run showed almost no coke accumulation on PtCoIn/CeO2, unlike the case with other deactivated catalysts. The average coke selectivity was calculated at 10h by dividing the moles of accumulated coke by the total moles of converted C3H8 and the carbon number of C3H8, which was lower than 0.1% (Supplementary Table 3).
The obtained high catalytic performance of PtCoIn/CeO2 was compared with a number of reported systems for the CO2-ODP, considering the activity, selectivity, stability and CO2 utilization efficiency (see Supplementary Tables 45 and Supplementary Fig. 21 for details with references). For a better comparison, the catalytic performance of PtCoIn/CeO2 at 600C (Supplementary Fig. 22) was also included. For alkane dehydrogenation, high catalytic activity is often achieved at the expense of selectivity and stability via the triggering of undesired side reactions31. Therefore, plotting stability or selectivity versus activity can be a good indication of the overall performance. More specifically, the mean catalyst life as a reciprocal deactivation constant (\(\tau=k_{\mathrm{d}}{-1}\)) versus specific activity \(\left( {{{{\mathrm{ml}}}}_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}\, {{{\mathrm{min}}}}{ - 1}\, {\mathrm{g}}_{{{{\mathrm{cat}}}}}{ - 1}} \right)\) and the conversionselectivity relationship were considered (Fig. 2d,e, respectively). The specific activity of our catalyst was approximately five times higher than typical values previously reported. This high catalytic activity is attributed to the use of platinum as the main active metal for the selective CO2-ODP. Moreover, the mean catalytic life of our catalyst at 550C was also higher than those previously reported. For the selectivityconversion plot, we showed two selectivity descriptions for better comparison with reported systems, that is, we considered by-products other than CxHy such as CO (net C3H6 selectivity) or not (C3H6 selectivity in CxHy). Our catalyst exhibited very high C3H6 selectivity (86% and 95% for open and filled circles, respectively) at a high C3H8 conversion region (>50%) (Fig. 2e), indicating its significant ability to suppress undesired side reactions. Figure 2f shows the plot of the CO2 conversion versus the C3H6 yield, which reflects the CO2 utilization efficiency. A high CO2 conversion with C3H6 production in 1:1 stoichiometry (upper right in Fig. 2f) is preferred for a high CO2 utilization efficiency (see equation (16) for the definition of CO2 utilization efficiency). In this context, our catalyst exhibited high CO2 conversion and C3H6 yield with near 1:1 stoichiometry, which compares favourably with previous systems, and achieved CO2 utilization efficiencies of 53% at 550C and 70% at 600C (Supplementary Fig. 21c). We also examined the reusability and long-term stability of PtCoIn/CeO2 by applying a regeneration process. The regeneration of deactivated catalysts typically uses oxygen or air to combust deposited carbon. In this study, CO2 was used instead as a soft oxidant for the Boudouard reaction because of its relatively easy handling. To switch the catalytic run to the regeneration process, the supply of C3H8 was cut off to feed CO2/He for 5h, followed by H2 reduction for 0.5h at the same temperature. CO2 conversion was fully recovered by this process, and no negative effect on the C3H8 conversion was observed (Fig. 2g,h; see Supplementary Fig. 23 for C3H6 selectivity). Although a slight decrease in C3H8 conversion was observed, the conversion reached a steady state after 70h and retained 33% conversion at 96h. Thus, the PtCoIn/CeO2 catalyst displayed multiple properties of outstanding catalytic activity, excellent C3H6 selectivity, high CO2 utilization efficiency, long-term stability and reusability. In Fig. 2g, C3H8 conversion was not fully recovered under the regeneration condition, indicating that coke on the active site for C3H8 dehydrogenation is harder to remove than that for CO2 activation. We also performed a control experiment with a DDP-CO2 cycle test on PtCoIn/CeO2, where the gas feed was switched from C3H8/He (2h) to CO2/He (0.5h). Although the C3H8 conversion decreased to near zero within 2h in the absence of CO2, it was recovered by the CO2 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 24). Thus, the PtCoIn/CeO2 catalyst is highly capable of coke combustion by CO2, which enables continuous coke removal and long-term stability in CO2-ODP.
Mechanistic study
We also performed a mechanistic study to understand in depth the functions of cobalt, indium and CeO2 in the catalysis. First, a kinetic analysis was conducted to understand the rate-determining step (RDS) of the CO2-ODP on PtCoIn/CeO2. The following reaction rate equation was considered for the CO2-ODP: \(r_x = kP_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}\alpha P_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}\beta\), where rx is the consumption rate of x (x = C3H8 or CO2), and \(P_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}\) and \(P_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}\) are the pressures of C3H8 and CO2, respectively. The experimental reaction orders were positive and could be higher than unity for \(P_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}\), while they were negative for \(P_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}\) (Table 1; see Supplementary Fig. 25 for details). Here we considered a LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism involving the two-step dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6, CO2 reduction to CO, and oxidation of the eliminated hydrogen to form water (Table 1). We solved the rate equation of each step by applying the quasi-stationary approximation and site conservation conditions (see Supplementary Note 1 for details). The ranges of predicted reaction orders were fully consistent with the experimental orders only when the CO2 activation to form CO and O was regarded as the RDS (step 6 in Table 1). In addition, we conducted microkinetic modelling based on the transition state theory and steady-state approximation to estimate the forward and reverse reaction rates for each step (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Table 6). For this modelling, some parameters calculated using density functional theory (DFT), such as activation energy (to be described later) and vibrational frequency, were used. As shown in Table 1 (calculated reaction rate), step 6 showed the lowest rate. These results showed that the RDS of CO2-ODP on PtCoIn/CeO2 was the CO2 activation. Subsequently, the apparent activation energy (EA*) was estimated for PtIn/CeO2 and PtCoIn/CeO2 by Arrhenius-type plots. The EA of CO2 activation was significantly reduced (from 168.8 to 138.3kJmol1) by the incorporation of cobalt into PtIn (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 26), which is consistent with the experimental trend of the CO2 conversion and turnover frequency (TOF), as shown in Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 27, respectively. We also simulated the dependences of the reaction rate on \(P_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}\) and temperature using the kinetic modelling, both of which were found to be consistent with the experimental trends (Supplementary Fig. 28). This result strongly supports the validity of our kinetic model. Although the simulated values did not match exactly with the experimental ones, this may be due to insufficient accuracy in estimating the number of active sites. As suggested by the EXAFS study, small cobalt clusters are also present on CeO2, which complicates the interpretation of CO adsorption and the resulting metal dispersion (in this context, a more nuanced calibration of the number of active sites may improve the degree of agreement). Thus, the kinetic analysis revealed that alloying with cobalt kinetically promoted CO2 activation, which is the RDS of the CO2-ODP. Compared with previously reported systems, PtCoIn/CeO2 showed comparable EA* for C3H8 dehydrogenation (WOxVOx/SiO2, 127145kJmol1; Fe3Ni/CeO2, 115kJmol1) and for CO2 activation (Fe3Ni/CeO2, 135kJmol1).

We subsequently examined a series of PtCoIn catalysts using various supports, such as Al2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2, to clarify the role of the CeO2 support. Although these catalysts showed moderate initial conversions of C3H8 and CO2, rapid deactivation occurred within 12h (Fig. 3a,b). This result strongly indicates that the role of CeO2 is to significantly enhance the catalyst stability; this is probably attributed to its coke combustion ability, as mentioned above. To confirm this ability, temperature-programmed surface reactions (TPSRs) were conducted using the coked catalysts under helium and CO2 flows. The coked PtCoIn/CeO2 evolved CO from 500C even in the absence of CO2 (He-TPSR, Fig. 3c), whereas the coked PtCoIn/Al2O3 showed almost no CO evolution up to 600C.

The CO evolution from the coked PtCoIn/CeO2 between 500 and 600C can be attributed to the coke combustion by the lattice oxygen of CeO2. Thus, CeO2 can remove coke at the reaction temperature of the CO2-ODP (550C), whereas Al2O3 cannot, which agrees with the stability trend in the CO2-ODP. Interestingly, intense CO evolution was observed from 600C for both catalysts, which might be due to the coke combustion by the oxygen atoms of the surface hydroxyl groups. When the TPSR experiment for the coked PtCoIn/CeO2 was performed in the presence of CO2 (CO2-TPSR, Fig. 3d), a very large amount of CO (see the scale bars) was evolved starting at 500C, and the coke was completely combusted at 700C. This is clearly due to the continuous oxygen supply from CO2. The corresponding TPSR for the coked Pt/CeO2 and PtIn/CeO2 showed similar CO evolutions at high temperatures (peak temperature: PtCoIn < Pt < PtIn), although a low evolution was observed at 550C. These results are roughly consistent with the deactivation trend (PtCoIn < Pt, PtIn) (Fig. 2a) and the CO2-reducing ability (PtCoIn, Pt > PtIn) (Fig. 2c), which reflects the coke combustion abilities of these catalysts. Based on these results, we concluded that the coke combustion ability depended on the CO2-reducing ability of the metal nanoparticles and on the oxygen-releasing ability of CeO2. The concert of the ternary alloy and the specific character of the CeO2 support enabled the continuous self-regeneration function and the remarkably high coke resistance. Furthermore, we verified the filling of oxygen vacancy after the lattice oxygen consumption of CeO2 using a CO2-titration (TPO) technique and Pt/CeO2. As shown in Fig. 3e, oxygen vacancies of CeO2 were obtained by H2-TPR, followed by cooling and subsequent CO2-TPO. CO evolution was completed by 550C, indicating that CO2 was divided into CO and O. The oxygen atoms were left on the catalyst. H2-TPR was repeated after CO2-TPO and cooling, where the reduction peak of CeO2 appeared again (Fig. 3e). These results strongly support that the oxygen atoms derived from CO2 refill the oxygen vacancies of CeO2.
Finally, we conducted DFT calculations to understand the role of the PtCoIn ternary alloy in the enhanced catalysis. As a model of the PtCoIn alloy surface, the stable (012) surface of intermetallic Pt2In3 was considered and one of the surface platinum atoms was replaced with cobalt, hereafter denoted as Pt2In3(012)Co. Unmodified Pt2In3(012) and monometallic Pt(111) surfaces were also considered for comparison. CO2 reduction to CO, C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6, H2O formation, and H2 recombination were considered on these surfaces (see Supplementary Figs. 2937 for detailed structures and Supplementary Fig. 38 for Gibbs free energy changes). Figure 4a shows the energy diagram of CO2 reduction, where CO2 was first physisorbed, then chemisorbed with a bent sp2-like conformation, followed by CO bond scission to form CO and O, and lastly, CO desorption. The chemisorption was endothermic and required moderate energy barriers of 5557kJmol1. For Pt2In3 and Pt2In3Co, the CO on a top site of Pt/Co and O at an InIn bridge site were more stable than those on Pt(111), probably due to the oxophilicity of indium. CO was considerably more stable on cobalt than on platinum; therefore, the direct desorption of CO from the cobalt site required a high amount of energy (182.3kJmol1). Relatively low-energy desorption is still allowed when CO migrates to the neighbouring platinum site. However, the microkinetic modelling showed that the constant and reaction rate for the desorption of product molecules were very high (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 6) due to the huge contribution of the translational partition function of gas-phase molecules at high temperatures. Thus, the direct desorption of CO from the cobalt site can occur smoothly even with the large energy barrier. Figure 4b represents the energy diagram of C3H8 dehydrogenation, where two hydrogen atoms of C3H8 are subsequently eliminated and moved to infinity (opposite surface of the slab). The two CH activations were endothermic on the Pt2In3-based surfaces, whereas they were slightly exothermic on Pt(111), which may be dependent on whether the eliminated hydrogen atoms were located on a less stable PtPt(Co) bridge site or on a highly stable Pt3 hollow site. The high energy of the unstable hydrogen can be released after each CH scission using the subsequent oxidation reaction (H+OOH, ΔE =86 or 115kJmol1) (Supplementary Fig. 38a and Supplementary Tables 79). Thus, the net energy barriers for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 (C3H8+OC3H6+H2O) on Pt2In3-based surface is not higher than that of CO scission (Supplementary Fig. 39). Figure 4c summarizes the major energy barriers on each surface. The Pt(111) surface was more active than the Pt2In3-based surfaces for CH and CO2 activations, while CO desorption showed the highest energy barrier. For Pt2In3(012), CO2 activation required a high energy barrier of 169.1kJmol1, which agreed well with the experimental EA* (168.8kJmol1; Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 26) and with the low CO2 conversion and TOF of PtIn/CeO2 (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 27). The EA of CO2 activation was significantly decreased to 135.1kJmol1 on Pt2In3(012)Co, which is also consistent with the experimental EA* (138.3kJmol1; Table 1) and the significantly improved CO2 conversion/TOF (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 27), by cobalt substitution. Good agreements were also obtained between the theoretical and experimental EA* values for CH activation (Table 1), demonstrating the validity of our calculation. The CO2 activation still provided the highest energy barrier on Pt2In3(012)Co, which is consistent with the fact that this process is the RDS. The significant decrease in the energy barriers of CH and CO2 activations by cobalt substitution can be explained by the lowering of the final state energies (Fig. 4b) in line with the BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationship38. The cobalt atom strongly captures the carbon and/or hydrogen atom of the adsorbate, thus stabilizing the adsorbate state. The stronger adsorption on Co can be rationalized by the d band structure of alloys, as shown in Fig. 4d. Alloying platinum with indium decreased the d band width and the density of states near the Fermi level. This change weakens the metaladsorbate bonding in accordance with the d band theory39,40. In contrast, Pt2In3(012)Co has a high density of states derived from the cobalt 3d orbitals near the Fermi level, which recovers the adsorption strengths of carbon and hydrogen, hence promoting the conversion of CO2 and C3H8. Thus, the DFT calculations well supported the experimental results and clarified the role of cobalt in the enhanced catalysis.

Overall, the reaction mechanism of the CO2-ODP on PtCoIn/CeO2 and the roles of the ternary alloy phase and the CeO2 support are summarized in Fig. 4e. Both the C3H8 dehydrogenation and CO2 reduction smoothly proceed on the PtCo active site to form 2H and O, as well as the main products: C3H6 and CO. Alloying with indium enhances the C3H6 selectivity due to the ensemble effect and decreases the amount of coke that accumulates on the catalyst surface. The doped cobalt improves the adsorption strengths of the carbon and hydrogen species, which promotes the activation of C3H8 and CO2. The oxygen atoms oxidize the eliminated hydrogen to form H2O or combust coke on the alloy surface or neighbouring CeO2 sites. Note that coke combustion is allowed when CO2 conversion is higher than C3H8 conversion because of the stoichiometry of the CO2-ODP. Coke can be combusted also by the lattice oxygen of CeO2, where CeO2 is partially reduced to form an oxygen vacancy. This oxygen vacancy is refilled by an oxygen atom derived from CO2 activation, enabling continuous coke combustion through the redox of CeO2. Thus, CeO2 can facilitate coke combustion via a Marsvan Krevelen-type mechanism17, which significantly enhances the coke resistance and catalyst stability. Further information on the reaction mechanism can be obtained from the results of the DDP over PtCoIn/CeO2 shown in Supplementary Fig. 24. It is worth noting that no COx (CO and CO2) was formed at all during the DDP, indicating that lattice oxygen of CeO2 does not combust CxHy. Thus, only carbonaceous species can be combusted by surface oxygen atom or lattice oxygen of CeO2. Moreover, C3H8 conversion in the DDP at 550C was relatively high (30%) and close to the the equilibrium conversion (43%; Supplementary Fig. 1) at the beginning of the reaction. This indicates that PtCoIn/CeO2 possesses a high catalytic activity for CH activation even in the absence of CO2, although it was immediately deactivated due to the lack of coke combustion. These results suggest that CO2 does not drastically change the kinetics of the dehydrogenation step, but mainly shifts the equilibrium limitation. Thus, C3H8 dehydrogenation and CO2 conversion are parallel to each other and linked by the hydrogen oxidation processes, which is highly consistent with the mechanism proposed in this study.
Discussion
We designed and prepared a PtCoIn ternary alloy on CeO2 as a highly efficient catalyst for the CO2-ODP. This material comprises small nanoparticles (23nm) with a (Pt1xCox)2In3 pseudo-binary alloy structure, where platinum, cobalt and indium are adjacent to each other on an atomic level. PtCoIn/CeO2 exhibits outstanding catalytic activity, C3H6 selectivity, long-term stability and CO2 utilization efficiency. Alloying platinum with indium and cobalt significantly enhances the selectivity and activity, respectively, while the CeO2 support drastically improves the catalyst stability by Marsvan Krevelen-type coke combustion. The results obtained in this study provide not only a highly efficient catalytic system for alkane dehydrogenation and CO2 reduction, but also significant insights for material design based on multimetallic alloys.
Methods
Catalyst preparation
Pt/CeO2, PtCo/CeO2, PtIn/CeO2, PtSn/CeO2 and PtCoIn/CeO2 (Pt, 3wt%) were prepared by a conventional impregnation method using H2PtCl6 (aqueous solution, Kojima Chemicals; Pt, 8.77wt%), In(NO3)3·3H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and SnCl2 as metal precursors. The CeO2 support (JRC-CEO-2, SBET=123.1m2g1, where SBET is the BrunauerEmmettTeller specific surface area) was added to a vigorously stirred aqueous solution (50ml H2O per gram of CeO2) containing platinum and the corresponding second and/or third metal precursor(s) (Pt:Co=1:1, Pt:In=1:1, Pt:Sn=1:1 and Pt:Co:In=1:1:2), followed by stirring for 3h at room temperature. The mixture was dried under a reduced pressure at 50C using a rotary evaporator, followed by calcination under flowing air at 500C for 1h and reduction under flowing hydrogen (50mlmin1) at 600C for 1h. Co/CeO2 and In/CeO2 were prepared by a similar method, where the amounts of cobalt and indium were adjusted to be equal to those included in PtCoIn/CeO2. A series of PtCoIn catalysts supported on various oxides other than CeO2 (PtCoIn/MOx, where MOx=Al2O3 (prepared by calcination of boehmite (γ-AlOOH, supplied by SASOL Chemicals) at 900C for 3h, γ phase), TiO2 (P25, SBET=3565m2g1, anatase+rutile) or ZrO2 (JRC-ZRO-6, SBET=279.3m2g1); Pt:Co:In=1:1:2; Pt, 3wt%) was also prepared by the same method mentioned above. PtIn+Co/CeO2 was prepared as a control catalyst having a PtIn alloy phase and cationic cobalt by impregnating the reduced PtIn/CeO2 with an aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O so that the final Pt:Co:In ratio became 1:1:2. Comparing the catalytic performances of PtCoIn/CeO2 and PtIn/CeO2+Co makes it possible to understand whether or not cobalt should be included in the alloy phase for enhanced catalysis.
Characterization
The crystal structure of the prepared catalyst was examined by powder X-ray diffraction using a Rigaku MiniFlex II/AP diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. HAADF-STEM was carried out using a JEOL JEM-ARM200 M microscope equipped with an EDX analyser (EX24221M1G5T). STEM analysis was performed at an accelerating voltage of 200kV. To prepare the TEM specimen, all samples were sonicated in ethanol and then dispersed on a molybdenum grid supported by an ultrathin carbon film. For the particle size distribution, we counted 126 particles with ten high-resolution STEM images.
The TPO experiment was performed using BELCAT II (MicrotracBEL) to quantify the amount of coke deposited on the spent catalysts after 20h of CO2-ODP at 550C (0.1g of the catalyst with 0.9g quartz sand). The spent catalyst placed in a quartz tube reactor was treated under flowing helium (30mlmin1) at 150C for 30min, followed by cooling to room temperature. Then, the catalyst bed temperature was increased (40900C; ramping rate, 5Cmin1) under flowing O2/He (50%, 40mlmin1). The amount of CO2 in the outlet gas was quantified by an online mass spectrometer. CO2- and He-TPSR experiments were performed for coked catalysts in a similar fashion using flows of CO2/He (10%, 30mlmin1) and pure helium (30mlmin1). The dispersion of platinum and cobalt in the catalysts (percentage of exposed Pt+Co to the total amount of Pt+Co) was measured by chemisorption of CO at room temperature. Before chemisorption, the catalyst (40mg) was treated with 5% H2/Ar (30mlmin1) at 550C for 0.5h, followed by cooling to approximately 110C by liquid nitrogen with an helium purge (30mlmin1). We then introduced a pulse of 10% CO/He into the reactor and quantified the CO passed through the catalyst bed using a thermal conductivity detector. This pulse measurement was repeated until no more CO was adsorbed. The dispersion was estimated assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry of CO adsorption on platinum and/or cobalt.
Laser Raman spectroscopy experiments were carried out using a JEOL NRS-5100 spectrometer at room temperature to investigate the carbonaceous deposits over the spent catalysts, with 2cm1 resolution of the apparatus and a 532nm excitation source.
XAFS spectra of the prepared catalysts were collected at the BL01B1 beamline of SPring-8, Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI) using Si(111) (for Co K-edges and Pt LIII-edges) and Si(311) (for In K-edge) double-crystals as monochromators. Before the measurement, the catalyst was pelletized (150mg with a diameter of 10mm) and pretreated with H2/N2 (20%, 40mlmin1) at 550C for 0.5h in an in situ quartz cell, followed by cooling to room temperature with nitrogen purge (32mlmin1). The XAFS spectra were recorded in transmission (In K-edge) and fluorescence (Pt LIII-edge and Co K-edge, using a 19-element germanium solid-state detector) modes at room temperature. Athena and Artemis softwares v.0.9.25 implemented in the Demeter package were used for the analysis of the obtained XAFS spectra. FEFF8 was used for the calculation of the back-scattering amplitude and phase-shift functions41. We defined the R factor (R2) for curve-fitting as follows: \(R2 = {\Sigma}_i\left\{ {k3\chi _i{{\mathrm{exp}}}\left( k \right) - k3\chi _i{\mathrm{fit}}\left( k \right)} \right\}2/{\Sigma}_i\left\{ {k3\chi _i{{\mathrm{exp}}}\left( k \right)} \right\}2\).
XPS analysis for the catalysts was carried out using a JEOL JPS-9010MC (Mg Kα irradiation) spectrometer. The catalysts were reduced in a quartz tube reactor under flowing hydrogen (0.1MPa, 20mlmin1) at 550C for 30min, then transferred into the spectrometer using a sealed vessel and an argon glovebox without exposing the samples to air. Binding energies were calibrated with the O 1s emission of CeO2 as 529.9eV.
Catalytic test
The CO2-ODP was performed in a quartz fixed-bed reactor with a 6mm internal diameter under atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (0.10g), diluted with sea sand (0.90g, Miyazaki Chemical, 99.9%), was treated under flowing hydrogen (10mlmin1) at 550C for 0.5h before the catalytic reactions. Then, the catalysts were evaluated by feeding the reactant gas mixture (C3H8:CO2:He=1:1:2; total flow rate, 20mlmin1). The gas phase was analysed and quantified using an online thermal conductivity detection gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A; Gaskuropack 54 column) fitted downstream. For all the catalysts, C3H6, C2H4, C2H6, CH4, CO, CO2, H2O and H2 were detected as reaction products in outlet gas. The C3H8 and CO2 conversions were defined as follows:
$${{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8\;{{{\mathrm{conversion}}}}\!:X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right) = \frac{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}{\mathrm{in}} - F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}{\mathrm{out}}}}{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}{\mathrm{in}}}} \times 100$$ (1)
$${{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2\;{{{\mathrm{conversion}}}}\!:X_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right) = \frac{{F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}{\mathrm{in}} - F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}{\mathrm{out}}}}{{F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}{\mathrm{in}}}} \times 100$$ (2)
where \(F_x{\mathrm{in}}\) and \(F_x{\mathrm{out}}\) indicate the inlet and outlet flow rates of x (mlmin1), respectively.
In this reaction, CO can be formed from CxHy by dry reforming as well as from CO2 via reverse water-gas shift reaction, which were distinguished as follows:
$${{{\mathrm{CO}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{formed}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{from}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2\!:F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2} = F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}{\mathrm{in}} - F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}{\mathrm{out}}\,({{{\mathrm{ml}}}}\,{{{\mathrm{min}}}}{ - 1})$$ (3)
$${{{\mathrm{CO}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{formed}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{from}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_y\!:F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_y} = F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}{\mathrm{out}} - F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}\,({{{\mathrm{ml}}}} \, {{{\mathrm{min}}}}{ - 1})$$ (4)
Two different expressions of C3H6 selectivity and yield were then defined to compare with those reported in the literature:
$$\begin{array}{l}{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6\;{{{\mathrm{selectivity}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{in}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_y\!:S_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_y}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right)\\ = \frac{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}{\mathrm{out}}}}{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{2}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_2{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{2}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_2{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_4}{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{1}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{CH}}}}_4}{\mathrm{out}}}} \times 100\end{array}$$ (5)
$$\begin{array}{l}{{{\mathrm{Net}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6\;{{{\mathrm{selectivity}}}}\!:S_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right)\\ = \frac{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}{\mathrm{out}}}}{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{2}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_2{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{2}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_2{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_4}{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{1}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{CH}}}}_4}{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{1}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_y}}} \times 100\end{array}$$ (6)
$${{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6\;{{{\mathrm{yield}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{in}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_y\!:Y_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_y}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right) = \frac{{X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8} \times S_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_y}}}{{100}}$$ (7)
$${{{\mathrm{Net}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6\;{{{\mathrm{yield}}}}\!:Y_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right) = \frac{{X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8} \times S_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}}}{{100}}$$ (8)
H2 yield was defined as follows:
$${{{\mathrm{H}}}}_2\;{{{\mathrm{yield}}}}\!:Y_{{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_2}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right) = \frac{{F_{{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_2}{\mathrm{out}}}}{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}{\mathrm{in}}}} \times 100$$ (9)
Material balance was considered using the following scales:
$${{{\mathrm{Carbon}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{balance}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{in}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_y = \frac{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}{\mathrm{out}} + F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{2}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_2{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{2}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_2{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_4}{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{1}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{CH}}}}_4}{\mathrm{out}}}}{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}{\mathrm{in}}}} \times 100$$ (10)
$${{{\mathrm{Carbon}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{balance}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{in}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_x = \frac{{F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}{\mathrm{out}} + F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}{\mathrm{out}}}}{{F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}{\mathrm{in}}}} \times 100$$ (11)
$$\begin{array}{l}{{{\mathrm{Total}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{carbon}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{balance}}}}\\ = \frac{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}{\mathrm{out}} + F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{2}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_2{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{2}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_2{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_4}{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{1}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{CH}}}}_4}{\mathrm{out}} + F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}{\mathrm{out}} + \frac{1}{3}F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_y} + F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}}}{{F_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}{\mathrm{in}} + F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}{\mathrm{in}}}} \times 100\end{array}$$ (12)
$${{{\mathrm{Oxygen}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{balance}}}} = \frac{{2F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}{\mathrm{out}} + F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}}{\mathrm{out}} + F_{{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_2{{{\mathrm{O}}}}}{\mathrm{out}}}}{{2F_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}{\mathrm{in}}}} \times 100$$ (13)
Deactivation constant, mean catalyst life, CO2 utilization efficiency, TOF, average coke selectivity and the turnover number of coke were defined as follows:
$$\begin{array}{l}{{{\mathrm{Deactivation}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{constant}}}}\!:k_{{{\mathrm{d}}}}\\ = \left\{ {{{{\mathrm{ln}}}}\left( {\frac{{1 - X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}{\mathrm{f}}}}{{X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}{\mathrm{f}}}}} \right) - {{{\mathrm{ln}}}}\left( {\frac{{1 - X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}{\mathrm{i}}}}{{X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}{\mathrm{i}}}}} \right)} \right\}\left( {t{\mathrm{f}} - t{\mathrm{i}}} \right){ - 1}\end{array}$$ (14)
$${{{\mathrm{Mean}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{catalyst}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{life}}}}\!:\tau = \frac{1}{{k_{\mathrm{d}}}}$$ (15)
$${{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_{2}\;{{{\mathrm{utilization}}}}\;{{{\mathrm{efficiency}}}}\,({{{\mathrm{\% }}}}) = X_{\mathrm{{CO}_{2}}}\left( {1 - \frac{{\left {X_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_{2}} - Y_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_{3}{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_{6}}} \right}}{{X_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_{2}} + Y_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_{3}{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_{6}}}}} \right)$$ (16)
$${{{\mathrm{TOF}}}}_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8/{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}\left( {{{{\mathrm{site}}}}{ - 1}\,{{{\mathrm{min}}}}{ - 1}} \right) = \frac{{M_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8/{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}{{\mathrm{in}}} \times X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8/{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}{\mathrm{i}}}}{{n_{{{{\mathrm{Pt}}}} + {{{\mathrm{Co}}}}} \times D}}$$ (17)

$${{{\mathrm{TON}}}}_{{{{\mathrm{coke}}}}}\left( {{{{\mathrm{site}}}}{ - 1}} \right) = \frac{{n_{{{\mathrm{C}}}}t}}{{n_{{{{\mathrm{Pt}}}} + {{{\mathrm{Co}}}}} \times D}}$$ (19)
where \(X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}{\mathrm{i}}\) and \(X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}{\mathrm{f}}\) indicate the initial (ti=0.5h) and final (tf=2h) \(X_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8}\), respectively. \(M_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8/{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}{\mathrm{in}}\) and \(M_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8/{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}{\mathrm{out}}\) are the inlet and outlet molar flow rates (molmin1) of C3H8 or CO2, respectively. nPt+Co and D correspond to the moles of active metal in the catalyst and its dispersion estimated by CO chemisorption, respectively. \(n_{{{\mathrm{C}}}}t\) indicates moles of coke accumulated at time on stream of t (x = C). The second term in the parenthesis of equation (16) represents the degree of deviation between \(X_{{{{\mathrm{CO}}}}_2}\) and \(Y_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6}\). We also used a flame ionization detection gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-14B; Porapak-Q column) equipped with a methanizer (Shimadzu MTN-1) to detect oxygenated products. All the catalytic tests for kinetic analysis were performed under differential conditions by adjusting the catalyst amount, where the reactant conversion was lower than 15% (typically 510%).
Computational details
Periodic DFT calculations were performed using the CASTEP code42 with Vanderbilt-type ultrasoft pseudopotentials and the revised version of the PerdewBurkeErnzerhof exchangecorrelation functional based on the generalized gradient approximation43. The plane-wave basis set was truncated at a kinetic energy of 360eV. A Fermi smearing of 0.1eV was utilized. Dispersion correlations were considered using the TkatchenkoScheffler method with a scaling coefficient of sR=0.94 and a damping parameter of d=20 (ref. 44). The reciprocal space was sampled using a k-point mesh with a spacing of typically 0.04Å1, as generated by the MonkhorstPack scheme45. Geometry optimizations and transition state (TS) searches were performed on supercell structures using periodic boundary conditions. The surfaces were modelled using metallic slabs with a thickness of four atomic layers with 13Å of vacuum spacing. We chose Pt2In3(012) as the most stable surface; this has the highest surface atom density and diffraction intensity46,47. Pt2In3(012)Co was constructed as a model of the surface (Pt1xCox)2In3 pseudo-binary alloy by replacing one of the surface platinum atoms of Pt2In3(012). The unit cells were (2×2) for Pt(111), (1×1) for C3H8 dehydrogenation and H2 formation on Pt2In3(012)(Co), and (2×1) for CO2 reduction and H2O formation on Pt2In3(012)(Co). Geometry optimizations were performed using the BroydenFletcherGoldfarbShanno (BFGS) algorithm48. The unit cell size of the bulk material (Pt and Pt2In3) was first optimized, followed by modelling the slab structure and surface relaxation with the size of the supercell fixed. The convergence criteria for structure optimization and energy calculation were set to (1) an SCF tolerance of 1.0×106 eV per atom, (2) an energy tolerance of 1.0×105 eV per atom, (3) a maximum force tolerance of 0.05eVÅ1 and (4) a maximum displacement tolerance of 1.0×103Å.
The adsorption energy was defined as follows: Ead = EA-S  (ES + EA), where EA-S is the energy of the slab together with the adsorbate, EA is the total energy of the free adsorbate and ES is the total energy of the bare slab. The adsorption energy for an oxygen-preadsorbed slab was calculated using ESH, which is the total energy of the oxygen-adsorbed slab, instead of using ES. The d band centre (εd) was defined as the average energy of the occupied d band relative to the Fermi level as follows:
$$\varepsilon _{{{\mathrm{d}}}} = {\int}_{ - \infty }0 {E\rho _{{{\mathrm{d}}}}\left( E \right){{{\mathrm{d}}}}E} /{\int}_{ - \infty }0 {\rho _{{{\mathrm{d}}}}\left( E \right){{{\mathrm{d}}}}E}$$ (20)
where ρd is the density of states projected to d orbitals.
The TS search was performed using the complete linear synchronous transit/quadratic synchronous transit (LST/QST) method49,50. Linear synchronous transit maximization was performed, followed by energy minimization in the directions conjugating to the reaction pathway. The approximated TS was used to perform QST maximization with conjugate gradient minimization refinements. This cycle was repeated until a stationary point was found. The convergence criterion for the TS calculations was set to the r.m.s. forces on an atom tolerance of 0.05eVÅ1.
The activation energy (EA) was determined as the largest energy barrier among all the focused steps: for CO2 conversion this was CO2 activation, and for C3H8 conversion this was the first or second CH activations. We also consider theoretical apparent activation energy, EA*, for comparison with the experimental values. This is identical to EA except when the initial state for EA is a weakly adsorbed state, such as physisorption, where the apparent activation energy should be expressed as EA* = EA + Ead as often considered in the literature42. In this study, the first CH activation on Pt2In3 falls into this category: EA* = EA (153.3) + Ead (13.2)=140.1kJmol1.
Vibrational frequencies of the adsorbates were computed by phonon calculation based on harmonic approximation using the finite displacement method in CASTEP. Fractional positions of all the metal atoms were fixed so that only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms were considered for phonon calculation. The contribution of solid surface to the vibrational terms, which is typically much lower than that of adsorbates, was ignored. The threshold for energy convergence for each iteration was set to 1010 eV per atom. The entropy (S), Gibbs free energy (G) and partition function (q) of each species were estimated at 550C using the calculated vibrational frequencies (νn) as follows51:
$$G\left( {T,P} \right) = E_{\mathrm{e}} + E_{\mathrm{trans}} + E_{\mathrm{rot}} + E_{\mathrm{vib}} + PV - T\left( {S_{\mathrm{trans}} + S_{\mathrm{rot}} + S_{\mathrm{vib}}} \right)$$ (21)
where Ee is the electronic energy
$$E_{\mathrm{trans}} = \frac{3}{2}RT$$ (22)
$$E_{\mathrm{rot}} = RT$$ (23)
(for a linear molecule)
$$E_{\mathrm{rot}} = \frac{3}{2}RT$$ (24)
(for a nonlinear molecule)
$$E_{\mathrm{vib}} = R\mathop {\sum}\nolimits_n {\frac{{h\nu _n}}{{k_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}}}\left( {\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{{{\mathrm{e}}{h\nu _n/k_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}T} - 1}}} \right)}$$ (25)
$$S_{\mathrm{trans}} = R\left( {\ln q_{\mathrm{trans}} + \frac{5}{2}} \right)$$ (26)
where
$$q_{\mathrm{trans}} = \left( {\frac{{2\uppi mk_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}T}}{{h2}}} \right){3/2}\frac{{k_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}T}}{P}$$ (27)
$$S_{\mathrm{rot}} = R\left( {\ln q_{\mathrm{rot}} + 1} \right)$$ (28)
(for a linear molecule), where
$$q_{\mathrm{rot}} = \frac{1}{\sigma }\left( {\frac{{8\uppi 2k_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}T}}{{h2}}} \right) \times I$$ (29)
$$S_{\mathrm{rot}} = R\left( {\ln q_{\mathrm{rot}} + \frac{3}{2}} \right)$$ (30)
(for a nonlinear molecule), where
$$q_{\mathrm{rot}} = \frac{{\sqrt \uppi }}{\sigma }\left( {\frac{{8\uppi 2k_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}T}}{{h2}}} \right){3/2} \times \sqrt {I_xI_yI_z}$$ (31)
$$S_{\mathrm{vib}} = R\mathop {\sum }\limits_n \left( {\frac{{h\nu _n/k_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}}}{{{\mathrm{e}}{h\nu _n/k_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}T} - 1}} - \ln \left( {1 - {\mathrm{e}}{ - h\nu _n/k_{{{\mathrm{B}}}}T}} \right)} \right)$$ (32)
where I is the moment of inertia, σ is the rotational symmetry number, h is the Planck constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant and m is the mass of the molecule. For surface species, the rotational and translational contributions were converted into vibrational modes and the PV term was approximated to be negligible compared with the energetic terms; therefore, the Gibbs free energy for surface species was considered as follows: \(G\left( {T,P} \right) = E_{\mathrm{e}} + E_{\mathrm{vib}} - TS_{\mathrm{vib}}\). Spurious frequencies lower than 100cm1 were replaced with 50cm1 for all the structures to provide consistent results as reported in the literature52. The properties of the reactant (C3H8 and CO2) and product (C3H6, CO and H2O) molecules in the gas phase were calculated using an ideal gas approximation at 550C and their translational and rotational contributions were evaluated at relative pressures (P/P0) of 0.24 and 0.01, respectively.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
