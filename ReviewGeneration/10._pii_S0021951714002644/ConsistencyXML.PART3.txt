 Here is the XML structure comparing the consistency between the answer files and the correct answers:

    <answer file="answer.PART3_3.txt">100%</answer>
    <answer file="answer.PART3_4.txt">100%</answer>
  </question>
</questions>
```

To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the answers in each file to the correct answers and assessed if they conveyed the same information. For answer.PART3_0.txt, the answer to question 3 contradicts the correct answer, so I marked those as 0% consistent. For the other answer files, the answers match the correct answers for all questions, so I marked those as 100% consistent.
