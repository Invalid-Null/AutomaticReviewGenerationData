Abstract
A new one pot, surfactant-free, synthetic route based on the surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) concept has been developed for the synthesis of Sn surface-enriched Pt–Sn nanoparticles. Bu3SnH selectively reacts with [Pt]–H formed in situ at the surface of Pt nanoparticles, Pt NPs, obtained by reduction of K2PtCl4 by LiB(C2H5)3H. Chemical analysis, 1H MAS and 13C CP/MAS solid-state NMR as well as two-dimensional double-quantum (DQ) and triple-quantum (TQ) experiments show that organo-tin moieties Sn(n-C4H9) are chemically linked to the surface of Pt NPs to produce, in fine, after removal of most of the n-butyl fragment, bimetallic Pt–Sn nanoparticles. The Sn(n-CH2CH2CH2CH3) groups remaining at the surface are believed to stabilize the as-synthesized Pt–Sn NPs, enabling the bimetallic NPs to be well dispersed in THF. Additionally, the Pt–Sn nanoparticles can be supported on MgAl2O4 during the synthesis of the nanoparticles. Some of the Pt–Sn/MgAl2O4 catalyst thus prepared exhibits high activity in PROX of CO and an extremely high selectivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The enhanced activity in propane dehydrogenation is associated with the high concentration of inactive Sn at the surface of Pt nanoparticles which “isolates” the active Pt atoms. This conclusion is confirmed by XRD, NMR, TEM, and XPS analysis.

1. Introduction
Since the pioneering work of Sinfelt in the late 80s, supported bimetallic nanoparticles have attracted an immense interest as heterogeneous catalysts [1]. Synergistic effects between the two metals often provide unique physical and chemical properties that are different from their monometallic counterparts, resulting in improved selectivity, activity, and/or stability [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10].
Bimetallic catalysts based on Pt are today used in a series of catalytic reactions, such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, reforming of alkanes and of oxygenates, and oxidation of hydrocarbons [11], [12]. A broad range of added metals, Rh, Ru, Pd, Co, Fe, Ge, and Sn can be incorporated inside or onto Pt to form alloy, core-shell, and several types of intermetallic structures [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Among these Pt-based bimetallic materials, Pt–Sn is known to be one of the most efficient catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation to alkenes [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. This process is of particular importance, especially for propylene production which is increasingly used as a building block for polymers and resins. The high selectivity and excellent stability of Pt–Sn catalysts are very likely due to geometric effects of surface Sn species on the Pt nanoparticle [26], [27], [28], [29]. The Sn species at the surface can isolate the Pt atoms into smaller ensembles or more likely isolated Pt atoms [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. Also, it has been claimed that electron-deficient Sn and electron-rich Pt could be produced through the interaction between small Pt “ensembles” and Sn atoms [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. In the specific case of isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene, we previously demonstrated a structure/activity relationship based on site isolation of platinum, surrounded by tin atoms. This “site isolation” would prevent γ-H abstraction from a Pt-isobutyl species, the first surface organometallic intermediate in the process, and thus favor only β-H elimination from this first-formed Pt-isobutyl fragment [40]. This phenomenon of site isolation was a simple and straightforward explanation of the very high selectivity (>99.5%) and long lifetime (>several months) of those catalytic reaction systems.
The surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) approach is a powerful technique to prepare well-defined Pt–Sn catalysts, with a precise control of Sn deposition, at the atomic level, at the surface of Pt nanoparticles [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]. The key point in this SOMC approach is the hydrogenolysis of an organotin complex by hydrogen chemisorbed at the surface of Pt NPs, which results in the selective grafting of Sn alkyls onto the Pt surface sites. However, the SOMC method is often considered as a complicated synthetic procedure for the preparation of supported bimetallic catalysts. Several tedious steps are required to complete the whole synthesis. They consist in (1) the preparation of supported Pt materials by an impregnation method, (2) the creation of a clean Pt surface by adequate treatments, and (3) the grafting of the organometallic compound in the presence of H2. Therefore, there is a necessity to simplify the preparation procedure in particular for practical applications.
Herein, we proposed an improved method, still based on SOMC on metals [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], allowing a simple one pot synthesis of highly controlled Sn surface-enriched Pt–Sn NPs. The concept of this “one pot” synthesis is to couple the formation of Pt nanoparticles covered with hydrogen with its simultaneous reaction with a tin derivative. We have thus considered using the hydrogen adsorbed on Pt NPs, which is released in situ from the reduction of a Pt salt by LiB(C2H5)3H [48], [49]. This adsorbed hydrogen will react simultaneously with a tin hydride derivative to give a Pt modified, presumably at its surface, by the organotin fragment. The synthesis is carried out by one pot mixing K2PtCl4, LiB(C2H5)3H, and Bu3SnH in THF, and the reaction at 50 °C produces Pt–Sn nanoparticles. We first observe that, in our conditions, there is no direct reaction between LiB(C2H5)3H and Bu3SnH, thus the formation of a segregated Sn phase is prevented. Fine characterization of the material suggests that Sn atoms are mainly located at the surface of Pt–Sn NPs, which is consistent with the designed synthetic concept. Additionally, the method can be extrapolated to the synthesis of in situ “supported” Pt–Sn NPs, with a given composition. The resulting catalysts show a remarkable activity, selectivity, and stability for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, confirming the site isolation concept that we previously suggested [40], [41].
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
2.1.1. Synthesis of Pt–Sn bimetallic NPs
All the chemicals including K2PtCl4 (99%), LiB(C2H5)3H (1 M in THF), and tri-n-butyltin hydride (Bu3SnH) (99%) were received from Aldrich without purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was degassed and dried before synthesis. The diluted solution of Bu3SnH in THF (3%) was prepared for the synthesis. A series of Pt–Sn NPs samples with nominal Sn/Pt molar ratios of 0, 1:12, 1:9, 1:6, 1:3, 1:1, and 2:1 were synthetized according to the steps described below.
In a typical synthesis, 30 mg K2PtCl4 and 0.06–1.40 g of Bu3SnH in THF (3 wt%) were mixed in 10 ml of THF in a Schlenk tube, and then 2 ml of LiB(C2H5)3H was added into this solution. The obtained suspension was heated to 50 °C and kept at this temperature for 12 h to complete the reaction. The Pt–Sn NPs were collected by centrifugation and then washed with THF, then ethanol, and finally water, several times to remove any impurities. The gases (butane with trace amounts ethane and hydrogen) evolved during the reaction were collected in a balloon flask. Butane was then quantitatively analyzed by GC and volumetric measurements.
2.1.2. Synthesis of the MgAl2O4 support
The synthesis of MgAl2O4 support was modified from a well-established sol–gel method [50]. 5.3 g of Al(NO3)3.9H2O and 15.6 g of Mg(NO3)2 were mixed in 100 ml of water. Then, 35.2 g of citric acid was added to this mixture. The obtained solution was kept on stirring at 80 °C for 24 h to ensure the polymerization of citric acid to a gel. The resulting sol was stirred for another 12 h in the open system to remove the water, and a blue gel was formed. The gel was dried in 3 steps. First, it was kept at 120 °C for 2 h. It was then heated to 140 °C and kept at this temperature for 2 h. Lastly, the gel was dried at 170 °C for 12 h. The obtained black xerogel was calcined at 750 °C (ramp rate of 1 °C/min from room temperature to 750 °C) for 4 h in static air, producing the porous MgAl2O4 support.
2.1.3. Synthesis of MgAl2O4 supported Pt–Sn catalyst
2.8 g of MgAl2O4 was dried in vacuum (2 ∗ 10−5 torr) at 170 °C for 12 h, and it was then mixed with 30 mg of K2PtCl4 and a certain amount Bu3SnH in THF solvent. 2 ml of LiB(C2H5)3H was added into the resulting mixture. The suspension was kept at 60 °C overnight, with the Pt–Sn NPs formed being adsorbed on the MgAl2O4 surface during the Pt–Sn crystallization process. The Pt–Sn/MgAl2O4 catalyst was separated from the synthesis solution by filtration and then washed with THF, ethanol, and H2O several times. Lastly, the isolated powder was dried at 120 °C to remove the solvent.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were collected using a Bruker D8 Advanced A25 diffractometer (Cu K radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å), operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The data sets were acquired in step-scan mode over the 2θ range 10–140°, using a step interval of 0.05° and a counting time of 7 s per step.
N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were carried out at 77 K on a Micromeritics@ ASAP2420. Prior to the measurement, the samples were degassed in vacuum for 2 h at 300 °C. Surface areas of the samples were analyzed by the multipoint BET analysis method in the P/P0 = 0.05–0.30 pressure range.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a Kratos AMICUS/ESCA 3400 spectrometer, using a monochromatic Mg Kα X-ray source operating at 120 W and a pass energy of 20 eV under an operating pressure of 10−6 mbar. The binding energies of Pt 4f and Sn 3d core levels are referenced to the C 1s core level at 285.6 eV.
The morphologies of the catalyst were imaged with an FEI Quanta 600 FEG environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM).
Low-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a Tecnai T12 operated at 120 kV, while the high-resolution TEM and HAADF–STEM were performed on aberration corrected FEI Titan instrument. Samples were prepared by placing a drop of a water dispersion of catalyst onto a 200 mesh carbon coated copper grid and evaporating immediately at ambient temperature.
Thermogravimetric analyses of the spent samples in air were performed on a Mettler-Toledo thermobalance. The samples used were heated from 50 to 900 °C with a rate of 10 °C/min in a flow of air (10 ml/min).
1H MAS and 13C CP/MAS solid-state NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III 600 spectrometer operating at 600 and 150 MHz resonance frequencies for 1H and 13C, respectively, with a conventional double resonance 3.2 mm CPMAS probe. The sample spinning frequency was set to 17 kHz for 1H and 10 kHz for 13C experiments. NMR chemical shifts were reported with respect to TMS as an external reference. For 13C CP/MAS, the following sequence was used: 90° pulse on the proton (pulse length 2.4 μs), then a cross-polarization step with a contact time of 2 ms, and finally acquisition of the 13C signals under high-power proton decoupling with radio frequency (rf) strengths of 75–90 KHz using the SPINAL-64 scheme during evolution and detections periods. The delay between the scans was set to 5 s, and the number of scans was 30,000 for carbon and 8 for proton. An apodization function (exponential) corresponding to a line broadening of 80 Hz was applied prior to Fourier transformation. 1H-1H multiple-quantum spectroscopy: Two-dimensional double-quantum (DQ) and triple-quantum (TQ) experiments were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III spectrometer operating at 600 MHz with a conventional double resonance 3.2 mm CP/MAS probe and a sample spinning rate of 22 kHz, according to the following general scheme: excitation of DQ coherences, t1 evolution, z-filter, and detection, as described elsewhere [51]. The spectra were recorded in a rotor-synchronized fashion in t1 by setting the t1 increment equal to one rotor period (45.45 μs). One cycle of the standard back-to-back (BABA) recoupling sequence was used for the excitation and reconversion period. Quadrature detection in ω1 was achieved using the States-TPPI method. The 90° proton pulse length was 2.5 μs, and a recycle delay of 5 s was used. A total of 128 t1 increments with 32 scans per each increment were recorded. Correlations appear at a DQ frequency in the ω1 dimension that corresponds to the sum of the two single-quantum (SQ) frequencies of the two coupled protons, and correlates in the ω2 dimension with the two corresponding SQ proton resonances. Analogously the TQ frequency in the ω1 dimension corresponds to the sum of the three SQ frequencies of the three coupled protons and correlates in the ω2 dimension with the three individual proton resonances. Thus, DQ correlations require a group of at least two hydrogen atoms close in space, and conversely groups of less than three hydrogens will not give rise to signals in the TQ spectrum.
The infrared transmission spectra of chemisorbed CO on Pt–Sn/MgAl2O4 catalysts were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer by using a cell equipped with CaF2 windows. The sample was pressed into a thin wafer before transferring into the cell. CO was introduced into the cell and the pellet exposed to CO for 10 min. Then, the cell was evacuated to 10−5 bar to remove the excess CO. The spectrum was recorded on this CO adsorbed pellet.
2.3. Catalytic test
2.3.1. Catalyst evaluation for preferential CO oxidation in hydrogen (CO-PROX)
In order to get information on the possibility of having tin at the periphery of the platinum catalyst, catalytic properties were evaluated in CO-Prox at atmospheric pressure using a high-throughput Flowrence unit from Avantium equipped with 16 fixed-bed stainless steel reactors in parallel (i.d. 2 mm). Reactors were loaded with 50 mg of an alumina-rich mixture containing adjusted mass of the different Pt–Sn catalysts, according to their total metal content, to ensure a fixed metal content in the reactor equal to 0.1% (w/w). These conditions provided a fixed-bed length of 13 mm and a fixed-bed volume of about 0.041 ml. Catalysts were pre-treated prior to light-off studies, first under 5% O2 in He during 4 h at 400 °C (10 °C/min, 5.5 ml/min per reactor) and then under 10% H2 in He during 2 h at 400 °C (10 °C/min, 5.5 ml/min per reactor). Light-off studies were performed by ramping the catalyst at 0.25 °C/min, from 40 to 300 °C. Gas mixture composition is 1.1% CO/1.3% O2/39% H2 in He for CO-PROX. Gases were introduced at a total flow rate of 192 ml/min and then split equally between the 16 reactors (12 ml/min per reactor, with a deviation of less than 2%, GHSV ∼17,640 h−1). Products were analyzed by an online Varian 490 micro-GC. Temperature of half conversion (T1/2) was defined as the temperatures at which 50% of the CO feed is converted.
2.3.2. Catalyst evaluation in propane dehydrogenation
The as-synthesized Pt–Sn/MgAl2O4 catalyst powder (100 mg) was placed in the reactor supported by quartz glass wool. The catalyst was first treated with 10% O2 for 2 h at 580 °C and then reduced in 10% H2 for another 2 h at 580 °C prior to the catalytic reaction. Gas mixtures with a volume percentage of 10% C3H8 and 10% H2 in He were introduced through the catalytic bed at a total flow rate of 20 ml per minute. The reaction products were analyzed with online Varian 490 micro-GC. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated based on the total number of carbon atom balance.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
Seven Pt–Sn bimetallic NPs samples were prepared with a Sn/Pt molar ratio of 0, 1:12, 1:9, 1:6, 1:3, 1:1, and 2:1 using LiB(C2H5)3H as the reducing agent, Bu3SnH as Sn precursor in THF without any surfactant stabilizer. This synthesis is a typical solid–liquid reaction process. The Pt precursor K2PtCl4 is insoluble in THF, while it can be dissolved by reaction with LiB(C2H5)3H and Bu3SnH to form colloidal Pt–Sn NPs dispersed in THF solution. Elemental analysis of the synthesized samples (Table 1) indicates that a certain amount (but smaller than the initial value introduced) of Sn can incorporated into nanoparticles and form Pt–Sn bi-metallic NPs. (No boron residue was detected from EDX in TEM and XRD.)

The presence of Bu3SnH during the synthesis has a significant effect on the Pt NPs crystallization process. The THF solution turned to black instantly when the synthesis was performed at low Sn/Pt molar ratio, and the Pt NPs started to precipitate from THF in 10 min (Fig. S1). When the Sn/Pt ratio was increased to 1, a step-wise color change of the THF solution into purple was observed, and this color could last for 30 min (Fig. S2). Then, black soluble Pt NPs were formed from this purple solution: the solution turned to black slowly and no precipitate was formed during the whole synthesis. The purple solution could be filtrated from the synthesis system, and this purple solution remained unchanged at room temperature for several days. The UV spectrum on this purple solution revealed that there is an adsorption band at 230 nm, which could be tentatively attributed to the formation of highly soluble platinum nanoparticles covered with Sn-butyl fragments (Fig. S3) [52].
The obtained Pt–Sn NPs colloidal suspensions have different levels of stability in THF solution (Fig. S4), which is also directly related to the Sn/Pt ratio in the synthesis. When the Sn/Pt ratio is lower than 1, the black Pt–Sn NPs products precipitate from the THF solvent. Uniformly dispersed Pt–Sn NPs in THF solution can be obtained only with the Sn/Pt ratio of 1:1 and 2:1. A scale-up synthesis with a Sn/Pt ratio of 2 was performed to obtain a higher concentration of Pt–Sn NPs (20 mg) in THF (10 ml). This concentrated colloidal suspension of Pt–Sn NPs exhibits high stability and can be stored for several months without formation of any detectable precipitates. The Sn/Pt ratio is thus an important parameter for the synthesis of stable colloidal suspensions of Pt–Sn NPs in THF.
Magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state 13C and 1H NMR spectra were recorded for the Pt–Sn NPs prepared from Sn/Pt with a molar ratio of 2. The 13C CP/MAS NMR (Fig. 1) shows that there are –CH2CH2CH2CH3 fragments in the as-synthesized Pt–Sn bimetallic particles. The chemical shift at 68.7 ppm is assigned to α-carbon, 26.5 ppm is assigned to β- and γ-carbon, and 14.4 ppm is assigned to δ-carbon. Notably, the signal of the δ-carbon shifts to higher frequency compared to that observed in Al2O3 and SiO2 supported Bu3Sn–O–M (M: Si or Al) [53], [54], [55]. Because this carbon is assumed to be closest to the surface of metallic nanoparticles, the magnetic effect of the Pt NP leads to this low field shift [56]. The 1H NMR spectra (Fig. 2A) exhibit signals at 0.9, 1.2, 1.8, and 4.1 ppm. The proton resonances at 4.1, 1.8, and 1.2 ppm in the single-quantum frequency display autocorrelation peaks in the indirect dimension of the double-quantum (DQ) correlation spectrum at 8.2, 3.6, and 2.4 ppm, respectively (Fig. 2B), but do not yield correlations in the triple-quantum (TQ) correlation spectra (Fig. 2C). These resonances can be assigned to CH2 species in α, β and γ positions, respectively. The signal in the single-quantum frequency at 0.9 ppm autocorrelates in the indirect dimensions of the DQ and TQ NMR experiments at 1.8 and 2.7 ppm, as shown in Fig. 2B and C, respectively. This strong autocorrelation peak is attributed to the CH3 groups in the δ position. Furthermore, some protons show correlations through space in DQ/SQ and TQ/SQ NMR between the different proton positions confirm that all protons belong to the same molecule (–CH2CH2CH2CH3).

(A correlation in DQ and TQ spectra between the δ-protons at 0.9 ppm and the α-protons at 4.1 ppm in the single-quantum frequency confirm that all protons are from the same molecule –CH2CH2CH2CH3).
The amount of butane released in a test reaction with Sn/Pt ratio of 2 gave a value of 2.42 C4H10 evolved at 60 °C per Bu3SnH consumed. Thus, on average, the formula of –Sn(n-C4H9)0.58 can be suggested, corresponding to a mixture of “naked” Sn atoms attached to Pt as well as surface Pt–Sn(n-butyl)x groups.
The XRD patterns in Fig. 3 shows the crystalline structure of these samples synthesized with a wide range of Sn/Pt ratios. The peaks located at 2θ around 39.6°, 45.6°, 66.8°, 80.7°, and 85.4° in all the samples, correspond to the diffractions of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), and (2 2 2) planes of fcc Pt [57]. It apparently indicates that the structure of Pt–Sn bimetallic NPs formed is identical to a face-centered-cubic (fcc) structure of metallic Pt crystals. The cell parameters of Pt–Sn NPs calculated from Rietveld fitting analysis of XRD data is also the same as that of metallic Pt crystal (Table 1). These results suggest that negligible amount of Sn atoms enter into the cubic Pt lattice, and almost no bulk PtxSny alloy is formed during the synthesis. Therefore, the cubic Pt crystal structure is the predominant phase in the Pt–Sn bimetallic NPs samples synthesized for a wide range of nominal Sn/Pt ratios varying from 0 to 2.

Fig. 3. XRD patterns of Pt–Sn NPs synthesized with different Sn/Pt molar ratios.
When the Sn/Pt ratio increases in the synthesis, no shift of the diffraction peaks is observed. Thus, Sn does not seem to be incorporated into the Pt crystal framework. However, the peaks in the diffraction patterns become wider and weaker, which is an indication of smaller particles obtained for high nominal Sn/Pt ratios. The Pt particle size calculated from Rietveld analysis of the diffractograms is shown in Table 1, showing the dependence of particle size on the Sn/Pt ratio in the synthesis. Obviously, the presence of Bu3SnH limits the growth of Pt–Sn particle during the crystallization process, which can be attributed to various effects: (1) the steric hindrance effect of the Sn(CH2CH2CH2CH3)x fragment covering the NPs surface; and (2) the decrease of the coordination number of Pt in each Pt–Sn(CH2CH2CH2CH3)x unit which makes crystal growth more limited. As we have seen in previous works by EXAFS, Sn-mono-alkyl has a tendency to cap 3 platinum atoms [46].
TEM images show the evolution of the morphology of Pt–Sn NPs prepared with different Sn/Pt ratios. Generally, a lower amount of Bu3SnH used in the synthesis results in a higher level of aggregation in the Pt–Sn NPs (Fig. S4). Without Bu3SnH, one obtains with LiB(C2H5)3H agglomeration of small size nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 4. However, the agglomeration of Pt–Sn nanoparticles seems to be lessened with the increase of Bu3SnH content in the preparation. The individual Pt–Sn nanoparticles can be clearly identified when the Sn/Pt ratio increases to 1:3, although these particles are still close to each other (Fig. S8).

The highly dispersed Pt–Sn NPs suspension system is produced with Sn/Pt ratios of 1 and 2. In these two samples, TEM shows that the nanoparticles are highly isolated from each other, with an average size of 2.0 nm (Figs. S9 and 5). High-resolution TEM was further used for the particular Sn/Pt ratio of 2. The lattice fringes of each crystal can be seen from the HR-TEM and no amorphous phase is found. X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis in Fig. S10 indicates that both Pt and Sn element are detectable with a Sn/Pt ratio of ¼ (a slightly lower value than the elemental analysis (1/3)). The calculated lattice distances from the rings of electron diffraction are 2.26, 1.94, and 1.40 Å, respectively, which matches well with the expected d-spacing of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) planes of fcc crystalline structure of bulk platinum phase. Moreover, the FFT image (inset in Fig. 5) shows the arrangement in a typical fcc structure, and illustrates that the nanocrystal is oriented along the [1 0 1] zone axis of the fcc structure Pt. The sharp peaks in the FFT indicate that a well-ordered crystalline state characterizes these samples.

In order to directly verify the Pt and Sn elemental distribution in individual particles at the atomic scale, aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques, including high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) are used for characterization of the Pt–Sn bimetallic NPs (Fig. 6). The high-resolution STEM (HR-STEM) with atomic level in Fig. 6b shows the selected crystal arranges along the [1 1 0] zone axis of fcc structure. The EELS line scan profile of Pt and Sn elements across a sphere-like particle (Fig. 6c), directly reveals a heterogeneous structure with Sn species rich on the edge and Pt species rich in the center.

XPS provides an analysis of Sn and Pt chemical states in the Pt–Sn bimetallic materials. Fig. 7 shows Sn3d regions of the XPS spectrum of the catalysts. For the Pt–Sn NPs samples synthesized with a Sn/Pt ratio below 1/3, only one group of peaks located at 487.0 eV (Sn 3d5/2) and 497.5 eV (Sn 3d3/2) is detected. These peaks are assigned to the oxidized Sn species [58]. It should be mentioned that the Sn component in the Pt–Sn alloy must be in metallic form to construct the alloy crystal architecture [59]. Therefore, all the Sn species observed herein most probably accumulate on the surface of Pt–Sn NPs rather than in bulk. Besides Sn oxide, metallic Sn evidenced from bonding energy at 487.0 eV for Sn 3d3/2 and 495.5 eV for Sn 3d5/2 is detected in the samples synthesized with Sn/Pt ratios of 1:1 and 2:1. However, the oxidized Sn species account for the majority in these two samples. The possibility of large amount of metallic Sn entering into the Pt structure to form an alloy cannot be validated from XRD or TEM result. Therefore, it is very likely that most Sn species stays on the surface of Pt–Sn NPs.

Fig. 7. XPS of Sn3d core level of Pt–Sn bimetallic NPs prepared with various Sn/Pt ratios.
The XPS of the Pt 4f core is illustrated in Fig. 8. The XPS spectra can be fitted into two groups of doublet peaks, which account for oxidized Pt (Pt2+ or Pt4+) at high binding energy as well as metallic Pt at low binding energy [60]. Similarly to Sn XPS analysis, the oxidized Pt species are attributed to the oxidation of surface Pt by oxygen, whereas the metallic Pt is more likely to be located inside the Pt–Sn NPs. The ratio of Pt(δ+)/Pt(0) systematically decreases with the Sn content in Pt–Sn bimetallic samples (Table 1). This can be interpreted as the consequence of Pt coverage by surface SnO2. In the higher Sn loading samples, less Pt atoms are exposed on the surface to undergo oxidation into oxidized Pt. The Pt XPS analysis also indicates that the Sn is mainly segregated at the surfaces of the nanocrystals.

The results detailed above emphasize the high-level of control provided by our method to synthesize Sn surface-enriched Pt–Sn bimetallic NPs with a wide range of Sn/Pt ratios. By XRD and TEM, we do not detect any obvious Pt–Sn alloy or bulk metallic Sn or SnO2 phases. Meanwhile, NMR spectra suggest that there are Sn–CH2CH2CH2CH3 fragments at the surface of Pt–Sn bimetallic NPs. XPS confirms that the Sn mainly exists in oxidized form (after exposure to air), which means only a small amount of Sn enters into the bulk Pt. On the basis of these characterization results, we propose that the Sn is located at the surface of Pt–Sn nanoparticles.
Based on the observations of the products evolved during synthesis and the resulting structure of these nanoparticles, we can propose a simple reaction mechanism (Scheme 1). Firstly, the K2PtCl4 is reduced by LiB(C2H5)3H to form nanoparticles of Pt covered with hydrogen. This nanocluster is the crystal nucleus. Then, crystal growth occurs by the reaction between Pt–H cluster and Bu3SnH. This reaction results in butane evolution and the chemical grafting of Sn–CH2CH2CH2CH3 fragments onto the surface of NPs. The surface reaction with HSnBu3 occurs until the surface is totally passivated by Sn–CH2CH2CH2CH3 fragments. In such a case, a stable Pt–Sn bimetallic NPs colloidal suspension is formed. It should be noted that when HSnBu3 was mixed with LiB(C2H5)3H in THF at 60 °C no reaction is observed in this mixture. The HSnBu3 selectively reacts on the surface Pt NPs, thus phase separation of Sn from Pt is avoided.

These Pt–Sn NPs can be turned into real catalysts by supporting them on MgAl2O4 obtained via a sol–gel method, a porous material with a surface area of 60 m2/g. Due to its good thermal stability, it may serve as an ideal matrix for Pt–Sn NPs for high-temperature reactions. The dispersion of Pt–Sn NPs on porous MgAl2O4 was realized by adding it during the NP synthesis (see experimental methods above). The formed Pt–Sn nanoparticles adsorb on the MgAl2O4 surface. The estimated Pt loading is about 0.55% if all the Pt precursor in the synthesis were completely supported onto MgAl2O4. Elemental analysis shows that the Pt loading is almost stable regardless of the Pt–Sn loading (Table 2) this is likely due to the high solubility of Pt–Sn NPs in THF (Table 2). XRD patterns of the Pt–Sn/MgAl2O4 catalysts are shown in Fig. S11. The diffraction peaks from the Pt–Sn NPs is not detectable because of low Pt loading on MgAl2O4 (<0.5%).

It is noted that this sample was calcined at 550 °C for 8 h in the air before STEM characterization. Obviously, these Pt–Sn particles are well distributed in the MgAl2O4 matrix, and no large aggregates were observed after prolonged treatment at high temperature.

The supported Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts were further studied by infrared spectroscopy of chemisorption of CO (Fig. 10). A band around 2056 cm−1 with a shoulder peak of large intensity is noticeable in all the samples. This band is assigned to CO linearly adsorbed on Pt sites [61]. An additional broad peak located at 1800 cm−1 of low intensity is detectable only in the samples synthesized with no or low Sn/Pt ratios (below 0/9). This peak corresponds to bridged CO on Pt [62]. The absence of this peak at high Sn loading could be attributed to the Pt isolation effect by surface Sn species [47]. High concentration of Sn species on the nanoparticle surface prevents the formation of vicinal Pt; therefore, the formation of CO bridging two nearest-neighbor atoms does not occur.

3.2. Catalytic performance in CO preferential oxidation
Catalysts were first evaluated simultaneously under CO preferential oxidation using a high-throughput Flowrence unit from Avantium. This study helps to assess quickly if catalysts are active prior to individual testing for the desired reaction (propane dehydrogenation). It also provides an initial overview of catalytic behavior that can be related to structural properties. The oxidation of CO to CO2 is a reaction of both industrial and academic interest [63]. It can be catalyzed by both metals [64] and oxides [65], following two different pathways, known as the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism and the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, respectively [66]. These mechanisms are now well described, so that CO oxidation can be used as a probe reaction to gain information/insight into structural characteristics of such catalyst [67].
Fig. 11 shows the conversion of CO for the different catalysts during the light-off study under CO preferential oxidation conditions. It can be clearly seen that as the content of Sn increases the conversion of CO starts at lower temperature. Therefore, this confirms that the prepared materials are catalytically active, and a catalytic tendency can be observed and related to the Sn content. The pure Pt catalyst reaches half conversion of CO at T1/2 = 177 °C. An addition of a small amount of Sn has a great impact on the T1/2 temperature. Catalysts prepared from Sn/Pt ratios of 1/12 and 1/9 both show a similar T1/2 close to 160 °C. Under our conditions, these 2 catalysts reach full conversion at 177 °C. In contrast, the pure Pt catalyst converts only 50% of CO at this temperature. Increasing the Sn/Pt ratio to 1/6 and 1/3 in the syntheses further reduces T1/2 to 152 °C and 145 °C, respectively, while even further Sn addition does not seem to improve the activity significantly. Catalysts synthesized from the Sn/Pt ratios of 1/1 and 2/1 exhibit a similar T1/2 to that of 1/3 (145 °C). For these three highest Sn content catalysts, full CO conversion is reached at 157 °C; while the pure Pt catalyst converts less than 30% at this temperature. Therefore, the doping of Pt with Sn dramatically enhances its activity for CO-PROX. These results are in agreement with previous studies by Schubert et al. who demonstrated much higher performance of Pt3Sn under CO-PROX compared to the pure Pt catalyst [68]. According to this group, and confirmed by our structural characterization, this effect is attributed to the presence of SnOx species on the surface of Pt–Sn nanoparticles, which allows O2 adsorption at lower temperature contrary to pure Pt, where the surface exhibits a higher coverage by CO reducing the probability of O2 activation and thus further reaction. Since oxygen adsorption is less limited by CO desorption on Pt–Sn catalyst, the conversion of CO takes place at lower temperature [69].

3.3. Catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation
The catalytic activity of the supported Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt–Sn/MgAl2O4 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is shown in Fig. 12, Fig. 13. The Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst is active. The initial conversion with this catalyst is about 25% with a propylene selectivity of 82%. However, the activity decreases quickly in the first few hours of reaction (likely due to carbon deposit). Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity increases dramatically in the initial 10 h, climbing from 82.3% to 90%. The incorporation of Sn into the Pt structure has a positive effect on its activity, selectivity as well as stability. Even for small amounts of Bu3SnH used in the synthesis (Sn/Pt = 1:12), the propylene selectivity can reach 93% immediately after a short time on stream, although the stability is not improved. The catalyst Pt–Sn-2/MgAl2O4 obtained from Sn/Pt = 1:9 shows a substantially enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability as compared with that in Sn-free catalysts. The initial conversion increased to 45%, and the corresponding selectivity reaches 94%. Still, this catalyst has a certain level of deactivation during 90 h time on stream. However, the deactivation rate slows down significantly in contrast to the catalysts having a Sn/Pt ratio of 0 and 1:12. Raising the Sn/Pt ratio to 1:6 and 1:3, the propane conversion remains at a relatively high level (40%) with a mild deactivation process. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity reaches 99% instantaneously, and the steady selectivity is maintained during the whole test (90 h).

Most importantly, the Pt–Sn/MgAl2O4 catalysts prepared from high Sn/Pt ratios exhibit an excellent activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The Pt–Sn-5/MgAl2O4 catalyst obtained from a Sn/Pt ratio of 1:1 converts around 45% propane with 99.5% selectivity, and less than 10% deactivation after 90 h reaction. The most stable Pt–Sn-6/MgAl2O4 catalyst is prepared from a Sn/Pt ratio of 2:1. A slight deactivation, from 45% to 40% propane converted, is only observed in the first 5 h. Afterward, this catalyst remains stable for 90 h time on stream with 99.5% selectivity. The normalized propylene production rate over the different Pt–Sn/MgAl2O4 catalysts presented in Fig. 14 shows unambiguously that the higher Sn loading (at least with a maximum of 3.1/1 ratio) the better propylene production efficiency with the most stable performance.

The loss of activity in these Pt–Sn/MgAl2O4 catalysts is attributed to the coking process, which is directly evidenced from the change in color of the catalysts before and after reaction (Figs. S12 and S13). The catalysts before reaction are light gray, while the deactivated catalyst turned to black. However, the color of the most stable Pt–Sn-6/MgAl2O4 catalyst made by introducing a Sn/Pt ratio of 2:1, remained almost unchanged. The coking process is further confirmed by TG analysis of the spent catalysts. As suggested by catalytic results for propane dehydrogenation and visual observation, the level of carbon deposition is relative to the Sn content in the Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts. A high level of carbon formation of 5% (w/w) is detected in the pure Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst. 3.6% and 2.0% carbon are found in the spent Pt–Sn-1/MgAl2O4 and Pt–Sn-2/MgAl2O4 catalysts. By contrast, no evident weight loss is observed for the most stable Pt–Sn-6/MgAl2O4 catalyst prepared from a Bu3SnH /K2PtCl4 ratio of 2:1. TEM and SEM images of the spent Pt–Sn-2/MgAl2O4 catalyst (Figs. S14 and S15) show the presence of carbon nanotube-like structure formed on the surface of the metal particles, which is consistent with the TG analysis (Table 2). However, no such carbonaceous structures are observed in the Pt–Sn-6/MgAl2O4 catalyst by SEM (Fig. S16). The surface of this catalyst is still apparently perfectly clean after 90 h on stream. Therefore, the coking process of Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is greatly reduced by doping Sn to the Pt particle surface and is even suppressed at high Sn coverage. This observation is in agreement with our previous site isolation hypothesis, and other work claiming the effect of Pt dilution by Sn [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]. Surface Pt atoms, isolated by Sn, are unlikely to provide a site for dehydrogenation through γ-H elimination. Isolated Pt sites favor mainly dehydrogenation through β-H elimination, reducing coke formation and improving overall activity and stability for propane dehydrogenation.
4. Conclusions
According to the structure–activity relationship for propane dehydrogenation reactions, we developed a simple one pot synthesis method inspired from organometallic chemistry (SOMC) concept for the preparation of Sn surface-enriched Pt–Sn bimetallic catalyst. Fine characterization of the material proves that the Sn species enriches specifically the surface of Pt nanoparticles. The catalytic performance of these solids for propane dehydrogenation corresponds well with their structural properties. Compared with the classic methods for the synthesis of supported Pt–Sn catalysts, such as impregnation, co-precipitation, and sol–gel methods [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], our method emphasizes the highly controlled synthesis of the targeted catalyst with desired structure. The catalyst prepared by other methods is always composed of several phases, such as PtSn, Pt3Sn, Pt2Sn3, and PtSn4 alloy as well as SnO2, which make it difficult to understand the active species for the catalytic reaction. On the contrary, our method provides a clear process for the preparation of Pt–Sn material with a unique Sn surface-enriched Pt particle structure, which is confirmed to be very efficient for propane dehydrogenation reaction in our study.
Specifically, a series of Sn surface-enriched Pt–Sn bimetallic nanoparticles have been prepared based on the surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) approach. The organometallic complex Bu3SnH selectively deposits on the surface of Pt NPs through an incomplete cleavage of the butyl group of Bu3SnH on a Pt-H site. As a consequence, the remaining Sn-CH2CH2CH2CH3 moieties bond to the Pt nanoparticle surface, stabilizing them in THF solvent. Characterization techniques prove that the Sn species specifically deposit on the surface of Pt–Sn bimetallic NPs. The synthesized Pt–Sn bimetallic nanoparticle has been further supported on thermally stable MgAl2O4 materials first screened for catalytic activity under CO preferential oxidation conditions. All materials show catalytic activity with a trend expressed by a decrease of T1/2 as Sn content increased. Further detailed studies for the propane dehydrogenation reveal that almost no deactivation, along with selectivity close to 100% for propylene could be achieved on the Pt3.1Sn/MgAl2O4 catalyst with the highest Sn loading. The presented synthetic method for bimetallic catalyst provides a new strategy for rational design and synthesis of heterogeneous catalyst and pushes further future structure–activity relationship studies.
