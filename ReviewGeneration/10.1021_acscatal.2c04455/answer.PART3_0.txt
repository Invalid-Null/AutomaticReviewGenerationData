<quotes>
[1] "However, at the microscopic level, migration and clustering of the metal oxides can lead to localized heterogeneity."
[2] "As previously noted, these peaks indicated that crystalline phases of the Ce- and Mo-oxide dopants were present; however, it is unclear currently how such crystalline phases influenced the catalytic properties of the materials for ODHP reactions."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using EDS mapping to characterize the dispersion of different metal oxide dopants in the zeolite. The results showed differences in dispersion between the dopants, with indium oxide showing large agglomerations and the other dopants being more dispersed. However, the relationship between dispersion and catalytic performance is not fully clear.
