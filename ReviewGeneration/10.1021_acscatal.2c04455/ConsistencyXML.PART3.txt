To determine consistency, I compared the key content from the answer in each file to the correct answer. If the answers contained the same key points, I marked it as 100% consistent. If they differed in some key information, I estimated a percentage based on how much overlap there was between the key points.

For question 3, answer.PART3_0.txt touches on some relevant points but differs in its conclusion so I estimated 50% consistency. The other answer files for that question do not mention dispersion optimization and are completely inconsistent with the correct answer.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
