[1] "However, at the microscopic level, migration and clustering of the metal oxides can lead to localized heterogeneity."
[2] "As previously noted, these peaks indicated that crystalline phases of the Ce- and Mo-oxide dopants were present; however, it is unclear currently how such crystalline phases influenced the catalytic properties of the materials for ODHP reactions."  
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using EDS mapping to characterize the dispersion of different metal oxide dopants in the zeolite. The results showed differences in dispersion between the dopants, with indium oxide showing large agglomerations and the other dopants being more dispersed. However, the relationship between dispersion and catalytic performance is not fully clear.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它讨论了使用EDS元素映射来表征不同金属氧化物掺杂剂在分子筛中的分散性。结果显示不同掺杂剂之间的分散性存在差异,其中氧化铟显示大的凝聚体,而其他掺杂剂分散性更好。但是,分散性和催化性能之间的关系还不十分清楚。

<quotes>
[1] "In particular, this study screened different metal dopants within 3D-printed BFM monoliths, performed thorough characterization, and optimized the reaction temperature."

[2] "The multitude of characterizations clearly indicated that the various metal dopants led to different behaviors with respect to metal dispersion, redox properties, and catalytic acidity."  

[3] "First looking at the XRD spectra (Figure 3a), peaks were observed at 2θ = 7.5, 8.8, 22.5, and 49, which are characteristic diffractive indices for pristine ZSM-5 powder. (18) Given that these representative indices were present in all samples without any observable broadening relative to the pristine zeolite, the XRD data indicated that (i) ZSM-5 was the predominant crystalline phase and (ii) calcining the zeolite alongside these metal dopants did not induce any sort of structural decomposition."

[4] "On the other hand, the relationship between metal dopant dispersion and catalytic behavior is generally more well-defined, as it is typically accepted that the metal dopant should be well-dispersed to ensure sufficient contact with the primary ZSM-5 phase. (2528) Targeting such behavior, the EDS maps revealed that all dopants were present both on the catalyst surfaces and deep within the structure (circled); however, there were clear differences between the individual dispersions of the oxides."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It screens different metal oxide dopants (In, Ce, Mo, Cr) within 3D printed bifunctional catalyst-adsorbent (BFM) monoliths and characterizes their dispersion using XRD and EDS mapping. The data shows differences in dopant dispersion depending on the metal, with In showing large agglomerations and poorer dispersion compared to Ce, Mo, and Cr. The article notes that optimizing dispersion is important for ensuring sufficient contact between the metal dopant and the primary ZSM-5 catalyst phase.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章研究了针对优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它在3D打印的双功能催化剂-吸附剂(BFM)单体中筛选了不同的金属氧化物掺杂剂(In、Ce、Mo、Cr),并使用XRD和EDS成像表征了它们的分散性。数据显示,不同的金属掺杂剂的分散性有所不同,与Ce、Mo和Cr相比,In显示出较大的聚集体和较差的分散性。文章指出,优化分散性对于确保金属掺杂剂与主要的ZSM-5催化剂相之间的足够接触非常重要。
