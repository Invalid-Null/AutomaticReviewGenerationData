<English version answer>
1. The article does not directly discuss process intensification approaches for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on bifunctional catalyst design rather than process engineering considerations.

2. The article does not provide any techno-economic analysis or discuss economic viability factors for propane dehydrogenation processes. It is purely focused on catalyst material design and performance evaluation.

3. The article does not mention any safety issues or hazards associated with propane dehydrogenation. It is solely focused on catalyst characterization and performance testing under controlled lab conditions.

4. The article identifies the need for further studies on bifunctional catalyst interactions, optimizing dopant ratios, and performance evaluations under more realistic conditions as remaining challenges and future research directions.

5. The article does not propose using computational methods for propane dehydrogenation catalyst screening and design. It relies entirely on experimental synthesis and testing of catalysts.

6. The article does not highlight needs for improved in-situ characterization tools for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It utilizes ex-situ techniques like XRD, XPS, TPR, TPD etc.

7. The article does not envision any transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on incremental improvements in dopant selection for conventional bifunctional catalysts.

1. 这篇文章没有直接讨论丙烷脱氢的过程密集化方法。它更关注于双功能催化剂的设计而不是过程工程方面的考虑。

2. 这篇文章没有提供任何技术经济分析或讨论丙烷脱氢过程的经济可行性因素。它仅仅关注催化剂材料的设计和性能评价。

3. 这篇文章没有提到与丙烷脱氢相关的任何安全问题或危害。它仅仅关注催化剂的表征和在受控实验室条件下的性能测试。

4. 这篇文章确定了双功能催化剂相互作用的进一步研究,优化掺杂剂比例以及在更真实条件下的性能评估等方面的挑战和知识空白。

5. 这篇文章没有提出利用计算方法来加速丙烷脱氢催化剂的筛选和设计。它完全依赖于实验合成和测试催化剂。

6. 这篇文章没有强调对丙烷脱氢催化剂改进原位表征工具的需求。它利用SES (XRD, XPS, TPR, TPD等)技术。

7. 这篇文章没有设想任何用于丙烷脱氢的革命性催化剂体系。它关注于常规双功能催化掺杂剂选择的渐进改进。
