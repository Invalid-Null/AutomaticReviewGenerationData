[1] "In non-oxidative dehydrogenation, hydrogen and light olefins are formed in a very endothermic reaction. For instance, the enthalpy of the reaction C3H8 → C3H6 + H2 is 124 kJ mol−1. According to Le Chateliers principle, the reaction is favoured at high temperatures and low pressures (due to a positive change in entropy)."

[2] "Having constructed the potential energy surface with all the intermediates and the transition states linking them, we proposed a kinetic model for the reaction."  

[3] "Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were performed at experimentally relevant temperatures (700−1000 C), pressures (up to 10 bar) and inlet mixture compositions to study the kinetics of the reaction and discover the rate determining steps."

[4] "Deactivation of the catalyst has a strong temperature dependence and is caused by the accumulation of C and CH3CC on the surface, which are hard to remove even with hydrogen."

[1] "As the reaction is highly endothermic, considerable conversions only occur at high temperatures."

[2] "Higher pressures increase the reaction rate but also increase the rate of coke formation, which poisons the catalyst."

[3] "Deactivation of the catalyst has a strong temperature dependence and is caused by the accumulation of C and CH3CC on the surface, which are hard to remove even with hydrogen."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article discusses some thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. It states that the reaction is highly endothermic so high temperatures are needed for considerable conversion. It also notes that higher pressures increase both the reaction rate and coke formation rate, which poisons the catalyst. And it states that catalyst deactivation is strongly temperature dependent and caused by buildup of C and CH3CC species.
