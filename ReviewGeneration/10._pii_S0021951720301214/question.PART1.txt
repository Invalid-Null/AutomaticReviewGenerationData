Abstract
As the global demand for propene (propylene) is increasing, classic commercial production processes are becoming unable to keep up. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation, although hitherto underutilised industrially, has been put forward as a viable and green alternative, which is already used in a few commercial processes. In this work, we present detailed first-principles calculations of this reaction over a chromium oxide catalyst, which is the cornerstone of the Catofin process. A complete reaction pathway for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene and ultimately to propyne (methylacetylene) was considered. Cracking, which can yield C1 and C2 hydrocarbons, and the deactivation of the catalyst because of coking were also included and modelled. We used density functional theory calculations with the Hubbard model to study the structure of the involved intermediates, their adsorption and their interconversion to explain how chromium oxide catalysts facilitate this reaction and which processes cause their deactivation. We showed that the interaction of the hydrocarbons and molecular hydrogen with the catalytic surface is rather weak, resulting in low surface coverages, but increasing with multiple bonds present in hydrocarbons. Having constructed the potential energy surface with all the intermediates and the transition states linking them, we proposed a kinetic model for the reaction. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were performed at experimentally relevant temperatures (7001000 C), pressures (up to 10 bar) and inlet mixture compositions to study the kinetics of the reaction and discover the rate determining steps. As the reaction is highly endothermic, considerable conversions only occur at high temperatures. The accumulation of propene and propyne in the reaction mixture adversely affects the reaction rate and selectivity. Higher pressures increase the reaction rate but also increase the rate of coke formation, which poisons the catalyst. Deactivation of the catalyst has a strong temperature dependence and is caused by the accumulation of C and CH3CC on the surface, which are hard to remove even with hydrogen.

1. Introduction
Increased global demand for energy, which is still produced mostly from fossil fuels, has been responsible for a positive trajectory of the global CO2 emissions [1]. It is therefore of paramount importance to develop improved catalysts and catalytic processes, which require less energy. Also increasing is the demand for light alkenes, such as propene and butadiene. Propene is, for instance, the second most important precursor chemical in the petrochemical industry, being used in the production of plastics (polypropylene), propylene oxide, acryclic acid and acrylonitrile.
Propene has been traditionally produced in petroleum refineries with steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking [2]. These processes have been unable to keep up with the increased demand for propene, prompting the development of catalytic processes using other sources. Dehydrogenation of propane, which is an abundant by-product of petroleum refining and natural gas processing, is a commonly used alternative [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Using propane as a raw material and not a fuel feedstock in the current petroleum refining process also contributes to a greener and more sustainable use of natural resources [8]. As a side product, hydrogen is also produced [9], [10].
Propane valorisation represents a technological challenge due to the inertness of the reactant and quick deactivation of the catalyst [11]. In non-oxidative dehydrogenation, hydrogen and light olefins are formed in a very endothermic reaction. For instance, the enthalpy of the reaction C3H8
C3H6 + H2 is 124 kJ mol1. According to Le Chateliers principle, the reaction is favoured at high temperatures and low pressures (due to a positive change in entropy). Industrially, propane dehydrogenation is carried out mainly with two competing processes. For the Oleflex process, alumina-supported Pt/Sn catalysts at 8001000 K and 24 bar are used, yielding a 2070 % conversion [12], [13]. Often, Sn can be doped [14] or substituted altogether [15]. However, more commonly used is the Catofin process, where chromium oxide catalysts on alumina support are used. The reaction proceeds at 850 K and 1.21.5 bar, yielding propene with a 6070 % conversion in the steady state [16]. This method is advantageous as it uses no critical or expensive raw materials (such as noble metals). A drawback of both processes is coking, which requires frequent catalyst regeneration or change. Experimental and theoretical treatment of this reaction is warranted in the quest towards better activity, higher selectivity, less coking and improved longevity.
Despite extensive experimental research [17], theoretical insight is lacking or focuses on phenomenological mathematical simulations [18], [19], [20]. Surprisingly, theoretical research has focused disproportionately on the Oleflex process. Several density functional theory (DFT) studies have been performed to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction on stepped Pt surfaces [21], Pt nanoparticles [22], Pt clusters [23], PtSn particles [24], and PtSn surfaces [25]. Studies on the problem of coking have, unsurprisingly, focused on simple surfaces, such as Pt(111) [26], [27]. Studies on Pt3Sn have shown that tin decreases the adsorption interaction of propane and propene [28], which has an advantageous effect on the selectivity [29].
The chromium oxide process has garnered much less attention. Based on extensive experimentation, Suzuki and Kaneko postulated an empirical kinetic model [30] without breaking down the reaction into elementary steps. Chang et al. studied the catalytic behavior of
-Cr2O3(0001) and ZnO(10
0) in propane dehydrogenation, showing a positive effect of Pt doping [31]. Experimentally, Zhang et al. studied the reaction on mesoporous SBA-15-supported chormium oxide [32]. The type of alumina support and the amount of acid sites were shown to have a marked effect on activity [33]. Shee and Sayari showed that mesoporous Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit high activity with significant interconversion between Cr(III) and Cr(VI) during the reaction [34]. Nijhuis et al. performed an operando spectroscopic analysis of the process to study the dynamics of the catalyst [35]. There have been a few kinetic studies, but none described the process with the rigour of including elementary reactions [36], [37].
Little theoretical insight has been provided into the reaction. In this work, we therefore study the adsorption of reactants and products (hydrogen, propane, propene, propyne) and their transformations on Cr2O3(0001) using first-principle methods. A full reaction network of non-oxidative dehydrogenation, ultimately yielding propyne, is postulated and its thermodynamic and kinetic parameters calculated ab initio. Without any a priori limitations, we allow all possible reaction steps, specifically including cracking and coking reactions. These data are used in a kinetic model via the kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method to predict the reaction rates at various conditions. We identify the reaction steps leading to intermediates, which either represent mechanistic dead ends (such as CH3CC or C) or are prone to cracking and eventual coke formation. The effects of temperature, pressure, and hydrogen, olefins and small hydrocarbon contaminants are investigated. The rate-determining steps are identified for the desired reaction (propene formation) and side reactions (light hydrocarbons formation and coking).
The results show that at low temperatures propene is formed from propane with high selectivity but with a low turnover frequency and an apparent activation barrier 1.37 eV. As the temperature is increased, cracking and coking become more important. Kinetic modelling of coking show that the deactivation of the catalyst is primarily due to the formation of CH3CC and C, which poison it. Cracking occurs when the CC bond is broken in predominantly CH3CH2CH2 and to a lesser extent in CH3CHCH. The reaction rate is considerably lowered when propene or propyne are allowed to accumulate, decreasing both selectivity and activity.
2. Computational details
2.1. First-principles calculations
We performed the DFT calculations with the vasp package [38], [39], [40], [41], which uses the plane-wave formalism to incorporate the periodic bounday conditions. To describe the semilocal exchange and correlation, the PerdewWang 91 approach was used [42], while for the electron-core interaction the project augmented wave method was employed [43], [44]. All calculations were performed in a spin-polarized fashion, yielding magnetic moments of 3.0 for the chromium atoms and 0.0 for the oxygen atoms. Based on convergence testing, the energy cut-off of 500 eV was chosen. Due to a significant self-interaction error when treating Cr with simple GGA pseudopotentials, the Hubbard + U correction for the 3d states of Cr was used (DFT + U) [45]. Based on an extensive literature review, we opted for the values
and
[46], [47]. The PW91 functional with these DFT + U parameters has been shown to yield results that match experiments [48], [49]. To account for the dispersion interaction, the Grimme D3 method was employed [50]. The force threshold for the determination of intermediates and transition states was selected to be 0.03 eV/Å. Preliminary testing showed that refining to 0.01 eV/Å offered marginal improvements (
), which are smaller than the accuracy of the DFT method itself. The transition states were roughly identified with the nudged elastic band method [51] and further refined with the dimer method [52], [53], [54], [55]. For vibrational analysis, the finite difference approach with a displacement of 0.01 Å sufficed. Zero-point energy corrections were included.
Since a unit cell of antiferromagnetic Cr2O3 consists of 30 atoms and is rather large, a 4 
 4 
 2 MonkhorstPack mesh of k points was used. The cell-size optimization yielded the cell constants
Å and
Å, which is consistent with the experimental values (
Å and
Å) within 2%. When cut along the (0001) surface, the slab was modeled with 12 alternating layers of Cr and O atoms (six each), as shown in Fig. 1. This yielded a mixed Cr-O surface termination, which is in line with the experimental observations of autoreducing and the presence of mono-oxo species [56]. The bottom six layers were frozen into their bulk positions, while the top layers and the adsorbates were free to relax. On account of a relatively large 2 
 2 supercell (
Å), the
point sampling was adequate. The slabs were separated by 15 Å of vacuum in the z-direction. Spurious interslab interactions were remedied using the standard dipole correction [57], [58].

and
, respectively. Their sum equals the adsorption energy.

2.2. Kinetic parameters
When studying heterogenous catalytic reactions, there are several different processes. For surface reactions, the forward rate constant follows the Arrhenius equation:
(4)
with
being the vibration partition function of the reactants and the transition state,
the Boltzmann constant, T temperature, h the Planck constant, and
the activation barrier. For the reverse reactions, we substitute the reactants for products and arrive at
(5)
where barring any lateral interactions the identity
must hold.
For the surface reactions involving a gaseous species (ER reactions), we have to account for the rotational and translational partition function of the said species:
(6)
with p being the pressure, A the effective area of the reaction site and m the mass. Dissociative adsorption of hydrogen can be considered an ER reaction. Non-activated adsorption is a special case of this mechanism with
. This makes it a kinetic event:
(7)
while the reverse reaction (desorption) follows Eq. 6. In all cases, the partition functions are calculated from the harmonic approximation.
2.3. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations
The reaction mechanism and kinetic parameters from the DFT calculations were fed into a kinetic Monte Carlo simulation. These were used to elucidate the dynamics of the reaction on a mesoscopic scale, including theoretical estimates of the apparent activation barrier, turnover frequencies (TOFs), selectivity and production rates under different relevant conditions. We used the software package Zacros, which employs a graph-theoretical approach.The Hamiltonian of a particular lattice configuration follows from the energetic model, which takes into account the number of figures or clusters and their interactions if relevant. More technical details on the method have been published elsewhere [59], [60], [61], [62].
We ran the calculations on a hexagonal lattice with two types of active sites, corresponding to oxygen atoms (for binding the hydrogen atom) and chromium atoms (for the hydrocarbons), totalling 800 sites (2 
20 
 20). Based on the DFT data, each species was treated as monodentate, occupying one active site. The DFT calculations showed that the distance between the exposed Cr atoms is 5.1 Å. As is shown later on, the interaction between adjacent adsorbed C-species is negligible due to this separation. Therefore all the sites were treated as independent. However, there is a noticeable interaction between co-adsorbed C-species (on Cr) and hydrogen (on O) as they are in immediate vicinity. This is taken into account by the cluster expansion approach, terminated at the first nearest neighbour, as implement in Zacros. See Table 3 for more information.
For each set of conditions, four simulations with differing seeds were executed and averaged. The simulations were set up with no pre-bound adsorbates on the lattice and run for
events. Testing the simulations on a smaller lattice with a shorter wall time proved that this is sufficient to obtain equilibrated results. Adsorption and diffusion reactions had their forward and reverse constant scaled down to avoid wasting computational time. By making sure that their ratio remains the same, this approach has no net effect on the equilibrium concentrations. This stiffness scaling approach has been tested before [63].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Ab initio calculations
3.1.1. Adsorption
Propane is a member of the family of saturated hydrocarbons, which are notable for their strong bonds and low interaction with other molecules or surfaces. This is evidenced in both, high barriers for its activation (necessitating high temperatures) and low adsorption energy. Even when specifically including the van der Waals interaction through semi-empirical corrections, which DFT itself is notoriously bad at, the adsorption energy is merely
eV. Propane physisorbs non-specifically; the potential energy surface of the adsorption is very flat and the energy does not change significantly (
0.05 eV) when the adsorbate is translated along the surface. Therefore, six different positions for propane adsorption were tested. On the contrary, propene and propyne interact more strongly with the surface and occupy well-defined sites on the catalyst (on top of the Cr atoms interacting with the
electrons of the double bond). They preferably bind to the top site of chromium atoms with the multiple bond. In Fig. 2, we show their positions in more detail. Another measure of the binding strength is the charge density difference upon the adsorption as compared to the isolated molecules and adsorbates, which we depict in Fig. 3, superimposed on a slab (the adsorbate molecule is omitted from the plot). We notice that the charge density is much less perturbed in the case of propane, which results in weaker binding.

Å3).
Molecular hydrogen, however, does not bind substantially to the surface. Hydrogen atoms, resulting from the dehydrogenation reaction itself, reside on the oxygen atoms, while the binding to Cr is energetically unfavourable. Upon recombination, they leave the surface as H2.
In Table 1, we list the adsorption energies of propane, propene, propyne, ethane, ethene, ethyne, methane and hydrogen. They can be decomposed into the (generally negative) interaction energy, which describes the strength of the electronic interaction between the adsorbate and the surface, and the (positive) distortion energy of the surface and adsorbate, which describes the unfavorable contribution due to the geometrical distortion of the surface and adsorbate. The latter effect is shown to be miniscule (
0.04 eV) and completely eclipsed by the electronic interaction.

3.1.2. Reaction mechanism
The mechanism of non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation can be described with elementary reaction steps, which we divide into three groups: (i) adsorption/desorption, (ii) diffusion and (iii) surface reactions. There are eight components (molecular H2 and all stable C1, C2, and C3 hydrocarbons) that can physisorb in a non-activated fashion. Molecular hydrogen binds very weakly and non-specifically to the catalyst (
eV). Thus, its subsequent dissociation can be rather viewed as an EleyRideal reaction (non-activation adsorption) than a surface (LangmuirHinshelwood) reaction. The adsorption of the stable hydrocarbons (vide supra) is non-activated. Diffusion of the hydrogen atoms is included because the adsorption energy of hydrogen is significant. The diffusion barrier for the hydrogen atom is 0.61 eV, which is comparable to its desorption energy. Other species are either bound too strongly (immobile) or too weakly to require the inclusion of adsorption. For instance, hydrocarbons bind rather weakly to the surface and would have diffusion barriers similar to the energy of desorption. Unstable intermediates such as CH3CH2CH2 and others are bound so strongly that their diffusion is slower than the rate of further conversion. Technically, the inclusion of adsorption of these compounds is not necessary because all elementary reaction steps include atomic hydrogen, which is a mobile well-equilibrated species.
Other surface reactions are grouped according to the chemical meaning of the reaction. The reactions that cleave a hydrogen atom, resulting in stable intermediates or monoradicals, are deemed dehydration reactions. By following these reactions in the pathway, dehydrogenation follows an orderly sequence (propane
propene
propyne). Deep dehydrogenation reactions involve diradicals or species that cannot lead to stable products. The reactions where CC bonds break are called cracking reactions. Only cracking reactions with
 eV are used in the model.
In Fig. 4, the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation is shown. Propane adsorbs rather non-specifically and undergoes a hydrogen atom abstraction. In this step, it is roughly equally likely for each of the hydrogen atoms to be abstracted by the neighboring oxygen atom, yielding a hydroxyl group. The barrier for the removal of the methyl hydrogen is 1.25 eV and for the removal of the methylene hydrogen is 1.27 eV. The latter is somewhat less endothermic (+0.73 eV vs. +0.85 eV). Following the removal of another hydrogen atom, propene is formed. It is much easier for CH3CHCH3 to shed another hydrogen atom (
eV) than for CH3CH2CH2 (
eV). As shown later in the kinetic analysis, this leads the reaction through the CH3CHCH3 pathway. Both secondary steps are almost thermoneutral. However, CH3CH2CH2 is much more prone to cracking.

Reactions numbered as in Table 2. Colour code: propane route (green), propyne route (orange), cracking and coking (red).
Further dehydrogenation of propene follows a similar mechanism. In this case, the hydrogen atom from the middle carbon atom is again more readily removed (
eV) than from the terminal carbon atom (
eV). Subsequent dehydrogenation of CH3CCH2 is also more favorable (
eV) than of CH3CHCH (
eV). This reaction proceeds thus almost completely through the CH3CCH2 intermediate. Any CH3CHCH that is formed can undergo a cracking reaction.
In general, deep dehydrogenations have much higher activation barriers. For instance, it is for
eV less prboable for CH3CH2CH2 to convert to CH3CH2CH than to propene (CH3CHCH2). However, as shown later on in the kinetic analysis, these reactions serve an important function. First, they serve as conduits to the inactive intermediates, such as CH3CC or C, which poison the catalyst surface and do not convert further. Secondly, deep hydrogenations can produce fragments which readily undergo cracking. This latter function is not exclusive as stable intermediates or monoradicals can also fragment. CH3CCH2 has the lowest barrier for fragmentation (
eV), comparable to dehydrogenation reactions, followed by that of CH3CH2CH2 (
eV). The ensuing fragments enter the C1 and C2 reaction pathways, which are shown in Fig. 5. In the C2 pathway, ethyne and ethene are predominantly formed. Deep dehydrogenations are less likely in this pathway, as well.

See Table 2 for the kinetic parameters of all the investigated reaction steps. In Fig. 6, a graphical representation of the potential energy surface for the
pathway without the deep dehydrogenations is shown. We see that all reaction steps are endothermic.

Fig. 6. Potential energy surface for propane dehydrogenation over Cr2O3(0001) without the reactions of deep dehydrogenation. Stable compounds, which can desorb, are written in bold. All values are in eV. Reactions numbered as in Table 2.
Lateral interactions are an often neglected yet important aspect of the reaction kinetics. In Table 3, we list the calculated lateral interactions of the intermediates. Due to the sheer number of intermediates, we limit the calculation to the hydrogen-containing pairs. This assumption is warranted by the structure of the catalyst. Carbon-containing intermediates bind to the exposed chromium atoms on the surface, which are far enough apart that their lateral interactions are negligible. The interaction between two co-adsorbed propylene molecules was
eV, which is lower than the accuracy of the DFT method. Hydrogen atoms, however, bind to oxygen atoms, which are in close vicinity to the chromium atoms. As shown in Table 3, these lateral interactions matter.

For radicals with several lone electrons the lateral interaction with hydrogen atoms is favourable. For instance, the interaction CH3CCH is
eV, for CH3CH already
eV and for CCH even
eV. This also explains why for some elementary reactions in Table 2 the reaction energy seems higher than the barrier: the reported reaction energies in the table are relative to infinitely separated products and/or reactants. The aforementioned lateral interactions are included in the kinetic modelling (see below) as a typical first nearest neighbour correction. The lateral interactions between the hydrocarbon fragments are negligible (for instance 0.01 eV for CH3CC
CH3CC) because Cr sites are sufficiently distant from each other.
3.2. Kinetic modelling
3.2.1. Kinetic parameters
In Fig. 7a, we plot the temperature dependence of the rate of propane and propene (also included are ethane and ethene) dehydrogenation, which is measured as a turnover frequency (TOF). Plotting the TOFs against the inverse temperature (Arrhenius plot), we obtain the apparent activation barriers. At 1 bar of pure propane in the reaction mixture, the barrier is 1.37 eV, which is remarkably close to the experimental value of 1.47 eV (see the last section) [30]. The barrier of propene dehydrogenation is somewhat higher, i.e. 1.57 eV, and the reaction rate is for approximately an order of magnitude slower. Ethane and ethene exhibit a very slow conversion. The order of the reaction with respect to the products is determined from Fig. 7b. Plotting the TOFs as a function of pressure on a logarithmic scale reveals the reaction order to be
1 for all dehydrogenations.

3.2.2. Effects of hydrogen
Hydrogen is a by-product of the non-oxidative dehydrogenation. Thus, its build-up in the reaction stream could have deleterious effects on the reaction rate. In Fig. 8a, the TOFs for propane and propene dehydrogenation at 850 K and a constant reactant pressure (1 bar of propane) are shown as a function of hydrogen pressure in the mixture. The effect exists but is not remarkable, i.e. the reaction is zero-order with respect to hydrogen except at extremely high pressure. The reason is twofold. First, hydrogen occupies different sites than the hydrocarbons, not interfering in their interconversion. Secondly, the coverage of molecular and atomic hydrogen on the catalyst is low, as shown in Fig. 8b. Even at exceedingly high hydrogen pressures (10 bar H2 and 1 bar of propane), the coverage of both hydrogen species combined is below 5%. Thus, an increased gaseous concentration of hydrogen does not saturate the catalyst sites, leaving enough vacant sites for the reaction to proceed.

3.2.3. Effects of contaminants
The build-up of propene or propyne in the reaction mixture, however, can have an effect on the product ratio. Therefore, we first investigate the case with the total reactant pressure of 1 bar and varying fractions of propane and propene at 850 K. In Fig. 9a we plot the TOFs for propane and propene as a function of the mixture composition. Although the rate of propene dehydrogenation is lower, the selectivity also drops. At 70% of propene in the mixture, the selectivity drops to 50%. This shows that the selectivity drop is only relevant at a high partial pressure of propyne. Understandably, as the fraction (and thus partial pressure) of propane drops, the reaction rate is also suppressed.

). (b) TOF for propane dehydrogenation at 850 K and 1 bar propane as a function of added propene (solid symbols) or propyne (empty symbols).
With kinetic simulations, we can investigate the effect of contaminants in a ceteris paribus scenario. In Fig. 9b, the propane pressure is kept constant at 1 bar and propene or propyne is added to the system. According to le Chateliers principle, the turnover frequency (TOF) for propane dehydrogenation is decreased upon the addition of propene or propyne, which are the product of the reaction. Even small amounts of propene decrease the reaction but by a factor of 2.7 at the most. Propyne, however, is much more strongly bound to the surface and consequently competes with propane successfully, killing the reaction already in the percent range.
This effect is responsible for a much more pronounced slowdown of propene dehydrogenation when propyne is present in the mixture. In Fig. 10a, the TOF for this reaction is shown at 850 K as a function of added propyne when the partial pressure of propene is kept constant at 1 bar. As the fraction of propyne grows, the TOF decreases for more than two orders of magnitude. The underlying reason is shown in Fig. 10b, where the surface coverages of propene, propyne and CH3CC for the same sets of conditions is plotted. While the coverage of propene remains low at 1 bar, propyne and CH3CC quickly saturate the catalyst. While propyne reversibly decreases the catalyst activity, CH3CC represents an irreversible poison, as shown later on.

3.2.4. Deactivation
Lastly, we focus on the deactivation of the catalyst, which is a serious problem in all dehydrogenation reactions. While cracking decreases the selectivity of the reaction and prevents increasing its rate by (excessively) cranking up the temperature, coking irreversibly damages the catalyst. From Fig. 11, where we plot the event frequency of the individual elementary reaction steps at 900 K and 1500 K (at 1 bar of propane), we can ascertain that the system is well-equilibrated and investigate the principal reaction steps. Further analysis shows the most probable pathway of dehydrogenation. Propane is predominantly dehydrogenated first on the secondary carbon atom and then on the terminal carbon atom. A smaller amount of the ensuing propene follows the same pattern to yield propyne. The overall most probable reaction pathway is thus C3H8

At the lower temperature, there is no craking within the simulated timeframe. To make the effect of catalyst more visible at achievable timescales, the simulation was run at 1500 K, as well. There we can see that the simulation visits the whole configuration space, with almost all postulated steps occurring. This results in the formation of CH4, C2H6, CH2CH2 and CHCH. Moreover, considerable coking occurs, which we detail in Fig. 12 and Table 4.

Only CH3CC and C form in non-negligible amounts. They represent mechanistic dead-ends, being unable to react further. CH3CC is tightly bound on top of chromium atoms in an upright position, while C has interacts strongly with an adjacent
, stabilizing its formation. In Fig. 12a, the Arrhenius plot for the formation of these species and the deactivation of the catalyst is shown. A temporal evolution of the catalytic surface is shown in Fig. 12b, where the formation of the said species and the decrease of vacant sites (and thus activity) of the catalyst can be followed. In 12c, a snapshot of the catalytic surface upon considerable coke formation is shown.
3.3. Putting it into perspective
Direct comparison of ab initio modelling results with experiments is difficult on account of several assumptions that are unattainable in experiments (a well-defined defect-free crystal lattice, its immutability, constant pressure and temperature, no formation of side products etc.). Nevertheless, first-principle insight is informative as it yields additional information about the mechanism and allows for a controlled investigation of the contribution of different factors. Despite fundamental differences in the set-up, we draw parallels to an experimental study.
Suzuki and Kaneko [30] investigated the (de)hydrogenation reaction in mixtures of propane, propane + propene, propane + hydrogen, and propene + hydrogen at temperatures from 716 to 778 K over Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O. Although their reaction paths do not include elementary steps, our modelling agrees with their experimental data. The experimentally determined adsorption energy of propane was measured to be 10 kcal mol1 (0.43 eV), which is consistent with our value of 0.36 eV. We can attribute the small discrepancy to a different system, as the experimental catalyst also included Al2O3 and K2O, and to a notoriously bad description of the van der Waals interactions by DFT, which was compensated for using the Grimme D3 method. The activation barrier for propane dehydrogenation was discovered to be 33.9 kcal mol1 (1.47 eV), which is close to our ab initio value of 1.37 eV.
In their microkinetic model, Gascn et al. [36] lump the cracking reaction into C3H8 
 CH4 + C2H4 with the activation barrier of (308 
 14) kJ mol1 (3.21 
 0.15 eV), while they treat coking with a lumped description C3H8
+
H2 and linear differential equations. However, on a microkinetic level cracking and coking are intricately linked as a CC bond cleavage is a prerequisite and a common initial step for both. We described the catalyst deactivation in an Arrhenius fashion with the activation energy of 2.82 eV, which is resonably close to the experimental measurements.
Lastly, the experimentally observed effect of propene on the dehydrogenation of propane can be compared with our modelling data. Suzuki and Kaneko [30] noticed in their experiments that the TOF for propane dehydrogenation decreases when hydrogen is present. They noticed that the ratio
(the slowndown ratio) depends linearly on the pressure of propane, where
is the reaction rate in the absence of propene, and
is the reaction rate with the constant pressure of propene added. The ratio varies from 1.02.4. In our model, the slowdown factor plateaus at
2.7 when the pressure of propene exceeds that of propane (Fig. 9b).
4. Conclusions
In this work, non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene and propyne over a heterogeneous chromium oxide catalyst was studied. The catalyst was modelled as a (0001) slab of Cr2O3 which is the most stable surface termination of chromia. A comprehensive reaction network pathway of hydrogen abstraction from propane and the ensuing compounds was postulated, which included all possible elementary reaction steps yielding propene and propyne. The steps responsible for coking (formation of C), cracking (yielding CH4, CH2CH2) and catalyst deactivation (CH3CC) were also included. DFT + U calculations were used to find the most stable adsorption sites on the catalyst for each intermediate. Based on extensive literature data and comparisons between experiments and theory, the PW91 functional with the Hubbard approach (
) was selected as the best compromise between accuracy and computational cost for the electronic structure calculations.
The adsorption energies for molecular H2 and satured hydrocarbons are very low, resulting in no noticeable surface build-up. Any adsorbed hydrogen or propane are quickly consumed. This also means that there are no specific adsorption sites for these molecules. Propene and propyne (and their C2 counterparts), however, are bound more strongly and assume a preferential top position over Cr atoms. In all cases, the effect is purely electronic as the distortion contribution to the adsorption energies remains negligible. The coverage with propene is also low, while propyne has the propensity to attain noticeable coverages on the catalyst at elevated pressures (above 0.1 bar at normal operating temperatures).
A kinetic model was built from the reaction network pathway proposed in the model. Using the transition state theory, the rates for every elementary reaction were calculated as a function of temperature and pressure (for EleyRideal adsorptions). A closer inspection of the reaction barriers suggested C3H8 
 CH3CHCH3 
 CH3CHCH2 
 CH3CCH2 
 CH3CCH to be the predominant reaction path. For cracking, CH3CH2CH2 
 CH3CH2+CH2 was the most important step. Deactivation of the catalyst is a consequence of coking and formation of a relatively inert CH3CC species.
Kinetic modelling with the kMC at different temperatures (7001000 C), pressures (up to 10 bar) and inlet mixture compositions revealed additional kinetic parameters. Moreover, we showed that due to low surface coverage of hydrogen and propene, their presence does not significantly impede propane dehydrogenation. The reaction rate decreases for a factor up to 2.7, while the selectivity also drops. Propyne has a much stronger effect on the dehydrogenation of propane or propene. When its partial pressure increases sufficiently to saturate the catalyst, it slows down the dehydrogenation considerably. The effect is exponential, representing a 100-fold decrease in the TOF as the fraction of propyne increases from 0 to 90%. Greater pressure of propyne also additionally accelerates the build-up of non-active species on the surface, poisoning the catalyst.
Based on our results, we explain why and how chromium oxide represents a good catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. In practical applications, it is usually doped with nobel and alkali metals, often supported on zeolites. Our modelling indicates which reaction steps represent the bottleneck in the reaction rate and which steps yield the unwanted side reaction. For modelling on higher scales (reactor level), the reaction network must be reduced to a simpler rate law. This work shows which elementary reactions must be studied in detail when developing or fine-tuning the catalysts for this reaction.
