<quotes>
[1] "In non-oxidative dehydrogenation, hydrogen and light olefins are formed in a very endothermic reaction. For instance, the enthalpy of the reaction C3H8 → C3H6 + H2 is 124 kJ mol−1. According to Le Chateliers principle, the reaction is favoured at high temperatures and low pressures (due to a positive change in entropy)."

[2] "Having constructed the potential energy surface with all the intermediates and the transition states linking them, we proposed a kinetic model for the reaction."  

[3] "Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were performed at experimentally relevant temperatures (700−1000 C), pressures (up to 10 bar) and inlet mixture compositions to study the kinetics of the reaction and discover the rate determining steps."

[4] "Deactivation of the catalyst has a strong temperature dependence and is caused by the accumulation of C and CH3CC on the surface, which are hard to remove even with hydrogen."

Answer: The article discusses some thermodynamic and kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. It states the reaction is endothermic with an enthalpy of 124 kJ/mol and favored at high temperatures and low pressures per Le Chatelier's principle. It describes constructing a potential energy surface and kinetic model with intermediates and transition states. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations looked at temperature, pressure, and composition effects. It states catalyst deactivation depends on temperature and is caused by accumulation of C and CH3CC species.
