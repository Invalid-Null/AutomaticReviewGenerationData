[1] "As the reaction is highly endothermic, considerable conversions only occur at high temperatures."

[2] "Higher pressures increase the reaction rate but also increase the rate of coke formation, which poisons the catalyst."

[3] "Deactivation of the catalyst has a strong temperature dependence and is caused by the accumulation of C and CH3CC on the surface, which are hard to remove even with hydrogen."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article discusses some thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. It states that the reaction is highly endothermic so high temperatures are needed for considerable conversion. It also notes that higher pressures increase both the reaction rate and coke formation rate, which poisons the catalyst. And it states that catalyst deactivation is strongly temperature dependent and caused by buildup of C and CH3CC species.

[1] "Density functional theory calculations with the Hubbard model were used to study the structure of the involved intermediates, their adsorption and their interconversion to explain how chromium oxide catalysts facilitate this reaction and which processes cause their deactivation."

[2] "Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were performed at experimentally relevant temperatures (7001000 C), pressures (up to 10 bar) and inlet mixture compositions to study the kinetics of the reaction and discover the rate determining steps."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article describes how DFT calculations have been applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways. Specifically, DFT with the Hubbard model was used to study intermediates, their adsorption, and interconversion to understand how Cr2O3 catalysts facilitate the reaction and cause deactivation. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were also done at relevant conditions to study kinetics and determine rate-limiting steps.
