[1] It has been demonstrated that the addition of secondary metal elements to Pt-based catalysts could decrease the number of multiple adsorption sites through partially blocked surface (ensemble effect) and/or change the electron density of states (ligand effect) [12], [13], [14], [15].

[2] Several new methods for encapsulating nanoclusters into zeolites have been exploited, such as introducing the stabilized metal species during the crystallization of zeolites [7], [34], covering the shells of zeolites [35], [36], and adding metal species into the expanded precursors of two-dimensional zeolites [33].

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Zn for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt-Zn has higher activity and stability compared to monometallic Pt, which is attributed to the ensemble and ligand effects between Pt and Zn altering the electron density and adsorption properties.

[2] Thus, introducing promoters (Sn [16], [17], [18], [19], In [20], Ga [21], [22], [23], Mn [24], Cu [25], Zn [26], [27], etc.) into Pt can not only decrease the size of Pt clusters but also increase the electron density of Pt atoms, consequently affecting the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts in various catalyses.

5. Yes, the article describes synergistic ensemble and ligand effects between metals in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It explains that adding a secondary metal can block sites on the Pt surface (ensemble effect) and alter the electron density of the Pt atoms (ligand effect), which improves catalytic performance.

[1] Silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite, a purely siliceous zeolite, is MFI-type, featuring a channel of 5.6 × 5.1 Å (a little larger than propane, 4.7 Å), which is beneficial for propane adsorption and activation.

[2] Well-distributed and ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters inside S-1 zeolites have been synthesized via a facile in situ synthesis approach. The 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst shows outstanding catalytic performance in PDH, with a 45.3% propane conversion and a >99% selectivity to propene at 550 C due to ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters with a higher dehydrogenation activity.
