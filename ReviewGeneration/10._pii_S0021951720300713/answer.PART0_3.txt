<quotes>
[1] "Currently, Pt-based catalysts are widely used in commercial PDH processes due to their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity in CC cleavage, as well as environment-friendly properties."

[2] "It has been demonstrated that the addition of secondary metal elements to Pt-based catalysts could decrease the number of multiple adsorption sites through partially blocked surface (ensemble effect) and/or change the electron density of states (ligand effect)." 

[3] "These changes affect the adsorptive performance of the substrate on the surface of the catalyst, producing a unique catalytic effect."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by activating paraffinic C-H bonds while minimizing undesired C-C bond cleavage. It states that Pt-based catalysts achieve this by their ensemble and ligand effects when alloyed with secondary metals like Zn, which tune the adsorptive properties of the catalyst surface.
