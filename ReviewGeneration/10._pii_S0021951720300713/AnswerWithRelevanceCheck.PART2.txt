         [1] It has been demonstrated that the addition of secondary metal elements to Pt-based catalysts could decrease the number of multiple adsorption sites through partially blocked surface (ensemble effect) and/or change the electron density of states (ligand effect) [12], [13], [14], [15].
         
         [2] Thus, introducing promoters (Sn [16], [17], [18], [19], In [20], Ga [21], [22], [23], Mn [24], Cu [25], Zn [26], [27], etc.) into Pt can not only decrease the size of Pt clusters but also increase the electron density of Pt atoms, consequently affecting the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts in various catalyses.

         The article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Zn for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt-Zn has higher activity and stability compared to monometallic Pt, which is attributed to the ensemble and ligand effects between Pt and Zn altering the electron density and adsorption properties.

         The article describes synergistic ensemble and ligand effects between metals in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It explains that adding a secondary metal can block sites on the Pt surface (ensemble effect) and alter the electron density of the Pt atoms (ligand effect), which improves catalytic performance.

         [1] Silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite, a purely siliceous zeolite, is MFI-type, featuring a channel of 5.6 × 5.1 Å (a little larger than propane, 4.7 Å), which is beneficial for propane adsorption and activation.
         
         [2] Well-distributed and ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters inside S-1 zeolites have been synthesized via a facile in situ synthesis approach. The 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst shows outstanding catalytic performance in PDH, with a 45.3% propane conversion and a >99% selectivity to propene at 550 C due to ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters with a higher dehydrogenation activity.
