1. Ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters encapsulated in silicalite-1 zeolite with superior performance for propane dehydrogenation

AbstractHighlights
• Ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic clusters within S-1 were prepared by an in situ synthetic route.

2. Bimetallic catalysts have attracted increasing attention in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to the synergistic effect of metal species and considerably improved catalytic performance, but they often suffer from severe sintering and poor stability. Here, well-dispersed and ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters encapsulated in silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites (named PtZn@S-1) are prepared via a facile in situ synthesis strategy.

4. Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide solution (TPAOH, 25 wt%), tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), ethylenediamine, chloroplatinic acid, and zinc nitrate were obtained from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chem. Co. 1,3-Dimethyl-5-nitrobenzene and p-chloronitrobenzene were purchased from Tianjin Shenneng Sci-Tech Co.

2.1.2. Preparation of 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst
The 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst was synthesized in situ with molar composition 1.0 SiO2:0.4 TPAOH:35 H2O:0.00225 [Pt(NH2CH2CH2NH2)2]Cl2:0.011 [Zn(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](NO3)2 (the detailed preparation of [Pt(NH2CH2CH2NH2)2]Cl2 and [Zn(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](NO3)2 solutions is shown in the Supplementary Material) under conventional hydrothermal conditions at 170 C for 4 days [38].

6. Fig. 3 shows TEM images and EDS elemental mapping images as well as the size distributions of metal clusters in the synthesized catalysts. As to 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 (Fig. 3ac), no metallic nanoparticles can be seen in the channels of S-1 zeolites. The corresponding EDS mapping images show that the Zn and Pt species are uniformly located at nearly identical positions, showing the formation of PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters at the nanoscale [43]. However, some large PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters (6.1 nm) can be seen in 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1 catalyst (Fig. 3df). 

7. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer equipped with an AlKα X-ray source (1486.6 eV).

In the Pt4f and Zn2p XPS spectra of 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1, no XPS signals of Pt and Zn species are detected. However, Pt4f7/2 and Pt4f5/2 peaks at 74.5 and 71.8 eV corresponding to typical zerovalent Pt, as well as Zn2p1/2 and Zn2p3/2 peaks at 1045.1 and 1021.8 eV corresponding to Zn0 and/or Zn2+, are observed on the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst after depth profile (Figs. 2 and S1), confirming that the PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters are completely encapsulated into S-1 zeolites [12].

1. The article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It focuses on encapsulating PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters rather than isolated single sites.

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in S-1 zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It prepares ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters encapsulated in S-1 zeolites via an in situ synthetic route. The resulting PtZn@S-1 catalyst shows no visible sintering and excellent stability during long-term PDH testing at 550°C due to the confinement effect of the zeolite.

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses an in situ hydrothermal synthesis method to encapsulate ultrasmall PtZn nanoclusters within the channels of the S-1 zeolite support. This results in highly dispersed active sites compared to conventional impregnation. 

4. The article utilizes tetrapropylammonium hydroxide and metal amine complexes as templating agents during hydrothermal zeolite synthesis to encapsulate the active phase. This in situ approach gives better dispersion than impregnation.

5. No, the article does not employ in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

6. Yes, the article employs TEM and EDS elemental mapping to characterize metal-support interfaces and dispersion in the propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The images show highly dispersed PtZn nanoclusters encapsulated within the S-1 zeolite channels for the in situ prepared catalyst, but larger PtZn nanoparticles on the external surfaces for the impregnated catalyst.

7. Yes, the article uses XPS spectroscopy to probe oxidation state changes after H2 reduction and under working PDH conditions. The XPS confirms the formation of metallic PtZn alloy nanoclusters after reduction and encapsulation within the zeolite channels. 

8. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on catalyst synthesis and characterization.
