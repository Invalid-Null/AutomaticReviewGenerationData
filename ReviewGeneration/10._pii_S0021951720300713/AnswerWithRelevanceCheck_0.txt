         [1] "However, these small bimetallic nanocatalysts, especially non-noble-metal-containing nanoparticles, tend to suffer from severe aggregation, metal leaching, and sintering during high temperature reaction due to their high surface free energy." 

         [2] "Nevertheless, the exploitation of bimetallic catalysts with ultrasmall cluster size and excellent stability is of great significance but challenging to accomplish."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         Answer: The article identifies that remaining challenges in propane dehydrogenation catalysis include the tendency for small bimetallic nanocatalysts to aggregate and deactivate during high temperature reactions, and notes the need to develop ultrasmall bimetallic catalysts with excellent stability.
