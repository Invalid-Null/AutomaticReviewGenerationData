1. Ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters encapsulated in silicalite-1 zeolite with superior performance for propane dehydrogenation

Here, ultramall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters encapsulated in S-1 zeolites (PtZn@S-1) were prepared under direct hydrothermal conditions and used for PDH. 

2. It has been reported that metal nanoparticles encapsulated in zeolites have been developed as an efficient method for confining nanocluster growth, decreasing sintering and eliciting shape selectivity [11], [12], [30], [31], [32], [33]. In this work, the ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters inside S-1 zeolites prepared by in situ synthesis show excellent stability. During the 60 h on stream at 550 C, the propylene formation rate only decreased from 28.2 to 26.7 mol g-1Pt h1 and no visible sintering of PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters was observed (Fig. S6). Note that the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst also exhibited exceptional cyclic stability during four PDH cycles after oxidationreduction treatment at 600 C (Fig. 6d). Combined with the results of characterization analysis over the spent catalysts, it can be concluded that the stability of the encapsulated metal clusters can be significantly enhanced by the confinement effect of zeolites.

3. Several new methods for encapsulating nanoclusters into zeolites have been exploited, such as introducing the stabilized metal species during the crystallization of zeolites [7], [34], covering the shells of zeolites [35], [36], and adding metal species into the expanded precursors of two-dimensional zeolites [33].
