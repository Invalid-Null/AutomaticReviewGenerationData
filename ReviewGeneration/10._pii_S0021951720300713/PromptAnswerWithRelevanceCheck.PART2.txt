<Chinese version answer>

1. 该文没有比较金属与氧化的支持金属催化剂的选择性曲线。没有提供选择性调制的例子或解释。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] It has been demonstrated that the addition of secondary metal elements to Pt-based catalysts could decrease the number of multiple adsorption sites through partially blocked surface (ensemble effect) and/or change the electron density of states (ligand effect) [12], [13], [14], [15].

[2] Several new methods for encapsulating nanoclusters into zeolites have been exploited, such as introducing the stabilized metal species during the crystallization of zeolites [7], [34], covering the shells of zeolites [35], [36], and adding metal species into the expanded precursors of two-dimensional zeolites [33].

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Zn for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt-Zn has higher activity and stability compared to monometallic Pt, which is attributed to the ensemble and ligand effects between Pt and Zn altering the electron density and adsorption properties.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

2. 是的,该文评价了Pt合金催化剂,如Pt-Zn用于丙烷脱氢。它提供了数据显示Pt-Zn比单金属Pt有更高的活性和稳定性,这是因为Pt和Zn之间的配体和配位效应改变了电子密度和吸附性质。

[1] It has been demonstrated that the addition of secondary metal elements to Pt-based catalysts could decrease the number of multiple adsorption sites through partially blocked surface (ensemble effect) and/or change the electron density of states (ligand effect) [12], [13], [14], [15]. 

[2] Thus, introducing promoters (Sn [16], [17], [18], [19], In [20], Ga [21], [22], [23], Mn [24], Cu [25], Zn [26], [27], etc.) into Pt can not only decrease the size of Pt clusters but also increase the electron density of Pt atoms, consequently affecting the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts in various catalyses.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

5. Yes, the article describes synergistic ensemble and ligand effects between metals in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It explains that adding a secondary metal can block sites on the Pt surface (ensemble effect) and alter the electron density of the Pt atoms (ligand effect), which improves catalytic performance.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

5. 是的,该文描述了双金属和合金催化剂中的金属之间的协同配位和配体效应。它解释说,添加副金属可以阻挡Pt表面上的位点(配位效应),并改变Pt原子的电子密度(配体效应),从而提高催化性能。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] Silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite, a purely siliceous zeolite, is MFI-type, featuring a channel of 5.6 × 5.1 Å (a little larger than propane, 4.7 Å), which is beneficial for propane adsorption and activation.

[2] Well-distributed and ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters inside S-1 zeolites have been synthesized via a facile in situ synthesis approach. The 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst shows outstanding catalytic performance in PDH, with a 45.3% propane conversion and a >99% selectivity to propene at 550 C due to ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters with a higher dehydrogenation activity.

[1] "Alloying of Zn with Pt enhances the electrostatic field around the Pt nuclei with depletion of Pt5d density of states near the Fermi level and redistribution of charge involving (6s, 6p) electrons, which results in a binding energy shift of the Pt4f core levels to higher energies."

[2] "It is demonstrated that Zn sites in smaller 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalysts could contribute more electrons to Pt sites."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. The article investigates electronic effects of the secondary metal Zn in the PtZn bimetallic catalyst. It shows that alloying Zn with Pt depletes the Pt 5d density of states and increases the binding energy of Pt 4f electrons, indicating electron transfer from Zn to Pt. The data also suggests smaller PtZn clusters exhibit greater electron transfer from Zn to Pt.

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Zn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing the 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst has higher propylene formation rate, lower activation energy, and higher stability compared to monometallic Pt and Pt-Zn catalysts prepared by impregnation.
