[1] Bimetallic catalysts have attracted increasing attention in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to the synergistic effect of metal species and considerably improved catalytic performance, but they often suffer from severe sintering and poor stability.

[2] It is demonstrated that the stability of the encapsulated metal clusters can be significantly enhanced by the confinement effect of zeolites.
</Quotes>

<English>
Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It shows encapsulation improves stability compared to unsupported catalysts which often sinter and deactivate. The zeolite confinement prevents sintering.

[1] In this work, ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters encapsulated in S-1 zeolites (PtZn@S-1) were prepared under direct hydrothermal conditions and used for PDH.

[2] The high-resolution TEM image of these large nanoclusters possesses clear lattice fringes of 0.226 nm, corresponding to the (1 1 1) plane of Pt3Zn. 

[3] The degree of Pt dispersion of 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 is higher than that of 0.3Pt@S-1 and 0.3Pt0.5Zn/S-1.
</Quotes>

<English>
Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods for optimizing dispersion. It shows the in-situ hydrothermal method yields highly dispersed ultra-small nanoclusters within the pores, while impregnation gives large particles. TEM, XRD and dispersion measurements confirm the higher dispersion.
