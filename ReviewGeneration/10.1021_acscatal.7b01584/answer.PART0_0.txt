[1] "The demand for propylene is growing rapidly because of an increased demand for polypropylene and many other propylene derivatives such as acrylonitrile and cumene."

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic equilibrium-limited reaction that is typically carried out at 500700 C in the presence of a catalyst."

[3] "Catalysts for this process are metal oxides, typically chromia, CrxOy, and Pt-based catalysts." 

[4] "Currently, there is an increasing interest in Pt-based catalysts due to rapid coking and sintering of chromia-based catalysts and the significant health risk in the case of chromium spilling or exposure."

[5] "Brillouin-zone integration for surface slab calculations was done on a 3 × 5 × 1 MonkhorstPack grid." 

[6] "To calculate the transition state, the nudged elastic band (NEB) method was employed first. This method allows construction of the minimal energy path between a pair of stable states."

1. The article provides background that propylene demand is growing due to increased use in polypropylene and other derivatives, explaining the value of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation.

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the activation energy barrier for the endothermic, equilibrium-limited reaction typically at 500-700°C.

3. The article introduces metal oxide catalysts like chromia and Pt-based catalysts that have been explored for propane dehydrogenation. 

4. The article discusses the thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors like the endothermic nature and equilibrium limitation of propane dehydrogenation needing high temperatures around 500-700°C.

5. The article describes applying DFT calculations with functionals like vdW-DF on Pt(111) slab models to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms using methods like NEB for transition states.

6. The article presents microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation using an extensive reaction network to capture effects like hydrogen cofeeding. Rate equations, parameters like rate coefficients, and a plug flow reactor model are discussed.

7. The article does not identify descriptors correlating catalyst properties to propane dehydrogenation performance.
