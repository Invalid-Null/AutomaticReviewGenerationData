[1] "Propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic equilibrium-limited reaction that is typically carried out at 500700 C in the presence of a catalyst."

[2] "Furthermore, the faster deactivation will require a more frequent time- and energy-consuming regeneration of the catalyst."

[3] "The forward reaction rates have been defined from left to right in the reaction equation. For brevity, the bonds with the surface have been omitted for the species in the reaction equations."

[1] "Periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP 5.3.3)." 

[2] "The opt-PBE vdW-DF functional is more appropriate to describe π-bound unsaturated hydrocarbons such as propylene, and it gives the lowest mean absolute deviations (MAD) for the adsorption energies of different adsorbates such as ethane, ethylene, benzene, and hydrogen on a Pt(111) surface."

[3] "To calculate the transition state, the nudged elastic band (NEB) method was employed first. This method allows construction of the minimal energy path between a pair of stable states."
