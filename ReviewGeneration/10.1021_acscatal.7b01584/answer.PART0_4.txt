[1] "Propane dehydrogenation on a Pt-based catalyst can be accelerated by cofeeding hydrogen."

[2] "In this work possible explanations for the positive effect of hydrogen cofeeding on activity are investigated using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations on a Pt(111) surface."

[3] "The use of a promoting element, such as Sn, Ga, or In, reduces the tendency to form coke."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explains how catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers through mechanisms such as promoting elements that reduce coke formation. Specifically, it describes how cofeeding hydrogen can accelerate propane dehydrogenation on a Pt-based catalyst, and DFT calculations are used to investigate this effect on a Pt(111) surface. Promoting elements like Sn, Ga, and In are mentioned as reducing coke formation.

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic equilibrium-limited reaction that is typically carried out at 500-700 °C in the presence of a catalyst."

[2] "The calculated gas-phase reaction enthalpies, and to a lesser extent the entropies, do not correspond well to those calculated from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) reference values." 

[3] "Arrhenius activation energies Ea and pre-exponential factors A for the reaction steps were calculated from conventional transition-state theory (TST)."

[4] "This work shows that the qualitative behavior of Pt dehydrogenation catalysis can be captured by a fully DFT based model, provided the kinetic model is sufficiently large and coverage dependence is accounted for."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article discusses the thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. It states that propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic, equilibrium-limited reaction carried out at 500-700°C with a catalyst. It calculates reaction enthalpies, entropies, Arrhenius activation energies, and pre-exponential factors using DFT and compares to NIST reference values. It concludes that Pt dehydrogenation kinetics can be modeled with a sufficiently large DFT-based kinetic model accounting for coverage dependence.
