[1] "The use of a promoting element, such as Sn, Ga, or In, reduces the tendency to form coke."

[2] "Historically, the positive effect of cofeeding H2 on the activity has been described for catalytic re-forming, in particular for dehydrocyclization and hydrogenolysis reactions."

5. The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides insights that co-feeding H2 can accelerate propane dehydrogenation on Pt, and adding promoters like Sn, Ga, In reduces coke formation. It also notes the historical positive effect of H2 co-feeding for other catalytic reactions involving Pt.

[1] "In this work, an extensive reaction mechanism consisting of 42 surface reaction steps and 6 adsorption and desorption steps (see Table 1) is considered that contains the deep dehydrogenation reactions that could possibly explain the experimental trends observed for an increasing H2/C3H8 inlet ratio." 

[2] "The gas-phase species considered in this work are the reactants C3H8 and H2, the product C3H6, and the side products CH4, C2H6, and C2H4."

[3] "The elementary steps included in the network are based on a combination of literature and chemical intuition."
