To generate this XML, I compared the answers from each file to the correct answers provided. I determined if the answers addressed the question properly based on keywords and key details. If the answers fully addressed the question with the same conclusions as the correct answers, I assigned a consistency ratio of 100%. If the answers partially addressed the question or came to slightly different conclusions, I assigned a lower consistency ratio. For most questions, the answers were fully consistent so 100% was given. One answer for question 3 only partially addressed optimization of dispersion, so I gave that a ratio of 33%. All other questions had full agreement between the answers and correct answers.
