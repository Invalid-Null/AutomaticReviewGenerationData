<quotes>

[1] The screening study, using 26 different dopant atoms, showed that doping with lead results in high selectivity and activity. Indeed, out of 97 catalysts tested, a 10 mol% Pb-doped catalyst showed the highest activity and high selectivity.22 The lead, however, easily segregates from the ceria, forming a separate PbO phase, which is not stable in the redox cycling.

[2] Future work should focus on increasing the stability of the PbCrO4catalyst without compromising its activity. This could be achieved by adding a small amount of alumina, similar to the copperzincalumina methanol synthesis catalyst.26,27

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. Yes, the article summarizes remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it identifies instability and loss of activity over time as issues with lead-containing catalysts like lead-doped ceria and lead chromate due to lead segregation or loss of crystallinity. It suggests future work should focus on improving stability of promising PbCrO4 catalysts without compromising activity, potentially by adding small amounts of supports like alumina.
