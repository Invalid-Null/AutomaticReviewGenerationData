To generate this, I manually compared the English answer provided in each file with the correct answer provided for each question. I calculated a consistency percentage based on how closely the meanings matched. For completely consistent meanings, I assigned 100%, and for completely inconsistent or unrelated meanings, I assigned 0%. Most answers showed very clear match or mismatch, making the grading straightforward in this case. The percentages allow an easy way to spot which questions showed disagreement or uncertainty across responders.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
