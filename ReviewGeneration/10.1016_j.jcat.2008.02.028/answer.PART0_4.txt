 Unfortunately, there are no relevant quotes in the given literature that directly address the specific questions asked. The literature focuses on the preparation and characterization of VOx/SiO2 catalysts using flame pyrolysis and evaluating their performance for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. It does not provide background on the industrial importance of propylene, explain catalyst mechanisms for lowering activation barriers in propane dehydrogenation, introduce major catalyst classes explored for this reaction, discuss thermodynamic or kinetic constraints, present computational insights from DFT or microkinetic modeling, or reveal structure-activity relationships correlating catalyst properties to performance.
