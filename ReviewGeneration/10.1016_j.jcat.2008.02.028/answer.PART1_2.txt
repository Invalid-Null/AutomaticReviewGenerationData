 Unfortunately, this article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses specifically on V2O5/SiO2 catalysts prepared by flame pyrolysis.

Therefore, for the provided question list, I have copied relevant quotes from the article where possible. For questions that cannot be answered by the content of this article, I have stated "No relevant quotes" instead.

<quotes>
[1] "Indeed, the first reaction step involves V5+, which reduces to V4+ and then to V3+. The active oxidized VOx sites can be promptly restored by oxygen when co-fed with the paraffin." 
[2] "It seems that V5+ is dispersed on the support in the form of isolated vanadate species, which progressively oligomerize and polymerize with increasing V loading until a monolayer is formed."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes a Mars-Van Krevelen type mechanistic scenario where V5+ active sites reduce to lower oxidation states V4+ and V3+ during propane dehydrogenation, and are re-oxidized by co-fed oxygen. Isolated and oligomeric vanadate species are described as the active sites.  
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 这篇文章提出了Mars-Van Krevelen类型的机理场景,V5+活性位点在丙烷脱氢过程中被还原为较低的氧化态V4+和V3+,并由同时供给的氧气重新氧化。文章描述了隔离的钒酸盐种和寡聚体种是活性位点。

<quotes>
[1] "When instead the reaction is carried out in the absence of molecular oxygen, the better isolation of the active sites may effectively control the availability of surface O2 sites and thereby limit the consecutive and parallel total combustion reactions."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article argues that under anaerobic reaction conditions, better isolation of vanadate active sites helps limit consecutive and parallel combustion reactions by controlling surface oxygen availability. This suggests metal-support interfacial effects play a role.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 这篇文章认为,在非氧条件下进行反应时,更好的隔离钒酸根活性位点有助于通过控制表面氧的可获得性来限制连续和平行的燃烧反应。这表明金属支撑体间的界面效应发挥了作用。
