         [1] "Comparing the catalyst prepared with the solgel method containing 7 wt% V2O5 [30] and the V10Si catalyst reported here demonstrates that the two samples behaved similarly under anaerobic conditions (with very similar plots of selectivity to propylene as a function of conversion), but the solgel catalyst gave better selectivity than the FP catalyst under co-feed conditions."
         [2] "This indicates that the hydroxyl groups did not play a negative role in selectivity when the reaction was carried out in the absence of molecular oxygen."

         The article does not evaluate Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 or other promising metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses solely on vanadium oxide supported on silica catalysts prepared by flame pyrolysis and compares the performance to a similar sol-gel catalyst.

         该文章没有评估Cr2O3、Pt-Sn、Ga2O3或其他有前景的金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它仅关注通过火焰喷射法制备的硅载体氧化钒催化剂,并与类似的溶胶凝胶催化剂进行了比较。

           [1] "The active sites of the FP-prepared catalysts appeared as highly dispersed V5+O groups partly incorporated into the silica matrix and interacting poorly with one another." 

           [2] "Lower dispersion can be achieved at the same V loading with the catalyst prepared by impregnation."  

           [3] "EPR revealed V4+O groups pointing out normally from the catalyst surface and sitting in the center of a surface array of oxygen atoms."

           [4] "These V4+ groups helped demonstrate the difference in catalytic behavior of the various samples."
       </Quotes>
       <English>
           The article investigates how tuning oxidation states (V5+ vs V4+), dispersion, and incorporation into the silica framework affects catalytic performance. Highly dispersed isolated V5+O species show better selectivity, while aggregated surface V4+O species lead to overoxidation. 
       </English>
       <Chinese>
           该文探究了调节氧化态(V5+ vs V4+)、分散性以及并入硅酸盐框架如何影响催化性能。高度分散的 V5+O 隔离种显示了更好的选择性,而 V4+O 聚集物种导致过度氧化。

         [1] "The reaction can be kinetically modeled through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism centered on V reduction and subsequent reoxidation."  

         [2] "Indeed, the first reaction step involves V5+, which reduces to V4+ and then to V3+. The active oxidized VOx sites can be promptly restored by oxygen when co-fed with the paraffin."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         The article proposes a Mars-Van Krevelen type mechanism involving reduction of isolated V5+ sites to lower oxidation states V4+ and V3+ upon reaction with propane, followed by reoxidation to V5+ by gas phase oxygen.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         该文提出了Mars-Van Krevelen类型的机理,反应通过丙烷先将分散的V5+位点还原为低氧化态的V4+和V3+,然后气相氧气将其再氧化为V5+。

           [1] "When instead the reaction is carried out in the absence of molecular oxygen, the better isolation of the active sites may effectively control the availability of surface O2 sites and thereby limit the consecutive and parallel total combustion reactions." 
       </Quotes>
       <English>
           The article argues isolation of active sites helps limit overoxidation side reactions by controlling surface oxygen availability, suggesting metal-support interfacial effects play a role under anaerobic reaction conditions.  
       </English>
       <Chinese>
           该文认为活性位点的隔离通过控制表面氧的可获得性有助于限制过度氧化的副反应,这表明在非氧条件下金属支撑体界面效应发挥了作用。
