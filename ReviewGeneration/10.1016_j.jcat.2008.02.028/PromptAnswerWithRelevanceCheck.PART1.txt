[1] "The reaction can be kinetically modeled through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism centered on V reduction and subsequent reoxidation [6], [12]."
[2] "Indeed, the first reaction step involves V5+, which reduces to V4+ and then to V3+."  
[3] "The active oxidized VOx sites can be promptly restored by oxygen when co-fed with the paraffin."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes a Mars-Van Krevelen type mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the VOx/SiO2 catalysts studied. It describes a reaction sequence centered on V5+ active sites that get reduced to V4+ and V3+ upon reaction with propane, releasing an oxygen to the hydrocarbon, followed by re-oxidation of the reduced V species by gas phase O2.   
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

No relevant quotes for questions 1-7.

[1] "Comparing the catalyst prepared with the solgel method containing 7 wt% V2O5 [30] and the V10Si catalyst reported here demonstrates that the two samples behaved similarly under anaerobic conditions (with very similar plots of selectivity to propylene as a function of conversion), but the solgel catalyst gave better selectivity than the FP catalyst under co-feed conditions."

[2] "This indicates that the hydroxyl groups did not play a negative role in selectivity when the reaction was carried out in the absence of molecular oxygen."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

1. The article does not evaluate Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 or other promising metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses solely on vanadium oxide supported on silica catalysts.

2. The article does investigate how properties like oxidation state, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties affect performance. It shows that highly dispersed isolated V5+ species lead to the best selectivity, while aggregated V2O5 clusters lead to poorer performance.

3. The article proposes a Mars-Van Krevelen type mechanism involving alternating reduction and re-oxidation of the vanadium species. Specific intermediates like V4+ and V3+ are described.  

4. The article extensively explores metal-support effects. It shows that incorporating vanadium into the silica framework leads to isolated VOx species with enhanced selectivity under anaerobic conditions.

5. The article does not evaluate any supported noble metal catalysts.

6. Not applicable.

7. Not applicable. 

8. The article compares a flame pyrolysis catalyst to a similar sol-gel catalyst. Under anaerobic conditions they behave similarly but the sol-gel catalyst is more selective in co-feed operation. This suggests exposed hydroxyl groups negatively impact selectivity with molecular oxygen present.

1. 这篇文章没有评估Cr2O3、Pt-Sn、Ga2O3或其他有前景的金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它仅关注硅酸钒催化剂。

2. 这篇文章确实研究了氧化态、氧迁移和酸碱性等属性如何影响性能。它显示高度分散的隔离V5+物种导致最佳选择性,而聚集的V2O5簇导致较差的性能。

3. 这篇文章提出了一个Mars-Van Krevelen类型的机制,涉及钒物种的交替还原和再氧化。 描述了特定的中间产物如V4+和V3+。

4. 这篇文章广泛探讨了金属载体效应。它显示将钒并入硅酸盐框架导致隔离的VOx物种在无氧条件下增强选择性。

5. 这篇文章没有评价任何 Supported 贵金属催化剂。  

6. 不适用。

7. 不适用。

8. 这篇文章比较了火焰喷吹催化剂和类似的溶胶凝胶催化剂。在无氧条件下,它们的行为相似,但溶胶凝胶催化剂在共饲操作中更具选择性。这表明暴露的羟基在存在分子氧的情况下对选择性有负面影响。

[1] "Indeed, the first reaction step involves V5+, which reduces to V4+ and then to V3+. The active oxidized VOx sites can be promptly restored by oxygen when co-fed with the paraffin." 
[2] "It seems that V5+ is dispersed on the support in the form of isolated vanadate species, which progressively oligomerize and polymerize with increasing V loading until a monolayer is formed."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes a Mars-Van Krevelen type mechanistic scenario where V5+ active sites reduce to lower oxidation states V4+ and V3+ during propane dehydrogenation, and are re-oxidized by co-fed oxygen. Isolated and oligomeric vanadate species are described as the active sites.  
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 这篇文章提出了Mars-Van Krevelen类型的机理场景,V5+活性位点在丙烷脱氢过程中被还原为较低的氧化态V4+和V3+,并由同时供给的氧气重新氧化。文章描述了隔离的钒酸盐种和寡聚体种是活性位点。

[1] "When instead the reaction is carried out in the absence of molecular oxygen, the better isolation of the active sites may effectively control the availability of surface O2 sites and thereby limit the consecutive and parallel total combustion reactions."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article argues that under anaerobic reaction conditions, better isolation of vanadate active sites helps limit consecutive and parallel combustion reactions by controlling surface oxygen availability. This suggests metal-support interfacial effects play a role.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 这篇文章认为,在非氧条件下进行反应时,更好的隔离钒酸根活性位点有助于通过控制表面氧的可获得性来限制连续和平行的燃烧反应。这表明金属支撑体间的界面效应发挥了作用。

[1] "The active sites of the FP-prepared catalysts appeared as highly dispersed V5+O groups partly incorporated into the silica matrix and interacting poorly with one another."

[2] "Lower dispersion can be achieved at the same V loading with the catalyst prepared by impregnation."  

[3] "EPR revealed V4+O groups pointing out normally from the catalyst surface and sitting in the center of a surface array of oxygen atoms."

[4] "These V4+ groups helped demonstrate the difference in catalytic behavior of the various samples."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of vanadium oxide affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that highly dispersed V5+O groups incorporated into the silica matrix had higher selectivity compared to aggregated V4+O groups on the surface of impregnated catalysts. The V4+ species are reaction intermediates that reflect differences in catalytic behavior.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章探究了调节钒氧化物的氧化态、氧迁移性和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它显示高度分散的嵌入硅矩阵的V5+O团聚物相比表面存在V4+O团聚物的浸渍催化剂具有更高选择性。V4+物种是反应中间体,反映了催化性能的差异。

[1] "The reaction can be kinetically modeled through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism centered on V reduction and subsequent reoxidation."  

[2] "Indeed, the first reaction step involves V5+, which reduces to V4+ and then to V3+."

[3] "The active oxidized VOx sites can be promptly restored by oxygen when co-fed with the paraffin."

[4] "The nature of such active sites has been widely investigated; it seems that V5+ is dispersed on the support in the form of isolated vanadate species, which progressively oligomerize and polymerize with increasing V loading until a monolayer is formed."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the V oxide catalysts. It describes a reaction sequence where propane first reduces isolated V5+ sites to V4+ and then V3+, which are then reoxidized back to V5+ by gaseous oxygen. The nature and distribution of these V5+ sites as isolated vanadates or polymeric vanadates determines activity and selectivity.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章为V氧化物催化剂上的丙烷脱氢提出了Mars-Van Krevelen机理场景。它描述了一个反应序列,丙烷先将分散的V5+位点还原为V4+然后V3+,之后这些位点被气态氧氧化回V5+。这些V5+位点作为分离式钒酸盐或者聚合态钒酸盐的性质和分布决定了活性和选择性。

<quotes>
[1] "The acidity of the support can negatively affect selectivity when low V loading leaves naked acid sites, particularly in the case of alumina-supported samples."  

[2] "High selectivity can be achieved when a VOx monolayer completely covers the support."  

[3] "V loading corresponding to monolayer formation is different for different supports, depending on the Vsupport affinity."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in the VOx/SiO2 catalysts. It shows that residual acid sites on the support with incomplete VOx monolayer coverage can reduce selectivity. The V loading needed to achieve complete monolayer coverage varies with support due to differences in V-support interactions. 
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章探究了VOx/SiO2催化剂中的金属-载体界面效应。它显示载体上残留的酸性位点以及VOx单分子层覆盖不完全都会降低选择性。实现完全单分子层覆盖所需的V负载量因V与载体的相互作用不同而异。
