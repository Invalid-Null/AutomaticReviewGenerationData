<quotes>

[1] "Comparing the V10Si and V10Si-i catalysts also provided additional insights. The two samples exhibited very similar performance in the co-feed mode, but the V10Si sample demonstrated higher selectivity to propylene under anaerobic conditions."

[2] "Because the two catalysts exhibited very similar activity, this difference can be attributed to the different nature of the VOx species."  

[3] "Thus, the advantage of the present FP preparation method over other preparation procedures is the possibility of hosting higher V concentrations without V2O5 segregation, thereby permitting greater selectivity compared with that provided by traditionally prepared catalysts."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article investigates various catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It compares flame pyrolysis (FP) with traditional impregnation methods and shows that FP allows for higher vanadium oxide loadings without aggregation/segregation, leading to more isolated VOx species and higher selectivity. 

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

答:是的,这篇文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的各种催化剂制备方法。它比较了火焰裂解法(FP)和传统的浸渍法,并表明FP允许在更高的钒氧化物载量下而不会聚集/离析,导致更多的隔离VOx物种和更高的选择性。

</Chinese version answer>


<quotes>

[1] "EPR revealed V4+O groups pointing out normally from the catalyst surface and sitting in the center of a surface array of oxygen atoms. These V4+ groups helped demonstrate the difference in catalytic behavior of the various samples."  

[2] "Fig. 3 shows the EPR spectra at r.t. of sample V28Si: (a) as prepared, (b) after deoxygenation, (c) after catalytic use under anaerobic conditions and deoxygenation."  

[3] "The spectral intensity increased markedly after the catalytic reaction under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 3c); this can be explained by considering that the catalytically active centers are V5+, which reduce during reaction in the absence of co-fed oxygen, leading to an increase in the EPR-active V4+ species."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes EPR spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts in situ under anaerobic conditions. It shows that active V5+ species reduce to EPR-active V4+ under these conditions, allowing insights into oxidation state changes during the reaction.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

答:是的,这篇文章利用EPR光谱技术原位研究了在厌氧条件下工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它表明,活性V5+物种在这些条件下被还原为EPR活性的V4+,这使得我们可以洞察反应过程中的氧化态变化。
