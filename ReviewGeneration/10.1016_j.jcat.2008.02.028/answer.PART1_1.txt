[1] "Comparing the catalyst prepared with the solgel method containing 7 wt% V2O5 [30] and the V10Si catalyst reported here demonstrates that the two samples behaved similarly under anaerobic conditions (with very similar plots of selectivity to propylene as a function of conversion), but the solgel catalyst gave better selectivity than the FP catalyst under co-feed conditions."

[2] "This indicates that the hydroxyl groups did not play a negative role in selectivity when the reaction was carried out in the absence of molecular oxygen."

<English version answer>

1. The article does not evaluate Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 or other promising metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses solely on vanadium oxide supported on silica catalysts.

2. The article does investigate how properties like oxidation state, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties affect performance. It shows that highly dispersed isolated V5+ species lead to the best selectivity, while aggregated V2O5 clusters lead to poorer performance.

3. The article proposes a Mars-Van Krevelen type mechanism involving alternating reduction and re-oxidation of the vanadium species. Specific intermediates like V4+ and V3+ are described.  

4. The article extensively explores metal-support effects. It shows that incorporating vanadium into the silica framework leads to isolated VOx species with enhanced selectivity under anaerobic conditions.

5. The article does not evaluate any supported noble metal catalysts.

6. Not applicable.

7. Not applicable. 

8. The article compares a flame pyrolysis catalyst to a similar sol-gel catalyst. Under anaerobic conditions they behave similarly but the sol-gel catalyst is more selective in co-feed operation. This suggests exposed hydroxyl groups negatively impact selectivity with molecular oxygen present.

1. 这篇文章没有评估Cr2O3、Pt-Sn、Ga2O3或其他有前景的金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它仅关注硅酸钒催化剂。

2. 这篇文章确实研究了氧化态、氧迁移和酸碱性等属性如何影响性能。它显示高度分散的隔离V5+物种导致最佳选择性,而聚集的V2O5簇导致较差的性能。

3. 这篇文章提出了一个Mars-Van Krevelen类型的机制,涉及钒物种的交替还原和再氧化。 描述了特定的中间产物如V4+和V3+。

4. 这篇文章广泛探讨了金属载体效应。它显示将钒并入硅酸盐框架导致隔离的VOx物种在无氧条件下增强选择性。

5. 这篇文章没有评价任何 Supported 贵金属催化剂。  

6. 不适用。

7. 不适用。

8. 这篇文章比较了火焰喷吹催化剂和类似的溶胶凝胶催化剂。在无氧条件下,它们的行为相似,但溶胶凝胶催化剂在共饲操作中更具选择性。这表明暴露的羟基在存在分子氧的情况下对选择性有负面影响。
