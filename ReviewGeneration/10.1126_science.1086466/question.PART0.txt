Catalytic, Oxidative Condensation of CH4 to CH3COOH in One Step via CH Activation
Abstract
Acetic acid is an important petrochemical that is currently produced from methane (or coal) in a three-step process based on carbonylation of methanol. We report a direct, selective, oxidative condensation of two methane molecules to acetic acid at 180C in liquid sulfuric acid. Carbon-13 isotopic labeling studies show that both carbons of acetic acid originate from methane. The reaction is catalyzed by palladium, and the results are consistent with the reaction occurring by tandem catalysis, involving methane C-H activation to generate Pd-CH3 species, followed by efficient oxidative carbonylation with methanol, generated in situ from methane, to produce acetic acid.

Natural gas, which is composed primarily of methane, is one of the most abundant, low-cost, carbon-based feed stocks available. In spite of this, we are dependent on dwindling petroleum reserves because efficient technology has not yet been developed to economically convert methane directly to useful products. This is primarily because the C-H bonds of methane are strong, and efficient catalysts have not been developed that can economically, selectively, and directly convert methane to functionalized molecules. Consequently, the development of new, selective, catalysts for direct conversion of methane to useful products is an important challenge in chemistry today (114).
Acetic acid is an important petrochemical that is currently synthesized from methane (or coal) in a three-step capital- and energy-intensive process based on the high-temperature conversion of methane (or coal) to syn-gas, conversion of syn-gas to methanol, and finally carbonylation of the methanol to acetic acid (Scheme 1). Research efforts are being directed at more direct methods to generate acetic acid, such as the oxidation of ethane to acetic acid (15, 16) or the oxidative carbonylation of methane (5, 1721), but no new processes have yet been commercialized. We now report the observation of the direct, one-step, selective, oxidative condensation of two methane molecules to acetic acid in low yields (10%) based on methane. It is anticipated that, with improvements in yield and efficiency, such a direct, one-step conversion of methane to acetic acid (Scheme 1) could be less expensive than the existing multistep processes.
Scheme 1.
Several new catalyst systems have been reported for the selective conversion of methane to functionalized methyl products such as methanol (8, 9), esters (9, 10, 22, 23), sulfonic acid (2426), and acetic acid (5, 1721). In the reported cases of methane conversions to acetic acid, the methyl group of the acetic acid is derived from methane, whereas the carboxylic group is derived from various carbon sources, such as CO (5, 17, 19), CO2 (18), or carboxylic acid (21) reactants. However, to our knowledge, no reaction has been reported where both carbons of acetic acid are derived directly from two methane molecules in a single reaction system.
We have reported two high-yield systems for the low-temperature conversion of methane to methanol based on Hg(II) (22) and Pt(II) (10) catalysts that operate in liquid sulfuric acid. Coupled with acid-stable catalysts, the effectiveness of sulfuric acid as a solvent for the methane reaction can be traced to the poorly nucleophilic, selective oxidizing properties of this acid and the relative stability of heteroatom-containing methyl products such as methanol to overoxidation in this medium. One drawback of this solvent system is the difficulty of separating the methanol product from the sulfuric acid. Given the effectiveness of this solvent in facilitating the selective catalytic conversion of methane, we have been exploring this medium to identify new catalysts (27) and new reaction chemistries for methane conversion to other functionalized molecules, such as acetic acid, that could potentially be more readily separated.
Pd(II) salts have been reported to catalyze the conversion of methane to methanol products in sulfuric acid solvent (10, 22). However, presumably because of reduction of Pd(II) to Pd(0) species and slow reoxidation of the Pd(0), we have found that this system is not as effective as ligated Pt(II) complexes for the conversion of methane to methanol products (28) in sulfuric acid solvent, and we have been investigating the use of ligands to prevent this deactivation. However, unlike the Pt catalysts, we find that, in addition to methanol products, the Pd(II)/H2SO4 system also produces acetic acid (CH3CO2H) (28) in comparable yields to those of methanol and with high selectivity relative to CO2. Thus, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatographymass spectroscopy (GC-MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses of the gas- and liquid-phase products from reaction (29) of methane with 96% sulfuric acid containing 20 mM PdSO4 show that, along with methanol, acetic acid is produced in comparable amounts with a combined selectivity of >90% and >10% yield based on methane converted. The only other products detected were low levels of CO2 (<10% based on added methane); no CO or C2 products were detected. The carbon mass balance was >98% based on unreacted methane, acetic acid, methanol and CO2.

The direct, oxidative condensation of methane to acetic acid in acidic solution is formally an eight-electron oxidation process (Eq. 1) and most likely involves several reaction intermediates. Given the high selectivity of the reaction for methanol and acetic acid (combined selectivity of >90%), it is unlikely that free radicals are involved because this would be expected to lead to low reaction selectivity and predominant formation of CO2. These considerations indicate that there must be both a facile pathway for the formation of acetic acid as well as a mechanism that minimizes decomposition.
Consistent with these considerations, addition of O2 (known to react rapidly with free radicals) has no effect on the reaction rate or selectivity. Control experiments also showed that acetic acid is more stable than methanol in hot sulfuric acid and is resistant to overoxidation even in the presence of Pd catalysts. However, these observations do not fully explain how the acetic acid is formed so efficiently and selectively. Given the unusual selectivity, novelty of the condensation reaction, and consistent reports (5, 1721) that the conversion of methane to acetic acid requires other carbon sources such as CO, carboxylic groups, or CO2 as precursors to the carboxylic group, we investigated the system in more detail. To confirm the origins of both carbons of the acetic acid, we examined the reaction with the use of >98% isotopically enriched 13C methane (30).
The 13C NMR spectrum of the crude reaction mixture resulting from reaction of 13CH4 with 20 mM PdSO4 in 96% H2SO4 is shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen (by comparison to the 13C signal for the benzene external standard), both carbon resonances for acetic acid, δ = 20.2 and δ = 192.4 for the 13CH3- and -13CO2 groups, respectively [as well as those for methanol and methyl bisulphate, δ = 57.5 and δ = 60.5, respectively (28)], show 13C enrichment and confirm that these products could be derived from the added methane. More definitively, the NMR spectrum also shows that both of the 13C resonances of the acetic acid exhibit clean doublet splitting patterns that is possible only if both carbons are derived from the >98% 13C-enriched methane. At this level of 13C enrichment of the methane, any singlet resonances of the acetic acid carbons would indicate that the neighboring carbon was derived from some 12C source and not from the added methane. GC-MS analysis of the acetic acid (obtained after hydrolysis and neutralization of the crude reaction mixture from 13CH4 reaction) independently confirmed this result.

The reaction is Pd-catalyzed, because no products are observed in the absence of added PdSO4 and the reaction rate is dependent on both the methane pressure and the concentration of PdSO4. An oxidant is required for the formation of acetic acid because, although low levels of methanol are produced with PdSO4 in CF3SO3H (a poorly oxidizing acid), no acetic acid is observed. Sulfuric acid is the oxidant in the reaction on the basis of the observed formation of SO2. A reaction stoichiometry is shown in Eq. 2:
\[ \[\ 2\mathrm{CH}_{4}+4\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{SO}_{4}-\mathrm{Pd}(\mathrm{II}){\rightarrow}\mathrm{CH}_{3}\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{H}\ \] \]
\[ \[\ +4\mathrm{SO}_{2}+6\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}\ \] \]

As seen in Fig. 2 and Table 1 (entries 1, 2, and 4), the selectivities for methanol and acetic acid are time-dependent, with higher selectivity for methanol at shorter reaction times and for acetic acid at longer reaction times. The reaction is quite selective, and the combined selectivity for methanol and acetic acid is 90% over the course of the reaction. The rate of formation of both products decreases with time and effectively stops after about 7 hours, limiting the efficiency of the reaction. Because Pd black is also observed to be formed with time, this loss of activity is likely due to loss of soluble Pd(II) as an active catalyst. The reactions are reproducible with a 10 to 15% accuracy. On the basis of a catalytic Pd(II)/(0) redox cycle with acetic acid resulting from an eight-electron and methanol from a two-electron oxidation, turnover numbers (TON) of 5 to 18 and a catalyst turnover frequency (TOF) of 103 s1 (after 1 hour) at 180C can be calculated. Maximum yields of methanol and acetic acid of 12% based on added methane are observed before catalytic activity is lost.

To determine what intermediates were involved in this eight-electron oxidative condensation reaction and what processes could account for the efficient coupling of the methane derived carbons to form the C-C bond in acetic acid, we examined the reaction mechanism. Some possible reaction pathways that are considered are shown in Scheme 2. On the basis of the observation that the selectivities for methanol and acetic acid are time-dependent, it seemed likely that methanol was an intermediate to acetic acid. Two fundamentally different pathways that involve methanol as an intermediate are possible. In pathway A, two methanol molecules oxidatively condense to acetic acid. In this case, both carbons of acetic acid are derived from the methanol. Such a process could conceivably occur via a methanol carbonylation reaction with some CO source (either free CO, other reactive C1 species formed at low steady-state concentrations below our level of detection, or other species such as Pd-CO complexes) being generated from the in situ oxidation of methanol by sulfuric acid [catalyzed by Pd(0) or Pd(II)]. In pathway B, methane and methanol that is generated in situ from methane oxidatively condense to generate acetic acid. In this case, one carbon of the acetic acid would be derived directly from methane and the other from methanol. Such a process could involve the reaction of Pd-CH3 species, generated from electrophilic C-H activation of methane by Pd(II), with CO to generate Pd-COCH3 species that produce acetic acid. Two other less likely pathways that we have considered are C and D. Pathway C was considered because CO2 is observed as a product and the coupling of CO2 and CH4 had been reported (18, 31). Pathway D was considered even though ethane or other Cn products were not observed; such species could be formed at low steady-state concentrations, and both the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane (or other C2 products) (1) and the oxidation of ethane to acetic acid are known reactions (15, 16).
Scheme 2.
As expected, given the unfavorable thermodynamics for CH4/CO2 coupling (31), reactions with 13CH4/12CO2 mixtures (10:1 molar ratio, 98% 13C enrichment) readily ruled out pathway C. Thus, although acetic acid is formed in this reaction, the diagnostic doublet pattern in the 13C NMR that was observed for both the CH3- and -CO2 groups of acetic acid unambiguously show that only 13CH313CO2H is formed. Thus, both carbons originate from 13CH4. To distinguish between pathways A, B, and D, we separately examined reactions starting with mixtures of 12CH4/13CH3OH and 13CH4/12CH3OH (32). Thus, when the reaction was carried out starting with the 12CH4/13CH3OH mixture and examined early in the reaction (33), pathway A should lead to 13CH313CO2H and the diagnostic doublet pattern in the 13C NMR spectrum due to 13C-13C coupling. In contrast, pathway B should lead to a singlet pattern resulting from formation of 12CH313CO2H (or 13CH312CO2H), and pathway D should show no 13C-enriched acetic acid because only 12CH312CO2H would form in this case. Interestingly, 13C analysis of the crude reaction mixture after 15 min of reaction show that the only 13C-enriched acetic acid produced is 12CH313CO2H, as shown by the large singlet resonance for the -13CO2H group at δ = 192.4 and the complete absence of any resonance at δ = 20.2 (Fig. 3). Consistent with this result, when the reaction was carried out with the 13CH4/12CH3OH mixture at short reaction times, the only 13C-enriched acetic acid produced was 13CH312CO2H. These experiments rule out pathways A and D and show that the C-C bond of acetic acid is assembled via pathway B from methane and methanol.
Fig. 3. 13C NMR of reaction mixture starting with 12CH4 and 13CH3OH.
Pathway B requires that the oxidative condensation of CH4 with CH3OH be extremely efficient because of the high selectivity for formation of acetic acid relative to CO2. Thus, this reaction must take place without extensive overoxidation of the methanol to CO2 and also must be compatible with the activation of methane. The selective carbonylation of methane with CO under superacid conditions without transition metal catalysts has been reported (34). However, such an acid-catalyzed mechanism is unlikely in this system because control experiments based on reactions of 13CH4/12CH3OH/H2SO4 mixtures showed that no acetic acid is formed without added Pd(II). The reactions with 12CH4/13CH3OH also show that the majority of the CO2 produced is generated from slow overoxidation of the CH3OH rather than directly from methane. Thus, it is plausible that pathway B operates by the oxidation of methanol to generate a CO species (see below) that efficiently carbonylates Pd-CH3 species formed from methane CH activation to generate acetic acid. To examine whether free CO could be an intermediate for path B, we examined the reaction starting with a 20:1 13CH4/12CO mixture. In this case, the added CO effectively inhibited most of the reaction of methane (Table 1, entry 5). Thus, in this experiment very little methane conversion was observed, and instead the 12CO is predominantly oxidized to 12CO2 with concomitant reduction of Pd(II) to Pd black. However, low levels (8 mM) of 13CH312CO2H (major product) and 13CH3OH (minor product) could be observed as the only 13C-enriched products.
Given the rapid decomposition of the catalyst with added CO, this result is ambiguous but does show that free CO can be used for the oxidative carbonylation of methane in this methane-activation system. Critically, the formation of acetic acid as the major product (albeit at low levels) shows that the carbonylation of the presumed Pd-CH3 species must be efficient. This experiment also highlights an important consideration in developing processes based on oxidative condensation of CH4 and CO to acetic acid: The competing oxidation of CO to CO2 must be overcome to maintain high selectivity relative to CO (which costs more than methane).
Our results indicate that in the PdSO4/H2SO4 system, where methanol is the carbonylation agent, this selectivity issue is not as critical and points to a possible strategy to selectively generate acetic acid from methane. To explain all of the observations, we propose that the system operates by tandem catalysis involving some CO species formed from oxidation of methanol as shown in Fig. 4. Key to the reaction is the proposed electrophilic CH activation of methane by homogeneous Pd(II) to generate Pd-CH3 species that is facilitated by the strongly acidic sulfuric solvent. This species can generate methanol as observed. Although this methanol is protected in sulfuric acid and can be selectively generated, control experiments show that, in the presence of either Pd(II) or Pd(0) (added as Pd black), slow decomposition can occur to generate CO2. Because control experiments show that the slow overoxidation of methanol in sulfuric acid containing Pd(II) leads to formation of insoluble Pd(0) species, the buildup of methanol would be expected to lead to reaction inhibition as observed (Fig. 2). We propose that, in this overoxidation, a low steady-state concentration of some CO species is generated. This CO then can either be oxidized to CO2 or react with Pd-CH3 species to generate acetic acid. For this mechanism to be consistent with the observations that methanol is not carbonylated, i.e., that pathway A, Scheme 2, does not operate, the methanol must be produced irreversibly from the Pd-CH3 species.
Fig. 4. Proposedtandem catalysis scheme consistent with observations.
We believe that the reason the reaction produces more acetic acid with only CH4 as reactant versus CH4/CO mixtures is related to catalyst stability. As can be seen from the proposed reaction scheme in Fig. 4, the reoxidation of Pd(0) species to homogeneous Pd(II) with sulfuric acid, which we believe is the rate-determining step, is common to all the proposed tandem catalytic cycles. We favor this proposed tandem cycle, because any large disparity between the rate of formation and the rate of reoxidation of Pd(0) species in any of the cycles can lead to reduction in the steady-state concentration of the active, homogeneous, Pd(II) catalyst that will effectively slow all the catalytic cycles. Thus, although added CO can be expected to be beneficial for formation of acetic acid, at high concentrations of CO the rate of reduction of Pd(II) with CO outpaces the rate of reoxidation of Pd(0), and the tandem system effectively shuts down. However, at low concentrations of CO, presumably generated in the slow oxidation of methanol, the rate balance in the tandem Pd(II)/Pd(0) cycles can be maintained for longer times.
The proposal that the reaction proceeds by the efficient carbonylation of Pd-CH3 by CO species generated in situ from methanol oxidation, without excessive overoxidation to CO2, lends support to our ongoing efforts to redesign the highly efficient, dichloro[η-2-(2,2-bipyrimidyl)]platinum(II)/H2SO4 methane CH-activation system we reported in 1998 for converting methane to methanol in >70% yield (10) for the generation of acetic acid instead of methanol. This reported system does not generate acetic acid, but, on the basis of this work, it may be possible to use the methanol generated by this system for the in situ carbonylation of the Pt-CH3 species to produce acetic acid. If high yields of acetic acid instead of methanol could be generated, this could address a major disadvantage of this reported Pt(II) system, because acetic acid could be more readily separated from the sulfuric acid media than methanol. Initial studies are encouraging, because test reactions of CH4/CO mixtures with CF3SO3H containing the dichloro[η-2-(2,2-bipyrimidyl)]platinum(II) catalyst produce only acetic acid; no methanol is observed, indicating that the in situ carbonylation of the Pt-CH3 intermediates (formed by CH activation of methane) is possible in this system.
