 Here are the relevant quotes and answers to each question:

[1] "The greatest current challenges for PDH are coke formation and sintering of the catalyst, which severely reduces activity and stability." 

[2] "Pt-based catalysts have been found to be very effective for direct dehydrogenation of paraffin as early as the 1940s, and it was used in the Pacol process (UOP), which is the first industrial and commercial alkane dehydrogenation technology and had been developed for propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) later."

[3] "Many experimental and theoretical studies have been performed to understand the reaction pathway and mechanism of PDH on Pt catalysts, aiming to tackle these challenges."

[4] "In PDH, the reactions generally happen in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first, second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."

[5] "The precursor of coke could result from either propylene deep dehydrogenation or CC bond breaking."

[6] "To prevent coke formation and increase Pt catalyst stability, it is of pivotal importance to correctly describe and understand the process of the side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation and CC bond breaking."

[1] "The calculations indicate that the barriers of dehydrogenation are lower than those of CC bond breaking until R28." 

[2] "After that, the activation barriers of CH and CC bond breaking become close to each other, as shown in Figure 8. This step corresponds to the cracking of propyne."
