Propylene is a key raw material in chemical industry. It is used to synthesize various chemicals, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide, and the demand for propylene is growing steadily. 
Pt-based catalysts have been found to be very effective for direct dehydrogenation of paraffin as early as the 1940s, and it was used in the Pacol process (UOP), which is the first industrial and commercial alkane dehydrogenation technology and had been developed for propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) later.
