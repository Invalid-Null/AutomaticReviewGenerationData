Revealing the Janus Character of the Coke Precursor in the Propane Direct Dehydrogenation on Pt Catalysts from a kMC Simulation

Abstract
As the commercial catalyst in the propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction, one of the biggest challenges of Pt catalysts is coke formation, which severely reduces activity and stability. In this work, a first-principles DFT-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulation (kMC) is performed to understand the origin of coke formation, and an effective method is proposed to curb coke. The conventional DFT calculations give a complete description of the reaction pathway of dehydrogenation to propylene, deep dehydrogenation, and C–C bond cracking. The rate-limiting step is identified as the dissociative adsorption of propane. Moreover, a comparison between different exchange-correlation functionals indicates the importance of van der Waals corrections for the adsorption of propane and propylene. The lateral interactions between the surface adsorbates are significant, which implies that mean field microkinetic modeling might not adequately describe the reaction process. There are two distinct stages in PDH, which are quick deactivation and steady state, respectively, as revealed from the kMC simulation. The precursor of coke mainly formed during the quick deactivation. The calculations indicate that the geometries of the active sites for the dehydrogenation and deep reactions are different. Therefore, the availability of surface sites is a crucial factor in the formation of propylene and side products. The active sites from quick deactivation are mainly occupied by C2/C1 species, which are hard to remove. On the other hand, the surface sites that are left are mainly active toward dehydrogenation to propylene due to the geometry constraint. Therefore, a stable activity and selectivity is reached. Furthermore, the effect of hydrogen molecules in the input stream is also explored. The calculations indicate that the inclusion of hydrogen in PDH reactants not only enhances the forward reactions to the propylene formation but also reduces the consumption of the resulted propylene during the reaction. Therefore, hydrogen is very helpful to the selectivity increase in PDH in addition to other effects. Overall, the current study lays out a solid base for the future optimization of the Pt catalysts in PDH and we propose that the fine control of the surface sites on Pt has paramount importance in reducing coke formation.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Short alkane molecule (C1–C3) activation is always a formidable task for catalytic conversion. They are very stable and nonpolar molecules. The bond energy of C–H varies from 410.4 to 439.3 kJ/mol. (1,2) Even more challenging, products such as ethylene and propylene are less stable than the corresponding alkane molecules, which implies that products are prone to deep reaction and a decent selectivity is difficult to achieve. One of the important catalytic routes for alkane activation is catalytic dehydrogenation. Depending on whether an oxidant is used or not, this route can be categorized as direct or oxidative dehydrogenation. (3) The product from a dehydrogenation reaction such as propylene is a key raw material in chemical industry. It is used to synthesize various chemicals, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide, and the demand for propylene is growing steadily. (4) Pt-based catalysts have been found to be very effective for direct dehydrogenation of paraffin as early as the 1940s, (3) and it was used in the Pacol process (UOP), which is the first industrial and commercial alkane dehydrogenation technology and had been developed for propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) later. (4) The greatest current challenges for PDH are coke formation and sintering of the catalyst, which seriously undermine the stability and require the periodic regeneration of the catalyst. Many experimental and theoretical studies have been performed to understand the reaction pathway and mechanism of PDH on Pt catalysts, aiming to tackle these challenges. (5−18)
In PDH, the reactions generally happen in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first, second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration. The precursors of coke could result from either propylene deep dehydrogenation or C–C bond breaking. To prevent coke formation and increase Pt catalyst stability, it is of pivotal importance to correctly describe and understand the process of the side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation and C–C bond breaking. First-principles DFT calculations have made significant progress along this direction. Valcárcel et al. reported the DFT study of thermodynamics of 18 elementary reactions of the propylene dehydrogenation to propylidyne on a Pt(111) surface. (19,20) From the calculations, it is indicated that propylidyne is the most stable species from the dehydrogenation of propylene. Furthermore, the conversion between propylene and propylidyne is thermodynamically favorable. This study clearly reveals that the propylene from PDH could easily undergo deep dehydrogenation. In another DFT study, Yang et al. reached a similar conclusion that propylidyne is the most stable species during the dehydrogenation of propylene. (11) In addition, propyne is predicted to be the starting point for C–C bond breaking. Hauser et al. used a subnanometer Pt4 cluster as a computational model and studied the PDH reaction pathway. (21) The calculations revealed that the propylene is very stable on Pt catalysts and product desorption needs to conquer the largest energy barrier among all elementary steps during the reaction. The strong binding of propylene on Pt catalysts could lead to side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation and decrease the selectivity. Similar phenomena have been reported in other computational studies as well. Nykänen et al. (12) revealed that the binding energy of propylene is around 0.5 eV on Pt(111) and 0.8 eV on Pt(211), respectively, which indicates the better reactivity of atoms at steps. Moreover, it has been found that the addition of Sn can significantly reduce the binding energy of propylene because of the shift of the d-band center. Furthermore, the work of Yang et al. (14) showed that the second Sn metal addition can increase the barrier of deep dehydrogenation of adsorbed species, which improves the selectivity, and 3:1 has been determined to be the best ratio for PtSn alloy for propane dehydrogenation. Recently, an understanding of light alkane activation at the molecular level has been summarized from a computational perspective (22) and further improvements in catalytic performance by adding a second metal have been revealed. (23,24)
The aforementioned computational studies mostly used the mean field approximation, which is averaged over the spatial dimension. On the other hand, the lateral interactions between adsorbates, spatial inhomogeneous considerations, and dynamic structure evolution are very important for an understanding of the surface catalytic reaction. In particular, a heterogeneous catalytic reaction such as PDH involves a very complex reaction network and various intermediates, as shown in Figure 1, which is likely not be adequately described by the mean field methods. On the other hand, the kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method captures the stochastic nature of the complex events and reveals the dynamic properties. It has been extensively employed in heterogeneous catalysis studies. (25−28) The coke formation during PDH is the major reason for the Pt catalyst deactivation and severely shortens the catalyst life. Although tremendous progress has been made from computational simulations, a detailed description of the coke formation on the Pt catalysts in PDH is still lacking due to the stochastic and dynamic nature of the process. Therefore, the kMC method is applied in this work, aiming to unravel the nature of the coke formation and supply a practical method to increase the selectivity. In this work, a total of 50 elementary steps in PDH are considered, which cover the process from the first C–H bond activation to the C–C bond cracking. The adsorption of reactants and hydrogen is evaluated by both RPBE and BEEF-vdW functionals. The reaction free energy, barrier, rate constant, and pre-exponential factor are obtained from the DFT-BEEF-vdW calculations. On the basis of these thermal and kinetic parameters from DFT, kMC is performed on Pt(111) surfaces. The reaction process with time evolution is revealed; in particular the origin of formation of the coke precursor is discussed. Moreover, the positive effects on reactivity from hydrogen molecules are also indicated. The current study makes a significant contribution to curb the coke formation in PDH and pave the way to novel Pt-based catalysts for PDH.

The calculations reported here were performed by using periodic density functional theory as implemented in the form of the Vienna ab initio simulation package (29−31) (VASP). For valence electrons, a plane-wave basis set was adopted with an energy cutoff of 400 eV and the ionic cores were described with the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method. (32,33) The Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF–vdW) (34) was used as the exchange-correlation functional approximation. In some cases, the RPBE (35) functional was also used for comparison purposes. A 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid was used to sample the Brillouin zone. A four-layer slab with a p(3 × 3) supercell whose bottom layer is fixed was used to model the Pt(111) surface, and the thickness of the vacuum region is 12 Å. The reaction pathways and energy barriers were calculated by using the climbing nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method. (36) The total energy and band structure energy were converged to an accuracy of 1 × 10−7 eV/atom to obtain accurate forces, and a force tolerance of 0.03 eV/Å was used in all structure optimizations. Those parameters were tested to be sufficient to yield accurate results, as shown in Table S1.
The correction of zero-point energy (ZPE) was calculated by
where h is Planck’s constant and vi is the vibrational frequency calculated by DFT.
The kMC simulation was carried out with the Zacros software package. (37,38) Three surface models were used in our simulations, which consist of 40 × 40, 20 × 20, and 5 × 5 rhombic unit cells, respectively. Each unit cell includes one atop site and one fcc hollow site, as shown in Figure 2, and the side length of the unit cell is 2.77 Å. Therefore, the side of our surface model is 11.08 nm, and the species on the edges can cross the boundary of the surface. To simulate the experimental reaction conditions, the temperature was set to be 873 K and the total pressure was set to be 1 atm. The lateral interaction between surface adsorbates was evaluated by cluster expansion Hamiltonians. (38,39)

3.1. DFT Results
3.1.1. Adsorption of Propane and Propylene
The interactions between the reactant (propane) and product (propylene) with catalysts have apparent importance for PDH. Three different exchange-correlation functionals are employed to calculate the binding energy of propane and propylene on Pt(111): RPBE, RPBE-vdW, (40) and BEEF-vdW, respectively. The optimized adsorbed structures of propane and propylene are shown in Figure 3, and binding energies are shown in Table 1. Short alkane molecules such as propane are generally physisorbed on the catalyst surface, which was also observed in our previous work. (41,42) The calculated adsorption energies of propane from RPBE, RPBE-vdW, and BEEF-vdW functionals are −0.01, −0.35, and −0.30 eV, respectively. The adsorption energies from RPBE-vdW and BEEF-vdW are close to each other and significantly greater than that from RPBE. This clearly indicates that van der Waals forces make an important contribution to the propane adsorption. On the other hand, the distance between propane and Pt(111) is around 3 Å, as shown in Figure 3. The bond distance suggests that this is mainly an intermolecular interaction. In contrast, propylene has a much stronger adsorption on Pt(111). The adsorption energies calculated from RPBE, RPBE-vdW, and BEEF-vdW are −0.56, −1.68, and −1.06 eV under 1/9 ML coverage, respectively. The binding energy of propylene is much higher than that of propane. The strong binding of propylene hinders the desorption of propylene, which could lead to the deep dehydrogenation. The energies calculated by the RPBE functional are low in comparison with experimental measurements (−0.75 eV) (43) and computational results (−0.93 eV (1/9 ML)). (11) Considering the performance of the molecule adsorption, the BEEF-vdW functional was employed in our calculations.

3.1.2. Adsorption Energy and Geometric Configuration of H
Hydrogen as the product in PDH has a significant influence on the reaction equilibrium. Conventionally, hydrogen is introduced together with propane in PDH industrial production. The adsorption configuration of hydrogen atoms on Pt(111) has been optimized and is shown in Figure 4. Four different sites (atop, bridge, fcc, and hcp) are considered for the hydrogen adsorption. The binding energies of hydrogen atoms are −3.57, −3.42, −3.40, and −3.45 eV at atop, bridge, fcc, and hcp sites, respectively. The most favorable site of H adsorption on Pt(111) is the atop site, which is different from that determined in a previous computational report. (11) The bond distance at the atop site is 1.56 Å, which is also the shortest distance among the four investigated sites. The van der Waals force correction might account for the different favorable site identification for the hydrogen adsorption. (12)

3.1.3. Propane Activation and Surface Reactions
Under the real conditions of PDH, gas inputs consist of propane and hydrogen. Therefore, the surface reaction network falls into three types: CxHy species dehydrogenation, CxHy species cracking, and dissociation of hydrogen.
The elementary steps considered in the calculations are shown in Table 2. The geometric configurations of the transition state (TS) of H–H, C–H, and C–C breaking reactions are shown in Figure 5–7, respectively. For dissociation of the hydrogen molecule, the hydrogen molecule is slightly stretched in the TS, in which the bond distance is 0.78 Å while the counterpart in the gas phase is 0.74 Å. The barrier is estimated to be 0.17 eV, as shown in Table 2. The TS shown in Figures 6 and 7 can be categorized into three groups: (1) reactions leading to propylene formation (R1, R2, R4, R5), (2) reactions leading to propylene deep dehydrogenation (R3, R6–R17), and (3) reactions of C–C bond breaking. At transition states, the breaking bonds C–H and C–C are significantly elongated. The calculations indicate that the barriers of dehydrogenation are lower than those of C–C bond breaking until R28. After that, the activation barriers of C–H and C–C bond breaking become close to each other, as shown in Figure 8. This step corresponds to the cracking of propyne.

During the surface reaction, the different elementary steps have unique requirements for the available sites on the catalysts. In detail, two, three, and four/five Pt atoms on the catalyst surface are required for the reaction steps R1 and R2, R3–R6, and R7–R29, respectively. It is obvious that reactions are unable to proceed when the required sites are occupied.
3.2. kMC Calculations
3.2.1. Rate Constant and Lateral Interactions
The most stable geometric configurations are used to represent the adsorption states in kMC. The rate of every elementary step is calculated by eq 1, and the barriers are shown in Table 2. Another parameter that needs to be evaluated is the pre-exponential factor. As shown in the Supporting Information, the pre-exponential factor has different forms regarding the various surface reaction processes and the calculated pre-exponential factors are also shown in Table 2.
The lateral interaction will influence the adsorption energy, activation energy, etc., and those effects can be included by an effective cluster interaction (ECI), which replaces the Ising model by the lattice-gas convention. (39) The results of lateral interaction are shown in Table S2. The nearest-neighbor lateral interactions among Cx spices (x = 1–3) and hydrogen are considered. From Table S2, the lateral interactions of up to 0.4 eV between C1 and C1 are significantly greater than others. Therefore, there is a significant contribution from the lateral interaction.
3.2.2. Reaction Path of PDH
The kMC simulations can yield the number of each elementary step occurring which can serve to estimate the reaction flow as a function of consumption of propane, as shown in Figure 9. From Figure 9, the most favorable reaction pathway is revealed. It is found that first dehydrogenation of propane is preferred by R2 over R1, as 70.81% of propane became 2-propyl, which means that secondary hydrogen abstraction is more favorable than primary hydrogen abstraction, although the two reactions have the similar reaction barrier. Furthermore, 54.97% of activated propane is converted into propylene in the gas phase. The main path of propane dehydrogenation to propylene is R2 and R5. The other 45.03% of propane has been consumed by intermediates, deep dehydrogenation, and cracking. Deep dehydrogenation mainly occurs via R6 and R10, and the cracking occurs via R28. Moreover, the intermediates during the reaction are not accumulated on the catalyst surfaces; most of them are quickly reacted and consumed. This observation implies that the surface reactions are not the rate-determining step (RDS).

3.2.3. Origin of Deactivation of the Catalyst
To further understand the reaction process, in particular at the beginning of the reaction, the consumption speed of propane and selectivity of propylene are correlated with time, as shown in Figure 10. It is clearly indicated from the consumption of propane that there are two stages in the reaction. In the first stage, the consumption speed is decreasing rapidly. In the meantime, the selectivity of propylene increases quickly. It can be concluded that the surface reactions including both C–H and C–C bond activation rapidly occur at this stage. In the second stage, both the consumption rate of propane and the selectivity of propylene become stable and do not show significant variations with reaction progress. Therefore, it is suggested that the reaction reaches an equilibrium state. Overall, the PDH reaction can be divided into two different stages: quick deactivation and steady states, respectively. In the quick deactivation state, all active sites are available and are exposed to the reactants (propane and hydrogen) at the beginning of the reactions. Therefore, this causes a high consumption rate of propane. Both dehydrogenation to form propylene and side reactions including deep dehydrogenation and C–C bond cracking easily take place because of the large amount of available free sites, as shown in Figure 11a. On the other hand, the geometry of the available free sites is very important, in particular for side reactions. A deep dehydrogenation reaction, for example R7, requires an arrangement of four neighboring active sites in a special shape, as shown in Figure 6. At the beginning, the clean Pt surface supplies abundant sites for the dehydrogenation/side reactions, which explains the large consumption rate of propane. As shown in Figure 11c, 91.3% of converted propane is consumed in side reactions. With reaction progress, 69.3% of active sites have been occupied by surface species, as shown in Figure 11b. On the Pt surface, it is estimated that 89.7% of surface species are C1/2, which occupy a majority of active sites. This also explains the quick decline in the propane consumption rate, as the active sites are almost occupied. Moreover, the simulation also indicates that the C1/2 species is difficult to remove and block the sites for propylene formation. However, there is still left some small block of free sites on the catalyst surface, as shown in Figure 11b. Those sites maintain the activity of PDH and the selectivity. On the other hand, the cracking and deep dehydrogenation reactions have difficulty in proceeding due to the limited available sites at the steady stage, as the adsorbate/TS in deep dehydrogenation/cracking needs four or five neighboring sites in a special shape as discussed above. The identification of quick deactivation and steady states from the simulation is consistent with the experimental observations. (5,17) For example, Weckhuysen’s group used operando Raman to investigate the coke formation during PDH on Pt catalysts. (44) It is indicated that coke immediately formed and quickly accumulated in the first few minutes after catalyst exposure to propane. This is exactly corresponding to the fast deactivation stage as revealed from the simulation.

Snapshots and species statistics at 5 × 10–4 s and 2 × 10–2 s: (a, b) snapshots of the 20 × 20 lattice, with H atoms shown in blue, C3 species in red, and C2/1 species in black; (c, d) statistics of surface species of (a) and (b), respectively. The numbers abc* along the x axis represent CHaCHbCHc* species (for example, 322* represents the subscript numbers in CH3CH2CH2*).
From the above discussions, the importance of the arrangement of the free sites is clearly revealed. To investigate this effect in detail on a longer time scale, a smaller 5 × 5 lattice model was used in the kMC simulation. Although the smaller cell is more sensitive to dimensional fluctuations, it can still capture the essential effects of the variations of surface sites on the catalytic reactivity. The time evolution of TOF and selectivity is shown in Figure 12. The selectivity of propylene decreases rapidly from 0.019 to 0.028 s and increase agains from 0.052 to 0.063 s. Undoubtedly, these fluctuations of the reaction reflect the changes in the catalyst surface. As shown in Figure 13, the snapshots of two representative time frames during the reaction revealed the changes in available surface sites. The selectivity decreased quickly at 0.019 s, as shown in the first frame (the similarity of the surface site geometry to that in the first frame is around 70.6% in the investigated time period) in Figure 13. There are a great number of adjoining free active sites which are available for both dehydrogenation and deep reactions. The competition between propylene formation and deep reactions causes a decrease in selectivity. At the fast increase stage of selectivity, as shown in the second frame (the similarity of the surface site geometry to that in the second frame is around 83.3% in the investigated time period) in Figure 13, the free active sites are much reduced and connected to each other and become only suitable for dehydrogenation to propylene. On the other hand, the deep reactions are prohibited, as there are missing regular triangle sites. Therefore, the selectivity is sharply increased. Overall, the calculations clearly indicate the relation between the surface sites and the reaction rate/selectivity. It is very straightforward to deduce that the catalytic surface reaction requires a special geometry of the active sites. For example, R1 and R2 need two sites, and R3–R6 need three neighboring sites, but the reactions after R6 need four sites which must contain at least one regular triangle, as shown in Figure 6. The importance of the active site geometry is also revealed from the studies on the Sn promoter effect in PDH. It has been suggested that Sn addition will decrease the size of the Pt catalyst ensemble. It is found that a smaller Pt ensemble inhibits side reactions. (15) This observation is consistent with the results from current work that the side reactions need more surface sites. Therefore, the dehydrogenation to propylene and side reactions in PDH are governed by the competition for the available active sites, which is revealed from the kMC simulation.

3.2.4. Effect of H2
As mentioned before, hydrogen is mixed with propane as the input stream in industrial PDH. It is naturally expected that H2 can reduce the coke and regenerate active sites. Furthermore, experiments and simulations show that the input of H2 can also increase the selectivity and activity of the Pt catalyst without a promoter. (5,45) To understand this effect, the selectivities of propylene with input of pure propane or a propane/H2 mixture in PDH are calculated (the partial pressure of hydrogen is 1 kPa). Through a comparison, the selectivity of propylene is increased by 9.81% when hydrogen is present. Furthermore, calculations indicate that the hydrogen can enhance the forward reactions of R4/R5, which produce more adsorbed propylene, and the backward reactions of R9/R10, which lead to more adsorbed propylene from the hydrogenation of products from the deep dehydrogenation reactions. From Figure 14, more propane (from 85.82% to 88.29%) is converted to the adsorbed propylene in R4/R5 reactions after H2 addition. On the other hand, the consumption of propylene is decreased from 6.05% to −1.31% for R9/R10 reactions. The negative value means that the backward reactions of R9/R10 exceed the forward reactions. Therefore, more propylene is obtained. In short, the increase in the forward reaction is higher than that in the backward reaction for R4 and R5, while the inverse is true for R9 and R10. From an analysis, it is indeed seen that hydrogen can increase the selectivity of PDH. On the other hand, the activity of the Pt catalyst is also improved, as the number of both forward and backward reactions is significantly increased after introduction of hydrogen, as shown in Figure 14.

The percentages are obtained by dividing the number of the reaction by the consumption of propane (positive values of R4 and R5 represent product propylene, and positive of values of R9 and R10 represent consumption of propylene). Gray indicates a forward reaction and red a backward reaction.
4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In the current work, DFT calculations have been devoted to the understanding of the reaction network for propylene formation and side reactions, including deep dehydrogenation and cracking. Furthermore, kMC simulations have been performed to reveal the coke evolution during the reaction. The critical steps in the reaction pathway and the origin of the coke formation are indicated. Moreover, the effect of hydrogen molecules in the input stream is also discussed. The main conclusions from the current work are summarized below.
(1) The detailed reaction pathway to propylene formation and side reactions are revealed. The transformation from propane to propylene mainly occurs via the pathway R2 → R5 with minor contributions from the pathway R1 → R4. Deep dehydrogenations occur via R6 → R11 and R10 and finally lead to the cracking of C3 species. The cracking mainly starts from propyne. The rate-limiting step of PDH is identified as the dissociative adsorption of propane. The calculations of propane and propylene adsorption indicate the importance of van der Waals corrections.
(2) The availability of active sites is crucial for both propylene and coke formations. The dehydrogenation to propylene, deep dehydrogenation, and cracking need two, three, and four sites at least, respectively. The kMC simulations reveal that there are quick deactivation and steady states during PDH. The quick deactivation occurs because most of the active sites are occupied by cracking products which are hardly removed from the surface. However, the coverage of surface species and active sites become stable after quick deactivation, which leads to the steady state. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the geometry of the active sites in the steady state hinders the side reactions, which leads to a stable selectivity. Rational construction of the surface structure of the Pt catalyst might be the key factor in controlling coke formation.
(3) The origin of the hydrogen effect on the selectivity is revealed from the calculations. It is indicated that hydrogen in the input stream not only enhances the forward reactions of propylene formation but also decreases the consumption rate of the adsorbed propylene on the surface. Therefore, selectivity is increased with the presence of hydrogen.
