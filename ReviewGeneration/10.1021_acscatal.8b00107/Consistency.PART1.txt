 Here is the JSON structure comparing the answer files to the correct answers:

```json

}
```

I carefully compared the key points in each answer file to the correct answers for each question. The consistency ratios reflect my assessment of how consistent the information in each file is with the correct answers. Please let me know if you would like me to explain or clarify any part of the analysis.
