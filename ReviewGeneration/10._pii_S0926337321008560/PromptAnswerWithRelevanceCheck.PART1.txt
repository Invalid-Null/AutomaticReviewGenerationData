 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes in the given literature to answer the specified questions. The article does not evaluate metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3 or Pt-Sn for propane dehydrogenation. It also does not investigate tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides, propose mechanistic scenarios over metal oxide catalysts, or explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxides for this reaction. 

The article focuses on supported Pt-Ga bimetallic catalysts coated with silica for propane dehydrogenation, rather than the mono-metallic or metal oxide catalysts asked about in the questions. It does not investigate varying metal particle size, shape, or support interactions of mono-metallic catalysts either. No specific mechanistic pathways are proposed over the studied Pt-Ga catalysts.

Therefore, I cannot provide any relevant quotes or substantive answers for the given questions based on the content of this literature. The questions seem mismatched and unrelated to the focus of this particular article. Please let me know if you would like me to attempt answering questions more relevant to the presented study on Pt-Ga bimetallic catalysts instead.

[1] "Coating silica can also profit to coke removing in the 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst, which promote its catalytic stability during the PDH reaction."

[2] "The exquisite structure of 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst maximizes its catalytic performance by exposing and stabilizing isolated Pt active sites in the Ga clusters of silica and alumina interlayer." 

[3] "The Ga species can be more fixed at clusters state by the protection of thin silica layers in the 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst."

[4] "The Pt active sites also can be anchored by the fixed Ga clusters to improve its catalytic stability during the PDH process."

1. No, the article does not evaluate any metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

2. No, the article does not investigate tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides for propane dehydrogenation. 

3. No, the article does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts.

4. Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Coating the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst with a thin silica layer helps remove coke and improves catalytic stability during propane dehydrogenation [Quote 1]. The interfacial structure maximizes catalytic performance by stabilizing isolated Pt active sites within Ga clusters between the silica and alumina layers [Quote 2]. The silica layers help fix the Ga species in clusters, which anchors the Pt active sites and improves stability [Quotes 3-4].

5. No, the article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. 

6. No, the article does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape and support interactions affect performance of supported metal catalysts.

7. No, the article does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts.
