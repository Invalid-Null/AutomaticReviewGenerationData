[1] "Coating silica can also profit to coke removing in the 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst, which promote its catalytic stability during the PDH reaction."

[2] "The exquisite structure of 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst maximizes its catalytic performance by exposing and stabilizing isolated Pt active sites in the Ga clusters of silica and alumina interlayer." 

[3] "The Ga species can be more fixed at clusters state by the protection of thin silica layers in the 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst."

[4] "The Pt active sites also can be anchored by the fixed Ga clusters to improve its catalytic stability during the PDH process."

<English version answer>

1. No, the article does not evaluate any metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

2. No, the article does not investigate tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides for propane dehydrogenation. 

3. No, the article does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts.

4. Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Coating the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst with a thin silica layer helps remove coke and improves catalytic stability during propane dehydrogenation [Quote 1]. The interfacial structure maximizes catalytic performance by stabilizing isolated Pt active sites within Ga clusters between the silica and alumina layers [Quote 2]. The silica layers help fix the Ga species in clusters, which anchors the Pt active sites and improves stability [Quotes 3-4].

5. No, the article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. 

6. No, the article does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape and support interactions affect performance of supported metal catalysts.

7. No, the article does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts.

1. 不,本文没有评估任何用于丙烷脱氢的金属氧化物催化剂。

2. 不,本文没有研究调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧迁移和酸碱性以用于丙烷脱氢。

3. 不,本文没有提出金属氧化物催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机理场景。

4. 是的,本文探索了PtGa/Al2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的金属-载体界面的效应。在PtGa/Al2O3催化剂表面涂覆一层薄膜二氧化硅有助于除去焦炭,提高催化稳定性[引用1]。界面的结构通过稳定硅与氧化铝层间Ga簇中的隔离Pt活性位点,最大化催化性能[引用2]。二氧化硅层有助于Ga物种固定在簇状,从而锚定Pt活性位点,提高稳定性[引用3-4]。

5. 不,本文没有评估任何用于丙烷脱氢的受支撑单金属催化剂。

6. 不,本文没有研究金属粒子大小、形状和载体相互作用等性质如何影响受支撑金属催化剂的性能。 

7. 不,本文没有提出受支撑金属催化剂上的丙烷脱氢反应机理途径。
