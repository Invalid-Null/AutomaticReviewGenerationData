To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the answers from each file to the correct answers provided. I looked for sentences or key phrases that matched between the two, either identically or conveying the same meaning. For question 1, all files stated that the article did not compare metallic vs oxidized catalysts, so they were marked as 100% consistent.

For question 2, most files agreed with the correct answer that the article evaluated Pt-Ga catalysts and provided performance data. But answer.PART2_0.txt only partially answered the question correctly. Hence I marked it as 67% consistent compared to the other 100% ratings.

The rest of the questions showed full agreement between all answer files and the correct answers, so they were all marked as 100% consistent. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
