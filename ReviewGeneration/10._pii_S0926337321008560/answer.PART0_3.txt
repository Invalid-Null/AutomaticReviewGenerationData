[1] The article provides background on the increasing global demand for propylene stimulated by its large scale production and wide applications in the chemical industry for producing polypropylene, which is an essential material for products like personal protective equipment. 

[2] The article explains that Pt-based catalysts like those used in the Oleflex process facilitate propane dehydrogenation by activating the C-H bonds at lower temperatures compared to the thermal conversion process. The catalysts provide an alternative lower energy pathway to break C-H bonds and form C=C bonds.

[3] The article introduces noble metals like Pt supported on metal oxides like alumina, as well as bimetallic and promoter-modified versions like Pt-Sn, as promising catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Zeolites and metal oxides have also been explored as catalysts.
