[1] Hence, the exploitation of high-activity catalysts capable of good catalytic performance in PDH reaction at low temperature is quite urgent.

[2] The as-prepared 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst shows outstanding catalytic activity (propylene productivity rate 0.5 mol/gcat.·h) close to its equilibrium conversion (24.5%) with much better stability (deactivation constant: 0.007 h1) at 450 C.

[3] Among all the catalysts, the 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 shows the best catalytic performance with 21.8% propane conversion and 90.7% propylene selectivity initially, which is very close to its thermal dynamics equilibrium conversion of propane at this reaction condition, which is 25% at the same reaction condition obtained by HSC thermodynamic simulation.
