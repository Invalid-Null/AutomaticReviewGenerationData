 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes in the given literature to answer the specified questions. The article does not evaluate metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3 or Pt-Sn for propane dehydrogenation. It also does not investigate tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides, propose mechanistic scenarios over metal oxide catalysts, or explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxides for this reaction. 

The article focuses on supported Pt-Ga bimetallic catalysts coated with silica for propane dehydrogenation, rather than the mono-metallic or metal oxide catalysts asked about in the questions. It does not investigate varying metal particle size, shape, or support interactions of mono-metallic catalysts either. No specific mechanistic pathways are proposed over the studied Pt-Ga catalysts.

Therefore, I cannot provide any relevant quotes or substantive answers for the given questions based on the content of this literature. The questions seem mismatched and unrelated to the focus of this particular article. Please let me know if you would like me to attempt answering questions more relevant to the presented study on Pt-Ga bimetallic catalysts instead.
