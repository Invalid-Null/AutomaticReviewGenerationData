<quotes>
[1] "All the supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method."
[2] "Appropriate amounts of Pt were used to give nominal loadings of 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 wt %, which were denoted as 0.05% Pt/Al2O3, 0.1% Pt/Al2O3, 0.3% Pt/Al2O3, 0.5% Pt/Al2O3, 1% Pt/Al2O3, 3% Pt/Al2O3, and 5% Pt/Al2O3."
[3] "Following an increase of the Pt loading, it was noticed that there was a slight decrease in the specific surface and pore volume, but the structural properties of the Al2O3 support materials were unchanged during the catalyst preparation process."

3. The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses an incipient-wetness impregnation method to prepare a series of Al2O3-supported Pt catalysts with Pt loadings from 0.05 wt% to 5 wt%, which resulted in different Pt particle sizes from atomically dispersed to nanoparticles. The support properties remained largely unchanged during preparation.

[1] "The Pt particle sizes determined by HAADF-STEM images (Figure 1) are also shown in Table 1." 
[2] "Figure 1 shows a great deal of the presence of brighter single Pt atoms on the Al2O3 support, some of which are loosely packed into disordered Pt aggregates."
[3] "The HRTEM image of 3% Pt/Al2O3 (Figure 1f) reveals many well-defined crystalline particles spread on the support, where continuous lattice fringes are observed."
