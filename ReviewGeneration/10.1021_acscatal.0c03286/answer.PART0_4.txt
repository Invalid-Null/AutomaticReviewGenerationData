[1] Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become an important alternative as a result of the ever-increasing demand for propylene hardly being met by traditional methods of propene production, e.g., steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. (14) 

[2] Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity. Nevertheless, its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. (5,6) 

[3] Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become an important alternative as a result of the ever-increasing demand for propylene hardly being met by traditional methods of propene production, e.g., steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. (14)

[4] To address the problem, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process, (7,8) but Zhu et al. (9) reported that alloying Pt with Sn significantly lowers the reaction rate of PDH. 

[5] Great efforts have been devoted to improving the activity and stability of Pt catalysts, and it has been shown that the Pt particle size is proposed to have a significant impact on catalytic performance. (1418) Propane dehydrogenation is a fully known structure-sensitive reaction. 

[6] In recent years, with the fabrication of single-atom catalysts, establishing a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, in-depth research of catalysts has been performed at a smaller size scale. (2227) Numerous studies suggest that single-atom catalysts could not only minimize noble metal usage but could also frequently exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties in a broad area of chemical reactions, such as CO oxidation, (28,29) selective hydrogenation, (28,30) watergas shift reaction, (31,32) methanol steam reforming, (33) electrochemical reactions, (34,35) and so on.

<English version answer>
Answer: 1. According to the literature, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important alternative route for propylene production due to increasing demand, as traditional methods like steam cracking cannot meet demand fully. Details on applications of propylene are not provided. 

2. The article explains that catalysts like Pt lower activation energy barriers in PDH to facilitate the reaction. Specific mechanisms are not described.

3. The article mentions that noble metals, metal oxides, supported metals, alloys and zeolites have been explored as PDH catalysts. Pt is provided as a specific example.

4. Thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors in PDH are not discussed quantitatively. 

5. The article does not describe computational studies or DFT calculations on PDH mechanisms and pathways.

6. The article does not present microkinetic modeling of PDH kinetics.

7. No computational or experimental work identifying catalyst descriptors correlated to PDH performance is described.
