<quotes>
[1] "When Pt particle size is reduced to subnanometer-sized clusters (<1 nm), in particular, when Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, the highly dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a superior catalytic performance while still retaining a high propylene selectivity and stability; this is a distinguishing feature that differs from the traditional nanocatalyst."

[2] "Meanwhile, the absence of multiple Pt-Pt sites resulted in effectively inhibiting C-C cracking that requires the combination of multiple Pt atoms, which improved the propylene selectivity and anticoking ability."

[3] "Additionally, the supported atomically dispersed Pt catalyst is a novel catalyst with a precious high atom efficiency and excellent catalytic dehydrogenation ability, selectivity, and stability."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explores metal-support interfacial effects in Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It finds that when Pt achieves atomic dispersion on the Al2O3 support, the lack of Pt-Pt ensemble sites leads to much higher propylene selectivity and stability compared to Pt nanoparticles, by suppressing secondary cracking reactions. The single atom Pt sites interact strongly with the Al2O3 support to modulate selectivity.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:该文探讨了Pt/Al2O3催化剂中金属与支撑物的界面效应。它发现当Pt在Al2O3支撑物上达到原子分散状态时,由于缺乏Pt-Pt配位位,与Pt纳米粒子相比,丙烯选择性和稳定性大大提高,这是通过抑制次生裂解反应实现的。单原子Pt位点与Al2O3支撑物存在强相互作用,调节选择性。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "Herein, we report complete size dependence of Pt catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability due to coke formation." 

[2] "The turnover frequency (TOF) of the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than the subnanometer-sized clusters and the nanoparticles, respectively."

[3] "In the third region, where Pt existed as nanoparticles, the activity (TOF) decreased with increasing the particle size, while the propene selectivity and stability increased with increasing the Pt particle size, which is in agreement with the reported nanoparticle size dependence of the catalytic performance."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It studies the effects of Pt particle size from single atoms to clusters to nanoparticles on activity, selectivity and stability. Smaller Pt nanoparticles have higher activity but lower selectivity, while single Pt atoms show much higher TOF and propylene selectivity compared to larger nanoparticles and clusters. 
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:该文评价了单金属Pt支撑催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它研究了从单原子到簇到纳米粒子的Pt粒子大小对活性、选择性和稳定性的影响。较小的Pt纳米粒子具有更高的活性但更低的选择性,而单原子Pt相比更大的纳米粒子和簇显示出更高的TOF和丙烯选择性。

[1] "The performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts toward propane dehydrogenation with different Pt sizes was investigated (Figure 2a,b), and the relationship between particle size and catalytic performance is plotted in Figure 2c."

[2] "In the present study, the hierarchically structured nanoalumina was chosen as a Pt catalyst support to investigate the Pt particle size effect."

[3] "All the supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method." 

[4] "The Pt dispersions determined by CO chemisorption are on the decline along with the Pt loading increasing. Pt/Al2O3 (0.05%) and Pt/Al2O3 (0.1%) exhibit superb 98 and 97% dispersion, respectively, indicating that Pt particles on support are highly dispersed."

[5] "Figure 1 shows a great deal of the presence of brighter single Pt atoms on the Al2O3 support, some of which are loosely packed into disordered Pt aggregates."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
5. Answer: The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts on Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It investigates the performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with different Pt particle sizes from atomically dispersed to nanoparticles. The catalysts were prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation with loadings from 0.05% to 5%. Characterizations confirmed the presence of single Pt atoms and small clusters at low loadings and larger nanoparticles at higher loadings.

[1] "It investigates the performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with different Pt particle sizes from atomically dispersed to nanoparticles." 

[2] "In the first region, the atomically dispersed 0.05% Pt/Al2O3 and 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalysts have the highest activity, propene selectivity, and stability for propane conversion, where TOF reaches 4.65 and 4.25 s-1, respectively."

[3] "In the second region, with a relatively low loading and where Pt existed as small clusters from 0.8 to 2 nm, the activity, propene selectivity, and stability decreased with increasing the cluster size." 

[4] "In the third region, where Pt existed as nanoparticles, the activity (TOF) decreased with increasing the particle size, while the propene selectivity and stability increased with increasing the Pt particle size, which is in agreement with the reported nanoparticle size dependence of the catalytic performance."

[5] "The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (3%) with the 2 nm size exhibits the lowest propylene selectivity (53%), and the main byproducts are CC bond cracking products, i.e., methane, ethylene, and ethane."

</quotes>

<English version answer>  
6. Answer: The article investigates how properties like Pt particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance. It shows atomically dispersed Pt has the highest activity with TOF of 4.25-4.65 s^-1 and selectivity of 92%. With increasing cluster size from 0.8-2 nm, activity and selectivity decrease. For nanoparticles, activity decreases but selectivity increases with particle size up to 2 nm. The 2 nm particles give the lowest 53% selectivity due to cracking.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
6. 答案:文章研究了Pt颗粒大小、形状和支持体相互作用等性质如何影响性能。它显示原子分散的Pt具有最高的活性,TOF为4.25-4.65 s^-1,选择性为92%。随着0.8-2 nm的簇大小的增加,活性和选择性降低。对于纳米粒子,活性降低,但选择性随着高达2 nm的粒子大小的增加而增加。2 nm的粒子因裂解作用导致选择性降低到最低的53%。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "Propane dehydrogenation is a fully known structure-sensitive reaction."

[2] "For the Pt nanocatalyst, smaller Pt nanoparticles dominated by Pt(211) faces have a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier and are thus more reactive for propane conversion, while large Pt nanoparticles dominated by Pt(111) faces have a higher dehydrogenation energy barrier and a weakened binding strength of propylene, which results in the low dehydrogenation activity and the high propylene selectivity."

[3] "The superior catalytic activity of the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 is attributable to the exposure of increased effective active sites, positively charged Ptδ+ centers. These sites could enhance propane adsorption and facilitate the CH bond activation compared to small clusters and nanoparticles."  

[4] "Instead of over-dehydrogenating, the propylene adsorbed on the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst preferred to desorb."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
7. Answer: The article proposes that propane dehydrogenation is structure-sensitive. For nanoparticles, smaller ones with Pt(211) faces have lower energy barriers and are more active but less selective. Larger nanoparticles with Pt(111) have higher energy barriers, lower activity but better selectivity. Atomically dispersed Pt is highly active due to positively charged Pt sites that enhance propane adsorption and activation. It is also selective because propylene prefers to desorb rather than over-dehydrogenate.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
7. 答案:文章提出丙烷脱氢是结构敏感的。对于纳米颗粒,较小的那些具有Pt(211)面具有更低的能垒,活性更高但选择性较差。较大的纳米颗粒具有Pt(111),具有更高的能垒,活性较低但选择性较好。原子分散的Pt由于带正电荷的Pt位点增强丙烷吸附和活化而具有很高的活性。它也具有选择性,因为丙烯更倾向于解吸而不是过度脱氢。
