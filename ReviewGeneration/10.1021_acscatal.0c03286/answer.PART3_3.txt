<quotes>
[1] "All the supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method."

[2] "Appropriate amounts of Pt were used to give nominal loadings of 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 wt %, which were denoted as 0.05% Pt/Al2O3, 0.1% Pt/Al2O3, 0.3% Pt/Al2O3, 0.5% Pt/Al2O3, 1% Pt/Al2O3, 3% Pt/Al2O3, and 5% Pt/Al2O3."

[3] "The Pt particle sizes determined by HAADF-STEM images are also shown in Table 1. No obvious changes in the Pt particle size were found after the PDH reaction, which means no sintering happened on these Pt catalysts under the reaction conditions, and there is good interaction between the Al2O3 support and the Pt particles."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It prepares supported Pt catalysts with different Pt loadings from 0.05 wt% to 5 wt% using incipient-wetness impregnation, and characterizes the Pt particle size distribution using HAADF-STEM. It shows no obvious sintering occurs during the reaction due to good metal-support interaction.

[1] "The aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was performed on JEOL JEM-ARM200F at 200 kV to obtain atomic resolution imaging." 

[2] "The Pt particle sizes determined by HAADF-STEM images are also shown in Table 1."

[3] "Figure 1 shows a great deal of the presence of brighter single Pt atoms on the Al2O3 support, some of which are loosely packed into disordered Pt aggregates."

[4] "The HRTEM image of 3% Pt/Al2O3 (Figure 1f) reveals many well-defined crystalline particles spread on the support, where continuous lattice fringes are observed."

5. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM to image single Pt atoms and small clusters on the Al2O3 support. It also uses HRTEM to reveal lattice fringes of Pt nanoparticles on the support.
