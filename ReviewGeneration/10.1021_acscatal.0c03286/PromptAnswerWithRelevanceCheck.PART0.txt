<quotes>

[1] Great efforts have been devoted to improving the activity and stability of Pt catalysts, and it has been shown that the Pt particle size is proposed to have a significant impact on catalytic performance.

[2] Propane dehydrogenation is a fully known structure-sensitive reaction.

[3] Smaller Pt nanoparticles dominated by Pt(211) faces reveal a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier and thus are more reactive for propane conversion, while large Pt nanoparticles dominated by Pt(111) faces have a higher dehydrogenation energy barrier and a weakened binding strength of propylene.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing active sites that lower the activation energy barriers. Specifically, it states that Pt particle size significantly impacts catalytic performance, as propane dehydrogenation is a structure-sensitive reaction. Smaller Pt nanoparticles have lower dehydrogenation energy barriers and are more reactive, while larger nanoparticles have higher barriers but weaker propylene binding.

</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>

2. 该文阐述催化剂通过提供活性位点来降低激活能垒,以促进丙烷脱氢反应。具体来说,Pt颗粒大小会显著影响催化性能,因为丙烷脱氢是一种结构敏感反应。较小的Pt纳米粒子具有更低的脱氢能垒,因此更具反应活性,而较大的纳米粒子具有更高的能垒但丙烯的结合力较弱。

 <quotes>
[1] Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become an important alternative as a result of the ever-increasing demand for propylene hardly being met by traditional methods of propene production, e.g., steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. (14) 

[2] Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity. Nevertheless, its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. (5,6) 

[3] Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become an important alternative as a result of the ever-increasing demand for propylene hardly being met by traditional methods of propene production, e.g., steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. (14)

[4] To address the problem, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process, (7,8) but Zhu et al. (9) reported that alloying Pt with Sn significantly lowers the reaction rate of PDH. 

[5] Great efforts have been devoted to improving the activity and stability of Pt catalysts, and it has been shown that the Pt particle size is proposed to have a significant impact on catalytic performance. (1418) Propane dehydrogenation is a fully known structure-sensitive reaction. 

[6] In recent years, with the fabrication of single-atom catalysts, establishing a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, in-depth research of catalysts has been performed at a smaller size scale. (2227) Numerous studies suggest that single-atom catalysts could not only minimize noble metal usage but could also frequently exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties in a broad area of chemical reactions, such as CO oxidation, (28,29) selective hydrogenation, (28,30) watergas shift reaction, (31,32) methanol steam reforming, (33) electrochemical reactions, (34,35) and so on.
