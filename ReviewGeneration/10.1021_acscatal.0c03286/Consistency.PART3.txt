 Based on the provided text and answer files, I have compiled the following comparative analysis:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%", 
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", 
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"
  },

    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "3": {
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",

  },
  "8": {
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%", 
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"
  }
}
```

I carefully compared each answer file's responses to the correct answers provided in Answer.txt for each question. I calculated a consistency percentage for how consistent each file's answer is with the correct answer. answer.PART3_0.txt did not contain any relevant information so its consistency is 0% for each question. The other files had complete consistency with the correct answers, so they each have 100% consistency for every question. Let me know if you need me to clarify or expand on anything in this analysis!
