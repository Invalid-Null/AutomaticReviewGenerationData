<quotes>
[1] "All the supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method." 

[2] "Appropriate amounts of Pt were used to give nominal loadings of 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 wt %, which were denoted as 0.05% Pt/Al2O3, 0.1% Pt/Al2O3, 0.3% Pt/Al2O3, 0.5% Pt/Al2O3, 1% Pt/Al2O3, 3% Pt/Al2O3, and 5% Pt/Al2O3."

[3] "To increase the particle size and practically ensure no single atoms, the samples with 5 wt % Pt loading were calcined at 600 and at 700 C for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 C/min in air, respectively, which were denoted as 5% Pt/Al2O3-600 and 5% Pt/Al2O3-700."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses an incipient-wetness impregnation method with different Pt loadings from 0.05 wt% to 5 wt% to control the Pt particle size from atomically dispersed to nanoparticles. It also calcines some samples at higher temperatures to increase the Pt particle size.

[1] "The Pt particle sizes determined by HAADF-STEM images (Figure 1) are also shown in Table 1."

[2] "Figure 1 shows a great deal of the presence of brighter single Pt atoms on the Al2O3 support, some of which are loosely packed into disordered Pt aggregates." 

[3] "These results clearly indicate that weakened propylene adsorption on the atomically dispersed 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst facilitates desorption rather than deep dehydrogenation, thus leading to higher levels of selectivity compared to the 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 sub-nanocatalyst and the 3% Pt/Al2O3 nanocatalyst."

5. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like HAADF-STEM to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses HAADF-STEM to determine Pt particle sizes and shows images of single Pt atoms on the alumina support. The microscopy data provides insights into how atomically dispersed Pt leads to higher selectivity.
