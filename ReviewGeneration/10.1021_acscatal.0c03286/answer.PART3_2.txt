[1] "All the supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method. Typically, an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., 99.5%) was added dropwise onto 1.00 g of support under manual stirring."

[2] "For the Al2O3 support, appropriate amounts of Pt were used to give nominal loadings of 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 wt %, which were denoted as 0.05% Pt/Al2O3, 0.1% Pt/Al2O3, 0.3% Pt/Al2O3, 0.5% Pt/Al2O3, 1% Pt/Al2O3, 3% Pt/Al2O3, and 5% Pt/Al2O3."

[3] "To increase the particle size and practically ensure no single atoms, the samples with 5 wt % Pt loading were calcined at 600 and at 700 C for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 C/min in air, respectively, which were denoted as 5% Pt/Al2O3-600 and 5% Pt/Al2O3-700."

24. The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses incipient-wetness impregnation with varying Pt loadings from 0.05 wt% to 5 wt% to control the Pt particle size from atomically dispersed to nanoparticles. It also calcines some 5 wt% Pt catalysts at higher temperatures to increase the Pt particle size.

[1] "The aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was performed on JEOL JEM-ARM200F at 200 kV to obtain atomic resolution imaging." 

[2] "Figure 1 shows the typical HAADF-STEM images and particle size distributions of (a) 0.1% Pt/Al2O3, (c) 0.3% Pt/Al2O3, and (e) 3% Pt/Al2O3 fresh catalysts at a low magnification, and (b) 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 and (d) 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 catalysts at a high magnification."

[3] "The HRTEM image of 3% Pt/Al2O3 (Figure 1f) reveals many well-defined crystalline particles spread on the support, where continuous lattice fringes are observed."

26. The article employs aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM and HRTEM microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides atomic resolution images showing isolated Pt atoms, sub-nanometer clusters, and nanoparticles on the alumina support. HRTEM reveals lattice fringes and crystallinity of the Pt nanoparticles.
