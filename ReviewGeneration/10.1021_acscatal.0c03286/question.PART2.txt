Size Dependence of Pt Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation: from Atomically Dispersed to Nanoparticles
Abstract
The structureperformance relationship is a critical fundamental issue in heterogeneous catalysis, and the size-dependent structure sensitivity of catalytic reactions has long been researched in catalysis. Yet it remains elusive for most of the reactions in a full-size range, from a single atom and subnanometer clusters to nanoparticles. Herein, we report complete size dependence of Pt catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability due to coke formation. The turnover frequency (TOF) of the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than the subnanometer-sized clusters and the nanoparticles, respectively. A canyon- shaped size dependence of the propene selectivity was observed with a bottom at about 2 nm of Pt particle size. The subnanometer-sized clusters have opposite size dependence of the propene selectivity compared to nanoparticles. Both atomically dispersed Pt and large Pt nanoparticles possess high propene selectivity. The atomically dispersed platinum centers with a positive charge dramatically enhanced the activity, weakened propylene adsorption, and prevented its deep dehydrogenation. Besides, the absence of multiple PtPt sites effectively inhibited undesired side reactions (e.g., CC cracking), thus improved propylene selectivity and stability. This work demonstrates the promising application of a supported atomically dispersed Pt catalyst for highly selective dehydrogenation of propane.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become an important alternative as a result of the ever-increasing demand for propylene hardly being met by traditional methods of propene production, e.g., steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. (14) Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity. Nevertheless, its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory. (5,6) To address the problem, Sn is typically added as a promoter for a monometallic Pt catalyst to enhance propylene selectivity in the industry process, (7,8) but Zhu et al. (9) reported that alloying Pt with Sn significantly lowers the reaction rate of PDH. Besides, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue. (1013) Therefore, the critical requirements in PDH are (1) to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs; (2) to maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity; and (3) to increase anticoking ability.
Great efforts have been devoted to improving the activity and stability of Pt catalysts, and it has been shown that the Pt particle size is proposed to have a significant impact on catalytic performance. (1418) Propane dehydrogenation is a fully known structure-sensitive reaction. Zhu et al. (19) showed that the catalytic activity on Pt nanoparticles increases when decreasing the particle size in the range of 19 nm, while the propylene selectivity behaves in an opposite manner. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, smaller Pt nanoparticles dominated by Pt(211) faces reveal a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier and thus are more reactive for propane conversion, but large Pt nanoparticles dominated by Pt(111) faces exhibit a higher energy barrier for CH bond activation and a weaker binding strength of propylene. (20,21)
In recent years, with the fabrication of single-atom catalysts, establishing a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, in-depth research of catalysts has been performed at a smaller size scale. (2227) Numerous studies suggest that single-atom catalysts could not only minimize noble metal usage but could also frequently exhibit more outstanding catalytic properties in a broad area of chemical reactions, such as CO oxidation, (28,29) selective hydrogenation, (28,30) watergas shift reaction, (31,32) methanol steam reforming, (33) electrochemical reactions, (34,35) and so on. Single-atom catalysts are providing new approaches for designing desired propane dehydrogenation catalysts with both high activity and selectivity. Gong et al. (36) synthesized γ-Al2O3-supported Pt/Cu single-atom catalysts for PDH through a copper atom dilution method. Pt single atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, displaying propylene selectivity of 90%, but there is a slight loss of intrinsic dehydrogenation activity. Furukawa et al. (37) reported a PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst as a stable and selective catalyst for PDH, in which threefold hollow Pt3 ensembles are selectively blocked and disabled by Pb deposition, while single-atom Pt1 sites are isolated by catalytically inert Ga at the surface. The Pt3 site is considered more active for further CH(C) scissions, so Pt3 sites should be disabled, while Pt1 sites available for the reaction are needed to achieve higher selectivity and stability. Zhao et al. (38) adopted different doped graphene strategies to tune the electronic structure of a supported Pt atom in a wide range. The single Pt atom with the most positive charges is predicted to be the most active and less prone to deep dehydrogenation using first-principles calculations. A wide range of research has proved that when the size of a metal particle reduces to subnanometer or atomically dispersed, it typically manifests the unique catalytic properties differing from the conventional nanocatalysts, owing to the exclusive structural and electronic attribution. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically study the size effects on the catalytic performance from single atoms to subnanometer clusters and then to nanoparticles to gain a better understanding of the structureperformance relationship and thus design better industrial catalysts.
Herein, a series of Al2O3-supported Pt single atoms, small clusters, and nanoparticle catalysts were prepared via a simple impregnation method in which the Pt particle size could be controlled by changing the Pt loading. The properties of Pt species at different scales were characterized in detail by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), CO chemisorption (CO-Chem), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of CO adsorption. The size effects of Pt particles on catalytic performance were explored. Combining kinetic analysis and DRIFTS of C3H6 chemisorption gave the relative adsorption strength of surface species on multimetric Pt species, which relates to reactivity and selectivity. Moreover, the size effects on coke properties have been completely studied for the first time. The comprehensive information of coke formed on multimetric Pt catalysts was qualitatively and quantitatively determined by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS), and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis using different carrier gases. A combined catalyst characterization and kinetic studies reveal the underlying nature of the structureperformance relationship. The Al2O3-supported atomically dispersed Pt catalyst is a novel catalyst with a precious high atom efficiency and excellent catalytic dehydrogenation ability, selectivity, and stability.

Catalyst Preparation
In the present study, the hierarchically structured nanoalumina was chosen as a Pt catalyst support to investigate the Pt particle size effect. Compared with commercial alumina, the hierarchical nanoalumina benefited from its highly open structure, and the stable surface property showed a remarkable ability to improve the mass-transfer, diffusion kinetics, and catalysts structural stability. (39) The Al2O3 support material was synthesized by a hydrothermal method described earlier. (40) Al(NO3)3·9H2O (8.4 g) (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., 99.5%) and 6 g of urea (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., 99.5%) were dissolved in 50 mL of a waterethanol mixture followed by the addition of an appropriate amount of nitric acid with vigorous stirring at room temperature. The mixed solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated at 180 C for 12 h under autogenous pressure. The precipitate was dried at 80 C for 12 h after washing and filtering, and finally calcined in air at 900 C for 3 h with a heating rate of 10 C/min.
All the supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method. Typically, an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., 99.5%) was added dropwise onto 1.00 g of support under manual stirring. After the impregnation, the samples were dried at 110 C for 12 h and then calcined at 500 C for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 C/min in air, as unreduced catalyst precursors. For the Al2O3 support, appropriate amounts of Pt were used to give nominal loadings of 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 wt %, which were denoted as 0.05% Pt/Al2O3, 0.1% Pt/Al2O3, 0.3% Pt/Al2O3, 0.5% Pt/Al2O3, 1% Pt/Al2O3, 3% Pt/Al2O3, and 5% Pt/Al2O3. To increase the particle size and practically ensure no single atoms, the samples with 5 wt % Pt loading were calcined at 600 and at 700 C for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 C/min in air, respectively, which were denoted as 5% Pt/Al2O3-600 and 5% Pt/Al2O3-700.
Catalyst Characterization
N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument at 196 C, with all samples degassed in vacuum for 4 h at 240 C. The samples surface areas were analyzed by the multipoint BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) analysis method in the P/P0 = 0.050.30 pressure range. An inductively coupled plasma atomic-emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, Agilent Varian 710-ES) was used to analyze the Pt contents. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα (hν = 1486.71 eV) radiation source. The binding energy was calibrated using the C 1s peak (284.6 eV) of surface adventitious carbon. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected with a JEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was performed on JEOL JEM-ARM200F at 200 kV to obtain atomic resolution imaging. The surface-averaged Pt cluster diameters (dTEM) were determined on the basis of more than 150 particles in different regions of TEM images. The thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed on a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 TGA instrument to determine the amount of coke in oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres. The sample was dried at 120 C for 2 h, and then the temperature was increased to 800 C at a heating rate of 10 C/min. The chemical composition of coke was analyzed by pyrolysis GCMS (Agilent 7890A GC/5975C MSD) equipped with an HP-5MS column, as reported in our previous work. (10)
CO chemisorption (CO-Chem) and H2 temperature-programmed desorption (H2-TPD) were carried out using an Autochem-II 2920 analyzer (Micromeretics) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For CO-Chem, approximately 0.20 g of the catalyst was loaded into a U-shaped quartz tube and heated to 550 C for 100 min under pure H2 (20 mL/min) and then cooled to 45 C in pure Ar (20 mL/min), and then CO pulses (10% CO/Ar) were injected to begin testing. The dispersion of platinum was estimated by CO chemisorption amount, assuming the adsorption stoichiometry of CO/Pt = 1. For H2-TPD, approximately 0.2 g of the catalyst was reduced in the same way as CO chemisorption. The catalyst was kept under flowing pure H2 for 1 h. After saturation, a flow of He was used to remove the weakly adsorbed H2 on the catalysts, and then the TPD process was carried out from 45 to 600 C at a ramp rate of 10 C/min.
In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectra of CO (CO-DRIFTS) and C3H6 (C3H6-DRIFTS) adsorbed on catalysts were acquired with a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector at a spectral resolution of 4 cm1 and the scanned wavenumber was ranged from 4000 to 400 cm1. In a typical CO-DRIFTS procedure, about 50 mg of the sample was reduced at 550 C in pure H2 (20 mL/min) for 100 min and then cooled to 30 C under pure Ar (20 mL/min) for collecting a background spectrum. Afterward, 2% v/v CO/Ar (20 mL/min) was introduced for 30 min to ensure steady-state conditions. An Ar (20 mL/min) purge was performed to remove gas-phase CO from the DRIFTS cell and then spectra of chemisorbed CO were recorded continuously during the process. For C3H6-DRIFTS, the sample was reduced in the same manner as that for CO adsorption. The sample was exposed to pure C3H6 (20 mL/min) at 30 C for 30 min and subsequently purged with Ar (20 mL/min) for 30 min, and then the spectra were collected for analysis. Afterward, the sample was elevated to 100, 200, and 300 C in Ar (20 mL/min), respectively. The previous step was repeated to obtain spectra under different temperatures.
Catalytic Evaluation
The propane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out on a BenchCAT reactor (Altamira Instrument) under 1 bar. Typically, 0.10 g of the catalyst was loaded in the center of a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 6 mm, and reduced at 500 C in flowing pure H2 (20 mL/min) for 100 min with a heating rate of 10 C/min. After that, syngas (H2/C3H8 = 0.8 v/v, Argon balance, 78 mL/min) was introduced to the reactor, which gives a WHSVpropane = 18.9 h1, and the catalyst was tested at 575 C for 4 h. The analyses of reactant and product components were performed with an online gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD detector (INFICON 3000). The conversion of propane and selectivity toward propylene were calculated as
where FC3H8,in is the flow rate of propane in the feed; FC3H8,out, FC3H6,out, and Fi,out are the flow rates of propane, propylene, and component i in the outlet; and ni is the carbon number of component i.
The diffusion-free operation was examined experimentally by varying space velocities and catalyst particle sizes. Results showed that the external and internal diffusion effects were safely excluded under the reaction conditions adopted here. The turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated as
where Fin is the molar flow rate of propane in the feed (mol/s); Fout is the molar flow rate of propane in the outlet (mol/s); M is the molar mass of Pt (g/mol); m is the amount of the catalyst (g); L is the loading amount of Pt (%); and D is the dispersion of Pt (%), estimated by CO chemisorption. The initial values of the reactions were used.

Morphology and Structure of Supported Catalysts
Table 1 shows the detailed properties of the alumina-supported Pt catalysts. The final loadings of Pt analyzed by ICP-AES are close to the nominal values. The surface areas and pore volumes of catalysts with different loadings are 60.368.7 m2/g and 0.310.36 cm3/g, respectively. Following the improvement of Pt loading, it was noticed that there was a slight decrease in the specific surface and pore volume, but the structural properties of the Al2O3 support materials were unchanged during the catalyst preparation process. The Pt dispersions determined by CO chemisorption are on the decline along with the Pt loading increasing. Pt/Al2O3 (0.05%) and Pt/Al2O3 (0.1%) exhibit superb 98 and 97% dispersion, respectively, indicating that Pt particles on support are highly dispersed.

fSamples were heat treated.
The Pt particle sizes determined by HAADF-STEM images (Figure 1) are also shown in Table 1. No obvious changes in the Pt particle size (Table 1) were found after the PDH reaction, which means no sintering happened on these Pt catalysts under the reaction conditions, and there is good interaction between the Al2O3 support and the Pt particles. As shown in Figure 1a, with a small amount of Pt as low as 0.1%, it is difficult to obtain the images of the Pt particle on support at a low magnification. However, as the magnification increases, Figure 1b shows a great deal of the presence of brighter single Pt atoms on the Al2O3 support, some of which are loosely packed into disordered Pt aggregates. Remarkably, Pt particles on 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 are not all completely isolated, but the Pt aggregates appear to be amorphous instead of crystallites with clear edges, which show atomic-level dispersion. Following an increase of the Pt loading to 0.3 wt %, even at a low magnification, a considerable number of Pt particles can be observed, and the average diameters are 0.8 nm, as shown in Figure 1c. After the magnification (Figure 1d), the 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits intermediate features. These contain many small clusters (1 nm) with ordered Pt atoms, accompanied by sporadic single Pt atoms. (34,41) The HRTEM image of 3% Pt/Al2O3 (Figure 1f) reveals many well-defined crystalline particles spread on the support, where continuous lattice fringes are observed. Combining the corresponding Fourier-transform (FFT) pattern, the lattice spacings of nanoparticles in 3% Pt/Al2O3 are 0.224 and 0.198 nm. These values are very close to the d-spacing of Pt(111) and Pt(100) planes (JCPDS 04-0802), respectively. The sizes of 5% Pt/Al2O3-600 and 5% Pt/Al2O3-700 that were thermally treated increase to 6.9 and 12 nm, respectively. The dCO-Chem calculated on the basis of CO chemisorption is found to be consistent with the size measured by HAADF-STEM. According to these results, the multiscale Pt/Al2O3 catalysts (from atomically dispersed to small clusters and nanoparticles) were successfully prepared using the impregnation method.

Single Pt atoms are marked by yellow circles.
Size Effects on Catalytic Performance
The performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts toward propane dehydrogenation with different Pt sizes was investigated (Figure 2a,b), and the relationship between particle size and catalytic performance is plotted in Figure 2c. The size dependence of catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability can be categorized into three regions. In the first region, the atomically dispersed 0.05% Pt/Al2O3 and 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalysts have the highest activity, propene selectivity, and stability for propane conversion, where TOF reaches 4.65 and 4.25 s1, respectively. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity is higher than 92%, which is very high for a Pt monometallic catalyst with high activity in PDH. As shown in Figure 2d, the performance of 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 is greater than that of the majority of the supported Pt-based catalysts reported recently. (18,19,4157) In the second region, with a relatively low loading and where Pt existed as small clusters from 0.8 to 2 nm, the activity, propene selectivity, and stability decreased with increasing the cluster size. As the Pt loading increased from 0.1 to 0.3% and the Pt size increased from the atomically dispersed to 0.8 nm small clusters, the catalytic performance changed dramatically. The TOF decreased almost three times (from 4.25 to 1.48 s1), and the propene selectivity also decreased from 92% to 85%. In the third region, where Pt existed as nanoparticles, the activity (TOF) decreased with increasing the particle size, while the propene selectivity and stability increased with increasing the Pt particle size, which is in agreement with the reported nanoparticle size dependence of the catalytic performance. (19) For the Pt nanocatalyst, smaller Pt nanoparticles dominated by Pt(211) faces have a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier and are thus more reactive for propane conversion, while large Pt nanoparticles dominated by Pt(111) faces have a higher dehydrogenation energy barrier and a weakened binding strength of propylene, which results in the low dehydrogenation activity and the high propylene selectivity. (20,21) The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (3%) with the 2 nm size exhibits the lowest propylene selectivity (53%), and the main byproducts are CC bond cracking products, i.e., methane, ethylene, and ethane.

Reaction conditions: 0.1 g of the catalyst, P = 1 atm, T = 575 C, H2/C3H8=0.8 v/v, argon balance, Vtotal = 78 mL/min, and WHSVpropane = 18.9 h1. (c) Comparison of the initial TOFpropane and selectivities of catalysts of different Pt particle sizes (Pt loadings). The Pt particle size was measured by HAADF-STEM. The stability index (Φt) was defined as the ratio of the final conversion (Xt) to the initial conversion (X0). (d) Comparison of TOFpropane and selectivity of the 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and other reported Pt-based catalysts. The value is obtained at the start of the cycle. (e) Comparison of the propylene selectivities of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with different Pt loadings under similar propane conversion. (f) Comparison of the initial and final selectivities of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in different sizes (loadings).
To exclude the possible effect of conversion on selectivity, the propylene selectivity was rigorously compared at a similar conversion of propane in Figure 2e,f, which shows similar size dependence, as shown in Figure 2c. Additionally, the stability index is related to coke formation, and it follows a similar trend of the size dependence of the propene selectivity. As shown in Figure 2c, the conversion loss of the atomically dispersed Pt (0.05 and 0.1%) is minimum during the reaction, showing good stability. In conclusion, the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst has an outstanding catalytic activity while still retaining a high propylene selectivity and stability, and the TOF is approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than small clusters and nanoparticles, respectively.
Nature of the Size Dependence
The catalytic performance of a catalyst generally depends on the geometric and electronic structures of active sites. XPS characterization of the three typical Pt/Al2O3 catalysts at different scales was carried out to illustrate the electronic property modification by Pt particle size. The most intense photoemission line of Pt was from Pt 4f, but this energy region was overshadowed by the presence of a very strong Al 2p peak, and so Pt 4d was analyzed. (58,59) As shown in Figure 3, the peaks of the three catalysts could be resolved into three components with binding energies (B.E.) of 317.0317.5, 314.9315.3, and 312.2312.9 eV after curve-fitting procedures, assigned to the presence of Pt4+, Pt2+, and Pt0+ species, respectively. (60) The detailed curve-fitting parameters from XPS are shown in Table 2. Clearly, as the Pt loading decreases, a shift of the Pt 4d5/2 B.E. toward higher values occurred and the proportion of oxidized Ptδ+ species gradually increased. The results demonstrate a stronger interaction, which gradually grows with decreasing the Pt loading between Pt and supports. The Pt particles in 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 can transfer an additional charge to the support compared to 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 and 3% Pt/Al2O3; this implies that the atomically dispersed Pt atoms contain more positive charges than small clusters and nanoparticles.

The FTIR spectroscopy is a powerful site-specific characterization method that can be used to accurately identify Pt species in a catalyst sample. As shown in Figure 4, when Pt particle sizes decrease to subnanometer, two bands at 2087 and 2066 cm1 can be assigned to the linear-bonded CO on single Ptδ+ and Pt0 atoms, respectively, and no bridged adsorbed CO was observed. (28,31) For 0.1% Pt/Al2O3, the Pt species exists as privileged single Ptδ+ atoms, while the peak of the linear-bonded CO on Pt0 is more obvious for 0.3% Pt/Al2O3. For Al2O3-supported Pt nanoparticles, the CO adsorption bands at 1950 to 2100 cm1 are usually assigned to the linear-bonded CO on metallic nanoparticle surfaces at either well-coordinated (20802090 cm1) or under-coordinated (20302070 cm1) Pt sites. Meanwhile, the band at 1831 cm1 is observable on 3% Pt/Al2O3, which is assigned to the bridged CO species adsorbed on neighboring Pt atoms over the well-defined Pt crystallite. (61) These characterizations collectively provide compelling evidence that 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 and 3% Pt/Al2O3 are dominated by positively charged Ptδ+ atoms and well-defined Pt metallic crystallite, respectively, while 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 exhibits the intermediate features of a large number of small clusters and a small amount of single Pt atoms.

Furthermore, a kinetic study was performed to elucidate the size dependence of the kinetic behaviors and the Arrhenius plots for PDH on the atomically dispersed Pt (0.1% Pt/Al2O3), small clusters (0.3% Pt/Al2O3), and nanoparticles (3% Pt/Al2O3), and the results are shown in Figure 5. The activation energy (Ea) was calculated by the Arrhenius equation:
(1)
where A, R, and T are the pre-exponential factor, the universal gas constant, and the absolute temperature, respectively.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Apparent activation energy of propane dehydrogenation over multimetric Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The apparent activation energy was calculated under low propane conversion (<10%).
The activation energy for PDH over the 3% Pt/Al2O3 nanocatalyst is 56  6 kJ/mol and decreased to 41  5 kJ/mol on small clusters and 26  3 kJ/mol on atomically dispersed Pt. This result further confirms that the atomically dispersed Pt particles are more conducive to the improvement of the reaction rate.
The entropy of activation can effectively demonstrate the change between the transition state of propane activation and the gas-phase propane, where the entropy loss of the propane adsorption on the Pt surface due to the loss of freedom contributes mainly to the apparent entropy changes. Based on the transition-state theory, the reaction rate (k) can be expressed in the Eyring form: (9,62,63)
(2)
where kB, T, h, ΔS0*, R, and ΔH0* are the Boltzmann constant, absolute temperature, Planck constant, entropy of activation, the universal gas constant, and enthalpy of activation, respectively.
The activation energy could be related to ΔH0*:

where n is the molecularity of reaction (herein, n = 1).
Combining eqs 13 gives:
(4)
The pre-exponential factors were obtained from the Arrhenius plots, and then the apparent entropy changes were also estimated based on eq 4. As shown in Table 3, the larger entropy change of 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 indicates the stronger adsorption of the propane on 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 compared to 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 and 3% Pt/Al2O3. Therefore, reactant species might favor preferential adsorption on 0.1% Pt/Al2O3, which enhances overall reactivity.

Zhao et al. (38) reported that the Pt single atom having the most positive charges by transferring charge to support is the most active, as evidenced by comparing the first and second CH bond activation energies in PDH, and has a good selectivity due to the higher activation energy for deep dehydrogenation than that for desorption of propylene. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the superior catalytic activity of the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 is attributable to the exposure of increased effective active sites, positively charged Ptδ+ centers. These sites could enhance propane adsorption and facilitate the CH bond activation compared to small clusters and nanoparticles.
The relative adsorption strength of propylene on catalysts relates directly to the selectivity. The faster propylene desorption compared to the propylene dehydrogenation is preferred to get a high selectivity. (8,9) The size dependence of the propylene adsorption was characterized by the DRIFTS measurements and the results are given in Figure 6. The peaks at 1644 cm1 can be assigned to the characteristic band of CC stretching of propylene, and two peaks at 1570 and 1460 cm1 are ascribed to the skeleton vibrations of the aromatics ring. (64,65) At a temperature of 30 C, an absorption peak of the CC stretching band at 1644 cm1 is observed on all the three catalysts. For 0.1% Pt/Al2O3, this peak almost disappears immediately after raising the temperature, and no new peaks appear. However, for 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 and 3% Pt/Al2O3, this peak is initially weakened before it disappears entirely at 300 C, meanwhile, an absorption peak of the aromatics appears. This indicates that the adsorption strength of propylene on 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 is relatively weak, and absorbed propylene on 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 tends to desorb more readily rather than that on 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 and 3% Pt/Al2O3. In addition, a derivative-shaped peak around 2020 cm1 (caused by the surface PtH groups) is observed for 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 and 3% Pt/Al2O3 under higher temperatures. (66) The presence of PtH groups is associated with the deep dehydrogenation of propylene, and the relative intensity of the PtH band increases alongside increasing amounts of aromatic coke, suggesting that the formation of aromatic coke may be a direct result of deep dehydrogenation. (10) These results clearly indicate that weakened propylene adsorption on the atomically dispersed 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst facilitates desorption rather than deep dehydrogenation, thus leading to higher levels of selectivity compared to the 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 sub-nanocatalyst and the 3% Pt/Al2O3 nanocatalyst. This is also consistent with Furukawa et al.s work, which indicates that the single-atom-like Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and improves the selectivity and stability.

In addition, H2-TPD was also carried out and the results are shown in Figure 7. In general, a low-temperature desorption peak (100 C) is assigned to hydrogen on metallic Pt, whereas a high-temperature desorption peak (300450 C) corresponds to spillover hydrogen. (57) In comparison with the 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 and 3% Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, the low-temperature desorption peak on the 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst disappears and there only exists a high-temperature spillover hydrogen peak, suggesting that the metallic Pt is virtually nonexistent. Although the mechanism of the increase in hydrogen spillover with the decrease of Pt particle size is unclear, previous studies have shown that the high-temperature adsorbed hydrogen aids in maintaining the catalyst activity, most probably by reducing coking on the metal, and the surface sites where the spillover hydrogen and propane react cannot break CC bonds. (6770) Therefore, the enormous generation of spillover hydrogen on 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 could favor to reduce the coking on the surface and further increase the selectivity and stability of the catalyst.

Size Effects on Coke Properties and Catalyst Stability
The deactivation of Pt-based catalysts for PDH mainly originates from the formation of coke; an analysis procedure was performed to obtain comprehensive information about the size effects on coke properties. Figure 8 shows the typical TEM images of the spent Pt/Al2O3 catalysts on different scales. The Pt particle sizes of spent catalysts are presented in Table 1. There are no observable Pt nanoparticles on the spent 0.1% Pt/Al2O3, which verifies that the supported Pt still remains highly dispersed after the reaction. The crystal lattice of carbon can barely be observed on 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 and becomes obvious when the amount of coke deposits increases with the increase of Pt loading. For 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 and 3% Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, the coke sheets attached to the metal particles (label 1) can be easily detected. The spacing lattice value of coke was measured as approximately 3.53.7 Å, which is larger than that of graphite (i.e., 3.35 Å). Thus, this coke on the catalyst could be pregraphite carbon. (71) It is well known that these carbonaceous species, highly deficient in hydrogen are produced on the metal surface with multiple PtPt sites. (72) This is the possible reason why no such kind of coke is produced on the 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 sample. With more pregraphite carbon accumulated on the Pt surface, it can expand from the surface to the support (label 2). The transfer of coke from the Pt surface to the support is also reported in the literature and could be fastened when a mobile species, e.g., Sn, exists in the catalyst. (10)

3% Pt/Al2O3 5.9 4.2
aCondition: 575 C, reaction time 4 h.
bDetermined by TG in O2 and N2 atmospheres, respectively.
The amount of deposited coke was quantitatively determined by TG in oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres, respectively (as shown in Table 4). The discrepancy of weight loss between O2 and N2 is due to the nonvolatile pregraphite-like carbon, which can be easily gasified in O2 rather than in N2, as previously reported. (10)Figure 9 shows that the weight loss of the spent 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is the lowest (ca. 1.5 wt %) in the O2 atmosphere, and the difference of weight loss between O2 and N2 is negligible. Increasing the Pt loading contributes to a higher amount of coke deposits and nonvolatile pregraphite-like carbon, this result also confirms with the results of TEM.

Pyrolysis GCMS analysis was further carried out to identify the composition of coke (Figure 10). When compared with 0.3% Pt/Al2O3 and 3% Pt/Al2O3, the retention time of main peaks in 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 significantly prolonged, indicating the production of the longer-chain volatile aliphatic coke (C16C26) due to the lack of multiple PtPt sites. (10)

The multiple PtPt sites existing in Pt-based catalysts are known to be active for deep dehydrogenation of propylene, cracking, and the subsequent secondary reaction of the coke (e.g., isomerization, cyclization, etc.). (1,73,74) The selectivity and stability of the catalyst depend on whether the product propylene directly desorbs or undergoes these undesired side reactions. When Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, the multiple PtPt sites basically disappear, and the relatively separate Pt atoms can effectively inhibit these undesired side reactions. (7577) Therefore, the propene selectivity increases, and the coking rate decreases.
Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The activity, selectivity, and stability were found to depend significantly on the Pt size. The dependence can be divided into three groups: the atomically dispersed, small clusters, and nanoparticles. The result indicates that when Pt particle size is reduced to subnanometer-sized clusters (<1 nm), in particular, when Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, the highly dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a superior catalytic performance while still retaining a high propylene selectivity and stability; this is a distinguishing feature that differs from the traditional nanocatalyst. The superior performance could be attributed to positively charged platinum centers that favor the preferential adsorption of propane. Meanwhile, instead of over-dehydrogenating, the propylene adsorbed on the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst preferred to desorb. Resultantly, the selectivity of propylene improved. Additionally, the absence of multiple PtPt sites resulted in effectively inhibiting CC cracking that requires the combination of multiple Pt atoms, which improved the propylene selectivity and anticoking ability. In conclusion, the current work has systematically expatiated the size dependence of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation: from atomically dispersed to subnanometer clusters and then to nanoparticles. The result indicates that the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is a novel and much more effective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation with minimal use of noble metal, which possesses enormous potential for industrial applications.
