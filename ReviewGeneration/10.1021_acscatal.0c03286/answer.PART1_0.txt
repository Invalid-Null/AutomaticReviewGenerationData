[1] "When Pt particle size is reduced to subnanometer-sized clusters (<1 nm), in particular, when Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, the highly dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a superior catalytic performance while still retaining a high propylene selectivity and stability; this is a distinguishing feature that differs from the traditional nanocatalyst."

[2] "Meanwhile, the absence of multiple Pt-Pt sites resulted in effectively inhibiting C-C cracking that requires the combination of multiple Pt atoms, which improved the propylene selectivity and anticoking ability."

[3] "Additionally, the supported atomically dispersed Pt catalyst is a novel catalyst with a precious high atom efficiency and excellent catalytic dehydrogenation ability, selectivity, and stability."

Answer: The article explores metal-support interfacial effects in Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It finds that when Pt achieves atomic dispersion on the Al2O3 support, the lack of Pt-Pt ensemble sites leads to much higher propylene selectivity and stability compared to Pt nanoparticles, by suppressing secondary cracking reactions. The single atom Pt sites interact strongly with the Al2O3 support to modulate selectivity.

答:该文探讨了Pt/Al2O3催化剂中金属与支撑物的界面效应。它发现当Pt在Al2O3支撑物上达到原子分散状态时,由于缺乏Pt-Pt配位位,与Pt纳米粒子相比,丙烯选择性和稳定性大大提高,这是通过抑制次生裂解反应实现的。单原子Pt位点与Al2O3支撑物存在强相互作用,调节选择性。

[1] "Herein, we report complete size dependence of Pt catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability due to coke formation." 

[2] "The turnover frequency (TOF) of the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than the subnanometer-sized clusters and the nanoparticles, respectively."

[3] "In the third region, where Pt existed as nanoparticles, the activity (TOF) decreased with increasing the particle size, while the propene selectivity and stability increased with increasing the Pt particle size, which is in agreement with the reported nanoparticle size dependence of the catalytic performance."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It studies the effects of Pt particle size from single atoms to clusters to nanoparticles on activity, selectivity and stability. Smaller Pt nanoparticles have higher activity but lower selectivity, while single Pt atoms show much higher TOF and propylene selectivity compared to larger nanoparticles and clusters.

答:该文评价了单金属Pt支撑催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它研究了从单原子到簇到纳米粒子的Pt粒子大小对活性、选择性和稳定性的影响。较小的Pt纳米粒子具有更高的活性但更低的选择性,而单原子Pt相比更大的纳米粒子和簇显示出更高的TOF和丙烯选择性。
