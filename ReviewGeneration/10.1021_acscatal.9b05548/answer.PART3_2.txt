<quotes>
[1] "Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are promoted with boron to enhance their performance during PDH."

[2] "Three different synthesis routes were followed. (1) Pt/XB-γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared via wet impregnation of aqueous H2PtCl6 (Sigma-Aldrich, 39 wt % Pt) onto XB-γ-Al2O3 support materials." 

[3] "In order to evaluate the effect of the impregnation sequence, 1B/Pt-γ-Al2O3 was prepared via wet impregnation of aqueous H3BO3 onto Pt/γ-Al2O3: i.e., an inverse sequential impregnation."

[4] "Finally, Pt-1B-γ-Al2O3 was prepared by coimpregnation of boron and platinum, followed by solvent evaporation and calcination."

Answer: The article investigates different catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it evaluates wet impregnation, sequential impregnation, and co-impregnation of platinum and boron on a γ-Al2O3 support. The goal is to enhance the performance of Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.
