[1] "Recently, the introduction of small amounts of boron reduces coke formation on nickel (16) during steam reforming and on cobalt (17) during FischerTropsch synthesis."

[2] "Propylene is an important building block for a variety of bulk chemicals and polymers (1) and is mainly produced by naphtha steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. (1,2)"  

[3] "In this work, Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are promoted with boron to enhance their performance during PDH. A systematic approach was followed, where a series of catalysts with different boron loadings was prepared using various impregnation sequences. Catalytic tests evaluate the effect of boron on the catalysts activity, selectivity, and stability."

[4] "The sequential addition of 1 wt % boron to Pt/γ-Al2O3 reduces both the activity and the amount of deposited carbon." 

[5] "Reversing the impregnation sequence, namely first modifying the γ-Al2O3 support with boron, followed by platinum impregnation, has a minor effect on the activity but reduces the amount of deposited carbon by a factor of 2.6."

[6] "Promotion with 1 wt % boron decreases the amount of carbon 3-fold and increases the propylene selectivity from 90 to 98% over a 12 h PDH experiment. This enhanced performance corresponds to a 40% increase in the total propylene yield."

[7] "TEM images (Figure S2) give mean platinum particle sizes of 1.1 and 1.6 nm for Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/1B-γ-Al2O3, respectively (Table 4)."

[8] "Hydrogen pulse chemisorption at ambient temperature shows a higher hydrogen uptake, within experimental error, for Pt/1B-γ-Al2O3 than for Pt/γ-Al2O3."

5. The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It systematically investigates the effect of boron promotion on the activity, selectivity, and stability of Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with different boron loadings and impregnation sequences. The addition of 1 wt% boron by modifying the γ-Al2O3 support first reduces carbon deposition and increases propylene selectivity, corresponding to a 40% increase in propylene yield over 12 hours. TEM and chemisorption characterization show boron promotion increases Pt particle size and H2 uptake.

5. 这篇文章评估了负载在γ-Al2O3上的单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它系统地研究了硼促进剂对具有不同硼负载量和浸渍顺序的Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性的影响。先修改γ-Al2O3支撑体加入1 wt%的硼能够减少碳沉积和提高丙烯选择性,在12小时内对应丙烯产量提高40%。TEM和化学吸附表征显示硼促进剂增加了Pt颗粒大小和H2吸附量。

[2] "Hydrogen pulse chemisorption at ambient temperature shows a higher hydrogen uptake, within experimental error, for Pt/1B-γ-Al2O3 than for Pt/γ-Al2O3."

[3] "XRD patterns (Figure S3) of the promoted catalysts and of the borated γ-Al2O3 show no boron oxide diffraction peaks, indicating that boron is present as particles smaller than 3 nm or as an amorphous phase."

[4] "In situ XRD measurements for the promoted catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere at 600 C do not show any shift in platinums most intense peak at 39.8 (Figure S4), thus excluding the formation of a bulk PtB alloy."

[5] "EDX mapping (Figure S5) reveals a uniform distribution of boron over the sample, suggesting that boron oxide also does not form larger particles during calcination."

[6] "NH3-TPD of the γ-Al2O3 support shows distinct peaks at 165 and 275 C and a broader feature above 350 C, corresponding to weak, medium, and strong acid sites, respectively. The introduction of 1 wt % boron drastically reduces the number of medium and strong acid sites and slightly increases the number of weak acid sites."

6. The article investigates how boron promotion affects platinum particle size, distribution, alloy formation, and support acidity. TEM shows increased Pt particle size with boron promotion. XRD and in situ measurements indicate no bulk Pt-B alloy is formed. EDX shows uniform boron distribution, suggesting dispersed boron oxide. NH3-TPD reveals boron removes medium and strong acid sites on the alumina support.
