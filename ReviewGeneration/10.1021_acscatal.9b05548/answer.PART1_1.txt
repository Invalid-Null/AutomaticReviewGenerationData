[1] "In this work, Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are promoted with boron to enhance their performance during PDH."

[2] "The catalyst characterization and DFT calculations indicate that the boron promoter is present as a finely dispersed amorphous oxide both on the support and on the platinum particles."

[3] "Promotion with 1 wt % boron decreases the amount of carbon 3-fold and increases the propylene selectivity from 90 to 98% over a 12 h PDH experiment."

5. The article evaluates boron promoted Pt/γ-Al2O3 mono-metallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing that 1 wt% boron promotion reduces carbon deposition 3-fold and increases propylene selectivity from 90% to 98% over 12 hours. Characterization and DFT calculations indicate boron forms a finely dispersed amorphous oxide on the Pt particles and support.

[1] "The sequential addition of 1 wt % boron to Pt/γ-Al2O3 reduces both the activity and the amount of deposited carbon." 

[2] "Reversing the impregnation sequence, namely first modifying the γ-Al2O3 support with boron, followed by platinum impregnation, has a minor effect on the activity but reduces the amount of deposited carbon by a factor of 2.6."

[3] "Once the most promising impregnation sequence was identified, the effect of boron loading was evaluated."

6. The article investigates how boron loading and impregnation sequence affect the performance of Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. It shows introducing 1 wt% boron before platinum reduces carbon deposition 2.6X while minimally affecting activity. Increasing boron loading further reduces carbon deposition. The data reveals structure-function relationships between boron and platinum.
