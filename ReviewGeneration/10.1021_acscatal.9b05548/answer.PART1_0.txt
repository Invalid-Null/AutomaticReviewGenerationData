<quotes>
[1] "In this work, Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are promoted with boron to enhance their performance during PDH." 

[2] "Specifically, promotion with 1 wt % boron decreases the amount of carbon 3-fold and increases the propylene selectivity from 90 to 98% over a 12 h PDH experiment."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates the supported mono-metallic catalyst Pt/γ-Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that adding 1 wt% boron promoter reduces coke formation by 3 times and increases propylene selectivity from 90% to 98% over 12 hours.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文评估了单金属负载催化剂Pt/γ-Al2O3用于丙烷脱氢。它显示添加1 wt%的硼促进剂使焦炭形成降低了3倍,并使丙烯选择性在12小时内从90%提高到98%。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "The sequential addition of 1 wt % boron to Pt/γ-Al2O3 reduces both the activity and the amount of deposited carbon."

[2] "Reversing the impregnation sequence, namely first modifying the γ-Al2O3 support with boron, followed by platinum impregnation, has a minor effect on the activity but reduces the amount of deposited carbon by a factor of 2.6."

[3] "Once the most promising impregnation sequence was identified, the effect of boron loading was evaluated. Both the activity and carbon formation are affected by the boron loading."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like impregnation sequence and boron loading affect coke formation and activity of the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Adding boron before platinum reduced coke more than after. Increasing boron loading from 0.5 wt% to 1.5 wt% decreased coke formation.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文研究了浸渍顺序和硼负载等属性如何影响Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂的焦炭形成和活性。在钼前添加硼比钼后添加硼降低了更多的焦炭。当硼负载从0.5 wt% 增加到1.5 wt%时,焦炭形成降低了。
