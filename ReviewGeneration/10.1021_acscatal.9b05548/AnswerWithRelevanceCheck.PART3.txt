         [1] "Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are promoted with boron to enhance their performance during PDH."

         [2] "Three different synthesis routes were followed. (1) Pt/XB-γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared via wet impregnation of aqueous H2PtCl6 (Sigma-Aldrich, 39 wt % Pt) onto XB-γ-Al2O3 support materials." 

         [3] "In order to evaluate the effect of the impregnation sequence, 1B/Pt-γ-Al2O3 was prepared via wet impregnation of aqueous H3BO3 onto Pt/γ-Al2O3: i.e., an inverse sequential impregnation."

         [4] "Finally, Pt-1B-γ-Al2O3 was prepared by coimpregnation of boron and platinum, followed by solvent evaporation and calcination."

         Answer: The article investigates different catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it evaluates wet impregnation, sequential impregnation, and co-impregnation of platinum and boron on a γ-Al2O3 support. The goal is to enhance the performance of Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

         [1] "TEM images (Figure S2) give mean platinum particle sizes of 1.1 and 1.6 nm for Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/1B-γ-Al2O3, respectively (Table 4)."

         [2] "EDX mapping (Figure S5) reveals a uniform distribution of boron over the sample, suggesting that boron oxide also does not form larger particles during calcination."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         Answer: The article employs TEM imaging and EDX mapping to characterize the metal-support interface. Data reveals a mean platinum particle size of 1.1-1.6 nm and a uniform distribution of boron over the alumina support, suggesting no boron oxide agglomeration occurs during calcination.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         答:该文献采用TEM成像和EDX映射来表征金属-支撑体界面。数据显示铂的平均粒径为1.1-1.6纳米,硼在氧化铝支撑体上的分布均匀,说明在煅烧过程中没有硼氧化物团聚发生。
