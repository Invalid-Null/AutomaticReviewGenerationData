An economic feasibility study for water gas shift membrane reactor
Abstract
An economical analysis of palladium membrane reactors for the water gas shift (WGS) reaction is presented and discussed. In particular, a comparison of costs between the conventional apparatus and different membrane systems, for a fixed pure hydrogen recovery, is reported. The effect of the palladium thickness and of the membrane permeability to hydrogen on costs of membrane devices is analysed. Both higher permeabilities and lower thickness improve the hydrogen removal leading to a decrease in membrane area for a fixed hydrogen recovery and, thus, to a cost reduction. While both capital and operating costs are higher than the traditional ones for all the range of permeabilities used, by reducing the palladium thickness, it is possible to determine a range in which membrane reactors might be cost-effective. In particular, for palladium thicknesses equal or lower than 20 μm, membrane reactors could represent a possible alternative to conventional apparatus.
1. Introduction
A membrane reactor is a device in which reaction and separation can be carried out simultaneously. Several variables are there that influence the performance of a membrane reactor. Operating conditions, engineering of the system, membrane characteristics, are all parameters to be taken into account for optimising the efficiency of the process. Studies have been made and are still in progress on such devices [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] which evidences their growing strategic role. With membrane reactors it is, in fact, possible to rationalise various chemical transformations (dehydrogenations, hydrogenations, oxidative dehydrogenations, catalytic decompositions, etc.) achieving higher conversions or selectivities with respect to the conventional systems and the same productivity of traditional apparatus can be reached at lower energy consumptions. When the membrane used is highly selective for the product of interest, it is possible to recover it directly during the reaction and there is no need of separation units after the reactor. In the last years, a lot of work has been done by material scientists and chemical engineering to improve membrane reactors performance and overcome problems like membrane durability or sealing membrane-module resistance at high temperatures and pressures; membranes more and more selective and highly permeable have been prepared. The improvements achieved in membrane reactors technology allowed to make them closer to the industrial world. The introduction of membrane reactors in an industrial context is strongly dependent on the economic of the membrane process. For this purpose, in the present contribution, an economical analysis of membrane reactors applied to the water gas shift (WGS) is reported. In a previous study [7], the optimal operating conditions and the membrane performance have been determined for the WGS reaction. From this analysis it results that by utilising a membrane reactor it is possible to obtain higher conversions with respect to a traditional reactor working in the same operating conditions. Moreover, by using a palladium membrane reactor, through which only hydrogen can permeate, complete conversion is achieved. An economical study [8] for the same reaction carried out in an Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle system, by using microporous silica membranes, pointed out that higher stable and selective gas separation membranes were necessary in order to have favourable investment and operational costs. Other studies devoted to the determination of the economic of membrane reactors for the steam reforming of methane [9] and the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene [10] appeared recently in literature.
A tentative analysis of the costs related to WGS membrane palladium systems (highly selective to hydrogen) with respect to reactors used in industry is now proposed. The aim of this contribution is to help in establishing how much membrane reactors are far from industrial applications for carrying out, as a particular case, the WGS reaction and on which aspects it is necessary to work to make them feasible. In fact the results achieved can help in indicating in which direction the scientific research has to be addressed in order to make catalytic membrane reactors competitive with respect to traditional systems.
2. Methodology of work
At first, industrial data from a plant for synthesis gas production, the oxo synthesis gas plant in Augusta (Italy), have been utilised to make a scale-up of a membrane reactor in terms of membrane areas required to operate with industrial quantities and to achieve industrial hydrogen recovery. On the basis of these data the costs related to a membrane reactor as energy requirements, catalyst and membrane costs [11] and so on, have been calculated. Then, these costs have been compared with the ones related to conventional reactors used, at high temperature (HT) and low temperature (LT), for the WGS reaction. In particular, for the traditional case, costs related to both reactors (HT and LT) and separation device have been considered for making the comparison.
3. Results and discussion
In traditional processes, two reactors are used in series (HT followed by LT) and the desired quantity of pure hydrogen is obtained in a separation unit at the exit of LT reactor. In the present analysis, a membrane system is considered to substitute the reactors-separation device. In Table 1, typical inlet and outlet compositions for the HTLT system and the operating conditions used are reported. Normally, the output stream is purified to recover up to 85% of pure hydrogen (99.9999).

Operating conditions: T=623K; H2O/CO=9.8; P=16atm; 138kmol/h of pure hydrogen recovered.
The calculations for membrane reactors have been made for both H2O/CO molar ratio of 9.8 (industrial value) (MR1) and H2O/CO molar ratio of 2 (MR2) and have been stopped when the industrial hydrogen recovery has been achieved. The MR2 is included because the membrane allows to operate with lower H2O in the reactor due to the H2 removal which pushes the equilibrium to the right. Same type of calculations have been also carried out for the case in which, at first, the hydrogen in the mixture is removed by a palladium membrane separator and, then, the mixture is fed to the palladium membrane reactor. For the membrane reactor, the calculations have been made for both the H2O/CO ratios (9.8  MRs1 and 2  MRs2). The simulation has been carried out for a single tubular membrane fed with a stream of 0.025 mol/s. Industrial flow rates will be processed by using more tubular membranes (each one fed with the same flow rate used in the simulation) lodged in a single shell. The kinetic expression used for calculations was the equation of Temkin which quite well predicts the experimental data previously obtained for the same type of reactor [7]. Pure hydrogen is recovered as permeate at atmospheric pressure without using sweep gas at the shell side. The calculations, starting from a palladium thickness of 75 μm, which is the thickness used during the experimental work [7], are extended as far as 5 μm. The mathematical model, discussed elsewhere [7], is based on the formulation of differential mass balances at steady-state. The flux of hydrogen through the membrane is obtained by considering two mass transfer resistances in series:
•
the resistance through the film at the interface between the inside membrane wall and the gas mixture;
•
the resistance through the palladium layer.
Sieverts law has been used to describe the permeability of hydrogen through the palladium layer. This law is generally correct, as far as thicknesses of 10 μm being the surface phenomena, which cause deviations from it, dominant for lower values of thicknesses. In particular, we found that
•
for a palladium thickness of 10 μm, the highest resistance is offered by the palladium; this means that Sieverts law is applicable;
•
at 5 μm, both palladium and surface resistance are equally important; e.g. an error of 45% is made by calculating the flux by using Sieverts law;
•
at 1 μm the surface resistance dominates (85%) and great errors are made in using Sieverts law.
For these reasons, the calculations have been extended as far as 5 μm. Some hypothesis made in order to simplify the calculations are:
•
isothermal and isobaric conditions (experimentally verified);
•
negligible effect of competitive reactions (experimentally verified);
•
plug flow fluid dynamic regime;
•
ideal gas behaviour.
Table 2(ae) show the inlet and outlet compositions and the operating conditions considered for the membrane systems analysed. They are the results of the theoretical calculations and have been determined by stopping the simulation when at the permeate side the industrial hydrogen recovery has been achieved.

Table 3 shows the results of the scale-up in comparison with the characteristics of the reactors industrially employed (high and low temperature). The HT and LT reactors are used in series and their total catalyst weight has to be compared to that in membrane reactors. All membrane devices present lower volumes and lower catalyst quantities.

For carrying out the economical study the data showed in Table 4 have been considered. When membrane reactors are used, pure hydrogen is recovered as permeate at atmospheric pressure. In order to be utilised it has to be compressed up to 16 atm, thus, the compression costs have been taken into account. For the palladium membrane a lifetime of 3 years has been considered. The replacement cost has been calculated as: membrane cost/lifetime. In the analysis we have not considered the possibility to recover the palladium from the replaced membranes; in this way, it refers to the worse situation.

Reactor and separator costs have been calculated by adding to the membrane costs the assembling costs (4% of membrane costs).
Table 5 shows the result of the economical analysis. The difference in costs for the several membrane systems is mainly related to the quantity of hydrogen present in the feed streams: higher hydrogen presence, higher driving force and lower membrane area required for its removal up to the wanted value. In particular, the SeparatorMRs2 system allows the desired hydrogen recovery at the lowest capital and operating costs. However, membrane devices are more expensive than traditional ones.

Today, the higher costs are essentially due to the palladium price. By reducing the thickness of the palladium membrane it is possible to determine a range in which membrane reactors could be convenient.The effect of membrane thickness on costs is reported in Fig. 1, Fig. 2. For palladium thickness of 5 μm there is a confluence of costs. Lower thickness mean higher permeation rate which leads to the desired hydrogen recovery with lower membrane areas for all membrane systems. When this thickness is of 5μm, the permeation rate is so fast that the difference in membrane areas is reduced for the several membrane devices. Also at very low palladium thickness, the difference in operating costs between MR1Separator+MRs1 and MR2Separator+MRs2 is due to the different amount of steam used for the reaction. Another possible way for reducing the costs of membrane systems might be the use of materials more permeable to hydrogen than palladium. Zirconium, niobium, tantalum and vanadium all have significantly higher bulk of hydrogen permeabilities than does palladium. Unfortunately, the direct replacement of palladium for cheaper refractory metals as membranes is hindered because these metals form oxide layers and the surface reaction limits the hydrogen flux [12]. For this reason we just considered the hypothetical existence of materials more permeable of palladium but with the same costs and durability to analyse how, theoretically, they could influence the economical calculations. The new permeabilities have been calculated as multiple of the palladium one, e.g. Pe=2 means a permeability double with respect to the palladium one. The permeability of hydrogen through the palladium is of 1.63×108 mol m/m2 s Pa0.5 at 595 K [7].

The effect of the permeability on costs is reported in Fig. 3, Fig. 4. Higher permeabilities improve the hydrogen removal leading to a decrease in membrane area for a fixed hydrogen recovery and, thus, to a cost reduction. However, when permeability is increased, there is not a confluence of costs although the same difference in membrane areas is achieved with respect to the case in which the palladium thickness is reduced. In fact, when the palladium thickness is reduced, there is a saving in terms of costs of the membrane (lower quantities of palladium necessary). Table 6 shows this situation. For example, when working with permeabilities 10 times higher than the permeability of the palladium, membrane area for MR2 becomes equal to 193 m2. The same membrane area is obtained by reducing the palladium thickness to 10 μm. However, in the last case the reactor costs are lower (126,421 Euro against 1.036×106 Euro) because lower quantity of palladium are now required (thickness of 10 μm against 75 μm).

Pe represents the permeability of the hypothetical new material, calculated as multiple of the palladium one, e.g. Pe=2 means a permeability double with respect to the palladium one; the permeability of hydrogen through the palladium is of 1.63×108molm/m2s Pa0.5 at 595K [7].
Both capital and operating costs result to be higher than the traditional ones for all the range of permeabilities. It has to be noted that as the permeability gets high, the membrane area required for recovering the industrial quantity of hydrogen is reduced, with consequent cost reduction. The same happens when palladium thickness decreases. However, there is a limit value both for permeability and thickness (very high permeabilities and very low thickness) beyond which costs become nearly independent of both permeability and thickness because all the process is controlled by the reaction rate and not by the permeation (which is now very fast).
4. Conclusions
Membrane reactors while not already present at industrial level represent useful systems to improve chemical reactions yield and to enhance the performance of chemical productions. Operations like tritium recovery can be, for example, carried out successfully by using highly selective palladium membrane reactors. The introduction of palladium membrane reactors in an industrial context seems to be particularly dependent on the membrane cost. Current technology, in fact, while able of selectively removing hydrogen is not economically feasible at present. Current methods of preparing palladium membranes are today extremely expensive due to the inadequate productivity per unit membrane area. At present it is difficult to have a reliable estimate of the cost of production of palladium membranes. The optimal technology for the realisation of membrane reactors with high surface is, in fact, to be defined yet. It is almost impossible to obtain from the potential suppliers reliable quotations on materials, type of manufactures, devices which do not constitute their standard of production. It is also very difficult to define criteria for extrapolating quotations relative to the construction of a reactor-prototype for the case in which a considerable number of devices is produced. It could be supposed that, when the number of membrane reactors produced will increase, there will be an enormous decrease of the costs of production. The point is that a well developed technology of membrane reactors production does not exist nowadays and improvements in this field have to be done in order to make membrane reactors feasible. From the present analysis the possibility of introducing membrane reactors for the water gas shift reaction at industrial level is related to the future developments in the research work. In particular, this has to be addressed to the preparation of defect-free palladium membranes with a selective layer of 20 μm or less. Finding new materials or alloys more permeable to hydrogen and less expensive than palladium might represent another possible way to make membrane apparatus more competitive than traditional ones. Apart from the membrane durability which has to be increased, the improvement of the membrane reactors technology will help their entrance into the industrial world. It is expected that, in the future, the rationalisation of various chemical processes might be possible by integrating membrane reactors in the whole system of industrial chemical productions.
