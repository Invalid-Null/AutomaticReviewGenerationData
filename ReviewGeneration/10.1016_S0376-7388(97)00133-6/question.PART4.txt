I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

An experimental evaluation of high-temperature composite membrane systems for propane dehydrogenation
Abstract
Experiments have been performed using a high-temperature membrane reactor to evaluate the relative performance of various composite membranes. Two membrane categories (porous and dense) and three types of composite membrane systems (Pd/Ag, silica and Pd-dispersed porous) have been studied and their performance compared. Also considered is the special case of the PdAg composite system having imperfections. The industrially important reaction of propane dehydrogenation over noble metal catalysts to produce propylene was selected for study. Results have been obtained which indicate that the dense PdAg composite system does possess higher performance levels in the temperature range studied. However, metal-dispersed porous systems have advantages due to their significantly higher contact surface-to-volume ratio. High hydrogen permselectivity is confirmed as a key factor in determining reactor performance in terms of conversion enhancement.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
