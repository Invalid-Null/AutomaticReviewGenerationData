[1] "HAADF-STEM images of 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP acquired after H2 pretreatment are presented in Figure 2CE. Figure 2C shows a uniform distribution of Pt aggregates with diameters of 12 nm after H2 pretreatment."  

[2] "Figure 2E shows that these aggregates consist of single Pt atoms (marked with red circles) and what appear to be pairs of Pt atoms (marked with yellow circles)."

[3] "X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) characterization of 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP was done after reducing the sample in flowing H2 at 873 K for 60 min (Figure 3)."

5. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It uses HAADF-STEM, XANES, and EXAFS to characterize the Pt/Zn-zeolite catalysts and shows that Pt exists as isolated atoms and potentially small clusters after H2 reduction. The mono-metallic Pt sites demonstrate high activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation.

[1] "HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP are presented in Figures 2A,B. The images of 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP shown in Figure 2A,B clearly demonstrate that the card-like morphology of the SPP zeolite was retained after introduction of Pt, as were ca. 2 nm-thick nanosheets comprising the zeolite."

[2] "Figure 2E shows that these aggregates consist of single Pt atoms (marked with red circles) and what appear to be pairs of Pt atoms (marked with yellow circles)." 

[3] "The EXAFS data taken after H2-pretreated 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP had been used for PDH catalysis indicate an increase in the intensity of the feature assigned to PtZn backscattering (Figure 3b)."

<English version answer>

6. Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like Pt particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported Pt catalysts. It shows using HAADF-STEM that ultra-small Pt species down to single atoms are stabilized on the zeolite support even after pretreatment and reaction. EXAFS data also suggests changes in Pt coordination during reaction, indicating metal-support interactions. The ultra-small Pt species demonstrate high propane dehydrogenation activity.

[1] "The catalytic cycle is initiated by propane adsorption (Step 1a) and followed by the dissociation of a CH bond in the methyl group of adsorbed propane (Step 2a), which leads to the formation of a propyl group and a H atom bonded to Pt."

[2] "The abstraction of a second hydrogen also occurs on the Pt atom (Step 3a), followed by hydrogen desorption (Steps 4a and 5a). Propene desorption (Step 6a) completes the catalytic cycle."
