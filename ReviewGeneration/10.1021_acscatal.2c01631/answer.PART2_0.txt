[1] "We have recently demonstrated stabilization of Pt predominantly as isolated atoms by interaction with SiOZn-OH nests formed by grafting Zn into silanol nests of dealuminated zeolite β (DeAlBEA)."

[2] "Motivated by these findings, we asked whether the activity and stability of such sites could be further enhanced by placing them on the external surface of a zeolite support rather than within zeolite micropores."

[3] "Pt was added to 2.4Zn-SPP following the method described in the Experimental Section of the Supporting Information (SI). ICP data showed that all of the Pt was introduced onto the zeolite (Table S1)." 

[4] "HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared 0.2Pt2.4Zn-SPP, 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP, and 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP are presented in Figures 2 and S2D,E."

[5] "Analysis of the EXAFS data revealed the presence of a PtZn scattering path, with a PtZn distance of 2.49 ± 0.15 Å, which is similar to that for the PtZn alloy, (10) PtZn clusters, (8) and isolated PtZn complexes. (21)"

[6] "The EXAFS data taken after H2-pretreated 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP had been used for PDH catalysis indicate an increase in the intensity of the feature assigned to PtZn backscattering (Figure 3b)."

2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Zn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It found that Pt stabilized by neighboring SiOZn-OH sites formed isolated (Si-O-Zn)4-5Pt species that were highly active and stable for propane dehydrogenation when placed on the external surface of self-pillared pentasil zeolite nanosheets. EXAFS data showed the presence of Pt-Zn bonds similar to a Pt-Zn alloy.

2. 答案:是的,文章评估了Pt-Zn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它发现Pt被相邻的SiOZn-OH位稳定,形成了隔离的(Si-O-Zn)4-5Pt物种,当放置在自支撑五角绝缘体纳米片的外表面时,这些物种对于丙烷脱氢反应有很高的活性和稳定性。 EXAFS数据显示存在类似Pt-Zn合金的Pt-Zn键。

[1] "We have recently shown (Qi , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021, 143, 21364–21378) that these objectives can be met for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using atomically dispersed Pt anchored to neighboring SiOZn-OH groups bonded to the framework of dealuminated zeolite BEA."

[2] "A further reason for selecting SPP zeolite is that it has a high concentration of hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) silanol groups that are distributed mainly on the external surfaces of the nanosheets."

[3] "Pt was added to 2.4Zn-SPP following the method described in the Experimental Section of the Supporting Information (SI). ICP data showed that all of the Pt was introduced onto the zeolite (Table S1)."

[4] "HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared 0.2Pt2.4Zn-SPP, 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP, and 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP are presented in Figures 2 and S2D,E." 

[5] "Virtually identical activity, selectivity, and stability were observed for reactions carried out with Pt loadings of 0.2 and 0.4 wt %."

6. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates zeolite supports like BEA and MFI structures for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It found high activity, selectivity and stability when using self-pillared pentasil (MFI) zeolite nanosheets as the support, with Pt anchored to SiOZn-OH groups on the external surface. Similar performance was seen for Pt loadings of 0.2% and 0.4% on this MFI support.
