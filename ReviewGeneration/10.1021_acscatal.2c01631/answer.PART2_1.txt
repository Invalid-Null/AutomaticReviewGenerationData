[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane and n-butane catalyzed by isolated PtZn4 sites supported on self-pillared zeolite pentasil nanosheets"

[2] "The intrinsic activation energy determined from an Arrhenius plot for the dehydrogenation rate coefficient (kd1) is 67.4 kJ/mol. Consistent with expectation, the butene adsorption enthalpy is greater in magnitude than that for n-butane on each catalyst, and the adsorption of butenes is stronger than the adsorption of n-butane."

[3] "As shown in Figure S9, (Si-O-Zn)4-5Pt-SPP sites exhibit a much higher stability for both PDH and BDH than do (Si-O-Zn)4-6Pt-DeAlBEA sites. At 823 K, at a reactor inlet propane partial pressure of 25 kPa and a WHSV of ca. 1400 h−1, kdeac = 0.002 h−1 for (Si-O-Zn)4-6Pt-DeAlBEA sites (after 160 h), whereas almost no deactivation was observed for (Si-O-Zn)4Pt-SPP sites (after 280 h)."

2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates PtZn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on the intrinsic activation energy, adsorption enthalpies, and long-term stability of PtZn sites supported on zeolites for propane and butane dehydrogenation. The PtZn sites showed higher stability and intrinsic activity compared to other Pt-containing catalysts.

[1] "Dehydrogenation of Propane and n-Butane Catalyzed by Isolated PtZn4 Sites Supported on Self-Pillared Zeolite Pentasil Nanosheets"  

[2] "We have recently shown (Qi , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021, 143, 2136421378) that these objectives can be met for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using atomically dispersed Pt anchored to neighboring SiOZn-OH groups bonded to the framework of dealuminated zeolite BEA."

[3] "Taken together, the characterization data suggest that Pt was present in structures well approximated as (Si-O-Zn)4-5Pt and that these species are the active centers for alkane dehydrogenation catalysis."
