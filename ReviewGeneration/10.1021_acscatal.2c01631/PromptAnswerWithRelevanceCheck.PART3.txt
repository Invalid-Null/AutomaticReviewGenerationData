[1] "We have recently shown (Qi , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021, 143, 2136421378) that these objectives can be met for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using atomically dispersed Pt anchored to neighboring SiOZn-OH groups bonded to the framework of dealuminated zeolite BEA."

[2] "A two-step method was used to prepare isolated PtZn sites supported on SPP. First, SiOZn-OH groups were grafted onto the support hydroxyl groups, (40) and these groups were then used to anchor Pt atoms."  

[3] "HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP are presented in Figure 2A,B. The images of 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP shown in Figure 2A,B clearly demonstrate that the card-like morphology of the SPP zeolite was retained after introduction of Pt, as were ca. 2 nm-thick nanosheets comprising the zeolite."

[4] "Figure 2E shows that these aggregates consist of single Pt atoms (marked with red circles) and what appear to be pairs of Pt atoms (marked with yellow circles)."

[5] "X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) characterization of 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP was done after reducing the sample in flowing H2 at 873 K for 60 min (Figure 3). The Pt LIII-edge white line intensity of the 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP XANES spectrum is similar to that of metallic Pt used as a standard, but the white line energy is shifted by +1.5 eV from that of metallic Pt (Figure S4)."

<English version answer>

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes a two-step method to prepare isolated PtZn sites on a self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite support. HAADF-STEM images show that the SPP morphology was retained after adding Pt, with Pt present as isolated atoms and pairs of atoms. XANES/EXAFS characterization confirms the high dispersion of Pt after H2 reduction.

22. 答: 这篇文章没有描述在沸石支撑体上合成隔离的单点位的技术。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "Motivated by these findings, we asked whether the activity and stability of such sites could be further enhanced by placing them on the external surface of a zeolite support rather than within zeolite micropores."

[2] "A central conclusion of this work is that the higher stability of the former sites can be attributed to their location on the planar external surfaces of the SPP zeolite support, wherebecause of the lack of mass transport limitationsthe local concentration of the product alkene or dialkene is lower than it would be within the narrow pores of DeAlBEA."

</quotes>

<English version answer>  

23. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates encapsulating metals in zeolite supports to enhance the stability of propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It compares placing active sites on the external surface of SPP zeolite nanosheets versus within the micropores of dealuminated zeolite beta. The external surface sites showed higher stability, which is attributed to lower local concentrations of alkene products that can lead to coking.

<Chinese version answer>

23. 答:是的,这篇文章评估了在沸石支撑体中封装金属以提高丙烷脱氢催化剂的稳定性。它比较了将活性位点放在自支撑五元环沸石纳米片的外表面上与放在去铝β沸石的微孔内。外表面位点显示出更高的稳定性,这归因于较低的烯烃产物的局部浓度,这些产物可能导致焦炭生成。
