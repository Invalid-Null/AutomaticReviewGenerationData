[1] "We have recently demonstrated stabilization of Pt predominantly as isolated atoms by interaction with SiOZn-OH nests formed by grafting Zn into silanol nests of dealuminated zeolite β (DeAlBEA)."

[2] "Motivated by these findings, we asked whether the activity and stability of such sites could be further enhanced by placing them on the external surface of a zeolite support rather than within zeolite micropores."

[3] "Pt was added to 2.4Zn-SPP following the method described in the Experimental Section of the Supporting Information (SI). ICP data showed that all of the Pt was introduced onto the zeolite (Table S1)." 

[4] "HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared 0.2Pt2.4Zn-SPP, 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP, and 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP are presented in Figures 2 and S2D,E."

[5] "Analysis of the EXAFS data revealed the presence of a PtZn scattering path, with a PtZn distance of 2.49 ± 0.15 Å, which is similar to that for the PtZn alloy, (10) PtZn clusters, (8) and isolated PtZn complexes. (21)"

[1] "We have recently shown (Qi , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021, 143, 21364–21378) that these objectives can be met for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using atomically dispersed Pt anchored to neighboring SiOZn-OH groups bonded to the framework of dealuminated zeolite BEA."

[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane and n-butane catalyzed by isolated PtZn4 sites supported on self-pillared zeolite pentasil nanosheets"

[2] "The intrinsic activation energy determined from an Arrhenius plot for the dehydrogenation rate coefficient (kd1) is 67.4 kJ/mol. Consistent with expectation, the butene adsorption enthalpy is greater in magnitude than that for n-butane on each catalyst, and the adsorption of butenes is stronger than the adsorption of n-butane."

[3] "As shown in Figure S9, (Si-O-Zn)4-5Pt-SPP sites exhibit a much higher stability for both PDH and BDH than do (Si-O-Zn)4-6Pt-DeAlBEA sites. At 823 K, at a reactor inlet propane partial pressure of 25 kPa and a WHSV of ca. 1400 h−1, kdeac = 0.002 h−1 for (Si-O-Zn)4-6Pt-DeAlBEA sites (after 160 h), whereas almost no deactivation was observed for (Si-O-Zn)4Pt-SPP sites (after 280 h)."

<English version answer>
2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Zn, Pt-Sn, and Pt-Ga alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing that alloying Pt with Zn, Sn, Ga, and other metals helps decrease the size of Pt clusters and improve activity, selectivity, and stability compared to monometallic Pt. The article also investigates atomically dispersed Pt stabilized by SiOZn-OH groups in zeolites, formed by grafting Zn into the zeolite framework. This PtZn-zeolite catalyst showed high activity, selectivity and stability attributed to isolated PtZn4-6 sites.

[4] "HAADF-STEM images, in combination with X-ray absorption spectra, demonstrate that Pt is stabilized predominantly as isolated atoms bonded to neighboring SiOZn-OH sites and that, upon H2 reduction, these sites form isolated (Si-O-Zn)4-5Pt species that are the active centers for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene and n-butane dehydrogenation (BDH) to 1,3-butadiene."

<English version answer>  
6. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates MFI and pentasil zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses a self-pillared pentasil zeolite support and shows that grafting Pt onto SiOZn-OH groups on the zeolite surface results in highly dispersed Pt atoms that are active sites for propane dehydrogenation to propene. The external zeolite surface location is proposed to enhance activity and stability compared to Pt sites within zeolite micropores.

[5] "The results suggest that new PtZn bonds might have formed during PDH, perhaps by restructuring of the PtZn species resulting from migration of the Zn and/or Pt atoms at high temperatures of catalysis."

[6] "The formation of isolated structures approximated, on average, as PtZn4-5 during PDH is attributed to the higher strength of PtZn (0.49 eV) than that of PtPt bonds (0.46 eV)."

2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Zn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that PtZn sites anchored on zeolites are highly active, selective and stable for propane dehydrogenation. EXAFS data indicates Pt is present as PtZn4-5 sites, with Pt-Zn coordination numbers around 3-5 and Pt-Zn distances around 2.49 Å, similar to PtZn alloys and clusters. During reaction, new Pt-Zn bonds may form, stabilizing the active PtZn4-5 sites. This is attributed to the higher bond strength of Pt-Zn versus Pt-Pt bonds.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
2. 答:是的,文章评估了Pt-Zn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它表明锚定在沸石上的PtZn活性位点对于丙烷脱氢反应具有高活性、高选择性和高稳定性。EXAFS数据表明Pt存在于PtZn4-5位点,Pt-Zn配位数约为3-5,Pt-Zn距离约为2.49 Å,类似于PtZn合金和簇。在反应过程中,可能形成新的Pt-Zn键,稳定了活性的PtZn4-5位点。这归因于Pt-Zn键的键能高于Pt-Pt键能。

6. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates MFI and BEA zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows superior performance is achieved using self-pillared pentasil (MFI) zeolite nanosheets versus dealuminated BEA zeolite. The 2 nm thick MFI sheets with 0.5 nm micropores and 2-7 nm mesopores provide high concentration of silanol groups on the external surface to disperse and stabilize PtZn sites. This gives better activity, selectivity and stability than PtZn sites within the micropores of BEA.

[1] "Decreasing the size of Pt clusters can be achieved by alloying with, for example, Cu, (28) Zn, (8,10,14,21) Fe, (29) Ga, (30) In, (31) Sn, (1,11,24) Mn, (32) Co, (33) or La. (4)"

[2] "We have recently demonstrated stabilization of Pt predominantly as isolated atoms by interaction with SiOZn-OH nests formed by grafting Zn into silanol nests of dealuminated zeolite β (DeAlBEA). (21)" 

[3] "Characterization of the resulting catalyst (referred to as PtZn-DeAlBEA) showed that, upon activation, Pt is present as structures approximated as (Si-O-Zn)4-6Pt, which are highly active, selective, and stable for PDH."

[4] "A two-step method was used to prepare isolated PtZn sites supported on SPP. First, SiOZn-OH groups were grafted onto the support hydroxyl groups, (40) and these groups were then used to anchor Pt atoms. We designate such catalysts as xPt-yZn-SPP (x and y represent the weight percentages of Pt and Zn, respectively)."

2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Zn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It reports that alloying Pt with Zn helps decrease the size of Pt clusters and stabilize isolated Pt atoms, which improves activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH. Specifically, it shows that (Si-O-Zn)4-6Pt sites supported on dealuminated BEA zeolite and (Si-O-Zn)4-5Pt sites on SPP zeolite nanosheets are highly active and selective PDH catalysts.

[1] "We have recently shown (Qi , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021, 143, 2136421378) that these objectives can be met for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using atomically dispersed Pt anchored to neighboring SiOZn-OH groups bonded to the framework of dealuminated zeolite BEA."

[2] "In the present study, we demonstrate that significantly superior performance can be achieved using self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite nanosheets as supports." 

[3] "Pt was added to 2.4Zn-SPP following the method described in the Experimental Section of the Supporting Information (SI). ICP data showed that all of the Pt was introduced onto the zeolite (Table S1). XRD (Figure S1) and BET measurements (Table S2) confirmed retention of the MFI zeolite framework and the surface area of the support after introduction of Pt."

6. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates MFI and BEA zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows that BEA and SPP (which has an MFI framework) zeolites both provide excellent supports for atomically dispersed Pt-Zn sites that are highly active and selective for PDH. The SiOZn-OH groups on the zeolites help anchor and stabilize the isolated Pt sites.
