         [1] "Decreasing the size of Pt clusters can be achieved by alloying with, for example, Cu, (28) Zn, (8,10,14,21) Fe, (29) Ga, (30) In, (31) Sn, (1,11,24) Mn, (32) Co, (33) or La. (4)" 

         [2] "We have recently demonstrated stabilization of Pt predominantly as isolated atoms by interaction with SiOZn-OH nests formed by grafting Zn into silanol nests of dealuminated zeolite β (DeAlBEA). (21)"

         [3] "Characterization of the resulting catalyst (referred to as PtZn-DeAlBEA) showed that, upon activation, Pt is present as structures approximated as (Si-O-Zn)4-6Pt, which are highly active, selective, and stable for PDH."

         [4] "Motivated by these findings, we asked whether the activity and stability of such sites could be further enhanced by placing them on the external surface of a zeolite support rather than within zeolite micropores." 

         [5] "A two-step method was used to prepare isolated PtZn sites supported on SPP. First, SiOZn-OH groups were grafted onto the support hydroxyl groups, (40) and these groups were then used to anchor Pt atoms. We designate such catalysts as xPt-yZn-SPP (x and y represent the weight percentages of Pt and Zn, respectively)."

         [6] "The EXAFS data revealed the presence of a PtZn scattering path, with a PtZn distance of 2.49 ± 0.15 Å, which is similar to that for the PtZn alloy, PtZn clusters, and isolated PtZn complexes."

         [7] "Analysis of the EXAFS data collected at 723 K indicates a PtZn coordination number (CN) of 3.5 ± 0.9."

         Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Zn, Pt-Sn, and Pt-Ga alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing that alloying Pt with Zn, Sn, Ga, and other metals helps decrease the size of Pt clusters and improve activity, selectivity, and stability compared to monometallic Pt. The article investigates atomically dispersed Pt stabilized by SiOZn-OH groups in zeolites, formed by grafting Zn into the zeolite framework. This PtZn-zeolite catalyst showed high activity, selectivity and stability for PDH attributed to isolated PtZn4-6 sites. EXAFS data indicates the presence of Pt-Zn bonds similar to a PtZn alloy, with Pt-Zn coordination numbers around 3-5.

         答案:是的,本文评价了Pt-Zn、Pt-Sn和Pt-Ga合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显示,与单金属Pt相比,Pt与Zn、Sn、Ga等金属形成合金有助于减小Pt簇的大小,并提高活性、选择性和稳定性。本文还研究了由嵌入Zn入分子筛框架形成的SiOZn-OH基团稳定的原子态Pt。这种PtZn分子筛催化剂表现出高活性、选择性和稳定性,归因于隔离的PtZn4-6位点。EXAFS数据表明存在类似PtZn合金的Pt-Zn键,Pt-Zn配位数约为3-5。

         [1] "We have recently shown (Qi , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021, 143, 2136421378) that these objectives can be met for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using atomically dispersed Pt anchored to neighboring SiOZn-OH groups bonded to the framework of dealuminated zeolite BEA."

         [2] "In the present study, we demonstrate that significantly superior performance can be achieved using self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite nanosheets as supports." 

         [3] "Pt was added to 2.4Zn-SPP following the method described in the Experimental Section of the Supporting Information (SI). ICP data showed that all of the Pt was introduced onto the zeolite (Table S1). XRD (Figure S1) and BET measurements (Table S2) confirmed retention of the MFI zeolite framework and the surface area of the support after introduction of Pt."

         [4] "HAADF-STEM images, in combination with X-ray absorption spectra, demonstrate that Pt is stabilized predominantly as isolated atoms bonded to neighboring SiOZn-OH sites and that, upon H2 reduction, these sites form isolated (Si-O-Zn)4-5Pt species that are the active centers for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene and n-butane dehydrogenation (BDH) to 1,3-butadiene."

         Answer: Yes, the article evaluates MFI and BEA zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows that BEA and SPP (which has an MFI framework) zeolites both provide excellent supports for atomically dispersed Pt-Zn sites that are highly active and selective for PDH. The SiOZn-OH groups on the zeolites help anchor and stabilize the isolated Pt sites.

         答案:是的,本文评估了MFI和BEA分子筛作为丙烷脱氢催化剂的载体。它显示BEA和SPP(其具有MFI框架)分子筛都为原子状态分散的Pt-Zn活性位点提供了优异的载体,这些活性位点对PDH有很高的活性和选择性。分子筛上的SiOZn-OH基团有助于锚定和稳定这些隔离的Pt位点。
