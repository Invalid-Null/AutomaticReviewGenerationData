[1] "Decreasing the size of Pt clusters can be achieved by alloying with, for example, Cu, (28) Zn, (8,10,14,21) Fe, (29) Ga, (30) In, (31) Sn, (1,11,24) Mn, (32) Co, (33) or La. (4)" 

[2] "We have recently demonstrated stabilization of Pt predominantly as isolated atoms by interaction with SiOZn-OH nests formed by grafting Zn into silanol nests of dealuminated zeolite β (DeAlBEA). (21)"

[3] "Characterization of the resulting catalyst (referred to as PtZn-DeAlBEA) showed that, upon activation, Pt is present as structures approximated as (Si-O-Zn)4-6Pt, which are highly active, selective, and stable for PDH."

[4] "Motivated by these findings, we asked whether the activity and stability of such sites could be further enhanced by placing them on the external surface of a zeolite support rather than within zeolite micropores."

[5] "Comparison of the intrinsic activities of the various Pt-containing catalysts used for PDH and BDH is challenging because of differences from one research group to another in reported reaction temperatures, feed compositions (including whether H2 was included in the feed), and WHSV."

2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Zn, Pt-Sn, and Pt-Ga alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing that alloying Pt with Zn, Sn, Ga, and other metals helps decrease the size of Pt clusters and improve activity, selectivity, and stability compared to monometallic Pt. The article also investigates atomically dispersed Pt stabilized by SiOZn-OH groups in zeolites, formed by grafting Zn into the zeolite framework. This PtZn-zeolite catalyst showed high activity, selectivity and stability attributed to isolated PtZn4-6 sites.

2. 答:是的,本文评价了Pt-Zn、Pt-Sn和Pt-Ga合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显示,与单金属Pt相比,Pt与Zn、Sn、Ga等金属形成合金有助于减小Pt簇的大小,并提高活性、选择性和稳定性。本文还研究了由嵌入Zn入分子筛框架形成的SiOZn-OH基团稳定的原子态Pt。这种PtZn分子筛催化剂表现出高活性、选择性和稳定性,归因于隔离的PtZn4-6位点。

[1] "Motivated by these findings, we asked whether the activity and stability of such sites could be further enhanced by placing them on the external surface of a zeolite support rather than within zeolite micropores." 

[2] "To address this question, we chose self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite as a support."

[3] "We have shown that Pt atoms can be dispersed by reaction with clusters of SiOZn-OH groups grafted onto the surfaces of self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite nanosheets."

[4] "HAADF-STEM images, in combination with X-ray absorption spectra, demonstrate that Pt is stabilized predominantly as isolated atoms bonded to neighboring SiOZn-OH sites and that, upon H2 reduction, these sites form isolated (Si-O-Zn)4-5Pt species that are the active centers for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene and n-butane dehydrogenation (BDH) to 1,3-butadiene."

<English version answer>  
6. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates MFI and pentasil zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses a self-pillared pentasil zeolite support and shows that grafting Pt onto SiOZn-OH groups on the zeolite surface results in highly dispersed Pt atoms that are active sites for propane dehydrogenation to propene. The external zeolite surface location is proposed to enhance activity and stability compared to Pt sites within zeolite micropores.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
6. 答:是的,本文评价了MFI和五方晶 zeolite 支持体用于丙烷脱氢催化剂。它使用了一种自支撑的五方晶沸石支持体,结果表明,将Pt嫁接到分子筛表面上的SiOZn-OH基团上可以得到高度分散的Pt原子,这些Pt原子是丙烷脱氢制丙烯的活性中心。外表面位置有助于提高活性和稳定性,相比之下Pt位于分子筛微孔内。
