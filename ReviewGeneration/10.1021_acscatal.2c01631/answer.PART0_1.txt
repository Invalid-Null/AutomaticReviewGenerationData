[1] "Because dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) and n-butane (BDH) are endergonic reactions, high temperatures (>773 K) are required for significant product yields;"

[2] "Pt exhibits high activity for CH bond activation and a relatively low activity for undesired CC bond cleavage."

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the activation energy barriers. Specifically, it states that because propane dehydrogenation is an endergonic reaction, high temperatures are required to achieve significant yields. Platinum catalysts are useful because platinum has high activity for C-H bond activation but relatively low activity for undesired C-C bond cleavage.

[1] "Thermal catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butane are attractive routes for the production of propene and 1,3-butadiene." 

[2] "Investigations of PDH on Pt-containing catalysts (15,17,18,2427) have shown that as the Pt nanocluster diameter decreases below about 2 nm, the PDH activity, propene selectivity, and resistance to coke formation increase."

[3] "Decreasing the size of Pt clusters can be achieved by alloying with, for example, Cu, (28) Zn, (8,10,14,21) Fe, (29) Ga, (30) In, (31) Sn, (1,11,24) Mn, (32) Co, (33) or La." 

[4] "Another promising approach to achieving highly active, selective, and stable Pt catalysts is to synthesize isolated Pt atoms stabilized by interactions with nonprecious metals that are chemically bonded to the support."

3. The article introduces several major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation, including supported metals, alloys, and zeolites. It states that thermal catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butane using platinum catalysts are attractive routes to produce propylene and 1,3-butadiene. Studies have shown that decreasing the size of Pt nanoclusters below 2 nm increases activity, selectivity, and coke resistance. Alloying Pt with metals like Zn, Sn, Ga, etc. is one way to achieve small Pt cluster sizes. Stabilizing isolated Pt atoms on supports using nonprecious metals is another promising approach.

4. The article discusses the thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. It states that because propane dehydrogenation is an endergonic reaction, high temperatures above 773 K are required to achieve significant yields. However, at such high temperatures, rapid catalyst deactivation occurs due to coke formation and Pt sintering.
