[1] "We have recently shown (Qi , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021, 143, 2136421378) that these objectives can be met for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using atomically dispersed Pt anchored to neighboring SiOZn-OH groups bonded to the framework of dealuminated zeolite BEA."

[2] "A two-step method was used to prepare isolated PtZn sites supported on SPP. First, SiOZn-OH groups were grafted onto the support hydroxyl groups, (40) and these groups were then used to anchor Pt atoms."  

[3] "HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP are presented in Figure 2A,B. The images of 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP shown in Figure 2A,B clearly demonstrate that the card-like morphology of the SPP zeolite was retained after introduction of Pt, as were ca. 2 nm-thick nanosheets comprising the zeolite."

[4] "Figure 2E shows that these aggregates consist of single Pt atoms (marked with red circles) and what appear to be pairs of Pt atoms (marked with yellow circles)."

[5] "X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) characterization of 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP was done after reducing the sample in flowing H2 at 873 K for 60 min (Figure 3). The Pt LIII-edge white line intensity of the 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP XANES spectrum is similar to that of metallic Pt used as a standard, but the white line energy is shifted by +1.5 eV from that of metallic Pt (Figure S4)."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes a two-step method to prepare isolated PtZn sites on a self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite support. HAADF-STEM images show that the SPP morphology was retained after adding Pt, with Pt present as isolated atoms and pairs of atoms. XANES/EXAFS characterization confirms the high dispersion of Pt after H2 reduction.

3. 是的,该文献研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它描述了一种两步法来在自支撑五角柱(SPP)分子筛支撑体上制备隔离的PtZn位点。HAADF-STEM图像显示SPP形态在添加Pt后得以保留,Pt以隔离的原子和原子对的形式存在。 XANES/EXAFS表征确认了H2还原后Pt的高度分散。

5. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) to image Pt/Zn species on a zeolite support. The images show isolated Pt atoms and atom pairs on 2 nm thick zeolite nanosheets.
