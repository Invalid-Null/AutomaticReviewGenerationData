[1] "HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP are presented in Figure 2A,B. The images of 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP shown in Figure 2A,B clearly demonstrate that the card-like morphology of the SPP zeolite was retained after introduction of Pt, as were ca. 2 nm-thick nanosheets comprising the zeolite."

[2] "Figure 2E shows that these aggregates consist of single Pt atoms (marked with red circles) and what appear to be pairs of Pt atoms (marked with yellow circles)." 

[3] "X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) characterization of 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP was done after reducing the sample in flowing H2 at 873 K for 60 min (Figure 3)."

[4] "Analysis of the EXAFS data revealed the presence of a PtZn scattering path, with a PtZn distance of 2.49 ± 0.15 Å, which is similar to that for the PtZn alloy, PtZn clusters, and isolated PtZn complexes."

[5] "Analysis of the EXAFS data collected at 723 K indicates a PtZn coordination number (CN) of 3.5 ± 0.9 (Table 1 and Figure S5). The addition of a PtPt scattering path to the EXAFS model resulted in unrealistic parameters (Figure S6 and Table S3)."

[6] "Therefore, taken together, the XAS data indicate an extremely high dispersion of Pt, consistent with the STEM images shown in Figure 2E,F."

Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to confirm a high dispersion of Pt atoms stabilized by interactions with SiOZn-OH groups.
