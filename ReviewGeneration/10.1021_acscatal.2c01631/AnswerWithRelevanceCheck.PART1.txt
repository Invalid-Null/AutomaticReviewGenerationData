         [1] "HAADF-STEM images of 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP acquired after H2 pretreatment are presented in Figure 2CE. Figure 2C shows a uniform distribution of Pt aggregates with diameters of 12 nm after H2 pretreatment." 

         [2] "Figure 2E shows that these aggregates consist of single Pt atoms (marked with red circles) and what appear to be pairs of Pt atoms (marked with yellow circles)."

         [3] "X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) characterization of 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP was done after reducing the sample in flowing H2 at 873 K for 60 min (Figure 3)."

         Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It uses HAADF-STEM, XANES, and EXAFS to characterize the Pt/Zn-zeolite catalysts and shows that Pt exists as isolated atoms and potentially small clusters after H2 reduction. The mono-metallic Pt sites demonstrate high activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation.

         是的,文章评价了负载的单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它采用HAADF-STEM、XANES和EXAFS等技术表征Pt/Zn-分子筛催化剂,结果显示在H2还原后Pt以孤立原子和潜在的小簇存在。单金属Pt活性位展现出高活性和选择性用于丙烷脱氢。

         [1] "HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP are presented in Figures 2A,B. The images of 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP shown in Figure 2A,B clearly demonstrate that the card-like morphology of the SPP zeolite was retained after introduction of Pt, as were ca. 2 nm-thick nanosheets comprising the zeolite."

         [2] "Figure 2E shows that these aggregates consist of single Pt atoms (marked with red circles) and what appear to be pairs of Pt atoms (marked with yellow circles)."

         [3] "The EXAFS data taken after H2-pretreated 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP had been used for PDH catalysis indicate an increase in the intensity of the feature assigned to PtZn backscattering (Figure 3b)."

      <English>
         Yes, the article investigates how properties like Pt particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported Pt catalysts. It shows using HAADF-STEM that ultra-small Pt species down to single atoms are stabilized on the zeolite support even after pretreatment and reaction. EXAFS data also suggests changes in Pt coordination during reaction, indicating metal-support interactions. The ultra-small Pt species demonstrate high propane dehydrogenation activity.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         是的,文章研究了Pt颗粒大小、形状和与载体相互作用等性质如何影响负载Pt催化剂的性能。HAADF-STEM结果显示超小Pt物种甚至单原子都能在预处理和反应后稳定存在于分子筛载体上。EXAFS数据也显示Pt的配位环境在反应过程中发生变化,说明存在金属-载体相互作用。这些超小Pt物种展现出高丙烷脱氢活性。

         [1] "The catalytic cycle is initiated by propane adsorption (Step 1a) and followed by the dissociation of a CH bond in the methyl group of adsorbed propane (Step 2a), which leads to the formation of a propyl group and a H atom bonded to Pt."

         [2] "The abstraction of a second hydrogen also occurs on the Pt atom (Step 3a), followed by hydrogen desorption (Steps 4a and 5a). Propene desorption (Step 6a) completes the catalytic cycle." 
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic reaction pathway for propane dehydrogenation over the supported Pt catalysts. It describes a 6-step cycle involving propane adsorption, sequential C-H bond activation steps, hydrogen removal, and propene desorption occurring on isolated Pt sites.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         是的,文章提出了负载Pt催化剂上丙烷脱氢的反应机理途径。它描述了一个6步循环,包括丙烷吸附,顺序的C-H键活化步骤,氢原子去除,以及丙烯脱附,都发生在孤立的Pt位点上。
