[1] "Motivated by these findings, we asked whether the activity and stability of such sites could be further enhanced by placing them on the external surface of a zeolite support rather than within zeolite micropores."

[2] "A central conclusion of this work is that the higher stability of the former sites can be attributed to their location on the planar external surfaces of the SPP zeolite support, wherebecause of the lack of mass transport limitationsthe local concentration of the product alkene or dialkene is lower than it would be within the narrow pores of DeAlBEA."

23. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates encapsulating metals in zeolite supports to enhance the stability of propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It compares placing active sites on the external surface of SPP zeolite nanosheets versus within the micropores of dealuminated zeolite beta. The external surface sites showed higher stability, which is attributed to lower local concentrations of alkene products that can lead to coking.

23. 答:是的,这篇文章评估了在沸石支撑体中封装金属以提高丙烷脱氢催化剂的稳定性。它比较了将活性位点放在自支撑五元环沸石纳米片的外表面上与放在去铝β沸石的微孔内。外表面位点显示出更高的稳定性,这归因于较低的烯烃产物的局部浓度,这些产物可能导致焦炭生成。

[1] "Cs-corrected, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron micrographs (HAADF-STEM) of 2.4Zn-SPP are presented in Figure S2A,B." 

[2] "HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared 0.2Pt2.4Zn-SPP, 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP, and 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP are presented in Figures 2 and S2D,E."

[3] "The images of 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP shown in Figure 2A,B clearly demonstrate that the card-like morphology of the SPP zeolite was retained after introduction of Pt, as were ca. 2 nm-thick nanosheets comprising the zeolite."

[4] "Figure 2C shows a uniform distribution of Pt aggregates with diameters of 12 nm after H2 pretreatment." 

[5] "Figure 2E shows that these aggregates consist of single Pt atoms (marked with red circles) and what appear to be pairs of Pt atoms (marked with yellow circles)."

26. Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like HAADF-STEM to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides images showing isolated Pt atoms and small clusters anchored to the SPP zeolite nanosheets after synthesis and after hydrogen pretreatment. The images demonstrate the retention of zeolite morphology after metal addition and provide insights into the dispersion of Pt on the supports.

<Chinese version answer>

26. 答:是的,这篇文章采用了像HAADF-STEM这样的先进显微技术来表征丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-支撑体界面。它提供了在合成后和氢预处理后锚定在SPP沸石纳米片上的孤立Pt原子和小簇的图像。这些图像展示了在添加金属后沸石形态的保持,并提供了Pt在支撑体上分散状况的见解。
