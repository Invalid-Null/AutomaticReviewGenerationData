[1] "Decreasing the size of Pt clusters can be achieved by alloying with, for example, Cu, (28) Zn, (8,10,14,21) Fe, (29) Ga, (30) In, (31) Sn, (1,11,24) Mn, (32) Co, (33) or La. (4)"

[2] "We have recently demonstrated stabilization of Pt predominantly as isolated atoms by interaction with SiOZn-OH nests formed by grafting Zn into silanol nests of dealuminated zeolite β (DeAlBEA). (21)" 

[3] "Characterization of the resulting catalyst (referred to as PtZn-DeAlBEA) showed that, upon activation, Pt is present as structures approximated as (Si-O-Zn)4-6Pt, which are highly active, selective, and stable for PDH."

[4] "A two-step method was used to prepare isolated PtZn sites supported on SPP. First, SiOZn-OH groups were grafted onto the support hydroxyl groups, (40) and these groups were then used to anchor Pt atoms. We designate such catalysts as xPt-yZn-SPP (x and y represent the weight percentages of Pt and Zn, respectively)."

2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Zn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It reports that alloying Pt with Zn helps decrease the size of Pt clusters and stabilize isolated Pt atoms, which improves activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH. Specifically, it shows that (Si-O-Zn)4-6Pt sites supported on dealuminated BEA zeolite and (Si-O-Zn)4-5Pt sites on SPP zeolite nanosheets are highly active and selective PDH catalysts.

[1] "We have recently shown (Qi , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021, 143, 2136421378) that these objectives can be met for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using atomically dispersed Pt anchored to neighboring SiOZn-OH groups bonded to the framework of dealuminated zeolite BEA."

[2] "In the present study, we demonstrate that significantly superior performance can be achieved using self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite nanosheets as supports." 

[3] "Pt was added to 2.4Zn-SPP following the method described in the Experimental Section of the Supporting Information (SI). ICP data showed that all of the Pt was introduced onto the zeolite (Table S1). XRD (Figure S1) and BET measurements (Table S2) confirmed retention of the MFI zeolite framework and the surface area of the support after introduction of Pt."

6. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates MFI and BEA zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows that BEA and SPP (which has an MFI framework) zeolites both provide excellent supports for atomically dispersed Pt-Zn sites that are highly active and selective for PDH. The SiOZn-OH groups on the zeolites help anchor and stabilize the isolated Pt sites.
