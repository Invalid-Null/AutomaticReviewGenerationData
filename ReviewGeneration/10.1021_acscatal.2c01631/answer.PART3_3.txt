[1] "A two-step method was used to prepare isolated PtZn sites supported on SPP. First, SiOZn-OH groups were grafted onto the support hydroxyl groups, and these groups were then used to anchor Pt atoms."

[2] "Characterization of SiOZn-OH on SPP. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure S1) of SPP and 2.4Zn-SPP exhibit peaks at 2θ = 710 and 2225 that are characteristic of MFI zeolite, with no obvious features characteristic of ZnO, suggesting a high dispersion of Zn."

[3] "HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared 0.2Pt2.4Zn-SPP, 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP, and 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP are presented in Figures 2 and S2D,E. The images of 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP shown in Figure 2A,B clearly demonstrate that the card-like morphology of the SPP zeolite was retained after introduction of Pt, as were ca. 2 nm-thick nanosheets comprising the zeolite."

[4] "Characterization of Pt Grafted onto SiOZn-OH Nests. Pt was added to 2.4Zn-SPP following the method described in the Experimental Section of the Supporting Information (SI). ICP data showed that all of the Pt was introduced onto the zeolite (Table S1)."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. The article describes a two-step method to graft isolated PtZn sites onto a self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite support. First, SiOZn-OH groups are grafted onto the zeolite hydroxyl groups. Then Pt atoms are anchored to the SiOZn-OH groups. XRD, STEM imaging, and ICP analysis confirm high dispersion of Zn and Pt on the zeolite support.

3. 是的,该文献研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。该文献描述了一种两步法将隔离的PtZn位点接枝到自支撑五联硅分子筛(SPP)载体上。首先,SiOZn-OH基团接枝到分子筛的羟基上。然后Pt原子锚定在SiOZn-OH基团上。XRD、STEM成像和ICP分析确认Zn和Pt在分子筛载体上的高分散度。

[1] "Cs-corrected, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron micrographs (HAADF-STEM) of 2.4Zn-SPP are presented in Figure S2A,B." 

[2] "HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared 0.2Pt2.4Zn-SPP, 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP, and 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP are presented in Figures 2 and S2D,E. The images of 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP shown in Figure 2A,B clearly demonstrate that the card-like morphology of the SPP zeolite was retained after introduction of Pt, as were ca. 2 nm-thick nanosheets comprising the zeolite."

[3] "Figure 2C shows a uniform distribution of Pt aggregates with diameters of 12 nm after H2 pretreatment. As presented in Figure S3, the card-like morphology of SPP zeolite was well retained after PDH catalysis (details of the catalysis experiments are presented below). EDS images of Pt and Zn acquired from these areas show that the Pt and Zn species were present in the same areas and almost uniformly distributed within them."

5. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Aberration-corrected STEM is used to image the SPP zeolite before and after incorporation of Zn and Pt. The images show retention of the zeolite morphology and uniform dispersion of Pt aggregates under 2 nm after pretreatment. EDS mapping confirms co-localization of Pt and Zn species.
