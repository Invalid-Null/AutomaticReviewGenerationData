[1] "Motivated by these findings, we asked whether the activity and stability of such sites could be further enhanced by placing them on the external surface of a zeolite support rather than within zeolite micropores."

[2] "Characterization of the resulting catalyst (referred to as PtZn-DeAlBEA) showed that, upon activation, Pt is present as structures approximated as (Si-O-Zn)4-6Pt, which are highly active, selective, and stable for PDH."

[3] "The EXAFS data revealed the presence of a PtZn scattering path, with a PtZn distance of 2.49 ± 0.15 Å, which is similar to that for the PtZn alloy, PtZn clusters, and isolated PtZn complexes."

[4] "Analysis of the EXAFS data collected at 723 K indicates a PtZn coordination number (CN) of 3.5 ± 0.9." 

[5] "The results suggest that new PtZn bonds might have formed during PDH, perhaps by restructuring of the PtZn species resulting from migration of the Zn and/or Pt atoms at high temperatures of catalysis."

[6] "The formation of isolated structures approximated, on average, as PtZn4-5 during PDH is attributed to the higher strength of PtZn (0.49 eV) than that of PtPt bonds (0.46 eV)."

2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Zn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that PtZn sites anchored on zeolites are highly active, selective and stable for propane dehydrogenation. EXAFS data indicates Pt is present as PtZn4-5 sites, with Pt-Zn coordination numbers around 3-5 and Pt-Zn distances around 2.49 Å, similar to PtZn alloys and clusters. During reaction, new Pt-Zn bonds may form, stabilizing the active PtZn4-5 sites. This is attributed to the higher bond strength of Pt-Zn versus Pt-Pt bonds.

2. 答:是的,文章评估了Pt-Zn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它表明锚定在沸石上的PtZn活性位点对于丙烷脱氢反应具有高活性、高选择性和高稳定性。EXAFS数据表明Pt存在于PtZn4-5位点,Pt-Zn配位数约为3-5,Pt-Zn距离约为2.49 Å,类似于PtZn合金和簇。在反应过程中,可能形成新的Pt-Zn键,稳定了活性的PtZn4-5位点。这归因于Pt-Zn键的键能高于Pt-Pt键能。

[1] "We have recently shown (Qi , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021, 143, 21364–21378) that these objectives can be met for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using atomically dispersed Pt anchored to neighboring SiOZn-OH groups bonded to the framework of dealuminated zeolite BEA." 

[2] "In the present study, we demonstrate that significantly superior performance can be achieved using self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite nanosheets as supports."

[3] "This material comprises nanosheets approximately 2 nm thick that contain a network of ca. 0.5 nm intra-zeolite micropores. Moreover, the house-of-cards arrangement of the nanosheets creates a network of mesopores with diameters of 2–7 nm."

[4] "A further reason for selecting SPP zeolite is that it has a high concentration of hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) silanol groups that are distributed mainly on the external surfaces of the nanosheets."

[5] "We have shown that Pt atoms can be dispersed by reaction with clusters of SiOZn-OH groups grafted onto the surfaces of self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite nanosheets."

6. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates MFI and BEA zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows superior performance is achieved using self-pillared pentasil (MFI) zeolite nanosheets versus dealuminated BEA zeolite. The 2 nm thick MFI sheets with 0.5 nm micropores and 2-7 nm mesopores provide high concentration of silanol groups on the external surface to disperse and stabilize PtZn sites. This gives better activity, selectivity and stability than PtZn sites within the micropores of BEA.

6. 答:是的,文章评估了MFI和BEA沸石支持的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它显示自支撑的五角柱(MFI)沸石纳米片优于除铝BEA沸石。2纳米厚的MFI片,具有0.5纳米微孔和2-7纳米介孔,在外表面提供了高浓度硅醇基团来分散和稳定PtZn位点。这比BEA微孔内的PtZn位点提供了更好的活性、选择性和稳定性。

7. Answer: No, the article does not investigate effects of tuning zeolite Si/Al ratio or incorporating mesoporosity on propane dehydrogenation catalyst performance. It focuses on comparing MFI and BEA zeolite supports but does not vary Si/Al ratio or mesoporosity.
