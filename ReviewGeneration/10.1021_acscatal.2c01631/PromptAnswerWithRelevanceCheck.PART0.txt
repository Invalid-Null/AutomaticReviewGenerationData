1. The article provides background on the importance of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation in the chemical industry. It states that propylene is an important basic building-block chemical, used to produce polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylic acid, and acrylonitrile. 

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

1. 该文提供了丙烷脱氢制备丙烯在化工行业重要性的背景信息。它指出丙烯是一种重要的基础化学建材,可用于生产聚丙烯、丙烯醚、丙烯酸和丙烯腈。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "Because dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) and n-butane (BDH) are endergonic reactions, high temperatures (>773 K) are required for significant product yields;"

[2] "Pt exhibits high activity for CH bond activation and a relatively low activity for undesired CC bond cleavage."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the activation energy barriers. Specifically, it states that because propane dehydrogenation is an endergonic reaction, high temperatures are required to achieve significant yields. Platinum catalysts are useful because platinum has high activity for C-H bond activation but relatively low activity for undesired C-C bond cleavage.

</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>

2. 该文解释了催化剂通过降低活化能垒来促进丙烷脱氢。具体来说,它指出因为丙烷脱氢是吸热反应,需要高温才能达到显著的产率。铂催化剂有效是因为铂对C-H键活化有高活性,但对不desired C-C键裂解的活性相对较低。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "Thermal catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butane are attractive routes for the production of propene and 1,3-butadiene." 

[2] "Investigations of PDH on Pt-containing catalysts (15,17,18,2427) have shown that as the Pt nanocluster diameter decreases below about 2 nm, the PDH activity, propene selectivity, and resistance to coke formation increase."

[3] "Decreasing the size of Pt clusters can be achieved by alloying with, for example, Cu, (28) Zn, (8,10,14,21) Fe, (29) Ga, (30) In, (31) Sn, (1,11,24) Mn, (32) Co, (33) or La." 

[4] "Another promising approach to achieving highly active, selective, and stable Pt catalysts is to synthesize isolated Pt atoms stabilized by interactions with nonprecious metals that are chemically bonded to the support."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. The article introduces several major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation, including supported metals, alloys, and zeolites. It states that thermal catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butane using platinum catalysts are attractive routes to produce propylene and 1,3-butadiene. Studies have shown that decreasing the size of Pt nanoclusters below 2 nm increases activity, selectivity, and coke resistance. Alloying Pt with metals like Zn, Sn, Ga, etc. is one way to achieve small Pt cluster sizes. Stabilizing isolated Pt atoms on supports using nonprecious metals is another promising approach.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

3. 该文介绍了几类用于丙烷脱氢的主要催化剂,包括负载金属、合金和分子筛。它指出,使用铂催化剂的丙烷和丁烷的热催化脱氢是生产丙烯和1,3-丁二烯的有效途径。研究表明,将Pt纳米簇大小降低到2 nm以下可以提高活性、选择性和抗焦炭形成性。使用Zn、Sn、Ga等金属合金化Pt是实现小Pt簇尺寸的一种方式。使用非贵金属在载体上稳定隔离Pt原子是另一种有前景的方法。

[1] "Because dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) and n-butane (BDH) are endergonic reactions, high temperatures (>773 K) are required for significant product yields;"

[2] "However, at these temperatures, rapid catalyst deactivation results from coke generation and Pt sintering."

</quotes>

<English version answer> 

4. The article discusses the thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. It states that because propane dehydrogenation is an endergonic reaction, high temperatures above 773 K are required to achieve significant yields. However, at such high temperatures, rapid catalyst deactivation occurs due to coke formation and Pt sintering.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

4. 该文讨论了丙烷脱氢中涉及的热力学约束和动力学因素。它指出,由于丙烷脱氢是吸热反应,需要773 K以上的高温才能达到显著的产率。然而,在如此高的温度下,由于焦炭生成和铂烧结,催化剂会快速失活。
