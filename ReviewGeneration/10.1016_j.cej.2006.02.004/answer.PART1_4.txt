<quotes>
[1] "Pt-based catalysts supported on alumina are active for naphtha reforming and for dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight paraffins [1], [2], [3]."

[2] "Catalysts were prepared by using a commercial γ-Al2O3 (CK 300 from Cyanamid Ketjen) previously calcined in flowing air at 923 K during 3 h. The alumina samples doped with Na in different concentrations (0.05, 0.15 and 0.25 wt.%) were obtained by impregnating the support with aqueous solution of NaOH. Pt (0.3%)/Al2O3Na catalysts with different Na contents were prepared by successive impregnation: first Pt was deposited from an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (0.011 M)."  

[3] "The different catalysts (Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3Na) were tested in the n-butane dehydrogenation in a continuous flow reactor."
