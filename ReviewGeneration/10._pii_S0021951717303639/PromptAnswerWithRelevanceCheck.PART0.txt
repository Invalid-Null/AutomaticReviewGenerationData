<Answer>
 Unfortunately the given literature does not provide sufficient information to directly answer the specific questions asked. The article focuses on evaluating the catalytic performance of chromium-zirconium oxide materials for propane dehydrogenation, and does not extensively discuss many of the broader topics raised in the questions, such as propylene applications, computational studies of mechanisms, or quantitative structure-activity relationships. The article introduces the catalyst types studied but does not go into depth on other major catalyst classes explored in the field. Some limited background is provided but overall the focus is on presenting the authors' experimental results rather than comprehensively reviewing the wider propane dehydrogenation literature. While an interesting read on a specific set of catalysts, the narrow scope of the work means it cannot adequately address the broad questions posed. I have provided brief answers below indicating when questions are not addressed, but suggest referring to other reviews or overview articles in this field to find more details on the topics of interest.

[1] It [chromium-based catalysts] easily reduce to the active mononuclear Cr3+ species under reducing conditions.  

[2]  The higher the concentration of such species [Cr6+] in mixed Cr2O3ZrO2 oxide catalysts is the key factor determining their high activity.

[3]  Their high activity [of CrZrOx] was partially related to the presence of surface coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus), which are responsible for alkane activation.

<English version answer>
2. The article explains that catalysts like chromium oxides and zirconium oxides facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing active sites that can activate the C-H bonds. Specifically, it mentions that Cr3+ species and coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ sites are active in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

 Unfortunately the given literature does not provide sufficient information to answer any of the questions in detail. The article focuses on investigating chromium-zirconia based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide extensive background on propylene production, mechanisms of catalyst activity, major catalyst classes explored, thermodynamic and kinetic factors, use of computational modeling, or structure-activity relationships. The questions seem more broad than the scope of the given literature.
