Abstract
Bulk CrZrOx, supported CrOx/LaZrOx, and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared with Cr surface site density varying between 0.04 and 2.3nm2. They were characterized by BET, XRD, temperature-programmed reduction with H2, and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption. Their activity, selectivity, and durability in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) were determined under industrially relevant conditions. The catalysts on the basis of ZrO2 outperform their Al2O3-based counterparts in terms of PDH activity. This was explained by the presence of two catalytically active sites, i.e. CrOx and coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ (Zrcus) sites. The former species promote formation of Zrcus under reaction conditions or upon reductive catalyst treatment.
Practical relevance of CrZrOx and CrOx/LaZrOx catalysts was checked in a series of 10 PDH/regeneration cycles performed at 550C. The catalysts possessing up to 40 times lower chromium content performed superior to an analogue of commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3 with respect to space time yield of propene and the amount of propene formed within one PDH cycle. In terms of durability, bulk promoting of ZrO2 with Cr was found to be advantageous over simple deposition of CrOx on the surface of LaZrOx.

1. Introduction
Since the 1930s, chromium-based catalysts have been used for large-scale non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes [1]. The industrial Al2O3-supported catalysts contain between 10 and 20wt.% of chromium oxide and about 2wt.% of potassium as a promoter [2], [3], [4]. A lot of research work has been performed to understand the nature of active sites and factors influencing catalytic performance [3], [5], [6], [7]. Nowadays, it is generally accepted that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ sites are catalytically active in alkane dehydrogenation [7], [8]. Neighboring O2 ions are involved in the reaction as well [9]. The presence of an alkali promoter influences both activity and selectivity of the catalysts. On the one hand, the promoter increases dispersion of active sites by provoking formation of Cr6+Ox under oxidizing conditions with the latter being transformed into highly dispersed catalytically active Cr3+Ox under reducing conditions. On the other hand, potassium reduces surface acidity of alumina and thus suppresses undesired reactions such as coke formation and cracking [7]. Although alumina is a primary support for chromium-based catalysts, other materials such as SiO2, SiO2-Al2O3, SiO2-ZrO2, and ZrO2 were also investigated. They are considered to be suitable or even better candidates because they possess lower surface acidity [2], [10], [11], [12], [13]. It should be noted that the dehydrogenation activity of ZrO2-supported chromium catalysts is higher than those of Al2O3 or SiO2-supported ones [10]. This was explained by stabilization of highly dispersed CrOx species on the surface of ZrO2 [10], [11]. For example, Rossi et al. [10] found that freshly prepared zirconia-based materials contain higher concentration of mononuclear Cr5+ species in comparison with their counterparts on the basis of γ-Al2O3 or SiO2. Such Cr species are easily reduced to the active mononuclear Cr3+ species under reaction conditions.
In comparison with supported catalysts, studies on alkane dehydrogenation with bulk binary CrZrOx catalysts are rather scarce. Wu et al. used mixed Cr2O3ZrO2 oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 [14]. Those authors determined that calcined catalysts possessed high amount of Cr6+ species positively influencing catalyst activity. Thus, it was concluded that the presence of such species in mixed Cr2O3ZrO2 oxide catalysts is the key factor determining their high activity. The role of ZrO2 was not discussed.
In our recent short communication, bulk binary CrZrOx catalysts were reported to be active for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutylene [15]. Their high activity was partially related to the presence of surface coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus), which are responsible for alkane activation [15], [16], [17], [18]. The objective of the present study was to investigate if there is a synergy effect between two types (Cr and Zr) of active sites in bulk binary CrZrOx or supported CrOx/LaZrOx catalysts in terms of their activity in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Other important questions were as follows. Does product selectivity depend on the type of catalyst (bulk vs. supported)? How and whether does the kind of catalytically active species affect catalyst on-stream stability within one PDH cycle and durability over several cycles of PDH and oxidative catalyst regeneration? How do ZrO2-based catalysts perform in comparison with an industrial analogue K-CrOx/Al2O3? To this end, XRD, NH3-TPD and H2-TPR were used to characterize phase composition, acidic and redox properties of both bulk and supported catalysts as a function of Cr content. Catalytic tests were instrumental in determining the rate of propene formation, catalyst on-stream performance and durability at industrially relevant degrees of propane conversion and establishing primary and secondary reaction pathways in the course of PDH.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalyst preparation
ZrOCl2·8H2O (>95%, Fluka), Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (99%, Aldrich), NH3 (25% aqueous solution, Roth), KOH (Merck), CrO3 (99.9%, Sigma Aldrich), LaZrOx (ZrO2 doped with 10wt.% La2O3, MelChemicals), Al2O3 (Chempur, basic), and Al2O3 (Saint-Gobain NorPro) were used as starting materials. Bare ZrO2 was prepared according to the below protocol. Required amount of ZrOCl2·8H2O was dissolved in deionized water to obtain solution with Zr4+ concentration of 1.0M. An aqueous solution of ammonia was then added dropwise under stirring until pH value of 9 was reached. The precipitate formed was aged overnight, filtered, and washed several times with deionized water until chloride ions were not identified in filtrate (reaction with AgNO3). The solid was dried at 110C overnight and calcined at 550C for 4h. Binary CrZrOx materials with different Zr to Cr ratio were prepared in a similar way with an exception that required amounts of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O were initially dissolved in deionized water to obtain solution with a total concentration of Zr4+ and Cr3+ of 1.0M. The samples were denoted as Cr0.5Zr99.5Ox, Cr2Zr98Ox, Cr5Zr95Ox and Cr10Zr90Ox with the numbers standing for molar fraction of each metal.
Supported CrOx/LaZrOx and CrOx/Al2O3 (Al2O3 was provided by Chempur) catalysts were prepared by simple impregnation of the support with a required amount of an aqueous solution of chromium nitrate to yield desired concentration of Cr2O3 in the resulting catalyst precursors. They were dried at 110C overnight and calcined at 550C for 4h. The final catalysts are abbreviated as 0.05CrOx/LaZrOx, 0.15CrOx/LaZrOx, 0.5CrOx/LaZrOx, 1.5CrOx/LaZrOx, 3.2CrOx/LaZrOx, 0.08CrOx/Al2O3, 0.8CrOx/Al2O3, and 5.1CrOx/Al2O3 with the numbers standing for weight percentage (wt.%) of Cr2O3.
An analogue of industrial K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared according to the protocol described in a patent of SdChemie [19]. Briefly, two aqueous solutions with the required amounts of CrO3 and KOH were separately prepared and then mixed together. Hereafter, Al2O3 (Al2O3 was provided by Saint-Gobain NorPro) was impregnated with the resulting solution. The catalyst precursor was dried at 120C overnight and calcined at 760C for 4h. The nominal concentration of Cr2O3 and K2O in the resulting catalyst was 19.7wt.% and 0.93wt.% respectively.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Nitrogen physisorption experiments at 77K were carried out using a Belsorp mini II setup (Bel Japan) to determine specific surface areas (SBET) of the samples. Desorption isotherms were evaluated according to the BET method.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Theta/Theta diffractometer XPert Pro (Panalytical) with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418Å, 40kV, 40mA) and an XCelerator RTMS detector. Phase composition of the samples was identified using the program suite WinXPOW (Stoe & Cie) with inclusion of the powder diffraction file PDF2 of the international center for diffraction data.
To quantify acidic sites, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) tests were carried out in a set-up containing eight individually heated continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactors. Before ammonia adsorption at 120C, the catalysts (50mg for each sample) were calcined in air at 550C for 1h, purged with Ar for 15min and then reduced in a flow of H2 (57vol.% in Ar) Ar at 550C for 1h. Hereafter, they were cooled to 120C in a flow of Ar. So treated catalysts were exposed to a flow of ammonia (1vol.% NH3 in Ar) at 120C for 1h, then purged with Ar flow for 5h to remove weakly bound NH3, cooled to 80C, and finally heated up to 900C with a heating rate of 10K·min1 in Ar flow. An on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320) was used for quantifying desorbed ammonia. Signals at atomic mass units of 15 (NH3) and 40 (Ar) were recorded in these tests.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out in the same set-up as for NH3-TPD tests. The samples (200mg for each sample) were heated in a flow of 5vol.% H2 in Ar (10ml·min1) up to 900C with a heating rate of 10K·min1. The H2 consumption was quantified with an on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320). Signals at atomic mass units of 2 (H2) and 40 (Ar) were recorded in these tests. Prior to the experiment, all samples were in situ calcined in air flow at 550C for 1h.
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments were carried out by heating the spent catalysts (after the 10th cycle of a long-term stability test described in section 2.3) in a flow of 5vol.% O2 in Ar (10ml·min1) up to 900C with a heating rate of 10K·min1. The release of CO2 and CO was detected using the above-mentioned on-line mass spectrometer. Signals at atomic mass units of 44 (CO2), 28 (CO, CO2) and 40 (Ar) were recorded in these tests.
2.3. Catalytic tests
Catalytic tests were performed at 1bar in an in-house developed setup consisting of 15 continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactors. To determine the rate of propene formation, the tests were carried out at a degree of propane conversion below 10%. In this case, coke formation is insignificant and the catalytic reactor can be considered as differential. Before the tests, the catalysts were initially heated in an N2 flow up to 550C and then calcined in an air flow at the same temperature for 1h. Then, they were purged with N2 for 15min, treated with H2 (57vol.% H2 in N2) for 1h and purged again with N2 for 15min. Finally, the catalysts were exposed to a flow of C3H8-N2 mixture (40vol.% C3H8). The initial rate of propene formation was measured after 190s on stream.
To determine the dependence of product selectivity on propane conversion, we performed catalytic tests at 550C with the catalysts reduced in a flow of H2 (57vol.% H2 in N2) for 1h at 550C. Both, total flow (10, 20, 40 and 60mL·min1) of the reaction feed and catalyst amount (0.011.2g) were varied to achieve different contact times and accordingly different degrees of propane conversion.
Long-term stability tests were performed at 550C with a C3H8/N2=40/60 feed with a total flow of 10ml·min1. Catalyst amount was varied to achieve an initial propane conversion of 30% over all Cr-containing samples. Due to experimental restrictions, it was not possible to reach such degree over ZrO2. The highest conversion over the latter catalyst was 20%. One PDH cycle lasted for 50min. Catalyst regeneration stage consisted of an oxidative treatment in a flow of air at 550C for 30min followed by reduction in a flow of 57vol.% H2 in N2 for 1h. All steps (PDH, reoxidation, reduction) were always separated by a flushing with N2 flow lasting for 15min. Each catalyst was tested over 10 PDH/regeneration cycles.
The feed components and the reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890) equipped with PLOT/Q (for CO2), AL/S (for hydrocarbons), and Molsieve 5 (for H2, O2, N2, and CO) columns as well as with flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors.
Eqs. (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) were used to calculate the rate of propene formation (r(C3H6)), mol(C3H6)·gcat1·min1), apparent TOF with respect to one surface chromium atom (s1), propane conversion (X(C3H8)), selectivity to gas-phase products (Si) and coke (S(coke)), and STY (kg(C3H6)·h1·m3) respectively:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic materials and their general characterization
The samples studied in the current work can be divided into two groups: (i) bulk ZrO2 and CrZrOx catalysts (Cr0.5Zr99.5Ox, Cr2Zr98Ox, Cr5Zr95Ox, and Cr10Zr90Ox) as well as (ii) supported catalysts (0.05CrOx/LaZrOx, 0.15CrOx/LaZrOx, 0.5CrOx/LaZrOx, 1.5CrOx/LaZrOx, 3.2CrOx/LaZrOx, 0.08CrOx/Al2O3, 0.8CrOx/Al2O3, 5.1CrOx/Al2O3, and K-CrOx/Al2O3). The nominal weight percentage of Cr2O3 in the catalysts (Table 1) was calculated under the assumption that all chromium which is present in the samples would exist as Cr2O3 after reductive treatment. The specific surface area (SBET) of freshly prepared samples is shown in Table 1. For the bulk catalysts, an increase in Cr content resulted in an augmentation of the SBET values which reached the highest value of 135.5m2·g1 for Cr10Zr90Ox. The surface area of supported CrOx/LaZrOx was only slightly lower than this value but higher than that of other bulk catalysts. It is due to the fact that we used commercial non-calcined LaZrOx possessing SBET of 309.6m2·g1 for preparation of these catalysts. Owing to the effect of dopant on the transformation of ZrO2 into metastable tetragonal and/or cubic, LaZrOx has higher surface area than undoped ZrO2 even after high temperature treatment [20]. Therefore, the usage of LaZrOx as a support might ensure formation of well-distributed highly dispersed species of chromium oxide [21].

Interestingly, bare LaZrOx calcined at the same temperature as supported samples (550C for 4h) had lower SBET (only 84.2m2·g1) than CrOx/LaZrOx. The higher surface area of Cr-containing samples can be explained by the stabilizing function of chromium as reported in previous studies [21], [22]. The presence of chromium prevents sintering of the support crystallites during calcination and therefore retards any decrease in surface area. The supported CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts possessed the highest surface area among all samples investigated due to the high surface area of the support (SBET(Al2O3) = 199.7m2·g1).
XRD patterns of bulk CrZrOx, supported CrOx/LaZrOx, and CrOx/Al2O3 are presented in Fig. 1. Both monoclinic (m-ZrO2) and tetragonal (t-ZrO2) phases were identified in the bulk samples with a Cr loading below 10mol.% (Fig. 1(a)). However, increasing chromium content resulted in an increase in the fraction of t-ZrO2, with the latter being the only XRD visible phase in Cr10Zr90Ox. No diffraction peaks related to separate CrOx-based phase(-s) were found in all bulk samples. The above XRD results indirectly confirm incorporation of chromium ions into zirconia lattice with the formation of binary solution. XRD patterns of CrOx/LaZrOx samples are given in Fig. 1(b). Independently of the amount of chromium, the diffractograms of all samples possess only reflexes characteristic of t-ZrO2 which is the only phase in LaZrOx. The absence of the reflexes corresponding to CrOx phase(-s) is probably due to the low quantity of chromium oxide and/or its high dispersion on the support [23]. Similarly, the patterns of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts do not contain any reflexes related to CrOx phase(-s) but only possess diffraction peaks characteristic of γ-Al2O3 (Fig. 1(c)).

We used XPS analysis to check if chromium in CrZrOx is homogeneously distributed in the lattice of ZrO2. Chromium and zirconium in oxidized samples were stabilized in their highest oxidation state (Fig. S1 in the supporting information (SI)). The determined atomic ratio of Zr/Cr in the near-surface region was 11 and 17 for Cr10Zr90Ox and Cr5Zr95Ox respectively. These values are close to the corresponding nominal values (9 and 19 respectively). In addition, surface Cr concentration did not increase after catalyst treatment at 750C in a H2-containing flow [15]. Thus, any enrichment of Cr at the surface upon reductive catalyst treatment can also be excluded. The concentration of chromium on the surface of Cr2Zr98Ox and Cr0.5Zr99.5Ox was too low to be determined precisely. Nevertheless, the XPS results exclude any enrichment of Cr at the surface and indicate that Cr is incorporated into the ZrO2 structure. Surface chromium content (N(Crsurf)) for bulk catalysts was calculated under assumption that the (101) face is the most common plane in t-ZrO2 [24]. Based on this knowledge, about 8.6 surface atoms of Zr are located in one square nanometer of ZrO2. Assuming that some surface Zr atoms in binary CrZrOx are substituted with Cr atoms in accordance with a nominal Zr/Cr ratio, we calculated a nominal surface concentration of Cr atoms (see N(Crsurf) in Table 1). Although the samples Cr0.5Zr99.5Ox, Cr2Zr98Ox, Cr5Zr95Ox contain both, m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2, our calculation should be also valid for these catalysts since the most stable (111) and (
) surfaces of m-ZrO2 contain about 8.1 and 9.0 surface atoms of Zr in one square nanometer respectively [25], [26], which are close to the corresponding number for t-ZrO2.
3.2. Redox and acidic properties
Fig. 2 shows profiles of hydrogen consumption determined from H2-TPR tests. We shall start with the discussion of bulk materials. The temperature (Tmax) of maximal consumption of hydrogen for each catalyst is listed in Table 1. Bare zirconia demonstrated only small hydrogen uptake above 620C. It can be ascribed to hydrogen reaction with lattice oxygen of zirconia [27]. For the samples Cr0.5Zr99.5Ox, Cr2Zr98Ox, and Cr5Zr95Ox, three resolved signals of hydrogen consumption between 320340C, 365375C and 450470C were identified. The first two peaks are not well resolved for Cr10Zr90Ox. Since the intensity of the first and second peaks increases with chromium content, they should be related to reduction of Cr6+. The intensity of the third weak peak of hydrogen consumption between 450470C only slightly increases with chromium content, while the position of the peak is shifted to lower temperatures. Hence, the third peak can be attributed to hydrogen reaction with surface lattice oxygen of zirconia. In comparison with bare ZrO2, this reaction on the binary materials occurs at lower temperatures due to the following reason. Reduced chromium species can activate gas-phase H2 to yield adsorbed atomic hydrogen species. Owing to their higher reactivity in comparison with H2, they promote removal of lattice oxygen from zirconia [28]. This statement is indirectly supported by the fact that the Tmax value for H2 consumption between 450 and 470C becomes lower with rising chromium content in the binary materials.

Fig. 2. H2-TPR profiles of (a) binary CrZrOx, (b) supported CrOx/LaZrOx, and (c) supported CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts.
The H2-TPR profiles of supported CrOx/LaZrOx catalysts, with an exception of 0.05CrOx/LaZrOx shown no resolved peak due to the low chromium content, are characterized by one peak of hydrogen consumption at about 400425C. It can be ascribed to reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+. No evident dependence of the position of Tmax on the amount of chromium could be found. However, in comparison with bulk CrZrOx materials, the position of Tmax is shifted to higher temperatures. This result suggests that redox properties of chromium species are affected by the type how chromium cations are connected with ZrO2, i.e. supported CrOx vs. Cr located in cation positions inside the lattice of ZrO2.
The H2-TPR profiles of supported CrOx/Al2O3 samples (except 0.08CrOx/Al2O3) are similar to those of CrOx/LaZrOx and also characterized by one peak of hydrogen consumption between 400 and 425C related to the single-stage reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ [29]. The sample 0.08CrOx/Al2O3 possessed too low chromium amount and did not show detectable hydrogen uptake.
NH3-TPD experiments were carried out with the purpose to investigate whether and how catalyst surface acidity depends on CrOx presence and its location in ZrO2, i.e. supported CrOx vs. Cr incorporated into the lattice of ZrO2. Fig. 3 shows the obtained NH3-desorption curves for binary CrZrOx materials, selected CrOx/LaZrOx samples, and an analogue of industrial K-CrOx/Al2O3. For all ZrO2-based catalysts, NH3 desorption was observed in a broad temperature range between 170 and 600C. The shape of profiles is complex and asymmetric and suggests the presence of different acidic sites. To derive an insight into the distribution of such sites, we fitted NH3-TPD profiles using several Gaussian functions as practiced in several previous studies [30], [31]. Three different acidic sites characterized by NH3 desorption maxima at 202231C, 235304C and 317403C could be identified for all ZrO2-based materials (Fig. 3). The NH3-TPD profile of K-CrOx/Al2O3 was described by two desorption peaks at approximately 240 and 360C. The temperature of maximum and the fraction of each desorption peak for all samples are listed in Table 2. This table also contains an overall density of acidic sites, which was calculated under assumption that one molecule of ammonia is adsorbed on one acidic site. The catalyst K-CrOx/Al2O3 possessed the lowest total density of acidic sites probably due to the presence of potassium, which is known to diminish catalyst acidity [7]. Bare ZrO2 had the highest density of acidic sites and large fraction of strong acidic sites characterized by ammonia desorption at 401C (the third maximum in NH3-TPD profile in Fig. 3, Table 2). The overall density of acidic sites decreased with increasing chromium content both in bulk CrZrOx and supported CrOx/LaZrOx samples. In addition, the fraction of the third NH3-desorption peak became smaller.

3.3. Catalyst activity and the kind of active sites
Table 1 lists the initial rate of propene formation determined over bulk and supported catalysts at 550C and a degree of propane conversion below 10%. All catalysts were reductively (57vol.% H2 in N2) treated at 550C for 1h before starting the dehydrogenation reaction. It is obvious that promoting of ZrO2 with only 0.5mol.% Cr (sample Cr0.5Zr99.5Ox) resulted in an increase in the activity by a factor of larger than 5 in comparison with the activity of bare ZrO2. The activity gradually increased with rising chromium content. The highest rate of propene formation was achieved over Cr10Zr90Ox. This catalyst performed significantly superior to K-CrOx/Al2O3. It is also worth mentioning that the activity of Cr2Zr98Ox is almost close to that of reference K-CrOx/Al2O3, despite of the fact that the binary material possesses about 1/16 of chromium content. In general, similarly loaded supported catalysts on the basis of LaZrOx showed higher activity than their bulk counterparts, while CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts were less active. It should, however, be mentioned that surface concentration of chromium in the binary CrZrOx catalysts is significantly lower.
To check if Cr sites are the only active species, we calculated TOF values related to surface Cr atoms. Their concentration in the binary CrZrOx materials was calculated on the basis of XPS data and provided in Table 1. For CrOx/LaZrOx and CrOx/Al2O3, we used an overall concentration of chromium. Such approach cannot be applied for K-CrOx/Al2O3 because this material contains 19.7wt.% of Cr2O3. At such high concentration chromium oxide forms amorphous and crystalline Cr2O3 clusters of different size rather than isolated species [3].
The obtained TOF values are presented in Fig. 4 as a function of apparent surface density of chromium. The values for Al2O3-supported catalysts did not depend on chromium loading thus suggesting that Cr is the only catalytically active species. In contrast to these materials, the TOF values for CrZrOx and CrOx/LaZrOx catalysts decrease with an increase in surface density of chromium. Therefore, Cr should not be the only active species. On the basis of our previous studies with Cr-free ZrO2-based catalysts [16], [17], [18], we put forward that coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus) cations in CrZrOx and CrOx/LaZrOx catalysts also participate in propane dehydrogenation. Such sites are formed through removal of surface lattice oxygen of ZrO2 upon reductive catalyst treatment and/or in situ under reaction conditions. Actually, our H2-TPR results indicate that the latter process occurred when the CrZrOx catalysts were treated in hydrogen (Fig. 2). In addition, XPS analysis proved that surface Cr concentration in the reduced catalyst did not increase after such treatment but the state of Zr4+ changed significantly due to the formation of Zr suboxides with an O/Zr ratio lower than 2 [15].

Under the above considerations, we now analyze if there is a synergy effect between Zrcus and Cr sites in terms of overall catalyst activity when they coexist together. To this end, we compare the rate of propane formation over ZrO2 or LaZrOx (Zrcus is the only active species), CrOx/Al2O3 (Cr sites should be the only active sites), CrZrOx and CrOx/LaZrOx with a similar surface density of Cr. From the data shown in Table 1, it is obvious that the rate measured over the two latter catalysts is significantly higher than the sum of the rates over CrOx/Al2O3 and ZrO2 or LaZrOx. For example, the rate over Cr5Zr95Ox and 0.5Cr2O3/LaZrOx with the both possessing about 0.30.4 Cr·nm2 was 1.82 and 1.22mmol(C3H6)·g1·min1 respectively. The corresponding values for ZrO2, LaZrOx and 0.8Cr2O3/Al2O3 (Cr surface density is about 0.4 Cr·nm2) were 0.06, 0.16 and 0.07mmol(C3H6)·g1·min1 respectively. The above results can be understood when assuming that Cr and Zrcus affect their intrinsic activity or higher concentration of Zrcus can be formed in CrZrOx or CrOx/LaZrOx in comparison with ZrO2 or LaZrOx.
3.4. Dependence of product selectivity on propane conversion
For identifying primary and secondary reaction pathways in the course of propane dehydrogenation, we performed catalytic tests at different degrees of propane conversion as suggested in [32] for heterogeneous reactions. The obtained dependences of selectivity to C3H6, cracking products (CH4, C2H6 and C2H4), and coke on propane conversion are shown in Fig. 5. For all catalysts, the selectivity to propene dropped with increasing conversion thus implying the presence of a sequential stage involving propene. For all catalysts with exception of ZrO2, extrapolation to zero conversion degree gives near to 100% propene selectivity. This means that propene is the only product formed directly from propane over all Cr-containing catalysts including the industrial analogue. For ZrO2, such extrapolation gives a value of propene selectivity of about 80%. In other words, not only propene but also other side products should be formed directly from propane.

All catalysts were reductively (57vol.% H2 in N2) treated at 550C for 1h before starting the dehydrogenation reaction.
Selectivity curves for cracking products look similar for all samples, i.e. the selectivity starts from zero at zero propane conversion and rises with increasing conversion. Such behavior is possible when cracking occurs as a sequential stage involving propene. Coke selectivity for all samples excepting ZrO2 also rises starting from zero. Coke selectivity over ZrO2 starts from about 20% and further increases with propane conversion, i.e. coke can be formed directly from propane (parallel stage) as well as from propene (sequential stage). Based on the above discussion, we suggest two reaction networks of propane dehydrogenation over Cr-containing catalysts (Fig. 6(a)) and over ZrO2 (Fig. 6(b)). The difference between these catalyst groups can be due to different surface acidity of the samples. In comparison to all Cr-containing catalysts, bare ZrO2 possesses higher total density of acidic sites and larger concentration of strong acidic sites, which are characterized by a maximum of NH3 adsorption at 401C (Fig. 3 and Table 2). The stronger the acidity, the longer should be the lifetime of intermediates formed from propane and/or propene on the surface of catalysts. As a consequence, such intermediates interact with each other to yield finally carbon deposits.

3.5. Catalyst on-stream stability and durability
For proper comparison of Cr-containing catalysts in terms of deactivation and durability, catalytic tests were carried out starting at an initial propane conversion of about 30%. To reach such conversion degree over catalysts strongly differing in their activity (Table 1), we modified contact time. To this end, catalyst amount was varied, while the total feed flow was fixed to 10ml·min1. The amount used for each individual catalyst is reported in Table S1 in SI. Due to the low activity of ZrO2 and technical limitations of our set-up, it was possible to achieve the highest conversion of only 20%. Fig. 7(a) shows temporal changes in propane conversion within first dehydrogenation cycle. Sample K-CrOx/Al2O3 seems to be the most stable among all Cr-containing catalysts. It lost about 25% of initial conversion after 48min on stream.

When analyzing the data obtained for both binary and supported ZrO2-based samples one can conclude that the higher the chromium content, the faster the catalyst deactivation. As a consequence, the sample Cr10Zr90Ox lost about 75% of its initial activity after 48min on stream. Although bare ZrO2 revealed quite high resistance against deactivation, it showed the lowest propene selectivity of around 75% (Fig. 7(b)). The selectivity obtained over binary CrZrOx catalysts was between 80 and 85% and increased with a decrease in Cr loading. CrOx/LaZrOx catalysts performed very similar to Cr0.5Zr99.5Ox, which was the most selective among the binary catalysts. The K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst showed the selectivity between 85 and 90%.
For catalyst comparison with respect to propene productivity, we calculated space time yield (STY) related to catalyst volume (1m3). The results are shown in Fig. 7(c). The highest initial STY of about 3000kg·h1·m-3 was obtained over Cr10Zr90Ox. This high value decreased to approximately 700kg·h1·m-3 after 48min on propane stream. The last value was, however, very close to the initial value obtained over a K-CrOx/Al2O3. In general, all our Cr-containing catalysts with exception of Cr0.5Zr99.5Ox showed higher STY values than the reference material. The reason behind the higher productivity of our ZrO2-based catalysts is their higher activity (Table 1) and the higher bulk density (Table S1 in SI).
Catalyst durability was checked in a series of 10 PDH and oxidative regeneration cycles performed at 550C. Time-on-stream changes of propene STY in the first and the last catalytic cycles for each catalyst are shown in Fig. 8. The corresponding data as well as propene selectivity and propane conversion in all 10 cycles are presented in Fig. S2 in SI. All samples lost gradually their activity with rising time on stream within one cycle (Fig. 8(a)). The initial activity could be restored after oxidative catalyst treatment. The selectivity to propene also did not change from cycle to cycle. This suggests that catalyst deactivation within one PDH cycle should be caused by blockage of catalytically active sites by carbon-containing deposits.

TPO experiments were carried out with the spent catalysts after the last catalytic cycles (10th in Fig. 8) had been completed. The purpose was to determine the amount of carbon deposits formed and to identify the required temperature for complete removal of such deposits. CO2 was the main reaction product, while CO was formed in traces. The obtained CO2 and CO profiles are shown in Fig. S3 in SI. The overall amount of carbon formed per gram of each catalyst was calculated from these profiles. The obtained data together with the temperature of maximum of CO2 formation (TmaxCO2) are listed in Table 3. The TmaxCO2 value of 395C was determined for ZrO2 and decreased with rising chromium amount in both binary CrZrOx and supported CrOx/LaZrOx catalysts. It is also worth mentioning that coke removal from the former materials appears at lower temperatures when considering apparent surface density of Cr sites. The effect of Cr loading on TmaxCO2 might be due the fact that CrOx species actively participate in coke combustion; the higher the concentration of such species, the higher is the combustion rate and therefore the lower should be the temperature for maximal COx formation in TPO tests of spent catalysts.

The lowest amount of coke (m(C)) formed per gram of catalyst was determined over ZrO2 followed by K-CrOx/Al2O3 (Table 3). It increased with chromium content in CrZrOx and supported CrOx/LaZrOx catalysts (Fig. S4 in SI). Moreover, for all ZrO2-based catalysts, the higher the amount of propene (m(C3H6)) formed within one cycle, the higher was the corresponding amount of coke (Fig. S5 in SI). Such dependence indicates that propene is the main gas-phase precursor of carbon-containing deposits and is in agreement with the selectivity-conversion plots in Fig. 5. The fact that K-CrOx/Al2O3 produced higher amount of propene than Cr2Zr98Ox and 0.5CrOx/LaZrOx but formed less coke (Fig. S5 in SI) can be explained by its lower acidity. The importance of catalyst acidity for coke formation is indirectly supported by the results plotted in Fig. 9. This figure shows that the ratio of m(C)/m(C3H6) increases with the concentration of acidic sites determined from NH3-TPD tests. We used this ratio to take into account different catalyst activity for formation of propene actively participating in coke formation. It is also seen in Fig. 9 that such dependence is weak for ZrO2-based catalysts possessing chromium. Therefore, we suggest that catalyst acidity should be not the only factor affecting coke formation. An apparent surface density of Cr sites may be another factor. From a mechanistic point of view, coke formation occurs through reaction of adsorbed olefin molecules with each other to yield higher-molecular weight compounds [33], [34]. Such coupling reactions can efficiently proceed when adsorbed olefin molecules are located close to each other. Under these considerations, the higher the density of active sites, where propene molecules are formed and also adsorbed, the higher is the probability for their reaction to coke precursors.

Fig. 9. Effect of the concentration of surface acidic sites on the ratio of m(C)/m(C3H6). The amounts of propene and carbon were determined from the 10th C3H8 dehydrogenation cycle (Fig. 8(a)) and following temperature-programmed catalyst reoxidation respectively.
Finally we benchmarked our catalyst against a K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material in terms of propene production; we calculated the overall amount of propene which could be produced over 1m3 of each catalyst during each catalytic cycle. The amount was obtained by integrating STY profiles from Fig. S2 (a). The obtained values are shown in Fig. 8(b). It is obvious that binary catalysts with Cr2O3 loading higher than 0.31wt.% and all supported catalysts produced significantly higher amount of propene than K-CrOx/Al2O3 despite of the fact that they contain considerably lower amount of chromium. It is also worth mentioning that bare ZrO2, all binary CrZrOx catalysts and K-CrOx/Al2O3 did not lose their activity for propene formation from cycle to cycle as concluded from the amount of propene formed in each cycle (Fig. 8(b)). However, the supported CrOx/LaZrOx catalysts were not stable; the propene amount decreased from cycle to cycle with the highest changes being determined for 3.2CrOx/LaZrOx. Thus, the obtained results prove that bulk promoting of ZrO2 with Cr is advantageous over surface deposition of CrOx on LaZrOx.
4. Conclusions
Bulk promoting of ZrO2 with CrOx was shown to be a promising method for preparation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts possessing 1/40 of chromium content of an industrial analogue of K-CrOx/Al2O3 but showing high activity and selectivity. So designed CrZrOx also performed superior to their supported counterparts CrOx/LaZrOx when comparing both types of catalysts with similar surface density of Cr sites. The latter species promote in situ removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2 to create surface coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ (Zrcus) sites, which actively participate in propane dehydrogenation. In addition, the presence of chromium inside ZrO2 lattice or on its surface was shown to decrease catalyst acidity that prevents formation of coke.
The type of the catalyst (CrZrOx vs. CrOx/LaZrOx) was shown to have an evident effect on propene selectivity and catalyst durability. Thus, supported catalysts demonstrated slightly higher propene selectivity at a conversion degree of about 30% than binary catalysts but lost their high performance from cycle to cycle in a series of 10 alternating propane DH and oxidative regeneration cycles. The high durability of CrZrOx might be related to suppressed ability of catalytically active CrOx to sinter.
