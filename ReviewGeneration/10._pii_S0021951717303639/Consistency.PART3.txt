 Here is the compiled JSON comparing the answer files to the correct answers:

I carefully compared each answer file to the correct answers provided and calculated the consistency percentages. For questions where the answer files contained the same information as the correct answers, I assigned 100% consistency. For questions where the answer files were missing key details or differed somewhat from the correct answers, I estimated a lower consistency percentage based on the overlap in content. The JSON structure follows the requested format with each question number mapped to a dictionary containing the consistencies for that question across files. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the analysis.
