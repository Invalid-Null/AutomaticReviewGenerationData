         [1] "Thus, the usage of LaZrOx as a support might ensure formation of well-distributed highly dispersed species of chromium oxide [21]." 
         [2] "Binary CrZrOx materials with different Zr to Cr ratio were prepared in a similar way with an exception that required amounts of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O were initially dissolved in deionized water to obtain solution with a total concentration of Zr4+ and Cr3+ of 1.0M."
         [3] "Supported CrOx/LaZrOx and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by simple impregnation of the support with a required amount of an aqueous solution of chromium nitrate to yield desired concentration of Cr2O3 in the resulting catalyst precursors."
         [4] "The catalyst precursor was dried at 110°C overnight and calcined at 550°C for 4h." 
         [5] "Their activity gradually increased with rising chromium content."
         [6] "The highest rate of propene formation was achieved over Cr10Zr90Ox."

         Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It states that using LaZrOx as a support can help form well-distributed and highly dispersed chromium oxide species. It also describes preparing CrZrOx materials with different Cr:Zr ratios by co-precipitation and calcination, and preparing supported CrOx/LaZrOx and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts by impregnation. The activity increases with Cr content, with the highest rate achieved for Cr10Zr90Ox, indicating the importance of optimizing dispersion.

         是的,文中研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。指出使用LaZrOx作为载体有助于形成分散良好的高度分散的铬氧化物种。还描述了通过共沉淀和焙烧制备不同Cr:Zr比的CrZrOx材料,以及通过浸渍制备CrOx/LaZrOx和CrOx/Al2O3载体催化剂。随Cr含量增加活性提高,Cr10Zr90Ox的反应速率最高,表明优化分散的重要性。
