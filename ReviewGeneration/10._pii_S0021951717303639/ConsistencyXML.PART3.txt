 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative files, I have analyzed the consistency between each answer file and the correct answers. Here is the XML structure with the consistency ratios:

I carefully analyzed the content of each answer against the provided correct answers to determine semantic consistency. Where answers contained relevant quotes and key information from the correct answers, I assessed higher consistency. I accounted for paraphrasing and synonyms when judging consistency. Let me know if you have any other questions!
