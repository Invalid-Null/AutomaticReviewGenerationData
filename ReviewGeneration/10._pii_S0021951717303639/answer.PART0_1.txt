 Unfortunately the given literature does not provide sufficient information to directly answer the specific questions asked. The article focuses on evaluating the catalytic performance of chromium-zirconium oxide materials for propane dehydrogenation, and does not extensively discuss many of the broader topics raised in the questions, such as propylene applications, computational studies of mechanisms, or quantitative structure-activity relationships. The article introduces the catalyst types studied but does not go into depth on other major catalyst classes explored in the field. Some limited background is provided but overall the focus is on presenting the authors' experimental results rather than comprehensively reviewing the wider propane dehydrogenation literature. While an interesting read on a specific set of catalysts, the narrow scope of the work means it cannot adequately address the broad questions posed. I have provided brief answers below indicating when questions are not addressed, but suggest referring to other reviews or overview articles in this field to find more details on the topics of interest.
