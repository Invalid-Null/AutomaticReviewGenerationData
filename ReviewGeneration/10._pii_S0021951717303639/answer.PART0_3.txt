 Unfortunately the given literature does not provide sufficient information to answer any of the questions in detail. The article focuses on investigating chromium-zirconia based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide extensive background on propylene production, mechanisms of catalyst activity, major catalyst classes explored, thermodynamic and kinetic factors, use of computational modeling, or structure-activity relationships. The questions seem more broad than the scope of the given literature.
