 Unfortunately, there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that address the questions asked. The article focuses on N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation over steam-activated iron zeolites, evaluating the effects of different zeolite structures (MFI, BEA), acidity, and iron species on catalytic performance and deactivation. It does not compare metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts, investigate Pt alloy catalysts, electronic/geometric effects in bimetallics, subsurface promoters like Re or Mn, ensemble/ligand effects between metals, or modifying zeolite properties like Si/Al ratio and mesoporosity.

Since there is no information in the literature relevant to answering the questions, my response for each question is:

1. The article does not compare the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts. No relevant information is provided.

2. The article does not evaluate any Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn, Pt-Ga, Pt-Zn for propane dehydrogenation. No relevant data or insights are provided.  

3. The article does not investigate electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. No relevant examples or structure-function insights are revealed.

4. The article does not explore the use of subsurface promoters like Re or Mn in bimetallic and alloy catalysts to tune selectivity. No relevant examples or data are provided.

5. The article does not describe any synergistic effects between metals in bimetallic or alloy catalysts, attributed to ensemble and/or ligand effects. No relevant examples or explanations are provided.  

6. The article does evaluate zeolite supports like MFI and BEA structures for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. However, it does not provide any data or insights specific to propane dehydrogenation performance.

7. The article does not investigate the effects of tuning zeolite Si/Al ratio or incorporating mesoporosity on propane dehydrogenation catalyst performance. No relevant structure-function relationships are revealed.
