<quotes>

[1] Pore volume and surface area of catalysts decrease, whereas the pore size shows no obvious variation except for the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst.

[2] The surface area of SiO2 solid is smaller than that of the corresponding 30-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, but the pore size has increased, implying that the doped VOX species influence the structure of the SiO2 solid. 

[3] The results demonstrate that VOX-SiO2 catalysts should be gelled below 75C to give VOX species better dispersion in SiO2 solid surfaces.

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies the effect of gelation temperature and calcination temperature on the dispersion of VOX species in the SiO2 support. Higher gelation temperatures above 75°C lead to lower surface area and pore volume, indicating agglomeration of VOX species. Doping with VOX influences the porosity compared to pure SiO2.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
答:是的,文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它研究了凝胶温度和焙烧温度对SiO2载体中VOX种的分散程度的影响。75°C以上的较高凝胶温度导致比表面积和孔容积降低,表示VOX种聚集。与纯SiO2相比,掺杂VOX会影响孔隙率。
