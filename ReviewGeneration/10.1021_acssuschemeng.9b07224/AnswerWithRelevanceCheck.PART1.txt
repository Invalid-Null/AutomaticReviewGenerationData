         [1] "This manuscript provides detailed economic and environmental impact analyses of the integrated propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydroformylation process (termed the CEBC-PXL process) and compares the results with those of the conventional process that employs distillation to separate the propane/propylene mixtures to obtain polymer-grade propylene."
         [2] "The propane dehydrogenation process is based on CB&Is CATOFIN PDH process which converts propane to propylene on Cr-based catalysts."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         The article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It only mentions the propane dehydrogenation process analyzed is based on CB&I's CATOFIN PDH process using Cr-based catalysts to convert propane to propylene. The other answers also indicate no metal oxide catalysts were evaluated.
