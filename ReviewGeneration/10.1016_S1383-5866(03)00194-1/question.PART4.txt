Efficient catalytic reactors-processors for fuel cells and synthesis applications
Abstract
Improved reaction and reaction-separation hydrocarbon processing-conversion systems for conversion of gaseous hydrocarbons (i.e. C1C4) to hydrogen and carbon oxide mixtures are utilized with the produced hydrogen rich species used to power hydrogen based fuel cells or alternatively to synthesize synthetic fuels such as methanol. Applications with steam and CO2 reforming of methane and other fossil and waste type hydrocarbon mixtures such as coal gas from gasification are analyzed by using impermeable and membrane type reformers. Technical objectives of these studies include turnkey process development for the fuel cell industry (REFUCEL processes) with increased processing capacity, conversion, separation efficacy (e.g. through recycling streams and multiple side feeds) and increased power output and end product utilization. Further advances and modifications of the proposed processors contribute to enhanced carbon and CO2 sequestration via in-situ conversion and recycling with concomitant environmental and economic benefits from the installations.
1. Introduction
Substantial advances in fuel cell technology during the last 10 years point out to rapid progress in future stack installations and their commercialization potential. Advances are in internal fuel cell design (electrodes, electrolytes, catalysts), fuel conversion processor, power inversion and transformation unit, heat utilization unit. Economic feasibility of the installations is correlated to high efficiency (e.g. 6585% for advanced units) and high power density output (kW/m3), increased reliability for continuous dispersed power generation, and reduced plant installation, operation and maintenance cost. These targets combined with virtual elimination of pollution by use of fuel cells in stationary (e.g. central and remote power stations) and transportation (e.g. automobile) sources make this technology highly attractive and applicable. Fuel conversion and processing units (fuel processors) integrated with high efficiency fuel cells focus on generation of hydrogen mixtures for direct use in the cells. In high temperature fuel cells such as molten carbonate (MCFCs) and solid oxide ones (SOFCs) hydrogen is mixed with carbon monoxide for use as fuel or carbon dioxide for use as combined fueloxidant mixture (MCFCs). In low temperature cells such as the proton exchange membrane (PEMFC), pure hydrogen is required for the cell operation and downstream separation of carbon oxides and hydrocarbons is necessary.
Below in the paper we analyze and discuss improved process designs referring to hydrocarbon processors for fuel cells. They are used to convert catalytically pure or mixtures of hydrocarbons such as methane, natural and coal gas, landfill/biomass gases, or flue and tail gases from processing and refinery units. Special emphasis is given in these mixtures containing methane and carbon dioxide, wherein the processors are modified in comparison with the pure methane processors. In previous reports [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] we analyzed and described the reaction, separation (e.g. permeation), and performance (conversion, yield) characteristics of reactors (processors) and related processes for the methane steam reforming, water gas shift, and methane carbon dioxide reforming reactions including catalysis and membrane materials characteristics. The main types of reactors described were membrane type reformers which were utilized as single permreactor [1], [5], permreactorseparator or reactorseparator sequence [2], [3], [4] and permreactorpermreactor sequence [6]. These reaction systems were applied for pure hydrogen, H2 and CO2, or H2 and CO (syn-gas) generation to be used as fuel gas for power generation or as synthesis gas for production of special chemicals (such as methanol and higher hydrocarbons) [2], [7]. More than one type of membrane reformers were examined based on the location of the fixed catalytic bed and the inert or catalytic nature of the inorganic (alumina based) membrane tube [1], [2]. Computational modeling of the described processors has been performed which shows performance measures (reactant conversion, product yield) versus variation of intrinsic model parameters (reactor space time, reaction temperature and pressure, feed composition, sweep gas to feed gas ratio) [1], [2]. By the use of the models, simulation of the processors was performed which analyzes and shows their performance under new operating conditions, which are of interest to new process applications.
2. Description of reforming processors
The described catalytic processors for powering fuel cells are based on reforming and shift reactions of primary and secondary hydrocarbon mixtures. They are integrated with fuel cells of various types based on the composition of the delivered final gas mixture into the cell or cell stack.
The described processing reactions consist the main routes of producing pure, low cost hydrogen and hydrogen carbon oxide mixtures (i.e. H2, H2 and CO, H2 and CO2, or H2, CO and CO2) for powering low and high temperature fuel cells. The processors described below are suited for producing both types of fuel gas based on operation of different process configurations and suitable reaction, separation equipment. Reforming of methane or natural gas by steam is a highly effective recombination route for producing pure hydrogen after the removal of the CO2 byproduct [8], [9]. Similarly, the water gas shift reaction will produce pure H2 after the CO2 removal. Pure hydrogen is directed to feed low and medium temperature fuel cells such as the proton exchange membrane (PEM), alkaline, and phosphoric acid types [10]. Carbon dioxide reforming of methane or the steam and carbon dioxide reforming process produces a H2 and CO rich mixture which can be used directly to power high temperature fuel cells such as the solid oxide or molten carbonate types [4], [6], [10]. H2 and CO can be also produced combined by the methane steam reforming reaction only by tuning the catalyst composition. Further syngas from coal gasification can be used directly as a fuel feed in a MCFC or SOFC. Below, we give emphasis in designing processors for both steam and CO2 reforming reaction schemes which can be also extended to utilize water gas shift and coal gasification mixtures. These processes/ors are termed under the unified name REFUCEL which means Reforming for Fuel Cells.
Use of membrane reactors (permreactors) as permeable reforming and shift catalytic reactors offers certain advantages over impermeable conventional reactors such as fixed bed catalytic reactors. One of these advantages is the one step separation of pure hydrogen or hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide mixtures out of the reaction zone by the use of the membrane and direct delivery into the cell. Another advantage is the increased hydrocarbon conversion in the permreformer, caused by the product permeation via the membrane (i.e. mainly this of hydrogen), which yields the required quantity of product hydrogen for the next application, at lower operation temperature than the counterpart impermeable reactor. Use of lower temperature in turn is beneficial for increasing the reactor and catalyst life time and reducing the heating requirements of the reformer. Vasileiadis [1] has reported on such catalytic inorganic permreactor configurations based on mesoporous alumina tubes. Extensive series of experiments and consecutive modeling of the methane steam reforming and parallel water gas shift reactions were accomplished. The work demonstrated the advances and necessary level of improvements needed for implementation of the technology in hydrogen based chemical synthesis and power generation.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Methane-steam reforming process
Fig. 1 describes a methane steam reforming permreactor which can be also suited for reforming higher molecular weight alkanes in the gaseous (e.g. natural gas, naphtha, C1C4 molecules) or liquid (e.g. gasoline, gasoil, higher paraffins) phase.

The central reforming processor can be an impermeable single tube or multitube reactor filled with reforming catalyst. An active catalyst is used to make the catalytic fixed bed in the tubes, such as nickel or nickel oxide on various supports such as alumina, magnesia, silica, titania or a mixture of these [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Precious metal catalysts such as ruthenium and rhodium are also highly active though they deactivate easily from carbon deposition caused by cracking and recombination reactions [16].
Further, a permreformer can substitute the conventional reformer in Fig. 1 which offers the aforementioned advances for the modified REFUCEL process. By using an inorganic or metal type membrane reactor in tubular or multitubular reactor configuration, two main gas outputs (exits) are utilized; this of the permeated gas via the membrane and this of the non-permeated or rejected gas by the membrane which is the tubular reactor exit. The gas mixture exiting from each output can be either utilized in separate applications (as feed in two separate fuel cells) or merged in a single stream downstream, and used as single feed in a fuel cell.
The possible use of a heat exchanger at one or both exits of the permreformer condenses the unreacted steam from the exit gas streams and at the same time generates new steam to be used as bypass reactant in the reactor inlet. The heating of the permreformer as shown in Fig. 1, can be achieved by splitting part of the feed gas or by using low Btu gases from secondary or waste type heat sources. The feature of a shown bypass exit stream from the reactor containing mixtures of H2 with CO and CO2 is used for chemicals co-production such as methanol as described in synthesis reactions below:

The permeability of various gases via the inorganic alumina membranes have been previously reported [1], [17]. The average permeability of hydrogen via the unmodified and nickel catalytically modified alumina membranes at low temperature (35 C) and low pressure drop across the membrane (11.5 atm) are about 180×1012 and 30×1012 mol m1 s1 Pa1, respectively. The respective values for methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and argon (used as inert sweep gas) are between 40 and 80×1012 mol m1 s1 Pa1 for the unmodified, and between 6 and 13×1012 mol m1 s1 Pa1 for the nickel modified membranes. Modification of the membranes were done by adding nickel in the mesoporous multilayer alumina tubes by the dry impregnation method using NiNO3 solutions. Successive (multiple) modification of the membrane or modification with highly concentrated solutions resulted in almost complete blocking of the pores [1].
The hydrogen rich mixture at the exit stream can be used to power an interconnected fuel cell. After the steam condensation, the exit streams are rich in hydrogen and carbon dioxide products containing also carbon monoxide in smaller quantities. The final exit hydrogen to carbon oxide ratio depends on the catalyst selection and the equilibrium reforming conditions. The exit stream can be fed into a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) as a combined fueloxidant stream. The combined stream provides for both the fuel and the oxidant in a MCFC (V2) after the addition of oxygen as additional oxidant, according to the electrochemical reactions:

Fig. 2, reports the experimental performance of the permreformer (CFBP: catalytic fixed bed permreactor) (shown as reactor V1 in Fig. 1) at different space times, at a constant temperature (500 C) and reaction pressure (10 atm). The CFBP mode uses a catalytic membrane and catalyst fixed in the tubeside [1], [2], [17]. The conversion measures of the permreformer are compared with the performance of the impermeable plug flow reactor (PFR), and the equilibrium values derived from thermodynamic considerations at the reactor conditions [1]. As shown in the figure, it is characteristic for the CFBP to operate at higher conversions than the PFR and also to exceed the equilibrium based values for all space times examined in the experiments. This type of permreformer operation yields more H2 and CO2 than the impermeable plug flow reactor at the same conditions; moreover the conversion-yield values clearly exceed those derived at thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. Note that the temperature of operation used here (500 C) is substantially lower than those applied in industrial practice reformers (i.e. 700850 C). This effect eventually leads to much longer life times for the reformer itself and the enclosed membrane and catalyst materials which results in process costs reduction. The figure shows the benefit of using the membrane reformer over the range of the space times shown (different inlet volumetric flowrates) to generate the proper amount of fuel gas for the interconnected fuel cell. The two primary gas phase reactions taking place are given below:

The nickel based catalyst used in these experiments is capable to convert the produced carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide in one step process which includes both the methane steam reforming and water gas shift reactions. This beneficial effect eliminates the need for a consecutive (additional) water gas shift reactor and minimizes both the capital and operation costs of the process shown in Fig. 1. Note that the feed gas contains some hydrogen to avoid rapid catalyst deactivation especially at the inlet, (i.e. CH4:H2O:H2=1:4:0.2). The CFBP experimental data are simulated by the corresponding membrane reactor model as described below in detail. Similar experimental results and improvement effects by using the CFBP over the PFR are obtained with the CO2 yields which are plotted versus the same reactor space times (gr(cat) h/gmol CH4) as with the methane conversions plot. The experimental CO2 yield data and the corresponding simulation results by the CFBP model are plotted in detail in Fig. 3.

If we consider the main steady state design equations of the permreactors by employing a non-catalytic (blank) membrane, the following pseudo-homogeneous (axial) model relations are valid for the reaction species:
(6)
wherein: A=CH4, CO, CO2, H2O, H2, with: RCH4=R4, RH2O=R4R5, RCO2=R5, RCO=R4R5, RH2=3R4+R5.
Also, the thermal and pressure balances in the fixed bed catalytic reactor side (T) are given as follows:

, , are complemented by the initial conditions: at z=0 (inlet): XAT=0, TT=To, PT=PTo. with R4, R5 to be the reaction rates for methane steam reforming and water gas shift reactions respectively, and XAT the conversion of A in the tubeside of the reactor. The reaction rate expressions with associated kinetic and adsorption constants have been analyzed extensively in previous reports [1], [2], [5]. The reforming experiments shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 utilized a 15% by weight nickel oxide on calcium aluminate support commercially supplied catalyst. In the above equations r1 is the inner reactor tube diameter with r2=r1+t, with t to be the membrane thickness. TT, TS refer to the temperature of the reactor tube and permeate shell sides respectively, and UT is the overall heat transfer coefficient between the permreactor tube and shell interconnected sides. PA,e is the effective permeability of gas A via the membrane tube, with A to be any of the above reaction gases. Also pAT, pAS are the partial pressures of any gas A exerted within the reactor tube and permeate sides respectively, and nCH4oT the methane flowrate in the tubeside inlet. The rest of the variables in , , above are well known and have been defined in earlier reports [1], [2], [17], [18].
For the permeating species A in the empty shell side conduit the general equations are given below:

Also, the overall thermal balance becomes:

wherein Tw is the temperature of the external heating fluid/gas surrounding the reactor shell, Uw the overall heat transfer coefficient between the shell side and the surrounding external heating side, rw the permreactor shell radius, μmS the viscosity of the gas mixture flowing in the permeate shell side S. The pressure drop in the empty permeable shell of the reactor becomes as follows assuming laminar incompressible flow (HagenPoiseuille equation):
(11)
, , are complemented by the initial conditions: at z=0 (inlet): nAS=nAoS, TS=TSo, PS=PSo.
The set of , , , , , are integrated to provide the species conversions, molar flowrates, reactor temperature and pressure along the axial length at both membrane sides of the reactor and their values at the reactor exit. Fig. 4, shows representative simulative results from the same process by utilizing the above described model in a fixed bed permreactor (FBP) with inert (blank) membrane walls and with the catalyst fixed in the tubeside [1]. The feed in the permreformer is modified by adding some CO2 in the inlet of both reaction and permeation sides. The sweep gas in the shell side consists of CH4, H2O (steam), and CO2 in an effort to examine the effect of a split feed (or multiple feed) configuration in the permreformer in order to handle higher inlet flowrates. The simulation assumes constant reaction temperature (475 C) at both membrane sides and the two occurring , above. Three different pressures were assumed in the permeate side of the permreformer (10, 9.65, and 8 atm, respectively) while the pressure in the reaction side was maintained constant at 10 atm. It is characteristic that the permreformer operates at the highest conversion and yield measures under the entire range of steam to methane ratios, by keeping both sides of the membrane at the same pressure (i.e. 10 atm). At a constant permeate pressure of 9.65 atm the conversion levels off after the ratio H2O/CH4=4. At a constant permeate pressure of 8.0 atm the conversion start to decrease after a deflection point occurring at the ratio: H2O/CH4=2. In the last two cases, the lower performance of the permreactor at the lower permeation pressures is probably due to the permeation and loss of methane out of the reaction zone and the effect of the steam dilution in the tubeside feed. Similar modeling and simulation results were obtained for the CO2 yields which are indicative of the extent of the parallel water gas shift reaction. The CO2 yields in the FBP were simulated versus the same steam to methane inlet ratios as the ones shown in the X-axis of Fig. 4 and the corresponding yield profiles were obtained as well.

Previous modeling efforts with the methane steam reforming reaction refer mainly to impermeable tubular catalytic reactors [19] simulating as example, industrial reformers [20], phosphoric type reformer-fuel cell system [21], or reformer using large pore catalysts [22].
3.2. Methanecarbon dioxide reforming process
For the carbon dioxide reforming of methane, the single (one step) reformer process is similar to the one shown in Fig. 1. The exit gas is syngas rich, a mixture of H2 and CO, produced by the reforming reaction of methane with carbon dioxide (shown below), and the reverse water gas shift (the reverse of reaction 5);
(12)
One exit is utilized in the case of the impermeable reformer while two exits are used in the case of membrane reformer which can be combined into a single stream as with the steam reformer case. The exit syngas product can be fed directly as fuel gas in the inlet of an SOFC or MCFC anode (REFUCEL process).The following electrochemical reactions takes place in the interconnected SOFC (V2):

We have previously reported the CO2methane and other CO2hydrocarbon mixture reforming reactions with one step and two step permreactor or reactorpermreactor process [2], [6], [23]. A metal permreformer was designed to withdraw hydrogen from the reaction zone for delivery into a hydrogen driven fuel cell. A second water gas shift permreactor followed the first permreformer to convert the reject by the membrane CO product into CO2 and H2 for use in a molten carbonate fuel cell or for methanol synthesis [6]. A process modification of Fig. 1 for the CO2CH4 reforming reaction utilizes a membrane permeator in the downstream of the single impermeable reformer to separate the gas species exiting from the reformer after the condensation of steam and before entering in the fuel cell V2. For hydrogen only separation, a metal membrane can be used in the permeator, with the separated hydrogen to be used in interconnected hydrogen driven fuel cells. For combined H2 and CO2 separation or H2 and CO separation, a selective membrane such as a polymer, composite or inorganic one can be used to perform the task. The separated mixture of H2 and CO2 can be fed in an interconnected MCFC, while the H2 and CO mixture can be fed into an SOFC [2], [4]. The rejected by the permeator stream of CO and unreacted CH4 in the first case has the proper composition to be fed in a consecutive steam reforming reactor for additional H2 production and delivery in the cell [4]. In the second separation case (H2 and CO separation), the rejected by the permeator unreacted CO2 and CH4 are recycled into the reformer inlet thereby increasing the process efficacy. A similar process can be applied to the steam reforming of methane reaction with separation of H2 and CO2 in the permeator and recycling of the unreacted CO and CH4 into the first reformer in a closed loop process as also reported earlier [4]. The described cascade processes are especially useful when the first reformer yields low conversions, and the separation of products and recycling of reactants is necessary for the overall process efficiency and economy.
Hydrocarbon mixtures rich in CO2 are especially suited for CO2 reforming with or without steam for syngas or hydrogen production and use in fuel cells. Such mixtures include acidic natural gas, landfill and biomass gas, some types of coal gas rich in CO2 and CH4, also flue and tail gases rich in CO2 [4], [5], [10], [23], [24]. Similar catalysts as those aforementioned in steam reforming are suitable for CO2 reforming as well with the addition of palladium [25] and platinum as active reforming metals. Coal syngas rich in H2 and CO coming from coal gasifiers can be used as direct feedstock in the fuel cell V2 and the use of reactor V1 is eliminated [10].
3.3. Reformer-fuel cell analysis
In the following figures we give specific emphasis in the reformer operation in connection with the fuel cell performance. In Fig. 5, Fig. 6, we report the maximum thermodynamically attainable conversion and yield by the reformer, based on thermodynamic equilibrium reaction analysis. Considering dry reforming only (CO2 reforming and reverse water gas shift) in the reactor/processor, Fig. 5 reports the attainable equilibrium exit conversions of CH4 and Fig. 6 reports the attainable conversions of CO2 at the reactor exit. These results were obtained by solving the corresponding non-linear thermodynamic algebraic equations for the two coupled reactions. CH4 is consumed via the dry reforming reaction only while CO2 is consumed via both the reforming and the reverse water gas shift reaction. It is characteristic that by increasing the CO2 feed content (increasing the CO2/CH4 feed ratio) both the final CH4 and CO2 reactor conversions are increased substantially at each temperature (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). The conversions and yields obtained correspond to the maximum values attained by an impermeable reactor (e.g. plug flow catalytic reactor). Combined thermodynamic and kinetic reaction analysis in membrane reactors has been reported in detail earlier [26], [27], [28]. The studies have shown the conditions necessary to obtain maximum achievable conversion exceeding the equilibrium, as the cases described above (i.e. CFBP, FBP).

We report further in next Figure (Fig. 7) the output performance (kW power) of a fuel cell interconnected with the dry reformer. The CH4CO2 reforming and reverse water gas shift reactions are taking place in the reactor/processor. We assume utilization by the cell of both the H2 and CO content of the exit reformed gas, at a 60% constant fuel cell efficiency. Both the CH4/CO2 feed ratio and the reforming temperature are varied in the reformer to study output power measures by the cell. It is seen that a jump from 500 to 700 C in reformer temperature increases by four to fivefold the power output of the fuel cell (kW). However, further increase in temperature up to 800 C increases the power by a small percentage for the various feed ratios (i.e. a 1037% increase). This final increase in power is even smaller for the higher CO2 to methane ratio case. These results are considered highly useful for the technical selection criteria and specification of the adjacent fuel cell. A similar plot is shown in Fig. 8, which refers to the fuel cell power generation by an interconnected reformer utilizing the coupled methane steam reforming and forward water gas shift reactions (, only). The fuel cell assumes a constant 60% efficiency. Consistently higher outputs (kW) are obtained at 500 and 600 C than the corresponding dry reforming cases while at the higher 700 and 800 C the power output difference between the two reformers is minimized.

It is further very important to investigate the effect of the exit hydrogen to carbon oxide ratios for the different reaction-processing conditions (i.e. those shown in Fig. 8). Fig. 9, Fig. 10 show the exit H2/CO and H2/CO2 ratios respectively, for the previously specified methane steam reforming-water gas shift reactor at the different feed and temperature conditions as plotted in Fig. 8. These results are very useful for technical selection and specification of the adjacent type of fuel cell or chemical synthesis reactor. As example, it can be seen from Fig. 9, Fig. 10, that at low reforming temperature operation (i.e. 500600 C) the high H2/CO and low H2/CO2 mixture ratios make the fuel suitable for CO2 rich methanol synthesis via reaction (2). At high reforming temperatures 700800 C the ratios are reversed, with low H2/CO and high H2/CO2 exit compositions, which make the CO rich mixture suitable for methanol synthesis via the primary reaction (1). The same high temperature mixture richer in CO rather than CO2 (e.g. H2/CO=3.55.5) can be also used for FischerTropsch synthesis for production of olefinic hydrocarbons used for gasoline blending. Finally, the exit gas mixture from the CO2 based dry reforming reactions (Fig. 5, Fig. 6) is rich in CO for all feed ratios and temperature ranges (e.g. H2/CO<1). However, the presence of unreacted CO2 at all conditions makes the mixture suitable for methanol synthesis using both , .

As just described the gas exiting from the steam reforming reactor and the CO2 based dry reforming reactor consists of H2, CO and CO2 at different ratios (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 9, Fig. 10). It can be used without a treatment or separation step as combined fuel and oxidant in MCFCs or as fuel only in SOFCs with the CO2 to be innocuous compound for the solid oxide cell. From Fig. 9, the gas produced at about 500 C contains very low CO and can be used as well in a PEMFC since CO2 is innocuous for this type of cell.
It is apparent from Fig. 5, Fig. 6, that the CO2 consumption by the dry reforming reactor proceeds substantially as the temperature increases and the CO2/CH4 ratio increases. CO2 is actually converted into useful H2 and CO fuel gas which produces electricity in the interconnected high temperature fuel cell (Fig. 7). The direct consumption of CO2 in the reformer for final power generation by the fuel cell (i.e. MCFC, SOFC, PEMFC) is an important CO2 utilization. Moreover, the unreacted CO2 by the reformer can be used as oxidant in MCFCs adding up to its commodity value. The separation of anode and cathode in the fuel cell produces very pure CO2 byproduct with minimal NOx emissions, according to the described electrochemical reactions which can be fixed or chemically converted. CO2 fixation routes include geological, chemical or biological. Chemical conversion routes include methanol production via reaction (2) and production of CO2 based plastics such as polycarbonates. Moreover, part of the CO2 fuel cell effluent can be recycled into the reformer feed for continuous conversion especially for hydrocarbon feedstocks with low CO2 ratios. Alternatively, the hot exhaust CO2 gas from the fuel cell can be recycled in the heating shell of the reformer to provide part of the endothermic heat for the reforming reaction [23]. In all instances above, CO2 direct conversion in the reformer and use in the fuel cell eliminates currently used CO2 separation steps/units for reforming, shift, and gasification plants thereby reducing substantially capital plant costs and organic solvent byproducts used in conventional CO2 separation processes.
4. Conclusions
Effective use of catalytic impermeable reactors and membrane based permreactors can be in steam and CO2 hydrocarbon reforming, water gas shift, and coal gasification processes for production of hydrogen and synthesis gas mixtures for direct use in interconnected fuel cells. Fuel cells can operate with fuel gas coming out of the reformers and permreformers at various operating conditions (REFUCEL processes). Experiments and modeling of the reformers and fuel cells shows the degree of methane and carbon dioxide conversion in the reformers and the power output by the fuel cells. Further, part of the synthesis gas coming out of the reformers can be used for alternative chemical synthesis such as in methanol or higher olefins production. Such type of fuel cell and catalytic processor system integrations are coupled with increased efficiency power output and pollution prevention effects, including reduction of NOx and greenhouse gases, primarily this of CO2.
