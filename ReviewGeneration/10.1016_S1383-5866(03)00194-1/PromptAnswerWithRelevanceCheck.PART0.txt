 Unfortunately, the literature provided does not contain information relevant to answering the questions asked, which are about propane dehydrogenation mechanisms, kinetics, computational studies, structure-activity relationships, etc. 

The article is titled "Efficient catalytic reactors-processors for fuel cells and synthesis applications" and discusses methane and carbon dioxide reforming processes to produce hydrogen and syngas for fuel cell applications. It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation.

Since there is no relevant information in the literature to answer the questions, I will simply state "No relevant quotes" and "The literature does not contain information to answer this question" for each question.
