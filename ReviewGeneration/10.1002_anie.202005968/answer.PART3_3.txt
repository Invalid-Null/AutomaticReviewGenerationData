[1] "VOx supported on TiO2 were prepared by the wetness impregnation method, and the loading amount of V was controlled ranging from 0.05 to 4wt%, named as xV/TiO2, where x is mass weight percent of metal V on TiO2."

[2] "The BET surface areas of TiO2 supports are about 21m2, therefore the V density of 1V/TiO2 was determined to be 0.89mmolV per 100m2 of titanium oxide (namely, 0.081wt% vanadium oxide per m2 of titanium oxide surface area), which is close to the previous reported theoretical monolayer."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It prepares VOx/TiO2 catalysts with varying vanadium loadings from 0.05 to 4 wt% using wetness impregnation. It determines the monolayer dispersion capacity to be around 1 wt% V based on the TiO2 surface area.

[1] "Insitu Raman and DRIFTS, which are more sensitive to surface VOx structure,27 were further performed to monitor the evolution of VO bonds and reaction intermediates." 

[2] "In terms of surface reaction, insitu DRIFTS showed that C3H8 adsorption occurs in forms of CH distortion. Then propyl complex is oxidatively dehydrogenated to C3H6 (ν(C=C), 1645cm−1) by subtracting H to oxygen sites, presenting a positive hydroxy band (VOH, 3650cm−1) and a negative V=O band (2050cm−1) over 1V/TiO2"

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses in-situ Raman and DRIFTS to monitor the evolution of VO bonds and reaction intermediates during propane dehydrogenation over VOx/TiO2 catalysts. DRIFTS revealed dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane to propylene via hydrogen abstraction by lattice oxygen.
