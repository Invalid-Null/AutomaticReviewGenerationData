         [1] "Graphical Abstract The loadingreaction-barrier relationship over VOx/TiO2 catalysts is investigated for chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
         [2] "Sub-monolayer or monolayer vanadia nanostructures, compared with conventional crystalline V2O5 oxygen carriers, dramatically suppress the CO2 co-production by evading O2 bulk diffusion and subsequent evolution into surface electrophilic oxygen species." 
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         The article proposes that sub-monolayer or monolayer vanadia nanostructures supported on TiO2 can dramatically suppress CO2 co-production compared to conventional crystalline V2O5 oxygen carriers. This is achieved by evading O2 bulk diffusion in V2O5 and subsequent evolution into surface electrophilic oxygen species that lead to overoxidation.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         该文提出,与常规的V2O5晶态载氧剂相比,TiO2载体上亚单层或单层钒酸纳米结构可以大大抑制CO2的共生产。这是通过避免V2O5中的O2大量扩散并随后演变成导致过氧化的表面电子亲合氧基实现的。

         [1] "In the reducer, the propane feedstock is oxidized by the lattice oxygen from metal oxides." 
         [2] "the core of CL-ODH using propane as the feedstock involves complex redox reactions in which propane molecules adsorb and dissociate on the surface of metal oxides, namely oxygen carriers."
         [3] "the diffusion of O2 significantly influences the surface reaction kinetics. Increasing the binding energy of VO bonds to inhibit the lattice oxygen diffusion is critical to enhance the propylene selectivity."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         The article proposes a mechanistic scenario where propane adsorbs and dissociates on the surface of the metal oxide oxygen carrier, and is oxidized by lattice oxygen to form propylene. Lattice oxygen diffusion needs to be inhibited by increasing VO bond strength to limit overoxidation and enhance propylene selectivity.

         该文提出一个机理,丙烷先吸附和解离在金属氧化物载氧剂表面,然后被晶格氧氧化生成丙烯。需要通过增强VO键能抑制晶格氧的扩散,以限制过氧化并提高丙烯选择性。

         [1] "Considering the impurities and contaminations, the VOx/TiO2 catalysts are calcined in air at 500C before the XPS characterization. The calculated ratios of OII/OI (OI: lattice oxygen, OII: adsorbed OH in water at oxygen defects) ascribed from XPS of O1s gradually decreased with the increasing of V loadings (Supporting Information, FigureS3A,B), suggesting the VOx species might be incorporated into the defective sites of TiO2 support and induced the decreasing of defective sites."
         [2] "Therefore, the schematic diagram for the dispersion of vanadia species on the TiO2 surface was showed in the Supporting Information, FigureS3D. When the loading of V is very low, VOx species were mainly located on the defective sites of TiO2 surface. With the increasing of V loadings, the isolated and polymerized VOx species were gradually formed."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         The article explores metal-support interfacial effects by showing VOx species incorporate into defects on the TiO2 surface at low loadings. This changes the dispersion state from isolated VOx to polymeric VOx with increasing loading, modulating activity and selectivity.

         该文通过展示低负载下VOx物种嵌入TiO2表面的缺陷点,来探索金属-支撑体界面效应。随着负载量的增加,这改变了从隔离的VOx到聚合的VOx的分散状态,调控了活性和选择性。
