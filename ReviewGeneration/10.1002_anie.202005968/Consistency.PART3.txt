 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative files, I have compiled the consistency ratios between each answer file and the correct answers as follows:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "0%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},  
  "4": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "0%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "0%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "0%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},
  "7": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "0%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},
  "8": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "0%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "0%", "answer4.txt": "0%"}
}
```

The consistency ratio expresses the percentage of matching content between each answer file and the correct answer for that specific question. 0% means completely inconsistent, 100% means completely consistent. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
