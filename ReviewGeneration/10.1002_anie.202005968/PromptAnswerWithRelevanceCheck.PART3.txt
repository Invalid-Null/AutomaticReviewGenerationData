<Answer>

 Unfortunately this literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the provided questions, as it focuses on a different catalyst system and reaction. The article investigates vanadium oxide supported on titanium oxide for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, rather than propane dehydrogenation catalysts in zeolitic supports. It does not discuss methods for synthesizing isolated single sites, metal encapsulation techniques, optimizing dispersion, in-situ characterization, advanced microscopy, X-ray techniques, or evaluating different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation specifically.
