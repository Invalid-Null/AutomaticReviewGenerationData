[1] "The CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is a sustainable route for the production of propylene concerning the potential utilization of CO2."

[2] "Since CO2 as a soft oxidant is introduced into the feeds, the formation of propylene might proceed via a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation or two-step coupling process involving the direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) even though their net reactions are the same."

[3] "The latter pathway (DDP + RWGS) in practice is more desired because in situ consumption of H2 could shift thermodynamic equilibrium to the side with a higher yield of propylene."

[4] "The inclusion of these intractable side reactions inevitably presents a great challenge in catalyst design to maximize the yield of propylene in thermodynamic equilibrium via kinetics control."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explains that CO2 can act as a soft oxidant to facilitate oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It notes that this can proceed through either a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step coupling pathway involving direct dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse water gas shift reaction. The two-step pathway is desirable because consuming H2 via RWGS shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium toward higher propylene yield. However, side reactions present challenges for catalyst design to maximize propylene yield through kinetic control.

Answer: 该文献阐述了CO2可以作为软氧化剂促进丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯。它指出这可以通过一步氧化脱氢途径或两步偶联途径来实现,两步偶联途径包括丙烷直接脱氢和逆水煤气转化反应。两步偶联途径更可取,因为通过RWGS消耗H2可以将热力学平衡转移到获得更高丙烯收率的一侧。然而,副反应为催化剂设计提出了通过动力学控制最大化丙烯收率的挑战。

[1] "Thus far, the most effective catalysts reported for one-step CO2-ODHP via a Marsvan Krevelen (MvK) redox mechanism involving the lattice oxygen principally focus on the supported metal oxides (e.g., CrOx, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, MoO3, and In2O3) and solid solutions (e.g., Zn-Zr and Ce-Zr) owing to the presence of multivalence states and oxygen storage/release capacity, respectively."  

[2] "When the mechanism of the two-step coupling process is taken into account to design a catalyst, the active component toward CO2 adsorption and activation should be introduced, generally referring to those metallic catalysts composed of both precious (Ru, Pt, and Pd) and nonprecious metals (Fe, Co, or Ni)."

[3] "These metallic active sites, however, could concurrently promote the activation and cleavage of CC bonds in propane in addition to the activation of CO bonds in CO2, resulting in coke deposition and a low yield of propylene due to the underlying side reactions of DRP, deep dehydrogenation, and cracking."

<English version answer>  
Answer: The article introduces two major catalyst classes explored for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Supported metal oxides and solid solutions have been effective for the one-step mechanism involving lattice oxygen. Metallic catalysts composed of precious and non-precious metals have been studied for the two-step coupling mechanism, as they can activate CO2. However, metallic sites can also activate and cleave C-C bonds in propane, causing side reactions and coke deposition that lower propylene yield.

Answer: 该文献介绍了两大类用于CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢的催化剂。载体金属氧化物和固溶体对于涉及晶格氧的一步机理比较有效。由贵金属和非贵金属组成的金属催化剂已被研究用于两步偶联机理,因为它们可以活化CO2。然而,金属位点也可以激活和断裂丙烷中的C-C键,导致副反应和焦炭生成,这降低了丙烯收率。

[1] "Combining the results of the temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) with the measurements of temperature-programmed desorption and mass spectra (TPD-MS) using the probe molecules of C3H8 and CO2, it was proposed that isolated framework Fe species were active sites for the catalytic conversion of CO2, while the nanostructured GaN was responsible for the adsorption and activation of C3H8."

[2] "Catalytic results and kinetics show that the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) over GaN/Fe-silicalite-1 proceeds by following a two-step coupling process (direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) + reverse water gas shift (RWGS)) and also is a structure-sensitive reaction characterized by the dependence of GaN particle size on the specific catalytic activity and apparent activation energy of converting C3H8 and CO2." 
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article discusses that TPSR, TPD-MS studies with C3H8 and CO2 probe molecules, along with catalytic results and kinetics, indicate isolated framework Fe species activate CO2 while nanostructured GaN activates and adsorbs C3H8. This shows CO2-ODHP over GaN/Fe-silicalite-1 follows a two-step DDP + RWGS coupling process. It is a structure-sensitive reaction where GaN particle size impacts activity and apparent activation energy of converting C3H8 and CO2.

Answer: 该文献讨论了TPSR、TPD-MS研究以及催化结果和动力学表明,与C3H8和CO2探针分子一起使用时,隔离的框架Fe物种激活CO2,而纳米结构的GaN激活和吸附C3H8。这表明GaN/Fe-硅沸石-1上的CO2-ODHP遵循两步DDP + RWGS偶联过程。这是一种结构敏感的反应,GaN粒子大小会影响C3H8和CO2转换的活性和表观活化能。
