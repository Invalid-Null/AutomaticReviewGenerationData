Understanding the Role of Fe Doping in Tuning the Size and Dispersion of GaN Nanocrystallites for CO2-Assisted Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane
Abstract
The Fe-doped silicalite-1 zeolite as a matrix was employed to implant GaN nanocrystallites via a combined wet impregnation with in situ nitridation method. Direct spectroscopic evidences under a vacuum unraveled that the incorporation of the isolated framework Fe atoms could cause the generation of more interior silanols and especially hydrogen-bonded groups of silanol nests, where the solvated Ga3+ ions and urea in an N2 atmosphere at high temperatures were transformed into the highly dispersed GaN nanocrystallites that were embedded simultaneously in defects of the Fe-silicalite-1 matrix with the binding structure of SiOGaN. Moreover, the particle size distribution of GaN can be tuned from the nanoscale (14.6  3.5 nm) to sub-nanoscale (2.7  0.4 nm) by regulating the molar ratio of Si/Fe. Combining the results of the temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) with the measurements of temperature-programmed desorption and mass spectra (TPD-MS) using the probe molecules of C3H8 and CO2, it was proposed that isolated framework Fe species were active sites for the catalytic conversion of CO2, while the nanostructured GaN was responsible for the adsorption and activation of C3H8. Catalytic results and kinetics show that the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) over GaN/Fe-silicalite-1 proceeds by following a two-step coupling process (direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) + reverse water gas shift (RWGS)) and also is a structure-sensitive reaction characterized by the dependence of GaN particle size on the specific catalytic activity and apparent activation energy of converting C3H8 and CO2. Without the occurrence of GaN sintering, the slight loss of catalytic activity caused by coke deposition was confirmed by linearly correlating the normalized amount of coke with the deactivation rate.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is a sustainable route for the production of propylene concerning the potential utilization of CO2. Since CO2 as a soft oxidant is introduced into the feeds, the formation of propylene might proceed via a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation or two-step coupling process involving the direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) even though their net reactions are the same. (1,2) The latter pathway (DDP + RWGS) in practice is more desired because in situ consumption of H2 could shift thermodynamic equilibrium to the side with a higher yield of propylene. Furthermore, the presence of CO2 also enables the coke deposition on the catalyst surface to be removed in part via a reverse Boudouard reaction (RBR) and thus mitigates the deactivation. (35) Nonetheless, an important parallel competing reaction of dry reforming of propane (DRP) to syngas usually occurs and dominates under the same reaction condition as CO2-ODHP. (1,2,68) The inclusion of these intractable side reactions inevitably presents a great challenge in catalyst design to maximize the yield of propylene in thermodynamic equilibrium via kinetics control.
Thus far, the most effective catalysts reported for one-step CO2-ODHP via a Marsvan Krevelen (MvK) redox mechanism involving the lattice oxygen principally focus on the supported metal oxides (e.g., CrOx, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, MoO3, and In2O3) and solid solutions (e.g., Zn-Zr and Ce-Zr) owing to the presence of multivalence states and oxygen storage/release capacity, respectively. (917) When the mechanism of the two-step coupling process is taken into account to design a catalyst, the active component toward CO2 adsorption and activation should be introduced, generally referring to those metallic catalysts composed of both precious (Ru, Pt, and Pd) and nonprecious metals (Fe, Co, or Ni). (1,5,8,1820) These metallic active sites, however, could concurrently promote the activation and cleavage of CC bonds in propane in addition to the activation of CO bonds in CO2, resulting in coke deposition and a low yield of propylene due to the underlying side reactions of DRP, deep dehydrogenation, and cracking. Thus, it is of paramount importance to explore new catalytically active substances enabling the selective activation of CH and CO bonds together with the inhibited cleavage of CC bonds.
Gallium nitride (GaN) as an emerging semiconductor with a wide band gap has been investigated extensively in photocatalysis because of its unique electronic properties and chemical and thermal stability. (2123) As for the thermocatalytic applications, bulk GaN with a wurtzite crystal structure has been reported in the realm of the nonoxidative aromatization of light alkanes and selective hydrogenation of CO2, indicating an ability of activating both CH bonds and CO bonds in propane and CO2, respectively. (2426) Moreover, the size effect of GaN on the catalytic hydrogenation performance shows that CO2 conversion increases with the decrease in the crystal size from 26.6 to 7.4 nm, which is indicative of structure sensitivity. (24) To improve the reactivity of GaN, great efforts have been made by employing amorphous SiO2, zeolite, and mesoporous siliceous (SBA-15, MCF, and KIT-6) materials to support GaN with the aim of increasing the exposure of surface active sites, (2730) and these resultant catalysts show an enhanced catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP and methane conversion to ethylene. Importantly, it is also proposed that the interaction between GaN and silanols (Si-OH) contributes to the binding structure of Si-O-GaN that might be the catalytically active site for the synchronous activation of CH, CO, and CC bonds in the reaction system of CO2 and C3H8. As a result, it is of great interest and necessity to elaborate the role of silanols because it is closely associated with tuning GaNsupport interactions, the particle size and dispersion of GaN, as well as its catalytic function.
Silicalite-1 is a pure silica zeolite with an MFI topology structure, in which silanols (Si-OH) are invariably concomitant owing to the presence of defects within the framework of a silica tetrahedral. (3133) Moreover, the density of silanols can be enriched through isomorphous substitution with heteroatom doping. (34,35) In the present work, Fe-doped silicalite-1 zeolite as a matrix was used to implant GaN nanocrystallites through a combined wet impregnation with in situ nitridation method. A series of spectroscopic characterizations were conducted to provide direct evidences for elucidating the role of isolated framework Fe atoms in the generation of interior silanol nests, tuning the particle size, and dispersion of GaN nanocrystallites with the binding structure of Si-O-GaN. Furthermore, the studies of the supported GaN catalysts in the reaction system of CO2 and C3H8 revealed that CO2-ODHP over GaN/Fe-silicalite-1 proceeds by following a two-step coupling process and is a structure-sensitive reaction characterized by the dependence of GaN particle size on the specific catalytic activity and apparent activation energy.

2.1. Materials
All chemical reagents were used without any purification. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic sodium (EDTA), Ga(NO3)3·xH2O (>99.9%), and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (>99.99%) were purchased from Macklin Inc., China. Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide solution (TPAOH, 25 wt % in water), tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), urea, and methanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All experimental gases were supplied by Tenglong Chemical Co., Ltd., China.
2.2. Support Preparation
The Fe-doped silicalite-1 was prepared according to a modified procedure reported by Xiao et al. (36) Typically, 0.5 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 0.45 g of EDTA were dissolved in 10 mL of water, and the resultant mixture as a parent solution was quantificationally taken in batches to mix with 12.2 g of the TPAOH aqueous solution under magnetic stirring for 1 h. Subsequently, 12.5 g of TEOS was added into the above mixture and continuously stirred for 6 h at room temperature, resulting in a clear solgel with a molar ratio of 1SiO2/(1/x)Fe/0.25TPAOH/30H2O (x = 100, 500, 1000, and 2000, representing the molar ratio of Si/Fe). The as-made solgel was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated in an oven at 180 C for 2 days. After cooling down to room temperature, the resultant products were centrifuged, washed with deionized water until it became neutral, and then dried at 100 C for 9 h. Finally, the as-prepared white solid powder was calcined at 550 C for 7 h, and the resulting Fe-doped silicalite-1 materials were denoted as x-Fe-silicalite-1 (x indicates the molar ratio of Si/Fe). As for the pristine silicalite-1, the preparation method was identical with that of Fe-silicalite-1 but without the addition of Fe species.
2.3. Catalyst Preparation
The catalysts of Fe-silicalite-1 supported GaN were prepared through a combined wet impregnation with in situ nitridation method according to our previous works. (27,28) Specifically, 0.95 g of x-Fe-silicalite-1 was impregnated with a 5 mL methanol solution containing 0.3 g of Ga(NO3)3·xH2O and 0.6 g of urea under sonication for 30 min. The resultant mixture was dried at 60 C for 6 h and then calcined in an N2 atmosphere at 800 C for 1 h with a heating rate of 1 C min1, during which GaN was in situ formed and simultaneously supported on x-Fe-silicalite-1. To remove potential carbon deposition derived from the carbonization of urea, the as-synthesized catalysts were further decarburized at 550 C in air for 2 h. To determine the content of GaN, a mixture of methanol solution containing 1.0 g of Ga(NO3)3·xH2O and 2.0 g of urea with the same mass ratio of 1:2 was processed in the absence of a support following the same procedures as those of the supported catalyst synthesis. This result showed that the loading of GaN was 5 wt % for catalysts of x-Fe-silicalite-1 supported GaN, which was further confirmed by XRF analysis (Table 1). Finally, these as-synthesized catalysts were named as 5GaN/x-Fe-silicalite-1. For comparison, a counterpart catalyst of Ga2O3/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 was also prepared according to the same procedure as that of 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 but without adding urea.

2.4. Characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 40 mA). The textural properties (specific surface area and pore volume) were determined by N2 physical adsorptiondesorption isotherms measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 instrument at 196 C. Prior to measurements, each of the samples was outgassed at 300 C for 8 h under a vacuum. The quantitative analysis of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) for the compositions of samples was conducted on an XRF-1800 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric (TGA) analyses were performed on a Q600 apparatus. The sample was heated from the room temperature to the target temperature at a ramping rate of 20 C min1 in air.
Ultravioletvisible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UVvis DRS) was recorded on a Lambda 950 spectrometer (PerkinElmer) with pure barium sulfate as a reference. In situ IR spectra under a vacuum were acquired on a Bruker-VERTEX 70 infrared spectrometer with a home-made quartz cell with CaF2 windows. The sample in the form of a self-supporting wafer was prepared using 5 mg of the sample mixed with 100 mg of KBr. The resultant wafer was then placed in an in situ quartz cell and pretreated at 400 C under continuous evacuation (ca. 2 × 101 Pa) for 2 h. Finally, IR spectra were collected when temperature was cooled to 200, 100, and 30 C, respectively. The IR spectra of pyridine adsorption were acquired using the same infrared spectrometer, in situ quartz cell, and pretreatment condition. Initially, a background spectrum was recorded on the sample at 100 C under a vacuum. Afterward, the pyridine was introduced into the in situ cell at the same temperature for 30 min, and then the evacuation treatment was conducted at 300 C for 30 min. When the in situ cell was cooled down to 100 C, the spectra were acquired and processed through subtracting the background spectrum. Solid-state 29Si MAS NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer. The Raman spectra were acquired on a micro confocal laser Raman spectrometer (InVia Reflex) equipped with an argon-ion laser at the excitation wavelength of 532 nm at 20 C. ID/IG represents the degree of graphitization of coke deposits and refers to the peak intensity ratio of the D peak and G peak in the Raman spectrum.
Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles were measured on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Each of the samples was initially pretreated in argon at 400 C for 1 h to remove any moisture and then cooled to 50 C. Afterward, the mixed gas composed of 10 vol % H2/Ar was introduced to reduce the sample from 50 to 1000 C with a heating rate of 10 C min1. SEM images were recorded on a Hitachi SU8220 field emission scanning electron microscopy equipped with an Ametek EDAX that provides the information of surface element distribution. High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) observation and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the representative catalyst were performed on a Tecnai G2 F20 with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image was recorded on a FEI Titan Cubed Themis G2 300 with an accelerating voltage of 300 kV.
Temperature-programmed desorption and mass spectra (TPD-MS) using C3H8 and CO2 as probe molecules were acquired on a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 instrument connected to an HPR QIC-20 mass spectrometer (Hiden Analytical, United Kingdom). Typically, 80 mg of the sample was pretreated at 400 C under a pure He flow (30 mL min1) for 30 min. When the temperature was cooled to 70 C, the resultant catalyst was saturated with pure C3H8 or CO2 (30 mL min1). Afterward, the sample was further purged by He for 1 h and subsequently heated to 700 C with a ramping rate of 10 C min1. The signals of the desorbed C3H8 (m/z = 29), C3H6 (m/z = 41), and H2 (m/z = 2), or CO2 (m/z = 44), CO (m/z = 28), and H2O (m/z = 18) were detected by MS and TCD. Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) experiments were performed on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 analyzer connected to a mass spectrometer (Hiden HPR-20). Typically, 50 mg of the catalyst was placed into a U-type quartz reactor and heated to 600 C for 30 min in He with a flow rate of 30 mL min1. Afterward, the gas was switched to the mixed gases composed of H2/CO2/He with a molar ratio of 1:1:3 and flow rate of 12 mL min1 at 100 C. After 60 min, the temperature was raised to 700 C with a heating rate of 10 C min1. The effluent gases were monitored by MS by scanning the fragments of CO2 (m/z = 44) and H2O (m/z = 18).
2.5. Catalytic Performance Test in CO2-ODHP
The catalytic reaction of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was conducted at a fixed-bed stainless-steel tubular reactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm and a length of 300 mm at atmospheric pressure. Typically, 200 mg of the catalyst (4060 mesh) was diluted with 200 mg (4060 mesh) of quartz sand and loaded into the constant temperature zone of the reactor. Before the reaction, the temperature of the catalyst bed was raised from ambient temperature to 600 C and maintained for 30 min in an N2 atmosphere with a flow rate of 30 mL min1. After the pretreatment and activation of the catalyst, 30 mL min1 of feed gases consisting of N2/CO2/C3H8 with a molar feed ratio of 25.5:3:1.5 was introduced into the reactor via a mass flow controller, leading to a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.88 h1 based on propane. The outlet products were identified and analyzed through an online gas chromatograph (GC-9560) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID) using HP-AL/KCL, a 5A molecular sieve, and a Porapak Q column. The quantitative calculation and definitions related to catalytic performance are as follows:
where Vm is the standard molar volume (22.4 L/mol), wcat is the weight of the catalyst, and STY is the spacetime yield of propylene (gC3H6 gcat1 h1). The normalized coke deposition is defined as the gram of the coke deposited per gram C3H8 converted in which Ui is the unit interval of time (Ui = 1 h), Qtotal C3H8 converted is the total amount of propane converted after 6 h, Conv.t, C3H8 is the propane conversion at the time of t, and Conv.0, C3H8 is the initial propane conversion. The deactivation rate (kd) was calculated based on the 6 h of time-on-stream, and it was derived from the assumption of this first-order deactivation model. (3739)
2.6. Computational Details
The electrostatic potential surfaces and interaction energy between zeolite and GaN were studied with the aid of the density functional theory (DFT). All the geometry optimizations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31g(d) theory level. (40) All the energies are calculated at the B3LYP/def2-TZVP theory level. (41) The cluster model was applied and truncated from the periodic structure of the MFI zeolite to simplify the calculation. Specifically, the cluster model of silicalite-1 contained 12 Si atoms, and the truncating sites were saturated with methyl groups to balance the overall charge. The cluster model of Fe-silicalite-1 was obtained by replacing one of the Si atoms with an Fe atom. As for the cluster models of the gallium nitride, the truncating sites were saturated by hydrogen atoms. Optimizations of the three cluster models were performed by fixing the truncating sites while other atoms were fully relaxed.
3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Characterization of Fe-Silicalite-1
Upon increasing the molar ratio of Si/Fe, all of as-prepared Fe-silicalite-1 supports showed the characteristic diffraction peaks of the MFI-type zeolite structure as compared with the pristine silicalite-1 and standard XRD data, but there was a decrease in the relative crystallinity, especially 100-Fe-silicalite-1 (Figure 1A and Table 1). From SEM images and grain size distributions (Figure 1B and Figure S1), the micromorphology of Fe-silicalite-1 supports shows regular and hexagonal prisms with uniform crystal shape and thickness (ca. 300 nm), except for 100-Fe-silicalite-1 with the quasi-ellipse crystals and increased particle size (403 nm) owing to surface aggregation at the high concentration of Fe doping. This phenomenon in the synthesis of Fe-MFI materials has also been observed in other analogous studies. (42,43) In addition, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (Figure S2) indicated that the incorporation of Fe atoms did not cause a profound effect on the microporosity and textural properties, as characterized by the similar specific surface area (SBET = 433464 m2 g1) and total pore volume (Vtotal = 0.290.35 cm3 g1), as listed in Table 1.

H2-TPR profiles (Figure S3) showed that there was no reduction peak appearing over 2000-Fe-silicalite-1 and 1000-Fe-silicalite-1, which is the same as the pristine silicalite-1. However, 500-Fe-silicalite-1 and 100-Fe-silicalite-1 gave rise to a broad peak with the maximum at 663 C, and the latter one also showed a discernible weak peak at 400 C. Figure S4 indicates that the reduction of the bulk Fe2O3 phase occurred in either a one-step or multistep process, which was dependent on the content of Fe2O3 and experimental parameters. A counterpart of Fe2O3/silicalite-1 with the same Fe loading as 2000-Fe-silicalite-1 showed a single reduction peak at 356 C, which could be ascribed to the one-step reduction from Fe3+ to Fe0 because Fe loading was low. (44,45) As for 500-Fe-silicalite-1 and 100-Fe-silicalite-1, the broad peak at 663 C might be attributable to the multistep reduction of extra-framework oligomeric FeOx species. Hence, it can be reasonably concluded that Fe atoms can be fully doped within the MFI framework when the high molar ratio of Si/Fe is regulated (e.g., 2000-Fe-silicalite-1).
The spectroscopic evidences for determining the location and distribution of Fe-atoms are demonstrated in Figure 2. As for UVvis DRS spectra (Figure 2A), there was no appreciable absorption band appearing on the pristine silicalite-1. After Fe doping, a broad absorption band with the maximum at 243 nm due to the isolated Fe3+-oxo sites in tetrahedral coordination was detected over all the supports of Fe-doped silicalite-1, (4648) and the intensity of this band increased significantly with the decrease in the molar ratio of Si/Fe. In addition, the counterpart of Fe2O3/silicalite-1 showed a very broad absorption band at the range of 350500 nm owing to the presence of oligomeric FeOx species. (49,50) By comparison, both 2000-Fe-silicalite-1 and 1000-Fe-silicalite-1 exhibited only one absorption band at 243 nm, whereas 500-Fe-silicalite-1 and 100-Fe-silicalite-1 also showed a weak band at 374 nm and a broad band at above 400 nm in addition to that band at 243 nm. Together with XRD and TPR results, it can be further confirmed that, in the cases of 2000-Fe-silicalite-1 and 1000-Fe-silicalite-1, Fe atoms were dominantly doped within the framework of silica tetrahedron via isomorphous substitution. However, the extra-framework oligomeric FeOx species were present on 500-Fe-silicalite-1 and 100-Fe-silicalite-1.

Figure 2. Spectroscopic characterization: (A) UVvis DRS spectra, (B) IR spectra in a vacuum recorded at ambient temperature, (C) IR spectra in a vacuum recorded at a high temperature, and (D) 29Si MAS NMR spectra.
The IR spectra under a vacuum via outgassing (Figure 2B) showed that there were two characteristic absorption bands with maxima at 3726 and 3438 cm1 assigned to the terminal silanols located within the interior surface of zeolite and hydrogen-bonded groups of silanol nests, respectively. (5155) Additionally, a weak band at 3675 cm1 corresponding to weakly hydrogen-bonded vicinal silanols was also discernible. (56,57) After the doping of Fe atoms, the broad band with the maximum at 3438 cm1 increased prominently, whereas the weak band at 3675 cm1 was almost unaltered. The absorption band at 3726 cm1 was also enhanced for 500-Fe-silicalite-1 and 100-Fe-silicalite-1, but it was inconspicuous for 2000-Fe-silicalite-1 and 1000-Fe-silicalite-1. In addition, it was worth noting that 100-Fe-silicalite-1 exhibited a weak band at 3608 cm1 that was ascribed to the Brnsted acidic bridging Si(OH)Fe groups, (5860) whose intensity seemed to be proportional to the content of Fe doping. As compared with the pristine silicalite-1, when IR spectra of 2000-Fe-silicalite-1 were recorded at high temperatures of 100 and 200 C (Figure 2C), the absorption band at 3726 cm1 was almost unchanged, but the absorption band at 3438 cm1 decreased and shifted to the range of high wavenumber (blue-shift), which was possibly due to the condensation of hydrogen-bonded silanols and water elimination caused by the heating treatment under a vacuum. (54) As a result, the incorporation of the isolated framework Fe atoms could cause the generation of more interior silanols and especially hydrogen-bonded groups of silanol nests within the silicalite-1 matrix.
The 29Si MAS NMR spectra are depicted in Figure 2D. As for the pristine silicalite-1, a small peak at 103.3 ppm was assigned to Q3 signals (Qn represents Si(OSi)n(OH)4-n), which was mainly derived from defects in the framework of silicalite-1. The resonance peak with the maximum at 112.4 along with a shoulder peak at 115.3 ppm was attributable to Q4 species at two different crystallographic sites. (6163) Interestingly, these peaks were not broadened after paramagnetic Fe3+ species were incorporated into silicalite-1, and slightly shifted up-field because of the electron shielded by the Fe atom as an electron donor. In addition, the shoulder peak of Q4 at 115.5 ppm (Si(OSi)4) and Q3 peak at 103.5 (overlap of Si(OSi)3(OH) and Si(OSi)3(OFe)) became more dominant as upon decreasing the molar ratio of Si/Fe (Table S1), (6466) indicating the formation of more defects within silica frameworks, which was in accordance with IR spectra.
3.2. Characterization of 5GaN/Fe-Silicalite-1
XRF analyses showed that the accurate content of gallium nitride loaded on 5GaN/x-Fe-silicalite-1 was almost at the same level of 4.24.86% (Table 1) and also close to the theoretical value of 5 wt %, confirming that GaN was retained by the zeolite during in situ synthesis. The XRD patterns showed that GaN nanocrystallites were highly dispersed on Fe-silicalite-1 supports because only those characteristic diffraction peaks of the MFI-type zeolite were detected rather than the GaN phase (Figure 3A). Textural properties (Table 1 and Figure S5) illustrated that these supported GaN catalysts still preserved the higher specific surface area (SBET = 361393 m2 g1) and total pore volume (Vtotal = 0.250.34 cm3 g1), indicating the presence of open and accessible active sites. SEM and element mapping images (Figure 3BF) showed that the micromorphology of the 5GaN/x-Fe-silicalite-1 catalyst was dependent on the molar ratio of Si/Fe. Among them, 5GaN/silicalite-1 without Fe doping presented a swarm of GaN nanoparticles with non-uniform distribution on the surface of silicalite-1 crystals. With the increase in the molar ratio of Si/Fe from 100 to 2000, the distribution and aggregation of GaN nanocrystallites became gradually better, of which both 5GaN/1000-Fe-silicalite-1 and 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 showed almost no discernable aggregates of GaN nanocrystallites except for those regular zeolite crystals (Figure 3E,F), especially 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1, suggesting very small particle size and high dispersion.

Figure 4 shows the high-resolution and spheroidal aberration corrected TEM images associated with the mean particle size distribution of GaN. Similar to that observed in SEM images, severe agglomeration of GaN nanocrystallites was present on 5GaN/silicalite-1 (Figure 4A), resulting in GaN size distribution not being able to be counted because of indistinguishable particles. Such agglomeration phenomenon could be further confirmed by recording HR-TEM images at different zones (Figure S6AC) and element mapping (Figure S6E), in which the crystalline phase of GaN was identified by lattice fringes of 2.76 and 2.43 Å corresponding to the (100) and (101) planes of GaN (Figure S6D). (67,68) Interestingly, once Fe was incorporated into silicalite-1, all of the resultant catalysts showed an improved dispersion associated with the decreased mean particle size of GaN. When the molar ratio of Si/Fe was tuned from 100 to 2000, the mean particle size decreased from 14.6  3.5 to 2.9  0.5 nm (Figure 4BE). In particular, 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 exhibited a uniform distribution of GaN on single crystals of Fe-silicalite-1, as displayed by the element mapping (Figure S6F). Moreover, the spheroidal aberration corrected HAADF-STEM image (Figure 4F) depicted the atomic structure of the silicalite-1 matrix and highly dispersed GaN sub-nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution of 2.7  0.4 nm, in accordance with that obtained from HR-TEM.

As shown in Figure 5A, IR spectra of 5GaN/x-Fe-silicalite-1 catalysts showed that, as compared with the pristine silicalite-1, the broad band with a maximum at 3432 cm1 decreased markedly and shifted to the range of low wavenumbers (the maximum peak at 3164 cm1) after loading GaN, indicating a consumption of hydrogen-bonded groups of silanol nests because of GaN nanocrystallites interacting with silanols (SiOGaN). In particular, this broad band almost disappeared for 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 no matter what temperatures were used to record IR spectra (Figure 5B), indicative of the complete consumption of hydrogen-bonded groups of silanol nests. In addition to the original band at 3726 cm1, there was a proximal band at 3745 cm1 assigned to those isolated silanols located on the external surface, which was probably because of the defects within the external framework of silicalite-1 generated during the process of GaN in situ synthesis at high temperatures. (48,53,54,69) In addition, as compared with silicalite-1 and GaN/silicalite-1, the absorption band at 3608 cm1 corresponding to Brnsted acidic bridging Si(OH)Fe groups became more prominent because Fe atoms doped within the silica framework caused increased negative charges and protonation in the silicalite-1 lattice. (35,59,70,71) As shown in Figure 5C, 29Si MAS NMR spectra of four representative catalysts showed that Q3 and Q4 signals slightly moved up-field with a shift of 0.1 ppm when GaN nanocrystallites were loaded, which was probably due to the shielding effect caused by electron transfer from oxygen to GaN. Furthermore, the relative content of the Q3 peak decreased and that of the asymmetric Q4 peak increased after the introduction of GaN, respectively (Table S1). These results confirmed the presence of interaction between GaN and silanols via the binding structure of SiOGaN.

3.3. Identification of Active Sites for the Adsorption of C3H8 and CO2
Figure 6 shows the profiles of CO2-TPD-MS and C3H8-TPD-MS. It can be seen that the adsorption of CO2 on silicalite-1 was negligible (Figure 6A), whereas the adsorption of C3H8 was discernible (as characterized by the desorption peak at 136 C) owing to the presence of weak acidity in silicalite-1 (Figure 6C). When Fe was doped within the framework of silicalite-1, two desorption peaks at 147 and 467 C were observed over 2000-Fe-silicalite-1, while the MS signals of CO and H2O were detected (Figure 6B). Since MS signals of CO might be disturbed by fragment ions of CO2, the reduction of CO2 into CO was thus not yet confirmed, but the adsorption of CO2 and dehydration of silanols were definitely present. After the loading of GaN, 5GaN/silicalite-1 showed that CO2 adsorption still was negligible but C3H8 adsorption was enhanced as evidenced by the desorption peaks at high temperatures (348412 C), while MS signals of C3H6 and H2 were intensified, especially for the latter (Figure 6D). As for 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1, both CO2 and C3H8 adsorptions were significantly enhanced along with the prominent MS signals of CO, H2O, C3H6, and H2. These results clearly indicated that Fe atoms doped within the framework of silicalite-1 were responsible for the adsorption of CO2, while nanostructured GaN was the active site for the adsorption and activation of C3H8.

3.4. Catalytic Performance
The catalytic performance of as-synthesized 5GaN/x-Fe-silicalite-1 was assessed in the CO2-ODHP reaction, and the resultant propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and yield are depicted in Figure S7. As compared with the supports of pristine silicalite-1 and Fe-doped silicalite-1, all of the supported GaN catalysts showed a prominent increase in propane conversion and propylene yield while presenting a regression on propylene selectivity, of which 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 gave the highest propylene yield of 35.2% after 6 h of time-on-stream (TOS). In addition, Figure S8 shows that the catalytic performance of CO2-ODHP over 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 was much better than that over the counterpart catalysts of bulk GaN, FeOx/silicalite-1, and Ga2O3/2000-Fe-silicalite-1. These apparent catalytic results indicate that those highly dispersed GaN nanocrystallites are the catalytically active species for the net reaction of CO2-ODHP. Correlating with the results of CO2- and C3H8-TPD-MS, the specific catalytic activity of 5GaN/x-Fe-silicalite-1 indexed by the normalized reaction rate and spacetime yield (STY) of propylene is demonstrated in Figure 7. Specifically, 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 showed the highest catalytic activity with a C3H8 consuming rate of 670 gC3H8·molGaN1·h1, a C3H6 formation rate of 500 gC3H6·molGaN1·h1, and the most stable propylene STY of 0.31 gC3H6·gcat1·h1 after 6 h of TOS. Noticeably, except for 5GaN/100-Fe-silicalite-1, all the rest of catalysts with Fe doping showed a higher catalytic activity than 5GaN/silicalite-1. Together with the poor activity obtained over FeOx/silicalite-1, it was thus concluded that the presence of extra-framework oligomeric FeOx or Fe2O3 nanoclusters was not desired for CO2-ODHP.

Figure S9 shows the effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of a set of representative catalysts. Upon increasing the reaction temperature, propane conversion and propylene yield increased over those supported GaN catalysts (5GaN/silicalite-1 and 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1), whereas both of them were still low and almost not dependent on the increasing reaction temperature for bulk GaN, silicalite-1, and 2000-Fe-silicalite-1. Moreover, the initial C3H8 consuming rate and C3H6 formation rate obtained over 5GaN/silicalite-1 and 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 increased progressively when reaction temperature was raised from 580 to 620 C (Figure 8A,B). Since the adsorption and activation of CO2 occurred on the isolated framework Fe sites, CO2 conversion obtained over 5GaN/x-Fe-silicalite-1 was further investigated (Figure S10). It can be seen that increasing the reaction temperature could promote the CO2 conversion, and 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 showed the best reactivity on CO2 conversion. Moreover, Figure 8C shows that the initial CO2 consuming rate increased with the increase in reaction temperature, especially for 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1.
Figure 8
Figure 8. Effect of reaction temperature on initial reaction rate (TOS = 0.5 h): (A) C3H8 consuming rate, (B) C3H6 formation rate, and (C) CO2 consuming rate.
As depicted in Figure 7 and Figure S7, all of 5GaN/x-Fe-silicalite-1 catalysts showed a slight decrease in propane conversion, propylene yield, and C3H6 formation rate in the course of the reaction proceeding, indicating a potential catalyst deactivation. The HR-TEM and spheroidal aberration corrected HAADF-STEM images associated with atomic mapping (Figure S11) showed that GaN nanocrystallites over the spent 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 after the 6 h test were still narrowly distributed with a mean size of 2.8  0.5 nm that was almost the same as that of the fresh catalyst (2.7  0.4 nm), from which the potentiality of GaN sintering can be ruled out. Furthermore, the deactivation rate constant (kd) was calculated based on the 6 h stability test under the assumption of the first-order kinetics model. (3739) The amount of coke deposition on catalysts was determined by TG analysis (Figure S12) and normalized per gram of propane converted (Figure 9A). Obviously, 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 exhibited the lowest kd of 0.095 h1 and the minimum amount of coke deposition (0.0116 gcoke gpropane1). In addition, upon increasing the molar ratio of Si/Fe, the resultant kd values were linearly dependent on the normalized amount of coke deposition (Figure 9B), indicating that the slight deactivation of the catalyst during the CO2-ODHP process was caused by carbon deposition that could be further confirmed by the tests of catalyst lifetime and regeneration (Figure S13).

4. General Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
4.1. The Formation Mechanism of GaN Nanocrystallites in Fe-Silicalite-1
The spectroscopic evidences revealed that Fe atoms could be doped into the MFI framework via regulating the molar ratio of Si/Fe, e.g., 2000-Fe-silicalite-1 and 1000-Fe-silicalite-1. The presence of isolated trivalent Fe atoms within the tetrahedral coordination through isomorphous substitution of Si atoms could create some additional interior silanols and especially hydrogen-bonded groups of silanol nests due to the formation of more defects (Figure 2B). When GaN nanocrystallites were in situ formed and embedded into the Fe-silicalite-1 matrix, those hydrogen-bonded groups of silanol nests were consumed adequately (Figure 5A), indicating a potential interaction between GaN and silanols. To further confirm this speculation, the electrostatic potential (ESP) surfaces and interaction energy between MFI zeolite and GaN were studied with the aid of DFT. The cluster models for calculation were truncated from the periodic structure and are shown in Figure S14. As shown in Figure 10A, the red iso-surfaces represented the electron-rich zone, while the blue iso-surfaces represented the electron-deficient zone. It was clear that both the deprotonated hydroxyl oxygen atoms (SiO) of pristine silicalite-1 and Fe-silicalite-1 were electron-rich sites. The Ga atoms on the model surface of GaN cluster were electron deficient as the iso-surfaces around were blue. Thus, those silanols (SiOH) located in both of them tend to bond with GaN at the Ga site. Notably, a migration of proton to the oxygen was observed in Fe-silicalite-1 (Figure S14E), resulting in the Brnsted acidic bridging Si(OH)Fe groups. Moreover, the interaction energy of SiOGaN in pristine silicalite-1 and Fe-silicalite-1 was 60.6 and 88.5 kcal/mol (Figure 10B), respectively, suggesting an enhanced strength of the interaction through Fe doping within the MFI framework adjacent to silanols.

Figure 10C shows the IR spectra of pyridine adsorbed on Fe-doped and pristine silicalite-1. Obviously, all supports exhibited two bands at 1597 and 1446 cm1 that were attributed to the interaction of pyridine with hydrogen-bonded groups of silanol nests, of which the latter band at 1446 cm1 was ascribed to the stretching vibration of pyridine coordinated to Lewis acid sites (PyL). (59,72,73) Considering that the pristine silicalite-1 also showed a Lewis acid character, it was thus assumed that these Lewis acid sites were mainly ascribed to the highly distorted siloxane bonds having a partial electron delocalization. (73,74) Furthermore, their intensities increased as the content of Fe doping increased, being an evidence of increasing hydrogen-bonded groups of silanol nests, which were consistent with the IR spectra under a vacuum in the range of 30003800 cm1 (Figure 2B). Interestingly, only 100-Fe-silicalite-1 gave two bands at 1546 and 1490 cm1 that were due to the pyridinium ion (PyH+) and joint contribution of both Lewis and Brnsted acidic sites, (73,75) respectively. This result confirms further the presence of Brnsted acidic bridging Si(OH)Fe groups, which is in line with the band at 3608 cm1 observed in IR spectra (Figure 2B) and DFT calculations (Figure S14E). For comparison, two counterparts of 0.14FeOx/silicalite-1 and 1.31FeOx/silicalite-1, with the same Fe content as the supports of 2000-Fe-silicalite-1 and 100-Fe-silicalite-1, respectively, but without the framework Fe atoms, did not show the character of a Brnsted acidic site. Since the extra-framework oligomeric FeOx species are present on 100-Fe-silicalite-1, it is thus proposed that Brnsted acidic sites (H+) are derived from the proton transfer from the hydroxyl of silanols when it interacts with extra-framework FeOx species.
IR spectra of pyridine adsorbed on the supported GaN catalysts are shown in Figure 10D. Notably, bulk GaN is a non-acidic material because there is no adsorption of pyridine. In comparison with pristine silicalite-1, 5GaN/silicalite-1 showed that two bands at 1597 and 1446 cm1 were broadened and associated with small shoulder bands, indicating the formation of new types of weak Lewis acid sites. In the cases of 5GaN/x-Fe-silicalite-1, however, in addition to those original bands observed on supports, there was a set of new bands appearing at 1620 and 1456 cm1 that were assigned to the stretching vibration of pyridine coordinated to other types of Lewis acid sites (e.g., Fe or Ga cations). (76) In addition, it was interesting to note that two bands at 1546 and 1490 cm1 became more prominent after the loading of GaN, indicating an increased abundance of Brnsted acidic bridging Si(OH)Fe groups. Correlating with the IR characteristic of 100-Fe-silicalite-1, it is consequently reasonable to conclude that the origin of Brnsted acidic sites (H+) is due to the interaction between silanols and extra-framework species (FeOx or GaN), which results in a proton transfer from silanols to the oxygen atoms of SiOFe bridging (Figure 10E).
Considering that the formation of GaN nanocrystallites employs the precursors of Ga(NO3)3·xH2O and urea in an N2 atmosphere at a high temperature (800 C) through a combined wet impregnation with in situ nitridation method, the diffusion, migration, anchoring, and speciation of Ga ions (Ga3+) in the zeolite matrix are important to elucidate the distribution of GaN. The foregoing spectroscopic characterization reveals that Fe-doped silicalite-1 is rich in the terminal silanols located within the interior surface and especially hydrogen-bonded groups of silanol nests (Figure 2B). Because the solvated Ga3+ ions are too large to enter the micropores of the MFI-type zeolite, (77,78) the direct interaction of silanols in pores with Ga3+ during wet impregnation is very limited. By correlating with the results of DFT calculation and IR spectra, it is thus proposed that these solvated Ga3+ ions are initially adsorbed into the interior surface defects and hydrogen-bonded groups of silanol nests by means of interacting with silanols and then are transformed into Ga-oxide clusters through de-solvation at elevated temperatures. When the temperature reaches 800 C, these Ga-oxide clusters react with the surrounding urea to generate GaN via in situ nitridation in an N2 atmosphere. Finally, GaN as synthesized is anchored within the interior defects of the Fe-silicalite-1 matrix via the binding structure of SiOGaN. The formation mechanism of GaN nanocrystallites is illustrated in Scheme 1.
Scheme 1

Additionally, the dispersion and particle size distribution of GaN nanocrystallites can be tuned from the nanoscale to sub-nanoscale via regulating the molar ratio of Si/Fe (Figure 4), in which GaN interacting with those hydrogen-bonded groups of silanol nests plays an important role. It is worth noting that the presence of extra-framework oligomeric FeOx species, e.g., 5GaN/100-Fe-silicalite-1 and 5GaN/500-Fe-silicalite-1, gives rise to the poor dispersion and large particle size even though the surface density of silanols and defects seems to be enriched with the increase in the content of Fe. IR spectra of pyridine adsorption (Figure 10C) reveal that extra-framework FeOx species also have access to interact with silanols. However, the consumption degree of hydrogen-bonded groups of silanol nests interacting with FeOx species is limited because the characteristic bands of these silanol nests are visible in Figure 2B. In addition, the residual silanol nests are still abundant in 5GaN/100-Fe-silicalite-1 and 5GaN/500-Fe-silicalite-1 (Figure 5A). These results point to the fact that the presence of an interaction between extra-framework FeOx and silanol nests limits the accessibility of Ga3+ ions, which is probably due to the electrostatic repulsion in the microenvironment of silanol nests coordinated with Fe3+ cations. As a consequence, Ga-oxide clusters are mainly distributed on the external surface of Fe-silicalite-1 rather than in interior surface defects after wet impregnation and de-solvation. (78) Upon nitridation at high temperatures, some large agglomerates of GaN with poor dispersion are deposited on the external surface of the zeolite matrix. Thus, it can be concluded that those interior surface defects with enriched hydrogen-bonded groups of silanol nests caused by Fe doping within the MFI framework are the most livable microenvironment to accommodate GaN particles with sub-nanometric size and high dispersion.
4.2. Role of Fe Doping in Enhancing Catalytic Performance
To confirm the occurrence of the RWGS reaction during the CO2-ODHP process, TPSR tests of CO2 and H2 were conducted over 5GaN/silicalite-1 and 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1, and the results are shown in Figure 11. With the increase in the reaction temperature to the operating temperature of CO2-ODHP (600 C), the MS intensity of CO2 decreased progressively and the intensity of H2O increased over 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1, whereas both of them were not prominent over 5GaN/silicalite-1. Hence, this result further proves that those isolated Fe atoms within the MFI framework could effectively catalyze RWGS. In addition, Figure S15 shows a comparison study in the CO2-ODHP and DDP reaction using 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 as the catalyst. The system of CO2-ODHP showed higher propane conversion and propylene yield than the DDP reaction, and the weight of coke deposition in CO2-ODHP was lower than that in DDP according to TG analysis and Raman spectra. Combined with the results of coke deposition and deactivation rate (Figure 9), it thus was proposed that the presence of the reverse Boudouard reaction over 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 made a contribution in part to remove surface coke on the catalyst.
Figure 11
Figure 11. The TPSR tests of RWGS over 5GaN/silicalite-1 and 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1. MS signal of (A) CO2 and (B) H2O.
Figure 12 shows the Arrhenius plots of a set of representative catalysts. Based on the C3H8 consuming rate and C3H6 formation rate, the apparent activation energy (Ea) over 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 was 57.4  3.9 and 58.1  2.2 kJ/mol, respectively, and both of them were lower than those obtained over 5GaN/silicalite-1 and bulk GaN (Figure 12A,B). This result showed that the supported GaN with a sub-nanometric size was more active and effective for CO2-ODHP than bulk and agglomerated GaN. In addition, the apparent activation energy separately determined by the C3H8 consuming rate and C3H6 formation rate was similar, and thus, it was reasonably assumed that other side reactions with the participation of propane, e.g., propane cracking and dry reforming. were negligible over these supported GaN catalysts. Because CO2 adsorption occurred on framework Fe sites according to the results of CO2-TPD-MS (Figure 6A,B), the apparent activation energy of converting CO2 over 5GaN/x-Fe-silicalite-1 catalysts based on the CO2 consuming rate was determined, and it decreased from 155.5  27.8 to 116.4  4.3 kJ/mol with the increase in the molar ratio of Si/Fe from 100 to 2000 (Figure 12C).This result suggests that those isolated Fe atoms within the framework are more active than extra-framework oligomeric FeOx for converting CO2.

(D) The correlation of GaN particle size with catalytic activity and apparent activation energy. The particle size of GaN on 5GaN/silicalite-1 was roughly determined to be 23 nm based on a few of particles in Figure 4A and Figure S6AC.
The correlations of GaN particle size with the catalytic activity and apparent activation energy were plotted, as shown in Figure 12D. The catalyst of 5GaN/100-Fe-silicalite-1 with 14.6  3.5 nm (rectangle with dotted line in Figure 12D), because of the presence of extra-framework oligomeric FeOx species, gave a lower catalytic activity than that over 5GaN/silicalite-1 with a larger size (23 nm). In addition to that one, other 5GaN/x-Fe-silicalite-1 catalysts showed that the C3H8 consuming rate and C3H6 formation rate decreased, while the apparent activation energy of converting both C3H8 and CO2 increased as the particle size of GaN nanocrystallites increased. Moreover, it was interesting that the increasing trend in propylene selectivity was different with the changes in propane conversion and propylene yield over the supported GaN (Figures S7, S8, S13, and S14A), which was also consistent with the previous experimental results of supported Pt-based catalysts. (79) DFT calculations revealed that the stepped Pt surfaces were active centers for all the reactions, and propylene preferred dehydrogenation to desorption on the stepped Pt surfaces at the initial stage. With the progression of deep dehydrogenation and cracking, however, the active center was transferred from a stepped to a flat surface due to the deposition of coke, and thus, propylene desorption was promoted and deep dehydrogenation was suppressed simultaneously on the flat Pt surfaces, resulting in an increased propylene selectivity. (80,81) Likewise, the supported GaN nanocrystallites with the binding structure of SiOGaN are active centers for the generation of propylene and the nonselective products (e.g., ethane, methane, and coke). The coke deposition on the nanostructured GaN surface enables the initial active sites with higher reactivity (e.g., corners, steps and edges) to transform into those flat or terrace sites with lower reactivity, where nonselective cracking and deep dehydrogenation become unfavorable. leading to an increased selectivity toward propylene. In other words, nonselective propane cracking is faster than selective dehydrogenation of propane over the fresh active sites (at the initial reaction stage), whereas this trend is reversed once the coke is deposited on the surface of GaN nanocrystallites. Together with the dependence of GaN particle size on the catalytic activity and apparent activation energy, it can be proposed that the overall CO2-ODHP reaction was structure sensitive over nanostructured GaN, which was probably related to the potential presence of other structure-sensitive reactions (e.g., DDP, CO2 hydrogenation, and reverse Boudouard).

5. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In summary, a set of catalysts of Fe-silicalite-1 supported GaN was synthesized and investigated in the CO2-ODHP reaction. Characterization results revealed that the isolated Fe atoms doped into the MFI framework could create more interior silanols and especially hydrogen-bonded groups of silanol nests. These silanols had access to interact with the Ga precursors and urea, in which the highly dispersed GaN with the binding structure of SiOGaN was in situ generated and embedded in the defects of the Fe-silicalite-1 matrix. Moreover, the particle size distribution of GaN can be tuned from the nanoscale to sub-nanoscale by regulating the molar ratio of Si/Fe. Combining TPSR results with the measurements of C3H8- and CO2-TPD-MS, it was proposed that nanostructured GaN was responsible for adsorption and activation of C3H8, while those isolated framework Fe atoms were active sites for the catalytic conversion of CO2. Catalytic results and kinetics showed that CO2-ODHP on GaN/Fe-silicalite-1 proceeded by following the mechanism of a two-step coupling process, and it was a structure-sensitive reaction. The dependence of GaN particle size on the catalytic activity and apparent activation energy indicates that 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 with the minimum size of 2.7  0.4 nm is the best catalyst. In addition, 5GaN/2000-Fe-silicalite-1 showed a good anti-sintering ability because of the strong interaction and confinement in the Fe-silicalite-1 matrix. The linear correlation between deactivation rate and normalized amount of coke deposition confirmed the reason of the slight loss of catalytic activity.
