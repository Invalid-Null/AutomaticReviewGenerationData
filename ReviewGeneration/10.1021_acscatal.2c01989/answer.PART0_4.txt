[1] "Since CO2 as a soft oxidant is introduced into the feeds, the formation of propylene might proceed via a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation or two-step coupling process involving the direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) even though their net reactions are the same."  
  
[2] "The catalytic reaction of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was conducted at a fixed-bed stainless-steel tubular reactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm and a length of 300 mm at atmospheric pressure."

2. The article explains that catalysts can facilitate propane dehydrogenation through a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway with CO2 as a soft oxidant, or through a two-step coupling process involving direct dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse water gas shift reaction. It provides experimental details on testing CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in a fixed-bed reactor.
