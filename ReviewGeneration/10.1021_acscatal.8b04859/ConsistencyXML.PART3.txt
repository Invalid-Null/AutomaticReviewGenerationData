To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the answers provided in each file to the correct answers. For questions where the answers matched the correct answer stating that the article did not contain information relevant to the question, I assigned 100% consistency. For question 3 in file answer.PART3_3.txt, the provided answer incorrectly states that the article investigates catalyst preparation methods, so I assigned 0% consistency for that question. All other questions were answered consistently with the correct answers.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
