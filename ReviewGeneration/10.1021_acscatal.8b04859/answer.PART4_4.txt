 Unfortunately this literature does not contain any relevant quotes or information to answer the questions provided. The questions seem focused on propane dehydrogenation catalysis, catalyst characterization techniques, process safety, techno-economic analysis, and transformational catalyst design. However, the literature is a study on catalytic fast pyrolysis of furan with in situ dehydrogenation of propane over ZSM-5 and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts. It does not substantially discuss the topics asked about in the questions.
