[1] "A strategy to develop more stable platinum catalysts has relied on the preparation of bimetallic systems that include various promoter elements (e.g., Cu, Zn, Ga, In, Ge, Sn, etc.) to enhance the stability and selectivity of platinum in PDH."

[2] "The primary preparation method for bimetallic GaPt catalysts, and others, has relied on sequential impregnations of oxide supports, (912) including modified-hydrotalictes, (1319) followed by a reduction step yielding reduced surface species." 

[3] "An alternative approach for developing well-defined PDH catalysts has relied on the synthesis of single-site catalysts, either prepared through electrostatic adsorption methods (2024) or through a two-step approach combining surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) (2529) and the thermolytic molecular precursor approach (TMP)."

[4] "Herein, we describe the synthesis of a bimetallic GaPt system prepared through grafting a platinum precursor onto the surface of silica containing gallium single-sites."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses strategies such as preparing bimetallic systems with promoter elements, sequential impregnations of oxide supports, synthesizing single-site catalysts through electrostatic adsorption or surface organometallic chemistry, and grafting a platinum precursor onto silica containing gallium single-sites.

[1] "Monitoring generation of the reduced species, Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2, via in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals formation of a GaxPt (0.5 < x < 0.9) alloy with a fraction of gallium remaining as isolated sites."

[2] "To investigate the structural stability of the Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 system during PDH, additional in situ XAS measurements were performed. Under catalytic conditions, no changes in the XANES spectra at the Ga K-edge or Pt L3-edge were evident, indicating minimal change of the catalyst structure over the duration of the XAS measurements (6 h)."

[1] "XPS measurements were also performed to investigate the atomic composition and state of each component in the reduced bimetallic material. These measurements confirm nearly equal atomic ratios of gallium and platinum in the reduced material (Ga 3d, 0.48%; Pt 4f7/2, 0.51%)."

[2] "The Pt 4f7/2 spectra contains a single peak at 71.6 eV; this is 0.3 eV higher in energy compared to the Pt 4f7/2 spectra of Pt0/SiO2, which displays a single peak at 71.3 eV. The higher electron binding energy can be attributed to the formation of an intermetallic alloy during the reduction process, which was further investigated by examining the Ga 2p3/2 spectra."

[3] "This shows an asymmetric peak, which was fitted with two peaks at 1119.0 and 1117.2 eV. The former peak contributes to ca. 10% of the signal and is similar to XPS measurements performed on GaIII/SiO2 (1119.1 eV). This observation is in agreement with pyridine adsorption studies and is consistent with a fraction of gallium remaining as single-sites."

6. Yes, the article uses XPS to probe oxidation state changes during reduction to form the propane dehydrogenation catalyst. It shows a shift to higher binding energy for Pt 4f and lower binding energy for Ga 2p, indicating reduction of Pt and Ga species and formation of an alloy. A small Ga 2p peak remains indicating some gallium single sites persist.
