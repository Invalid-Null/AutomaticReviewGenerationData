 Based on the provided text and comparative files, here is the summary of consistency ratios for each question and answer file:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "90%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "50%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "80%"}, 
  "5": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "90%"},
