[1] "A strategy to develop more stable platinum catalysts has relied on the preparation of bimetallic systems that include various promoter elements (e.g., Cu, Zn, Ga, In, Ge, Sn, etc.) to enhance the stability and selectivity of platinum in PDH."

[2] "The primary preparation method for bimetallic GaPt catalysts, and others, has relied on sequential impregnations of oxide supports, (912) including modified-hydrotalictes, (1319) followed by a reduction step yielding reduced surface species."  

[3] "An alternative approach for developing well-defined PDH catalysts has relied on the synthesis of single-site catalysts, either prepared through electrostatic adsorption methods (2024) or through a two-step approach combining surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) (2529) and the thermolytic molecular precursor approach (TMP)."

[4] "Herein, we describe the synthesis of a bimetallic GaPt system prepared through grafting a platinum precursor onto the surface of silica containing gallium single-sites."
</Quotes>

<English>
The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion.

[1] "The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra are shown in Figure 2."

[2] "In situ XAS measurements were performed. Under catalytic conditions, no changes in the XANES spectra at the Ga K-edge or Pt L3-edge were evident, indicating minimal change of the catalyst structure over the duration of the XAS measurements (6 h)." 
</Quotes>

<English>
The article utilizes in-situ XAS to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It monitors XANES spectra at the Ga K-edge and Pt L3-edge during catalysis, showing minimal structural changes over 6 hours.

[1] "XPS measurements were also performed to investigate the atomic composition and state of each component in the reduced material."

[2] "The Pt 4f7/2 spectra contains a single peak at 71.6 eV; this is 0.3 eV higher in energy compared to the Pt 4f7/2 spectra of Pt0/SiO2, which displays a single peak at 71.3 eV."

[3] "This peak is 1.8 eV lower in electron binding energy and is consistent with the presence of reduced Gaδ+."
