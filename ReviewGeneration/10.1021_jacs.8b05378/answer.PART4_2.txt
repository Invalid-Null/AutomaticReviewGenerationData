<quotes>
[1] "Dehydrogenation of lightweight alkanes is an extremely energy intensive process largely due to a high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 137 and 124 kJ mol1 for C2H6 and C3H8, respectively), necessitating high reaction temperatures."

[2] "Consequently, the operating conditions present major challenges for catalyst stability and selectivity."  

[3] "The primary industrial technologies operated for direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are CrO3/Al2O3 (CB&I Lummus Catofin process) and PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex process). Both catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation and require frequent regeneration as often as 1520 min for the industrial chromium catalysts."

[4] "Hence, the development of more stable and robust catalysts with less frequent regeneration cycles is currently of major research interest."
