[1] "An alternative approach for developing well-defined PDH catalysts has relied on the synthesis of single-site catalysts, either prepared through electrostatic adsorption methods (2024) or through a two-step approach combining surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) (2529) and the thermolytic molecular precursor approach (TMP)."

[2] "We have previously developed several single-site catalysts, M/SiO2 (M = CrIII, CoII, and GaIII), for PDH using the latter strategy." 

[3] "This provides means of tuning or enhancing chemical reactivity and selectivity of the catalytic systems as well as introducing unique stabilizing features for the nanoparticles."

[1] "The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra are shown in Figure 2. Prior to reduction, the XANES spectra of GaIIIPtII/SiO2 at the gallium K-edge and platinum L3-edge are similar to GaIII/SiO2 and [(SiO)Pt(OSi(OtBu)3)(COD)] (PtII/SiO2) with edge energies of 10373.9 and 11566.0 eV, respectively."

[2] "Upon treatment of GaIIIPtII/SiO2 to 550 C under 1 atm of H2 (10 mL/min), a decrease in edge-energy at the gallium K-edge from 10374.3 to 10369.2 eV is observed." 

[3] "Under catalytic conditions, no changes in the XANES spectra at the Ga K-edge or Pt L3-edge were evident, indicating minimal change of the catalyst structure over the duration of the XAS measurements (6 h)."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It monitors changes in XANES spectra at the Ga K-edge and Pt L3-edge during catalyst reduction and propane dehydrogenation. The data reveals minimal structural changes during catalysis over 6 hours.

[1] "XPS measurements were also performed to investigate the atomic composition and state of each component in the reduced material." 

[2] "The Pt 4f7/2 spectra contains a single peak at 71.6 eV; this is 0.3 eV higher in energy compared to the Pt 4f7/2 spectra of Pt0/SiO2, which displays a single peak at 71.3 eV. The higher electron binding energy can be attributed to the formation of an intermetallic alloy during the reduction process, which was further investigated by examining the Ga 2p3/2 spectra."

[3] "Considering both the Pt 4f7/2 and Ga 2p3/2 XPS spectra, the reduction process yields a reduced material, Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2, containing nanometric bimetallic GaxPty (x < y) particles along with a fraction of GaIII single-sites."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe oxidation state changes during reduction to form the propane dehydrogenation catalyst. The XPS data reveals formation of an intermetallic GaxPty alloy along with some remaining GaIII single sites after H2 reduction.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
