[1] "A strategy to develop more stable platinum catalysts has relied on the preparation of bimetallic systems that include various promoter elements (e.g., Cu, Zn, Ga, In, Ge, Sn, etc.) to enhance the stability and selectivity of platinum in PDH."

[2] "The primary preparation method for bimetallic GaPt catalysts, and others, has relied on sequential impregnations of oxide supports, (912) including modified-hydrotalictes, (1319) followed by a reduction step yielding reduced surface species."

[3] "While synthetically straightforward and yielding improved catalytic performances, these approaches have led to difficulty in identifying the active sites due to low quantities of active species associated with the presence of large amounts of bulk species." 

[4] "An alternative approach for developing well-defined PDH catalysts has relied on the synthesis of single-site catalysts, either prepared through electrostatic adsorption methods (2024) or through a two-step approach combining surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) (2529) and the thermolytic molecular precursor approach (TMP)."

[5] "We have previously developed several single-site catalysts, M/SiO2 (M = CrIII, CoII, and GaIII), for PDH using the latter strategy."

Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses bimetallic systems with promoter elements to enhance platinum stability and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. It notes that traditional sequential impregnation methods lead to difficulty identifying active sites due to low quantities of active species and large amounts of bulk species. As an alternative, the article discusses preparation of single-site catalysts using surface organometallic chemistry and thermolytic molecular precursor approaches, which the authors have used previously to develop Cr, Co, and Ga single-site catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

答:这篇文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它讨论了包含促进元素的双金属体系,以增强丙烷脱氢中铂的稳定性和选择性。它指出传统的顺序浸渍法导致难以识别活性位点,因为活性物种的数量很低,而大量的体相存在。作为替代方案,这篇文章讨论了使用表面有机金属化学和热解分子前体方法制备单点位催化剂,作者以前使用这些方法开发了丙烷脱氢的Cr、Co和Ga单点位催化剂。

[1] "The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra are shown in Figure 2. Prior to reduction, the XANES spectra of GaIIIPtII/SiO2 at the gallium K-edge and platinum L3-edge are similar to GaIII/SiO2 and [(SiO)Pt(OSi(OtBu)3)(COD)] (PtII/SiO2) with edge energies of 10373.9 and 11566.0 eV, respectively."

[2] "Upon treatment of GaIIIPtII/SiO2 to 550 C under 1 atm of H2 (10 mL/min), a decrease in edge-energy at the gallium K-edge from 10374.3 to 10369.2 eV is observed. The profile and white line intensity varies significantly in comparison to the spectrum of GaIII/SiO2 exposed to H2 flow (Figure 2a)."

[3] "The platinum L3-edge was also investigated during the reduction of GaIIIPtII/SiO2, indicating a decrease in energy from 11566.0 to 11564.7 eV and a decrease in the white line intensity, fully consistent with the reduction of platinum."

[4] "Under catalytic conditions, no changes in the XANES spectra at the Ga K-edge or Pt L3-edge were evident, indicating minimal change of the catalyst structure over the duration of the XAS measurements (6 h)."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article utilizes in-situ XANES and EXAFS to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It examines changes at the Ga K-edge and Pt L3-edge during reduction of the GaPt catalyst, showing decreases in edge energies and white line intensities consistent with reduction to metallic species. Under reaction conditions, the XANES spectra show minimal changes, indicating stable catalyst structure during propane dehydrogenation over 6 hours.

<Chinese version answer>
答:这篇文章利用原位XANES和EXAFS技术来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它研究了在GaPt催化剂还原过程中Ga K边和Pt L3边的变化,显示边缘能量和白线强度的下降与还原成金属物种一致。在反应条件下,XANES光谱显示最小变化,表明催化剂结构在6小时的丙烷脱氢过程中保持稳定。
