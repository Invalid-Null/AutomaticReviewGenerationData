[1] "Herein, we describe the synthesis of a bimetallic GaPt system prepared through grafting a platinum precursor onto the surface of silica containing gallium single-sites."

[2] "The bimetallic system GaIIIPtII/SiO2 was then subjected to reduction at 500 C under a flow of H2 at 1 atm for 12 h." 

[3] "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the presence of nanometric particles with a narrow size distribution (1.0 ± 0.2 nm, Figure 1b)."

[1] "XPS measurements were also performed to investigate the atomic composition and state of each component in the reduced material."

[2] "The Pt 4f7/2 spectra contains a single peak at 71.6 eV; this is 0.3 eV higher in energy compared to the Pt 4f7/2 spectra of Pt0/SiO2, which displays a single peak at 71.3 eV." 

[3] "This peak is 1.8 eV lower in electron binding energy and is consistent with the presence of reduced Gaδ+."
