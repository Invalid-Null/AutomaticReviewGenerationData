[1] "A strategy to develop more stable platinum catalysts has relied on the preparation of bimetallic systems that include various promoter elements (e.g., Cu, Zn, Ga, In, Ge, Sn, etc.) to enhance the stability and selectivity of platinum in PDH."

[2] "The controlled development of well-defined multicomponent heterogeneous systems that possess long-term stability remains both a promising avenue for catalyst design and a synthetic challenge."

[3] "An alternative approach for developing well-defined PDH catalysts has relied on the synthesis of single-site catalysts, either prepared through electrostatic adsorption methods or through a two-step approach combining surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) and the thermolytic molecular precursor approach (TMP)."

[1] "Monitoring generation of the reduced species, Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2, via in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals formation of a GaxPt (0.5 < x < 0.9) alloy with a fraction of gallium remaining as isolated sites."

[2] "Additional in situ XAS measurements were performed under catalytic conditions, no changes in the XANES spectra at the Ga K-edge or Pt L3-edge were evident, indicating minimal change of the catalyst structure over the duration of the XAS measurements (6 h)."

[1] "XPS measurements were also performed to investigate the atomic composition and state of each component in the reduced bimetallic material. These measurements confirm nearly equal atomic ratios of gallium and platinum in the reduced material (Ga 3d, 0.48%; Pt 4f7/2, 0.51%)."

[2] "In situ XAS measurements were performed. Prior to reduction, the XANES spectra of GaIIIPtII/SiO2 at the gallium K-edge and platinum L3-edge are similar to GaIII/SiO2 and [(SiO)Pt(OSi(OtBu)3)(COD)] (PtII/SiO2) with edge energies of 10373.9 and 11566.0 eV, respectively. Upon treatment of GaIIIPtII/SiO2 to 550 C under 1 atm of H2 (10 mL/min), a decrease in edge-energy at the gallium K-edge from 10374.3 to 10369.2 eV is observed."
