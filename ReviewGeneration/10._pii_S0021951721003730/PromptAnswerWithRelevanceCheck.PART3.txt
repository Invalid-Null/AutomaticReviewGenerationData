[1] The structure of the silanol groups in the synthesized zeolites was investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy. The OH-stretching bands are normally observed in the frequency region of 3100–3900 cm−1, varying according to the interactions between the silanols [47], [48], [49]. The IR spectra of the four zeolites are presented in Fig. 3. 

[2] Moreover, the structure of the silanol groups in the synthesized zeolites was investigated by 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy after adsorption of trimethylphosphine (TMP) as a base to titrate acidic sites in MZ samples [50]. The 31P NMR spectra showed three peaks with the chemical shifts of 59, 34 and 3 ppm with respect to the signal of phosphoric acid. These peaks can be assigned to physisorbed TMP, TMP associated with Lewis acid sites, and TMP interacting with Brønsted acid sites [i.e., (CH3)3P−H+], respectively (Fig. S4) [51].

[3] The HAADF-STEM images in Fig. 5 were obtained after increasing the metal loading to 4.0 wt% Pt and 4.0 wt% Y for the purpose of STEM investigation. As these images show, the metal particles in PtY(4)/MZ-sf-Br increased to approximately 3 nm in diameter. In these larger particles, the L12 superlattice of the Pt3Y-type intermetallic compound was observed (Fig. 5c). 

[4] The alloy nanoparticles exhibited fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, whereas the monometallic Pt nanoparticles showed only partially reversible chemisorption (40–50% reversibility) due to the formation of a strong Pt-H bond [56]. It appears that there is a significant modification of the electronic state of Pt upon intermetallic compound formation, which resulted in a distinct change in the hydrogen adsorption properties on the metal surface.

5. Yes, the article employs FT-IR spectroscopy, 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy, HAADF-STEM, and hydrogen chemisorption to characterize the structure of silanol groups, metal-support interface, and electronic state changes in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. For example, FT-IR and NMR were used to confirm the presence of silanol nests. HAADF-STEM imaged the Pt3Y alloy structure. Hydrogen chemisorption probed the modification of Pt's electronic state upon alloying.

23. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. The article discusses preparing Pt-Y alloy nanoparticles in mesoporous MFI zeolites and shows they exhibit high catalytic durability for propane dehydrogenation compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. Relevant data includes Figure 6 showing conversion versus time for Pt-Y alloy catalysts supported on different zeolites, demonstrating dramatically increased lifetime compared to Pt alone. The formation of intermetallic Pt3Y nanoparticles is enabled by the presence of silanol nests in the zeolite, which provide isolated sites to disperse and reduce Y atoms.

</English version answer>

23. 是的,该文章评估了金属封装到分子筛支撑剂中,以增强丙烷脱氢催化剂的稳定性。该文介绍了在介孔MFI分子筛中制备Pt-Y合金纳米粒子,并表明与单金属Pt催化剂相比,它们在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出高催化活性。相关的数据包括图6,其显示了不同分子筛支撑的Pt-Y合金催化剂的转化率随时间的变化,证明与仅Pt相比,催化剂的使用寿命大大延长。Pt3Y金属间化合物纳米粒子的形成是由分子筛中的硅醇巢提供的隔离位点来分散和还原Y原子所促成的。

[1] “The alloy nanoparticles were prepared by impregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Y(NO3)3 , followed by calcination in O2 and reduction with H2. This conventional method is often used to support metal catalysts that are reducible with H2 (i.e., elements with a sufficiently high reduction potential), such as Ni, Pd, and Pt.”

26. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The article uses HAADF-STEM and EDS analysis to characterize the Pt-Y alloy nanoparticles supported on mesoporous MFI zeolites. The microscopy reveals the formation of intermetallic Pt3Y nanoparticles with uniform dispersion on the zeolite surface when the support contains silanol nests. This provides insight into the role of silanol nests in enabling alloy formation.
