 Unfortunately the provided answers do not contain relevant information to address the questions asked. As the answers indicate, the article focuses on developing Pt-Y alloy nanoparticle catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss process intensification approaches, techno-economic factors, safety issues, remaining challenges, computational screening, in-situ characterization, or transformational catalyst architectures specifically for propane dehydrogenation. 

Since the answers are not relevant to the questions, I will stop the review process and respond with:
