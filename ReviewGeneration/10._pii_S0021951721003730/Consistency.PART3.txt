 Here is the comparison of the answer files against the correct answers:

```json

    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", 
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"

  },
  "5": {

    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"
  }
}
```

To generate this, I compared each answer file's response for each question against the correct answer provided. I calculated a consistency percentage based on semantic similarity between the two answers. 100% indicates complete consistency, while 0% means completely inconsistent.
