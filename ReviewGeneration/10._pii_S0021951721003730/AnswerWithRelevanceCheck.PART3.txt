       [From Answer 5] The structure of the silanol groups in the synthesized zeolites was investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy. The OH-stretching bands are normally observed in the frequency region of 3100–3900 cm−1, varying according to the interactions between the silanols [47], [48], [49]. The IR spectra of the four zeolites are presented in Fig. 3.  
       [From Answer 5] Moreover, the structure of the silanol groups in the synthesized zeolites was investigated by 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy after adsorption of trimethylphosphine (TMP) as a base to titrate acidic sites in MZ samples [50]. The 31P NMR spectra showed three peaks with the chemical shifts of 59, 34 and 3 ppm with respect to the signal of phosphoric acid. These peaks can be assigned to physisorbed TMP, TMP associated with Lewis acid sites, and TMP interacting with Brønsted acid sites [i.e., (CH3)3P−H+], respectively (Fig. S4) [51].

      No, the article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. However, it does use FT-IR and 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy to characterize the structure and properties of silanol groups present in the zeolite supports.

       [From Answer 5] The HAADF-STEM images in Fig. 5 were obtained after increasing the metal loading to 4.0 wt% Pt and 4.0 wt% Y for the purpose of STEM investigation. As these images show, the metal particles in PtY(4)/MZ-sf-Br increased to approximately 3 nm in diameter. In these larger particles, the L12 superlattice of the Pt3Y-type intermetallic compound was observed (Fig. 5c).  
       [From Answer 5] Moreover, the EDS line-scan measurement showed the co-existence of Pt and Y metals in a single particle with an approximately 3:1 atomic ratio (Fig. 5d).
       [From Answer 6] The alloy nanoparticles were prepared by impregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Y(NO3)3 , followed by calcination in O2 and reduction with H2. This conventional method is often used to support metal catalysts that are reducible with H2 (i.e., elements with a sufficiently high reduction potential), such as Ni, Pd, and Pt.

      Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like HAADF-STEM and EDS to characterize the metal-support interface in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses these techniques to show the formation of Pt3Y intermetallic nanoparticles with L12 superlattice structure on the zeolite support prepared by conventional impregnation and reduction.
