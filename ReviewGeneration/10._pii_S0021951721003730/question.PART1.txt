Abstract
Mesoporous zeolite-supported Pt3Y catalyst deactivates slowly in propane dehydrogenation, maintaining high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, but the formation of the intermetallic compound requires atomistic migration of yttrium through silanol nests on the zeolite. Compared to the cumbersome generation of silanols via framework demetallation, we report a direct synthesis of mesoporous MFI zeolite possessing silanol nests. The synthesis procedure employed a diammonium-type bromide surfactant [C18H37N(CH3)2C6H12N(CH3)2C4H9Br2] and a sodium-free silica source. The basicity of the synthesis mixture was adjusted by the addition of readily available N(CH3)4OH, instead of converting the surfactant to hydroxyl form. The presence of silanol nests in the resultant zeolite was confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies. When the zeolite was supported with 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y using nitrate precursors, a remarkably long catalytic lifetime of 20 days was obtained with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity under the reaction condition using neat propane gas at 853 K.

1. Introduction
Until recent years, the industrial demand for ethylene and propylene was satisfied with a balance by large-scale production from naphtha crackers [1]. However, a new and less expensive source of ethylene recently became available in increasing amounts from ethane cracking in natural gas and shale gas [2]. This broke the previous ethylene-propylene production balance [3], causing a need to find proper on-purpose methods for propylene production, such as catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH), olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-olefin processes [4]. Among the emerging methods, the PDH process has garnered interest as the most efficient process that can meet the large demand for propylene [5], [6]. A major problem of the PDH process, however, is that the reaction requires high-temperature operations, at 773 K or higher, to increase the thermodynamic equilibrium limit [5]. Typically, the PDH process employs a Pt-Sn bimetallic catalyst supported on porous alumina (PtSn/Al2O3) or chromium oxide-supported alumina (CrOx/Al2O3), but both suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition [5]. Of the two typical catalysts, CrOx/Al2O3 has disadvantages of chromium toxicity and rapid deactivation (approximately in 15 min), which can be overcome by catalyst regeneration by a simple air-burning process [7]. On the other hand, the employed PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst requires frequent regeneration (typically, every 5 d) [8], [9], [10], [11], but the regeneration involves a high-temperature treatment with a toxic and corrosive gas mixture containing O2 and HCl [12]. To resolve the deactivation problem due to coke deposition [13], [14], other metals (e.g., Cu, Zn, Ga, and In) have also been investigated as substitutes for Sn in recent years [15], [16], [17], [18]. These investigations suggested that the use of new alloy nanoparticles with an intermetallic compound-type structure might be a suitable strategy to resolve the rapid deactivation problem [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30].
Among the intermetallic compound PDH catalysts, we focus on a recent work by Ryoo et al. on Pt3Y and Pt3La nanoparticles supported on a surfactant-templated mesoporous MFI zeolite [28]. The mesoporous zeolite-supported Pt3Y and Pt3La catalysts exhibited very slow deactivation in the PDH reaction and high propylene selectivity. The alloy nanoparticles were prepared by impregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Y(NO3)3 or La(NO3)3, followed by calcination in O2 and reduction with H2. This conventional method is often used to support metal catalysts that are reducible with H2 (i.e., elements with a sufficiently high reduction potential), such as Ni, Pd, and Pt [31]. To form an alloy with Pt, the rare earth element (REE) oxides should be fully reduced to the metallic zero-oxidation state. However, such a transition to the fully reduced metallic state is generally difficult to achieve by H2 in the case of the Y and La elements [32], since the reduction of REEs requires an exceedingly high chemical potential energy. For this reason, the preparation of the Pt-REE alloy nanoparticles has seldom been reported in the literature [33], except for electrochemical reduction on porous carbon supports [32], [34]. Instead, the supported REEs are rather known for causing strong metal-support interactions in a non-metallic oxide state [35].
Ryoo et al. circumvented the reduction-potential problem by atomically dispersing the REEs on silanol nests in a surfactant-templated mesoporous zeolite [28]. The silanol nest refers to a cluster of neighboring -SiOH groups that are associated with hydrogen bonding [36], [37]. Upon O2 calcination, the silanol nest was able to disperse the REE into a single atomic species by coordination bonding. The single atomically dispersed REE species could readily be converted to the metallic state by H2. This phenomenon was interpreted as a result of increased chemical potential due to the single atomic dispersion, compared with that of bulk REE oxides and nanoparticles [38]. Herein, an important question was how to effectively generate the silanol nests in a sufficient concentration, whereas ordinary zeolites possess only a small number of silanol nests in the framework [39]. In the work of Ryoo et al., the silanol nests were generated through a tedious procedure involving the synthesis of a mesoporous zeolite in a gallosilicate form, and subsequent degallation with nitric acid. Moreover, although the zeolite was refluxed in hot conc. HNO3 three times, Ga species were not completely removed from the zeolite, making it difficult to clarify whether the long catalytic lifetime was entirely due to the formation of the Pt-REE alloys or to some degree by the effect of remaining Ga in the support [19], [40].
The aim of the present work was to clarify the effect of the Pt3Y alloy formation for PDH catalytic performance, using a purely siliceous zeolite possessing silanol nests. After various attempts, we found that a mesoporous MFI zeolite possessing silanol nests can be directly synthesized in a silica form under an alkali-free condition using a diammonium hydroxide surfactant, which has a structural formula of [C18H37N+(CH3)2C6H12N+(CH3)2C4H9](OH)2 [abbreviated as C1864(OH)2]. Further, we simplified the synthesis procedure to the use of a bromide surfactant, C1864Br2, and N(CH3)4OH. The synthesis results and the PDH application results are reported in this paper.
2. Experimental
2.1. Mesoporous zeolite support
Four samples of siliceous MFI zeolite with a mesopore/micropore hierarchy were prepared according to modified synthesis procedures [28], using a C1864 surfactant-type structure-directing agent [41]. The first zeolite sample was prepared by post-synthetic degallation from a gallosilicate form of mesoporous zeolite (Si/Ga = 50). The degallated zeolite is denoted as MZ-dg, which means mesoporous zeolite by degallation. The inductively coupled plasmaatomic emission spectroscopic analysis of the MZ-dg sample indicated that a small amount of gallium remained in this zeolite (0.3 wt% Ga, amounting to Si/Ga  400). The other three zeolite samples were directly synthesized in a pure-silica form. One of the siliceous zeolites was synthesized by using a sodium silicate solution as the silica source and C1864Br2 as a mesopore-micropore dual structure-directing agent (SDA). Note that the zeolite synthesis was performed under a Na+-containing condition. This zeolite was designated by MZ-sc, where sc denotes the sodium-containing synthesis condition. In contrast, the two remaining siliceous zeolites were synthesized under completely sodium-free conditions (Na content < 1 ppm). The silica source was tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, > 97%, TCI) in both cases. The SDA surfactant was C1864(OH)2 in one case while C1864Br2 was used in the other case. The difference between the two SDAs was the type of anion, which was either OH or Br-. These zeolites are designated by MZ-sf-OH and MZ-sf-Br, where sf denotes the sodium-free synthesis condition, and OH and Br indicate the anions in the surfactant. In the case of MZ-sf-Br, the initial pH of the synthesis mixture was adjusted by adding TMAOH. Each zeolite synthesis procedure is described in detail in the following subsections.
2.1.1. Synthesis of MZ-sc under Na-containing condition
A siliceous mesoporous MFI zeolite was synthesized using C1864Br2, according to a procedure reported in the literature [28]. A sodium silicate solution (Shinheung Silicate, 29 wt% SiO2, Na/Si = 0.57) was used as the silica source. The molar composition of the synthesis mixture was 100 SiO2/30 Na2O/7.5 C1864Br2/18 H2SO4/6000 H2O. The synthesis mixture was heated at 423 K for 3.5 d in a Teflon-lined autoclave under tumbling. After cooling to ambient temperature, the zeolite product was filtered, washed with water, and dried at 373 K overnight. The dried zeolite was then calcined by heating at 853 K for 4 h in air flow (heating rate = 2.4 K min1).
2.1.2. Synthesis of MZ-dg via degallation
A mesoporous MFI zeolite was synthesized in a gallosilicate composition (Si/Ga = 50) [28]. Gallium nitrate hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the Ga source. The molar composition of the synthesis gel mixture was 100 SiO2/30 Na2O/0.5 Ga2O3/7.5 C1864Br2/18 H2SO4/6000 H2O. The remainder of the synthesis procedure was the same as described for the pure-silica zeolite synthesis presented in Section 2.1.1. Subsequently, Ga species were removed from the calcined zeolite framework by three iterations of refluxing in conc. nitric acid, following a procedure described elsewhere [28].
2.1.3. Synthesis of MZ-sf-OH using C1864(OH)2
TEOS was used as the silica source. The laboratory-synthesized C1864Br2 surfactant was converted to C1864(OH)2 using an anion exchange resin [42]. The molar composition of the starting gel mixture was 100 TEOS/7.5 C1864(OH)2/6000 H2O. The remainder of the synthesis procedure was the same as described in Section 2.1.1.
2.1.4. Synthesis of MZ-sf-Br using C1864Br2 + N(CH3)4OH
Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH, 25 wt% aqueous) was purchased from TCI. This solution was diluted to 16.6 wt% for easier handling. Into 90.2 g of this TMAOH solution, 5.49 g of C1864Br2 was dissolved. The solution was combined with 17.1 g of TEOS at once. Immediately after the addition, the mixture was shaken and stirred vigorously for homogenization. The molar composition of the resultant gel mixture was 100 TEOS/7.5 C1864Br2/20 TMAOH/6000 H2O. The synthesis mixture was stirred for 6 h at 333 K in a convection oven for aging. The remainder of the synthesis procedure was the same as described in Section 2.1.1.
2.2. Pt and Y loading
Proper amounts of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 [SigmaAldrich, Pt > 50 wt%] and Y(NO3)3·5H2O (SigmaAldrich, 99.9%) to give desired metal loadings on the zeolite were dissolved in a volume of distilled water amounting to the zeolite pore volume. For example, to prepare 1.0 g of zeolite supported with 0.50% Pt and 0.50% Y (metal content in nominal loading hereafter), a solution containing 10 mg of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2, 21 mg of Y(NO3)3·5H2O, and 0.60 mL of distilled water was prepared. The solution was impregnated in the zeolite by drop-by-drop incipient wetness with immediate zeolite mixing, before the solution became turbid due to precipitation of the metal compounds. The impregnated zeolite was dried in a convection oven at 333 K overnight. After the zeolite was put into a lab-made quartz reactor, the reactor was heated to 623 K (heating rate of 0.5 K min1 to 623 K, and 2 h maintained at 623 K) under an O2 (99.999%, Joongang gas) flow of 200 cm3 min1 for calcination. After cooling to room temperature, the reactor was heated again to 973 K (heating rate of 5 K min1 to 973 K, and 1 h maintained at 973 K) under an H2 (99.999%, Joongang gas) flow of 200 cm3 min1.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
Catalyst characterization was performed with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Rigaku SmartLab), volumetric nitrogen adsorption at 77 K (Micromeritics TriStar II), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Verios 460L), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Titan ETEM G2) operated at 300 kV, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, JASCO FT/IR-6100), solid-state magicangle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS NMR, Bruker AVANCE III HD 400WB), double CS-corrected STEM (FEI Titan cubed G2 60300) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Super-X) at KAIST Analysis Center for Research Advancement, volumetric hydrogen chemisorption at 298 K with a laboratory-built apparatus, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, TA Instrument TGA Q50) in an air flow [28], [43].
Prior to N2 adsorption, FT-IR and NMR measurements, zeolite samples were dehydrated at 623 K for 3 h under vacuum conditions. Especially for FT-IR measurement, 12 mg of pelletized zeolite without binder was used to obtain IR spectra with the same acquisition numbers. Titration of nested-silanol acidic sites was carried out by the adsorption of trimethylphosphine (TMP). Typically, 15 mg of TMP (Sigma-Aldrich) was mixed with 0.2 g of a degassed zeolite sample in a glove box, and subsequently, the zeolite was outgassed at room temperature for 1 h under a vacuum, as described elsewhere [43]. Quantitative information about adsorbed TMP on acidic sites with different strength was obtained from 31P MAS NMR chemical shifts and signal intensity of the adsorbed TMP. The NMR signals were collected with the same sample quantities and the same number of data acquisitions. The spectral data were plotted with absolute intensities.
2.4. Catalytic PDH measurement
PDH reaction measurement was performed in a quartz tubular fixed-bed reactor (i.d. = 10 mm), following the same protocol described elsewhere [28]. Typically, 100 mg of the O2-calcined PtY/zeolite (containing 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y) was loaded in the reactor in the form of 50100 mesh granules. The O2-calcined PtY/zeolite was heated in an H2 flow (20 cm3 min1) at 973 K for reduction of the metals. After the reactor temperature was changed to 853 K, the reactor was fully vented with N2 (99.999%, 20 cm3 min1) for 30 min. The PDH reaction was then started by flowing a high-purity propane gas (99.99%, Rigas) alone at 853 K. At this metal loading, the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was 5.5 h1, based on the total weight of the catalyst). The PDH reaction products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC, YL Instrument 6500GC) with a flame ionization detector and a GC column (Agilent GS-Gaspro, l = 30 m, i.d. = 0.32 mm). The conversion of propane and the selectivity for propylene were determined on a carbon basis.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural properties of mesoporous MFI zeolites
Four different mesoporous MFI zeolite samples were obtained according to the synthesis methods described in Section 2.1. The MZ-sf-Br sample is the main sample of interest in the present work as a support material for the PtY PDH catalyst. The three other samples were prepared for the purpose of comparison. The synthesis gel compositions and the representative porous textural properties of the zeolites (i.e., Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, micropore volume, and mesoporous volume) are summarized in Table 1.

The MZ-sf-Br, MZ-sf-OH, MZ-sc, and MZ-dg samples in Table 1 were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption, SEM, and TEM. Fig. 1 shows the XRD and N2 adsorption results. All four zeolites exhibited similar Bragg reflections in the wide-angle region (i.e., 2θ > 5) of the XRD patterns (Fig. 1a, left). These reflections were characteristic of a crystalline MFI zeolite, except that the reflections corresponding to the crystallographic b-axis direction were missing or were very low in intensity. This is due to the formation of extremely thin zeolite frameworks along the b-axis [44]. In addition, the XRD patterns in the small-angle region (Fig. 1a, left) exhibited a shoulder peak at around 2θ = 1.5 (d = 5.9 nm). This shoulder peak is interpreted to originate from the spacing between the two neighboring pore walls in the mesoporous zeolite. There were no broad background XRD peaks in the region of 2θ = 15-30 corresponding to an amorphous silica phase in the synthesized zeolites.

Fig. 1. Structural information of mesoporous MFI zeolite samples: (a) XRD patterns, (b) N2 adsorption isotherms, and (c) the corresponding pore size distributions. The pore-size distributions were obtained with the adsorption branch of the isotherms by the BJH method.
The N2 adsorption isotherms of the four mesoporous zeolites in Fig. 1b were all of Type IV according to the IUPAC classification [45]. These isotherms commonly exhibited a steep increase in the amount of N2 adsorption as the pressure increased to P/P0 = 0.05. This jump in the low-pressure region was assignable to the micropore filling in the MFI zeolite by N2. There was another jump in the adsorption amount in the range of P/P0 = 0.450.7. This was due to the capillary condensation in the slit-shape mesopores that are formed between the neighboring zeolite nanosheets. The Brunauer-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution (Fig. 1c) showed that the mesopores in the zeolite samples have a narrow distribution of pore diameter centered at around 33.5 nm, except in the case of MZ-dg, which exhibited a broader distribution with the center shifted to 4 nm. The broad distribution in MZ-dg appears to be the result of structural damage caused by the harsh degallation treatment using HNO3. Consistent with the results in Fig. 1, the SEM and TEM images of MZ samples in Fig. 2 also show a crystalline zeolite framework structure with irregular nanosponge-like morphologies. No amorphous phases were detected (see Figs. S1 and S2 for low-magnification SEM and TEM images, and Fig. S3 for 29Si MAS NMR spectra). From these results, we have confirmed that MZ-sf-Br, MZ-sf-OH, MZ-sc, and MZ-dg are all very similar to the MFI zeolite nanosponge reported earlier, in respect to the mesoporous structure built with an ultrathin nanosheet framework [46].

Moreover, the structure of the silanol groups in the synthesized zeolites was investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy. The OH-stretching bands are normally observed in the frequency region of 31003900 cm1, varying according to the interactions between the silanols [47], [48], [49]. The IR spectra of the four zeolites are presented in Fig. 3. The four samples commonly exhibited an intense absorption peak at 3,740 cm1. This peak corresponds to the isolated silanol groups, which are not associated with hydrogen (H) bonding [36]. It should be noted that there was also a broad IR band over 3,2303,700 cm1, which indicates the presence of silanol groups associated by H-bonding, i.e., silanol nests [36]. In the case of the MZ-sc zeolite, the isolated silanol was found to be the main form of the zeolite silanols, and the presence of the silanol nest was almost negligible. In contrast, the MZ-dg, MZ-sf-Br, and MZ-sf-OH zeolites indicated the presence of the silanol nest in a significantly high concentration. Based on the IR investigation, the zeolite samples could be classified into two groups, represented as a group of zeolites with silanol nest defects (i.e., MZ-dg, MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH) and a defect-free zeolite (i.e., MZ-sc).

For further characterization of the zeolite silanol groups, we obtained 31 P MAS NMR spectra after adsorption of TMP as a base to titrate acidic sites in MZ samples [50]. The 31P NMR spectra showed three peaks with the chemical shifts of 59, 34 and 3 ppm with respect to the signal of phosphoric acid. These peaks can be assigned to physisorbed TMP, TMP associated with Lewis acid sites, and TMP interacting with Brnsted acid sites [i.e., (CH3)3P-H+], respectively (Fig. S4) [51]. In the case of MZ-dg, MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH, all the spectra showed the Brnsted acid (i.e., silanol nests) signal with moderately high intensity. In MZ-sc, however, this signal was not detected.
In this regard, we suggest that the sodium-free synthesis results in the spontaneous generation of silanol nest defects, as in the case of post-synthetic degallation. The generation of the silanol nests is believed to be affected by the absence of Na+ ions. They are known to promote the dissolutionrecrystallization process during the zeolite crystallization [52], [53], which in turn can heal the temporarily created defect sites and remove the silanol nests. The effect of the Na+ ions was evaluated by intentionally adding NaCl in the synthesis gel composition for MZ-sf-Br (that is, changing it to 100 TEOS/1 NaCl/7.5 C1864Br2/20 TMAOH/6000 H2O). In the IR spectrum of the resultant sample (named MZ-sf-Br-NaCl), we confirmed that the silanol nest disappeared (Fig. S5).
3.2. Formation of Pt-Y alloy nanoparticles probed by H chemisorption
The MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH zeolites synthesized under sodium-free conditions were assessed as catalyst supports for PtY alloy nanoparticles. The alloy structure of the PtY nanoparticles in these zeolites was investigated to check whether the silanol nests generated by direct synthesis could effectively promote the intermetallic compound formation. Into the MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH zeolites, 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y were co-impregnated by a simple incipient-wetness method, followed by O2 calcination and H2 reduction (see Section 2.2). For the purpose of comparison, the same metal loading procedure was performed on the MZ-dg and MZ-sc samples. For brevity, the Pt and Y-supported zeolite samples are denoted by PtY(w)/MZ, where w stands for wt% of the metal which was always identical for Pt and Y.
Fig. 4 shows high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-STEM images of the 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y supported on the MZ-sf-Br, MZ-sf-OH, MZ-dg, and MZ-sc supports. The HAADF-STEM images show that the metal nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed throughout the support material in all cases. The size of the metal particles was approximately 2 nm for all four samples (Fig. S6). The formation of tiny metal nanoparticles can be attributed to the confinement effect provided by the mesopores in MZ [54]. The EDS analysis results confirmed that these metal nanoparticles contained both Pt and Y in the same particle (Fig. S7). Moreover, the average atomic ratio of Pt to Y was determined to be approximately 3 for both PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br samples, which agrees well with the Pt/Y ratio of Pt3Y intermetallic alloys supported on MZ-dg in a previous study [28]. The detailed atomic structure of the alloy nanoparticles was investigated by atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM analysis. However, due to the exceedingly small size of the alloy nanoparticles, compared to the previous study, it was difficult to obtain structural information of the alloy for the 0.50 wt% samples.

The HAADF-STEM images in Fig. 5 were obtained after increasing the metal loading to 4.0 wt% Pt and 4.0 wt% Y for the purpose of STEM investigation. As these images show, the metal particles in PtY(4)/MZ-sf-Br increased to approximately 3 nm in diameter. In these larger particles, the L12 superlattice of the Pt3Y-type intermetallic compound was observed (Fig. 5c). Moreover, the EDS line-scan measurement showed the co-existence of Pt and Y metals in a single particle with an approximately 3:1 atomic ratio (Fig. 5d). The measured spacing value of 0.403 nm corresponding to the Pt3Y L12 superlattice closely matched the known value of the Pt3Y bulk structure (i.e., 0.400 nm taken from PDF 00017-0058) [55]. This result is notable in that the formation of Pt3Y nanoparticles can simply be achieved without post-synthetic degallation of a gallosilicate zeolite. By contrast, in the case of the PtY(4)/MZ-sc sample, we could not observe such intermetallic compound-type nanoparticles. The PtY(4)/MZ-sc sample rather exhibited yttrium oxide nanoparticles separated from Pt (Fig. S8).

In addition to the STEM analysis, a hydrogen chemisorption analysis was performed to probe the changes in the electronic state due to alloy formation. It was reported that when Pt3Y nanoalloys were formed, the hydrogen chemisorption behavior became markedly different in comparison to that of monometallic Pt [28]. The Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles exhibited fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, whereas the monometallic Pt nanoparticles showed only partially reversible chemisorption (4050% reversibility) due to the formation of a strong Pt-H bond [56]. It appears that there is a significant modification of the electronic state of Pt upon intermetallic compound formation, which resulted in a distinct change in the hydrogen adsorption properties on the metal surface. In this regard, hydrogen chemisorption properties of PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br were examined to indirectly assess the degree of intermetallic alloy formation assisted by silanol nests generated by direct synthesis. The hydrogen chemisorption provides the total number of chemisorbed H atoms per total number of Pt atoms (H/Pt). In this study, the molar H/Pt values upon initial chemisorption (denoted as H/Pttotal) and second chemisorption after evacuation under vacuum for 1 h at room temperature (denoted as H/Ptrev) were determined and used to calculate the reversibility of chemisorption.
Table 2 shows the chemisorption results of the four PtY(0.5)/MZ samples. In the case of PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg, the H/Pttotal was 0.59 while H/Ptrev was 0.53, indicating chemisorption was 90% reversible at room temperature. This was in good agreement with the previous result reported for Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles supported on MZ-dg [28]. Similar chemisorption behavior was observed for PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br, which were prepared using silanol nest-containing zeolites as catalyst supports. The H/Pttotal for PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH was 0.55 while H/Ptrev was 0.53. Similarly, in the case of hydrogen chemisorption for PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br, H/Pttotal was 0.59 and H/Ptrev was 0.56. These two samples exhibited highly reversible chemisorption behavior (94% for PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH and 96% for PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br), similar to the case of PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg. On the other hand, MZ-sc, the support without silanol nests, gave a reversible portion of only 39%, which was close to the value for Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc (i.e., 50%). These results suggest that the silanol nests generated by the direct synthesis in MZ-sf-OH and MZ-sf-Br have a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles that exhibit reversible chemisorption behavior upon changes in the electronic state of Pt.

3.3. Effect of silanol nests on PDH catalysis of PtY/zeolite
The PDH catalytic performance of the four PtY(0.5)/MZ samples was measured at 853 K using a fixed bed reactor with a propane flow at WHSV = 5.5 h1. Neat propane gas was used without the addition of diluent gas (N2 or H2) [18], [57], to accelerate the catalytic deactivation process within a short period. In Fig. 6, the PDH results were presented in comparison to those of Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc, the mesoporous zeolite supported with 0.50 wt% Pt alone. As the results show, the Pt-alone catalyst exhibited an initial propane conversion of 28%, but the conversion dropped very rapidly to 8% in 10 h. The catalytic behavior of the monometallic Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc catalyst was similar to that of PtY(0.5)/MZ-sc, wherein Pt and Y were simultaneously supported. The addition of Y did not improve the rapidly deactivating catalytic property in PtY(0.5)/MZ-sc (i.e., supported on silanol nest-less zeolite). However, unlike the defect-less zeolite supported catalyst, all of the PtY(0.5) catalysts supported on the group of defect-containing zeolites [i.e., PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br, PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH, and PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg] exhibited a dramatic improvement in the catalytic lifetime due to the Y addition (i.e., the effect of Pt-Y alloy formation).

(b) Propylene selectivity vs. time. The reaction conditions were as follows: 100 mg catalyst, WHSV = 5.5 h1 with pure propane gas flow, temp = 853 K.
The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts were even superior to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg in terms of catalytic durability. Since the two catalysts did not contain any Ga, the increased catalytic lifetime is not attributable to the Ga effect [58], [59], [60], but rather to the Pt-Y alloying effect promoted by silanol nests as proposed in our earlier work. Furthermore, to confirm the effect of silanol nests, the PDH reaction was measured with PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl, where the zeolite support was synthesized by simply adding a small amount of NaCl into the synthesis gel composition for MZ-sf-Br. Despite the minor change of NaCl addition, there was a large difference in the PDH conversion between PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibited slow deactivation over 20 d as mentioned above, but PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl was deactivated within 1 d, similar to that of Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc (Fig. S9).
The conversion-vs-time plot in Fig. 6a shows that the three PtY(0.5) catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period (12 h) to reach the full conversion. Such activation is often observed in PDH conversion over supported Pt-alloy catalysts, which may be attributed to rearrangement of the metal surface structure under the reaction conditions [61], [62]. Another notable feature is that the propane conversion was somewhat higher than the equilibrium value (42% at 853 K) during the early reaction period (e.g., < 7 d in PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br) [63], [64]. This over-conversion behavior might be due to side reactions, such as propylene polymerization and hydrocarbon cracking [65], taking place in the zeolite phase [66]. This phenomenon gradually disappeared with the reaction time-on-stream, as indicated by the increasing propylene selectivity in Fig. 6b.
Furthermore, we performed coke analysis with the PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst sample recovered after measurement for 21 d. The TGA profile for the spent PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst showed that 37 wt% of coke species were deposited on the catalyst sample (Fig. S10). This corresponds to an average coke formation rate of 0.001 gcoke gcat-1h1, which was even slower than that of the state-of-the-art intermetallic PtZn nanoparticles supported on MZ-sc (i.e., 0.006 gcoke gcat-1h1) [67].
The influence of the metal loading on PDH performance was examined by varying the Pt and Y loadings as 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 wt%. The PDH results of the PtY/MZ-sf-Br catalysts with different metal loadings are presented in Fig. 7. For a fair comparison, the propane flow was increased accordingly with the increase in metal loading to maintain the same WHSV values based on the weight of Pt. The results show that there is an inverse relationship between the propane conversion and the metal loading amount when the catalysts were fully activated. The conversion-vs-loading relationship appears to originate from increasing metal dispersion (or decreasing particle size) at low loadings (Fig. S11), as reported elsewhere [68], [69], [70]. A more intriguing question was that the zeolite-supported PtY catalysts exhibited maximum durability at each metal loading of 1.0 wt% (see inset in Fig. 7a). According to the results shown in Fig. 7, PtY(1)/MZ-sf-Br exhibited the best PDH performance with only a 16% decrease in propane conversion even after 30 d of reaction time. When the metal loading was increased from 1.0 to 2.0 and 4.0 wt%, the catalyst durability decreased progressively against the metal loading. On the contrary, when the metal loading was decreased to 0.50 and 0.25 wt%, the catalyst durability rather decreased. This effect with high loading may be explained by the increase in metal facet areas, which favor coke generation [71], [72]. However, the opposite effect with low loading is difficult to explain with the change in the metal surface alone, since the metal particle sizes do not decrease as conspicuously as the metal loading decreased from 1.0 to 0.50 and 0.25 wt%. In this respect, we speculate that the zeolite phase with abundant defects and impurities may cause the side reactions to produce high molecular weight hydrocarbon species that result in coke deposits on the supported metal surfaces. Thus, the relatively low durability at low catalyst loading appears to be due to the increased fraction of the zeolite support in the catalyst.

4. Conclusions
Silanol nests in zeolites have, to date, typically been obtained by the generation of point defects through demetallation. We showed in the present work that silanol nests could be generated spontaneously in a mesoporous MFI zeolite during hydrothermal synthesis under sodium-free conditions. Due to the single atomic dispersion of yttrium, the yttrium formed intermetallic Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles when supported with Pt on the zeolite possessing silanol nests. The Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles exhibited high catalytic durability with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity in the propane dehydrogenation. The promotional effect of silanol nests on intermetallic alloy formation is an intriguing phenomenon, and is expected to trigger investigations of other metal alloy catalysts. In particular, the zeolite-supported alloy catalysts may provide simplification of the PDH process based on a fixed-bed system in the future. Furthermore, it would be interesting to study other alloy nanoparticle catalysts for other industrially implemented reactions, such as acetylene semi-hydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation. We believe that the proposed sodium-free synthesis strategy can also be extended to other zeolite products including bulk MFI zeolite, in place of cumbersome post-synthetic demetallation treatment.
