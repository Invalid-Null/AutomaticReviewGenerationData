         [1] "The alloy nanoparticles were prepared by impregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Y(NO3)3 , followed by calcination in O2 and reduction with H2. This conventional method is often used to support metal catalysts that are reducible with H2 (i.e., elements with a sufficiently high reduction potential), such as Ni, Pd, and Pt."
         [2] "As these images show, the metal particles in PtY(4)/MZ-sf-Br increased to approximately 3 nm in diameter. In these larger particles, the L12 superlattice of the Pt3Y-type intermetallic compound was observed (Fig. 5c)."

         Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It discusses preparing Pt-Y alloy nanoparticles supported on mesoporous MFI zeolites and shows they exhibit high catalytic durability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. Relevant data includes Figure 6 showing conversion over time for Pt-Y alloys, demonstrating increased lifetime compared to Pt alone. The Pt3Y intermetallic nanoparticles are enabled by silanol nests in the zeolite providing isolated sites.

         是的,文章评估了在分子筛载体中进行金属封装以提高丙烷脱氢催化剂的稳定性。文中讨论了在介孔MFI分子筛上制备Pt-Y合金纳米粒子,并表明与单金属Pt催化剂相比它们展现出更高的催化稳定性。相关数据包括图6,显示了Pt-Y合金的转化率随时间的变化,证明其相比仅Pt催化剂有更长的使用寿命。Pt3Y金属间化合物纳米粒子的形成受益于分子筛中的硅醇巢提供的隔离位点。

         Yes, the article employs HAADF-STEM imaging to characterize the metal-support interface in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses this technique to show the formation of Pt3Y intermetallic nanoparticles with L12 superlattice structure dispersed on the zeolite support when silanol nests are present.
