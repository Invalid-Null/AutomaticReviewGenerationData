         [1] The HAADF-STEM images in Fig. 5 were obtained after increasing the metal loading to 4.0 wt% Pt and 4.0 wt% Y for the purpose of STEM investigation. 

         [2] As these images show, the metal particles in PtY(4)/MZ-sf-Br increased to approximately 3 nm in diameter. In these larger particles, the L12 superlattice of the Pt3Y-type intermetallic compound was observed (Fig. 5c).

         [3] Moreover, the EDS line-scan measurement showed the co-existence of Pt and Y metals in a single particle with an approximately 3:1 atomic ratio (Fig. 5d).

         Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It discusses preparing Pt-Y alloy nanoparticles in mesoporous MFI zeolites and shows they exhibit high catalytic durability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. Relevant data includes HAADF-STEM imaging showing the formation of intermetallic Pt3Y nanoparticles enabled by the zeolite support.
