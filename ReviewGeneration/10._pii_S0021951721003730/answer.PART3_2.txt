[1] The structure of the silanol groups in the synthesized zeolites was investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy. The OH-stretching bands are normally observed in the frequency region of 3100–3900 cm−1, varying according to the interactions between the silanols [47], [48], [49]. The IR spectra of the four zeolites are presented in Fig. 3. 

[2] Moreover, the structure of the silanol groups in the synthesized zeolites was investigated by 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy after adsorption of trimethylphosphine (TMP) as a base to titrate acidic sites in MZ samples [50]. The 31P NMR spectra showed three peaks with the chemical shifts of 59, 34 and 3 ppm with respect to the signal of phosphoric acid. These peaks can be assigned to physisorbed TMP, TMP associated with Lewis acid sites, and TMP interacting with Brønsted acid sites [i.e., (CH3)3P−H+], respectively (Fig. S4) [51].

[3] The HAADF-STEM images in Fig. 5 were obtained after increasing the metal loading to 4.0 wt% Pt and 4.0 wt% Y for the purpose of STEM investigation. As these images show, the metal particles in PtY(4)/MZ-sf-Br increased to approximately 3 nm in diameter. In these larger particles, the L12 superlattice of the Pt3Y-type intermetallic compound was observed (Fig. 5c). 

[4] The alloy nanoparticles exhibited fully reversible hydrogen chemisorption behavior at room temperature, whereas the monometallic Pt nanoparticles showed only partially reversible chemisorption (40–50% reversibility) due to the formation of a strong Pt-H bond [56]. It appears that there is a significant modification of the electronic state of Pt upon intermetallic compound formation, which resulted in a distinct change in the hydrogen adsorption properties on the metal surface.

5. Yes, the article employs FT-IR spectroscopy, 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy, HAADF-STEM, and hydrogen chemisorption to characterize the structure of silanol groups, metal-support interface, and electronic state changes in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. For example, FT-IR and NMR were used to confirm the presence of silanol nests. HAADF-STEM imaged the Pt3Y alloy structure. Hydrogen chemisorption probed the modification of Pt's electronic state upon alloying.
