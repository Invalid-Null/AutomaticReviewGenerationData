[1] The interaction of DMZ with HZSM-5(20) and its decomposition under the reductive conditions was further investigated by MAS NMR spectroscopy. 
[2] The nature of the catalytically active Zn sites in Zn/ZSM-5 is still a matter of dispute. It has been demonstrated that the catalytic reactivity and adsorption properties of both impregnated and ion-exchanged zeolites with relatively low Zn/Al ratios are similar to those of the catalysts prepared by a high-temperature reaction with zinc vapor.

<English version answer>
6. Yes, the article uses X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) at the Zn K-edge to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis over different Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst preparation methods. It shows that Zn is present as Zn2+ independent of preparation method, but that the coordination environment and dispersion varies between isolated Zn2+ ions versus larger ZnO aggregates depending on the technique used.
