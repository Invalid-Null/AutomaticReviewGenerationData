Based on my review, the answers provided do not contain information relevant to the set of questions asked about propane dehydrogenation and propylene production. Across all the answer sections, it is clearly stated that the article does not provide details related to:

1) Importance of propylene production via propane dehydrogenation
2) Catalyst mechanisms for propane dehydrogenation 
3) Major catalyst classes explored for this reaction
4) Thermodynamic or kinetic factors involved
5) Use of DFT calculations to study this reaction
6) Microkinetic modeling efforts  
7) Structure-activity relationships 

Since none of the questions are addressed, I have stopped my review process and responded with the standard sentence indicating the answers are not relevant. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.
