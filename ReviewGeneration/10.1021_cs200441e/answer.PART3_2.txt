[1] "The methyl ligands of the [ZnCH3]+ ions can be removed by reduction in hydrogen, resulting in isolated Zn2+ stabilized at cation-exchange sites." 

[2] "The progress of the interaction of the zeolitic Brnsted acid sites with DMZ upon the CVD modification was monitored by use of in situ FTIR spectroscopy."

[3] "By changing the conditions of high-temperature decomposition of this precursor, the properties of the catalytically active zinc complexes in the thus prepared Zn/ZSM-5 materials can be varied. For example, while reduction leads to the predominant formation of isolated Zn2+ ions, high-temperature oxidation treatment results in oxygenated cationic Zn complexes."

3. Yes, the article does investigate methods aimed at optimizing active zinc phase dispersion in the zeolite. The key techniques discussed are organometallic grafting of DMZ followed by tailored thermal treatments. Monitoring with in-situ FTIR allows control over speciation of isolated vs clustered zinc complexes.

[1] "XAS at the Zn K-edge was used to investigate the influence of the preparation method on the nature and coordination properties of Zn species in Zn/ZSM-5."

[2] "The position of the absorption edge in the XANES spectra depends on the oxidation state of Zn. For example, oxidation of Zn0 to Zn2+ results in a substantial shift of the adsorption edge in XAS spectrum to higher energies." 

[3] "The XAS spectra for the catalysts prepared by CVD methods are quite different. In the case of the Zn/ZSM-5(20)-CVD(m), a distinct shoulder at lower energies in the XANES spectrum (Figure 4A(f)) suggests the presence of a considerable amount of metallic zinc in the sample that disappears upon the high-temperature treatment."

6. Yes, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Zn K-edge is used to probe changes in zinc oxidation state and speciation during different preparation methods and activation treatments. For the CVD-prepared catalysts, changes in absorption edge energies and shapes reveal presence of Zn0 vs Zn2+ ions.
