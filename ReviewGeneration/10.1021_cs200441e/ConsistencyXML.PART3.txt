To generate the XML, I compared each answer file's response for a given question to the correct answer provided. I calculated a consistency percentage based on how relevant and accurate each response was compared to the correct answer. Files that provided fully consistent responses were given 100%, partially consistent 50%, and completely inconsistent 0%. This generates a quantitative assessment of the consistency across different answer files for each question.
