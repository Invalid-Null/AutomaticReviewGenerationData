[1] "Ammonium forms of two ZSM-5 zeolites with Si/Al ratios of 20 and 40 (kindly provided by Albemarle Catalysts) were calcined in a mixture of 20 vol % oxygen in nitrogen at a flow rate of 100 N mL/min while heating to 550 C at a heating rate of 2/min followed by an isothermal period of 6 h to obtain the hydrogen forms of the zeolites."

[2] "Zn/ZSM-5(20)-CVD(DMZ) was prepared by CVD of Zn(CH3)2 (dimethylzinc, DMZ, ABCR Chemicals, 95%) on dehydrated HZSM-5(20). All manipulations were performed in a nitrogen-flushed glovebox."  

[3] "The methyl ligands of the [ZnCH3]+ ions can be removed by reduction in hydrogen, resulting in isolated Zn2+ stabilized at cation-exchange sites."

[4] "By changing the conditions of high-temperature decomposition of this precursor, the properties of the catalytically active zinc complexes in the thus prepared Zn/ZSM-5 materials can be varied. For example, while reduction leads to the predominant formation of isolated Zn2+ ions, high-temperature oxidation treatment results in oxygenated cationic Zn complexes."

22. Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single metal sites in zeolitic supports. Specifically, it uses a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method with dimethylzinc (DMZ) precursor to introduce isolated Zn-methyl species into the zeolite framework. These can then be converted to isolated Zn2+ sites by high temperature reduction.  

23. No, the article does not evaluate metal encapsulation methods.

24. Yes, the article investigates various catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion, including impregnation, ion exchange, CVD of metallic Zn, and CVD of DMZ precursor.  

25. Yes, the article utilizes temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and in-situ FTIR to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts and gain insights into the nature of active sites.

26. No, the article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques.  

27. Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to probe changes in zinc oxidation state during catalytic testing.  

28. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types.
