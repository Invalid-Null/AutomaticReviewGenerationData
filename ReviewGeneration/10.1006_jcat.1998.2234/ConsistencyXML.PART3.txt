I manually reviewed each answer file and compared to the correct answers to determine consistency percentages. All answers were fully consistent except for question 7 in answer.PART3_1.txt, which had 80% consistency with the correct answer about evaluation of different reactor types. The other files had 100% consistency for that question.
