Abstract
The selective dehydrogenation of isobutane into isobutene was studied on silica-supported bimetallic Pt-Sn. Several bimetallic catalysts were carefully prepared by selective hydrogenolysis of Sn(n-C4H9)4on Pt. Previous EXAFS studies have shown that this hydrogenolysis is a stepwise transformation of a Pt-Sn(n-C4H9)3fragment into a surface alloy. It was shown that after hydrogen treatment at 550C, tin and platinum are in reduced form (zero-valent oxidation state) and that the tin atoms are located on the surfrace of the metallic particles. The presence of tin on platinum caused a decrease in hydrogen or carbon monoxide chemisorption, but an increase of the oxygen consumption. The decrease of H2and CO chemisorption is explained by the decrease of the number of accessible platinum atoms due to the increased number of surface tin atoms. The increase in the O2chemisorption was explained by the following reaction which represents a phase segregation: PtsSnx/SiO2+1/2(y+xy)O2(PtOy)s(SnOy)x/SiO2. The values of y and y was about 1 and 2 at respectively 25C and 300C. Thermodesorption of adsorbed CO on several reduced PtSn catalysts showed no shift of the ν (CO) frequency, suggesting negligible electronic effect of tin atoms on the platinum atoms when both are reduced. At 550C under atmospheric pressure of hydrogen and isobutane, the presence of tin increases drastically, both the selectivity and the activity of the isobutane conversion into isobutene (for Sn/Pts=0.85, the selectivity is higher than 99% and the TOF, based on total platinum atoms, is greater than 6 s1). The increase in selectivity could be explained by the site isolation effect and the increase in activity could be due to the inhibition of the coke formation (which poisons the active surface). A mechanism of dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of isobutane based on elementary steps of organometallic chemistry has been proposed which accounts both for the high selectivity and activity of the bimetallic catalysts as compared to pure Pt/SiO2.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
