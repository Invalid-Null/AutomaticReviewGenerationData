[1] "Two neighboring Zrcus (cus = coordinatively unsaturated) sites were concluded to be mainly responsible for propane dehydrogenation to propene."

[2] "Our DFT calculations further support the positive effect of chromium promoter on reducibility of ZrO2. As proven by our EPR measurements, reduced CrZrOx/support catalysts contain highly dispersed Cr3+ species (Figure 2). As a result, it was assumed that CrZrOx is a solid solution of Cr3+ in ZrO2."

[3] "The model with two anion vacancies (2Ov-CrZrOx(101); for model details, see the Supporting Information) predicts such an effect. Thus, our further discussion is based on this model." 

[4] "Two kinds of active sites were considered: (i) two Zrcus cations ([Zr6cI, Zr6cII]-Ov) or one Zrcus and one Cr4c ([Zr6cI, Cr4c]-Ov) located at an anion vacancy and (ii) three Zrcus around another Ov not located at chromium (Figure S6e)."

3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the studied CrZrOx catalysts. According to the quotes, it concludes that two neighboring Zrcus sites are mainly responsible for propane dehydrogenation to propene. DFT calculations suggest that the model with two anion vacancies containing two Zrcus or one Zrcus and one Cr4c sites predicts the enhancing effect of Cr promoter on activity. The proposed active sites are two Zrcus or one Zrcus and one Cr4c located at an anion vacancy.

3. 是的,文章为所研究的CrZrOx催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢的机理方案。根据引文,文中总结出两个相邻的Zrcus位点主要负责将丙烷脱氢为丙烯。DFT计算表明,含有两个Zrcus位点或者一个Zrcus位点和一个Cr4c位点的双空位模型可以预测Cr助剂对活性的增强效应。提出的活性位点为位于阴离子空位上的两个Zrcus位点或一个Zrcus位点和一个Cr4c位点。

[1] "The presented work provides fundamentals for controlling activity of catalysts with supported mixed CrZrOx species in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Owing to the different abilities of CrOx and ZrO2 to interact with the support and with each other, a synergy effect between these two types of catalytically active species can be achieved in terms of the propene formation rate especially when the interaction with the support is weak as in the case of silica."

[2] "On the basis of DFT calculations, this effect was explained by a positive influence of the Cr3+ promoter in the lattice of ZrO2 on the intrinsic activity of two Zrcus sites, which form the active site for propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "The strength of this effect depends, however, on the kind of support. The highest amount of H2 was consumed by Cr10Zr90/12SiTiO2, while Cr10Zr90/Silicagel released the lowest amount of lattice oxygen."

[4] "The support effect on the strength of the synergy effect between CrOx and Zrcus sites might be due to the different strengths of interaction between different supports and CrOx and/or ZrO2."

4. Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in the CrZrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. According to the quotes, it reveals that the synergy between CrOx and ZrO2 for propene formation rate depends on the interaction with the support, with weak interaction in the case of silica being preferable. DFT calculations suggest this effect is due to the positive influence of Cr3+ promoter on the intrinsic activity of Zrcus sites. The strength of the effect also depends on the support, with CrZrOx/12SiTiO2 showing the highest reducibility. The article proposes that different strengths of interaction between supports and CrOx/ZrO2 affect the synergy effect.

4. 是的,文章探究了CrZrOx催化剂中金属与载体界面的效应对丙烷脱氢的影响。根据引文,文章揭示CrOx和ZrO2之间对丙烯生成速率的协同作用取决于与载体的相互作用,其中与二氧化硅的弱相互作用更佳。DFT计算表明,这种效应归因于Cr3+助剂对Zrcus位点固有活性的正向影响。这种效应的强度还取决于载体,CrZrOx/12SiTiO2表现出最高的可还原性。文章认为不同载体与CrOx/ZrO2的不同相互作用强度影响了协同效应。
