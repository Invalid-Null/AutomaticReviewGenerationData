[1] Catalysts can promote propane dehydrogenation by lowering the energy required for CH bond cleavage via adsorption of propane and stabilization of transition states and intermediates.

[2] CH bond cleavage is the rate limiting step in propane dehydrogenation over most catalysts.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the activation energy barriers, specifically for the rate limiting CH bond cleavage step. Catalysts achieve this by adsorbing propane and stabilizing transition states and intermediates along the reaction pathway.

[1] Molecular-level insights into the kind of active sites and individual pathways in the course of the PDH reaction were derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

[2] To verify the statement on the kind of active sites, we have performed DFT calculations. 

[3] DFT calculations predict that two Zrcus form the active site on the surface of Cr-containing and Cr-free ZrO2. In Cr presence, the kinds of rate-limiting step and energies of individual pathways, however, change in such a way that the PDH reaction becomes more energetically favorable.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article describes how DFT calculations have provided insights into propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways. Specifically, DFT identified two Zrcus sites as the active sites on Cr-Zr oxide surfaces, and showed how the presence of Cr affects the energetics and kinetics of the different reaction steps.
