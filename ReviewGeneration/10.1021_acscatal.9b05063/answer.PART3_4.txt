<quotes>
[1] "Deposition of CrZrOx on supports was carried out according to the following protocol. Required amounts of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O were dissolved in ethanol to achieve 0.5 M of Cr3+ and ZrO2+ in total. Then, support (2 g) was added to a certain amount of such solution to achieve 30 wt % loading of CrZrOx."

[2] "The obtained H2-TPR profiles are shown in Figure 3a. The reduction occurs in a broad temperature range. Depending on the catalyst, there are one or several maxima (Tmax) of H2 consumption. The Tmax values are given in Table 1. These values for the catalysts possessing either CrOx or ZrO2 are 464 or 609 °C (Figure 3b)."

[3] "There is no doubt that CrOx releases its lattice oxygen easier than ZrO2. Importantly, when CrOx and ZrO2 were present in the form of CrZrOx on the surface of SiO2, the amount of H2 consumed was higher than the sum of the corresponding values determined for ZrO2/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2, i.e., 366.2 vs 229.4 μmol H2 g−1."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes deposition of CrZrOx on different supports to achieve high dispersion, as seen in quote 1. H2-TPR data in quotes 2-3 also show that CrOx and ZrO2 interaction is tuned to enhance reducibility and oxygen removal when deposited as CrZrOx mixed oxides versus alone.

答:是的,这篇文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它描述了在不同的支持体上沉积CrZrOx以实现高度分散,正如引用1所示。引用2-3中的H2-TPR数据也表明,与单独沉积相比,沉积为CrZrOx混合氧化物时,调谐了CrOx和ZrO2的相互作用以增强可还原性和氧去除。

[1] "Ex situ EPR spectra were recorded at 20 °C on a Bruker cw ELEXSYS 500-10/12 spectrometer (X-band, ν = 9.7 GHz) with a microwave power of 6.3 mW, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, and a modulation amplitude of 5 G." 

[2] "In situ EPR experiments were performed with 50 mg (particles of 250–350 μm size) of Cr3Zr97/SiO2 in an in-house-developed fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor connected to a gas-dosing system with mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Omnistar, Pfeiffer Vacuum GmbH) for online product analysis."

[3] "IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded in the transmission mode on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer equipped with an in-house-developed reactor cell with CaF2 windows. The cell is connected to a gas-dosing and evacuation system."

[4] "Operando UVvis tests were carried out in an in-house-developed setup using an Avantes spectrometer equipped with a temperature-resistant UVvis probe, a deuterium-halogen light source, and a CCD array detector."

<English version answer> 
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses ex situ and in situ EPR spectroscopy as seen in quotes 1-2 to analyze paramagnetic species under reaction conditions. IR spectroscopy of probe molecules is used in quote 3 to characterize Lewis acid sites. Quote 4 describes operando UV-vis spectroscopy to monitor coke formation during catalysis.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,这篇文章利用了原位表征技术来研究工作中的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它使用了离位和原位EPR光谱技术,如引用1-2所示,来分析反应条件下的顺磁性物种。引用3中使用的探针分子的IR光谱用于表征Lewis酸位点。引用4描述了操作中UV-vis光谱技术来监测催化过程中的焦炭形成。
