<quotes>
[1] "Two neighboring Zrcus (cus = coordinatively unsaturated) sites were concluded to be mainly responsible for propane dehydrogenation to propene."

[2] "They are formed upon reductive catalyst treatment, and their concentration depends on the strength of interaction among CrOx, ZrO2, and support and on the size of ZrO2 crystallites in CrZrOx."

[3] "The lower-temperature consumption increases with chromium content, it should be related to the reduction of CrOx." 

[4] "The higher-temperature H2 consumption in the H2-TPR profiles in Figure 3b can be attributed to hydrogen reaction with surface lattice oxygen of ZrO2."

[5] "On a molecular level, methylene CH bond activation on 2Ov-CrZrOx(101) requires higher (0.99 vs 0.61 eV) energy than on 1Ov-t-ZrO2(101), while the activation of the methyl CH bond in Zr6cI-iso-C3H7 occurs easier (0.86 vs 0.92 eV) on 2Ov-CrZrOx(101)."

3. The article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the studied CrZrOx metal oxide catalysts. It suggests that two neighboring coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus) sites are mainly responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. These Zrcus sites are formed upon reductive treatment of the catalyst, and their concentration depends on factors like the CrOx-ZrO2 interaction strength and ZrO2 crystallite size. DFT calculations reveal that the presence of Cr helps reduce the energy barrier for breaking the methyl C-H bond in an adsorbed iso-C3H7 intermediate compared to bare ZrO2, making propene formation easier.

3. 该文献提出了研究的CrZrOx金属氧化物催化剂催化丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的机理方案。它认为两个相邻的无配位饱和锆位点(Zrcus)主要负责催化丙烷向丙烯的脱氢反应。这些Zrcus位点是在催化剂还原处理过程中形成的,其浓度取决于诸如CrOx-ZrO2相互作用强度和ZrO2晶粒尺寸等因素。DFT计算揭示,与裸ZrO2相比,Cr的存在有助于降低吸附的异丙基中间体上甲基C-H键断裂的能垒,使丙烯的生成更容易。
