 Here is the comparative analysis of the answer files:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I carefully compared the quotes and answers from each file to the correct answers provided. I calculated the consistency percentage based on how closely the quotes and content matched the correct answers. All the answer files are fully consistent for questions 1 and 3-7, as they state the article does not evaluate other catalysts or propose mechanisms. For question 2, only answer.PART1_1.txt is inconsistent as it incorrectly states the article investigates tuning metal oxide properties. The other files are consistent for question 2 as they state this is not investigated.
