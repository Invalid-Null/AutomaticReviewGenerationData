<quotes>
[1] "Owing to the different abilities of CrOx and ZrO2 to interact with the support and with each other, a synergy effect between these two types of catalytically active species can be achieved in terms of the propene formation rate especially when the interaction with the support is weak as in the case of silica."

[2] "The strength of this effect depends on the kind of support. The highest amount of H2 was consumed by Cr10Zr90/12SiTiO2, while Cr10Zr90/Silicagel released the lowest amount of lattice oxygen." 

[3] "Our DFT calculations further support the positive effect of chromium promoter on reducibility of ZrO2."

[4] "Thus, we can safely conclude that incorporating Cr3+ into the lattice of ZrO2 can facilitate oxygen vacancy formation."

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that the synergy effect between CrOx and ZrO2 for propene formation rate depends on the interaction strength with the support, with weaker interaction leading to higher synergy. It also shows that Cr3+ promoter improves the reducibility and oxygen vacancy formation in ZrO2, facilitating propane dehydrogenation.

[1] "Two neighboring Zrcus (cus = coordinatively unsaturated) sites were concluded to be mainly responsible for propane dehydrogenation to propene."

[2] "Our DFT calculations predict that two Zrcus form the active site on the surface of Cr-containing and Cr-free ZrO2." 

[3] "In Cr presence, the kinds of rate-limiting step and energies of individual pathways, however, change in such a way that the PDH reaction becomes more energetically favorable."

[4] "Thus, our further discussion is based on this model."

3. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. It describes that two neighboring Zrcus sites are responsible for breaking the C-H bond in propane. DFT calculations also predict two Zrcus as the active site on Cr-ZrOx and bare ZrO2 surfaces. The presence of Cr3+ changes the energetics of the reaction steps, making propane dehydrogenation more favorable.

3. 是的,这篇文章提出了在所研究的金属氧化物催化剂上的丙烷脱氢反应的机理方案。它描述了两个相邻的Zrcus位点负责断裂丙烷中的C-H键。DFT计算也预测Zrcus��位点是Cr-ZrOx和裸ZrO2表面的活性位点。Cr3+的存在改变了反应步骤的能量,使丙烷脱氢反应更有利。

[1] "The support effect on the strength of the synergy effect between CrOx and Zrcus sites might be due to the different strengths of interaction between different supports and CrOx and/or ZrO2." 

[2] "The positive effect of crystallite size could lead to an increase in catalyst reducibility (Table 1 and Figure S3). The catalysts with smaller crystallites were reduced deeper in H2 flow."

<English version answer>
4. Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows the synergy effect strength depends on the interaction strength between the support and CrOx/ZrO2. It also reveals smaller ZrO2 crystallite size increases reducibility, which enhances activity.
