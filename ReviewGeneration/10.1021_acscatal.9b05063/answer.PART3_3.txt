[1] Deposition of CrZrOx on supports was carried out according to the following protocol. Required amounts of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O were dissolved in ethanol to achieve 0.5 M of Cr3+ and ZrO2+ in total. Then, support (2 g) was added to a certain amount of such solution to achieve 30 wt % loading of CrZrOx. The resulting mixture was heated to 65 C, stirred until it became a slurry, dried at room temperature overnight, and finally calcined at 550 C (heating rate was 3 K min1) for 4 h.

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it describes depositing CrZrOx on various supports by dissolving Cr(NO3)3 and ZrO(NO3)2 precursors in ethanol, adding the support, heating and stirring to form a slurry, drying, and calcining. This aims to achieve high CrZrOx dispersion on the supports.

[1] Operando UVvis tests were carried out in an in-house-developed setup using an Avantes spectrometer equipped with a temperature-resistant UVvis probe, a deuterium-halogen light source, and a CCD array detector.

[2] In situ EPR experiments were performed with 50 mg (particles of 250350 μm size) of Cr3Zr97/SiO2 in an in-house-developed fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor connected to a gas-dosing system with mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Omnistar, Pfeiffer Vacuum GmbH) for online product analysis. The catalyst was first pretreated at 300 C in a flow (30 mL min1) of 5 vol % O2 in He for 1 h, flushed with Ar flow (30 mL min1) for 30 min, and then exposed to a flow (30 mL min1) of 5 vol % CO in He for 45 min. The spectra were recorded with time under different gas atmospheres.

[3] IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded in the transmission mode on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer equipped with an in-house-developed reactor cell with CaF2 windows. The cell is connected to a gas-dosing and evacuation system. ZrO2/SiO2, Cr3Zr97/SiO2, Cr7Zr93/SiO2, and Cr30Zr70/SiO2 were used for such tests. 

[4] Transient tests were performed in the temporal analysis of product (TAP-2) reactor, a time-resolved technique with a resolution of approximately 100 μs. The TAP reactor system has been described in detail elsewhere. The catalyst Cr20Zr80/SiO2 (35 mg; sieve fraction of 315710 μm) was packed between two layers of quartz of the same particle size 250355 μm within the isothermal zone of a quartz-tube microreactor.
