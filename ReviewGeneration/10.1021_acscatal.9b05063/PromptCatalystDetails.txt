Unraveling the Origins of the Synergy Effect between ZrO2 and CrOx in Supported CrZrOx for Propene Formation in Nonoxidative Propane Dehydrogenation

Abstract
In this work, steady-state tests of propane dehydrogenation, density functional theory calculations, operando UV–vis spectroscopy, ex situ and in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed techniques were combined to provide fundamentals for tuning activity and onstream stability of low-loaded catalysts with supported CrZrOx species. Two neighboring Zrcus (cus = coordinatively unsaturated) sites were concluded to be mainly responsible for propane dehydrogenation to propene. They are formed upon reductive catalyst treatment, and their concentration depends on the strength of interaction among CrOx, ZrO2, and support and on the size of ZrO2 crystallites in CrZrOx. SiO2 weakly interacting with CrOx was found to be a more preferable support than Al2O3- or TiO2-based supports. CrOx species promotes formation of Zrcus sites and improves their intrinsic activity for the desired reaction. CrOx also contributes to coke formation as concluded from operando UV–vis analysis. Cr20Zr80/SiO2 possessing about 3.9 or 2.5 times lower amounts of chromium or zirconium in comparison with an analogue of industrial K-CrOx/Al2O3 or state-of-the-art Ru/LaZrOx revealed about 2 times higher space-time yield of propene at 30% propane conversion at 550 °C. Moreover, this catalyst was durable over 50 dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles lasting 150 h.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propene is one of the most important building blocks in the chemical industry because of its usage for the production of various important products such as polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs. (1,2) Nowadays, oil-based technologies, i.e., steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, provide a major part of this olefin. In view of limitations of these processes to improve the desired selectivity, they cannot fulfill the global propene demand. (3) To close the gap between the demand and supply of propene, nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene (PDH) has been developed for an on-purpose propene production over Pt- or CrOx-based catalysts. (4,5)
In recent years, various kinds of supported catalysts on the basis of oxides of gallium, vanadium, zinc, or tin have been studied in both academia and industry with the purpose to develop low-cost alternatives in comparison with commercially applied Pt-based catalysts. (6−15) Isolated metal cations such as Zn(II), Co(II), Ga(III), Ni(II), and Fe(II) supported on SiO2 are also reported to be active in PDH. (16−21) In addition to supported catalysts, bulk ZrO2-based catalysts were recently demonstrated to be active, selective, and durable under industrially relevant conditions. (22) Two neighboring coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) were suggested to be the active sites for breaking the C–H bond in propane. (23) Such defects can be created through doping of ZrO2 with oxides of metals with oxidation state lower than 4 (e.g., La2O3, Y2O3) or upon reductive catalyst treatment. (22,24−26)
Owing to the high activity and low price of CrOx-based catalysts, there is still a lot of research work aimed at improving catalyst performance. (27−31) The kind of support has a significant influence on the distribution of CrOx species and on catalyst activity accordingly. (32−34) Additionally, the distribution of CrOx species can also be tuned through adding promoters such as ZrO2 and NiO. (28,29) Recently, bulk binary Cr–Zr mixed oxides with Cr2O3 content of about 6 wt % demonstrated extremely high activity exceeding that of an analogue of commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3. (35) Nevertheless, despite the good catalyst performance, the usage of bulk ZrO2-based catalysts for large-scale applications is quite expensive. Moreover, no mechanistic analysis was performed to identify the kind of active sites and factors affecting their formation as required for tailored catalyst design.
On the basis of the above background, this study aims at developing supported catalysts with binary CrZrOx species and understanding fundamentals regulating their activity. Specific scientific purposes were (i) to elucidate the kind of catalytically active sites for both propene and coke formation and (ii) to provide basics for controlling their concentration. In particular, we focused on the role of CrOx distribution, the strength of interaction of ZrO2 and CrOx with each other and with support, and ZrO2 crystallinity. To this end, we followed a complementary approach including the precise synthesis of supported materials, their detailed characterization by nitrogen adsorption and desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD), temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and operando UV–vis methods, as well as sophisticated mechanistic and kinetic tests under industrially relevant conditions. UV–vis spectroscopy was instrumental for monitoring coke formation. Molecular-level insights into the kind of active sites and individual pathways in the course of the PDH reaction were derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Catalyst Preparation
Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), and ethanol (absolute, Merck) were used for synthesis of supported Cr–Zr mixed oxides (CrZrOx). Commercial SiO2 (Davisil Grade 643, Sigma-Aldrich, 302 m2 g–1), AlSiOx (75 wt % SiO2, Saint-Gobain NorPro, 404 m2 g–1), Silicagel (BASF, 542 m2 g–1), Al2O3 (ChemPur, 151 m2 g–1), 7.7SiTiO2 (7.7 wt % SiO2, Sachtleben Chemie GmbH, 128 m2 g–1), and 12SiTiO2 (12 wt % SiO2, Sachtleben Pigment GmbH, 123 m2 g–1) were chosen as support materials. Two kinds of hexagonal mesoporous silica such as HMS (678 m2 g–1) and MCM-41 (769 m2 g–1) were synthesized according to the methods described by Locus et al. (36) and Tanev et al., (37) respectively. Deposition of CrZrOx on supports was carried out according to the following protocol. Required amounts of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O were dissolved in ethanol to achieve 0.5 M of Cr3+ and ZrO2+ in total. Then, support (2 g) was added to a certain amount of such solution to achieve 30 wt % loading of CrZrOx. The resulting mixture was heated to 65 °C, stirred until it became a slurry, dried at room temperature overnight, and finally calcined at 550 °C (heating rate was 3 K min–1) for 4 h. The samples were denoted Cr10Zr90/SiO2, Cr10Zr90/HMS, Cr10Zr90/MCM-41, Cr10Zr90/Silicagel, Cr10Zr90/AlSiOx, Cr10Zr90/Al2O3, Cr10Zr90/7.7SiTiO2, Cr10Zr90/12SiTiO2, Cr3Zr97/SiO2, Cr5Zr95/SiO2, Cr7Zr93/SiO2, Cr20Zr80/SiO2, and Cr30Zr70/SiO2 with the numbers standing for the molar fraction of Zr and Cr in CrZrOx.
The above preparation method was also applied to synthesize supported catalysts containing either ZrO2 or CrOx species. The catalysts were denoted CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/AlSiOx, CrOx/Al2O3, CrOx/7.7SiTiO2, ZrO2/SiO2, ZrO2/AlSiOx, ZrO2/Al2O3, and ZrO2/7.7SiTiO2. The contents of ZrO2 and CrOx in these samples were set to 30 and 2 wt %, respectively.
Characterization
The specific surface area was determined by nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms using the Belsorp mini II setup (Bel Japan) at 77 K.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on a Theta/Theta diffractometer X’Pert Pro (Panalytical) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and an X’Celerator RTMS detector. The crystal phase and crystallite size were determined according to PDF2004 and Scherrer equations, respectively.
The reducibility of the samples was analyzed by temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR) in an in-house-developed setup containing eight individually heated continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactors. Fresh samples (200 mg for each sample) were pretreated in an airflow at 550 °C for 1 h and then cooled down to 50 °C in the same flow. Hereafter the catalysts were purged by Ar for 15 min and heated in a flow (10 mL min–1) of 5 vol % H2 in Ar to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 K min–1. The signals at atomic mass units (AMUs) of 2 and 40 related to H2 and Ar, respectively, were recorded by an online mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320).
Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was carried out in the same setup used for H2-TPR. Fresh samples (50 mg for each sample) were pretreated in an airflow at 550 °C for 1 h and then reduced in a flow of 50 vol % H2 in Ar. Then, the catalysts were cooled down in Ar to 120 °C. Hereafter, a flow (10 mL min–1) of 1 vol % NH3 in Ar was fed into the reactors for 1 h. After the adsorption of ammonia was completed, the samples were cooled down to 80 °C in a flow of Ar and kept at this temperature for 2 h to remove physically adsorbed NH3. Then, the catalysts were heated in a flow of Ar to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 K min–1. Argon and desorbed NH3 were detected at AMUs of 40 and 15, respectively, using an online mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320).
Ex situ EPR spectra were recorded at 20 °C on a Bruker cw ELEXSYS 500-10/12 spectrometer (X-band, ν ≈ 9.7 GHz) with a microwave power of 6.3 mW, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, and a modulation amplitude of 5 G. EPR tubes were filled with about 30 mg of selected catalysts. The catalysts were initially reduced in H2 (50 vol % H2 in N2) at 550 °C for 1 h.
In situ EPR experiments were performed with 50 mg (particles of 250–350 μm size) of Cr3Zr97/SiO2 in an in-house-developed fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor connected to a gas-dosing system with mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Omnistar, Pfeiffer Vacuum GmbH) for online product analysis. The catalyst was first pretreated at 300 °C in a flow (30 mL min–1) of 5 vol % O2 in He for 1 h, flushed with Ar flow (30 mL min–1) for 30 min, and then exposed to a flow (30 mL min–1) of 5 vol % CO in He for 45 min. The spectra were recorded with time under different gas atmospheres.
IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded in the transmission mode on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer equipped with an in-house-developed reactor cell with CaF2 windows. The cell is connected to a gas-dosing and evacuation system. ZrO2/SiO2, Cr3Zr97/SiO2, Cr7Zr93/SiO2, and Cr30Zr70/SiO2 were used for such tests. Each catalyst was pressed into a self-supporting wafer with a diameter of 20 mm and a weight of 50 mg. Before pyridine adsorption, the catalysts were either oxidized in air at 450 °C for 1 h or reduced in a mixture consisting of 5 vol % CO in He at 450 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature in the corresponding atmospheres, the cell was evacuated followed by pyridine adsorption until saturation. Then, the cell was again evacuated for removing physisorbed pyridine. The spectra were collected at 200 °C. We report spectra obtained after subtraction of the spectrum measured after each pretreatment, i.e., before pyridine adsorption, from the respective pyridine adsorbate spectrum.
Operando UV–vis tests were carried out in an in-house-developed setup using an Avantes spectrometer equipped with a temperature-resistant UV–vis probe, a deuterium-halogen light source, and a CCD array detector. (38) BaSO4 was used as the white reference. The catalysts were heated to 550 °C in nitrogen flow followed by feeding air for 1 h. Afterward, the catalysts were reduced in a H2-containing flow (H2/N2 = 1 mixture) and then applied for propane dehydrogenation using a feed consisting of 40 vol % C3H8 in N2. The catalyst amount and total gas flow were 40–105 mg and 20 mL min–1, respectively, to reach a similar initial conversion of C3H8 at around 10%. The Kubelka–Munk function F(R) was calculated from reflectance (R) according to eq 1. For the coke analysis, relative reflectance (Rrel) was defined as the ratio of the reflectance of catalysts with reaction-induced carbon deposits (RDH) to that of reduced ones (RH2) according to eq 2. This relative reflectance was used for calculating the relative Kubelka–Munk function according to eq 3.

Ex situ UV–vis spectra of as-prepared catalysts on the basis of SiO2, Al2O3, AlSiOx, or 7.7TiSiO2 with supported CrOx or Cr10Zr90 were recorded at room temperature and presented according to eq 1.
Catalytic Test
All catalytic tests were carried out at ambient pressure in an in-house-developed setup with 15 continuous-flow tubular (di = 4 mm) fixed-bed quartz reactors. According to the Mears and Weisz–Prater criteria, any influence of heat or mass transport limitations on PDH reaction can be excluded (see the Supporting Information). The propene formation rate (r(C3H6)) calculated by eq 4 was determined after 420 s on stream at 550 °C and propane conversion below 10%. Cr- or Zrcus-related turnover frequency (TOF) values were calculated according to eqs 5 or 6. The catalysts (50 mg for each sample, particle size of 315–710 μm) were loaded into reactors, heated to 550 °C in N2, activated in air for 1 h, purged with N2, and reduced with a flow of 50 vol % H2 in N2. Then, they were flushed with N2 for 15 min and thereafter exposed to a feed of 40 vol % C3H8 in N2 at a weight (with respect to propane) hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 34.5 h–1.

where ṅC3H6, mcat, nCr, and nZrcus stand for molar flow of C3H6 (mmol min–1), catalyst amount (g), amount of reduced CrOx (mmol g–1), and Zrcus (mmol g–1) calculated from H2-TPR tests, respectively.
To determine the dependence of product selectivity on the degree of propane conversion, catalytic tests were performed at 550 °C and different feed flows (10, 20, 30, 40 mL min–1) using prereduced (50 vol % H2 in N2 at 550 °C for 1 h) catalysts. The conversion and selectivity data are reported after 420 s on stream.
Long-term stability of the catalysts was demonstrated in a series of 50 PDH/regeneration cycles at 550, 600, and 625 °C with WHSV of 4.32, 11.52, and 14.40 h–1 for Cr10Zr90/SiO2 and 5.18, 13.82, and 17.27 h–1 for Cr20Zr80/SiO2 and 5.44, 14.52, and 18.14 h−1 for Cr30Zr70/SiO2 using a feed consisting of 40 vol % C3H8 in N2. The catalyst amounts were 150 mg for Cr10Zr90/SiO2 and 125 mg for Cr20Zr80/SiO2 and 120 mg for Cr30Zr70/SiO2. The PDH and regeneration steps lasted for about 47.5 and 15 min, respectively, and were always separated by a purge with N2 for 15 min. The conversion of propane (X(C3H8)) and the selectivity to gas-phase products (S(i)) and coke (S(coke)) were calculated according to eqs 7–9, respectively. Equation 10 was used for calculating space-time yield (STY, kgC3H6 h–1 kgcat–1).

where ṅ with superscripts “in” or “out” are the molar flow of gas-phase components at the reactor inlet and outlet (mmol min–1), respectively, and βC3H8 and βi represent the number of carbon atoms in C3H8 and the product i, respectively. MC3H6 is the molecular weight of propene (42 g mol–1).
The feed components and the gas-phase reaction products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890) equipped with flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors.
Transient Tests
Transient tests were performed in the temporal analysis of product (TAP-2) reactor, a time-resolved technique with a resolution of approximately 100 μs. The TAP reactor system has been described in detail elsewhere. (39,40) The catalyst Cr20Zr80/SiO2 (35 mg; sieve fraction of 315–710 μm) was packed between two layers of quartz of the same particle size 250–355 μm within the isothermal zone of a quartz-tube microreactor. Before transient experiments were started, the catalyst was treated in a flow of H2 for 30 min at 550 °C. Hereafter, the reactor was evacuated to 10–5 Pa.
Propane interactions with the catalyst were studied upon pulsing of C3H8:Ar = 1:1 or C3D8:Ar = 1:1 mixtures at 550 or 600 °C. An overall pulse size was about 5 × 1015 molecules. The reaction mixtures were prepared using C3H8 (Linde, 3.5), C3D8 (ISOTEC INC, 99 atom % D), and Ar (Air Liquide, 5.0) without additional purification. A quadrupole mass spectrometer (HAL RC 301 Hiden Analytical) was applied for quantitative analysis of feed components and reaction products. The following AMUs were used for mass-spectrometric identification of different compounds: 52 (C3D8), 48 (C3D8, C3D6), 46 (C3D8, C3D6), 44 (C3H8, CO2), 42 (C3H8, C3H6), 41 (C3H8, C3H6), 34 (C3D8), 29 (C3H8), 28 (C3H8, CO, CO2,), 18 (H2O), 15 (CH4), 4 (D2), 2 (H2, C3H8), and 40 (Ar). Pulses were repeated 10 times for each AMU and averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
DFT Calculations
The Vienna ab initio simulation package was applied for spin-polarized and periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. (41,42) Exchange and correlation were treated within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation. (43) A cutoff energy of 400 eV was used for obtaining energies with errors of less than 1 meV per atom. Geometry optimization was converged with forces acting on atoms lower than 0.02 eV Å–1, whereas the energy threshold defining self-consistency of electron density was set to 10–4 eV. The climbing image nudged elastic band method with eight images was applied for finding transition states and minimum energy paths of all reactions with a force tolerance of 0.05 eV Å–1. (44) The final transition-state structures were refined according to the quasi-Newton algorithm with the Hellman–Feynman forces on each ion lower than 0.02 eV Å–1. For validating the optimized transition states, the normal mode frequency analysis was performed. Each authentic transition state has only one imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinate. The zero-point vibrational energies from the frequency analysis are included in our energetic data for discussion. The slab with nine layers was fixed and the surface-adsorbed molecules (partial Hessian) or intermediates are relaxed in frequency analysis.
Since XRD analysis (Figure S1) proved that the CrZrOx/support catalysts mainly contain the tetragonal ZrO2 (t-ZrO2) phase, we constructed our models on the basis of this phase. In our previous work, (45) the most stable surface ZrO2(101) termination with O–Zr–O was modeled by a p(2 × 3) nine-atomic-layer supercell with the bottom three layers fixed and the top six layers relaxed. (46−48) The lateral supercell containing a vacuum space of 15 Å between the slab and its periodic images was used. The Brillouin zone was sampled by a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack mesh. The adsorption energy is defined as Eads = E(X + slab) – E(X) – E(free slab), where E(X + slab) represents the total energy of the slab with adsorbate X in its equilibrium geometry, E(free slab) is the total energy of the optimized slab, and E(X) is the total energy of free adsorbate X in the gas phase. Therefore, the more negative the adsorption energy is, the stronger the adsorption of adsorbate X is. The activation barrier (Ea) and the reaction energy (ΔEr) are calculated according to Ea = ETS – EIS and ΔEr = EFS – EIS, where EIS, EFS, and ETS are the energies of the initial state (IS), the final state (FS), and the transition state (TS), respectively. The energy (Ef(Ov)) of oxygen vacancy (Ov) formation was calculated according to the equation Ef(Ov) = Ed + 1/2EO2 – ES, where ES is the energy of t-ZrO2(101) (or Cr-doped ZrO2(101)), Ed is the energy of surface with Ov, while EO2 is the energy of a gas-phase O2 molecule. Ef(Ov) is a measure of the reducibility of the oxide. The higher (the more positive) the Ef(Ov) value, the lower the reducibility is. The formation energy of the second Ov was calculated using the model for Cr-doped ZrO2(101) possessing one oxygen vacancy.

Morphology, Phase Composition, and Chromium Distribution
BET surface area (SBET) of the catalysts is given in Table 1. The SBET values of bare supports after calcination at 550 °C for 4 h are reported in the section “Catalyst Preparation”. Obviously, the specific surface area of each catalyst is determined by the area of the support and slightly decreased after deposition of CrZrOx. In general, the catalysts on the basis of SiO2 possess higher SBET than those on the basis of Al2O3, AlSiOx, and SiTiO2. The SBET values of CrxZry/SiO2 with different Cr/(Cr + Zr) molar ratios are close to each other.

aCrystallite size of tetragonal ZrO2 in CrZrOx was calculated according to the Scherrer equation.
According to XRD data (Figure S1), tetragonal ZrO2 was identified in all supported catalysts with the exception of Cr10Zr90/12SiTiO2 and Cr30Zr70/SiO2, where ZrO2 was X-ray amorphous. The presence of the tetragonal crystalline ZrO2 phase is in good agreement with a well-known fact that ZrO2 can be stabilized in this phase after promoting with a metal-oxide dopant. (49−51) The foreign cations are located in the lattice position of Zr4+ cations. Besides the main tetragonal phase, Cr10Zr90/HMS and Cr10Zr90/MCM-41 also contain tiny amounts of the monoclinic ZrO2 phase (Figure S1a). For the supports containing Ti, we also identified crystalline TiO2 stabilized in the anatase phase. Regardless of the kind of support, no XRD patterns characteristic of crystalline Cr2O3 could be identified.
The size of crystallites of tetragonal ZrO2 in the supported catalysts is given in Table 1. It varies from 3.2 to 34.5 nm depending on the kind of support. Cr/(Cr + Zr) molar ratio also has an impact on size. In general, it decreases with an increase in Cr content, while the kind of ZrO2 phase does not change. However, when the Cr/(Cr + Zr) ratio increased to 0.3, amorphous ZrO2 was identified (Table 1 and Figure S1b).
To derive insights into the distribution of CrOx species, we carried out UV–vis diffuse reflectance and EPR measurements. The UV–vis spectra are shown in Figure 1. The spectra of the catalysts possessing CrOx or CrZrOx are characterized by bands at about 276 and 374 nm, which could be ascribed to O2– → Cr6+ charge transfer in tetrahedrally coordinated chromate species. (52) A band at about 463 nm is additionally present in the spectra of all catalysts with supported CrOx and can be due to d–d transition of Cr3+ in polymerized amorphous CrOx clusters. (53) An additional band at about 600 nm was identified in the spectrum of CrOx/SiO2 and can be assigned to the d–d transitions of Cr3+ in crystalline Cr2O3. (54) A band at about 700 nm is present in the spectrum of CrOx/7.7SiTiO2. It could be due to the interaction of Cr3+ with TiO2, thus resulting in a red shift of the d–d transitions of Cr3+ in crystalline Cr2O3. (55)
Figure 1
Figure 1. UV–vis spectra of catalysts with supported (a) CrOx or (b) Cr10Zr90 oxide species.
In comparison with the spectra of CrOx/SiO2 and CrOx/AlSiOx, the intensity of the bands at about 463 and 600 nm in the spectra of Cr10Zr90/SiO2 and Cr10Zr90/AlSiOx decreased significantly. This indicates that the latter samples contain lower concentrations of Cr2O3 and Cr3+ in polymerized amorphous CrOx clusters in favor of tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ species. In other words, dispersion of chromium species is increased in the presence of ZrO2. The below EPR data support this conclusion.
Figure 2 shows the EPR spectra of selected catalysts with supported CrOx or CrZrOx species. It should be especially mentioned that the catalysts were initially reduced in H2 (50 vol % H2 in N2) at 550 °C for 1 h to create EPR-active Cr3+ species. As the same treatment was applied before the catalytic tests, we analyzed the state of chromium species, which should be close to that under PDH conditions. The spectra of CrOx/SiO2 and CrOx/7.7SiTiO2 are dominated by a broad symmetric signal with a g-factor of around 1.97 (Figure 2). This signal can be due to clustering of CrOx species. (56,57) In addition to such species, these catalysts possess tiny amounts of isolated Cr3+Ox species as concluded from the presence of a narrow signal with a g-factor of 1.975 or 1.974 for CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/7.7SiTiO2. (58,59) Contrary to these two catalysts, isolated Cr3+ species are the major sites in CrOx/Al2O3. Cr2O3 clusters are present in tiny amounts only.

The difference in the distribution of CrOx species in CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/7.7SiTiO2, and CrOx/Al2O3 proves the decisive role of the kind of support for interaction with CrOx. The stronger the interaction, the higher the dispersion of CrOx will be. In addition to the kind of support, the distribution can also be controlled by the presence of ZrO2. As seen in Figure 2, the intensity of the broad EPR signal becomes lower, while that of the narrow EPR signal becomes higher when comparing ZrO2-free and ZrO2-containing samples. Such changes prove that the concentration of Cr3+Ox clusters in all CrZrOx-containing samples decreases in favor of isolated Cr3+ species. This effect is the most pronounced for CrZrOx/SiO2. The dispersion of chromium, however, decreases when the concentration of Cr increases (Figure S2).
Effect of Support on Catalyst Reducibility
H2-TPR measurements were performed to check if CrOx in CrZrOx affects reducibility of ZrO2 and if the latter property is influenced by the kind of support. We shall start with the discussion on the effect of support on reducibility of Cr10Zr90Ox. The obtained H2-TPR profiles are shown in Figure 3a. The reduction occurs in a broad temperature range. Depending on the catalyst, there are one or several maxima (Tmax) of H2 consumption. The Tmax values are given in Table 1. These values for the catalysts possessing either CrOx or ZrO2 are 464 or 609 °C (Figure 3b). In comparison with these materials, the Tmax values for the catalysts with supported CrZrOx are located at lower temperatures, especially in the case of supports containing Ti. This result strongly suggests that reducibility of CrOx and/or ZrO2 is improved when these species coexist in a form of mixed CrZrOx species. Such an effect depends, however, on the kind of support. The Tmax value of H2 consumption over Cr10Zr90/7.7SiTiO2 is about 339 °C, while there are two Tmax at 337 and 468 °C in the H2-TPR profile of Cr10Zr90/12SiTiO2. The Tmax values for Cr10Zr90/AlSiOx and Cr10Zr90/Al2O3 are 371 and 409 °C, respectively. With the exception of Cr10Zr90/Silicagel, reduction of CrZrOx supported on the surface of silica-based supports occurs below 400 °C.
Figure 3
Figure 3. H2-TPR profiles of (a) Cr10Zr90 supported on different supports and (b) CrOx, ZrO2, or CrxZry oxide species supported on SiO2.
The amount of H2 consumed by each catalyst in the H2-TPR tests is given in Table 1. This amount is directly related to the ability of the catalysts to release lattice oxygen during reductive treatment. The lowest amount of 15.9 μmol H2 g–1 was determined for ZrO2/SiO2, while CrOx/SiO2 consumed about 13 times higher amount (213.5 μmol H2 g–1) of H2. Thus, there is no doubt that CrOx releases its lattice oxygen easier than ZrO2. Importantly, when CrOx and ZrO2 were present in the form of CrZrOx on the surface of SiO2, the amount of H2 consumed was higher than the sum of the corresponding values determined for ZrO2/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2, i.e., 366.2 vs 229.4 μmol H2 g–1. Thus, there appears to be a synergy effect between CrOx and ZrO2 in terms of their ability to release their lattice oxygen. It is also worth mentioning that the strength of this effect depends on the kind of support. The highest amount of H2 was consumed by Cr10Zr90/12SiTiO2, while Cr10Zr90/Silicagel released the lowest amount of lattice oxygen. It was even lower than the sum of the corresponding values determined for ZrO2/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2. The size of ZrO2 crystallites in CrZrOx on the surface of silica supports is relevant for catalyst reducibility too. As seen in Figure S3, the smaller the size, the higher the amount of H2 consumed. For example, this amount for Cr10Zr90/SiO2 with the smallest ZrO2 crystallites was about 2 times higher than that for Cr10Zr90/Silicagel possessing the largest ZrO2 crystallites.
Effect of Cr Promoter on Redox Properties of ZrO2
Now, we turn our discussion to the results of H2-TPR tests with CrZrOx/SiO2 catalysts differing in the ratio of Cr/(Cr + Zr). As SiO2 cannot be reduced under our H2-TPR conditions, we can safely investigate the effect of the ratio of Cr/(Cr + Zr) in CrxZry/SiO2 on the ability of CrZrOx for releasing lattice oxygen. An important fundamental question was to check if the presence of chromium affects the reducibility of ZrO2. As seen in Figure 3b, the H2-TPR profiles of all CrxZry/SiO2 are characterized by a well-resolved H2 consumption with Tmax between 360 and 400 °C and a less-resolved H2 consumption with Tmax at about 500 °C. As the lower-temperature consumption increases with chromium content, it should be related to the reduction of CrOx.
For analyzing transformation of Cr6+ to Cr3+, we applied in situ UV–vis spectroscopy. To this end, the UV–vis spectra were recorded at 550 °C under oxidizing (20 vol % O2 in N2) and reducing (50 vol % H2 in N2) conditions. They are shown in Figure S4. For the samples tested, a decrease in the intensity of the band at about 400 nm was observed upon catalyst exposure to the reducing atmosphere. This means that Cr6+ was reduced to Cr3+. The presence of the latter species in the reduced samples was additionally proven by ex situ EPR measurements (Figure 2). The strength of the changes in the UV–vis spectra, however, depended on Cr content. The band at about 400 nm almost vanished in the spectrum of Cr3Zr97/SiO2 but existed in higher loaded samples, particularly in the spectrum of Cr30Zr70/SiO2. Thus, a part of Cr6+ was not reduced or small XRD-amorphous Cr2O3 clusters are present in this material.
The higher-temperature H2 consumption in the H2-TPR profiles in Figure 3b can be attributed to hydrogen reaction with surface lattice oxygen of ZrO2. In comparison with bare ZrO2/SiO2, this reaction on CrxZry/SiO2 occurs at lower temperatures due to the following reason. Oxidized CrOx species are reduced at lower temperature in comparison with ZrO2. So-generated reduced Cr3+ species are able to activate/dissociate H2 in the course of H2-TPR. Activated hydrogen species may spill over to ZrO2 and react with lattice oxygen to yield OH groups. The latter recombine with the formation of water and anion vacancy in the lattice of ZrO2.
To check if anion vacancies are really formed upon catalyst reduction, we applied in situ EPR spectroscopy. This technique is powerful for detecting small amounts of paramagnetic species with F+ centers being characteristic for one electron trapped into anion vacancy. EPR spectra were recorded at 300°C in a flow containing either 5 vol % O2 or 5 vol % CO in He. No F+ centers were observed under oxidizing conditions, while they appeared upon reductive catalyst treatment (Figure S5).
Our DFT calculations further support the positive effect of chromium promoter on reducibility of ZrO2. As proven by our EPR measurements, reduced CrZrOx/support catalysts contain highly dispersed Cr3+ species (Figure 2). As a result, it was assumed that CrZrOx is a solid solution of Cr3+ in ZrO2. The latter statement is supported by the fact that ZrO2 is stabilized in the tetragonal phase (Figure S1) as expected after promoting ZrO2 with metal-oxide dopants. (49−51) Thus, our DFT model was based on the tetragonal ZrO2(101) surface where Cr3+ substitutes one Zr4+. Details about used models are provided in the Supporting Information “Computational Models”. For the most favorable CrZrOx model, oxygen vacancy can be most easily formed (2.39 eV) upon removal of lattice oxygen type a1 in Figure S6a and is located near the Cr3+ site (Figure S6b). This model, denoted 1Ov-CrZrOx, was further used for elucidating if and how the presence of Cr3+ affects the formation of an additional anion vacancy. A model with two anion vacancies was constructed by replacing one Zr4+ with one Cr3+ and removing two O2–. It is denoted 2Ov-CrZrOx (Figure S6e). We considered two general options: (i) zirconium and chromium cations are located around Ov required for charge-compensating upon ZrO2 promoting with Cr3+ and (ii) three Zrcus are around the second Ov. For the first kind, we distinguish between [Zr6cI, Zr6cII]-Ov and [Zr6cI, Cr4c]-Ov (Figure S6e). The obtained energies required for removal of one lattice oxygen from 1Ov-CrZrOx are summarized in Table S1. The lowest energy of 5.1 eV was calculated for the removal of lattice oxygen b1 (Figure S6b). Although this value is larger than that for the creation of the first Ov (5.10 vs 2.39 eV), it is lower than the energy required for creating the second anion vacancy on the surface of bare t-ZrO2 (5.45 and 5.31 eV). Importantly, the overall formation energy of two oxygen vacancies on the surface of the CrZrOx(101) model is 7.49 eV, which is much lower than 10.76 eV for the unpromoted t-ZrO2(101) model. Thus, we can safely conclude that incorporating Cr3+ into the lattice of ZrO2 can facilitate oxygen vacancy formation. Such a process will be even more favorable if reducing reagents such as H2 or CO are used as previously demonstrated by us for tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2. (23,45)
Taking the above discussion into account, we deconvoluted the H2-TPR profiles of CrxZry/SiO2 with the purpose to distinguish between reduction of CrOx and ZrO2 (Figure S7). The corresponding amounts of hydrogen consumed were determined and are shown in Figure 4a.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Effect of Cr loading in CrxZry/SiO2 samples on (a) the amount of H2 consumed by CrOx or ZrO2 and on (b) the ratio of H2 consumed by CrOx to that by ZrO2.
As expected, the amount of hydrogen consumed by CrOx was higher than that consumed by ZrO2. For both CrOx and ZrO2, the amount of oxygen released increased with Cr loading, thus proving the positive effect of Cr on the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen. However, the ratio of H2 consumed by CrOx to that of ZrO2 increased with the loading (Figure 4b). Such a dependence suggests that there is a limit for the amount of lattice oxygen that can be removed from ZrO2 in the investigated temperature range.
Acidic Properties
The influence of the kind of support and the ratio of Cr/(Cr + Zr) on overall acidity was analyzed by means of NH3-TPD tests. The NH3-TPD profiles were obtained using prereduced samples (see the section “Characterization”) and are shown in Figure S8. They are characterized by a broad asymmetric peak in the temperature range between 180 and 550 °C. Such a shape of NH3-TPD profiles implies the existence of several nonresolved peaks, which can be related to the presence of acidic sites of different strengths. An overall surface density of acidic sites was calculated from these profiles assuming that one NH3 molecule can be adsorbed on one acidic site. The corresponding values for each catalyst are listed in Table 1. The highest density of acidic sites was determined for Cr10Zr90/7.7SiTiO2 as a consequence of the presence of acidic Ti sites. (60,61) Compared with Cr10Zr90/AlSiOx, the density of acidic sites in Cr10Zr90/SiO2 was lower due to the absence of acidic Al3+ sites in the latter catalyst.
Additional insights into the origin of catalyst acidity were derived from analyzing the NH3-TPD data obtained for CrxZry/SiO2 with different Cr/(Cr + Zr). As SiO2 does not possess acidic sites, their presence in CrxZry/SiO2 should be due to CrOx and/or ZrO2. From a quantitative point of view, the density of acidic sites increases on increasing the Cr/(Cr + Zr) molar ratio (Table 1). For illustrating that acidic sites can be created upon catalyst reduction, we tried to correlate the acidity with the amount of H2 consumed by CrOx or ZrO2 as determined from H2-TPR tests (Figure 3a). As seen in Figure 5, there is a correlation between the density of acidic sites and the amount of hydrogen consumed; the higher the amount, the higher the density. The positive effect is more pronounced when considering the amount of H2 consumed by ZrO2. This amount actually reflects the concentration of Zrcus sites, which are of Lewis-acid character. (26)
Figure 5
Figure 5. Density of acidic sites versus the amount of H2 consumed by ZrO2 or CrOx in H2-TPR tests with CrxZry/SiO2 and ZrO2/SiO2.
It cannot, however, be excluded that Cr3+ sites also contribute to catalyst acidity. This statement is supported by the following discussion. It is obvious from Figure S8b that a shoulder with a maximum at around 500 °C in the NH3-TPD profiles related to strong acidic sites becomes more pronounced with rising chromium loading. Such an effect contrasts with our previous study where we demonstrated that the concentration of strong acidic sites decreases after promoting ZrO2 with La2O3, Y2O3, Sm2O3, CaO, MgO, or Li2O. (26) The decrease was explained by the fact that these dopants are of basic character. Taking the present and our previous results into account, we put forward that the strong acidic sites in the CrxZry/SiO2 catalysts are due to Cr3+.
Catalyst Activity
Figure 6a shows the rate of propene formation over Cr10Zr90/support catalysts. With the exception of Cr10Zr90/Silicagel, all other catalysts on the basis of SiO2 supports revealed a significantly higher rate of propene formation than those containing Al or Ti in the supports. As we demonstrated in our recent paper, (25) the presence of Al in ZrO2 (bulk mixed AlZrOx) had a negative influence on the activity in dehydrogenation of iso-butane. The activity of the present supported catalysts increased with a decrease in Al content or an increase in Ti content in the AlSiOx or SiTiO2 supports. The rates of propene formation over Cr10Zr90/AlSiOx and Cr10Zr90/7.7SiTiO2 were about 2 and 1.6 times higher than over Cr10Zr90/Al2O3 and Cr10Zr90/12SiTiO2, respectively. Although MCM-41, HMS, SiO2, and Silicagel are composed of silicon and oxygen, the activity of supported Cr10Zr90x oxide species strongly depends on the kind of silica. The highest rate of propene formation was achieved over Cr10Zr90/SiO2 and was about 20% higher than that over Cr10Zr90/MCM-41 and Cr10Zr90/HMS and about 2.4 times higher than that over Cr10Zr90/Silicagel.
Figure 6
Figure 6. (a) Rate of propene formation (r(C3H6)) over catalysts with supported CrZrOx (black circles), ZrO2 (red circles), or CrOx (blue circles); (b) dependence of the rate of propene formation on the molar fraction of Cr in mixed CrZrOx supported on SiO2. Reaction conditions: 40 vol % C3H8 in N2; 50 mg of catalyst, WHSV = 34.5 h–1; T = 550 °C. The catalysts were reduced at 550 °C in 50 vol % H2 in N2 for 1 h.
For comparative purposes, ZrO2/support and CrOx/support were also tested in propane dehydrogenation under the same conditions as their CrZrOx-containing counterparts. All ZrO2/support showed very low activity, which did not strongly depend on the kind of support. Contrarily, the support affected the activity of supported CrOx species (Figure 6a). CrOx/SiO2 and CrOx/7.7SiTiO2 revealed slightly higher activity than ZrO2/SiO2 and ZrO2/7.7SiTiO2, respectively. A significantly higher rate of propene formation was obtained over CrOx/AlSiOx and CrOx/Al2O3.
When comparing the activity of catalysts with CrOx, ZrO2, or CrZrOx species, the following important results should be especially mentioned. The rate of propene formation over Cr10Zr90/SiO2 or Cr10Zr90/7.7SiTiO2 was considerably higher than the sum of the rates over CrOx/SiO2 and ZrO2/SiO2 or CrOx/7.7SiTiO2 and ZrO2/7.7SiTiO2. The CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst showed higher activity than Cr10Zr90/Al2O3 and ZrO2/Al2O3. The sum of the rates over CrOx/AlSiOx and ZrO2/AlSiOx was close to the rate over Cr10Zr90/AlSiOx. Thus, depending on the kind of support, there exists a synergy effect between CrOx and ZrO2 in terms of their activity in propane dehydrogenation to propene. Fundamentals of this phenomenon are elucidated and discussed in the section “Factors Affecting Catalyst Activity” together with additional catalytic data presented below and the results of catalyst characterization.
As seen in Figure 6b, the rate of propene formation increased with increasing Cr/(Cr + Zr) molar ratio. It is, however, worth mentioning that the increase is much stronger at low chromium content. For example, when the ratio of Cr/(Cr + Zr) increased by a factor of two, i.e., from 0.05 to 0.1, an about 1.7-fold increase in the rate of propene formation was observed (from 0.53 to 0.90 mmol g–1 min–1). At higher chromium content, the rate increased from 0.9 to only 1.1 mmol g–1 min–1 upon doubling the Cr/(Cr + Zr) ratio from 0.1 to 0.2. Thus, these results suggest that the rate of propene formation does not directly depend on Cr loading.
Selectivity of CrZrOx/SiO2 Compared with Analogue of Commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3
To benchmark our catalysts with an analogue of commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3 in terms of product selectivity, we performed catalytic tests at different degrees of propane conversion and constructed selectivity-conversion dependences for propene and side products. Figure 7 shows the effect of propane conversion on the selectivity to propene, coke, and cracking products (CH4, C2H6, and C2H4).
Figure 7
Figure 7. Selectivity (S) to propene, cracking products, and coke versus propane conversion (X) over Cr10Zr90/SiO2 (black circles) and an analogue of commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3 (red circles).
For both catalysts, the selectivity to propene decreased from about 100% at close to zero propane conversion to about 85% with rising propane conversion to about 25–30%. Importantly, in the whole range of propane conversion, the selectivity to propene over Cr10Zr90/SiO2 was only slightly lower than that over K-CrOx/Al2O3. For both catalysts, the negative effect of propane conversion on the target selectivity implies that propene formed directly from propane is converted subsequently to coke and cracking products (CH4, C2H6, and C2H4). Coke formation seems to be the main side reaction of propene. For example, coke selectivity of about 10% was achieved at about 30% propane conversion, while the selectivity to cracking products did not exceed 4% at the same degree of conversion.
Catalyst Durability
Practical relevance of Cr10Zr90/SiO2, Cr20Zr80/SiO2, and Cr30Zr70/SiO2 was demonstrated in a long-term stability test consisting of 50 PDH/regeneration cycles performed at 550, 600, and 625 °C. Each cycle included a dehydrogenation cycle lasting for 47.5 min followed by a regeneration step in an airflow at the same temperature for 15 min. One of the best-performing bulk ZrO2-based catalysts (0.05% Ru/YZrOx) introduced in our previous paper and an analogue of commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3 were used for comparative purposes. (24) To achieve similar propane conversion of about 30% at 550 °C over all catalysts, we used different WHSVs for each catalyst as they showed different intrinsic PDH activities.
The maximal STY (space-time yield of propene) obtained in each cycle is shown in Figure 8a, while the corresponding selectivity values are shown in Figure S9. All CrZrOx-containing catalysts showed slightly lower selectivity than 0.05% Ru/YZrOx and K-CrOx/Al2O3. However, as seen in Figure 8a, CrZrOx/SiO2 catalysts revealed higher STY at 550 °C despite the fact that they possess about 2.5 times lower Zr content or 9 times lower Cr content than 0.05% Ru/YZrOx or K-CrOx/Al2O3. Cr30Zr70/SiO2 demonstrated the highest productivity among all samples tested: the achieved STY value was about 3 times higher than that for K-CrOx/Al2O3. The activity of CrZrOx/SiO2 slightly decreased with a decrease in chromium content; Cr10Zr90/SiO2 demonstrated about 24% lower productivity than Cr30Zr70/SiO2.

(a) Maximal mass-based space-time yield (STY) obtained for each catalytic cycle over Cr10Zr90/SiO2 (black circles), Cr20Zr80/SiO2 (red circles), Cr30Zr70/SiO2 (blue circles), 0.05% Ru/YZrOx (green circles), and an analogue of commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3 (magenta circles) in a series of 50 PDH/regeneration cycles at 550, 600, and 625 °C with WHSV of 4.32, 11.52, and 14.40 h–1 for Cr10Zr90/SiO2, 5.18, 13.82, and 17.27 h–1 for Cr20Zr80/SiO2, 5.44, 14.52, and 18.14 h–1 for Cr30Zr70/SiO2, and 1.44, 4.32, and 8.64 h–1 for 0.05% Ru/YZrOx and K-CrOx/Al2O3; (24) (b) dependence of STY of propene on chromium content for SiO2 supported Cr–Zr mixed oxides from this work (red circles) and for CrOx-containing catalysts described elsewhere (black circles): Cr2O3(2)/ZrO2(30)/SBA-15, (2) 2.5Cr-Ni/Al, (29) CrZr5K0.2, (31) Cr10ZrO90Ox, (35) 9CrAl, (34) Cr20/CMK-3, (62) and Cr20/Al2O3-n. (63)
In terms of durability, Cr30Zr70/SiO2 deactivated to some extent from cycle to cycle, while Cr10Zr90/SiO2 and Cr20Zr80/SiO2 did not show any significant changes. At 600 °C, the STY values obtained over supported CrZrOx catalysts were still superior to or comparable with those of 0.05% Ru/YZrOx and K-CrOx/Al2O3. At 625 °C, they showed slightly lower activity due to fast deactivation (Figure S10). Nevertheless, CrZrOx/SiO2 with an exception of Cr30Zr70/SiO2 restored their high propene productivity when the reaction temperature dropped back to 550 °C.
To demonstrate the potential of our supported catalysts in terms of propene productivity, we constructed Figure 8b, benchmarking them against the most active CrOx-based catalysts described in refs (2,29,31,34,35,62,63) in terms of STY as a function of chromium content. One can clearly see that CrZrOx/SiO2 materials exhibit higher STY than other catalysts possessing even higher amounts of Cr. Although bulk Cr10Zr90Ox showed higher activity than Cr10Zr90/SiO2, it possessed about 2.3 times higher contents of chromium and zirconium (Figure 8b). Moreover, the latter catalyst also showed superior onstream stability (Figure S11). Thus, our supported catalysts are attractive catalysts for PDH: they are cheaper than bulk catalysts, possess lower contents of Cr and Zr, and maintain high productivity.
Active Sites for Propane Dehydrogenation
To derive an insight into the kind of active sites for propane dehydrogenation, we further analyzed catalytic and characterization data as well as performed DFT calculations. We shall start with the discussion of the experimental results and then provide theoretical data in a separate section.
As a first step, we used the rate of propene formation over SiO2 supported catalysts with different ratios of Cr/(Cr + Zr) for estimating Cr-related (eq 5) or Zrcus-related (eq 6) turnover frequency (TOF). The amount of Zrcus was suggested to be equal to the amount of H2 consumed by ZrO2 in H2-TPR tests (Figures 4 and S7). The effect of chromium content on the TOF value is shown in Figure 9a. For comparative purposes, the TOF values for CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3, CrOx/AlSiOx, and CrOx/7.7SiTiO2 are also provided. It is obvious that these catalysts are less active than CrxZry/SiO2. The low intrinsic activity of CrOx/SiO2 and CrOx/7.7SiTiO2 is due to the low dispersion of CrOx species (Figure 2). This conclusion is indirectly supported by the fact that CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/AlSiOx possessing mainly isolated CrOx are characterized by significantly higher TOF values, which are similar to each other. These high values are, however, lower than that obtained for Cr10Zr90/SiO2 with the same Cr loading but possessing less dispersed CrOx species (Figure 2). Thus, the intrinsic activity of CrOx seems to depend on the kind of support simply affecting CrOx dispersion and on the presence of ZrO2.
Figure 9
Figure 9. (a) Cr-related (open symbols and solid circles) and Zrcus-related (red circles) TOF over CrOx/SiO2 (○), CrOx/7.7SiTiOx (Δ), CrOx/Al2O3 (▽), and CrOx/AlSiOx (◊) as well as over CrxZry/SiO2 (black and red circles) and (b) relationship between r(C3H6) and crystallite size of ZrO2 in supported Cr10Zr90 mixed oxides.
When analyzing the effect of chromium loading on Cr-related TOF for CrZrOx/SiO2 catalysts, it becomes obvious that the TOF value decreases with rising Cr content (Figure 9a). The decrease is also evident even for samples with Cr loading below 1 wt %, where isolated CrOx is the dominant species, i.e., the effect of CrOx dispersion on TOF should be minimized. Such dependence indicates that Cr sites are not the only active sites participating in the PDH reaction. Importantly, the TOF value related to Zrcus does not obviously depend on Cr loading. This result strongly suggests that Zrcus sites are actively participating in the PDH reaction.
To further support our statement about the importance of Zrcus, we applied IR spectroscopy for analyzing Lewis acidic sites. In particular, we focused on the effects of catalyst reduction treatment (oxidizing vs reducing) and Cr loading on the concentration of such sites. IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded at 200 °C and are shown in Figure S12. Lewis acidic sites characterized by a band at 1446 cm–1 are present in oxidized ZrOx/SiO2. They can be ascribed to surface Zr cations. (64) Overall Lewis acidity increased after catalyst reduction (Figure S12a,b). When considering H2-TPR (Figure 3b and Table 1) and in situ EPR (Figure S5) data, the increase should be related to the formation of Zrcus sites. A similar effect of the kind of catalyst treatment on acidity was observed for the Cr30Zr70/SiO2 catalyst. The presence of Cr seems to be decisive for the concentration of Lewis acidic sites (Figure S12c). However, the main contributor to such sites should be Zrcus, as concluded from the fact that there is a direct correlation between the intensity of the band at about 1446 cm–1 and the amount of oxygen removed from ZrO2 (Figure S13a,c). Contrarily, such dependence was not established for the amount of oxygen released by CrOx (Figure S13b,d). For a rough estimation, we calculated apparent TOF values of propene formation related to the intensity of the band at 1446 cm–1. The values obtained for the Cr3Zr97/SiO2, Cr7Zr93/SiO2, and Cr30Zr70/SiO2 samples were close to each other but significantly higher than that for ZrOx/SiO2 (Figure S14). Thus, Zrcus should be the main active species for the PDH reaction, while CrOx helps generate them under reducing conditions and/or affects their intrinsic activity. The DFT calculations described later provide support for the latter statement.
Molecular-Level Details on C3H8 Dehydrogenation over CrZrOx
For verifying the above statement on the kind of active sites, we have performed DFT calculations. We tested various CrZrOx models, which are shown in the section “Computational Models” in the Supporting Information and in Figures 10, S6, S15, Tables S1 and S2. They differ in the kind of active site and in the number (one or two) of anion vacancies. One vacancy is formed upon promoting ZrO2 with Cr3+ for charge compensation. The reason for considering models with two vacancies is based on the positive effect of the chromium promoter on reducibility of ZrO2. The models with one anion vacancy considered active sites consisting of one Cr4c and one Zr6cI, one Cr4c and one O3c, or one Zr6cI and one Zr6cII (Figure S6). None of these models can explain the enhancing effect of the dopant on the rate of propene formation (Table S2). Importantly, the model with two anion vacancies (2Ov-CrZrOx(101); for model details, see the Supporting Information) predicts such an effect. Thus, our further discussion is based on this model.
Figure 10
Figure 10. Calculated energy profiles and optimized structures of intermediates along the pathway of PDH to propene over 2Ov-CrZrOx(101) and 1Ov-t-ZrO2(101) surfaces (Cr, purple; Zr, light blue; C, gray; O, red; and H, white).
Two kinds of active sites were considered: (i) two Zrcus cations ([Zr6cI, Zr6cII]-Ov) or one Zrcus and one Cr4c ([Zr6cI, Cr4c]-Ov) located at an anion vacancy and (ii) three Zrcus around another Ov not located at chromium (Figure S6e). We explored the activity of the first kind of active site for breaking the C–H bond. As the second type does not differ from that for the bare defective t-ZrO2, its activity should also be similar to that of the latter. Thus, we computed the individual reaction pathways from propane to propene at the ([Zr6cI, Zr6cII]-Ov) and [Zr6cI, Cr4c]-Ov surfaces (Figures 10 and S15).
The methylene C–H bond in C3H8 dissociates homolytically on [Zr6cI, Zr6cII]-Ov or [Zr6cI, Cr4c]-Ov (Figures 10 and S15; see Path A and Path B). This step is slightly endothermic by 0.01 or 0.15 eV. On an elementary-step level, the iso-C3H7 fragment is bound at the Zr6cI or Cr4c site, while the remaining H atom is located at the bridge position between the Zr6cI and Zr6cII cations. The barrier for breaking the C–H bond on [Zr6cI, Zr6cII]-Ov is slightly lower than that on [Zr6cI, Cr4c]-Ov (0.99 vs 1.05 eV Figures 10, S15 and Table S2). We also examined several possible routes of methyl C–H bond activation in iso-C3H7 adsorbed on Zr6cI or Cr4c. For the Zr6cI-iso-C3H7 species, the most thermodynamically and kinetically preferred route is methyl C–H bond dissociation on Zr6cI. The remaining H atom is adsorbed on the neighboring Zr6cI center. This step is endothermic (0.46 eV) with the barrier of 0.86 eV, which is lower than the barrier for breaking the methylene C–H bond (0.99 eV) in propane (Figures 10 and S15). The formed propene can desorb easily with the desorption energy of 0.06 eV. For the Cr4c-iso-C3H7 species, H formed upon breaking the methylene C–H bond must be transferred to the neighboring Zr6cI to form the Zr6cI-H. This step requires 0.27 eV (Figure S15). The subsequent propene formation is endothermic (with 0.04 eV) and has the barrier of 0.85 eV. For both [Zr6cI, Zr6cII]-Ov and [Zr6cI, Cr4cI]-Ov, H2 formation is endothermic by 0.75 eV (Figure 10 and Table S2), while the reversed H2 dissociation is barrier-less. Considering the energies for dissociation of methylene C–H (0.99 vs 1.05 eV) and methyl C–H (0.86 vs 0.85 eV) bonds as well as the overall barrier for propene formation (0.95 vs 1.23 eV) over the [Zr6cI, Zr6cII]-Ov and [Zr6cI, Cr4cI]-Ov sites, the former appears to be more energetically favorable.
To illustrate the positive effect of chromium promoter for ZrO2 on PDH, we prepared Figure 10 showing the full potential energy surfaces of the most preferable routes on 2Ov-CrZrOx(101) and 1Ov-t-ZrO2(101) (defective t-ZrO2(101) used in our previous study for bare t-ZrO2). (45) Although two Zrcus cations are responsible for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene and hydrogen over these model surfaces, there are remarkable differences between them. First of all, as seen in Figure 10, the highest apparent barrier for PDH over 2Ov-CrZrOx(101) is lower (0.95 vs 1.13 eV) than that over 1Ov-t-ZrO2(101). This is in agreement with our experimental data demonstrating that the rate of propene formation increases with chromium loading in ZrO2 (Figure 6b), while the Zrcus-related TOF values are independent of the loading (Figure 9a).
On a molecular level, methylene C–H bond activation on 2Ov-CrZrOx(101) requires higher (0.99 vs 0.61 eV) energy than on 1Ov-t-ZrO2(101), while the activation of the methyl C–H bond in Zr6cI-iso-C3H7 occurs easier (0.86 vs 0.92 eV) on 2Ov-CrZrOx(101). The energy for propene formation is also lower for the latter model. Moreover, H2 formation is also positively affected by the presence of chromium. This reaction step over 2Ov-CrZrOx(101) requires 0.42 eV less energy than over 1Ov-t-ZrO2(101), i.e., 0.75 vs 1.17 eV. Taking all of the reaction pathways and the corresponding barriers in Figure 10 into account, one can conclude that the rate-limiting step in the course of PDH over 1Ov-t-ZrO2(101) is H2 formation, while breaking the C–H bond in propane is the least kinetically favorable over 2Ov-CrZrOx(101). The latter conclusion was validated by pulse experiments with C3H8 or C3D8 in the temporal analysis of product (TAP) reactor operating at millisecond contact times, which are significantly shorter in comparison with steady-state catalytic tests. Small amounts of C3H6 were detected upon C3H8 pulsing over Cr20Zr80/SiO2 at 550 °C, while formation of C3D6 was observed upon pulsing of C3D8 first at a higher temperature of 600 °C (Figure S16). Such a large difference in propene formation from C3H8 and C3D8 is caused by participation of hydrogen atoms in the rate-limiting step. Owing to the uniqueness of the TAP technique in carrying out pulse tests with very low amounts of molecules pulsed in comparison with the number of active sites, any negative influence of strongly adsorbed intermediates on product formation is excluded. Thus, hydrogen desorption cannot limit propene formation under the applied pulse conditions. Keeping this in mind, we can conclude that the different activity of Cr20Zr80/SiO2 for propene formation from C3H8 and C3D8 should be related to the fact that breaking the C–H(D) bond is involved in the rate-limiting step.
In summary, DFT calculations predict that two Zrcus form the active site on the surface of Cr-containing and Cr-free ZrO2. In Cr presence, the kinds of rate-limiting step and energies of individual pathways, however, change in such a way that the PDH reaction becomes more energetically favorable. Such a positive effect might be due to the fact that chromium improves the intrinsic activity of Zrcus cations. Besides, as proven by H2-TPR and DFT calculations (see section 3.3: Effect of Cr Promoter on Redox Properties of ZrO2), Cr improves reducibility of ZrO2. Thus, in comparison with bare tetragonal ZrO2, which is difficult to reduce, (45) the concentration of anion vacancies and accordingly Zrcus is higher, which is also a reason for the higher activity of CrZrOx/SiO2 materials.
Factors Affecting Catalyst Activity
As demonstrated in the previous sections, there is a synergy effect between the CrOx and Zrcus sites in terms of the rate of propene formation due to the positive effect of the former on the activity of the latter. However, the strength of such a synergy effect depends on the kind of support. The rate of propene formation over Cr10Zr90/SiO2 was about 4 times higher than the sum of the rates of propene formation determined for ZrO2/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 (Figure 6a). A similar but less pronounced effect was observed for the catalysts on the basis of the 7.7SiTiO2 support. The rate of propene formation over Cr10Zr90/7.7SiTiO2 was about 2 times higher than the sum of the rates of propene formation over ZrO2/7.7SiTiO2 and CrOx/7.7SiTiO2 (Figure 6a). It is worth mentioning that no synergy effect was observed over catalysts on the basis of AlSiOx and Al2O3 supports. The rate of propene formation over Cr10Zr90/AlSiOx was almost equal to the sum of the rates determined for ZrO2/AlSiOx and CrOx/AlSiOx, while that over Cr10Zr90/Al2O3 was even lower than the sum of the rates obtained over ZrO2/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3 (Figure 6a).
The support effect on the strength of the synergy effect between CrOx and Zrcus sites might be due to the different strengths of interaction between different supports and CrOx and/or ZrO2. This statement is indirectly supported by the results of UV–vis (Figure 1) and EPR (Figure 2) studies. These data suggest that the interaction between CrOx and SiO2 is much weaker than that between CrOx and M(Al or Ti)Ox. Moreover, for the CrZrOx/SiO2 catalysts, the interaction between CrOx and SiO2 is much weaker than that between CrOx and ZrOx. Therefore, the usage of SiO2-based materials with a high surface area and low ability to strongly interact with CrOx results in the formation of CrZrOx in the presence of ZrO2. Such mixed-oxide phase reveals high activity for the PDH reaction.
The strength of interaction between the support and active components does not seem to be the only factor influencing the activity of CrZrOx. As seen in Figure 6a, the type of silica support (SiO2, HMS, MCM-41, or Silicagel) is also important for propene formation. This can be explained when considering our previous conclusion on the role of the size of crystallites of bare monoclinic ZrO2 for PDH activity. (23) The smaller the size, the higher the rate of propene formation was. Such a relationship seems to be of general character and is obviously valid for catalysts with supported CrZrOx. Figure 9b shows a good correlation between the size of ZrO2 crystallites and the rate of propene formation over catalysts on the basis of a certain support. For example, Cr10Zr90/Silicagel with the largest ZrO2 crystallite size demonstrated the lowest rate of propene formation among all SiO2 supported catalysts, while Cr10Zr90/SiO2 composed of the smallest ZrO2 crystallites was the most active catalyst. The positive effect of crystallite size could lead to an increase in catalyst reducibility (Table 1 and Figure S3). The catalysts with smaller crystallites were reduced deeper in H2 flow. According to our previous work, (23) reducibility of ZrO2-based catalysts plays a crucial role in the formation of Zrcus active sites. Although CrZrOx/12SiTiO2 showed the highest reducibility, this catalyst revealed low PDH activity. This can be explained by the fact that ZrO2 was stabilized in a form of X-ray amorphous species in this catalyst, while the long-range order of ions in the lattice of ZrO2 was found to be relevant for achieving high PDH activity. (23)
Origins of Catalyst Deactivation
Although CrZrOx/SiO2 catalysts show high durability over 50 PDH/regeneration tests at different temperatures (Figure 8a), they deactivated with time on stream within each PDH cycle due to formation of carbon deposits. An insight into the effect of chromium content on the formation and the kind of carbon deposits was derived from the operando UV–vis tests with five CrZrOx/SiO2 catalysts at 550 °C. An initial conversion of propane over all of the tested catalysts was between 9 and 12% and decreased with rising time on the propane stream (Figure S17). The obtained UV–vis spectra of Cr3Zr97/SiO2, Cr10Zr90/SiO2, and Cr30Zr70/SiO2 expressed as the relative Kubelka–Munk function (F(Rrel) in eq 3) are shown in Figure 11a–c, while the corresponding data for Cr5Zr95/SiO2 and Cr20Zr80/SiO2 are given in Figure S18.

Regardless of catalyst composition, F(Rrel) increased across the whole wavelength range. The F(Rrel) value increased with time on the propane stream. Such reaction-induced changes are due to coke deposition. From a qualitative viewpoint, the spectra are characterized by three absorption bands with the maxima at about 420, 600 nm, and between 700 and 800 nm. According to Weckhuysen et al., (65) the two bands at high wavelengths can arise due to the presence of polyaromatic graphitic species. As seen in Figure 11d for all five CrZrOx/SiO2 catalysts, the ratio of F(Rrel) at 600 nm to that at 420 nm (F(Rrel)600/F(Rrel)420) changes (increases) with time on the propane stream. Such a temporal evolution of this ratio suggests that the bands with the maxima at 600 and 420 nm do not belong to the same coke species. Tentatively, the band with the maximum at about 420 nm can originate from low-condensed aromatic species as we also suggested in our previous studies of PDH over bare ZrO2. (23,45) As the F(Rrel)600/F(Rrel)420 ratio increases with time on the propane stream, one can assume that low-condensed aromatic species are initially formed and then converted into polyaromatic graphitic species. This process seems to be accelerated by chromium content. Moreover, the F(Rrel)600/F(Rrel)420 ratio increases too. A similar trend is also valid for the catalyst deactivation rate; the higher the chromium content, the faster the deactivation is.
Such dependence can be rationalized when taking into account the EPR data in Figure S2 and the discussion of catalyst acidity in the section “Acidic Properties”. An increase in the concentration of strong acidic sites and in the clustering degree of Cr3+ species was established with rising chromium content in the CrZrOx/SiO2 catalysts. On this basis, together with the results of operando UV–vis tests, one may conclude that the clusters owing to their strong acidity show higher activity for coke formation from propene than isolated CrOx species. This conclusion agrees with our previous study of PDH over supported VOx-based catalysts. (66) The effect of the speciation of CrOx on coke formation is formally related to the fact that high surface density of sites for propene (main source of coke) adsorption is required for its oligomerization and further condensation to large graphitic structures. The lowest rate of coke formation will be achieved over isolated CrOx species. As bare ZrO2 is also able to form coke, (23,45) this fact should also be taken into account when designing catalysts on the basis of binary CrZrOx.
Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The presented work provides fundamentals for controlling activity of catalysts with supported mixed CrZrOx species in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Owing to the different abilities of CrOx and ZrO2 to interact with the support and with each other, a synergy effect between these two types of catalytically active species can be achieved in terms of the propene formation rate especially when the interaction with the support is weak as in the case of silica. On the basis of DFT calculations, this effect was explained by a positive influence of the Cr3+ promoter in the lattice of ZrO2 on the intrinsic activity of two Zrcus sites, which form the active site for propane dehydrogenation.
In comparison with the state-of-the-art catalysts, both chromium and zirconium contents were significantly reduced in supported CrZrOx catalysts showing, however, unexpectedly high activity exceeding that of their Cr- or Zr-containing counterparts. Further improvements are expected when the distribution of Cr3+ within ZrO2 and the shape/size of ZrO2 crystallites can be tuned as these parameters are relevant for the formation of Zrcus sites.
