<quotes>
[1] "Two neighboring Zrcus (cus = coordinatively unsaturated) sites were concluded to be mainly responsible for propane dehydrogenation to propene."

[2] "Our DFT calculations further support the positive effect of chromium promoter on reducibility of ZrO2. As proven by our EPR measurements, reduced CrZrOx/support catalysts contain highly dispersed Cr3+ species (Figure 2). As a result, it was assumed that CrZrOx is a solid solution of Cr3+ in ZrO2."

[3] "The model with two anion vacancies (2Ov-CrZrOx(101); for model details, see the Supporting Information) predicts such an effect. Thus, our further discussion is based on this model." 

[4] "Two kinds of active sites were considered: (i) two Zrcus cations ([Zr6cI, Zr6cII]-Ov) or one Zrcus and one Cr4c ([Zr6cI, Cr4c]-Ov) located at an anion vacancy and (ii) three Zrcus around another Ov not located at chromium (Figure S6e)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the studied CrZrOx catalysts. According to the quotes, it concludes that two neighboring Zrcus sites are mainly responsible for propane dehydrogenation to propene. DFT calculations suggest that the model with two anion vacancies containing two Zrcus or one Zrcus and one Cr4c sites predicts the enhancing effect of Cr promoter on activity. The proposed active sites are two Zrcus or one Zrcus and one Cr4c located at an anion vacancy.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>  
3. 是的,文章为所研究的CrZrOx催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢的机理方案。根据引文,文中总结出两个相邻的Zrcus位点主要负责将丙烷脱氢为丙烯。DFT计算表明,含有两个Zrcus位点或者一个Zrcus位点和一个Cr4c位点的双空位模型可以预测Cr助剂对活性的增强效应。提出的活性位点为位于阴离子空位上的两个Zrcus位点或一个Zrcus位点和一个Cr4c位点。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "The presented work provides fundamentals for controlling activity of catalysts with supported mixed CrZrOx species in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Owing to the different abilities of CrOx and ZrO2 to interact with the support and with each other, a synergy effect between these two types of catalytically active species can be achieved in terms of the propene formation rate especially when the interaction with the support is weak as in the case of silica."

[2] "On the basis of DFT calculations, this effect was explained by a positive influence of the Cr3+ promoter in the lattice of ZrO2 on the intrinsic activity of two Zrcus sites, which form the active site for propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "The strength of this effect depends, however, on the kind of support. The highest amount of H2 was consumed by Cr10Zr90/12SiTiO2, while Cr10Zr90/Silicagel released the lowest amount of lattice oxygen."

[4] "The support effect on the strength of the synergy effect between CrOx and Zrcus sites might be due to the different strengths of interaction between different supports and CrOx and/or ZrO2."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
4. Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in the CrZrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. According to the quotes, it reveals that the synergy between CrOx and ZrO2 for propene formation rate depends on the interaction with the support, with weak interaction in the case of silica being preferable. DFT calculations suggest this effect is due to the positive influence of Cr3+ promoter on the intrinsic activity of Zrcus sites. The strength of the effect also depends on the support, with CrZrOx/12SiTiO2 showing the highest reducibility. The article proposes that different strengths of interaction between supports and CrOx/ZrO2 affect the synergy effect.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
4. 是的,文章探究了CrZrOx催化剂中金属与载体界面的效应对丙烷脱氢的影响。根据引文,文章揭示CrOx和ZrO2之间对丙烯生成速率的协同作用取决于与载体的相互作用,其中与二氧化硅的弱相互作用更佳。DFT计算表明,这种效应归因于Cr3+助剂对Zrcus位点固有活性的正向影响。这种效应的强度还取决于载体,CrZrOx/12SiTiO2表现出最高的可还原性。文章认为不同载体与CrOx/ZrO2的不同相互作用强度影响了协同效应。

[1] "Owing to the different abilities of CrOx and ZrO2 to interact with the support and with each other, a synergy effect between these two types of catalytically active species can be achieved in terms of the propene formation rate especially when the interaction with the support is weak as in the case of silica."

[2] "The strength of this effect depends on the kind of support. The highest amount of H2 was consumed by Cr10Zr90/12SiTiO2, while Cr10Zr90/Silicagel released the lowest amount of lattice oxygen." 

[3] "Our DFT calculations further support the positive effect of chromium promoter on reducibility of ZrO2."

[4] "Thus, we can safely conclude that incorporating Cr3+ into the lattice of ZrO2 can facilitate oxygen vacancy formation."
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that the synergy effect between CrOx and ZrO2 for propene formation rate depends on the interaction strength with the support, with weaker interaction leading to higher synergy. It also shows that Cr3+ promoter improves the reducibility and oxygen vacancy formation in ZrO2, facilitating propane dehydrogenation.

[1] "Two neighboring Zrcus (cus = coordinatively unsaturated) sites were concluded to be mainly responsible for propane dehydrogenation to propene."

[2] "Our DFT calculations predict that two Zrcus form the active site on the surface of Cr-containing and Cr-free ZrO2." 

[3] "In Cr presence, the kinds of rate-limiting step and energies of individual pathways, however, change in such a way that the PDH reaction becomes more energetically favorable."

[4] "Thus, our further discussion is based on this model."

3. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. It describes that two neighboring Zrcus sites are responsible for breaking the C-H bond in propane. DFT calculations also predict two Zrcus as the active site on Cr-ZrOx and bare ZrO2 surfaces. The presence of Cr3+ changes the energetics of the reaction steps, making propane dehydrogenation more favorable.

[1] "The support effect on the strength of the synergy effect between CrOx and Zrcus sites might be due to the different strengths of interaction between different supports and CrOx and/or ZrO2." 

[2] "The positive effect of crystallite size could lead to an increase in catalyst reducibility (Table 1 and Figure S3). The catalysts with smaller crystallites were reduced deeper in H2 flow."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
4. Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows the synergy effect strength depends on the interaction strength between the support and CrOx/ZrO2.

[1] "Two neighboring Zrcus (cus = coordinatively unsaturated) sites were concluded to be mainly responsible for propane dehydrogenation to propene."

[2] "They are formed upon reductive catalyst treatment, and their concentration depends on the strength of interaction among CrOx, ZrO2, and support and on the size of ZrO2 crystallites in CrZrOx."

[3] "The lower-temperature consumption increases with chromium content, it should be related to the reduction of CrOx." 

[4] "The higher-temperature H2 consumption in the H2-TPR profiles in Figure 3b can be attributed to hydrogen reaction with surface lattice oxygen of ZrO2."

[5] "On a molecular level, methylene CH bond activation on 2Ov-CrZrOx(101) requires higher (0.99 vs 0.61 eV) energy than on 1Ov-t-ZrO2(101), while the activation of the methyl CH bond in Zr6cI-iso-C3H7 occurs easier (0.86 vs 0.92 eV) on 2Ov-CrZrOx(101)."

<English version answer>
3. The article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the studied CrZrOx metal oxide catalysts. It suggests that two neighboring coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus) sites are mainly responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. These Zrcus sites are formed upon reductive treatment of the catalyst, and their concentration depends on factors like the CrOx-ZrO2 interaction strength and ZrO2 crystallite size. DFT calculations reveal that the presence of Cr helps reduce the energy barrier for breaking the methyl C-H bond in an adsorbed iso-C3H7 intermediate compared to bare ZrO2, making propene formation easier.

3. 该文献提出了研究的CrZrOx金属氧化物催化剂催化丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的机理方案。它认为两个相邻的无配位饱和锆位点(Zrcus)主要负责催化丙烷向丙烯的脱氢反应。这些Zrcus位点是在催化剂还原处理过程中形成的,其浓度取决于诸如CrOx-ZrO2相互作用强度和ZrO2晶粒尺寸等因素。DFT计算揭示,与裸ZrO2相比,Cr的存在有助于降低吸附的异丙基中间体上甲基C-H键断裂的能垒,使丙烯的生成更容易。
