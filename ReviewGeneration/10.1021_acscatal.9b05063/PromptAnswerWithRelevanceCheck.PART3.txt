[1] Deposition of CrZrOx on supports was carried out according to the following protocol. Required amounts of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O were dissolved in ethanol to achieve 0.5 M of Cr3+ and ZrO2+ in total. Then, support (2 g) was added to a certain amount of such solution to achieve 30 wt % loading of CrZrOx. The resulting mixture was heated to 65 C, stirred until it became a slurry, dried at room temperature overnight, and finally calcined at 550 C (heating rate was 3 K min1) for 4 h.

[1] Operando UVvis tests were carried out in an in-house-developed setup using an Avantes spectrometer equipped with a temperature-resistant UVvis probe, a deuterium-halogen light source, and a CCD array detector.

[2] In situ EPR experiments were performed with 50 mg (particles of 250350 μm size) of Cr3Zr97/SiO2 in an in-house-developed fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor connected to a gas-dosing system with mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Omnistar, Pfeiffer Vacuum GmbH) for online product analysis. The catalyst was first pretreated at 300 C in a flow (30 mL min1) of 5 vol % O2 in He for 1 h, flushed with Ar flow (30 mL min1) for 30 min, and then exposed to a flow (30 mL min1) of 5 vol % CO in He for 45 min. The spectra were recorded with time under different gas atmospheres.

[3] IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded in the transmission mode on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer equipped with an in-house-developed reactor cell with CaF2 windows. The cell is connected to a gas-dosing and evacuation system. ZrO2/SiO2, Cr3Zr97/SiO2, Cr7Zr93/SiO2, and Cr30Zr70/SiO2 were used for such tests. 

[4] Transient tests were performed in the temporal analysis of product (TAP-2) reactor, a time-resolved technique with a resolution of approximately 100 μs. The TAP reactor system has been described in detail elsewhere. The catalyst Cr20Zr80/SiO2 (35 mg; sieve fraction of 315710 μm) was packed between two layers of quartz of the same particle size 250355 μm within the isothermal zone of a quartz-tube microreactor.

Then, support (2 g) was added to a certain amount of such solution to achieve 30 wt % loading of CrZrOx."

[2] "The obtained H2-TPR profiles are shown in Figure 3a. The reduction occurs in a broad temperature range. Depending on the catalyst, there are one or several maxima (Tmax) of H2 consumption. The Tmax values are given in Table 1. These values for the catalysts possessing either CrOx or ZrO2 are 464 or 609 °C (Figure 3b)."

[3] "There is no doubt that CrOx releases its lattice oxygen easier than ZrO2. Importantly, when CrOx and ZrO2 were present in the form of CrZrOx on the surface of SiO2, the amount of H2 consumed was higher than the sum of the corresponding values determined for ZrO2/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2, i.e., 366.2 vs 229.4 μmol H2 g−1."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes deposition of CrZrOx on different supports to achieve high dispersion, as seen in quote 1. H2-TPR data in quotes 2-3 also show that CrOx and ZrO2 interaction is tuned to enhance reducibility and oxygen removal when deposited as CrZrOx mixed oxides versus alone.

答:是的,这篇文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它描述了在不同的支持体上沉积CrZrOx以实现高度分散,正如引用1所示。引用2-3中的H2-TPR数据也表明,与单独沉积相比,沉积为CrZrOx混合氧化物时,调谐了CrOx和ZrO2的相互作用以增强可还原性和氧去除。
