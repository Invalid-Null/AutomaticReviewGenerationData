I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Reaction Pathways and Rate-Determining Steps in Reactions of Alkanes on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 Catalysts
Abstract
Reactions of ethane and propane on H-ZSM5 lead primarily to undesired products of β-scission reactions. Turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during alkane conversion increase as the density of exchanged Zn cations increases in H-ZSM5. Zn cations decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles, leading to higher rates and selectivity for the synthesis of C6-C8aromatic products. Reactions of propene/2-13C propane mixtures show that initial dehydrogenation steps become increasingly irreversible as Zn cations catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms and H2. This process depletes the surface hydrogen pool available for the reverse hydrogenation reactions and it increases the overall rate of propene conversion to aromatics. Zn cations promote not only alkane dehydrogenation, but also the subsequent removal of hydrogen as H2, leading to unsaturated intermediates required in cyclization steps. C3H8/C3D8isotopic exchange rates are much higher than propane conversion rates. Exchange rates are similar on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5, but negligible on Na-ZSM5, consistent with the involvement of Bronsted acid sites in isotopic scrambling within alkanes and with a predominant role of Zn in the recombinative desorption of H-atoms. This proposal is consistent with the effects of Zn cations on the rate of H2/D2isotopic equilibration, with the role of added H2on alkane reaction rates, and with the rate of incorporation of D-atoms into reaction products formed from C3H8/D2mixtures.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
