1. Answer: The article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports.

2. Answer: The article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability.

3. Answer: The article does investigate catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses the use of solid-state ion exchange of ZnCl2 to prepare Zn/H-MFI catalysts with varying Zn loadings. 

4. Answer: The article does utilize in-situ FTIR and XAS characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. FTIR is used to monitor changes in OH groups during treatment in H2. XAS provides insights into the coordination environment of Zn species during propane dehydrogenation.

5. Answer: The article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

6. Answer: The article does use XAS to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. XAS reveals that Zn remains predominantly Zn2+ during treatment in H2 and propane dehydrogenation.  

7. Answer: The article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.

8. Answer: The article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.

1. 答:文章没有描述在分子筛支撑体中合成隔离的单点位的技术。

2. 答:文章没有评估金属封装在分子筛支撑体中以提高丙烷脱氢催化剂稳定性。

3. 答:文章确实研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它讨论了使用ZnCl2的固态离子交换法制备不同Zn载量的Zn/H-MFI催化剂。

4. 答:文章确实利用了原位FTIR和XAS表征技术来研究工作中的丙烷脱氢催化剂。FTIR用于监测H2处理过程中的OH基团变化。XAS提供了Zn种类在丙烷脱氢过程中的配位环境信息。

5. 答:文章没有采用先进的显微技术来表征丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-支撑体界面。

6. 答:文章确实使用XAS来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。XAS揭示Zn在H2处理和丙烷脱氢过程中主要保持Zn2+态。

7. 答:文章没有评估不同的反应器类型用于丙烷脱氢。 

8. 答:文章没有评估不同的反应器类型用于丙烷脱氢。
