I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

Abstract
Irreversible deactivation of chromia/alumina dehydrogenation catalysts was investigated by deactivating the catalysts (4 wt% Cr) through prolonged calcination in air at temperatures up to 1200C. Nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the UVvisible region, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, and catalytic measurements revealed that two deactivation mechanisms were responsible for the formation of catalytically inactive alumina-incorporated Cr3+ species: (i) entrapment of Cr3+ ions inside the alumina support during sintering of the alumina support and (ii) migration of Cr3+ ions into the alumina support. Chromia that had been impregnated on alumina inhibited the phase transformation from γ- to α-alumina. The presence of γ-alumina, in turn, hindered the migration of Cr3+ ions into alumina. The turnover frequency was higher for multinuclear Cr3+ than for isolated Cr3+ sites. The phase of the alumina support did not appear to affect the activity of the surface Cr3+ species.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
