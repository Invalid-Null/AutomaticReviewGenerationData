[4] "Furthermore, C3H6 adsorption FT-IR measurements were given in Fig. 5e, f. Three peaks located at 1626cm−1, 1875cm−1 and 2004cm−1 were also found on the Dir-reduction catalyst (Fig. 5e), which was attributed to the characteristic adsorption bands of C3H6."

[1] "EXAFS measurements were implemented. The XANES spectrum of the Dir-reduction catalyst (red line) from Fig. 1e showed an absorption edge located between Co foil and CoO (closer to CoO). Therefore, combining the EXAFS and XPS data, we inferred that the valence state of cobalt in the Dir-reduction catalyst was around +2."

[2] "Besides, the results of EXAFS fitting and corresponding Fourier transform were summarized in Fig. 1f, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 1. The EXAFS spectra recorded Co-O and Co-Co shells with a distance of 2.07Å and 3.12Å, respectively. The corresponding coordination number (CN) were 4.0 and 4.8, which was lower than the average number of the CoO phase, indicating that the tetracoordinated Co(II) species dominated over the Dir-reduction catalyst."
