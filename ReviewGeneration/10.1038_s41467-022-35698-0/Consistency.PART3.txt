 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative answer files, here is the compiled analysis of consistency between the answers:

```json
{

  "2": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%"}, 
  "5": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I carefully compared each answer file's responses against the provided correct answers for each question. I calculated the consistency ratio by assessing how relevant and aligned each response was with the correct answer.Scores of 100% indicate completely consistent responses, while 0% indicates completely inconsistent or unrelated responses. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
