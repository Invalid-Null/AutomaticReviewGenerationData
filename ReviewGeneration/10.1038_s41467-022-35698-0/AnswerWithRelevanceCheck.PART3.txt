         [1] "Herein, we described the role of adsorbed water during the synthesis of highly dispersed Td-cobalt(II) sites onto the silica support." 
         [2] "The results showed that the hydrates were critical to the tetrahedral Co site formation."
         [3] "It was proposed that under a simple direct reduction process, the adsorbed water could help to immobilize the Co precursor, and then further form Td-Co(II) sites."

         [1] "In-situ FT-IR was developed to further investigate the difference in the activation of propane and the desorption of propene between Dir-reduction and H2-reduction catalysts."
         [2] "In the C3H8 adsorption FT-IR spectra (Figs. 5c, 4d), the bands at 2967cm−1, 1460cm−1 and 1370cm−1 assigned to C3H8 were detected."
         [3] "It is seen from Fig. 5c that new bands at 1626cm−1, 1875cm−1, and 2004cm−1 representing for the formation of C3H6 were emerged when the Dir-reduction catalyst was heated to 300C, suggesting C3H8 was participated in the reaction to produce C3H6 over the catalyst, while no new peak was detected on the H2-reduction catalyst, which illustrated the better C3H8 activation reactivity over the Dir-reduction sample."
         [4] "Furthermore, C3H6 adsorption FT-IR measurements were given in Fig. 5e, f. Three peaks located at 1626cm−1, 1875cm−1 and 2004cm−1 were also found on the Dir-reduction catalyst (Fig. 5e), which was attributed to the characteristic adsorption bands of C3H6."

         [1] "EXAFS measurements were implemented. The XANES spectrum of the Dir-reduction catalyst (red line) from Fig. 1e showed an absorption edge located between Co foil and CoO (closer to CoO). Therefore, combining the EXAFS and XPS data, we inferred that the valence state of cobalt in the Dir-reduction catalyst was around +2."
         [2] "Besides, the results of EXAFS fitting and corresponding Fourier transform were summarized in Fig. 1f, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 1. The EXAFS spectra recorded Co-O and Co-Co shells with a distance of 2.07Å and 3.12Å, respectively. The corresponding coordination number (CN) were 4.0 and 4.8, which was lower than the average number of the CoO phase, indicating that the tetracoordinated Co(II) species dominated over the Dir-reduction catalyst."
