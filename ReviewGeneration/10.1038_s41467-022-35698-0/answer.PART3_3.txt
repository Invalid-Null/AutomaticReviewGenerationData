[1] "Illustrating new understanding of adsorbed water on silica for inducing tetrahedral cobalt(II) for propane dehydrogenation"

[2] "Highly dispersed metal sites on the surface of silica, achieved from immobilization of metal precursor within hydroxyl groups, has gained increasing attention in the field of heterogeneous catalyst."

[3] "It is indicated that sufficient adsorbed water induces the transformation of precursor of Co(NO3)2 into intermediate of [Co(H2O)6]2+." 

[4] "Subsequently, [Co(H2O)6]2+ makes the highly dispersed Td-cobalt(II) sites to be available during direct H2-reduction process."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It focuses on the role of adsorbed water in inducing the formation of highly dispersed tetrahedral Co(II) sites during direct H2 reduction. The quotes describe how adsorbed water helps transform the cobalt precursor into an intermediate that leads to dispersed Co(II) sites.

[1] "In-situ DRIFTS of NH3 adsorption-desorption and in-situ FT-IR were applied to reveal the changes of catalyst surface groups during H2-direct reduction process, so as to illustrate the role of [Co(H2O)6]2+ in the formation of Td-Co(II)."

[2] "In-situ FT-IR was developed to further investigate the difference in the activation of propane and the desorption of propene between Dir-reduction and H2-reduction catalysts."

[3] "Subsequently, in-situ FT-IR of propene hydrogenation process (the reverse of dehydrogenation) was performed in Supplementary Fig. 23."
