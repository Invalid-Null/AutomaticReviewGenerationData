[1] It is clarified that the presence of cationic cobalt bonded to the silica with Co-O-SiOn linkages at the Co-SiO2 interfaces stabilize the dispersed Co species.

[2] A systematic characterization and DFT calculation prove the existence of the adsorbed water and the importance of the intermediate of [Co(H2O)6]2+, respectively.

[3] The as-synthesized catalyst is attempted to the propane dehydrogenation, which shows better reactivity when compared with other reported Co based catalysts.

Answer: The article does investigate how properties like cobalt oxidation state, cobalt-support interactions, and cobalt precursor affect the performance of the supported cobalt catalyst. It reveals that cationic Co(II) species bonded to silica support via Co-O-Si linkages help stabilize dispersed cobalt sites. Adsorbed water helps form [Co(H2O)6]2+ intermediate from cobalt precursor, which is important for forming tetrahedral Co(II) sites. The synthesized tetrahedral Co(II) catalyst shows superior propane dehydrogenation activity compared to other cobalt catalysts.

[1] A high C3H8 conversion (37%) and C3H6 selectivity (96%) were achieved over the Dir-reduction catalyst. In contrast, the conversion and selectivity over the H2-reduction catalyst were 15 and 92%, respectively. 

[2] It is known that the structure of Co3O4 and metallic Co were most likely led to the cracking of C-C bonds, causing the formation of CH4 and some coke precursors34,55, while highly dispersed Td-Co(II) were supposed to be efficient in C-H activation for hydrocarbons52. This clearly explained why the Dir-reduction catalyst performed better catalytic reactivity for the PDH.

[3] Following, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to illustrate the mechanism of the PDH reactivity on the Dir-reduction and H2-reduction catalysts, and the geometries of the transition state (TS) were exhibited in Supplementary Fig. 24 and Supplementary Fig. 25. It is obtained from Fig. 5g that energy barriers for the activation of first and second C-H bonds on the Dir-reduction catalyst were 0.40eV and 0.33eV, respectively, while H2-reduction catalyst possessed higher energy barrier of 0.52eV and 1.02eV for the reaction.

Answer: The article does propose a mechanistic reaction pathway for propane dehydrogenation over the synthesized tetrahedral cobalt catalyst compared to metallic cobalt catalyst. It shows the tetrahedral Co(II) catalyst can activate C-H bonds in propane with lower energy barriers of 0.40eV and 0.33eV for 1st and 2nd C-H bonds respectively. This gives higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to metallic cobalt which causes C-C cracking. DFT calculations confirm the lower activation barriers on tetrahedral Co(II).

答:该文确实为合成的四面体钴催化剂相比金属钴催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢的机理反应途径。它显示四面体Co(II)催化剂可以以更低的能垒(第一个和第二个C-H键能垒分别为0.40eV和0.33eV)激活丙烷中的C-H键。这使其相比金属钴导致C-C裂化具有更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。 DFT计算证实了四面体Co(II)上的更低激活能垒。
