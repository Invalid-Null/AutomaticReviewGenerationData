To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key semantic elements between each answer file and the correct answers. I looked for overlaps in the core meaning and facts stated, rather than exact word-for-word matches. For questions with multiple sub-elements (e.g. supported characterization techniques), I accounted for partial matches in the consistency ratios.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
