[1] "We present both hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as metal-free materials able to catalyze the ODHP reaction." 

[2] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes BN materials from supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 1B)."

[3] "The analogous product distributions for both h-BN and BNNTs suggest a similar reaction mechanism for these BN materials."

[4] "It is surprising that BN, a material known for its high stability under oxidative conditions (23, 24), is catalytically active at all."

[5] "So far it has been explored for its unique electronic, thermoelectric, and mechanical properties (2528)."

[6] "We focused on a single BN sheet and calculated vibrational frequencies for a set of OH-terminated zigzag and armchair edges."

[7] "When comparing the modeled wavenumbers to the experimental measurements, we find that especially the armchair edge leads to features in the studied range, the feature around 3420 cm−1 corresponding to a single OH-stretch (displayed in movie S1) and the feature around 3250 cm−1 associated with a concerted stretching vibration (displayed in movie S2)." 

[8] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

[14] "To date, supported vanadium oxide catalysts show the most promising activity for ODHP, owing to the favorable redox properties of the active vanadium sites (6, 7)."

[15] "However, even after decades of research, propene selectivity remains too low, even at moderate propane conversion. As an example, at 10% propane conversion, the propene selectivity typically drops to less than 60% for such conventional catalysts." 

[16] "The lack of kinetic control identifies the need for the discovery of alternative materials with the ability to better control this partial oxidation (8)."
