Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question’s section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

 <quotes>

[1] "We present both hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as metal-free materials able to catalyze the ODHP reaction." 

[2] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes BN materials from supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 1B)."

[3] "The analogous product distributions for both h-BN and BNNTs suggest a similar reaction mechanism for these BN materials."

[4] "It is surprising that BN, a material known for its high stability under oxidative conditions (23, 24), is catalytically active at all."

[5] "So far it has been explored for its unique electronic, thermoelectric, and mechanical properties (2528)."

[6] "We focused on a single BN sheet and calculated vibrational frequencies for a set of OH-terminated zigzag and armchair edges."

[7] "When comparing the modeled wavenumbers to the experimental measurements, we find that especially the armchair edge leads to features in the studied range, the feature around 3420 cm−1 corresponding to a single OH-stretch (displayed in movie S1) and the feature around 3250 cm−1 associated with a concerted stretching vibration (displayed in movie S2)." 

[8] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

[12] No relevant quotes.

[13] No relevant quotes.

[14] "To date, supported vanadium oxide catalysts show the most promising activity for ODHP, owing to the favorable redox properties of the active vanadium sites (6, 7)."

[15] "However, even after decades of research, propene selectivity remains too low, even at moderate propane conversion. As an example, at 10% propane conversion, the propene selectivity typically drops to less than 60% for such conventional catalysts." 

[16] "The lack of kinetic control identifies the need for the discovery of alternative materials with the ability to better control this partial oxidation (8)."
