 Here is the JSON structure comparing the consistency of the answers in each file with the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", 
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", 
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "3": {
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"  
  },
  "4": {
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "90%", 
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "80%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "80%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "70%"
  },
  "5": {
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "6": {
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "80%",
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "90%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "90%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "70%"
  },
  "7": {
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"
  }
}
```

I carefully compared each answer file against the correct answers, looking at the key points made and semantics. I calculated consistency ratios by estimating the % overlap between each answer and the correct one. The JSON shows consistency ranging from 100% (complete match) to 70% (partial match). Let me know if you need any clarification on the analysis!
