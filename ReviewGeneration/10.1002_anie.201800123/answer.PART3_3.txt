[1] "Therefore, the IR bands at 3750 and 3715cm1 are attributed to hydroxyl groups connected to the support (AlOH), and the IR band at 3660cm1 is consequently attributed to the hydroxyl groups linked to the VOx species (VOH)."

[2] "As shown in Figure3A presents the DRIFTS profiles of a series of 6V samples after a 30minute reaction at 600C, among which the samples are pretreated with H2 for different periods of time (3120min)." 

[3] "Clearly, the coke deposits more slowly on those catalysts covered with hydroxyl groups, and this is the reason why the catalysts with sufficient H2 pretreatment possess higher stability."

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ DRIFTS characterization to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows that surface hydroxyl groups on the VOx species can be detected by DRIFTS bands during H2 pretreatment. DRIFTS also reveals that catalysts with more hydroxyl groups have slower coke deposition during propane dehydrogenation reaction, indicating higher stability.

4. 是的,文章利用原位 DRIFTS 表征技术来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它显示 VOx 物种上的表面羟基团可以通过 DRIFTS 带在 H2 预处理期间被检测到。DRIFTS 也显示具有更多羟基团的催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应期间焦炭沉积更慢,这表明它们具有更高的稳定性。

[1] "Bader charge analysis indicates the V oxidation state follows the trend V2O5>V2O5H2>V2O3, and is consistent with the valence-state distribution of vanadium by XPS."

[2] "As shown in the XPS profile (see FigureS15), the vanadium is a mixture of V5+, V4+, and V3+ after reduction and the fraction of each oxidation state calculated by peak deconvolution are listed in TableS2."

</quotes>

<English version answer>  

6. Yes, the article uses XPS to probe vanadium oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation. It shows that vanadium oxidation state decreases from V5+ to a mixture of V5+, V4+, V3+ after H2 reduction, consistent with DFT calculations. 

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

6. 是的,文章使用 XPS 探测了丙烷脱氢过程中的钒氧化态变化。它显示钒的氧化态在 H2 还原后从 V5+ 降低到 V5+、V4+、V3+ 的混合物,与 DFT 计算结果一致。
