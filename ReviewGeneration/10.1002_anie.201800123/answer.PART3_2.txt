[1] The evolution process of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst under an H2 atmosphere was studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS).

[2] Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) experiments were conducted to compare the intrinsic activity between the 6V catalysts with and without hydroxyl groups.

[3] Additional DRIFTS experiments have been conducted to tackle the surface structure of fresh 6V catalysts, that is, without the existence of surface VOH groups, under the reaction conditions.

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ DRIFTS and TPSR to study propane dehydrogenation over VOx/Al2O3 catalysts with and without surface hydroxyl groups. The in-situ DRIFTS experiments track the evolution of surface species during H2 reduction and reaction. The TPSR experiments compare intrinsic catalyst activity with and without hydroxyl groups. Additional in-situ DRIFTS reveals surface structural changes when fresh catalysts are exposed to propane.

[1] X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the surface structure of the fresh and H2-reduced 6V samples.

[2] XPS profile (see FigureS15), the vanadium is a mixture of V5+, V4+, and V3+ after reduction and the fraction of each oxidation state calculated by peak deconvolution are listed in TableS2.

<English version answer> 
6. Yes, the article uses XRD and XPS to probe changes in vanadium oxidation state during reduction and reaction. XRD shows no bulk V2O5 phases. XPS reveals a mixture of V5+, V4+, and V3+ species, with relative ratios changing with pretreatment conditions.
</English version answer>
