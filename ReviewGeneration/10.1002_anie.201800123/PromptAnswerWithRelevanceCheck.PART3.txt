[1] "Therefore, the IR bands at 3750 and 3715cm1 are attributed to hydroxyl groups connected to the support (AlOH), and the IR band at 3660cm1 is consequently attributed to the hydroxyl groups linked to the VOx species (VOH)."

[2] "As shown in Figure3A presents the DRIFTS profiles of a series of 6V samples after a 30minute reaction at 600C, among which the samples are pretreated with H2 for different periods of time (3120min)." 

[3] "Clearly, the coke deposits more slowly on those catalysts covered with hydroxyl groups, and this is the reason why the catalysts with sufficient H2 pretreatment possess higher stability."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ DRIFTS characterization to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows that surface hydroxyl groups on the VOx species can be detected by DRIFTS bands during H2 pretreatment. DRIFTS also reveals that catalysts with more hydroxyl groups have slower coke deposition during propane dehydrogenation reaction, indicating higher stability.
