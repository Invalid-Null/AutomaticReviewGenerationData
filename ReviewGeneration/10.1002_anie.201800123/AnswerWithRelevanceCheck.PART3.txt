         [1] "The evolution process of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst under an H2 atmosphere was studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)." 
         [2] "Additional DRIFTS experiments have been conducted to tackle the surface structure of fresh 6V catalysts, that is, without the existence of surface VOH groups, under the reaction conditions."
         [3] "To further understand the relationship between the surface structure and catalytic performance, DFT calculations were performed."
