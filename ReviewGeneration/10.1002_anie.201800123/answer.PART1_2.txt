<quotes>
[1] The hydroxyl groups are found to improve the catalyst that leads to better stability by suppressing the coke deposition.

[2] DFT calculations are applied to simulate the PDH process on different reduced VOx structures, and the results coincide well with experiments. 

[3] The hydroxyl groups have been proved to have a fundamental effect on the catalytic performance of the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for PDH reaction.

[4] By combined experimental and calculational studies, we demonstrate that the hydroxyl groups on the supported VOx catalysts are strongly connected with the intrinsic activity for PDH reaction and coke formation.

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. It shows that the presence of surface hydroxyl groups on the VOx species affects the catalytic performance. Experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that hydroxyl groups suppress coke formation but also lower intrinsic activity. The hydroxyl groups are proposed to modulate the oxidation state and reactive properties of exposed vanadium sites.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文针对所研究的VOx/Al2O3催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢的机理场景。它显示VOx物种表面的羟基存在会影响催化性能。实验和DFT计算证明了羟基可以抑制焦炭生成但也会降低固有活性。该文认为羟基可以调节钒的氧化态和表面钒位点的反应性。
