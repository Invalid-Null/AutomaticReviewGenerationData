[1] "The evolution process of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst under an H2 atmosphere was studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)."

[2] "Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) experiments were conducted to compare the intrinsic activity between the 6V catalysts with and without hydroxyl groups (see FigureS9)."

[1] "X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the surface structure of the fresh and H2-reduced 6V samples."

[2] "FigureS4 presents the UV (325nm) Raman spectra of the fresh and H2-reduced 6V sample." 

[3] "Moreover, for the visible Raman spectra (see FiguresS5 and S6), no band corresponding to V2O5 nanoparticles is observed, thus indicating that the catalysts are mainly covered by two-dimensional VOx species (monovanadates and polyvanadates)."
