<quotes>

[1] "The evolution process of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst under an H2 atmosphere was studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)."

[2] "Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) experiments were conducted to compare the intrinsic activity between the 6V catalysts with and without hydroxyl groups (see FigureS9)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ DRIFTS and TPSR to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. These techniques revealed the formation of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface under H2 pretreatment, and showed that catalysts with surface hydroxyls have lower intrinsic activity for propane dehydrogenation.
