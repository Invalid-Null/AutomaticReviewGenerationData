 Unfortunately, this article does not discuss process intensification approaches, techno-economic factors, safety issues, remaining challenges and knowledge gaps, high-throughput computational methods, improved characterization tools, or potentially transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation. 

The article focuses solely on using density functional theory calculations and Bayesian statistics to compare different platinum surface models as active sites for the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction. No other aspects of propane dehydrogenation technology or processes are discussed.
