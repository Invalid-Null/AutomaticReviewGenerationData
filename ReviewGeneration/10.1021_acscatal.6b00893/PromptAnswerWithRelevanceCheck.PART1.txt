<quotes>

[1] "we propose that the VOx species (V5+, V4+, and V3+ ions) on the catalysts exhibit different activity for propane dehydrogenation, and the V3+ ions are more active than V5+ and V4+ ions."

[2] "Propane activation over the catalyst surface involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom, and then the formed vanadium propyl was rapidly transformed to propenyl-vanadium because of instability, as observed by an IR spectroscopic technique. At elevated temperatures, propylene formed from propenyl-vanadium or propyl-vanadium and then desorbed from the catalyst surface, and coke deposition occurred at the same time, leading to catalyst deactivation."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the studied VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. It suggests V3+ ions are the most active sites. Propane activation involves hydrogen abstraction to form vanadium propyl, which rapidly transforms to propenyl-vanadium. Propylene then forms and desorbs, along with coke deposition.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

3. 是的,文章为在所研究的VOx/Al2O3催化剂上丙烷脱氢提出了一个机理场景。它表明V3+离子是最活跃的位点。丙烷活化涉及氢的抽取以形成钒丙基,后者迅速转化为丙烯基钒。此后,丙烯生成并脱附,同时也发生焦炭沉积。

10. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic reaction pathway for propane dehydrogenation over VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. It suggests propane first undergoes hydrogen abstraction to form vanadium propyl species, which rapidly converts to propenyl-vanadium.

<quotes>
[1] "We examined active species by attaining various fractions of V5+, V4+, and V3+ ions by adjusting the surface vanadium density on an alumina support. The results reveal a close relationship between TOF and the fraction of V3+ ion, indicating that V3+ was more active for PDH."

[2] "In situ DRIFTS was employed for the investigation of the reaction mechanism. Same intermediates were detected during both propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation, indicating that they share a reverse reaction mechanism. In combination with previous studies, a new intermediate, i.e., propenyl-vanadium (VC3H5), was proposed, instead of carbonyl compound or carbonaceous species."

[3] "Propane activation over the catalyst surface involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom, and then the formed vanadium propyl was rapidly transformed to propenyl-vanadium because of instability, as observed by an IR spectroscopic technique."

<English version answer>
3. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. It reveals that V3+ ions are the most active sites. The proposed key steps involve abstraction of a hydrogen atom from propane to form vanadium propyl, which rapidly transforms to an unstable propenyl-vanadium intermediate containing a C=C bond, as detected by in situ DRIFTS.
