[1] Propylene serves as a key basic feedstock for the manufacture of various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile.

[2] Supported VOx catalysts are promising for use in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) because of the relatively superior activity and stable performance upon regeneration. 

[3] The public literature includes numerous studies of vanadium-based catalysts, although most of them focused on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, or butane. 

[4] However, a low olefin yield is the major issue during the oxidative dehydrogenation process because alkene can be easily overoxidized to COx.

[5] Meanwhile, the operating safety and catalyst lifetime are also concerned. 

[6] High olefin selectivity can be achieved via an economical direct dehydrogenation process, and vanadium oxides can be used as the catalyst.

[7] In particular, vanadium oxides supported on Al2O3 exhibited superior performance in terms of nonoxidative butane dehydrogenation.

[8] Additionally, Sokolov et al. compared the catalytic performance of PDH over the VOx, CrOx, and PtSn catalysts and concluded that VOx-based catalysts had superior propylene selectivity and stability after several regeneration cycles.

1. The article explains that propylene is a key chemical feedstock with major applications in polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile production. It provides background that VOx catalysts have shown promising performance for propane dehydrogenation to propylene, in terms of high selectivity and stability compared to CrOx and PtSn catalysts. Prior studies of VOx have focused more on oxidative dehydrogenation, which has issues with over-oxidation, while direct dehydrogenation with VOx/Al2O3 gives superior selectivity.

1. 文章解释了丙烯是一种关键的化学原料,在聚丙烯、丙烯醇、丙烯腈的生产中有重要应用。它提供了背景资料,说明VOx催化剂在从丙烷脱氢制备丙烯方面表现出很有前景的性能,在选择性和稳定性方面比较CrOx和PtSn催化剂更优异。以前关于VOx的研究更多集中在氧化脱氢上,存在过氧化的问题,而直接脱氢在VOx/Al2O3上获得更高的选择性。
