[1] "We examined active species by attaining various fractions of V5+, V4+, and V3+ ions by adjusting the surface vanadium density on an alumina support. The results reveal a close relationship between TOF and the fraction of V3+ ion, indicating that V3+ was more active for PDH."

[2] "In situ DRIFTS was employed for the investigation of the reaction mechanism. Same intermediates were detected during both propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation, indicating that they share a reverse reaction mechanism. In combination with previous studies, a new intermediate, i.e., propenyl-vanadium (VC3H5), was proposed, instead of carbonyl compound or carbonaceous species."

[3] "Propane activation over the catalyst surface involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom, and then the formed vanadium propyl was rapidly transformed to propenyl-vanadium because of instability, as observed by an IR spectroscopic technique."

3. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. It reveals that V3+ ions are the most active sites. The proposed key steps involve abstraction of a hydrogen atom from propane to form vanadium propyl, which rapidly transforms to an unstable propenyl-vanadium intermediate containing a C=C bond, as detected by in situ DRIFTS.
