1. Main
One frontier in the synthesis of zeolites, and microporous materials more generally, consists in locating active sites in the desired framework or extraframework position1,2,3,4. For instance, in the case of zeolites containing pores and/or cavities of different dimensions, it is clear that locating the active sites selectively in one specific type of pore or cavity is a fundamental challenge with important implications for their catalytic application, due to differences in geometric and confinement effects. 

2. Considerations from the materials and catalysis point of view: (1) to generate stable subnanometric metal species within the zeolite crystallites, (2) to stabilize them regioselectively within the 10MR channels and (3) to achieve the above goals with purely siliceous MFI zeolite and to avoid the presence of acid sites in the final material.

3. The characteristics of the location of Pt atoms described above are the same when the synthesis is carried out in the presence of K+

5. The precise location of subnanometric Pt clusters can be reliably identified by correlating the paired images. The results demonstrate that Pt clusters of 0.4–0.6 nm are preferentially located in the sinusoidal channels.

1. The article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It focuses on synthesizing subnanometric metal clusters rather than isolated single metal sites.

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It shows that encapsulating subnanometric PtSn clusters in the 10MR channels of siliceous MFI zeolite results in a highly stable and selective catalyst compared to Pt or PtSn nanoparticles in MFI. 

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It utilizes potassium promotion during hydrothermal synthesis to stabilize subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters and prevent sintering into larger nanoparticles.

4. No, the article does not utilize any in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. 

5. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses a combination of HAADF-STEM and iDPC imaging to identify the precise location of subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters within the MFI zeolite structure.

6. No, the article does not use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis.

7. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.

8. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.
