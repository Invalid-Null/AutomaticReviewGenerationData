[1] Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species. As shown in Fig. 1c,d, Pt mainly exists as nanoparticles of ~3-5 nm in the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 2), while subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.4-0.7 nm are the dominant species in the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 3).

[2] According to the XANES results (Fig. 2a), Pt species also exist in the metallic state in the PtSn@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI samples. As shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1, the K-free PtSn@MFI has a first-shell NPt-Pt of about 10.7, corresponding to Pt nanoparticles of ~4-5 nm, while a first-shell NPt-Pt of about 6.4 is found for the K-PtSn@MFI sample, corresponding to an average size of about 0.9 nm. These results further confirm the critical role of K+ in stabilizing subnanometric Pt species18,19,20.

[3] Interestingly, as demonstrated in Supplementary Figs. 52–54, the reactivity of the deactivated K-Pt@MFI catalyst can be fully recovered by at least three cycles of calcination-reduction treatment, and the subnanometric Pt clusters remain stable during these processes.

[4] Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5d, the K-PtSn@MFI sample shows high reactivity under the same reaction conditions as used before. More importantly, the selectivity to propylene at the initial stage is already quite high (90%) and the lifetime of the catalyst is significantly extended. It should be noted that the K-Sn@MFI sample without Pt is not active for this reaction, indicating that Sn only modulates the reactivity of Pt. The high catalytic performance of K-PtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reaction-regeneration cycles without obvious deactivation (see Supplementary Figs. 55 and 56).

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that adding Sn helps stabilize subnanometric Pt clusters of 0.4-0.7 nm size compared to pure Pt, which forms larger nanoparticles of 3-5 nm. The Pt-Sn catalyst maintains high selectivity to propylene (~90%) and catalytic performance over multiple reaction cycles, while pure Pt deactivates. This demonstrates Sn helps modulate and improve Pt catalyst performance.

Answer: 是的,这篇文章评估了Pt-Sn双金属催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它显示添加Sn有助于稳定亚纳米Pt簇,其大小为0.4-0.7 nm,而纯Pt会形成较大的纳米粒子,大小为3-5 nm。Pt-Sn催化剂在多个反应循环中保持了高的丙烯选择性(~90%)和催化性能,而纯Pt会发生失活。这表明Sn有助于调制和改善Pt催化剂的性能。

[1] To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials. The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+OH) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position. Considering the larger space in the sinusoidal channels versus the straight channels, Pt species may preferentially be located in the sinusoidal channels.
