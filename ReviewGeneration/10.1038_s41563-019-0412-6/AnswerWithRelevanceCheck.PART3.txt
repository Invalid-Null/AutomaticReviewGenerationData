         To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials. The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position. Considering the larger space in the sinusoidal channels versus the straight channels, Pt species may preferentially be located in the sinusoidal channels.

         The article describes using template molecules (TPA+) to occupy the intersectional voids in the zeolite, limiting Pt species access to that position. The larger sinusoidal channels are preferential for localizing the Pt species compared to the straight channels. The article focuses on synthesizing subnanometric Pt clusters rather than isolated single metal sites.

         Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species. As shown in Fig. 1c,d, Pt mainly exists as nanoparticles of ~3-5nm in the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 2), while subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.4-0.7nm are the dominant species in the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 3).

         A controllable amount of K+ is introduced to compensate the silanol groups, and to stabilize the subnanometric Pt species.

         The article investigates introducing potassium promotion during hydrothermal synthesis to control the size and stabilization of Pt species, forming subnanometric clusters rather than larger nanoparticles. This method is aimed at optimizing the dispersion of the active Pt phase.

         By using the newly developed iDPC technique, the atomic structure of the MFI zeolite can be recorded simultaneously with the HR HAADF-STEM image under low-dose conditions. As presented in Fig. 3d, the detailed structure of the MFI zeolite can be clearly identified in the iDPC image, even the 5R units in the framework. Since HR HAADF-STEM imaging is more sensitive to heavy elements (Pt in this work), and the structural information of the zeolite framework is finely captured by iDPC imaging, the precise location of subnanometric Pt clusters can be reliably identified by correlating the paired images. The results demonstrate that Pt clusters of 0.4–0.6 nm are preferentially located in the sinusoidal channels.
         
         We have achieved a very high preference for localization of highly stable subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite, as revealed by atomically resolved electron microscopy combining high-angle annular dark-field and integrated differential phase contrast imaging techniques.

         The article employs aberration corrected STEM paired with integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) imaging to characterize the metal-support interface. This advanced microscopy approach enables precise localization of subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters preferentially within the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite structure.

         X-ray absorption experiments at the Pt (11,564eV) LIII and Sn (29,200eV) K edges were performed in the ALBA synchrotron. As shown in Fig. 2c, the shape of the XANES spectra of the reduced K-PtSn@MFI does not resemble either Sn metal or SnO, suggesting a possible formation of SnOx species. This can also be supported by the reduction in the first-shell intensity of FT (Fig. 2d), indicating the loss of neighbouring oxygen.
