1. This article does not specifically discuss techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. No relevant quotes.

2. "Interestingly, as demonstrated in Supplementary Figs. 52‒54, the reactivity of the deactivated K-Pt@MFI catalyst can be fully recovered by at least three cycles of calcination‒reduction treatment, and the subnanometric Pt clusters remain stable during these processes."

"According to the above results, by the combination of K and Sn, the reactivity and stability of Pt should be enhanced. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5d, the K-PtSn@MFI sample shows high reactivity under the same reaction conditions as used before. More importantly, the selectivity to propylene at the initial stage is already quite high (90%) and the lifetime of the catalyst is significantly extended."

"The high catalytic performance of K-PtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reaction‒regeneration cycles without obvious deactivation (see Supplementary Figs. 55 and 56). The size and spatial location of the subnanometric Pt clusters are preserved after reaction, which is confirmed by EXAFS and electron microscopy characterizations (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Figs. 57‒61)."

3. "Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species. As shown in Fig. 1c,d, Pt mainly exists as nanoparticles of ~3‒5 nm in the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 2), while subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.4‒0.7 nm are the dominant species in the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 3)." 

"To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials. The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position. Considering the larger space in the sinusoidal channels versus the straight channels, Pt species may preferentially be located in the sinusoidal channels."

4. No relevant quotes. This article does not utilize any in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

5. "By using the newly developed iDPC technique, the atomic structure of the MFI zeolite can be recorded simultaneously with the HR HAADF-STEM image under low-dose conditions. As presented in Fig. 3d, the detailed structure of the MFI zeolite can be clearly identified in the iDPC image, even the 5R units in the framework. Since HR HAADF-STEM imaging is more sensitive to heavy elements (Pt in this work), and the structural information of the zeolite framework is finely captured by iDPC imaging, the precise location of subnanometric Pt clusters can be reliably identified by correlating the paired images."

6. No relevant quotes. This article does not use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis.

7. No relevant quotes. This article does not evaluate different reactor types like fixed beds, fluidized beds, or membrane reactors for propane dehydrogenation.
