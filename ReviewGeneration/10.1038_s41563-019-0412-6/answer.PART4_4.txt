 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that directly address any of the questions asked. The literature focuses on describing the synthesis and characterization of subnanometric platinum and platinum-tin clusters confined within pure-silica MFI zeolite, and evaluating their catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss process intensification approaches, techno-economic analysis, safety issues, remaining challenges, computational methods, in-situ characterization needs, or transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation specifically.
