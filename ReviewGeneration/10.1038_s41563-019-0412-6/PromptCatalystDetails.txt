Regioselective generation and reactivity control of subnanometric platinum clusters in zeolites for high-temperature catalysis

Abstract
Subnanometric metal species (single atoms and clusters) have been demonstrated to be unique compared with their nanoparticulate counterparts. However, the poor stabilization of subnanometric metal species towards sintering at high temperature (>500 °C) under oxidative or reductive reaction conditions limits their catalytic application. Zeolites can serve as an ideal support to stabilize subnanometric metal catalysts, but it is challenging to localize subnanometric metal species on specific sites and modulate their reactivity. We have achieved a very high preference for localization of highly stable subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite, as revealed by atomically resolved electron microscopy combining high-angle annular dark-field and integrated differential phase contrast imaging techniques. These catalysts show very high stability, selectivity and activity for the industrially important dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene. This stabilization strategy could be extended to other crystalline porous materials.

Main
One frontier in the synthesis of zeolites, and microporous materials more generally, consists in locating active sites in the desired framework or extraframework position1,2,3,4. For instance, in the case of zeolites containing pores and/or cavities of different dimensions, it is clear that locating the active sites selectively in one specific type of pore or cavity is a fundamental challenge with important implications for their catalytic application, due to differences in geometric and confinement effects. For instance, attempts have been reported to preferentially locate framework Al atoms in the intersectional sites or within the 10MR channels of ZSM-5 (MFI-type zeolite)5,6,7. However, when functional metals, such as Pt or Pd, have been introduced by including the metal precursor during the synthesis or through interzeolite transformations, nanoparticles of 1–2 nm instead of subnanometric metal species (single atoms or clusters) have been obtained within the MFI zeolite8,9,10,11. As far as we know, the metal particles show random distribution within the zeolite crystallites. From the materials and catalysis point of view, the following challenges remain unsolved: (1) to generate stable subnanometric metal species within the zeolite crystallites, (2) to stabilize them regioselectively within the 10MR channels and (3) to achieve the above goals with purely siliceous MFI zeolite and to avoid the presence of acid sites in the final material. Note that if these three objectives were achieved a very regular distribution of metal clusters of about 0.5 nm would be obtained, that is with the diameter of the 10MR channels, which would be highly stable against Ostwald ripening sintering, even at high temperature (>550 °C) under a reductive atmosphere12,13. This type of material should open new possibilities for a number of catalytic applications, including the very relevant activation of alkanes14,15,16,17.
It has been demonstrated that subnanometric Pt clusters show higher reactivity than Pt nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation reaction18. However, when Pt clusters are supported on solid carriers with open structures, these Pt clusters may suffer fast deactivation, and the subsequent regeneration–reaction cycles will lead to severe sintering of Pt. Therefore, if regular Pt clusters can be regioselectively generated within the 10MR channels of a purely siliceous MFI zeolite, the resultant catalyst should present not only high activity, but also an improved stability when working under high-temperature conditions.
To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials. The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+OH−) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position. Considering the larger space in the sinusoidal channels versus the straight channels, Pt species may preferentially be located in the sinusoidal channels. A controllable amount of K+ is introduced to compensate the silanol groups, and to stabilize the subnanometric Pt species19,20,21. Finally, atomically dispersed Sn species can also be introduced to electronically modify the Pt clusters to increase propylene selectivity for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
Encapsulation of Pt particles in MFI zeolite
As illustrated in Fig. 1a,b, by a one-pot synthesis strategy, Pt species can be encapsulated into purely siliceous MFI zeolite with a Pt loading of about 0.4 wt% (Supplementary Table 1). All the Pt-zeolite materials with different chemical compositions show typical X-ray diffraction patterns of MFI zeolite (Supplementary Fig. 1). Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species. As shown in Fig. 1c,d, Pt mainly exists as nanoparticles of 3–5 nm in the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 2), while subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.4–0.7 nm are the dominant species in the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 3). To investigate the role of K, we first characterized the as-synthesized, non-calcined, Pt-zeolite samples (K-Pt@MFI-SDA and Pt@MFI-SDA), obtained in the presence and absence of K, by electron microscopy. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5, only atomically dispersed Pt species are detected in both as-synthesized samples, as confirmed by image simulation (Supplementary Fig. 6). Herein, to identify the location of Pt atoms in Pt@MFI-SDA and K-Pt@MFI-SDA, we have employed a combination of high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR HAADF-STEM) and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) imaging techniques to simultaneously visualize both Pt atoms and the zeolite structure with atomic resolution22,23. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, by correlating the HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC images, it can be deduced that most Pt atoms are located in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite structure, whereas a far smaller number are found in the straight pore channels or at the intersectional voids. This regioselective distribution of Pt species may be caused by the occupation of the intersectional voids by the template (TPA+), as well as by the availability of larger spaces in the sinusoidal channels compared with the straight channels (Supplementary Fig. 7)24,25,26. The characteristics of the location of Pt atoms described above are the same when the synthesis is carried out in the presence of K+ (K-Pt@MFI-SDA sample), indicating that K+ does not play a relevant role in the encapsulation of atomically dispersed Pt species during the hydrothermal synthesis. This conclusion is also confirmed from characterization by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 2). A short-distance contribution at about 2.0 Å can be ascribed to Pt–O/N bonding, while the contribution of Pt–Pt bonding is not observed in either sample.

A subsequent calcination in air at 600 °C to remove the organic template in the as-synthesized Pt-MFI materials gives rise to the formation of Pt nanoparticles in the K-free Pt@MFI-air sample, indicating the migration and subsequent sintering of Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9). However, as presented in Supplementary Fig. 10, Pt remains atomically dispersed after calcination in air in the K-Pt@MFI-air sample. Interestingly, its location within the 10MR sinusoidal channels remains almost unchanged when compared with the as-synthesized K-Pt@MFI-SDA sample. A main contribution at about 2.0 Å, corresponding to Pt–O bonding, is observed in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum of the K-Pt@MFI-air sample (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 3), while a typical Pt–Pt bonding at about 2.7 Å is observed in the K-free Pt@MFI-air sample. The results from STEM-iDPC imaging and X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicate that the role of K is related to the stabilization of Pt atoms during the calcination process, avoiding their sintering into Pt nanoparticles19,20.
As shown in Supplementary Fig. 12, the number of –OH groups in the K-free Pt-zeolite samples measured by infrared spectroscopy decreased significantly after the introduction of K+ (ref. 27). A plausible explanation is that the –OH groups in the K-free zeolite are replaced by –O−K+ species. Furthermore, the –O−K+ species can interact with the positively charged Pt species by forming stabilized –O–Pt species during the high-temperature calcination in air. If the K+ in the K-Pt@MFI-air sample was exchanged for NH4+, Pt atoms sintered into Pt nanoparticles in the subsequent calcination at 600 °C in air and reduction treatment by H2 at 600 °C (Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Fig. 14).
Most interestingly, when the K-containing K-Pt@MFI-air sample was reduced in H2 at 600 °C, Pt atoms turned into subnanometric clusters, as shown in Fig. 1d. The low white-line intensity in the Pt L3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum of the K-Pt@MFI sample (Fig. 2a) indicates the presence of metallic Pt after the H2 reduction treatment. The coordination number of first-shell Pt–Pt (NPt–Pt) bonding for the K-Pt@MFI sample is about 6.6 (Table 1), corresponding to an average size of about 0.9 nm (Fig. 1h)28. Considering that the average size of Pt clusters and Pt nanoparticles is about 0.55 nm and about 2 nm respectively, then about 80% of Pt atoms should be located in the internal space of MFI crystallites as subnanometric clusters while about 20% of Pt atoms exist as Pt nanoparticles (according to the following simple estimation: 80% × 0.55 + 20% × 2 ≈ 0.85 nm). In the case of the K-free Pt@MFI sample, the first-shell NPt–Pt is about 10.6, corresponding to an average size of 4–5 nm, as shown in Fig. 1g.

Determination of the location of subnanometric Pt clusters
Considering the structure of MFI zeolite, one can expect that subnanometric encapsulated Pt clusters may distribute in different locations (including the straight channels, intersectional voids and sinusoidal channels). Therefore, we have analysed the HR HAADF-STEM results in further detail. For the K-Pt@MFI sample, as displayed in Fig. 3a,c, 0.4–0.6 nm Pt clusters can be clearly observed as high-intensity areas along the [010] direction, while the 10MR straight channels appear as low-intensity pores. Corresponding HR HAADF-STEM images in greyscale are shown in Supplementary Fig. 17. However, due to the weak contrast of the zeolite framework and its sensitivity to the electron beam, the detailed structure of the MFI zeolite is not well revealed in the HR HAADF-STEM image. By using the newly developed iDPC technique, the atomic structure of the MFI zeolite can be recorded simultaneously with the HR HAADF-STEM image under low-dose conditions (Fig. 3b)22,23. As presented in Fig. 3d, the detailed structure of the MFI zeolite can be clearly identified in the iDPC image, even the 5 R units in the framework. Since HR HAADF-STEM imaging is more sensitive to heavy elements (Pt in this work), and the structural information of the zeolite framework is finely captured by iDPC imaging, the precise location of subnanometric Pt clusters can be reliably identified by correlating the paired images. The results demonstrate that Pt clusters of 0.4–0.6 nm are preferentially located in the sinusoidal channels (see more images in Supplementary Figs. 18–22). The location of Pt clusters has also been confirmed by STEM-iDPC imaging on a zeolite crystallite with the tilted-[010] orientation (see Fig. 3e–h), showing that the subnanometric Pt clusters overlap with the sinusoidal channels.

By combining the images obtained in the two modes, we can identify the precise location of Pt species in the MFI zeolite, corresponding to the sinusoidal channels. q, Structural model of an MFI zeolite containing a single Pt atom, a single Sn atom, Pt clusters and Sn clusters in the sinusoidal channels along the [010] orientation. r, Simulated HAADF-STEM image of the model in q, showing the contrasts of the different types of metal species. s, Model of an MFI zeolite containing a single Pt atom, a single Sn atom, Pt clusters and Sn clusters along the tilted-[010] orientation. t, Simulated HAADF-STEM image of the model in s, showing the contrasts of the different types of metal species.

Synthesis of bimetallic PtSn@MFI
Following the same synthesis procedure, a second metal component such as Sn can be introduced together with Pt. Similar to the situation observed before, after calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig. 23) while the Pt species in the K-PtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed (Supplementary Fig. 24), as in the as-synthesized K-PtSn@MFI-SDA sample (Supplementary Fig. 25). After reduction by H2 at 600 °C, large Pt nanoparticles are formed in the PtSn@MFI sample (Fig. 1e,i and Supplementary Fig. 26), while subnanometric Pt clusters (~0.5 nm) are formed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample (Fig. 1f,j and Supplementary Fig. 27).
According to the XANES results (Fig. 2a), Pt species also exist in the metallic state in the PtSn@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI samples. As shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1, the K-free PtSn@MFI has a first-shell NPt–Pt of about 10.7, corresponding to Pt nanoparticles of 4–5 nm, while a first-shell NPt–Pt of about 6.4 is found for the K-PtSn@MFI sample, corresponding to an average size of about 0.9 nm. These results further confirm the critical role of K+ in stabilizing subnanometric Pt species18,19,20.
Following the same approach, we have studied the location of subnanometric Pt and Sn species in the K-PtSn@MFI sample by paired HR HAADF-STEM (Supplementary Fig. 28 images in greyscale) and iDPC imaging. As can be seen in Fig. 3i–p, subnanometric Pt and Sn species are also located in the 10MR sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite (see additional images in Supplementary Figs. 29–33). The oxidation state of Sn in the unreduced K-PtSn@MFI-air sample is determined to be Sn IV. After reduction by H2, a decrease in the white-line intensity and a redshift of the spectrum is observed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample. As shown in Fig. 2c, the shape of the XANES spectra of the reduced K-PtSn@MFI does not resemble either Sn metal or SnO, suggesting a possible formation of SnO4 − x species. This can also be supported by the reduction in the first-shell intensity of |FT| (Fig. 2d), indicating the loss of neighbouring oxygen. The idea that Sn species are well dispersed within the K-PtSn@MFI sample is supported by the EXAFS spectrum, since no additional higher shells are observed. Furthermore, we have found that the EXAFS spectrum of K-PtSn@MFI is different from that of Sn-Beta, indicating that Sn exists as an extraframework species (Supplementary Fig. 35)29,30.
The interaction between Pt and Sn in the K-PtSn@MFI sample has been investigated by CO infrared spectroscopy. As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 36, the CO adsorption bands at 1,887 and 1,719 cm−1 can only be observed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample, indicating that the introduction of Sn can modulate the electronic structure of Pt clusters. These bands are probably related to the formation of bimetallic PtSn species31.
As shown in Fig. 3q–t, the simulated images with Pt or Sn clusters located in the sinusoidal channels are consistent with the experimental images. According to our simulation results (Supplementary Figs. 37 and 38), it is possible to differentiate single Pt and Sn atoms from the zeolite framework. Indeed, we have observed a few singly dispersed atoms (Pt or Sn) in both K-Sn@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI samples (Supplementary Figs. 39 and 40). Considering the average particle size obtained from the EXAFS results, the number of singly dispersed Pt atoms in the K-Pt@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI samples should be low and Pt should mainly exist as subnanometric clusters (Supplementary Fig. 41).
Determination of the Pt and Sn distributions in K-PtSn@MFI
As displayed in Fig. 4a–f, K, Sn and Pt are homogeneously distributed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample according to the X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) mapping. However, due to the resolution limitation, it is not possible to determine the relative spatial relationship between Sn and Pt. To overcome the limitation of XEDS on such beam-sensitive samples, we have attempted, on the basis of the imaging simulation results (Supplementary Figs. 42–44), to discriminate Pt and Sn distributions by a k-means clustering analysis of the HR HAADF-STEM images (see Supplementary Information for details). As shown in Fig. 4g–i, subnanometric Pt and Sn species can be identified according to their different contrasts in the HR HAADF-STEM images. Then, in the image depicting the distribution of the Pt and Sn species (Fig. 4h) after k-means clustering, it is possible to pick out the Pt and Sn species that are in contact, simply by selecting those that fall at a distance shorter than 0.1 nm in Fig. 4h. This distance threshold was selected on the basis of the first-shell Sn–O distance found in the EXAFS analysis. As a result, it is possible to estimate the presence of bimetallic PtSn clusters in the K-PtSn@MFI sample that are made up of two neighbouring Pt and Sn units rather than alloyed clusters, as shown in Fig. 4h. The statistical analysis shows that about 40% of the subnanometric metal clusters automatically detected in the experimental image of Fig. 4g fall at a distance below 0.1 nm. It should be noted that this is a rough estimate, since the image analysis is based on two-dimensional projection images. This may result in an overestimation of the fraction of bimetallic clusters, since Pt and Sn at different depths may overlap in the STEM image. The complexity of the experimental images also makes it difficult to obtain an accurate percentage of the PtSn bimetallic clusters due to the difficulty of discriminating single Pt atoms and Sn clusters, as illustrated in Supplementary Figs. 42 and 43.

Additionally, in the experimental HR HAADF-STEM images of the K-PtSn@MFI sample, we have found areas showing intensity profiles similar to those observed in simulation results (Supplementary Fig. 45). The formation of such a subnanometric Pt–SnOx interfacial structure can explain the absence of Pt–Sn bonding in the EXAFS results, since Pt and Sn are not in the form of conventional PtSn alloy nanoparticles32,33,34,35.
Catalytic studies of Pt-zeolite materials
The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was chosen as a model reaction to test the reactivity and stability of Pt particles or clusters encapsulated in pure-silica MFI zeolite. As can be seen in Fig. 5a, Pt@MFI was initially active but a fast deactivation was observed. Therefore, regeneration of the deactivated sample was carried out by a calcination treatment in air at 600 °C followed by a subsequent reduction by H2 at 600 °C. However, fast deactivation was still observed in the second and third cycles (Supplementary Figs. 46 and 47). Agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles was observed with the used Pt@MFI catalyst after three catalytic cycles (Supplementary Fig. 48). When Sn was introduced as a promotor, the resultant PtSn@MFI showed a significantly enhanced activity and selectivity (Fig. 5b), in consistence with previous works on supported PtSn catalysts36,37. However, the PtSn@MFI catalyst also suffered severe deactivation during the regeneration–reaction cycles. As displayed in Supplementary Figs. 49 and 50, the PtSn@MFI catalyst only showed about one-third of its initial reactivity in the third cycle, which is caused by the sintering of Pt (Supplementary Fig. 51). Furthermore, a high initial activity was observed with the K-Pt@MFI sample, indicating the high reactivity of subnanometric Pt clusters (Fig. 5c). However, large quantities of cracking products (methane, ethylene and ethane) were formed, and the K-Pt@MFI catalyst also suffered a fast deactivation due to the coke formation. Interestingly, as demonstrated in Supplementary Figs. 52–54, the reactivity of the deactivated K-Pt@MFI catalyst can be fully recovered by at least three cycles of calcination–reduction treatment, and the subnanometric Pt clusters remain stable during these processes.

According to the above results, by the combination of K and Sn, the reactivity and stability of Pt should be enhanced. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5d, the K-PtSn@MFI sample shows high reactivity under the same reaction conditions as used before. More importantly, the selectivity to propylene at the initial stage is already quite high (~90%) and the lifetime of the catalyst is significantly extended. It should be noted that the K-Sn@MFI sample without Pt is not active for this reaction, indicating that Sn only modulates the reactivity of Pt. The high catalytic performance of K-PtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reaction–regeneration cycles without obvious deactivation (see Supplementary Figs. 55 and 56). The size and spatial location of the subnanometric Pt clusters are preserved after reaction, which is confirmed by EXAFS and electron microscopy characterizations (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Figs. 57–61). The Pt clusters in the K-PtSn@MFI sample remain subnanometric even after oxidation–reduction treatment at 700 °C (Supplementary Figs. 62 and 63). The reactivity and recyclability of different Pt-zeolite catalysts has been compared in terms of initial turnover frequency, mass activity and deactivation rate (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Figs. 64 and 65). These results clearly demonstrate that subnanometric PtSn clusters confined in the 10MR channels are a highly stable and selective catalyst for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
For comparison, a reference K-PtSn/MFI sample with the same chemical composition as the K-PtSn@MFI sample was also prepared by conventional incipient wetness impregnation (Supplementary Fig. 66), containing well dispersed Pt particles of 0.4–1.2 nm. The STEM-iDPC images show that Pt species appear in several types of position in the MFI zeolite, including the sinusoidal channels and straight channels as well as the intersectional void (Supplementary Figs. 67 and 68). As shown in Supplementary Figs. 69 and 70, the K-PtSn/MFI sample presented a fast deactivation during the propane dehydrogenation reaction, and its reactivity declined after each regeneration treatment. Large Pt nanoparticles are formed in the used K-PtSn/MFI catalyst after three catalytic cycles (Supplementary Fig. 71), indicating the advantage of K-PtSn@MFI catalyst with regioselective location of subnanometric Pt clusters in sinusoidal channels.
Outlook
The concept of regioselective localization of extraframework metal species demonstrated in this work can be extended to other crystalline porous materials, including both metal–organic frameworks and zeolites. Moreover, the use of two complementary STEM-based techniques (HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC) can be a general approach for studying the position of metal species in heterogeneous metal catalysts at atomic level.
Methods
One-pot synthesis of MFI zeolites with encapsulation of Pt
Synthesis of Pt@MFI material (Pt nanoparticles encapsulated in purely siliceous MFI)
Pt nanoparticles encapsulated in MFI zeolite were prepared by a one-pot synthesis. First, a tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) solution was prepared by mixing 8.12 g of K-free TPAOH solution (40 wt%, from Alfa-Aesar, product code 17456.22) and 20.1 g of distilled water at room temperature. Then, 8.24 g tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was hydrolysed with the TPAOH solution at room temperature for 6 h under stirring (500 r.p.m.). The resultant solution was divided into two parts with the same weight. To each portion of the solution, 80 μl H2PtCl6 aqueous (0.38 mol l−1) and 150 μl of ethylenediamine were added with stirring for 10 min. The resultant yellow solution was then transferred to Teflon-lined autoclaves and heated in an electric oven at 175 °C for 96 h under static conditions. The amount of Pt in the final product is 0.43 wt%. After the hydrothermal process, the solid product was isolated by filtration and washed with distilled water and acetone and then dried at 60 °C. Then the solid sample was calcined under an air flow at 560 °C for 8 h and then at 600 °C for 2 h.

K-promoted Pt clusters encapsulated in MFI zeolite were prepared by a one-pot synthesis. First, a TPAOH solution was prepared by mixing 5.0 g of K-free TPAOH solution (40 wt%, from Alfa-Aesar, product code 17456.22) and 6.24 g of TPAOH solution (20 wt%, from Sigma-Aldrich, containing ~0.6 wt% of K, product code 254533–100 G) and 17.0 g of distilled water at room temperature. Then, 8.24 g TEOS were hydrolysed with the TPAOH solution at room temperature for 6 h under stirring (500 r.p.m.). The resultant solution was divided into two parts of equal weight. To each portion of the solution, 80 μl of aqueous H2PtCl6 (0.38 mol l−1) and 150 μl of ethylenediamine were added and stirred for 10 min. The resultant yellow solution was then transferred to Teflon-lined autoclaves and heated in an electric oven at 175 °C for 96 h under static conditions. The amounts of Pt and K in the final product were 0.42 wt% and 0.6 wt%, respectively. After the hydrothermal process, the solid product was isolated by filtration and washed with distilled water and acetone and then dried at 60 °C. Then the solid sample was calcined under air flow at 560 °C for 8 h and then at 600 °C for 2 h.
Synthesis of K-PtSn@MFI (K-promoted PtSn bimetallic clusters encapsulated in purely siliceous MFI)
K-promoted PtSn bimetallic clusters encapsulated in MFI zeolite were prepared by a one-pot synthesis. First, a TPAOH solution was prepared by mixing 5.0 g K-free TPAOH solution (40 wt%, from Alfa-Aesar without K, product code 17456.22) and 6.24 g TPAOH (20 wt% from Sigma-Aldrich, containing ~0.6 wt% of K, product code 254533–100 G) and 17.0 g of distilled water at room temperature. Then, 8.24 g TEOS was hydrolysed with the TPAOH solution at room temperature for 6 h with stirring (500 r.p.m.). The resultant solution was divided into two parts with equal weight. To each portion of the solution, 80 μl of aqueous H2PtCl6 (0.38 mol l−1), 50 mg of SnCl4 5H2O and 150 μl of ethylenediamine were added to the above solution and the mixture stirred for 10 min. The resultant yellow solution was then transferred to Teflon-lined autoclaves and heated in an electric oven at 175 °C for 96 h under static conditions. The amounts of Pt, Sn and K in the final product were 0.42 wt%, 0.9 wt% and 0.65 wt%, respectively. After the hydrothermal process, the solid product was isolated by filtration and washed with distilled water and acetone and then dried at 60 °C. Then the solid sample was calcined under air flow at 560 °C for 8 h and then at 600 °C for 2 h.
Synthesis of K-PtSn/MFI by conventional incipient wetness impregnation
First, a K-promoted purely siliceous MFI support was prepared. 5.0 g K-free TPAOH solution (40 wt%, from Alfa-Aesar without K, product code 17456.22) and 6.24 g TPAOH (20 wt% from Sigma-Aldrich containing ~0.6 wt% of K, product code 254533–100 G) and 17.0 g of distilled water at room temperature. Then, 8.24 g TEOS were hydrolysed with the TPAOH solution at room temperature for 6 h with stirring (500 r.p.m.). The resultant solution was divided into two parts with equal weight and then transferred to Teflon-lined autoclaves and heated in an electric oven at 175 °C for 96 h under static conditions.

Then the solid sample was calcined under air flow at 560 °C for 8 h and then at 600 °C for 2 h.
Taking this K-MFI as support, Pt and Sn together with ethylenediamine are introduced into the K-MFI support by conventional incipient wetness impregnation. The amounts of Pt and Sn are the same as for the K-PtSn@MFI sample prepared by one-pot synthesis.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction was performed with a HTPhilips X’Pert MPD diffractometer equipped with a PW3050 goniometer using Cu Kα radiation and a multisampling handler.
Samples for electron microscopy studies were prepared by dropping the suspension of the solid samples in CH2Cl2 directly onto holey-carbon-coated copper grids. Electron microscopy measurements were performed using two types of microscope. A non-corrected JEOL 2100 F microscope operating at 200 kV in both transmission (TEM) and scanning transmission modes (STEM) was used to record HAADF, Z-contrast, images at low resolution. HR HAADF-STEM and STEM-iDPC imaging was performed on a double-aberration-corrected, monochromated, FEI Titan3 Themis 60–300 microscope working at 300 kV. The last technique, iDPC imaging, provides in this microscope atomically resolved images in which the contrasts are related to the atomic number of the elements under the beam, instead of the roughly Z2-dependent contrasts obtained in HAADF-STEM images. By using a four-segment detector, this technique allows imaging light elements, such as O, in the presence of heavier ones (Si, Z = 14) under very low-electron-dose conditions, a key aspect in the atomic-scale structural analysis of zeolites, which are very sensitive to electron beams. In particular, 2048 × 2048 HAADFiDPC image pairs were recorded simultaneously using a convergence angle of 18.6 mrad and a camera length of 91 mm. This configuration allowed us to optimize the collection of the signals on the HAADF and FEI DF4 detectors. To limit the damage by the electron beam, a fast image-recording protocol was used by combining a beam current of 30 pA, a 2.5 μs dwell time and an automated fine-tuning alignment of A1 and C1 using the OptiSTEM software. To obtain images with good quality, the beam current and image acquisition time should be optimized according to the stability of the sample under the beam.
The microscope was also used to perform chemical mapping at medium magnifications (approximately 100k to 200k) by STEM-XEDS using the high-efficiency SuperX G2 detection system equipped in the microscope, which integrates four windowless detectors surrounding the sample and high-performance signal-processing hardware. STEM-XEDS was used to map the spatial distribution of both metallic (Sn, Pt, K) and non-metallic elements (Si, O). For this nanoanalytical experiment, the beam current was increased to 100 pA and the dwell time to 128 μs to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio. Then, the elemental maps were background subtracted and smoothed by 3 pixel × 3 pixel averaging.
To determine the spatial distribution of the metallic species within the zeolite framework, a specific methodology for the digital analysis of the experimental images has been developed and coded in a home-made MATLAB script. First, to improve the signal-to-noise, the HR HAADF-STEM images were denoised by combining the Anscombe transform and undecimated wavelet transforms38. Then, a user-independent, fully automated, segmentation of image contrasts by clustering techniques (k-means method) was applied to recognize and classify the metallic entities, which is a requirement to guarantee statistically meaningful and unbiased results.
To support the k-means clustering analysis and interpretation of the details of the experimental images, HR HAADF-STEM image simulation was carried out using TEMSIM software39. The complex structural models used as input in these simulations were built using the Rhodius software developed at UCA40. To approach the experimental imaging conditions as closely as possible, a mixture of Poisson and white Gaussian noise was added to the simulated images. Then, the same methodology as used to analyse the experimental images was applied to the deliberately noise-corrupted simulated images.
X-ray absorption experiments at the Pt (11,564 eV) LIII and Sn (29,200 eV) K edges were performed in the ALBA synchrotron41. The beam was monochromatized using Si(111) and (311) double crystals, respectively; harmonic rejection was performed using Rh-coated Si mirrors. The spectra were collected in transmission (Pt LIII-edge) and fluorescence (Sn K-edge) modes by means of the ionization chambers filled with appropriate gases (Pt LIII edge, 95% N2 + 5% Kr for I0 (ionization chamber 0, located before the sample) and 17.1% N2 + 82.9% Kr for I1 (ionization chamber 1, located after the sample); Sn K edge, 89.4% N2 + 10.6% Kr for I0 and 100% Kr for I1) and a fluorescence solid-state detector. Samples in the form of self-supported pellets of optimized thickness were located inside an in-house-built multipurpose cell described by Guilera et al. allowing in situ experiments42. Several scans were acquired at each measurement step to ensure spectral reproducibility and good signal-to-noise ratio. The data reduction and extraction of the χ(k) function were performed using the Athena code43. EXAFS data analysis was performed using the Artemis software43. Phase and amplitudes were calculated with the FEFF6 code. The values of E0 (inflection point in the first derivative of XANES spectra) used for data alignment taken from the literature were the following: 29,200 eV for Sn metal, 29,201 eV for SnO, 29,204 eV for SnO2 and 11,564 eV for Pt metal.
Infrared spectra of adsorbed CO on Pt-zeolite and Sn-zeolite samples were recorded at room temperature with a Nexus 8700 FT infrared spectrometer using a deuterated triglycine sulphate detector acquiring at 4 cm−1 resolution. An infrared cell allowing in situ treatments in controlled atmospheres and temperatures from 25 °C to 500 °C was connected to a vacuum system with gas dosing facility. For infrared studies the samples were pressed into self-supported wafers and pretreated in H2 flow at 450 °C for 2 h followed by vacuum treatment (10–5 mbar). After activation the samples were cooled to 25 °C under dynamic vacuum conditions followed by CO dosing at increasing pressure (0.4–8.5 mbar). Infrared spectra were recorded after each dosage of CO.
The dispersion of Pt in Pt-zeolite materials was estimated from CO adsorption using the double-isotherm method on Quantachrome Autosorb-1C equipment44,45. Before adsorption, the samples (200–300 mg) were reduced in situ in flowing pure H2 (25 ml min−1) at 600 °C for 1 h with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 from room temperature to 600 °C. After the reduction treatment, the samples were degassed at 1.33 Pa for 2 h at 600 °C and then cooled to about 40 °C. Then pure CO was admitted and the first adsorption isotherm (that is, the total CO uptake) was measured. After evacuation at 25 °C, the second isotherm (that is, the reversible CO uptake) was measured. The amount of chemisorbed CO was then obtained by subtracting the two isotherms. The pressure range studied was 0.5–11 × 104 Pa. The dispersion of Pt (D) was calculated from the amount of irreversibly adsorbed CO assuming a stoichiometry of Pt/CO = 1. The mean particle size (d) of Pt was determined from chemisorption data assuming spherical geometry for the metal particle according to the procedure. Equations used for calculation of metal dispersion and metal particle size are shown below.

Catalytic studies of Pt-zeolite materials for propane dehydrogenation reactions
The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was chosen as a model reaction to test the reactivity and stability of Pt particles or clusters encapsulated in pure-silica MFI zeolite. The reaction was performed with a fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure using N2–propane as feed gas at 600 °C. The products were analysed using a gas chromatograph that can detect cracking products (methane, ethene and ethane), propylene, C4, C5 and aromatics. Before reaction, the catalyst was reduced by H2 flow (35 ml min−1) at 600 °C for 1 h with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 600 °C. After the reduction pretreatment, the atmosphere was changed to reaction feed gas (5 ml min−1 of propane and 16 ml min−1 of N2 as balance gas). After the propane dehydrogenation test, the sample was cooled to about 100 °C and began to be regenerated by calcination in air at 600 °C for 2 h with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 from about 100 °C to 600 °C. After calcination in air, the sample was cooled to about 100 °C again and then reduced by H2 at 600 °C for 1 h with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 from about 100 °C to 600 °C before the second cycle of the propane dehydrogenation reaction. After the second cycle of propane dehydrogenation, the sample was cooled to about 100 °C and began to be regenerated by calcination in air at 600 °C for 2 h with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 from about 100 °C to 600 °C. After calcination in air, the sample was cooled to about 100 °C again and then reduced by H2 at 600 °C for 1 h with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 from about 100 °C to 600 °C before the third cycle of the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
