<quotes>
[1] "Pt clusters of 0.4–0.6 nm are preferentially located in the sinusoidal channels (see more images in Supplementary Figs. 18–22)."

[2] "When functional metals, such as Pt or Pd, have been introduced by including the metal precursor during the synthesis or through interzeolite transformations, nanoparticles of 1–2 nm instead of subnanometric metal species (single atoms or clusters) have been obtained within the MFI zeolite8,9,10,11."  

[3] "As far as we know, the metal particles show random distribution within the zeolite crystallites."

[4] "From the materials and catalysis point of view, the following challenges remain unsolved: (1) to generate stable subnanometric metal species within the zeolite crystallites, (2) to stabilize them regioselectively within the 10MR channels and (3) to achieve the above goals with purely siliceous MFI zeolite and to avoid the presence of acid sites in the final material."

[5] "If the K+ in the K-Pt@MFI-air sample was exchanged for NH4+, Pt atoms sintered into Pt nanoparticles in the subsequent calcination at 600 °C in air and reduction treatment by H2 at 600 °C (Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Fig. 14)."

[6] "Supplementary Fig. 55 and Supplementary Fig. 56 show that the high catalytic performance of K-PtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reaction–regeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates the MFI zeolite structure as a support for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It introduces Pt and PtSn clusters into the MFI framework and shows they are preferentially located and stabilized in the 10MR sinusoidal channels compared to other locations like intersections or straight channels. Previous works loaded Pt randomly into MFI but formed larger nanoparticles, while this work forms subnanometric clusters regioselectively in the sinusoidal channels. The siliceous MFI with K stabilization avoids acid sites and sinters the PtSn clusters. The regioselective PtSn@MFI catalyst demonstrates high stability for propane dehydrogenation over multiple cycles.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文评估了MFI分子筛作为丙烷脱氢催化剂载体。它将Pt和PtSn簇导入MFI框架,并显示它们优先定位和稳定在10MR弯曲通道,而不是像交叉口或直通道等其他位置。先前的工作将Pt随机负载到MFI中,但形成了较大的纳米粒子,而本工作在正弦波通道中选择性地形成了亚纳米簇。缺乏酸点的硅MFI与K稳定剂一起使PtSn簇形成烧结。定域的PtSn@MFI催化剂表现出高稳定性,可在多个环节中脱氢丙烷。
