6. "Interestingly, as demonstrated in Supplementary Figs. 5254, the reactivity of the deactivated K-Pt@MFI catalyst can be fully recovered by at least three cycles of calcinationreduction treatment, and the subnanometric Pt clusters remain stable during these processes."

7. "According to the above results, by the combination of K and Sn, the reactivity and stability of Pt should be enhanced. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5d, the K-PtSn@MFI sample shows high reactivity under the same reaction conditions as used before. More importantly, the selectivity to propylene at the initial stage is already quite high (90%) and the lifetime of the catalyst is significantly extended."

2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides data showing that subnanometric Pt clusters confined in the 10MR channels of MFI zeolite have high stability during propane dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles when promoted by K and Sn.

8. "To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials. The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+OH) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position." 

9. "Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species. As shown in Fig. 1c,d, Pt mainly exists as nanoparticles of ~3-5nm in the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 2), while subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.4-0.7nm are the dominant species in the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 3)."

3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses one-pot synthesis techniques to encapsulate subnanometric Pt clusters within the 10MR channels of MFI zeolite, using TPA+ template molecules to block intersectional voids and K+ ions to stabilize the Pt species.

10. "To achieve this goal, we have studied the location of subnanometric Pt and Sn species in the K-PtSn@MFI sample by paired HR HAADF-STEM (Supplementary Fig. 28 images in greyscale) and iDPC imaging. As can be seen in Fig. 3i–p, subnanometric Pt and Sn species are also located in the 10MR sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite (see additional images in Supplementary Figs. 29–33)."

11. "As shown in Fig. 2c, the shape of the XANES spectra of the reduced K-PtSn@MFI does not resemble either Sn metal or SnO, suggesting a possible formation of SnOx species. This can also be supported by the reduction in the first-shell intensity of FT (Fig. 2d), indicating the loss of neighbouring oxygen."

<English version answer>

6. Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows XANES data indicating the formation of SnOx species after H2 reduction of K-PtSn@MFI, supported by a reduction in first-shell intensity in the EXAFS spectrum.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

6. 答案:是的,本文使用基于X射线的技术来探查丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。它显示了XANES数据,表明在H2还原K-PtSn@MFI之后形成了SnOx物种,这一点由EXAFS谱中的第一配位球强度减少所支持。
