[1] "Pt clusters of 0.4–0.6 nm are preferentially located in the sinusoidal channels (see more images in Supplementary Figs. 18–22)."

[2] "When functional metals, such as Pt or Pd, have been introduced by including the metal precursor during the synthesis or through interzeolite transformations, nanoparticles of 1–2 nm instead of subnanometric metal species (single atoms or clusters) have been obtained within the MFI zeolite8,9,10,11."  

[3] "As far as we know, the metal particles show random distribution within the zeolite crystallites."

[4] "From the materials and catalysis point of view, the following challenges remain unsolved: (1) to generate stable subnanometric metal species within the zeolite crystallites, (2) to stabilize them regioselectively within the 10MR channels and (3) to achieve the above goals with purely siliceous MFI zeolite and to avoid the presence of acid sites in the final material."

[5] "If the K+ in the K-Pt@MFI-air sample was exchanged for NH4+, Pt atoms sintered into Pt nanoparticles in the subsequent calcination at 600 °C in air and reduction treatment by H2 at 600 °C (Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Fig. 14)."

[6] "Supplementary Fig. 55 and Supplementary Fig. 56 show that the high catalytic performance of K-PtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reaction–regeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates the MFI zeolite structure as a support for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It introduces Pt and PtSn clusters into the MFI framework and shows they are preferentially located and stabilized in the 10MR sinusoidal channels compared to other locations like intersections or straight channels. Previous works loaded Pt randomly into MFI but formed larger nanoparticles, while this work forms subnanometric clusters regioselectively in the sinusoidal channels. The siliceous MFI with K stabilization avoids acid sites and sinters the PtSn clusters. The regioselective PtSn@MFI catalyst demonstrates high stability for propane dehydrogenation over multiple cycles.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文评估了MFI分子筛作为丙烷脱氢催化剂载体。它将Pt和PtSn簇导入MFI框架,并显示它们优先定位和稳定在10MR弯曲通道,而不是像交叉口或直通道等其他位置。先前的工作将Pt随机负载到MFI中,但形成了较大的纳米粒子,而本工作在正弦波通道中选择性地形成了亚纳米簇。缺乏酸点的硅MFI与K稳定剂一起使PtSn簇形成烧结。定域的PtSn@MFI催化剂表现出高稳定性,可在多个环节中脱氢丙烷。

<quotes>
[1] Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species. As shown in Fig. 1c,d, Pt mainly exists as nanoparticles of ~3-5 nm in the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 2), while subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.4-0.7 nm are the dominant species in the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 3).

[2] According to the XANES results (Fig. 2a), Pt species also exist in the metallic state in the PtSn@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI samples. As shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1, the K-free PtSn@MFI has a first-shell NPt-Pt of about 10.7, corresponding to Pt nanoparticles of ~4-5 nm, while a first-shell NPt-Pt of about 6.4 is found for the K-PtSn@MFI sample, corresponding to an average size of about 0.9 nm. These results further confirm the critical role of K+ in stabilizing subnanometric Pt species18,19,20.

[3] Interestingly, as demonstrated in Supplementary Figs. 52–54, the reactivity of the deactivated K-Pt@MFI catalyst can be fully recovered by at least three cycles of calcination-reduction treatment, and the subnanometric Pt clusters remain stable during these processes.

[4] Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5d, the K-PtSn@MFI sample shows high reactivity under the same reaction conditions as used before. More importantly, the selectivity to propylene at the initial stage is already quite high (90%) and the lifetime of the catalyst is significantly extended. It should be noted that the K-Sn@MFI sample without Pt is not active for this reaction, indicating that Sn only modulates the reactivity of Pt. The high catalytic performance of K-PtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reaction-regeneration cycles without obvious deactivation (see Supplementary Figs. 55 and 56).

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that adding Sn helps stabilize subnanometric Pt clusters of 0.4-0.7 nm size compared to pure Pt, which forms larger nanoparticles of 3-5 nm. The Pt-Sn catalyst maintains high selectivity to propylene (~90%) and catalytic performance over multiple reaction cycles, while pure Pt deactivates. This demonstrates Sn helps modulate and improve Pt catalyst performance.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,这篇文章评估了Pt-Sn双金属催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它显示添加Sn有助于稳定亚纳米Pt簇,其大小为0.4-0.7 nm,而纯Pt会形成较大的纳米粒子,大小为3-5 nm。Pt-Sn催化剂在多个反应循环中保持了高的丙烯选择性(~90%)和催化性能,而纯Pt会发生失活。这表明Sn有助于调制和改善Pt催化剂的性能。

[1] To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials. The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+OH) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position. Considering the larger space in the sinusoidal channels versus the straight channels, Pt species may preferentially be located in the sinusoidal channels. 

[2]Pt nanoparticles encapsulated in MFI zeolite were prepared by a one-pot synthesis.

[3]Bimetallic PtSn nanoparticles encapsulated in MFI zeolite were prepared by a one-pot synthesis. 

[4]K-promoted Pt clusters encapsulated in MFI zeolite were prepared by a one-pot synthesis.
