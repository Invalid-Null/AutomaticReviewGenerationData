1. To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials. The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position. Considering the larger space in the sinusoidal channels versus the straight channels, Pt species may preferentially be located in the sinusoidal channels.

3. A controllable amount of K+ is introduced to compensate the silanol groups, and to stabilize the subnanometric Pt species.

4. No relevant quotes

5. We have achieved a very high preference for localization of highly stable subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite, as revealed by atomically resolved electron microscopy combining high-angle annular dark-field and integrated differential phase contrast imaging techniques.

6. X-ray absorption experiments at the Pt (11,564eV) LIII and Sn (29,200eV) K edges were performed in the ALBA synchrotron.

1. The article describes using a one-pot synthesis method with TPA+ template molecules to preferentially locate Pt species in the zeolite sinusoidal channels in order to achieve isolated single sites. No other specific methods or examples for synthesizing isolated single sites are discussed.

2. No, the article does not evaluate this.

3. The article investigates introducing a controllable amount of K+ during catalyst preparation to stabilize subnanometric Pt species and optimize dispersion. No other techniques or examples are discussed.

4. No, the article does not utilize any in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

5. The article employs STEM and integrated differential phase contrast imaging techniques to characterize the localization of Pt and PtSn clusters in the zeolite sinusoidal channels. No other microscopy techniques or insights are provided.

6. The article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Pt LIII and Sn K edges to probe changes in oxidation state during H2 reduction. No insights during propane dehydrogenation catalysis specifically are revealed.

7. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types.
