 Based on reviewing the details in the document, I do not believe this manuscript is related to propane dehydrogenation. The document focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of 1-butene to 1,3-butadiene over zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) catalysts. No information about propane dehydrogenation is presented.
