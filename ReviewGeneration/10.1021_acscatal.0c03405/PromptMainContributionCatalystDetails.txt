Stabilizing Oxidative Dehydrogenation Active Sites at High Temperature with Steam: ZnFe2O4-Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenation of 1-Butene to 1,3-Butadiene

Abstract
Dehydrogenation reactions are central for the production of functional molecules. Steam plays a pivotal role in ZnFe2O4-catalyzed 1-butene oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). However, the essential effect of steam on this reaction is still unclear. Herein, we describe the structure–performance relationships of ZnFe2O4 in the presence/absence of steam by combined density functional theory and experimental studies. The catalytic performances of ZnFe2O4 under different reaction conditions were investigated. The ZnFe2O4(110) surface properties under reaction conditions and molecular reaction pathways were modeled. Free-energy profiles were calculated. We found that an oxygen-excess ZnFe2O4(110)–O termination, with an extra O atom bridging two Fe cations, is preferred under oxygen-rich conditions. However, both experimental and theoretical approaches indicate that this surface bicoordinated O is not stable at relatively high temperatures in the absence of steam, resulting in the reduction of surface Fe3+ cations to Fe2+ which are inactive in the 1-butene ODH reaction. It was found that steam interacts strongly with the ZnFe2O4(110)–O surface. Steam stabilizes the catalyst surface Fe3+ ions by converting bicoordinated O to more thermally stable hydroxyl groups. Surface hydroxyls are active sites for C–H bond cleavage in the 1-butene ODH reaction in the presence of steam. We propose that the role of steam elucidated here represents a general mode of steam influence in ODH reactions over oxide surfaces.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of hydrocarbons is a very important reaction. Transition-metal oxides are frequently used as efficient heterogeneous catalysts for ODH of hydrocarbons. However, the C–H bond is difficult to activate and significant barriers remain to be passed, which necessitate to operate at high temperature for high conversion. One problem is that the active sites for H abstraction are surface O atoms, and these sites are not very stable at high temperature, where the metal tends to get reduced. (1−3) There is hence an incompatibility between the temperature requirements for activity and the stability of the active site.
ODH of butenes is a highly attractive process to produce 1,3-butadiene, which is one of the most important bulk chemicals in the production of acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene, butadiene rubber, styrene–butadiene rubber, and plastics. Various catalysts have been investigated for the ODH of butenes, including ferrite-type catalysts, (4−9) Bi–Mo-based catalysts, (10−12) vanadium-based catalysts, (13,14) Pd-based catalysts, (15) Pt-based catalysts, (16) and carbon nanotube catalysts. (17) The nature of the active site for these ODH catalysts and the influence of reaction conditions are central questions in the domain. Among these catalysts, low-cost and environment-friendly metal ferrite compounds have been extensively studied as efficient catalysts for ODH of butenes and industrially applied since the 1970s. The spinel ZnFe2O4 is an active phase among these ferrite catalysts. Previous experimental studies shed some light on reaction and catalyst deactivation mechanisms for ZnFe2O4-catalyzed ODH of butenes. (18,19) However, to the best of our knowledge, no computational study has been performed to understand the reaction mechanism at the atomic level.
Excess of steam is required in the ZnFe2O4-catalyzed 1-butene ODH reaction to obtain a practical 1,3-butadiene yield, which is very energy-consuming. Both activity and selectivity are significantly improved upon the introduction of steam to the reaction system; however, the atomic-level understanding of the key role of steam is still missing. The hydroxylation of oxide catalyst surfaces has been intensively studied because steam is present in many industrial processes. (20−27) It is known to influence the acid–base properties and the activities in several catalytic systems. (25,28) Dissociative adsorption of water on ZnFe2O4 is also reported. (29,30) For example, Yang and co-workers suggested that the hydroxyls on metal ferrite catalysts modified by steam provide more basic sites and are more active than the corresponding hydroxyl-free oxide surfaces for the 1-butene ODH reaction. (31) However, the question concerning which sites are more active for the 1-butene ODH reaction is still open, and the reaction mechanism involving the steam addition remains elusive because of the missing atomic-level explanation.
In the present study, we unravel the critical role of steam in ODH of 1-butene on the ZnFe2O4 catalyst. To achieve this objective, the nature of ZnFe2O4 surfaces was explored, and the catalytic properties of ZnFe2O4 under different reaction conditions, specifically at low/high temperature and in the presence/absence of steam, were investigated. The surface properties under reaction conditions and reaction pathways were modeled based on density functional theory (DFT), and the free-energy profiles for reaction pathways were calculated. Comparing reaction pathways with and without cofed steam, the essential role of steam was elucidated for the first time: stabilizing the active Fe3+ species.

Catalyst Preparation and Characterization
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (2.975 g) and 8.080 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were mixed and dissolved in 200 mL of absolute ethanol. (32) Ethanolamine (0.62 g) was then added as the complexing agent, and the total solution was stirred for 4 h at 60 °C. The resultant solution was then heated at 300 °C for 4 h in a muffle furnace to remove the solvent, and further calcination was conducted at 650 °C for another 10 h to yield the ZnFe2O4 catalyst. Its crystalline form was checked using powder X-ray diffraction. Then, the catalyst was imaged by high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)–scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) on an FEI Titan Cubed Themis G2 300 kV instrument with an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) and an analyzer pass energy of 20 eV. The base pressure in the XPS chamber was kept under 10–9 Torr. The C 1s line at 284.6 eV was used to calibrate the binding energies (B.E.s) of the elements. Fe 3p was used instead of the strongest photoemission line Fe 2p because of core-hole relaxation effects in Fe 2p satellite lines. CO-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using an FTIR spectrometer (Bruker VERTEX 70V) equipped with a stainless-steel high-vacuum transmission infrared cell. The calcinated ZnFe2O4 sample was pressed into the spot on a tungsten mesh support. Prior to the experiment, the sample was cleaned under vacuum (2 × 10–8 mbar) at room temperature for 4 h. After cooling down to 130 K by using liquid nitrogen, the background spectrum was recorded. Subsequently, 10 mbar of CO was introduced into the cell, and then, the corresponding spectra were recorded at indicated temperatures under 1 × 10–7 mbar. Then, the sample was heated to 653 K under vacuum (1 × 10–7 mbar) overnight. After cooling down to 130 K, the background spectrum was recorded. Then, 10 mbar of CO was introduced into the cell, and the corresponding spectra were recorded at indicated temperatures under 1 × 10–7 mbar.
The 1-butene adsorption–desorption experiment was performed on a ChemBET/TPR/TPD unit (Quantachrome). Before adsorption, the catalyst pretreated by an O2–steam mixture at 380 °C for 2 h was purged with helium at 200 °C for 2 h. 1-Butene was adsorbed on the catalyst at −78 °C. Excess gaseous 1-butene was removed by helium purging at −78 °C before stepwise thermal desorption of the adsorbate. Helium gas was passed through the catalyst at a flow rate of 30 mL/min at atmospheric pressure. The temperature was ramped with a rate of 0.5 K/s.
Catalytic Performance Test
The ODH of 1-butene was carried out using an isothermal fixed-bed downflow quartz reactor (a 10 mm i.d.) at a 1 atm total pressure. First, 1.0 g of the ZnFe2O4 catalyst (particles of 0.1–0.2 mm) and 5.0 g of quartz sand (particles of 0.1–0.2 mm) were placed upon a layer of inert glass wool. A thermocouple was used to monitor the temperature of the catalyst. Water was vaporized by passing through a preheating zone and continuously fed into the reactor together with 1-butene and air. The feed ratio of 1-butene/air/steam (or N2 in the absence of steam) is 1:3.8:12. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 400 h–1 on the basis of 1-butene. Downstream from the reactor, steam was condensed and piped to a drain. The feed components and the reaction products were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890) equipped with PLOT/Q (for CO2), activated Al2O3 (for hydrocarbons), and Molsieve 5 (for H2, O2, N2, and CO) columns and flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors. The conversion of feed components, selectivity, and yield of the reaction products were calculated from the inlet and outlet concentrations considering the changes of reaction volume during the reaction. The reaction temperature was varied from 355 to 380 °C in the activation energy measurement, while 30.4 mg of the catalyst was used, and the 1-butene conversion was controlled below 15%.
DFT Calculations
DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP), version 5.4.1. (33,34) The projector augmented wave method was used for modeling the interaction between valence electrons and effective cores. (35,36) The exchange–correlation energy was calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional, (37) and the dDsC correction was exploited for the van der Waals interaction. (38) A cutoff energy of plane wave of 520 eV provides converged electronic energies. A Hubbard U of Ueff = 5.3 eV is also applied to the Fe d orbitals to describe strong correlation effects. With this value, the DFT-calculated redox properties during lithiation and the computed lattice parameter and magnetic moment for ZnFe2O4 agree well with the experimental values. (39,40) A symmetric seven-layer ZnFe2O4(110) slab, corresponding to a (1 × 2) supercell, was used for the calculations. The atoms (one layer) in the center of the slab are fixed at their bulk positions, while the other atoms are allowed to fully relax. The Brillouin zone is sampled using a 4 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack mesh. Atomic positions are relaxed until forces on unconstrained atoms fall below 0.02 eV/Å during structure optimization. A vacuum of 20 Å is introduced in the Z-direction to avoid the interaction between the periodic images, and the dipole correction is also applied.
The surface energy of each termination is calculated according to

Ni and μi are the number of atoms of type i in the slab and its chemical potential, respectively. A is the surface area of the slab. The factor 2 arises from the existence of two identical surfaces. Surfaces with water adsorption are compared by relative surface free energies, defined as

where Gslab, Gslab+nH2O, and GH2O are the Gibbs free energies of the bare slab, the slab with n adsorbed H2O molecules, and a single gas-phase H2O molecule, respectively. The enthalpy of the slab was approximated as the sum of the electronic energy and the zero-point energy using harmonic frequencies. Vibrational frequencies are calculated using finite differences with a displacement of 0.015 Å. The changes in the Fe oxidation state can be identified by magnetic moments, that is, 3.65–3.78 μB for Fe2+ and 4.20–4.36 μB for Fe3+. (41) Gibbs free energies of gas-phase water were calculated using standard formulas for rotational, translational, and vibrational freedoms. (42) When calculating the adsorption free energies of water on the ZnFe2O4 surfaces, the electronic energy and the zero-point energy of condensed phases were accounted. Transition-state structures are located by the nudged elastic band (NEB) method. (43,44) A vibrational analysis was conducted on the optimized transition states, confirming that only one imaginary frequency is present.

ZnFe2O4 Surfaces: Structures and Stability
In a 56-atom ZnFe2O4 cubic supercell constructed from the 14-atom primitive cell, the DFT-optimized lattice parameter of 8.504 Å (8.52 Å in the experiment) (45) and the magnetic moment of 4.3 μB (4.2 μB in the experiment) (46) agree well with the experimental values. An antiferromagnetic spin arrangement (Figure S1) was found to correspond to the lowest energy, which is consistent with reported results. (47,48) The synthesized ZnFe2O4 catalyst was imaged via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). (49,50) The HAADF–STEM image (Figure 1) revealed that in perpendicular sections, the two in-plane directions are [11̅0] and [001], which indicate that the sample was inspected from the [110] direction. The STEM result also shows that the (110) surface is preferentially exposed in this ZnFe2O4 catalyst.
Figure 1
Figure 1. HAADF–STEM image of the ZnFe2O4 sample marked with lattice fringes and corresponding fast Fourier transformation patterns (inset).
Based on the STEM images, we chose a seven-layer (1 × 2) (110) surface to model the ZnFe2O4 catalyst, in which the antiferromagnetic spin arrangement was optimized (Figure S2). Along the [110] direction, the atoms are stacked by the repeated sequence of [−Zn4Fe4O8–Fe4O8−]. A seven-layer slab insures a sufficient convergence of the energy with thickness. To explore the stability of surfaces under O-poor to O-rich conditions, various terminations including Fe4O7, Fe4O8, Zn4Fe4O8, O, and O2 were considered (Figures 2 and S3). Each termination is indicated by its composition. In the case of the O termination, the outermost layer is composed of one oxygen atom which bonds to two Fe atoms in the second layer composed of Zn4Fe4O8. The Fe–O bond length is 1.82 Å. The outermost layer of the (110)-O2 surface is composed of two oxygen atoms. This represents a significant excess of O on the surface (coverage of two O for 1.02 nm2 of the surface, i.e., for four surface Fe). Higher O coverage situations such as (110)-O3 and (110)-O4 were calculated to be less stable than the (110)-O and (110)-O2 surfaces at ΔμO < 0 (for the stability diagram, see Figure S4). The O-poor Fe4O7 termination is obtained by removing an oxygen atom which is surrounded by three Fe atoms from the Fe4O8 termination. Chemical potentials of Zn, Fe, and O atoms are limited by constraints to maintain the bulk stability. ΔμZn, ΔμFe, and ΔμO are constrained by the formation enthalpy of bulk ZnFe2O4 (see S1). To avoid the metal precipitation, lattice oxygen releasing into the environment, or the formation of binary oxides (i.e., Fe2O3 or ZnO), ΔμZn, ΔμFe, and ΔμO should also satisfy the conditions listed in S1. Based on DFT-calculated surface energies, only the (110)-Zn4Fe4O8, (110)-O, and (110)-O2 surfaces were found to be stable under the range of chemical potentials where the ZnFe2O4 bulk is stable (Figure 2). Specifically, the (110)-O2 surface is stable when ΔμO > −0.08 eV (at low temperature and high O2 pressure). The (110)-O surface is preferred under oxygen-rich conditions, and the (110)-Zn4Fe4O8 surface is more stable under oxygen-poor conditions. The phase transition between the (110)-O surface and the (110)-Zn4Fe4O8 surface takes place at ΔμO = −0.72 eV. Under reaction conditions in the absence of steam (Figure 3), ΔμO ≤ −0.76 eV, and therefore, we can expect that the (110)-O surface tends to lose the outermost bicoordinated O2– and transform to the (110)-Zn4Fe4O8 surface.

(a) Surface stability diagram as a function of O and Fe chemical potentials and (b) corresponding structures of stable terminations for the ZnFe2O4(110) surface (iron atoms shown as golden balls, zinc atoms as silver balls, and oxygen atoms as red balls). The colored region in (a) corresponds to the stability zone of bulk ZnFe2O4.

All iron atoms in the (110)-O slab are Fe3+ (a formula of Zn16Fe(III)28O58), while as the (110)-O surface loses the outermost O atoms, four Fe3+ (two on each surface) will be reduced to surface Fe2+, resulting in the formula Zn16Fe(III)24Fe(II)4O56. XPS was used to characterize the oxidation state of Fe on the ZnFe2O4 surface. The fitted peak at 54.5 eV (Fe 3p) is ascribed to Fe2+ ions. (51) The XPS observations confirm that no obvious Fe2+ is present in the as-prepared ZnFe2O4 catalyst, demonstrating that the outermost O atoms are stable under room temperature and high vacuum (1 × 10–9 Torr, test chamber pressure). However, a peak representing Fe2+ species (Fe2+/Fe3+ = 0.3) was clearly observed for the ZnFe2O4 sample which was treated at 653 K for 2 h under vacuum (Figure 4b), indicating partial reduction of the surface. Considering that the attenuation lengths are about 1–10 monolayers for the emission angles normal to the surface (52) and only half amount of surface Fe3+ is expected to be reduced to surface Fe2+ at 653 K, the XPS results are in line with theoretical analysis. FTIR using CO as a probe molecule was also applied to identify the surface properties of ZnFe2O4 by measuring the vibrational frequency of adsorbed CO. (3,53) The frequency and intensity of the CO stretch vibration are extremely sensitive to the oxidation state and electronic environments of surface Fe cations. As shown in Figure 5, only the Fe3+-related CO vibrations at 2152 and 2103 cm–1 were observed for the as-prepared ZnFe2O4 surface. In comparison, new intense Fe2+-related CO bands at 2210, 2109, 2098, 2074, and 2064 cm–1 were detected for the sample which was treated at 653 K under vacuum; meanwhile, the characteristic band at 2152 cm–1 for the Fe3+ site was also observed. The stronger binding of CO to Fe2+ can be attributed to the enhanced electron back donation to the CO 2π* antibonding orbital. Interestingly, it seems that the Fe2+-related CO band positions are sensitive to the desorption temperature and shift from 2109 and 2098 cm–1 observed at 223 K to 2074 and 2064 cm–1 observed at 233 K, respectively, which was possibly caused by the configuration change of the absorbed CO. (54) The results of both the XPS and FTIR analyses confirmed that a fraction of surface Fe3+ will be reduced to Fe2+ at 653 K, indicating that the outermost O atoms are unstable at high temperature. The reduced ZnFe2O4 surface was found to be inactive in the 1-butene ODH reaction by us and others. (7,55) The conversion of 1-butene decreased to nearly 0% when active surface oxygen was consumed (Figure S5).

Dissociative Water Adsorptions on the ZnFe2O4(110) Surfaces
Water adsorption on ZnFe2O4 was investigated by Tabari et al., (30) and they suggest that the initial water adsorption was dissociative adsorption. To gain a deep understanding of the interaction between H2O and the ZnFe2O4 surface, DFT calculations were performed to study the adsorption sites of H2O on the ZnFe2O4(110)–O and (110)-Zn4Fe4O8 surface terminations in this paper. H2O adsorption is considered on one side of the exposed surfaces of the slab. For each H2O molecule adsorbed, both molecular and dissociative adsorptions are computed. The results showed that the first five H2O molecule adsorptions on the (110)-O surface and the first three H2O molecule adsorptions on the (110)-Zn4Fe4O8 surface are dissociative adsorptions (structures are shown in Table S1). This corresponds to maximum OH coverages of 9.8 and 5.9 per nm2 on (110)-O and (110)-Zn4Fe4O8, respectively. Further H2O adsorptions are not considered here because they are not stable on the surfaces under elevated temperature. Each H2O dissociation leads to two hydroxyls on the surface. Regarding the origin of OH, we denote the surface-derived hydroxyl as OsH and the water-derived hydroxyl as OwH.
On the (110)-O surface, each oxygen atom of OwH derived from the first to the third H2O molecule bonds to two Fe atoms in the Zn4Fe4O8 layer, on a bridge site, and the Fe–O bond lengths are in the range of 1.99–2.03 Å. Each oxygen atom of OwH derived from the fourth and fifth H2O molecules bonds to a Zn atom in the Zn4Fe4O8 layer, and the Zn–O bond lengths are in the range of 2.00–2.02 Å. For the first H2O molecule adsorption, the dissociated H binds to the outermost bicoordinated O atom, forming an OsH group. The H atoms dissociated from the second to the fifth H2O molecule move to the adjacent O atoms in the Zn4Fe4O8 layer. The stepwise adsorption energies of one to five H2O molecules are −2.33, −1.24, −1.13, −0.99, and −0.75 eV, respectively. The surface energies revealed that five-H2O adsorption is preferred at low temperature (400 K, 1 bar), while one-H2O adsorption is the most stable situation under the 1-butene ODH reaction temperature (Figure 6).
Figure 6
Figure 6. (a) Stability diagram for the surface as a function of temperature and water pressure, considering the (110)-O and (110)-Zn4Fe4O8 terminations with a variable number of water molecules. The most stable termination is indicated in the diagram as a function of conditions. The diagram assumes P(O2) = 0.047 P°. The star represents the 1-butene ODH reaction conditions, 653 K and P(H2O) = 0.71 Po; (b) structure of the (110)-O-1H2O surface.
On the (110)-Zn4Fe4O8 surface, each oxygen atom of OwH derived from the first to the third H2O molecule bonds to two Fe atoms in the Zn4Fe4O8 layer, and the Fe–O bond lengths are in the range of 2.00–2.08 Å. The H atoms from H2O molecules move to the adjacent O atoms in the Zn4Fe4O8 layer. The stepwise adsorption energies of one to three H2O molecules are −0.80, −1.14, and −0.88 eV, respectively. Hence, the (110)-Zn4Fe4O8 surface is not hydroxylated under 1-butene ODH reaction conditions (Figure S6).
To identify the nature of the catalyst surface under reaction conditions (653 K, O2: 0.047 Po, H2O: 0.71 Po), we further determined the most stable termination of the surface in the presence of a water pressure by comparing surface energies for the (110)-O and (110)-Zn4Fe4O8 terminations with a variable number of water molecules chemisorbed and fixing P(O2) = 0.047 P°. As depicted in Figure 6, at high temperature, the (110)-O surface tends to lose the outermost O atom at low water pressure, forming (110)-Zn4Fe4O8 with partial Fe reduction, while at a higher water pressure, the hydroxylated (110)-O termination is the most stable one (structure (110)-O–1H2O). Therefore, this surface oxygen is stabilized by H2O dissociative adsorption, highlighting the critical role of H2O in stabilizing Fe3+ under reaction conditions. The surface stability as a function of temperature and oxygen pressure is shown in Figure S7 [fixing P(H2O) = 0.71 P°]. The surface stability is not sensitive to P(O2) at low temperature, while at a higher temperature (>700 K), a high pressure of O2 stabilizes the hydroxylated ZnFe2O4(110)-O–1H2O termination.
ZnFe2O4-Catalyzed 1-Butene ODH: Influence of Steam
The effect of steam on the performance of the ZnFe2O4 catalyst (surface area: 18.4 m2/g) is shown in Figure 7. For example, at O2/1-butene = 0.8 (mol/mol), the introduction of steam markedly increased the conversion from 38 to 80% and raised the selectivity from 75 to 94%, in which the main byproducts are CO2 and CO.
Figure 7
Figure 7. Catalytic performance as a function of H2O/1-butene ratio over ZnFe2O4. Reaction conditions: 1.0 g of the catalyst, 653 K, 0.1 MPa, 1-butene/air = 1:3.8 (or 4.465), 1-butene GHSV = 400 h–1.
Figure 8 shows the changes of conversion and selectivity for butadiene with increasing reaction temperature over ZnFe2O4 in the presence of steam (based on single catalyst loading, without regeneration requirement). It can be seen that almost 100% of butadiene selectivities were obtained at low 1-butene conversions (<0.2%) and low temperatures (403–473 K, the 1-butene conversion was 0.03% at 403 K). The COx selectivity increased to 6% when the temperature was raised to 483 K; meanwhile, the 1-butene conversion was still very low (0.4%). A substantial increase in conversion and a slight change in butadiene selectivity were observed when the temperature was increased from 483 to 653 K.

In order to validate the DFT calculations and the proposed surface models, we also examined the physical adsorption of 1-butene on the catalyst pretreated by an O2–steam mixture at 653 K. After equilibrating the surface with 1-butene molecules, a stepwise thermal desorption was performed to monitor the desorption as a function of temperature. The results are shown in Figure S8, which shows the amounts of 1-butene desorption at each temperature. It should be noted that butadiene was detected in the desorption C4 flow (6–12 vol % at 300–400 K), indicating that the surface is already active for ODH at these temperatures. DFT calculations for 1-butene adsorption on the (110)-O–1H2O surface show that the C═C bond in 1-butene is adsorbed at the Zn atom with an adsorption energy of −0.93 eV. The adsorption Gibbs free energies have been calculated [at P(1-butene) = 10 Pa, measured by gas chromatography], and ΔGads is negative at 300 K and becomes positive at 400 K (Figure S8). The change of sign of ΔGads agrees very well with experimental results. Assuming a first-order desorption process with a constant prefactor, the activation energy of desorption for 1-butene on the (110)-O–1H2O surface is calculated to be 0.99 eV applying the Redhead equation (56)
(3)
where R is the Boltzmann constant, ν is the frequency factor (1013 s–1), Tp is the desorption peak maximum (350 K), and β is the heating rate (0.5 K/s). This result agrees with the DFT calculation which gives a desorption energy of 0.93 eV (Figure S10).
ZnFe2O4-Catalyzed 1-Butene ODH: Reaction Pathways
DFT calculations were performed to investigate the 1-butene ODH reaction mechanism. In order to highlight the effect of steam, we calculated and compared reaction pathways on a bare (110)-O surface and on a hydroxyl-precovered surface. In addition, the possible initial step of deep oxidation to form COx was investigated to understand the selectivity.
The calculated Gibbs-free-energy profiles at 650 K for 1-butene ODH on the (110)-O–1H2O surface are shown in Figure 9 (assuming a 1-butene conversion of 5%, O2: 0.045 Po, H2O: 0.72 Po, 1-butene: 0.057 Po, butadiene: 0.003 Po; corresponding structures are shown in Figures 9 and S9). The first C–H bond breaking occurs at the allylic position. (57) The allylic hydrogen atom is abstracted by a Fe–OH–Fe hydroxyl site to form an adsorbed molecular water through a transition state TS1 (the spin density of TS1 is shown in Figure S11). A surface Fe3+ ion is reduced to Fe2+ in this process as seen with its magnetic moments. (41) The energy barrier of the first H rupture is 1.17 eV. Subsequently, the terminal carbon (by the resonance effect) of the resulting C4H7 group binds to a surface oxygen site (IM1). After the desorption of water, the second H is abstracted by another hydroxyl group to form adsorbed water and butadiene molecules, accompanied by the reduction of another Fe3+ ion in the −Fe–OH structure. After the desorption of water and the butadiene molecule, two surface Fe2+ are reoxidized by gaseous O2 to form a superoxide (−Fe–O–O–Fe−) structure. Two successive H ruptures in another 1-butene molecule produce the second butadiene. The first C–H activation to form a C4H7* and a surface hydroperoxide structure is activated by a superoxide site with an energy barrier of 0.34 eV, which is lower than the energy barriers of H ruptures by the Fe–OH–Fe sites. The second H rupture on the newly generated hydroperoxide produces butadiene and water, which subsequently dissociatively adsorbs on the catalyst surface. The superoxide structure is predicted to be not thermodynamically stable at high temperature, and we speculate that this is the reason for the gradual decrease of catalytic activity as the reaction temperature is increased above 653 K (Figure 8). The calculated results illustrated that the rate-determining step in the reaction is the first C–H activation step, and the reaction barrier is 1.17 eV. The experimental measured apparent activation energy is 1.43 eV (Figure 10), which confirms the experimental necessity for high operating temperatures.

Pure butadiene gave conversions of 0.2–0.3% and almost 100% selectivity to COx when it was used as a reactant (1.0 g of the catalyst, 0.1 MPa, 653 K, butadiene/air/steam = 1:3.8:12, butadiene GHSV = 400 h–1), demonstrating that COx was mainly produced by the deep oxidation of 1-butene in 1-butene ODH. The adsorbed 1-hydroperoxybut-2-ene (IM′1, more stable than the adsorbed 3-hydroperoxybut-1-ene isomer), a possible intermediate of COx formation, can be generated via the following paths: (1) the reaction of 1-butene with superoxide in which the C4H7 group binds to an oxygen in the −Fe–O–O–Fe– site (Figure 11) and (2) the migration of C4H7* in IM3 to an oxygen in the −OOH site with an energy barrier of 1.25 eV (for the transition-state structure, see Figure S12). The calculated results show that the pathway for butadiene is more competitive. Therefore, butadiene is obtained as the main product, but the formation of 1-hydroperoxybut-2-ene appears as a selectivity-limiting side reaction.

A higher O2:1-butene ratio is expected to increase the coverage of the superoxide site, keep the surface oxidized, and facilitate the formation of the surface OH group (Figure S7). Therefore, as shown in Figure 7, a small increase in O2:1-butene ratio (from 0.8 to 0.94) increased the conversion and slightly reduced the steam requirement and the butadiene selectivity.
As shown in Figure 12, in the absence of steam, the butadiene selectivities were near 100% at relatively low temperatures (403–483 K; the 1-butene conversion was 0.2% at 403 K) and decreased to 70–80% when the temperature was above 493 K. The maximum 1-butene conversion was obtained at 623 K.

We conducted 1-butene ODH calculations on the (110)-O surface to study the reaction mechanism in the absence of steam (assuming a 1-butene conversion of 5%, 1-butene: 0.057 Po, O2: 0.045 Po, H2O: 0.003 Po, butadiene: 0.003 Po, Figure 13). On the (110)-O surface, the first hydrogen atom is abstracted by the bicoordinated O to form a hydroxyl group with an energy barrier of 0.25 eV. The second H is abstracted by the newly generated hydroxyl group to form water and butadiene molecules; the high activation barrier results from the strong adsorption of C4H7* on the surface oxygen. The subsequent reoxidation of surface Fe2+ and C–H activation steps are similar to the surface re-oxidation and C-H activation processes on the (110)-O–1H2O surface. The effective free-energy barrier (energetic span (58)) is controlled by the second part of the reaction and the formation and reaction steps on the surface superoxide. It amounts to 1.4 eV, which is slightly lower than the effective free-energy barrier on the (110)-O–1H2O surface (1.58 eV). However, as mentioned above, only a low coverage of bicoordinated O is expected to exist on the surface because of its low stability at high reaction temperature, resulting in a relatively low 1-butene conversion. It is speculated that the coverage of bicoordinated O would reach a dynamic equilibrium on the surface when a steady flow of O2 is introduced into the 1-butene ODH reaction. Therefore, the catalytic performance of ZnFe2O4 in the 1-butene ODH reaction in the absence of steam is stable under 653 K and 0.1 MPa (Figure 13).

The red color illustrates the butadiene channel, and the blue color illustrates the initial step of the COx channel. g stands for gas-phase species, and ads stands for adsorbed species. All the energies are in electronvolts. The key structures of transition states and intermediates have been shown in the diagram.
There is no obvious COx formation in the absence of gaseous O2 (Figure S5). The reaction begins to produce COx at similar temperatures (483–493 K) under both reaction conditions with or without steam. These results suggest that COx is formed following the same mechanism on the (110)-O and (110)-O–1H2O surfaces. The superoxide structure acts as an active site for deep oxidation. As mentioned above, the binding of C4H7* to the −O–O– site yields a possible intermediate of deep oxidation. However, as can be seen, more COx was formed on the (110)-O surface. This can be explained by the concentrations of the C4H7* intermediates on the considered surfaces. On the (110)-O–1H2O surface, the first C–H activation of the first 1-butene is the rate-determining step. The second H rupture of the first 1-butene is faster than the first H abstraction which generates C4H7* on the surface (IM1, Figure 9). Therefore, a low concentration of C4H7* is expected to remain on the surface. On the other hand, on the (110)-O surface, the second H rupture of the first 1-butene is slower than the first H abstraction, resulting in a higher concentration of C4H7* intermediates on the surface and hence a higher probability to react with superoxide species to form COx.
The simulation results depicted in Figure 6 also indicate that at 900 K, H2O tends to desorb from the (110)-O–1H2O surface at a high water pressure [P(H2O) = 0.71 Po], implying that steam will not play a significant role in the 1-butene ODH reaction under such conditions. The results agree with experiments where only a slight promotion effect of steam was observed: the 1-butene conversion was increased from 38 to 46%, and the butadiene selectivity was increased from 66 to 74% at 900 K.

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In this work, a combination of experimental results and DFT analyses over ZnFe2O4-catalyzed 1-butene ODH reactions revealed the key role of steam on the stabilization of the active O species at high temperature and on the catalytic activity. The ZnFe2O4(110)–O surface tends to lose the bicoordinated oxygen (Fe–O–Fe) at high reaction temperatures, resulting in the reduction of Fe3+ ions in the surface, which was confirmed by both XPS and CO-FTIR analyses, and loss of activity. H2O interacts strongly with the ZnFe2O4(110)–O surface, leading to the formation of hydroxyl groups, a structure which is thermodynamically stable at the reaction temperature of 1-butene ODH. 1-Butene ODH reactions on the ZnFe2O4(110)–O and ZnFe2O4(110)–O–1H2O surfaces were systematically investigated using both experimental and theoretical approaches to establish the structure–activity relationships. The good agreement between 1-butene adsorption energy on the site and the measured value from 1-butene temperature-programmed desorption validates the structure of the site obtained by calculations on the (110) surface. The surface OH groups and the surface O species are both active sites for C–H bond breakage, and their regeneration goes through the formation of a surface superoxide species, which is active for both butene dehydrogenation and deep oxidation, restoring the initial site. However, the surface O species is not stable at the high temperature required to obtain a reasonable rate for the reaction. This explains the low activity under dehydrated conditions. In the presence of steam, the double-hydroxyl structure formed by chemisorption of one water molecule on each surface O species is calculated by first-principles thermodynamics to be stable until 900 K at a water pressure of 0.71 Po. This explains the high conversion found at the temperature of 653 K when using steam. The reaction pathway in the presence of steam also provides a smaller loss of selectivity by the unwanted deep oxidation because a low concentration of the C4H7 intermediate is expected to remain on the surface. If the temperature is increased to 900 K, water chemisorption cannot stabilize the O surface species anymore, and the measured influence of steam becomes insignificant.
Therefore, the newly proposed mechanism reveals a major role of steam in the 1-butene ODH reaction on Zn ferrite catalysts. Water stabilizes the active O site, even if it slightly reduces its reactivity for C–H bond activation. This influence of steam in the 1-butene ODH reaction has not been observed experimentally or predicted theoretically so far to our knowledge. O species in oxide are important active sites for ODH reactions, which can be unstable by reduction at the high temperature at which the reaction is performed. The results obtained here could be generalized to propose an important role of water in stabilizing the surface O species in the form of highly stable hydroxyl species. Hence, we assume that our results will help to understand the role of steam and hydroxylation in similar ODH reactions.
