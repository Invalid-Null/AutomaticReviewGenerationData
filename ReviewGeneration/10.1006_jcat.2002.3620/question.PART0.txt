I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

The Relationship between the Electronic and Redox Properties of Dispersed Metal Oxides and Their Turnover Rates in Oxidative Dehydrogenation Reactions
Abstract
The mechanistic connections among propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) rates, H2 reduction rates, and the electronic transitions responsible for the absorption edge in the electronic spectra of dispersed metal oxides were explored for VOx, MoOx, WOx, and NbOx samples consisting predominately of two-dimensional oxide domains supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, and MgO. For a given active oxide, propane turnover rates increased in parallel with the reduction rate of the oxide catalyst using H2, but propane ODH rates differed significantly among different metal oxide samples with similar H2 reduction rates. For all catalysts, ODH turnover rates increased monotonically as the energy of the absorption edge in the UVvisible spectrum decreased. These results, taken together with the respective mechanisms for electron transfer during CH bond activation and during the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer processes responsible for the UVvisible edge, suggest that the stability of activated complexes in CH bond dissociation steps depends sensitively on the ability of the active oxide domains to transfer electrons from lattice oxygen atoms to metal centers. The electronic transitions responsible for the UVvisible absorption edge are mechanistically related to the redox cycles involving lattice oxygens responsible for oxidative dehydrogenation turnovers of alkanes. As a result, the details of near-edge electronic spectra provide useful guidance about intrinsic reaction rates on active oxides typically used for these reactions.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
