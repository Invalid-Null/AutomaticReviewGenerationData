<Answer>

 Unfortunately the given literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the specific questions about propane dehydrogenation mechanisms, kinetics, computational studies, catalyst descriptors, or structure-activity relationships. The literature focuses on techno-economic analysis of a hybrid process for propylene and ammonia production, and does not provide details on the fundamentals of propane dehydrogenation catalysis.
