<Answer>

 Unfortunately, the given literature does not contain relevant information to answer any of the questions. The article focuses on process design and techno-economic analysis of a hybrid process for propylene and ammonia production. It does not discuss process intensification, safety issues, computational methods, characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation specifically.

<Answer>
 Unfortunately after carefully reviewing the literature, I could not find any relevant quotes or information to directly address the questions asked. The article is focused on presenting a techno-economic analysis of a hybrid process for propylene and ammonia production, and does not discuss propane dehydrogenation process intensification approaches, safety issues, remaining challenges, high-throughput methods for catalyst screening, or new catalyst architectures. As such, I cannot provide substantive quotes or answers to the specific questions posed. The literature appears mismatched to the questions. Please provide literature more relevant to the topic of propane dehydrogenation research directions, and I will try my best to extract relevant quotes and provide thorough answers.
