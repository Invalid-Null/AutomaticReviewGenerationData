 Unfortunately the provided answers do not contain relevant information to address the questions asked. As the answers indicate, the literature does not evaluate specific metal oxide or supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, investigate how catalytic properties affect performance, or propose mechanistic pathways. 

Since the answers are not relevant to the questions, I will stop my review and respond with:
