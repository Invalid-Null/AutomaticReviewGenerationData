 Unfortunately after carefully reviewing the literature, I could not find any relevant quotes or information to directly address the questions asked. The article is focused on presenting a techno-economic analysis of a hybrid process for propylene and ammonia production, and does not discuss propane dehydrogenation process intensification approaches, safety issues, remaining challenges, high-throughput methods for catalyst screening, or new catalyst architectures. As such, I cannot provide substantive quotes or answers to the specific questions posed. The literature appears mismatched to the questions. Please provide literature more relevant to the topic of propane dehydrogenation research directions, and I will try my best to extract relevant quotes and provide thorough answers.
