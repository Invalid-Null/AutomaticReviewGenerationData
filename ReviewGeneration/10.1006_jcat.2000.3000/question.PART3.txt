I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Reactions of Propane on Supported Mo2C Catalysts
Abstract
The adsorption and reactions of propane over Mo2C deposited on ZSM-5 and SiO2 have been investigated. Propane adsorbed weakly and nondissociatively on Mo2C catalyst at 150273 K. At higher temperatures, the characteristic vibrations of π-bonded and di-σ-bonded propylene and propylidyne were identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The dominant reaction of propane over Mo2C/SiO2 at 773873 K is its dehydrogenation into propylene. At 873 K the selectivity of propylene formation attained a value of 3550% at a conversion of 3525%. The reaction pathway of propane was completely different on Mo2C/ZSM-5: in this case the aromatization of propane was the main process. It was shown that Mo2C improved the effect of pure ZSM-5 in this reaction. The positive influence of Mo2C is explained by its high activity toward the dehydrogenation of propane. The effect of Mo2C was also examined on the aromatization of propylene occurring on the acidic sites of ZSM-5, and no inhibition was observed.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
