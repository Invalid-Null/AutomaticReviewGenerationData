[1] "Good dispersion of Cr species was obtained through this special procedure of preparation, and its difference from the traditional impregnation method was also examined."

[2] "To our surprise, the reused Cr adsorbent sample displayed a good dispersion of Cr species, while poor Cr dispersion over Cr/MCM-41 synthesized by the traditional impregnation method is observed, as presented in Figure S2 in SI." 

[3] "From Figure S3, different anchoring sites for the stabilization of Cr species are exhibited, on which anionic chrome oxo species (Cr2O72) are anchored to the support by the positively charged ammonium groups (from template agent CTAB) through electrostatic interaction, while the anchoring sites of Cr/MCM-41 from the impregnation method are surface hydroxyl groups."

[4] "In general, good dispersion of the active sites on the catalyst is expected to convey good catalytic performance in heterogeneous catalysis."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses obtaining good dispersion of Cr species through a special column adsorption procedure, in contrast to poor dispersion from traditional impregnation. The article explains this is due to different anchoring sites - the adsorption method anchors Cr species via electrostatic interactions with ammonium groups, while impregnation anchors them to surface hydroxyls. It states good dispersion of active sites is expected to improve catalytic performance.

回答:是的,该文研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它讨论了通过一种特殊的柱式吸附法获得良好的Cr稀释,而传统浸渍法获得较差的分散。该文解释这是由于不同的锚定位点——吸附法通过与铵盐群的静电作用锚定Cr种类,而浸渍法将它们锚定在表面羟基上。它指出良好的活性位点分散有望改善催化性能。
