<quotes>
[1] "Moreover, the investigation of the effect of additional impurity ions is considered to be applicable for real Cr adsorbents."  
[2] "In fact, waste Cr adsorbents were recycled by calcination and reused as Cr/MCM-41 catalyst to eliminate methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), a typical compound of sulfur-containing VOCs, (11,12) as shown in our recent study, (10) which indicates a new avenue of green chemistry and has important implications for environmental protection."
[3] "Good dispersion of Cr species was obtained through this special procedure of preparation, and its difference from the traditional impregnation method was also examined."

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like column adsorption of Cr onto a silica support, followed by calcination to generate Cr/MCM-41 catalysts. This is compared to traditional impregnation methods, and is shown to give better Cr species dispersion.
