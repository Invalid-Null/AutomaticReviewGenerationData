[1] "Surprisingly, the reused Cr adsorbent sample displayed a good dispersion of Cr species, while poor Cr dispersion over Cr/MCM-41 synthesized by the traditional impregnation method is observed, as presented in Figure S2 in SI."

[2] "Different anchoring sites for the stabilization of Cr species are exhibited, on which anionic chrome oxo species (Cr2O72-) are anchored to the support by the positively charged ammonium groups (from template agent CTAB) through electrostatic interaction, while the anchoring sites of Cr/MCM-41 from the impregnation method are surface hydroxyl groups." 

[3] "From this point of view, the normal impregnation onto MCM-41 forms poorly agglomerated catalysts, and this seems to be expected based on the anionic nature of the chromium oxide species (CrO42-) and the negative charge on the surface hydroxyls."
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses the preparation of reused Cr adsorbents, which displayed good Cr dispersion compared to Cr/MCM-41 synthesized by traditional impregnation. The Cr species are anchored to the support through electrostatic interactions with positively charged template groups, while impregnation anchors Cr to surface hydroxyls and leads to poor dispersion.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章研究了优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。文中讨论了再利用的铬吸附剂的制备,与传统浸渍法合成的Cr/MCM-41相比,该吸附剂呈现良好的铬分散。铬物种通过与正电荷模板组的静电相互作用固定在载体上,而浸渍法将铬固定在表面羟基上,导致分散性较差。

[1] "An investigation of Cr 2p XP spectra in Figure 3 and Figure S6B indicates the existence of both Cr(VI) and Cr(III) states in the reused Cr adsorbent samples."

[2] "Peak fitting of the Cr 2p binding energy (BE) region for the tested samples (Figure 3) reveals that a higher relative percent of Cr(VI), about 52%, is present on the reused Cr adsorbent sample with exposure to additional impurity anions, while lower relative percents of Cr(VI), at about 40% and 30%, are respectively calculated from the not-exposed and cation-exposed samples."

[3] "The UVvis spectra of the tested adsorbents are compared in Figure 4B. It is observed that the intense peak centered at about 360 nm, which expresses OCr(VI) charge transfer transitions of Cr(VI) species, is more pronounced on the reused Cr adsorbent sample synthesis from streams containing competing anions, while the other two bands at about 460 and 600 nm, which are characteristic for octahedral Cr(III) in CrOx clusters and the presence of crystalline Cr2O3, are found for the samples not-exposed and cation-exposed."

[4] "Thus, the UVvis analysis is in line with the XPS data, suggesting the presence of Cr(VI) species on the reused Cr adsorbent sample synthesis from streams containing competing anions."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe oxidation state changes of Cr species during catalyst preparation. It shows that Cr(VI) and Cr(III) are present in all samples, but exposure to anions during preparation leads to higher Cr(VI) content compared to unexposed samples, as confirmed by both XPS and UV-vis spectroscopy. 
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
答:是的,文章使用X射线光电子能谱法(XPS)来探究催化剂制备过程中铬物种的氧化态变化。结果表明,所有样品中都存在Cr(VI)和Cr(III),但制备过程中暴露于阴离子导致比未暴露样本Cr(VI)含量更高,这一点由XPS和紫外可见光谱法证实。

[1] "Moreover, the investigation of the effect of additional impurity ions is considered to be applicable for real Cr adsorbents."  
[2] "In fact, waste Cr adsorbents were recycled by calcination and reused as Cr/MCM-41 catalyst to eliminate methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), a typical compound of sulfur-containing VOCs, (11,12) as shown in our recent study, (10) which indicates a new avenue of green chemistry and has important implications for environmental protection."
[3] "Good dispersion of Cr species was obtained through this special procedure of preparation, and its difference from the traditional impregnation method was also examined."

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like column adsorption of Cr onto a silica support, followed by calcination to generate Cr/MCM-41 catalysts.

Answer: Yes, the article uses XPS to probe the oxidation states of Cr species in the reused Cr adsorbents. Peak fitting of the Cr 2p spectra reveals the relative percentages of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species in the samples exposed to different impurities during preparation. For example, the sample exposed to anionic impurities showed a higher percentage of Cr(VI) compared to the non-exposed and cation-exposed samples. UV-vis spectroscopy also confirmed the presence of more Cr(VI) species in the anion-exposed sample.

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses obtaining good dispersion of Cr species through a special column adsorption procedure, in contrast to poor dispersion from traditional impregnation. The article explains this is due to different anchoring sites - the adsorption method anchors Cr species via electrostatic interactions with ammonium groups, while impregnation anchors them to surface hydroxyls. It states good dispersion of active sites is expected to improve catalytic performance.
