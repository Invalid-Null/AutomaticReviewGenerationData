[1] "Good dispersion of Cr species was obtained through this special procedure of preparation, and its difference from the traditional impregnation method was also examined."

[2] "Figure 1. SEM/mapping images of the reused Cr adsorbent."  

[3] "From Figure S3, different anchoring sites for the stabilization of Cr species are exhibited, on which anionic chrome oxo species (Cr2O72) are anchored to the support by the positively charged ammonium groups (from template agent CTAB) through electrostatic interaction, while the anchoring sites of Cr/MCM-41 from the impregnation method are surface hydroxyl groups."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses a special procedure involving adsorption of Cr species onto a silica support followed by calcination, which results in better Cr dispersion compared to traditional impregnation methods, as evidenced by SEM/mapping images showing a good dispersion of Cr species. The different anchoring mechanisms of the Cr species in the two methods are examined.

答:是的,这篇文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它讨论了一种特殊的程序,先将Cr种吸附在硅藻土支持体上,然后煅烧,与传统的浸渍法相比,这种方法可以获得更好的Cr分散,SEM/mapping图像显示Cr种有良好的分散,证实了这一点。文章检查了两种方法中Cr种的不同锚定机制。

[1] "An investigation of Cr 2p XP spectra in Figure 3 and Figure S6B indicates the existence of both Cr(VI) and Cr(III) states in the reused Cr adsorbent samples."

[2] "Figure 3. Cr 2p XP spectra of the reused Cr adsorbents."

[3] "Surprisingly, peak fitting of the Cr 2p binding energy (BE) region for the tested samples (Figure 3) reveals that a higher relative percent of Cr(VI), about 52%, is present on the reused Cr adsorbent sample with exposure to additional impurity anions, while lower relative percents of Cr(VI), at about 40% and 30%, are respectively calculated from the not-exposed and cation-exposed samples."

[4] "The UVvis spectra of the tested adsorbents are compared in Figure 4B. It is observed that the intense peak centered at about 360 nm, which expresses OCr(VI) charge transfer transitions of Cr(VI) species, is more pronounced on the reused Cr adsorbent sample synthesis from streams containing competing anions, while the other two bands at about 460 and 600 nm, which are characteristic for octahedral Cr(III) in CrOx clusters and the presence of crystalline Cr2O3, are found for the samples not-exposed and cation-exposed." 

[5] "Thus, the UVvis analysis is in line with the XPS data, suggesting the presence of Cr(VI) species on the reused Cr adsorbent sample synthesis from streams containing competing anions."

Answer: Yes, the article uses XPS to probe the oxidation states of Cr species in the reused Cr adsorbents. Peak fitting of the Cr 2p spectra reveals the relative percentages of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species in the samples exposed to different impurities during preparation. For example, the sample exposed to anionic impurities showed a higher percentage of Cr(VI) compared to the non-exposed and cation-exposed samples. UV-vis spectroscopy also confirmed the presence of more Cr(VI) species in the anion-exposed sample.

<Chinese version answer>  
答:是的,这篇文章使用X射线光电子能谱来探测再利用的Cr吸附剂中的Cr化合物的氧化态。Cr 2p谱的峰拟合揭示了在制备过程中接触不同杂质的样品中Cr(VI)和Cr(III)种的相对百分比。例如,接触阴离子杂质的样品显示出比未接触和接触阳离子的样品更高的Cr(VI)百分比。紫外-可见光谱也确认了阴离子接触样品中存在更多的Cr(VI)种。
