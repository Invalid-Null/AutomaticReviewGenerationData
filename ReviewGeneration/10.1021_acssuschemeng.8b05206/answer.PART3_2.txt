[1] "To our surprise, the sample of reused Cr adsorbent displays a good dispersion of Cr species, while poor Cr dispersion over Cr/MCM-41 synthesized by the traditional impregnation method is observed, as presented in Figure S2 in SI." 

[2] "An investigation of Cr 2p XP spectra in Figure 3 and Figure S6B indicates the existence of both Cr(VI) and Cr(III) states in the reused Cr adsorbent samples."

[3] "Catalytic evaluation for CH3SH abatement was reported in detail in our previous studies."

[4] "The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the tested adsorbent samples are shown in Figure 6A."

[5] "SEM maps and ICP measurements of the post-treatment materials were carried out."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It shows that the reused Cr adsorbent sample displayed good dispersion of Cr species, while poor dispersion was observed for Cr/MCM-41 synthesized by traditional impregnation. Characterization techniques like XPS, N2 adsorption-desorption, SEM/mapping, and ICP were used to study dispersion.

[1] "An investigation of Cr 2p XP spectra in Figure 3 and Figure S6B indicates the existence of both Cr(VI) and Cr(III) states in the reused Cr adsorbent samples."

[2] "Figure 3 illustrates catalytic activity for CH3SH abatement and PDH over the reused Cr adsorbents." 

[3] "Peak fitting of the Cr 2p binding energy (BE) region for the tested samples (Figure 3) reveals that a higher relative percent of Cr(VI), about 52%, is present on the reused Cr adsorbent sample with exposure to additional impurity anions, while lower relative percents of Cr(VI), at about 40% and 30%, are respectively calculated from the not-exposed and cation-exposed samples."

[4] "The UVvis spectra of the tested adsorbents are compared in Figure 4B. It is observed that the intense peak centered at about 360 nm, which expresses OCr(VI) charge transfer transitions of Cr(VI) species, is more pronounced on the reused Cr adsorbent sample synthesis from streams containing competing anions, while the other two bands at about 460 and 600 nm, which are characteristic for octahedral Cr(III) in CrOx clusters and the presence of crystalline Cr2O3, are found for the samples not-exposed and cation-exposed." 

[5] "The H2-TPR profiles in Figure 5 show that intense reduction peaks appear on the anion-exposed sample, which accounts for the reduction of Cr(VI) species; hence, it again suggests the presence of more Cr(VI) species."

Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe oxidation state changes of chromium during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows XPS fitting of Cr 2p spectra to quantify Cr(VI) and Cr(III) content in different catalyst samples. Other techniques like UV-vis, H2-TPR, and catalytic testing are used to corroborate the XPS results on chromium oxidation state changes.

答:是的,本文使用X射线光电子能谱技术(XPS)来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的铬的氧化态变化。该文展示了Cr 2p谱的XPS拟合结果,以量化不同催化剂样品中的Cr(VI)和Cr(III)含量。紫外可见光谱、H2-TPR和催化活性测试等其他技术被用来验证XPS结果中的铬氧化态变化。
