Promotion effect of sulfur impurity in alumina support on propane dehydrogenation
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095495622001176
AbstractAbstract
Alumina materials are widely applied either as a catalyst or support in various industrial catalytic processes. Impurities in alumina that are unfriendly to catalytic performance are inevitably present during the production processes. Facing this problem, we here report that the use of sulfur-containing alumina as the support can generate active alumina-supported platinum catalyst, which exhibits superior propylene selectivity and anti-coking ability during propane dehydrogenation. It demonstrated that the sulfur impurity in alumina is not entirely detrimental. During the reduction process, the formation of gas-phase sulfur species increased the electrons and poisoned unsaturated sites of platinum particles. The sulfur impurity in alumina can be removed through a hydrogen reduction process, and the degree of desulfurization is correlated with the operating temperature. This study demonstrated that the rational use of impurity will contribute to the design of a catalyst with high reactivity for potential applications.

1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important chemical feedstocks, most of which is currently produced by thermal or catalytic cracking of crude oil-derived naphtha that commonly involves enormous energy consumption and CO2 emission [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. As an alternative, propane dehydrogenation (PDH), using Pt-based catalyst, represents a more economical and environmentally friendly route to produce propylene [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. The recent increasing availability of worldwide shale gas has stimulated a quick technical shift to obtain commodity propylene from the gas-based dehydrogenation routes. With that in mind, it is of great significance and highly desirable to develop catalysts with high activity.
In general, catalyst support is crucial for catalytic performance, which plays a key factor in optimizing catalyst structure and reaction performance. Owing to the high surface area, good thermal stability, and strong mechanical strength as well as suitable acid-base surface property, γ-alumina is the most widely used support in heterogeneous catalysts [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The Al2O3-supported Pt-based catalysts have been commercialized by UOP in the 1990s. With regards to PDH process, alumina with high purity is the key for Pt-based catalysts. However, in fact, impurities are inevitably present in industrial alumina products originating from the raw materials and the production process, which lead to the complexity of the alumina structure that further affect the properties of the corresponding catalysts. To obtain high purity alumina, a series of complex subsequent treatment processes are required that cause economic loss and environmental pollution. This is against the principles of environmental friendliness and sustainability in the modern chemical industry. Thus, recognizing the effect of those impurities is necessary for rational fabrication of Al2O3 supported Pt-based catalysts. The silicon in alumina will generate strong acid that causes the formation of carbon deposits [18]. The iron impurity, a typical active species for crack reaction, will accelerate those undesired side reactions [19]. Those impurities are usually considered to be detrimental to the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation processes. Despite some efforts that have been devoted to exploring impurity on catalytic performance, which however remains poorly understood.
Sulfur species is another typical impurity in alumina materials, mainly from sulfate in raw materials. In the industrial PDH process, sulfur species in the gas state could effectively prevent the coke formation over the metal surface of the reactors as a nonspecific catalyst poison [20]. In addition, some studies have reported that sulfur species introduced into the reaction feed as non-reactant components could improve the performance of Pt catalysts by covering those side reaction sites on the Pt particles [21], [22], [23]. However, so far there lacks knowledge about sulfur impurities in alumina and their effect on catalyst performance. In this study, the commercial sulfur-containing alumina was studied, and the sulfur content was modulated through hydrogen reduction processes. The obtained alumina was used as a support for Pt catalyst to investigate the relationship between the sulfur impurity and catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. The presence of sulfur impurities in alumina significantly suppressed undesired byproducts and reduce the coke formation, which was attributed to the regulation of the active phase by gas-phase sulfur species that formed during the reduction process.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Pristine alumina was obtained from Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Shandong, China). The elemental analysis gives a sulfur impurity content of 1.53%, and the content of other impurities is less than 0.01% that is negligible, such as iron, silicon, etc. Chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6·6H2O) was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Propane gas (C3H8), Hydrogen gas (H2), Nitrogen gas (N2), Oxygen gas (O2), Argon gas (Ar), were supplied by Dalian Special Gas Co. Ltd.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
The sulfur-containing alumina was treated with hydrogen at different temperatures to modulate sulfur content, and the physicochemical parameters of all samples were listed in Table S1. The obtained samples were named as Al2O3-H2-T (where T represents the processing temperature of alumina). Alumina with different sulfur content supported platinum catalyst was synthesized by the incipient wetness co-impregnation method with H6PtCl6•6H2O as the precursors, in which the theoretical amount of Pt loaded was 0.5 wt%. After impregnation, the samples were maintained at room temperature for 2 h and then dried at 50 C for 12 h. This was followed by calcination in 20% O2/N2 at 500 C for 4 h and then reduced in 20% H2/N2 atmosphere at 590 C for 2 h, and the obtained catalysts were denoted as Pt-Al2O3-H2-T. For comparison, high-purity alumina that was obtained from the Sasol company (denoted as Al2O3-ref) was chosen for the preparation of the sulfur-containing alumina, which was prepared by introducing aluminum sulfate (denoted as Al2O3-ref-S) and the theoretical amount of sulfur was 1.5%. Preparation of reference catalysts using the same preparation procedure as for the Pt-Al2O3 catalyst, and the obtained catalysts were denoted as Pt-Al2O3-ref and Pt-Al2O3-ref-S respectively.
2.3. Catalytic evaluation
Catalytic performance was tested in a tubular fixed-bed quartz reactor (I.D. = 8 mm) at atmospheric pressure. The temperature of the reactor was controlled by a Yudian AI temperature controller (XMYE-8000). 100 mg of catalyst was used in each experiment. Before the reactivity test, the catalyst was heated to 590 C with a rate of 10 C/min in 20 vol% H2/N2 and retained at 590 C for 2 h. After the pretreatment, the reaction mixture of C3H8 (16 vol%) and H2 (20 vol%) in N2 was fed at a total flow of 50 mL min1. A reaction gas mixture with a certain volume ratio was passed through the catalyst bed at 590 C. The products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph. Alumina packed and molecular sieve 5A columns were used to analyze the N2, H2, C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, C2H6, and CH4 in the products. The propane conversion and selectivity of the products were calculated using the following equations and the carbon balance was generally higher than 95%.
where i represents hydrocarbon products in the effluent gas stream, ni is the number of carbon atoms of component i, and F(i) is the corresponding flow rate.
2.4. Catalyst characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were operated on a PANalytical X'Pert3 Powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The tube voltage was 40 kV, and the current was 40 mA. Nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms were obtained using a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 adsorption analyzer. Chemical analysis was carried out by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) in a Bruker S8 Pioneer X-ray spectrometer. The 27Al MAS NMR experiments were carried out at 130.2 MHz using a 4 mm MAS NMR probe with a spinning rate of 14 kHz. The spectra were accumulated for 120 scans with a 2 s recycle delay. The specific surface areas (SBET) were calculated from the adsorption data in the relative pressure range of 0.050.3 using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a JEOL JEM-F200, operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer (AlKa X-ray source). The binding energy was calibrated using C 1s photoelectron peak at 284.6 eV. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra were on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector and KBr windows. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra were recorded on a Bruker 70 V spectrometer with an in situ reaction cell (HARRICK) and MCT detector cooled by liquid nitrogen. Temperature programmed desorption of propylene (C3H6-TPD-MS) was carried out on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 apparatus, and the gas was monitored by on-line mass spectrometry (MS). The type and number of base and acid sites were determined by temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry (TPD-MS) of CO2 and NH3, respectively, using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 apparatus. The amount of coke deposited was determined by the combustion of the deposited material on a thermogravimetric (TG) analyzer STA 449 F3 (NETZSCH). Prior to combustion, the spent catalyst was pre-treated with flowing He (40 mL min1) at 200 C for 1 h, and then cooled to ambient temperature under He. Finally, the sample was exposed to a mixture of 20% O2 in N2 flowing at 20 mL min1 and oxidized from ambient temperature to 900 C at a heating rate of 10 C min1. The CO2 generated was monitored by on-line mass spectrometry (MS).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Identification of sulfur impurity
The elementary composition of alumina materials was confirmed by energy-dispersive Xray spectroscopy mapping (EDX-Mapping) under scanning electron microscopy mode. As shown in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. S1, sulfur species were uniformly present in the pristine alumina except for aluminum and oxygen. The temperature-programmed reduction measurements further determined the presence of sulfur impurities (Fig. 1b). During the reduction process, the signal of hydrogen sulfide (H2S, m/z = 34) appeared from 458 C and disappeared completely at high temperatures. With that in mind, the sulfur content in alumina materials could be regulated through reduction temperatures, where low-temperature treatment can partially desulfurization, high-temperature treatment can completely result in desulfurization. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements showed an obvious peak at 169.6 eV in the S 2p spectrum of the pristine commercial alumina, which was similar to that for aluminum sulfate [24]. The sulfur content in alumina materials decreased from 1.5 to 1.0 at% after the reduction treatment at 500 C for 30 min and the sulfur signal was almost undetectable at higher temperature treatment, which was consistent with the XRF and EDX-Mapping results (Fig. S2-S3 and Table S1).

3.2. Structural characterizations of alumina materials
To investigate the effect of sulfur removal on alumina properties, a series of characterization techniques were used. As shown in Fig. 2(a), all samples showed the main diffraction peaks at 37.7, 45.8, and 66.9, which were assigned to the γ-Al2O3 phase (COD: 01077-0396). The intensity of XRD reflection remained unchanged with the reduction temperature increasing, indicating the presence of sulfur species did not affect the crystal structure of alumina. The 27Al MAS NMR spectra gave detailed information about the coordination structure of Al3+ (Fig. S4). All samples exhibited three peaks at 10, 35, and 68 ppm, representing the Al3+ ions in octahedral, pentahedral, and tetrahedral coordination, respectively. The similar shape of profiles in three samples also indicated the removal of sulfur did not affect the structure of alumina, which was consistent with the XRD results. Nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms (Fig. 2b) indicated the typical mesoporous structure since the curves exhibited type IV adsorption isotherms with H2-shaped hysteresis loops. The textural properties of these samples were summarized in Table S1. The surface areas, pore size distributions, and pore volume were similar in the three samples, indicating that the textural properties hardly change with the removal of sulfur species.

The isotherms of Al2O3-H2-500 and Al2O3-H2-700 were vertically offset by 200 cm3 g -1, STP respectively.
It has been reported that the presence of impurities in alumina affects the surface structure, such as hydroxyl groups, oxygen species, oxygen vacancies, etc., and further affected the acid-base properties. To analyze the basic property of the alumina surface, temperature-programmed desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2-TPD) experiments were employed. As shown in Fig. 2(c), all samples exhibited a similar desorption peak of CO2 at  120 C, corresponding to hydroxyl groups on the Al2O3 surface, and no other desorption peak was found. The surface base sites increased dramatically from 3.3 to 64.3 mol CO2 g1 with the completely desulfurization process, which can be attributed to the removal of sulfur species modulating the property of surface hydroxyl groups that were referred to as the origin for acid-basic sites. The surface acidity was measured by the temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia experiments (NH3-TPD). Fig. 2(d) showed that all samples presented a broad desorption peak range between 100 and 600 C. The untreated alumina had the most total acid (268 mol NH3 g1), and that gradually decreased with the gradual removal of sulfur species, which were 247 and 215 mol NH3 g1 for Al2O3-H2-500 and Al2O3-H2-700 samples, respectively (Table S1). It was worth noting that the shape of profiles was complex and asymmetric, suggesting the presence of different acid sites. To further investigate the distribution of acid sites, we fitted the asymmetric profiles by Gaussian function. The patterns exhibited three desorption peaks, the peak centered at  180 C was assigned to the desorption of NH3 bonded by weak acid sites, the peak centered at  245 C was assigned to those medium-strong acid sites and the peak centered at  350 C was assigned to the deliberation of strong acid sites. The fraction and the actual content of different acid sites were modulated as the sulfur content changed, and corresponding results estimated based on NH3-TPD profiles were listed in Table 1. In terms of the acid amount, the weak acid decreased gradually, while the strong acid remained unchanged, which also indicated that the removal of sulfur affected the type of hydroxyl groups on the alumina surface.

3.3. Physicochemical properties of the supported catalysts
As-prepared supports were used for the fabrication of Pt-based catalysts by incipient wetness impregnation of an H2PtCl6·6H2O ethanol solution followed by a reduction procedure (details in Experimental Section). The catalysts were characterized by XRD, Nitrogen adsorptiondesorption, TEM, CO-DRIFT, and C3H6-TPD to reveal the morphology, crystal phase, and platinum properties. The XRD pattern of the catalysts before and after reduction showed that the diffraction peaks representing alumina were still the only peaks, suggesting that Pt species existed as highly dispersed species on the surface of alumina and/or due to their low loading (Fig. S5). Besides, the textural properties of the three catalysts were similar (Fig. S6 and Table S2-3), indicating the removal of sulfur after the reduction process for those catalysts did not affect the corresponding structure. This phenomenon was similar to the alumina reduction treatment mentioned above. NH3-TPD experiments were carried out to analyze the amount and strength of acid sites of the catalysts before and after reduction (Fig. 3) and corresponding results were listed in Table S2-S3. The acidity of the unreduced catalysts was reduced compared to the corresponding supports (Fig. 3a), suggesting that platinum oxide species could consume partial acid sites on the alumina surface. Furthermore, all reduced catalysts possessed a similar shape of profiles and total acidity that was close to the Al2O3-H2-700 sample (Fig. 3b), which was attributed to the removal of sulfur during catalyst reduction processes.

The TEM images of the fresh catalysts in Fig. 4(a) showed the dispersion of Pt particles on the surface of supports. As can be seen from the TEM images, the mean sizes of Pt particles decreased from 3 to 1.6 nm with the gradual removal of sulfur species, which can be attributed to the removal of sulfur species modulating the property of surface hydroxyl groups that were thought to be associated with the dispersion of the Pt species. The DRIFT spectroscopy with CO as the probe was used to investigate the properties of platinum particles of the reduced catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4(b), three adsorption peaks in the range of 19502150 cm1 were observed, and they can be ascribed to the linear adsorption of CO linearly adsorbed on saturated coordination sites, terraces, and corners of Pt particles. The three bands showed an upward shift with the removal of sulfur from alumina, where changing from 2032 to 2042 cm1, 2058 to 2064 cm1, and 2077 to 2083 cm1, respectively. The increased frequency of the CO vibration indicated a decrease in the electrons density of platinum particles [25]. The frequency of the CO vibration for sulfur-containing alumina supported Pt-based catalysts (Pt-Al2O3 and Pt-Al2O3-H2-500) was decreased compared to the completely desulfurized alumina supported Pt-based catalyst (Pt-Al2O3-H2-700), which was attributed to the sulfur species generated during the reduction process adsorb to the platinum surface thus modulating the electronic properties of the platinum. The reduction temperature above 500 C implied that the residual sulfur in the alumina support was similar for Pt-Al2O3 and Pt-Al2O3-H2-500 catalysts. The lower CO vibration frequency on the Pt-Al2O3 catalyst could be attributed to the difference in adsorption of H2S during the reduction process. Furthermore, no signal was detected below 2000 cm1 that was usually attributed to bridge bonded CO on platinum particles, indicating the absence of large platinum particles on the alumina surface [25], which was consistent with the results of TEM. Moreover, we investigated the electronic structure of Pt species by the C3H6-TPD measurements. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the desorption temperature of electron-rich propylene over Pt-Al2O3 catalyst was lower (225 C) in comparison with that (258 C) over the Pt-Al2O3-H2-700 catalyst, which demonstrated the increase in the electron density of Pt in the Pt-Al2O3 catalyst [25], [34], [35], [36].

3.4. Catalytic performance of the supported catalysts
The catalytic performances were evaluated under atmospheric pressure over a fix-bed reactor with a feed stream of 16 vol% C3H8, 20 vol% H2, and N2 balance at a space velocity of approximately 9.4 g C3H8 gcat-1h1. The blank experiment using quartz sand demonstrated a negligible conversion of propane (less than 1%) at 590 C under the tested reaction conditions (Fig. S7). The catalytic performance in Fig. 5(a) showed that the propane conversion was similar in the three catalysts, while there were significant differences in the propylene selectivity. Notably, the pristine commercial alumina had the highest sulfur content compared to the other supports and the corresponding catalyst (Pt-Al2O3) exhibited the highest propylene selectivity (SC3H6 = 95.4%) compared to those catalysts with low sulfur content (SC3H6 = 92.0% for Pt-Al2O3-H2-500 and SC3H6 = 89.2% for Pt-Al2O3-H2-700). We tracked the H2S signal (m/z = 34) during the reduction and reaction processes for the unreduced Pt-Al2O3 catalysts, and the results showed the hydrogen sulfide was present in the reduction process while not present in the reaction process (Fig. S8a). In addition, the sulfur element in the spent catalyst was characterized by EDX-Mapping. As shown in Fig. S8(b), the sulfur signal was still detectable for the spent Pt-Al2O3 catalyst and the sulfur content of about 0.3%. Considering that the reduction temperature was below 619 C, which may lead to partially sulfur species in the alumina support that cannot be completely removed. On the other hand, the generated hydrogen sulfide during the reduction process will be adsorbed on the Pt sites through the chemical bond between S and Pt. The difference in catalytic performance could be attributed to the effect of in situ hydrogen sulfide production during the reduction process on the properties of the Pt species. For comparison, we selected high-purity alumina that was obtained from the Sasol company, for the preparation of the reference catalysts. As shown in Fig. S9, the Pt- Al2O3-ref catalyst exhibited similar propylene selectivity (SC3H6 = 87.9%) to that of the desulfurization catalyst (Pt-Al2O3-H2-700). With the introduction of sulfur impurities into the high-purity alumina, the propylene selectivity over the Pt- Al2O3-ref-S catalyst increased to 91.3%, which further verified the positive effect of sulfur impurities on propylene selectivity. As far as the product distribution was concerned, besides the desired product propylene, hydrogenolysis, and cracking products could be also detected (Fig. 5b). As the sulfur content decreased, the propylene selectivity decreased and the by-products increased. The selectivity toward hydrogenolysis and cracking products was 4.6% for Pt-Al2O3 catalyst (SC2H4 = 0.85%, SC2H6 = 1.82%, and SCH4 = 1.93%), whereas that was more than 10% in the Pt-Al2O3-H2-700 catalyst (SC2H4 = 1.56%, SC2H6 = 4.31%, and SCH4 = 4.93%) that had been completely desulfurized, which implied that the presence of sulfur in alumina could significantly suppress side reactions. The by-products were mainly methane and ethane, which were produced by hydrogenolysis reactions that occurred at the low coordination platinum sites (such as steps, corners, edges, and defects) [26], [27], [28]. Thus, the inhibition of side reactions by sulfur impurity may be attributed to the coverage of the unsaturated coordination platinum sites during the reduction processes [29]. It has been proved that side reaction sites could also accelerate the formation of carbon deposits [30], [31], [32], [33]. To obtain detailed information on the coke formed during propane dehydrogenation, the spent catalysts were collected for analysis. The amount of coke deposited on the spent catalysts was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TG) in a temperature-programmed oxidation mode (TPO), and the weight loss curves of three spent catalysts were illustrated in Fig. 5(c). It was observed that the amount of coke deposited on the Pt-Al2O3 catalyst (3.1%) was lower than that on the other catalyst (4.9% for Pt-Al2O3-H2-500 versus 5.3% for Pt-Al2O3-H2-700). To further investigate the location of the coke deposit, the concentration of CO2 under TPO conditions was detected by mass spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 5(d), all samples presented a broad peak range between 400 and 600 C, however, the shape of profiles was asymmetric that suggesting the presence of different carbon species. Generally, the combustion of coke at low temperature is mainly the deposits that cover the active metal, while the combustion at higher temperature represents the deposits that are located on the external surface of the support [33], [34]. It was observed that the spent Pt-Al2O3 catalyst presented less fraction desorption peak at low temperature compared to that desulfurization alumina supported catalysts, which further illustrate that the sulfur impurity can inhibit side reactions on platinum particles. The difference in coke species over three spent catalysts was also investigated by using FTIR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S10, the two main adsorption bands between  1400 and  1630 cm1 could be observed on the spent Pt-Al2O3 catalysts. The former adsorption band could be ascribed to the skeleton vibrations of aliphatics, whereas the latter band could be assigned to the vibrations of CC in the aromatics [32]. Aliphatic carbon with a low C/H ratio was prone to be combusted easier than the aromatic carbon species during the regeneration process, which was desirable for the PDH process [34]. In particular, the absence of the skeleton vibrations of aliphatics for the spent Pt-Al2O3-H2-500 and Pt-Al2O3-H2-700 catalysts. In addition, NH3-TPD experiments were carried out to analyze the surface acidity for those spent catalysts (Fig. S11). The total acidity for the spent Pt-Al2O3, Pt-Al2O3-H2-500, and Pt-Al2O3-H2-700 catalysts were 190, 179, and 169 μmol/g respectively, which were lower than the corresponding fresh catalysts. The decrease in acidity could be attributed to the carbon deposits that will cover acid sites. The spent Pt-Al2O3 had the most acid implying less coke formation during the propane dehydrogenation process, which was consistent with the results of TG.

Catalytic conditions: atmospheric pressure, 590 C, C3H8/H2 = 1/1.25, with balance N2 for total flow rate of 50 mL min1, WHSV of propane = 9.4 h1 over 100 mg of sample.
To understand the origin of the variation in propylene selectivity and coke formation of different catalysts, the adsorption and desorption behavior of propylene were characterized and these results were displayed in the following sections. The enhancement of electron density for platinum was beneficial for the electron-rich olefin products desorption during propane dehydrogenation reaction [26], [35], [36], [37]. The relative adsorption strength of propylene on catalysts relates directly to the selectivity, and the easier propylene desorption compared to the propylene dehydrogenation is preferred to get a high selectivity [26], [38]. As discussed in the C3H6-TPD experiment, the desorption of propylene over the Pt-Al2O3 catalyst occurred at lower temperatures compared to that over the other catalysts with different degrees of desulfurization, indicating a weaker interaction between propylene and metal sites, which could explain the high selectivity [35].
DRIFTS measurements using propylene as probe molecule, one can obtain information on the interaction of electron-rich propylene as well as coke precursors with the active metal sites (Fig. 6). The peaks at 1642 cm1 can be assigned to the characteristic band of CC stretching of propylene, and two peaks at 1558 and 1448 cm1 were ascribed to the skeleton vibrations of the aromatics ring [28], [39]. The desorption peak of the CC stretching band at 1642 cm1 on Pt-Al2O3 catalyst no longer changed after the temperature reaching 250 C, while that peak disappeared entirely above 350 C for Pt-Al2O3-H2-500 and Pt-Al2O3-H2-700 catalysts. It indicated that the adsorption strength of propylene on Pt-Al2O3 catalysts was relatively weak and thus tending to desorb more readily, being different with other catalysts. This observation was consistent with the results of C3H6-TPD. Notably, the skeleton vibrations of the aromatics ring were observed on all three catalysts, and the intensity increased with the desorption of propylene. It indicated that the strong interaction between the platinum and the π-electrons of olefins can lead to deep dehydrogenation of olefins to coke precursors [30], [32]. Therefore, the abovementioned results demonstrated that the electron-rich coke precursors, like propylene, were easier to drop from platinum particles that supported on sulfur-containing alumina. It therefore allowed more efficient olefin desorption, thus promoting propylene selectivity and minimizing coke formation on the metal sites under the reaction conditions.

4. Conclusions
In this work, the sulfur-containing alumina with adjustable sulfur content was used for the investigation of the effect of sulfur impurity of the Al2O3-supported Pt catalyst on propane dehydrogenation. We observed that the sulfur impurity in alumina could be removal through a reduction process and the degree of desulfurization was related to the operating temperature. As a consequence, a series of alumina-supported Pt-based catalysts with different sulfur was successfully prepared. The superior propylene desorption and anti-coking ability over sulfur-containing alumina-supported platinum catalyst benefited from the electron increased and unsaturated sites poisoned of platinum particles by sulfur species that formed during the catalyst reduction process. Accordingly, such catalyst exhibited higher propylene selectivity and less coke in propane dehydrogenation reaction. This study shows that the presence of impurity in alumina is not entirely detrimental, and rational use of the impurity would be helpful in the design of a catalyst with high reactivity for potential applications.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
