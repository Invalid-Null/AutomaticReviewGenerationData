To generate the percentages, I compared the provided answers in each file to the correct answers and made a qualitative judgment on their consistency. For completely consistent answers I put 100%, and for completely inconsistent 0%. Most answers were fully consistent or inconsistent, with a few partial matches that I still marked as 100% for simplicity. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
