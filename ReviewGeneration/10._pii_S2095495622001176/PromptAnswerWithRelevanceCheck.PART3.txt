<quotes>
[1] The textural properties of these samples were summarized in Table S1. The surface areas, pore size distributions, and pore volume were similar in the three samples, indicating that the textural properties hardly change with the removal of sulfur species.

[2] The TEM images of the fresh catalysts in Fig. 4(a) showed the dispersion of Pt particles on the surface of supports. As can be seen from the TEM images, the mean sizes of Pt particles decreased from 3 to 1.6 nm with the gradual removal of sulfur species, which can be attributed to the removal of sulfur species modulating the property of surface hydroxyl groups that were thought to be associated with the dispersion of the Pt species.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It looks at how sulfur impurities in the alumina support affect the dispersion of Pt particles. The TEM images show that gradual removal of sulfur results in smaller Pt particle sizes, indicating better dispersion. This is attributed to changes in the hydroxyl groups on the alumina surface caused by sulfur removal.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
3. 是的,这篇文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它研究了氧化铝支撑体中的硫杂质如何影响铂颗粒的分散。TEM图像显示,逐渐除去硫会使Pt颗粒尺寸变小,表明分散性更好。这归因于硫去除导致的氧化铝表面羟基团的变化。

[1] "The obtained samples were named as Al2O3-H2-T (where T represents the processing temperature of alumina)."

[2] "As-prepared supports were used for the fabrication of Pt-based catalysts by incipient wetness co-impregnation method with H6PtCl6•6H2O as the precursors, in which the theoretical amount of Pt loaded was 0.5 wt%." 

[3] "The TEM images of the fresh catalysts in Fig. 4(a) showed the dispersion of Pt particles on the surface of supports."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies the effect of sulfur impurities in the alumina support on the dispersion of Pt particles. The alumina is treated at different temperatures to modulate the sulfur content. Pt catalysts are then prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. TEM images show the Pt particle size decreases with increasing sulfur removal, indicating the impurities affect dispersion.
