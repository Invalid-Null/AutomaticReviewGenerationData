[1] "The recent increasing availability of worldwide shale gas has stimulated a quick technical shift to obtain commodity propylene from the gas-based dehydrogenation routes."

[2] "As can be seen from the TEM images, the mean sizes of Pt particles decreased from 3 to 1.6 nm with the gradual removal of sulfur species, which can be attributed to the removal of sulfur species modulating the property of surface hydroxyl groups that were thought to be associated with the dispersion of the Pt species."

[3] "The TEM images of the fresh catalysts in Fig. 4(a) showed the dispersion of Pt particles on the surface of supports."

[4] "The DRIFT spectroscopy with CO as the probe was used to investigate the properties of platinum particles of the reduced catalysts."

[5] "The C3H6-TPD experiment, the desorption of propylene over the Pt-Al2O3 catalyst occurred at lower temperatures compared to that over the other catalysts with different degrees of desulfurization, indicating a weaker interaction between propylene and metal sites, which could explain the high selectivity."

[6] "It indicated that the strong interaction between the platinum and the π-electrons of olefins can lead to deep dehydrogenation of olefins to coke precursors."

[7] "Accordingly, such catalyst exhibited higher propylene selectivity and less coke in propane dehydrogenation reaction."

<English version answer>

1. No, the article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

2. No, the article does not investigate tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides for propane dehydrogenation.

3. No, the article does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts.

4. No, the article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

5. Yes, the article evaluates supported Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on propane conversion and propylene selectivity over different Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. Characterizations like TEM, CO-DRIFTS, and C3H6-TPD are used to study the Pt particle size, morphology and metal-support interactions.

6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like Pt particle size and support interactions affect performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. Smaller Pt nanoparticles and weaker metal-support interactions are shown to improve propylene selectivity.

7. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic pathway involving π-bonding of propylene to Pt sites leading to deep dehydrogenation and coke formation. Weaker Pt-propylene interactions are needed for high propylene selectivity.

8. No, the article does not propose detailed mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the Pt catalysts.

1. 不,该文没有评估任何有前途的金属氧化物催化剂,如Cr2O3、Pt-Sn、Ga2O3,用于丙烷脱氢。

2. 不,该文没有研究调谐金属氧化物的氧化态、氧易位性和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。

3. 不,该文没有为金属氧化物催化剂上的丙烷脱氢提出机理方案。

4. 不,该文没有探究金属氧化物催化剂中金属-载体界面效应对活性和选择性调控的影响。

5. 是的,该文评估了用于丙烷脱氢的受支撑Pt催化剂。它提供了不同Pt/Al2O3催化剂上丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性的数据。TEM、CO-DRIFTS和C3H6-TPD等表征被用来研究Pt颗粒大小、形态和金属-载体相互作用。

6. 是的,该文研究了Pt颗粒大小和载体相互作用等性质如何影响Pt/Al2O3催化剂的性能。更小的Pt纳米粒子和更弱的金属-载体相互作用被证明可以提高丙烯选择性。

7. 是的,该文提出了一种机理路径,即丙烯与Pt位点的π键相互作用会导致深度脱氢和焦炭形成。需要较弱的Pt-丙烯相互作用才能获得高丙烯选择性。

8. 不,该文没有为Pt催化剂上的丙烷脱氢提出详细的机理反应途径。
