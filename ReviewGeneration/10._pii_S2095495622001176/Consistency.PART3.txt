 Here is the JSON structure comparing the consistency ratios between the answer files and the correct answers:

```json

I compared each answer file's response for each question number to the correct answer provided. I calculated the consistency ratio as the percentage of content that matched between the two. 100% indicates complete consistency, while 0% means completely inconsistent.
