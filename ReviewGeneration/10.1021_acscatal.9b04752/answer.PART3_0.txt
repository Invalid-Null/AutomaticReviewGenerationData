[1] "Sodium decavanadate clusters, i.e., Na6V10O28, were dispersed on silica and calcined in air at 600 C, yielding a mixture of β-NaVO3 and Na1+xV3O8 interacting with the silica support (this calcined material is denoted Na6V10O28/SiO2)."

[2] "TEM of Na6V10O28/SiO2 (exposed to air during the sample transfer) shows that the silica surface contains areas covered with small nanoparticles of ca. 2 nm in diameter, containing V and Na according to line scan analysis and areas without nanoparticles but with homogenously distributed V and Na according to EDX mapping (Figure 1d)." 

[3] "After 240 min TOS, the rods had nearly disappeared (only scarce nanorods of ca. 100 nm were detected during the survey of various specimen areas), confirming that the redispersion of Na and V took place on the silica support during the 3 h activation stage."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using sodium decavanadate clusters dispersed on silica and calcined to yield β-NaVO3 and Na1+xV3O8 interacting with the silica support. TEM shows nanoparticles of ~2 nm diameter containing V and Na homogenously distributed on the silica surface. After 240 min time-on-stream, rods formed earlier redispersed into scarce nanorods of ~100 nm, indicating redispersion of Na and V on the silica support.
