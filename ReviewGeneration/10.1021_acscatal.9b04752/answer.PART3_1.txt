[1] "Since the nature of the surface vanadium species changes with dehydroxylation, (39) we treated Na6V10O28/SiO2(IWI) under a flow of synthetic air at 500 C and then handled this dehydroxylated Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) material for further characterization without exposure to air (such materials are labeled throughout the manuscript using subscript notations of the dehydroxylating temperature and the dehydroxylating gas)."

[2] "Incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) of an aqueous solution of Na6V10O28 onto silica (Aerosil 300, calcined at 600 C, 286 m2 g1) gives Na6V10O28/SiO2(IWI) with 2.0 wt % V loading as determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, corresponding approximately to 1 V nm2, which is well below the monolayer coverage limit of ca. 2.6 V nm2 for silica using IWI." 

[3] "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of Na6V10O28/SiO2 (exposed to air during the sample transfer) shows that the silica surface contains areas covered with small nanoparticles of ca. 2 nm in diameter, containing V and Na according to line scan analysis and areas without nanoparticles but with homogenously distributed V and Na according to EDX mapping (Figure 1d). We tentatively ascribe the areas of homogeneous distribution of Na and V to Na1+xV3O8, which is highly dispersed on the surface of silica."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it uses incipient wetness impregnation of sodium decavanadate onto silica to achieve high dispersion below monolayer coverage (quote [2]), and it uses transmission electron microscopy and EDX mapping to confirm homogeneous distribution of sodium and vanadium on the silica surface (quote [3]). The dehydroxylation pretreatment is also intended to optimize dispersion (quote [1]).

3. 是的,这篇文章研究了针对优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。具体而言,它使用钠十钒酸盐的浸渍Humid法导入硅胶中以达到单层覆盖以下的高分散度(引用[2]),并使用透射电子显微镜和EDX绘图来确认硅胶表面上钠和钒的均匀分布(引用[3])。脱羟基预处理也旨在优化分散度(引用[1])。

[1] "Turning now to X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), the normalized intensity of the pre-edge peak in the V K-edge XANES spectra increases when the symmetry of the ligand sphere around the vanadium atom changes in the following order: octahedral (Oh), distorted octahedral, square pyramidal (SP), distorted tetrahedral, and tetrahedral (Td, Figure 1e). (12) Therefore, the intensity and the position of the pre-edge peak can be used to probe the (average) coordination environment around the V atom."

[2] "To obtain insight into the evolution of the oxidation state and coordination environment of vanadium during the activation period of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) under ODP conditions, an operando V K-edge XANES experiment was conducted using a capillary flow reactor while monitoring the composition of the effluent gas with a compact GC and a time resolution of 3 min per chromatogram (WHSV ca. 9.7 h1, Figure 2df)."

[3] "Exposure of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) to the feed gas at 450 C rapidly shifts the edge position to higher energies (from 5481.9 to 5482.6 eV) and increases the normalized pre-edge peak height (from 0.67 to 0.81) within the first 12 min of TOS (initial stage, Figure 2d). This is explained by the fast reoxidation of α-NaV2O5 to Na1+xV3O8/SiO2 and β-NaVO3."

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it conducts an operando V K-edge XANES experiment using a capillary flow reactor to monitor changes in the oxidation state and coordination environment of vanadium during catalyst activation (quotes [2]-[3]). The normalized pre-edge peak intensity and position are sensitive indicators of the vanadium coordination environment (quote [1]), allowing observation of the fast reoxidation of the reduced catalyst phase under reaction conditions.

4. 是的,这篇文章运用了原位X射线吸收光谱技术来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。具体而言,它使用毛细管流动反应器进行V K边缘的原位XANES实验,以监测催化剂活化期间钒的氧化态和配位环境的变化(引用[2]-[3])。标准化的预边峰强度和位置对钒的配位环境非常敏感(引用[1]),这使得人们可以观察到还原的催化剂相在反应条件下的快速再氧化。
