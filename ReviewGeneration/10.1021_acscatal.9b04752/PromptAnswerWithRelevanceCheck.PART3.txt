[1] "Sodium decavanadate clusters, i.e., Na6V10O28, were dispersed on silica and calcined in air at 600 C, yielding a mixture of β-NaVO3 and Na1+xV3O8 interacting with the silica support (this calcined material is denoted Na6V10O28/SiO2)."

[2] "TEM of Na6V10O28/SiO2 (exposed to air during the sample transfer) shows that the silica surface contains areas covered with small nanoparticles of ca. 2 nm in diameter, containing V and Na according to line scan analysis and areas without nanoparticles but with homogenously distributed V and Na according to EDX mapping (Figure 1d)." 

[3] "After 240 min TOS, the rods had nearly disappeared (only scarce nanorods of ca. 100 nm were detected during the survey of various specimen areas), confirming that the redispersion of Na and V took place on the silica support during the 3 h activation stage."

[1] "Since the nature of the surface vanadium species changes with dehydroxylation, (39) we treated Na6V10O28/SiO2(IWI) under a flow of synthetic air at 500 C and then handled this dehydroxylated Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) material for further characterization without exposure to air (such materials are labeled throughout the manuscript using subscript notations of the dehydroxylating temperature and the dehydroxylating gas)."

[2] "Incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) of an aqueous solution of Na6V10O28 onto silica (Aerosil 300, calcined at 600 C, 286 m2 g1) gives Na6V10O28/SiO2(IWI) with 2.0 wt % V loading as determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, corresponding approximately to 1 V nm2, which is well below the monolayer coverage limit of ca. 2.6 V nm2 for silica using IWI." 

[3] "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of Na6V10O28/SiO2 (exposed to air during the sample transfer) shows that the silica surface contains areas covered with small nanoparticles of ca. 2 nm in diameter, containing V and Na according to line scan analysis and areas without nanoparticles but with homogenously distributed V and Na according to EDX mapping (Figure 1d). We tentatively ascribe the areas of homogeneous distribution of Na and V to Na1+xV3O8, which is highly dispersed on the surface of silica."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it uses incipient wetness impregnation of sodium decavanadate onto silica to achieve high dispersion below monolayer coverage (quote [2]), and it uses transmission electron microscopy and EDX mapping to confirm homogeneous distribution of sodium and vanadium on the silica surface (quote [3]). The dehydroxylation pretreatment is also intended to optimize dispersion (quote [1]).

[1] "Turning now to X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), the normalized intensity of the pre-edge peak in the V K-edge XANES spectra increases when the symmetry of the ligand sphere around the vanadium atom changes in the following order: octahedral (Oh), distorted octahedral, square pyramidal (SP), distorted tetrahedral, and tetrahedral (Td, Figure 1e).

Specifically, it uses the pre-edge peak intensity in V K-edge XANES to probe changes in vanadium coordination environment, and performs operando XANES during ODP to monitor the evolution of the catalyst from reduced NaV2O5 to oxidized Na1+xV3O8 and β-NaVO3. This provides insight into the redox mechanism.

[1] "Sodium decavanadate clusters, i.e., Na6V10O28, were dispersed on silica and calcined in air at 600 C, yielding a mixture of β-NaVO3 and Na1+xV3O8 interacting with the silica support (this calcined material is denoted Na6V10O28/SiO2)."

[2] "Incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) of an aqueous solution of Na6V10O28 onto silica (Aerosil 300, calcined at 600 C, 286 m2 g−1) gives Na6V10O28/SiO2(IWI) with 2.0 wt % V loading as determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, corresponding approximately to 1 V nm−2, which is well below the monolayer coverage limit of ca. 2.6 V nm−2 for silica using IWI."

[1] "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of Na6V10O28/SiO2 (exposed to air during the sample transfer) shows that the silica surface contains areas covered with small nanoparticles of ca. 2 nm in diameter, containing V and Na according to line scan analysis and areas without nanoparticles but with homogenously distributed V and Na according to EDX mapping (Figure 1d)."
