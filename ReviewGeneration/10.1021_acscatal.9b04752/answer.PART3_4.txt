[1] "Sodium decavanadate clusters, i.e., Na6V10O28, were dispersed on silica and calcined in air at 600 C, yielding a mixture of β-NaVO3 and Na1+xV3O8 interacting with the silica support (this calcined material is denoted Na6V10O28/SiO2)."

[2] "Incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) of an aqueous solution of Na6V10O28 onto silica (Aerosil 300, calcined at 600 C, 286 m2 g−1) gives Na6V10O28/SiO2(IWI) with 2.0 wt % V loading as determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, corresponding approximately to 1 V nm−2, which is well below the monolayer coverage limit of ca. 2.6 V nm−2 for silica using IWI."

[1] "To obtain insight into the evolution of the oxidation state and coordination environment of vanadium during the activation period of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) under ODP conditions, an operando V K-edge XANES experiment was conducted using a capillary flow reactor while monitoring the composition of the effluent gas with a compact GC and a time resolution of 3 min per chromatogram (WHSV ca. 9.7 h−1, Figure 2d−f)."

[2] "To probe the validity of this hypothesis, we followed the structural evolution of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) during the ODP using in situ Raman mapping (Linkam CCR1000 cell maintained at 450 C for 12 and 240 min under a reactive gas flow, Figure 3a)."

[1] "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of Na6V10O28/SiO2 (exposed to air during the sample transfer) shows that the silica surface contains areas covered with small nanoparticles of ca. 2 nm in diameter, containing V and Na according to line scan analysis and areas without nanoparticles but with homogenously distributed V and Na according to EDX mapping (Figure 1d)."

[2] "Following the morphological evolution of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) with TOS by ex situ TEM-EDX mapping with selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) reveals that Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) (0 min TOS, i.e., directly after the N2 pretreatment) contains an agglomerated phase containing Na and V, which is assigned to α-NaV2O5 based on the spectroscopic characterization discussed above (Figure 3c, top panel)."
