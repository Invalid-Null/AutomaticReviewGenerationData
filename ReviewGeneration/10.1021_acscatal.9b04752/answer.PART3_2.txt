[1] "Calcination of Na6V10O28/SiO2 in air at 600 C leads to a mixture of Na1+xV3O8, interacting with the silica support, and the metastable polymorph of sodium metavanadate, β-NaVO3."

[2] "The formation of β-NaVO3 at this temperature is unexpected as β-NaVO3 supported on silica and calcined at the same conditions transforms into α-NaVO3."

[3] "TEM of Na6V10O28/SiO2 (exposed to air during the sample transfer) shows that the silica surface contains areas covered with small nanoparticles of ca. 2 nm in diameter, containing V and Na according to line scan analysis and areas without nanoparticles but with homogenously distributed V and Na according to EDX mapping."

[4] "We tentatively ascribe the areas of homogeneous distribution of Na and V to Na1+xV3O8, which is highly dispersed on the surface of silica."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses calcining Na6V10O28 on silica to form highly dispersed Na1+xV3O8 interacting with the silica support along with nanoparticles of the metastable β-NaVO3 phase. TEM shows homogeneous Na and V distribution ascribed to well dispersed Na1+xV3O8.

[1] "In situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and in situ Raman studies with 18O isotopic labeling have shown that, below a monolayer coverage, supported V2O5 species exist as [VO4] sites, i.e., surface-bound terminal oxo V5+ species ((O)3VO)" 

[2] "An operando V K-edge XANES experiment was conducted using a capillary flow reactor while monitoring the composition of the effluent gas with a compact GC and a time resolution of 3 min per chromatogram (WHSV ca. 9.7 h-1, Figure 2d-f)."

[3] "In situ Raman mapping (after cooling down to room temperature) of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) with TOS of the ODP of propane"

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ XANES, Raman spectroscopy, and Raman mapping to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It examines changes in vanadium oxidation state and coordination during ODP using operando XANES. It also uses in-situ Raman mapping to follow structural evolution during ODP reaction.

[1] "To obtain insight into the evolution of the oxidation state and coordination environment of vanadium during the activation period of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) under ODP conditions, an operando V K-edge XANES experiment was conducted using a capillary flow reactor while monitoring the composition of the effluent gas with a compact GC and a time resolution of 3 min per chromatogram (WHSV ca. 9.7 h-1, Figure 2d-f)."

[2] "Exposure of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) to the feed gas at 450 °C rapidly shifts the edge position to higher energies (from 5481.9 to 5482.6 eV) and increases the normalized pre-edge peak height (from 0.67 to 0.81) within the first 12 min of TOS (initial stage, Figure 2d)." 

[3] "This is explained by the fast reoxidation of α-NaV2O5 to Na1+xV3O8/SiO2 and β-NaVO3."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses XANES to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It conducts an operando V K-edge XANES experiment to monitor changes in V oxidation state and coordination environment during ODP on Na6V10O28/SiO2. It shows a rapid shift to higher edge energies and increased pre-edge peak height due to fast reoxidation of reduced V species under ODP conditions.
