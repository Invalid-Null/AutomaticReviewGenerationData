[1] "Calcination of Na6V10O28/SiO2 in air at 600 C leads to a mixture of Na1+xV3O8, interacting with the silica support, and the metastable polymorph of sodium metavanadate, β-NaVO3."

[2] "This catalyst exceeds the activity of the reference catalysts [VO4]/SiO2 and α-NaVO3/SiO2 by 24 and 45%, respectively."  

[3] "In contrast to α-NaVO3/SiO2 and [VO4]/SiO2 that are structurally stable under inert gas conditions, β-NaVO3 and Na1+xV3O8/SiO2 in Na6V10O28/SiO2 react when heated to 450500 C under N2, yielding a reduced phase, α-NaV2O5."

[4] "Our results confirm the key roles of dispersion and reducibility; the latter is relevant, given the redox mechanism of the ODP reaction on vanadium-based ODP catalysts."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it studies calcination of Na6V10O28 on silica to form Na1+xV3O8 interacting with silica and metastable β-NaVO3, which enhances dispersion compared to α-NaVO3/SiO2 and isolated [VO4] sites on silica. This improves activity by 24-45% over those reference catalysts. The article also shows the Na6V10O28 derived catalyst can be reduced to α-NaV2O5 under inert conditions, indicating the importance of reducibility and dispersion for this reaction.

Answer: 是的,该文探究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。具体来说,它研究了Na6V10O28在二氧化硅上的煅烧,形成与二氧化硅相互作用的Na1+xV3O8和β-NaVO3的亚稳态,这增强了相对于α-NaVO3/SiO2和二氧化硅上的隔离[VO4]位点的分散度。这提高了比这些参照催化剂高24-45%的活性。该文献还显示Na6V10O28衍生的催化剂可以在惰性条件下还原为α-NaV2O5,这表明了这一反应中可还原性和分散度的重要性。

[1] "Turning now to X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), the normalized intensity of the pre-edge peak in the V K-edge XANES spectra increases when the symmetry of the ligand sphere around the vanadium atom changes in the following order: octahedral (Oh), distorted octahedral, square pyramidal (SP), distorted tetrahedral, and tetrahedral (Td, Figure 1e)." 

[2] "To obtain insight into the evolution of the oxidation state and coordination environment of vanadium during the activation period of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) under ODP conditions, an operando V K-edge XANES experiment was conducted using a capillary flow reactor while monitoring the composition of the effluent gas with a compact GC and a time resolution of 3 min per chromatogram (WHSV ca. 9.7 h-1, Figure 2d-f)."

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ XANES characterization to study oxidation state changes in the vanadium active phase during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it uses the pre-edge peak intensity in V K-edge XANES to probe changes in vanadium coordination environment, and performs operando XANES during ODP to monitor the evolution of the catalyst from reduced NaV2O5 to oxidized Na1+xV3O8 and β-NaVO3. This provides insight into the redox mechanism.

Answer: 是的,该文利用了原位XANES表征来研究丙烷脱氢催化过程中钒活性相的氧化状态变化。具体来说,它使用V K边XANES的预边峰强度来探测钒的配位环境变化,并在ODP过程中进行原位XANES以监测催化剂从NaV2O5还原态到Na1+xV3O8和β-NaVO3氧化态的演变。这提供了关于氧化-还原机理的见解。
