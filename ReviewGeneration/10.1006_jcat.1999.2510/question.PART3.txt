I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

Isotopic Tracer and Kinetic Studies of Oxidative Dehydrogenation Pathways on Vanadium Oxide Catalysts
Abstract
Kinetic analysis and isotopic tracer studies were used to identify elementary steps and their reversibility in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on VOx/ZrO2 catalysts with VOx surface densities between 1.6 and 6 VOx/nm2. Competitive reactions of C3H6 and CH313CH2CH3 showed that CO forms via secondary combustion of propene intermediates. CO2 formed via this reaction and also via the direct combustion of propane. Reactions of 18O2/C3H8 mixtures on supported V216O5 led to the preferential initial appearance of lattice 16O atoms in all oxygen-containing products, as expected if lattice oxygens were required for the activation of CH bonds. Isotopically mixed O2 species were not detected during reactions of C3H818O216O2 reactant mixtures. Therefore, dissociative O2 chemisorption steps are irreversible. Similarly, C3H8C3D8O2 reactants undergo oxidative dehydrogenation without forming C3H8xDx mixed isotopomers, suggesting that CH bond activation steps are also irreversible. Normal kinetic isotopic effects (kCH/kCD=2.5) were measured for primary oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Kinetic isotope effects were slightly lower for propane and propene combustion steps (1.7 and 2.2, respectively). These data are consistent with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds in propane and propene. C3H6D2O and C3D6H2O cross exchange reactions occur readily during reaction; therefore, OH recombination steps are reversible and nearly equilibrated. These isotopic tracer results are consistent with a Marsvan Krevelen redox mechanism involving two lattice oxygens in irreversible CH bond activation steps. The resulting alkyl species desorb as propene and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups to form water and reduced V centers. These reduced V centers reoxidize by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2. The application of pseudo-steady-state and reversibility assumptions leads to a complex kinetic rate expression that describes accurately the observed water inhibition effects and the kinetic orders in propane and oxygen when surface oxygen and OH groups are assumed to be the most abundant surface intermediates.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
