 Unfortunately this literature review does not contain any information relevant to propane dehydrogenation or the catalysts and mechanisms involved. The article is focused on electrochemical CO2 reduction using copper-based catalysts. As such, I am unable to provide any relevant quotes or answers to the questions asked.
