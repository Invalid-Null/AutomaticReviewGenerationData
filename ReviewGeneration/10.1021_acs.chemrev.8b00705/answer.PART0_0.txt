 Unfortunately this literature passage does not contain any information relevant to propane dehydrogenation or propylene production. Instead, it is a review article on electrochemical CO2 reduction using copper catalysts. As such, I cannot provide any relevant quotes or answers to the questions posed, which all pertain to propane dehydrogenation.
