 ※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※

Based on my assessment, the answers provided do not contain information relevant to answering the specific questions asked. The questions are asking about propane dehydrogenation catalysts, selectivity profiles, Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn/Pt-Ga/Pt-Zn, electronic/geometric effects, use of subsurface promoters, synergistic effects between metals, and zeolite supports. 

However, the answers provided focus on heptane reforming over Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, effects of adding Sn and Cl, and catalyst regeneration methods involving chlorine. There is no information provided that is directly relevant to answering the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Therefore, I have stopped my review process and responded with the sentence indicating that the provided answers are not relevant to the questions, as instructed.
