 Here is the comparison of the answer files to the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%"},
  "5": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I carefully compared the answers provided in each file to the correct answers for each question. The consistency ratio expresses how consistent an answer file's response is with the correct answer, as a percentage from 0% (completely inconsistent) to 100% (completely consistent).
