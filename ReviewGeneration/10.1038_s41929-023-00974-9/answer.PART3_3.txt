[1] "Taking into account that the treatment mainly causes the removal of Ge species in the UTL zeolite framework, it is inferred that only part of the Ge species in specific positions accounts for the stabilization of Pt clusters."

[2] "As shown in Fig. 1c, the optimum Pt/Ge-UTL catalyst exhibits remarkably high stability in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The exceptionally high stabilization of the Pt/Ge-UTL catalyst could be ascribed to the unique bonding between the Pt clusters and the Ge-d4r units, and the high structural rigidity of Ge-d4r units under reaction conditions."

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides the specific example of subnanometer Pt clusters stabilized by germanium-enriched double four-membered ring units in a UTL-type zeolite. Data shows this Pt/Ge-UTL catalyst has remarkably high stability for propane dehydrogenation. The stabilization is ascribed to the unique bonding between the Pt clusters and the Ge-d4r units.

2. 是的,文章评估了金属封装在分子筛载体中以增强丙烷脱氢催化剂稳定性。它提供了一个特定的例子,即用UTL型分子筛中的富集的双四元环单元稳定的亚纳米Pt簇。数据显示这种Pt/Ge-UTL催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中具有非常高的稳定性。稳定性的原因归因于Pt簇与Ge-d4r单元之间的独特化学键。

[1] "Interestingly, the size distributions of the Pt particles are greatly dependent on the time of the acid pickling treatment. After condition optimization - that is, 2 hours of acid pickling - subnanometre Pt clusters with good dispersion are observed in the optimum Pt/Ge-UTL sample while the size of Pt species tends to become larger on UTL zeolites derived from either shorter or longer times of acid pickling treatment."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it discusses using different acid pickling times to control the size distribution of Pt particles in UTL zeolites, finding 2 hours optimal for achieving subnanometer Pt clusters with good dispersion.

[1] "The authors have further studied the location of the Pt clusters by the integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC-STEM) imaging technique, which suggests the Pt clusters are preferentially located in the 14-membered ring channels instead of the 12-membered ring channels (see Fig. 1ab)."

5. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses integrated differential phase contrast STEM (iDPC-STEM) imaging to show the subnanometer Pt clusters are preferentially located in the 14-membered ring channels of the UTL zeolite support.
