[1] Supported subnanometre metal clusters exhibit superior catalytic performances in various reactions because of their unique geometric and electronic structural features in comparison to conventional larger nanoparticles1. However, similarly to the emerging single-atom catalysts, subnanometre metal clusters also suffer from stability issues due to their strong tendency towards sintering at high reaction temperatures.

[2] Now, writing in Nature Catalysis, Wu and colleagues report a synthesis method for the stabilization of subnanometre Pt clusters in a zeolite matrix by employing the germanium-enriched double four-membered rings (Ge-d4rs) of UTL-type zeolite as the anchoring sites7.

[3] As shown in Fig. 1c, the optimum Pt/Ge-UTL catalyst exhibits remarkably high stability in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The exceptionally high stabilization of the Pt/Ge-UTL catalyst could be ascribed to the unique bonding between the Pt clusters and the Ge-d4r units, and the high structural rigidity of Ge-d4r units under reaction conditions.

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It discusses how subnanometer Pt clusters stabilized in the germanium-enriched UTL zeolite framework exhibit remarkably high stability for propane dehydrogenation. Data shows the Pt/Ge-UTL catalyst maintains stability after long reaction times. The stability is ascribed to the bonding between Pt clusters and germanium sites in the zeolite framework.

答:是的,这篇文章评估了在沸石载体中封装金属以提高丙烷脱氢反应催化剂稳定性。它讨论了如何将子纳米Pt簇稳定在富集了锗的UTL沸石框架中,表现出显著高的丙烷脱氢稳定性。数据显示Pt/Ge-UTL催化剂在长时间反应后仍能保持稳定。这种稳定性归因于Pt簇与沸石框架中锗位点之间的键合。

[1] The authors have further studied the location of the Pt clusters by the integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC-STEM) imaging technique, which suggests the Pt clusters are preferentially located in the 14-membered ring channels instead of the 12-membered ring channels (see Fig. 1ab).

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses integrated differential phase contrast STEM imaging to show that Pt clusters are preferentially located in the 14-membered rings of the zeolite, rather than the 12-membered rings.
