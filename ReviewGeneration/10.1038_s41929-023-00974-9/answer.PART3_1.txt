<quotes>

[1] "Now, writing in Nature Catalysis, Wu and colleagues report a synthesis method for the stabilization of subnanometre Pt clusters in a zeolite matrix by employing the germanium-enriched double four-membered rings (Ge-d4rs) of UTL-type zeolite as the anchoring sites7."

[2] "The authors have further studied the location of the Pt clusters by the integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC-STEM) imaging technique, which suggests the Pt clusters are preferentially located in the 14-membered ring channels instead of the 12-membered ring channels (see Fig. 1ab)."  

[3] "As shown in Fig. 1c, the optimum Pt/Ge-UTL catalyst exhibits remarkably high stability in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The exceptionally high stabilization of the Pt/Ge-UTL catalyst could be ascribed to the unique bonding between the Pt clusters and the Ge-d4r units, and the high structural rigidity of Ge-d4r units under reaction conditions."

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It discusses the use of germanium-enriched double four-membered rings in UTL-type zeolite to stabilize subnanometer Pt clusters. The Pt clusters bind to the Ge-d4r units, leading to high stability for propane dehydrogenation. Fig. 1 and data in Fig. 1c show the Pt/Ge-UTL catalyst exhibits remarkably high stability for propane dehydrogenation.

[1] "Interestingly, the size distributions of the Pt particles are greatly dependent on the time of the acid pickling treatment. After condition optimization that is, 2 hours of acid pickling subnanometre Pt clusters with good dispersion are observed in the optimum Pt/Ge-UTL sample while the size of Pt species tends to become larger on UTL zeolites derived from either shorter or longer times of acid pickling treatment."
