Ordered macroporous boron phosphate crystals as metal-free catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872206720636543
AbstractAbstract
Ordered macroporous materials with rapid mass transport and enhanced active site accessibility are essential for achieving improved catalytic activity. In this study, boron phosphate crystals with a three-dimensionally interconnected ordered macroporous structure and a robust framework were fabricated and used as stable and selective catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. Due to the improved mass diffusion and higher number of exposed active sites in the ordered macroporous structure, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable olefin productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1, which is up to 2100 times higher than that of ODH catalysts reported to date. The selectivity for olefins was 91.5% (propene: 82.5%, ethene: 9.0%) at 515 C, with a propane conversion of 14.3%. At the same time, the selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product remained less than 1.0%. The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the ODH of propane. This study provides a route for preparing a new type of metal-free catalyst with stable structure against oxidation and remarkable catalytic activity, which may represent a potential candidate to promote the industrialization of the ODH process.

1. Introduction
Ordered macroporous materials have an extremely favorable architecture, which can improve mass transport, reduce diffusion limitations, and expose a large number of active sites [1, 2]. Therefore, they have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis [3, 4, 5]. To date, several types of ordered macroporous materials including silica [6], metals [7], metal oxides [8], polymers [9, 10, 11], and carbon [12] have been reported. Nevertheless, being thermodynamically unstable as well as sintering- or surface-inert, these materials are not suitable as active catalysts for high-temperature oxidative reactions. Bulk metal-free oxides with thermally stable crystal structures can be potentially used in oxidation reactions, but are commonly associated with a low accessible surface area [13]. An efficient strategy to solve this problem is to create porous structures in metal-free oxides. However, due to the lack of efficient protocols for their synthesis, these materials have rarely been reported. To extend their applications to diffusion-limited reaction processes [14], there is a pressing need to synthesize ordered macroporous materials based on metal-free oxide crystals.
Metal-free boron phosphate (BPO4), formed by corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra, has superior thermal stability and outstanding oxidation resistance. Based on the established understanding of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes catalyzed by boron-based catalysts [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], the BO (BOH) sites of edge-functionalized boron nitride and silica-supported B2O3 catalysts play a pivotal role in the production of olefins. Recently, B2O3 supported on hollow BPO4 spheres was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, and melted B2O3 was considered as the active species of the catalyst [25]. Boron-phosphate mixed oxides were reported as active catalysts for the partial oxidation of propane, with high conversion of propane but low selectivity for olefins, as well as a wide spectrum of oxygenated products; however, no clear structural analysis of the oxides was reported [26, 27]. On the basis of these results, we can envisage that BPO4, a boron-containing metal-free ternary oxide with abundant BO sites, could be potentially used to catalyze the ODH of propane to propene. In fact, the preparation of BPO4 commonly requires high-temperature calcination to form the crystals, which often gives rise to the formation of non-porous, bulk solids with low accessible surface areas. Considering the exposure of active sites in reactive processes, there is a pressing need to synthesize porous BPO4 crystals. Moreover, mass and heat transfer issues are particularly important in the ODH of propane, because the highly exothermic nature of this reaction easily produces hot spots on the catalyst surface, in turn causing secondary reactions of the olefin products. By taking full advantage of the high thermal conductivity [28] of BPO4 and simultaneously improving the mass transfer to reduce the contact time, we expect to obtain a new type of metal-free boron-based catalyst with excellent catalytic selectivity and productivity in the propane ODH, which would represent key improvements for the industrialization of this process.
To achieve this goal, in this paper we report the synthesis of a three-dimensional (3D)-ordered macroporous BPO4 material with a robust framework, which exhibits excellent activity and selectivity for the ODH of propane to propene, with a remarkably high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV).
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
Resorcinol (99.5%) was purchased from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Formaldehyde (37 wt%), 1,6-diaminohexane (DAH, 99.0%), boric acid, and phosphoric acid were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade.
2.2. Synthesis of polybenzoxazine polymer spheres
Polybenzoxazine polymer spheres with a uniform particle size of ca. 350 nm were prepared according to a modified method [29]. Typically, resorcinol (8.8 g) was first dissolved in deionized water (8 L) with vigorous stirring at 30 C, and then formaldehyde (37 wt%, 11.8 mL) was added to form a clear solution. After addition of DAH (1.16 g), the clear solution turned into a white colloid within 1 min, followed by the addition of dilute ammonia solution (20 mL, 1.5 M). The resulting solution was heated to 80 C under vigorous stirring for 4 h. The polymer products were rinsed three times with deionized water, and water was removed by centrifugation. Finally, the purified products were dispersed in water.
2.3. Synthesis of ordered macroporous BPO4 [BPO4(OM)]
Ordered macroporous boron phosphate crystals were prepared according to a modified method [3, 30, 31], based on in situ nanocasting. First, monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres were assembled into highly ordered 3D monoliths by centrifugation. Then, 1.08 g boric acid and 1.2 mL phosphoric acid were dissolved into 48 mL ethanol and 2 mL water. The 3D monoliths were soaked in the mixed ethanol-water solutions and then hydrothermally treated at 140 C for nucleation and growth of BPO4 over 6 days. After removing the excess solvent and drying at 50 C, the materials were collected and pyrolyzed at 550 C for 2 h in Ar atmosphere. The final macroporous BPO4 product, denoted as BPO4(OM), was obtained by calcination at 550 C for 5 h in air to remove the template.
2.4. Synthesis of bulk BPO4 [BPO4(bulk)]
After dissolving H3BO3 (1.75 mmol) and H3PO4 (120 Î¼L) into 3 mL deionized water with stirring for 15 min, the solution was placed in a rotary evaporator. After reacting and drying at 70 C for 20 h, the collected powders were calcined at 550 C for 5 h in air to obtain the nonporous BPO4 product, denoted as BPO4(bulk). The structural characterizations are shown in Fig. S8.
2.5. Catalytic tests
The catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was performed in a packed-bed quartz microreactor (i.d. = 6 mm) with 100 mg of catalyst under atmospheric pressure. A C3H8/O2/N2 reaction mixture with a molar ratio of 1:1.5:3.5 was employed in the experiments. The flow rate was fixed at 48 mL/min (the WHSV was 9.4 gC3H8 gcat1 h1), and the reaction temperature was varied in the range of 470550 C. Before the reaction, each catalyst was pretreated under reaction conditions until the conversion was stabilized. The productivity experiments were performed in the temperature range of 500550 C. The catalyst mass and flow rate were varied in the ranges of 25100 mg and 48120 mL/min, respectively (the WHSV was 9.494 gC3H8 gcat1 h1). Reactants and products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (Techcomp, GC 7980). GDX-102 and 5A molecular sieve columns connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) were used to analyze the O2, N2, C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, CO, and CO2 products.
The conversion was defined as the number of moles of carbon converted to the products divided by the number of moles present in the feed. The selectivity was defined as the number of moles of carbon in the product divided by the number of moles that reacted. Under our typical testing conditions, the carbon balance was normally in the range of 95%100%.
The effect of internal and external mass transfer on the conversion was determined using the experimental procedure reported in the literature.[32] Internal diffusion effects were investigated by monitoring the propane rate with catalyst particle sizes between 20 and 100 mesh, at constant WHSV (9.4 gC3H8 gcat1 h1). A diagnostic test was performed to check for external diffusion. In the packed-bed reactor, two series of tests with different catalyst masses (25 and 50 mg) were performed for each catalyst. The W/F ratio in each series was varied from 1.5 to 13 min gcat gC3H81, and two conversion vs. W/F plots were generated.
2.6. Characterization
The morphology of the samples was characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), using a Hitachi SU8220 instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained by a FEI Tecnai F30 high-resolution microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV, by dispersing ground powders in ethanol and then onto holey carbon films supported on copper grids. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a PANalytical X'Pert3 powder diffractometer, using Cu KÎ± radiation (40 kV, 40 mA, Î» = 0.15406 nm). Infrared (IR) spectra were collected on a Nicolet 6700 Fourier-transform IR (FT-IR) spectrometer using a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. Hg intrusion isotherms and pore size distributions (PSDs) of pores larger than 50 nm were measured using a Micromeritics AutoPore IV 9500 analyzer. Thermogravimetric (TG) profiles were measured from 40 to 900 C with a heating rate of 10 C min1 under air flow, using a STA449 F3 Jupiter TG analyzer (Netzsch). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed with an Escalab 250 electron energy analyzer equipped with an in situ reaction cell. A monochromatic Al KÎ± X-ray source (1486.6 eV, anode operating at 15 kV and 300 W) was used as incident radiation. Solid-state 11B and 31P magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) measurements were performed on a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer with a 14.1 T magnet. The spectra were acquired using 4-mm MAS-NMR probes with a spinning rate of 10 kHz. One-dimensional (1D) 11B MAS-NMR spectra acquired at 14.1 T were obtained with a Ï/12 pulse width of 0.66 Î¼s. The chemical shifts were referenced to a 1 M H3BO3 aqueous solution at 19.6 ppm for 11B NMR and 85% H3PO4 for 31 P NMR.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characterization of ordered macroporous BPO4 catalyst
The synthesis of ordered macroporous BPO4 was conducted via hydrothermal-assisted synthesis and calcination, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Boric acid and phosphoric acid were employed as sources of boron and phosphorus, respectively, and monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres were used as the hard template. BPO4(OM) materials with ordered macropores were obtained after removing the template. First, the monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres were assembled into highly ordered 3D monoliths. The monoliths were then immersed in the mixed ethanol-water solutions of boric acid and phosphoric acid, and further sealed in an autoclave for the nucleation and growth of BPO4. After the hydrothermal-assisted synthesis, the dried materials were collected and thermally treated under argon atmosphere (yielding the BPO4@carbon product), then calcined in air to remove the hard template. As a result, the precursors smoothly turned into the BPO4(OM) product. As a control experiment, BPO4 was directly prepared by mixing aqueous solutions of boric acid and phosphoric acid, followed by drying. The dried materials were subjected to the same calcination treatment as that applied for BPO4(OM), yielding the BPO4(bulk) sample.

The SEM images of the polybenzoxazine polymer template and BPO4@carbon composite (Fig. 1(b) and (c)) reveal that the porous spaces derived from the tight packing of polybenzoxazine polymer spheres were fully filled with BPO4. After pyrolysis and calcination of the composite, the tightly packed ordered polybenzoxazine polymer spheres were imprinted into the BPO4 crystals. The structure of BPO4(OM) (Fig. 1(d)) shows large domains of ordered macroporous 3D networks, along with the interconnected pore structure of BPO4. The XRD patterns of the BPO4(OM) sample (Fig. 3(e)) show four main characteristic diffraction peaks at 2Î´ = 24.5, 40.0, 48.9, and 63.8 corresponding to the (101), (112), (121), and (213) facets of the known BPO4 crystal structure, respectively, indicating the existence of the crystalline BPO4 phase.

The ordered macroporous structure was an inverse replica of the template, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores (Fig. 1(d)); this diameter was slightly smaller than that of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, due to the thermal shrinkage of the spheres during the pyrolysis process. The presence of macroporosity in BPO4 was further confirmed by mercury intrusion analysis (Fig. S1); the cumulative pore volume vs. pore diameter curve showed a continuous increase in mercury uptake with decreasing pore diameter (i.e., increasing Hg intrusion pressure). The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter. This indicated that BPO4(OM) possessed abundant and fully interconnected macropores with a large volume. Based on the mercury intrusion analysis (Fig. S1), the specific surface areas of BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) were estimated to be 75 and 22 m2 g1, respectively.
The TG analysis (Fig. S2) of the BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) precursors before calcination shows that the first stage for all BPO4 precursors was the removal of physically adsorbed water at 100 C. The marked weight loss (approximately 80 wt%) above 450 C for the BPO4(OM) precursors was assigned to the decomposition processes of the polybenzoxazine-based carbon template. For comparison, the slight weight loss with increasing temperature observed for BPO4(bulk) was caused by the loss of water due to the dehydration reaction.
TEM images provided direct insight into the effects of the monodisperse polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, serving as templates, on the morphological features of BPO4 crystals. Figure 1(e) shows that the interstitial spaces between ordered and packed polybenzoxazine polymer spheres were filled with BPO4 crystals. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Fig. 1(f)) image shows an interplanar distance of 3.62 Ã corresponding to the (101) plane of BPO4, revealing that BPO4 was present as intergrown crystals. The elemental mapping images (Fig. 1(g)) show a homogeneous distribution of the B, O, and P elements in the whole BPO4 crystals.
3.2. Catalytic performance
First, preliminary experiments were conducted in order to rule out internal and external mass diffusion effects (Fig. S3). The temperature dependence of the propane conversion and the distribution of products over the catalysts (Fig. 2(a) and (b)) clearly show that BPO4(OM) was more active than BPO4(bulk) in the ODH of propane. For example, to reach the same conversion of 14.3%, the BPO4(OM) catalyst required a reaction temperature of 515 C, while BPO4(bulk) required a temperature of 550 C. Increasing the temperature from 475 to 528 C caused the propane conversion to increase from 3.1% to 29.8% when using BPO4(OM). The conversion remained below 10% for BPO4(bulk) at 528 C. The stronger response to the temperature for the propane conversion on the BPO4(OM) than the BPO4(bulk) catalyst indicates that the presence of ordered macropores facilitated the exposure of a higher number of active sites, participating in the catalysis and achieving an equivalent conversion at lower reaction temperatures (at least by 40 C). This represents a significant improvement, attributed to the well-developed macropores of the catalyst. Nevertheless, both BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) exhibited identical trends of the olefin selectivity at the same conversion (Fig. 2(d)), demonstrating that the ordered macropores did not affect the active region. Furthermore, after normalizing the reaction rates of propane to the surface area of the BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk) catalysts, the rates at the same reaction temperature became quite similar, indicating that the two catalysts had identical active sites (Table S2). The products consisted of C3H6, C2H4, CO, and CO2, and the selectivity for the desired propene product slightly decreased with increasing temperature (Fig. S4). When taking into account the equally important ethene product, the selectivity of the BPO4(OM) catalyst for light olefins (C2-3=) remained mostly above 90%, e.g., the C2-3= selectivity reached 94.1% at 500 C (propene: 85.6%, ethene: 8.5%), 91.5% at 515 C (propene: 82.5%, ethene: 9.0%), and 90.7% at 520 C (propene: 79.9%, ethene: 10.8%). It is noteworthy that the selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product remained below 1.0% for the BPO4 catalyst (Fig. 2(b)). The catalytic performance of the BPO4(OM) catalyst was tested for 20 h at a constant reaction temperature of 515 C (Fig. 2(c)), and the catalyst remained stable, owing to the superior thermal stability and outstanding oxidation resistance of BPO4.

(d) Comparison of olefin (C3H6 + C2H4) selectivity and productivity of propane ODH as a function of C3H8 conversion for BPO4 and several representative catalysts (Table S1).
One of the most important requirements for commercially attractive ODH catalysts is their ability to achieve a high productivity (golefin gcat1 h1) of olefins (Fig. 2(d)). BPO4(OM) exhibited a productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the BPO4(bulk) (1.2 golefin gcat1 h1) and of the reported catalysts (Table S1) used in the ODH process, including hydroxylated boron nitride (6.7 golefin gcat1 h1) and metal oxide catalysts (0.178.5 golefin gcat1 h1). The catalytic performances of ordered macroporous BPO4(OM) and nonporous BPO4(bulk) under different WHSV conditions are shown in Table S1. BPO4(OM) showed a productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1 at a WHSV of 94 gC3H8 gcat1 h1, with a propane conversion of 20.8%. This productivity is 2100 times higher than that of previously reported ODH catalysts (Table S1). In contrast, BPO4(bulk) showed a productivity of 0.31 golefin gcat1 h1 at a lower WHSV of 37.6 gC3H8 gcat1 h1, and its propane conversion was already as low as 0.9% at same reaction temperature of 535 C. This comparison reveals that the interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions [33], which cannot be promoted or achieved using bulk and nonporous BPO4. The improved kinetic diffusion to the reactive sites results in a greatly improved yield.
3.3. Structural stability and active sites of ordered macroporous BPO4 catalyst
The structural stability of the BPO4(OM) catalyst was characterized using various techniques including SEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR, and NMR (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). The SEM and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images (Fig. 3(a)(d)) show that the spent catalyst BPO4(OM) after react 20 h was characterized by an ordered macroporous framework. The macropore sizes and the intergrown nanocrystals were essentially unchanged. Furthermore, the XRD pattern of the spent BPO4(OM) after the catalytic reaction (Fig. 3(e)) was identical to that of the fresh catalyst. These results strongly indicate that the crystallized macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited excellent structural stability during the ODH of propane. The examination of the crystal plane surfaces in Fig. 3(f) reveals that they crossed the channels formed by alternating BO4 and PO4 units, leading to a high exposure of BO groups, especially for the (101) surface. The FTIR spectra of the fresh and spent BPO4(OM) catalysts are displayed in Fig. 4(a). The peaks located at 1100 and 1620 cm1 were assigned to PO4 groups and PO bonds [34, 35]. The transmittance peaks at 935 cm1 were attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of BO4 tetrahedra, and the peaks at 1350 cm1 were tentatively assigned to tri-coordinated boron (BO3) species. These results suggest that both fresh and spent BPO4(OM) catalysts mainly consisted of BO4 and PO4 groups.

11B and 31P NMR measurements of the fresh and spent BPO4(OM) catalysts were then carried out (Fig. 4(b), (c)). The B and P species, with chemical shifts of ca. 5.3 and 31 ppm, respectively, were essentially retained after the reaction. This result clearly demonstrates that the BPO4(OM) catalyst was structurally stable after the ODH of propane, and boron predominantly existed as tetra-coordinated species. Compared to the catalyst enriched in tri-coordinated boron species [18], BPO4(OM) showed a slightly lower selectivity for ethene at the same propane conversion. The presence of abundant tetra-coordinated boron species in the catalysts had two consequences: on one hand, the boron sites were too crowded to be accessible to nucleophilic species; on the other hand, the electron density in the vicinity of the boron sites was enhanced (the calculated natural population atomic charges at B3LYP/6-31(d) level changed from 3.02e to 4.12e on O atoms bound to B, and from 1.37e to 1.32e on B). Both hindered the approach of electron-rich species, e.g., propene, and inhibited the breakage of surface CC bonds, which led to reduced formation of ethene and deep oxidation products (Fig. 2(b) and (d)).
XPS measurements were conducted to determine the surface chemical properties of the fresh and spent BPO4(OM) catalysts. The XPS results (Fig. 5) show that the atomic percentages of P (estimated from the P 2p XPS profile) in the fresh and spent BPO4(OM) catalysts were 12.2% and 12.5%, respectively. Since the BPO4(OM) catalyst was active under the reaction conditions (Fig. S5), we deduced that the catalytic activity was not directly related to the phosphorus concentration on the catalyst surfaces. On the other hand, the atomic percentages of B in the fresh and spent BPO4(OM) catalysts were estimated to be ca. 33.1% and 33.7%, respectively. The B 1s spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 193.6, 191.8, and 189.3 eV. These peaks were attributed to BO3 (tri-coordinated boron), BO4 (tetra-coordinated boron), and boron suboxides (BxOy, 1.5 < x/y < 3), respectively [36, 37]. The tri-coordinated B site has less electron density in its vicinity than the tetra-coordinated B site since in these species B always remained with a former oxidation state of +3, which was neutralized when being tri-coordinated while felt excess negative charge when tetra-coordinated. The presence of the excess electron density in its vicinity is expected to perturb the binding strength of 1s electron and shift the bind energy to a lower value. The tetra-coordinated boron species represented the transition region to extend the bulk structure to the surface. The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst (Table S3). These results likely indicate that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane. In short, the presence of BO3 is related to the catalytic activity of the BPO4(OM) catalyst. This is consistent with our recent study of the ODH of light alkanes catalyzed by supported B2O3 [18]. It should be noted that the solid-state MAS-NMR technique is used to analyze the bulk structure, rather than the surface structure. XPS is a surface analysis technique, which can commonly probe regions located approximately 510 nm beneath the surface. For the fresh and spent catalysts, no NMR signal (600 MHz spectrometer with a 14.1 T magnet) corresponding to BO3 could be detected under such strong magnetic field, in turn indicating that the BO3 content on the catalyst surface was low. Even though there were signals, they may have already been overspread by the bulky signals of BO4.

In an earlier work [26], a calcined H3BO3/P2O5 mixture was found to be active in the partial oxidation of light alkanes, and its role was proposed to involve the activation of gaseous oxygen; however, the understanding of the corresponding active sites and mechanism remained limited. In this study, we carefully designed a BPO4(OM) catalyst with an interconnected macroporous structure and compared its performance in the ODH of propane with that of crystalline BPO4(bulk). In this way, we identified BO3 as the active sites, which, under the reaction conditions, activated gaseous oxygen and participated in the dehydrogenation of alkanes.
In addition, kinetic ODH experiments were performed for the BPO4 catalysts (Figs. S6 and S7). The activation energies (Ea) for propane dehydrogenation on BPO4(OM) (ca. 200 kJ/mol) and BPO4(bulk) (ca. 207 kJ/mol) were quite similar, indicating that the active sites of the ordered macroporous BPO4 and bulk materials were identical. In the current study, oxygen remained present even at high propane conversions, and the Ea for oxygen conversion was estimated to be 231 kJ/mol, higher than that of propane; this shows that the reaction mechanism was controlled by molecular oxygen activation on the catalyst surface. These results indicate that the cleavage of CH bonds could readily happen after oxygen activation on the BPO4(OM) catalyst. Based on the effect of the oxygen concentration on the reaction rate of propane, the oxygen reaction order was estimated to be 0.5.
4. Conclusions
In summary, an ordered macroporous and metal-free BPO4 material with an interconnected crystal framework has been prepared by hydrothermal-assisted synthesis. The material showed excellent catalytic performance in the ODH of propane to propene, as evidenced by high propane conversion, high propene selectivity, and low CO2 emission. The olefin productivity of BPO4 was much higher than that of reported boron-containing catalysts [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Structural characterizations revealed that the ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibited a remarkable structural stability, and the tri-coordinated BO surface species incorporated in the framework were responsible for catalyzing the ODH reaction of propane. This study provides a new strategy for improving the catalytic activity of metal-free oxides and offers a platform for investigating the composition and fracture of boron-based catalysts.
