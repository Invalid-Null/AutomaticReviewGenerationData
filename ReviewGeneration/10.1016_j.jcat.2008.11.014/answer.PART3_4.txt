<quotes>
[1] "In situ XAS studies were conducted to understand the behavior of Cr species during the DHP on fresh and regenerated catalysts based on the changes that occur in oxidation and coordination states of Cr species."

[2] "In situ XANES studies show that Cr is in highly oxidized state after oxidative pre-treatment in 5CrSBA-15 and 5CrAl2O3. Under DHP conditions, isolated Cr(VI) species in 
 coordination are reduced to (III) and the coordination number increases (>4) within 90 s DHP, as evidenced by the disappearance of pre-edge peak, the red shift in the edge position and increased intensity of the white line."
