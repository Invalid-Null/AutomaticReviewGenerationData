[1] The objective of in situ XAS (XANES and EXAFS) studies is to understand the behavior of Cr species during the DHP on fresh and regenerated catalysts based on the changes that occur in oxidation and coordination states of Cr species. To this end, 5 wt% Cr catalysts were selected from the series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 and subjected to pre-treatment, reaction (first DHP run), regeneration and reaction (second DHP run) at 823 K. 

[2] In situ XANES studies show that Cr is in highly oxidized state after oxidative pre-treatment in 5CrSBA-15 and 5CrAl2O3. Under DHP conditions, isolated Cr(VI) species in
