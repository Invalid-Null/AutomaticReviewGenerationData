[1] "In situ XAS studies were carried out in a heatable X-ray reaction cell equipped with a temperature programmer and a gas-dosing system with mass-flow controllers."

[2] "In situ experiments were performed at 823 K according to the following sequence: (a) oxidative pre-treatment in 5% O2 in He (15 mlmin1) for 1 h, (b) behavior of Cr species during DHP is studied by changing the flow from O2 to 5% C3H8 in He (15 mlmin1) for 15 min (denoted as first run), (c) followed by regeneration by switching to 5% O2 in He (15 mlmin1) and (d) subsequently a second DHP run was performed by changing the flow from O2 to 5% C3H8 in He (15 mlmin1) for 1 h."

[1] "In situ XANES studies show that Cr is in highly oxidized state after oxidative pre-treatment in 5CrSBA-15 and 5CrAl2O3. Under DHP conditions, isolated Cr(VI) species in 
 coordination are reduced to (III) and the coordination number increases (>4) within 90 s DHP, as evidenced by the disappearance of pre-edge peak, the red shift in the edge position and increased intensity of the white line."   

[2] "Regeneration between the two DHP runs did not completely restore the initial XANES spectrum. However, significantly the isolated Cr species are more or less completely restored as evidenced by the pre-edge peak, which is quite different from 5CrSBA-15 in which a fraction of isolated Cr species were lost in favor of clusters."
