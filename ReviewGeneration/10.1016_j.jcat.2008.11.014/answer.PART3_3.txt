[1] Remarkably, CO2 was interestingly reported as an alternative to O2 or N2O as an oxidizing agent for ODHP, in which again Cr based catalysts were found to be more active than other metal catalysts [16], [20], [21], [22].

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It prepares Cr catalysts on SBA-15 and alumina supports with different Cr loadings from 0.5-10 wt% using incipient wetness impregnation. It finds that at low 1 wt% Cr loadings, isolated Cr species form, while at higher 5 wt% loadings on SBA-15, crystalline Cr2O3 particles form, indicating lower dispersion. On alumina at 5 wt%, it finds mainly oligomeric Cr species form with no detectable Cr2O3, indicating high dispersion is retained.

3. 是的,文中调查了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它使用原位湿浸法在SBA-15和氧化铝载体上制备了不同Cr载量(0.5-10 wt%)的Cr催化剂。结果发现,在低的1 wt% Cr载量下,形成了隔离的Cr种类,而在SBA-15上较高的5 wt%载量下,形成了晶体Cr2O3颗粒,表明分散度较低。在5 wt%的氧化铝上,主要形成了低聚Cr种类,没有检测到Cr2O3,表明保持了高分散度。

[1] The objective of in situ XAS (XANES and EXAFS) studies is to understand the behavior of Cr species during the DHP on fresh and regenerated catalysts based on the changes that occur in oxidation and coordination states of Cr species. To this end, 5 wt% Cr catalysts were selected from the series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 and subjected to pre-treatment, reaction (first DHP run), regeneration and reaction (second DHP run) at 823 K. 

[2] In situ XANES studies show that Cr is in highly oxidized state after oxidative pre-treatment in 5CrSBA-15 and 5CrAl2O3. Under DHP conditions, isolated Cr(VI) species in 
 coordination are reduced to (III) and the coordination number increases (>4) within 90 s DHP, as evidenced by the disappearance of pre-edge peak, the red shift in the edge position and increased intensity of the white line.

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ XAS characterization to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it performs in-situ XANES and EXAFS on 5 wt% Cr/SBA-15 and 5 wt% Cr/alumina catalysts during propane dehydrogenation at 823K. It shows isolated Cr(VI) sites are reduced to Cr(III) and the coordination number increases within 90 seconds upon exposure to propane.

5. Yes, the article employs STEM microscopy coupled with EDXS to characterize metal-support interfaces. Specifically, it uses these techniques to analyze the distribution and agglomeration of Cr species on the SBA-15 and alumina supports. It finds isolated Cr species and Cr2O3 particles on SBA-15, and highly dispersed oligomeric Cr species within the pores of alumina.
