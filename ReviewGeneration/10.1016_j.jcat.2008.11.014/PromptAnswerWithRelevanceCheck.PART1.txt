<English version answer>
Answer: No, the article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses specifically on Cr catalysts supported on SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 否,本文没有评价Cr2O3、Pt-Sn、Ga2O3等有前途的金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它专门针对载体为SBA-15和γ-Al2O3的Cr催化剂进行了研究。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) was studied over a series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, to gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function.

[2] The catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopyenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEMEDXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS).

[3] In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state.

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how the oxidation state of Cr affects propane dehydrogenation performance. In situ XAS studies showed that active Cr sites are generated during the reaction, with Cr typically being reduced to the +3 oxidation state. The Cr(VI) species present after oxidation pretreatment are rapidly reduced to Cr(III) upon exposure to propane.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,本文研究了Cr的氧化态如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。原位XAS研究表明,活性Cr位点是在反应过程中生成的,Cr通常被还原至+3氧化态。氧化预处理后存在的Cr(VI)物种在接触丙烷后迅速还原为Cr(III)。

[1] Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) was studied over a series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, to gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function. 

[2] In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state.

[3] Based on ex situ and in situ characterization results and catalytic data, it appears that the activity of the Cr species is different in xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3. For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. 

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios that active Cr sites are generated in situ from Cr(VI) species during propane dehydrogenation. Isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number >4 are proposed as the active sites in xCrSBA-15, while oligomeric Cr species are more active in xCrAl2O3.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,文章提出了原位生成活性Cr位点的机理方案,即Cr(VI)物种在丙烷脱氢过程中转化为活性位点。文章提出了xCrSBA-15中配位数大于4的隔离Cr(III)位点是活性位点,而xCrAl2O3中低聚Cr物种的活性更高。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] The structure and catalytic properties of these Cr species are compared with those supported on γ-Al2O3, which is typically used in industrial DHP processes and is also known to contain well defined Cr site distribution depending on the Cr content. This will allow us to investigate the influence of the molecular structure, which is dependent on the nature of the support as evident from literature, of Cr species on DHP with identical Cr content and in some cases (at 1 wt% Cr) with similar Cr distribution.

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects by comparing Cr species on SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3 supports. It shows that the nature of the support determines the molecular structure of Cr species and their catalytic activity, with isolated Cr sites on SBA-15 being more active than oligomeric sites on γ-Al2O3.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,文章通过比较SBA-15和γ-Al2O3两种载体上的Cr物种,探讨了金属-载体界面效应。结果表明,载体的性质决定了Cr物种的分子结构和催化活性,SBA-15上的隔离Cr位点比γ-Al2O3上的低聚物种更活性。
