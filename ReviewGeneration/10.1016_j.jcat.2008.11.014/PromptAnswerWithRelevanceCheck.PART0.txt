[1] Specifically, Cr supported on silicon (either on SiO2 or on siliceous mesoporous materials like SBA-15 and MCM-41) have shown higher activity than the regular catalysts, for example on Al2O3
</quotes>

<English version answer>
2. Yes, the article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers. It states that Cr supported on silicon materials like SBA-15 have shown higher activity than regular Al2O3 supported catalysts. So the silicon support helps facilitate the reaction. But no specific mechanism details are provided.
