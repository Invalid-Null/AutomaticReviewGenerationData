[1] "In situ XAS (XANES and EXAFS) studies were primarily conducted to support the conclusions derived from Raman and other characterization techniques and to examine the Cr speciation in the catalysts in minute detail."

[2] "In situ XANES studies show that Cr is in highly oxidized state after oxidative pre-treatment in 5CrSBA-15 and 5CrAl2O3. Under DHP conditions, isolated Cr(VI) species in 
 coordination are reduced to (III) and the coordination number increases (>4) within 90 s DHP, as evidenced by the disappearance of pre-edge peak, the red shift in the edge position and increased intensity of the white line."
