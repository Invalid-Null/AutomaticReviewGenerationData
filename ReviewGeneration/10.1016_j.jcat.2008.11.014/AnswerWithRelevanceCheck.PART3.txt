         [1] "the series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts (x in the catalyst label represents the nominal Cr content, wt%) were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation."
         
         [2] "Impregnation solutions were prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of Cr(NO3)2 9H2O (Merck, 98100%) in double deionized water."

         Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It prepared a series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts with different chromium loadings by incipient wetness impregnation to control the dispersion and nature of chromium species.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         是的,文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它使用原位湿浸法在SBA-15和氧化铝载体上制备了不同Cr载量(0.5-10 wt%)的Cr催化剂。结果发现,在低的1 wt% Cr载量下,形成了隔离的Cr种类,而在SBA-15上较高的5 wt%载量下,形成了晶体Cr2O3颗粒,表明分散度较低。在5 wt%的氧化铝上,主要形成了低聚Cr种类,没有检测到Cr2O3,表明保持了高分散度。

         [1] "In situ XAS (XANES and EXAFS) studies were primarily conducted to support the conclusions derived from Raman and other characterization techniques and to examine the Cr speciation in the catalysts in minute detail."
         
         [2] "In situ XANES studies show that Cr is in highly oxidized state after oxidative pre-treatment in 5CrSBA-15 and 5CrAl2O3. Under DHP conditions, isolated Cr(VI) species in  
 coordination are reduced to (III) and the coordination number increases (>4) within 90 s DHP, as evidenced by the disappearance of pre-edge peak, the red shift in the edge position and increased intensity of the white line."

      <English>
         Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows that isolated Cr(VI) species are reduced to Cr(III) and the coordination number increases within 90 seconds under reaction conditions.
      </English> 
      <Chinese>
         是的,文章采用了原位X射线吸收光谱学(XAS)来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它显示在丙烷脱氢条件下,隔离的Cr(VI)物种在90秒内被还原为Cr(III),并且配位数增加。这提供了对催化剂工作状态的见解。
