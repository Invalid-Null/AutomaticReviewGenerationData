[1] "As a result, the nature of active Cr species in Cr catalysts during DHP remains elusive and is still a subject of debate [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]."
[2] "In the present work, a series of Cr catalysts with varying Cr content (0.510 wt%) was prepared aiming to create a well defined Cr site distribution in the catalysts and thereby to derive the catalytic function of each specific Cr species." 
</quotes>

<English version answer>
4. Yes, the article summarizes remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It states that the nature of active chromium species in chromium catalysts during dehydrogenation of propane remains unclear and is still debated. The article aims to prepare a series of chromium catalysts with varying chromium content to create well-defined distributions of chromium species in order to derive the catalytic function of each specific chromium species.
