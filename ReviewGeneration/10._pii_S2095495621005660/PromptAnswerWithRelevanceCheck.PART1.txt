8. No, the article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses solely on Pt/BN catalysts.

9. No, the article does not investigate how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It does not study metal oxide catalysts.

10. No, the article does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts. It only studies Pt/BN catalysts.

11. No, the article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on Pt/BN catalysts, not metal oxides.

12. Yes, the article evaluates supported Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, specifically Pt/BN catalysts. It provides data on activity, stability, selectivity, and deactivation rates for Pt/BN compared to Pt/Al2O3. 

13. Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal-support interactions affect Pt/BN catalyst performance. It reveals that calcination-induced and reduction-adjusted strong metal-support interactions between Pt and BN lead to partial encapsulation of Pt, enhancing stability and propylene selectivity.

[1] "Platinum is the most frequently used as an active metal in PDH due to its superior activation of CH bonds, low activity to CC cleavage, and environment-friendly property [1]."

[2] "Fig. 1 shows the comparison of the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/BN in PDH."

[3] "We have demonstrated that h-BN is a promising support of Pt-based catalysts for PDH reaction."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt/BN has higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Pt/Al2O3. It states that Pt is frequently used in PDH due to its ability to activate C-H bonds while minimizing C-C bond cleavage. The article concludes hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a promising support for Pt-based PDH catalysts.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章评估了用于丙烷脱氢的负载单金属Pt催化剂。它提供了数据显示Pt/BN比Pt/Al2O3有更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。它指出Pt由于能激活C-H键而最小化C-C键断裂而经常用于丙烷脱氢。文章得出六方氮化硼(h-BN)是Pt基丙烷脱氢催化剂的有前景的载体。

[1] "It can be found that proper calcination before reduction significantly improved the catalytic performance of the Pt/BN (Fig. 2a)." 

[2] "Fig. 2(f) shows the CO-chemisorption and TPO results of the two catalysts, and PDH results are given again for convenient comparison. It can be found that the CO uptake on the Pt/BN-R is three times as large as that on the Pt/BN-C&R, indicating the direct reduction without calcination causes more exposed Pt active sites."

[3] "The structural models of Pt/BN catalysts undergoing different treatments are shown in Fig. 3(f) based on the above analysis."
</quotes>

<English version answer> 
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like calcination temperature, reduction temperature, and metal-support interactions affect the performance of supported Pt catalysts. It shows proper calcination before reduction improves Pt/BN catalytic performance compared to just reduction. It reveals direct reduction leads to more exposed Pt active sites based on CO chemisorption data, but lower propane conversion than calcination plus reduction. The article proposes structural models showing calcination causes partial encapsulation of Pt particles by boron oxide overlayers, which helps explain the improved selectivity.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章研究了类似煅烧温度、还原温度和金属-载体间相互作用等性质如何影响负载Pt催化剂的性能。它显示在还原之前适当的煅烧可以改善Pt/BN的催化性能,相比于单独还原。它根据CO化学吸附数据透露直接还原导致更多暴露的Pt活性位点,但比煅烧与还原有更低的丙烷转化率。文章提出结构模型显示煅烧导致Pt颗粒被硼氧化物表层部分包裹,这有助于解释提高的选择性。

<quotes>
[1] "It has been found that the Pt/BN catalyst undergoing calcination and reduction is highly stable in both PDH reaction and coke-burning regeneration, together with low coke deposition and outstanding propylene selectivity."

[2] "Detailed characterizations demonstrate that the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) induced by calcination and adjusted by reduction is responsible for the high selectivity and stability of Pt/BN in PDH."

[3] "We have revealed that the high coke resistance and high propylene selectivity of the Pt/BN catalyst are derived not only from the absence of acidity on BN support, but also from the calcination-induced and reduction-adjusted SMSI between Pt and BN, which causes the partial encapsulation of Pt particles by BOx overlayers." 

[4] "The BOx overlayers can block the low-coordinated Pt sites and constrain Pt particles into smaller ensembles, suppressing side reactions such as cracking and deep dehydrogenation."

[5] "Moreover, the BOx overlayers can effectively inhibit Pt sintering by the spatial isolation of Pt during periodic reaction-regeneration cycles."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like calcination, reduction, and metal-support interactions affect the performance of the Pt/BN catalyst. It is found that calcination induces strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Pt and BN, causing partial encapsulation of Pt particles by BOx overlayers. This suppresses side reactions and coke formation, resulting in high propylene selectivity. The subsequent reduction adjusts the SMSI and improves Pt accessibility. The SMSI also inhibits Pt sintering during periodic regeneration, leading to high stability.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
6. 是的,本文研究了煅烧、还原和金属-载体相互作用等因素如何影响Pt/BN催化剂的性能。发现煅烧诱导Pt和BN之间强的金属-载体相互作用(SMSI),导致Pt颗粒被BOx覆盖层部分包覆。这抑制了副反应和焦炭生成,提高了丙烯选择性。随后的还原调整了SMSI并提高了Pt的可及性。SMSI也抑制了Pt在周期性再生过程中的烧结,导致催化剂高稳定性。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes> 
[1] "The structural models of Pt/BN catalysts undergoing different treatments are shown in Fig. 3(f) based on the above analysis."

[2] "For the Pt/BN-R without calcination-induced SMSI, the direct reduction leads to the formation of bare Pt particles including large amount of low-coordinated Pt sites, which are very active in CH and CC bond activation and prone to deep reaction, causing more cracking and coking and in turn lower propylene selectivity."

[3] "However, the calcination-induced and reduction-adjusted SMSI between Pt and BN results in partial encapsulation of Pt particles by BOx overlayers on the Pt/BN-C&R. The BOx overlayers might block the low-coordinated Pt sites and constrain Pt particles into smaller ensembles, causing high propylene selectivity."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
7. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the Pt/BN catalysts with different treatments. Without calcination-induced SMSI, bare Pt particles are formed with many low-coordinated sites that activate C-H and C-C bonds, causing cracking and coking. With calcination-induced SMSI adjusted by reduction, Pt particles are partially encapsulated by BOx overlayers. This blocks low-coordinated sites and constrains Pt ensembles, improving selectivity.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
7. 是的,本文提出了经不同处理的Pt/BN催化剂上丙烷脱氢的反应机理。如果没有煅烧诱导的SMSI,将形成大量低配位Pt位的裸Pt颗粒,这会激活C-H和C-C键,引起裂化和焦炭生成。如果煅烧诱导的SMSI经还原调整,Pt颗粒会被BOx覆盖层部分包覆。这会阻断低配位Pt位,束缚Pt集聚体,提高选择性。

[2] "The major issue of Pt-based catalysts in PDH is rapid deactivation caused by coke formation and metal agglomeration."

[3] "It can be found that the conversion of propane in the initial stage was almost identical over the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/BN, and it gradually dropped over both catalysts with time on stream (Fig. 1a)." 

[4] "Obviously, the conversion of propane on the Pt/BN decreased more slowly than that on the Pt/Al2O3, indicating better stability of the Pt/BN."

[5] "The Pt/BN showed a very high and stable propylene selectivity, which is close to 98% in the initial stage and more than 99% in most of reaction stages."
