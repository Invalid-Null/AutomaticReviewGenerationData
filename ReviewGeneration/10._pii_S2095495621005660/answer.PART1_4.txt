<quotes>
[1] "Platinum is the most frequently used as an active metal in PDH due to its superior activation of CH bonds, low activity to CC cleavage, and environment-friendly property [1]."

[2] "The major issue of Pt-based catalysts in PDH is rapid deactivation caused by coke formation and metal agglomeration."

[3] "It can be found that the conversion of propane in the initial stage was almost identical over the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/BN, and it gradually dropped over both catalysts with time on stream (Fig. 1a)." 

[4] "Obviously, the conversion of propane on the Pt/BN decreased more slowly than that on the Pt/Al2O3, indicating better stability of the Pt/BN."

[5] "The Pt/BN showed a very high and stable propylene selectivity, which is close to 98% in the initial stage and more than 99% in most of reaction stages."

[6] "We speculate that the high propylene selectivity on Pt/BN originates not only from the absence of acidity on BN support, but also from a certain kind of interaction between BN and Pt, which needs to further investigation."

5. The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt/BN has higher stability and propylene selectivity compared to Pt/Al2O3. The article speculates the performance may be due to metal-support interactions between Pt and BN, but further investigation is needed.

5. 该文献评价了单组分Pt金属载体催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。提供的数据显示,与Pt/Al2O3相比,Pt/BN具有更高的稳定性和丙烯选择性。文献推测该性能可能源于Pt与BN之间的金属-载体相互作用,但需要进一步调查。

[1] "The Pt/BN catalyst undergoing calcination and reduction is highly stable in PDH reaction and coke-burning regeneration, together with low coke deposition and outstanding propylene selectivity."

[2] "It has been revealed that the high coke resistance and high propylene selectivity of the Pt/BN catalyst are derived not only from the absence of acidity on BN support, but also from the calcination-induced and reduction-adjusted SMSI between Pt and BN, which causes the partial encapsulation of Pt particles by BOx overlayers." 

[3] "The BOx overlayers can block the low-coordinated Pt sites and constrain Pt particles into smaller ensembles, suppressing side reactions such as cracking and deep dehydrogenation."

[4] "Moreover, the BOx overlayers can effectively inhibit Pt sintering by the spatial isolation of Pt during periodic reaction-regeneration cycles."

6. The article investigates how calcination and reduction treatments affect metal-support interactions between Pt and BN, which modulate the catalyst's activity and selectivity. It reveals calcination causes partial encapsulation of Pt by BOx overlayers, blocking low-coordinated sites and constraining Pt particle size. This suppresses side reactions and coke formation, improving selectivity, and the BOx overlayers also inhibit Pt sintering during regeneration cycles.

6. 该文献研究了煅烧和还原处理如何影响Pt与BN之间的金属-载体相互作用,从而调控催化剂的活性和选择性。结果显示,煅烧导致Pt被BOx覆层部分包覆,阻断低配位位点并限制Pt颗粒大小。这抑制了副反应和焦炭生成,提高了选择性,BOx覆层也抑制了Pt在再生循环过程中的烧结。
