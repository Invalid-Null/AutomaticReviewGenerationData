<quotes>
[1] "The Pt/BN catalyst with a targeted Pt loading of 0.5 wt% was prepared by impregnating h-BN (25 m2 g1, Aladdin, Shanghai) with aqueous Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Sino-Platinum, Kunming) solution."

[2] "After stirring well, the impregnation mixture was dried by rotary evaporator at 50 C for 2 h, and further dried in an oven at 110 C overnight." 

[3] "Finally, the catalyst was calcined in a muffle at 600 C for 4 h and then pressed into pellets with 6080 mesh."

[1] "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were taken on an FEI Tecnai G2F30 or G220 microscope using different modes with the maximum operating voltage of 200 kV."

[2] "The specimen was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing the sample powder in ethanol, and drops of the suspension were deposited on a carbon-coated copper grid and dried in air."

[3] "To further examine the effect of catalyst calcination and reduction on the Pt dispersion, we conducted the Pt particle size statistics based on the HAADF-STEM images (Figs. S1 and S2), and the average sizes of Pt are summarized in Fig. 2(c)."

[4] "The HRTEM shows that the average size of Pt particles on the Pt/BN after ten reaction-regeneration cycles (Fig. 4d) just increased very slightly compared with that on the fresh sample (Fig. 2c and Fig. S1)."
