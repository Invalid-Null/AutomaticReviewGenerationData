[1] "The Pt/BN catalyst with a targeted Pt loading of 0.5 wt% was prepared by impregnating h-BN (25 m2 g−1, Aladdin, Shanghai) with aqueous Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Sino-Platinum, Kunming) solution."

[2] "It has been found that the Pt catalysts supported on h-BN were prepared by an impregnation method using Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 as metal precursors."  

[3] "The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by the same procedure as the Pt/BN catalyst."

3. Yes, the article investigates impregnation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It prepares Pt/BN catalysts by impregnating BN support with Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 aqueous solution to achieve 0.5 wt% Pt loading. The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was made using the same impregnation technique for comparison.

[1] "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were taken on an FEI Tecnai G2F30 or G220 microscope using different modes with the maximum operating voltage of 200 kV."

[2] "Fig. 3(b) shows the HRTEM image of the Pt/BN-R, in which clear boundary of Pt particle supported on the BN support can be observed. Instead, the partial encapsulation of Pt particle by calcination-induced BOx overlayers can be observed on the Pt/BN-C&R (Fig. 3c)."

[3] "The HRTEM shows that the average size of Pt particles on the Pt/BN after ten reaction-regeneration cycles (Fig. 4d) just increased very slightly compared with that on the fresh sample (Fig. 2c and Fig. S1)."

5. Yes, the article employs TEM and HRTEM to characterize metal-support interfaces and Pt particle sizes in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides images showing Pt on BN support, with and without boron oxide encapsulation. It also tracks changes in Pt particle size after reaction-regeneration cycling.

</English version answer>

[1] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected by a Thermo Fisher Escalab 250Xi using monochromatic Al Kα X-ray under ultrahigh vacuum condition (<5 × 10−10 mbar)." 

[2] "Fig. 3(d) shows the B 1s and Pt 4f XPS of the Pt/BN catalyst undergoing in situ calcination and/or reduction treatment. The surface Pt/B ratio on the Pt/BN-C (0.00039) or Pt/BN-C&R (0.00039) is much lower than that on the precursor (0.00080) or Pt/BN-R (0.00079), which is in accordance with the encapsulation of Pt by calcination-induced BOx overlayers."

[3] "The B 1s spectra were fitted into two components, BO at 192.0 eV and BN at 190.6 eV. For the precursor, the percentage of BO component is 6.4%. It can be found that the percentage of BO component decreased after reduction (5.5%), while it increased after calcination (7.0%), further confirming the formation of BOx species during calcination."

<English version answer> 

6. Yes, the article uses XPS to probe oxidation state changes of B and Pt during in-situ calcination and reduction treatments. It provides data on changes in BOx and Pt species during calcination-induced and reduction-adjusted metal-support interactions.
