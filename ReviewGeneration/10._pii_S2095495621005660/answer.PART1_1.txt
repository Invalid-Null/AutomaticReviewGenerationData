<quotes>
[1] "Platinum is the most frequently used as an active metal in PDH due to its superior activation of CH bonds, low activity to CC cleavage, and environment-friendly property [1]."

[2] "Fig. 1 shows the comparison of the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/BN in PDH."

[3] "We have demonstrated that h-BN is a promising support of Pt-based catalysts for PDH reaction."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt/BN has higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Pt/Al2O3. It states that Pt is frequently used in PDH due to its ability to activate C-H bonds while minimizing C-C bond cleavage. The article concludes hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a promising support for Pt-based PDH catalysts.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章评估了用于丙烷脱氢的负载单金属Pt催化剂。它提供了数据显示Pt/BN比Pt/Al2O3有更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。它指出Pt由于能激活C-H键而最小化C-C键断裂而经常用于丙烷脱氢。文章得出六方氮化硼(h-BN)是Pt基丙烷脱氢催化剂的有前景的载体。

[1] "It can be found that proper calcination before reduction significantly improved the catalytic performance of the Pt/BN (Fig. 2a)." 

[2] "Fig. 2(f) shows the CO-chemisorption and TPO results of the two catalysts, and PDH results are given again for convenient comparison. It can be found that the CO uptake on the Pt/BN-R is three times as large as that on the Pt/BN-C&R, indicating the direct reduction without calcination causes more exposed Pt active sites."

[3] "The structural models of Pt/BN catalysts undergoing different treatments are shown in Fig. 3(f) based on the above analysis."
</quotes>

<English version answer> 
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like calcination temperature, reduction temperature, and metal-support interactions affect the performance of supported Pt catalysts. It shows proper calcination before reduction improves Pt/BN catalytic performance compared to just reduction. It reveals direct reduction leads to more exposed Pt active sites based on CO chemisorption data, but lower propane conversion than calcination plus reduction. The article proposes structural models showing calcination causes partial encapsulation of Pt particles by boron oxide overlayers, which helps explain the improved selectivity.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章研究了类似煅烧温度、还原温度和金属-载体间相互作用等性质如何影响负载Pt催化剂的性能。它显示在还原之前适当的煅烧可以改善Pt/BN的催化性能,相比于单独还原。它根据CO化学吸附数据透露直接还原导致更多暴露的Pt活性位点,但比煅烧与还原有更低的丙烷转化率。文章提出结构模型显示煅烧导致Pt颗粒被硼氧化物表层部分包裹,这有助于解释提高的选择性。
