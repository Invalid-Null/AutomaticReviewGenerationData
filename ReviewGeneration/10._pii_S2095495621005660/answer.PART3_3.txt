[1] "The Pt/BN catalyst with a targeted Pt loading of 0.5 wt% was prepared by impregnating h-BN (25 m2 g1, Aladdin, Shanghai) with aqueous Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Sino-Platinum, Kunming) solution." 

[2] "To further examine the effect of catalyst calcination and reduction on the Pt dispersion, we conducted the Pt particle size statistics based on the HAADF-STEM images (Figs. S1 and S2), and the average sizes of Pt are summarized in Fig. 2(c)."

[3] "Interestingly, almost all Pt/BN catalysts undergoing different calcination and reduction treatments have the similar Pt size, except that too high calcination or reduction temperatures lead to obvious Pt growth."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It prepares Pt/BN catalysts with 0.5 wt% Pt loading by impregnating boron nitride support with Pt precursor solution. It conducts particle size analysis using STEM to examine the effect of calcination and reduction on Pt dispersion. The results show similar Pt size for most preparation conditions, except too high calcination/reduction temperatures cause Pt growth.

[1] "The discharge gas during catalyst calcination was monitored, as shown in Fig. 3(a). It can be observed that the release of NOx derived from the oxidative decomposition of the Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor under O2 atmosphere occurs in 180–280 °C, while the release of H2O continues to 500 °C."

[2] "In a control experiment under H2 atmosphere, the reduction and decomposition of the Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor occur below 250 °C, and ammonia is the major N-containing product."

[3] "The CO-DRIFTS were conducted to further investigate the structural and electronic properties of Pt on the Pt/BN catalysts undergoing different treatments."

[1] "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were taken on an FEI Tecnai G2F30 or G220 microscope using different modes with the maximum operating voltage of 200 kV." 

[2] "Fig. 3(b) shows the HRTEM image of the Pt/BN-R, in which clear boundary of Pt particle supported on the BN support can be observed. Instead, the partial encapsulation of Pt particle by calcination-induced BOx overlayers can be observed on the Pt/BN-C&R (Fig. 3c)."

[3] "The HRTEM shows that the average size of Pt particles on the Pt/BN after ten reaction-regeneration cycles (Fig. 4d) just increased very slightly compared with that on the fresh sample (Fig. 2c and Fig. S1)."
