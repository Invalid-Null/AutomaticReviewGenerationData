 Unfortunately this literature does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 or supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation. The article solely focuses on investigating Pt supported on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) for propane dehydrogenation.

<quotes>
[1] "It has been found that the Pt/BN catalyst undergoing calcination and reduction is highly stable in both PDH reaction and coke-burning regeneration, together with low coke deposition and outstanding propylene selectivity."

[2] "Detailed characterizations demonstrate that the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) induced by calcination and adjusted by reduction is responsible for the high selectivity and stability of Pt/BN in PDH."

[3] "We have revealed that the high coke resistance and high propylene selectivity of the Pt/BN catalyst are derived not only from the absence of acidity on BN support, but also from the calcination-induced and reduction-adjusted SMSI between Pt and BN, which causes the partial encapsulation of Pt particles by BOx overlayers." 

[4] "The BOx overlayers can block the low-coordinated Pt sites and constrain Pt particles into smaller ensembles, suppressing side reactions such as cracking and deep dehydrogenation."

[5] "Moreover, the BOx overlayers can effectively inhibit Pt sintering by the spatial isolation of Pt during periodic reaction-regeneration cycles."

6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like calcination, reduction, and metal-support interactions affect the performance of the Pt/BN catalyst. It is found that calcination induces strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Pt and BN, causing partial encapsulation of Pt particles by BOx overlayers. This suppresses side reactions and coke formation, resulting in high propylene selectivity. The subsequent reduction adjusts the SMSI and improves Pt accessibility. The SMSI also inhibits Pt sintering during periodic regeneration, leading to high stability.

6. 是的,本文研究了煅烧、还原和金属-载体相互作用等因素如何影响Pt/BN催化剂的性能。发现煅烧诱导Pt和BN之间强的金属-载体相互作用(SMSI),导致Pt颗粒被BOx覆盖层部分包覆。这抑制了副反应和焦炭生成,提高了丙烯选择性。随后的还原调整了SMSI并提高了Pt的可及性。SMSI也抑制了Pt在周期性再生过程中的烧结,导致催化剂高稳定性。

[1] "The structural models of Pt/BN catalysts undergoing different treatments are shown in Fig. 3(f) based on the above analysis."

[2] "For the Pt/BN-R without calcination-induced SMSI, the direct reduction leads to the formation of bare Pt particles including large amount of low-coordinated Pt sites, which are very active in CH and CC bond activation and prone to deep reaction, causing more cracking and coking and in turn lower propylene selectivity."

[3] "However, the calcination-induced and reduction-adjusted SMSI between Pt and BN results in partial encapsulation of Pt particles by BOx overlayers on the Pt/BN-C&R. The BOx overlayers might block the low-coordinated Pt sites and constrain Pt particles into smaller ensembles, causing high propylene selectivity."

<English version answer>
7. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the Pt/BN catalysts with different treatments. Without calcination-induced SMSI, bare Pt particles are formed with many low-coordinated sites that activate C-H and C-C bonds, causing cracking and coking. With calcination-induced SMSI adjusted by reduction, Pt particles are partially encapsulated by BOx overlayers. This blocks low-coordinated sites and constrains Pt ensembles, improving selectivity.

7. 是的,本文提出了经不同处理的Pt/BN催化剂上丙烷脱氢的反应机理。如果没有煅烧诱导的SMSI,将形成大量低配位Pt位的裸Pt颗粒,这会激活C-H和C-C键,引起裂化和焦炭生成。如果煅烧诱导的SMSI经还原调整,Pt颗粒会被BOx覆盖层部分包覆。这会阻断低配位Pt位,束缚Pt集聚体,提高选择性。
