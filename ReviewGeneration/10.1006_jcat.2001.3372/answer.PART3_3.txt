<quotes>
[1] "The catalyst surface was analyzed by collecting UVvisible diffuse reflectance spectra through an optical fiber placed in the catalyst bed."
[2] "The fast reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ under propane stream could be detected."  
[3] "Increase in the catalytic activity with the alumina pretreatment temperature was tentatively ascribed to the presence of θ-alumina."
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
25. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. An optical fiber was placed in the catalyst bed to collect spectra during reaction. The reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ was detected, and changes in activity were ascribed to the alumina support structure.
