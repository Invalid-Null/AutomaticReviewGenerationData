<quotes>
[1] "The catalyst surface was analyzed by collecting UVvisible diffuse reflectance spectra through an optical fiber placed in the catalyst bed."

[2] "The fast reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ under propane stream could be detected."

[3] "Increase in the catalytic activity with the alumina pretreatment temperature was tentatively ascribed to the presence of θ-alumina, and decrease in the activity during calcination to incorporation of Cr3+ inside the alumina support."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy through an optical fiber placed inside the catalyst bed to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It detects the fast reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ under propane flow. It also tentatively ascribes increased activity after alumina pretreatment to the presence of theta-alumina, and decreased activity during calcination to incorporation of Cr3+ into the alumina support.

Answer: 是的,本文利用了原位UV-可见漫反射光谱学通过放置于催化剂床内的光纤来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它检测到Cr6+ 在丙烷气流下快速还原为Cr3+。它还暂定地归因于高铝预处理后活性的增加是由于硅铝石的存在,而铝矾石载体中Cr3+的掺入导致了钙化过程中活性的降低。
