<quotes>
[1] "A continuous-flow reactor system with in situ monitoring of the catalyst was developed."

[2] "The catalyst surface was analyzed by collecting UVvisible diffuse reflectance spectra through an optical fiber placed in the catalyst bed."  

[3] "The fast reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ under propane stream could be detected."

[4] "Increase in the catalytic activity with the alumina pretreatment temperature was tentatively ascribed to the presence of θ-alumina, and decrease in the activity during calcination to incorporation of Cr3+ inside the alumina support."
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy through an optical fiber placed inside the catalyst bed to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. This allows detecting the fast reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ under propane flow. It also tentatively ascribes an increase in catalytic activity with alumina pretreatment temperature to the presence of θ-alumina, and a decrease in activity during calcination to incorporation of Cr3+ inside the alumina support.

Answer: 是的,该文章利用了一种通过放置在催化剂床内的光纤进行的原位UV-可见光扩散反射光谱技术来研究正在运行的丙烷脱氢催化剂。这允许检测Cr6+在丙烷流过的条件下快速还原为Cr3+。它还暂时归因于与氧化铝预处理温度增加相关的催化活性的增加是由于θ-氧化铝的存在,而在晶化过程中活性的下降是由于Cr3+掺入氧化铝载体内。
