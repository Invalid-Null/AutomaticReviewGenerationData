<quotes>

[1] "The catalyst surface was analyzed by collecting UVvisible diffuse reflectance spectra through an optical fiber placed in the catalyst bed."

[2] "The fast reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ under propane stream could be detected." 

[3] "Increase in the catalytic activity with the alumina pretreatment temperature was tentatively ascribed to the presence of θ-alumina, and decrease in the activity during calcination to incorporation of Cr3+ inside the alumina support."

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy through an optical fiber placed in the catalyst bed to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It detects the fast reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ under propane flow. It also tentatively ascribes increased activity with higher alumina pretreatment temperature to the presence of θ-alumina, and decreased activity during calcination to incorporation of Cr3+ inside the alumina support.

Answer: 是的,本文利用原位UV-可见漫反射光谱学通过放置在催化剂床中的光纤研究工作中的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它检测到Cr6+在丙烷流下快速还原为Cr3+。它还暂时归因于高温氧化铝前处理温度增加的活性是由于θ-氧化铝的存在,而在煅烧过程中活性的降低是由于Cr3+掺入氧化铝支持体内。
