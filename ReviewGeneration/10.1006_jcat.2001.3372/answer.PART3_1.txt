<quotes>
[1] "The catalyst surface was analyzed by collecting UVvisible diffuse reflectance spectra through an optical fiber placed in the catalyst bed."

[2] "The fast reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ under propane stream could be detected." 

[3] "Increase in the catalytic activity with the alumina pretreatment temperature was tentatively ascribed to the presence of θ-alumina, and decrease in the activity during calcination to incorporation of Cr3+ inside the alumina support."
</quotes>

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy through an optical fiber placed inside the catalyst bed to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It detects the fast reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ under propane flow. It also tentatively ascribes increased activity after alumina pretreatment to the presence of theta-alumina, and decreased activity after calcination to incorporation of Cr3+ into the alumina support.

4. 是的,该文利用了一根放置在催化剂床内的光纤进行原位UV-可见光漫反射光谱法来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它检测到了Cr6+在丙烷流经时快速还原为Cr3+的过程。它还推测铝预处理后活性的增加是因θ-氧化铝的存在,而烧结后活性的下降是由于Cr3+嵌入氧化铝载体所致。
