 Based on reviewing the document, this article is not directly related to propane dehydrogenation. The document focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (ethane, propane, butane) using CO2 as the oxidant, rather than dehydrogenation of propane specifically. Since the document is not relevant to propane dehydrogenation, I will not enumerate the catalysts or identify the main contribution.
