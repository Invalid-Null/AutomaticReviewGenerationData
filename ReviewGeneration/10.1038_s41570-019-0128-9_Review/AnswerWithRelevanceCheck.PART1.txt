 Unfortunately the provided answers do not contain information relevant to the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts and supported metal catalysts. The answers focus on oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes using CO2, rather than propane dehydrogenation. 

Since the answers are not relevant, my response is:
