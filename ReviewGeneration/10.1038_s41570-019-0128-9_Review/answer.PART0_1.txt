 Unfortunately, the given literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the specific questions about propane dehydrogenation that were posed. The literature focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes like ethane, propane and butane using CO2, and does not discuss propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since there is no relevant content in the literature to quote or summarize, I cannot provide substantive answers to the questions.
