         [1] Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene should be especially mentioned. This reaction is the basis of large-scale propene production using cheap propane from shale/natural gas.

         [2] Propylene (C3H6) is one of the most important basic chemicals and is mainly used for the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, acrylic acid, isopropanol, and oxo-alcohols.

         [1] The article provides background on the importance of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation, stating that it "is the basis of large-scale propene production using cheap propane from shale/natural gas" and that propylene has many applications as it is "one of the most demanded monomers in petrochemical industry for the synthesis of various polymers including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, acrylic acid, polygas chemicals etc." (Introduction, paragraph 1)

         [1] Catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers

         [2] The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the activation energy, stating "To achieve high activity, propene selectivity, on stream stability and durability, researchers have tried to synthesize catalysts with certain structure of supported catalytically active sites/species." (Introduction, paragraph 3) It also describes specific mechanisms, such as "SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2 and CeO2 are typical supports, while catalytically active species are supported noble (e.g. Pt, Pd, Ru, and Rh) or non-noble (e.g. Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn) metals." (Introduction, paragraph 2)

         [1] Commercially applied catalysts are materials with supported Pt or CrOx active species. 

         [2] The focus of the ongoing research in both academia and industry is the development of alternative materials free of such limitations.  

         [3] Recently, we experimentally validated a strategy for developing eco-friendly and cost-efficient bulk catalysts on the basis of ZrO2.

         [3] The article introduces supported metals, metal oxides, alloys and zeolites as catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation. For supported metals it cites "Pt or CrOx active species" and for metal oxides it mentions "ZrO2-based catalysts". (Introduction, paragraphs 1 and 3)

         [1] To overcome thermodynamic limitations (∆G°298K = 124 kJ/mol), the PDH reaction has to be conducted at high temperatures (550–650 °C)" (Introduction, paragraph 1). It also mentions kinetic factors such as the rate determining step, saying "The rate-determining step was concluded to be H2 formation." (Conclusions)
