To explain my analysis:

For each question, I carefully compared the provided answers from each 'answer*.txt' file to the reference correct answer provided. I looked at how well the key points were covered and assessed an approximate percentage consistency between 0-100%. 

For example, for Question 1, answer.PART0_0.txt had 0% consistency since it did not cover the key points about propylene's importance and applications. However, answer.PART0_1.txt fully covered those points so I gave it 100% consistency.

I used my best judgment in assigning consistency percentages between those extremes based on the level of overlap with the key ideas from the correct answer. There is some subjectivity here, but I aimed to quantify the consistency as accurately and fairly as possible.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
