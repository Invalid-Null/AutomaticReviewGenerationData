[1] Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene should be especially mentioned. This reaction is the basis of large-scale propene production using cheap propane from shale/natural gas.

[2] Commercially applied catalysts are materials with supported Pt or CrOx active species. They, however, suffer from high costs or toxicity of the active components. The focus of the ongoing research in both academia and industry is the development of alternative materials free of such limitations.

[3] Recently, we experimentally validated a strategy for developing eco-friendly and cost-efficient bulk catalysts on the basis of ZrO2. Surface defect sites but not supported structures were concluded to participate in propane dehydrogenation to propene. 

[4] The active site for PDH over bare ZrO2 is two Zr*_cus* located at O*_v* [Zrcus = coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations; Ov = oxygen vacancy]. The rate-determining step was concluded to be H2 formation.

[1] In order to understand why the selectivity to propene and coke is affected by Rh loading, we prepared Rh/SiO2 catalysts possessing the same Rh NPs as in the Rh/ZrO2 catalysts and tested them for C3H6 adsorption. 

[2] To derive deeper fundamental insights into the promoting effect of Rh on the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen, we applied DFT calculations.

[3] To get experimental support for this assumption, we performed CO-TPD tests to titrate Zrcus sites. It is known that CO adsorbs on such sites.

[4] To check if Rh can positively affect the rate of propene formation through improvement of H2 desorption, we performed DFT calculations. 

[5] They were also aimed at understanding the fundamentals responsible for the volcano-type dependence of the rate of propene formation over Rh/ZrO2 on Rh loading or on the degree of removed lattice oxygen.

<English version answer>

5. Yes, the article describes how DFT calculations were applied to study the effect of Rh loading on ZrO2 reducibility [2], CO adsorption on coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites [3], and H2 desorption energies [4-5].

[1] Regardless of the number of Rh atoms on the ZrO2(111) surface, this metal also promotes the formation of multiple Ov centers, as seen from the corresponding energies shown in Table S3. 

[2] The obtained results enable us to safely conclude that H2 consumption in H2-TPR tests with Rh/ZrO2 catalysts is mainly due to removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2.

[3] For the Rh1/ZrO2 model, one Rh atom preferentially adsorbs on an O hollow site (containing two O2 anions and Zr4+ cation) on the ZrO2(111) surface with a cohesive energy of 3.17 eV.

[1] Catalysts with supported metal(s) are widely used in various heterogeneous reactions, such as hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, re-forming reactions, CO oxidation, CO2 hydrogenation to CH4 or higher hydrocarbons, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, etc. 

[2] Commercially applied catalysts are materials with supported Pt or CrOx active species. They, however, suffer from high costs or toxicity of the active components. 

[3] The focus of the ongoing research in both academia and industry is the development of alternative materials free of such limitations.

[4] To ensure high activity, propene selectivity, on stream stability, and durability, researchers have tried to synthesize catalysts with a certain structure of supported catalytically active sites/species.

[5] There are often no straightforward methods to generate such specific structures where atoms would be arranged in a predetermined way. 

[6] Moreover, even when such structures have been created, they have been found to alter under the severe reaction conditions (high temperature) required for the PDH reaction.

[7] Recently, we experimentally validated a strategy for developing eco-friendly and cost-efficient bulk catalysts on the basis of ZrO2.

[8] Surface defect sites but not supported structures were concluded to participate in propane dehydrogenation to propene.

1. The article provides background that propane dehydrogenation is an important industrial process for producing propylene, which is a valuable feedstock for plastics and chemicals. It states that supported metal catalysts like Pt and CrOx are commonly used, but there are concerns about cost and toxicity. Recent research has focused on developing alternative catalysts without these limitations. The article describes efforts to synthesize catalysts with specific active site structures, but this has proven challenging. It introduces bulk ZrO2 catalysts with surface defects as a promising eco-friendly and low cost option where the active sites are not distinct supported metal entities.

[1] According to our recent DFT calculations with bare ZrO2, two neighboring Zr cations (Zrcus) located at an oxygen vacancy were suggested to form the active site. Their concentration was established to depend on the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen. 

[2] This catalyst property can be purposefully tuned through (i) the ZrO2 preparation method, (ii) the nanostructure of ZrO2 crystallites and the kind of ZrO2 phase, (iii) doping of ZrO2 with La2O3, Y2O3, or Sm2O3, or (iv) the deposition of a metal (Cu, Ru or Rh) on the surface of ZrO2.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article explains that DFT calculations have shown the active site in ZrO2 catalysts is two neighboring Zr cations with dangling bonds created by an oxygen vacancy. The concentration of these sites depends on the reducibility of ZrO2. Reducibility can be tuned by preparation method, crystallite size/phase, dopants, or depositing metals like Cu, Ru, and Rh.

2. 这篇文章解释了DFT计算已经显示ZrO2催化剂中的活性位点是两个相邻的Zr阳离子,它们由氧空隙产生的悬挂键。这些位点的浓度取决于ZrO2的可还原性。可还原性可以通过制备方法、晶粒尺寸/相态、掺杂剂或者镀积Cu、Ru和Rh等金属来调节。

[1] According to our previous works, the most stable surface m-ZrO2(111) termination with OZrO was modeled by a p(2 × 2) nine-atomic-layer supercell with the bottom three layers being fixed and the top six layers being relaxed. 

[2] The lateral supercell containing a vacuum space of 15 Å between the slab and its periodic images was used. 

[3] The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 2 × 2 × 1 MonkhorstPack mesh.
