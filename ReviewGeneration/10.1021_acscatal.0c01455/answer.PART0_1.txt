[1] Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction is the basis of large-scale propene production using cheap propane from shale/natural gas. 

[2] Propylene (C3H6) is one of the most important basic chemicals and is mainly used for the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, acrylic acid, isopropanol, and oxo-alcohols.

[3] The focus of the ongoing research in both academia and industry is the development of alternative materials free of such limitations.

[4] To ensure high activity, propene selectivity, on stream stability, and durability, researchers have tried to synthesize catalysts with a certain structure of supported catalytically active sites/species.

[1] In order to understand why the selectivity to propene and coke is affected by Rh loading, we prepared Rh/SiO2 catalysts possessing the same Rh NPs as in the Rh/ZrO2 catalysts and tested them for C3H6 adsorption. 

[2] To derive deeper fundamental insights into the promoting effect of Rh on the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen, we applied DFT calculations.

[3] To get experimental support for this assumption, we performed CO-TPD tests to titrate Zrcus sites. It is known that CO adsorbs on such sites.

[4] To check if Rh can positively affect the rate of propene formation through improvement of H2 desorption, we performed DFT calculations. 

[5] They were also aimed at understanding the fundamentals responsible for the volcano-type dependence of the rate of propene formation over Rh/ZrO2 on Rh loading or on the degree of removed lattice oxygen.

5. Yes, the article describes how DFT calculations were applied to study the effect of Rh loading on ZrO2 reducibility [2], CO adsorption on coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites [3], and H2 desorption energies [4-5]. These provide insights into promotion effects of Rh, and the causes of the volcano-type activity dependence on Rh loading.

[1] Regardless of the number of Rh atoms on the ZrO2(111) surface, this metal also promotes the formation of multiple Ov centers, as seen from the corresponding energies shown in Table S3. 

[2] The obtained results enable us to safely conclude that H2 consumption in H2-TPR tests with Rh/ZrO2 catalysts is mainly due to removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2.

[3] For the Rh1/ZrO2 model, one Rh atom preferentially adsorbs on an O hollow site (containing two O2 anions and Zr4+ cation) on the ZrO2(111) surface with a cohesive energy of 3.17 eV.
