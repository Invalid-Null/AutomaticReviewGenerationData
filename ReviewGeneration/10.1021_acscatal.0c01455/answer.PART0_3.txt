[1] Catalysts with supported metal(s) are widely used in various heterogeneous reactions, such as hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, re-forming reactions, CO oxidation, CO2 hydrogenation to CH4 or higher hydrocarbons, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, etc. 

[2] Commercially applied catalysts are materials with supported Pt or CrOx active species. They, however, suffer from high costs or toxicity of the active components. 

[3] The focus of the ongoing research in both academia and industry is the development of alternative materials free of such limitations.

[4] To ensure high activity, propene selectivity, on stream stability, and durability, researchers have tried to synthesize catalysts with a certain structure of supported catalytically active sites/species.

[5] There are often no straightforward methods to generate such specific structures where atoms would be arranged in a predetermined way. 

[6] Moreover, even when such structures have been created, they have been found to alter under the severe reaction conditions (high temperature) required for the PDH reaction.

[7] Recently, we experimentally validated a strategy for developing eco-friendly and cost-efficient bulk catalysts on the basis of ZrO2.

[8] Surface defect sites but not supported structures were concluded to participate in propane dehydrogenation to propene.

1. The article provides background that propane dehydrogenation is an important industrial process for producing propylene, which is a valuable feedstock for plastics and chemicals. It states that supported metal catalysts like Pt and CrOx are commonly used, but there are concerns about cost and toxicity. Recent research has focused on developing alternative catalysts without these limitations. The article describes efforts to synthesize catalysts with specific active site structures, but this has proven challenging. It introduces bulk ZrO2 catalysts with surface defects as a promising eco-friendly and low cost option where the active sites are not distinct supported metal entities.

1. 这篇文章提供了丙烷脱氢是产生丙烯的一个重要的工业过程的背景,丙烯是塑料和化学品的重要原料。它指出,Pt和CrOx等支持的金属催化剂通常被使用,但存在成本和毒性的问题。最近的研究聚焦于开发没有这些局限性的代催化剂。这篇文章描述了合成具有特定活性位点结构的催化剂的努力,但这证明具有挑战性。它引入了具有表面缺陷的ZrO2大块催化剂,作为一个有希望的环保且低成本的选择,其中活性位点不是不同的支持的金属实体。

[1] According to our recent DFT calculations with bare ZrO2, two neighboring Zr cations (Zrcus) located at an oxygen vacancy were suggested to form the active site. Their concentration was established to depend on the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen. 

[2] This catalyst property can be purposefully tuned through (i) the ZrO2 preparation method, (ii) the nanostructure of ZrO2 crystallites and the kind of ZrO2 phase, (iii) doping of ZrO2 with La2O3, Y2O3, or Sm2O3, or (iv) the deposition of a metal (Cu, Ru or Rh) on the surface of ZrO2.

2. The article explains that DFT calculations have shown the active site in ZrO2 catalysts is two neighboring Zr cations with dangling bonds created by an oxygen vacancy. The concentration of these sites depends on the reducibility of ZrO2. Reducibility can be tuned by preparation method, crystallite size/phase, dopants, or depositing metals like Cu, Ru, and Rh.

2. 这篇文章解释了DFT计算已经显示ZrO2催化剂中的活性位点是两个相邻的Zr阳离子,它们由氧空隙产生的悬挂键。这些位点的浓度取决于ZrO2的可还原性。可还原性可以通过制备方法、晶粒尺寸/相态、掺杂剂或者镀积Cu、Ru和Rh等金属来调节。

[1] According to our previous works, the most stable surface m-ZrO2(111) termination with OZrO was modeled by a p(2 × 2) nine-atomic-layer supercell with the bottom three layers being fixed and the top six layers being relaxed. 

[2] The lateral supercell containing a vacuum space of 15 Å between the slab and its periodic images was used. 

[3] The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 2 × 2 × 1 MonkhorstPack mesh. 

[4] Since XRD analysis (Figure S1) proved that Rh/ZrO2 catalysts are composed of the monoclinic ZrO2 (m-ZrO2) phase, we constructed our ZrO2 models based on this phase.
