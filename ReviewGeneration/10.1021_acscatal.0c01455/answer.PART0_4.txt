1. The article provides background on the importance of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation, stating that it "is the basis of large-scale propene production using cheap propane from shale/natural gas" and that propylene has many applications as it is "one of the most demanded monomers in petrochemical industry for the synthesis of various polymers including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, acrylic acid, polygas chemicals etc." (Introduction, paragraph 1)

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the activation energy, stating "To achieve high activity, propene selectivity, on stream stability and durability, researchers have tried to synthesize catalysts with certain structure of supported catalytically active sites/species." (Introduction, paragraph 3) It also describes specific mechanisms, such as "SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2 and CeO2 are typical supports, while catalytically active species are supported noble (e.g. Pt, Pd, Ru, and Rh) or non-noble (e.g. Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn) metals." (Introduction, paragraph 2)

3. The article introduces supported metals, metal oxides, alloys and zeolites as catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation. For supported metals it cites "Pt or CrOx active species" and for metal oxides it mentions "ZrO2-based catalysts". (Introduction, paragraphs 1 and 3)

4. The article discusses thermodynamic constraints, stating "To overcome thermodynamic limitations (∆G°298K = 124 kJ/mol), the PDH reaction has to be conducted at high temperatures (550–650 °C)" (Introduction, paragraph 1). It also mentions kinetic factors such as the rate determining step, saying "The rate-determining step was concluded to be H2 formation." (Conclusions)

5. The article extensively describes the use of DFT calculations to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways. For example, it states "To derive deeper fundamental insights into the promoting effect of Rh on the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen, we applied DFT calculations." (Results and Discussion, Effect of Rh on Redox Properties of ZrO2)

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics.

7. The article describes computational and experimental work identifying structure-activity relationships. For example, it states "Thorough mechanistic and kinetic tests were complemented by detailed catalyst characterization by means of multiple state of the art characterization techniques. Furthermore, DFT calculations were carried out to elucidate the effects of Rh and the reduction degree of ZrO2 on individual reaction pathways at a molecular level." (Introduction, paragraph 5)
