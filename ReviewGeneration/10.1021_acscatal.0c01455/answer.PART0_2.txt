 Here are the relevant quotes and answers:

<quotes>

[1] Propene primarily formed from propane is further converted into coke and cracking products. Coke can additionally be formed from propane. 

[2] Commercially applied catalysts are materials with supported Pt or CrOx active species. They, however, suffer from high costs or toxicity of the active components. The focus of the ongoing research in both academia and industry is the development of alternative materials free of such limitations.

[3] Ru/YZrOx from our previous study (1.34 vs 1.07 mmol g-1 min-1).

[4] Two neighboring coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) located at an oxygen vacancy were suggested to form the active site.

[5] No relevant quotes

[6] No relevant quotes

[7] Relevant descriptors that correlate catalyst properties to propane dehydrogenation performance found in the literature include:
- Presence of zirconium cation vacancies 
- Reducibility of the zirconium oxide support
- Hydrogen activation ability of promoted metals like rhodium
- Interactions between active metal species and the support

<English version answer>

1. According to Quote [1], propene formed from propane can be converted into coke and cracking products. Coke can also form directly from propane.

2. Quote [2] states commercially used catalysts contain expensive platinum or toxic chromium oxide. Ongoing research aims to find alternative catalysts without these issues.  

3. Quote [3] gives an example of an alternative zirconium oxide catalyst with promoted ruthenium active sites.

4. Quote [4] says two neighboring vacant zirconium sites at oxygen vacancies are thought to be the active site.

5. No relevant quotes discussing thermodynamic constraints.

6. No relevant quotes discussing microkinetic modeling.

7. Quote [7] lists catalyst descriptors like zirconium vacancies, metal reducibility and hydrogen activation ability that correlate with propane dehydrogenation performance.
