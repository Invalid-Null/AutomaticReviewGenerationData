[1] Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene should be especially mentioned. This reaction is the basis of large-scale propene production using cheap propane from shale/natural gas.

[2] Commercially applied catalysts are materials with supported Pt or CrOx active species. They, however, suffer from high costs or toxicity of the active components. The focus of the ongoing research in both academia and industry is the development of alternative materials free of such limitations.

[3] Recently, we experimentally validated a strategy for developing eco-friendly and cost-efficient bulk catalysts on the basis of ZrO2. Surface defect sites but not supported structures were concluded to participate in propane dehydrogenation to propene. 

[4] The active site for PDH over bare ZrO2 is two Zr*_cus* located at O*_v* [Zrcus = coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations; Ov = oxygen vacancy]. The rate-determining step was concluded to be H2 formation.

1. The article provides background on the importance of propylene production from propane dehydrogenation, which is used commercially to make propylene from cheap propane feedstocks. It states this is the basis for large-scale propylene production. The article mentions that current commercial catalysts use expensive Pt or toxic CrOx, so there is interest in alternative catalysts without those limitations.
