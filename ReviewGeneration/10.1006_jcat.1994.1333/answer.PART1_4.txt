<quotes>
[1] "The addition of sulphur to Pt/alumina catalysts, both in the preparation stage and in the gas phase during reaction, has been investigated as to the effect on catalyst activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Predosing at 873 K had the largest effect on selectivity, allowing the formation of propene from the first pulse of propane, whereas cofeeding required the build-up of sulphur on the surface before selectivity was achieved."

[3] "Adding sulphur into the catalyst preparation was more effective than subsequent addition from the gas phase."  

[4] "The presence of a hydrogen reservoir on the catalyst, which was available for reaction, was detected using catalysts reduced in deuterium."

[5] "The results also indicated that hydrogen from adsorbed hydrogen sulphide could react with hydrocarbon fragments on the catalyst surface to produce methane."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt/alumina catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It investigates the effect of adding sulfur during catalyst preparation and during the reaction on activity and selectivity. Predosing the catalyst with H2S at 873 K had the largest effect on improving selectivity towards propene formation. Adding sulfur during preparation was more effective than subsequent addition. The article also proposes mechanistic pathways involving hydrogen transfer from adsorbed H2S to hydrocarbon fragments to produce methane.

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,该文评价了负载的单金属Pt/氧化铝催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它研究了在催化剂制备和反应过程中添加硫的效果对活性和选择性的影响。在873K时用H2S预处理催化剂对提高向丙烯形成的选择性有最大的效果。在制备中添加硫比后续添加更有效。该文还提出了机理途径,涉及从吸附的H2S向烃片段转移氢以生成甲烷。
