<quotes>
[1] "The addition of sulphur to Pt/alumina catalysts, both in the preparation stage and in the gas phase during reaction, has been investigated as to the effect on catalyst activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "The sole hydrocarbon product produced from pulses of propane over a freshly reduced Pt/alumina catalyst at 873 K in the absence of sulphur was methane, with concomitant carbon laydown."

[3] "Predosing at 873 K had the largest effect on selectivity, allowing the formation of propene from the first pulse of propane, whereas cofeeding required the build-up of sulphur on the surface before selectivity was achieved."  

[4] "Adding sulphur into the catalyst preparation was more effective than subsequent addition from the gas phase."  

[5] "The results also indicated that the selectivity observed was not directly related to the amount of sulphur on the surface."

[6] "The presence of a hydrogen reservoir on the catalyst, which was available for reaction, was detected using catalysts reduced in deuterium."

[7] "The results also indicated that hydrogen from adsorbed hydrogen sulphide could react with hydrocarbon fragments on the catalyst surface to produce methane."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported monometallic Pt catalysts on alumina for propane dehydrogenation. It investigates the effects of adding sulfur during catalyst preparation and to the feed gas during reaction. Data shows that adding sulfur modulates selectivity from only methane to propylene. Insights are provided into sulfur effects depending on method and timing of addition. Reduced catalysts are found to contain a hydrogen reservoir that can facilitate undesired reactions.

<English version answer> 
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like sulfur coverage affect the performance of the supported Pt catalyst. Insights are provided that selectivity depends on sulfur loading timing and method, rather than absolute amount. Adding sulfur during preparation is more effective than during reaction.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章研究了类似硫覆盖度等性质如何影响负载Pt催化剂的性能。提供了选择性取决于加载硫的时机和方法,而不是绝对量的见解。在制备期间添加硫比在反应期间添加硫更有效。

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes some mechanistic insights into propane dehydrogenation pathways over the Pt/alumina catalysts. Without sulfur, complete dehydrogenation to carbon and methane occurs. Sulfur modulates selectivity to propylene, and its effects build up during reaction. The reduced catalyst surface contains hydrogen that can facilitate undesired hydrogenation reactions.

<Chinese version answer> 
答:是的,文章对Pt/氧化铝催化剂上的丙烷脱氢途径提出了一些机理见解。在没有硫的情况下,会发生完全脱氢生成碳和甲烷。硫可以调节对丙烯的选择性,其效果会在反应过程中积累。还原的催化剂表面包含可以促进不需要的加氢反应的氢。
