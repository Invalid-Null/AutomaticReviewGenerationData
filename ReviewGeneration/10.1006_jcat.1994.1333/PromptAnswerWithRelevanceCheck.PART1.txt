[1] "The addition of sulphur to Pt/alumina catalysts, both in the preparation stage and in the gas phase during reaction, has been investigated as to the effect on catalyst activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "The sole hydrocarbon product produced from pulses of propane over a freshly reduced Pt/alumina catalyst at 873 K in the absence of sulphur was methane, with concomitant carbon laydown."

[3] "The effect on activity and selectivity of predosing the catalyst with hydrogen sulphide at 293 and 873 K was examined, as was the effect of cofeeding at ratios of 1:10 and 10:1 H2S:C3H8."  

[4] "Predosing at 873 K had the largest effect on selectivity, allowing the formation of propene from the first pulse of propane, whereas cofeeding required the build-up of sulphur on the surface before selectivity was achieved."

[5] "Adding sulphur into the catalyst preparation was more effective than subsequent addition from the gas phase."  

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt/alumina catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It investigates the effect of adding sulfur during catalyst preparation and to the feed gas during reaction on activity and selectivity. Without sulfur, propane pulses over freshly reduced Pt/alumina at 873K produce only methane. Predosing with H2S, especially at 873K, allowed propene formation from the first pulse, while co-feeding required sulfur build-up first. Adding sulfur during preparation was more effective than during reaction.   
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,本文评估了负载单金属Pt/氧化铝催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它研究了在制备和反应过程中向反应气体中添加硫的效果。没有硫,873K下新制备的Pt/氧化铝只能将丙烷脉冲转化为甲烷。事先用H2S处理,特别是在873K下,可以在第一次脉冲就产生丙烯,而共馏需要先聚积硫。添加硫的制备方法比反应过程中添加更有效。

5. Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt/alumina catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It investigates the effect of adding sulfur during catalyst preparation and to the feed gas on activity and selectivity. Without sulfur, propane dehydrogenation over fresh Pt/alumina at 873K produces only methane. Adding sulfur allows propene formation. Incorporating sulfur during preparation is more effective than adding it to the feed gas. The article also detects the presence of a hydrogen reservoir on the catalyst that can produce methane.

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported monometallic Pt catalysts on alumina for propane dehydrogenation. It investigates the effects of adding sulfur during catalyst preparation and to the feed gas during reaction. Data shows that adding sulfur modulates selectivity from only methane to propylene. Insights are provided into sulfur effects depending on method and timing of addition. Reduced catalysts are found to contain a hydrogen reservoir that can facilitate undesired reactions.

答:是的,文章评估了负载在氧化铝上的单金属Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它研究了在催化剂制备和反应期间向反应物料气中添加硫的效果。数据显示,添加硫可以将选择性从只有甲烷调制为丙烯。提供了根据添加方法和时机不同的硫效应的见解。发现还原的催化剂中含有可以促进不需要的反应的氢储库。

<English version answer> 
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like sulfur coverage affect the performance of the supported Pt catalyst. Insights are provided that selectivity depends on sulfur loading timing and method, rather than absolute amount. Adding sulfur during preparation is more effective than during reaction.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章研究了类似硫覆盖度等性质如何影响负载Pt催化剂的性能。提供了选择性取决于加载硫的时机和方法,而不是绝对量的见解。在制备期间添加硫比在反应期间添加硫更有效。

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes some mechanistic insights into propane dehydrogenation pathways over the Pt/alumina catalysts. Without sulfur, complete dehydrogenation to carbon and methane occurs. Sulfur modulates selectivity to propylene, and its effects build up during reaction. The reduced catalyst surface contains hydrogen that can facilitate undesired hydrogenation reactions.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 
答:是的,文章对Pt/氧化铝催化剂上的丙烷脱氢途径提出了一些机理见解。在没有硫的情况下,会发生完全脱氢生成碳和甲烷。硫可以调节对丙烯的选择性,其效果会在反应过程中积累。还原的催化剂表面包含可以促进不需要的加氢反应的氢。
