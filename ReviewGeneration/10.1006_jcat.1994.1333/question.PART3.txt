I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

The Effect of Sulfur on the Nonsteady State Reaction of Propane over a Platinum/Alumina Catalyst at 873 K
Abstract
The addition of sulphur to Pt/alumina catalysts, both in the preparation stage and in the gas phase during reaction, has been investigated as to the effect on catalyst activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation. The sole hydrocarbon product produced from pulses of propane over a freshly reduced Pt/alumina catalyst at 873 K in the absence of sulphur was methane, with concomitant carbon laydown. The effect on activity and selectivity of predosing the catalyst with hydrogen sulphide at 293 and 873 K was examined, as was the effect of cofeeding at ratios of 1:10 and 10:1 H2S:C3H8. Predosing at 873 K had the largest effect on selectivity, allowing the formation of propene from the first pulse of propane, whereas cofeeding required the build-up of sulphur on the surface before selectivity was achieved. Adding sulphur into the catalyst preparation was more effective than subsequent addition from the gas phase. The results also indicated that the selectivity observed was not directly related to the amount of sulphur on the surface. The presence of a hydrogen reservoir on the catalyst, which was available for reaction, was detected using catalysts reduced in deuterium. The results also indicated that hydrogen from adsorbed hydrogen sulphide could react with hydrocarbon fragments on the catalyst surface to produce methane.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
