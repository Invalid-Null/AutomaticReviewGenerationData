<quotes>
[1] "The addition of sulphur to Pt/alumina catalysts, both in the preparation stage and in the gas phase during reaction, has been investigated as to the effect on catalyst activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "The sole hydrocarbon product produced from pulses of propane over a freshly reduced Pt/alumina catalyst at 873 K in the absence of sulphur was methane, with concomitant carbon laydown."

[3] "The effect on activity and selectivity of predosing the catalyst with hydrogen sulphide at 293 and 873 K was examined, as was the effect of cofeeding at ratios of 1:10 and 10:1 H2S:C3H8."  

[4] "Adding sulphur into the catalyst preparation was more effective than subsequent addition from the gas phase."

[5] "The presence of a hydrogen reservoir on the catalyst, which was available for reaction, was detected using catalysts reduced in deuterium." 

[6] "The results also indicated that hydrogen from adsorbed hydrogen sulphide could react with hydrocarbon fragments on the catalyst surface to produce methane."

5. Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt/alumina catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It investigates the effect of adding sulfur during catalyst preparation and to the feed gas on activity and selectivity. Without sulfur, propane dehydrogenation over fresh Pt/alumina at 873K produces only methane. Adding sulfur allows propene formation. Incorporating sulfur during preparation is more effective than adding it to the feed gas. The article also detects the presence of a hydrogen reservoir on the catalyst that can produce methane.

5. 是的,本文评价了Pt/氧化铝单金属受支撑催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它研究了在催化剂制备和给料中添加硫对活性和选择性的影响。没有硫的存在,873K下新制备的Pt/氧化铝催化剂上丙烷脱氢仅产生甲烷。添加硫可以产生丙烯。将硫掺入制备中比添加到给料气体中更有效。本文还检测到催化剂上存在可以产生甲烷的氢储存。
