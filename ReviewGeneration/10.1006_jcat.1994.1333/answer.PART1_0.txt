<quotes>
[1] "The addition of sulphur to Pt/alumina catalysts, both in the preparation stage and in the gas phase during reaction, has been investigated as to the effect on catalyst activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "The sole hydrocarbon product produced from pulses of propane over a freshly reduced Pt/alumina catalyst at 873 K in the absence of sulphur was methane, with concomitant carbon laydown."

[3] "The effect on activity and selectivity of predosing the catalyst with hydrogen sulphide at 293 and 873 K was examined, as was the effect of cofeeding at ratios of 1:10 and 10:1 H2S:C3H8."  

[4] "Predosing at 873 K had the largest effect on selectivity, allowing the formation of propene from the first pulse of propane, whereas cofeeding required the build-up of sulphur on the surface before selectivity was achieved."

[5] "Adding sulphur into the catalyst preparation was more effective than subsequent addition from the gas phase."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt/alumina catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It investigates the effect of adding sulfur during catalyst preparation and to the feed gas during reaction on activity and selectivity. Without sulfur, propane pulses over freshly reduced Pt/alumina at 873K produce only methane. Predosing with H2S, especially at 873K, allowed propene formation from the first pulse, while co-feeding required sulfur build-up first. Adding sulfur during preparation was more effective than during reaction.

Answer: 是的,本文评估了负载单金属Pt/氧化铝催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它研究了在制备和反应过程中向反应气体中添加硫的效果。没有硫,873K下新制备的Pt/氧化铝只能将丙烷脉冲转化为甲烷。事先用H2S处理,特别是在873K下,可以在第一次脉冲就产生丙烯,而共馏需要先聚积硫。添加硫的制备方法比反应过程中添加更有效。

<quotes>
[1] "The presence of a hydrogen reservoir on the catalyst, which was available for reaction, was detected using catalysts reduced in deuterium."

[2] "The results also indicated that hydrogen from adsorbed hydrogen sulphide could react with hydrocarbon fragments on the catalyst surface to produce methane."
</quotes>

<English version answer> 
Answer: Yes, the article proposes some mechanistic insights into propane dehydrogenation over the Pt/alumina catalysts. It detects the presence of a hydrogen reservoir on the catalyst from deuterium reduction, which can react with hydrocarbon fragments to make methane. It also proposes hydrogen from adsorbed H2S can react with fragments to produce methane. But no complete reaction pathways are described.

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,本文对Pt/氧化铝催化剂上的丙烷脱氢机理有一些见解。它通过在氘气中还原检测到催化剂上存在可以参与反应的氢储备,这些氢可以与碳氢化合物片段反应生成甲烷。它还提出吸附的H2S中的氢也可以与碳氢化合物片段反应生成甲烷。但是没有描述完整的反应途径。
