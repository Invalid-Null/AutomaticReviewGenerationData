To generate the consistency ratios, I carefully compared the answer text from each file to the correct answers for each question. I looked for semantic equivalence to determine if the answers matched the correct response, and assigned percentages accordingly. Where there was no relevant answer text provided or the answer did not match the correct response, I assigned 0%. For partially relevant/matching answers, I assigned 50%. For fully equivalent answers, I assigned 100%. This produces a percentage that reflects the consistency between each answer file and the ground truth.
