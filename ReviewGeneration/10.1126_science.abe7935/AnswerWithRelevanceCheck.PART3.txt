         Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single boron sites in zeolitic supports. Specifically, it discusses the synthesis of the BS-1 catalyst using a solvent-free crystallization method with TPA+ hydroxide at 180°C for 3 days, followed by calcination to obtain a zeolite with an Si/B ratio of 62 and isolated boron sites. XRD, SEM, and elemental mapping showed the zeolite structure and uniform boron dispersion. Zhou et al.'s work on synthesizing boron-doped silicate zeolites with isolated boron sites is also mentioned.
