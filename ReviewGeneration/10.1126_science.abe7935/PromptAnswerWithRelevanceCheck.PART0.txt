<Answer>

 Unfortunately the literature provided does not contain any relevant information to answer the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation kinetics, mechanisms, thermodynamics, computational studies, microkinetic modeling, or structure-activity relationships. The literature focuses on the synthesis and characterization of a new boron-containing zeolite catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
