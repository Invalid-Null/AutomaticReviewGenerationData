<quotes>

[1] "Further reaction for longer times led to increased propane conversion, reaching 42.6% at 148 hours, whereas the olefin selectivity was almost unchanged."

[2] "Even after reaction for 210 hours, the catalyst still exhibited propane conversion at 43.7%, with propene and ethene selectivities at 53.3 and 29.5%, respectively, showing the good durability of the BS-1 catalyst in the ODHP."

[3] "The zeolite structure was maintained and boron leaching was almost negligible in the reaction for 208 hours, as confirmed by the ICP analysis, N2 sorption, XRD pattern, SEM images, and TEM images of the used catalyst."

4. Answer: Yes, the article summarizes remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenationysis. It notes the need for improved catalyst durability, stating that current catalysts require frequent regeneration due to issues like coking and metal sintering. The new BS-1 zeolite catalyst is shown to have good durability, maintaining consistent conversion and selectivity even after 210 hours of continuous operation. But further improvements in long-term stability are still needed.

4. 答:是的,文章总结了丙烷脱氢催化剂存在的挑战和知识空白。它指出需要提高催化剂持久性,现有催化剂需要频繁再生是由于焦炭形成和金属烧结等问题。新研发的BS-1沸石催化剂表现出良好的持久性,即使连续反应210小时转化率和选择性依然保持一致。但长期稳定性方面仍需进一步改进。
