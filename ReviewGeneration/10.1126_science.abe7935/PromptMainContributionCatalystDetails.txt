Isolated boron in zeolite for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane

Isolating and stabilizing boron
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane can produce propene from shale gas and help to replace petroleum as a propene feedstock. Boron-based catalysts can have high selectivity to propene, but the water by-product can deactivate the catalyst by hydrolyzing boron. Zhou et al. synthesized boron-doped silicate zeolites containing isolated boron sites that were stable against hydrolysis. The catalyst could achieve one-pass propane conversions up to ∼44% with selectivities for propene and >80% for ethene. They observed no deactivation after a 210-hour continuous test.

Abstract
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a key technology for producing propene from shale gas, but conventional metal oxide catalysts are prone to overoxidation to form valueless COx. Boron-based catalysts were recently found to be selective for this reaction, and B–O–B oligomers are generally regarded as active centers. We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the B–O–SiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test. Furthermore, we demonstrate an isolated boron with a –B[OH…O(H)–Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolite as the active center, which enables the activation of oxygen and a carbon–hydrogen bond to catalyze the ODHP.

Propene (1–4) has been extensively used as a building unit for the production of plastics, fibers, and intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals. The current method for propene production predominantly relies on the steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha, but production using this method is still far from meeting the demands for propene, ~116,000,000 tons in 2020. Recently, shale gas, which contains abundant propane, has been regarded as a promising source for propene to reduce dependence on petroleum. Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as industrial technologies such as Oleflex by Honeywell UOP and Catofin by ABB Lumus (1, 2, 5–9) have been developed, but these have insufficient lifetimes because of thermodynamically favorable coke formation and metal sintering, which require frequent catalyst regeneration. By contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has substantial advantages regarding exothermic features and hindrance of coke formation but is easily overoxidized to form valueless CO2 (10–18), and this remains a challenge for practical applications. One solution to this issue is the recent discovery of boron-containing catalysts (e.g., BN, supported boron oxide) that can catalyze dehydrogenation and suppress overoxidation (19–25). For these catalysts, the B–O–B oligomers are generally regarded as active centers (26–28), whereas a single-site boron in zeolite (e.g., B–MWW) is inert for the reaction (29). However, the B–O–B oligomers are associated with complete hydrolysis by water products to form boron with saturated hydroxyl groups (e.g., boric acid), which could deactivate the catalyst once the boric acid leaches from the reaction system because of the strong solubility of such species in water (24, 30).
Herein, we report a new active center with a –B[OH…O(H)–Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing B–O–B oligomers. Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis. As a result, the BS-1 catalyst is water tolerant, maintaining high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime, and this represents a large step forward in ODHP technology.
The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days. By calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 with an Si/B ratio of ~62 was obtained. BS-1 catalyst was identified by x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibiting typical characteristics in its MFI structure (figs. S1 and S2). A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the BS-1 catalyst showed an average zeolite crystal size of 350 nm (fig. S3). A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of the BS-1 catalyst confirmed the open zeolite micropores (fig. S4). Energy dispersive spectroscopic elemental maps of the BS-1 catalyst revealed uniform distribution of boron species on the silica matrix (fig. S5). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis showed undetectable metal species (fig. S6), which excludes the suspected contribution of impurities on catalytic activity. For comparison, we also loaded the boron species on S-1 zeolite (B/S-1) and amorphous silica (B/SiO2) by impregnation (fig. S7), with Si/B ratios of 50 and 66, respectively.
The catalytic ODHP was performed in a fixed-bed reactor containing a feed gas of propane and oxygen (C3H8/O2/He = 1/1/8) with a weight-hour-space-velocity (WHSV, LC3H8 kgcatalyst-1 h-1) of 3600 L kg−1 h−1. Figure 1A shows the dependence of propane conversion on reaction temperature over various catalysts. The automatic reaction occurring between propane and oxygen was excluded by the blank run without catalysts. The BS-1 catalyst was active for the reaction, giving propane conversion with increasing reaction temperature. For example, 23.8 and 41.4% of propane conversions were realized on the BS-1 catalyst at 540 and 560°C, respectively. By contrast, B/S-1 and B/SiO2 catalysts exhibited lower propane conversions at 1.9 and 8.5% at 540°C, respectively.

Reaction conditions were as follows: 570°C, feed gas with ratio of C3H8/O2/He at 1/1/4, WHSV = 9000 L kg−1 h−1. Carbon balances were >100 ± 5% during the tests.
Propene appeared in the boron-catalyzed ODHP as a dominant product, and the side reaction led to the formation of ethene, which is also a valuable olefin product, rather than the valueless COx that is usually formed in the oxidation. Olefin selectivity as a function of the propane conversion is shown in Fig. 1B and fig. S8. S-1 zeolite without boron displayed propane combustion as a major reaction to form COx. The BS-1 catalyst exhibited propene and ethene selectivities (based on carbon atoms) of 60.9 and 25.7% at a low propane conversions of 5.3%, giving an overoxidized propane selectivity of <0.5% [undetectable organic oxygenates, carbon balance >96%, olefin molecular selectivity >99.5%, (moles of produced olefin/moles of transformed propane)*100%]. This excellent selectivity was mostly maintained with raising the propane conversion (Fig. 1B). For instance, the propene and ethene selectivities were 55.4 and 27.2%, respectively, under 23.8% propane conversion. When the propane conversion reached as high as 41.4%, the propene and ethene selectivities were still 54.9 and 26.3%, with selectivity for light olefins at 81.2% (Fig. 1B and fig. S9). Under these reaction conditions, the one-pass yield of olefins reached 33.6% (22.7% for propene and 10.9% for ethene). By comparison, the B/S-1 and B/SiO2 catalysts with similar boron content to BS-1 yielded much lower activity (fig. S8).
In ODHP, high propane conversion usually leads to easy overoxidation (18). For example, VOx-based catalysts have selectivity for light olefins of <50%, with CO2 as a major product when propane conversion exceeds 30% in the ODHP (fig. S8). By contrast, high olefin selectivity (>81.2%) was always obtained over the BS-1 catalyst in a wide range of propane conversions (3.8 to 41.4%). The hexagonal carbon nitride (h-BN) catalyst, which has been regarded as a highly efficient catalyst for ODHP, showed slightly lower olefin selectivity (79.9%) under the comparable propane conversion (40.2%; fig. S8). In particular, propene selectivity over BS-1 (54.9%) was higher than that over h-BN (47.0%). Because of this reaction trend, the olefin formation rate over the BS-1 catalyst was much higher than that of the h-BN and B/S-1 catalysts (fig. S10).
The supported boron catalysts were usually deactivated by washing with water because of boron leaching and dissolving (21, 22). For example, the water-treated B/S-1 catalyst was markedly deactivated (Fig. 1C), giving a propane conversion at 1.9%, which is much lower than that of the fresh catalyst (9.2%, 560°C; fig. S11). The BS-1 catalyst retained this ability after the equivalent treatment (Fig. 1C). Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce ~10 vol% water in the gas. As shown in Fig. 1D, the propane conversion and propene and/or ethene selectivities were 32.5% and 53.8% and/or 28.6%, respectively, at the beginning of the reaction. Even after reaction for 88 hours, the BS-1 catalyst exhibited similar propane conversion (32.9%) and propene and ethene selectivities (57.0 and 28.0%, respectively). Further reaction for longer times led to increased propane conversion, reaching 42.6% at 148 hours, whereas the olefin selectivity was almost unchanged. Even after reaction for 210 hours, the catalyst still exhibited propane conversion at 43.7%, with propene and ethene selectivities at 53.3 and 29.5%, respectively, showing the good durability of the BS-1 catalyst in the ODHP. The zeolite structure was maintained and boron leaching was almost negligible in the reaction for 208 hours, as confirmed by the ICP analysis, N2 sorption, XRD pattern, SEM images, and TEM images of the used catalyst (figs. S12 to S15). Coke formation was undetectable, as evidenced by the thermogravimetry analysis (figs. S16 and S17).
By contrast, under the equivalent reaction conditions, the h-BN catalyst was deactivated substantially in the tests for 12 hours (fig. S18), in agreement with the previous phenomena (24, 30). XRD and SEM results showed that the h-BN was partially dissolved into the boric acid and boron trioxide species (figs. S19 and S20). Although the boric acid was also active for the ODHP, it would be leached into a humid atmosphere, and its glue-like state is unsuitable for practical utilization because of corrosion and blockage to the reactor. These data all confirm the substantially improved water tolerance of the BS-1 compared with the general boron catalysts, where the zeolite framework hinders the hydrolysis and/or dissolution of boron species by water under humid ODHP conditions. This conclusion is further supported by the study on the apparent activation energies of various catalysts (figs. S21 and S22).
The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2A), where the fresh BS-1 exhibited a strong peak at –3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework (31–34). An additional broad signal appeared at 15 to 20 ppm, which was observed on the borosilicate zeolite and assigned to the extra-framework boron species [e.g., B(OH)3] with close silanol and/or (H2O)n (35). The dehydration treatment partially removed the water, resulting in the formation of tricoordinated boron (B[3]) with 11B signals at ~0 to 15 ppm (fig. S23), which is very consistent with the isolated boron in the zeolite framework (31). In addition, the extraframework boron signal disappeared in the dehydrated BS-1 because of easy condensation with adjacent silanol to form B–O–Si linkage, in good agreement with previous observations (35).

B-, Si-, and Cu-containing species were characterized by a set of peaks because of the isotopes of these elements. The isotope effect allowed differentiating a few fragment ions with similar m/z values from each other.
The two-dimensional (2D) 11B→1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectrum of the dehydrated BS-1 provides insight into the spatial proximities between B and H species. B[4] species are always adjacent to hydroniums (H+[H2O]n) because of the negative charge on the B[4] centers, which was confirmed here by the correlation peak of δ(1H) at ~4 to 5 ppm and δ(11B) at ~0 to –4 ppm (Fig. 2B). Correlations between the 1H NMR signal of hydronium at ~4 to 5 ppm adjacent to B[4] and the 11B NMR signals of B[3] were unobservable, suggesting that the B[3] and B[4] sites should be well separated in the zeolite (Fig. 2B) (29). Further identification was performed by the 2D 11B–11B proton driven spin diffusion (PDSD) homonuclear correlation spectrum (Fig. 2C), where the off-diagonal signal assigned to spatial correlations of different boron species was undetectable. Considering that dehydration of a portion of B[4] sites (H+[H2O]n removal) could form B[3] sites, which is a reversible and stochastic process, the B[3]–B[4] spatial correlations would be inevitable if there were agglomerated boron species (e.g., –B–O–B–). Therefore, the undetectable B[3]–B[4] spatial correlations suggest isolated boron sites on BS-1. The framework boron species were further identified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of BS-1 under vacuum at different temperatures, showing bands at ~905 to 915 and 1380 to 1400 cm−1 (fig. S24), which characterize the isolated boron species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination in the zeolite framework, respectively (31, 36). Raising the temperature substantially decreased tetrahedral boron signals, confirming the transformation of B[4] to B[3] at high temperature, in good agreement with the typical features of framework boron sites (fig. S25) (36).
In addition, the structure of BS-1 was investigated using gas-phase cluster analysis from the solid structure, which is bombarded from the catalyst and randomly formed to contain compositional and structural information. Time-of-flight mass spectra (ToF-MS) showed different gas-phase clusters from the BS-1 (with metallic Cu as sample support), where the boron-containing clusters of BO2 and BO3 and a variety of borosilicate ions [SizB1OyHx, z = 1, 2] were detected (Fig. 2D and figs. S26 to S28). The clusters containing the B–O–B structure (e.g., B2OxHy) were completely undetectable (figs. S26, S28, and S29). By contrast, the ToF-MS spectra of amorphous B2O3 showed abundant boron oligomers (figs. S30 and S31). These data also suggest isolated boron in the BS-1, in good agreement with the NMR results.
The hydroxyl groups on the isolated boron were identified using NMR. Figure 3A shows the 1H MAS NMR spectra of BS-1 and B/S-1, with signals at 1.8 ppm assigned to terminal silanol hydroxyl groups (Si–OH) on the zeolite matrix (Fig. 3B, I) (35, 37, 38). In addition, B/S-1 has another signal at 2.9 ppm related to the fully hydrolyzed boron species [e.g., B(OH)3], whereas the BS-1 exhibits four additional 1H signals at 2.1, 2.6, 3.5, and 4.5 ppm, which are assigned to Si–OH adjacent to oxygen on B–OH (2.1 ppm, Si–OH…O(H)–B; Fig. 3B, II), Si–OH adjacent to boron (2.6 ppm; Fig. 3B, III), B–OH adjacent to oxygen on Si–OH [3.5 ppm, B–OH…O(H)–Si; Fig. 3B, II], and the hydroniums [4.5 ppm, H+(H2O)n; Fig. 3B, IV] (35, 37, 38). The signals at 3.5 and 2.1 ppm should be coproduced from the hydrolysis of the Si–O–B linkage in zeolite framework. The used BS-1 had similar signals at 3.5 and 2.1 ppm after the ODHP test (fig. S32), confirming the high stability of the B–OH species during the ODHP.

Advanced 2D 1H-1H double quantum (DQ) MAS NMR spectroscopy was used to explore the proton-proton proximities in the fresh and used BS-1 catalysts (Fig. 3C). The autocorrelation signal at (2.1, 4.2) ppm appeared on the diagonal, indicating that the H in Si–OH…O(H)–B were in close proximity to each other. A similar phenomenon also occurred in the B–OH…O(H)–Si species, with signal at (3.5, 7.0) ppm, where the H species were also in close proximity. In addition, the off-diagonal peak pair at (3.5, 5.6) and (2.1, 5.6) ppm indicates the spatial correlation between the Si–OH…O(H)–B and B–OH…O(H)–Si groups [δDQ (5.6 ppm) = 2.1 ppm + 3.5 ppm]. Considering that boron species are isolated in BS-1, the aforementioned signals should result from the B[OH…O(H)–Si]2 structure (Fig. 3B, II) (37). Compared with as-synthesized BS-1, the used sample exhibited enhanced signal intensity at (3.5, 5.6) ppm and (2.1, 5.6) ppm (Fig. 3C). This phenomenon is reasonably related to the further hydrolysis of Si–O–B bonds during the ODHP to form more spatially correlated B–OH and Si–OH species (e.g., isolated B[OH…O(H)–Si]2), which should be crucial for the high activity of BS-1 zeolite (37, 38). This phenomenon was also confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy of the fresh and used BS-1 catalyst (fig. S33), which explained the slight increase of propane conversion after a long-period ODHP test (Fig. 1D). More importantly, Si–OH nests (1.8, 3.6 ppm) and fully hydrolyzed boron species (2.9 ppm) were undetectable in the 1H-1H DQ spectrum of the fresh and used BS-1 (Fig. 3C) (33), confirming that the deep hydrolysis of Si–O–B species and boron leaching were effectively inhibited (fig. S34); this was supported by the in situ FTIR study (fig. S35) showing that hydrolysis of the Si–O–B linkage is reversible. This feature contributes to the good durability during water treatment and reaction for long time.
The combined NMR and IR results indicate that the boron sites anchored within the MFI zeolite framework might proceed to hydrolysis to form more –B[OH…O(H)–Si]2 groups for boosting catalysis, and such species could reverse into the Si–O–B linkage, which is further supported by the reaction rates under a different atmosphere (fig. S36). The isotope-labeled experiment also confirmed the importance of hydroxyl groups for the reaction (fig. S36). This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (figs. S37 and S38), giving good durability in the reaction process.
At the time of this investigation of boron-catalyzed ODHP, active sites are still not fully understood and controversy remains. Amorphous boron oxide species with multiple boron nuclei in close proximity (e.g., B–O–B species) have been proposed as active sites, whereas the isolated boron in zeolite is regarded to be inactive. For example, in a previous study, the MWW-type borosilicate zeolite (B-MWW) was observed to be catalytically inactive in the ODHP reaction (29), and this result was reproduced in our laboratory (figs. S39 to S42). However, we found that BS-1 had high activity, which differs substantially from previous knowledge. NMR characterizations showed that –B[OH…O(H)–Si]2 sites were absent in the inactive B-MWW catalyst (fig. S41) (29), and such active sites might be related to the B[4] species in the zeolite framework because B[4] was nearly absent in B-MWW but abundant in BS-1 (fig. S42). It is possible that the –B[OH…O(H)–Si]2 sites were from the hydrolysis of B[4] because B[4] is easily transformed into B[3] with abundant hydroxyl groups at higher temperature on BS-1 (figs. S24, S33, and S35). In addition, the borosilicate zeolite with a *BEA structure (B-Beta; fig. S43) also had abundant –B[OH…O(H)–Si]2 sites exhibiting high activity and selectivity for ODHP (figs. S44 to S47). The kinetic parameters of B-Beta were in good agreement with those of BS-1 (fig. S48). The B-MWW has boron sites with a monohydroxyl group [(Si–O)2–B–OH] but exhibits undetectable –B[OH…O(H)-Si]2 species (29), which also supports the active site of dihydroxyl boron species. In addition, even if a small amount of B(OH)3 species exists on BS-1, such a species would not contribute to propane conversion, as supported by the extremely low activity of the B/S-1 catalyst (boric acid loaded on S-1 zeolite; Fig. 1A).
To better understand the active sites, the kinetic parameters in ODHP have been measured (figs. S49 and S50). The BS-1 catalyst had a first-order rate dependence with respect to propane partial pressure, whereas the supported boron and h–BN had a second-order rate dependence (fig. S49) (19). Although boron-catalyzed ODHP is still not fully understood (23), the first-order rate dependence might suggest a different reaction behavior on BS-1 compared with the generally supported boron and h-BN. The reaction pathway of propane dehydrogenation on BS-1 was explored using density functional theory calculation (figs. S51 to S54), where the catalyst framework was taken into account by the extended cluster model with isolated boron functionalized with one or two hydroxyl groups. For the catalyst with a dihydroxyl group on boron, O2 and C3H8 were initially coadsorbed on one hydroxyl group through weak van der Waals interaction (R; figs. S51 and S52). The other hydroxyl group in boron was able to form a hydrogen bond with Si–OH and further constrain O2, as shown in Fig. 3D. In this case, the constructed eight-member ring in the transition state by three hydrogen bonds benefits the synergistic conversion of O2 (3Σg) and propane through the decreasing of energy barriers, indicating the importance of –B(OH)2 groups and the nearby silanol species (figs. S53 and S54). By contrast, the catalyst with monohydroxyl group on boron formed a weaker interaction between –BOH and O2, as confirmed by the H…O distance and the interaction strength of 2.424 Å and 0.165 eV, which cannot build the desired transition state illustrated in the dihydroxyl system (fig. S55). In the reaction over dihydroxyl group model (fig. S51), the intermediate (Int) was formed with a barrier (TS1) of 1.583 eV through the proton transfer from propane to –BOH with C3H7 intermediate formation, and the hydrogen atom of BOH synchronously interacted with O2. It is noteworthy that the C3H7 intermediate (Int) is highly reactive, and one hydrogen of the –CH3 group will quickly transfer to the O2H species to form the products (P, i.e., C3H6 and H2O2) by overcoming an energy barrier (TS2) of 0.928 eV. Finally, C3H6 and H2O2 were desorbed in sequence. H2O2 is an unstable intermediate at the reaction temperature, which should quickly transform into H2O and O2 in the practical reaction. The confinement effect of the zeolite microporous structure also contributes to the reaction activity illustrated by the results in smaller model without a zeolite framework (fig. S56), which shows a higher TS1 energy barrier at 1.700 eV, as indicated by the stronger van der Waals interaction (fig. S57) in the reduced density gradient isosurface.
Our results demonstrate that the catalytic performances of isolated boron species could be improved by tuning the coordination environment, which provides new opportunities for the rational design of efficient dehydrogenation catalysts by incorporating boron sites in a zeolite framework. In addition, the zeolite structure hinders the full hydrolysis of boron species for excellent durability, which leads to an ideal catalyst with water tolerance. This work represents a large step forward in boron catalysis that may lead the way to scalable applications.
