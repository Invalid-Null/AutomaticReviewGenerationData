<quotes>

[1] "Recently, Rh-based catalyst such as RhGa have been tested to find a better alternative [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], but the activity and stability of RhGa are not improved from those of the PtSn system." 

[2] "The PtSn catalytic system has so far been considered to be the best catalyst for PDH in terms of conversion and selectivity [13], [55], [57], [59], [60], [61], [62]."

[3] "In contrast to PtSn, there was little activity suppression even with excess Sn content on the RhSn catalysts, up to a 7.5 Sn/Rh weight ratio."

[4] "Figs. 4, S1, Table S1, Fig. S14, and Table S6 show a brief and comparative study (initial conversion and selectivity) to clarify the effect of different amounts of Sn on the RhSn and PtSn catalysts in the range between 500 and 600 C." 

[5] "The initial C3 conversion with the PtSn catalysts increased up to a Sn/Pt weight ratio of 1.5 and then decreased with the further addition of Sn [32]. The excess Sn suppressed the C3 conversion of the PtSn catalysts." 

[6] "From these observations, it has been claimed that Pt3Sn1 or Pt2Sn1 is an active phase for PDH [43], [44], [59]."

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing that initial C3 conversion with PtSn catalysts increased up to a Sn/Pt weight ratio of 1.5 and then decreased with further Sn addition. It states that Pt3Sn1 or Pt2Sn1 is considered the active phase for PDH, and compares the performance of PtSn and RhSn catalysts with different Sn content. The article finds that in contrast to PtSn, RhSn catalysts showed little activity suppression even with high Sn content.

2. 是的,该文评估了Pt-Sn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显示,随着Sn/Pt重量比增加到1.5,PtSn催化剂的初始C3转化率增加,之后随着Sn的进一步添加而降低。它指出Pt3Sn1或Pt2Sn1被认为是PDH的活性相,并比较了不同Sn含量的PtSn和RhSn催化剂的性能。该文发现,与PtSn相反,即使Sn含量很高,RhSn催化剂的活性也几乎未受抑制。

[1] "Both the geometric and electronic contributions to the promoting role of Sn are well understood."

[2] "The geometric effect results from the isolation of the aggregated Pt clusters by the Sn additives, substantially reducing the hydrogenolysis and coking reactions, leading to high selectivity and stability [31], [32]." 

[3] "In addition, electron transfer from Sn to Pt increases the electron density of Pt and decreases the activation energy for the desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired reactions and increasing the selectivity for olefins [24], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38]."

[4] "The effect of Sn on Rh can also be explained in the same way, although the Sn effect on Rh in PDH was much more pronounced than that on Pt (Fig. 4 and Fig. S1)."

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Sn in the bimetallic PtSn and RhSn catalysts. It states that the geometric effect of Sn results from the isolation of aggregated metal clusters, reducing undesirable reactions. The electronic effect is electron transfer from Sn increasing metal electron density and decreasing olefin desorption energy, reducing undesired reactions and increasing olefin selectivity. It notes these effects apply to both PtSn and RhSn, although the Sn effect was more pronounced for RhSn.

3. 是的,该文研究了Sn作为双金属PtSn和RhSn催化剂中的次要金属的电子学和几何学效应。它指出Sn的几何效应来自于隔离聚集的金属簇,减少不想要的反应。电子效应是Sn的电子转移增加金属电子密度,降低烯烃解吸能,减少不想要的反应并增加烯烃选择性。它指出这些效应适用于PtSn和RhSn,尽管Sn对RhSn的效应更突出。
