1. The pronounced effect of Sn on RhSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation

2. C3= selectivity on Rh(0.5) is less than 26% in propane dehydrogenation and methane is a major product.

3. Low C3= selectivity on Rh(0.5) is ascribed to the severe deep dehydrogenation.

4. Sn addition to Rh(0.5) enhances both conversion and C3= selectivity monotonically. 

5. Sn addition to Rh results in RhSn alloy, lowering the barrier for propylene desorption.

6. RhSn alloy suppresses the sintering of Rh, resulting in high stability.

7. PtSn-based catalysts (using different supports) are some of the most popular and efficient catalytic systems for PDH.
