<quotes>

[1] "Rh (0.5 wt%) was loaded onto γ-Al2O3 support (Rh(0.5)), and a Sn amount of 0.15-3.0 wt% was added to the Rh(0.5)."  

[2] "The Rh(0.5) catalyst showed very low C3 conversion and very low C3= selectivity compared with the Pt(0.5) catalyst."

[3] "The C3 conversion, C3= selectivity, and stability of the RhSn catalysts are increased with increasing amounts of Sn."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

5. Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Rh catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that 0.5 wt% Rh on alumina (Rh(0.5)) exhibits very low propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to 0.5 wt% Pt on alumina (Pt(0.5)). Adding Sn to Rh(0.5) greatly enhances the conversion and propylene selectivity.

5. 是的,本文评价了单金属Rh载体催化剂进行丙烷脱氢。结果显示,0.5 wt% Rh载于氧化铝(Rh(0.5))表现出非常低的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性,与0.5 wt% Pt载于氧化铝(Pt(0.5))相比。向Rh(0.5)添加Sn大大提高了转化率和丙烯选择性。

[1] "The C3 conversion, C3= selectivity, and stability of the RhSn catalysts are increased with increasing amounts of Sn."

[2] "Both the coke formation and metal sintering of RhSn with a high Sn content are strongly suppressed, which may be one of the reasons for the higher stability of RhSn with a higher Sn content."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like Sn content affect the performance of Rh-Sn bimetallic catalysts. It shows that increasing Sn content improves propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and catalyst stability. The article suggests this is due to reduced coke formation and metal sintering at higher Sn levels.

</English version answer>

6. 是的,本文研究了Sn含量等属性如何影响Rh-Sn双金属催化剂的性能。结果显示,Sn含量升高可以提高丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。文章认为这是由于高Sn含量可以减少焦炭生成和金属颗粒烧结。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "The Rh(0.5) catalyst showed methane selectivity of ~84% with negligible C2 species at the similar conversion to Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) at the initial activity test at 30 s. On the other hand, Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) showed high propylene selectivity of 96% even at the initial activity at 30 s."

[2] "C3H8 TPD curves exhibit that methane (m/z: 16) desorption is maximized at the temperature where desorption of propane and propylene stops, indicating that methane is mainly generated by the cracking of intermediates through deep dehydrogenation." 

[3] "Therefore, we conclude that suppressing the cracking through deep dehydrogenation is the main effect of Sn on Rh for PDH."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

7. Yes, the article proposes that Sn suppresses the deep dehydrogenation of propane to methane on Rh, which is the main reaction pathway in the absence of Sn. This increases propylene selectivity by reducing the cracking of intermediates to methane. The article provides initial activity tests, TPD data, and other evidence to support this mechanistic interpretation.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

7. 是的,本文提出Sn抑制了Rh上丙烷深度脱氢生成甲烷的主要反应途径。这通过减少中间体裂解生成甲烷来提高丙烯选择性。文章提供了初始活性测试、TPD数据和其他证据来支持这一机理解释。
