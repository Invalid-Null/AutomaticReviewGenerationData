<quotes>
[1] "The PtSn catalytic system has so far been considered to be the best catalyst for PDH in terms of conversion and selectivity [13], [55], [57], [59], [60], [61], [62]."

[2] "The PtSn catalysts with more than 1.0 wt% Sn exhibited a similar C3 conversion and metal dispersion. It is clear that the C3= selectivity increased with increasing amounts of Sn in the RhSn catalysts."

[3] "In contrast to PtSn, there was little activity suppression even with excess Sn content on the RhSn catalysts, up to a 7.5 Sn/Rh weight ratio."  

[4] "In contrast, no optimized Sn/Rh ratio was observed with Sn/Rh weight ratios up to 6.0."

[5] "Therefore, it can be concluded that the addition of Sn enhanced the yield of propylene by suppressing the cracking via deep dehydrogenation without an optimized RhSn composition."

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing that adding Sn to Pt improves selectivity to propylene, though excessive Sn can suppress activity. In contrast, Rh-Sn shows continuously improving selectivity with more Sn, without loss of activity. No optimized composition is found.

2. 是的,这篇文章评估了Pt-Sn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显示,向Pt添加Sn可以提高丙烯的选择性,尽管过量的Sn会抑制活性。相比之下,Rh-Sn随着Sn的增加持续提高选择性,没有活性损失。没有找到优化的组成。

<quotes>
[1] "The geometric and electronic effects resulting in the effects of Sn on Pt in light alkane dehydrogenation have been discussed [24], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]."

[2] "The effect of Sn on Rh can also be explained in the same way, although the Sn effect on Rh in PDH was much more pronounced than that on Pt (Fig. 4 and Fig. S1)."

[3] "Nonetheless, the significant improvement in dehydrogenation on RhSn is unusual compared to that of PtSn when a small amount of Sn is added to Rh(0.5)." 

[4] "It has been suggested that Pt3Sn or Pt2Sn is the active species for PDH. However, the role of Sn addition should be the same for both PtSn and RhSn."

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of Sn as a secondary metal in Rh-Sn bimetallic catalysts. It explains that Sn isolates Rh sites and transfers electron density to Rh, similar to Pt-Sn. But the effect is much more pronounced on Rh-Sn.

3. 是的,这篇文章研究了Sn作为Rh-Sn双金属催化剂中的辅助金属的电子和几何效应。它解释说,Sn隔离了Rh位点,并向Rh转移了电子密度,类似于Pt-Sn。但是Rh-Sn上的效果要明显得多。
