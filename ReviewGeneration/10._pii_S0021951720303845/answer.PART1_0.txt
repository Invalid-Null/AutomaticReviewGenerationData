<quotes>

[1] "Recently, Rh-based catalyst such as RhGa have been tested to find a better alternative [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], but the activity and stability of RhGa are not improved from those of the PtSn system."

[2] "PtSn-based catalysts (using different supports) are some of the most popular and efficient catalytic systems for PDH."

[3] "The Pt(0.5) catalyst mainly has active sites for dehydrogenation (C3= selectivity: 83.1%), while the Rh(0.5) catalyst mainly has active sites for cracking (C1C2 selectivity: 73.5%; Table S2)."

[4] "On the other hand, the RhSn catalysts with more than 1.0 wt% Sn exhibited a similar C3 conversion and metal dispersion."

[5] "It is clear that the C3= selectivity increased with increasing amounts of Sn in the RhSn catalysts."

5. The article evaluates the performance of supported mono-metallic Rh and Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that Pt/Al2O3 has mainly dehydrogenation sites while Rh/Al2O3 cracks propane to form methane. Adding Sn suppresses the methane formation on Rh and increases propylene selectivity. Increasing Sn loading beyond 1 wt% on RhSn/Al2O3 does not affect conversion but keeps improving selectivity. Overall, PtSn is still the most efficient PDH catalyst.

5. 该文献评估了负载的单金属Rh和Pt催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的性能。结果显示Pt/Al2O3主要具有脱氢活性中心,而Rh/Al2O3会裂解丙烷生成甲烷。添加Sn能抑制Rh上的甲烷生成,提高丙烯选择性。当RhSn/Al2O3中的Sn加载量超过1wt%时,转化率不再变化,但选择性持续提高。总体来说,PtSn仍然是最高效的丙烷脱氢催化剂。

[1] "PDH occurs in two stages: (1) quick deactivation within the first tens of minutes by a fast coke formation and (2) a stable steady state after the first stage." 

[2] "Very low C3 conversion may be due to the blocking of the Rh metal sites by fast coke formation in the initial stage."

[3] "The low C3= selectivity with Rh(0.5) can be attributed to the high barrier for propylene desorption." 

[4] "Accordingly, cracking via deep dehydrogenation (methane formation) predominantly occurred on Rh(0.5)."

[5] "The addition of Sn enhanced the yield of propylene by suppressing the cracking via deep dehydrogenation without an optimized RhSn composition."

</quotes>

7. The article proposes that Rh catalysts undergo two reaction stages - initial fast deactivation by coke formation that blocks sites, followed by steady state conversion. The high methane selectivity on Rh is due to deep dehydrogenation cracking of strongly bound intermediates during propylene desorption. Adding Sn suppresses the deep dehydrogenation to improve propylene selectivity without need for optimized RhSn ratio.

</English version answer>

7. 该文献提出Rh催化剂会经历两个反应阶段——由炭化氢迅速形成的焦炭导致的初始快速失活,之后达到稳定转化的稳态。Rh上的高甲烷选择性是由于丙烯解吸过程中中间体发生深度脱氢裂化所致。添加Sn能抑制深度脱氢从而提高丙烯选择性,而无需优化RhSn的组成比。
