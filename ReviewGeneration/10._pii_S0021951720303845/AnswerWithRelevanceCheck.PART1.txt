[1] "Rh (0.5 wt%) was loaded onto γ-Al2O3 support (Rh(0.5)), and a Sn amount of 0.15-3.0 wt% was added to the Rh(0.5)."

[2] "The Rh(0.5) catalyst showed very low C3 conversion and very low C3= selectivity compared with the Pt(0.5) catalyst." 

[3] "The C3 conversion, C3= selectivity, and stability of the RhSn catalysts are increased with increasing amounts of Sn."
</Quotes>

<English>
The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Rh catalysts. It shows 0.5 wt% Rh on alumina exhibits very low propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to 0.5 wt% Pt on alumina. Adding Sn to the Rh catalyst greatly improves conversion and selectivity.
</English>

[1] "On the other hand, Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) showed high propylene selectivity of 96% even at the initial activity at 30 s."

[2] "C3H8 TPD curves exhibit that methane (m/z: 16) desorption is maximized at the temperature where desorption of propane and propylene stops, indicating that methane is mainly generated by the cracking of intermediates through deep dehydrogenation."

[3] "Therefore, we conclude that suppressing the cracking through deep dehydrogenation is the main effect of Sn on Rh for PDH."
</Quotes>

<English>
The article proposes Sn suppresses the deep dehydrogenation of propane to methane on Rh, increasing propylene selectivity. It provides initial activity tests, TPD data, and other evidence to support this mechanistic interpretation.
</English>

<Chinese>  
该文献提出Sn抑制了Rh上丙烷发生深度脱氢生成甲烷的反应,提高了丙烯选择性。文献提供了初期活性测试、TPD数据以及其他证据来支持这一机理解释。
