[1] "Pt(0.5) catalyst mainly has active sites for dehydrogenation (C3= selectivity: 83.1%), while the Rh(0.5) catalyst mainly has active sites for cracking (C1C2 selectivity: 73.5%)"

[2] "The Pt(0.5) catalyst showed initial C3 conversion of 18.1% and mainly had active sites for dehydrogenation. In contrast, the Rh(0.5) catalyst showed very low C3 conversion of 10.7% and mainly had active sites for cracking."

5. The article evaluates the supported mono-metallic Pt(0.5) catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that the Pt(0.5) catalyst had 18.1% initial C3 conversion and mainly exhibited dehydrogenation activity with 83.1% C3= selectivity. In contrast, the Rh(0.5) catalyst showed only 10.7% conversion and favored cracking with 73.5% C1-C2 selectivity.

<quotes>

[1] "Methane on Rh(0.5) can be produced mainly through the cracking of strongly adsorbed intermediates, similarly to Pt." 

[2] "The absence of a C2 fragment at high temperature in C3H8 TPD supports the conclusion that methane on Rh(0.5) can be produced from the cracking of the strongly adsorbed intermediate of deep dehydrogenation."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

7. The article proposes that on the Rh(0.5) catalyst, methane is produced mainly via cracking of strongly adsorbed intermediates from deep dehydrogenation, similar to the mechanism on Pt. This is supported by C3H8 TPD data showing no C2 species at high temperatures when methane is formed.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

7. 文章提出在Rh(0.5)催化剂上,甲烷主要通过深度脱氢生成的强吸附中间体的裂解生成,这与Pt上的机理相似。这一点得到了C3H8 TPD数据的支持,在高温甲烷生成时没有观察到C2物种。
