<quotes>
[1] Recently, Rh-based catalyst such as RhGa have been tested to find a better alternative [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], but the activity and stability of RhGa are not improved from those of the PtSn system.

[2] PtSn-based catalysts (using different supports) are some of the most popular and efficient catalytic systems for PDH. 

[3] The PtSn catalytic system has so far been considered to be the best catalyst for PDH in terms of conversion and selectivity [13], [55], [57], [59], [60], [61], [62]. 

[4] When a small amount of Sn (0.15 wt%) was added to Rh(0.5), the C3 conversion and the C3= selectivity were dramatically enhanced.

[5] The C3 conversion, C3= selectivity, and stability of the RhSn catalysts are increased with increasing amounts of Sn.

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It states that Pt-Sn catalysts are among the most popular and efficient systems for PDH. The article also briefly tests a Rh-Ga catalyst but finds its performance is not superior to Pt-Sn. The addition of small amounts of Sn to Rh catalysts is found to dramatically enhance C3 conversion and C3= selectivity. Increasing Sn loading further enhances performance of Rh-Sn catalysts.

2. 是的,文中评估了Pt-Sn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。文中指出Pt-Sn催化剂是丙烷脱氢反应中最受欢迎和高效的催化剂体系之一。文中也简单测试了Rh-Ga催化剂,但发现其性能不优于Pt-Sn。在Rh催化剂中添加少量Sn能显著提高C3转化率和C3=选择性。进一步增加Sn载量可以进一步提高Rh-Sn催化剂的性能。

3. No, the article does not specifically investigate electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in the Rh-Sn bimetallic catalysts. It hypothesizes that Sn may weaken the interaction between Rh and the alumina support, but does not provide direct evidence.

5. No, the article does not describe any synergistic effects between metals attributed to ensemble and/or ligand effects. It hypothesizes that Sn may facilitate electron transfer to Rh and help isolate Rh sites, but does not provide direct evidence.
