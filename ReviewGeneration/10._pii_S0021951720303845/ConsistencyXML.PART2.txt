To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key points covered in each answer file to the correct answers. I calculated a percentage based on how many of the main ideas were addressed. 100% indicates the answer file contained all the relevant information in the correct answers, while lower percentages indicate some key details were missing.

The XML structure organizes the comparisons by question number, with each question containing the consistency ratios for the 5 answer files. This allows easy analysis of how thoroughly each question was addressed across the different answer sets.
