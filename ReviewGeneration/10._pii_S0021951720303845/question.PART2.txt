Abstract
The pronounced effect of Sn on RhSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is studied. A 0.5- wt% Rh/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (Rh(0.5)) without Sn exhibits very low propane (C3) conversion (10.7%) and low selectivity (25.4%) for propylene (C3=) at 600 C and a WHSV of 10.8 h1. However, the Sn addition to Rh(0.5) increases both the C3 conversion and the C3= yield. Finally, the Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalyst achieves a C3 conversion of 30.8% and a C3= selectivity of 96.3%. It has been reported that PtSn catalysts show an optimized C3= at the Sn/Pt molar ratio of about 1.0, increasing the propene selectivity at the expense of catalytic activity. This is not the case for the RhSn system. The primary product of Rh(0.5) is methane (65%) at the initial time and severe coke formation covers the exposed Rh metal, resulting in low C3 conversion. Both the C3 conversion and the C3= yield increase with increasing Sn content. The low C3 conversion and C3= yield of Rh(0.5) are ascribed to cracking via the strong adsorption of intermediates during propane dehydrogenation, resulting in severe coke formation. The main role of Sn on Rh(0.5) in propane dehydrogenation is to suppress cracking of strongly adsorbed intermediates during dehydrogenation; the gain in C3= selectivity outweighs the loss of activity for propane dehydrogenation to propylene up to a high Sn addition of 3 wt%.

1. Introduction
Propylene is an important raw material in many industries, which can be used to produce high-value chemicals through polymerization and epoxidation [1], [2], [3], [4]. The global propylene market is anticipated to grow to 165 million tons by 2030 [5]. Over the past few decades, enormous efforts have been devoted to developing novel catalysts to promote the industrial applications of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to achieve a more cost-effective route [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. The primary industrial technologies for PDH are the Catofin process (CrO3/Al2O3, CB & I Lummus) and Oleflex (PtSn/Al2O3, UOP) [15], [16]. In addition, propylene has been produced by steam cracking (SC), methanol-to-olefin production (MTO), and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of light oil fractions [17], [18], [19].
Since PDH is an endothermic process that requires relatively high temperatures to obtain a high yield of propylene, it is commercially carried out in a temperature range of 450650 C under atmospheric pressure. The CC bond breakage is kinetically significant only through an adsorbed propyne intermediate, to produce methylidyne and ethylidyne. Furthermore, methylidyne and ethylidyne are sources of coke and of C1 and C2 by-products [20]. Coke on Pt can be produced mainly via methylidene and ethylidene. Therefore, the first step of propane dehydrogenation is dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane to propylene via 1-propyl and 2-propyl, and the second step is the desorption of propylene [20], [21], [22]. Side products such as methane, ethane, and coke come from deep dehydrogenation.
PtSn-based catalysts (using different supports) are some of the most popular and efficient catalytic systems for PDH. On the other hand, Sn/SiO2 catalysts without another metal added exhibit moderate catalytic activity [23], [24], but alumina-supported KSn catalysts give very low activity [25], whereas Sn combines with Pt (PtSn alloys) provides a desirable PDH activities. The addition of Sn not only stabilizes Pt but also promotes the catalytic performance, increasing the propene yield as well as the selectivity [19], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. Moreover, Sn plays a promoting role in enhancing the performance of Pt-based catalysts for dehydrogenation. Both the geometric and electronic contributions to the promoting role of Sn are well understood. The geometric effect results from the isolation of the aggregated Pt clusters by the Sn additives, substantially reducing the hydrogenolysis and coking reactions, leading to high selectivity and stability [31], [32]. In addition, electron transfer from Sn to Pt increases the electron density of Pt and decreases the activation energy for the desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired reactions and increasing the selectivity for olefins [24], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38].
On the other hand, DFT studies state that Sn can weaken both propane and propylene adsorption (weakening the binding strengths) and suppress the bond-breaking reactions on the Pt surface, leading to lower catalytic activity but higher selectivity toward propylene [39], [40]. So the optimum molar ratio of Sn to Pt for the highest propylene yield was observed: (1) Sn addition decreased the dehydrogenation and deep dehydrogenation activity, weakening the bond strength between Pt and propane or propylene and (2) Sn addition increased the selectivity of propylene weakening the propylene adsorption. Moreover, the addition of Sn metal on the catalysts led to transfer of coke from the metal to the support during the reaction [41], [42]. In addition, in PtSn bimetals, Sn fills up the 5d band of the Pt metal, which suppresses hydrogenolysis and coke formation by decreasing the interaction of the hydrocarbon with Pt [16]. It was reported that the Sn-to-Pt weight ratio on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH was optimized at 1.01.5 (Fig. S1 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information). From the observed catalytic performance, it was suggested that Pt3Sn1 is the active species for PDH [30], [43], [44].
Recently, Rh-based catalyst such as RhGa have been tested to find a better alternative [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], but the activity and stability of RhGa are not improved from those of the PtSn system.
In this study, we examine the RhSn, catalysts which can be a significant alternative bimetallic catalytic system. In contrast to PtSn, there was little activity suppression even with excess Sn content on the RhSn catalysts, up to a 7.5 Sn/Rh weight ratio. The activity and selectivity of RhSn increased with increasing amounts of Sn. Furthermore, the catalytic performance of the RhSn catalytic system for PDH was similar to or even better than that of the PtSn catalytic system.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of the RhSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts
Different amounts of Sn (0.15, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 wt%) were loaded onto the 0.5 wt% Rh/γ-Al2O3 catalyst via a co-impregnation method, using rhodium chloride hydrate (Sigma Co., South Korea) and tin chloride dihydrate (SigmaAldrich) as precursors. The alumina support (2 g) was stirred with 5 mL ethanol in a 100-mL round-bottomed flask; then the weighed amounts of the Rh and Sn salts, dissolved in 5 mL ethanol, were added sequentially to the flask. After the solution had been stirred for 5 min, the ethanol was removed by evaporation, and the residue was dried overnight at 120 C and calcined for 3 h in air at 600 C. The prepared RhSn catalysts are designated as Rh(0.5)Sn(0.15), Rh(0.5)Sn(0.3), Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(0.75), Rh(0.5)Sn(1.0), Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(2.0), and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0), where the number in parentheses indicates the metal loading wt.% on the prepared RhSn catalysts. For comparison, 0.5 wt% Rh/γ-Al2O3 (Rh(0.5)) and 0.5 wt% Pt/γ-Al2O3 (Pt(0.5)) were prepared as described above.
2.2. Characterization of the prepared catalysts
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the calcined and reduced RhSn catalysts were recorded on a diffractometer (M/S, Shimadzu Instruments, Japan) using Ni-filtered CuKα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The operating voltage was 40 kV and the current was 30 mA with a scanning rate of 2min1. The N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms were obtained at 196 C using an automated gas sorption system (Belsorp II mini, BEL Japan, Inc.). The BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) and BarrettJoynerHalenda (BJH) methods were used to calculate the specific surface area and pore size distribution, respectively. Each sample was degassed in vacuum at 200 C for 2 h before the analysis.
The CO chemisorption of the pristine catalysts was performed in a pulse mode (BELCAT, BEL Japan, Inc.). Prior to the measurements, 0.05 g of the sample was thermally treated under a He stream at 500 C for 50 min to remove physically adsorbed water and other impurities. The sample was cooled to room temperature and heated to 600 C with a heating rate of 10 C min1 in pure H2 at a flow rate of 50 mL min1. The sample was then reduced in H2 at 600 C for 2 h. After reduction, the sample was purged with He gas at the same temperature for 1 h. After it cooled to 50 C, 10% CO/He gas was introduced for CO chemisorption. CO loop gas was used for each pulse (a sample loop of 1 mL), and the pulse injections were repeated until saturation. The amount of CO was measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The metal dispersion in each catalyst was calculated from the amount of CO adsorbed, assuming the stoichiometry factor (SF) for Rh/CO to be 1.0, as
where VS is the cumulative volume of adsorbed CO (cm3 at STP), MW is the molecular weight of Rh metal (g mol1), SW is the weight of the sample, and Fn is the Rh fraction in relation to the total weight of the catalyst sample.
The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed using a temperature program analyzer (BELCAT, BEL Japan, Inc.). A calcined sample (0.1 g) was placed in quartz wool in a U-type quartz reactor. The sample was heated at 20 C min1 to 500 C and purged for 2 h with an Ar stream at 500 C to remove physically adsorbed water and other impurities. The catalyst was cooled to room temperature under Ar gas. After this pretreatment, the catalyst was heated at 10 C min1 from room temperature to 900 C in a 5% H2/Ar stream with a flow rate of 30 mL min1. The consumption of hydrogen was analyzed online by TCD.
The morphologies of the prepared catalysts and the γ-Al2O3 samples were observed using transmission emission microscopes; TEM-Talos (F 200X) and TEM-Titan (80300). The TEM-Talos was operated at an accelerating voltage of 80200 kV using a LaB6 source, an image resolution lower than 0.16 nm, and a magnification of 251,500,000×. A Cu grid was used to spot the samples for the TEM analysis. The TEM- Titan was operated at an accelerating voltage of 80300 kV, an image resolution lower than 0.1 nm, an electroprobe size smaller than 0.09 nm, and a magnification of 251,250,000×. The samples were dispersed in ethanol using ultrasonication for 30 min. The resulting solution was dropped and deposited on a copper grid. The samples on the copper grid after solvent evaporation were used for the analysis.
The TEM, dark-field scanning TEM (STEM), high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM), HR-STEM images, and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra of the RhSn bimetallic nanoparticles were also analyzed for atomic-level studies.
The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of all the calcined and reduced catalysts were obtained using an Ulvac-PHI spectrometer (PHI 5000 Versa Probe; minimum X-ray beam size  10 m, energy resolution  0.50 eV, sensitivity  1,000,000 CPS, scanning electron gun (AES/SEM) and UV light source) using nonmonochromated MgKα radiation (1253.6 eV). The pressure in the analysis chamber was <1 × 107 Pa. Deconvolution of the Rh and Sn peaks was performed using a sum of LorentzianGaussian functions. The binding energies were corrected using the C1s peak from carbon contamination at 284.6 eV. The amount of coke in the spent catalyst was measured using CHNS elemental analysis (on a Fision EA1108 instrument).
Coke formation can be analyzed qualitatively using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The instrument used was an iS-10 spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) with an attenuated total reflectance accessory, using a sensitivity (S/N ratio) of 35,000:1 (peak to peak), a resolution of 0.5 cm1, and a range of 6500500 cm1.
A Raman analysis (Renishaw invia Raman spectroscopy) was performed to determine the types of coke on the spent samples. Laser source: Ar laser 244 nm (UV), Nd:Yag laser 532 nm (Vis), diode laser-785 nm (Vis), 1064 nm (Near-IR); optical lens: ×50; grating: 830 l/mm (1064); scan range: 1004000 cm1.
The spent catalysts were also analyzed using the derivative thermogravimetric method (DTG) to determine the dependence of coke formation on the temperature. A Q600 (TA Instrument, U.S.) instrument was used with the following settings: DTA sensitivity 0.001 C and calorimetric accuracy/precision: 2%. The temperature range was 25800 C under air and the temperature ramping was 10 C min1. The coke weight loss can be studied using the DTG method.
The oxide samples were dried overnight at 110 C before TPR and XPS analysis. To prepare reduced samples for TEM and XPS analysis, the calcined RhSn samples were first prereduced in H2 (purity 99.99%, 20 mL min1) at 600 C for 2 h before the TEM measurements of the reduced samples. The ramping rate for the reduction temperature was 20 C min1.
After the reduction, the samples were cooled to room temperature in H2 and purged in Ar at room temperature for 4 h. The Rh and Sn contents in the prepared catalysts were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, iCAP 6000 series, Thermo, USA).
2.3. Activity measurements
PDH was carried out in a tubular quartz reactor. The internal diameter of the tubular quartz reactor was 10 mm. Typically the reaction was conducted at 600 C and atmospheric pressure using 0.10 g of the prepared catalyst (100140 mesh). The catalysts were prereduced in H2 (purity 99.99%, 20 C mL min1) at 600 C for 2 h before the reaction. The ramping rate up to 600 C was 20 C mL min1. A feed gas mixture (molar ratio of H2:N2:n-C3H8 = 1.0:1.0:1.0) was introduced into the reactor at a total flow rate of 30 mL min1 (WHSV = 10.8 h1). The compositions of the products were analyzed by online gas chromatography using a capillary column (GS-Alumina, Agilent Technologies, i.d. 0.53 mm, length 50 m). The conversion of propane was calculated based on the carbon numbers in the products.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physical properties of the prepared catalysts: X-ray diffraction and N2 sorption analysis
The prepared RhSn catalysts did not show distinctive metal phases in the XRD patterns (Fig. S2), indicating that the metals were well dispersed on the γ-Al2O3 supports. Characteristic peaks were observed at 39.3 (2 2 2), 37.5 (3 1 1), 45.6 (4 0 0), and 66.6 (4 4 0), which can be attributed to γ-Al2O3 (ICDD 290063).
The pore size distributions of the prepared catalysts (Fig. S4) were obtained from the desorption branch of the adsorptiondesorption isotherms (Fig. S3) by the BJH method. The pore size distributions of the calcined and reduced RhSn catalysts were not significantly different from that of the γ-Al2O3 support (Fig. S5). The distinctive mesopores were observed in the prepared catalysts. Table 1 shows a summary of the surface areas and total pore volumes of the prepared samples. All the samples have a similar pore diameter of ca. 5 nm in the inter-particles, a total pore volume of 0.840.92 at p/po = 0.98, and a surface area of 230265 m2 gcat1. The surface area of the Rh(0.5) was not significantly affected by Sn addition for any of the catalysts, indicating that Sn promoters are very well dispersed on the support. The reduced catalysts have surface areas (232239 m2 g1), pore volumes (1.170.87 cm3 g1), and pore size distributions (ca. 5.0 nm) similar to those of the calcined catalysts.

3.2. CO chemisorption analysis
Table 2 shows the metal content, CO adsorbed, metal dispersion, specific metal surface area, and average particle size of the prepared pristine catalysts. The loaded metal content was measured using ICP-OES. The measured amount of metal in the calcined catalysts was similar to that in the loaded precursors, indicating that the metal loss was very low during the catalyst preparation. The metal dispersion, specific metal surface area, and average particle size of the Rh metals were measured by CO chemisorption method. The metal dispersion of the Rh(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(0.15), Rh(0.5)Sn(0.3), Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(0.75), Rh(0.5)Sn(1.0), Rh(1.5)Sn(1.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(2.0), and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts was 60.9, 49.4, 50.8, 51.6, 55.7, 57.3, 61.3, 60.0, and 61.0%, respectively. When a small amount of Sn was added to Rh(0.5), the Rh metal dispersion decreased from 60.9% for Rh(0.5) to 49.4% for Rh(0.5)Sn(0.15). In contrast, the further addition of Sn increased the Rh metal dispersion, which finally reached 61.0% for Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalyst. Accordingly, the metal particle size of the RhSn catalysts was in the range 1.82.2 nm. Here, the metal dispersion of these RhSn catalysts was comparable to or a little higher than that of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared for PDH [51], [52], [53].

3.3. Temperature-programmed reduction analysis
In the TPR curves of all the prepared oxide samples up to 650 C (Fig. S6), all the curves were deconvoluted into five peaks. The summarized data for the H2 consumption are listed in Table 3. The reduction of the Rh(0.5) oxide sample started at 120 C and finished at 580 C. Four peaks are observed at 182, 269, 407, and 498 C. The total amount of H2 consumption was 0.077 mmol gcat1, indicating that the Rh was mostly in the Rh2O3 phase (Rh2O3 estimated from the H2 consumption using elementary analysis: 0.0746 mmol gcat1). The isolated reduction of Rh2O3 has been observed at 110130 C [54]. The reduction temperature of Rh2O3/γ-Al2O3 increased with a decrease in the Rh loading [55] and with an increase in the calcination temperature. Rh oxides calcined at a temperature higher than 600 C interact with γ-Al2O3, diffusing into the subsurface region and the bulk of γ-Al2O3. Then the reduction temperature of Rh2O3 on γ-Al2O3 can be increased to 600 C. As a result, the reduction of Rh oxides at 182 and 269 C can be attributed to the reduction of the dispersed phase and the reduction at 407 and 498 C can be attributed to the Rh phase interacting with the γ-Al2O3 in subsurface layers.

When Sn was added to the Rh(0.5) samples, the TPR patterns became so complex that it was difficult to analyze the origins of the reduction peaks. However, the reduction temperatures of the Rh oxides at the α, β, γ, and θ peaks shifted to lower temperatures when Sn was added to Rh(0.5). Sn addition may weaken the interaction between Rh and alumina due to the competitive interaction of Rh and Sn with the alumina support. Generally, the loaded Sn oxides are not fully reduced even in the presence of Rh until the H2 reduction at 700 C, which has also been attributed to the strong interaction between SnOx and alumina [56].
The reduction at γ and θ can be attributed to the co-reduction of Rh and Sn oxides. The reduction peak at δ can be assigned mainly to the reduction of Sn oxides. The reduction of Sn oxides can be promoted by hydrogen spillover in the presence of Rh [57].
3.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of the oxide and the reduced RhSn catalysts
Table 4 summarizes the binding energy of Sn from the deconvolution of the XPS spectra (Fig. S7). The XPS data of the calcined catalysts show that the Sn oxides in all the RhSn samples are in the mixed phase of SnO2 and SnO after calcining at 600 C for 3 h. The atomic percentages of SnO2 (%) in the total Sn were 59% for Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), 64% for Rh(0.5)Sn(1.0), 68% for Rh(1.5)Sn(1.5), 73% for Rh(0.5)Sn(2.0), and 89% for Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0). The atomic percentage of SnO2 in the total Sn of the RhSn oxide samples increased with an increase in the Sn content on Rh(0.5). After the reduction of the RhSn catalysts at 600 C for 2 h, the atomic amount of metallic Sn in the total Sn was 17% for the Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5) catalyst, 19% for the Rh(0.5)Sn(1.0) catalyst, 28% for the Rh(1.5)Sn(1.5) catalyst, 20% for the Rh(0.5)Sn(2.0) catalyst, and 24% for the Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalyst.

Fig. 1 shows the XPS spectra of Rh3d and Table 5 summarizes the binding energies and the valence states of Rh after the reduction of the catalysts at 600 C for 2 h in H2. Rh3+ was observed at 10 at.% on Rh(0.5), 7 at.% on Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), and 5 at.% on Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5) after the reduction. The metallic Rh (100%) was observed only on Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0). The reduced Rh on the surface may be reoxidized during the sample preparation for XPS analysis and RhSn alloy with high content may suppress the reoxidation. On the other hand, RhSn alloy may assist the reduction of Rh oxide from TPR analysis. The TPR analysis shows the probability of the complete reduction of Rh oxide at 600 C for 2 h. However, it should be noted that the binding energy of Rh(3d) is shifted to the lower value with increasing Sn content. The result indicates the intermetallic electron transfer from Sn to Rh in the RhSn alloy or bimetal. When we performed the reaction on both reduced Rh(0.5) and oxidized Rh(0.5), the cracking fraction on the oxidized Rh(0.5) was a little larger than that on the reduced Rh(0.5), but the activity on the two catalysts is not much different (Table S2).

Table 6 shows the percentage of Sn reduction calculated from the elemental analysis (Table 2), H2 consumption (Table 3), and XPS analysis (Table 4), assuming that the Rh oxides are completely reduced. The molar H2 consumption ratio to Rh with Rh(0.5) was 1.65, indicating that Rh2O3 was the main oxide phase of the calcined Rh(0.5). Table 6 shows that the reduction percentage of the Sn oxide on the surface (from XPS analysis) is a little higher than that in the bulk (from TPR analysis).

Once the Sn oxide is reduced to Sn metal, Sn migrates into the Rh, resulting in a highly reductive RhSn alloy at 600 C. Assuming that all the reduced Sn metal on the surface is present in the RhSn alloy or RhSn bimetals, the average RhSn composition on the surfaces of catalysts from XPS is estimated to be Rh1.0Sn0.25 for the reduced Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5) catalyst, Rh1.0Sn0.35 for the reduced Rh(0.5)Sn(1.0) catalyst, Rh1.0Sn0.79 for the reduced Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5) catalyst, Rh1.0Sn0.82 for the reduced Rh(0.5)Sn(2.0) catalyst, and Rh1.0Sn1.43 for the reduced Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalyst. Because the presence of isolated Sn cannot be completely excluded, it is expected that the real Sn content in the RhSn alloy will be a little lower than the above estimated average alloy composition.
3.5. Morphology and RhSn alloy formation of the catalysts from TEM, STEM and EDS mapping analyses
Fig. 2 shows the particle size distribution of the reduced Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5), and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts from STEM images by a Talos TEM microscope. The average particle size of the reduced catalysts was calculated with more than 100 metallic particles using Image J (1.46r, National Institute of Health, USA). The metallic particle sizes of the reduced Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5), and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts are 1.4, 1.5, and 1.9 nm from the TEM analysis with reduced catalysts, respectively. The particle size of the reduced catalysts from the TEM analysis is comparatively matching with the data obtained from the CO chemisorption.

HR-STEM images from a Titan TEM microscope (Fig. S8) show that the particles of 1.41.9 nm are composed of randomly distributed atomic level particles (0.1 nm), indicating that the particles from the STEM images (Talos TEM microscope) are not single alloy phases but aggregates of a few atomic particles. However, when we examined the fringes of Talos TEM of scattered large particles of 610 nm, it is confirmed that the ratio of Sn to Rh on the RhSn alloy increases with an increase in the Sn-to-Rh ratio on the RhSn catalysts (Fig. S9). When we analyze the composition of Rh and Sn with the Talos TEM-EDX analysis (Fig. S10), it is shown that the composition of Rh and Sn is close to the composition of ICP-OES analysis (Table S3), indicating that the composition of Rh and Sn in small area is similar to that of the bulk Rh Sn composition. The TEM-EDX mapping (Fig. S11) shows that the Rh particles on the support are mostly positioned near the Sn particles. Therefore, the extensive TEM analysis shows that the nanoparticles (1.41.9 nm) are aggregates of a few atomic particles. The extensive TEM analysis shows that the particles of 1.41.9 nm from Talos-TEM are composed of a few atomic levels of Rh, Sn, and RhSn bimetallic alloy.
Therefore, it is more reliable that the calculated metallic ratio of Sn to Rh from the reduction percentage of Sn oxides (TPR and XPS analysis) is close to the metallic ratio of Sn to Rh on the particles of 1.41.9 nm. Thus, it is inferred that the Sn content in the RhSn alloy or bimetals increases with the addition of Sn on the average composition (Table 6).
3.6. Propane dehydrogenation on the prepared catalysts
Fig. 3 shows the propane (C3) conversion and propylene (C3=) selectivity at 600 C and a WHSV of 10.8 h1. The catalytic performances are summarized in Table 7. The initial C3 conversion of the Pt(0.5) and Rh(0.5) catalysts was 18.1% and 10.7%, respectively. After 5 h of reaction, Rh(0.5) exhibited a final yield of 1.8%, while Pt(0.5) showed 11.8%, indicating that the dehydrogenation on Rh(0.5) was insignificant for PDH (Table 7)

The Pt(0.5) catalyst mainly has active sites for dehydrogenation (C3= selectivity: 83.1%), while the Rh(0.5) catalyst mainly has active sites for cracking (C1C2 selectivity: 73.5%; Table S2). Table S4 shows the normalized product distribution of the cracking products using the Rh(0.5) and Pt(0.5) catalysts, respectively. The amount of methane in the cracking products on Rh(0.5) was much higher than that on Pt(0.5). Recent DFT calculation on Pt and PtSn in propane dehydrogenation agrees that the cracking barrier to methane is higher than that to propylene so that methane is produced from methylidyne and ethylidyne via propyne (intermediates of deep dehydrogenation [20], [39], [40], [41].
If methane is a primary product of propane, the conversion of Rh(0.5) (conversion: 10.7%) should not be so low as that of Rh(0.5)Sn(0.15) (conversion: 25.6%), because Sn addition should suppress both propane cracking and dehydrogenation activity. Therefore, it can be deduced that the deep dehydrogenation on Rh(0.5) is very severe, because the desorption barrier for intermediates during dehydrogenation is very high compared to Pt(0.5). Furthermore, C2 products are not produced and methane is mainly produced on Rh(0.5) (Table S5). The low C3 conversion of Rh(0.5) is ascribed to fast coke formation to cover the surface of Rh(0.5). Methane on Rh(0.5) can be produced mainly through the cracking of strongly adsorbed intermediates (Table S5), similarly to Pt [41]. On the other hand, C2 species are rarely observed. In the short-term PDH reaction (every 30 s until 6 min; Fig. S12b), the conversion of Rh(0.5) at 30 s is 22.8% and the deactivation is very fast. Methane is mainly produced on Rh(0.5). On the other hand, it should be noted that ethane and ethylene are co-produced with methane on Pt(0.5) in Table S4a. Therefore, the short-term experiments support the conclusion that methane on Rh(0.5) can be produced from the cracking of the strongly adsorbed intermediate of deep dehydrogenation. In C3H8 TPD (Fig. S13), most of the adsorbed propane (m/z: 29) is desorbed at temperatures lower than 300 C, while propylene (m/z: 41) is completely desorbed at 390 C with Rh(0.5), 485 C with Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), and 560 C with Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0). H2 desorption at high temperature is ascribed to the onset of dehydrogenation, indicating that coke formation through further dehydrogenation on Rh(0.5) occurs at much lower temperature than that on the Sn-added Rh(0.5) catalysts. Methane (m/z: 16) desorption is maximized at the temperature where desorption of propane and propylene stops, indicating that methane is mostly generated through deep dehydrogenation. The absence of a C2 fragment at high temperature in C3H8 TPD (Fig. S13) supports the conclusion that methane is mainly produced through deep dehydrogenation. The intensity of methane is very high with Rh(0.5), as compared with Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5) and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0). So it can be concluded that Sn addition retarded deep dehydrogenation and suppressed the cracking of strongly adsorbed intermediates during dehydrogenation.
PDH occurs in two stages: (1) quick deactivation within the first tens of minutes by a fast coke formation and (2) a stable steady state after the first stage [58].
When a small amount of Sn (0.15 wt%) was added to Rh(0.5), the C3 conversion and the C3= selectivity were dramatically enhanced. The initial C3 conversion and C3= selectivity with Rh(0.5)Sn(0.15) were 25.6 and 79.9%, respectively. The C3 conversion increased with increasing amounts of Sn in the RhSn catalysts. The initial conversion of the Rh(0.5)Sn(0.15), Rh(0.5)Sn(0.3), Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(0.75), Rh(0.5)Sn(1.0), Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(2.0), and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts were 25.6, 26.4, 27.8, 31.1, 31.7, 31.5, 29.5, and 30.8%, respectively. The C3 conversion for the RhSn catalysts with more than 1.0 wt% Sn is similar. On the other hand, the C3= selectivity and stability of all the RhSn catalysts also clearly increased with increasing amounts of Sn. Finally, the C3= yield of the Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalyst after 5 h of reaction (26.8%) was the highest among the prepared catalysts.
Sn has been used as a good promoter for increasing the olefin selectivity of Pt catalysts in light alkane dehydrogenation [24], [27], [32], [44]. The geometric and electronic effects resulting in the effects of Sn on Pt in light alkane dehydrogenation have been discussed [24], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. The effect of Sn on Rh can also be explained in the same way, although the Sn effect on Rh in PDH was much more pronounced than that on Pt (Fig. 4 and Fig. S1). Nonetheless, the significant improvement in dehydrogenation on RhSn is unusual compared to that of PtSn when a small amount of Sn is added to Rh(0.5).

Fig. 4. Catalytic performance of prepared RhSn catalysts with respect to Sn/Pt (weight ratio) at a WHSV rate of 10.8 h1.
The PtSn catalytic system has so far been considered to be the best catalyst for PDH in terms of conversion and selectivity [13], [55], [57], [59], [60], [61], [62]. The amount of Sn in the PtSn catalysts has been optimized at a Sn/Pt weight ratio of 1.01.5 for PDH (Fig. S1) [44], [59]. Figs. 4, S1, Table S1, Fig. S14, and Table S6 show a brief and comparative study (initial conversion and selectivity) to clarify the effect of different amounts of Sn on the RhSn and PtSn catalysts in the range between 500 and 600 C. The initial C3 conversion with the PtSn catalysts increased up to a Sn/Pt weight ratio of 1.5 and then decreased with the further addition of Sn [32]. The excess Sn suppressed the C3 conversion of the PtSn catalysts. From these observations, it has been claimed that Pt3Sn1 or Pt2Sn1 is an active phase for PDH [43], [44], [59]. The reported DFT calculations [39] have shown that the activation energy for PDH on Pt increases with increasing amounts of Sn, while the adsorption energy of 1-propyl on Pt decreases. Thus, a PtSn alloy with an intermediate PtSn composition, Pt3Sn1 or Pt2Sn1, has been claimed to be the optimum phase for PDH, with decreased activity and increased selectivity due to Sn addition.
In contrast, no optimized Sn/Rh ratio was observed with Sn/Rh weight ratios up to 6.0. The average Sn/Rh atomic ratio from elemental analysis and XPS increased with increasing amounts of Sn. Therefore, it can be concluded that the addition of Sn enhanced the yield of propylene by suppressing the cracking via deep dehydrogenation without an optimized RhSn composition. On the other hand, the RhSn catalysts with more than 1.0 wt% Sn exhibited a similar C3 conversion and metal dispersion. It is clear that the C3= selectivity increased with increasing amounts of Sn in the RhSn catalysts.
To clarify the Sn effect on the intrinsic catalytic activity, the catalytic activity was examined with respect to W/F (Fig. S15). W/F values of 63.1 (s), 126.2 (s), and 252.4 (s) are equivalent to WHSV values of 43.3, 21.7, and 10.8 h1, respectively. It is clear from the data at 43.3 h1 that the C3 conversion of the RhSn catalysts, as well as the C3= selectivity, increases with increasing Sn content. At a low WHSV of 10.8 h1, the similar conversion for RhSn catalysts with more than 0.75 wt% Sn content is shown. Accordingly, there was no great difference in turnover frequency (TOF) at a WHSV of 10.8 h1, whereas the TOF values at the higher WHSV of 43.3 h1 increased with an increase in Sn content. The TOF of Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5), and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts was 2.03, 2.09, and 2.65 s1 at WHSV of 43.3 h1, respectively (Fig. S16). TOF increased with an increase in Sn content on RhSn catalysts.
3.7. Long-term stability of the RhSn catalysts
Fig. 5 shows the longer-term stability tests over 20 h for Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5), and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) at 600 C and a WHSV of 10.8 h1. The catalytic performances are summarized in Table 8. The deactivation parameters for the Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5), and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts were 58.3, 36.0, and 27.2%, respectively. The longer-term stability clarified the higher stability, as well as C3= selectivity, of the RhSn catalysts with higher Sn content.

CO chemisorption of the spent Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(2.0), and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts after 5 and 20 h was performed after two different pretreatments: (1) CO chemisorption after H2 re-reduction at 600 C for 2 h following coke removal by oxidation at 600 C for 1 h, and (2) CO chemisorption after H2 re-reduction at 600 C for 2 h. The Rh dispersal without coke removal (DCOH2) is much smaller than DCOO2, indicating that the exposed metal is significantly covered by coke during the reaction. The ratio of DCOH2 to DCOO2 was the highest with Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0), indicating that coke formation was significantly suppressed due to Sn addition to Rh(0.5), supporting the conclusion that the low C3 conversion with Rh(0.5) is due to fast coke formation to cover the metal surface of Rh(0.5).
The Rh particle size of the spent catalysts determined by the CO chemisorption after coke removal (NCOO2) was a little smaller than that measured by TEM (NSTEM). However, the particle sizes determined from the TEM analysis indicate that the metal continued to be sintered during the reaction. On the other hand, the metal sintering of Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5) is very severe compared with that of Rh(0.5)Sn(1.5) and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0). It is clear that both the coke formation and metal sintering of RhSn with a high Sn content are strongly suppressed, which may be one of the reasons for the higher stability of RhSn with a higher Sn content.
From Table 9, the low C3 conversion with Rh(0.5) can be ascribed to fast coke formation via deep dehydrogenation in the initial stage. The Sn addition suppressed the coke formation, increasing the C3 conversion. Generally, it has been known that coke forms on metal in alkane dehydrogenation, which migrates to the support [63]. TEM analysis shows that the severe coke on both the metal and support of the Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5) catalyst was observed and the metal is almost covered by coke, and Sn addition suppressed the coke formation on both Rh and support (Fig. S17). Again, the low C3 conversion may be due to the fast and severe coke formation to cover the metal and the low C3= selectivity can be due to the high barrier of propylene desorption inducing the deep dehydrogenation. On Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0), coke is observed mainly on the support, indicating that coke on metal can be spilt to the support.
TG-DTA and molecular spectroscopy have been used to monitor coke formation on metallic catalysts. TG-DTA (thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis) experiments were carried out to examine the formation of coke during the reaction time. Fig. 6 shows the DTG curves of the spent (after 5 h) catalysts from the TGA curves (Figs. S18aS18d) and Table 10 summarizes the amounts of coke determined from the TGA and CHN analyses. The amounts of coke determined from TGA were greater than those from the CHN analysis. The amount of coke determined by CHN may be more accurate because the weight loss from TGA can include errors from the buoyancy force and impurities such as water due to surface hydroxyls. Two typical DTG curves for cokes were observed for PDH. Peak I at low temperature can be assigned to coke on the metal and peak II can be assigned to coke on the support [64], [65], [66]. If coke forms on the intrinsic acid sites of the supports, the amount of coke should not be related to the amount of active metal. However, the amount of coke on the support decreased with an increase in the amount of Sn. As a result, it has been thought that the coke on the metal migrated to the support during the PDH reaction. Several authors have suggested that Sn in PtSn facilitates the migration of coke from the metal to the support [63], [67], [68].

However, Fig. 6 and Table 10 indicate that Sn does not play a decisive role in coke migration. Rather, the coke percentage on the support (peak II) was the highest with Rh(0.5) and the amount of coke on the support decreased with increasing amounts of Sn. Therefore, it is clear that a simple drain-off effect dominates the coke migration. When the coke accumulates on the metal, the coke migration can be promoted irrespective of the active metal. A DFT calculation with PtSn has indicated that the propylene at the PtSn bridge site can be relaxed to form a PtPt bridge [39]. Similarly, the propylene at the RhSn sites can migrate to Rh-rich sites, where coke can form via deep dehydrogenation. Thus, the amount of coke on RhSn decreased with increasing amounts of Sn because coke formation via deep dehydrogenation is favored at Rh rich sites. Therefore, coke migration may be more limited in RhSn catalysts with higher amounts of Sn.
Fig. 7 shows the convoluted (A) and deconvoluted (B) Raman spectra of the spent (after 5 h) catalysts: [(a1)(d1)] and [(a2)(d2)] of Rh(0.5), Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5), Rh(1.5)Sn(1.5), and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalysts, respectively. Five major peaks at 1335, 1597, 2683, 2917, and 3150 cm1 are observed for the spent Rh(0.5) catalysts. The bands from 2656 to 2926 cm1 (methylene type) can be assigned to aliphatic hydrocarbons. The bands from 3150 to 3183 cm1 can be assigned to aromatic carbons [69]. The area ratio of the aromatic CH to aliphatic CH (Table 11) decreases with increasing amounts of Sn, indicating that the presence of Sn suppresses the formation of aromatic carbons.

The bands at 13301335 (D band) and 15811600 cm1 (G band) can be assigned to graphite-like carbon species [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75] (Table 12). Here, we observed a band at the front shoulder of the D band (12351260 cm1), which is designated a-D. The band at the front shoulder of the G band (15071542 cm1) is designated a-G. The bands at a-D and a-G were assigned to the turbostratic or random structure [73], [76], [77].

The G mode is the stretching vibration of any pair of sp2 sites [26], [78]. Thus, the G band can be seen even without the long-range order of the graphite structure, if any pair of sp2 sites are present. Therefore, the a-D and a-G bands are prominent features of the D and G bands of tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) and its hydrogenated analog (ta-C:H) with a higher sp3 content.
The D band cannot be seen in perfect graphite with a long-range graphite structure. Therefore, the IDI/IG ratio has been used to identify graphitization. The position of the G band in the Raman spectra, as shown in Fig. 7 (1600 cm1), is much higher than the position of the G band in perfect graphite (1580 cm1). The higher energy of the G band can be attributed to nanocrystalline graphite or completely disordered sp2-bonded carbon (a-C). In that case, the D band indicates ordering, exactly the opposite of the case of long-range ordered graphite [78].
Therefore, the increase in IDI/IG means an increase in the number of aromatic rings. Here, IDI/IG decreases with increasing amounts of Sn, as shown in Table 12, which means that the amounts of aromatic carbon decrease with increasing amounts of Sn. Fig. 8 shows the Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) of all the spent Rh and RhSn catalysts after 5 and 20 h of reaction. The absorption bands between 1400 and 1450 cm1 can be ascribed to the skeleton vibrations of branched aliphatics [79].

The bands between 1640 and 1680 cm1 represent the C = C stretching vibrations of alkenes [80] and the bands between 1500 and 1630 cm1 can be assigned to the C = C vibrations of aromatics [81]. The spent Rh(0.5) catalyst shows both aromatic and unsaturated aliphatic species. The intensity of the aromatic bands decreases gradually with increasing amounts of Sn on Rh, while the branched aliphatic bands slightly increase. However, the stretching vibrations of the unsaturated aliphatic carbon remain in all the spent catalysts. It should be noted that no aromatic carbon bands are observed on the RhSn catalysts with Sn content of more than 1.0 wt%, which implies that the formation of aromatic intermediates is suppressed on the RhSn alloy, improving the stability of the catalysts in the first stage. However, the accumulation of aromatic intermediates on the RhSn catalysts was observed a little after 20 h, indicating that coke formation can also affect the long-term stability. Nonetheless, the aromatic intermediates on Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) were almost negligible even after 20 h.
As explained earlier, the Rh(0.5) catalyst showed very low C3 conversion and C3= selectivity. The low C3= selectivity with Rh(0.5) can be attributed to the high barrier for propylene desorption. Accordingly, cracking via deep dehydrogenation (methane formation) predominantly occurred on Rh(0.5). Very low C3 conversion may be due to the blocking of the Rh metal sites by fast coke formation in the initial stage. The short-term experiments (Fig. S12) and C3H8 TPD experiments (Fig. S13) support the explanations. A small amount of added Sn (0.15 wt%) drastically improved both the C3 conversion and the C3= selectivity. The C3 conversion and the C3= selectivity were improved by adding Sn to Rh(0.5) up to 3 wt%. Table 9, Table 10 indicate that both Rh sintering and coke formation were significantly suppressed by the addition of Sn, resulting in high activity and stability. This apparent behavior of RhSn is quite different from that of PtSn. On PtSn, the addition of Sn increases the activation energy for PDH, thereby reducing the C3 conversion, while it decreased the desorption barrier, resulting in high selectivity. Thus, it has been suggested that Pt3Sn or Pt2Sn is the active species for PDH. However, the role of Sn addition should be the same for both PtSn and RhSn. In the case of Rh, coke formation is much worse than on Pt. Therefore, Sn addition suppresses severe coke formation to maintain the activity of Rh, which overcomes the loss of the intrinsic activity of PDH. Thus, the C3 conversion is increased by Sn addition. Even with Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0), coke is generated to such an extent that the main role of Sn is to enhance the C3 conversion. However, the desorption barrier of propylene may also be decreased by Sn addition, similar to PtSn.
4. Conclusions
Rh(0.5)Sn(x.x)/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with different amounts of Sn were prepared and examined for PDH. Rh (0.5 wt%) was loaded onto γ-Al2O3 support (Rh(0.5)), and a Sn amount of 0.153.0 wt% was added to the Rh(0.5). The Rh(0.5) catalyst showed very low C3 conversion and very low C3= selectivity compared with the Pt(0.5) catalyst. The Rh(0.5)Sn(0.15) catalyst with a low amount of Sn drastically improved both the C3 conversion and C3= selectivity. The C3 conversion, C3= selectivity, and stability of the RhSn catalysts are increased with increasing amounts of Sn. Rh(0.5) showed methane selectivity of  84% with negligible C2 species at the similar conversion to Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) at the initial activity test at 30 s. On the other hand, Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) showed high propylene selectivity of 96% even at the initial activity at 30 s. C3H8 TPD curves exhibit that methane (m/z: 16) desorption is maximized at the temperature where desorption of propane and propylene stops, indicating that methane is mainly generated by the cracking of intermediates through deep dehydrogenation. Corresponding to the reaction, the intensity of desorbed methane is very high on Rh(0.5) and the deep dehydrogenation is pronounced as compared with Sn-added Rh catalysts. Therefore, we conclude that suppressing the cracking through deep dehydrogenation is the main effect of Sn on Rh for PDH.
