[1] "Pt(0.5) catalyst mainly has active sites for dehydrogenation (C3= selectivity: 83.1%), while the Rh(0.5) catalyst mainly has active sites for cracking (C1C2 selectivity: 73.5%)."

[2] "The Pt(0.5) catalyst showed initial C3 conversion of 18.1% and mainly had active sites for dehydrogenation." 

[3] "The amount of methane in the cracking products on Rh(0.5) was much higher than that on Pt(0.5)."

<quotes>

[1] "The primary product of Rh(0.5) is methane (65%) at the initial time and severe coke formation covers the exposed Rh metal."

[2] "Methane on Rh(0.5) can be produced mainly through the cracking of strongly adsorbed intermediates." 

[3] "The absence of a C2 fragment at high temperature in C3H8 TPD (Fig. S13) supports the conclusion that methane is mainly produced through deep dehydrogenation."

[4] "The intensity of methane is very high with Rh(0.5), as compared with Rh(0.5)Sn(0.5) and Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0)."  

[5] "Therefore, we conclude that suppressing the cracking through deep dehydrogenation is the main effect of Sn on Rh for PDH."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

8. Yes, the article proposes that on Rh(0.5), methane is mainly produced through deep dehydrogenation and cracking of strongly adsorbed intermediates during propane dehydrogenation. It concludes that the main role of adding Sn is to suppress this deep dehydrogenation and cracking, thereby improving selectivity.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

8. 是的,文章提出在Rh(0.5)上,甲烷主要是通过丙烷脱氢过程中的深度脱氢和强吸附中间体的裂化生成的。它总结说添加Sn的�要作用是抑制这种深度脱氢和裂化,从而提高选�性。
