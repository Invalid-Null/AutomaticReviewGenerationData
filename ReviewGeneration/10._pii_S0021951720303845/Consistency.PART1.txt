 Here is the comparison of the answer files with the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},

  "6": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "67%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "8": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I carefully compared the English answer from each file to the correct English answer for each question. I calculated the consistency ratio as the percentage of key points covered between the two answers. 100% indicates complete consistency, while lower percentages indicate missing or incorrect information compared to the correct answer. The JSON shows the consistency ratio for each answer file on each question.
