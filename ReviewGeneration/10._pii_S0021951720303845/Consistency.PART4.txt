 Here is the comparison of the answer files to the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "answer.PART4_0.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART4_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_2.txt": "100%", 
    "answer.PART4_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer.PART4_0.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART4_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "3": {
    "answer.PART4_0.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART4_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "4": {
    "answer.PART4_0.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART4_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "5": {
    "answer.PART4_0.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART4_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "6": {
    "answer.PART4_0.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART4_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "7": {
    "answer.PART4_0.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART4_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_2.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART4_4.txt": "100%"
  }
}
```

I analyzed each answer file and compared it to the correct answers to determine the consistency percentage for each question. The `answer.PART4_0.txt` file did not actually provide answers, so it received 0% consistency. The other files provided the expected "No relevant quotes" and brief answers indicating the literature did not address the topic, so they were marked as 100% consistent.
