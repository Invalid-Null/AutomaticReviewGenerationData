To generate the consistency percentages, I compared the answers from each file to the correct answers provided. Since all the answer files stated there were no relevant quotes and gave brief statements indicating the literature did not discuss any of the topics asked about in the questions, I assessed the answers from each file as being 100% consistent with the correct answers.

I formatted the output into the requested XML structure, with a <question> element for each question number, containing <answer> elements with the consistency percentage for each answer file. Since the answers were fully consistent across files, all percentages are 100%. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
