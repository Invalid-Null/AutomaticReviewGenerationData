<quotes>
[1] "To improve the density of the edge sites, an efficient strategy is to reduce the size of the BN nanosheet and increase the edge/surface ratio."

[2] "Su et al. prepared BN nanosheets with a high edge/surface ratio by the reaction of boric acid and urea mixtures at 1000 °C for 5 h under an N2 atmosphere, which contained a larger number of effective 1-D sites than bulk BN, achieving high olefin selectivity at higher alkanes conversion."

[3] "The boron oxide supported on 3-D mesoporous silica (B2O3/SBA-15) and 3-D honeycomb cordierite (B2O3/SiO2@HC) catalysts were thoroughly studied. The results showed that the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species were currently identified as the active sites.The 3-D dispersed active sites can be significantly increased compared with the linearly dispersed edge sites."

[4] "Eswaramoorthy and co-workers developed a high-surface-area BN catalyst with a BET-specific surface area of 1380 m2/g by the reaction of boric acid and dicyandiamide, which far exceeded the commercial bulk BN (48 m2/g)." 

[5] "By doping the active boron oxide/on hydroxyl units on the surface of diverse hosting materials, a 2-D dispersion of the active sites can be achieved."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specific techniques discussed include reducing the size of BN sheets to increase edge site density, supporting boron oxide species on high surface area silica, and dispersing boron species across 2D surfaces of various materials. Examples given include high surface area BN from boric acid and urea, B2O3 supported on SBA-15 and cordierite, and 2D dispersions on various borides.

[1] "In situ FTIR characterization and isotopic labeling experiments were conducted. In situ IR spectroscopy demonstrated that the intensity of BOH vibration continually weakened with the introduction of O2 to the propane atmosphere." 

[2] "Online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS) was used to capture the gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3·) in the ODHP reaction over B-based catalysts, which provided direct evidence to demonstrate the existence of gas-phase radicals."

[3] "The gas-phase methyl radical signal (m/z = 15) and propene (C3H6, m/z = 42) were observed throughout the ODHP reaction over h-BN catalysts and BOx/SiO2."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specific examples include in-situ FTIR to monitor BOH species during reaction, and online SVUV-PIMS to detect gas-phase radicals like CH3 during ODHP over h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts. These provide insights into surface intermediates and gas-phase radical mechanisms.
