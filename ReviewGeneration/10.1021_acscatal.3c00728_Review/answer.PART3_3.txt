<quotes>
[1] "The high reactivity and selectivity of the BN materials and their excellent stability resulted in substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity, which was comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation and thus drove a new trend of the application of metal-free materials in ODHP."

[2] "Creating defects and holes in the plane of the BN nanosheet is also an efficient method for creating 2-D dispersed active sites."

[3] "Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process."

[4] "Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Answer: Yes, the article does investigate catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like creating defects in BN sheets to increase active sites (Quote 2), controlling pore structure to improve mass transport (Quote 3), and loading or doping boron species into 3D porous supports to disperse them and increase stability (Quote 4). The goal is to enhance catalytic activity and selectivity, like for propylene (Quote 1).

[1] "Shi et al. designed edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (denoted as BNOH) using a sodium-assisted high-temperature steam activation process achieving high activity and selectivity toward propylene (up to 80.2%) at a higher propane conversion (20.6%, Figure 3a,b)."

[2] "The XPS and 2-D 11B multiple quantum magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) observed two types of B oxygen coordination of BOB and BOH (Figure 3a), which were attributed to the oxygen functionalization of the edge sites." 

[3] "Under the reaction conditions, the surfaces of BN-based and boron oxide-based catalysts undergo oxygen functionalization, generating BOx active species. Shi et al. further studied how BOx active species participated in the reaction of ODHP using in situ FTIR characterization and isotopic labeling experiments."

[4] "Recently, Huang et al. used online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS) to capture the gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3·) in the ODHP reaction over B-based catalysts, which provided direct evidence to demonstrate the existence of gas-phase radicals."

4. Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques like NMR (Quote 2), FTIR (Quote 3), and mass spectrometry (Quote 4) to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. These reveal insights into the oxygen coordination states of active boron sites during reaction (Quotes 2-3) and detect gas-phase radical intermediates (Quote 4).
