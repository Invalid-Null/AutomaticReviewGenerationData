[1] "The high reactivity and selectivity of the BN materials and their excellent stability resulted in substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity, which was comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation and thus drove a new trend of the application of metal-free materials in ODHP."

[2] "Creating defects and holes in the plane of the BN nanosheet is also an efficient method for creating 2-D dispersed active sites."

[3] "Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process."

[4] "Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites."

[2] "The XPS and 2-D 11B multiple quantum magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) observed two types of B oxygen coordination of BOB and BOH (Figure 3a), which were attributed to the oxygen functionalization of the edge sites." 

[3] "Under the reaction conditions, the surfaces of BN-based and boron oxide-based catalysts undergo oxygen functionalization, generating BOx active species. Shi et al. further studied how BOx active species participated in the reaction of ODHP using in situ FTIR characterization and isotopic labeling experiments."

[4] "Recently, Huang et al. used online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS) to capture the gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3·) in the ODHP reaction over B-based catalysts, which provided direct evidence to demonstrate the existence of gas-phase radicals."

[1] "To improve the density of the edge sites, an efficient strategy is to reduce the size of the BN nanosheet and increase the edge/surface ratio."

[2] "Su et al. prepared BN nanosheets with a high edge/surface ratio by the reaction of boric acid and urea mixtures at 1000 °C for 5 h under an N2 atmosphere, which contained a larger number of effective 1-D sites than bulk BN, achieving high olefin selectivity at higher alkanes conversion."

[3] "The boron oxide supported on 3-D mesoporous silica (B2O3/SBA-15) and 3-D honeycomb cordierite (B2O3/SiO2@HC) catalysts were thoroughly studied. The results showed that the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species were currently identified as the active sites.The 3-D dispersed active sites can be significantly increased compared with the linearly dispersed edge sites."

[4] "Eswaramoorthy and co-workers developed a high-surface-area BN catalyst with a BET-specific surface area of 1380 m2/g by the reaction of boric acid and dicyandiamide, which far exceeded the commercial bulk BN (48 m2/g)." 

[5] "By doping the active boron oxide/on hydroxyl units on the surface of diverse hosting materials, a 2-D dispersion of the active sites can be achieved."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specific techniques discussed include reducing the size of BN sheets to increase edge site density, supporting boron oxide species on high surface area silica, and dispersing boron species across 2D surfaces of various materials. Examples given include high surface area BN from boric acid and urea, B2O3 supported on SBA-15 and cordierite, and 2D dispersions on various borides.
