[1] Combining the results from theoretical and experimental studies, we can conclude that the Pt nanoparticles (>1 nm) have a higher capacity for accommodating Sn species than subnanometer Pt clusters, resulting in the formation of PtSn alloy nanoparticles, while the Pt clusters with small particle sizes tend to form Pt-rich clusters with low Sn contributions.
[2] These lessons could be further translated to other Pt-based bimetallic or even multi-metallic catalysts, (17) though the choice of the second metal as the co-catalyst (for instance, using Cu, In, Zn, or Ga instead of Sn) may influence the optimum size of the Pt sites. (16,5153)

[1] "In addition to improving the olefin selectivity, increasing the P/Ru ratio leads to higher turnover rates and lowers the deactivation rate. P is thought to act as a structural promoter to reduce the Ru ensemble size, decreasing the hydrogenolysis rate."
         [2] "For Group 8 transition metals, the chemical properties are determined by the energy of the filled d orbitals, for example, 4d orbitals in Ru. As shown in Figures 2 and 3A, the formation of the Ru-P bond affects the XPS and XANES spectra, resulting in a shift to higher 3d binding energy and K-edge XANES (1 s to 5p transition) of the Ru." 
         [3] "Although these are not the energy of the Ru 4d valence orbitals, a recent study of Pt3V intermetallic alloys showed that an increase in the Pt 4f XPS binding energy and L3-edge XANES energy correlated with a decrease energy of the Pt-filled 5d orbitals determined by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS)."

Thus it can be proposed that 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst contains GaPt alloy nanoclusters as well as a part of isolated GaIII sites."

         [2] "A small shift of binding energies in Pt 4f core levels to the higher binding energies for 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 (71.6 eV) can be found compared with 0.1Pt@S-1 (71.2 eV). The higher electron binding energy may be ascribed to the formation of GaPt alloy during the reduction process."

         [3] "Compared with 0.1Pt@S-1, these CO adsorption peaks are red-shifted to 2022 and 1995 cm-1 for 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1, which strongly suggests a higher surface electron density over the platinum atoms because of the electron donation from the Ga species."

[1] Furthermore, the electronic structures and surface properties of bimetallic nanoparticles are strongly dependent on the spatial distribution of the two elements. By tuning the procedure for preparing the bimetallic nanoparticles or by post-synthetic treatments, the spatial distribution of the two elements as well as their chemical states can be modified and, thus, their reactivity.
         
         [2] The geometric and electronic structures of subnanometric bimetallic clusters in confined space may be different from the corresponding nanoparticles supported on open-structure carriers, which can lead to unique reactivity.

[1] Sn is a widely utilized promoter for Pt catalysts. Alloying Pt with Sn can significantly alter the electronic and geometric structure of Pt sites. The electronic effects are reflected in the reduction in the d band of Pt sites and the adjustment of reaction barriers, effectively reducing the coke formation.
          [2] The PtGa catalyst system has also been implemented in production plants (FCDh technique). Recently, Payard et al. investigated the structure-activity relationship over silica-supported PtGa nanoparticles at a molecular level. It was found that the presence of Ga could reduce the sintering of Pt sites by enhancing the interaction between the support and nanoparticles, increasing the dispersion of Pt, and accelerating the mobility of surface atoms. 
          [3] In has also been developed as a promising promoter of Pt-based catalysts. Zha et al. reported that the bimetallic alloy (Pt3In) exhibited a high activity comparable to those of pure Pt and PtSn alloys and a considerable improvement in the propylene selectivity and stability compared to pure Pt. The role of In was to promote electron transfer from In to Pt, which impacted the adsorption energy of propylene.
          [4] Zn is another analogous but economical promoter for Pt-based catalysts. Cybulskis et al. investigated the explicit influence of introducing Zn to the Pt species. The Zn selectively tuned the valence orbitals and the surface electronic structure of Pt, resulting in increased product selectivity and stable catalytic performance.

[1] "Herein, we introduce a methodology to describe the microenvironment and determine the effectiveness of active sites in a Pt-based alloy catalyst for the industrially important PDH reaction, whose target product propylene has been experiencing steady demand growth over recent decades."
         [2] "Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we construct specific models to separately identify the electronic regulation and geometric modulation of the Pt site within the PtM ensemble, and thereby define a simple descriptor, φ." 
         [3] "It depicts the degree of PtC repulsion, corresponding to a kind of isolation effect, and is thus called degree-of-isolation."
         [4] "Manifesting a moderate degree-of-isolation, PtZn IMA is the optimal catalyst, which reveals a Sabatier-type principle for designing selective single-site alloys, and the superior experimental performance of PtZn IMA has been reported recently."
         [5] "Typically, for IMAs with a high degree-of-isolation, alternation of the active centre has a great impact on tuning selectivity, validated by the synthesized PtMn IMA catalyst that exhibits more than 93% selectivity of propylene at the propane conversion of 49% at 600C."

[1] "A strategy to develop more stable platinum catalysts has relied on the preparation of bimetallic systems that include various promoter elements (e.g., Cu, Zn, Ga, In, Ge, Sn, etc.) to enhance the stability and selectivity of platinum in PDH." 
         [2] "Modification of platinums electronic structure is consistent with CO adsorption studies indicating a more electron-rich platinum surface (vide supra)."

[1] "From the aspect of the electronic effect, alloying changes the orbital energy of Pt. Normally, the energy of the filled 5d orbitals decreases, while the energy of unfilled 5d orbitals increases upon alloying, which modulates the adsorption/desorption of propylene on the active sites and reduces the possibility of deep dehydrogenation to form coke."

[1] "The formation of solely linearly-adsorbed CO hints to the existence of highly dispersed Pt species of 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta zeolite, in good agreement with TEM observations. Obviously, the presence of Zn is helpful for the dispersion of Pt species [36]."
[2] "With electrons transfer from Zn species to Pt species, the Zn species become electron-deficient and Lewis acidic thereof. In other word, the observed Lewis acidity in 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta as compared to 2Zn/Si-Beta should indicate the strong interaction between Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support."

[1] "To establish that the mixing of Sn and Pt atoms in PtSn NPs extended to their surface, we used DRIFTS to measure the infrared absorption spectra of carbon monoxide (CO), as its adsorption on Pt surfaces has been well characterized."  
         [2] "The CO-DRIFTS spectra for Pt/SiO2 and Pt1Sn1/SiO2 (Fig. 4A) revealed linear (on top) and bridge-bonded CO on Pt/SiO2 with infrared adsorption peaks at 2073 and 1821 cm−1, respectively (56, 57). On Pt1Sn1/SiO2, the bridge-bonded CO was not present, and the linearly bonded peak had much lower intensity. Because CO does not adsorb at the bridge sites between Sn and Pt, the data suggest that Sn broke the ensembles of Pt atoms on the NP surfaces and created a checkerboard Pt-Sn surface structure (58)."
         [3] "Furthermore, the Sn 3d5/2 XPS spectra in Fig. 4C show that most Sn atoms were metallic Sn, and a small fraction of Sn existed as SnO or SnO2, further confirming the formation of PtSn intermetallic NPs (63, 64)."  
         [4] "The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms."

[1] "we reveal that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke side reactions."

         [3] "The electronic effect of In on Pt is evidenced by XAFS. As seen in Fig. 6, the incorporation of In into Pt nanoparticles results in an upward shift of Pt Fermi energy and, hence, a decrease in the d band vacancy."
         [4] "Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that PtSn adsorbs ethene more weakly than pure Pt, and isotopic labeling studies conducted on PtSn/Mg(Al)O have shown that readsorption of ethene formed during ethane dehydrogenation is the primary cause of methane formation and the deposition of carbon [53], [56]. Thus, it is reasonable to propose that In addition, similar with Sn addition, causes a decrease in alkene adsorption on Pt, leading to rapid desorption of alkenes and therefore high selectivity toward alkene production."

[1] "The redshift in CO vibrational frequency might partially originate from the diminishing of dipole-dipole coupling due to Pt site isolation in PtSnx alloys.

[1] Electronic promotion is proposed to occur by the donation of electronic charge from Sn to Pt, which decreases the heat of ethene [32], [34] and propene [31] adsorption as well as increases the barrier for dissociative adsorption of light alkanes [31], which is postulated to be the rate determining step for the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt [2], [5], [35], [36], [37]. 

         [2] The geometric effect of adding Sn to Pt results from the dilution of Pt ensembles. Large ensembles of Pt surface atoms are required for some undesired side reactions including deep dehydrogenation, which leads to coke formation, and hydrogenolysis. Thus, surface dilution of Pt ensembles is thought to enhance selectivity to propene during propane dehydrogenation while decreasing coke formation [2], [4], [28], [29], [30], [32], [37].
