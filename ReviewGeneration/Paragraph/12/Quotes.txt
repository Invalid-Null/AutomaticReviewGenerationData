[1] "The addition of sulphur to Pt/alumina catalysts, both in the preparation stage and in the gas phase during reaction, has been investigated as to the effect on catalyst activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation."
            
            [2] "Predosing at 873 K had the largest effect on selectivity, allowing the formation of propene from the first pulse of propane"
            
            [3] "Adding sulphur into the catalyst preparation was more effective than subsequent addition from the gas phase."

[1] Pt/SBA-15 can be a catalyst not only for hydrogenation reactions, but also for dehydrogenation reactions. As an example, dehydrogenation of propane, which has the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers, has been investigated by many authors using Pt/SBA-15 as catalyst [126], [127], [128].

[1] "Using Pt dispersed on Al2O3 extrudate supports as a commercially relevant model system, we demonstrate that atomic layer deposition (ALD) metal oxide overcoats, used to tailor metal-active sites, can increase PDH yield and selectivity."

[2] "Among the multiple metals known to catalyze dehydrogenation where catalysts have been industrially commercialized, platinum-based catalysts are among the most successful."

[3] "In these Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, we focus on incorporation of Al or Ti overcoats throughout the length and width of the extruded catalyst."

[1] "Platinum is the most frequently used as an active metal in PDH due to its superior activation of CH bonds, low activity to CC cleavage, and environment-friendly property [1]." 

         [2] "The major issue of Pt-based catalysts in PDH is rapid deactivation caused by coke formation and metal agglomeration."

         [3] "It can be found that the conversion of propane in the initial stage was almost identical over the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/BN, and it gradually dropped over both catalysts with time on stream (Fig. 1a)."  

         [4] "Obviously, the conversion of propane on the Pt/BN decreased more slowly than that on the Pt/Al2O3, indicating better stability of the Pt/BN." 

         [5] "The Pt/BN showed a very high and stable propylene selectivity, which is close to 98% in the initial stage and more than 99% in most of reaction stages."

         [6] "We speculate that the high propylene selectivity on Pt/BN originates not only from the absence of acidity on BN support, but also from a certain kind of interaction between BN and Pt, which needs to further investigation."

[1] "The catalytic performance of Pt-Sn/SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation was evaluated and compared to that of monometallic Pt/SBA-15."
         [2] "With the addition of Sn and the formation of a Pt3Sn alloy, the initial propane conversion increases to 40%, and the propene selectivity increases to 92%, which is attributed to the geometric effect and electronic effect of the Pt-Sn alloy."

[1] "The alumina-supported monometallic Pt catalyst (Pt/Al2O3) used in this work was the same batch as that used in our previous study, which was prepared by the colloid method."

         [2] "The experimental results in Figure 3a indicate that the TOF for propane consumption () is increased by ten times when hydrogen is introduced to the inlet stream with a H2/C3H8 ratio of 1.25 and continued to increase with increasing the ratio." 

         [3] "On the other hand, the effect of the H2/C3H8 ratio on the rate for propylene production differs greatly on Pt(111) and Pt(211), as can be seen in Figure 7a."

[1] "PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst exhibits the best catalytic stability, which is evidently higher than the catalysts reported in literatures after 4 h reaction."
         [2] "The catalytic stability of PtSnIn/xCaAl catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction are markedly improved by introducing 0.6-1.5wt.% Ca species."
         [3] "The propane conversion has little decline and keep at higher level above 58.0% until 25 h reaction for the PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst in propane dehydrogenation reaction, which is evidently better than the catalysts reported in recent literatures."

[1] "In this study, we have succeeded in confining subnanometric Pt clusters inside the 14-MR channels of a structurally stable Ge-UTL zeolite via PtOGe bonds." 

         [2] "The Pt@Ge-UTL catalyst with the Pt4-Ge2-d4r@UTL structure exhibits a high catalytic activity, high propylene selectivity and an ultra-high stability for the PDH reaction."

[1] "In this work, Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are promoted with boron to enhance their performance during PDH."
   
         [2] "Specifically, promotion with 1 wt % boron decreases the amount of carbon 3-fold and increases the propylene selectivity from 90 to 98% over a 12 h PDH experiment."

[1] "The Si-BEA zeolite without Al species was obtained from the dealumination treatment of the commercial BEA zeolite with a Si/Al ratio of ∼ 20. The Co catalysts of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA were prepared through the vacuum impregnation method using supports of the BEA zeolites with/without Al species."

         [2] "Limited by the capability of the zeolites for accommodation of Co2+ cations, low Co loadings of the Co@Si-BEA catalysts allowed the Co atoms to be highly dispersed as isolated Co2+ cations, whereas high loadings led to aggregation of Co atoms into Co3O4 assembles." 

         [3] "At low loading levels (i.e., <1.0 wt%), most of Co species existed in isolated Co2+ cations and linear relationship between Co2+ amount and specific reaction rate could be achieved."

         [4] "Therefore, as evidenced by the linear correspondence with intrinsic activity, the Co2+ cations of Co@Si-BEA catalyst could act as the primary active sites in PDH reaction."

[1] "To keep the reaction conditions consistent with theoretical kinetic modeling shown in Figure 3, the experimental inlet C3H8/H2 ratio is set to be 1/1, which is experimentally reported to be able to alleviate coke formation of the Pt catalyst but is usually accompanied with low propylene selectivity."

      [2] "For comparison, the catalytic PDH performance was also examined in the presence of the Pt/Al2O3 (1 wt%) catalyst."

      [3] "As shown in Figure 4, the propylene selectivity for NiMo/Al2O3 is two times higher than Pt/Al2O3, whereas the propylene selectivity improves to 63.1% for NiMo/Al2O3 with 11.9% conversion compared with 28.5% selectivity and 16.6% conversion for Pt/Al2O3 after 6 h."

[1] "HAADF-STEM images of 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP acquired after H2 pretreatment are presented in Figure 2CE. Figure 2C shows a uniform distribution of Pt aggregates with diameters of 12 nm after H2 pretreatment." 

         [2] "Figure 2E shows that these aggregates consist of single Pt atoms (marked with red circles) and what appear to be pairs of Pt atoms (marked with yellow circles)."

         [3] "X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) characterization of 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP was done after reducing the sample in flowing H2 at 873 K for 60 min (Figure 3)."

[1] "In this work, we investigated the effects of cluster size and Sn content on cluster stability and PDH on PtxSny (x, y ≤ 4) clusters supported on γ-Al2O3(110)."

      [2] "Although the dehydrogenation energy barriers increase with increasing Ptx cluster size, the reactivity is strongly dependent on the stability of surface species."

      [3] "The activity exhibits a volcano curve with nuclearity, maximized for Pt2 whose activity is significantly high (a magic cluster-like behavior)."

      [4] "For Ptx (x > 1), the reactivity decreases with increasing cluster size, correlating with the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."

      [5] "The introduction of Sn lowers the reactivity of Pt, as has been reported in previous work. Increasing the Sn content leads to even lower reactivity."

[1] "Supported platinum catalyst has been widely used in reforming or dehydrogenation processes due to its high reaction activity [4], [5], [6]."
          [2] "In our experiments, the catalytic behavior of the PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5 sample merits to be highlighted, it exhibits the highest initial activity (40.60%) and the lowest deactivation parameter (7.3%) after the reaction for 10 h."

[1] "Considering the impurities and contaminations, the VOx/TiO2 catalysts are calcined in air at 500C before the XPS characterization. The calculated ratios of OII/OI (OI: lattice oxygen, OII: adsorbed OH in water at oxygen defects) ascribed from XPS of O1s gradually decreased with the increasing of V loadings (Supporting Information, FigureS3A,B), suggesting the VOx species might be incorporated into the defective sites of TiO2 support and induced the decreasing of defective sites."
         [2] "Therefore, the schematic diagram for the dispersion of vanadia species on the TiO2 surface was showed in the Supporting Information, FigureS3D. When the loading of V is very low, VOx species were mainly located on the defective sites of TiO2 surface. With the increasing of V loadings, the isolated and polymerized VOx species were gradually formed."

[1] "It is reported that Pd, Rh, and Ir also show high intrinsic activity for CH bond activation in propane; however, these catalysts are still expensive.”

         [3] "The data in Fig. 3A revealed that the RhCu/SiO2 SAA catalyst exhibited higher activity per mole of active metal, as well as a considerably lower reaction light-off temperature, than Pt/Al2O3."
         
         [4] "The high reactivity of the RhCu/SiO2 SAA catalyst was coupled with Cu-like propene selectivity (100% on RhCu/SiO2 SAA versus 80% on Pt/Al2O3) and resistance to coking (fig. S15 and table S4)."

[1] The article evaluates supported monometallic Ru nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation. The performance of Ru nanoparticles is compared to Pt nanoparticles and Ru phosphide nanoparticles.
         [2] At 25% propane conversion and 600°C, the propylene selectivity of monometallic Ru nanoparticles is only 4.5%. This is much lower than Pt nanoparticles (46% selectivity) and Ru phosphide nanoparticles (up to 91% for RuP).

[1] "Pt/Al2O3and PtSn/Al2O3catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."

         [2] "Three different peaks were identified from the TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst and attributed to different types of coke; coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier."
