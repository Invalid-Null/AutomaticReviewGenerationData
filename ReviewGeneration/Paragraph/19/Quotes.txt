[1] "The Ru ensemble size is smaller, and each Ru atom has four adjacent Ru atoms exposed on a (210) facet. In addition, the Ru-Ru bond distance is longer than that in metallic Ru. Further increasing the P content, that is, in RuP, leads to complete isolation of contiguous Ru atoms by P atoms."
        [2] "The specific composition and surface structures also correlate with their catalytic performance. Since hydrogenolysis and coke formation are sensitive to the surface structure, the decrease in the Ru ensemble size significantly reduces the hydrogenolysis rate."

[1] "It is known that ZnO is a weak base and ZrO2 is a weak acid. Considering acidbase properties and their influence on the product selectivity, a series of binary ZnZrxOy catalysts (denoted as ZnZr catalysts) were prepared and investigated for PDH at relatively low temperatures (400500 C)." 

         [2] "This implies that over the single Zncus site, the second step is rate-determining. The Ea on the single Zncus sites for both steps is much lower than that on the single Zrcus sites, indicative of that C3H8 dehydrogenation is more efficient over the Zncus sites."

         [3] "Therefore, through consideration of the experimental and theoretical results, it concludes that Zncus sites and Zrcus sites in ZncusOZrcus have a synergy effect on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 that the first dehydrogenation step occurs on Zncus sites and that the second step occurs on Zrcus sites in ZncusOZrcus, decreasing Ea further compared with the single Zncus and Zrcus."

[1] "Further addition of a Sn promoter has proved necessary to obtain the optimum catalyst.2"

         [2] "All of these results, especially the new band at 2010cm1 and the disappearance of the vibration at 2040cm1 in the CO DRIFT spectra, directly corroborate the hypothesis that there are strong electronic interactions between Pt and Sn in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst, while the reduced frequency of the CO vibration clearly demonstrates an increase in the electron density on Pt."

[1] "All three alloy phases show high olefin selectivity across a wide range of conversions in ethane and propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "The c-PtIn2 catalyst, which shows both the largest perturbation in Pt LIII-edge XANES energy and the largest geometric change compared to the monometallic catalyst, is the most active and stable in EDH at 600 °C."

[1] Furthermore, the electronic structures and surface properties of bimetallic nanoparticles are strongly dependent on the spatial distribution of the two elements. 

           [2] The geometric and electronic structures of subnanometric bimetallic clusters in confined space may be different from the corresponding nanoparticles supported on open-structure carriers, which can lead to unique reactivity.

[1] Alloying Pt with Sn can significantly alter the electronic and geometric structure of Pt sites.    
          [2] The Zn selectively tuned the valence orbitals and the surface electronic structure of Pt.

[1] "Therefore, the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs may be the key active site structures for PDH to propylene. The induced geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles could weaken the propylene adsorption and inhibit the structure-sensitive further dehydrogenation of propylene, leading to increased propylene selectivity and stability."
         [2] "The isolated Pt atom in [PtM4] ensembles is active for propane activation, but the neighboring coordination atoms significantly influence the electronic states of isolated Pt atom, wherein electron-richer single-atom Pt1 site in [PtZn4] coordination ensembles accounts for higher propylene selectivity."

[1] It has been demonstrated that the addition of secondary metal elements to Pt-based catalysts could decrease the number of multiple adsorption sites through partially blocked surface (ensemble effect) and/or change the electron density of states (ligand effect) [12], [13], [14], [15].
         
         [2] Thus, introducing promoters (Sn [16], [17], [18], [19], In [20], Ga [21], [22], [23], Mn [24], Cu [25], Zn [26], [27], etc.) into Pt can not only decrease the size of Pt clusters but also increase the electron density of Pt atoms, consequently affecting the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts in various catalyses.

[1] "Isolating Pt atoms by alloying with other metals, such as Sn, has been demonstrated to be effective in suppressing cracking/hydrogenolysis/coking in PDH." 
      [2] "the Pt-Sn alloy structure can be estimated based on a J factor, defined as the ratio between the experimentally measured CNPt-Sn/(CNPt-Sn + CNPt-Pt) and the theoretical values from the thermodynamically stable phases (e.g., Pt3Sn and PtSn). Thus, a J ratio closer to unity implies a greater structural resemblance of the sample to the referenced alloy."
      [3] "the formation of the PtmMn-MOx (e.g., Pt3Sn-SnOx) interfaces plays a vital role in the highly selective activation of propane and CO2."

[1] The addition of Sn to Pt propane dehydrogenation catalysts increased selectivity to propene while decreasing catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.
       
       [2] Computational modeling has suggested Pt-Sn alloys can improve the stability of propane dehydrogenation activity while decreasing the catalyst activity by increasing the barrier for dissociative adsorption of propane.
       
       [3] Experimental rate data supports this trade-off between stability and activity with increasing Sn content in Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts.

[1] The incorporation of the second metal can physically break down the large Pt ensembles, which are responsible for hydrogenolysis and coke formation and change the electronic environment of Pt to facilitate propylene desorption and slow down the deactivation process.
      [2] The promotional effect by the second metal addition to Pt has been reported to dramatically increase when intermetallic compound-type alloy nanoparticles are formed.

[1] "Microkinetic analysis combined with the results obtained from density functional theory calculations has been performed to examine the catalytic activity and selectivity of Pt-based core-shell alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
         
         [2] "The scaling relations also suggest that a higher catalyst selectivity toward propylene can only be achieved at the expense of a lower catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation."
