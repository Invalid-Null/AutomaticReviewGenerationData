{"Quotes": "[1] The incorporation of the second metal can physically break down the large Pt ensembles, which are responsible for hydrogenolysis and coke formation and change the electronic environment of Pt to facilitate propylene desorption and slow down the deactivation process.\n      [2] The promotional effect by the second metal addition to Pt has been reported to dramatically increase when intermetallic compound-type alloy nanoparticles are formed.", "English": "Yes, the article describes ensemble and ligand effects between Pt and Zn causing synergistic effects in the bimetallic catalyst. Zn modifies the electronic environment and breaks down Pt ensembles to improve selectivity and stability.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.1c01808"},
{"Quotes": "[1] \"Microkinetic analysis combined with the results obtained from density functional theory calculations has been performed to examine the catalytic activity and selectivity of Pt-based core-shell alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.\"\n         \n         [2] \"The scaling relations also suggest that a higher catalyst selectivity toward propylene can only be achieved at the expense of a lower catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation.\"", "English": "Answer: Yes, the article describes synergistic effects between Pt and the core metal in the core-shell nanoparticles, attributed to ensemble and ligand effects. It shows how the core metal modulates the selectivity and activity of the Pt shell for propane dehydrogenation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210"},
