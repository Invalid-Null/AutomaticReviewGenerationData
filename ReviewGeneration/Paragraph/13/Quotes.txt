[1] Table 4 lists the characters of Pt particle size of the two catalysts, measured from TEM, XRD and H2 chemisorption, which shows that the Pt particles of Pt/SBA-15_DP are far smaller than that of Pt/SBA-15_WI, and hence suggests that the DP method is more favorable for the preparation of small Pt particles than the WI method.

         [2] Dependence of activity on the reaction time showed that for Pt/SBA-15_DP, C3H8 conversion decreased and selectivity to C3H6 increased after a few minutes on stream. This was explained that the coke formed during the reaction improved the selectivity by deactivating the Pt sites that are highly active for Csingle bondC bond activation [22].

[1] "Increased Pt nanoparticle stability to sintering during steam deactivation tests along with increasing selectivity to propylene during catalytic tests was observed with increasing Al2O3 ALD cycles."

[2] "The gradual, nearly linear, decrease of the chemisorbed H2 amount on Pt nanoparticles with an increasing number of ALD cycles shows a very good control of layer-by-layer deposition, and STEM also demonstrates that the Pt nanoparticle size remains the same after ALD overcoating." 

[3] "The overcoated catalyst shows improved performance in terms of resistance to sintering and appears to be optimized after five to seven ALD cycles (6‒8 Å thickness of Al2O3 coating)."

[1] "The Pt/BN catalyst undergoing calcination and reduction is highly stable in PDH reaction and coke-burning regeneration, together with low coke deposition and outstanding propylene selectivity."

         [2] "It has been revealed that the high coke resistance and high propylene selectivity of the Pt/BN catalyst are derived not only from the absence of acidity on BN support, but also from the calcination-induced and reduction-adjusted SMSI between Pt and BN, which causes the partial encapsulation of Pt particles by BOx overlayers."  

         [3] "The BOx overlayers can block the low-coordinated Pt sites and constrain Pt particles into smaller ensembles, suppressing side reactions such as cracking and deep dehydrogenation." 

         [4] "Moreover, the BOx overlayers can effectively inhibit Pt sintering by the spatial isolation of Pt during periodic reaction-regeneration cycles."

[1] "The dispersion and stability of a Pt particle are the key factors, which essentially affect the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst."
         
         [2] "Characterizations with XRD, STEM, XPS, CO-IR, H2-TPR, and Py-IR techniques confirm that the Pt clusters are firmly anchored on the single Sn atom incorporated zeolitic framework, which leads to high dispersion and good stability of Pt clusters at the surface of Sn-zeolite."

[1] "Rh (0.5 wt%) was loaded onto γ-Al2O3 support (Rh(0.5)), and a Sn amount of 0.15-3.0 wt% was added to the Rh(0.5)."

[2] "The Rh(0.5) catalyst showed very low C3 conversion and very low C3= selectivity compared with the Pt(0.5) catalyst." 

[3] "The C3 conversion, C3= selectivity, and stability of the RhSn catalysts are increased with increasing amounts of Sn."

[1] "Because nanoparticles of different sizes and shapes have different relative occurrences of active sites of various types, the TOFs were evaluated on the assumption that the 5.0 nm Pt nanoparticles have an icosahedral shape."
   
         [2] "The activity of Pt(211) is orders of magnitude greater than that of Pt(111), and its selectivity toward propylene decreases steadily with the H2/C3H8 ratio, bearing close resemblance to the experiment. Thus, the under-coordinated Pt atoms cannot be completely deactivated under realistic reaction conditions and are expected to dominate the catalytic behavior of the prepared catalyst, even though terraces have a much higher mole fraction on the catalyst surface."

[1] "We have succeeded in confining subnanometric Pt clusters inside the 14-MR channels of a structurally stable Ge-UTL zeolite via PtOGe bonds. Such highly dispersed and distinctly localized Pt species were formed though the synergistic cooperation between Ge-enriched d4r units and the confining effects of the extra-large pores of the UTL topology."  

         [2] "The Pt4-Ge2-d4r@UTL structure exhibits a high catalytic activity, high propylene selectivity and an ultra-high stability for the PDH reaction."

[1] "The sequential addition of 1 wt % boron to Pt/γ-Al2O3 reduces both the activity and the amount of deposited carbon."
   
         [2] "Reversing the impregnation sequence, namely first modifying the γ-Al2O3 support with boron, followed by platinum impregnation, has a minor effect on the activity but reduces the amount of deposited carbon by a factor of 2.6."
   
         [3] "Once the most promising impregnation sequence was identified, the effect of boron loading was evaluated. Both the activity and carbon formation are affected by the boron loading."

[1] "Compared with other reported Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, (9,38) our NiMo/Al2O3 exhibits better selectivity, although the conversion is slightly lower. The Ni/Al2O3 and Mo/Al2O3 are also prepared and tested for PDH. As shown in Figure S7, the NiMo/Al2O3 showed the highest initial propylene formation compared with isolated Ni and Mo catalysts, indicating the NiMo being the main active centers."

      [2] "For the Pt/Al2O3, about 2 nm of Pt nanoparticles were determined by TEM, as shown in Figure S9."

      [3] "Well-defined nanoparticles were observed with an average diameter of 15-20 nm and the Ni/Mo ratio of 3.2 shown in Figure S8."

      [4] "Moreover, the TEMEDS maps confirm the formation of 3:1 Ni/Mo-alloyed nanoparticles shown in Figure 5h,i."

[1] "HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP are presented in Figures 2A,B. The images of 0.8Pt2.4Zn-SPP shown in Figure 2A,B clearly demonstrate that the card-like morphology of the SPP zeolite was retained after introduction of Pt, as were ca. 2 nm-thick nanosheets comprising the zeolite."

         [2] "Figure 2E shows that these aggregates consist of single Pt atoms (marked with red circles) and what appear to be pairs of Pt atoms (marked with yellow circles)."

         [3] "The EXAFS data taken after H2-pretreated 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP had been used for PDH catalysis indicate an increase in the intensity of the feature assigned to PtZn backscattering (Figure 3b)."

No relevant quotes. The article does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts.

[1] "In this work, we investigated the effects of cluster size and Sn content on cluster stability and PDH on PtxSny (x, y ≤ 4) clusters supported on γ-Al2O3(110)."

      [2] "The stability of Pt clusters increases with increasing nuclearity. The addition of Sn also stabilizes Pt clusters due to the strong PtSn interaction."

      [3] "Although the dehydrogenation energy barriers increase with increasing Ptx cluster size, the reactivity is strongly dependent on the stability of surface species."

      [4] "For Ptx (x > 1), the reactivity decreases with increasing cluster size, correlating with the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."

      [5] "The introduction of Sn lowers the reactivity of Pt, as has been reported in previous work. Increasing the Sn content leads to even lower reactivity."

[1] "The use of this zinc containing ZSM-5 results in the strong interactions between Pt and the support, thus leads to a higher resistance towards reduction." 
          [2] "Moreover, relatively homogeneous distribution of metallic particles and the improved Pt dispersion are observed over the Zn-doped catalysts."
          [3] "In this way, the matching between the Pt active sites and the acid function on the Zn-ZSM5 supported catalyst can be improved, which is advantageous to the dehydrogenation of propane."

[1] "The isolated Pt1 is highly selective (99.6%) for propylene production and the catalyst is outstandingly stable for long-term operation at high temperature (96h, 600C)."  

         [2] "When the modifier for PtGa was changed from Pb to other metals such as In or Sn, no positive effects on activity and selectivity were obtained."

[1] "Combining the results of the Sn 3d XPS (Figure2C) and the temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR; FigureS5), it could be confirmed that Sn is mainly present in the +2 valence state in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst."

      [2] "STEM analysis (Figure4A,B) showed that the size and morphology of Pt-Sn clusters supported on the Al2O3 sheet had undergone negligible changes even after a 24h dehydrogenation reaction, which demonstrates the excellent sintering resistance of this catalyst."

"The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation."
           
           "We synthesized the catalyst by mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution to form a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex."
           
           "We used this solution to impregnate the SiO2 support and reduce the catalyst to obtain very small Pt-Sn NPs."
           
           "Data in Fig. 4, E and F, show the XANES spectra associated with the Pt LIII-edge and Sn K-edge, respectively, of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst and relevant controls. The Pt LIII-edge XANES spectra in Fig. 4E are consistent with the analysis of the EXAFS data, indicating that the mixing of Pt and Sn took place in the reduced Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst."
           
           "Figure 4B shows the XPS spectra associated with the Pt 4f7/2 electronic state, demonstrating that the Pt atoms were in the metallic Pt(0) state. Additionally, the Pt 4f7/2 peak shifted toward lower binding energy (70.5 eV) relative to a monometallic Pt reference (71.0 eV), in agreement with prior reports that the formation of PtSn caused a slight electron transfer from Sn to Pt that increased the local electron density on Pt and local Coulombic repulsion, thereby lowering the electron binding energy."

[1] The article shows that increasing the P content in Ru nanoparticles reduces the Ru ensemble size. This lowers the hydrogenolysis rate and improves propylene selectivity.
         [2] In RuP nanoparticles, each Ru atom is fully isolated by P atoms. This structure gives 91% propylene selectivity at 25% conversion, much higher than monometallic Ru.
