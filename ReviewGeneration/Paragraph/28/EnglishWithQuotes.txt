{"Quotes": "Commercial alumina ceramic tubes of asymmetric cross section were used as supports for the deposition of SiO2 layers by the solgel technique.

However, the following observations have been made: \n           • The yield in the membrane reactor is only higher than in the reference experiment if a membrane with a permselectivity H2: propane >25 and a propane flux <0.5 m3(STP)/mhbar is used.", "English": "Answer: Yes, the article evaluates membrane reactors for propane dehydrogenation using silica membranes.
