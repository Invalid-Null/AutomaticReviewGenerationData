[1] "Several schemes have been proposed for propene industrial production (e.g. oxidative dehydrogenation [2], [3], [4], metathesis [5]) but nowadays, catalytic dehydrogenation is the most feasible for propane upgrading on a commercial scale."
        
        [2] "A variety of technologies are available commercially for propane dehydrogenation [8], such as the Oleflex Process, developed by UOP, the Houdry Catofin Process (Air Products), the Phillips STAR Process (Phillips Petroleum), the Linde Process or the FBD-3 explained before."
       
        [3] "In this work, propane dehydrogenation over a Cr2O3 catalyst has been studied in a bench scale plant, using a two-zone fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR) configuration."
        
        [4] "the two-zone fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR), where propane and oxygen are fed at different levels, providing separated zones for the reaction and catalyst regeneration"
        
        [5] "the internal circulating fluidized bed reactor (ICFBR), where the addition of an axial dividing slab allows the partition of the vessel, giving two beds connected at the top and bottom and enabling better catalyst circulation."

Commercial alumina ceramic tubes of asymmetric cross section were used as supports for the deposition of SiO2 layers by the solgel technique. The SiO2 gel layer has been built up on the γ-alumina ultrafiltration (UF)-layer of the support by dip-coating with a SiO2-polymer sol.
       
           In this paper we report the preparation of H2-selective SiO2 membranes with improved fluxes and stability in the absence at 535C which is a typical temperature for the catalytic propane dehydrogenation.
       
           The propene yield in the membrane reactor can be higher than in a conventional fixed-bed reactor if the hydrogen is removed by a H2-selective membrane.

           As shown in Fig. 6, the propene yield can be increased if the hydrogen is continuously removed by a membrane. However, the following observations have been made: 
           • The yield in the membrane reactor is only higher than in the reference experiment if a membrane with a permselectivity H2: propane >25 and a propane flux <0.5 m3(STP)/mhbar is used.

[1] "The Two-Zone Fluidized Bed Reactor (TZFBR) is a system designed to counteract the catalyst deactivation." 

[2] "Fluid bed reactors have been employed combined with membranes in several works, but never in a situation where the bottom of the reactor was employed for catalyst regeneration"   

[3] "In this article we describe for the first time a combination of a TZFBR with a membrane reactor for the catalytic dehydrogenation of an alkane (propane) using a Pd hollow fibre membrane."  

[4] "The hydrogen selective membrane is a Pd membrane which is deposited directly on a porous alumina hollow fibre"  

[5] "The reactor was loaded with 15 g of a commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalyst"    

[6] "In this way two zones with different atmosphere are created in the bed: a reducing zone, in the upper part, where the desired reaction takes place and coke is formed on the catalyst surface and an oxidizing environment in the lower part, where the catalyst is regenerated by coke combustion."  

[7] "The experimental results are shown in Fig. 8. Propane conversion and selectivity to propene vs. percentage of oxygen in the feed are plotted for several operating conditions."   

[8] "The aim of this research was to explore the possibilities offered by this combination. The chosen reaction (propane dehydrogenation, C3H8 -> C3H6 + H2) has been previously studied in membrane reactors [12] and TZFBR [14]."   

[9] "The data named as low vacuum + membrane correspond to a vacuum around 300 mbar (30 kPa) inside the membrane, and those named high vacuum + membrane are experiments where the pressure at the mouth of the membrane was 7 mbar (0.7 kPa)."
