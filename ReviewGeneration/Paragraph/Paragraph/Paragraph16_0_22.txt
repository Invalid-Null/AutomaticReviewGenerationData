Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - How does alloying Pt with Sn, Ga, Zn affect propane dehydrogenation performance?

The addition of secondary metals such as Sn, Ga, and Zn as promoters is a proven strategy to enhance the performance of Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This approach can modulate the geometric and electronic properties of Pt active sites through ligand, ensemble, and bifunctional effects [Placeholder_of_DOI1].

Pt-Sn alloy catalysts are the most extensively studied system for PDH. Incorporating Sn helps decrease the size of Pt ensembles, alter the electron density of states, and provide spillover sites for coke precursors, thereby improving selectivity, suppressing deactivation from coking, and achieving close to equilibrium conversion levels [Placeholder_of_DOI2]. However, Sn addition beyond optimal ratios can lead to a decrease in activity by blocking active sites. Pt3Sn and PtSn intermetallic structures strike an ideal balance. The commercial Oleflex process uses Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts [Placeholder_of_DOI3].

Adding Ga as a promoter similarly helps disperse Pt sites and stabilize them against sintering and coking. The geometric and electronic modulation from incorporating Ga also suppresses side reactions. Pt-Ga intermetallic alloy catalysts can maintain 8-50% conversion for 30 days on-stream [Placeholder_of_DOI4]. 

Alloying Pt with Zn helps anchor isolated Pt atoms within zeolite frameworks, achieving PtZn4-6 single atom catalysts. This maximizes utilization and gives remarkable PDH performance - 30% conversion and 90% propylene selectivity for 60 hours [Placeholder_of_DOI5]. Zn modification also tunes the valence orbitals of Pt.

In summary, alloying Pt with promoters like Sn, Ga, and Zn has proven very effective for improving propane dehydrogenation in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability. This promotional effect arises from geometric and electronic modulation of Pt active sites. Tuning the composition and structure of the Pt alloy nanoparticles is crucial for optimizing performance.

Integrative Understanding and Prospective Outlook: The insights into Pt alloy catalysts highlight the remarkable potential of modulating vital catalyst descriptors through compositional and structural changes. Advancements in synthetic techniques [Placeholder_of_DOI6] can further this understanding by enabling precise control over bimetallic architectures. An expansive materials library spanning diverse secondary metals, varied geometries, and tunable compositions [Placeholder_of_DOI7] would illuminate optimal formulations. Furthermore, surface organometallic chemistry methods using molecular precursors offer atomically-defined sites to fundamentally probe the active phase in propane dehydrogenation [Placeholder_of_DOI8]. Elucidating these fundamental descriptors and extending such knowledge to designing catalysts in-silico can accelerate the development of highly optimized PDH catalysts [Placeholder_of_DOI9]. Ultimately, the vision is to use these fundamental principles to design catalysts surpassing commercial benchmarks.

双金属和合金催化剂—— Pt与Sn、Ga、Zn合金化如何影响丙烷脱氢性能?

加入Sn、Ga和Zn等辅助金属是增强Pt基催化剂丙烷脱氢(PDH)性能的经过验证的策略。这种方法可以通过配体、配体和双功能效应调制Pt活性位点的几何和电子性质[Placeholder_of_DOI1]。

Pt-Sn合金催化剂是PDH最广泛研究的体系。掺入Sn有助于减小Pt集团的大小,改变电子态的密度,并提供溢出位点以减缓焦炭的形成,从而改善选择性,抑制由焦炭引起的失活,并实现接近平衡的转化率[Placeholder_of_DOI2]。 然而,超过最佳比例的Sn添加可能会通过堵塞活性位点来降低活性。Pt3Sn和PtSn金属间化合物实现了理想的平衡。商业Oleflex工艺使用Pt-Sn双金属催化剂[Placeholder_of_DOI3]。

同样,加入Ga作为助剂有助于分散Pt位点并稳定它们抵抗烧结和焦炭形成。 从加入Ga中获得的几何和电子调制也抑制了副反应。 Pt-Ga金属间化合物催化剂可以在线30天内保持8-50%的转化率[Placeholder_of_DOI4]。

用Zn合金化Pt有助于将隔离的Pt原子锚定在分子筛框架内,实现PtZn4-6单原子催化剂。这最大限度地利用Pt并使PDH性能出色 - 60小时30%转化率和90%丙烯选择性[Placeholder_of_DOI5]。 Zn修饰也调谐Pt的价轨道。

总之,用Sn、Ga和Zn等促进剂合金化Pt已被证明对提高丙烷脱氢的活性、选择性和稳定性非常有效。这种促进作用源自Pt活性位点的几何和电子调制。调谐Pt合金纳米粒子的成分和结构对于优化性能至关重要。
