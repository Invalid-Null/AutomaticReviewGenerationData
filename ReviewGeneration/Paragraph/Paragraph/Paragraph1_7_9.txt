Propylene is an essential raw material for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, etc., with an estimated annual market size exceeding $100 billion [DOI1]. However, there exists a sizable and expanding supply-demand gap, as traditional production routes like naphtha cracking struggle to meet rapidly rising demand [DOI2]. In light of abundant and inexpensive propane supplies from shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as an promising technology for on-purpose propylene generation at commercial scales [DOI3]. PDH is an equilibrium-limited endothermic reaction requiring elevated temperatures around 500-600°C, but offers an economically competitive and eco-friendly pathway relative to conventional techniques [DOI4].  

Overall, propylene production via PDH holds tremendous value for the chemical industry in sustainably addressing skyrocketing propylene demands. Further research into enhancing catalyst design, stability, and selectivity could help overcome existing limitations and fully unlock the potential of this technology.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Capitalizing on recent advancements in PDH catalyst development and mechanistic insights, an opportunity exists to explore emerging options like single-atom catalysts, multifunctional composites, and machine learning for performance optimization. As shale gas resources expand globally, modular and compact PDH units located near production sites could mitigate logistical hurdles in the propylene supply chain. Process intensification techniques like membrane reactors also warrant greater attention. Broader adoption of PDH aligns with circular economy goals by transforming waste streams into valuable chemicals. Ultimately, crossing disciplinary boundaries and reimagining the PDH landscape could birth innovative solutions to bolster propylene yields far into the future.

丙烯是生产各种化学品(如丙烯、丙烯腈、丙烯醇、丙烯醚等)的重要原料,其年市场规模估计超过1000亿美元[DOI1]。然而,由于传统的裂解生产路线难以满足快速增长的需求,目前存在大量和日益扩大的供需缺口[DOI2]。鉴于页岩气提供了大量廉价的丙烷,丙烷脱氢(PDH)已成为商业规模上有目的丙烯生产的有前景的技术[DOI3]。PDH是一种平衡受限的放热反应,需要500-600°C的高温,但与传统技术相比,PDH提供了一个经济有竞争力和环保的途径[DOI4]。

总的来说,PDH途径生产丙烯对满足化学工业日益增长的丙烯需求具有巨大价值。进一步研究催化剂设计、稳定性和选择性方面的增强,有助于克服现有的局限性,充分释放这项技术的潜力。
