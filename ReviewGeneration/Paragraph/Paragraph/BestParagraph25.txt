Based on the details extracted from the file, several articles utilize in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts and gain insights into the nature of active sites and changes occurring during reaction.

One article uses in-situ DRIFTS and temperature programmed desorption with MS detection to probe propylene adsorption modes on cobalt catalysts, revealing how silicon modification impacts propylene interaction [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.021]. Another combines pulse titration experiments with quantitative in-situ FTIR to determine the identity and density of active gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts during propane dehydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.1c05724]. Synchrotron-based in-situ XAS at the Zn K-edge distinguishes binuclear ZnOx species on silicalite-1 from 3D ZnOx clusters formed in-situ on deAl beta during reaction [10.1021/acscatal.2c05704]. In-situ Raman spectroscopy and online MS enables identification of a VOx-C3H5 intermediate species and determination of rate-limiting H2 formation over VOx/HMS catalysts [10.1016/j.jcat.2022.07.017].

Other examples utilize combined in-situ UV-Vis/Raman spectroscopy with XANES and EXAFS to correlate changes in chromium oxidation states with propane dehydrogenation activity and deactivation over time [10.1021/cr5002436]. In-situ FTIR reveals transformation of inactive zinc hydroxide species into active zinc hydride sites during propane dehydrogenation induction periods over ZnO/SBA-15 [10.1021/acscatal.2c00928]. And a study combining GC measurements with in-situ XRD and DRIFTS elucidates changes in product distribution, phase transitions of vanadium oxides, and surface species during time-on-stream [10.1021/acscatal.8b04701].

The diversity of in-situ techniques provides detailed insights into working catalysts spanning from bulk to surface and even identifies specific active sites in some cases. Advancements in characterization capabilities now allow tracking catalyst structural dynamics from the molecular level up. While most studies have focused on simpler lab systems, adoption of these operando methods for online monitoring in industrial reactors could facilitate better process control and mechanistic-driven optimization.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the references, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on bridging multimodal in-situ characterizations with kinetic and computational modeling to achieve enhanced structure-activity-stability correlations. And while great progress has been made identifying active sites in model catalysts, new surface-sensitive techniques could help unravel the complex synergies between various sites in industrial formulations operating under real conditions over extended periods.

As single-atom and cluster catalysis gains more traction, adoption of cutting-edge electron microscopies and spectroscopies that push detection limits could uncover unprecedented details related to these unique structures. Expanding in-situ cells to better mimic reactor flows and stresses can also expose new deactivation mechanisms. And harnessing machine learning for data-driven spectral fitting and mechanism discrimination may extract deeper insights from the wealth of in-situ information. Ultimately the goal is to attain sufficient understanding to rationally design and optimize catalytic systems in an accelerated manner.
