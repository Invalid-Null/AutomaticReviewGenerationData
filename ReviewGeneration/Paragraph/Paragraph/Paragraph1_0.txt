Propylene is a crucial chemical feedstock utilized for producing a diverse range of products, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acetone, etc. \[10.1021/acscatal.0c05454\]. Traditional production routes via steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha and heavy oils are unable to satisfy the rapidly rising demands, which are projected to further intensify in the coming decade, with an expected 45% increase by 2030 \[10.1021/acscatal.1c01924\]. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has therefore emerged as an attractive and promising technology by leveraging abundant and cost-effective propane feedstocks from shale gas sources \[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.008\]. PDH currently accounts for 10% of global propylene output and is set to play an increasingly pivotal role as the supply-demand gap continues to widen \[10.1002/advs.202207756\].
※※※ 
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Propane dehydrogenation is slated to cement itself as a sustainable and scalable avenue for meeting global propylene demands in the years ahead. While impressive advancements have been achieved in catalyst design and reactor optimization thus far, opportunities remain to explore novel catalyst architectures, reaction mechanisms, and process intensification principles to further enhance selectivity, conversion, and stability. Broader adoption of renewable propane sources can also potentially steer PDH technologies toward green, circular routes for chemicals production. Data-driven and artificial intelligence methodologies may uncover additional avenues for innovation across the process development workflow.

丙烯是用于生产各种产品的关键化学原料,包括丙烯、丙烯腈、丙烯醇、丙酮等\[10.1021/acscatal.0c05454\]。来自石脑油和重油的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解的传统生产途径无法满足快速增长的需求,预计在未来十年进一步加剧,2030年预计增加45% \[10.1021/acscatal.1c01924\]。因此,利用丰富且经济实惠的页岩气丙烷原料的丙烷脱氢(PDH)已成为一种有吸引力和有前途的技术\[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.008\]。PDH目前占全球丙烯产量的10%,随着供需缺口不断扩大,PDH注定在未来发挥越来越重要的作用\[10.1002/advs.202207756\]。

综合理解与未来展望:在未来几年,丙烷脱氢注定会巩固其作为满足全球丙烯需求的可持续和可扩展途径的地位。尽管到目前为止在催化剂设计和反应器优化方面已经取得了令人印象深刻的进步,但探索新的催化剂体系、反应机理和工艺强化原理以进一步提高选择性、转化率和稳定性仍有机会。更广泛地采用可再生丙烷来源也可能有助��将PDH技术引向绿色循环化学品生产途径。基于数据和人工智能方法论可以发现工艺开发工作流程中的其他创新机会。
