Based on the details extracted from the references, several articles propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over different metal oxide catalysts. 

Over CrZrOx catalysts, two neighboring coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus) sites located at an oxygen vacancy are mainly responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of propane to propene [10.1021/acscatal.9b05063]. The Zrcus sites are formed upon reductive treatment of the catalyst. DFT calculations show the presence of Cr helps reduce the energy barrier for breaking the methyl C-H bond compared to bare ZrO2.

For Zn/MFI zeolites, the mechanism involves propane dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide species to form propyl species. Then propene evolves via dehydrogenation along with recombinative desorption of hydrogen [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.037]. Propene can further oligomerize or participate in other side reactions.  

Over alumina catalysts with oxygen vacancies, propane dehydrogenation can occur through concerted or stepwise pathways involving Alcu-O defect pairs that tune energies of key steps like CH activation and H2 formation [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.033].

Several articles describe Mars-van Krevelen type mechanisms where lattice oxygen participates in hydrogen abstraction from propane, leaving reduced metal sites that get reoxidized by gas phase O2. This mechanism has been proposed for supported VOx [10.1006/jcat.1999.2510, 10.1016/j.jcat.2004.01.023], MoVO mixed oxides [10.1021/jacs.9b09235], and for oxidative dehydrogenation pathways in general [10.1021/acscatal.2c01374].

Other proposed pathways include heterolytic dissociation over gallium oxides involving dissociative adsorption and decomposition steps [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.03.001, 10.1016/j.jcat.2006.02.017], redox cycles for Cr oxides [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999], and propane activation over isolated metal cation sites like Ga+ [10.1021/jacs.2c03941] and Zr cus [10.1002/anie.201508731].

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The current mechanistic understanding reveals some common themes but also distinct pathways over different metal oxide catalyst families. While lattice oxygen and redox properties are often involved, the specific nature and proximity of sites matters significantly. More atomic-level studies can reveal detailed conceptual models to guide design of tailored sites for selective propane activation. Operando methodology holds promise to track dynamic structural changes during reactions. Knowledge gained may stimulate explorations into novel multifunctional materials with tunable redox centres and acid-base pairs for efficient dehydrogenation.

Based on the details extracted from the references, several mechanistic scenarios have been proposed for propane dehydrogenation over different metal oxide catalysts. 

On CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, two neighboring coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus) sites located at an oxygen vacancy are suggested to be responsible for breaking C-H bonds in propane to form propene [10.1021/acscatal.9b05063]. Isolated Cr3+ species with vacant coordination sites are also proposed as active sites [10.1006/jcat.1994.1183]. 

On Zn/ZrO2 catalysts, isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ sites anchored on ZrO2 catalyze the initial dehydrogenation step, with neighboring Zrcus sites facilitating the second dehydrogenation step in a synergistic manner [10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c03074].

On VOx/metal oxide catalysts, a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is often proposed involving lattice oxygen in reversible redox cycles between higher and lower V oxidation states like V5+/V3+ [10.1016/j.jcat.2004.01.023, 10.1021/jacs.9b09235]. 

On Ga/zeolite catalysts, monovalent Ga+ sites activate propane via a Ga-(C3H7) intermediate, followed by hydride abstraction to give propene [10.1016/j.jcat.2006.03.004, 10.1021/jacs.2c03941]. A heterolytic dissociation path is preferred over redox routes.

Additionally, concerted dehydrogenation pathways [10.1021/acscatal.3c01002], alkyl mechanism via metal-alkyl intermediates [10.1021/acscatal.1c01497], and Mars-van Krevelen pathways utilizing lattice oxygen [10.1021/acscatal.2c05286] have also been proposed over other metal oxide catalysts.

In summary, isolated metal sites like Cr3+, Zn2+, Ga+, or V species in close proximity seem to be the key active sites on metal oxide catalysts for catalyzing individual steps in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The current mechanistic proposals provide important insights that can guide the design of improved propane dehydrogenation metal oxide catalysts. Key features like isolated redox-active sites, reversible lattice oxygen, concerted dehydrogenation pathways, and synergistic site pairs have emerged. Building on these concepts, future research could focus on elucidating full catalytic cycles spanning activation to regeneration steps and quantitative kinetics. Operando spectroscopic techniques combined with isotopic labeling and DFT calculations can offer detailed molecular-level information to unravel complex mechanisms. Atomic-level catalyst synthesis methods also allow precise control over site geometries and proximity to test theoretical proposals. Extending the mechanistic knowledge to other light alkane systems could uncover potentially generalizable concepts. Broader adoption of systems approaches integrating synthesis, characterization, and testing can accelerate these mechanistic explorations.

Based on the details extracted from the references, several mechanistic scenarios have been proposed for propane dehydrogenation over different metal oxide catalysts. 

On Cr/ZrOx catalysts, two neighboring coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus) sites located at an oxygen vacancy are concluded to be responsible for breaking C-H bonds in propane homolytically [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.012]. Isolated Cr3+ species with coordination unsaturation are also suggested as active sites [10.1006/jcat.1994.1183]. 

On Zn/ZrOx catalysts, isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ sites anchored on ZrO2 catalyze the first dehydrogenation step with neighboring Zrcus sites catalyzing the second step in a synergistic manner [10.1021/acscatal.0c01580, 10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c03074].
 
On Ga/zeolite catalysts, Ga+ cations activate propane via an alkyl mechanism, either on isolated Ga+ sites or Ga+ paired with Brønsted acid sites. Key steps involve formation of a Ga-propyl intermediate, hydride abstraction to form propylene, and hydrogen recombination [10.1021/acscatal.1c01497, 10.1016/j.jcat.2006.03.004].

On VOx catalysts, a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism is widely proposed, involving lattice oxygen mediating dehydrogenation to reduced V species followed by reoxidation [10.1006/jcat.1999.2510, 10.1016/j.jcat.2004.01.023, 10.1021/acscatal.8b04701]. Isolated and oligomeric V species are identified as active sites.

Alternative pathways are also described like concerted dehydrogenation on Ga/ZrOx [10.1021/acscatal.3c01002], heterolytic dissociation on Ga/zeolites [10.1016/j.jcat.2006.02.017]  and Ga oxides [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.03.001], and bifunctional synergy between Pt and Ga oxides [10.1021/acscatal.1c02553].

※※※ 
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The current mechanistic picture reveals that isolated transition metal cations (Cr, V, Ga) in partially reduced states, paired with oxide supports that can provide labile lattice oxygen, constitute prevalent active site motifs for propane dehydrogenation. However, atomic-level understanding of these sites and systematic trends across different metals remain lacking. Future research could focus on achieving tunable control over the oxidation state, coordination environment, and surrounding lattice of isolated sites, guided by computational modeling. Operando spectroscopy techniques combined with isotopic labeling and DFT calculations also have immense potential to elucidate reaction intermediates and pathways. An integrated approach spanning materials synthesis, characterization, and reaction studies is imperative to unlock superior propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

The reaction occurs via homolytic C-H bond breaking to form an isopropyl intermediate, followed by further dehydrogenation steps [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.012]. For CrZrOx mixed oxides, isolated Cr3+ species coordinate with Zr cations and help reduce the energy barrier for certain dehydrogenation steps based on DFT calculations [10.1021/acscatal.9b05063]. Over supported vanadium oxides like VOx/ZrO2, a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism has been suggested, where lattice oxygen activates the propane and reduced V centers get re-oxidized by O2 [10.1006/jcat.1999.2510]. Sub-monolayer and monolayer VOx structures on TiO2 can help suppress overoxidation side reactions [10.1002/anie.202005968]. For gallium oxides, a heterolytic dissociation pathway via Ga hydride and alkoxide intermediates is proposed [10.1016/j.jcat.2006.02.017]. Overall, the nature of active sites and mechanistic scenarios is found to be dependent on the specific metal oxide composition and structure.

※※※ 
The mechanistic understanding of propane dehydrogenation over different metal oxide catalysts has seen significant advances, with proposals of homolytic, heterolytic and redox pathways over isolated cationic sites, oxygen vacancies and metal-oxide interfaces. Key challenges still remain in further clarifying the identity and geometric parameters of active sites using advanced characterization, and extending computational studies to larger surface models. By gaining fundamental insights into factors influencing activity and selectivity, rational design principles can be formulated to discover improved metal oxide compositions and nanostructures. An emerging area is coupling CO2 with propane dehydrogenation to tune selectivity and mitigate coking issues. New opportunities also lie in exploring interactions between metal oxide catalysts and unconventional plasmonic photocatalysts under light irradiation. Such endeavors can pave the way for better optimized and more active metal oxide catalysts for on-purpose propylene production.

Isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ sites anchored on ZrO2 are suggested to be active for propane dehydrogenation over ZnZrxOy catalysts, possibly with synergistic effects between Zn2+, ZrO2 and TiO2 [10.1021/acscatal.0c01580]. Computational studies propose Zn2+ sites catalyze the first dehydrogenation step and neighboring Zrcus sites catalyze the second step [10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c03074].

Over VOx/ZrO2, isolated V5+ sites are proposed to catalyze propane dehydrogenation via a Mars-van Krevelen type mechanism, with lattice oxygen participating in alkane activation steps [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.02.028]. V5+ sites reduce to V4+ and V3+ during reaction and reoxidize using O2.

γ-Al2O3 supported VOx catalysts are described to go through an initial ODH dominant period with VO as active site, followed by a PDH period with AlOV and unsaturated V sites active after VO is removed [10.1021/acscatal.8b04701].

Various other mechanistic proposals are described over Ga, Cr, Mn, Mo oxides involving heterolytic dissociation routes, redox cycles with specific active oxidation states, and CO2-assisted pathways [10.1016/j.jcat.2006.03.004, 10.1021/acscatal.0c03999, 10.1021/jacs.9b09235, 10.1021/acscatal.2c02099].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The studies analyzed showcase propane dehydrogenation proceeds through diverse mechanistic routes over assorted metal oxide catalyst families. Key aspects determining reactivity and selectivity include creation of coordinatively unsaturated sites, synergism between different metal species, participation of lattice oxygen, and targeted tuning of oxidation states. 

An expansive research opportunity exists in systematically tuning these critical attributes over mixed and multicomponent oxide systems using advanced synthetic techniques. Innovative in-situ/operando methodologies can offer finer details into transient intermediates and dynamic active site transformations during catalytic turnovers. Computational screening approaches may also predict hitherto unknown compositions and crystal motifs that demonstrate superior intrinsic activity or selectivity control. Such endeavors can usher the rational design of next-generation catalysts tailored for targeted conversion of propane and other alkanes.

Based on the details extracted from the literature, here is a comprehensive review section on the proposed mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over different metal oxide catalysts:

Several articles describe Mars-van Krevelen type mechanisms operating during propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts like VOx/ZrO2 [10.1006/jcat.1999.2510], CrOx/ZrO2 [10.1016/j.jcat.2004.01.023], and MoVO mixed oxides [10.1021/jacs.9b09235]. In this pathway, lattice oxygen initiates the reaction by abstracting hydrogen from propane. The resulting alkyl species then lead to propene, while the reduced metal oxide surface gets re-oxidized by O2 or CO2 to complete the catalytic cycle. 

Isolated metal cations with unsaturated coordination (designated Mcus) are identified as active sites on several catalysts. On CrOx/ZrO2, Zrcus sites adjacent to oxygen vacancies catalyze C-H bond cleavage [10.1021/acscatal.9b05063]. Isolated Zn2+ on ZrO2 [10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c03074] and Ga+/H+ pairs on Ga/H-ZSM-5 [10.1021/acscatal.1c01497] also demonstrate high activity. The proximity of these Mcus sites to acid/base sites contributes to subsequent reaction steps like hydride transfer.

Several articles highlight the role of redox cycles Mx+ ↔ M(x-1)+ (x = 3-6) in activating propane on Cr [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999] and V [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.02.028] oxides. Optimal valency states like Cr3+ or V3+ balance activity and resistance to over-reduction. Tetrahedral Ga3+ sites are noted to selectively activate C-H bonds on Ga2O3 via heterolytic dissociation without changing oxidation state [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.03.001].

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The current mechanistic picture remains fractional, with catalyst-specific pathways proposed based on limited spectroscopic and computational data. A unified framework accounting for common intermediates and descriptors is lacking. An opportunity exists to integrate advanced operando probes with kinetic isotope tracing to track full catalytic sequences from propane to propylene. Data-driven computational approaches could then map out detailed free energy diagrams. The synergistic coupling of multiple techniques will clarify universal mechanistic features governing selectivity over diverse metal oxide catalysts. Future research might focus on tailored mixed metal oxides to optimally tune oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties for propane dehydrogenation.

Based on the detailed analysis from the references, some mechanistic scenarios have been proposed for propane dehydrogenation over specific metal oxide catalysts. 

On CrZrOx catalysts, two neighboring coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus) sites located at oxygen vacancies are proposed as the active sites responsible for breaking C-H bonds in propane homolytically to produce propene [10.1021/acscatal.9b05063]. Isolated Cr3+ species in Cr2O3 catalysts with coordination unsaturation are also suggested to catalyze dehydrogenation [10.1006/jcat.1994.1183]. 

Mars-van Krevelen type redox mechanisms involving participation of lattice oxygen are described over VOx [10.1006/jcat.1999.2510, 10.1016/j.jcat.2004.01.023], MoVO [10.1021/jacs.9b09235], and other highly valent metal oxide catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.2c01374]. Subsequent reduction of the metal oxide and reoxidation by gaseous O2 or CO2 complete the catalytic cycle.

Heterolytic dissociative pathways preferentially breaking C-H over C-C bonds are proposed on gallium oxide surfaces, with rate-limiting dissociative propane adsorption [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.03.001, 10.1016/j.jcat.2006.02.017]. Alkyl and carbenium ion intermediates are described over Ga/zeolite catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.1c01497].

The specific nature of proposed active sites and mechanistic steps vary based on the metal oxide composition and structure. However, common themes of unsaturation, redox capability, and ability to break C-H bonds emerge as essential attributes.

※※※

An integrative perspective reveals that while substantial advances have been made in unraveling mechanistic scenarios over selected metal oxide catalysts, several gaps and opportunities remain. Many complex multifunctional mixed metal oxides lack mechanistic understanding. Extending computational studies in tandem with sophisticated spectroscopic probes of working catalysts can further bridge knowledge gaps. An integrated approach tuning composition, coordination, oxidation state, and metal-support interfacial sites provides an exciting playground for developing innovative catalysts and mechanistic hypotheses. By covering diverse chemical spaces and tolerance regimes, next generation catalysts can aspire beyond incremental gains towards disruptive process improvements.

Based on the details extracted from the literature, two neighboring coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) located at an oxygen vacancy are proposed as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over ZrO2 catalysts [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.012]. These sites break the C-H bonds in propane homolytically to form an isopropyl intermediate, followed by further dehydrogenation to propene. For CrZrOx mixed oxide catalysts, the presence of Cr helps reduce the energy barrier for methyl C-H bond activation compared to pure ZrO2, facilitating propene formation [10.1021/acscatal.9b05063]. 

Mars-van Krevelen type redox mechanisms are suggested for propane oxidative dehydrogenation over VOx [10.1006/jcat.1999.2510, 10.1016/j.jcat.2004.01.023] and MoVO [10.1021/jacs.9b09235] catalysts, involving lattice oxygen participation. As lattice oxygen is depleted, V3+ sites catalyze subsequent non-oxidative pathways in these catalysts [10.1021/jacs.9b09235]. For Ga2O3 catalysts, a heterolytic dissociation mechanism is proposed, with propane dissociatively adsorbing to form gallium hydride and alkoxide intermediates [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.03.001, 10.1016/j.jcat.2006.02.017].

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The current literature provides important mechanistic insights into propane dehydrogenation over various metal oxide catalysts. Key themes include the significance of coordinatively unsaturated sites at oxygen vacancies in ZrO2, the role of Cr in promoting activity in mixed oxides like CrZrOx, and the involvement of Mars-van Krevelen vs heterolytic dissociation pathways over redox-active (VOx, MoVO) versus non-redox (Ga2O3) metal oxides respectively. 

However, many aspects remain unclear regarding the full reaction networks and how to optimize selectivity. Future research could explore operando spectroscopy techniques paired with isotopic labeling to track reaction intermediates over different sites. Data science approaches may uncover improved descriptors and provide atomic-level understanding connecting structure with selectivity trends. Utilizing these advancing tools to obtain a more wholistic mechanistic picture could unlock new catalyst design principles targeting optimized productivity and propene selectivity.

Based on the details extracted from the references, several mechanistic scenarios have been proposed for propane dehydrogenation over various metal oxide catalysts. 

On chromium oxide catalysts, active Cr3+ sites are generated in situ from Cr6+ precursors during reaction. Isolated Cr3+ sites with coordination unsaturation are proposed as most active in Cr/SBA-15, while oligomeric Cr species are more active in Cr/Al2O3 [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014]. Mononuclear Cr3+ sites with two ligand vacancies have also been suggested as active sites [10.1006/jcat.1994.1183].

On gallium oxide catalysts, propane dehydrogenation is proposed to occur via a heterolytic dissociation pathway over tetrahedral Ga3+ sites, rather than a redox mechanism [10.1016/j.jcat.2006.02.017, 10.1016/j.jcat.2005.03.001]. Key steps involve dissociative adsorption to gallium hydride and alkoxide species. Isolated Ga+ sites in zeolites also activate propane via an oxidative addition, H-β elimination pathway [10.1021/jacs.2c03941].

On vanadia catalysts, a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is widely proposed, involving lattice oxygen abstraction of H from propane, followed by catalyst reoxidation. Isolated V5+ sites reduce to V3+ during this cycle [10.1006/jcat.1999.2510]. Sub-monolayer VOx structures help avoid overoxidation compared to bulk V2O5 [10.1002/anie.202005968]. 

On zirconia catalysts, coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ sites neighboring oxygen vacancies activate propane's C-H bonds. Subsequent β-H elimination forms propene after a Zr-propyl intermediate [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.012]. Introducing Ga changes the mechanism from stepwise to concerted [10.1021/acscatal.3c01002].

Additionally, H-assisted formate/carboxyl pathways are described for indirect catalysts with rWGS activity [10.1021/acscatal.2c01374].

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The information amassed reveals crucial structural motifs conferring activity for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxides - isolated cationic sites neighboring oxygen vacancies demonstrate particular competence. While considerable strides have illuminated predominant pathways and intermediates, atomic-level understanding of selectivity control warrants further exploration. Emerging operando spectroscopies probing transient moieties in tandem with computational modeling can offer novel insights. Beyond conventional metal oxides, burgeoning two-dimensional derivatives manifesting high concentrations of coordinatively unsaturated sites merit investigation.
