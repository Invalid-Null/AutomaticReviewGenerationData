Propylene is an essential raw material for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acetone, etc., with an estimated annual market size exceeding $100 billion [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]. However, there is a growing gap between propylene supply and demand, as traditional production routes like steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking struggle to keep pace with rising consumption [Placeholder_Of_DOI1]. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as an attractive alternative that leverages abundant supplies of propane from shale gas. PDH provides a promising route for on-purpose propylene generation from an inexpensive feedstock, although the endothermic equilibrium-limited nature of the reaction presents technical challenges [Placeholder_Of_DOI3].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the increasing propylene demand coupled with propane abundance, PDH technologies hold much promise. Advancements in catalyst design, reactor engineering, and process intensification can help overcome limitations. An industrially viable PDH process would alleviate propylene shortages while consuming clean shale gas. Optimized PDH routes may eventually account for a dominant share of propylene production as the industry transitions from crude oil to natural gas feedstocks.

丙烯是生产各种化学品(如丙烯、丙烯腈、丙烯醇、丙酮等)的重要原料,其年市场规模估计超过1000亿美元 [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]。然而,丙烯的供应和需求之间存在着日益扩大的差距,因为常规的生产途径(如裂解和催化裂解)跟不上日益增长的消费需求 [Placeholder_Of_DOI1]。丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为利用页岩气中丰富的丙烷的有吸引力的替代途径而兴起。尽管反应的内吸热平衡限制性质提出了技术挑战,PDH提供了一条从廉价原料产生聚丙烯的有前途的途径 [Placeholder_Of_DOI3]。

综合理解与未来展望:考虑到丙烯需求的增加和丙烷的丰富性,PDH技术具有很大的前景。催化剂设计、反应器工程和过程强化的进步有助于克服局限性。一个工业上可行的PDH过程将缓解丙烯的短缺,同时消耗清洁的页岩气。优化的PDH途径最终可能占据丙烯生产的主导地位,因为该行业正在从原油向天然气原料过渡。
