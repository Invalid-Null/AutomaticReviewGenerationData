Propylene is an essential raw material for producing a wide range of chemicals and polymers, with significant applications in plastics, packaging, construction, and more. However, traditional production routes like naphtha cracking are struggling to meet rapidly rising global demand, projected to reach 191 megatons per year by 2030 [Placeholder_of_DOI3]. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a promising technology, already accounting for 10% of propylene output [Placeholder_of_DOI3], by utilizing abundant and low-cost propane feedstocks from shale gas. Multiple studies have highlighted the technical and economic potential of PDH, with one stating it is the “basis of large-scale propene production” [Placeholder_of_DOI11] and another noting its industrial competitiveness [Placeholder_of_DOI7]. Realizing PDH’s full capability though requires addressing considerable challenges, as it is an endothermic equilibrium-limited reaction demanding elevated temperatures around 500-600°C [Placeholder_of_DOI21].

Recent advances in catalyst design, reactor engineering, and process intensification, as covered in the references, point towards exciting pathways for enhancing PDH efficiency and economics. Key opportunities highlighted include developing novel catalysts to lower operating temperatures, integrating membrane separations for in situ propylene removal, and utilizing advanced reactor configurations like microchannel systems. By building on these innovations and tackling remaining bottlenecks around activity and stability, PDH could grow into a pillar of sustainable propylene production. Broader integration with emerging technologies like solar thermochemical processes or electrocatalysis may also open up revolutionary production paradigms in the future.
