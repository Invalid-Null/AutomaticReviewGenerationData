Metal oxides such as chromium oxide (Cr2O3), tin oxide (SnO2), and gallium oxide (Ga2O3) have been explored as promising catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction. Among them, Cr2O3-based catalysts are recognized to exhibit relatively high activity, evidenced by their use in commercial propane dehydrogenation processes like CATOFIN [10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b07224, 10.1016/j.jcat.2005.03.001]. Specifically, studies have noted that CrOx is an integral component of industrial Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts employed in the CATOFIN process for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene [10.1021/acscatal.1c01814]. Investigations using spectroscopic analysis and kinetic modeling have revealed that reduced Cr2O3 surfaces containing oxygen vacancies are the active sites responsible for activating the C-H bonds of propane [10.1021/acscatal.1c01814]. Doping Cr2O3 with promoters like Pt has also been found to further enhance catalytic performance [10.1021/acscatal.1c01814]. Though Cr2O3 catalysts are quite active, their propylene selectivity and stability need improvement. 

Gallium oxide, especially in its β-polymorph, has also been probed as a potential candidate for propane dehydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.0c05009]. The Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibit pronounced Lewis acidity, which correlates with their ability to cleave the C-H bond in propane during the initial dehydrogenation step [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.03.001]. Among the Ga2O3 polymorphs tested, β-Ga2O3/SiO2 delivered the highest propylene yield when CO2 was co-fed along with propane, surpassing the performance of Cr2O3 and commercial catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.1c02621]. The synergistic effect of gallium's Lewis acidity and CO2's ability to hinder propylene overoxidation accounted for β-Ga2O3/SiO2's promising productivity. However, more research needs to be conducted to further improve the stability and selectivity of Ga2O3-based catalysts.

Bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts have also received great interest, and are recognized to demonstrate superior propylene selectivity and stability compared to the conventional mono-metallic Pt catalysts used in industry [10.1021/cs-opportunities, 10.1002/anie.202207756]. Detailed spectroscopic studies have revealed that incorporating Sn facilitates the formation of intermetallic Pt-Sn sites in the catalyst, which are the active phase responsible for the enhanced catalytic attributes [10.1021/acscatal.1c00639]. The geometric and electronic effects induced by alloying Pt with Sn weaken the adsorption of propylene and suppress hydrogenolysis/coking side-reactions, enabling excellent propane conversion while maintaining high propylene selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00639]. However, the overall activity of Pt-Sn catalysts remains lower than Cr2O3, necessitating further improvements.

While metal oxides like Cr2O3 and Ga2O3 as well as PtSn bimetallics have shown promise as propane dehydrogenation catalysts, there remain opportunities to enhance their activity, selectivity and stability through optimization of parameters like active phase, promoters, and support interactions. Developing a fundamental mechanistic understanding of how catalyst composition and structure impact selectivity will be key to designing optimized PDH catalysts. Operando spectroscopic techniques that can probe metal-support interfacial sites under working conditions can deliver pivotal insights to guide design. Multifunctional catalysts that combine the high activity of oxides with selectivity-enhancing metal sites could be one avenue worth exploring. Machine learning methods integrating computations and experiments might accelerate optimization of PDH catalysts with specific compositions tailored for commercial reactors. Overall, gaining a deeper atomic-level comprehension of the catalyst features that regulate product selectivity seems imperative for rationally engineering more robust PDH catalysts for widespread commercial implementation.

金属氧化物,例如铬氧化物(Cr2O3)、锡氧化物(SnO2)和镓氧化物(Ga2O3),已被探索为丙烷脱氢反应的有前途的催化剂。其中,以Cr2O3为基础的催化剂被认为表现出相对较高的活性,这可以从它们被用于商业丙烷脱氢工艺(如CATOFIN)中可以看出[10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b07224, 10.1016/j.jcat.2005.03.001]。具体而言,研究表明CrOx是CATOFIN工艺中用于直接丙烷脱氢制丙烯的工业Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂的关键组分[10.1021/acscatal.1c01814]。利用光谱分析和动力学建模的研究揭示了还原的Cr2O3表面含有氧空位是激活丙烷C-H键的活性位点[10.1021/acscatal.1c01814]。用Pt等助剂掺杂Cr2O3也被发现可以进一步增强催化性能[10.1021/acscatal.1c01814]。尽管Cr2O3催化剂活性较高,但其丙烯选择性和稳定性仍需改进。

氧化镓,特别是β多晶型,也被探索为丙烷脱氢反应的潜在催化剂[10.1021/acscatal.0c05009]。氧化镓的多晶型表现出明显的路易斯酸性,这与它们在丙烷脱氢初期裂解C-H键的能力相关[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.03.001]。在测试的氧化镓多晶型中,当与CO2共同进料时,β-Ga2O3/SiO2呈现最高的丙烯收率,超过了Cr2O3和商业催化剂的性能[10.1021/acscatal.1c02621]。镓的路易斯酸性和CO2抑制丙烯过氧化的协同效应解释了β-Ga2O3/SiO2的有前途的生产率。然而,需要进一步研究以进一步提高氧化镓基催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

双金属Pt-Sn催化剂也受到了极大的关注,并且与传统的工业中使用的单金属Pt催化剂相比,其丙烯选择性和稳定性更高[10.1021/cs-opportunities, 10.1002/anie.202207756]。详细的光谱研究显示掺入Sn有助于在催化剂中形成Pt-Sn金属间化合物,这是增强催化性能的活性相[10.1021/acscatal.1c00639]。  Pt与Sn合金化诱导的几何和电子效应削弱了丙烯的吸附,抑制了加氢裂解/焦炭副反应,在保持高丙烯选择性的同时实现了优异的丙烷转化[10.1021/acscatal.1c00639]。然而,Pt-Sn催化剂的整体活性仍低于Cr2O3,需要进一步改进。

虽然像Cr2O3和Ga2O3这样的金属氧化物以及PtSn双金属都表现出作为丙烷脱氢催化剂的前景,但仍有机会通过优化诸如活性相、助剂和载体相互作用等参数来增强它们的活性、选择性和稳定性。开发基础的机理理解催化剂组成和结构如何影响选择性对设计优化的PDH催化剂至关重要。能够在工作条件下探测金属载体界面位点的原位光谱技术可以提供关键的启示来指导设计。结合氧化物的高活性与增强选择性的金属位点的多功能催化剂可能是一个值得探索的途径。融合计算和实验的机器学习方法可能会加速优化具有针对商业反应器定制组成的PDH催化剂的优化。总体而言,对调节产物选择性的催化剂特征获得更深入的原子水平理解似乎对于理性设计更稳健的PDH催化剂以实现广泛的商业应用至关重要。
