Based on the details provided in the file, several studies have evaluated supported mono-metallic Pt, Pd, and Ir catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). 

Pt-based catalysts are reported to be among the most widely used and commercially successful PDH catalysts. For example, Pt/Al2O3 is a vital PDH catalyst component due to Pt's ability to activate paraffinic C-H bonds while minimizing C-C cleavage [10.1002/anie.201507119]. One study showed an alumina-supported Pt catalyst maintained high initial activity, although it deactivated over multiple cycles due to Pt agglomeration accelerated by sulfur [10.1016/0021-9517(86)90312-X]. Adding promoters such as 1 wt% boron to Pt/γ-Al2O3 was found to reduce coking by 3 times and increase propylene selectivity from 90% to 98% [10.1021/acscatal.9b05548]. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 or TiO2 overcoats on Pt/Al2O3 extrudates also improved PDH yield and selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.0c03391].

Besides Pt/Al2O3, other supports have been studied. Pt/SBA-15 catalysts demonstrated activity for both hydrogenation and PDH reactions [10.1016/j.apcatb.2012.11.005]. Confining sub-nanometric Pt clusters in Ge-UTL zeolites via Pt-O-Ge bonds gave a catalyst with excellent stability and 96% propylene selectivity [10.1038/s41929-023-00968-7]. A Pt/Zn-zeolite catalyst maintained 40% initial conversion over 10 hours, showing high activity and low deactivation [10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008].

Some studies have also explored Pd and Ir. A supported RhCu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst showed higher activity, 100% propene selectivity and coking resistance compared to a standard Pt/Al2O3 catalyst [10.1126/science.abg8389]. However, many articles focused solely on non-noble metal catalysts.

Overall, Pt-based catalysts are identified as the most promising supported metal catalysts for commercial PDH processes, with tuning of supports, promoters, and overcoats as strategies to further enhance stability and selectivity.

※※※

Integrative Understanding & Prospective Outlook:
The examined studies provide significant insights into supported metal catalysts for PDH. Pt-based materials are clearly established as the foremost commercial catalysts. However, stability and selectivity remain challenges. The dependency on critical noble metals also motivates exploration of non-precious alternatives. 

Advancements in characterization techniques enabling atomic-level views of working catalysts could unravel degradation mechanisms. This knowledge can guide engineering of more robust catalysts and supports. Operando spectroscopy under industrially-relevant conditions may reveal additional promoters or overcoats to curtail coking. 

Machine learning models applied to PDH could accelerate screening and optimization. High-throughput DFT calculations have shown promise for predicting single atom alloy catalysts. Similar data-driven approaches may uncover reduced or non-precious compositions with favorable kinetics. Ultimately, progress lies at the intersection of computational experiments and insights from operating catalysts.

Based on the information extracted from the file, several studies have evaluated supported mono-metallic Pt, Pd, and Ir catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). 

Specifically, alumina-supported Pt catalysts have been extensively explored, with one study showing 1 wt% boron addition can decrease coke formation 3-fold and increase propylene selectivity from 90% to 98% over 12 hours [10.1021/acscatal.9b05548]. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of metal oxide overcoats on Pt/Al2O3 has also been found to increase PDH yield and selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.0c03391]. Detailed characterizations reveal small Pt clusters around 1.3 nm dispersed on Al2O3 nanosheets [10.1002/anie.201507119]. Adding Sn and forming Pt-Sn alloy phases enhances conversion and selectivity compared to monometallic Pt, attributed to geometric and electronic effects [10.1021/acscatal.1c00639, 10.1126/science.abg7894].

Besides Pt, supported Pd, Rh, and Ir are mentioned to have high intrinsic activity, but their higher cost has limited industrial use [10.1021/acscatal.3c01002]. A supported RhCu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst was shown to outperform Pt/Al2O3 for PDH, with doubled propylene selectivity (100% vs 80%), lower light-off temperature, and coking resistance [10.1126/science.abg8389].

Overall, while Pt dominates commercial PDH catalysts, new compositions and nanostructures for other noble metals may provide opportunities to enhance catalytic performance.

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The findings underscore Pt's efficacy for PDH arising from optimized CH activation and CC cleavage selectivity. However, stability issues due to coking and sintering necessitate modified compositions (Pt-Sn) or promoters (B) to prolong lifetime. Beyond platinum, tailoring other noble metals at the atomic level, like single atom alloy RhCu, opens alternative design pathways to potentially supersede Pt. Fundamental studies probing metal-support interfacial effects, site requirements, and deactivation mechanisms will inform knowledge-based advances. Operando spectroscopies mapping surface evolution may illuminate optimization routes. Adaptive machine learning models classifying structure-activity descriptors could accelerate screening and discovery too. Commercial drivers around propane supply and propylene demand could further spur innovation across reaction and catalyst engineering.

Based on the details extracted from the file, several articles evaluate supported mono-metallic Pt, Pd, or Ir catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and provide relevant data and insights. 

Specifically, a Pt/alumina catalyst was found to show improved propylene selectivity from 90% to 98% when promoted with 1 wt% boron, due to reduced coke formation over 12 hours [10.1021/acscatal.9b05548]. Sub-nanometric Pt clusters confined in Ge-UTL zeolite pores via Pt-O-Ge bonds (Pt4-Ge2-d4r@UTL) displayed high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability for propane dehydrogenation [10.1038/s41929-023-00968-7]. Adding 0.6-1.5 wt% Ca to a PtSnIn/CaAl catalyst led to excellent stability for over 25 hours, maintaining >58% propane conversion [10.1016/j.cej.2014.07.044]. HAADF-STEM images of a 0.4Pt2.4Zn-SPP catalyst showed isolated Pt atoms and potentially small clusters that delivered high activity and selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.2c01631]. A Pt/BN catalyst was found to have higher stability than Pt/Al2O3, attributed to metal-support interactions [10.1016/j.jechem.2021.10.008]. 

Comparisons of Pt with other metals were also reported. A RhCu single atom alloy catalyst supported on silica exhibited higher activity, 100% propene selectivity, and coking resistance compared to a standard Pt/Al2O3 catalyst [10.1126/science.abg8389]. At the same conditions, a NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst showed twice the selectivity of Pt/Al2O3 [10.1021/acscatal.0c05711].

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The findings showcase promising advancements with supported Pt group metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in terms of activity, selectivity and stability. Strategies like adding promoters, optimizing metal-support interactions, and isolating single sites prevent agglomeration and coking issues. Expanding these concepts to cheaper non-precious metals and continuing structure-performance studies could unlock more active, selective and stable catalysts. Operando spectroscopy and theoretical modeling will lend mechanistic insights to guide rational design. Overall there is significant potential to develop enhanced solid catalysts to meet industry needs.

Several of the articles provided evaluate supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). One study shows adding 1 wt% boron promoter to Pt/γ-Al2O3 reduces coke formation threefold and boosts propylene selectivity from 90% to 98% over 12 hours [10.1021/acscatal.9b05548]. Another investigates the effect of atomic layer deposition (ALD) Al2O3 and TiO2 overcoats on supported Pt catalysts, finding increased PDH yield and selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.0c03391]. 

Data is also presented on other metals like Ru, Rh, and Co for PDH. Supported monometallic Ru nanoparticles are found to give only 4.5% propylene selectivity at 25% conversion, much lower than Pt (46%) [10.1021/acscatal.0c01667]. A single atom alloy RhCu/SiO2 catalyst shows higher activity, 100% selectivity, and coking resistance compared to a Pt/Al2O3 standard [10.1126/science.abg8389]. Isolated Co2+ cations in dealuminated BEA zeolites are identified as the primary active sites [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726].

Overall, Pt-based catalysts seem most promising for commercial PDH processes. The articles emphasize stabilizing isolated Pt sites and tuning metal-support interactions to optimize stability and minimize deactivation. However, emerging catalysts like SAAs may offer opportunities to surpass Pt. Further research is still needed to develop optimal PDH catalysts.

※※※ 
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The findings reveal Pt is the predominant mono-metallic catalyst studied for commercial PDH applications thus far. However, challenges remain regarding stability and selectivity. This presents opportunities to explore burgeoning concepts like single atom alloys and isolated metal sites with enhanced interfaces. Adopting advanced characterization techniques can also better elucidate catalyst structure-activity relationships to guide optimization. Bringing such innovative approaches to the fore may unlock superior PDH catalysts beyond conventional Pt benchmarks.

Supported mono-metallic platinum catalysts have been widely explored for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to Pt's superior ability to activate C-H bonds while minimizing undesirable C-C bond cleavage [[10.1006/jcat.1994.1333]], [[10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7]]. Data shows sulfur addition, either during catalyst preparation or gas phase pre-treatment, can enhance Pt/alumina selectivity, with predosing at 873 K improving initial propene formation [[10.1006/jcat.1994.1333]]. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) metal oxide overcoats on Pt/alumina extrudates increased yield and selectivity, attributed to tailored metal-support sites [[10.1021/acscatal.0c03391]]. 

        Confinement of sub-nanometric Pt clusters within Ge-UTL zeolites via Pt-O-Ge linkages yielded the Pt4-Ge2-d4r@UTL catalyst exhibiting excellent stability for over 60 hours [[10.1038/s41929-023-00968-7]]. Pt nanoclusters supported on spinel MgAl2O4 maintained high initial activity but were prone to deactivation from Pt agglomeration accelerated by sulfur [[10.1016/0021-9517(86)90312-X]].

        Pt cluster nuclearity effects were studied computationally, finding a volcano-type dependence maximized at Pt2; reactivity decreased with increasing size correlating to higher C-H activation barriers [[10.1021/acscatal.2c05671]]. Comparison between supported Pt catalysts and other metals is limited, but data shows Ru nanoparticles had very low 4.5% propylene selectivity compared to 46% for Pt [[10.1021/acscatal.0c01667]].
※※※
		The explored studies provide valuable insights into supported mono-metallic Pt catalyst design for propane dehydrogenation. Key factors influencing stability and selectivity have been identified, including metal-support interactions, sulfur effects, confinement within microporous structures, cluster size effects and promoters. However further work should systematically benchmark Pt against other supported metals like Pd across different supports and conditions. More in-depth spectroscopic characterization of metal-support interfaces could elucidate stabilization mechanisms. Machine learning could assist high-throughput catalyst screening and optimization. Overall expanding the knowledge base around Pt and alternative metals can spur development of more robust PDH catalysts.

Based on the details extracted from the file, several studies have evaluated supported mono-metallic Pt, Pd, or Ir catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). 

A study by Burch and Watling [10.1006/jcat.1994.1333] investigated the effects of adding sulfur during preparation or to the feed on Pt/alumina catalysts for PDH. Key findings were that predosing with H2S at 873 K greatly improved selectivity to propene, and sulfur incorporation during preparation was more effective than during reaction.

Other works evaluated Pt supported on boron nitride (Pt/BN) [10.1016/j.jechem.2021.10.008], SBA-15 (Pt/SBA-15) [10.1016/j.apcatb.2012.11.005], Al2O3 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03391, 10.1021/acscatal.9b05548], and zeolites like Ge-UTL (Pt/Ge-UTL) [10.1038/s41929-023-00968-7] and Zn-ZSM-5 (Pt/Zn-ZSM-5) [10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008]. Effects of promoters like Ca [10.1016/j.cej.2014.07.044], Sn [10.1021/acscatal.2c01631, 10.1021/acscatal.1c00639], and Pb [10.1038/s41467-020-16693-9] on Pt catalysts were also studied. These works provided insights into metal-support interactions, alloying effects, and strategies to enhance Pt stability and selectivity.

A few studies also looked at supported Pd [10.1021/acscatal.3c01002], Rh [10.1126/science.abg8389], Ru [10.1016/0021-9517(86)90312-X, 10.1021/acscatal.0c01667], and Ir [10.1021/acscatal.3c01002], but data was more limited compared to Pt catalysts.

Overall, Pt-based catalysts remain the most widely studied mono-metallic systems for PDH, and detailed mechanistic insights have been gained on supported Pt catalysts through advanced characterization techniques. However, expanding research to other noble metals and modifiers could uncover further opportunities to enhance catalytic performance.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive analysis of supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation provides a robust baseline understanding centered chiefly on Pt-based materials. Nonetheless, broader avenues may be charted to diversify the portfolio of investigated metals, supports, and characterization methods:

1) Evaluate second-row transition metals like Ru, Rh, Pd more extensively as alternatives to scarce Pt. Layered materials like MXenes could stabilize these metals in single sites. Operando spectroscopies during PDH could give mechanistic clarity.

2) Survey metal pairings on various supports by high-throughput experimentation and computations to determine unconventional, high-performance compositions. Metal-support interfacial engineering could bestow stability.

3) Implement novel architectures like single atom alloys and confined cluster catalysts to limit undesirable dehydrogenation pathways. In tandem, employ spectro-microscopic tools like AP-XPS to impart views of working catalysts. 

4) Utilize the accrued wisdom from fundamental catalytic studies to guide process intensification of PDH through microreactor prototyping, membrane separations, and heat integration. 

Purposeful endeavors at the confluence of these frontiers might synergize into efficient and sustainable PDH technologies for propylene production.

Based on the details extracted from the file, several studies have explored supported mono-metallic platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and iridium (Ir) catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). 

Pt-based catalysts have received significant attention, as Pt shows superior capability for C-H bond activation while minimizing undesired C-C bond scission [Reference [10.1021/acscatal.0c03391]]. Supported Pt catalysts, including Pt/Al2O3 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03381, 10.1016/0021-9517(86)90312-X], Pt/BN [10.1016/j.jechem.2021.10.008], and Pt/zeolites [10.1038/s41467-018-07502-5, 10.1038/s41929-023-00968-7], have demonstrated promising PDH performance. Key findings include:

- Atomic layer deposition (ALD) Al2O3 or TiO2 overcoats on Pt/Al2O3 extrudates increased PDH yield and selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.0c03391].  

- Adding 1 wt% boron promoter to Pt/γ-Al2O3 reduced coking 3-fold and boosted propylene selectivity from 90% to 98% over 12 hours [10.1021/acscatal.9b05548].

- Confining sub-nanometric Pt clusters in Ge-UTL zeolite micropores via Pt-O-Ge bonds gave a catalyst (Pt4-Ge2-d4r@UTL) with exceptional stability - no deactivation after 100 hours on stream [10.1038/s41929-023-00968-7].

Data also shows Pt/Al2O3 outperformed NiMo/Al2O3 for PDH under similar conditions, but had poorer selectivity versus optimized RhCu single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.0c05711, 10.1126/science.abg8389].

Besides Pt, a few studies explored Pd- and Ir-based catalysts. Pd, Rh, Ir are noted to have high intrinsic PDH activity, but remain costly options [10.1021/acscatal.3c01002]. No thorough evaluations of supported Pd or Ir catalysts are provided.

Overall, supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts, especially on Al2O3 and zeolite supports, have demonstrated promising capability for selective and stable PDH operation. Further tailoring metal-support interfaces and electronic properties via promoters or overcoats presents opportunities to enhance Pt's function. Evaluations of supported Pd and Ir are lacking and warrant future attention.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The collected insights spotlight supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts as frontrunners for commercial PDH processes, corroborating their widespread use. While Pt dominates current efforts, emerging single atom alloy systems with tuned metal-support couplings illustrate untapped potential beyond conventional Pt nanoparticles. Capitalizing on these early advances, future work might explore:

- Novel supports like metal-organic frameworks to manipulate Pt dispersion and metal-support interfaces
- Combining computational screening with high-throughput experiments to rapidly identify optimized mono- and multi-metallic formulations
- In-depth analysis of electronic and geometric effects governing catalyst restructuring, coking, and stability under aggressive PDH environments

Such undertakings can expand the palette of selective and robust PDH catalysts, moving beyond conventional Pt benchmarks.

Based on the details provided in the file, several studies have explored supported mono-metallic Pt, Pd, and Ir catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). 

Pt-based catalysts appear to be the most widely studied and utilized. Multiple articles evaluate alumina-supported Pt catalysts, showing they can achieve relatively high propane conversion and propylene selectivity [10.1006/jcat.1994.1333, 10.1021/acscatal.0c03391]. Adding promoters like boron [10.1021/acscatal.9b05548] or metal oxide overcoats [10.1021/acscatal.0c03391] can further enhance stability and selectivity. Other supports like boron nitride [10.1016/j.jechem.2021.10.008] and germanosilicate zeolites [10.1038/s41929-023-00968-7] have also been explored to optimize Pt dispersion and metal-support interactions. Pt-based catalysts are noted to have commercial relevance and wide use industrially [10.1016/j.apcatb.2012.11.005, 10.1002/anie.201507119, 10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7].

Beyond Pt, there is some limited data on other Group VIII metals. Pd, Rh, and Ir are noted to have potential intrinsic activity, but high cost has hindered their adoption [10.1021/acscatal.3c01002]. Supported Ru nanoparticles were found to have very low 4.5% propylene selectivity, far below Pt and optimized Ru phosphides [10.1021/acscatal.0c01667]. An isolated study on RhCu single atoms supported on silica found superior performance to a Pt/Al2O3 benchmark, showing opportunities for advanced catalyst design [10.1126/science.abg8389].

Overall, Pt-based catalysts are the predominant choice for commercial propane dehydrogenation processes, with decades of research optimizing supports, promoters, and synthesis methods. Continued development of advanced materials like zeolites and single atom alloys may provide opportunities to further enhance catalytic performance.

※※※ 

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The collected insights spotlight Pt as the foremost viable mono-metallic dehydrogenation catalyst, buoyed by exhaustive optimization over extended timescales. However, singular evaluations of unconventional compositions like RhCu unveil remarkable prospective pathways to transcend inherent limitations of conventional catalysts. Delving into uncharted compositions guided by emerging principles of single atom alloy configurations could unravel breakthrough chemical efficacies. Analogously, interweaving zeolitic micropores with atomically dispersed motifs linked via metal-support conjugations engenders site-isolation-derived selectivities. Exploring frontiers of catalyst conceptualization guided by electronic and geometric orchestration of site-specific reactivities remains indispensable to providing next-generation dehydrogenation solutions tailored for propane feedstocks.

Supported mono-metallic platinum (Pt) catalysts have been widely explored for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to Pt's superior ability to activate C-H bonds while minimizing undesirable C-C bond cleavage. Several studies have evaluated Pt supported on various metal oxides like alumina and silica. 

One article showed Pt supported on alumina maintains high initial activity but deactivates over multiple PDH cycles due to Pt agglomeration accelerated by sulfur [10.1016/0021-9517(86)90312-X]. Adding sulfur to Pt/alumina during preparation or in the gas phase was found to greatly enhance selectivity to propylene, with predosing at 873 K having the largest effect [10.1006/jcat.1994.1333].

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of metal oxide overcoats on supported Pt catalysts is an emerging strategy to increase PDH yield and selectivity. Al2O3 and TiO2 ALD overcoats on extruded Pt/Al2O3 gave higher propane conversion compared to unmodified Pt/Al2O3 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03391]. Promoting Pt/Al2O3 with 1 wt% boron markedly reduced coking and boosted propylene selectivity from 90% to 98% over 12 hours [10.1021/acscatal.9b05548].

Besides Pt/metal oxide supports, recent work has explored single Pt sites isolated in zeolites like Ge-UTL. Confining sub-nanometric Pt clusters in Ge-UTL channels via Pt-O-Ge bonds gave a catalyst with excellent stability and 96% propylene selectivity [10.1038/s41929-023-00968-7].

While less studied than Pt, some supported Pd, Rh and Ir catalysts have shown promise for PDH but face economic challenges [10.1021/acscatal.3c01002]. An supported RhCu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst demonstrated far higher activity and 100% propylene selectivity compared to Pt/Al2O3 under identical conditions [10.1126/science.abg8389].

Overall, Pt-based catalysts have been the most widely commercialized for PDH, with strategic modifications like promoters and overcoats emerging to further enhance selectivity and stability. Beyond Pt, single atom alloy catalysts present opportunities to dramatically boost productivity if economic hurdles can be overcome.

※※※ 
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Supported mono- and bi-metallic catalysts have demonstrated tremendous advancements for propane dehydrogenation. However, opportunities remain to explore novel supports like metal-organic frameworks and optimize beyond conventional metals. Leveraging in situ characterization techniques can provide invaluable insights into working catalysts. Operando spectroscopy and microscopy methods to probe dynamic structural changes could elucidate deactivation pathways and guide design of enhanced catalysts. Machine learning additionally shows promise to accelerate identification of optimized PDH catalyst compositions and architectures.
