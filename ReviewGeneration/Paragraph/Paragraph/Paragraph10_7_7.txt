Based on the details extracted from the literature, various mechanistic scenarios have been proposed for propane dehydrogenation over different metal oxide catalysts. 

On Cr-based catalysts, active sites have been identified as coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species [Placeholder_Of_DOI1], Cr3+/Cr2+ redox pairs [Placeholder_Of_DOI2], and tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ sites [Placeholder_Of_DOI3] that activate the C-H bond in propane. Reaction pathways involve redox cycles between Cr3+ and Cr6+ oxidation states as well as non-oxidative routes. 

For V-based catalysts, Mars-Van Krevelen type mechanisms have been widely proposed involving lattice oxygen and V5+/V4+/V3+ redox cycles [Placeholder_Of_DOI4, Placeholder_Of_DOI5]. Isolated V sites as well as dimeric and oligomeric V species have been identified as active centers. Reaction steps include irreversible CH activation by lattice oxygen, propylene desorption, and catalyst re-oxidation.  

On ZrO2, DFT studies have revealed Zr cations with unsaturated coordination at oxygen vacancies as the active sites [Placeholder_Of_DOI6]. They catalyze homolytic C-H bond scission in propane. Similar sites have been proposed on ZnZrxOy involving isolated Zn2+ anchored on ZrO2 [Placeholder_Of_DOI7]. A concerted dual C-H cleavage pathway was shown on Ga-doped ZrO2 [Placeholder_Of_DOI8].

For Ga2O3 polymorphs and supported Ga2O3, heterolytic dissociation has been widely proposed involving dissociative propane adsorption and subsequent propylene elimination steps [Placeholder_Of_DOI9, Placeholder_Of_DOI10]. Other reaction routes have focused on isolated Ga+/Ga3+ sites in zeolites [Placeholder_Of_DOI11].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The mechanistic proposals compiled from the literature offer valuable insights into propane dehydrogenation over metal oxides. While significant advances have been made in identifying active sites and elucidating pathways, opportunities exist to build comprehensive kinetic models quantifying detailed individual steps. Operando spectroscopy can help track reaction intermediates and surface transformations. Kinetic isotope experiments could probe rate-determining steps. Computationally screening for optimal multifunctional sites and unveiling coverage effects represent uncharted domains. Exploring mechanisms and descriptors in these directions would accelerate the design of selective and stable propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

根据从文献中提取的详细信息,在不同的金属氧化物催化剂上已经提出了各种丙烷脱氢的机理场景。

在Cr基催化剂上,活性位点被确定为无配位的Cr3+物种[Placeholder_Of_DOI1]、Cr3+/Cr2+氧化还原对[Placeholder_Of_DOI2]和四面体配位的Cr6+位点[Placeholder_Of_DOI3],这些位点激活丙烷中的C-H键。反应途径涉及Cr3+和Cr6+氧化态之间的氧化还原循环以及非氧化路线。

对于V基催化剂,广泛提出了Mars-Van Krevelen类型的机制,涉及晶格氧和V5+/V4+/V3+氧化还原循环[Placeholder_Of_DOI4,Placeholder_Of_DOI5]。 已经确定孤立的V位点以及二聚体和寡聚体V物种是活性中心。反应步骤包括不可逆的CH激活通过晶格氧、丙烯脱附和催化剂再氧化。

在ZrO2上,DFT研究揭示了氧缺陷处无饱和配位的Zr阳离子作为活性位点[Placeholder_Of_DOI6]。它们催化丙烷中C-H键的均裂。在ZnZrxOy上观察到了类似的位点,其中Zn2+锚定在ZrO2上[Placeholder_Of_DOI7]。 在Ga掺杂的ZrO2上显示了协同的双C-H键裂解途径[Placeholder_Of_DOI8]。

对于Ga2O3多形体和负载Ga2O3,广泛地提出了杂裂解机制,涉及解离性丙烷吸附和后续丙烯消除步骤[Placeholder_Of_DOI9,Placeholder_Of_DOI10]。 其他反应途径集中在分子筛中的孤立Ga+/Ga3+位点[Placeholder_Of_DOI11]。

综合理解与未来展望:从文献中编译的机理提议为金属氧化物催化的丙烷脱氢提供了有价值的见解。尽管在识别活性位点和阐明途径方面取得了重大进展,但仍有机会建立全面描述各个详细步骤的动力学模型。操作体系光谱可以帮助跟踪反应中间体和表面转换。动力学同位素实验可以探测决定速率的步骤。 从计算上筛选optimal多功能位点和揭示coverage效应代表了未开垦的领域。 在这些方向上探索机理和描述子将加速选择性和稳定丙烷脱氢催化剂的设计。
