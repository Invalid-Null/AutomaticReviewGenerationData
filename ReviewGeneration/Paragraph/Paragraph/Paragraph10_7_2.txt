Based on the details extracted from the literature, various mechanistic scenarios have been proposed for propane dehydrogenation over different metal oxide catalysts. 

On Cr-based catalysts, coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ sites [DOI1], Cr3+ species with two coordination vacancies [DOI2], and Cr6+/Cr3+/Cr2+ redox cycles [DOI3] have been suggested as active sites. The reaction steps may involve activation of propane C-H bonds, formation of propyl intermediates, and elimination to release propene. Promotional effects of CO2 via re-oxidation of reduced Cr sites have also been described [DOI4].

For V-based catalysts, Mars-van Krevelen type mechanisms have been widely proposed, involving lattice oxygen participation [DOI5, DOI6]. Isolated V5+ sites get reduced to V3+ upon reaction with propane, followed by re-oxidation with O2 or CO2. Sub-monolayer VOx species help minimize overoxidation issues [DOI7]. Non-oxidative pathways over reduced V3+ sites have also been suggested when lattice oxygen is depleted [DOI8].

On ZrO2, DFT studies have identified Zrcus sites formed at oxygen vacancies as active sites that can activate propane C-H bonds and form propyl intermediates [DOI9, DOI10]. Neighboring lattice oxygen assists in hydrogen abstraction steps. Similar heterolytic or concerted routes have been described on Ga2O3, with Ga3+ sites involved in C-H activation [DOI11, DOI12].

Additionally, synergistic effects between different sites like Zn-Zr [DOI13] and terminal Ti4c-Ovac pairs [DOI14] have been implicated. The detailed mechanistic picture continues to be investigated through combined theoretical and experimental efforts.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Significant advancements have been made in unraveling mechanistic intricacies, active site requirements, and synergistic effects between different sites for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts. Nonetheless, several questions and research opportunities remain open. For instance, operando spectroscopic techniques could offer further insights into transient intermediates and dynamic structural changes during reaction. Data-driven computational screening approaches may also help identify novel single or multi-site catalyst designs. An overarching goal is to attain optimal balance between activity, selectivity and stability - factors which remain challenging especially under industrially relevant high throughput conditions. Advancing fundamental mechanistic knowledge forms the foundation for engineering superior catalysts to selectively transform light alkanes into value-added olefins.

根据从文献中提取的详细信息,在不同的金属氧化物催化剂上提出了各种丙烷脱氢的机理场景。

在Cr基催化剂上,已经提出了未饱和的Cr3+位点[DOI1]、两个配位空位的Cr3+化合物[DOI2]和Cr6+/Cr3+/Cr2+氧化还原循环[DOI3]作为活性位点。反应步骤可能涉及丙烷C-H键的激活、丙基中间体的形成和消除以释放丙烯。CO2的促进作用也得到了描述,它通过氧化还原Cr位点来发挥作用[DOI4]。

对于V基催化剂,广泛提出了Mars-van Krevelen型机理,涉及晶格氧的参与[DOI5, DOI6]。孤立的V5+位点在与丙烷反应时被还原为V3+,然后被O2或CO2氧化。亚单分子层VOx物种有助于最大限度地减少氧化过度问题[DOI7]。当晶格氧耗尽时,也建议了还原的V3+位点上的非氧化途径[DOI8]。

在ZrO2上,DFT研究确定Zrcus位点形成于氧空位处作为活性位点,可以激活丙烷C-H键并形成丙基中间体[DOI9, DOI10]。相邻的晶格氧有助于氢的提取步骤。Ga2O3上也描述了类似的异裂或共裂途径,Ga3+位点参与C-H活化[DOI11, DOI12]。

此外,不同位点之间的协同效应也发挥了作用,例如Zn-Zr[DOI13]和末端Ti4c-Ovac对[DOI14]。通过理论和实验的共同努力,详细的机理图景还在继续研究。

整体理解与未来展望: 在揭示不同金属氧化物催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机理复杂性、活性位点需求和不同位点之间的协同效应方面已经取得了重大进展。尽管如此,仍有几个问题和研究机会有待开拓。例如,反应过程中瞬态中间体和动态结构变化的原位光谱技术可以提供进一步的见解。数据驱动的计算筛选方法也可以帮助识别新的单址或多址催化剂设计。一个总体目标是在工业相关的高通量条件下,在活性、选择性和稳定性之间获得最佳平衡,这些因素的平衡仍然具有挑战性。推进基础机理知识的积累为设计出色的催化剂奠定了基础,以选择性地将轻烷转化为价值增值的烯烃。
