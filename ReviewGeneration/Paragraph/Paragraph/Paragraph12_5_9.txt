Based on the details provided in the file, several studies have explored supported mono-metallic platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and iridium (Ir) catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. 

Pt-based catalysts appear to be the most widely studied and utilized. Multiple articles show Pt supported on various metal oxides like alumina and silica demonstrates high propane conversion rates and propylene selectivity [Placeholder_Of_DOI1, Placeholder_Of_DOI2]. Doping Pt/Al2O3 with promoters such as boron can further enhance performance by reducing coking and increasing selectivity [Placeholder_Of_DOI3]. There is also evidence that carefully controlling Pt nanoparticle size, morphology, and electronic properties via strong metal-support interactions can optimize propane dehydrogenation activity [Placeholder_Of_DOI4, Placeholder_Of_DOI5]. 

Compared to Pt, fewer studies focus solely on supported Pd or Ir catalysts. One article briefly mentions Pd and Ir have high intrinsic activity, but does not provide any actual data [Placeholder_Of_DOI6]. Overall, Pt appears to be the predominant supported mono-metallic catalyst studied for propane dehydrogenation thus far.

The progress on tuning Pt nanoparticles for enhanced propane dehydrogenation highlights the importance of optimizing metal-support interfaces. Further work probing how the support governs Pt morphology, electronic properties, and stability could uncover new pathways to designing superior catalysts. There are also opportunities to explore whether Pd or Ir can match or potentially surpass Pt's performance with similar interface engineering. Expanding the types of supports beyond common metal oxides may also reveal more active sites. Lastly, operando spectroscopy techniques could provide crucial insights into working catalysts to guide the development of more robust mono-metallic propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Pt纳米颗粒的调控为提高丙烷脱氢反应活性提供了视角,凸显了优化金属-载体界面结构的重要性。进一步研究载体如何影响Pt的形貌、电子性质和稳定性,可能会开辟设计卓越催化剂的新途径。也有机会利用类似的界面工程,探索Pd或Ir是否可以匹配或超越Pt的催化性能。扩大载体种类,超越常见的金属氧化物载体,也可能会揭示出更加活跃的位点。最后,原位光谱可以深入地研究工况催化剂,为开发更稳定的单金属丙烷脱氢催化剂提供关键指导。
