Based on the in-depth details extracted from the references furnished, working propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts have been probed using a variety of in-situ characterization techniques to gain insights into their structure-activity relationships during reaction. 

Multiple studies have utilized in-situ DRIFTS to investigate surface species and monitor the transformation of active sites in real time during PDH. For example, ZnOH groups were shown to convert to catalytically active ZnH+ sites over ZnOx catalysts [10.1038/s41586-021-03923-3]. In-situ Raman spectroscopy also enabled tracking defects sites like V4+ and structural changes in metal oxides that impact activity [10.1002/anie.202005968, 10.1021/acscatal.8b04701]. Synchrotron-based in-situ XAS and XPS unravelled the tendency for transition metals like Cr, V, Fe and Zn to undergo partial reduction under PDH environments, offering atomic-level perspectives into their working state [10.1016/j.jcat.2004.03.014, 10.1038/s41586-021-03923-3]. Customized cells permitted acquiring data at industrially relevant high temperatures up to 650°C, capturing real-time insights into oxidation state transformations [10.1021/acscatal.2c03240]. 

Operando spectroscopies when coupled with simultaneous activity testing in lab-scale reactors allowed formulating structure-performance relations. For instance, UV-Vis detected rapid generation of Cr3+ sites from Cr6+ under propane flow whilst GC tracked corresponding activity enhancements [10.1006/jcat.2001.3372]. Mechanistic investigations also became feasible like proving H2 evolution as the rate limiting step for VOx/HMS catalysts using transient product analysis by mass spectrometry [10.1016/j.jcat.2022.07.017].

As exemplified by these references, in-situ techniques furnish molecular perspectives into working catalysts that static ex-situ methods cannot capture. They serve as indispensable tools for designing better PDH catalysts through comprehension of dynamic structural phenomena governing activity and stability. Whilst most reports have focused on analyzing single catalytic materials, future explorations can undertake comparative assessments across promising candidates like Cr, V, Fe and Ga oxides under standardized environments. Operando setups combining spectroscopy, diffraction and microscopy at operating PDH units would generate holistic insights beyond laboratory conditions. Advanced theoretical simulations may also assist interpreting complex in-situ data. Such pursuits can accelerate identification of optimal catalyst compositions and working states for selective propane activation.

1) Harnessing in-situ cells that allow mimicking industrial environments with high propane partial pressures and temperatures up to 700°C during spectroscopy. This can offer closer representative insights.

2) Deploying state-of-art operando reactors with simultaneous X-ray or neutron scattering probes. The spectral and diffraction data obtained on working catalysts can be coupled with machine learning for predictive structure-activity models.

3) Creating in-situ fluidic platforms to synthesize and test novel catalytic materials like metal organic frameworks in a single step. This can accelerate discovery through high throughput experimentation.

In summary, in-situ spectroscopy, scattering and microscopy will continue to be indispensable for propane dehydrogenation catalysts development.

An opportunity exists to implement operando spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance techniques, online GC/MS, and synchrotron-based probes to investigate commercial catalysts within technical reactors. The mechanistic clarity this could provide may accelerate enhancements via tailored preparation strategies or targeted modifications. More widespread adoption of in-situ analyses in an industrially relevant context could fast-track the ongoing quest to optimize propane dehydrogenation catalysts and processes.

For example:

<Scores>
    <Paragraph id="1">
        <Clarity>8</Clarity>
        <Depth>7</Depth>
        <Relevance>9</Relevance>
        <Coherence>7</Coherence>
        <Originality>6</Originality>
        <Evidence-based>8</Evidence-based>
        <Structure>9</Structure>
        <TextLength>16</TextLength>
        <DistinctNumberOfDOIs>18</DistinctNumberOfDOIs>
        <Comprehensiveness>8</Comprehensiveness>
        <TotalScore>88</TotalScore>
    </Paragraph>
    <!-- Scores for additional paragraphs -->
</Scores>

Finally, identify and present the paragraph that achieved the highest combined score:

<BestParagraphResult>
    <ParagraphID>1</ParagraphID>
    <Content>
        {Raw content of the top-scoring paragraph}
        <References>
        {Raw references from the top-scoring paragraph}
        </References>
    </Content>
</BestParagraphResult>
