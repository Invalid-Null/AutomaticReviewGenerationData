Based on the details extracted from the references, catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing alternative reaction pathways and active sites that lower the activation energy barriers [10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.025]. Industrial PDH processes utilize supported metal catalysts like Pt/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3 that activate C-H bonds in propane for dehydrogenation [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.008]. DFT calculations have elucidated the active site structure on these catalysts, showing how neighboring under-coordinated metal cations provide adsorption sites for propane that facilitate dehydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.0c01580]. Metal-exchanged zeolites also introduce Lewis acid sites that selectively break C-H bonds over C-C bonds [10.1002/advs.202207756]. The specific reaction mechanisms often involve initial dissociative chemisorption of propane with elimination of H, followed by abstraction of a β-H to form propylene [10.1021/acscatal.3c00103]. By tuning the active site geometry and electronic properties, catalysts can achieve the appropriate balance of reactivity to break C-H bonds while avoiding over-reaction [10.1016/S1872-2067(18)63196-1].

※※※

The findings reviewed demonstrate how rational catalyst design based on mechanistic understanding can overcome the intrinsic kinetic and thermodynamic challenges in propane dehydrogenation. As shale gas resources continue to expand the availability of light alkane feedstocks, propane dehydrogenation presents a major opportunity to meet rising propylene demands through sustainable catalytic processes. Future research should focus on utilizing advanced characterization and computational methods to further optimize catalysts by identifying descriptors for C-H activation selectivity over C-C cleavage and coking resistance. In addition, operando spectroscopic techniques could elucidate dynamic structural changes during propane dehydrogenation to guide the development of stable, selective catalysts. Broader adoption of these structure-guided design principles could accelerate the deployment of direct propane dehydrogenation technologies.

The key mechanisms described involve hydrogen abstraction to form metal-carbon bonds on coordinatively unsaturated sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00939, 10.1021/acscatal.1c01924]. 

Alternative catalysts are also being explored, including metal oxides like ZrO2 and Ga2O3 which can provide oxygen vacancies or Lewis acid sites [10.1021/acscatal.1c02621, 10.1021/acscatal.0c05454]. Zeolites exchanged with metal cations can similarly donate electron density to adsorbed propane [10.1002/advs.202207756].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The reviewed studies reveal consistent strategies in catalyst design to promote selective C-H activation for propane dehydrogenation, while avoiding deep dehydrogenation and coking issues. This understanding may guide development of optimal single-atom Pt catalysts, building on demonstrated synergy between theory and experiment [10.1021/acscatal.1c01916, 10.1021/acscatal.1c01924]. Stabilizing coordinatively unsaturated metal sites could also be a fruitful direction, whether via confinement in zeolites/mesoporous supports or surface organometallic frameworks. More broadly, shale gas availability renders propane dehydrogenation increasingly viable, necessitating accelerated innovation in selective, stable and scalable catalysts [10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.025, 10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726].

Industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes utilize supported Pt and CrOx catalysts to activate C-H bonds in propane and facilitate dehydrogenation [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.008]. These catalysts provide alternative reaction pathways with lower activation barriers compared to the highly endothermic thermal PDH process [10.1021/jacs.2c03941]. The key mechanism enabling catalyst activity is the presence of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites that can activate propane's strong C-H bonds (409 kJ/mol) [10.1016/S1872-2067(18)63196-1]. For example, isolated Pt atoms preferentially break C-H over C-C bonds [10.1016/j.jechem.2023.04.019], while Sn atoms incorporated into zeolites introduce Lewis acid sites for C-H activation [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019]. Balancing sufficient reactivity to break C-H bonds while avoiding deep dehydrogenation and coking remains an ongoing challenge elucidated through density functional theory modeling [10.1016/S1872-2067(18)63196-1, 10.1021/acscatal.1c01916].
		※※※
		Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The reviewed studies establish that introducing specific coordinatively unsaturated metal sites enables catalysts to facilitate propane dehydrogenation through C-H activation mechanisms with lower kinetic barriers. While supported Pt and CrOx catalysts drive existing processes, continued research into novel compositions and zeolite structures promises enhanced activity, selectivity and stability. Future directions may increasingly integrate high-throughput DFT screening with rapid synthesis and testing of designed catalysts. Machine learning models trained on accumulated literature data could also accelerate identification of active site descriptors and optimize catalyst regeneration strategies.

The catalyst active sites preferentially break C-H bonds due to geometric and electronic factors [10.1016/j.jechem.2023.04.019, 10.1021/acscatal.1c01916]. Alternative catalysts like VOx/SiO2 also facilitate dehydrogenation through lower energy redox mechanisms rather than direct C-H cleavage [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999]. Introducing supports like mesoporous silica allows tuning of active site geometry and stabilization [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999].

		The findings showcase how rational catalyst design, using principles like confinement effects and geometric control of active sites, can unlock the potential of PDH for on-purpose propylene production.

The currently used industrial catalysts include chromium and platinum oxides supported on alumina, with Pt-based catalysts offering high C-H bond activation while limiting side reactions like cracking [10.1021/acscatal.3c00939, 10.1016/j.jcat.2005.01.005]. Alternative metal oxide catalysts such as VOx, ZrO2, CeO2 and Ga2O3 have also shown promise [10.1021/acscatal.0c05454]. 

Several key mechanisms of catalyst activity in propane dehydrogenation have been described. On supported Pt catalysts, C-H activation occurs preferentially over C-C bond cleavage, resulting in dehydrogenation rather than cracking [10.1016/j.jechem.2023.04.019]. DFT calculations have also revealed that isolated metal atoms like Pt at the gas-liquid interface of metal nanoparticles can serve as single-site active centers [10.1021/acscatal.1c01924]. For zeolite-based catalysts, metal cations introduced by ion exchange provide Lewis acid sites capable of activating propane's C-H bonds [10.1002/advs.202207756]. The size and coordination environment of metal clusters impacts the reactivity, with under-coordinated atoms on corners and steps promoting activity but also undesired reactions [10.1021/acscatal.5b01423]. Overall, progress has been made in elucidating catalyst design parameters that balance high C-H activation for dehydrogenation while avoiding side reactions like cracking and coking.

※※※

Integrating the insights across these studies, atomic-level characterization and theoretical modeling have proven valuable in unraveling the underlying mechanisms of catalyst activity. This foundation sets the stage for knowledge-driven design of optimized, selective and stable propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Key opportunities include further exploration of single atom catalysts, elucidation of zeolite acid site effects across framework types, and rational modulation of metal cluster size and environment. Broader integration across length scales, from electronic structure to reactor level, will undoubtedly play a pivotal role. Ultimately, progress in this vital area of catalysis research will facilitate technologies that meet growing propylene demands in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner.
