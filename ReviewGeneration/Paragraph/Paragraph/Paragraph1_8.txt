		Propylene is recognized as one of the most vital chemical feedstocks, underpinning the production of a myriad of products spanning polymers, chemicals, and plastics [10.1021/acscatal.3c00103, 10.1002/advs.202207756]. Traditional production routes via steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking struggle to fulfill the rapidly rising global demands, estimated to reach 191 megatons by 2030 [10.1002/advs.202207756]. This supply-demand disparity has led to growing attention on alternative pathways to augment propylene yields. 
		Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has surfaced as an economically favorable and eco-friendly means of leveraging abundant supplies of propane from shale gas to generate on-purpose propylene [10.1021/acscatal.3c00889, 10.1021/acscatal.3c00103]. By exploiting propane’s distinct price advantage compared to propylene, PDH renders substantial value creation prospects [10.1021/acscatal.3c00103]. However, substantial process intensification is still necessitated to conquer the reaction’s thermodynamic limitations.

		Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Recent advancements in PDH catalysts and processes signal an optimistic outlook for enhancing propylene yields through this route [10.1021/acscatal.3c00939, 10.1016/j.jechem.2023.01.055]. Yet open-ended potential remains to fully transform this technology’s industrial landscape. Exploring emerging concepts like membrane reactors and electrocatalysis might unravel innovative techniques to push equilibrium limitations. Coupling PDH with other chemical production pathways could also foster more holistic refinery-petrochemical integration.

		丙烯被公认为最重要的化学原料之一,支撑着从聚合物、化学品到塑料等众多产品的生产 [10.1021/acscatal.3c00103, 10.1002/advs.202207756]。传统的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解生产路线难以满足全球需求的迅速增长,预计到2030年将达到1.91亿吨[10.1002/advs.202207756]。这种供需差距的扩大引起了人们对其他途径的日益关注,以增加丙烯产量。
		丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为一种经济有利和环保的方式,利用页岩气中丰富的丙烷生成针对性丙烯[10.1021/acscatal.3c00889, 10.1021/acscatal.3c00103],已成为研究热点。通过利用丙烷相对丙烯的价格优势,PDH呈现出可带来可观价值的前景[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103]。然而,仍有必要对该反应的热动力学限制进行大幅度的工艺改进。

		综合理解与未来展望:PDH催化剂和工艺的最新进展预示着这条途径增强丙烯产量的前景乐观[10.1021/acscatal.3c00939, 10.1016/j.jechem.2023.01.055]。但改造这项技术的工业格局仍有广阔的空间。探索膜反应器、电催化等新兴概念,可能会开辟创新技术推动热平衡限制。将PDH与其他化学生产途径耦合,也可能促进更加整体的炼油一石化体系的融合。
