Propylene is an essential raw material in the chemical industry, utilized in manufacturing a wide range of products like polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acetone, etc [Placeholder_Of_DOI2, Placeholder_Of_DOI3, Placeholder_Of_DOI4]. Traditional production routes via steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha and heavy oil are unable to meet the rapidly rising global demand [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]. This has led to widening supply-demand gaps since 2015, with projections of continued growth at 2-3% annually through 2030 [Placeholder_Of_DOI3].  

In light of these trends, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a promising and commercially deployed pathway for on-purpose propylene generation [Placeholder_Of_DOI5, Placeholder_Of_DOI6]. By utilizing abundant and inexpensive propane feedstocks from shale gas, PDH provides a cost-competitive and environmentally-friendly route compared to conventional technologies [Placeholder_Of_DOI7]. Moreover, PDH already accounts for almost 10% of global propylene output [Placeholder_Of_DOI8].

However, considerable research is still needed to enhance performance. The endothermic PDH reaction requires high temperatures of 500-600°C to achieve adequate conversion, along with catalysts that balance activity, selectivity and stability [Placeholder_Of_DOI9]. Nevertheless, if these challenges can be overcome, PDH represents an attractive option for meeting rising propylene demands well into the future [Placeholder_Of_DOI5, Placeholder_Of_DOI8].
※※※  
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Propane dehydrogenation has clearly emerged as a commercially-viable pathway for tackling growing propylene demands within the chemical sector. While work remains in optimizing performance, the long-term economics seem favorable considering inexpensive propane feedstocks from shale gas and high value propylene products. 

Looking ahead, research could explore hybrid processes combining PDH with other technologies like oxidative dehydrogenation or membrane separations. This may enable further efficiency gains. Additionally, technoeconomic analyses accounting for factors like emissions, water usage and demand growth can guide optimal deployment strategies. Overall there are still fruitful opportunities to refine PDH into an even more competitive and sustainable propylene production route.

丙烯是化工行业中必不可少的原料,用于生产各种产品,如聚丙烯、丙烯醇、丙烯腈、丙酮等[Placeholder_Of_DOI2,Placeholder_Of_DOI3, Placeholder_Of_DOI4]。 传统的原油裂化和重油蒸汽裂化路线无法满足全球需求的迅速增长[Placeholder_Of_DOI2]。 这导致自2015年以来供需差距不断扩大,预计到2030年年增长率将达到2-3% [Placeholder_Of_DOI3]。

鉴于这些趋势,丙烷脱氢(PDH)已成为一个有前景和商业化的专用丙烯生产途径[Placeholder_Of_DOI5,Placeholder_Of_DOI6]。 PDH利用页岩气中丰富廉价的丙烷原料,与常规技术相比,这是一种具有竞争力和环保的路线[Placeholder_Of_DOI7]。 此外,PDH已经占全球丙烯产量的近10% [Placeholder_Of_DOI8]。

然而,仍需要大量研究来提高性能。 PDH反应需要高温(500-600°C)才能达到足够的转化率,以及在活性,选择性和稳定性之间取得平衡的催化剂[Placeholder_Of_DOI9]。 尽管如此,如果这些挑战能够克服,PDH代表了满足不断上升的丙烯需求的有吸引力的选择[Placeholder_Of_DOI5, Placeholder_Of_DOI8]。

综合理解与未来展望:丙烷脱氢显然已经成为化工行业应对不断增长的丙烯需求的商业化途径。 尽管性能优化仍有工作要做,但从长远来看,经济效益似乎很有前景,考虑到页岩气中廉价的丙烷原料和高价值的丙烯产品。

展望未来,研究可以探索将PDH与其他技术(如氧化脱氢或膜分离)相结合的混合工艺。 这可以实现进一步的效率提升。 此外,考虑排放、用水量和需求增长等因素的技术经济分析可以指导最佳的部署策略。 总的来说,PDH仍有大量机会成为更具竞争力和可持续性的丙烯生产途径。
