Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysis is an important industrial process for producing propene, relying on solid catalysts to facilitate the endothermic conversion of propane to propene. Gaining fundamental insights into the nature of active sites and tracking changes during reaction are key for developing improved catalytic materials. X-ray based spectroscopic and scattering techniques offer powerful capabilities to study oxidation state changes and transformations in PDH systems in situ under working conditions.

An insightful study by Wang et al. [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726] performed X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) comprised of X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) during propane dehydrogenation over cobalt-incorporated BEA catalysts. Experiments at the Co K-edge were conducted at a synchrotron source on fresh and spent catalysts to explore changes in the cobalt environment. According to the FT-EXAFS and WT-EXAFS spectral analysis, the local coordination structure around cobalt remained largely unchanged before and after PDH reactions. The preserved tetrahedral Co2+ sites were identified as the predominant active sites for the dehydrogenation turnover. These findings confirm the structural stability and consistent oxidation state enabling sustained catalyst performance.

Further usage of XAS for tracking oxidation states changes comes from Li et al. [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014], where time-resolved XANES data showed isolated tetrahedral Cr6+ species in Cr/SBA-15 catalysts were reduced to Cr3+ species within 90 seconds of initiating propane dehydrogenation reactions. The disappearance of the pre-edge peak, shift to lower absorption edge energies, and increased white line intensity signified the change from tetrahedral to octahedral coordination accompanying the reduction processes. 

Complementary to XAS methods, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has also yielded insights into evolving speciation during catalyst treatment steps. Studies on PtSn/Al2O3 dehydrogenation catalysts [10.1016/j.cej.2014.09.107] utilized XPS to demonstrate how the catalyst oxidation states changed after steam pretreatments. It was found that Sn predominantly formed oxidized species after the treatment, while Pt remained in the metallic state. This signified decomposition of the PtSn alloy phase during the catalyst regeneration protocol.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on elucidating complete catalytic cycles utilizing synchronized in-situ/operando XAS, XPS, electron microscopy, and vibrational spectroscopy. Multi-modal approaches can provide new structure-function-stability correlations. Additionally, machine learning methods offer promise in rationalizing complex spectroscopic transformations and accelerating knowledge discovery. Pursuing operando studies under industrially-relevant conditions using advanced reactors remains an aspiring goal. Integrating novel characterization strategies with high-throughput catalysis can also facilitate optimization of next-generation PDH catalysts and processes.

Based on the insights extracted from the file, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts have been extensively studied using X-ray based techniques to probe changes in metal oxidation states and coordination environments during various catalyst treatment steps as well as under reaction conditions. 

X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), including XANES and EXAFS, has been widely utilized to track the changes in oxidation state and coordination geometry of active species like Cr, V, Ga and Zn during reduction or oxidation pretreatments. For example, in situ XANES revealed changes in chromium speciation from isolated Cr(VI) sites to reduced Cr(III) species during initial PDH reaction stages over Cr-MCM-41 catalysts [10.1016/j.jcat.2004.03.014]. Another study showed partial reduction of framework Zn(II) centers in Zn/H-ZSM-5 zeolites during high temperature H2 treatment, associated with decreasing Zn-O coordination [10.1038/s41586-021-03923-3].

In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has offered valuable insights into catalyst compositional changes and evolution of specific metal oxidation states under different environmental exposures. Quantitative analysis of XPS spectral components made it possible to calculate relative abundances of various metal valence states like Cr(III)/Cr(VI) in Cr/Al2O3 [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.01.005], V(IV)/V(V) in V/Si-Beta [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63444-3], or Sn(II)/Sn(IV) in PtSn/Al2O3 [10.1016/j.cej.2014.09.107] catalysts during treatment in H2, oxidizing, or reaction atmospheres.


Notably, continuous advancements in in-situ/operando XAS and XPS techniques under near-ambient pressure conditions now permit tracking metal oxidation state changes during actual propane dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, Pt L-III edge XANES uncovered periodic oxidation-reduction cycling of Sn as it segregates from Pt nanoparticles during coke burn-off and subsequent H2 regeneration over PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.09.018]. Another operando NAP-XPS study on Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts directly confirmed partial reduction of exchanged Zn(II) sites to active Znδ+ species under dehydrogenation temperatures [10.1016/j.jechem.2021.04.034].

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The wealth of information revealed by X-ray based probes highlights their power in unraveling catalyst compositional and electronic structure changes governing activity, selectivity and stability during propane dehydrogenation. Building on these advancements, continued application of operando XAS, XPS and emerging techniques like HAXPES could further our mechanistic comprehension by connecting transformation phenomena to actual catalytic performance attributes. 

Moreover, correlative microscopy examinations coupling X-ray nano-probes with spatial imaging modalities can map oxidation state gradients over individual catalytic particles with nanometer resolution. These multi-parametric techniques blending electronic sensitivities with real-space imaging may illuminate degradation and restructuring processes previously hidden from view. Future research harnessing such correlative inner workings could inform rational design paradigms aimed at tuning and optimizing catalytic functions by targeting specific redox transitions associated with PDH activation and deactivation pathways.
