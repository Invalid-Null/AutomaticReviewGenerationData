The file reveals that none of the articles explored the use of subsurface promoters like Re or Mn in bimetallic and alloy catalysts to tune selectivity during propane dehydrogenation. No specific examples or data were provided across the various studies analyzed [10.1021/acscatal.3c00548, 10.1016/j.cej.2014.02.084, 10.1021/acscatal.2c05671, 10.1021/acscatal.2c00642, 10.1021/acscatal.0c01667, 10.1002/anie.201805150, 10.1021/es301323, 10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019, 10.1038/s41467-018-07502-5, 10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.129, 10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c03074, 10.1021/acscatal.2c05042, 10.1002/anie.201507119, 10.1021/acscatal.0c01554, 10.1006/jcat.2000.2910, 10.1038/s41929-020-0472-7, 10.1006/jcat.1996.0001, 10.1021/acscatal.1c04092, 10.1016/j.jechem.2021.04.034, 10.1021/acscatal.3c00103, 10.1038/s41565-023-01344-z, 10.1021/jacs.8b05378, 10.1021/acscatal.2c04889, 10.1021/acscatal.5b01423, 10.1021/jacs.1c10261, 10.1016/j.jechem.2017.09.035, 10.1021/acscatal.1c05921].

However, one study [10.1021/jacs.8b08162] did analyze the use of subsurface Mn promoter in Pt3Mn bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The subsurface Mn layer was shown to significantly improve selectivity over Pt catalysts alone by altering the surface chemistry and adsorption properties. Kinetic models were also developed to elucidate the role of the distinct subsurface layers in modifying selectivity. Overall, this highlights the promise of tuning subsurface promoters and composition to optimize catalytic performance.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The analyses reveal a gap in exploring subsurface promoter effects during propane dehydrogenation over bimetallic and alloy catalysts. While one study showed promise for subsurface Mn in Pt3Mn catalysts, several open questions remain regarding optimal subsurface tuning using other promoters like Re as well as different bimetallic combinations and structures. Advancing microscopic characterization techniques and kinetic modeling methodologies can further shed light on subsurface phenomenon. There are rich opportunities to systematically vary subsurface layers and probe the impacts on selectivity trends. Such endeavors can unravel novel pathways to rationally design superior catalysts by harnessing subsurface promoter functionalities.

Based on the details provided in the file, none of the articles explore the use of subsurface promoters like Re or Mn in bimetallic and alloy catalysts to tune selectivity. 

Most of the articles focus solely on the surface properties and compositions of various mono and bimetallic catalysts such as Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, Cr, etc. without investigating the role of subsurface promoters. 

Only one article with the DOI [10.1021/jacs.8b08162] shows the use of subsurface Mn promoter in Pt3Mn bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The Pt3Mn subsurface significantly improved selectivity over Pt alone by altering the heats of adsorption. This highlights the distinct role of subsurface promoters in modifying surface chemical properties.

Overall, there is a paucity of research on subsurface promoter effects, presenting an opportunity for future work to explore emerging methodologies in this area.

※※※

With only one study demonstrating the selectivity benefits of subsurface Mn, additional research is warranted to expand the library of bimetallic and alloy catalysts leveraging subsurface tuning. Future endeavors may investigate the mechanistic underpinnings behind enhanced selectivity from subsurface promoters through advanced characterization and theoretical modeling. Exploring alternative subsurface promoters and broadening the substrate scope could unveil innovative pathways and catalyst architectures for superior performance. Subsurface tuning provides a promising yet underutilized strategy for exerting precise control over catalytic selectivity.

None of the studies delve into subsurface tuning mechanisms using Re, Mn or other promoters; the investigations are limited to bimetallic catalyst compositions without subsurface modification [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019, 10.1038/s41467-018-07502-5, 10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.129, 10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c03074, 10.1021/acscatal.2c05042].

While most works do not consider subsurface promoters, one study utilizes subsurface Mn in Pt3Mn bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation [10.1021/jacs.8b08162]. The presence of subsurface Mn instead of Pt significantly improves selectivity by reducing hydrocarbon and hydrogen adsorption strengths. Models are developed to elucidate the role of distinct subsurface sites in modifying surface reactivity and selectivity. This underscores the potential of subsurface promoter tuning, via Re, Mn or other transition metals, as an emerging strategy to tailor catalytic performance.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The investigations surveyed showcase a research lacuna surrounding subsurface promoters in alloy dehydrogenation catalysts. Barring isolated efforts, the focus has centered on tuning bimetallic compositions without subsurface modification. Findings from the sole study evidencing enhanced propane dehydrogenation selectivity with subsurface Mn highlight the promise of subsurface tuning. Extending this approach by exploring subsurface Re, Mn and other promoters emerges as an uncharted territory holding immense potential to advance selectivity control and optimization. Research endeavors might productively shift toward developing novel synthetic routes to insert desired subsurface promoters, coupled with kinetic studies and microkinetic models to elicit subsurface tuning mechanisms. Broader horizons might entail expanding this strategy toward other catalytic systems and targeted chemical transformations.

Based on the details provided in the file, none of the articles explored the use of subsurface promoters like Re or Mn in bimetallic and alloy catalysts to tune selectivity for propane dehydrogenation. Most of the articles focused solely on bimetallic catalysts without any subsurface promoters. 

For example, one article studied bimetallic PdBi catalysts without any subsurface tuning to optimize selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.2c00642]. Another focused only on the effects of phosphorus addition in Ru-P bimetallic catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.0c01667]. Several other articles explored monometallic catalysts like Pt [10.1021/acscatal.5b01423], chromium oxide [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014], and vanadium oxide [10.1016/S1872-2067(18)63048-7] without any subsurface promoters.

However, one article did show that using subsurface promoter Mn in Pt3Mn bimetallic catalysts significantly improved propane dehydrogenation selectivity over Pt [10.1021/jacs.8b08162]. The Mn promoter helped lower hydrocarbon and hydrogen adsorption heats, altering the surface chemistry to enhance selectivity. Models were also presented to elucidate the distinct role of the subsurface layer. This demonstrates the potential of subsurface tuning with promoters to optimize catalyst selectivity.

Overall, subsurface promotion is still an emerging strategy, with most current research focused on bimetallic catalyst compositions and architectures. Further studies exploring the integration of promoters into subsurface sites could uncover new pathways to selectively tune catalyst surfaces. Advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling will be key to unraveling the role of subsurface species in modifying selectivity.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The findings here reveal a research gap and opportunity to advance selective dehydrogenation reactions crucial for propane-to-propylene processes. While bimetallic catalysts have shown promise, subsurface tuning provides another handle to optimize selectivity beyond conventional means. 

By elucidating subsurface promotion effects through systemic studies, researchers can expand the toolbox for rational design of selective sites. Controlled synthesis methods and in situ techniques are critical to effectively incorporate promoters into subsurface locations. Apart from Re and Mn, other promoters could bring differentiated electronic and geometric effects. 

Modeling efforts should couple with experiments to offer atomic-level views of how subsurface promoters modify electron densities, binding strengths, and transition states. A more nuanced understanding of these phenomena may stimulate ideas for unconventional bimetallic architectures, multifunctional promoters, and ternary catalysts. The knowledge can then feedback into achieving enhanced propane dehydrogenation efficiency and mitigate overoxidation issues plaguing current technologies.

※※※

While subsurface promoters were generally not explored for tuning selectivity, the one example with Pt3Mn subsurface layers highlights an interesting area for further research. As catalyst design progresses to manipulate subsurface architecture in addition to surface composition and structure, new opportunities may emerge to strategically place promoters in subsurface sites. This could enable precise tuning of binding energies and surface reactivity toward targeted products. 

Additionally, new characterization techniques and advanced simulations to probe subsurface sites could uncover detailed mechanistic pathways on how subsurface promoters alter selectivity. Such insights can guide rational subsurface promoter selection and placement within different bimetallic systems to optimize selectivity for key reactions like propane dehydrogenation. Exploring these research directions can expand the toolkit for selectively transforming alkanes into value-added olefins.

Specifically, [10.1021/jacs.8b08162] showed that a Pt3Mn subsurface significantly improved propane dehydrogenation selectivity over Pt by lowering hydrocarbon/hydrogen adsorption heats. Models were presented to demonstrate the distinct role of the subsurface Mn promoter in altering surface chemistry and selectivity. However, this was the only article that provided insights into subsurface promoter effects.

The remaining articles did not provide any specific examples or data on the use of subsurface promoters like Re or Mn to optimize selectivity in bimetallic and alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Based on the collected evidence, there appears to be a significant research gap and opportunity to further explore subsurface promoter tuning for enhanced selectivity.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The lone study highlighting subsurface Mn promotion effects indicates subsurface engineering can play a pivotal role in regulating selectivity. Building on this foundation, future endeavors could systematically investigate various bimetallic configurations with assorted subsurface promoters (Re, Mn, etc.) to optimize selectivity during propane dehydrogenation. Advanced characterization techniques like synchrotron measurements could offer insights into the electronic structure modifications induced by subsurface species. Kinetic models incorporating these subsurface effects may better elucidate the selectivity determinants. Broader horizons could explore expanding this subsurface tuning approach to other critical dehydrogenation reactions through interdisciplinary cross-pollination.
