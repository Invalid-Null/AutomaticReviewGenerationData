Based on the details extracted from the literature, various mechanistic scenarios have been proposed for propane dehydrogenation over different metal oxide catalysts. 

On Cr-based oxide catalysts, isolated Cr3+ sites [Placeholder_Of_DOI1], Cr3+/Cr2+ redox couples [Placeholder_Of_DOI2], and coordinatively unsaturated Cr6+ species [Placeholder_Of_DOI3] have been identified as active sites. The reaction mechanisms involve heterolytic C-H bond cleavage, formation of propyl intermediates, and β-H elimination to release propene. The active Cr3+ sites can be generated in situ during the reaction. 

VOx-based catalysts are proposed to catalyze propane dehydrogenation via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, utilizing redox couples like V5+/V4+/V3+ [Placeholder_Of_DOI4]. Initial oxidative dehydrogenation pathways involving lattice oxygen are followed by non-oxidative steps over reduced V species once lattice oxygen is depleted [Placeholder_Of_DOI5]. Isolated V sites show higher selectivity compared to oligomeric V oxide phases.

On ZrO2, DFT calculations suggest that two Zr cations with unsaturated coordination (Zrcus) located at an oxygen vacancy serve as active sites [Placeholder_Of_DOI6]. They are involved in homolytic C-H bond cleavage and formation of propyl intermediates prior to dehydrogenation. Introduction of dopants like Ga can alter the mechanistic pathway and lower the activation barrier.

For Ga oxide catalysts, tetrahedral Ga3+ sites are identified as active for dehydrogenation [Placeholder_Of_DOI7]. A heterolytic dissociation mechanism is preferred over a redox pathway, with C-H bond cleavage as the rate-limiting step. Acid-base pair sites between Ga and protons also demonstrate high activity.

Thus, the studies highlight opportunities to tune the active sites, intermediates, and mechanistic pathways over metal oxide catalysts through compositional modulations and introduction of vacancies/dopants. Future research might integrate operando spectroscopic techniques with theoretical modeling to gain atomic-level insights into promising compositional formulations.

根据从文献中提取的细节,在不同的金属氧化物催化剂上已经为丙烷脱氢提出了各种机理场景。

在Cr基氧化物催化剂上,已经确定隔离的Cr3+位点[Placeholder_Of_DOI1]、Cr3+/ Cr2+氧化还原偶和缺乏配位的Cr6+物种[Placeholder_Of_DOI3]是活性位点。反应机理包括杂解C-H键的断裂、丙基中间体的形成以及β-H消除以释放丙烯。活性Cr3+位点可以在反应过程中原位生成。

人们提出VOx基催化剂通过Mars-van Krevelen机理催化丙烷脱氢,利用像V5+/V4+/V3+这样的氧化还原偶[Placeholder_Of_DOI4]。在晶格氧耗尽之后,初期的氧化脱氢途径转向经还原的V物种上的非氧化步骤[Placeholder_Of_DOI5]。与低聚合VOx相比,隔离的V位点显示出更高的选择性。

在ZrO2上,DFT计算表明,位于一个氧空位的两个未饱和配位的Zr阳离子(Zrcus)作为活性位点[Placeholder_Of_DOI6]。它们参与均裂C-H键的断裂和丙基中间体的形成,然后发生脱氢。引入像Ga这样的掺杂剂可以改变机理途径并降低活化能垒。


对于Ga氧化物催化剂,已经确定四面体Ga3+位点是脱氢的活性位点[Placeholder_Of_DOI7]。优先选择杂解裂解机理而不是氧化还原途径,C-H键的断裂是速率控制步骤。Ga和质子之间的酸碱配位位点也显示出高活性。


因此,这些研究强调了通过组成调控和引入空位/掺杂剂来调整金属氧化物催化剂上的活性位点、中间体和机理途径的机会。未来的研究可能会将操作谱技术与理论建模相结合,以对有前景的组成公式获得原子水平的见解。
