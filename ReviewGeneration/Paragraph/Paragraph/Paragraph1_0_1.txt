Propylene is an essential raw material for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acetone, etc., with an estimated annual market size exceeding $100 billion [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]. However, there exists a significant and growing gap between propylene supply and demand, with the latter projected to increase by 2-3% per year up to 2030 [Placeholder_Of_DOI1]. Conventional production routes like naphtha steam cracking are struggling to meet this surge in demand due to constraints around crude oil feedstocks.  

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a promising technology to produce propylene by exploiting abundant supplies of shale gas-derived propane [Placeholder_Of_DOI3]. PDH is also considered more economical and environmentally friendly compared to conventional methods [Placeholder_Of_DOI7]. With propylene demand slated to grow 45% by 2030, propane dehydrogenation capacities are steadily increasing and now account for nearly 10% of global propylene output [Placeholder_Of_DOI15]. However, propane dehydrogenation is an equilibrium-limited endothermic reaction that requires operating temperatures around 500-600°C to achieve sufficient conversion levels [Placeholder_Of_DOI21]. This necessitates the development of active and stable solid catalysts.

The growing propylene demand, driven chiefly by polymer applications, coupled with propane abundance has cemented PDH as an integral route for propylene production. Going forward, catalyst design innovations enhancing conversion, selectivity and stability could expand PDH's role. The use of novel supports, promoters and unconventional active site motifs may overcome limitations around thermodynamic equilibria. Techno-economic assessments balancing capital costs, plant efficiency and environmental metrics will illuminate optimal process configurations. Furthermore,deserialized PDH units at demand centers could mitigate logistics challenges in the propylene value chain. Integrated biorefinery concepts utilizing bio-derived propane may also emerge. Ultimately, a multi-pronged approach across academia and industry encompassing materials discovery, chemical engineering and sustainability principles will shape PDH trajectories.

丙烯是生产各种化学品(如丙烯醛、聚丙烯、丙烯醚、丙酮等)的重要原料,其年市场规模估计超过1000亿美元 [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]。然而,丙烯的供需之间存在巨大的和不断增长的缺口,后者预计到2030年将以每年2-3%的速度增加[Placeholder_Of_DOI1]。传统的生产途径如轻质油裂解由于原油资源的限制,正在努力满足这一需求激增。 

通过利用页岩气中丰富的丙烷原料,丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术已成为生产丙烯的有希望的新途径[Placeholder_Of_DOI3]。与传统方法相比,PDH也被认为在经济和环保方面更具优势[Placeholder_Of_DOI7]。随着2030年丙烯需求量预计增长45%,丙烷脱氢产能也在稳步提高,目前约占全球丙烯产量的10% [Placeholder_Of_DOI15]。然而,丙烷脱氢是一种平衡限制的放热反应,需要在约500-600°C的操作温度下才能达到足够的转化率[Placeholder_Of_DOI21]。这就需要开发具有高活性和稳定性的固体催化剂。

由聚合物应用所驱动的日益增长的丙烯需求,再加上丙烷的资源丰富性,已确立了PDH作为丙烯生产中不可或缺的一条途径的地位。展望未来,催化剂设计创新用于提高转化率、选择性和稳定性可能会扩大PDH的作用。使用新的载体、助剂和非传统的活性位点可能会克服平衡限制。技术经济评估在平衡资本成本、厂房效率和环境指标方面将突出最佳的工艺配置。此外,在需求中心建设分散的PDH单元可能会减轻丙烯价值链中的物流挑战。利用生物衍生丙烷的集成生物炼制概念也可能出现。最终,跨学科和产业的多管齐下的方法,涵盖材料发现、化学工程和可持续性原理,将塑造PDH的发展轨迹。
