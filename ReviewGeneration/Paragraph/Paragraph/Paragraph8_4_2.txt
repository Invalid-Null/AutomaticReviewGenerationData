Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive route for on-purpose propylene production to meet growing demand [Placeholder_Of_DOI1]. Among the catalysts studied for this reaction, metal oxides such as Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, and Ga2O3 have shown promising performance. 

Chromia (Cr2O3) is one of the most extensively explored metal oxide catalysts for PDH. Both supported Cr2O3 and unsupported bulk Cr2O3 have been investigated [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]. Cr2O3 exhibits higher activity than many other metal oxides, attributed to its redox properties enabling Mars-van Krevelen type mechanisms [Placeholder_Of_DOI3]. Doping Cr2O3 with metals like Pt can further improve catalytic performance [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]. However, deactivate is a key issue, often caused by over-reduction of the catalyst during PDH conditions.

Bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts are among the most selective and stable options for PDH. The formation of Pt-Sn intermetallic compounds suppresses undesirable hydrogenolysis and coking reactions, increasing propylene selectivity and stability compared to Pt alone [Placeholder_Of_DOI4, Placeholder_Of_DOI5]. Pt-Sn catalysts have been successfully commercialized and implemented in fluidized bed reactors by companies like UOP [Placeholder_Of_DOI5]. The Pt:Sn ratio and preparation method greatly influence the structure of the alloy formed, which in turn impacts activity and selectivity.

Polymorphs of gallium oxide, especially β-Ga2O3, have emerged as promising PDH catalysts with yields rivaling supported Pt catalysts [Placeholder_Of_DOI6]. The catalytic performance correlates strongly with surface acid-base properties. Strong Lewis acid sites associated with exposed tetrahedral Ga3+ centers are proposed as the active sites for propane activation and dehydrogenation [Placeholder_Of_DOI7]. Compared to Cr2O3 and Pt-based catalysts, Ga2O3 exhibits significantly lower coke formation. However, Ga2O3 suffers from deactivation at higher temperatures due to phase changes. identifying strategies to stabilize specific Ga2O3 phases and morphologies remains an ongoing research direction.

While metal oxides show promise for PDH, challenges around stability and selectivity at industrially relevant conditions persist. Developing bifunctional catalysts that synergistically combine the high activity of metals like Pt with the low coking tendency of more redox-active oxides could enable enhanced performance. Elucidating fundamental insights into structure-function relationships and reaction mechanisms on these catalysts through advanced in situ spectroscopy and theoretical modeling will be key to guide rational design. Continuous research efforts to unlock the potential of metal oxides are vital to meet propylene demands in an economical and sustainable manner.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements reviewed regarding metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, several fruitful research trajectories emerge. Developing in situ characterization techniques to probe dynamic structural changes under working conditions can offer critical mechanistic insights. For instance, approaches like ambient pressure XPS could track surface oxidation states, while in situ IR tracks surface intermediates. Advanced electron microscopy methods can identify changes in morphology. Building fundamental understandings in this manner can better guide design of more stable and selective catalysts. 

An area of prospect involves exploring synergistic combinations, for example bifunctional metal/oxide catalysts. The metal functions could be tuned for dehydrogenation activity, while the oxide component offers selectivity control. Translating these materials innovations to flow reactor and pilot plant scale testing is also an essential next stage. Techno-economic analyses taking into account aspects like material costs and operating conditions would illuminate promising candidates for scale-up. Overall, while metal oxides have already displayed excellent potential for propane dehydrogenation, there remains much room for development through fundamental insights and technology translation to make this process more viable at commercial scales.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)是满足日益增长的丙烯需求的一条有吸引力的途径[Placeholder_Of_DOI1]。在研究的催化剂中,诸如Cr2O3,Pt-Sn和Ga2O3之类的金属氧化物表现出了非常有前途的表现。

铬氧化物(Cr2O3)是最广泛研究的PDH金属氧化物催化剂之一。 已经研究了受支持的Cr2O3和非支持的块状Cr2O3 [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]。 Cr2O3的活性高于许多其它金属氧化物,这归因于其还原性能,这使Mars-van Krevelen型机理成为可能 [Placeholder_Of_DOI3]。 用金属(如Pt)掺杂Cr2O3可以进一步提高催化性能 [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]。 然而,失活是个关键问题,通常由PDH条件下催化剂过度还原引起。

双金属Pt-Sn催化剂是PDH中选择性和稳定性最好的选择之一。 Pt-Sn金属间化合物的形成抑制了不希望的加氢裂解和焦炭反应,与仅Pt相比,提高了丙烯选择性和稳定性 [Placeholder_Of_DOI4,Placeholder_Of_DOI5]。 Pt-Sn催化剂已被UOP等公司成功商业化,并在流化床反应器中实施 [Placeholder_Of_DOI5]。 Pt:Sn的比率和制备方法在很大程度上影响所形成合金的结构,这反过来又影响活性和选择性。

氧化镓的多晶体,特别是β-Ga2O3,已经出现为具有与受支持的Pt催化剂媲美的产率的有前途的PDH催化剂 [Placeholder_Of_DOI6]。 催化性能与表面酸碱性质高度相关。 与外露的四面体Ga3+中心相关的强路易斯酸位被提出为丙烷激活和脱氢的活性位点 [Placeholder_Of_DOI7]。 与Cr2O3和Pt基催化剂相比,Ga2O3明显地形成较少的焦炭。 然而,Ga2O3在较高温度下会因相变而失活。 确定稳定特定Ga2O3相和形态的策略仍然是一个持续的研究方向。

虽然金属氧化物在PDH中显示出前景,但稳定性和选择性方面的挑战在工业相关条件下仍然存在。 开发能够协同地结合Pt等金属的高活性和更多可逆氧化还原型氧化物的低结焦倾向的双功能催化剂,可以实现增强的性能。 通过先进的原位光谱学和理论建模深入洞察结构-功能关系及反应机理对引导这些催化剂的合理设计至关重要。 为了以经济和可持续的方式满足丙烯需求,必须不断努力开发金属氧化物的潜力。

综合理解与未来展望: 考虑到对丙烷脱氢金属氧化物催化剂的进展回顾,出现几个有结果的研究轨迹。 开发原位表征技术以探测工作条件下的动态结构变化,可以提供关键的机制见解。 例如,环境压力XPS可以跟踪表面氧化状态,而原位IR可以跟踪表面中间体。 先进的电子显微技术可以识别形态变化。 以这种方式建立基本的理解可以更好地指导设计更稳定和更选择性的催化剂。

一个前景的领域涉及探索协同组合,例如,双功能金属/氧化物催化剂。 可以调节金属功效以获得脱氢活性,而氧化物组分则提供选择性控制。 将这些材料创新转化为流化反应器和试验装置规模的测试也是一个必不可少的下一步。 考虑到诸如材料成本和操作条件等方面,技术经济分析可以阐明具有规模化潜力的有希望的候选材料。 总体而言,虽然金属氧化物已经展示了出色的丙烷脱氢潜力,但是通过基础见解和技术转化来使这一过程在商业规模上更具可行性,仍有很大的发展空间。
