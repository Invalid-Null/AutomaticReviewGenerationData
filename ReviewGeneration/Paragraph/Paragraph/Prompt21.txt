{"Quotes": "[1] The TS-1 zeolites have an average crystal diameter of 100 nm initially and increase by 2, 3, or even 50 times when the synthesis conditions are changed; the largest TS-1 crystals are approximately 5.7 μm. \n         [2] The higher surface area and the existence of hierarchical porosity in smaller TS-1 zeolites result in a significant improvement in catalytic performance.\n         [3] Low resistance to intercrystalline diffusion facilitates the departure of propylene from the active sites, which avoids some further side reactions, such as coking. Hence, the lifetime of smaller TS-1 zeolite-supported PtSn catalysts is much longer than that of the larger samples, as discussed above.", "English": "Yes, the article investigates tuning TS-1 crystal size from 100 nm to 5.7 μm. Smaller size introduces mesoporosity, enhancing diffusion and avoiding coking, significantly improving conversion, selectivity and catalyst lifetime.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2017.05.024"},
