Propylene is an essential raw material in the chemical industry, utilized in the production of a wide range of products including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acetone, and more [Placeholder_of_DOI1, Placeholder_of_DOI2]. Global demand for propylene has been consistently increasing, with an expected rise from 130 megatons in 2019 to 191 megatons by 2030, resulting in a growing supply deficit [Placeholder_of_DOI3]. Conventional production routes via steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking struggle to meet this rising demand due to crude oil supply constraints [Placeholder_of_DOI2]. As such, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a promising technology, exploiting the abundance of propane available from shale gas to produce propylene in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner [Placeholder_of_DOI4, Placeholder_of_DOI5]. Multiple studies highlight the industrial importance of PDH, with one stating it already accounts for 10% of global propylene output [Placeholder_of_DOI3]. However, the endothermic and equilibrium-limited nature of the PDH reaction presents challenges that require continued research and development [Placeholder_of_DOI6].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The reviewed literature establishes propylene as a fundamental building block in the petrochemical industry, with increasing supply unable to match rising demand from polymer and chemical manufacturers. While conventional production routes struggle, propane dehydrogenation has proven commercially viable but requires further optimization and intensification to overcome thermodynamic barriers. Future efforts may focus on novel catalyst formulations and reactor designs that enable operation at higher temperatures or integration with heat recovery to improve energy efficiency. The long-term outlook could explore alternative feedstocks, process intensification strategies, and sustainability metrics to ensure responsible scaling of propylene capacity via PDH.

丙烯是化学工业中重要的原料,用于生产各种产品,包括聚丙烯、丙烯醇、丙烯腈、丙酮等[Placeholder_of_DOI1,Placeholder_of_DOI2]。全球对丙烯的需求持续增加,预计从2019年的1.3亿吨增长到2030年的1.91亿吨,导致供应越来越紧张[Placeholder_of_DOI3]。传统的裂解和催化裂解生产路线难以满足日益增长的需求,因为原油供应受到限制[Placeholder_of_DOI2]。因此,丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为一种有前途的技术出现,它利用丰富的页岩气丙烷生产丙烯,具有成本效益且环保[Placeholder_of_DOI4,Placeholder_of_DOI5]。多项研究强调PDH的工业重要性,其中一篇文章表示PDH已占全球丙烯产量的10% [Placeholder_of_DOI3]。然而,PDH反应的放热和平衡限制性质带来挑战,需要持续的研发[Placeholder_of_DOI6]。

综合理解与未来展望:文献综述确立了丙烯作为石化工业基础化学品的地位,其供应跟不上来自聚合物和化学品生产商的日益增长的需求。尽管常规生产路线面临困难,丙烷脱氢商业上可行,但需要进一步优化和强化以克服热力学障碍。未来的努力可能会关注新型催化剂配方和反应器设计,使其能在更高温度下运行,或与热回收相结合以提高能效。长期展望可能会探索替代原料、工艺强化策略和可持续性指标,以确保通过PDH负责任地扩大丙烯产能。
