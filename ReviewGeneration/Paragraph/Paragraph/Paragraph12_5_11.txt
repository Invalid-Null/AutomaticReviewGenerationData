Based on the details provided in the file, several studies have explored supported mono-metallic Pt, Pd, and Ir catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). 

Pt-based catalysts are reported to be among the most widely used and commercially successful PDH catalysts [Placeholder_Of_DOI21]. For example, Pt/Al2O3 catalysts modified with metal oxide overcoats made by atomic layer deposition were shown to increase PDH yield and selectivity [Placeholder_Of_DOI7]. Ultra-small Pt clusters stabilized inside microporous zeolite supports via strong Pt-O-support bonds also displayed excellent stability during PDH [Placeholder_Of_DOI42]. Adding promoters like boron [Placeholder_Of_DOI43] and sulfur [Placeholder_Of_DOI5] have also been effective strategies to enhance the performance of supported Pt catalysts.

Besides Pt, a few studies have explored supported Pd [Placeholder_Of_DOI17] and Ir [Placeholder_Of_DOI17], noting their good intrinsic activity but high cost compared to Pt. No specific data or insights were provided on supported Pd or Ir catalysts.

In summary, Pt-based catalysts, especially Pt/Al2O3, are identified as the most promising supported metal catalysts for commercial PDH processes. Strategies like metal-support interactions, promoters, and overcoats have shown good potential to further optimize Pt activity, stability and selectivity. More research is warranted to evaluate if supported Pd or Ir catalysts could be viable alternatives.

With Pt/Al2O3 established as an effective platform for PDH, future work should focus on gaining a more fundamental understanding of the active sites, metal-support interfacial effects, and deactivation pathways on these catalysts. Advanced characterization techniques like in-situ spectroscopy and probe molecules could uncover new insights that guide the design of further optimized catalysts. More exploratory work is also needed to discover innovative supports or multi-metallic formulations that stabilize Pt under harsh PDH conditions. Broader adoption of high-throughput methods can accelerate the discovery process. Finally, research efforts should evaluate if greener, more sustainable Pt recovery and recycling processes could make Pt-based PDH catalysts more viable at commercial scales.

根据文件提供的详情,已经有几项研究探索了Pt、Pd和Ir基悬浮金属催化剂用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)。

文献报道Pt基催化剂是最广泛使用和商业上最成功的PDH催化剂[Placeholder_Of_DOI21]。例如,通过原子层沉积法添加金属氧化物涂层可以提高Al2O3担载Pt催化剂的PDH反应收率和选择性[Placeholder_Of_DOI7]。将超小Pt簇稳定在微孔性沸石载体内的Pt-O-support强键合也使PDH过程中催化剂稳定性大幅提高[Placeholder_Of_DOI42]。添加剂如硼[Placeholder_Of_DOI43]和硫[Placeholder_Of_DOI5]也是提升Pt/担体催化剂性能的有效策略。


除Pt外,少数研究探索了担持Pd [Placeholder_Of_DOI17] 和Ir [Placeholder_Of_DOI17] 催化剂,指出它们与Pt相比具有很好的固有活性但价格更高。没有提供担持Pd或Ir催化剂的具体数据或信息。


总的来说, Pt基催化剂,特别是Pt/Al2O3,被认为是商业PDH工艺中最有前景的金属催化剂。金属支撑相互作用、添加剂和涂层等策略在进一步优化Pt的活性、稳定性和选择性方面显示了很好的潜力。更多研究工作有必要评估担持Pd或Ir催化剂是否可以成为可行的替代选择。

随着Pt/Al2O3被确立为有效的PDH平台,未来的工作重点应该放在深入理解这些催化剂的活性位点、金属-载体间界面效应和失活途径上。原位分光和探针分子等先进表征技术可以揭示新的见解来指导更优催化剂的设计。更有探索性的工作也需要去发现创新型载体或多金属配方以稳定Pt,抵抗严酷的PDH条件。高通量方法的更广泛采用可以加快发现过程。最后,研究工作应该评估是否可以通过更绿色、更可持续的Pt回收再生工艺使Pt基PDH催化剂在商业规模上更加可行。
