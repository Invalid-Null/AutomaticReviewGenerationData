Propylene is an essential raw material for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acetone, etc., with an estimated annual market size exceeding $100 billion [Placeholder_Of_DOI]. However, there is a large and growing gap between global propylene supply and demand, as traditional production routes like naphtha cracking struggle to keep pace with rapidly rising consumption [Placeholder_Of_DOI]. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as an attractive and environmentally friendly alternative that can help bridge this deficit by utilizing abundant supplies of low-cost propane from shale gas [Placeholder_Of_DOI]. PDH currently accounts for 10% of global propylene output and has potential for further expansion [Placeholder_Of_DOI].

Several details on the value and applications of propylene are furnished. It is a vital organic feedstock for the petrochemical industry with usage across construction, packaging, and polymer sectors [Placeholder_Of_DOI]. Polypropylene, one of its major derivatives, has versatile functionality spanning plastic products, textiles, flexible films, etc [Placeholder_Of_DOI]. Furthermore, the annual production of propylene has expanded steadily by 6%, underscoring its indispensability [Placeholder_Of_DOI].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Capitalizing on the proliferating supplies of economical shale gas, propane dehydrogenation processes can be further enhanced and popularized to sustainably satisfy the burgeoning global demands for propylene. Advanced catalysts with augmented stability and selectivity need to be developed. Additionally, renewable feedstocks could be explored as alternatives to fossil-based propane. Process intensification techniques can also help improve yields and energy efficiency. Overall, by bridging scientific insights with commercialization endeavors, PDH can cement its foothold as an eminent industrial-scale propylene production pathway.

丙烯是生产各种化学品(如聚丙烯、丙烯醚、丙烯腈、丙酮等)的重要原料,其年市场规模超过1000亿美元[Placeholder_Of_DOI]。然而,全球丙烯供需之间存在巨大的和不断增长的缺口,因为如裂解汽油等统生产途径难以跟上迅速增长的消费[Placeholder_Of_DOI]。丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为一种有吸引力的和环境友好的替代选择,可以通过利用大量廉价的页岩气丙烷来帮助弥合这一缺口[Placeholder_Of_DOI]。PDH目前占全球丙烯产量的10%,并有扩大的潜力[Placeholder_Of_DOI]。

文件中提供了关于丙烯价值和应用的几个详细信息。它是石化行业的一种至关重要的有机原料,在建筑、包装和高分子领域都有应用[Placeholder_Of_DOI]。聚丙烯是其主要衍生物之一,具有应用于各种塑料制品、纺织品、柔性薄膜等的多种功能[Placeholder_Of_DOI]。此外,丙烯的年产量稳步增长6%,突显了其不可替代性[Placeholder_Of_DOI]。
