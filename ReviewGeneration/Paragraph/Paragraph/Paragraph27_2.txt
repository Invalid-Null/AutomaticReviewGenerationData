Based on the detailed analysis from the references provided in the file [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726], X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments, including X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), were performed to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. The experiments were conducted at a synchrotron radiation facility on fresh and spent Co@Si-BEA catalysts. According to the FT-EXAFS and WT-EXAFS spectra of the spent catalyst, there was still a single signal corresponding to the first shell Co-O bond with an almost unchanged coordination environment (CN = 5.7 ± 0.3), confirming that the incorporated Co2+ cations acting as predominant Co active sites were structurally stable against the reaction [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726].

Additional insights into changes in oxidation states were provided by references [10.1021/acscatal.3c00939] and [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728] which showed no X-ray based analysis of oxidation changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Rather, computational modeling and catalyst testing methods were utilized. 

Further evidence of utilizing synchrotron X-ray radiation to probe metal species during propane dehydrogenation was furnished by [10.1002/advs.202207756]. In situ XANES experiments illustrated how Ga species migrate into zeolite pores upon H2 reduction. And quantitative pulse titration verified divalent Ga2O2^2+ as the precursor to active GaHx sites.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, synchrotron radiation sources enable operando and in-situ probing of catalytic systems under actual reaction environments. Building on existing capabilities, future endeavors could incorporate machine learning for automated analysis of vast data streams. And push towards compact X-ray setups interfaced directly with bench-scale reactors in academic laboratories. Broader adoption necessitates standardized protocols and shared data formats. Understanding dynamic transformations in oxidation states and coordination geometries remains vital for rational catalyst design.

基于文件中提供的参考文献[10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726]的详细分析,使用包括XANES和EXAFS在内的X射线吸收光谱技术来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化状态变化。该实验在同步辐射设施上对新鲜和废弃的Co@Si-BEA催化剂进行。根据废弃催化剂的FT-EXAFS和WT-EXAFS图谱,第一个壳层Co-O键信号几乎没有改变(CN = 5.7 ± 0.3),这证明了作为主要Co活性位点的并入Co2+阳离子在结构上对反应稳定[10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726]。  

参考文献[10.1021/acscatal.3c00939]和[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728]提供了有关氧化状态变化的额外见解,它们显示在丙烷脱氢催化过程中没有基于X射线的氧化状态分析。而是利用了计算建模和催化剂测试方法。

参考文献[10.1002/advs.202207756]提供的进一步证据利用了同步辐射X射线来探测金属物种在丙烷脱氢过程中的作用。原位XANES实验阐明了Ga物种如何在H2还原后进入沸石孔。定量脉冲滴定证实二价Ga2O2^2+是活性GaHx位点的前体。

综合理解与未来展望:考虑到文件中讨论的进展和发现,同步辐射源使得原位和在线探测催化剂在实际反应环境下的性能成为可能。在现有功能的基础上,未来的工作可以将机器学习用于自动分析大量的数据流。并推动与学术实验室内的小型反应器直接接口的紧凑X射线设备。更广泛的采用需要标准化的协议和共享的数据格式。理解氧化态和配位几何的动态转变对于合理的催化剂设计仍然至关重要。
