Based on the detailed analysis from the references, DFT calculations have been applied in several studies to gain insights into propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways over different catalysts. 

For example, DFT results revealed that Zn-O-Zn sites in ZnO catalysts possess lower apparent activation barriers (1.81 eV) compared to single Zn2+ sites (2.14 eV), explaining the higher activity of the former [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]. Additionally, calculations showed that electron-rich Pt surfaces have more negative d-band centers, which negatively correlate with propylene selectivity in Pt-based catalysts [Placeholder_Of_DOI2].

Other computational studies demonstrated the utility of microkinetic models built on DFT data to connect the microscopic reaction mechanisms to macroscopic catalytic behavior. By comparing descriptors like intermediate binding energies, scaling relations were identified that capture trends in reactivity/selectivity [Placeholder_Of_DOI3]. DFT has also elucidated initial C-H activation of propane and propylene as kinetically relevant steps over Pt [Placeholder_Of_DOI16].

Furthermore, DFT provided fundamental insights into single-atom Pt catalysts supported on doped graphene/boron nitride for propane dehydrogenation. The calculations indicated tunable effects of the supports in modulating Pt’s performance, by adjusting reaction barriers along the pathway from propane to propene [Placeholder_Of_DOI22].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: DFT calculations have clearly demonstrated their capability in unraveling propane dehydrogenation mechanisms over isolated sites in heterogeneous catalysts. As research endeavors uncover increased complexities in real-world materials, sophisticated multi-scale models that integrate DFT findings could take center stage. For instance, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations informed by DFT may better capture ensemble, spacer and support effects. High-throughput DFT screening coupled with microkinetic analysis can also accelerate identification of novel single-atom and nanocluster catalysts.

根据参考文献的详细分析,DFT计算已经被应用于几项研究中,以期对不同催化剂上的丙烷脱氢机理和路径获得洞察。

例如,DFT结果显示,在ZnO催化剂中,Zn-O-Zn位点的表观激活能垒(1.81 eV)低于单个Zn2+位点(2.14 eV),这解释了前者较高的活性[Placeholder_Of_DOI2]。 此外,计算表明,电子丰富的Pt表面具有更负的d带中心,该中心与Pt基催化剂中的丙烯选择性负相关[Placeholder_Of_DOI2]。

其他计算研究证明,基于DFT数据构建的微观动力学模型可以将微观反应机理与巨观催化行为联系起来。 通过比较诸如中间体结合能之类的描述符,识别了捕获反应性/选择性趋势的缩放关系[Placeholder_Of_DOI3]。 DFT还阐明了丙烷和丙烯的初始C-H激活是Pt上动力学相关的步骤[Placeholder_Of_DOI16]。

此外,DFT为掺杂石墨烯/氮化硼支持的单原子Pt催化剂的丙烷脱氢提供了基本洞察。计算表明支撑体的可调效应通过调整从丙烷到丙烯路径上的反应屏障来调节Pt的性能[Placeholder_Of_DOI22]。

综合理解与未来展望:DFT计算已经清楚地展示了其在揭示异质催化剂中隔离位点上的丙烷脱氢机理中的能力。随着研究工作揭示实际材料中的更高复杂性,整合DFT发现的复杂多尺度模型可能会占据中心地位。例如,动力学Monte Carlo模拟informed by DFT可能更好地捕获集合体,间隔剂和支持效应。 高通量DFT筛选结合微观动力学分析也可以加速识别新的单原子和纳米簇催化剂。
