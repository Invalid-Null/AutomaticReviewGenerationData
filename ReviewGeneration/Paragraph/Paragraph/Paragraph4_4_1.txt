 Here is a draft review section on propane dehydrogenation catalysts, with a focus on thermodynamic limitations and kinetic considerations:

<English>
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process (ΔH298K = 124.3 kJ/mol) that is thermodynamically limited, requiring high temperatures of 500-600°C to achieve reasonable equilibrium conversion [Placeholder_Of_DOI1, Placeholder_Of_DOI2]. The reaction also tends to suffer from rapid catalyst deactivation via coke formation and metal sintering [Placeholder_Of_DOI3]. First principles calculations have provided insights into kinetic factors, with C-H alpha hydrogen abstraction identified as the rate limiting step in some cases [Placeholder_Of_DOI4]. Apparent activation energies ranging from 159-200 kJ/mol have been measured experimentally [Placeholder_Of_DOI5]. 

Introducing oxidants like O2 or CO2 can improve thermodynamic conversion by providing exothermic oxidation reactions, but deactivated metal sites must still be re-oxidized in order to sustain activity [Placeholder_Of_DOI6, Placeholder_Of_DOI7]. Zeolite supports with high surface area and well-defined micropores help disperse and stabilize metal sites, preventing sintering under harsh PDH conditions [Placeholder_Of_DOI8].

Tradeoffs exist between highly active sites that provide reasonable rates but promote undesired cracking/coking vs. selective sites that limit these side reactions [Placeholder_Of_DOI9]. Isolated metal cations anchored to silanol defects appear effective for balancing activity and selectivity [Placeholder_Of_DOI10].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed regarding thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors, future research might explore the use of membrane reactors to overcome equilibrium limitations by continuously removing products. Combined experimental and computational efforts to identify optimized active site geometries could also help mitigate side reactions while maintaining activity.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一个吸热过程(ΔH298K = 124.3 kJ/mol),其在热力学上是有限的,需要500-600°C的高温才能达到合理的平衡转换率[Placeholder_Of_DOI1,Placeholder_Of_DOI2]。该反应还倾向于通过焦炭生成和金属团聚 rapid catalyst deactivation 而快速失活[Placeholder_Of_DOI3]。第一性原理计算提供了关于动力学因素的见解,在某些情况下,C-H α氢抽象被确定为速率限制步骤[Placeholder_Of_DOI4]。实验测量的表观活化能在159-200 kJ/mol范围内[Placeholder_Of_DOI5]。

引入氧化剂如O2或CO2可以通过提供放热氧化反应来改善热力学转换,但必须重新氧化失活的金属位点以维持活性[Placeholder_Of_DOI6,Placeholder_Of_DOI7]。高表面积和明确的微孔的沸石支撑剂有助于金属位点的分散和稳定,防止在严苛的PDH条件下发生团聚[Placeholder_Of_DOI8]。

between highly active sites that provide reasonable rates but promote undesired cracking/coking vs. selective sites that limit these side reactions存在权衡[Placeholder_Of_DOI9]。锚定在硅醇缺陷上的隔离金属阳离子似乎可以在活性和选择性之间取得平衡[Placeholder_Of_DOI10]。

综合理解与未来展望:考虑到关于热力学约束和动力学因素的进展和发现,未来的研究可能会探索使用膜反应器来克服平衡限制,方法是连续移除产品。 结合实验和计算工作以确定优化的活性位点几何结构,也可以帮助减轻副反应而保持活性。
