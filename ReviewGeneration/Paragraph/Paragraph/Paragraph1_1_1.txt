		Propylene is an essential raw material for producing chemicals such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acetone, etc., with an estimated annual market size exceeding $100 billion [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]. However, conventional production routes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking struggle to meet the rapidly rising global demand, which is projected to further grow at 2-3% annually till 2030 [Placeholder_Of_DOI1]. This supply-demand gap can be addressed through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) by utilizing abundant and inexpensive propane feedstocks from shale gas [Placeholder_Of_DOI3], [Placeholder_Of_DOI4]. PDH accounts for 10% of current propylene production and is regarded as an economically and environmentally friendly industrial process [Placeholder_Of_DOI5], [Placeholder_Of_DOI6].
		※※※  
		Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the increasing propylene demand coupled with propane abundance, PDH emerges as a crucial route for boosting propylene supply. Further research could focus on developing robust and selective catalysts that lower the high temperature requirements, enhance propylene yield/selectivity, and augment catalyst longevity via sophisticated characterization techniques and computational modeling. The feasibility of continuous-flow reactors could also be explored to improve heat management and process intensification. Moreover, technoeconomic and life cycle analyses singling out optimal PDH process configurations suited for commercial adoption would be impactful.

		丙烯是生产聚丙烯、丙烯氧化物、丙烯腈、丙酮等化学品的重要原料,其年市场规模估计超过1000亿美元 [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]。然而,传统的裂解和催化裂解生产路线难以满足全球需求的快速增长,预计到2030年将以每年2-3%的速度继续增长[Placeholder_Of_DOI1]。丙烷脱氢(PDH)利用页岩气中丰富廉价的丙烷原料 [Placeholder_Of_DOI3], [Placeholder_Of_DOI4]可以解决这一供需缺口。PDH目前占丙烯生产的10%,被认为是一种经济且环保的工业过程 [Placeholder_Of_DOI5], [Placeholder_Of_DOI6]。
		※※※
		综合理解与未来展望:考虑到丙烯需求的增加和丙烷的丰富性,PDH成为提高丙烯供应的关键途径。进一步的研究可以关注开发稳定选择性高的催化剂,降低高温要求,提高丙烯收率/选择性,并通过精细的表征技术和计算建模增强催化剂的长寿命。连续流反应器的可行性也可以探索,以改善热管理和工艺强化。 此外,确定最佳的PDH 工艺配置以实现商业采用的技术经济性和生命周期分析也会产生重大影响。
