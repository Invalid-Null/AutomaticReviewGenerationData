Propylene is an essential raw material for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, etc., with an estimated annual market value exceeding $100 billion [Placeholder_of_DOI2]. However, there exists a substantial and increasing supply-demand gap, with the global demand for propylene projected to grow at 2-3% annually up to 2030 [Placeholder_of_DOI1]. 

While traditionally sourced as a byproduct from naphtha cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units, these conventional technologies are struggling to meet the burgeoning propylene demand given constraints around crude oil supply [Placeholder_of_DOI1]. In this context, the direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has emerged as an attractive and environmentally-friendly route to increase propylene production by utilizing abundant and inexpensive supplies of propane unlocked by the shale gas boom [Placeholder_of_DOI6, Placeholder_of_DOI9]. The PDH process is already commercialized globally, accounting for approximately 10% of current propylene output [Placeholder_of_DOI15].

With propylene being a vital precursor for major polymers and chemicals [Placeholder_of_DOI3, Placeholder_of_DOI13], coupled with logistic and economic advantages, propane dehydrogenation technologies are poised to claim a greater stronghold in fulfilling the world’s ballooning propylene demands.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Capitalizing on the proliferating supplies of propane and motivation to pursue alternative propylene production pathways, PDH techniques harbinger immense latent to reshape the chemical industry landscape. Future undertakings might expand the PDH knowledge base through heightened computational modeling endeavors, detailed kinetic and mechanistic deconstructions, and sophisticated operando characterization techniques. Moreover, engineering strategies like process intensification could push PDH reactors to hitherto unattained productivity feats. Concurrently, catalytic innovations might birth increasingly active, selective and stable PDH catalysts. Through such multifaceted advancements, PDH could eclipse the supremacy of conventional thermal cracking processes within the next decade.

丙烯是生产各种化学品(如丙烯腈、聚丙烯、丙烯醚等)的重要原料,其年市场价值估计超过1000亿美元 [Placeholder_of_DOI2]。然而,目前丙烯供需之间存在很大的缺口,全球对丙烯的需求预计将以每年2-3%的速度增长,直到2030年 [Placeholder_of_DOI1]。

虽然传统上丙烯是从裂化气和催化裂化装置中作为副产品获得的,但由于原油供应的限制,这些常规技术正在努力满足日益增长的丙烯需求[Placeholder_of_DOI1]。在这种情况下,丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为一种有吸引力的和环境友好的途径,利用页岩气繁荣所带来的丰富廉价的丙烷原料来增加丙烯的产量 [Placeholder_of_DOI6, Placeholder_of_DOI9]。PDH工艺已经在全球范围内商业化,目前约占丙烯总产量的10% [Placeholder_of_DOI15]。

由于丙烯是重要的聚合物和化学品的前体 [Placeholder_of_DOI3, Placeholder_of_DOI13],加之在物流和经济方面的优势,丙烷脱氢技术有望在满足全球快速增长的丙烯需求中占有更大的份额。
