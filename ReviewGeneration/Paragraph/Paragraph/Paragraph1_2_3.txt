Propylene is a crucial chemical feedstock utilized for manufacturing a wide range of products, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acetone, etc. [1] Owing to its versatile applications, propylene commands an estimated market value exceeding $100 billion per annum. [2]  

Traditionally, propylene is obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units in refineries. However, with crude oil reserves dwindling, these conventional technologies are unable to meet the rapidly rising global demand for propylene, which is projected to escalate at 2-3% annually until 2030. [3] 

To bridge this supply-demand gap, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as an attractive route for on-purpose propylene generation by transforming the abundant supplies of propane available from shale gas and LPG sources. [4] By exploiting propane as a feedstock, PDH offers a cost-effective and environmentally friendly pathway for large-scale propylene production to satisfy both current and future industry requirements.

丙烯是一种重要的化学原料,用于生产各种产品,包括聚丙烯、丙烯腈、丙烯醇、丙酮等。[1]由于其多种用途,丙烯的年市场价值估计超过1000亿美元。[2]

传统上,丙烯是从炼油厂中的石脑蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解单元中获得的副产品。但是,随着原油储量的减少,这些传统工艺无法满足全球丙烯需求的快速增长,预计到2030年将以每年2-3%的速度增加。[3]

为了弥合这一供需缺口,丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为从页岩气和液化石油气中获得大量丙烷并转化的一条途径,出现为一种有吸引力的专用丙烯生产途径。[4]通过利用丙烷作为原料,PDH提供了一种成本效益高且对环境友好的方式,可实现大规模的丙烯生产,以满足当前和未来行业的需求。[5]

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The extensive analysis reveals that propylene acts as an essential building block with an array of critical applications across the chemical, polymer, and allied sectors. Propane dehydrogenation has been consistently identified as an economically favorable and scalable technology to address the surging propylene demands in an eco-friendly manner. As the propane feedstock reservoir expands courtesy of augmented shale gas extractions, PDH possesses immense potential to supersede conventional cracking units as the mainstream propylene production pathway. Looking ahead, research endeavors could be directed toward enhancing conversion rates and selectivity, ameliorating catalyst design, and improving reactor configurations to further optimize the PDH process.
