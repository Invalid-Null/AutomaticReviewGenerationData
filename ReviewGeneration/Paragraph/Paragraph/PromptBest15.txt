Based on the details provided in the file, there is no evidence that any of the articles compared the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. 

The articles focused on investigating various supported metal catalysts, including Pt [10.1021/acscatal.3c00548], PtSn [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.09.018, 10.1021/acscatal.7b02264], PtZn [10.1021/acscatal.1c01808], PtGa [10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120731], and Rh [10.1021/acscatal.0c01455] based bimetallic catalysts. Some studies also evaluated metal catalysts supported on zeolites [10.1021/acscatal.9b03527, 10.1021/acscatal.1c01497] and mesoporous materials [10.1021/acscatal.1c01808].

However, none of the articles provided any specific examples, data, or explanations regarding changes in selectivity profiles between metallic and oxidized supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. 

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The available literature on propane dehydrogenation catalysts seems to be heavily focused on investigating bimetallic and alloy systems to improve stability and durability. An opportunity exists to better understand how changes in the oxidation state of the active phase can modulate selectivity, for example by tuning ensemble effects or metal-support interactions. Future studies could systematically evaluate well-defined model catalysts in both reduced and oxidized states to deconvolute such structure-function relationships. Beyond supported metals, emerging catalysts based on single atom sites or carbides also warrant exploration from a selectivity modulation perspective. Overall there is scope for fundamental inquiries to uncover how tailored tuning of geometric and electronic factors can potentially direct selectivity in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

Based on the details provided in the file, none of the articles compared the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Most of the articles focused solely on evaluating various bimetallic catalysts such as PtSn, PtZn, PtGa for propane dehydrogenation, without any insights into how oxidation state impacts selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.1c01808, 10.1021/acscatal.7b02264, 10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120731]. 

A few studies analyzed monometallic Pt or Cr oxide catalysts, again not drawing any comparisons between metallic and oxidized catalyst surfaces [10.1021/acscatal.0c01455, 10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014]. Overall, there seems to be a research gap in understanding how changes in oxidation state modulate selectivity for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts. No specific examples or explanations were provided across the various literature sources furnished.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The lack of insights regarding selectivity modulation between metallic and oxidized propane dehydrogenation catalysts suggests an open area for future exploration. Systematic evaluation of the same active metal across different oxidation states and supports may uncover interesting structure-function relationships to guide rational design. Beyond propane dehydrogenation, expanding this conceptual framework of tuning oxidation state to modulate selectivity could have broad applicability across heterogeneously catalyzed reactions.

The articles focus on investigating various monometallic, bimetallic, and alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, without comparing metallic versus oxidized surfaces in terms of selectivity profiles. Specific examples and explanations of selectivity modulation between metallic and oxidized catalysts are not provided.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The current literature landscape underscores a need to systematically compare and elucidate the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized propane dehydrogenation catalysts. An opportunity exists to apply advanced spectroscopic and theoretical techniques to reveal the underlying structure-function relationships governing selectivity on these distinct surfaces. Discerning these fundamental principles can pave the way for rational catalyst design, enabling precise tuning of product distributions. Moreover, unprecedented catalysts blending metallic and oxidized sites in bifunctional configurations could manifest new synergies and selectivity trends. Exploring such uncharted terrains may uncover novel pathways for enhancing propane conversion selectivity.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The lack of comparative analysis between metallic and oxidized propane dehydrogenation catalysts represents a knowledge gap and opportunity for further research. Future studies could systematically evaluate both catalyst types under identical conditions to elucidate selectivity trends and structure-function relationships. The oxidation state and coordination environment of active sites likely play a key role, so gaining atomic-level insights through advanced characterization techniques combined with computational modeling and microkinetic analysis would be invaluable. Exploring selective oxidation or reduction of bimetallic catalysts could offer a powerful means of tuning selectivity. Ultimately, rational catalyst design guided by fundamental principles could enable optimized PDH catalysts boasting high propylene yield and stability.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The lack of insights comparing metallic versus oxidized propane dehydrogenation catalysts presents an opportunity to address this knowledge gap through systematic studies. By preparing and characterizing supported catalysts with the same metal but different oxidation states, researchers could evaluate how oxidation impacts selectivity, activity, and stability. The findings may reveal useful structure-property relationships and new avenues for tuning selectivity through controlled oxidation. Broader impacts might include expanding fundamental understanding of metal-support interactions in catalysis and enabling more targeted catalyst design.

References [10.1016/j.cej.2014.02.084], [10.1021/acscatal.2c05671], [10.1021/acscatal.2c00642], [10.1021/acscatal.0c01667], [10.1002/anie.201805150], [10.1021/es301323], [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019], [10.1038/s41467-018-07502-5], and [10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.129] also affirmed the lack of metallic versus oxidized selectivity comparisons.

While promising bimetallic PdBi, Ru-P, Pt-Sn, and other alloy catalysts were evaluated, there were no analyses contrasting metallic and oxidized selectivity profiles. As such, there is an opportunity to systematically explore how changes in oxidation states modulate selectivity for PDH reactions over supported metal catalysts.




Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements in bimetallic and Pt-based PDH catalysts revealed in the references, there lies great potential to systematically investigate how changes in metallic versus oxidized states influence selectivity over supported metal catalysts. By modulating oxidation states and fabricating catalysts across a spectrum of metal/metal oxide phases, we can expand our comprehension of structure-function relationships and ensemble effects governing selectivity.
 
Future endeavors may entail crafting model supported catalysts with tunable metallic versus oxidized sites, paired with advanced operando spectroscopic characterization, to illuminate the underpinnings of selectivity control. These fundamental insights could guide rational design of optimized PDH catalysts boasting high propylene yields. Broader horizons might entail extending such phase modulation approaches to other dehydrogenation and oxidation reactions.

The articles analyzed do not compare the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Most studies focus solely on evaluating various metallic or bimetallic catalysts, without investigating differences in selectivity between metallic and oxidized surfaces [10.1021/acscatal.3c00548, 10.1016/j.cej.2014.02.084, 10.1021/acscatal.2c05671, 10.1021/acscatal.2c00642, 10.1021/acscatal.0c01667]. 

For example, one study synthesized PtZn alloy nanoparticles for PDH via co-impregnation of precursors on mesoporous MFI zeolite nanosheets [10.1021/acscatal.1c01808]. While showing outstanding stability, no comparisons were made to oxidized PtZn catalysts. Similarly, multiple works examined bimetallic PtSn catalysts on various supports like titanosilicate TS-1 and boron nitride without contrasting metallic and oxidized states [10.1016/j.jcat.2017.05.024, 10.1016/j.cej.2007.11.009].

Overall, most literature has focused on evaluating promising formulations of metallic PDH catalysts rather than investigating the effects of oxidation state on selectivity profiles. No explanations were provided regarding potential selectivity modulation between metallic and oxidized catalyst surfaces. This represents an area for future research to understand how oxidation impacts product distributions for key reaction systems.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The presented analyses reveal metallic catalysts as predominant in PDH studies, with most efforts targeting improved stability and minimal attention to contrasting metallic versus oxidized selectivity. However, oxidation state can play a key role in modulating active site geometry and electronic properties, impacting catalytic performance. An opportunity exists to systematically evaluate PDH selectivity profiles on tuned model catalysts, correlating oxidation induced changes in catalyst surface properties to product distributions. Such fundamental structure-function insights could guide rational design of improved catalysts exploiting synergies between metallic and oxidized sites to optimize selectivity. Broader horizons may also emerge from extending such concepts to other important dehydrogenation reactions like propane aromatization.

Based on the detailed analysis from the references, there is no comparison provided between metallic and oxidized supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in terms of selectivity profiles. 

The reference [10.1021/acscatal.3c00548] focuses solely on metallic catalysts and does not evaluate oxidized catalysts or compare selectivity.

Additionally, references [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.02.019], [10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005], [10.1016/j.jcat.2011.06.008], [10.1021/acscatal.2c05898], [10.1021/acscatal.1c03146], [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63369-3], [10.1016/j.chempr.2023.07.002], [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.09.016], [10.1016/j.fuproc.2009.07.019], [10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4], [10.1016/j.jcat.2018.09.006], [10.1038/s41467-022-30522-1], [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.008], [10.1016/S1872-2067(23)64402-X] focus solely on either metallic or oxidized catalysts without any comparative analysis. No explanations of selectivity modulation are provided.

In summary, based on the detailed review of all the references cited, there is no evidence showing a comparison between metallic and oxidized propane dehydrogenation catalysts in terms of selectivity profiles or modulation. Most studies focus exclusively on one redox state without cross-examination. Further research could systematically investigate how changing between metallic and oxidized surfaces impacts selectivity over supported metal catalysts.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The analysis reveals a research gap in comparing metallic versus oxidized propane dehydrogenation catalysts to understand selectivity control and modulation. This redox-dependent selectivity relationship has been studied more extensively in other catalytic systems like CO oxidation. Applying similar principles and investigative approaches to propane dehydrogenation could uncover new structure-function insights. For instance, future efforts might systematically tune the oxidation state of active sites or supports to elicit changes in product selectivity. Operando spectroscopic techniques could also track the evolving surface chemistry and relate dynamic structural motifs with selectivity trends. From an application standpoint, improved selectivity control enables enhanced propylene yield and reduced side products. Overall, metallic versus oxidized selectivity modulation represents an promising yet underexplored frontier in propane dehydrogenation that deserves further examination.

Based on the details provided in the file, there is no evidence that any of the articles compared the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Most of the articles focused solely on evaluating various metallic or bimetallic catalysts, without any comparisons to oxidized catalysts. 

Specifically, reference [10.1021/acscatal.3c00548] stated that no such comparison between metallic and oxidized PDH catalysts was made. References [10.1016/j.cej.2014.02.084], [10.1021/acscatal.2c05671], [10.1021/acscatal.2c00642], [10.1021/acscatal.0c01667], [10.1002/anie.201805150], [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019], [10.1038/s41467-018-07502-5], and [10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.129] also clearly indicated that only metallic or bimetallic catalysts were evaluated, without any oxidation state comparisons.

Multiple other references reiterated the lack of metallic versus oxidized selectivity profile comparisons, including [10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c03074], [10.1021/acscatal.2c05042], [10.1002/anie.201507119], [10.1006/jcat.2000.2910], [10.1038/s41929-020-0472-7], [10.1006/jcat.1996.0001], [10.1021/acscatal.1c04092], [10.1016/j.jechem.2021.04.034], [10.1021/acscatal.3c00103], [10.1038/s41565-023-01344-z], [10.1021/jacs.8b05378], [10.1021/acscatal.2c04889], and [10.1021/acscatal.5b01423].

In summary, while the file provided detailed evaluations of various metallic and bimetallic propane dehydrogenation catalysts, there was no evidence of comparisons between metallic and oxidized selectivity profiles.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The lack of insights into how oxidation state impacts PDH catalyst selectivity represents an open opportunity for future research. Comparing metallic, alloy, and oxidized catalysts using consistent supports and conditions could reveal new structure-function relationships. Elucidating how oxidation influences selectivity may inspire innovative catalyst architectures with tuneable oxidation profiles. Studies could also explore correlations between oxidation states and synergistic ensemble/ligand effects. Overall, metallic/oxidized selectivity comparisons remain an underexplored domain holding much promise.
