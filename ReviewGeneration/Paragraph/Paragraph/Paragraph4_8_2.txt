 Here is a draft review section on propane dehydrogenation catalysts with a focus on thermodynamic limitations and kinetic considerations:

		Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic process (ΔH298K = 124.3 kJ/mol) that is thermodynamically limited, requiring high temperatures of 550-650°C to achieve adequate conversion [Placeholder_of_DOI1, Placeholder_of_DOI2]. The reaction equilibrium constrains yields, necessitating optimization of parameters like temperature, pressure, and reactant partial pressures [Placeholder_of_DOI3]. Side reactions like cracking and coking are also thermodynamically favored at high temperatures, leading to catalyst deactivation [Placeholder_of_DOI4]. On metal oxide catalysts, redox cycles between reduced active sites and oxidized resting states introduce additional kinetic complexities [Placeholder_of_DOI5].

		From a kinetics perspective, C-H bond activation is often the rate limiting step, with apparent activation barriers around 180-200 kJ/mol on zeolite catalysts [Placeholder_of_DOI6]. Isolated cationic sites help stabilize transition states and reactive intermediates [Placeholder_of_DOI7]. But this must be balanced against lower barriers for side reactions on more open sites [Placeholder_of_DOI8]. Coke formation tends to be structure-sensitive, requiring adjacent catalytic sites [Placeholder_of_DOI9]. So designing optimal sites remains an ongoing challenge.

		Integrating thermodynamic and kinetic considerations, future PDH catalysts might explore novel supports to modulate active site geometry [Placeholder_of_DOI10], or oxidative reaction schemes to provide exothermic oxidation steps [Placeholder_of_DOI11]. Enhanced computational modeling could also elucidate structure-activity relationships and guide rational design [Placeholder_of_DOI12]. But practical implementation must contend with additional complexity from secondary reactive species. Ultimately, progress relies on deeper mechanistic understanding to navigate inherent thermodynamic and kinetic constraints.

		丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一个放热过程(ΔH298K = 124.3 kJ/mol),受到热力学限制,需要高温(550-650°C)才能达到足够的转化率 [Placeholder_of_DOI1,Placeholder_of_DOI2]。反应平衡限制产率,需要优化如温度、压力和反应物偏压等参数 [Placeholder_of_DOI3]。高温下的副反应如裂化和结焦也更容易发生,导致催化剂失活 [Placeholder_of_DOI4]。在金属氧化物催化剂上,活性部位与氧化态之间的氧化还原循环也增加了附加的动力学复杂性 [Placeholder_of_DOI5]。

		从动力学角度来看,C-H键活化通常是控制速率的步骤,在分子筛催化剂上的表观活化能垒约为180-200 kJ/mol [Placeholder_of_DOI6]。隔离的阳离子部位有助于稳定中间体和过渡态 [Placeholder_of_DOI7]。但是这必须平衡活性位点上副反应较低的能垒 [Placeholder_of_DOI8]。焦炭形成往往依赖结构,需要相邻的催化活性部位 [Placeholder_of_DOI9]。因此设计最佳活性位点仍是一个持续的挑战。

		综合热力学和动力学的考虑,未来PDH催化剂可能会探索新型载体调控活性位点几何结构[Placeholder_of_DOI10],或者氧化反应提供放热氧化步骤[Placeholder_of_DOI11]。增强的计算模型也可以阐明结构-活性关系并指导理性设计[Placeholder_of_DOI12]。但是实际实现必须应对来自次级反应物的额外复杂性。最后,进展依赖于更深入的机制理解来处理固有的热力学和动力学限制。
