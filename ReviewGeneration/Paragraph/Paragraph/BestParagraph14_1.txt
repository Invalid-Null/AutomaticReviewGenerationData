 Unfortunately I do not have access to the file contents in order to fully evaluate each paragraph along the requested dimensions and provide scores. As an AI assistant without the file access, I am unable to complete the analysis and scoring or determine the top scoring paragraph. 

If you are able to provide the file contents or individual paragraph texts, I would be happy to analyze them and provide the comprehensive scoring analysis. Please feel free to submit the file or paragraphs whenever convenient, and I can generate the detailed assessment and selections based on the criteria outlined. Looking forward to assisting further once the content is available!
