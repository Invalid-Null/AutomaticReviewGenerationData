Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - How does alloying Pt with Sn, Ga, Zn affect propane dehydrogenation performance?

Pt-based catalysts have shown exceptional performance for propane dehydrogenation, however monometallic Pt still suffers from issues like fast deactivation. Alloying Pt with secondary metals has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance catalytic properties. 

Several studies have explored the addition of Sn as a promoter for Pt in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Data from [10.1021/acscatal.3c00548] and [10.1016/j.jechem.2017.09.035] demonstrates that incorporating Sn leads to higher propylene selectivity along with improved stability by minimizing coking and over-hydrogenolysis. The Sn modifies the electron density of Pt sites, resulting in selective C-H activation [10.1002/anie.201507119]. XPS characterization as seen in [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.09.018] and [10.1002/anie.201507119] confirms the presence of Pt-Sn alloy formation and electronic interactions.

Investigations on supported Pt-Ga catalysts like 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 [10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120731] report remarkable activity approaching equilibrium conversion even at 450°C. The electron-rich Pt-Ga ensemble helps suppress side reactions and enables operation at lower temperatures [10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.129].

Encapsulated PtZn intermetallic clusters as explored in [10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008] and [10.1021/acscatal.1c04092] demonstrate over 95% propylene selectivity across 520-620°C along with superior long-term stability over 100 hours, attributed to the synergy between isolated single Pt sites and Zn neighbors.

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Propane dehydrogenation continues to be an area of immense interest, with Pt-based bimetallic and alloy catalysts paving the path for next-generation systems. As elucidated based on key findings from the selected articles, tuning the secondary metal and support interactions offers opportunities to tailor selectivity, stability, metal-support interfaces and crystallite ensembles. 

While Sn, Ga, Zn promoted Pt catalysts reveal improved performance, several open-ended questions persist regarding optimization of composition ratios, size effects, designer supports, and so on. Further research might focus on:

- Fundamental studies unraveling mechanistic intricacies directing alloy formation phenomena and interface interactions
- High-throughput computational screening approaches assessing novel promoter metals
- Custom-architecturing multi-modal supports with coordinated confinement and isolation functionalities
- Online spectroscopy techniques enabling operando monitoring of working catalysts
- Machine learning models predicting lifetimes and targeted enhancements  

Purposeful endeavors in these interdisciplinary horizons rooted in the established understanding hold the promise of discovering cutting-edge materials and processes for efficient propane valorization.

Based on the detailed analysis of the references provided, bimetallic and alloy catalysts comprising platinum (Pt) and post-transition metals like tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), zinc (Zn), etc. have shown great promise for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). 

Pt-Sn catalysts are the most widely studied system, with commercial adoption in the Oleflex process by UOP using PtSn/Al2O3 [10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058]. Adding Sn as a promoter helps increase propene selectivity and stability by modifying Pt's electronic properties, ensemble size, and geometry [10.1016/j.jcat.2018.09.006]. An optimal Sn/Pt ratio around 1.5-2 is found before excess Sn decreases activity by blocking sites [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.09.016]. Detailed characterization reveals Pt-Sn phases like Pt3Sn1 and PtSn clusters are the active sites [10.1038/s41467-022-30522-1].

Investigations on supported Pt-Ga catalysts also demonstrate remarkable enhancement versus Pt, with PtGa intermetallics able to suppress side reactions and enable operation near equilibrium conversion [10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120731, 10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.129]. Meanwhile, recent work highlights emerging Pt-Zn systems that approach Pt-Sn performances. Isolated PtZn4 sites in dealuminated zeolite Beta gave exceptional activity, >95% propylene selectivity across 520-620°C [10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008]. Overall, strategic introduction of secondary metals like Sn, Ga, Zn unlocks modulation of Pt's critical attributes - particle size, ensemble requirement, ligand environment, stability and suppresses over-hydrogenation.

Key pathways forward include:

- Systematic optimization of elemental ratios and nanoparticle sizes governed by synthetic techniques [10.1016/S1872-2067(23)64402-X]

- Elucidation of structure-performance correlations connecting isolated sites, nanoclusters, and extended surfaces to catalytic behavior [10.1038/s41467-022-30522-1]

Adding Sn helps suppress hydrogenolysis and coke formation, thereby enhancing selectivity [10.1016/j.cej.2014.02.084, 10.1021/acscatal.3c00548]. Pt-Ga forms highly stable intermetallic compounds, resisting sintering and coking over extended reaction periods [10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058].

		Key structural characteristics influencing propane dehydrogenation performance have been identified. Subnanometric PtSn clusters in MFI zeolite channels give 10 times higher activity than PtSn nanoparticles, attributed to optimized Pt-Sn interactions [10.1021/acscatal.3c00548].

		The appropriate Sn/Pt ratio has also been determined to achieve optimal dehydrogenation activity and propylene selectivity. For PtSn clusters on alumina, Pt/Sn ~ 3 gave moderate turnover frequencies; equal Pt/Sn ratios resulted in negligible activity [10.1021/acscatal.2c05671]. Increasing Sn/Pt from 0 to 1.5 increased propane conversion over PtSn/Al2O3 before excess Sn became detrimental [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.09.016]. These trends confirm computationally predicted volcano-type dependence of rate on Sn content [10.1016/j.jcat.2018.09.006].

		Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The collected insights on bimetallic Pt catalysts highlight promising design paradigms that may stimulate further advancements. Creating isolated single-sites in zeolites, strategic selection of secondary metals, compartmentalizing ultrasmall nanoclusters, and interface engineering with unconventional supports each offer tunable modules to continue optimizing propane dehydrogenation systems. Additionally, operando spectroscopies [10.1038/s41467-022-30522-1] and multi-scale modeling may facilitate fundamental comprehension to inform rational catalyst formulation targeting industrially relevant process intensification. Broader deployment of high-throughput experimentation and data-driven approaches can also accelerate identification of novel compositions and metastable phases with targeted functionality.

Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - How does alloying Pt with Sn, Ga, Zn affect propane dehydrogenation performance?

Several studies have evaluated the effect of alloying platinum with post-transition metals like tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), and zinc (Zn) for improving the performance of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts. 

Pt-Sn alloy catalysts are widely investigated for PDH, with commercial implementations using PtSn/Al2O3 such as the Oleflex process developed by UOP [10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058]. Adding Sn as a promoter is found to increase propene selectivity and stability of Pt catalysts by modifying ensemble and electronic effects. One study on PtSn clusters in MFI zeolite channels showed greatly improved initial activity and stability along with over 95% propylene selectivity [10.1038/s41929-020-0472-7]. The optimal ratio of Pt:Sn is suggested to be around 2-3:1, while equal amounts lead to inactivity [10.1021/acscatal.2c05671]. 

Investigations on supported PtGa nanoparticles also demonstrate increased dispersion and inhibition of coking resulting in higher propylene selectivity versus Pt catalysts [10.1002/anie.202107210, 10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.129]. Isolated PtZn sites stabilized by grafting Zn into the framework of dealuminated zeolite Beta achieved exceptional activity and stability, attributed to single PtZn4-6 sites [10.1021/jacs.1c10261].

In summary, strategic alloying of Pt with promoters like Sn, Ga, and Zn has proven effective for improving catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation via geometric and/or electronic tuning of the active sites. Further targeted explorations may focus on optimizing bimetallic compositions and local environments to unlock the full potential of these multifunctional catalysts.

Based on the detailed analysis of the references cited from the file, the addition of secondary metals such as Sn, Ga, and Zn has been extensively studied to modulate the performance of Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The synthesized understanding stemming from the references suggests that alloying Pt with these metals leads to several beneficial effects that enhance activity, selectivity, and stability.  [10.1021/acscatal.3c00548]※ ※ [10.1016/j.cej.2014.02.084] [10.1021/acscatal.2c05671]

Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - How does alloying Pt with Sn, Ga, Zn affect propane dehydrogenation performance?

Pt-Sn Alloys
    The addition of Sn has been widely shown to improve propene selectivity and catalyst stability during PDH by inhibiting secondary hydrogenolysis and coking reactions. This leads to lower deactivation rates. [10.1002/anie.201507119]※ ※ [10.1016/j.jcat.2018.09.006] Computational and experimental studies suggest Sn incorporation produces a trade-off, improving stability but decreasing initial activity by increasing propane dissociation barriers on Pt sites. An optimal Sn/Pt ratio around 1-1.5 is reported. [10.1021/acscatal.2c05671]
    At the atomic level, Sn modifies the electron density of Pt through ligand effects. The formation of intermetallic Pt-Sn bonding character is noted from XRD, XPS, IR, and theoretical studies. [10.1002/anie.201507119] [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.09.018]※ ※

Pt-Ga Alloys 
    The addition of Ga as a promoter also effectively enhances PDH performance in terms of selectivity, initial activity close to equilibrium levels, and stability. [10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.129] Ga incorporation helps anchor and disperse Pt active sites during reaction conditions, leading to the observed improvements.

Pt-Zn Alloys
    Studies report that embedding isolated Pt atoms within Zn-modified zeolite frameworks leads to remarkable PDH performance in terms of activity, selectivity and stability. This is attributed to site-isolation and uniform single-atom dispersion enabled by the zeolite structure. A Zn/Pt ratio >4 is noted as optimal. [10.1021/jacs.1c10261] Pt-Zn intermetallic alloy nanoparticles also demonstrate high thermal stability and activity.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on:

- Rational design of multi-metallic Pt alloy complexes with precisely tailored atomic configurations for realizing ideal ensemble, ligand and geometric effects during PDH.

- Investigation of novel supports like metal organic frameworks (MOFs) that allow uniform nanoparticle encapsulation and stabilization.

- Operando spectroscopy techniques to gain atomic-level insights into working bimetallic catalysts.

- Machine learning guided catalyst optimization by correlating composition-structure-performance descriptors.

Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - How does alloying Pt with Sn, Ga, Zn affect propane dehydrogenation performance?

Supported PtSn catalysts have been widely studied and utilized commercially for propane dehydrogenation, with the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst successfully commercialized in the Oleflex process by UOP [10.1021/acscatal.3c00816, 10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.058]. Adding Sn as a promoter to Pt catalysts leads to smaller Pt particle size and improves catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity and stability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.09.018, 10.1002/anie.201507119]. The Sn modifier is found to selectively tune the electronic properties of Pt active sites, directing them towards selective C-H bond activation over undesired C-C bond rupture [10.1016/j.jechem.2017.09.035]. This increases propylene selectivity while also minimizing coke formation and subsequent deactivation [10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120731, 10.1021/acscatal.7b02264]. 

Computational and experimental isotope studies reveal that Sn atoms inhibit dehydrogenation events from occurring in contiguous Pt atoms, necessitating appropriately spaced Pt ensembles [10.1021/acscatal.2c01631]. Hence, an optimal Pt:Sn ratio balancing activity and selectivity has been identified around 3:1 [10.1016/j.jechem.2017.09.035, 10.1016/j.jcat.2020.09.016]. At lower Pt:Sn ratios, the electronic modification is prominent but excess Sn poisoning prevails, whereas insufficient Sn leads to uninhibited Pt sites that drive cracking and coking reactions. 

Apart from Sn, alloying Pt with promoters like Ga and Zn has also shown promise for propane dehydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.3c00816, 10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008]. Similar to Sn, Ga and Zn modifiers steer Pt sites towards selective dehydrogenation while suppressing side reactions. The geometric and electronic perturbations engendered by the secondary metals hinder polyatomic hydrocarbon activation, minimizing overcracking and coke deposition [10.1021/acscatal.2c01631]. This manifests as enhanced stability and propylene selectivity [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.008, 10.1021/jacs.1c10261].

Furthermore, alloying induces a contraction in the Pt ensemble size by isolating individual atoms [10.1021/jacs.1c10261, 10.1021/acscatal.1c01808]. This reduction in contiguous Pt sites curbs the incidence of dehydrogenation, restricting consecutive C-H activations and thus improving selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.2c05042]. XAS and STEM-HAADF characterization confirm the presence of isolated Pt atoms coordinated by the secondary metals like Zn and stabilized as PtZn4-6 sites upon alloy formation [10.1021/acscatal.2c01631, 10.1021/jacs.1c10261].

In summary, alloying Pt with promoters like Sn, Ga and Zn in supported metal nanoparticles induces electronic and geometric alterations to Pt active sites that direct them towards selective propane dehydrogenation while minimizing cracking and coking reactions. This increases propylene selectivity and enhances catalyst stability. An optimal ratio balancing activity and selectivity exists around Pt:M = 3:1. The alloy structure also isolates Pt atoms, reducing ensemble size which further improves selectivity.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements in elucidating the synergistic promotional effects induced by alloying Pt with secondary metals, future research could utilize this knowledge to design optimal combinations and spatial distributions of isolated Pt sites exhibiting targeted selectivity. For instance, recent progress in site-specific immobilization of single atoms and clusters shows promise in rationally organizing isolated Pt sites [10.1038/s41467-018-06967-8, 10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4]. Furthermore, the paradigm of strain and ligand engineering could be extended to modulate and enhance Pt-M intermetallic bonding in surface anchored particles [10.1021/acscatal.2c04889], going beyond bulk thermodynamic configurations. Perturbing and fine-tuning the Pt d-band center utilizing proximal adatoms may allow activating specific reaction channels. Exploring these aspects by converging computational and in-situ spectroscopy would uncover structure-activity insights guiding next-generation propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - How does alloying Pt with Sn, Ga, Zn affect propane dehydrogenation performance?

Pt-based catalysts have been widely studied for propane dehydrogenation, but suffer limitations of activity, selectivity and stability. Alloying Pt with promoters like Sn, Ga and Zn has emerged as an effective strategy to tune the catalytic performance. This approach modulates geometric and/or electronic properties of Pt active sites. 

Several studies have explored supported PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.3c00548, 10.1016/j.cej.2014.02.084, 10.1021/acscatal.2c05671]. Adding Sn serves to decrease Pt nanoparticle size and improve dispersion, enhancing stability by suppressing deactivation from coking or sintering. Sn addition also alters selectivity by inhibiting hydrogenolysis/cracking reactions. Optimal Sn content exists around Sn/Pt ~ 1-1.5 atomic ratio. Excess Sn poisoned active sites, reducing activity. Characterization suggests Pt3Sn1 or Pt2Sn1 nanoalloys are active phases. 

Investigations on PtZn catalysts also demonstrated improved stability and conversion approaching equilibrium limits by isolating Pt atoms within Zn cation nests in dealuminated zeolite beta [10.1021/jacs.1c10261]. Zn helped anchor and disperse Pt atoms while proximity modulated activity. A Zn/Pt ratio > 4 maintained optimal performance. Similar effects arose for PtZn intermetallic nanoparticles supported on hierarchical MFI zeolite [10.1021/acscatal.1c01808].  

Likewise, PtGa catalysts achieved extremely high selectivity (>95%) over a wide 520-620°C range as single-site PtZn4 ensembles [10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008]. GaPt alloys formed in mesoporous silica also gave remarkable productivity up to 45.9% propane conversion and 92.1% propylene selectivity at 600°C [10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.129].

Overall, strategic incorporation of secondary metals like Sn, Zn and Ga in the vicinity of Pt serves to modulate geometric and electronic properties of Pt active sites. This augmentations in catalyst design enable significant enhancements in activity, selectivity and stability - addressing key limitations that impede advancement of Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Further explorations can focus on expanding the spectrum of secondary metals studied, engineering novel supports to optimize proximity effects, and developing in-depth mechanistic comprehension of how catalytic behavior transforms based on nanoscale architectures induced after Pt alloying.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on:

1) Single-atom alloy catalysts (SAACs) - With precise synthetic techniques maturing, investigating isolated Pt atoms decorated with individual Sn/Ga/Zn atoms in defined configurations could offer ultimate control over the active site. This can help bridge knowledge gaps between single atoms vs nanoparticles.

2) Multimetallic combinations - While significant insights exist for PtSn, PtZn and PtGa systems, examining unexplored M1-M2-Pt (M = metal) combinations using high-throughput computational screening may reveal unexpected synergistic combinations and help expand the frontier. 

3) Operando spectroscopy - Advancing in-situ/operando XAS, NMR, IR and other characterization tools to track real-time changes in Pt alloy catalysts during propane dehydrogenation can help advance mechanistic comprehension and guide rational improvements.

4) Machine learning - Applying modern data science approaches like neural networks over the vast literature on Pt alloy catalysts could uncover hidden correlations and inform predictive catalyst design rules not intuitively evident through standard analysis.

Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - How does alloying Pt with Sn, Ga, Zn affect propane dehydrogenation performance?

Pt-based catalysts have been extensively studied for propane dehydrogenation due to their high activity arising from excellent activation of C-H bonds [10.1021/acscatal.3c00548]. However, monometallic Pt catalysts suffer from issues like fast deactivation and lower selectivity. Alloying Pt with promotors like Sn, Ga, Zn has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance.

Multiple studies have demonstrated that adding Sn as a promoter increases the propene selectivity and enhances the stability of Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation [[10.1016/j.cej.2014.02.084]], [[10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120731]]. The improved selectivity stems from Sn altering the electronic properties of Pt that promote selective C-H bond activation over undesired C-C bond rupture [10.1002/anie.201507119]. Additionally, Sn helps minimize coke formation, attributed to a "drain-off" effect where Sn sites capture coke precursors and prevent deposition on Pt sites causing deactivation [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.09.018]. Investigations on supported PtSn nanoparticles reveal intermetallic Pt-Sn phases are critical to achieve high propylene selectivity along with stability [10.1126/science.abg7894].

Likewise, studies on Pt-Ga bimetallic catalysts demonstrate increased stability and propylene selectivity versus monometallic Pt. The Pt-Ga structure is proposed to suppress side reactions like coke formation and secondary hydrogenolysis that lower selectivity [10.1002/anie.202107210]. Highly active and selective Pt-Ga catalysts with PtGa intermetallic nanoparticles have been synthesized using strategies like encapsulating PtGa sites in zeolites [10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.129].

Alloying Pt with Zn has also shown promise, where isolated Pt stabilized by neighbouring Zn atoms in the lattice of zeolite Beta achieved remarkable durability along with near equilibrium conversion for propane dehydrogenation [10.1021/jacs.1c10261]. Computational modelling indicates Zn selectively modifies the valence orbitals of Pt to promote selective dehydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.3c00103].

In summary, alloying Pt with secondary metals like Sn, Ga, Zn helps minimize the size of Pt ensembles while modifying geometric and electronic properties. This leads to enhanced selectivity and stability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements made in developing highly selective and stable Pt alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, further optimization can be targeted in aspects like economical usage of noble metals and operational simplicity. As greater mechanistic clarity is attained on the role of various promoters, future endeavors may focus on designing simplified single-site catalysts with isolated Pt sites coordinated by promoters. Machine learning techniques coupled with combinatorial high-throughput experiments also offer opportunities to rapidly screen and discover novel bimetallic formulations. Translation of fundamental advances to pilot-scale reactors can pave the path for wider commercial adoption. Broader implications lie in adapting these design strategies to produce value-added chemicals like light olefins from other alkanes.

Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - How does alloying Pt with Sn, Ga, Zn affect propane dehydrogenation performance?

Several studies have evaluated the effects of alloying platinum with post-transition metals like tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), and zinc (Zn) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysis. Key findings on how these promoters influence Pt catalytic performance are summarized below:

Pt-Sn Alloy Catalysts
- Alloying Pt with Sn leads to higher initial activity, propylene selectivity and stability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.3c00548, 10.1016/j.cej.2014.02.084]. 
- The improved performance is attributed to smaller Pt ensemble size and increased electron density on Pt through electronic effects with Sn [10.1002/anie.201507119].
- Excess Sn can suppress activity, and an optimal Pt:Sn ratio around 2:1 to 3:1 maintains good catalytic performance [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.09.016, 10.1021/acscatal.2c05671].
- Pt3Sn is considered an active phase, while 1:1 Pt:Sn ratios lead to inactivity [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.09.016, 10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008].

Pt-Ga Alloy Catalysts  
- Ga addition to Pt also increases propylene selectivity and stability over Pt. GaPt bimetallics lower ensemble size and inhibit side reactions [10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.129, 10.1002/anie.202107210].
- A GaPt@S-1 catalyst achieved 92.1% propene selectivity and 45.9% propane conversion at 600°C [10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.129].

Pt-Zn Alloy Catalysts
- PtZn intermetallic clusters in zeolites give high PDH activity (up to 17 molC3H6/molPt/s) and stability. Ordered PtZn structure reduces ensemble size [10.1021/acscatal.1c04092, 10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008].
- Isolating Pt atoms entirely within Zn sites in dealuminated Beta zeolite led to exceptional PDH performance [10.1021/jacs.1c10261].

In summary, alloying Pt with Sn, Ga and Zn has shown great promise to enhance PDH catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability compared to monometallic Pt. Key promotional effects arise from smaller ensemble size and ligand effects altering the geometric and electronic properties of Pt active sites.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The covered studies have systematically elucidated how introduction of secondary metals like Sn, Ga and Zn modulates propane dehydrogenation performance over Pt catalysts via electronic and geometric alterations. While significant advancements have been made, additional research endeavors might expand beyond binary Pt alloys and further optimize the composition and architecture of multi-metallic PDH catalysts by:

- Screening ternary alloy compositions like Pt-Sn-Zn to combine favorable traits of individual promoters
- Exploring confinement of ultra-small Pt alloy clusters in selective microporous architectures 
- Fundamental DFT-guided studies of defined Pt alloy surfaces to offer atomistic insights intooptimized active site requirements for selective alkane dehydrogenation

Such undertaken efforts rooted in established principles stand to uncover innovative multi-metallic PDH catalyst designs directed at overcoming equilibrium barriers.
