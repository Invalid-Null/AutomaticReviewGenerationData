Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic catalytic process that produces propylene, an essential feedstock for the production of polypropylene plastics. However, conventional PDH catalysts often suffer from rapid deactivation caused by sintering of metal nanoparticles, coke deposition, or strong metal-support interactions. Encapsulating metal species within the microporous framework of zeolites has recently emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the stability of PDH catalysts by preventing agglomeration and preserving the valence state of active sites. 

As demonstrated in the comprehensive file, zeolite encapsulation strategies have been successfully implemented across various metal and zeolite compositions for stabilizing PDH performance. One notable recent example is the encapsulation of subnanometric PtZn clusters within purely siliceous MFI (ZSM-5) zeolite achieved via a direct hydrothermal synthesis method [DOI1]. In situ and ex situ characterization revealed the isolated PtZn clusters are precisely situated within the 10-ring channels of ZSM-5. Compared to conventional supported catalysts which underwent severe deactivation, the zeolite-encapsulated PtZn clusters exhibited remarkably high catalytic stability with nearly 100% propylene selectivity and an ultralow deactivation rate of 0.02 h-1 over 70 hours time-on-stream PDH [DOI1]. The exceptional stability is attributed to the confinement effect provided by the zeolite, limiting metal mobility and preventing the growth of large aggregates. 

Beyond cluster encapsulation, recent work has also stabilized single Pt atoms for PDH by heteroatom doping of the zeolite framework. Anchoring isolated Pt atoms to lattice defects such as Fe sites in silicalite-1 produced a catalyst achieving nearly 100% propane conversion for 72 hours without deactivation [DOI2]. The anchored single-atom configuration resisted sintering even after redox treatments up to 800°C. In both the cluster and single-atom cases, strategically controlling the local coordination environment of active species through zeolite encapsulation significantly bolsters stability.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Capitalizing on recent advancements, the microenvironment engineering afforded by zeolites and related microporous crystals opens exciting opportunities to develop increasingly stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and other industrially-relevant processes. As alluded to in the references analyzed, zeolite encapsulation provides a precisely tunable platform to lock desired active site configurations via hydrothermal synthesis or post-treatment anchoring. Knowledge accrued from the coordination chemistry of open metal sites and lattice defects could guide the rational design of customized zeolite architectures to act as stability-enhancing hosts. An intriguing research direction might entail extending current strategies focused chiefly on noble metals like Pt to Earth-abundant alternatives using first-principles computations coupled with zeolite crystal engineering. Overall, by offering an adaptable materials canvas to immobilize highly dispersed species, metal-zeolite composites should remain at the forefront of developing resilient catalytic technologies benefitting chemical manufacturing and energy sustainability.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种促使丙烷转化为丙烯的端othermic催化过程,丙烯是生产聚丙烯塑料的必需原料。然而,常规的PDH催化剂通常会由于金属纳米粒子的烧结、焦炭沉积或强烈的金属支撑相互作用而迅速失活。近来,将金属种封装于分子筛的微孔结构中被证明是增强PDH催化剂稳定性的有前景的方法,它可以防止团聚并维持活性位点的价态。

如详尽的文件所示,分子筛封装策略已成功地应用于各种金属和分子筛的组合中,以稳定PDH的性能。一个值得关注的最新例子是通过直接水热合成方法将亚纳米PtZn簇封装在纯硅质MFI(ZSM-5)分子筛中[DOI1]。原位和离位表征揭示了隔离的PtZn簇精确地位于ZSM-5的10环通道中。与常规的受支撑的催化剂相比,在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出明显的失活,分子筛包埋的PtZn簇表现出显着的高催化稳定性,近乎100%的丙烯选择性和0.02 h-1的超低失活率,在线时间超过70小时[DOI1]。异常的稳定性归因于分子筛的限制作用,限制了金属的运动性并防止了大团聚体的生长。

除了簇的封装外,最近的工作还通过杂原子掺杂分子筛框架来稳定单一Pt原子以进行PDH。将单个Pt原子锚定在类硅酸盐-1之类的晶格缺陷点上,产生了一个催化剂,在72小时内实现近乎100%的丙烷转化,没有出现失活[DOI2]。即使在高达800°C的氧化还原处理下,锚定的单原子配置也能抵御烧结。无论是在簇还是单原子的情况下,通过分子筛包埋有选择性地控制活性种的局部配位环境可以显著增强稳定性。

综合理解和未来展望: 借鉴最近的进展,分子筛和相关的微孔晶体提供的微环境工程为开发更加稳定和选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂以及其他工业相关过程打开了激动人心的机会。正如所分析的参考文献所暗示的,分子筛包埋提供了一个可精确调节的平台,通过水热合成或后处理锚定来锁定所需的活性位点配置。从开放金属位点和晶格缺陷的配位化学所积累的知识可以指导设计定制的分子筛体系,以提高稳定性。一个有趣的研究方向可能涉及将当前主要针对贵金属(如铂)的策略扩展到丰富的地壳金属,这可以通过第一性原理计算与分子筛晶体工程相结合来实现。总的来说,通过提供一个可适应的材料画布来固定高度分散的种类,金属-分子筛复合体应该继续引领发展韧性催化技术的最前沿,这将有利于化学制造和能源可持续性。
