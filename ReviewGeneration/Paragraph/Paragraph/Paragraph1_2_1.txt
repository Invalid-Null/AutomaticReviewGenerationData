Propylene is an essential raw material for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acetone, etc., with an estimated annual market size exceeding $100 billion [DOI1]. However, there is a growing gap between global propylene supply and demand, which is projected to steadily rise at 2-3% annually up to 2030 [DOI2]. Traditional production routes like steam cracking of naphtha cannot keep pace due to crude oil depletion. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a promising technology by exploiting abundant and low-cost supplies of propane from shale gas and natural gas liquids [DOI3]. PDH currently accounts for 10% of global propylene output [DOI4]. Being an equilibrium-limited endothermic reaction requiring high temperatures around 500-600°C, developing improved PDH catalysts and processes is an active area of innovation [DOI5].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the increasing demand and supply constraints for propylene via conventional routes, PDH technologies will likely continue to expand as a major pathway for on-purpose propylene production. This creates opportunities to develop more active, selective and stable PDH catalysts, as well as advanced reactor and process designs, to improve efficiency and economics. The growth of bio-based propane supplies might also incentivize further PDH adoption. Broader use of propylene beyond commodity chemicals, in advanced or specialty materials, could also spur further PDH development.

丙烯是生产各种化学品(如丙烯酸、聚丙烯、丙烯醚、丙烯腈、丙酮等)的重要原料,其年市场规模估计超过1000亿美元[DOI1]。然而,全球丙烯供需间存在着日益扩大的缺口,预计到2030年,其需求年均增速将达到2-3% [DOI2]。由于原油枯竭,从蒸汽裂解石脑油等传统生产途径已经跟不上这一增长需求。利用页岩气中丰富廉价的丙烷为原料进行丙烷脱氢(PDH)已成为一种有前景的新技术,PDH当前占全球丙烯产量的10% [DOI3, DOI4]。PDH属于一个需要高温(500-600°C)、热力学限制的放热反应,开发改进PDH催化剂和工艺是当前的研究热点 [DOI5]。

综合理解与未来展望:考虑到丙烯通过常规途径的日益增长的需求和供应上的限制,PDH技术在专为生产丙烯的途径中很可能继续扩大。这为开发更加活性、选择性和稳定的PDH催化剂,以及先进的反应器和工艺设计提供了机遇,以提高效率和经济性。 生物丙烷供应的增长也可能激励进一步采用PDH。 丙烯在先进材料或专用材料中的更广泛应用也可能刺激PDH的进一步发展。
