Based on the details provided in the file, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, the Co@Si-BEA catalysts with cobalt loadings from 0.1-5 wt% were prepared by vacuum impregnation, and the 0.1-0.5 wt% samples showed the best dispersion with highest intrinsic activity due to isolated Co2+ sites [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726]. Dealuminated Co@Si-BEA also produced less graphitic coke than non-dealuminated Co@BEA, indicating better dispersion [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726].

In summary, techniques like controlled impregnation loading, dealumination, and framework substitution are studied for optimizing cobalt dispersion and limiting undesirable coke formation during propane dehydrogenation over Co@BEA catalysts. Further research could explore extending these synthesis principles to other catalytic systems and leveraging advanced characterization methods to gain deeper insight into active phase stabilization.

根据文件提供的详细信息,该文章研究了优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。具体而言,使用真空浸渍法制备的Co@Si-BEA催化剂的钴负载量为0.1-5 wt%,0.1-0.5 wt%的样品由于隔离的Co2+位点显示出最佳的分散和最高的固有活性[10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726]。脱铝Co@Si-BEA也比非脱铝Co@BEA产生更少的图形焦炭,表明更好的分散[10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726]。

总之,通过控制浸渍负载量、脱铝和框架替换等技术来优化钴的分散和限制丙烷脱氢过程中不desired的焦化被研究。进一步的研究可以探索将这些合成原理扩展到其他催化系统,并利用先进的表征方法深入了解活性相稳定化。
