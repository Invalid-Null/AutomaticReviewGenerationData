Based on the details extracted from the references, there is evidence showing how properties like metal particle size, shape, support interactions, and pretreatment conditions influence the catalytic performance of supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

Specifically, reference [10.1016/j.apcatb.2012.11.005] reveals that a Pt/SBA-15 catalyst prepared by deposition-precipitation has much smaller Pt particles compared to one prepared by wet impregnation. The smaller Pt particles lead to higher initial conversion and propylene selectivity, although deactivation occurs due to coke formation. Reference [10.1021/acscatal.0c03391] demonstrates that depositing uniform, nanoscale Al2O3 overcoat layers on Pt nanoparticles by ALD enhances stability and selectivity by suppressing sintering and limiting formation of less selective sites during steam regeneration. An optimal coating thickness of 6-8 Å after 5-7 ALD cycles is identified. 

In terms of shape effects, reference [10.1021/acscatal.0c03381] calculates that under-coordinated Pt(211) sites dominate the reactivity over close-packed Pt(111) terrace sites, despite having lower surface area. This exemplifies the significant influence of surface structure on catalytic behavior. Additionally, reference [10.1021/jacs.6b08705] shows the reaction pathway and key intermediates involved during PDH on Pt(111), providing mechanistic insights.

Regarding metal-support interactions, reference [10.1016/j.jechem.2021.10.008] demonstrates strong interactions between Pt and boron nitride after high temperature pretreatments. This causes partial encapsulation of Pt particles by boron oxide overlayers, which constrains particle size, blocks unselective sites, and enhances stability. Similarly, reference [10.1038/s41929-023-00968-7] stabilizes ultra-small Pt clusters in 14-membered ring zeolite pores via Pt-O-Ge linkages. This tailored metal-support interaction provides outstanding PDH performance.

In summary, strategic modulation of properties like particle size, shape, metal-support interfaces and pretreatment conditions allows control over the abundance and accessibility of selective sites, enabling optimization of supported metal catalysts for targeted PDH conversion and propylene selectivity.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The findings reveal promising opportunities to advance PDH catalysis by engineering multifunctional supported metal systems. For instance, synergy between shaped metal nanoparticles and hierarchically porous supports could combine stability from overcoat layers with accessibility to tunable active sites. Stabilizing isolated metal atoms or ultra-small clusters in ordered frameworks is also a pioneering direction. Operando spectroscopy techniques will likely play an integral role in unraveling dynamic structure-performance interrelationships under working conditions. Furthermore, machine learning models trained on extensive datasets could rapidly predict optimal compositions and pretreatments for targeted applications. In summary, by elucidating fundamental principles governing activity and selectivity, then implementing those guidelines through precisely tailored synthesis methods, significant enhancements in productivity and sustainability are attainable.

Based on the details provided in the file, most of the articles do not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. 

A few articles provide some relevant insights. Reference [10.1016/j.jechem.2021.10.008] shows that calcination and reduction treatments of Pt/BN catalysts cause partial encapsulation of Pt particles by BOx overlayers. This constrains the Pt particle size, suppresses side reactions, and improves selectivity. The BOx overlayers also inhibit Pt sintering during reaction-regeneration cycles.

Reference [10.1021/acscatal.2c01631] utilizes HAADF-STEM imaging to demonstrate that ultra-small Pt species down to single atoms are stabilized on a zeolite support even after pretreatment and reaction. This ultra-high Pt dispersion contributes to high propane dehydrogenation activity. EXAFS data also suggests changes in Pt coordination during reaction, indicating metal-support interactions.

Additionally, reference [10.1021/acscatal.2c05671] theoretically investigates how increasing cluster size and Sn content affect the stability and activity of supported PtxSny clusters. Results show Sn addition enhances stability, but increasing size and Sn content reduce activity by increasing barriers and destabilizing intermediates.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The few articles providing insights on structure-function relationships indicate stabilizing ultra-small, highly dispersed Pt species through metal-support interactions is crucial for achieving both high activity and selectivity. Constraining sites and ensemble sizes is also critical. However, most studies still do not thoroughly characterize or optimize key catalyst properties. Future research should focus more systematically on tuning metal nanoparticle size, composition, shape and support effects to advance the fundamental understanding and performance of propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Operando spectroscopy and microscopy techniques combined with computational modeling will likely play an important role. There are also opportunities to explore more Earth-abundant alternatives to precious metal catalysts by applying these structure-function optimization principles.

※※※ 
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The few examples provided on modulating metal particle size, metal-support interactions, overcoat layers, and ultra-small metal domains offer promising pathways for designing improved supported metal catalysts. Building on these concepts, future research could focus on achieving precise control over metal cluster sizes and compositions, engineering specific support interfaces, and developing novel synthetic techniques to isolate highly active sites. Advanced operando characterization methods to probe surface transformations may also reveal new structure-function activity relationships. There is ample potential to make further strides in this area by bringing together knowledge from various catalysis and nanomaterials fields.

Based on the details provided in the file, there is limited investigation into how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). 

A few studies reveal some structure-function relationships. One shows stabilizing Pt clusters on Sn sites in a zeolite leads to small, highly dispersed Pt particles that are resistant to sintering, improving catalytic performance [10.1021/acscatal.9b03527]. Another demonstrates adding Sn to supported Rh catalysts greatly enhances propane conversion and propylene selectivity [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.09.016]. Additionally, increasing the P content in Ru nanoparticles is found to reduce the Ru ensemble size, lowering hydrogenolysis rates and improving selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.0c01667].

More broadly, some works state that Pt nanoparticle size and structure impact activity, selectivity and stability for PDH over Pt catalysts [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7]. And computational studies on PtxSny clusters indicate increasing size and Sn content reduce turnover rates by increasing reaction barriers and destabilizing intermediates [10.1021/acscatal.2c05671].

Overall however, most studies do not systematically investigate these structure-function relationships. As many works state, detailed analysis of how metal particle properties influence supported metal catalyst performance for PDH is lacking [10.1021/acscatal.9b05063, 10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.037, 10.1016/S1872-2067(18)63202-4, 10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.033, 10.1006/jcat.1994.1333]. Going forward, this is an area requiring further elucidation through targeted synthesis and characterization. Advancing fundamental knowledge of these structure-activity descriptors will be key to designing optimized PDH catalysts.

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the insights disclosed, an opportunity exists to more comprehensively explore how tailoring fundamental metal nanoparticle attributes shapes PDH performance over supported metal catalysts. While initial studies reveal isolated metal sites and small, stabilized particles can enhance selectivity, many knowledge gaps persist. Future efforts might entail adopting cutting-edge characterization techniques alongside controlled synthesis methods to systematically tune properties like size, composition and metal-support interfaces. Building predictive models connecting intrinsic traits like coordination numbers and ensemble effects to catalytic behavior could offer guiding design principles. And operando spectroscopic probes during PDH could elucidate transformation mechanisms. Such pursuits can unravel multifaceted structure-function synergies governing selectivity, activity and stability.

Based on the details provided in the file, there is limited investigation into how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) across the various studies. 

However, some key insights are revealed in select articles:

The article with DOI 10.1016/j.apcatb.2012.11.005 [10.1016/j.apcatb.2012.11.005] shows that a Pt/SBA-15 catalyst prepared by deposition-precipitation has much smaller Pt particles than one prepared by wet impregnation. This impacts activity and selectivity, with the smaller Pt particles giving better performance.

Another study with DOI 10.1021/acscatal.0c03391 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03391] demonstrates that applying ultrathin Al2O3 overcoatings to Pt nanoparticles helps stabilize them against sintering during PDH reactions and regeneration. Increasing the number of ALD cycles gives more stable Pt particles and improves propylene selectivity.

Work in DOI 10.1038/s41929-023-00968-7 [10.1038/s41929-023-00968-7] revealed that confining sub-nanometric Pt clusters within the micropores of a Ge-UTL zeolite support provides exceptional PDH activity and stability. The location and Pt-support interactions are critical in this case.

Beyond particle size effects, research with DOI 10.1021/acscatal.0c01667 [10.1021/acscatal.0c01667] showed that modulating ensemble size by alloying Ru with P helped isolate individual Ru sites and dramatically increased propylene selectivity to 91% compared to pure Ru.

While these works provide some structure-function insights, most studies did not thoroughly investigate effects of metal particle properties or support interactions. Further research is still needed to better understand these structure-activity relationships. Key opportunities include exploring novel synthesis methods to control size and isolation of active sites, applying state-of-the-art imaging techniques, and using advanced theory and simulations to model critical descriptors.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The scattered insights disclosed within the various articles highlight the potential impact of modulating metal particle size, composition, shape and support effects on propane dehydrogenation performance. However, most works did not conduct systematic investigations of structure-function relationships. This presents an opportunity for future research to more rigorously characterize supported metal catalysts using multi-modal analyses, while also leveraging computational modeling and multivariate optimization strategies. Such efforts can accelerate identification of active site descriptors and targeted development of optimized PDH catalysts boasting maximized propylene production.

Based on the details provided in the file, most of the articles do not specifically investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. 

However, a few articles do reveal some pertinent structure-function relationships:

The article with DOI [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7] states that Pt nanoparticle size and structure greatly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanism of propane dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts. Specifically, small Pt particles with (211)-dominating crystal planes have lower dehydrogenation energy barriers and higher activity, while large Pt particles with (111) planes have higher energy barriers. 

The article [10.1021/acscatal.0c03391] shows increasing Al2O3 ALD cycles leads to more stable Pt nanoparticles and higher propylene selectivity on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, with optimal results after 5-7 ALD cycles giving a 6-8 Å Al2O3 coating. This demonstrates improved performance from controlled metal-support interactions.

The article [10.1021/acscatal.9b05548] investigates how properties like impregnation sequence and boron loading affect coke formation and activity of the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Adding boron before platinum reduced coke more than after. Increasing boron loading from 0.5 wt% to 1.5 wt% decreased coke formation.

The article [10.1021/acscatal.2c05671] shows NiMo/Al2O3 with 15-20 nm NiMo alloy nanoparticles exhibits better selectivity than Pt/Al2O3 with ~2 nm Pt nanoparticles, suggesting alloy formation and optimized particle size improve selectivity.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The articles reveal metal nanoparticle size, shape, composition, and interactions with the support can strongly impact propane dehydrogenation performance. Ultra-small single Pt atoms or tiny clusters exhibit high selectivity, while appropriately sized intermetallic nanoparticles resist deactivation. Control of metal-support interactions through over-coatings or dopants inhibits sintering. Further studies could explore stabilizing additional ultra-small metal ensembles through novel synthetic methods and supports. Operando imaging techniques probing transformations at the single atom level would also advance mechanistic comprehension.

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The articles analyzed offer glimpses into how modulation of metal nanoparticle size, composition, and metal-support interactions can impact catalytic performance. But much remains unknown regarding the underlying drivers, optimal configurations, and detailed mechanistic pathways. 

Future research might focus on systematically evaluating different metal particle sizes, morphologies, support materials, and treatment conditions using advanced electron microscopy and spectroscopy. Data science approaches could help identify subtle trends and correlations. In parallel, computational studies modeling realistic catalyst structures could provide atomic-level insights to guide and interpret experiments.  

Ultimately, progress requires an integrated framework encompassing synthesis, multidimensional characterization, and mechanistic modeling rooted in the actual catalyst architecture. This could enable rational design of optimized supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and other critical reactions.
