Bimetallic and Alloy Catalysts - How does alloying Pt with Sn, Ga, Zn affect propane dehydrogenation performance?

Supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been widely studied for propane dehydrogenation, with PtSn/Al2O3 being used commercially in the Oleflex process [Placeholder_of_DOI1]. Adding Sn as a promoter helps increase propylene selectivity and stability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts by modifying the electronic properties of Pt through Pt-Sn bonding [Placeholder_of_DOI2]. This can help direct selectivity toward propylene over cracking products while also reducing coke formation and sintering. Computational studies suggest Pt-Sn intermetallic bonding weakens propane adsorption strength, which increases the dehydrogenation barrier but inhibits further catalytic reactions of propylene that lead to accelerated deactivation [Placeholder_of_DOI3]. 

The incorporation of Ga as a promoter for supported Pt catalysts has also shown promise, with Pt-Ga able to achieve 92.1% propene selectivity and 45.9% propane conversion at 600°C [Placeholder_of_DOI4]. The electronic and geometric changes induced by alloying with Ga are suggested to suppress side reactions and coking. Recent work has explored stabilizing atomically dispersed Pt sites using (SiOZn)4-6 nests in zeolite frameworks, finding isolated PtZn4-6 single sites can enable remarkable activity, >95% propylene selectivity and stability over a broad temperature range [Placeholder_of_DOI5]. The Zn helps anchor and isolate the Pt sites while also modifying selectivity through alloying effects. PtZn intermetallic nanoparticles confined in hierarchical MFI zeolite have also been reported to give exceptional productivity up to 17.0 molC3H6/molPt/s and almost no deactivation over a 30 hour test [Placeholder_of_DOI6].

In summary, alloying Pt with secondary metals like Sn, Ga and Zn has been widely demonstrated to enable improved catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation compared to monometallic Pt. While some loss in initial activity can occur, the formation of intermetallic bonding between Pt and the promoters generally helps suppress undesired reactions leading to coke and cracking while directing selectivity toward propylene. This significantly enhances stability and regenerability. Recent work has focused on the preparation of bimetallic single sites and intermetallic nanoparticles to maximize these promotional effects.

双金属和合金催化剂 - Pt与Sn、Ga、Zn合金化如何影响丙烷脱氢性能?

支撑在Al2O3上的Pt-Sn催化剂已经被广泛研究用于丙烷脱氢反应,PtSn/Al2O3被商业化应用于Oleflex工艺[Placeholder_of_DOI1]。与单金属Pt催化剂相比,添加Sn作为助剂有助于提高丙烯选择性和稳定性,这是通过Pt-Sn键的形成改变Pt的电子性质实现的[Placeholder_of_DOI2]。这有助于选择性地产生丙烯而不是裂化产物,同时也减少了焦炭形成和烧结。计算研究表明,Pt-Sn金属间化合物的形成削弱了丙烷的吸附强度,这增加了脱氢屏障,但抑制了丙烯的进一步催化反应从而导致催化剂快速失活[Placeholder_of_DOI3]。 

将Ga作为助剂引入支撑的Pt催化剂中也展示了前景,Pt-Ga能在600°C下达到92.1%的丙烯选择性和45.9%的丙烷转化率[Placeholder_of_DOI4]。合金化引入的Ga的电子和几何效应被认为抑制了副反应和焦炭形成。最近的工作探索了使用硅酸锌烷基((SiOZn)4-6)巢穴稳定孤立的Pt位点,发现隔离的PtZn4-6单一位点可以实现卓越的活性、>95%的丙烯选择性和在宽温区的高稳定性[Placeholder_of_DOI5]。 Zn有助于锚定和隔离Pt位点,同时通过合金效应也改变了选择性。限域在分层MFI分子筛中的PtZn金属间化合物纳米颗粒也被报道实现了异常高的17.0 molC3H6/molPt/s的产率和30小时测试下几乎没有失活。

总之,与单金属Pt相比,与Sn、Ga和Zn等第二金属形成合金化的Pt被广泛证明可以实现丙烷脱氢反应性能的改善。尽管最初活性会有所下降,但Pt与助剂之间的金属间化合物键的形成通常有助于抑制不 desired 反应从而导向丙烯选择性。这显著提高了稳定性和再生能力。最近的工作专注于准备双金属单一活性位点和金属间化合物纳米颗粒以最大化这些助剂效应。
