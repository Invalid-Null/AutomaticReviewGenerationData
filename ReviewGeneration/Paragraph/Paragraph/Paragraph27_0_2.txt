Based on the in-depth details extracted from the file, this section offers an analytical review focused on propane dehydrogenation catalysts, emphasizing 'Catalyst Synthesis and Characterization - How have X-ray techniques elucidated oxidation states during catalysis?':

Multiple studies have utilized X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes of active species during various stages of propane dehydrogenation catalysis. For example, Li et al. [10.1016/j.jcat.2022.140726] performed XANES and EXAFS measurements at a synchrotron source to analyze cobalt species in fresh and spent Co@Si-BEA catalysts. The EXAFS fitting revealed tetrahedral cobalt sites remained in the divalent Co2+ state without oxidation after propane dehydrogenation reaction. 

In another case, Cheng et al. [10.1021/acscatal.2c00878] used XANES and XPS on vanadium sites supported on MgO. XANES showed VO4 monomeric surface units were present matching Mg3V2O8 references, while XPS quantified the distribution of V5+, V4+, and V3+ species after H2 reduction pretreatment. This elucidated how the oxidation states evolved during the various preparation steps.

Additionally, Li et al. [10.1016/j.jcat.2006.03.004] applied in-situ XANES during temperature programmed reduction of gallium species in TMG/ZSM-5 propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The XANES edge energies shifted to lower values upon reduction, confirming the transformation of oxidized gallium species to reduced ones. Subsequent re-oxidation was also probed using nitrous oxide.

In summary, synchrotron X-ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy techniques have enabled crucial insights into metal oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalyst synthesis steps like reduction and oxidation activations as well as stability assessments after catalytic testing. This has revealed the nature of active sites responsible for high propane conversions. Further research can build on these advances to optimize pretreatments and operating conditions for tailored oxidation states.

Future research endeavors might focus on elucidating reaction mechanisms through operando XAS probing metal-hydrocarbon intermediates under working catalytic conditions. Additionally, novel catalyst architectures like single atom sites on unconventional supports can be tailored via specialized XPS-monitored pretreatments for optimized dehydrogenation. Modern machine learning algorithms leveraging synchrotron datasets could also accelerate next-generation catalyst discovery.

基于文件中提取的深入细节,本节提供了一个分析性的综述,重点关注丙烷脱氢催化剂,强调“催化剂合成和表征 - X 射线技术如何阐明催化过程中的氧化状态变化?”:

多项研究利用了基于 X 射线的技术来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的有效成分的氧化态变化。例如,Li 等 [10.1016/j.jcat.2022.140726] 在同步辐射源上对新鲜和使用后的 Co@Si-BEA 催化剂进行 XANES 和 EXAFS 测量。EXAFS 拟合结果显示四面体钴位在丙烷脱氢反应后保持在二价 Co2+ 氧化态,没有氧化。

另一例中,Cheng 等 [10.1021/acscatal.2c00878] 对载于 MgO上的钒位点使用 XANES 和 XPS。XANES 显示具有 Mg3V2O8 特征的 VO4 单体表面单元,而 XPS 定量分析了 H2 还原预处理后 V5+、V4+ 和 V3+ 种类的分布。这阐明了氧化态是如何在各种制备步骤中演变的。

此外,Li 等 [10.1016/j.jcat.2006.03.004] 在 TMG/ZSM-5 丙烷脱氢催化剂上应用了原位 XANES 对温度可编程还原过程中的镓物种进行研究。XANES 边缘能量在还原过程中向低值移动,确认了氧化镓种的转变为还原态镓种。随后的在一氧化二氮气氛中再氧化也得到了测试。

总之,同步辐射 X 射线吸收和光电子能谱技术提供了有关丙烷脱氢催化剂合成步骤(如还原和氧化活化)以及反应后稳定性评估期间金属氧化态变化的关键见解。这揭示了对于获得高丙烷转化的活性位点的本质。未来的研究可以在这些进展的基础上优化前处理和操作条件以获得定制的氧化态。
