Based on the in-depth details extracted from the file related to '30. Does the article analyze techno-economic factors that affect the viability of propane dehydrogenation processes? What specific considerations and quantitative analysis are provided?', construct an analytical and comprehensive review section on propane dehydrogenation catalysts, emphasizing 'Reactors and Process Considerations - What are the techno-economic factors governing process viability?'.

While developing the content, adhere to the following protocols:

1. **Accurate Citations**: Reference specific content from the file by embedding the actual DOI numbers furnished, without any alterations. Utilize the format '\[Placeholder\_Of\_DOI\]' right after the sentence where the reference is applied. 
   
2. **Strict Adherence**: Stick to the particulars and DOI details from the file; avoid integrating external or speculative data.

3. **Scientific Language**: Uphold a technical and scholarly diction akin to chemical engineering literature.

4. **Format &amp; Translation**: After creating the main review content, append an 'integrative understanding and prospective outlook' section within the same <English></English> and <Chinese></Chinese> XML tags, demarcated with '※※※'. This segment should transcend a mere summation and foster a forward-thinking discussion, potentially elucidating future directions and broader horizons grounded in the file's content. 

The content structure should resemble:

<example>
	<English>
