Propylene is widely recognized as one of the most important building blocks in the chemical industry, underpinning the production of a diverse array of products including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acetone, cumene, acrylic acid, and more [Placeholder_of_DOI1, Placeholder_of_DOI2]. Global demand for propylene has been increasing steadily at 2-3% per year [Placeholder_of_DOI3], with current annual production exceeding 100 million metric tons [Placeholder_of_DOI4] and projections expecting further growth of 45% by 2030 to meet rising consumption from the polymer sector [Placeholder_of_DOI5]. 

Traditionally, propylene has been sourced as a byproduct from steam cracking of naphtha or fluid catalytic cracking units in refineries. However, these conventional production routes are struggling to keep pace with burgeoning propylene requirements [Placeholder_of_DOI3]. Meanwhile, advances in hydraulic fracturing have unlocked abundant reserves of low-cost shale gas containing high fractions of propane [Placeholder_of_DOI6]. This confluence of factors has led to great interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an alternative on-purpose technology for propylene generation, which currently accounts for 10% of global supply [Placeholder_of_DOI7]. Multiple analyses have indicated PDH is not only technically feasible, but also economically competitive and environmentally friendly compared to established techniques [Placeholder_of_DOI8].

As a highly endothermic equilibrium reaction, propane dehydrogenation requires operating temperatures around 500-600°C to achieve adequate conversion levels [Placeholder_of_DOI9]. Development of improved catalysts that lower the elevated temperature requirements could further enhance process efficiency and sustainability. Overall, continued innovation in PDH catalyts and processes will be vital to leverage abundant propane feedstocks from shale gas for strategic propylene production.

PDH has clearly demonstrated itself as a commercially viable route for on-purpose propylene generation from inexpensive shale gas reserves. Moving forward, intensifying research efforts toward next-generation PDH catalysts with enhanced stability and lower temperature operation could unlock further gains. The integration of renewable hydrogen supplies into PDH processes also merits deeper investigation. Ultimately, propane dehydrogenation situated within emerging 'circular economy' frameworks could continue strengthening propylene supply chains while progressing toward net-zero emissions chemical manufacturing.

丙烯被广泛认为是化学工业中最重要的基础原料之一,支撑着诸如聚丙烯、丙烯腈、丙烯醇、丙酮、邻甲基苯酚、丙烯酸和其他产品的生产[Placeholder_of_DOI1,Placeholder_of_DOI2]。全球对丙烯的需求稳步以每年2-3%的速度增长[Placeholder_of_DOI3],当前的年产量超过1亿吨[Placeholder_of_DOI4],预计到2030年将进一步增长45%,以满足高涨的聚合物领域的消费需求[Placeholder_of_DOI5]。

传统上,丙烯主要作为石脑或催化裂化装置副产品从炼油厂获得。然而,这些常规生产途径正在难以跟上不断增长的丙烯需求[Placeholder_of_DOI3]。与此同时,水力压裂技术的进步释放出了大量低成本页岩气,其中包含高含量的丙烷[Placeholder_of_DOI6]。这些因素的共同作用导致人们对丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为丙烯生产另类正途径的高度重视,该途径目前占全球供应的10%[Placeholder_of_DOI7]。多项分析表明,与现有技术相比,PDH不仅在技术上可行,而且在经济上具有竞争力,也更环保[Placeholder_of_DOI8]。

作为一个高度放热的平衡反应,丙烷脱氢需要在500-600°C的温度下运行,以实现足够的转化率水平[Placeholder_of_DOI9]。开发出可以降低高温要求的改进型催化剂,可以进一步提高工艺的效率和可持续性。总的来说,PDH催化剂和工艺的持续创新将对利用页岩气中的丰富丙烷原料战略性地生产丙烯至关重要。

PDH已经明确证明了它本身是一种商业上可行的正途径丙烯生产技术,可以利用廉价的页岩气储量。展望未来,加大力度开发新一代PDH催化剂以获得更高稳定性和更低温度操作,可以产生更大收益。可再生氢源的整合利用于PDH工艺中也值得更深入的研究。最终,植根于新出现的“循环经济”框架中的丙烷脱氢,可以继续加强丙烯供应链,并推进实现净零排放的化学制造。
