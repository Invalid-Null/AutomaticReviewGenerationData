		Propylene is an essential raw material for producing chemicals like polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acetone, etc., with an estimated market size exceeding $100 billion annually [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]. However, there is a significant and growing gap between global propylene supply and demand, as traditional production routes like steam cracking of naphtha cannot keep pace with rising consumption [Placeholder_Of_DOI1]. This has led to increasing interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an alternative process. PDH leverages the abundant supplies of low-cost propane unlocked by shale gas to serve as a feedstock for propylene production in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner [Placeholder_Of_DOI6]. With propylene demand projected to rise 45% by 2030, driven by growth in the polymer industry, PDH capacity is expected to expand and account for a greater share of total production [Placeholder_Of_DOI15] [Placeholder_Of_DOI19].

		Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the crucial role of propylene and the supply-demand imbalance highlighted in the file details, PDH techniques show exceptional promise as an emerging field. As PDH processes scale up commercially, future research could focus on enhancing catalyst design, reaction efficiency, and process intensification. Broader adoption of PDH aligns with sustainability objectives as well, converting abundant shale gas resources into valued chemical products. Technological improvements may also enable PDH to serve new geographic markets and expand feedstock flexibility.

		丙烯是生产聚丙烯、丙烯腈、丙烯醚、丙酮等化学品的关键原料,其年市场规模估计超过1000亿美元 [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]。然而,全球丙烯供需之间存在巨大的和不断扩大的缺口,因为传统的生产路线如裂解石脑油的蒸汽裂解无法跟上日益增长的消费速度 [Placeholder_Of_DOI1]。这已引起人们对丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为替代过程的兴趣不断增长。PDH利用页岩气解锁的大量低成本丙烷作为丙烯生产的原料,这种方式既经济又环保 [Placeholder_Of_DOI6]。随着聚合物行业的发展,预计到2030年丙烯需求将增长45%,PDH产能也将扩大并占据更大的市场份额 [Placeholder_Of_DOI15] [Placeholder_Of_DOI19]。

		综合理解与未来展望: 考虑到文件中强调的丙烯的关键作用和供需失衡,PDH技术展现出了非凡的前景。随着PDH商业规模的不断扩大,未来的研究可能会集中在提高催化剂设计、反应效率和过程集成方面。PDH技术的广泛采用也有利于实现可持续发展目标,将丰富的页岩气资源转化为有价值的化学品。技术改进还可以使PDH服务于新的地理市场,并扩大原料的灵活性。
