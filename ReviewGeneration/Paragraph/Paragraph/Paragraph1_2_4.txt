		Propylene is an essential raw material for producing chemicals like polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acetone, etc., with an estimated annual market size exceeding $100 billion [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]. However, there exists a sizable and expanding gap between global propylene supply and demand, as traditional production routes like naphtha cracking struggle to keep pace amid rapidly rising consumption [Placeholder_Of_DOI1]. This has led to growing interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an alternative process, with some sources stating it currently accounts for 10% of propylene output [Placeholder_Of_DOI3]. PDH leverages abundant supplies of low-cost propane unlocked by the shale gas boom, overcoming constraints around crude oil feedstocks. Multiple studies highlight PDH's promise as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly means of boosting propylene capacity to meet projections of a 45% increase in demand by 2030 [Placeholder_Of_DOI4].

		Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Capitalizing on PDH's flexibility with feedstock selection provides an avenue to sustain propylene supply amid fluctuating market conditions. An interdisciplinary approach incorporating advancements in catalysis, process intensification and technoeconomic modeling may further improve the route's efficiency and economics. This could accelerate adoption beyond the 10% market share achieved so far, establishing PDH as a mainstream manufacturing route for maximizing propylene's extensive value chain in polymers, organic chemicals and more.

		丙烯是生产聚丙烯、丙烯腈、丙烯醇、丙酮等化学品的重要原料,其估计的年市场规模超过1000亿美元 [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]。然而,全球丙烯供应和需求之间存在着巨大的差距,随着消费的快速增长,例如轻石脑裂解等传统生产途径难以跟上步伐 [Placeholder_Of_DOI1]。这导致人们对丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为替代工艺的兴趣日益浓厚,一些来源表明它目前占丙烯产量的10% [Placeholder_Of_DOI3]。PDH利用页岩气蓬勃发展解锁的大量低成本丙烷,克服了原油料源的限制。多项研究强调PDH作为高效和环保方式提高丙烯产能以满足2030年需求预计将增长45%的承诺 [Placeholder_Of_DOI4]。

		综合理解与未来展望: 充分利用PDH选择不同原料的灵活性,为在不断变化的市场状况下保持丙烯供应提供了途径。采用跨学科方法,结合催化剂、工艺强化和技术经济模型的进步,可能会进一步提高该工艺的效率和经济性。这可能会加速采用率超过目前实现的10%的市场份额,建立PDH作为主流制造工艺,以最大限度地发挥丙烯在聚合物、有机化学品等广泛价值链中的作用。
