Based on the details provided in the file, none of the articles explored the use of subsurface promoters like Re or Mn in bimetallic and alloy catalysts to tune selectivity. Most of the articles focused solely on monometallic catalysts or bimetallic catalysts without any subsurface promoters. 

Specifically, [10.1021/jacs.8b08162] showed that a Pt3Mn subsurface significantly improved propane dehydrogenation selectivity over Pt by lowering hydrocarbon/hydrogen adsorption heats. Models were presented to demonstrate the distinct role of the subsurface Mn promoter in altering surface chemistry and selectivity. However, this was the only article that provided insights into subsurface promoter effects.

The remaining articles did not provide any specific examples or data on the use of subsurface promoters like Re or Mn to optimize selectivity in bimetallic and alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Based on the collected evidence, there appears to be a significant research gap and opportunity to further explore subsurface promoter tuning for enhanced selectivity.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The lone study highlighting subsurface Mn promotion effects indicates subsurface engineering can play a pivotal role in regulating selectivity. Building on this foundation, future endeavors could systematically investigate various bimetallic configurations with assorted subsurface promoters (Re, Mn, etc.) to optimize selectivity during propane dehydrogenation. Advanced characterization techniques like synchrotron measurements could offer insights into the electronic structure modifications induced by subsurface species. Kinetic models incorporating these subsurface effects may better elucidate the selectivity determinants. Broader horizons could explore expanding this subsurface tuning approach to other critical dehydrogenation reactions through interdisciplinary cross-pollination.

根据文件提供的详情,没有一篇文章探索了在双金属和合金催化剂中使用类似Re或Mn等次表面促进剂来调节选择性。大多数文章仅关注单金属催化剂或没有任何次表面促进剂的双金属催化剂。

具体而言,[10.1021/jacs.8b08162]表明,与Pt相比,Pt3Mn次表面可以通过降低烃/氢吸附热显着改善丙烷脱氢反应的选择性。提出了模型来演示 DISTINCT Mn次表面促进剂的作用,改变了表面化学和选择性。然而,这是唯一一篇提供次表面促进剂效应信息的文章。

其余文章没有提供任何关于使用类似Re或Mn等次表面促进剂来优化双金属和合金催化剂中丙烷脱氢反应选择性的具体示例或数据。根据收集的证据,似乎存在一个重大的研究差距和机会,以进一步探索提高选择性的次表面促进剂调谐。

综合理解与未来展望:唯一强调次表面Mn促进效应的研究表明,次表面工程可以发挥关键作用,规范选择性。在这一基础上,未来的努力可以系统地研究各种双金属配置与各种次表面促进剂(Re、Mn等)的组合,以优化丙烷脱氢反应的选择性。像同步辐射等高级表征技术可以提供次表面物种导致的电子结构修改的见解。结合这些次表面效应的动力学模型可以更好地阐明选择性决定因素。 更广阔的视野可以通过学科交叉探索将这种次表面调谐方法扩展到其他关键脱氢反应。
