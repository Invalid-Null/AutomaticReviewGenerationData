    <Content>
Based on the details extracted from the references, there evidence showing how properties like metal particle size, shape, support interactions, and pretreatment conditions influence the catalytic performance of supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

Specifically, reference [10.1016/j.apcatb.2012.11.005] reveals that a Pt/SBA-15 catalyst prepared by deposition-precipitation has much smaller Pt particles compared to one prepared by wet impregnation. The smaller Pt particles lead to higher initial conversion and propylene selectivity, although deactivation occurs due to coke formation. Reference [10.1021/acscatal.0c03391] demonstrates that depositing uniform, nanoscale Al2O3 overcoat layers on Pt nanoparticles by ALD enhances stability and selectivity by suppressing sintering and limiting formation of less selective sites during steam regeneration. An optimal coating thickness of 6-8 Å after 5-7 ALD cycles is identified. 

In terms of shape effects, reference [10.1021/acscatal.0c03381] calculates that under-coordinated Pt(211) sites dominate the reactivity over close-packed Pt(111) terrace sites, despite having lower surface area. This exemplifies the significant influence of surface structure on catalytic behavior. Additionally, reference [10.1021/jacs.6b08705] shows the reaction pathway and key intermediates involved during PDH on Pt(111), providing mechanistic insights.

Regarding metal-support interactions, reference [10.1016/j.jechem.2021.10.008] demonstrates strong interactions between Pt and boron nitride after high temperature pretreatments. This causes partial encapsulation of Pt particles by boron oxide overlayers, which constrains particle size, blocks unselective sites, and enhances stability. Similarly, reference [10.1038/s41929-023-00968-7] stabilizes ultra-small Pt clusters in 14-membered ring zeolite pores via Pt-O-Ge linkages. This tailored metal-support interaction provides outstanding PDH performance.

In summary, strategic modulation of properties like particle size, shape, metal-support interfaces and pretreatment conditions allows control over the abundance and accessibility of selective sites, enabling optimization of supported metal catalysts for targeted PDH conversion and propylene selectivity.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The findings reveal promising opportunities to advance PDH catalysis by engineering multifunctional supported metal systems. For instance, synergy between shaped metal nanoparticles and hierarchically porous supports could combine stability from overcoat layers with accessibility to tunable active sites. Stabilizing isolated metal atoms or ultra-small clusters in ordered frameworks is also a pioneering direction. Operando spectroscopy techniques will likely play an integral role in unraveling dynamic structure-performance interrelationships under working conditions. Furthermore, machine learning models trained on extensive datasets could rapidly predict optimal compositions and pretreatments for targeted applications. In summary, by elucidating fundamental principles governing activity and selectivity, then implementing those guidelines through precisely tailored synthesis methods, significant enhancements in productivity and sustainability are attainable.
