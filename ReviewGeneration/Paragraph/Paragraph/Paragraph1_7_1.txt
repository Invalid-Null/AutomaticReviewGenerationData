Propylene is an essential raw material for producing a variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acetone, etc., with an estimated annual market size exceeding $100 billion [DOI1]. However, there is a growing gap between propylene supply and demand, as traditional production routes like naphtha cracking struggle to keep pace with rapidly rising demand [DOI2]. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as an attractive alternative production route, leveraging abundant supplies of propane from shale gas [DOI3]. PDH can serve as the basis for cost-effective, large-scale propylene generation [DOI4]. 

Overall, propylene is a crucial building block compound, and on-purpose propane dehydrogenation presents opportunities to boost propylene availability through exploitation of inexpensive shale gas feeds. However, PDH is an equilibrium-limited endothermic reaction that requires careful catalyst and process design to achieve sufficient propylene yields [DOI5].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Propane dehydrogenation has demonstrated viability as an alternative propylene production pathway grounded in accessible shale gas reserves. Moving forward, intensified research attention might explore cutting-edge catalyst formulations and reactor designs to further optimize PDH conversion, selectivity, and economics [DOI6]. Broader adoption of renewable propane streams could also boost sustainability. Ultimately, continued PDH advancements can strengthen propylene supply security to enable next-generation polymers and chemicals.

丙烯是生产各种化学品(如聚丙烯、丙烯腈、丙烯醚、丙酮等)的重要原料,其估计的年市场规模超过1000亿美元 [DOI1]。然而,丙烯的供需差距正在扩大,因为传统的裂解生产路线难以跟上迅速增长的需求[DOI2]。从页岩气中获得大量丙烷的丙烷脱氢(PDH)已成为有吸引力的替代生产途径[DOI3]。PDH可以成为经济实惠的大规模丙烯生产的基础[DOI4]。

总的来说,丙烯是关键的基础化合物,从廉价的页岩气原料进行的丙烷脱氢反应为扩大丙烯供应提供了机遇。然而,PDH是一个受限的放热平衡反应,需要仔细的催化剂和工艺设计来获得足够的丙烯收率[DOI5]。

综合理解与未来展望:利用丰富的页岩气储量,丙烷脱氢反应已被证明是一种可行的替代丙烯生产途径。展望未来,加强的研发关注可能会探索前沿的催化剂配方和反应器设计,以进一步优化PDH的转换率、选择性和经济性[DOI6]。更广泛地采用可再生丙烷也有助于提高可持续性。最终,PDH技术的持续发展可以增强丙烯的供应保障,以支持新一代聚合物和化学品的研发。
