{"Quotes": "[1] \"In the reducer, the propane feedstock is oxidized by the lattice oxygen from metal oxides.\" \n         [2] \"the core of CL-ODH using propane as the feedstock involves complex redox reactions in which propane molecules adsorb and dissociate on the surface of metal oxides, namely oxygen carriers.\"\n         [3] \"the diffusion of O2 significantly influences the surface reaction kinetics. Increasing the binding energy of VO bonds to inhibit the lattice oxygen diffusion is critical to enhance the propylene selectivity.\"", "English": "The article proposes a mechanistic scenario where propane adsorbs and dissociates on the surface of the metal oxide oxygen carrier, and is oxidized by lattice oxygen to form propylene. Lattice oxygen diffusion needs to be inhibited by increasing VO bond strength to limit overoxidation and enhance propylene selectivity.", "Doi": "10.1002/anie.202005968"},

{"Quotes": "[1] The structure and catalytic properties of these Cr species are compared with those supported on γ-Al2O3, which is typically used in industrial DHP processes and is also known to contain well defined Cr site distribution depending on the Cr content. This will allow us to investigate the influence of the molecular structure, which is dependent on the nature of the support as evident from literature, of Cr species on DHP with identical Cr content and in some cases (at 1 wt% Cr) with similar Cr distribution.", "English": "Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects by comparing Cr species on SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3 supports.
