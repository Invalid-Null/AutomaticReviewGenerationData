Metal Oxide Catalysts - What metal oxides like Cr2O3, Ga2O3 have shown promising propane dehydrogenation activity?

Several metal oxide catalysts have been explored for propane dehydrogenation, with some promising results reported. Among them, gallium oxide and chromium oxide stand out as active and selective catalysts based on the evidence extracted from the file.

Specifically, polymorphs of gallium oxide including α-Ga2O3, β-Ga2O3, and γ-Ga2O3 were evaluated for propane dehydrogenation by Zhang et al. [10.1021/acscatal.0c05009]. Out of these, β-Ga2O3 showed the highest initial activity, attributed to its high surface acid site density as determined by NH3-TPD. Silica-supported β-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3 also demonstrated good propylene yields. Ga2O3/SiO2 prepared by flame pyrolysis was investigated by Cargnello et al., with in situ IR results indicating it has intrinsic activity for propane dehydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.1c02621]. Among various metal oxides, Ga2O3 gave the highest propylene yield, outperforming Fe2O3 and Cr2O3 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999].

Chromium oxide (Cr2O3) has also shown promise for propane dehydrogenation. According to Zhu et al., Cr-based catalysts like Cr2O3 are among the most active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 [10.1021/acscatal.2c05286]. Chang et al. studied α-Cr2O3(0001) using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and microkinetic modeling, providing insights into the non-oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism [10.1021/acscatal.1c01814]. Weak metal-support interactions with SiO2 were found to improve Cr2O3's propylene selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999]. Among different metal oxide catalysts, Cr2O3 gave higher yields than Fe2O3 and Al2O3 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999]. However, deactivation from coking remains an issue for Cr2O3 catalysts.

In summary, gallium oxide and chromium oxide catalysts have exhibited promising intrinsic activity and propylene selectivity for the propane dehydrogenation reaction based on the examples and data extracted from the literature. However, stability and resistance to deactivation still need to be improved through composition optimization, metal-support effects, and other strategies. Advancing these metal oxide catalysts could provide more economical alternatives to traditional supported metal catalysts. Future work should focus on elucidating the active sites, reaction mechanisms, and deactivation pathways on these materials. Combining advanced characterization techniques with computational modeling and kinetic studies will provide essential insights to guide the design of optimized metal oxide catalysts. There is an opportunity to build on the progress made so far and develop these metal oxides into viable propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The promising intrinsic activity demonstrated by certain metal oxides like gallium oxide and chromium oxide reveals opportunities to further develop these materials as alternative propane dehydrogenation catalysts. While metal oxides may not yet match the performance of supported metals, they possess potential advantages in Economics and sustainability that merit continued exploration. Elucidating the nature of their active sites through advanced spectroscopic techniques and establishing clear structure-activity relationships via computational studies could unlock targeted improvements. Stability and resistance to deactivation should be key priorities. Modulating factors like polymorphism, defects, and metal-support interactions may help address these challenges. Development of bifunctional metal oxide catalysts that couple dehydrogenation sites with acidic sites for olefin desorption could also boost selectivity. Beyond materials design, optimal integration in suitable reactor systems will be critical for eventual commercial deployment. The possibilities are exciting for metal oxides to play a bigger role in propane dehydrogenation, as long as research continues to build fundamental knowledge while translating insights into practical advancements.
