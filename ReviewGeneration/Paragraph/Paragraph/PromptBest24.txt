Here is a comprehensive review section on propane dehydrogenation catalysts, emphasizing methods for optimizing active phase dispersion:

Catalyst Synthesis and Characterization - What preparation methods have enabled optimizing active phase dispersion?

Numerous studies have developed advanced catalyst preparation strategies aimed at optimizing the dispersion of active phase species for enhanced propane dehydrogenation performance. Methods like vacuum impregnation [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726] and incorporation of metals during zeolite hydrothermal synthesis [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728] can improve dispersion by tuning interactions with the support. Dealuminated zeolites and ordered mesoporous materials provide open frameworks and high surface areas to disperse and stabilize isolated sites [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014, 10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7]. Surface organometallic chemistry enables precisely grafting metals onto supports through strong metal-oxygen-support bonds [10.1021/acscatal.3c00103]. Other strategies include colloidal [10.1016/j.jcat.2018.09.006] and dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticle synthesis [10.1021/cr5002436], atomic layer deposition [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.01.005], and stabilization in microporous zeolites [10.1002/anie.201805150].

In situ spectroscopy techniques like XAFS, XPS, IR, and DRIFTS have elucidated changes in metal speciation during preparation steps like impregnation [10.1021/acscatal.2c00928, 10.1021/jacs.2c03941], allowing optimization of parameters impacting dispersion. Characterization methods like HAADF-STEM imaging confirm isolation and morphology of active sites.

※※※ Integrative understanding and prospective outlook ※※※  

The works surveyed showcase remarkable progress in synthesizing propane dehydrogenation catalysts with uniform and thermally resilient active phases. Key achievements include stabilizing isolated metal sites, crafting bimetallic alloys, and confining ultra-small clusters - enabled by emergent characterization tools providing atomic-scale precision. 

Future horizons may integrate these advances with other burgeoning techniques like additive manufacturing to architect dehydrogenation catalysts bespoke to process intensification and modularization. Cross-linking developments in operando mechanistic elucidation with high-throughput computaional screening could further accelerate optimized catalyst discovery. Broader adoption of earth-abundant substitutes may enhance economic viability. Ultimately, transformative propane dehydrogenation systems seamlessly fused with renewable power and carbon capture provide fertile ground for multifaceted innovation.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts require optimized dispersion and stabilization of the active metal phase to achieve high activity, selectivity, and stability. The reviewed study [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726] investigates catalyst preparation methods for optimizing active phase dispersion of cobalt species in BEA zeolites. Co@Si-BEA catalysts with 0.1-5 wt% Co are prepared by vacuum impregnation, with 0.1-0.5 wt% Co showing the highest intrinsic activity attributed to isolated Co2+ sites. Dealumination also improves dispersion and coke resistance. 

Further works utilize various techniques for optimizing dispersion:

- Controlling metal loading, support interactions, and calcination conditions during impregnation, ion exchange, CVD, etc. to tune metal speciation and prevent nanoparticle formation [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728, 10.1021/acscatal.3c00816, 10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7].

- Employing mesoporous, high surface area supports like SBA-15 and modifying supports to increase metal anchoring [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7, 10.1021/acscatal.8b04859].  

- Utilizing surface organometallic chemistry to graft isolated metal sites [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7, 10.1021/acs.accounts.9b00138].

- Tuning solvents, surfactants, and pH during impregnation and sol-gel routes to control nanoparticle nucleation, growth and support interactions [10.1021/acscatal.3c00818, 10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.008].

- Atomic layer deposition for uniform, highly dispersed metal oxide layers [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.01.005].

The reviewed insights on optimizing active phase dispersion pave the way for developing superior PDH catalysts via rational design principles. Future directions include extending these strategies to emerging supports and metastable multimetallic assemblies unattainable by conventional means. Harnessing in-situ probes during catalyst activation is also vital to unlocking coveted nanoscale motifs through transient precursors.

The findings showcase techniques like controlled impregnation loading and dealumination treatment to achieve optimized dispersion of active Co species in zeolite frameworks. Isolated Co2+ sites demonstrate superior intrinsic activity compared to larger CoOx clusters. Future research could explore extending these strategies to other crucial propane dehydrogenation components like gallium, chromium, and vanadium. Advanced characterization methods should also elucidate active site isolation mechanisms. Overall, rationally tailoring support interactions, site isolation, and electron density modulation emerge as pivotal areas warranting further exploration.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts require optimized active phase dispersion to maximize selectivity towards propylene. Multiple studies investigate preparation methods aimed at optimizing dispersion. 

Co@Si-BEA catalysts with 0.1-0.5 wt% cobalt loadings prepared by vacuum impregnation show highest intrinsic activity due to well dispersed isolated Co2+ sites [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726]. Dealuminated Co@Si-BEA produces less coke than standard Co@BEA, indicating better dispersion [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726].

Boron nitride sheets with defects introduced to increase active sites are selective for propane dehydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728]. Dispersion is also improved by loading boron species into 3D porous structures or frameworks [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728].  

Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are commonly prepared by impregnating Ga salts on the support [10.1002/advs.202207756]. Tailoring framework Al distribution optimizes PDH activity by localizing isolated Ga species [10.1002/advs.202207756].

Ligand-protected hydrothermal synthesis constructs isolated {(SiO)2Co(HOSi)2} sites in Co-MFI, showing high efficiency and selectivity [10.1021/jacs.2c02636]. This prevents formation of less selective CoOx clusters/nanoparticles [10.1021/jacs.2c02636].

Increasing vanadia dispersion in silica gel improves selectivity by isolating active sites [10.1016/S0021-9517(02)00015-5]. The highest propylene rate occurs at 10 wt% V2O5, above which excess bulk V2O5 likely forms [10.1016/S0021-9517(02)00015-5].

※※※

The studies reveal tailoring support properties, controlling metal loading, and using advanced preparation techniques enable optimizing active phase dispersion. Key strategies evident from the analyses include:

- Introducing promoters or modifiers that anchor dispersed metal species 
- Tuning pore architecture to prevent mobility/aggregation
- Limiting metal precursor concentration to achieve isolated motifs
- Applying specialty methods like ligand protection and atomic layer deposition

Further work could explore extending these strategies to emerging catalyst architectures like metal-organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks. Rational design of multi-functionalized supports may also enable programmed dispersion motifs. Operando characterization techniques would offer additional insight into dispersion dynamics.

Based on the details extracted from the file, the article investigates Co@Si-BEA catalysts prepared by vacuum impregnation with varying cobalt loadings from 0.1-5 wt%. The 0.1-0.5 wt% samples showed the highest intrinsic activity due to well dispersed isolated Co2+ sites. Dealuminated Co@Si-BEA also produced less graphitic coke than non-dealuminated Co@BEA, indicating better dispersion [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726].

The preparation methods enable optimizing active phase dispersion by controlling metal loading during impregnation and incorporating dealuminating treatments. Lower cobalt loadings lead to isolated Co2+ sites, while higher loadings cause aggregation. Dealumination further improves dispersion by altering support interactions.

※※※

The findings showcase the intricate interplay between active phase loading, support properties, and textural characteristics in modulating dispersion. While vacuum impregnation furnishes simplicity, emerging preparation techniques could unlock additional facets. For instance, targeted fragmentation strategies may engineer zeolite substrates with defect sites to disperse active motifs. Moreover, surface organometallic routes can graft isolated metal complexes. Exploring these avenues alongside operando spectroscopic monitoring could uncover structure-activity motifs to advance catalyst design.

Based on the in-depth details extracted from the file, this review section will emphasize 'Catalyst Synthesis and Characterization - What preparation methods have enabled optimizing active phase dispersion?'.

Multiple studies have investigated catalyst preparation techniques aimed at optimizing the dispersion of active species for propane dehydrogenation. Co@Si-BEA catalysts with 0.1-0.5 wt% cobalt loadings prepared by vacuum impregnation showed the highest intrinsic activity due to isolated Co2+ sites [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726]. Dealuminated Co@Si-BEA also produced less graphitic coke than non-dealuminated Co@BEA, indicating enhanced dispersion [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726]. 

Using defects and holes to create dispersed 2D active sites in BN nanosheets was found to significantly boost propane dehydrogenation activity [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728]. Anchoring B active components on 3D porous structures or doping them into frameworks constitutes another effective strategy to construct dispersed sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728].

Multiple studies demonstrated the efficacy of Surface Organometallic Chemistry (SOMC) approaches in generating isolated metal centers. SOMC using siloxide or aluminate molecular precursors on dehydroxylated oxide surfaces allows crafting isolated sites in proximity to OH groups, enabling tailored bimetallic synthesis [10.1021/acs.accounts.9b00138]. Grafting metal alkyl species on supports produces sites with exceptional anti-reduction capabilities [10.1021/acscatal.3c00103].

Impregnation, ion exchange, and reductive treatments have enabled optimized dispersion of Ga, Zn, and In active phases in zeolites [10.1002/advs.202207756]. Ligand-protected hydrothermal approaches generate tetrahedral Co motifs in MFI, evading CoOx aggregation [10.1021/jacs.2c02636]. Varying impregnation solvents like ethanol over water prevents coking and enables dispersion [10.1016/S1872-2067(15)61042-7]. Sonication during wet impregnation breaks up Pt precursor salts, decreasing particle size [10.1016/j.ultsonch.2010.04.005].

Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) allows depositing highly dispersed metal oxides on supports without detectable crystals [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.01.005]. Strong interactions between promoters like Fe and active species such as Pt enable anchoring isolated atoms at multiple sites [10.1021/acscatal.2c05042].

Hydrothermal [10.1016/j.jechem.2021.04.034] and sol-gel [10.1021/acscatal.3c00818] methods have successfully yielded small, uniform metal nanoparticles. Surfactant addition during synthesis improves uniformity [10.1021/acscatal.3c00818]. Metals introduced in situ avoid leaching and migration during calcination, retaining dispersion [10.1021/acscatal.1c01924].

To conclude, myriad preparation strategies have been developed to optimize active phase dispersion for propane dehydrogenation, employing techniques like SOMC, ALD, sonication, hydrothermal synthesis, and surfactant addition during preparation. These methods create isolated sites, atomically dispersed species, small uniform particles, and strong metal-support interactions. Further research could focus on extending these strategies to craft single site catalysts with maximal stability.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts require optimized active phase dispersion to maximize selectivity towards propylene. The reviewed literature investigates various preparation methods to achieve this goal. 

Several studies utilize impregnation techniques to disperse metal species. Co@Si-BEA catalysts with 0.1-0.5 wt% cobalt prepared by vacuum impregnation show excellent PDH intrinsic activity due to isolated Co2+ sites [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726]. Bimetallic PtSn catalysts on alumina prepared via sequential incipient impregnation also display increased platinum dispersion due to tin stabilization effects [10.1016/j.cej.2014.09.107]. Other work explores one-pot hydrothermal synthesis for incorporating isolated metal sites like Zn2+ into the micropores of S-1 zeolite, verified by STEM-EDS mapping [10.1016/j.jechem.2021.04.034].

Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) using molecular precursors enables precise grafting of isolated metals like Ga3+ onto dehydroxylated oxide surfaces [10.1021/acscatal.3c00103]. Cothermolysis extends this for dispersed Cr/Si/Al/O catalysts [10.1016/S0021-9517(03)00141-6]. Ordered mesoporous silicas and nanocarbon supports are also utilized to optimize site isolation and stabilization [10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63360-7].

Overall, tailoring preparation steps like impregnation order, surface modifiers, thermal treatments, and SOMC grafting allows excellent control over active phase dispersion, enabling the next generation of optimized PDH catalysts.

※※※ 
The reviewed studies highlight the vital role preparation techniques play in optimizing active site dispersion, a key requirement for selectivity in PDH catalysts. Building on these fundamental advances, future horizons may involve extending precision preparation methods towards cheaper transition metals like iron instead of traditional platinum group metals. Additionally, novel supports with tunable acid-base properties could help anchor isolated sites and prevent mobility/aggregation over extended operating lifetimes. Overall, the foundation established on tailored synthesis methods sets the stage for cost-effective and durable PDH catalysts through rational dispersion control.

The findings showcase how tailored catalyst synthesis techniques can effectively tune active phase dispersion, thereby regulating selectivity and stability. As research endeavors uncover novel compositions and preparation strategies, opportunities emerge to extend such precision-engineering approaches across broader catalyst families. Moreover, advanced operando spectroscopies now allow tracking dispersion dynamics during reaction. Coupling these in-motion insights with high-throughput computations could rapidly screen promoters/additives that maintain optimized dispersion states. Such cutting-edge methodologies may spearhead rational design of robust catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and beyond.
