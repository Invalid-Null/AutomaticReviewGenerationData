Propylene is an essential raw material for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acetone, etc., with an estimated annual market size exceeding $100 billion [Placeholder_of_DOI2]. However, there is a growing supply-demand gap for propylene that is projected to further widen by 2030, as traditional production routes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking struggle to keep pace with rapidly rising demand [Placeholder_of_DOI3]. This creates major incentives for alternative technologies like propane dehydrogenation (PDH) which offers an attractive pathway for on-purpose propylene generation from abundant and low-cost propane feedstocks unlocked by the shale gas boom [Placeholder_of_DOI8] [Placeholder_of_DOI14]. Although an equilibrium-limited endothermic process requiring high temperatures around 500-600°C [Placeholder_of_DOI19], PDH already accounts for 10% of global propylene output [Placeholder_of_DOI17] and is poised to take on a greater role in alleviating looming propylene shortages given continual supply and cost advantages over naphtha cracking [Placeholder_of_DOI12].

With propylene demand slated to almost double by 2030 [Placeholder_of_DOI17], there will likely be expanded efforts to push PDH technologies towards greater efficiency and sustainability, such as through the development of novel catalysts capable of operating at lower temperatures with higher propylene yields. This could open new possibilities like the utilization of alternative heating sources, for instance solar-thermal heating, to drive the endothermic PDH reaction in a renewable manner. If successful, integrating renewable heat sources with PDH could transform an already promising pathway into an even more competitive and environmentally-friendly route for large-scale propylene production to meet society's growing materials needs.

丙烯是生产各种化学品(如聚丙烯、丙烯氧化物、丙烯腈、丙酮等)的重要原料,其年市场规模预计超过1000亿美元[Placeholder_of_DOI2]。然而,丙烯的供需缺口正在不断扩大,预计到2030年还将进一步扩大,因为蒸汽裂解和催化裂化等传统生产途径难以跟上迅速增长的需求[Placeholder_of_DOI3]。这为丙烷脱氢(PDH)等替代技术创造了重大动力,PDH提供了一条从页岩气繁荣解锁的充足廉价丙烷原料转化生成丙烯的有吸引力途径[Placeholder_of_DOI8] [Placeholder_of_DOI14]。尽管PDH是一个需要高温(约500-600°C)的限平衡端othermic过程[Placeholder_of_DOI19],但它已经占全球丙烯产量的10% [Placeholder_of_DOI17],并有望随着相对于裂化石脑油持续的供应和成本优势,在缓解日益严重的丙烯短缺中发挥更大作用。

随着丙烯需求预计到2030年将近翻番[Placeholder_of_DOI17],为提高PDH技术的效率和可持续性可能做出更多努力,例如开发能够在更低温度下运转从而获得更高丙烯收率的新型催化剂。这可能打开新的可能性,例如利用可再生能源作为端othermic PDH反应的热源。如果成功的话,将可再生热源与PDH相结合,可以使一个已很有前景的途径变得更具竞争力和环保,大规模生产满足社会日益增长的材料需求所需的丙烯。
