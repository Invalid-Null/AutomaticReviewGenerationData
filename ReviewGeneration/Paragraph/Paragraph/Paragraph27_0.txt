Based on the details from reference [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726], in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments including X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were performed to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation over Co@Si-BEA catalysts. The FT-EXAFS and WT-EXAFS spectra of the spent catalyst confirmed that the incorporated Co2+ cations acting as active sites remained structurally stable against the reaction with no changes in oxidation state or coordination environment [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726].

The use of operando XAS provides critical insights into tracking oxidation state changes and stability of active sites under working conditions for propane dehydrogenation catalysis. As the field continues to uncover new compositions and combinations of metals and supports, further application of these X-ray based probes during continuous catalytic cycling will help elucidate deactivation pathways and opportunities to enhance durability. There also lies great potential in correlating oxidation state evolution with online product distribution and kinetics. Advanced closed loop optimization of redox properties in situ may open new routes to regulating product selectivity on demand.

根据参考文献[10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726]的详细信息,对Co@Si-BEA催化剂进行了X射线吸收光谱(XAS)实验,包括X射线吸收边结构(XANES)和扩展X射线吸收细结构(EXAFS),以探测丙烷脱氢过程中的氧化态变化。spent催化剂的FT-EXAFS和WT-EXAFS光谱确认,作为活性位点的嵌入Co2+阳离子在反应过程中保持结构稳定,氧化态或配位环境没有变化[10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726]。

使用在线XAS技术可以关键性地追踪工作条件下活性位点的氧化态变化和稳定性,这为丙烷脱氢催化提供了重要信息。随着该领域继续发现新的金属和载体组合,这些X射线探测技术在持续催化循环中的进一步应用将有助于阐明失活途径和提高稳定性的机会。还存在巨大的潜力,可以关联氧化态演变与在线产物分布和动力学。优化反应条件从而调控产物选择性也是一个有前景的研究方向。
