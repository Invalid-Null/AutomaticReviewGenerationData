Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important industrial process that converts propane to propylene, a key building block for polymers and chemicals. Metal oxide catalysts play a major role in selective oxidative dehydrogenation pathways for PDH. Recent studies have explored how metal-support interfacial effects in these catalysts can modulate catalytic performance.

For vanadium oxide catalysts supported on various metal oxides, the nature of the support affects PDH activity. As shown in [10.1021/acscatal.2c00878], VOx supported on ZrO2 displays 4 times higher activity compared to other oxide supports. Density functional theory calculations reveal this stems from weaker VOx-ZrO2 interactions, lowering electron density on bridging oxygen atoms to promote selective C-H bond activation in propane. The principles establish approaches to tune the VO active site local environment.

In the case of alumina-supported Cr2O3 catalysts [10.1016/S1872-2067(18)63202-4], varying the calcination temperature of the support modulates its acidity. Lower support acidity improves Cr dispersion and catalyst stability by reducing coking. The rough rod-shaped morphology of alumina particles also contributes by enhancing Cr2O3 anchoring.

For gallium oxide catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999], the nature of the support affects H2 chemisorption capacity and acid-base properties. This correlates with propane dehydrogenation activity, with TiO2, ZrO2 and Al2O3 showing superior performance to SiO2 and MgO. The differing chemical properties modulate Ga3+ site density and catalytic behavior.

These examples highlight approaches where engineering metal-support interfaces allows rational design of selective and stable PDH metal oxide catalysts.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on:

- **In-depth computational studies**: High-level DFT calculations can offer atomistic-scale insights into metal-support interfacial phenomena and help screen promising combinations.

- **Operando characterization techniques**: Advanced spectroscopies under working conditions can illuminate dynamic changes at critical interfaces and active sites.

- **Machine learning structure-activity models**: Data-driven tools could rapidly predict optimal metal-support pairs by discerning subtle activity descriptors.

- **Novel nanostructured supports**: Tunable architectures like hierarchical porous carbons may offer new handles to tune interfacial effects beneficially. 

By integrating such cutting-edge approaches with fundamental knowledge of catalytic phenomena, transformative advances in rational design of selective and robust PDH metal oxide catalysts appear within reach.

The article by Wang et al. [10.1021/acscatal.2c00878] explores metal-support interfacial effects in VOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It systematically investigates the effects of different oxide supports on PDH activity over VOx catalysts, finding VOx/ZrO2 to be 4 times more active. Density functional theory calculations reveal this is due to weaker VOx-ZrO2 interactions leading to lower electron density on bridge oxygen atoms, enhancing their capability to rupture C-H bonds in propane. The principles established aim to help tune the VO active site microenvironment.

Similarly, the study by Li et al. [10.1021/acscatal.5b01679] shows that adding Na+ ions to silica supports promotes the formation of reactive SiONa+ sites, enhancing 2D vanadia dispersion to match levels seen on other supports like Al2O3 or ZrO2. This enhances VOx/SiO2 catalyst activity while maintaining selectivity.

In the Cr-Al2O3 system explored by Ma et al. [10.1016/S1872-2067(18)63202-4], varying alumina calcination temperature modulates acidity, affecting catalyst stability and coking. The synthesized alumina's rod-shaped nanostructure and rough surface are proposed to enhance Cr2O3 dispersion. Lower support acidity associates with better anti-coking ability.  

For Co-BEA, Gao et al. [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726] show dealumination generates anchoring silanol groups that stabilize isolated and selective Co2+ sites.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The studies highlighted showcase how rational design of metal-support interfaces - by tuning acid-base properties, controlling dispersion, modulating electronic structure, or stabilizing isolated active sites - can effectively optimize PDH catalyst performance. This mechanistic understanding of structure-activity relationships carries promise for targeted advancement of PDH catalysts by interfacing emerging support materials like metal-organic frameworks with known selective metal sites. Controlled nanoscale engineering of defined interfacial sites also opens up opportunities to limit undesirable consecutive combustion reactions. Further integration of operando spectroscopies with theoretical simulations will likely reveal additional descriptors to predict and design optimized multifunctional interfaces. Broader adoption of this interfacial approach beyond conventional oxides to emerging catalysts could expand the toolkit for selective alkane activation.

Future efforts might explore high-throughput computational screening of metal-support combinations to identify promising interfaces for selective dehydrogenation. There is also potential to extend this concept to designing multifunctional single sites at the interface, combining protonic, redox, and metallic functionalities to enable new reaction mechanisms. Advances in in situ characterization could provide further insights to guide these design endeavors. Overall, strategic manipulation of interfacial effects promises to be a fruitful strategy for developing efficient and sustainable catalysts.

The article by Wang et al. [10.1021/acscatal.2c00878] explores metal-support interfacial effects in VOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It systematically investigates how different oxide supports affect the activity of supported VOx catalysts, finding VOx/ZrO2 to have over 4 times higher activity than VOx supported on other oxides. Density functional theory calculations reveal this is attributed to weaker VOx-ZrO2 interactions, leading to lower electron density on bridge oxygen atoms and thus higher capability to rupture C-H bonds in propane. The principles established provide guidance to tune the microenvironment of VO active sites for improved PDH performance.

Additionally, Liu et al. [10.1021/acscatal.5b01679] show that for vanadium oxide on silica supports, the weak interaction with surface silanol groups causes undesired 3D nanoparticle formation. Adding sodium ions creates more reactive SiONa+ sites that anchor 2D vanadia, enhancing dispersion to match other supports. This improves activity while maintaining selectivity.

Furthermore, Zhang et al. [10.1016/j.cej.2022.140726] demonstrate that dealumination of zeolite BEA support generates silanol groups that anchor isolated Co2+ cations. These stable cobalt sites activate C-H over C-C bonds in propane, delivering high propylene selectivity. 

These examples highlight how strategic manipulation of metal-support interfaces in oxide catalysts provides targeted pathways to optimize PDH performance.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The studies appraised underscore metal-support interplay as a pivotal handle to direct structural configurations and resultant reactivity. Strategies like ion exchange to modulate anchoring site reactivity, solid-state reaction to alter interface morphology, and post-synthetic dealumination to generate isolated active sites offer tested blueprints. 

Expanding these design tenets to emerging heterojunctions with tunable interfaces (metal/metal oxide, metal/nitride, metal/carbide etc.) can spur innovation. Harnessing operando spectroscopies to track transient intermediates across internal interfaces promises to advance mechanistic models and catalyticDue to character limits, the passage has been abbreviated here for the review content.

Based on the details provided in the file, there are a few studies that explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and provide insights into activity and selectivity modulation.

One example is the study on phosphine-modified VOx/Al2O3 catalysts [10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.119089]. Phosphine treatment is found to weaken the interaction between vanadium species and the alumina support. This facilitates desorption of propylene intermediates/products from the catalyst surface, enhancing selectivity and stability.

Another relevant study investigates the impact of different oxide supports like ZrO2 and Al2O3 on VOx catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.2c00878]. Density functional theory calculations reveal weaker VOx-ZrO2 interactions lead to lower electron density on bridge oxygen atoms, enhancing their capability to rupture C-H bonds in propane and boosting activity. 

The role of strong metal-support interactions is highlighted in Pt/Sn-Beta zeolite catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.9b03527], where isolated Sn sites strongly anchor Pt clusters, resulting in high Pt dispersion and thermal stability. This enhances catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation.

Overall, these studies demonstrate that judicious tuning of metal-support interfaces, by modifiers or choice of support, can effectively modulate the microenvironment and electronic properties of active sites. This provides opportunities to optimize activity, selectivity and stability of metal oxide catalysts for the crucial propane dehydrogenation reaction.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The findings reveal metal-support interplay can profoundly influence propane dehydrogenation over metal oxides by altering active site isolation, electron density, anchoring effects and desorption kinetics. However, most studies have focused on few conventional supports like alumina and silica. Exploring emerging supports with tailored interfaces (e.g. metal-organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks) could uncover further structure-performance correlations. Operando spectroscopies probing working catalysts can also help advance molecular-level mechanistic comprehending of interfacial phenomena governing selectivity and deactivation. Such fundamental insights can guide the design of robust, multifunctional metal oxide catalysts for efficient on-purpose propylene production.

The study detailed in [10.1021/acscatal.2c00878] investigates the effects of different oxide supports like ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2 on the catalytic performance of supported VOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It finds that VOx supported on ZrO2 shows over 4 times higher activity compared to other supports. Density functional theory calculations reveal that this enhanced activity stems from weaker VOx-ZrO2 interactions, which lower the electron density on bridge oxygen atoms and increase their capability to rupture C-H bonds in propane. The principles established aim to help further tune the microenvironment of the VO active site to achieve high activity and propylene selectivity.
		
		Additionally, [10.1021/acscatal.5b01679] explores metal-support effects in vanadium oxide catalysts supported on silica. The study shows that compared to other conventional supports, silica triggers undesired 3D nanoparticle formation due to less reactive surface silanol groups, which reduces dispersion. Adding a small amount of Na+ promotes the formation of more reactive SiONa+ anchoring sites that facilitate 2D vanadia dispersion comparable to other supports like Al2O3 or ZrO2. This enhances catalytic activity while maintaining selectivity.
		
		※※※
		The findings showcase how subtle variations in metal-support interactions, mediated by strategic alterations in the support identity or surface chemistry, can profoundly influence the dispersion, geometry, electronic properties and stability of supported metal oxide active sites. This in turn enables targeted modulation of catalytic performance parameters such as activity, selectivity and lifespan. 
		
		An expansive perspective for future explorations is to conduct high-throughput computational and experimental screening of diverse mixed metal oxide compositions across various families of supports like zeolites, mesoporous silicas and metal oxides. This combinatorial approach spanning wide swaths of catalytic space could unveil formerly unknown synergies that spur transformational advances in propane dehydrogenation. For instance, bi- or tri-metallic sites dispersed on hierarchically porous supports with tailored acid-base characteristics might unlock unprecedented multifunctional capability. Or novel supports like metal-organic frameworks or covalent organic frameworks with rational incorporation of coordinatively unsaturated sites could stabilize Single Atom Catalysts to push selectivity limits.
