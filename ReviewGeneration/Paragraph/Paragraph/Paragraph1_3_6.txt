		Propylene is an essential raw material for producing a wide variety of valuable chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acetone, etc., with an estimated annual market size exceeding $100 billion [Placeholder_of_DOI1]. However, there is a growing gap between propylene supply and demand that is projected to reach 191 megatons by 2030, while traditional production routes like naphtha cracking struggle to keep pace [Placeholder_of_DOI2]. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a promising technology to produce propylene by exploiting abundant and low-cost supplies of propane from shale gas [Placeholder_of_DOI3]. By converting propane feeds to propylene, PDH helps close the demand gap in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner [Placeholder_of_DOI4].
		※※※
		Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the increasing propylene demand coupled with shale gas supplies, PDH is likely to command greater focus. Further advancements in catalyst design, reactor engineering, and process integration can improve PDH efficiency and economics. Moreover, sustainability concerns may necessitate innovations like renewable propane feeds, electrolytic hydrogen utilization, and carbon capture. Exploring these avenues can cement PDH's role in building a resilient and decarbonized propylene production landscape.

		丙烯是生产各种有价值化学品(如聚丙烯、丙烯腈、丙烯醚、丙酮等)的重要原料,其年市场规模估计超过1000亿美元 [Placeholder_of_DOI1]。然而,丙烯的供需间存在着日益扩大的缺口,预计到2030年将达到1910万吨,而裂解石脂等传统生产途径正难以跟上需求增长的步伐[Placeholder_of_DOI2]。丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为一种有前景的技术,能够利用页岩气中丰富廉价的丙烷生产丙烯[Placeholder_of_DOI3],通过将丙烷原料转化为丙烯,PDH有助于以经济实惠和环保的方式弥补丙烯需求缺口[Placeholder_of_DOI4]。  
		※※※
		综合理解与未来展望:考虑到丙烯需求不断增长和页岩气丙烷的供应,PDH可能会受到更多关注。继续改进催化剂设计、反应器工程和工艺集成,可以提高PDH的效率和经济性。此外,可持续发展的考量可能需要采用可再生丙烷原料、电解制氢和碳捕集等创新技术。探索这些途径可以巩固PDH在建立弹性和低碳丙烯生产格局中的作用。
