		Propylene is an essential raw material for producing chemicals like polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acetone, and propylene oxide, with an estimated market size exceeding $100 billion annually [DOI1, DOI2]. Traditional production routes via steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are struggling to meet rapidly rising demand, which is projected to reach 191 megatons by 2030 [DOI3]. Fortunately, abundant supplies of low-cost propane from shale gas have made propane dehydrogenation (PDH) an economically competitive and environmentally friendly pathway for on-purpose propylene generation [DOI4, DOI5]. However, further catalyst innovations are still needed to improve conversion and selectivity for this equilibrium-limited endothermic reaction operating at high temperatures of 500-600°C [DOI6].

		Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a promising route to help close the widening gap between propylene supply and demand. As PDH technology continues maturing, future research could explore novel catalysts and processes that boost productivity while minimizing costs and environmental impacts. Broader adoption of renewable propane feeds may also support further expansion of PDH capacity. Ultimately, multifaceted solutions across production, storage, transportation and end-use efficiency will be needed to sustainably meet propylene’s essential role supporting polymers, chemicals and materials indispensable to modern life.

		丙烯是生产诸如聚丙烯、丙烯腈、丙酮和丙烯醚等化学品的关键原料,其估计的市场规模超过1000亿美元每年 [DOI1, DOI2]。传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解生产途径正在努力满足需求的迅速增长,预计到2030年将达到1910万吨 [DOI3]。幸运的是,大量来自页岩气的低成本丙烷使丙烷脱氢(PDH)成为一条经济有竞争力和环保的途径,用于丙烯的目的性生产 [DOI4, DOI5]。然而,为了改进这个在500-600°C高温下运行的限平衡的内吸热反应的转化率和选择性,还需要进一步的催化剂创新 [DOI6]。

		综合理解与未来展望:丙烷脱氢已出现为一条有前途的途径,有助于弥合丙烯供应和需求之间日益扩大的差距。随着PDH技术的不断成熟,未来的研究可以探索新的催化剂和工艺,在最大限度地减少成本和环境影响的同时,提高生产率。更广泛地采用可再生丙烷原料,也可能支持PDH产能的进一步扩张。 最终,跨生产、储存、运输和最终使用效率的多方面解决方案,将是满足丙烯在支持高分子材料、化学品和材料方面必不可少的作用所需的可持续发展方式。
