Based on the details provided in the file, most of the articles do not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. 

However, a few articles provide some relevant insights. The article with DOI 10.1016/j.apcatb.2012.11.005 shows that Pt/SBA-15 catalysts prepared by deposition-precipitation have much smaller Pt particles and better propane dehydrogenation performance compared to those prepared by wet impregnation. Another article (DOI 10.1021/acscatal.0c03391) demonstrates that applying ultrathin Al2O3 overcoats on Pt nanoparticles leads to increased stability and propylene selectivity. The optimal coating was 5-7 ALD cycles giving 6-8 Å thickness. 

The article with DOI 10.1016/j.jechem.2021.10.008 reveals how calcination and reduction treatments modulate metal-support interactions between Pt and boron nitride. This causes partial encapsulation of Pt particles by BOx species, which constrains particle size and blocks low-coordinated sites. As a result, side reactions are suppressed leading to better selectivity and stability.

Overall, the file shows tuning factors like particle size, composition, metal-support interactions, and surface capping are important for optimizing propane dehydrogenation catalysts. However, more research is still needed to fully elucidate these structure-function relationships. Promising directions include stabilization of isolated metal sites, core-shell architectures, and characterization under working conditions.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The articles cited in this file provide a glimpse into how rational design and characterization of supported metal catalysts could unlock superior propane dehydrogenation performance. Key catalysis descriptors like site isolation, ensemble size control and metal-support interplay are beginning to come under the spotlight. Further integration of novel synthetic strategies with advanced in situ/operando probes can expand this knowledge base. Burgeoning frontiers like single atom alloy catalysis, dynamic strain effects and spectro-microkinetic assessments may also foster additional breakthroughs leading to next-generation catalysts tailored for propane dehydrogenation.

根据文件提供的详细信息,大多数文章没有调查诸如金属粒子大小、形状和载体相互作用等特性如何影响SUPPORTED金属催化剂对丙烷脱氢的性能。

然而,一些文章提供了一些相关的见解。DOI 10.1016/j.apcatb.2012.11.005的文章表明,通过沉淀法制备的Pt/SBA-15催化剂比通过湿式浸渍法制备的催化剂Pt颗粒更小,丙烷脱氢性能更好。另一篇文章(DOI 10.1021/acscatal.0c03391)表明,在Pt纳米粒子上施加超薄Al2O3涂层可以提高稳定性和丙烯选择性。最佳涂层是5-7 ALD循环,厚度为6-8 Å。

DOI 10.1016/j.jechem.2021.10.008的文章揭示了煅烧和还原处理如何调节Pt和氮化硼之间的金属载体相互作用。这导致Pt颗粒被BOx种类部分包封。这限制了颗粒大小,阻挡了低配位位点。因此,抑制了副反应,提高了选择性和稳定性。

总的来说,该文件表明调节诸如颗粒大小、组成、金属载体相互作用和表面包层等因素对优化丙烷脱氢催化剂至关重要。然而,要全面阐明这些结构-功能关系仍需要进一步研究。前景看好的研究方向包括稳定隔离的金属位点、核壳体系结构和工作条件下的表征。

综合理解与未来展望:本文件中引用的文章提供了启示,即合理设计和表征SUPPORTED金属催化剂可以释放出卓越的丙烷脱氢性能。诸如位点隔离、组合块尺寸控制和金属载体相互作用等关键催化描述子开始受到关注。将新合成策略与先进的原位/原位探针技术进一步整合可以扩大这一知识库。新兴前沿如单原子合金催化、动态应变效应和光谱微观动力学评估也可以促进更多的突破,从而得出新的丙烷脱氢催化剂。
