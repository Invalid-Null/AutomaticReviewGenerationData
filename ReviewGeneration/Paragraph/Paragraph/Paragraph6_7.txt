The article with DOI [10.1021/acscatal.3c00939] presents microkinetic models of propane dehydrogenation using DFT-derived parameters. It discusses rate equations, surface coverages, turnover frequencies, selectivities, and rate-controlling steps. 

Additionally, the study with DOI [10.1021/acscatal.3c00889] performs microkinetic simulations using the CATKINAS package based on parameters from DFT calculations to evaluate the kinetics and practical applicability of single-atom catalysts for propane dehydrogenation under industrial conditions.

Furthermore, the work cited in [10.1021/acscatal.1c01916] shows how microkinetic modeling efforts on Pt alloy surfaces have used propane first dehydrogenation barriers as a proxy for activity along with a propylene descriptor to reveal a useful trade-off relationship for identifying optimal PDH catalysts.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The microkinetic modeling efforts discussed have provided valuable insights into propane dehydrogenation kinetics on specific catalysts. However, there is ample room to expand these approaches to screen and evaluate even broader classes of materials. Emerging high-throughput DFT calculations coupled with automated microkinetic modeling could rapidly assess kinetics across diverse catalyst compositions and structures. Machine learning models trained on such datasets might further accelerate identification of optimal catalyst candidates. Kinetic experiments and reactor modeling incorporating additional complexities of industrial environments could guide translation of these fundamental insights into practical optimizations.
