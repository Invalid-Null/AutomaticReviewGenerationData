 Here is a draft review section on propane dehydrogenation catalysts emphasizing the importance of propylene production:

<example>
	<English>
		Propylene is an essential organic feedstock for producing chemicals like polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acetone, etc., underpinning a market valued at over $100 billion annually [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]. However, conventional production routes via naphtha cracking struggle to meet the rapidly rising global demand, projected to further increase by 45% until 2030 [Placeholder_Of_DOI19]. In this context, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as an economically and environmentally attractive pathway to generate on-purpose propylene by exploiting abundant supplies of propane from shale gas [Placeholder_Of_DOI6, Placeholder_Of_DOI15].
		※※※		
		Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the growing propylene supply-demand gap that PDH technologies seek to address, an opportunity exists to explore novel catalysts and processes for enhanced propane conversion, selectivity and longevity. Future innovations might involve multicomponent systems with synergistic metal-oxide interfaces [Placeholder_Of_DOI7], or shift focus to sustainable biomass-based propane sources. Broader adoption of PDH could be enabled through decentralized production modules to meet regional demands.

		丙烯是生产丙烯酸、聚丙烯、丙酮、丙烯醚等化学品的重要有机原料,其市场价值超过1000亿美元/年 [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]。然而,常规的蒸汽裂解生产路线很难满足全球迅速增长的需求,预计到2030年还将增加45% [Placeholder_Of_DOI19]。在这种情况下,丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为一种经济高效且环境友好的途径,能够利用页岩气中丰富的丙烷原料来产生规模化丙烯,极具发展前景 [Placeholder_Of_DOI6, Placeholder_Of_DOI15]。		
		※※※
		综合理解与未来展望:鉴于PDH技术试图解决日益扩大的丙烯供需缺口,我们有机会开发新型催化剂和工艺来提高丙烷的转化率、选择性和使用寿命。未来的创新可能涉及具有协同效应的金属与氧化物界面多组分系统 [Placeholder_Of_DOI7],或关注可持续的生物质丙烷来源。通过分散的生产模块满足区域需求,能够推动PDH的更广泛应用。

I have synthesized key ideas from the file to highlight the value of propylene and the potential of PDH technologies to help meet growing demand. The outlook section offers suggestions on promising research directions like novel catalysts and sustainable feedstocks. Please let me know if you would like me to modify or refine anything.
