Propylene is an essential chemical feedstock with a wide range of applications in the production of polymers, chemicals, and plastic products. As stated in [10.1021/acscatal.3c00103], it is a key material for manufacturing polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acetone, and other derivatives. The market size for propylene is over $100 billion annually according to [10.1021/jacs.2c03941], underscoring its immense value in the chemical industry. 

However, propylene supply has struggled to keep pace with rapidly rising global demand in recent years. Traditional production routes like steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking are operating at maximum capacity and unable to bridge the deficit [10.1021/acscatal.3c00816]. This has led to growing interest in alternative technologies. 

One promising option is propane dehydrogenation (PDH) which converts abundant supplies of propane into propylene. As elucidated in [10.1021/acscatal.0c01455], PDH provides a route to generate propylene feedstock from low-cost shale gas and natural gas liquids. Some sources have indicated PDH could account for over 10% of propylene production moving forward [10.1002/advs.202207756]. From an economic and environmental standpoint, PDH is an attractive choice versus conventional cracking processes [10.1021/acscatal.3c00889].

In summary, propylene is a ubiquitous chemical intermediate that is only expected to grow in demand over time. Propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a critical route to supplement traditional propylene production, offering a more sustainable and cost-effective alternative aligned with changing raw material availability. There remains substantial opportunity to further develop PDH technology and improve catalytic performance.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Propane dehydrogenation has demonstrated excellent promise as a route for on-purpose propylene generation. However, widespread adoption faces issues like heat management, catalyst deactivation, and selectivity that must still be addressed. Future research might explore the integration of novel materials like metal-organic frameworks to enhance activity and stability. Operando spectroscopy techniques could provide new insights into working catalysts. Machine learning algorithms also have untapped potential for accelerated screening and optimization. In addition, more work is needed on reactor and process intensification. Modular PDH units that are compact and transportable could unlock smaller-scale distributed production. New reactor concepts like membrane reactors might also improve conversion and yield. There are still many open questions, but the fundamental drivers underpinning PDH's rise will persist.

丙烯是一种应用广泛的化学基料,被广泛用于生产聚合物、化学品和塑料产品。如[10.1021/acscatal.3c00103]所述,它是制造聚丙烯、丙烯醇、丙烯腈、丙酮和其他衍生物的关键材料。 根据[10.1021/jacs.2c03941]的分析,其年市场规模超过1,000亿美元,突显了其在化工行业的巨大价值。

然而,随着全球需求的快速增长,丙烯的供应一直难以跟上步伐。 传统的裂解生产途径难以弥补这一缺口[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816]。这引起了人们对替代技术的兴趣。

一个有前途的选择是丙烷脱氢(PDH)工艺,它可以将丰富的丙烷转化为丙烯。如[10.1021/acscatal.0c01455]所述,PDH技术为利用页岩气和天然气液体等低成本原料生产丙烯提供了捷径。一些报道表明,PDH未来可能占丙烯产量的10%以上[10.1002/advs.202207756]。与传统裂解工艺相比,PDH在经济和环保方面都是极具吸引力的选择[10.1021/acscatal.3c889]。

总的来说,丙烯是一种无处不在的化学中间体,其需求预计仍将继续增长。 丙烷脱氢已成为补充传统丙烯生产的重要途径,提供了更可持续和经济高效的替代方案,它与原材料供应的变化趋势紧密相连。 PDH技术和催化性能的改进仍有巨大的机遇。

综合理解与未来展望: 丙烷脱氢法显示了极大的潜力,它使得丙烯的目的生产成为可能。但是,大规模采用仍面临热管理、催化剂失活和选择性等问题。未来的研究或许可以探索如金属有机骨架材料等新型材料以提高活性和稳定性。体相光谱技术可以提供催化剂反应新见解。机器学习算法在加速筛选和优化方面也潜力未得到充分利用。此外,反应器和工艺过程集成领域也需要更多的工作。小型模块化PDH单元可以实现更分散、更具移动性的产能。膜反应器等新型反应器也许可以提高转化率和收率。尽管仍有许多未解之谜,但推动PDH产业发展的基本驱动力将会持续存在。
