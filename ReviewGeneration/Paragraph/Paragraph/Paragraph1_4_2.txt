Propylene is an essential raw material for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acetone, etc., with an estimated global market size exceeding $100 billion annually [Placeholder_Of_DOI2]. However, there is a growing supply-demand gap for propylene that conventional production routes like naphtha cracking cannot satisfy, especially with crude oil consumption outpacing supply [Placeholder_Of_DOI1]. This has led to great interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an alternative process to generate propylene by exploiting abundant and low-cost supplies of propane from shale gas [Placeholder_Of_DOI3]. PDH provides an economically competitive and environmentally friendly pathway for on-purpose propylene production to meet current and future industrial demands [Placeholder_Of_DOI4].
※※※  
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Propane dehydrogenation has demonstrated excellent potential as a route to alleviate propylene shortages and augment production capacity. As PDH technology matures, ongoing research should optimize catalysts to improve conversion, selectivity, and stability while lowering operating temperatures. Emerging opportunities also exist to couple PDH with downstream conversion of propylene to high-value chemicals. Process intensification methods like membrane separations may help overcome thermodynamic limitations. Technoeconomic analyses comparing PDH to alternatives will further validate implementation scenarios and investment prospects.

丙烯是生产各种化学品(如丙烯、丙烯腈、丙二醇、丙酮等)的重要原料,其全球市场规模估计超过1000亿美元[Placeholder_Of_DOI2]。但是,丙烯的供需差距日益扩大,常规生产途径如裂解生产无法满足(尤其是原油消费超过供应)[Placeholder_Of_DOI1]。这引起了人们对丙烷脱氢(PDH)的极大兴趣,作为一种利用页岩气中丰富廉价丙烷生产丙烯的替代工艺[Placeholder_Of_DOI3]。PDH提供了一种经济有竞争力且环境友好的专用丙烯生产途径,以满足当前和未来的产业需求[Placeholder_Of_DOI4]。

综合理解与未来展望:丙烷脱氢表现出极大潜力,能够缓解丙烯短缺并增加产能。随着PDH技术的成熟,当前的研究应该优化催化剂以提高转换率、选择性和稳定性,同时降低操作温度。转化丙烯生成高价值化学品也提供了新的机遇。过程强化方法(如膜分离)有助于克服反应的热力学限制。经济技术分析可进一步验证PDH的实施方案和投资前景。
