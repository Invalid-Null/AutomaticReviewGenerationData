Based on the analysis from reference [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.008], linear regressions between the formation energies of reaction intermediates were performed to identify the ethyl and methylidyne adsorption energies as optimal descriptors correlating catalyst properties to propane dehydrogenation performance. The highest R2 values and lowest variance were achieved using these descriptors. 

Additional structure-activity relationships were revealed through computational modeling of single-atom catalysts, as described in [10.1021/acscatal.3c00889]. A volcano-type activity trend was found with respect to the propylene adsorption energy Ead(C3H6) across transition metal anchored nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts. This suggests tuning the catalyst binding strength can optimize dehydrogenation activity.

Experiments paired with DFT calculations in [10.1021/acscatal.0c01455] elucidated effects of catalyst composition and oxidation state on individual reaction pathways. Metal dispersion, loading, and support were also correlated to performance in [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The current findings showcase promising pathways for rational catalyst design through quantitative structure-activity relationships. While linear scaling relations and volcano plots have proven insightful, expanding the theory and model systems to better represent real-world complexity poses an enduring challenge. An integrated approach coupling high-throughput computations with controlled synthesis and characterization appears indispensible moving forward. Incorporating machine learning into this framework could further augment human intuition and efficiently navigate vast chemical spaces. Overall there lies immense opportunity at the intersection of theory and experiment.

根据参考文献[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.008]的分析,在反应中间体的形成能之间进行线性回归,以识别乙基和甲基炔基吸附能作为与丙烷脱氢性能相关的最佳描述符。使用这些描述符达到了最高的R2值和最小的方差。

通过对单原子催化剂的计算建模又揭示了额外的结构-活性关系,如[10.1021/acscatal.3c00889]中所述。在过渡金属锚定在氮掺杂碳催化剂上的普罗皮烯吸附能Ead(C3H6)上发现了一种火山型的活性趋势。这表明调谐催化剂的结合强度可以优化脱氢活性。


在[10.1021/acscatal.0c01455]中,实验配合DFT计算阐明了催化剂成分和氧化态对各个反应途径的影响。 金属分散度、载量和载体也与性能相关,如[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999]。

综合理解与未来展望:当前的发现展示了通过定量结构-活性关系进行理性催化剂设计的有前途的路径。尽管线性缩放关系和火山图证明了有见地,但将理论和模型系统扩展到更好地表示真实复杂性的挑战仍在持续。 综合方法,将高通量计算与受控合成和表征相结合,在继续前进中似乎不可或缺。 将机器学习纳入此框架中,还可以进一步增强人类直觉,并有效地浏览巨大的化学空间。 总的来说,理论和实验的交叉点蕴藏着巨大的机遇。
