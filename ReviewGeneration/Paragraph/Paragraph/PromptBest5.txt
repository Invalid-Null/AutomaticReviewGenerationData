Here is a draft review section on propane dehydrogenation catalysts, with a focus on how DFT calculations have been applied to explore reaction mechanisms and pathways:

Multiple studies have utilized density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and kinetics over various catalysts. For instance, calculations revealed that Zn-O-Zn sites in specific catalysts possess lower activation barriers (1.81 eV) compared to single Zn2+ sites (2.14 eV), correlating well with experimental observations [10.1021/acscatal.3c00816]. Additionally, DFT energies showed that electron-enriched Pt catalysts have more negative d-band centers, with the d-band center value inversely related to propylene selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.3c00816]. More broadly, DFT-derived descriptors enabled quantitative structure-activity relationships, identifying key variables that control selectivity [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.008]. 

Microkinetic models constructed from computed barriers and energetics provided critical mappings between microscopic mechanistic steps and macroscopic catalytic performance [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.008]. For example, DFT elucidated that the direct propane dehydrogenation route is kinetically favored over the indirect pathway on certain catalysts [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019]. Notably, spin-polarized DFT calculations elucidated the stability and reactivity of 3N-coordinated single-atom catalysts for propane dehydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.3c00889].

Computations also revealed co-adsorbates like carbon can drastically impact barriers [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331], while characterizations of model PtSn surfaces provided explanations for favorable selectivity and coking resistance experimentally observed in propane dehydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331]. More recently, DFT-calculated descriptors enabled quantitative comparisons of propylene binding against barriers for unselective dehydrogenation routes across surfaces, pinpointing the kinetic relevance of specific mechanistic steps [10.1021/acscatal.1c01916].

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The detailed DFT explorations summarized above underscore the utility of modern computational techniques in unraveling propane dehydrogenation mechanisms, descriptors, and structure-activity insights across an array of catalysts. While existing efforts have greatly enhanced fundamental comprehension, there remain opportunities to leverage cutting-edge methodologies. 

For instance, researchers could apply machine learning models in tandem with DFT databases to rapidly predict selectivity trends. Dynamic simulations of defective surfaces over long time spans may also elicit valuable discoveries related to deactivation and coking. Lastly, high-throughput DFT screening of novel single-atom and Mo-based formulations could unlock additional practical catalyst candidates. Overall, by interfacing computational developments with existing knowledge, future undertakings can potentially overcome present-day limitations in propane dehydrogenation systems.

Propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways have been extensively studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, providing valuable insights into the reaction kinetics and selectivity over different catalysts. 

DFT reveals lower energy barriers for propane dehydrogenation over Zn-O-Zn sites compared to single Zn2+ sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00816], explaining the superior catalytic performance of the former. Calculations also demonstrate correlation between Pt's downshifted d-band center and improved propylene selectivity on electron-enriched Pt surfaces [10.1021/acscatal.3c00816]. Microkinetic modeling bridging DFT energetics and experimental data offers comprehensive structure-activity relationships, where scaling relations connect adsorption energies to macroscopic catalytic behavior [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.008].

DFT coupled with computational screening has been successfully utilized to discover improved propane dehydrogenation catalysts like 3N-coordinated single atom catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.3c00889]. Studies employ spin-polarized DFT with pseudopotentials to model reaction pathways, revealing insights into coke-resistance and stability. Kinetically relevant steps like propane C-H activation, propylene C-H activation and propyne C-C cleavage were identified through microkinetic analyses on Pt [10.1021/acscatal.1c01916].

Computations also provided mechanistic perspectives into promoting effects of metal additives. DFT calculations on Rh-doped ZrO2 suggested facile lattice oxygen migration from zirconia in presence of Rh explaining enhanced redox capability [10.1021/acscatal.0c01455]. Analogous studies have screened myriad potential catalysts like PtSn surfaces using scaling relations and electronic structure analyses while continually expanding the computational methodologies.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Propane dehydrogenation mechanisms have been effectively elucidated using DFT calculations, relating electronic structure to reactivity via scaling relationships and microkinetic models. However, most studies are limited to model surfaces under idealized conditions. Advanced multi-scale techniques can integrate more realistic surface structures, adsorbate configurations and experimental parameters into simulations. Coupled with high-throughput screening and machine learning, this can exponentially enhance the discovery of optimal catalyst compositions and architectures for propane dehydrogenation. Exploring reaction networks through graph theoretical methods and customized reactivity descriptors also offers new horizons.
