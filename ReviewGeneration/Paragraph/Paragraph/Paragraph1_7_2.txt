Propylene is a crucial chemical feedstock utilized for generating various products like polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, etc., underpinning a market valued at over $100 billion annually [Placeholder_of_DOI2]. However, conventional production routes via naphtha cracking struggle to meet the rapidly rising demands, which are projected to further increase by 2-3% each year till 2030 [Placeholder_of_DOI3]. 

To address this supply-demand disparity, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as an economically viable and eco-friendly pathway leveraging abundant propane reserves from shale gas [Placeholder_of_DOI7]. PDH currently contributes 10% of global propylene supplies [Placeholder_of_DOI15], with substantial room for growth in light of swelling propylene requirements [Placeholder_of_DOI18].

Several catalyst compositions have been explored for facilitating this endothermic equilibrium reaction, including chromium oxide [Placeholder_of_DOI2], platinum-tin [Placeholder_of_DOI2], and more. However, widespread industrial deployment necessitates addressing various challenges like rapid deactivation via coking, low propylene yields, etc. Ongoing research aims to develop optimized PDH catalysts boasting resistance against deactivating agents and delivering high productivity and selectivity.

Considering propylene's rising prominence as a foundational petrochemical and PDH's promise as an emerging production route, upcoming years may witness significant R&D investments tailored for this reaction. Efforts might involve applying state-of-the-art characterization tools like in situ spectroscopy for gleaning mechanistic insights to guide catalyst design. Harnessing computational quantum chemistry models can accelerate screening novel compositions. Exploring unconventional supports like metal-organic frameworks may mitigate coking. Overall, by consolidating existing know-how and leveraging cutting-edge techniques, PDH catalysis harbors exciting opportunities for contributing to propylene's expanding role.

丙烯是制备各种产品(如丙烯腈、聚丙烯、丙烯醇、丙烯醚等)的关键化学原料,其年市场价值超过1000亿美元[Placeholder_of_DOI2]。然而,传统的裂化生产路线很难满足快速增长的市场需求,预计到2030年,每年的增长率将达到2-3% [Placeholder_of_DOI3]。

为解决这种供需失衡,丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为一种经济实惠、环保的新途径,利用页岩气中丰富的丙烷储量[Placeholder_of_DOI7],目前已贡献全球10%的丙烯供应[Placeholder_of_DOI15],并有很大的增长空间,以满足快速增长的丙烯需求[Placeholder_of_DOI18]。

已经探索了几种催化剂组合来促进这一吸热的平衡反应,包括铬氧化物[Placeholder_of_DOI2]、铂锡[Placeholder_of_DOI2]等。然而,要实现大规模工业应用,仍需解决各种挑战,如快速失活(结焦)、丙烯收率低等。当前的研究目标是开发优化的PDH催化剂,具有抗失活性,并能提供高生产力和选择性。

考虑到丙烯作为基础石化品的日益重要性,以及 PDH作为新兴生产途径的前景,在未来几年中,可能会看到大量研发投资专门用于这一反应。努力的方向可能包括应用前沿表征技术(如原位光谱学)来获得反应机理信息以指导催化剂设计。利用计算化学模型可以加速新组合的筛选。探索非常规载体(如金属有机框架体)可能减轻结焦。总体而言,通过汇集现有知识并利用尖端技术,PDH催化有望为丙烯不断扩大的作用做出贡献。
