Based on the details provided in the file, none of the articles explored the use of subsurface promoters like Re or Mn in bimetallic and alloy catalysts to tune selectivity. Most articles focused solely on the bimetallic catalysts without any subsurface promoters. 

Specifically, reference [10.1021/jacs.8b08162] showed that a Pt3Mn subsurface significantly improved propane dehydrogenation selectivity over Pt by lowering hydrocarbon/hydrogen adsorption heats. Models were presented to demonstrate the role of distinct subsurface layers in altering surface chemistry and selectivity. However, this was the only study that explored subsurface tuning and provided relevant data.

The remaining articles did not provide any examples or insights into using subsurface promoters like Re or Mn to optimize selectivity in bimetallic and alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The file clearly stated that no relevant quotes, data, or discussions were found across these other articles regarding the research question posed.

While subsurface promoters were generally not explored for tuning selectivity, the one example with Pt3Mn subsurface layers highlights an interesting area for further research. As catalyst design progresses to manipulate subsurface architecture in addition to surface composition and structure, new opportunities may emerge to strategically place promoters in subsurface sites. This could enable precise tuning of binding energies and surface reactivity toward targeted products. 

Additionally, new characterization techniques and advanced simulations to probe subsurface sites could uncover detailed mechanistic pathways on how subsurface promoters alter selectivity. Such insights can guide rational subsurface promoter selection and placement within different bimetallic systems to optimize selectivity for key reactions like propane dehydrogenation. Exploring these research directions can expand the toolkit for selectively transforming alkanes into value-added olefins.

根据文件提供的详细信息,这些文章都没有探索在双金属和合金催化剂中使用Re或Mn等亚表面促进剂来调节选择性。大多数文章仅专注于没有任何亚表面促进剂的双金属催化剂。

具体而言,参考文献[10.1021/jacs.8b08162]表明,与Pt相比,Pt3Mn亚表面层可以通过降低烃/氢吸附热显著提高丙烷脱氢的选择性。提出了模型来演示不同亚表面层在改变表面化学和选择性方面的作用。然而,这是唯一一个探索了亚表面调控并提供了相关数据的研究。

其余文章没有提供任何示例或关于使用Re或Mn等亚表面促进剂来优化丙烷脱氢双金属和合金催化剂选择性的见解。文件清楚地说明,在这些其他文章中没有发现与提出的研究问题相关的引用、数据或讨论。

虽然亚表面促进剂的调控未得到广泛的探索,但Pt3Mn亚表面层的那个例子为进一步研究提供了一个有趣的领域。随着催化剂设计的进步,在操纵亚表面结构的同时也进一步调整表面组成和结构,可能会出现机会在亚表面位点战略性地放置促进剂。这可以实现对目标产物的结合能量和表面反应性的精确调控。

此外,用于探测亚表面位点的新表征技术和先进模拟,可以揭示亚表面促进剂如何改变选择性的详细机理途径。这种见解可指导选择和配​​置不同双金属体系中合理的亚表面促进剂,以优化关键反应(如丙烷脱氢)的选择性。探索这些研究方向可扩展用于选择性转化烷烃为高附加值烯烃的工具包。
