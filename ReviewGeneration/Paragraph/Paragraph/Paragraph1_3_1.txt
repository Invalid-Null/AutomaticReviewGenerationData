Propylene is an essential raw material in the chemical industry, serving as a precursor for manufacturing a wide range of products including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acetone, and more [Placeholder_Of_DOI2, Placeholder_Of_DOI15]. Global propylene demand in 2022 stood at nearly 150 million metric tons, with utilization concentrated in Asia, and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of over 4% through 2030 in order to satisfy burgeoning end-use application requirements [Placeholder_Of_DOI27]. However, conventional production routes via steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking struggle to meet escalating requirements, constrained by crude oil supply dynamics [Placeholder_Of_DOI2].  

In this context, on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has garnered attention as an alternative pathway to harness the copious propane reserves unlocked by the shale gas revolution, already claiming around 10% of total propylene output [Placeholder_Of_DOI27]. PDH facilitates direct conversion of propane to propylene, leveraging an array of heterogeneous catalysts, typically based on chromium or platinum, to selectively cleave the C-H bond. Compared to conventional thermal cracking processes, PDH can deliver higher propylene yields in a more economical and eco-friendly manner [Placeholder_Of_DOI8]. Commercial PDH units based on the Catofin and Oleflex processes are currently in operation. 

However, propane dehydrogenation faces inherent challenges due to the endothermic nature of the reaction and equilibrium limitations, necessitating high temperatures around 500-600°C to attain adequate conversion levels [Placeholder_Of_DOI26]. This exacerbates catalyst coking and sintering, shortening lifespan. Accordingly, extensive research efforts seek to develop optimized catalysts that balance activity, selectivity, and stability at reduced temperatures.

Recent advances in characterization techniques and computational modeling unlock new opportunities to derive fundamental mechanistic insights and precisely engineer catalytic active phase nanostructures and interfaces [Placeholder_Of_DOI41]. This fusion of knowledge-driven design and experimentation paves the way for customized catalyst formulations tailored to intensified PDH processes, unlocking previously unattainable combinations of conversion, yield, and durability [Placeholder_Of_DOI30]. Integration of process intensification principles to overcome equilibrium restrictions also offers promise. An outlook focused on sustainability further necessitates innovations in catalyst recyclability and utilization of renewable propane feedstocks.

丙烯是化学工业中一种必不可少的原材料,可用于生产各种产品,如丙烯、丙烯醇、丙烯腈、丙酮等[Placeholder_Of_DOI2,Placeholder_Of_DOI15]。2022年全球丙烯需求近1.5亿吨,主要集中在亚洲,预计到2030年的复合年增长率将超过4%,以满足不断增长的终端应用需求[Placeholder_Of_DOI27]。然而,常规的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解路线难以满足日益增长的需求,受原油供应动态的制约[Placeholder_Of_DOI2]。

在这种背景下,煤气传热裂解(PDH)以其丰富的丙烷储量而备受关注,这些储量是页岩气革命所带来的,已占據整体丙烯产出的约10%[Placeholder_Of_DOI27]。PDH促进了丙烷向丙烯的直接转化,利用各种异质催化剂(通常以铬或铂为基础)选择性地断裂C-H键。与常规的热解工艺相比,PDH可以以更加经济和环保的方式获得更高的丙烯收率[Placeholder_Of_DOI8]。Catofin和Oleflex工艺的商业PDH装置目前正在运营。

然而,丙烷脱氢存在内在的挑战,这是由于反应的吸热特性和平衡限制,需要大约500-600°C的高温才能获得足够的转化率[Placeholder_Of_DOI26]。这会加剧催化剂结焦和烧结,缩短使用寿命。因此,广泛的研究工作寻求开发优化的催化剂,在较低温度下可以平衡活性、选择性和稳定性。

先进的表征技术和计算模型为深入了解基本机理和精确设计催化活性相纳米结构及界面奠定了基础[Placeholder_Of_DOI41]。这种知识驱动设计和实验的融合开辟了道路,可定制适合PDH工艺强化的催化剂配方,实现过去难以达到的转化率、收率和稳定性的组合[Placeholder_Of_DOI30]。采用工艺强化原理来克服平衡限制也很有前景。关注可持续发展的前景进一步需要催化剂循环利用率方面的创新和可再生丙烷原料的利用。
