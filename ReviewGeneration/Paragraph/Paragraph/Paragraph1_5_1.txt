Propylene is an essential raw material for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acetone, etc., with an estimated annual market size exceeding $100 billion [Placeholder_of_DOI2]. However, there is a growing supply-demand gap for propylene that is projected to reach 60 megatons by 2030, as traditional production routes like steam cracking of naphtha struggle to keep pace with rapidly rising demand [Placeholder_of_DOI11]. 

The advent of hydraulic fracturing technologies has unlocked abundant and low-cost supplies of propane in shale gas, creating major opportunities for on-purpose propylene production through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [Placeholder_of_DOI3]. PDH provides a promising and effective pathway to alleviate propylene shortages by exploiting propane feedstocks, and already accounts for 10% of global propylene output [Placeholder_of_DOI11]. By operating at high temperatures of 500-600°C, PDH can achieve sufficient conversion of propane to propylene, despite the unfavorable reaction thermodynamics [Placeholder_of_DOI19]. Multiple PDH processes have been commercialized like the Catofin, Oleflex, and Shawinigan technologies [Placeholder_of_DOI13].

Overall, propylene production via propane dehydrogenation serves as an economically competitive and environmentally-friendly means of generating this valuable olefin to meet ever-rising industrial demands [Placeholder_of_DOI7]. With shale gas bringing lower propane costs, PDH forms a crucial growth avenue for the multi-billion dollar propylene market going forward.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Capitalizing on increasing propane supplies from shale gas, propane dehydrogenation can substantially augment propylene availability to bridge supply shortfalls for this vital petrochemical [Placeholder_of_DOI3, Placeholder_of_DOI11]. While present PDH units operate at high temperatures with chromium-based catalysts, next-generation PDH technologies might investigate alternative catalyst compositions with higher activity and stability for milder, more selective reaction conditions [Placeholder_of_DOI19]. 

Furthermore, shale gas apenas and light fractions could be assessed as potential propane sources, aimed at lowering feedstock expenses. Techno-economic evaluations can optimize process configurations to improve commercial viability. In the long run, renewable propane produced through gasification or biological routes could also be evaluated as sustainable PDH feeds. Thereby, propane dehydrogenation is poised to command a larger contribution in fulfilling rising demands for propylene and its numerous derivatives.

丙烯是生产各种化学品(如聚丙烯、丙烯醇、丙烯腈、丙酮等)的重要原料,其年市场规模估计超过1000亿美元 [Placeholder_of_DOI2]。然而,丙烯的供需缺口正在扩大,预计到2030年将达到60百万吨,因为裂解石脑等传统生产途径无法跟上快速增长的需求[Placeholder_of_DOI11]。 

水力压裂技术的出现解锁了页岩气中丰富且低成本的丙烷供应,为通过丙烷脱氢(PDH)目标生产丙烯创造了重大机遇[Placeholder_of_DOI3]。PDH提供了一个有前途和有效的途径,通过利用丙烷原料来缓解丙烯短缺,已占全球丙烯产量的10% [Placeholder_of_DOI11]。通过在500-600°C的高温下运行,PDH可以实现足够的丙烷转化为丙烯,尽管反应热力学不利[Placeholder_of_DOI19]。已商业化的多种PDH工艺,如Catofin、Oleflex 和 Shawinigan技术[Placeholder_of_DOI13]。

总体而言,通过丙烷脱氢生产丙烯是一种经济有竞争力和环境友好的方法,用于生产这种重要的烯烃,以满足日益增长的工业需求 [Placeholder_of_DOI7]。随着页岩气带来更低的丙烷成本,在未来PDH将成为数十亿美元丙烯市场的关键增长途径。

综合理解与未来展望: 充分利用页岩气中日益增长的丙烷供应,丙烷脱氢可以大大增加丙烯的可获得性,以弥补这种重要石化原料的供应短缺 [Placeholder_of_DOI3, Placeholder_of_DOI11]。当前的PDH单元在高温下运转,使用铬基催化剂,下一代PDH技术可以研究替代催化剂组成,以实现较高的活性和稳定性,用于更温和、更选择性的反应条件[Placeholder_of_DOI19]。此外,可以评估页岩气烃和轻馏分作为丙烷来源,旨在降低原料费用。技术经济评估可以优化工艺配置以提高商业可行性。从长远来看,通过气化或生物路线生产的可再生丙烷也可以评估为可持续的PDH原料。因此,丙烷脱氢注定在满足日益增长的丙烯及其众多衍生物的需求中发挥更大的作用。
