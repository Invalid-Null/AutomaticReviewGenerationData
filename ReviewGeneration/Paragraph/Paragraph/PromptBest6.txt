Microkinetic modeling efforts have elucidated the propane dehydrogenation kinetics and practical applicability of various catalysts, utilizing parameters from DFT calculations \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00939, 10.1021/acscatal.3c00889\]. The models simulate rate equations and surface coverages to determine turnover frequencies, selectivities, and rate-controlling steps [10.1021/acscatal.3c00939]. Descriptors based on formation energies have also been employed to screen and rank the predicted catalytic activity [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.008]. On Pt alloy surfaces, propane’s first dehydrogenation barrier was evaluated as a proxy for activity, while propylene’s desorption and dehydrogenation barriers served as a selectivity descriptor [10.1021/acscatal.1c01916].

		With the advent of high-throughput computational screening and microkinetic models grounded in electronic structure calculations, there exist bountiful opportunities to explore novel compositions, facet-engineered surfaces, and single-atom catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Elucidating reaction mechanisms and kinetic parameters on such materials can unravel performance-structure correlations to guide optimal catalyst design. Beyond homogeneous catalysts, future efforts might also examine the coupled kinetics between metal active sites and acidic supports in bifunctional systems.
