[1] The Co@Si-BEA catalyst also demonstrates a great long-term catalytic stability in eight-time reaction-regeneration recycling test, not only highlighting the high structural stability of the catalyst active sites but also illustrating the reversible deactivation phenomenon caused by coke deposition.
         [2] Furthermore, since the characteristics of neither CoO reference (R = 2.6 Å for Co-(O)-Co bond) nor spinel Co3O4 reference (R = 2.5 and 3.0 Å for Co-(O)-Co bonds) were matched with the spectra of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA, the aggregated Co oxides could also be absent in the catalysts [18].

[1] "Co-MFI exhibits a high TOF of 124.3 h−1, which is comparable to that of some Pt-based catalysts and much higher than that of previously reported Co- and Cr-based catalysts, illustrating the excellent PDH performance of Co-MFI."
         [2] "The Cs-corrected TEM characterization of the spent Co-MFI zeolite (Figure 3f–h) after the sixth reaction-regeneration cycle shows the same micromorphology as that of the fresh Co-MFI zeolite (Figure 1). The STEM-EDS mapping images also reveal the homogeneous distribution of Co species in the spent Co-MFI (Figure 3h)."
         [3] "The cycle stability test demonstrates the high cycle stability of the Co-MFI catalyst."

[1] Bimetallic catalysts have attracted increasing attention in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to the synergistic effect of metal species and considerably improved catalytic performance, but they often suffer from severe sintering and poor stability.

[2] It is demonstrated that the stability of the encapsulated metal clusters can be significantly enhanced by the confinement effect of zeolites.

[4] Subsequent XAFS results on the catalyst precursors without H2 reduction clarified that skeleton-Ge-induced anchoring of guest Pt (from H2PtCl6) was the key to the formation of such PtOGe species.

         [5] The Pt-A-2h(31)-R catalyst showed the highest propane conversion together with the best stability.

[1] "Regioselective encapsulation contributes to a special structure with a core of a sub-nanometric Pt cluster and a shell of single-site Snδ+/Zn2+. This structure ensures that CC bond cleavage is shut down with no or minimal loss of the dehydrogenation activity."
      [2] "Metal clusters encapsulated in zeolites have attracted increasing attention because of their unique electronic properties with high stability, but diffusion limitation is the bottleneck in the utilization efficiency of active sites, especially in bulk crystals."

[1] "Encapsulation of Pt clusters within NaA was achieved via hydrothermal synthesis using ligand-stabilized platinum precursors."
         [2] "The HAADF-STEM image of spent Pt@NaA after 120h on-stream showed that the diameter of the majority of Pt clusters remained to be 1.1nm, while that of Pt particles supported on silica aggregated rapidly from 2.3nm to 6.1nm after only 25h on-stream." 
         [3] "This result clearly showed the superior sintering resistance of encapsulated Pt clusters, consistent with previous observations."

[1] "A catalyst consisting of nanometric bimetallic PtSn clusters encapsulated in K-MFI zeolite was synthesized via a one-pot direct synthesis using H2[PtCl6] and SnCl4·5H2O as precursors.140 After modulating the interaction between Pt and Sn through the introduction of partially reduced Sn species by adjusting the H2 treatment time, the PtSn nanoclusters were encapsulated in the 10R sinusoidal channels of S-1 zeolite, as determined by a combination of high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-HAADF-STEM) and iDPC imaging. This catalyst exhibited high stability and only slight propane conversion deactivation from 20% to 17% after 70 h."

[1] "Now, writing in Nature Catalysis, Wu and colleagues report a synthesis method for the stabilization of subnanometre Pt clusters in a zeolite matrix by employing the germanium-enriched double four-membered rings (Ge-d4rs) of UTL-type zeolite as the anchoring sites7."

      [2] "As shown in Fig. 1c, the optimum Pt/Ge-UTL catalyst exhibits remarkably high stability in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The exceptionally high stabilization of the Pt/Ge-UTL catalyst could be ascribed to the unique bonding between the Pt clusters and the Ge-d4r units, and the high structural rigidity of Ge-d4r units under reaction conditions."

[1] "The catalytic enhancement observed for the 1Pt1Zn/MZ catalyst seems to be mainly attributable to the formation of Pt1Zn1 intermetallic alloy nanoparticles."

         [2] "Recently, there have been several reports that use zeolite as a support material for Pt-based alloy catalysts in PDH."  
      
         [3] "Among those, we chose the sub-nanometer PtZn cluster catalyst encapsulated inside siliceous bulk MFI zeolite reported by Sun et al., which showed the highest stability among the state-of-the-art Pt-based PDH catalysts up to date."

"In this study, we have reported a conceptually designed catalyst composed of Pt species anchored via hydroxyl groups other than silanol nests. The isolated Pt atoms were stably bonded through the O framework in a hierarchical-like heteroatomic silicalite zeolite with a suitable acidity after subsequent calcination and reduction, which could achieve high propane conversions at different temperatures and atmospheres close to the thermodynamic limit."
         "Moreover, no significant deactivation was observed for 3 days in a pure propane atmosphere at 580 C, outperforming most of the cutting-edge Pt-based catalysts."  
         "The Fe-doped T4 site expressed a stronger Pt anchoring effect, and the Rietveld refinement of the SXRD data indicated the presence of other anchoring sites, such as T6."

[1] "Nevertheless, their size distributions (Fig. 5f-h) show that most of the small Pt NPs are still below 2 nm, indicating the high stability of encapsulated Pt species in MCM-22 crystallites during the very extreme oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C."
         [2] "In the case of Pt/MCM-22-imp, oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C lead to continuous growth of Pt NPs (images are presented from Supplementary Figs 19 to 22 and the size distributions of Pt NPs are shown in Supplementary Fig. 23)."
         [3] "As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 24, Pt@MCM-22 exhibits higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550°C. Moreover, after five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550°C during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, Pt@MCM-22 sample retains 90% of its initial activity while Pt/MCM-22-imp has lost more than 40% of its initial activity."

[1] "we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.5-0.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."

[2] "It will be shown that subtle changes in the structural features of the subnanometric PtSn clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional characterization techniques, can drastically affect their performance for propane dehydrogenation."  

[3] "the high initial activity, very slow deactivation and size of the subnanometric PtSn clusters were preserved for three reaction cycles."
