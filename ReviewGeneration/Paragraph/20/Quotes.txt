[1] In this study, three representative silica supports (amorphous SiO2, dealuminated Beta zeolite, and pure-silica MFI zeolite) are chosen as the solid carriers with different textural properties for accommodating the same amount of Pt and Sn species, resulting in the formation of supported PtSn catalysts with different structural features. 
[2] The use of Beta zeolite as the support instead of amorphous silica can effectively decrease the size of PtSn particles from 1.6 nm down to 0.9 nm, leading to the formation of PtSn bimetallic nanoclusters in the PtSn/Beta-600H2 sample.
[3] In the case of PtSn/MFI-600H2, subnanometer PtSn clusters located in the microporous channels are visualized in the high-resolution HAADF-STEM images with sizes of 0.50.6 nm.

[1] "The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization [30], [31]."

[1] "Here, we explored a hierarchical-like heteroatomic ferrosilicate (hierarchical-like-Fe-silicalite-1-n, H-Fe-S-1-n; n represents variable Fe content, denoted as Fe-n) with the specific ability to anchor Pt atoms, which allowed atomic-level dispersion primarily in the oxidized state."
         
         [2] "The introduction of Fe increased the stability of O interactions in the FeOSi bridge compared to the PtO interaction in the SiOSi bridge, leading to the formation of an active site (SiOPtOFe)."

The reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure, in the temperature range of 573773 K, C3H8/C6H6=1, and WHSV=0.27 h1. The conversion of propane and selectivity to propylbenzenes was found to increase in the following order of catalytic systems: H-MFI<(H-MFI+Pt/CeO2)<Pt/H-MFI<(Pt/H-MFI+Zr2Fe).

[1] In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance.

[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely applied in industrial PDH processes due to their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and the limited extent of CC bond cleavage."

         [2] "Zeolites, with a rigid microporous framework and high thermal stability, are considered as ideal supports to anchor sub-nanometric metal species." 

         [3] "Regioselective encapsulation contributes to a special structure with a core of a sub-nanometric Pt cluster and a shell of single-site Snδ+/Zn2+. This structure ensures that CC bond cleavage is shut down with no or minimal loss of the dehydrogenation activity. On these highly active catalysts, internal diffusion easily becomes the rate-limiting step. The encapsulated species in bulk zeolites often suffer from poor availability caused by small micropore size and long diffusion length."

[1] "Zn-containing zeolites with different zinc loadings, namely Zn@S-1, have been successfully prepared via ligand-protected direct hydrothermal route."
         
         [2] "Characterization results from FTIR, NMR, TEM, UVvis and XPS reveal that well-isolated zinc cations are trapped and efficiently stabilized by the Si-OH groups of S-1."
         
         [3] "The as-prepared Zn@S-1 zeolites are applied as potential PDH catalysts with zinc species as the exclusive active components."
         
         [4] "Zn-4@S-1 catalyst exhibits good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity and regeneration capability in PDH reaction."

[1] Zeolites are ideal supports for the PDH reaction with plenty of marvelous traits, including but not limited to their large surface area, ordered channels, and adjustable framework.
          [2] The hydroxyl nests on the dealuminated zeolite can be utilized for anchoring bimetallic PtM alloys.

[1] "We have recently shown (Qi , J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021, 143, 2136421378) that these objectives can be met for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using atomically dispersed Pt anchored to neighboring SiOZn-OH groups bonded to the framework of dealuminated zeolite BEA."

         [2] "In the present study, we demonstrate that significantly superior performance can be achieved using self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite nanosheets as supports." 

         [3] "Pt was added to 2.4Zn-SPP following the method described in the Experimental Section of the Supporting Information (SI). ICP data showed that all of the Pt was introduced onto the zeolite (Table S1). XRD (Figure S1) and BET measurements (Table S2) confirmed retention of the MFI zeolite framework and the surface area of the support after introduction of Pt."

         [4] "HAADF-STEM images, in combination with X-ray absorption spectra, demonstrate that Pt is stabilized predominantly as isolated atoms bonded to neighboring SiOZn-OH sites and that, upon H2 reduction, these sites form isolated (Si-O-Zn)4-5Pt species that are the active centers for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene and n-butane dehydrogenation (BDH) to 1,3-butadiene."

[1] "ZSM-5 and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 1–2), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size."

         [2] "The zeolitic framework surrounding the encapsulated Pt species suppressed propylene desorption, which reduces propylene selectivity and increases coke deposits." 

         [3] "The Pt3Ga intermetallic alloys on hierarchical zeolites exhibit an initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion), and the conversion remains >8% after 30 days of reaction."

         [4] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions."

[1] In recent years, zeolites such as SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 have been found to be good supports because of their high surface areas, good thermal stabilities, large pore volumes and tunable acidity [12, 13, 14].

[2] SUZ-4-supported catalysts have been widely used in many processes, such as the conversion of n-hexane [16], the synthesis of dimethyl ether from methanol [17], and the elimination of nitrogen oxides [18].

[3] PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability.

[1] Silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite, a purely siliceous zeolite, is MFI-type, featuring a channel of 5.6 × 5.1 Å (a little larger than propane, 4.7 Å), which is beneficial for propane adsorption and activation.
         
         [2] Well-distributed and ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters inside S-1 zeolites have been synthesized via a facile in situ synthesis approach. The 0.3Pt0.5Zn@S-1 catalyst shows outstanding catalytic performance in PDH, with a 45.3% propane conversion and a >99% selectivity to propene at 550 C due to ultrasmall PtZn bimetallic nanoclusters with a higher dehydrogenation activity.

The article evaluates the zeolite H-ZSM-5 support with different Si/Al ratios of 15 and 39 for propane dehydrogenation over Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. It provides data showing that Zn species exchange differently on H-ZSM-5 depending on the Si/Al ratio. On H-ZSM-5 with Si/Al=15, Zn2+ exchanges preferentially at paired Al sites, followed by [Zn-O-Zn]2+ and [ZnOH]+ species. On H-ZSM-5 with Si/Al=39, [ZnOH]+ species form initially. This demonstrates the effect of Al distribution and concentration in directing Zn speciation.

         [3] "Our results indicate that small PtSn clusters are in fact beneficial for PDH reaction and thus to stabilize and to increase their concentration should be the key goal to achieve. For this purpose, zeolite is unique in offering the geometrical confinement and the weak metal-support interaction."

[1] "Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO. This metal oxide and a support (zeolite or common metal oxide) are used as a physical mixture or in form of two layers with ZnO as the upstream layer."

         [2] "Using different complementary characterization methods, we identify the decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnOx species." 

         [3] "Further we demonstrate that our approach is of general character and can be applied for preparation of active Zn-containing catalysts using other SiO2-based zeolites, that is, dealuminated mordenite, Beta and MCM-22 or commercially available OH-rich metal oxides, such as Al2O3, TiO2, LaZrOx, TiZrOx and ZrO2SiO2."

[1] To address this problem, methods are still needed to reduce the acid content and strength by adding alkali (earth) metal. The application of new zeolites with lower acidity is still promising and important to the main reaction.
         [2] The TS-1 samples have no strong acid sites, as evident from the NH3 TPD curves shown in Fig. 5A. Only one desorption peak at 160 C is observed, corresponding to a weak acid site.
         [3] It is also worthwhile to note that the acid properties of the catalysts have a large effect on the catalytic performance including propane conversion, selectivity to propylene, and stability of the catalysts.

[1] "Herein, a novel strategy for the synthesis of highly stable Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is developed, which is realized by the stabilization of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn sites in the zeolite framework."
