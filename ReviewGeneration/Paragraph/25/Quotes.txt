The grafting synthesis was monitored by an in situ FTIR technique (Figure 1). In fact, the grafting of a HSnBu3 or Pt(COD)Me2 organometallic compound onto oxides is the well-established reaction. The grafting reaction takes place upon the protonolysis of a methyl group in Pt(COD)Me2 or the hydride group in HSnBu3, which leads to the formation of a SnBu3/oxide or Pt(COD)Me/oxide compound. Thus, it can be inferred that the sequential grafting of HSnBu3 and Pt(COD)Me2 organometallic complexes on to the dealuminated Beta zeolite gives rise to a Pt(COD)Me/SnBu3/Beta surface compound.

[1] In situ DRIFTS measurements were performed to investigate the changes in the Zn speciation during the induction period. Figure 2b shows that the intensity of the ZnOH hydroxyl band (13) at 3635 cm−1 decreases with increasing temperature during exposure to propane. Together with the erosion of the 3635 cm−1 band, a band at 1844 cm−1 appears, which can be attributed to the formation of [ZnH]+ (Zn-hydride) species. (21,22) The spectra point to the in situ transformation from zinc hydroxides ([ZnOH]+) to [ZnH]+ species during the PDH reaction, which was related to the observed induction periods in panel (a).

[1] In situ Au L3-edge X-ray adsorption fine-structure (XAFS) measurements were carried out at beamline BL9A of the Photon Factory in the Institute of Materials Structure Science, High-Energy Accelerator Research Organization (PF-IMSS-KEK) in Japan. All spectra were obtained in transmission mode using an in situ XAFS cell under reactions conditions.
[2] Fig. 7 presents the in situ Au L3-edge XANES difference spectra
(He, at 443 K before reaction). The figure demonstrates the evolution of some transient resonance in the initial stages of reaction and the development of two distinct negative features at 11,918 and 11,920 eV after 23 h of reaction.

[1] "In this study, we apply diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) with CO as a probe molecule to Ga/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and Ga37Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, to investigate in detail the nature of the active Pt species."

[1] "EPR revealed V4+O groups pointing out normally from the catalyst surface and sitting in the center of a surface array of oxygen atoms. These V4+ groups helped demonstrate the difference in catalytic behavior of the various samples."  
         [2] "Fig. 3 shows the EPR spectra at r.t. of sample V28Si: (a) as prepared, (b) after deoxygenation, (c) after catalytic use under anaerobic conditions and deoxygenation."
         [3] "The spectral intensity increased markedly after the catalytic reaction under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 3c); this can be explained by considering that the catalytically active centers are V5+, which reduce during reaction in the absence of co-fed oxygen, leading to an increase in the EPR-active V4+ species."
