[1] The catalytic activity of other catalysts varies in the order Rh ≈ Ir > Ni ≈ Pd > Cu > Au > Ag. The propylene selectivity map is defined as the propylene production rate divided by the propane consumption rate.

         [2] By using the formation energies of CH3CH2@(1 1 1) and CH@(2 1 1) as two descriptors, intermetallic compound catalysts have been screened and ranked for predicted activity.

[1] "Mean-field microkinetic models were generated to give information that can be directly compared to the experimental observation."
         [2] "To calculate the adsorption free energies, the free energies of the gas-phase species and the clean surface slab are subtracted from the free energy of the adsorbed species." 
         [3] "In all of the PtSn surface model simulations, the free sites made up more than 90% of the total sites present on each surface, and so, lateral interactions of surface species were not considered."

[1] Here, we carried out a comprehensive study combining first-principles calculations and microkinetic analysis to evaluate the practical applicability of 3N-coordinated single-atom catalysts for propane dehydrogenation under realistic industrial conditions.
         [2] The microkinetic simulations were performed using the CATKINAS package.
         [3] Applying these scaling relationships on the six TM1-N3/C (TM = Sc, Ti, Y, Zr, La, Hf) catalysts, we performed the microkinetic simulation and obtained a volcano-type activity trend with respect to Ead(C3H6) (Figure 3d).

[1] Gong and co-workers (31) have also carried out a trends-based study of PDH chemistry across a series of Pt3X(111) alloy surfaces.  
         [2] By evaluating the first dehydrogenation barrier of propane, which was used as a proxy for PDH activity, in addition to a selectivity descriptor comparing the desorption and dehydrogenation barriers of propylene, the authors demonstrated that there exists a negative correlation between these activity and selectivity descriptors and that Pt3In represents a useful trade-off between these two reactivity measures.
