{"Quotes": "[1] Therefore, to prepare the highly dispersed Pt-based catalyst, the silica support should be modified. In the present work, a simple in-situ emulsion method was developed to prepare the highly dispersed MnOx decorated dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (Mn-DMSN) support. And the highly dispersed Pt catalyst (Pt/Mn-DMSN) was obtained by incipient wetness impregnation method using H2PtCl6Â·6H2O as the precursor.", "English": "The article highlights modifying silica supports to enable preparation of highly dispersed Pt-based catalysts, using an in-situ emulsion method to decorate silica with MnOx for improved Pt cluster dispersion and stability.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.06.016"},
