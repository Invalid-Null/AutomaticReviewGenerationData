[1] Therefore, to prepare the highly dispersed Pt-based catalyst, the silica support should be modified. In the present work, a simple in-situ emulsion method was developed to prepare the highly dispersed MnOx decorated dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (Mn-DMSN) support. And the highly dispersed Pt catalyst (Pt/Mn-DMSN) was obtained by incipient wetness impregnation method using H2PtCl6Â·6H2O as the precursor.

[1] "Therefore, more detailed studies are needed to better understand this process. For example, it would be beneficial to gain a fundamental understanding on the steps proposed in Schemes 4 and 5 to develop strategies to prevent coke formation through these routes."
         
         [2] "The monitoring of industrial chromiaalumina catalysts by combined time-resolved UVvis and Raman spectroscopies can be employed to improve the overall efficiency of future alkane dehydrogenation processes."
