[1] "Through the flux analysis, we find that the conversion from propane to propylene on Pt(111) occurs by the generally accepted reverse Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism, and the formation of propylene and byproducts proceed essentially by way of two parallel reactions starting from CH3CHCH3."
      
         [2] "On Pt(211), however, an unexpected reaction pathway is proposed to dominate the kinetics, which consists of three dehydrogenation steps that have two β-H atoms and one α-H atom removed from propane, followed by the hydrogenation of CH3CCH2; at this species, the deep dehydrogenation reaction competes with the production of propylene."

[1] "DFT calculations and microscopic kinetics simulations were carried out to obtain detailed insights into the catalytic performance. The results show the Pt4-Ge2-d4r@UTL structure can effectively lower the energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step, which is the rate-determining step, and thus promote the PDH reaction rate." 

         [2] "Over the Pt4-Ge2-d4r@UTL surface, the first dehydrogenation step is exothermic with a lower energy barrier of 21.2 kJ/mol. Subsequent steps involve H2 formation and desorption to regenerate the catalyst."

[1] "As proposed by extensive available theoretical studies, (9,24,25,32) the energy difference between propylene desorption and deep dehydrogenation is identified as an important indicator for controlling propylene selectivity."

      [2] "Finally, any further deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propylidene would generate propyne, which will result in selectivity loss and coking via CC scission."

      [3] "We therefore propose that the reaction rate difference between propylene and propyne production is a key indicator for the propylene selectivity in PDH."

[1] "The catalytic cycle is initiated by propane adsorption (Step 1a) and followed by the dissociation of a CH bond in the methyl group of adsorbed propane (Step 2a), which leads to the formation of a propyl group and a H atom bonded to Pt."

         [2] "The abstraction of a second hydrogen also occurs on the Pt atom (Step 3a), followed by hydrogen desorption (Steps 4a and 5a). Propene desorption (Step 6a) completes the catalytic cycle."

No relevant quotes. The article does not propose mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts.

[1] "Figure 3 presents the free energy profiles for C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 on Ptx (x = 1-4), Pt1Sny (y = 0, 1), Pt2Sny (y = 0-2), and Pt3Sny (y = 0, 1)."

      [2] "Scheme 1 presents pathways for the skeleton PDH network to C3H6. We augment it with C3H6 dehydrogenation to C3H4; CC cleavage in C3H6 to CH2* and CHCH3*; and CC cleavage in C3H4 to CH* and CCH3* surface species."

      [3] "Figure 9 shows the free energy profiles for further dehydrogenation of C3H6 to C3H4 on Pt1, Pt2, and Pt2Sn1."

      [4] "Figure 10 shows the free energy barriers of CC cleavage of C3H6 and C3H4 on Pt1, Pt2, and Pt2Sn1 clusters."

[1] "The isolated Pt1 well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability." 
         
         [2] "The high propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability."
