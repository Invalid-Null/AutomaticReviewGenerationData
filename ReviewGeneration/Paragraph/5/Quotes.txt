[1] Thanks to the great progress that has been made in quantum chemical calculations, molecular-level understanding of the interactions between surface structures of a catalyst and intermediates as well as transition states for a certain reaction has been greatly enhanced. 

         [2] On the one hand, the development of microkinetic analysis may bridge the microscopic reaction mechanism and the macroscopic behavior of catalysts, offering the sufficient comprehension of structure-activity-selectivity relationships.

         [3] On the other hand, the advances in electronic structure theory help to discover scaling relations between adsorption energies of intermediates as well as transition states and other related parameters, making it possible to identify a few independent variables as descriptors to describe the catalytic behaviors of transition metals and transition-metal compounds.

         [4] The plane-wave DFT calculations were carried out with the VASP code, employing the BEEF-vdW functional. This was applied to transition metal surfaces to screen propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

[1] Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents.

         [2] The article extensively describes the use of DFT calculations to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways. For example, it states "To derive deeper fundamental insights into the promoting effect of Rh on the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen, we applied DFT calculations."

[1] Density functional theory (DFT)-based studies have analyzed ethane (2025) and propane dehydrogenation (2634) selectivity trends across pure Pt and Pt alloys. 
         [2] Computational studies of PDH have considered Pt and industrially used Pt3Sn alloys, (2629) wherein the difference between the propylene binding energy and the propylene CH bond activation barrier was introduced as a selectivity descriptor to evaluate the relative rates of propylene desorption compared to unselective deep dehydrogenation. (27,28)  
         [3] More recently, in-depth microkinetic studies on Pt surfaces concluded that the initial CH bond activation step in propane, CH bond activation in propylene, (30,34) and CC bond breaking in propyne (CH3CCH*) (30) are kinetically relevant steps in PDH.

[1] The DFT calculations demonstrate that the energy barrier for dehydrogenation significantly increase when carbon atom adsorption at the nearby site.  
           [2] The calculations based on Pt3Sn(211) indicate that high selectivity and low coking amount on the PtSn catalyst can be originated from the absence of active Pt step sites.

[1] "The reaction path for the dehydrogenation of propane over Zn-exchanged mordenite has been investigated using ab initio density-functional calculations at different levels of theory: calculations for periodic models and finite clusters, calculations with and without corrections for dispersion forces, free energies of activation determined using harmonic transition state theory and using thermodynamic integrations based on constrained ab initio molecule-dynamics simulations."

      [5] "Recently, SACs have exhibited excellent catalytic performance in the activation of light alkanes. In particular, SACs deliver high alkene selectivity and excellent stability. Bao's group [8] used highly dispersed Fe catalysts (0.5% mass loading) supported on SiO2 for the non-oxidative methane conversion. At 1363 K, the conversion of methane reached 48.4% and the selectivity of ethene was 48.1%. More impressively, almost no coke was formed during a 60-h test and the carbon efficiency was nearly 100%. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) experiments showed that a single Fe atom was embedded into the SiO2 crystalline structure, bonded with two carbon and one silicon atoms."
