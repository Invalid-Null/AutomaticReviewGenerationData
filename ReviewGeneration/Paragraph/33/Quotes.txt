[1] "In this work, a descriptor-based microkinetic analysis combined with results from DFT calculations has been carried out to search for new and more effective intermetallic compound catalysts for PDH, in which the contributions of both terraces and steps to the kinetic behaviors have been taken into consideration."
      
      [2] "Based on the derived maps using the formation energies of CH3CH2@(1 1 1) and CH@(2 1 1) as two descriptors, 1482 A3B1 and 741 A1B1 intermetallic compound catalysts have been screened and the inexpensive and environmentally friendly Fe-Ga intermetallic compounds are singled out as the promising catalyst candidates."

[1] "A descriptor-based computational strategy, a framework of correlating key properties of a catalyst surface to its activity, has been successfully applied to design a promising metallic heterogeneous catalyst in recent years."

         [2] "The recent developments and implementations of machine learning in chemistry and material science have further accelerated catalyst design using advanced materials."

         [3] "Further screenings of different alloys such as trimetallic alloys with our established framework will identify more interesting catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation to produce olefins."
