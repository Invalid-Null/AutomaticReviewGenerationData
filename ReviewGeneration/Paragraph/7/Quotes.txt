[1] The scaling relations between the formation energies of the reaction intermediates involved in PDH on transition metal surfaces are established to identify reactivity descriptors. 

         [2] Linear regressions between the formation energies identify the ethyl and methylidyne adsorption energies as optimal descriptors with the highest R2 and lowest variance.

[1] Applying these scaling relationships on the six TM1-N3/C (TM = Sc, Ti, Y, Zr, La, Hf) catalysts, we performed the microkinetic simulation and obtained a volcano-type activity trend with respect to Ead(C3H6) (Figure 3d).

[1] "Catalytic performance has been found to strongly depend on the dispersion of active species and the nature of the support."
         
         [2] "The variation of Cr structures is also sensitive to Cr loadings, which can determine the activity."

[1] Thorough mechanistic and kinetic tests were complemented by detailed catalyst characterization by means of multiple state of the art characterization techniques. Furthermore, DFT calculations were carried out to elucidate the effects of Rh and the reduction degree of ZrO2 on individual reaction pathways at a molecular level." (Introduction, paragraph 5)

         [2] The article describes using experiments and computations to identify structure-activity relationships for propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

[1] "The calculated DRC of species/transition states involved in a simplified reaction network for PDH (Table S5) is summarized in Table 1. From the table, one can see that on the majority of the surfaces, the absolute values of XCH3CHHCH3* are the largest, indicating that the first dehydrogenation step of propane is rate-limiting."
         [2] "Having identified the rate-limiting transition state/intermediate, we are now in a position to establish the relations between their formation energies and the formation energies of simple adsorbed species, i.e., to identify the descriptor that can describe the energies of the adsorbed species in the kinetic model."

[1] Therefore, separating the PtPt ensembles to create Pt single atoms is considered to be efficient methodologies to circumvent the selectivity and coke issues.
         
         [2] It was proved that the catalyst stability not only resulted from the separated Pt single-atom sites but also significantly affected by the distance of adjacent Pt atoms.
         
         [3] An increasing distance to 3.25 Å in the Pt2In3 could induce a weak π-adsorption configuration of propylene on Pt sites, which facilitated the desorption of propylene and restrained the side reactions like coking.
