[1] "By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta)."

         [2] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species."

[1] "The initial C3H8 dehydrogenation rates decrease rapidly (40%) during the first 100 min and then decline slowly afterward, while the C3H6 selectivity is stable at 96%." 
         
         [2] "The correlations between GaHx vs Ga/Al ratio and PDH rates vs Ga/Al ratio show that extra-framework Ga+ is the active center catalyzing propane dehydrogenation."

[1] "PDH rates were measured on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with varying Si/Al ratios (1539) and Ga/Al ratios (01.7), demonstrating that catalytic activity is sensitive to both the Si/Al ratio and the Ga/Al ratios."
         [2] "This drastic change in the TOFGa implies that additional Ga introduced at in the Ga/Al ratio of 0.042 to 0.21 exists in a different state from that introduced to samples with the lower Ga/Al ratios, i.e., two types of Ga sites with distinct PDH activities are present." 
         [3] "Activation energy measurements confirm that the apparent activation energy (Eapp) of the PDH on the Ga+H+ pair sites is lower than that on the isolated Ga+ sites."
         [4] "On samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15, as the Ga/Al ratio increases, the TOFAl increases rapidly with the Ga loading up to the Ga/Al ratio of 0.05 and then increases more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3 before declining with the further addition of Ga (Figure 1a)."
         [5] "A similar 3-segment dependence of the PDH rate on the Ga/Al ratio was observed on samples with a Si/Al ratio of 28 (Figure 1a)."

[1] The TS-1 zeolites have an average crystal diameter of 100 nm initially and increase by 2, 3, or even 50 times when the synthesis conditions are changed; the largest TS-1 crystals are approximately 5.7 μm. 
         [2] The higher surface area and the existence of hierarchical porosity in smaller TS-1 zeolites result in a significant improvement in catalytic performance.
         [3] Low resistance to intercrystalline diffusion facilitates the departure of propylene from the active sites, which avoids some further side reactions, such as coking. Hence, the lifetime of smaller TS-1 zeolite-supported PtSn catalysts is much longer than that of the larger samples, as discussed above.

[1] A PtZn alloy nanoparticle catalyst for propane dehydrogenation was synthesized by simple coimpregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Zn(NO3)2 onto a mesoporous material, which was built with siliceous MFI zeolite nanosheets.
      [2] The mesoporous structure and the surface silanol groups of the MFI zeolite are suggested to play an important role in promoting the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles.
