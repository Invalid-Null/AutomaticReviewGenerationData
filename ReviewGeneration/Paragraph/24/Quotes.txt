[1] "Pt has already been recognized as an effective catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to its high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. As discussed above, the PDH reaction is a structure-insensitive reaction whose kinetics is independent of the Pt particle size, while the side reactions are usually structure-sensitive reactions that are dependent on the particle size of Pt and the exposed crystal faces. Small-sized and highly dispersed Pt particles are usually preferable for the PDH reaction due to their considerable catalytic activity and high selectivity toward propylene."

Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species. As shown in Fig. 1c,d, Pt mainly exists as nanoparticles of ~3-5nm in the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 2), while subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.4-0.7nm are the dominant species in the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 3).

         A controllable amount of K+ is introduced to compensate the silanol groups, and to stabilize the subnanometric Pt species.

Herein, a novel strategy for the synthesis of highly stable Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is developed, which is realized by the stabilization of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn sites in the zeolite framework. This strategy consists of three basic steps: (i) removal of framework Al atoms from the zeolite crystalline structure to create the lattice defects, (ii) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite, and (iii) soft landing of the Pt particle at the surface of Sn-zeolite to achieve Pt/Sn-zeolite catalysts.

[1] The Ga2O3 diffraction peaks were not observed for Ga-CHA samples (Figure S2), which indicated that Ga2O3 is highly dispersed and formed in an insufficient amount to generate an XRD pattern. 
         [2] Ga2O3 particles were observed on Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) on the zeolite surface (Figure S3), due to the relatively large amount of Ga loading, in agreement with the observation of mesopores associated with Ga2O3 on the N2 adsorption isotherms of Ga-CHA(5, 1.0) (Figure S5c). The large Ga2O3 particles disappeared upon reduction of the samples, showing that Ga2O3 was reduced and formed highly dispersed species (below we show that extra-framework Ga species are formed). The decreased micropore volumes of reduced Ga-CHA(x, 1.0) compared with H-CHA(x) show that Ga2O3 particles on the external surface, upon reduction, moved into the micropore of the zeolite (Table S1).

[1] "Pt clusters below 2 nm are frequently used in the propane dehydrogenation [11], [12], [13], [14]. The bulk Pt metal has a melting temperature of up to 1772 C, but Pt particle melting temperature decreases to 405 C when its size reduces to 1.5 nm [15]."

         [2] "In summary, a regenerable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation is developed via loading the Pt-Sn2 clusters onto highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3. The Pt-Sn clusters about 1 nm are highly dispersed at the surface of meso-Al2O3 support, and Pt species have a strong interaction with the Al3+penta sites probably via an Al-O-Pt bond, which allows Pt-Sn2 clusters to be firmly anchored in the structure of mesoporous Al2O3."

         [3] "HAADF-STEM characterization was carried out on a typical Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 sample to know the morphology of mesoporous Al2O3 and Pt dispersion (Fig. 4). In fact, the meso-Al2O3-600 possesses a two-dimensional pore architecture, because the ordered hexagonal arrangement of pores and alignment of cylindrical pores can be observed along [0 0 1] and [1 1 0] directions, respectively. The highly dispersed Pt-Sn clusters are distinguishable in the HAADF-STEM images, and these clusters with an average size of 0.70 nm have no well-defined morphology. A further CO chemisorption measurement (Table S3) shows that the dispersity of Pt in this sample is 67.2%, suggesting that most Pt atoms are exposed on the surface."

[1] Herein, we found zinc hydrides ([ZnH]+) as the highly reactive site for PDH. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that [ZnH]+ was transformed from zinc hydroxyl ([ZnOH]+) sites under reductive conditions.
      [2] The optimized CuZnO@S-1 consists of exclusively isolated [ZnOH]+ sites, which help produce more [ZnH]+ toward optimal PDH activity. Specifically, the catalyst enables 43% propane conversion with >88% propylene selectivity, close to the thermodynamic equilibrium.  
      [3] Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of ZnO@S-1 exhibit peaks at 1.52 and 3.05 Å (Figure 5b), which are attributed to the first ZnO shell and second ZnOZn shell coordination, respectively. (12,14) On the contrary, only one peak at 1.50 Å was identified for CuZnO@S-1, confirming that Cu can promote the formation of isolated Zn sites.
      [4] Notably, the Zn k-absorption peak in CuZnO@S-1 shifts to lower energy than parent ZnO@S-1, revealing a slight decrease in the Zn oxidation state with Cu modification. (14) 
      [5] In situ DRIFTS measurements were performed to investigate the changes in the Zn speciation during the induction period. Figure 2b shows that the intensity of the ZnOH hydroxyl band (13) at 3635 cm−1 decreases with increasing temperature during exposure to propane. Together with the erosion of the 3635 cm−1 band, a band at 1844 cm−1 appears, which can be attributed to the formation of [ZnH]+ (Zn-hydride) species. (21,22) The spectra point to the in situ transformation from zinc hydroxides ([ZnOH]+) to [ZnH]+ species during the PDH reaction, which was related to the observed induction periods in panel (a).

[1] "SCALMS were prepared by deposition of metallic Ga on the support, followed by galvanic displacement with a noble metal salt solution."

[1] "Comparing the V10Si and V10Si-i catalysts also provided additional insights. The two samples exhibited very similar performance in the co-feed mode, but the V10Si sample demonstrated higher selectivity to propylene under anaerobic conditions." 
         [2] "Because the two catalysts exhibited very similar activity, this difference can be attributed to the different nature of the VOx species."   
         [3] "Thus, the advantage of the present FP preparation method over other preparation procedures is the possibility of hosting higher V concentrations without V2O5 segregation, thereby permitting greater selectivity compared with that provided by traditionally prepared catalysts."

         [2] "The structured catalysts of (i) H-ZSM-5 (with two different Si/Al ratios of 50 and 280), (ii) 4 wt % Ga2O3/ZSM-5, (iii) 1.3 wt % Ga2O31.3 wt % V2O51.3 wt % ZrO2/ZSM-5, (iv) 0.7 wt % Cr2O31.1 wt % Ga2O31.1 wt % V2O51.1 wt % ZrO2/ZSM-5, (v) 2 wt % Ga2O32 wt % V2O5/ZSM-5, and (vi) 1 wt % Cr2O31.5 wt % Ga2O31.5 wt % V2O5/ZSM-5 have been synthesized and characterized"

         [3] "To address this issue, structured monolithic catalysts with open channel design have been developed extensively over the past few decades, as the honeycombed geometry allows for a resistance-free fluid flow and therefore yields reduced pressure drops, lower energy costs, and enhanced mass transfer."

[1] "Thus a series of preparation and reaction conditions were examined, including the ratio of Pt to Sn, calcination temperature, pre-reduction temperature and the ratio of C3H8 to H2 in feed gas."
         [2] "Before running reaction-regeneration experiment to explore the influence of different regeneration modes on the catalytic performance of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, a suitable catalyst with high activity, selectivity and good stability, as well as an optimal reaction condition is required."
         [3] "Fig. 1 demonstrates the time dependences of propane conversion and propylene selectivity over Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts with different Pt/Sn ratios."
         [4] "As Sn content rose, De value dropped. While Sn content exceeded 2.4 wt%, De value was almost unchanged. Accordingly, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al (i.e., Pt/Sn mole ratio is 1/2) was chosen as the catalyst for periodic reaction-regeneration operation."
