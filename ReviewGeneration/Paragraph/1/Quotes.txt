[1] Propylene is the important raw material for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, propylene oxide, etc.
         [2] According to a report from IHS Markit Ltd. and Dow Chemical Inc., the global propylene supply demand market renders a big gap since 2015, and the propylene demand would keep growing at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% up to 2030.
         [3] Conventional propylene production mainly comes from fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil. Due to the rapid consumption of crude oil, these traditional propylene production technologies cannot satisfy current and future demands well.

[1] Propylene, which is conventionally obtained from steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking, is an important feedstock for the production of various chemicals.

         [2] Benefit from the development of hydraulic fracturing technologies in North America, a large amount of shale gas, including methane, ethane, and propane, can be extracted in a cost-effective manner, creating an opportunity for the development of the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology.

[1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives."

[1] Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene should be especially mentioned. This reaction is the basis of large-scale propene production using cheap propane from shale/natural gas.

         [2] Propylene (C3H6) is one of the most important basic chemicals and is mainly used for the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, acrylic acid, isopropanol, and oxo-alcohols.

         [1] The article provides background on the importance of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation, stating that it "is the basis of large-scale propene production using cheap propane from shale/natural gas" and that propylene has many applications as it is "one of the most demanded monomers in petrochemical industry for the synthesis of various polymers including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, acrylic acid, polygas chemicals etc." (Introduction, paragraph 1)

1. The article provides background on the importance of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation by stating that propylene is an important building block for manufacturing chemicals like polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile. It notes that propane dehydrogenation has emerged as an effective route for propylene production by exploiting abundant shale gas resources.

[1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and other chemicals, which is traditionally fabricated by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil products."
         [2] "Recently, large amounts of low-cost light alkanes are provided on the market with the exploration of shale gas, leading propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to be an attractive technology for producing propylene."

[1] Propylene, underpinning many highly valued products (polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and acetone), has a big industrial demand for the foreseeable future. (14)

         [2] Thereinto, polypropene with high chemical durability and elasticity can be applied in various sectors like construction and packaging.

         [3] The nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technique has emerged as a high-value-rising and promising alternative to traditional propylene production techniques due to the distinct price variance between propane and propylene.

[1] Propylene is one of the main feedstocks in the chemical industry, used in the production of a great number of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene.

      [2] The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030, laying bare a growing gap between the supply and demand of propylene.

      [3] The rapid increase in shale gas production with its substantial content of natural gas liquids and thus propane has led to increased interest in PDH: it currently accounts for 10% of global propylene production.

[1] As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years.  
         [2] The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry.

Propylene is the second largest bulk chemical produced globally, primarily feeding the ever-growing polymer industry. The production of propylene has steadily increased by 6% annually in the past 10 years.
         Propylene is the second largest bulk chemical produced globally, primarily feeding the ever-growing polymer industry. The production of propylene has steadily increased by 6% annually in the past 10 years, and despite the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, it reached 130 t y1 in 2020 and is expected to keep growing at a similar rate for the next decade.
