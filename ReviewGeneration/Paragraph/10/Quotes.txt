[1] "To examine the effect of new surface acid-base pairs created in the d-Al2O3(1 1 0) on the alkane DH mechanism and activation barriers, we selected two acid-base pairs, AlII-OII (pair d-A) and AlIII-OIII (pair d-B) highlighted in Fig. 7b, around the oxygen vacancy on the d-Al2O3(1 1 0), and two corresponding acid-base pairs on the s-Al2O3(1 1 0), AlIII-OII (pair s-A) and AlIV-OIII (pair s-B), respectively in (Fig. 7a)."

[1] "Comprehensive characterizations were conducted to understand the underlying reaction mechanism. The oxidation states of Cr for the fresh and spent 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Figure 5). Both Cr6+ and Cr3+ were present in the as-prepared catalysts, with a Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio of 2.45 and 1.75 for 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst, respectively. After the CO2-ODH reaction, CrOx was reduced, and only Cr3+ was observed in both 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts. This suggests that Cr3+ is the active site during the ODH reaction."
         [2] "In situ DRIFTS study was carried out to provide insights on the CO2-ODH reaction pathway over the 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst (Figure 8). The fresh catalyst was first pretreated at 650 C for 30 min in the presence of 10%O2, followed by cooling down to room temperature for propane adsorption. After propane adsorption, the catalyst was purged at room temperature for 20 min. Adsorption of propane is evidenced by peaks at 1378 and 1456 cm1, corresponding to CH bending. Interestingly, three peaks appear in the region of 15001700 cm1 (i.e., 1560, 1616, and 1675 cm1) due to CC stretching, suggesting the formation of surface-adsorbed propylene. Desorption of propylene was observed when the catalyst was heated above 200 C. When propane and CO2 were coadsorbed on the catalyst surface, both propane and propylene peaks were observed (Figure 8b). Desorption of propylene occurs at above 200 C, similar to the case of propane adsorption only. In the temperature range studied (i.e., 25400 C), no CO peak was observed. This suggests that propane dehydrogenation is more favorable than CO2 splitting over the 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst. In fact, negligible CO2 chemisorption over the catalyst was observed based on the CO2-TPD study (Figure S5). Cr3+ as the active site is further supported by cyclic DRIFTS experiments in the presence of propane for two cycles without regeneration of the catalyst in-between (Figure S6)."

[1] On the basis of the above results and our previous study [20], as well as under consideration of literature data on alkane dehydrogenation over CrOx- [45], [46], [47] and GaOx-containing catalysts [48], [49], we put forward that a PDH active site consists of Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen (Fig. 5(a)). 
         
         [2] Such pair is responsible for breaking CH bond in C3H8 resulting in the formation of surface Zrcus-C3H7 and OH species. After the elimination of the β-hydrogen in the former species, gas-phase C3H6 and H2 are formed and the active site is regenerated.

[1] "Because direct PDH reaction is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction which requires high temperatures to obtain industrially interested per-pass conversions. Besides high energy consumption, these harsh reaction conditions would lead to heavy coking and sintering of active sites."
         
         [2] "The experiments were conducted at 550 C to obtain a relatively low level of propane conversion of below 10% to calculate the intrinsic activity of these catalysts."
         
         [3] "It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is the most active one with TOFpropane 4 times higher than that of VOx/TiO2, VOx/SiO2, and VOx/Al2O3, and 16 times higher than that of VOx/MgO." 
         
         [4] "The kinetic study and established scaling relationships reveals that the CO2 would facilitate propane activation by re-oxidization of VOx with more active lattice oxygen. On the other hand, whether promotional effects of CO2 on catalysts activity could be observed experimentally or not relate closely to the coking behaviors of catalysts because the H2 lean conditions caused by CO2 would lead to faster deactivation of catalysts with higher VOx polymerization degree and stronger support acidity."

[1] "For certain indirect mechanism catalysts, a H-assisted pathway activates CO2 when H atoms are dissociated on the surface of the active site via intermediate formate HCOO or carboxyl HOCO species, ultimately forming rWGS products."  

         [2] "For direct mechanism catalysts, propane dehydrogenation progresses on a limited number of highly valent metal oxide centers, in which lattice oxygen initiates the reaction by coordinating propane and abstracting H via an MvK mechansim."

The scission of CH bonds is thus much faster than that of CC bonds, resulting in the propyl radical as the major product. 
         The second CH activation may occur either at the first carbon atom or at the second (central) carbon atom of the propyl radical. The calculated energy profiles show that the dissociation of H atom from the second carbon atom of the propyl group to produce the propylene molecule is a highly exothermic reaction, with a very small activation barrier of 0.10 eV and a large energy drop of 1.87 eV.

[1] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported vanadium oxides, the propane dehydrogenation reaction can be divided into two periods: the initial ODH dominant period and the subsequent PDH dominant period."

Besides, for the rational design of redox catalysts, a fundamental understanding of the structureactivity relationship for the redox process is required.

[1] "DFT calculations indicate that the introduction of Ga into the framework of ZrO2 alters the CH bond activation pathway from a stepwise mechanism to a concerted mechanism involving simultaneous cleavage of two CH bonds in propane." 

         [2] "In comparison, the PDH reaction coordinate over m-ZrO2 is also displayed in Figure 5 because the crystallite size of prepared m-ZrO2 is very large (17.4 nm); the stoichiometric surface of m-ZrO2 is used for calculation."

         [4] "The positive roles of CO2 in the overall ODHP reaction include serving as (i) a diluent to enhance the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes and (ii) an agent to remove coke via the reverse Boudouard reaction."
         
         [5] "Moreover, CO2 can help keep the metal components at a higher oxidation state during CO2-ODHP, such as inhibiting the formation of metallic iron and iron carbide with better activity toward isobutane dehydrogenation."

[1] Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) was studied over a series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, to gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function.  

           [2] In situAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state.

           [3] Based on ex situ and in situ characterization results and catalytic data, it appears that the activity of the Cr species is different in xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3. For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3.

[1] "Two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy, i.e. coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) having, nevertheless, different chemical environment in tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2, were concluded to be responsible for homolytic breaking of CH bonds in propane."

           [4] "Regardless of the catalysts tested, the Ea values were about 150 kJ·mol1. The similarity between differently structured ZrO2 in terms of experimentally determined Ea values suggests that the kind of the active site does not depend on catalyst phase composition. It can be composed of two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy as concluded from DFT calculations."

[1] "Dehydrogenation over the oxidized surface follows the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism."
      
      [2] "Hydrogen atoms that shed off the hydrocarbons are picked up by integral surface oxygen atoms, which desorb in the form of water."

         [2] "We propose that an active chlorine species, possibly a Cl•-like species, is generated from HCl, which accounts for the selective conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 on our CeO2-based catalysts."  

         [3] "The C3H7• intermediate may be transformed into C3H6 via a direct path by removing another H atom with an energy barrier of 1.0 eV (Figure 12a). The indirect path via C3H7Cl can also produce C3H6 (Figure 12b)."

[1] Our mechanistic analysis led us to the conclusion that coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus, where cus=coordinatively unsaturated) are the active sites possessing PDH activity and selectivity comparable to those of an industrially relevant CrOx-containing catalyst.
         [2] We postulate that Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen participate in the CH bond activation resulting in the formation of ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species. After the elimination of the β-hydrogen, propene and hydrogen are formed.

[1] On the basis of the discussion above, we herein propose the kinetic relevance and involvement of tetracoordinated Ti sites as illustrated in Figure 5a,b. The formation of the unique structure of 2D TiOx ultrathin nanosheets renders an enhancing proportion of coordinatively unsaturated Ti4c sites adjacent to Ovac on the catalyst surface, whose concentration further boosts during the H2 reduction process with the generation of a quasi-dative bonding between the Lewis basic terminal hydroxyl group (TiOH) and Lewis acidic Ti4c sites.

         [2] This surface-frustrated Lewis pair (HOTiOvacTi4c) further facilitates the heterolytic dissociation of cofeeding H2 by providing lone-pair electrons in Lewis base and empty orbitals in Lewis acid sites to bind H+ and H-, respectively, generating hydridic H adsorbates on tetracoordinated Ti4c sites, which, according to the projected density-of-state calculation, creates an energy state close to the Fermi level in the band structure as depicted in Figure 5c, altering the binding state of propane molecules during dehydrogenation, and recombines with the H extracted from propane to form H2.

[1] Ga+ was found to react with H2 to form GaHx at 150 C with an enthalpy of formation of GaHx of 51.2 kJ·mol1. [2] The higher reaction rate on Ga+ than In+ is the result of the difference in stabilization of the transition state during the oxidative addition of propane to the cation. [3] Ga+ activates propane by breaking the CH bond through an oxidative addition process by forming [HGa(III)C3H7]+ species. This step is followed by an H-beta elimination with the formation of an [H2Ga(III)C3H6] intermediate and closed by the desorption of C3H6 and the reductive elimination of H2 to form Ga+.

[1] These phenomena suggest that the MnOx/CeO2-SOSI catalyst might follow a similar mechanism of vanadium oxide catalysts in tuning the reaction pathways from combustion to selective ODHP: the surface oxygen is modulated to hinder the overoxidation.  
[2] When propane was introduced (Figure 5a), the mode of MnOx was unchanged in position but remarkably decreased in intensity with a rise in the temperature (Figures 5a, S33a, and S34a). This phenomenon might be due to the primary interaction of propane with the MnOxCeO2 interfacial oxygen species, which is well consistent with the general knowledge that the CH bond in hydrocarbons easily reacts with the active oxygen on the interface with an asymmetric Coulomb interaction with Mn and Ce.   
[3] Introducing propene to the MnOx/CeO2-SOSI catalyst led to a red shift in the Raman mode of MnOx from 656 to 652 cm-1 (Figure 5b), which is different from the phenomenon observed in the propane case. This might be assigned to the fact that the nucleophilic CC group in propene favors to react with the oxygen-deficient Mn rather than O sites, in good agreement with the phenomenon in the literature.

[1] "Lattice oxygen in MoVO mixed oxides contributes to oxidative dehydrogenation by hydrogen abstraction and oxygen transfer. With depletion of lattice oxygen, the V3+ species functions as a catalytic site for nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
[2] "Influenced by lattice oxygen evolution, different reaction regions are observed: an initial region influenced by CO2 from overoxidation (eq 1) and an oxidative dehydrogenation region dominated by C3H6 and H2O (eq 2)."
