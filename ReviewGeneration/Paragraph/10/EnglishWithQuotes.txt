After the CO2-ODH reaction, CrOx was reduced, and only Cr3+ was observed in both 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts.

The fresh catalyst was first pretreated at 650 C for 30 min in the presence of 10%O2, followed by cooling down to room temperature for propane adsorption. After propane adsorption, the catalyst was purged at room temperature for 20 min. Adsorption of propane is evidenced by peaks at 1378 and 1456 cm1, corresponding to CH bending. Interestingly, three peaks appear in the region of 15001700 cm1 (i.e., 1560, 1616, and 1675 cm1) due to CC stretching, suggesting the formation of surface-adsorbed propylene. Desorption of propylene was observed when the catalyst was heated above 200 C. When propane and CO2 were coadsorbed on the catalyst surface, both propane and propylene peaks were observed (Figure 8b). Desorption of propylene occurs at above 200 C, similar to the case of propane adsorption only. In the temperature range studied (i.e., 25400 C), no CO peak was observed.

In fact, negligible CO2 chemisorption over the catalyst was observed based on the CO2-TPD study (Figure S5).
