[1] Integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC-STEM) images40 for ultra-stable Pt-A-2h(31)-R and Pt-free UTL-C.  

         [2] The iDPC-STEM images acquired from the Pt-free UTL-C sample show empty channels, confirming that the adsorbed organic species can be removed effectively via heating treatment.  

         [3] The iDPC-STEM images of Pt-A-2h(31)-R show clear contrasts inside the 14-MR channels, which are apparently off-centre in the channel but close to the d4r units.

To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials. The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position. Considering the larger space in the sinusoidal channels versus the straight channels, Pt species may preferentially be located in the sinusoidal channels.

         [2] "Despite extensive efforts dedicated to the reaction mechanism and the factors that control activity, the aforementioned Ga2O3-based catalysts all deactivate drastically within a few hours [21], [23], [24], because a high density of medium-strong acid sites on the surface of the Ga2O3-based materials favors considerable coke formation under alkane dehydrogenation conditions [21], [23], [25]."

         [3] "It is noteworthy that an appreciable increase in the intensity of the
band of adsorbed pyridine also has been identified for the mixed-oxide catalysts with respect to the simple oxide of Î³-Ga2O3, further confirming the greater surface density of Lewis acid sites that can be achieved over the mixed-oxide materials."

Herein, a novel strategy for the synthesis of highly stable Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is developed, which is realized by the stabilization of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn sites in the zeolite framework. This strategy consists of three basic steps: (i) removal of framework Al atoms from the zeolite crystalline structure to create the lattice defects, (ii) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite, and (iii) soft landing of the Pt particle at the surface of Sn-zeolite to achieve Pt/Sn-zeolite catalysts.

[1] The Ga2O3 nanoparticles in calcined Ga-CHA catalysts are not completely reduced in H2 until a temperature of 700 C is reached. The ratio between formed H2O during reduction of Ga-CHA at 700 C and the O consumption via subsequent oxidation was 1.5, indicating that Ga2O3 particles are reduced to Ga+ by the hydrogen gas.
         [2] Combined with in situ FTIR spectroscopy, the consumption of BASs upon reduction and the lack of GaHx at 550 C show that extra-framework Ga+ is formed upon reduction at 700 C.

[1] Herein, we found zinc hydrides ([ZnH]+) as the highly reactive site for PDH. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that [ZnH]+ was transformed from zinc hydroxyl ([ZnOH]+) sites under reductive conditions.
      [2] The optimized CuZnO@S-1 consists of exclusively isolated [ZnOH]+ sites, which help produce more [ZnH]+ toward optimal PDH activity. Specifically, the catalyst enables 43% propane conversion with >88% propylene selectivity, close to the thermodynamic equilibrium.  
      [3] Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of ZnO@S-1 exhibit peaks at 1.52 and 3.05 Ã… (Figure 5b), which are attributed to the first ZnO shell and second ZnOZn shell coordination, respectively. (12,14) On the contrary, only one peak at 1.50 Ã… was identified for CuZnO@S-1, confirming that Cu can promote the formation of isolated Zn sites.
      [4] Notably, the Zn k-absorption peak in CuZnO@S-1 shifts to lower energy than parent ZnO@S-1, revealing a slight decrease in the Zn oxidation state with Cu modification. (14)
      [5] In situ DRIFTS measurements were performed to investigate the changes in the Zn speciation during the induction period. Figure 2b shows that the intensity of the ZnOH hydroxyl band (13) at 3635 cmâˆ’1 decreases with increasing temperature during exposure to propane. Together with the erosion of the 3635 cmâˆ’1 band, a band at 1844 cmâˆ’1 appears, which can be attributed to the formation of [ZnH]+ (Zn-hydride) species. (21,22) The spectra point to the in situ transformation from zinc hydroxides ([ZnOH]+) to [ZnH]+ species during the PDH reaction, which was related to the observed induction periods in panel (a).

[From Answer 5] The structure of the silanol groups in the synthesized zeolites was investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy. The OH-stretching bands are normally observed in the frequency region of 3100â€“3900 cmâˆ’1, varying according to the interactions between the silanols [47], [48], [49]. The IR spectra of the four zeolites are presented in Fig. 3.  
       [From Answer 5] Moreover, the structure of the silanol groups in the synthesized zeolites was investigated by 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy after adsorption of trimethylphosphine (TMP) as a base to titrate acidic sites in MZ samples [50]. The 31P NMR spectra showed three peaks with the chemical shifts of 59, 34 and 3 ppm with respect to the signal of phosphoric acid. These peaks can be assigned to physisorbed TMP, TMP associated with Lewis acid sites, and TMP interacting with BrÃ¸nsted acid sites [i.e., (CH3)3Pâˆ’H+], respectively (Fig. S4) [51].
