{"Quotes": "[1] Herein, we found zinc hydrides ([ZnH]+) as the highly reactive site for PDH. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that [ZnH]+ was transformed from zinc hydroxyl ([ZnOH]+) sites under reductive conditions.\n      [2] The optimized CuZnO@S-1 consists of exclusively isolated [ZnOH]+ sites, which help produce more [ZnH]+ toward optimal PDH activity. Specifically, the catalyst enables 43% propane conversion with >88% propylene selectivity, close to the thermodynamic equilibrium.  \n      [3] Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of ZnO@S-1 exhibit peaks at 1.52 and 3.05 Å (Figure 5b), which are attributed to the first ZnO shell and second ZnOZn shell coordination, respectively. (12,14) On the contrary, only one peak at 1.50 Å was identified for CuZnO@S-1, confirming that Cu can promote the formation of isolated Zn sites.\n      [4] Notably, the Zn k-absorption peak in CuZnO@S-1 shifts to lower energy than parent ZnO@S-1, revealing a slight decrease in the Zn oxidation state with Cu modification. (14)\n      [5] In situ DRIFTS measurements were performed to investigate the changes in the Zn speciation during the induction period. Figure 2b shows that the intensity of the ZnOH hydroxyl band (13) at 3635 cm−1 decreases with increasing temperature during exposure to propane. Together with the erosion of the 3635 cm−1 band, a band at 1844 cm−1 appears, which can be attributed to the formation of [ZnH]+ (Zn-hydride) species. (21,22) The spectra point to the in situ transformation from zinc hydroxides ([ZnOH]+) to [ZnH]+ species during the PDH reaction, which was related to the observed induction periods in panel (a).", "English": "Yes, the article describes using additives like Cu to promote the formation of isolated Zn sites in the silicalite-1 zeolite support, as evidenced by EXAFS data in Quote [3].
