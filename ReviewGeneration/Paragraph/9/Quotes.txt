[1] "The experiments and DFT calculations illuminate the importance of oxygen vacancy on the surface of Al2O3 for PDH reaction."  

           [2] "The consumption of lattice oxygen reduces the one coordination number of the bonding Al, the formed Alcu-O as defective acid-base pairs, can be an effective way to tune the adsorption energy of the intermediates and the barriers of key steps (the first CH activation and H2 formation) to enhance the performance of PDH through both site-dependent concerted and stepwise mechanisms."

[1] "In this context, we modified VOx/Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation with PH3 surface treatment, which leads to great improvement of catalyst stability by inhibiting coking deposition during propane dehydrogenation." 

         [2] "Experimental results revealed that the synergy among tuned acidity, lower coking precursor intimacy and faster propylene desorption after phosphorus modification accounted for the enhancement in catalytic stability during propane dehydrogenation."

         [3] "Compared to conventional phosphate impregnation, phosphine interacted extensively with alumina support and vanadium species without causing structural destructions."  

         [4] "The insertion of phosphorus into polymerized vanadium species decreased polymerization degree and formed more isolated vanadium species, which has lower dehydrogenation reactivity." 

         [5] "Furthermore, it weakened the interaction between vanadium species and alumina, and also reduced initial reactivity of the catalysts."

         [6] "However, weakened vanadium-support interaction made vanadium sites more repulsive to active intermediates and propylene products, which can desorb more easily from the catalysts surface."

         [7] "More isolated vanadium species also expanded the distance between active propylene intermediates and reduced the possibility of oligomerization, thus inhibited coking of the catalysts."

[1] "The active sites of the FP-prepared catalysts appeared as highly dispersed V5+O groups partly incorporated into the silica matrix and interacting poorly with one another." 

           [2] "Lower dispersion can be achieved at the same V loading with the catalyst prepared by impregnation."  

           [3] "EPR revealed V4+O groups pointing out normally from the catalyst surface and sitting in the center of a surface array of oxygen atoms."

           [4] "These V4+ groups helped demonstrate the difference in catalytic behavior of the various samples."

[1] "ZnZr2 possessed the highest amount of H2 consumed among the ZnZr catalysts, which was ascribed to more ZnO-Zr species."
      [2] "The change results in increased oxygen mobility and promotes the removal of lattice oxygen from ZnZr catalysts, generating Zncus and Zrcus of ZncusOZrcus."
      [3] "It was found that an increase in acid strength was in direct correlation with an increase in the Zr content. On the contrary, CO2-TPD indicated that the quantity of basic sites in the material decreased as the Zr content increased; the strength of the basic sites was however enhanced."

"A higher activity of monoclinic β-Ga2O3 (the thermodynamically stable gallia polymorph) relative to hexagonal α-Ga2O3 was ascribed to the higher ratio of tetrahedral vs octahedral Ga sites present in bulk β-Ga2O3 (GaIV:GaVI = 1:1), in contrast to the absence of bulk GaIV sites in α-Ga2O3."
          "β-Ga2O3 showing more weak Lewis acid sites compared to γ-Ga2O3."

[1] "On γ-Al2O3tin interacts with the support and is stabilized in an oxidation state >0. The result is an increase in Pt dispersion and an improved stability of the catalytic activity without any change in the initial specific activity in dehydrogenation."

           [2] "On SiO2the Sn is more readily reduced, and alloy formation is possible. This leads to a similar increase in Pt dispersion and improved catalytic stability, but also to a strong reduction in the specific activity."

[1] In general, the catalysts can be ordered in terms of the improvement of their activity through ZnO as follows: 4Zn/TiZrOx > 4Zn/CeZrOx > 4Zn/LaZrOx > 4Zn/YZrOx > 4Zn/ZrO2.
         [2] Isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ species could be formed upon high-temperature calcination, promoting insertion of Zn2+ cations into the position of the Zr4+ cation in the lattice of ZrO2.  
         [3] Moreover, we also established that supporting ZnO on ZrO2 or MZrOx inhibits the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen (Table 2).
         [4] When comparing catalysts in terms of coke formation, it is important to consider the amount of propane converted, because coke is mainly formed from propene and to a minor extent directly from propane.

[1] "the reductionoxidation property and the appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support are important in these catalytic reactions [5], [8]."

        [2] "The changes in both XANES (Fig. 10A, a and b) and the EXAFS (Fig. 10B, a and b) spectra indicate that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were reduced to an aggregated form of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra during the reaction for 3 h. After the treatment with O2, the XANES (Fig. 10A, c) and the EXAFS spectra (Fig. 10B, c) showed a sharp preedge peak and a single peak, respectively, suggesting that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were regenerated by the reoxidation of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra."

[1] "The introduction of Sn helps to improve the dispersion of Pt and minimize sintering of nanoparticles, consistent with the geometric effect over Pt-Sn catalysts." 
         [2] "With the addition of Sn and the formation of a Pt3Sn alloy, the initial propane conversion increases to 40%, and the propene selectivity increases to 92%, which is attributed to the geometric effect and electronic effect of the Pt-Sn alloy."

[1] High activity, selectivity, and durability of our catalysts were verified by comparing their performance under industrially relevant conditions with that of a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material in a series of 60 PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles at 550, 600, and 625 °C.

[1] Dehydrogenation of propane to propene over different polymorphs of gallium oxide was investigated.  

[2] β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs, and it is even more active than chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2.

[3] H2-TPR and XPS studies show that gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600C.

[4] The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway 

[5] the dehydrogenation reaction is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction.

[6] The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is probably associated with an abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites

[1] "It is therefore interesting to figure out if the scaling relations can be affected by the presence of the Lewis acid–base interaction."  

         [2] "By contrast, when the Lewis acid–base interaction occurs, the EH&H@MO becomes the descriptor and the PDH rate increases as H&H is bound more tightly at the MO site, causing the Ir-doped surface to show the best catalytic activity (Figure 5e)." 

         [3] "Previously, Sattler et al. reported that the addition of 1000 ppm of Pt would enhance the activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst."  

         [4] "In the presence of the Lewis acid–base interaction, other single-metal-doped surfaces, particularly the Ir-doped surface, are predicted to show better catalytic activity than Pt1Ga2O3."   

         [5] "Further experiments verify that the Ir1Ga2O3 candidate is more effective than the previously reported trace-Pt-promoted Ga2O3 catalyst, and the significantly improved catalytic performance is attributed to single-Ir-atom doping at the Ga(o) sites."

[1] "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are promising candidates for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) with and without CO2 introduction."
         
         [2] "Under propane direct dehydrogenation conditions, partly reduced V3+Ox/V4+Ox species have been identified as active sites for PDH without oxygen introduction."
         
         [3] "The experiments and established scaling relationships based on density functional theory calculations reveal that the chemical states of bridge oxygen in the VO bond play critical roles in propane activation under the reductive condition, and the weaker VOxsupport interactions result in lower electron density of bridge oxygen and thus contributing to higher CH bond rupture capability as that of VOx/ZrO2."
         
         [4] "The kinetic study and established scaling relationships reveals that the CO2 would facilitate propane activation by re-oxidization of VOx with more active lattice oxygen."

[1] "Cr+2, Cr+4, and Cr+6 have TTamman &lt; 50 C but are unstable and will decompose upon heating (likewise for Pt, Au, and Ag oxides). Indeed, the alumina support stabilizes these highly valent species, but upon reaction, they are short-lived."  

         [2] "In this context of oxygen mobility, we hypothesize that for an efficient use of a direct (redox) mechanism (Figure 1, left), catalytic materials need to have apparent reaction rates of ODHP and reoxidation of the same order of magnitude (rODHP ≈ rreoxidation)."  

         [3] "If dissociative chemisorption of CO2(g) competes with propane for the same active site, then it would seem we can increase the reactivity with a catalytic material capable of replenishing oxygen vacancies using bulk and neighbor lattice oxygen."

The molar ratio of Zr/Ga was found critical to PDH performance (Figure 2a,b). When ZrO2/SIRAL10 was used as the catalyst, only 1.8% of propane was converted with a low selectivity (74.3%). Both the conversion of propane and the selectivity of propylene increased significantly with the addition of Ga2O3 (Figure 2a).
         The propane conversion reached 50.1% at a propylene selectivity of 95.1% for a Zr/Ga molar ratio of 0.26/1 (e.g., Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10).

[1] "Electronic structure analysis illustrates that surface oxygen with p-band center adjacent to Fermi level and unsaturated vanadium atoms are active sites for CH bond breakage."
[2] "In terms of the monomeric vanadium oxides, i.e., structure I (Figure 5a), both AlOV and VO sites are highly active for the first CH bond activation with the energy barrier less than 0.15 eV."
[3] "The extraordinary CH bond rupture ability of monomeric vanadium oxide (structure I) results from the high surface oxygen activity in that the p-band center of surface oxygens (VO and VOAl) over structure I are very close to the Fermi level indicating the good electrons affinity."

[1] "This effect is in qualitative agreement with the experiment. An explanation can be derived from the bonding mechanism of CO to the Pt atom, in the framework of the Blyholder model (62) and the density of states (DOS)."

         [2] "The spectra point to the coexistence of GaPt aggregates in a slightly different chemical and/or electronic environment, as there are at least two sites visible giving rise to the bands at 2071 and 2046 cm-1, respectively."

[1] The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface.  

          [2] XPS studies show that the different behavior of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts may be attributed to the different interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species.

[1] The catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopyenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEMEDXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS).

          [2] In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state.

[1] "In accompany with the decomposition of original PtSn alloys, more accessible Pt sites would be generated and increase the catalytic activities."  

         [2] "The particle sizes of PtSn-0, PtSn-15, PtSn-60 and PtSn-180 catalysts are determined statistically to be 2.29, 1.97, 2.69, and 2.73 nm, respectively. It is confirmed that the mean particle size of PtSn-15 pretreated in steam for 15 min is the smallest among these samples."

         [3] "The decrease in catalytic activity is not attributed to the sintering of platinum particles since the particle sizes are even smaller after contacting with steam for a certain time."

[1] "On the oxidized surface, the reaction energy for the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen is 3.40 eV, while on the reduced surface, it is only 0.85 eV."

      [2] "Similarly, unsaturated C3 and C2 hydrocarbons have interaction strengths of 3-4 eV with the oxidized surface and 0.30-0.60 eV with the reduced surface." 

      [3] "The difference stems from electronic effects, i.e. surface basicity and nucleophilicity, as the oxidized surface exposes oxygen atoms with a Bader charge of -0.68e, while the exposed Cr atoms on the reduced surface have a positive charge (+1.56e)."

      [4] "As a consequence, the reaction mechanism is fundamentally different."

      [5] "In the former case, dehydrogenation steps are exothermic with low activation barriers (generally below 1.0 eV), while the reduced surface exhibits higher barriers (typically 1-2 eV) and the steps are generally endothermic."

[1] ZrO2 promoted with other metal oxides is a typical representative of such materials6 and has actually been used as a support for catalytically active Pt, CrOx, or GaOx species.3d However, the loading was too high to test the intrinsic support activity.
         [2] We initially selected metal oxides differing in oxygen surface mobility,8 that is, SiO2, Al2O3, 10Si90AlOx (10wt% SiO2 in Al2O3), 40Si60AlOx (40wt% SiO2 in Al2O3), and LaZrOx (10wt% La2O3 in cubic ZrO2). 
         [3] Remarkably, pristine LaZrOx with the weakest metaloxygen bond gave an even higher rate than the catalysts with Ru or RhNPs on SiO2Al2O3 and slightly lower than Pt/SiO2Al2O3.

[1] A series of ex/in situ characterizations further reveal the surface abundance of Ovac and coordinatively unsaturated Ti4c sites on the TiOx ultrathin nanosheet, whose concentration further boosts during the H2 reduction process, and a clear monotonous correlation between the concentration of Ovac and Ti4c sites and the catalytic dehydrogenation activity, indicating that the coordinatively unsaturated Ti sites can be identified as the more reactive centers with stronger CH bond activation ability. 

         [2] The formation of dynamic H adsorbates on tetracoordinated Ti4c sites during the PDH reaction effectively promotes CH bond activation and/or H2 desorption by altering the binding state of propane molecules during dehydrogenation and recombining with the H extracted from propane to form H2 and desorb, leading to more enhanced catalytic activity.

[1] The Ga2O3 nanoparticles in calcined Ga-CHA catalysts are not completely reduced in H2 until a temperature of 700 C is reached. [2] Ga2O3 particles are reduced to Ga+ by the hydrogen gas. [3] The consumption of BASs upon reduction and the lack of GaHx at 550 C show that extra-framework Ga+ is formed upon reduction at 700 C.

[1] The current dominant route for propene production is the steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, which relies on the raw materials from crude oil.  
[2] Compared with the nonoxidative process, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) would save 45.0% of the energy consumption because of the favorable thermodynamic features including exothermicity and lower reaction temperatures.
[3] However, the current ODHP processes have a big problem of the overoxidation of propene, which is more reactive than propane, into thermodynamically stable CO/CO2, resulting in insufficient propene selectivity.

[1] "Vanadium oxides have been widely investigated for both of PDH and ODH. In ODH, highly active V5+ species promotes the ready activation of propane via Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
[2] "Comparatively, the V3+ species was more active for PDH than V5+ species. However, this highly reductive V3+ species leads to severe coking." 
[3] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed binding energies in spectra of V 2p2/3 at 517.7, 516.8, and 515.7 eV were assigned to V5+, V4+, and V3+ ions, respectively."
[4] "For Mo1 V6, increasing ratios of V4+ and V3+ were observed, which are more selective for propylene than V5+."
[5] "DFT calculations on optimized V2O5- and Mo-doped V2O5 indicated the Mo doping in V2O5 increased the binding energy of VO bonds."

[1] Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene can be achieved using conventional, oxygen-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (O2ODHP) or via the use of soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogens/halides.
         [2] β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity.
         [3] The authors find the highest selectivity to the ODH product with FeNi/CeO2. DFT is used to rationalize this behavior by comparing the energy profiles for successive CH dissociation and CC dissociation reactions.
         [4] For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support.  
         [5] β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites.
