After the CO2-ODH reaction, CrOx was reduced, and only Cr3+ was observed in both 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts.

The fresh catalyst was first pretreated at 650 C for 30 min in the presence of 10%O2, followed by cooling down to room temperature for propane adsorption. After propane adsorption, the catalyst was purged at room temperature for 20 min. Adsorption of propane is evidenced by peaks at 1378 and 1456 cm1, corresponding to CH bending. Interestingly, three peaks appear in the region of 15001700 cm1 (i.e., 1560, 1616, and 1675 cm1) due to CC stretching, suggesting the formation of surface-adsorbed propylene. Desorption of propylene was observed when the catalyst was heated above 200 C. When propane and CO2 were coadsorbed on the catalyst surface, both propane and propylene peaks were observed (Figure 8b). Desorption of propylene occurs at above 200 C, similar to the case of propane adsorption only. In the temperature range studied (i.e., 25400 C), no CO peak was observed.

In fact, negligible CO2 chemisorption over the catalyst was observed based on the CO2-TPD study (Figure S5).

{"Quotes": "[1] Herein, we found zinc hydrides ([ZnH]+) as the highly reactive site for PDH. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that [ZnH]+ was transformed from zinc hydroxyl ([ZnOH]+) sites under reductive conditions.\n      [2] The optimized CuZnO@S-1 consists of exclusively isolated [ZnOH]+ sites, which help produce more [ZnH]+ toward optimal PDH activity. Specifically, the catalyst enables 43% propane conversion with >88% propylene selectivity, close to the thermodynamic equilibrium.  \n      [3] Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of ZnO@S-1 exhibit peaks at 1.52 and 3.05 Å (Figure 5b), which are attributed to the first ZnO shell and second ZnOZn shell coordination, respectively. (12,14) On the contrary, only one peak at 1.50 Å was identified for CuZnO@S-1, confirming that Cu can promote the formation of isolated Zn sites.\n      [4] Notably, the Zn k-absorption peak in CuZnO@S-1 shifts to lower energy than parent ZnO@S-1, revealing a slight decrease in the Zn oxidation state with Cu modification. (14)\n      [5] In situ DRIFTS measurements were performed to investigate the changes in the Zn speciation during the induction period. Figure 2b shows that the intensity of the ZnOH hydroxyl band (13) at 3635 cm−1 decreases with increasing temperature during exposure to propane. Together with the erosion of the 3635 cm−1 band, a band at 1844 cm−1 appears, which can be attributed to the formation of [ZnH]+ (Zn-hydride) species.

{"Quotes": "[1] PDH can be broadly grouped into two categories: non-oxidative and oxidative. In non-oxidative PDH, propane is catalytically dehydrogenated to produce stoichiometric amounts of propylene and hydrogen. It is endothermic (ΔH298Kθ = 124.3 kJ mol−1) and a volume-increasing reaction (C3H8 → C3H6 + H2), and thus is favored at high temperature and low pressure.\n\n      [2] Oxidants, usually O2, can be co-fed with propane to enhance the thermodynamic driving force in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process. This process is exothermic (ΔH298Kθ = 117 kJ mol−1) and thus the conversion of propane is no longer limited by thermodynamics.\n\n      [3] CO2-assisted ODHP (CO2-ODHP, C3H8 + CO2 → C3H6 + CO + H2O) could, in theory, improve the thermodynamics of PDH. CO2 has two advantages: i) consumes H2 through the reverse water-gas-shift reaction (RWGS: CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) increasing the equilibrium conversion of propane; ii) CO2 can remove coke via the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C → 2CO).", "English": "Yes, the article discusses the thermodynamic constraints and kinetic factors in propane dehydrogenation.
