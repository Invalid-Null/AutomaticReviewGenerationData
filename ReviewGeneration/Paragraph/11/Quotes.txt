[1] "Herein, we investigated the relationship between the structure and preparation conditions of Al2O3 and focused on adjusting the acidity of alumina by varying the calcination temperature." 

         [2] "The catalyst support not only serves as a scaffold but also provides a complex microenvironment, which is a key factor in determining the catalytic function [3]."

         [3] "The unique nanostructure of the synthesized rod-shaped alumina with quite a rough surface may contribute to the outstanding stability of the Cr-Al-800 catalyst."

         [4] "The lower acidity of the Cr-Al-800 catalyst rendered it a better anti-coking ability."

[1] "Phosphine modification of the catalysts was carried out in a chemical vapor deposition system (Nabertherm, Germany). Sodium hypophosphite monohydrate (Sionpharm, China) was put upstream in a crucible placed in the quartz tube, and the VOx/Al2O3 was placed in the downstream."  

         [2] "Experimental results revealed that the synergy among tuned acidity, lower coking precursor intimacy and faster propylene desorption after phosphorus modification accounted for the enhancement in catalytic stability during propane dehydrogenation."

         [3] "Furthermore, it weakened the interaction between vanadium species and alumina, and also reduced initial reactivity of the catalysts."

         [4] "However, weakened vanadium-support interaction made vanadium sites more repulsive to active intermediates and propylene products, which can desorb more easily from the catalysts surface."

[1] "When instead the reaction is carried out in the absence of molecular oxygen, the better isolation of the active sites may effectively control the availability of surface O2 sites and thereby limit the consecutive and parallel total combustion reactions."

"The catalytic cracking of propane to ethene and methane (Scheme 1, eq 2) is an undesired side reaction commonly observed on various MOx PDH catalysts, including Ga2O3."
         "The interaction between gallia nanoparticles and the silica support is found to introduce acidity. This results in more cracking and reduced selectivity compared to unsupported catalysts."

[1] "Silica, one of the popular inert supports, triggers the undesired formation of three-dimensional nanoparticles at significantly lower loadings than other conventional supports like Al2O3, TiO2, Nb2O5, or ZrO2. This observation has been ascribed to the lower reactivity of surface SiOH groups toward the precursor, compared to other metal hydroxyl groups on different supports." 
         [2] "The enhanced dispersion properties of im-SiO2 could be reproduced by adding 0.40 wt % Na+ using a 1 M Na(NO3) solution via incipient wetness impregnation to conventional-SiO2 to create Na+-promoted material (pro-SiO2)."
         [3] "It is hypothesized that the role of Na+ is to ion-exchange with surface silanols to form more-reactive SiONa+ anchoring sites. The silanol groups that would normally remain unreactive toward the metal oxide precursor now have the ability to function as an anchoring site."

[1] "Herein, a novel strategy for the synthesis of highly stable Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is developed, which is realized by the stabilization of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn sites in a zeolite framework"
         
         [2] "The high performance of Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts under a high reaction temperature is mainly due to a strong interaction between the Pt cluster and Sn-zeolite."
         
         [3] "The dispersion and stability of a Pt particle are the key factors, which essentially affect the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst."

[1] "The Si-BEA zeolite without Al species was obtained from the dealumination treatment of the commercial BEA zeolite with a Si/Al ratio of ∼ 20. The Co catalysts of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA were prepared through the vacuum impregnation method using supports of the BEA zeolites with/without Al species."

         [2] "The isolated Co2+ cations, which are anchored in the zeolite micropores through interaction with the silanol groups generated within dealumination process, dominate over the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst, as evidenced by a series of infrared, X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectral characterizations."

         [3] "The stable and unreducible Co2+ cations serve as the catalytically active sites exhibiting a high propylene selectivity of over 93% in the PDH reaction at 590 °C."

         [4] "The temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) result further reveals their preference to the activation of CH bonds with suppressing the cleavage of CC bonds in propane."

[1] "The effects of support and CO2 on PDH over VOx-based catalysts were systematically investigated by a combination of experiments and theoretical calculations."
         
         [2] "It was found that the activities of VOx vary significantly with oxide supports, among which the activity of VOx/ZrO2 is over 4 times higher than that of other samples." 
         
         [3] "The experiments and established scaling relationships based on density functional theory calculations reveal that the chemical states of bridge oxygen in the VO bond play critical roles in propane activation under the reductive condition, and the weaker VOxsupport interactions result in lower electron density of bridge oxygen and thus contributing to higher CH bond rupture capability as that of VOx/ZrO2."
         
         [4] "The basic principles established in the present study will help to further tune the micro-environment of the VO active site for high-performance PDH and CO2-PDH reactions."

[1] XPS studies show that the different behavior of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts may be attributed to the different interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species.  

          [2] These different support effects may derive from the catalysts' differing H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, probably caused by the differing interactions between the gallium oxide and the support.

[1] "In the reducer, the propane feedstock is oxidized by the lattice oxygen from metal oxides." 
         [2] "the core of CL-ODH using propane as the feedstock involves complex redox reactions in which propane molecules adsorb and dissociate on the surface of metal oxides, namely oxygen carriers."
         [3] "the diffusion of O2 significantly influences the surface reaction kinetics. Increasing the binding energy of VO bonds to inhibit the lattice oxygen diffusion is critical to enhance the propylene selectivity."

[1] The structure and catalytic properties of these Cr species are compared with those supported on γ-Al2O3, which is typically used in industrial DHP processes and is also known to contain well defined Cr site distribution depending on the Cr content. This will allow us to investigate the influence of the molecular structure, which is dependent on the nature of the support as evident from literature, of Cr species on DHP with identical Cr content and in some cases (at 1 wt% Cr) with similar Cr distribution.

[1] "The Mn0.05Ce0.95Ox, MnOx/CeO2, MnOx/SiO2, and MnO2 dominantly catalyze the combustion rather than ODHP, giving insufficient propene production rates with high selectivity to invaluable CO/CO2 (50.0–78.0%) (Figures 3b and S21)."
[2] "Compared with the general manganese oxide catalysts, the most significant advantage of MnOx/CeO2-SOSI is tuning the reaction pathways from combustion to the selective oxidative dehydrogenation." 
[3] "By the construction of manganese oxide with amorphous and layered structures on the ceria matrix, the obtained MnOx/CeO2-SOSI catalyst modulates surface oxygen to hinder the overoxidation of propene on the oxygen-deficient Mn sites."

[1] Relatively weak metal-support interaction appears to benefit C3H6 formation, such as SiO2.  
          [2] The nature of the support and its interaction with gallium oxide are crucial to manipulate the reactivity, and can be reflected in the differences in H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties.
          [3] TiO2-, ZrO2-, and Al2O3-supported Ga2O3 catalysts display higher activity than MgO- and SiO2-supported counterparts, again corroborating the crucial role of acid sites on Ga2O3 for C3H8 dehydrogenation.
