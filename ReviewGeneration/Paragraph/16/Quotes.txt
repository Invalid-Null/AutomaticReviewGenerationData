[1] In total, 2.5 g of the Si-Beta support was impregnated with an aqueous solution containing 74 mg SnCl4·5H2O, followed by drying at 60 C overnight and calcined at 560 C for 8 h. The powder mixture was then impregnated with an aqueous solution containing 18.3 mg H2PtCl6 and 28.6 mg KCl. After the impregnation of the metal precursors, the solid product was calcined at 350 C in static for 2 h. 
[2] The PtSn/MFI sample exhibits the highest specific activity (measured under kinetic region) for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, while the PtSn/Beta-600H2 and PtSn/SiO2-600H2 samples give the medium and lowest activity, respectively.

[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts show higher activity, selectivity and stability in light paraffin dehydrogenation. The effects of Sn on Pt have been widely researched, and it is well accepted that the addition of Sn leads Pt particle size to decrease and improve its catalytic performances [15], [16], [17], [18]."

      [2] "Compared to the monometal catalyst (0.3Pt/Al), a distinct decrease of ammonia desorption intensity is observed after the impregnation of Sn or In (0.3PtSn/Al or 0.3Pt/1.5InAl). From Table 2, it can be seen that the fractions of peaks I and II increase and the fraction of peak III evidently decreases with the addition of Sn and In in the catalysts, which indicates the decrease of ammonia desorption intensity is mainly ascribed to the loss of stronger acid sites."

      [3] "The evolution of the catalytic performances over the synthesized catalysts with different metallic compositions can be explained as following. First, according to the TEM images in Fig. 4, the smaller particle size and more homogeneous distribution of Pt are obtained after adding In or/and Sn constitutions in the catalysts, which is favor of improving the catalytic performances because much more metallic active sites are exposed."

[1] "In this work, we investigated the effects of cluster size and Sn content on cluster stability and PDH on PtxSny (x, y ≤ 4) clusters supported on γ-Al2O3(110)." 
         [2] "When two Sn atoms are added to Pt2, the most stable Pt2Sn2 structure has four PtSn bonds, all less than 3 Å long."  
         [3] "Addition of Sn to Ptx (x = 13) increases the first dehydrogenation barrier. The pattern that transpires is that the effect of a single Sn atom on increasing the activation energy is diminished as the size of Ptx grows."
         [4] "The trend of decreasing activity with Sn content is consistent with the increased barriers shown in Figure 3."
         [5] "High dehydrogenation barriers and low TOFs on Pt1Sn1 and Pt2Sn2 suggest that a Pt/Sn ratio of 1:1 results in inactivity. When there is an excess of Pt atoms relative to Sn in PtxSny (e.g., Pt2Sn1 and Pt3Sn1), moderate TOF values were observed."
         [6] "Furthermore, Pt1 promotes slight deep C3H6 conversion to cracked products, while Pt2 and Pt2Sn1 maintain high selectivity to C3H6."

[1] "Further addition of a Sn promoter has proved necessary to obtain the optimum catalyst.2"  

         [2] "In the case of Al2O3 supports, the coordinatively unsaturated aluminum atoms have a great impact on the anchoring Pt atoms and on maintaining high stability.6"

         [3] "Combining the results of the Sn 3d XPS (Figure2C) and the temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR; FigureS5), it could be confirmed that Sn is mainly present in the +2 valence state in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst.15"

         [4] "All of these results, especially the new band at 2010cm1 and the disappearance of the vibration at 2040cm1 in the CO DRIFT spectra, directly corroborate the hypothesis that there are strong electronic interactions between Pt and Sn in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst, while the reduced frequency of the CO vibration clearly demonstrates an increase in the electron density on Pt."

[1] This work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance.

[1] "Pt and PtSn catalysts supported on SiO2and γ-Al2O3and prepared by impregnation have been studied" 
         [2] "On γ-Al2O3tin interacts with the support and is stabilized in an oxidation state >0. The result is an increase in Pt dispersion and an improved stability of the catalytic activity without any change in the initial specific activity in dehydrogenation."
         [3] "On SiO2the Sn is more readily reduced, and alloy formation is possible. This leads to a similar increase in Pt dispersion and improved catalytic stability, but also to a strong reduction in the specific activity."

[1] Meanwhile, Sun and co-workers developed ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method to encage PtZn clusters around the 5- and 6-membered rings (MRs) of zeolites. (10) Both catalysts showed high specific activity (3.5 and 3.55 molC3H6 molPt1 s1 s1) and excellent long-term stability at high temperature.

         [2] In this work, we first confirmed the trade-off effect between the configuration diffusion length and surface diffusion by preparing PtZn clusters encapsulated in bulk zeolites with different crystal sizes.  

         [3] The novel finned structure of the zeolite for encapsulating metal species offers an opportunity to break the tradeoff effect. PtZn@S-1-Fin possessed some fins (3060 nm) growing epitaxially on the surface of zeolite seeds.  

         [4] On catalysis by PtZn@S-1-Fin, a highly productive PDH of up to 17.0 molC3H6 molPt1 s1 (WHSV = 360 h1) and a low deactivation constant of 0.0017 h1 (WHSV = 12 h1) were achieved.

[1] Sn is a widely utilized promoter for Pt catalysts. Alloying Pt with Sn can significantly alter the electronic and geometric structure of Pt sites.
          [2] The PtGa catalyst system has also been implemented in production plants (FCDh technique). Recently, Payard et al. investigated the structure-activity relationship over silica-supported PtGa nanoparticles at a molecular level.
          [3] In has also been developed as a promising promoter of Pt-based catalysts. Zha et al. reported that the bimetallic alloy (Pt3In) exhibited a high activity comparable to those of pure Pt and PtSn alloys and a considerable improvement in the propylene selectivity and stability compared to pure Pt.
          [4] Zn is another analogous but economical promoter for Pt-based catalysts. Cybulskis et al. investigated the explicit influence of introducing Zn to the Pt species. The Zn selectively tuned the valence orbitals and the surface electronic structure of Pt, resulting in increased product selectivity and stable catalytic performance.

[1] "A notable bimetallic combination is GaPt, where each individual component can be active in PDH but typically suffers from lower activity and facile deactivation when used separately."
         [2] "The primary preparation method for bimetallic GaPt catalysts, and others, has relied on sequential impregnations of oxide supports, followed by a reduction step yielding reduced surface species." 
         [3] "While synthetically straightforward and yielding improved catalytic performances, these approaches have led to difficulty in identifying the active sites due to low quantities of active species associated with the presence of large amounts of bulk species."

[1] "Although several attempts to do so have been reported, (8,10,3133) it remains a challenge to isolate the Pt atoms entirely within nests and to achieve performance characterized by high mass-specific activity, propene selectivity, and strong resistance to sintering and deactivation during PDH." 
         [2] "When the Pt:Al ratio was increased from 0.04 to 0.06 and 0.10 (at a constant Zn:Al ratio of 0.36), the mass of catalyst used for each test was decreased correspondingly to keep the space velocity (now defined as the molar flow rate of propane per Pt atom) unchanged. Virtually the same activity, selectivity, and stability were observed for reactions carried out for Pt:Al ratios of 0.04 and 0.06."  
         [3] "For 0.1Pt-0.36Zn-DeAlBEA, for which Zn:Pt = 3.6, the activity and selectivity were similar to that observed for higher Zn:Pt ratios, but the catalyst was less stable (the first-order deactivation rate constant kdeac increased from 0.004 to 0.014 h1, Figure S31B in the Supporting Information), indicating that the Zn:Pt ratio should be kept at values >4 in order to maintain catalyst stability."

[1] Compared with the monometallic catalyst, the bimetallic catalysts with Sn doping showed higher selectivity and better stability. 
[2] Accordingly, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al (i.e., Pt/Sn mole ratio is 1/2) was chosen as the catalyst for periodic reaction-regeneration operation.
[3] Moreover, Pt and Pt3Sn overlapped into one asymmetric peak due to very adjacent position.  
[4] When the catalyst was subjected to repeated regeneration by Redox, the Pt3Sn diffraction is predominant over 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox, indicating that not only metal agglomeration but also phase transition to Pt3Sn occur.
[5] As expected, more defects and lower graphitization degree of the coke should imply higher H content.

[1] "Decreasing the size of Pt clusters can be achieved by alloying with, for example, Cu, (28) Zn, (8,10,14,21) Fe, (29) Ga, (30) In, (31) Sn, (1,11,24) Mn, (32) Co, (33) or La. (4)" 

         [2] "We have recently demonstrated stabilization of Pt predominantly as isolated atoms by interaction with SiOZn-OH nests formed by grafting Zn into silanol nests of dealuminated zeolite β (DeAlBEA). (21)"

         [3] "Characterization of the resulting catalyst (referred to as PtZn-DeAlBEA) showed that, upon activation, Pt is present as structures approximated as (Si-O-Zn)4-6Pt, which are highly active, selective, and stable for PDH."

         [4] "Motivated by these findings, we asked whether the activity and stability of such sites could be further enhanced by placing them on the external surface of a zeolite support rather than within zeolite micropores." 

         [5] "A two-step method was used to prepare isolated PtZn sites supported on SPP. First, SiOZn-OH groups were grafted onto the support hydroxyl groups, (40) and these groups were then used to anchor Pt atoms.

         [3] "The Pt3Ga intermetallic alloys on hierarchical zeolites exhibit an initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion), and the conversion remains >8% after 30 days of reaction."

         [4] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions."

[1] "Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their excellent activity." 
         [2] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability [7], [8]."

[1] Herein, we showed that the synthesis pH value of B-ZrO2 has a significant effect on the catalytic performance of PtSn/B-ZrO2 in PDH with Pt loading around 0.35 wt%.
        
        [2] PtSn-based catalyst is more environmentally benign and thus more widely used [3, 7].
        
        [3] The results reveal that the interaction between Pt and Sn is influenced by their respective interaction with the support and a moderate interaction between the metal species and the support is desired.

[1] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts such as Pt-Ti [9], Pt-Ga [6], [10], Pt-Cu [1], Pt-Sn [11], [12], [13], and Pt-Zn [14] have been intensively investigated in the past decades, and the Oleflex PDH process with Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst has been successfully commercialized by UOP [6]." 
[2] "Zn, a highly abundant and non-toxic metal, has been explored as a promising modifier of Pt for PDH, but receives much less attention than the post-transition-metals Ga [6], [10] and Sn [11], [12]."

[1] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation."
         [2] "Relative to the Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts in which Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on Al2O3 and modified by the addition of a post-transition metal such as tin (Sn) exhibit higher selectivity." 
         [3] "Performance depends critically on forming intermetallic PtSn NPs that improve propylene selectivity and enhance stability by reducing the rate of hydrogenolysis and coke formation (12)."

[2] Supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been widely used because of their high activities and environmentally friendly characteristics [1, 2].

[4] Zhou's group [20] investigated propane dehydrogenation over ZSM-5-supported Pt-Sn catalysts and found that the propylene selectivity was significantly improved by introducing promoters to neutralize the support acidity.

[5] PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability.

[1] "CO adsorption and desorption, as studied by IR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry has been used to characterize PtNaY and PtxSnyNaY samples."  
         [2] "The catalytic properties of these materials were studied by using propane dehydrogenation and propane hydrogenolysis."
         [3] "In contrast the hydrogenolysis properties are deeply depressed by alloying Pt to Sn, these changes being attributed to a dilution effect rather than to an electronic effect."

[1] It has been demonstrated that the addition of secondary metal elements to Pt-based catalysts could decrease the number of multiple adsorption sites through partially blocked surface (ensemble effect) and/or change the electron density of states (ligand effect) [12], [13], [14], [15].
         
         [2] Thus, introducing promoters (Sn [16], [17], [18], [19], In [20], Ga [21], [22], [23], Mn [24], Cu [25], Zn [26], [27], etc.) into Pt can not only decrease the size of Pt clusters but also increase the electron density of Pt atoms, consequently affecting the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts in various catalyses.

         [3] "Several questions need to be answered about the workability of such a coating for bimetallic NPs. First is to confirm whether the active sites remain accessible to the reactants. Second would be to determine if there are any interactions between the catalyst and the coating layer. A third aspect is if and how the activity toward propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is altered. Fourth is to see the effect of applying such a coating on the alloy formation and finally to verify if this coating indeed prevents coke formation and sintering of the catalyst."

[1] Tin is a well-known promoter of Pt group metals that has been studied in a wide variety of reactions [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27].
        
        [2] For example, the addition of Sn to Pt propane dehydrogenation catalysts increased selectivity to propene while decreasing catalyst deactivation due to coke formation [5], [7], [8], [28], [29], [30].
        
        [3] Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts exhibited a decrease in H2 and CO uptake as the Sn content increased.
        
        [4] Addition of Sn to Pt propane dehydrogenation catalysts increased selectivity to propene while decreasing catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.
        
        [5] The promotional role of Sn on Pt catalysts has been attributed to both electronic and geometric effects.
        
        [6] Computational modeling has suggested Pt-Sn alloys can improve the stability of propane dehydrogenation activity while decreasing the catalyst activity by increasing the barrier for dissociative adsorption of propane.
        
        [7] The trend in the normalized rate of propane conversion over SiO2-supported catalysts supports the idea that Pt-Sn alloy formation improves stability while decreasing activity.

[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation reaction for the production of propylene."
      
      [2] "The Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst has been successfully commercialized in propane dehydrogenation known as Oleflex process developed by the UOP company."
      
      [3] "In this study, we investigate the impact of the structure of different Al2O3 supports on the stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation, and the structure-stability-regenerability relationship was elucidated."
      
      [4] "The Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalysts developed in this study display high propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity above 98% at 570 C."

[1] "For propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a key reaction of great industrial incentives1,2,3,4." 
         [2] "Recently, the subnanometric PtSnOx cluster encapsulated into SiO2 MFI zeolite (PtSnOx@MFI) was shown to be a promising solution to achieve both high activity and low deactivation rate of catalytic PDH reaction7."
         [3] "The catalytic role of zeolite remains elusive due to the difficulty to characterize the active site inside zeolite tunnels."
         [4] "The catalytic kinetics of PDH on representative active sites is therefore clarified. Our results reveal a mortise-and-tenon joinery mechanism for forming confined clusters in zeolite that leads to grow stable clusters within 10 atoms. While two types of structural units, i.e., Sn4O4 cluster with [SnO3] coordinations and PtSn alloys, are both thermodynamically viable in zeolite, only the PtSn clusters with a high Pt:Sn ratio (>1:1) are catalytically active for PDH."

[1] "It was reported that the addition of Sn to Pt can increase the selectivity toward propylene but decrease the initial propane conversion [11], [13], [63]."

         [2] "Hansen et al. also reported that in the ethane dehydrogenation the activity of Pt is higher than that of Pt3Sn, but the ethylene selectivity of Pt is lower than that of Pt3Sn [23]."

         [3] "Comparing the catalytic performance between Fe3Ga1/γ-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3-supported Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts, one can see that the non-precious catalyst shows much better catalytic stability and selectivity than Pt/γ-Al2O3 and achieves similar catalytic activity as the Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst after 10 h of reaction."

         [4] "In addition, Fig. 9b shows the result of the peak split fitting of the Ga 2p3/2 XPS spectra for the 14 h-spent catalyst. The peak of the Ga0 species at 1116.7 eV can be clearly observed on the spent catalyst [73]. However, the Ga species of the fresh catalyst was hardly reduced to Ga0 at 700 C in the reducing atmosphere of hydrogen."

         [5] "The TEM measurement further provides evidence in support of the formation of the Fe3Ga1 intermetallic compound in the 14 h-spent catalyst (see Fig. 9c)."

[1] Promoter addition, affording bimetallic and/or alloying systems such as PtSn, PtIn, PtGa, PtIr, PtCu, or even trimetallic Pt-SnIn, has been found to be effective in improving propene selectivity and suppressing coke formation by increasing Pt dispersion or diluting Pt ensembles, and changing the electronic environment of Pt atoms.
         
         [2] 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 afforded a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 °C with a conversion close to the equilibrium.
         
         [3] 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 displays a specific activity of 0.96 s-1 at 550 °C and 1.46 s-1 at 600 °C, higher than those for 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 or 0.46 wt % Pt/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3.

      [3] "A propylene selectivity of above 99%, initial propane conversion of 50%, low deactivation rate of 0.006 h1, high TOF of 114 s1, and good regenerability have been achieved in the Pt-Sn2.00/Sn-Beta catalyst for propane dehydrogenation at 570 C, and these performances are higher than those achieved in the state-of-the-art catalysts reported in the reference."

[1] "One difficulty of propane oxydehydrogenation is that propylene oxidizes much more easily than that of propane." 

[2] "The selectivity of propylene can be very high in the propane dehydrogenation using bi-metallic catalysts."

[3] "The selectivity enhancement of propylene in the oxydehydrogenation is attributed to the formation of PtSn alloy particles on BN support."

[4] "Compared with the traditional γ-Al2O3 support, BN exhibits an unique property of minimum metalsupport interference thus PtSn alloy can be formed easily during H2 reduction."  

[5] "The selectivity of propylene is greatly improved without sacrificing the conversion in oxydehydrogenation."

[1] Catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41 possessing highly dispersed VOx species in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (DH) was compared with that of industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 over four DH (24 h on-stream) and oxidative regeneration cycles. 

         [2] Alumina-supported Pt catalysts are used in the Oleflex and STAR processes. In order to achieve high alkene selectivity and extended on-stream stability, Pt must be alloyed with other elements such as Sn, Ge, or In.

         [3] PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared according to [6] using commercial alumina carrier (NORPRO, Saint-Gobain, 93 m2/g).

[1] A PtZn alloy nanoparticle catalyst for propane dehydrogenation was synthesized by simple coimpregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Zn(NO3)2 onto a mesoporous material, which was built with siliceous MFI zeolite nanosheets. 
      [2] Compared to disordered alloys, the intermetallic alloys having an ordered arrangement of atoms with a specific composition and definite crystal structure can exhibit a greater reduction in Pt ensemble size.
      [3] The PtZn intermetallic alloy supported on mesoporous zeolite exhibited outstanding durability and stability.

[1] Hence, the exploitation of high-activity catalysts capable of good catalytic performance in PDH reaction at low temperature is quite urgent. 

         [2] The as-prepared 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst shows outstanding catalytic activity (propylene productivity rate 0.5 mol/gcat.·h) close to its equilibrium conversion (24.5%) with much better stability (deactivation constant: 0.007 h1) at 450 C.

         [3] Among all the catalysts, the 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 shows the best catalytic performance with 21.8% propane conversion and 90.7% propylene selectivity initially, which is very close to its thermal dynamics equilibrium conversion of propane at this reaction condition, which is 25% at the same reaction condition obtained by HSC thermodynamic simulation.

[1] "The PtSn/Al2O3 is a prototypical industrial catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH)." 
         [2] "Recently, there were a large amount of works reported to control over the size of PtSn bimetallic nanoparticles by confining them in the framework of the zeolites (e.g., MFI [20, 21], ZSM-5 [22, 23], etc.), protecting the particles with organic ligands (PtSn/MgAl2O4) [24], tuning the morphology of the supports (e.g., Al2O3-nanosheet [25], nanodiamond@graphene support [7], etc.), and fixing Sn in the support (e.g., Pt/MgSnAl-LDHs [26], Pt/Sn-Beta [27], etc.)."

[1] "Pt/Al2O3and PtSn/Al2O3catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."

         [2] "Three different peaks were identified from the TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst and attributed to different types of coke; coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier."
