         [2] "The atomic plane distances were measured as 0.286 nm, agreeing with a lattice spacing of intermetallic Pt1Zn1 along with the [110] directions, which implies the highly exposed (110) facets in these PtZn IMAs."

By using the newly developed iDPC technique, the atomic structure of the MFI zeolite can be recorded simultaneously with the HR HAADF-STEM image under low-dose conditions. As presented in Fig. 3d, the detailed structure of the MFI zeolite can be clearly identified in the iDPC image, even the 5R units in the framework. Since HR HAADF-STEM imaging is more sensitive to heavy elements (Pt in this work), and the structural information of the zeolite framework is finely captured by iDPC imaging, the precise location of subnanometric Pt clusters can be reliably identified by correlating the paired images. The results demonstrate that Pt clusters of 0.4–0.6 nm are preferentially located in the sinusoidal channels.
         
         We have achieved a very high preference for localization of highly stable subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite, as revealed by atomically resolved electron microscopy combining high-angle annular dark-field and integrated differential phase contrast imaging techniques.

[1] "The morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta support were directly investigated by electron microscopy and the representative results are shown in Fig. 2."
         [2] "Temperature-programmed desorption studies were performed to get some insight into intrinsic features of 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta in PDH reaction."

[1] "The catalyst samples were imaged using an FEI Titan 80300 operating at 300kV."

      [2] "Samples analyzed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) were prepared by dispersing the powders in cyclohexane (99.5%, anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich) and sonicating for 1h before mounting on Cu-supported holey carbon grids." 

      [3] "Representative STEM images used to analyze particle sizes of samples after regeneration can be found in the Supplemental Materials (Fig. S4 (SiO2) and S5 (Al2O3)) and a summary of the particle sizes can be found in Table 3."

[From Answer 5] The HAADF-STEM images in Fig. 5 were obtained after increasing the metal loading to 4.0 wt% Pt and 4.0 wt% Y for the purpose of STEM investigation. As these images show, the metal particles in PtY(4)/MZ-sf-Br increased to approximately 3 nm in diameter. In these larger particles, the L12 superlattice of the Pt3Y-type intermetallic compound was observed (Fig. 5c).  
       [From Answer 5] Moreover, the EDS line-scan measurement showed the co-existence of Pt and Y metals in a single particle with an approximately 3:1 atomic ratio (Fig. 5d).
       [From Answer 6] The alloy nanoparticles were prepared by impregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Y(NO3)3 , followed by calcination in O2 and reduction with H2. This conventional method is often used to support metal catalysts that are reducible with H2 (i.e., elements with a sufficiently high reduction potential), such as Ni, Pd, and Pt.

[1] "Figure 4a indicates the presence of individual brighter Pt atoms in Cu nanoparticles."

      [2] "Single Pt atoms in Cu nanoparticles are repeatedly observed in different regions of the reduced 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, and no clusters or nanoparticles of Pt on γ-alumina are found."

      [3] "HAADF-STEM images of 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 after successive oxidation-reduction cycles show that Pt atoms identified from their higher brightness comparing to their surrounding area are still individually dispersed in Cu nanoparticles, confirming its good cycle stability."

[1] "Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images show that small discrete clusters, with sizes ranging from 0.9-1.6nm and a mean diameter of 1.3nm, are homogenously distributed on the surface of the Al2O3 nanosheet."

[2] "STEM analysis showed that the size and morphology of Pt-Sn clusters supported on the Al2O3 sheet had undergone negligible changes even after a 24h dehydrogenation reaction, which demonstrates the excellent sintering resistance of this catalyst."

[1] "HAADF-STEM images and corresponding metal particle size distributions of the fresh and used catalysts are shown in Fig. 3."
         [2] "Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of the fresh catalyst and the used ones regenerated under different conditions." 
         [3] "Fig. 5 shows the HRTEM images of the fresh catalyst and the used ones regenerated under different conditions."

[1] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis (Figure 1e) can capture nanosheets standing on their edges with the thickness estimated to be around 12 nm (only nanosheets parallel or at a small angle to the electron beam can be observed, while those perpendicular to the electron beam are difficult to observe due to the ultrathin character)." 
         [2] "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis (Figure 1c,d) confirmed that the majority of synthesized nanosheets were around 1.5 nm thick, which agrees well with the estimation from HR-TEM images, with the coexistent small portion of thicker nanosheets." 
         [3] "The thicker nanosheets were deliberately intercepted (Figure 1d), and the thickness was around 3.5 nm, which may result from the stacking of nanosheets."
