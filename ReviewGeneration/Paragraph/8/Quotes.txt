[1] "Cr-based catalysts are among the most active catalysts for the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. (25,2830)"
         [2] "CrOx is the key component of the industrial catalyst used in the CATOFIN process for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene." 
         [3] "Among the metal oxide catalysts, Cr-based catalysts have been reported to be among the most promising for the CO2-ODH reaction. For example, mesoporous silica (i.e., MCM-41)-supported metal oxides exhibit activity in the following order: Cr > Ga > Ni, V > Fe, Mn, and Co for CO2-ODH."

[1] "The Oleflex process employs fluidized bed reactors with Pt-based catalysts, with propane conversion and propylene selectivity of 3040% and 85.588%, respectively."[8, 9]
         [2] "Compared with other catalysts, Pt-based catalysts show the highest turnover frequency (TOF) in PDH (Table 1). TOF normalized by Pt, or TOFPt, varies substantially with the support, the alloying metal, and the catalyst preparation method."
         [3] "Addition of a second metal to form bimetallic (intermetallic PtM, PtM alloy, or PtMOx clusters, M = metal) catalysts, such as PtSn,[32-34] PtGa,[35-38] PtZn,[30, 39-41] PtCu,[42], and PtCo,[43] can reduce the particle size of Pt, thereby improving the catalytic activity and inhibiting coke formation."

[1] "A commercial Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, supplied by Nikki Chemical (N401 AG), was used."
         [2] "In this work, propane dehydrogenation over a Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, supplied by Nikki Chemical (N401 AG), was used."
         [3] "This work demonstrated that TZFBR and ICFBR reactors can be used in the catalytic propane dehydrogenation to obtain steady-state operation."
         [4] "Yields of propene up to 30% have been achieved, which are comparable to the highest yields reported in conventional reactors, where the coke formation causes the catalyst deactivation and a decrease of conversion with the time on stream."

[1] "Comparing the catalyst prepared with the solgel method containing 7 wt% V2O5 [30] and the V10Si catalyst reported here demonstrates that the two samples behaved similarly under anaerobic conditions (with very similar plots of selectivity to propylene as a function of conversion), but the solgel catalyst gave better selectivity than the FP catalyst under co-feed conditions."
         [2] "This indicates that the hydroxyl groups did not play a negative role in selectivity when the reaction was carried out in the absence of molecular oxygen."

         [4] "The Pt3Sn phase forms at the surface of Pt in the early stage of alloy formation, and Sn propagates gradually to the center of the particle as a result of Sn diffusion."  
         [5] "With the introduction of Sn and the formation of a Pt3Sn alloy, the initial propane conversion increases to 40%, and the propene selectivity increases to 92%, which is attributed to the geometric effect and electronic effect of the Pt-Sn alloy."
         [6] "The formation rate of propene over Pt-Sn/SBA-15 is 20 mol C3H6·gPt1·h1, much higher than the 8 mol C3H6·gPt1·h1 over Pt/SBA-15, suggesting excellent activity of the Pt-Sn catalyst."

[1] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction."

[2] "NH3-TPD studies of the polymorphs of gallium oxide show that acid sites of medium strength are abundant on the surface of these catalysts, particularly β-Ga2O3."

[3] "When the reactivity of the polymorphs is correlated with the results of acidity measurements, it can be concluded that the surface acid site density probably plays a decisive role in the competition between the polymorphs."

[1] "Recently, the propane dehydrogenation to propylene becomes one of the most promising and attractive techniques for the production of propylene because the success in the large-scale exploitation of shale gas can supply an abundance of cheap propane for this process. In fact, this process has been commercialized by the UOP company, which is operated with the moving bed reactor based on an alumina-supported Pt catalyst."

         [2] "Herein, a novel strategy for the synthesis of highly stable Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is developed, which is realized by the stabilization of Pt clusters onto the isolated Sn sites in a zeolite framework"

         [3] "An initial propane conversion of 50%, high propylene selectivity of above 99%, low deactivation rate of 0.006 h1, high TOF of 114 s1, and good regenerability have been achieved in the Pt-Sn2.00/Sn-Beta catalyst for propane dehydrogenation at 570 C."

[1] "The pronounced effect of Sn on RhSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation" 

[2] "Sn addition to Rh results in RhSn alloy, lowering the barrier for propylene desorption."

[3] "RhSn alloy suppresses the sintering of Rh, resulting in high stability."

[1] "On the other hand, Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) showed high propylene selectivity of 96% even at the initial activity at 30 s."

[2] "C3H8 TPD curves exhibit that methane (m/z: 16) desorption is maximized at the temperature where desorption of propane and propylene stops, indicating that methane is mainly generated by the cracking of intermediates through deep dehydrogenation."

[3] "Therefore, we conclude that suppressing the cracking through deep dehydrogenation is the main effect of Sn on Rh for PDH."

The propane conversion has little decline and keep at higher level above 58.0% until 25 h reaction for the PtSnIn/1.5CaAl catalyst in propane dehydrogenation reaction, which is evidently better than the catalysts reported in recent literatures."

[1] "Many studies have reported that nanocarbons (such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbons, and activated carbons) are green materials that have drawn much attention owing to their high thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties, which have been studied for decades in adsorption, separation, electrochemistry, and heterogeneous catalysis."

      [2] "In heterogeneous catalysis, nanocarbons impregnated with metal and/or metal oxides are usually used for electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and photoelectrocatalysis."

      [3] "Recently, many studies have reported that nanocarbons could be directly used as metal-free catalysts for PDH and exhibit activities comparable to those of noble metal and/or metal oxide catalysts."

Ga2O3/SIRAL10 was evaluated as a promising metal oxide catalyst for PDH. In situ IR results show that pure Ga2O3/SIRAL10 has a small peak corresponding to propylene, indicating it is active for PDH. 
         Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10 initiated a propylene STY of 1.61 kg kgCat.1•h1, while PtSn(I) and 20 wt % CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts produced lower propylene STYs (1.33 kg kgCat.1 h1 for PtSn(I) and 1.04 kg kgCat.1 h1 for 20 wt % CrOx/Al2O3) when the temperature and WHSV were 600 C and 3.5 h1, respectively (Figure 3c).

[1] Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none.
         [2] Relatively weak metalsupport interaction appears to benefit C3H6 formation, such as SiO2. In the presence of CO2, the partially oxidized Cr2O3 surface and the boundaries of Cr2O3 and SiO2, are responsible for the improved C3H6 yield.
         [3] The catalytic performance of Ga2O3 polymorphs for CO2ODHP decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α. Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the same order, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3.
         [4] Characterization results confirm the homogeneous mixing of Ga with Zr in the Ga2O3ZrO2 oxides with strong interactions, as well as the monotonic increase in Lewis acid sites with the increase in Ga content in the oxides.
         [5] Cr2O3/SiO2 outperforms the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3.

[1] "The catalytic activity of CrOx/SiO2 (SC, 0.08 to 0.99% chromium by weight), CrOx/Al2O3 (AC, 0.16 to 1.55%), and α-Cr2O3 for the dehydrogenation of propane has been investigated at 723 to 823 K in a flow apparatus."

[1] The article evaluates metal phosphide catalysts based on Ru for propane dehydrogenation. The Ru phosphide catalysts are systematically tuned by changing the P/Ru ratio during synthesis. The catalysts show improved propane dehydrogenation performance compared to monometallic Ru nanoparticles. In particular, the RuP (Ru phosphide with 1:1 Ru:P ratio) catalyst achieves 91% propylene selectivity at 25% propane conversion, much higher than Ru nanoparticles.
