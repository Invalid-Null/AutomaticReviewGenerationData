1. No relevant quotes found. The article does not compare the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

         2. No relevant quotes found. The article does not evaluate any Pt alloy catalysts like Pt-Sn, Pt-Ga, Pt-Zn for propane dehydrogenation. No specific data or insights are provided.

         3. No relevant quotes found. The article does not investigate electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. No specific examples or structure-function insights are revealed.
         
         4. No relevant quotes found. The article does not explore the use of subsurface promoters like Re or Mn in bimetallic and alloy catalysts to tune selectivity. No specific examples or data are provided.

         5. No relevant quotes found. The article does not describe any synergistic effects between metals in bimetallic or alloy catalysts, attributed to ensemble and/or ligand effects. No specific examples or explanations are provided.

         6. No relevant quotes found. The article does not evaluate any zeolite supports like MFI, FER, or BEA structures for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. No specific examples, data, or insights are provided.
         
         7. No relevant quotes found. The article does not investigate the effects of tuning zeolite Si/Al ratio or incorporating mesoporosity on propane dehydrogenation catalyst performance. No specific examples or structure-function relationships are revealed.

[1] "H-ZSM-5 zeolite-supported Ga (Ga/H-ZSM-5) has been considered as not only a promising PDH catalyst for its high selectivity but also an effective catalyst in propane dehydroaromatization (the Cyclar process)."

[1] A PtZn alloy nanoparticle catalyst for propane dehydrogenation was synthesized by simple coimpregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Zn(NO3)2 onto a mesoporous material, which was built with siliceous MFI zeolite nanosheets.
      [2] The Pt1Zn1 intermetallic alloy catalyst supported on mesoporous zeolite exhibited outstanding catalytic durability, which was the highest among those of the reported Pt-based alloy catalysts to the best of our knowledge.
