[1] "A Pt3Mn subsurface instead of Pt significantly improved the CH activation selectivity during propane dehydrogenation by lowering the heats of hydrocarbon and hydrogen adsorption of the surface sites."
      
         [2] "Models presented herein provide a beginning to microkinetic modeling to help in directly identifying the driving force for selectivity differences."
      
         [3] "This work highlights the distinct role of subsurface layers for altering the surface chemical and catalytic properties on NP catalysts."

         <quote>4. 答案:没有,这篇文章没有探索像Re或Mn这样的双金属和合金催化剂中次表面促进剂的使用来调节选择性。它只关注没有任何次表面促进剂的铬氧化物催化剂。</quote>
         <quote>4. 答案:没有,这篇文章没有探索使用例如Re或Mn等亚表面促进剂在双金属和合金催化剂中调节选择性。它仅研究支撑的单金属Cr催化剂。</quote>
