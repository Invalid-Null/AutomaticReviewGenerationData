[1] "Although this technique has been commercialized for decades, thermally induced deactivation is still a big problem." 

[2] "Exploring catalysts with high stability and propylene selectivity is still urgent to meet further demand for industrial production."

[1] "The development of alternative catalysts, at low cost and high stability, to replace the industrial Pt-based catalysts is a long-term pursuit for the PDH reaction."
      [2] "Although interest in MNC (where M refers to transition metals) materials has recently flourished in the rational design of stable SACs due to strong covalent bonding between the N species and M1 metal, to date most studies have focused on regulation of inner-shell coordination N species, whereas the effect of the outer-shell N species on single-atom sites and catalytic properties has attracted little attention." 
      [3] "In summary, we developed a highly efficient and stable Ru1/NC SAC for the high-temperature PDH reaction."

[1] "Despite the experimental observation and theoretical prediction of oxygen vacancies in ZrO2 for PDH, the intrinsic mechanism of the effects of oxygen vacancies on PDH performance has not been completely understood yet, and ZrO2 without promoters generally displays poor activity toward the direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes." 

         [2] "We anticipate this work may shed light on both the fundamental research of catalysis and the chemical industry."

[1] "Despite efforts toward the development of Au oxidation catalysts, work on less reactive alkanes, such as propane, is lacking."

         [2] "One short report published more than a decade ago claimed that Au/TiO2/SiO2 oxidized propane to produce only CO2 (
         ) and acetone (
         ) at rather low yields (
         )."  

         [3] "More recent work on propane oxidation over various gold-supported metal oxides (e.g., CoOx, MnOx, CuO, Fe2O3, and CeO2) yielded only CO2 and H2O."

[1] "Despite the mounting evidence supporting the correlation between paired framework Al sites density and enhanced PDH activity, the identity of the highly active Ga species remains controversial." 

         [2] "Little experimental evidence has been gathered regarding the composition and structure of the most active Ga species, though several structures have been proposed via computational studies."
         
         [3] "The assignments of the infrared bands located at 2037 and 2053 cm−1 to [GaH2]+ and [GaH]2+ species, respectively, also need to be reassessed." 
         
         [4] "X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) was repeatedly employed to determine the oxidation state of Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, the low absolute Ga loadings, at which Ga2O22+ is the primary Ga species in the sample, make it difficult to provide definitive information."
         
         [5] "Infrared bands at 2037 and 2053 cm−1 upon H2 treatment of Ga/H-ZSM-5 are attributed to HGa2O2+···H+ cation pair (Scheme 1) via the heterolytic dissociative adsorption of H2 on Ga2O22+. HGa2O2+···H+ is not a stable species, as its IR band decays quickly under vacuum at 550 °C via the reformation of Ga2O22+ and desorption of H2."
         
         [6] "The Ga loading on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042) is 0.28 wt %, which is at least a factor of 3 lower than those employed in previous studies."

[1] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
         
         [2] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."

[1] "A major drawback of FeMFI zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propene yield." 
         [2] "Further research will be undertaken to clarify this aspect."

[1] "The high cost of Pt and environmental issues of CrOx drive researchers to explore efficient nonprecious and nontoxic alternatives." 
         [2] "In this context, a review about the synthesis and structure-function relationships of these molecular sieve-supported materials for PDH reaction is necessary and informative."
         [3] "Therefore, the development of highly efficient propylene production technologies is of vital importance."
         [4] "In particular, the ab initio metadynamics simulations can screen the potential reactions between active center and given reactants, which is different from the conventional transition state calculations that typically predefined a reaction pathway."

[1] "As a result, the nature of active Cr species in Cr catalysts during DHP remains elusive and is still a subject of debate [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]."
         [2] "In the present work, a series of Cr catalysts with varying Cr content (0.510 wt%) was prepared aiming to create a well defined Cr site distribution in the catalysts and thereby to derive the catalytic function of each specific Cr species."
