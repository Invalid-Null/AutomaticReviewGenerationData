[1] X represents the Conv/Conveq wherein Conveq is the equilibrium conversion (calculated by Aspen Plus) under corresponding conditions.
         [2] Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive technology for propylene production that has received extensive attention. Molecular sieve supports possess a larger specific surface area and well-defined pores/cavities, which have been proven to possess stronger capability to prevent subnanometric metal species from sintering.

[1] Due to endothermicity, PDH is generally operated at a high temperature of about 600 C.
         [2] The abstraction of α-H (C3H7*···H*, Figure 2a) having a slightly lower barrier of 0.71 eV, consistent with the previous works. 
         [3] The adsorption energies of propylene (Ead(C3H6)) present a strong correlation with E(C3H7*···H*), E(C3H7* + H*), and E(H* + C3H6*···H*), respectively.

[4] The isolated Co2+ cations, which are anchored in the zeolite micropores through interaction with the silanol groups generated within dealumination process, dominate over the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst, as evidenced by a series of infrared, X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectral characterizations. The stable and unreducible Co2+ cations serve as the catalytically active sites exhibiting a high propylene selectivity of over 93 % in the PDH reaction at 590 C.

[1] "On VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy."
         
         [2] "For the CO2ODHP reaction, the reaction is endothermic and not a spontaneous reaction at room temperature because of its highly positive Gibbs free energy." 
         
         [3] "CO2ODHP is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."

[1] To overcome thermodynamic limitations (∆G°298K = 124 kJ/mol), the PDH reaction has to be conducted at high temperatures (550–650 °C)" (Introduction, paragraph 1). It also mentions kinetic factors such as the rate determining step, saying "The rate-determining step was concluded to be H2 formation." (Conclusions)

4. The article discusses how propane dehydrogenation is thermodynamically unfavorable and subject to rapid catalyst deactivation. It provides the dissociation energies of the CH, CC, and CO bonds in propane and CO2 molecules.

[1] "On the other hand, the further enhancement of the performance of the optimal catalyst for a given reaction is inherently limited by the Sabatier principle."
           [2] "Thus, driven by the strong desire to discover alternative catalysts, various metal oxides such as Ga2O3, (35) VOx, (69) ZrO2, (1012) CeO2, (13,14) ZnO, (15,16) and TiO2 (17,18) have been extensively studied, among which Ga2O3 is one of the most promising."

[1] To have a comprehensive understanding of the whole process, the main endothermic side reactions that may happen are also listed as follows:  

         C3H8 → CH4 + C2H4 (ΔH298 = 98.9 kJ/mol)  

         C3H8 → 3C + 4H2 (ΔH298 = 119.5 kJ/mol)

         [2] It can be observed that the primary reaction (reaction 1) is a thermodynamically limited endothermic process with an increase in the number of gas molecules, indicating that a high temperature (823–973 K) coupled with moderately low partial pressure (1 bar) is necessary to achieve desirable thermodynamic equilibrium.

[1] "Since the high endothermicity of the PDH reaction (ΔH = 124.3 kJ mol−1), an elevated operating temperature (>600 °C) is required to obtain sufficient propylene yield."

         [2] "From a fundamental perspective, the side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, and deep dehydrogenation to coke, are believed to be structure-sensitive reactions, only happening on particles with adjacent Pt segments, whereas the PDH is a structure-insensitive process, which could occur on isolated Pt sites."

[1] The endothermic nature of propane to propylene conversion necessitates the use of high temperatures which ultimately leads to deep dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis (CC bond breaking), and coke formation.

[1] The dehydrogenation of light alkanes is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited, resulting in low conversion and selectivity in the absence of catalysts.
           [2] Ga-CHA samples with several Ga/Al ratios (0–1.7) and Si/Al ratios (5, 12, and 25) have been prepared to investigate Ga speciation and the corresponding impact on PDH rates.
           [3] Apparent activation energies (Eapp) for the PDH reaction on the reduced catalyst are estimated using an Arrhenius plot in the temperature range of 530–570 °C. On H-CHA(x), the (Eapp) values of the C3H8 dehydrogenation and cracking reactions were 180-200 kJ/mol (Table 2) and 159-174 kJ/mol, respectively.

[1] PDH can be broadly grouped into two categories: non-oxidative and oxidative. In non-oxidative PDH, propane is catalytically dehydrogenated to produce stoichiometric amounts of propylene and hydrogen. It is endothermic (ΔH298Kθ = 124.3 kJ mol−1) and a volume-increasing reaction (C3H8 → C3H6 + H2), and thus is favored at high temperature and low pressure.

      [2] Oxidants, usually O2, can be co-fed with propane to enhance the thermodynamic driving force in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process. This process is exothermic (ΔH298Kθ = 117 kJ mol−1) and thus the conversion of propane is no longer limited by thermodynamics.

      [3] CO2-assisted ODHP (CO2-ODHP, C3H8 + CO2 → C3H6 + CO + H2O) could, in theory, improve the thermodynamics of PDH. CO2 has two advantages: i) consumes H2 through the reverse water-gas-shift reaction (RWGS: CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) increasing the equilibrium conversion of propane; ii) CO2 can remove coke via the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C → 2CO).

[1] PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C. The reaction is limited by thermodynamics, and the yields of propene can be increased by lowering propane partial pressure or raising temperature.

Propane dehydrogenation is thermodynamically limited due to being highly endothermic. The reaction equilibrium limits conversion, so high temperatures (>500°C) are required, but this also causes coking as a side reaction. Kinetic factors like C-H bond activation barriers control rates.

[1] "Developing alternative routes of propylene production is therefore of great interest."  
         [2] "However, a complete understanding of the reactions, including coke formation and deactivation, at an elementary step level is lacking."
         [3] "It reveals that the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms on steps and corners have high activity toward cracking."

However, this equilibriumlimited endothermic reaction requires elevated temperatures of 500–600 °C to achieve sufficient conversion levels
