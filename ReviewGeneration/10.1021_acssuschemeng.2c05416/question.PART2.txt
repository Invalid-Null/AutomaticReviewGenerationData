Catalysis and Biomass: A Virtual Special Issue in Honor of Dr. James A. Dumesic
This virtual special issue (VSI), Designing Catalysts for Sustainability: A Special Issue in Honor of James A. Dumesic, brings together contributions from alumni, former postdocs, collaborators, and colleagues to celebrate 45 years of the career of Dr. James A. Dumesic, Steenbock Chair in the College of Engineering and the Michel Boudart Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at The University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Prof. Dumesic has advised 70 Ph.D. students and received numerous awards in his career. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering (1998), American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2009), National Academy of Inventors (2013), and National Academy of Sciences (2014). He has received the following awards: Somorjai Award for Creative Research in Catalysis from the American Chemical Society (2006), Burwell National Lectureship by the North American Catalysis Society (2007), Hilldale Award at the University of Wisconsin (2008), inaugural Heinz Heinemann Award by the International Association of Catalysis Societies (2008), William H. Walker Award of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (2009), Michel Boudart Award for the Advancement of Catalysis (2011), and George A. Olah Award in Hydrocarbon or Petroleum Chemistry from the American Chemical Society (2012).
Recently, Jim Dumesics contribution to heterogeneous catalysis was thoroughly reviewed in ACS Catalysis. (1) Dumesic has been recognized as a pioneer and one of the most inspirational researchers in the field of sustainable chemistry and engineering, particularly in applying heterogeneous catalysts to biomass conversion. For instance, his group developed methods for the aqueous-phase reforming of biomass-derived molecules for the selective production of hydrogen or the direct production of liquid hydrocarbons. (211) More recently, he studied the use of furan compounds, levulinic acid, and gamma-valerolactone (GVL) as biomass-derived platform chemicals for the production of fuels and chemicals. (1219) Dumesic built up a biomass conversion roadmap using heterogeneous catalysis starting from the solid raw biomass, which was only possible due to the use of GVL, a biomass-derived solvent. (14,2029) Besides the outstanding contribution to biomass conversion, the Dumesic group crossed boundaries and produced influential contributions in fields like nitric oxide reduction by ammonia, (30,31) fuel cells, (32) advanced catalyst synthesis, (3337) watergas shift reaction, and microkinetic modeling.

In this VSI, the authors honored Jim Dumesics career by submitting contributions in fields related to his work. For instance, Shanks and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c02399) showed that it is possible to tailor the activity of Pd catalysts toward dehydrogenation or hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) by the addition of a cometal (Li or Fe), providing a model system to study the influence of bimetallic catalysts on reaction selectivity on carbon supports. Podkolzin and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c00179 provided kinetic and mechanistic insights on the HDO of acetic acid catalyzed by Pt and PtMo. Interestingly, it has been shown that the presence of Mo allows a reduction in the energy for CO bond breaking, turning the catalyst more active. Pagan-Torres and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c06877) also showed a significant effect on the addition of MoOx on Pd/TiO2 catalysts for the HDO of biomass-derived polyols. The outstanding catalytic results observed are due to the ability of TiO2 support in mediating the hydrogen spillover between Pd and MoOx centers. Subramanian and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c07071) revealed that supporting Pt on Zr-, Nb-, or W-incorporated KIT-6 leads to a catalytic material with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability in the HDO of guaiacol, a model molecule for bio-oil. HDO of guaiacol with a 1 wt % Pt/Nb-KIT-6 gave 90% conversion and 75% selectivity to deoxygenated species as a result of the acidic nature of the support.
Regarding the conversion of lignocellulose biomass-derived molecules, Wettstein and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c05413) developed an artificial neural network model that predicted optimal xylose conversion and furfural yields from autocatalytic reactions achieved with polarities above 15 at severities greater than 4.33. This result can guide the future development of solvent systems for biomass conversion. Huber and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c04759) studied the conversion of levoglucosanol, a molecule obtained from cellulose mild pyrolysis, over PtWOx/TiO2, to hexane-1,2,5,6-tetrol (tetrol). Tetrol is a new biomass-based monomer that has several potential applications. A high tetrol selectivity (above 90%) was obtained thanks to a detailed understanding of the reaction kinetics. Jones and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c04463) synthesized trifluoroacetic acid-modulated UiO-66 with various linkers, which were shown to be the first MOFs active for the Garcia Gonzalez reaction using several hexoses. The ability to modulate and tune UiO-66 properties can open new opportunities for the use of MOFs in biomass conversion. As for the upgrading of furans, Lusardi and Davis (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c06401) showed that zeolite Beta functionalized with phenethyl-sulfonic acid sites (PE-Beta) display higher TOFs for the hydroxyalkylation/alkylation reaction of 2-methylfuran with acetone compared to unmodified zeolite Beta and commercial catalysts. The outstanding catalytic activity of the PE-Betas arises from the combination of high acid site strength and hydrophobicity.
The conversion of alcohols is also explored in this VSI. For instance, Davis and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c07459) demonstrated that silica-supported Ag and ZrO2 can convert ethanol into butadiene with excellent yields. Ag catalyzes the dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, while ZrO2 promotes CC coupling and subsequent dehydration reactions. Tomishige and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c07023) converted biobased 1,2-propanediol into 2-propanol with a 23% yield using Ru-ReOx/SiO2. The authors propose that the structure of the catalytically active site is based on partially reduced Re species on the surface of Ru particles. Voutchkova-Kostal and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c05436) developed multifunctional catalysts to convert large biobased alcohols into drop-in hydrocarbon fuels. The authors reported that Pd supported hydrotalcite containing both acid and basic functionalities, which convert heptanol into hydrocarbons with a yield of 30%.
CO2 emission is a common problem associated with industrial processes. Although products obtained from biomass typically involve a lower carbon footprint compared to fossil-fuel feedstock, CO2 remains a problem. Simonetti and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c00458) have identified the optimum thermodynamic conditions and quantified the energy intensity and CO2 reduction potential of a process that sequesters CO2 as solid calcium carbonate through the use of geochemical and process-modeling software. The results obtained from their simulations provide an economical alternative for CO2 mineralization processes with potential for industrial implementation. Nrskov and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c07980) applied density functional theory (DFT) calculations to a systematic study evaluating the SMSI of 17 metal oxides with Cu (211) to identify potential promoters and supports for methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation. The authors discovered that only ZnO and Ga2O3 are reducible to cover partially the Cu(211) surface while maintaining Cu sites accessible for the activation of reactants.
Mavrikakis and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c06899) also used DFT calculation combined with experimental microkinetic modeling to understand the mechanism of ethylene production from 1,2-dichloroethane hydrodechlorination over Cu-rich PtCu alloys. The study proposes two sequential chlorine-removal steps on the PtCu alloy catalyst, which are distinct from those observed on pure Pt/SiO2 catalysts. Furthermore, it is also suggested that a possible formation of chlorine-induced Cu-enriched surface sites are more active than those present in the bulk Pt1Cu3(111) alloy surface. Miller and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c06579) also used Pt catalysts for propane conversion. They combined PtZn/SiO2 and ZSM-5 to convert propane with high yields to aromatics and low selectivity to methane. The results suggest that the light gas yield can be minimized by utilizing the PtZn alloy and lowering the monomolecular cracking rate by reducing the amount of ZSM-5. To achieve optimal product selectivity, the authors also showed that it is necessary to balance the propane dehydrogenation and olefin conversion rates by changing the ratio between PtZn to ZSM-5.
This VSI also has several contributions focused on the synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts. For instance, Datye and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c01380) created a more sustainable preparation methodology for catalysts containing metals with limited worldwide supplies, such as Pt and Ce. Using alumina as the support, the authors showed that crystalline ceria nanoparticles are efficient in trapping Pt atoms. As for CO oxidation, the Pt-containing catalyst with 50% of ceria/alumina displayed the highest activity, overcoming that of Pt/ceria. Luterbacher and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c07056) developed a liquid-phase atomic layer deposition methodology for the synthesis of multiatom catalysts containing silicon, aluminum, zinc, and/or magnesium clusters. The versatility and modularity of this methodology could allow the design of a wide variety of catalysts for many reactions. Hermans and co-workers (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c07633) prepared a set of SnTi heterobimetallic dimers formed upon mixing of titanium(IV) alkoxides with tin(II) dicarboxylates or tin(IV) dialkyl dicarboxylates. The mixed catalysts showed superior stability in a Fischer esterification probe reaction and competitive activity for transesterification compared to pure Ti(OnBu)4 or stannous octoate.
We hope that the readers will be inspired by Jim Dumesics career and by this collection of outstanding contributions on heterogeneous catalysts and sustainable materials.
