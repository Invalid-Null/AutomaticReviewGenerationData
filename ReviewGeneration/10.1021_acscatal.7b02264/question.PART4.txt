Lattice-Confined Sn (IV/II) Stabilizing Raft-Like Pt Clusters: High Selectivity and Durability in Propane Dehydrogenation
Abstract
Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propene is highly endothermic, requiring a high reaction temperature. Under harsh conditions, it has been a great challenge to maintain excellent propene selectivity and suppress the irreversible deactivation caused by sintering of metallic active centers. This work reports a highly selective and durable PtSn catalyst for DHP, in which metallic Pt centers are dispersed homogeneously in small raft-like clusters on Mg(Sn)(Al)O and form strong interactions with the SnIV/II sites confined in Mg(Al)O lattices. A propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C with a conversion close to the equilibrium (specific rate of 0.96 s1 for propene formation) and a propene selectivity of >98% (specific rate of 1.46 s1) even under 600 C have been produced by highly dispersed Pt sites in Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O. The PtSn interactions and SnIV/II confinement were revealed to afford the catalyst with good durability. No visible sintering of Pt clusters was observed in the long-term DHP reaction.

KEYWORDS:stabilized Pt clusters lattice-confined SnIV/II propane dehydrogenation high selectivity excellent durability
Propene has consistenly been in short supply with the ever-increasing global demand as one of the most important raw materials and intermediates in the petrochemical industry. (1) Steam cracking of oil-based naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking (FFC) of heavy oil, the bulk of the propene production, suffer from high-energy demands and low selectivity toward propene. (2) Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is an on-purpose technique that exclusively yields propene instead of a mixture products. (3) In recent years, the DHP process with its high-profitability has been commercialized to meet the demand of propene. (4) The catalyst widely applied in the commercial DHP process is alumina-supported PtSn (5) (Oleflex process from UOP). The DHP reaction is highly endothermic, and a reaction temperature of >500 C is usually needed to achieve a feasible propane conversion. (6) Under such a high temperature, Pt sintering, propane hydrogenolysis (or cracking), and coke deposition become much more severe, leading to rapid irreversible deactivation and low propene selectivity, which are the major challenges for commercial DHP processes. (7)
Great efforts have been devoted to developing effective catalysts for tackling the challenges mentioned above. Several novel catalytic materials for the DHP process have been reported, (8) including metallic Sn/SiO2, (8a) Fe:P/Al2O3, (8b) ZrO2-based bulk oxides, (8c) In2O3Ga2O3, (8d) isolated FeII on silica, (8e) single-site Zn2+ on silica, (8f) and isolated Ga sites on silica. (8g) However, the efficient and selective production of propene requires well-defined catalytic sites. (9) Therefore, it is still of high interest to improve or modify mainstream Pt-based catalysts. (3a, 10) Promoter addition, affording bimetallic and/or alloying systems such as PtSn, (11) PtIn, (12) PtGa, (13) PtIr, (14) PtCu, (15) or even trimetallic Pt-SnIn, (16) has been found to be effective in improving propene selectivity and suppressing coke formation by increasing Pt dispersion (11, 12) or diluting Pt ensembles, (13, 14, 16) and changing the electronic environment of Pt atoms. (15) Modifications of support are alternative methods to enhance propene selectivity. (17) For instance, doping of Al2O3 with TiOx (17a) or Mg(Al)O oxide (17b) with ZnO weakens the Ptalkene interaction and thus suppresses the side reactions. Besides propene selectivity, the catalytic stability is an important issue that attracts much attention. (7c, 18) Markedly improved catalytic stability has been achieved with CeOx-doped PtGa/Al2O3 (7c) and Ca-doped PtSnIn/Al2O3, (18a) where CaO or CeOx species stabilize the catalyst by inhibiting Pt particle from sintering. In the case that Ga3+ species serve as the active sites for actual dehydrogenation while Pt acts as a unique promoter element, the catalyst remains stable for 12 days on stream after a conversion drop in first 2 days. (18b) With Zn2+ species as the active sites for dehydrogenation while Pt as a promoter, it remain stable over 20 h with 100% propylene selectivity at 550 C. (18c) Recently, great progress has been made with Pt-based catalysts. (19) Sn surface-enriched PtSn bimetallic nanoparticles exhibit a propene selectivity of >99% and a deactivation rate of 0.0028 h1 in 90 h at 580 C. (19a) The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet that contains a large amount of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions is exceptionally able of dispersing and stabilizing PtSn clusters. (19b) PtSn/Al2O3-nanosheet displays high specific activity for propylene formation with a selectivity of >99% and a low deactivation rate of 0.007 h1 in DHP at 590 C. (19b)
Here this work reports a highly selective and durable PtSn catalyst for DHP, in which Pt centers are dispersed homogeneously in small raft-like clusters on Mg(Sn)(Al)O and interact strong with the SnIV/II sites (SnIV/IIOM) confined in Mg(Al)O lattices. A propene selectivity of >98% (specific rate of 1.46 s1 for propene formation) and a deactivation rate of 0.0045 h1 have been afforded at 600 C. Blooming studies have focused on atomic-scale metallic catalysts in recent years. (20) Single Pt atoms anchored on FeOx support were prepared by a coprecipitation method. (20a) Atomically dispersed Pd on graphene was fabricated by the atomic layer deposition technique. (20b) Single iron sites were embedded in a silica matrix by melting method. (20c) While under high operating temperature, single atoms or small clusters tend to get sintered and/or aggregated, durable atomic-scale dispersion is a great challenge. (21) A sinter-resistant, atomically dispersed Pt was synthesized at high temperature via Pt trapped on CeO2/LaAl2O3. (21a) The encapsulation of Pt atoms or small clusters in highly siliceous chabazite showed enhanced stability toward sintering in a variety of industrial conditions. (21b) Stable single-atom silver supported on a hollandite manganese oxide was obtained by anti-Ostwald ripening. (21c) The highly and stably dispersed Pt on Mg(Sn)(Al)O reported here in this work was produced from the reduction-followed calcination of Pt2+ loaded Sn-containing layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which was developed (22) by our group.
Mg-, Al-, and Sn-containing LDHs was synthesized in situ on the surface of γ-Al2O3, affording MgSnAl-LDHs@Al2O3 with a Mg/Sn molar ratio of 12. MgAl-LDH@Al2O3 was also synthesized as control. The reflections characteristic of hydrotalcite structure (23) are clearly observed for either MgSnAl-LDHs@Al2O3 or MgAl-LDH@Al2O3 in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure S1). In our previous work, (22) it has been demonstrated that SnIV sites in MgSnAl-LDHs are atomically dispered and confined by the lattice of LDHs. From the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (Figure S2), MgSnAl-LDHs is observed to grow densely on both exterior and interior surfaces of γ-Al2O3 with a thickness of approximately 0.36 μm. The thickness of MgSnAl-LDHs layer can be increased to 0.50 μm by prolonging the crystallization time (Figure S3). Pt2+ was introduced onto MgSnAl-LDHs@Al2O3 by incipient wetness impregnation. After calcination in air followed with reduction in H2 at 600 C, 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 (Pt/Sn molar ratio of 0.6) was produced. According to the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopic (HAADF-STEM) images (Figure 1a) with size distribution as inset, Pt clusters (d = 1.1  0.3 nm) are homogeneously distributed on the support surface. No large Pt nanoparticles are observed. By comparing the brightness intensity of Pt cluster with that of single atom (Figure S4), the Pt clusters are confirmed to be in two-dimensional (2D) raft-like dispersion with a thickness of no more than two atomic layers. This observation is similar to that with PtSn/Al2O3-nanosheet, (19b) or Pt/FeOx, (24) hinting a strong interaction between the support surface and Pt. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) element mapping images (Figure 1a) offer clear evidence for no large aggregation of both Pt and Sn elements. With Pt loading increased to 1 wt % (Pt/Sn = 1.2) or 2 wt % (Pt/Sn = 2.4), Pt nanoparticles get dominated (Figure S5). The particle-size distribution for 1.0 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 and 2.0 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 show a maximum at d = 1.9  0.5 nm and d = 2.6  0.7 nm. For comparison, control samples were also prepared by impregnating Sn4+-impregnated (Mg/Sn = 12) or as-prepared MgAl-LDH/Al2O3 with Pt2+ aqueous solution. 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 and 0.46 wt % Pt/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 were produced by calcination in air followed with reduction in H2 at 600 C. Similar to the observation on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3, raft-like Pt clusters are observed (Figure S6), with a maximum at d = 1.2  0.4 nm for 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 and d = 1.2  0.3 nm for 0.46 wt % Pt/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3. The textural properties of the above samples are presented in Table S1.

In the quasi-in situ 119Sn Mssbauer spectra (Figure 2A), 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 presents two doublet bands at isomer shift (IS) of 0.24 mm s1 and 2.92 mm s1 with quadrupole splitting (QS) of 0.92 mm s1 and 2.34 mm s1 (Table S2). For 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3, besides the doublet bands located at 0.05 mm s1 (with a QS of 0.51 mm s1) and 2.71 mm s1 (with a QS of 2.49 mm s1), another band at IS of 2.03 mm s1 is also observed (Figure 2A and Table S2). According to previous reports, (25) the doublet bands at the IS of 0.000.50 mm s1 and 2.503.50 mm s1 originate from SnIV and SnII species, while the single band at the IS around 2.00 mm s1 from Sn0. The SnIV species in SnO2 give QS of 0.5 mm s1 and SnII in SnO give QS of 1.2 mm s1, and the formation of SnIVOM or SnIIOM (M  Sn) causes an increase in QS. (26) The higher QS values for both SnIV and SnII (Figure 2A(a)) in Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 are consistent with the existence of SnIVOM or SnIIOM (M = Mg or Al here) linkages, which gives rise to asymmetric charge distribution of the SnO bonds. From the relative area, the SnIIOM species and SnIVOM species were estimated to account for 56% and 44%. The Sn species are all present in SnOM linkages (M = Mg or Al), confirming the definite confinement of Sn sites in the Mg(Al)O lattices. In Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3, the SnIV species presents a QS identical to SnO2 (Figure 2A(b)). However, the QS of SnII species is similar to that for SnIIOM linkage, which has been proposed (25b) to originate from the Sn-aluminates formed in the calcination/reduction. Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 was estimated to contain 73% of SnO2, 19% of SnIIOM linkage, and 8% of Sn0. In the Sn 3d5/2 XPS spectra (Figure S7), the content of SnIIOM and SnIVOM species was estimated to be 51% and 49%, in accordance with the 119Sn Mssbauer result (Figure 2A). By decreasing the reduction temperature to 550 C in the preparation process, SnIIOM content decreases to 32%. While increasing the reduction temperature to 650 C, the SnIIOM content only slightly increases (56%, Figure S7).

In the H2-TPR profiles (Figure 2B), the H2 consumption at 250300 C for the Pt-containing sample is assigned to the reduction of PtIV species. (16) The H2 consumption at 450600 C originates from the reduction of PtOx species strongly interacting with the support and/or the reduction of oxidized Sn species, (16, 25b, 27) and the ones at 700850 C are attributed to the loss of different types of hydroxyl groups on the Al2O3 (28) and/or Mg(Al)O. The presence of the SnIV component is clearly observed to increase the reduction temperature of PtIV sites, and the SnIV sites confined in the Mg(Al)O lattice increases the reduction temperature more visibly. The difficulty in Pt reduction is possibly result from the interactions between PtIV sites and SnIV species, and the confinement of SnIV sites further facilitates the PtIVSnIV interactions. In the quasi-in situ Pt LIII-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra (Figure S8), the white line intensity indicates that the electrons are donated from Sn component to Pt, and the Sn species confined in Mg(Sn)(Al)O lattice (0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3) donates more electrons than that in Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3.
Used as the catalyst for DHP reaction (Table S3), 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 affords a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C, with a conversion close to the equilibrium (initial conversion of 29%). Even under 600 C, a harsher condition, the propene selectivity remains >98% with the initial conversion increasing to 48%. The thickness of MgSnAl-LDHs layer on Al2O3 had no effect on the propane conversion and propene selectivity (Figure S9). At 550 C, the initial propane conversion on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 is similar to that on 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 while higher than that on 0.46 wt % Pt/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3. However, at 600 C, the initial propane conversion on 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 decreases to the level similar to that on 0.46 wt % Pt/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3, which is lower than that on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3. In the whole on-stream time (Figure 3), 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 affords higher propene selectivity than both 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/ Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 and 0.46 wt % Pt/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3. It is notable that the conversion on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 shows only a slight decrease in the first 9 h while with a sharp rise in the propene selectivity (Figure 3). The conversion decreases in only 0.0067% h1 at 550 C in 240 h on stream and 0.11% h1 at 600 C in 48 h. However, on 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 (Table S3), the propane conversion drops from initially 29% to 18% at 550 C in 240 h, and from 36% to 17% in 48 h at 600 C. The Sn-free 0.46 wt % Pt/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 displays a dramatic drop of propane conversion from 25% to 9% at 550 C in 240 h and from 38% to 13% in 48 h at 600 C. Usually, the specific activity, defined as the moles of propene formed per mol of Pt per second, (3a) is a comprehensive evaluation of catalytic performance. 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 displays a specific activity of 0.96 s1 at 550 C and 1.46 s1 at 600 C, higher than those for 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 (0.95 s1 and 1.01 s1) or 0.46 wt % Pt/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 (0.80 s1 and 0.92 s1), which is to say good yield at short contact time (Table S3). The specific activity on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 shows no any visible drop in the on-stream time at both 550 and 600 C. Deactivation rate (kd) and mean catalyst life (the reciprocal of kd, τ), based on a first-order deactivation mechanism, (29) are also introduced as proxies to evaluate the catalyst stability. 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 exhibits a kd value as low as 3.3 × 104 h1 (τ = 3062 h) in 240 h reaction at 550 C and 4.5 × 103 h1 (τ = 224 h) in 48 h reaction at 600 C. The mean catalyst life is almost 7-fold or 13-fold higher than that for 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 or 0.46 wt % Pt/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 at 550 C (almost 4-fold or 5-fold higher at 600 C), indicating an excellent durability of 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3. To further confirm the stability of 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3, the dehydrogenation/regeneration cycle tests at 600 C have been performed (Figure S10). In 10 cycles, only small changes in conversion are observed for 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3. However, 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 suffers from a severe deactivation, the conversion decreasing from 42% at first to 15% at 10th. In comparison with the commercial PtSn/Al2O3 reported in the literature (19b) (Table S4), 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 reported in this work possesses much higher specific activity and better durability. In comparison with those of the state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts (19) (Table S4), the catalyst life reported in this work is superior, and the specific activity is also attractive.

In the Sn 3d5/2 XPS spectra (Figure S11), no Sn0 is resolved for as-prepared 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3, while Sn0 is estimated to be present in 9% for as-prepared 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3, consistent with the observations by119Sn Mssbauer spectra (Figure 2A). After short contact with the reactant gases at either 500 or 600 C, no change is observed for the Sn 3d5/2 XPS spectra of 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3. However, the percentage of Sn0 in 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 increase to 27% after short contact at 600 C with the reactant gases. The Sn0 species in 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 might act as a poison for the catalytic conversion of propane, which is consistent with the observation in an earlier report (30) for supported-PtSn DHP catalysts. The stabilization of SnIV/II sites by the confinement in Mg(Al)O lattices account for the higher conversion on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 than on 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 at harsh condition.
DHP reaction was also carried out on 1.0 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 and 2.0 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 under the same conditions at 550 C as used for 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3. With Pt dispersion changing from raft-like cluster to nanoparticle, the propene selectivity decreases from 98% to 85% at a conversion of 29% (Figure S12). It is clear that highly dispersed Pt is one important factor to efficiently promote the selectivity to propene. This observation is not surprising because previous studies (22a, 31) also found that the hydrogenolysis highly depended on the size of the metal centers. Nevertheless, highly dispersed Pt could not account for the higher propene selectivity on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 than on 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O @Al2O3, which possess similar Pt dispersion. Therefore, in situ FT-IR spectra for propene adsorption were recorded (Figure 4A). Only easily evacuated physical adsorption has occurred on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3. On 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/ Mg(Al)O@Al2O3, however, the chemical adsorption with propene π-bonded to Pt is observed at 1609 cm1, and still present after evacuation. The weak adsorption and fast desorption of propene on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 is therefore responsible for the excellent propene selectivity. As revealed by XANES characterization, the SnIV/II sites confined in Mg(Al)O lattice donates more electrons to Pt. The electron-rich Pt sites disfavor the π-bonding of propene to Pt, thus improving the propene selectivity. In the operando FT-IR spectra recorded with 1% propane in Ar (Figure 4B), the absorption assigned to the ν (CC) of benzene ring skeleton at 1508 cm1 is obversed on 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 while not on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3. The emergence of aromatic ring indicates the possibility of coke formation. Thus, in situ thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under reaction conditions was performed at 550 C (Figure S13). The sample weight increases by 25% in 90 min DHP over 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 while only by 4% over 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3. The excellent coking-resistance of 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 coincides with the higher propene selectivity, which is supposed to result from the weak adsorption and fast desorption of propene observed in Figure 4A. In the DHP process at 550 C on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3, the propene selectivity was observed to increase (Figure S14) with the increasing SnIIOM content (Figure S7). The Sn (II) species seems to contribute more to propene selectivity.

(A) FT-IR spectra for 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 and 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 (a) with propene adsorbed at 233 K and (b) evacuated (a) until the absorption bands show no alteration in intensity in each case. The absorption bands at 1662 cm1, 1642 cm1, 1446  10 cm1, and 1376 cm1 are ascribed, according to previous reports, (32) to the ν (CC) of the gas-phase propene, ν (CC) of propene physisorbed, δas (CH) of methyl and δs (CH) of methyl group, and the absorption at 1609 cm1 is ascribed to the ν (CC) of propene π-bonded to Pt. (B) Operando FT-IR spectra recorded at intervals over 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 and 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 by introducing 1% propane in Ar at 400 C. The absorption bands at 3015 cm1, 29003000 cm1, 1605  10 cm1, 1508 cm1, and 1446  10 cm1 are ascribed to the ν (CH) of methane, ν (CH) of methyl and/or methene in adsorbed propane, ν (CC), ν (CC) from benzene ring skeleton, and δas (CH) of methyl group.
In the operando FT-IR spectra (Figure 4B), the absorption bands assigned to ν (CC) and δas (CH) in adsorbed propene are observed at 1613 and 1442 cm1 for 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3, and at 1601 and 1452 cm1 for 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3. The ν (CH) absorption of methane is observed at 3015 cm1 in each case, but the intensity of band at 3015 cm1 for 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 increases visibly with on-stream time, which suggests a gradual severe hydrogenolysis. As mentioned above, poor Pt dispersion might be one cause for hydrogenolysis, and thus, the Pt dispersion in spent 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 (Figure 1b) and 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 (Figure S15) are investigated by STEM technique.
No visible change in the dispersion and size of Pt clusters in 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 is observed before and after 240-h DHP reaction at 550 C, as well as no aggregation of both Pt and Sn elements in EDX element-mapping analysis (Figure 1b). This result indicates a superior antisintering ability for both of the Pt clusters and the lattice-confined SnIV/II sites in 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3. For 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O @Al2O3, large Pt nanoparticles (>10 nm) are observed after 240-h DHP reaction at 550 C, indicative of severe sintering of Pt (Figure S15). Besides Pt (111) lattice, Pt1Sn1 (102) and Pt1Sn1 (211) lattices are also observed over the spent 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3, meaning that the Sn sites, simply supported on the surface of Mg(Al)O@Al2O3, have aggregated together with Pt sites to form PtSn alloy rather than stabilized the Pt clusters.
As reported by the previous literature, (17b) the surface property of the support could affect the catalytic performance. Therefore, in this work, the role of the surface of γ-Al2O3 has been investigated. 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O (without Al2O3) and 0.50 wt % Pt/SnOx@Al2O3 (without LDHs) were prepared. The surface area of 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O (without Al2O3) is measured to be 194.6 m2/g (Table S1), similar to that of 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 (195.4 m2/g); however, in the 6-h propane dehydrogenation reaction at 600 C, 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O (without Al2O3) only exhibits an initial propane conversion of 8%, much lower than that on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 (47%), with a similar propene selectivity (95%) (Figure S16). Without LDHs, 0.50 wt % Pt/SnOx@Al2O3 afforded an initial propane conversion of 46% and a propene selectivity of 94%, which is similar to that for Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3 (Figure S17). That means the surface of γ-Al2O3 has no effects on the catalytic performance. Thus, the γ-Al2O3 spherules here are supposed to only serve as a substrate for surface Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O. The much higher propane conversion on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 than that on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O is supposed to result from the better propane diffusion on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3, which benefits from the well-organized array of Mg(Sn)(Al)O species on γ-Al2O3 surface. Additionally, the catalysts with γ-Al2O3 spherules as the substrate are beneficial to apply in industry directly.
In conclusion, this work reports a supported PtSn catalyst, in which Pt atoms are dispersed in raft-like small clusters and interact strongly with the SnIV/II sites confined in Mg(Al)O lattices. In the DHP reaction, the PtSn catalyst developed in this work displayed a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C with a conversion close to the equilibrium (initial conversion of 29%); even under 600 C, a harsher condition, the propene selectivity remains >98% with the initial conversion increasing to 48%. More inspiringly, the confined SnIV/II sites facilitate the Pt clusters with good durability and stability through PtSn interactions. The specific activity on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 retains constant and no visible sintering of Pt clusters is observed in the long term DHP.
