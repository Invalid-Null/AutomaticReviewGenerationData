1. The article does not evaluate Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, or Ga2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on a Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 catalyst.

2. The article does not investigate tuning metal oxide properties for propane dehydrogenation. 

3. The article does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts.

4. The article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts.

5. The article does not evaluate supported mono-metallic Pt, Pd or Ir catalysts. 

6. The article does not investigate how properties like metal particle size and shape affect performance. It shows stabilizing SnIV/II sites in Mg(Al)O lattices helps disperse and stabilize Pt clusters.

7. The article does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts.

The given literature focuses on the development of a Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It does not evaluate other metal or metal oxide catalysts. The key points are:

- The catalyst uses raft-like Pt clusters strongly interacting with SnIV/II sites confined in Mg(Al)O lattices. This stabilizes the Pt clusters.

- The catalyst shows high propene selectivity (>98%) and excellent durability in propane dehydrogenation, with no visible Pt cluster sintering. 

- Stabilizing SnIV/II sites in Mg(Al)O lattices facilitates Pt-Sn interactions, which helps disperse and stabilize Pt clusters.

- The literature does not propose mechanistic pathways or explore interfacial effects. It focuses on the development and performance evaluation of the Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 catalyst.

In summary, the questions ask about topics not addressed in the given literature excerpt, which focuses specifically on the Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 catalyst system.
