[1] "Pt2+ was introduced onto MgSnAl-LDHs@Al2O3 by incipient wetness impregnation. After calcination in air followed with reduction in H2 at 600 C, 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 (Pt/Sn molar ratio of 0.6) was produced."

[2] "According to the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopic (HAADF-STEM) images (Figure 1a) with size distribution as inset, Pt clusters (d = 1.1 ± 0.3 nm) are homogeneously distributed on the support surface." 

[3] "By comparing the brightness intensity of Pt cluster with that of single atom (Figure S4), the Pt clusters are confirmed to be in two-dimensional (2D) raft-like dispersion with a thickness of no more than two atomic layers."

24. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using incipient wetness impregnation of Pt2+ onto MgSnAl-LDHs@Al2O3, followed by calcination and reduction to produce homogeneously distributed, raft-like Pt clusters with sizes around 1.1 nm and no more than 2 atomic layers thick. This is analyzed using HAADF-STEM imaging.

[1] "In the quasi-in situ 119Sn Mssbauer spectra (Figure 2A), 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 presents two doublet bands at isomer shift (IS) of 0.24 mm s-1 and 2.92 mm s-1 with quadrupole splitting (QS) of 0.92 mm s-1 and 2.34 mm s-1 (Table S2)."

[2] "In the quasi-in situ Pt LIII-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra (Figure S8), the white line intensity indicates that the electrons are donated from Sn component to Pt, and the Sn species confined in Mg(Sn)(Al)O lattice (0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3) donates more electrons than that in Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3."

[3] "DHP reaction was carried out on 1.0 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 and 2.0 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 under the same conditions at 550 C as used for 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3. With Pt dispersion changing from raft-like cluster to nanoparticle, the propene selectivity decreases from 98% to 85% at a conversion of 29% (Figure S12)."

25. Yes, the article utilizes quasi in-situ 119Sn Mössbauer spectroscopy and XANES to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It reveals that Sn species confined in the Mg(Sn)(Al)O lattice donate more electrons to Pt compared to SnOx/Mg(Al)O, and that increasing Pt dispersion from nanoparticles to raft-like clusters improves propene selectivity from 85% to 98% at similar conversion.

[1] "According to the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopic (HAADF-STEM) images (Figure 1a) with size distribution as inset, Pt clusters (d = 1.1 ± 0.3 nm) areogeneously distributed on the support surface. No large Pt nanoparticles are observed."

[2] "The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) element mapping images (Figure 1a) offer clear evidence for no large aggregation of both Pt and Sn elements." 

[3] "Figure 1. HAADF-STEM images with EDX element-mapping analysis of (a) fresh and (b) spent 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3. In EDX element-mapping images, green dots represent the Pt element while red ones represent the Sn element."

26. Yes, the article employs HAADF-STEM imaging coupled with EDX elemental mapping to characterize the metal-support interface in the propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows homogeneously distributed 1.1 nm Pt clusters and no aggregation of Pt or Sn for the fresh and spent 0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 catalyst.
