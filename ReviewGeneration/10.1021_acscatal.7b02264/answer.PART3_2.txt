[1] Highly dispersed Pt on Mg(Sn)(Al)O reported here in this work was produced from the reduction-followed calcination of Pt2+ loaded Sn-containing layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which was developed by our group.

[2] The reflections characteristic of hydrotalcite structure (23) are clearly observed for either MgSnAl-LDHs@Al2O3 or MgAl-LDH@Al2O3 in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, meaning that Sn sites are confined in the lattice of LDHs. 

[3] According to the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopic (HAADF-STEM) images with size distribution as inset, Pt clusters (d = 1. ± 0.3 nm) are homogeneously distributed on the support surface.

24. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using layered double hydroxides (LDHs) to confine Sn sites in the lattice, which helps disperse Pt clusters homogeneously on the support surface with size around 1.1 nm.

[1] In the quasi-in situ 119Sn Mssbauer spectra, 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 presents two doublet bands at isomer shift (IS) of 0.24 mm s−1 and 2.92 mm s−1 with quadrupole splitting (QS) of 0.92 mm s−1 and 2.34 mm s−1, indicating the existence of SnIVOM or SnIIOM (M = Mg or Al here) linkages.

[2] In the quasi-in situ Pt LIII-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra, the white line intensity indicates that the electrons are donated from Sn component to Pt, and the Sn species confined in Mg(Sn)(Al)O lattice (0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3) donates more electrons than that in Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3.

[3] In situ FT-IR spectra for propene adsorption were recorded. Only easily evacuated physical adsorption has occurred on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3. On 0.48 wt % Pt/SnOx/Mg(Al)O@Al2O3, the chemical adsorption with propene π-bonded to Pt is observed, indicating weak adsorption and fast desorption of propene on 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3.

[1] According to the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopic (HAADF-STEM) images with size distribution as inset, Pt clusters (d = 1.1 ± 0.3 nm) are homogeneously distributed on the support surface. 

[2] In HAADF-STEM images with EDX element-mapping analysis of spent 0.50 wt% Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3, no visible change in the dispersion and size of Pt clusters is observed after 240-h DHP reaction at 550°C, as well as no aggregation of both Pt and Sn elements.
