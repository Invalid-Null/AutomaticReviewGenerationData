<quotes>

[1] "This work reports a highly selective and durable PtSn catalyst for DHP, in which Pt centers are dispersed homogeneously in small raft-like clusters on Mg(Sn)(Al)O and interact strong with the SnIV/II sites (SnIV/IIOM) confined in Mg(Al)O lattices."

[2] "Used as the catalyst for DHP reaction (Table S3), 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 affords a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C, with a conversion close to the equilibrium (initial conversion of 29%)."

[3] "Even under 600 C, a harsher condition, the propene selectivity remains >98% with the initial conversion increasing to 48%."

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates a supported mono-metallic PtSn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It reports a highly selective and durable PtSn/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 catalyst, where Pt clusters interact strongly with SnIV/II sites confined in the support. This catalyst achieved >99% propylene selectivity at 550C with 29% conversion close to equilibrium, and >98% selectivity at 600C with 48% initial conversion.

答案:是的,该文献评估了一种负载的单金属PtSn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它报道了一种高选择性和持久稳定的PtSn/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3催化剂,Pt簇与载体内受限制的SnIV/II位点存在强相互作用。该催化剂在550°C下获得了29%的转化率(接近平衡状态)和大于99%的丙烯选择��,在600°C下获得了48%的初始转化率和大于98%的选��性。

[1] "In this work, the highly and stably dispersed Pt on Mg(Sn)(Al)O reported here in this work was produced from the reduction-followed calcination of Pt2+ loaded Sn-containing layered double hydroxides (LDHs),"

[2] "Pt atoms are dispersed in raft-like small clusters and interact strongly with the SnIV/II sites (SnIV/IIOM) confined in Mg(Al)O lattices."

[3] "No visible change in the dispersion and size of Pt clusters in 0.50 wt % Pt/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 is observed before and after 240-h DHP reaction at 550 C, as well as no aggregation of both Pt and Sn elements in EDX element-mapping analysis (Figure 1b)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like Pt particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows the highly dispersed and stable raft-like Pt clusters result from strong metal-support interactions with confined SnIV/II sites. No changes in Pt cluster size or aggregation with Sn occurred after 240h reaction, indicating excellent stability.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

答案:是的,该文献研究了Pt颗粒大小、形状和与载体间相互作用等性质如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它显示高度分散的稳定的筏状Pt簇源自与受限SnIV/II位点的强金属-载体间相互作用。在240小时反应后,Pt簇的大小和与Sn的聚集都没有改变,表示了优异的稳定性。
