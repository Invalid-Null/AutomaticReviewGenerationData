23. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides the specific example of encapsulating cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers on a silicalite-1 zeolite support (CoOx@NC/S-1). Data shows this catalyst maintained 40% propane conversion and 97% propene selectivity after 10 hours time-on-stream at 600°C.

[1] "To verify the impact of zinc dopant content in bimetallic ZnCo-ZIF precursors on the size and dispersion of CoOx species, TEM and EDX elemental mapping images were tested."

[2] "When the mole ratio of Zn and Co increases to 4, no particles can be seen in Fig. 2g and h. The corresponding EDX spectrum shows that the Co species are highly dispersed in the NC layer with the nanoscale."

24. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses the specific techniques of using zinc as a secondary metal dopant in bimetallic ZnCo-ZIF precursors, and tuning the Zn/Co ratio, to control the isolation and dispersion of cobalt species. TEM and EDX data in Fig. 2 shows that increasing the Zn/Co ratio to 4 yielded highly dispersed cobalt species in the nanoscale range.

[1] "The XPS spectrum of N 1 s shows that the main nitrogen species after pyrolysis are graphitic-N and pyridinic-N (Fig. S7), which are anchor points for Co species [29], [46], [47]."

[2] "In order to further elucidate the changes in the structure of CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts during PDH, the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts after 2 h time on stream were also examined using XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 5b, the binding energy of the Co 2p3/2 core level of all the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts shift to higher energy (782 eV) than that of fresh CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts (780 eV), which signifies a transition of the original Co3+ states to lower reduction states during the PDH process [48]."
