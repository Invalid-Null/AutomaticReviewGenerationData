[1] The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C.  

[2] After 40 h time on stream, the propane conversion decreases from 41.3% to 21.6%, which may be due to the aggregation of CoO sites at such a high temperature [11], [12], [17], [18].

Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It shows encapsulating cobalt oxide sites in nitrogen-doped carbon layers on a silicalite-1 zeolite support helps prevent aggregation and maintain stability during propane dehydrogenation at high temperature over 40 hours.

[1] Tuning the molar ratio of Zn/Co in the ZIFs, Co species can be spatially separated to a varied isolation degree during pyrolysis, with the lowest degree of isolation for nanoparticles (Zn/Co = 0), a moderate value for small particles (Zn/Co = 2), and the highest isolation degree for isolated metal sites (Zn/Co = 4).  

[2] The unique structure of the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst is expected to show good catalytic performance, and is beneficial to explore the active sites and reaction mechanism for propane dehydrogenation.

[3] These results collectively prove that the Zn species act as a fence and increase the distance between the adjacent Co atoms in space, thus realizing the spatial isolation of cobalt oxide species with nanoscale.

Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods to optimize active phase dispersion. It tunes the Zn/Co ratio in bimetallic zeolitic imidazole frameworks to control the isolation degree of Co species during pyrolysis. A higher Zn/Co ratio leads to better spatial isolation of Co atoms, giving isolated Co oxide sites.

[1] In order to further elucidate the changes in the structure of CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts during PDH, the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts after 2 h time on stream were also examined using XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 5b, the binding energy of the Co 2p3/2 core level of all the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts shift to higher energy (782 eV) than that of fresh CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts (780 eV), which signifies a transition of the original Co3+ states to lower reduction states during the PDH process [48].

[2] Combining the results of the catalytic performances of fresh CoOx@NC/S-1 and ReCoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts, H2-TPR and XPS spectra of Co-based catalysts, the reaction route for PDH in CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts are illustrated in Scheme 2.
