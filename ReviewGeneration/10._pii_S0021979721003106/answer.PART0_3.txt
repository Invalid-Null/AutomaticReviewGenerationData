[1] "The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]."

[2] "Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]."  

[3] "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective to tackle this challenge, and a variety of strategies for site isolation have been developed [20], [21], [22]."

[4] "Recently, confining the isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials has been widely utilized to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis [25], [26], [27], [28]."

2. Yes, the article explains how catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers. It states that cobalt-based catalysts have shown promise for propane dehydrogenation due to the earth abundance of cobalt. The active site isolation strategy has also been effective, by confining isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials to enhance stability.
