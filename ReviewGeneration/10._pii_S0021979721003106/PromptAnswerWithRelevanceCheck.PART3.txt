[3] Fig. 7b exhibits the FTIR spectra of propene recorded on the CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst after adsorption of propene at 30 C (spectrum I), reaction at 300 C under H2/Ar for 30 min (spectrum II) and subsequent evacuation at 30 C (spectrum III).

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It performs experiments with propane and propene adsorption and reaction over the CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst at different temperatures, measuring changes in the IR spectra. This provides insights into reaction intermediates and allows the authors to propose a reaction mechanism.

[1] In order to further elucidate the changes in the structure of CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts during PDH, the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts after 2 h time on stream were also examined using XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 5b, the binding energy of the Co 2p3/2 core level of all the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts shift to higher energy (782 eV) than that of fresh CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts (780 eV), which signifies a transition of the original Co3+ states to lower reduction states during the PDH process [48]. 

[2] Combining the results of the catalytic performances of fresh CoOx@NC/S-1 and ReCoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts, H2-TPR and XPS spectra of Co-based catalysts, the reaction route for PDH in CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts are illustrated in Scheme 2.

Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It examines fresh and spent catalysts, showing a shift to lower Co oxidation states after reaction. By combining XPS data with other techniques like H2-TPR, it elucidates the reaction route and active sites involved in propane dehydrogenation over the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts.
