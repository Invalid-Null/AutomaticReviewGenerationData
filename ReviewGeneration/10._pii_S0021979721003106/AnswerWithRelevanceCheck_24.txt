[1] "To verify the impact of zinc dopant content in bimetallic ZnCo-ZIF precursors on the size and dispersion of CoOx species, TEM and EDX elemental mapping images were tested." 

[2] "When the mole ratio of Zn and Co increases to 4, no particles can be seen in Fig. 2g and h. The corresponding EDX spectrum shows that the Co species are highly dispersed in the NC layer with the nanoscale."

[1] "In order to further elucidate the changes in the structure of CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts during PDH, the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts after 2 h time on stream were also examined using XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 5b, the binding energy of the Co 2p3/2 core level of all the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts shift to higher energy (782 eV) than that of fresh CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts (780 eV), which signifies a transition of the original Co3+ states to lower reduction states during the PDH process [48]."
