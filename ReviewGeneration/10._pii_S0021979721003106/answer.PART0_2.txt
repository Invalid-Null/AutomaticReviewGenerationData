 Unfortunately this literature does not contain enough relevant information to directly answer the questions asked. The article focuses on developing a new cobalt oxide catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and does not provide significant background or review of the broader field. It lacks details on the importance of propylene, thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction, computational studies, microkinetic modeling, or quantitative structure-activity relationships. The quotes extracted contain only general statements related to the catalyst synthesis and testing. Since there is insufficient content in the given literature to comprehensively address the questions, I cannot provide complete answers beyond what is directly stated in the quoted passages. Please provide additional review articles or resources that can give more context and details on propane dehydrogenation if you would like me to analyze and summarize that content to address the questions.
