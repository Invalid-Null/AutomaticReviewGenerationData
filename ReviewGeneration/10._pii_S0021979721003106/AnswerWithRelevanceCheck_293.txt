         "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."
         "ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 sample was prepared by introducing the metal precursor onto the silicalite-1 using the wet impregnation method."
         "The intentional addition of Zn2+ can occupy the position of Co2+ and serve as a fence to further expand the adjacent distances of Co atoms." 
         "When the mole ratio of Zn and Co increases to 4, no particles can be seen in Fig. 2g and h. The corresponding EDX spectrum shows that the Co species are highly dispersed in the NC layer with the nanoscale."
         "These results collectively prove that the Zn species act as a fence and increase the distance between the adjacent Co atoms in space, thus realizing the spatial isolation of cobalt oxide species with nanoscale."

         Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single cobalt oxide sites in silicalite-1 zeolite supports. The specific methods discussed include: 1) Synthesizing bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1, then pyrolyzing under N2 to form nitrogen-doped carbon layers with cobalt species. 2) Intentionally adding Zn2+ which can act as a "fence" to increase the distance between adjacent Co atoms and achieve spatial isolation of cobalt oxide species.

         "[1] The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C." 
         "[1] After 40 h time on stream, the propane conversion decreases from 41.3% to 21.6%, which may be due to the aggregation of CoO sites at such a high temperature [11], [12], [17], [18]."

         "[1] In order to further elucidate the changes in the structure of CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts during PDH, the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts after 2 h time on stream were also examined using XPS spectra.
