      [1] Subsequently, the secondary metals are selectively removed in situ, and isolated metal sites confined in N-doped carbon materials can be synthesized during the pyrolysis process [33], [34], [35], [36].

      [2] After 40 h time on stream, the propane conversion decreases from 41.3% to 21.6%, which may be due to the aggregation of CoO sites at such a high temperature [11], [12], [17], [18].

      Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It shows that encapsulating cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers on a silicalite-1 zeolite support helps prevent aggregation and maintain stability during propane dehydrogenation at high temperature over 40 hours on stream.

      [1] Tuning the molar ratio of Zn/Co in the ZIFs, Co species can be spatially separated to a varied isolation degree during pyrolysis, with the lowest degree of isolation for nanoparticles (Zn/Co = 0), a moderate value for small particles (Zn/Co = 2), and the highest isolation degree for isolated metal sites (Zn/Co = 4). 

      [2] The unique structure of the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst is expected to show good catalytic performance, and is beneficial to explore the active sites and reaction mechanism for propane dehydrogenation.

      [3] These results collectively prove that the Zn species act as a fence and increase the distance between the adjacent Co atoms in space, thus realizing the spatial isolation of cobalt oxide species with nanoscale.

      Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It tunes the Zn/Co ratio in bimetallic zeolitic imidazole frameworks to control the isolation degree of Co species during pyrolysis. A higher Zn/Co ratio leads to better spatial isolation of Co atoms, resulting in isolated Co oxide sites rather than nanoparticles or clusters. This optimized dispersion is expected to enhance catalytic performance.

      是的,文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它调节双金属咪唑框架材料中的Zn/Co比率来控制Co物种在裂解过程中的隔离度。更高的Zn/Co比率导致Co原子的空间隔离效果更好,形成隔离的Co氧化物位点,而不是纳米粒子或簇。这种优化的分散有望提高催化性能。

      [1] In situ Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were conducted using KBr for the background spectrum on a BRUKER TENSOR II. Two main experiments were carried out with propane and propene as raw materials.

      [2] Fig. 7a exhibits the FTIR spectra of propane recorded on the CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst after adsorption of propane at 30 C (spectrum I), reaction at 300 C for 60 min (spectrum II) and subsequent evacuation at 30 C (spectrum III).

      [3] Fig. 7b exhibits the FTIR spectra of propene recorded on the CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst after adsorption of propene at 30 C (spectrum I), reaction at 300 C under H2/Ar for 30 min (spectrum II) and subsequent evacuation at 30 C (spectrum III).

      [1] In order to further elucidate the changes in the structure of CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts during PDH, the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts after 2 h time on stream were also examined using XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 5b, the binding energy of the Co 2p3/2 core level of all the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts shift to higher energy (782 eV) than that of fresh CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts (780 eV), which signifies a transition of the original Co3+ states to lower reduction states during the PDH process [48].

      [2] Combining the results of the catalytic performances of fresh CoOx@NC/S-1 and ReCoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts, H2-TPR and XPS spectra of Co-based catalysts, the reaction route for PDH in CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts are illustrated in Scheme 2.
