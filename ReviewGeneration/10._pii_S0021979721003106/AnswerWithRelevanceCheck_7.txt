         [1] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."

         [2] "ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 sample was prepared by introducing the metal precursor onto the silicalite-1 using the wet impregnation method."  
         
         [3] "The intentional addition of Zn2+ can occupy the position of Co2+ and serve as a fence to further expand the adjacent distances of Co atoms." 

         [4] "When the mole ratio of Zn and Co increases to 4, no particles can be seen in Fig. 2g and h. The corresponding EDX spectrum shows that the Co species are highly dispersed in the NC layer with the nanoscale."
         
         [5] "These results collectively prove that the Zn species act as a fence and increase the distance between the adjacent Co atoms in space, thus realizing the spatial isolation of cobalt oxide species with nanoscale."

         Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single cobalt oxide sites in zeolitic silicalite-1 supports. The methods include: 1) Synthesizing ZnCo-ZIF on silicalite-1, pyrolyzing under N2 to form N-doped carbon layers with Co species; 2) Adding Zn2+ to act as "fence" between Co atoms for spatial isolation; 3) Increasing Zn/Co ratio to 4 yielded highly dispersed isolated Co oxide species at the nanoscale in carbon layers.
