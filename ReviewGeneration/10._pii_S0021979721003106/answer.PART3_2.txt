1. "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."

2. "ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 sample was prepared by introducing the metal precursor onto the silicalite-1 using the wet impregnation method." 

3. "The intentional addition of Zn2+ can occupy the position of Co2+ and serve as a fence to further expand the adjacent distances of Co atoms."

4. "When the mole ratio of Zn and Co increases to 4, no particles can be seen in Fig. 2g and h. The corresponding EDX spectrum shows that the Co species are highly dispersed in the NC layer with the nanoscale."

5. "These results collectively prove that the Zn species act as a fence and increase the distance between the adjacent Co atoms in space, thus realizing the spatial isolation of cobalt oxide species with nanoscale."

22. Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single cobalt oxide sites in silicalite-1 zeolite supports. The specific methods discussed include:

1. Synthesizing bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1, then pyrolyzing under N2 to form nitrogen-doped carbon layers with cobalt species. 

2. Intentionally adding Zn2+ which can act as a "fence" to increase the distance between adjacent Co atoms and achieve spatial isolation of cobalt oxide species.

23. Yes, the article evaluates encapsulating cobalt oxide species in nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite to enhance catalyst stability for propane dehydrogenation. Data shows the CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst maintains 40% propane conversion after 10 hours time-on-stream at 600°C.

24. Yes, the article investigates controlling the Zn/Co ratio in bimetallic zeolitic imidazole precursors to optimize active phase dispersion. Increasing Zn/Co ratio to 4 resulted in highly dispersed cobalt oxide species isolated at the nanoscale within nitrogen-doped carbon layers.

25. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ FT-IR spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Data reveals an intermediate cobalt propyl species forms during both propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation reactions over CoOx@NC/S-1(4).

26. No, the article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces.

27. Yes, the article uses XPS to probe oxidation state changes of cobalt species during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Data shows isolated CoO sites in CoOx@NC/S-1(4) are stable during reaction while CoOx nanoclusters in other catalysts are reduced.

28. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.

22. 是的,该文描述了在硅沸石支撑体中合成隔离的单一钴氧化物位点的技术。讨论的具体方法包括:

1. 在硅沸石上合成双金属Zn/Co咪唑框架,然后在N2下热解形成含有钴种的氮掺杂碳层。 

2. 有意添加Zn2+,它可以起到“栅栏”的作用,增加相邻Co原子之间的距离,实现钴氧化物种的空间隔离。

23. 是的,该文评估了在硅沸石上的氮掺杂碳层中封装钴氧化物种,以提高丙烷脱氢反应的催化剂稳定性。数据显示CoOx@NC/S-1(4)催化剂在600°C下10小时反应后丙烷转化率可维持在40%。

24. 是的,该文研究控制双金属咪唑前体中的Zn/Co比,以优化活性相的分散度。 Zn/Co比增加到4会导致高度分散的钴氧化物种在氮掺杂碳层中被隔离至纳米尺度。
