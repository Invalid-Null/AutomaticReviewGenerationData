         "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."

         "ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 sample was prepared by introducing the metal precursor onto the silicalite-1 using the wet impregnation method."  

         "The intentional addition of Zn2+ can occupy the position of Co2+ and serve as a fence to further expand the adjacent distances of Co atoms."

         "When the mole ratio of Zn and Co increases to 4, no particles can be seen in Fig. 2g and h. The corresponding EDX spectrum shows that the Co species are highly dispersed in the NC layer with the nanoscale."

         "These results collectively prove that the Zn species act as a fence and increase the distance between the adjacent Co atoms in space, thus realizing the spatial isolation of cobalt oxide species with nanoscale."

         Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single cobalt oxide sites in silicalite-1 zeolite supports. The specific methods discussed include: 

1. Synthesizing bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1, then pyrolyzing under N2 to form nitrogen-doped carbon layers with cobalt species.

2. Intentionally adding Zn2+ which can act as a "fence" to increase the distance between adjacent Co atoms and achieve spatial isolation of cobalt oxide species.

         "[1] Subsequently, the secondary metals are selectively removed in situ, and isolated metal sites confined in N-doped carbon materials can be synthesized during the pyrolysis process [33], [34], [35], [36]. 

         [2] After 40 h time on stream, the propane conversion decreases from 41.3% to 21.6%, which may be due to the aggregation of CoO sites at such a high temperature [11], [12], [17], [18]."
         
         "[1] The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."

         Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It shows that encapsulating cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers on a silicalite-1 zeolite support helps prevent aggregation and maintain stability during propane dehydrogenation at high temperature over 40 hours on stream. It also provides the specific example of encapsulating cobalt in CoOx@NC/S-1, which maintained 40% propane conversion after 10 hours at 600°C.

        "Tuning the molar ratio of Zn/Co in the ZIFs, Co species can be spatially separated to a varied isolation degree during pyrolysis, with the lowest degree of isolation for nanoparticles (Zn/Co = 0), a moderate value for small particles (Zn/Co = 2), and the highest isolation degree for isolated metal sites (Zn/Co = 4)."

        "The unique structure of the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst is expected to show good catalytic performance, and is beneficial to explore the active sites and reaction mechanism for propane dehydrogenation."

        "These results collectively prove that the Zn species act as a fence and increase the distance between the adjacent Co atoms in space, thus realizing the spatial isolation of cobalt oxide species with nanoscale."
        
        "[1] To verify the impact of zinc dopant content in bimetallic ZnCo-ZIF precursors on the size and dispersion of CoOx species, TEM and EDX elemental mapping images were tested."

        Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It tunes the Zn/Co ratio in bimetallic zeolitic imidazole frameworks to control the isolation degree of Co species during pyrolysis. A higher Zn/Co ratio leads to better spatial isolation of Co atoms, resulting in isolated Co oxide sites rather than nanoparticles or clusters. This optimized dispersion is expected to enhance catalytic performance. TEM and EDX data confirms high dispersion from the preparation method when Zn/Co ratio is 4.

        是的,文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它调节双金属咪唑框架材料中的Zn/Co比率来控制Co物种在裂解过程中的隔离度。更高的Zn/Co比率导致Co原子的空间隔离效果更好,形成隔离的Co氧化物位点,而不是纳米粒子或簇。这种优化的分散有望提高催化性能。当Zn/Co比为4时,TEM和EDX数据确认了制备方法获得的高分散度。
