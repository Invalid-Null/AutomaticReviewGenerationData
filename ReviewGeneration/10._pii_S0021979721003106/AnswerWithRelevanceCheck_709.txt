         [1] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere." 

         [2] "ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 sample was prepared by introducing the metal precursor onto the silicalite-1 using the wet impregnation method."  

         [3] "The intentional addition of Zn2+ can occupy the position of Co2+ and serve as a fence to further expand the adjacent distances of Co atoms."

         [4] "When the mole ratio of Zn and Co increases to 4, no particles can be seen in Fig. 2g and h. The corresponding EDX spectrum shows that the Co species are highly dispersed in the NC layer with the nanoscale."

         [5] "These results collectively prove that the Zn species act as a fence and increase the distance between the adjacent Co atoms in space, thus realizing the spatial isolation of cobalt oxide species with nanoscale."

         Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single cobalt oxide sites in silicalite-1 zeolite supports. The specific methods discussed include: 

         1. Synthesizing bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1, then pyrolyzing under N2 to form nitrogen-doped carbon layers with cobalt species.  

         2. Intentionally adding Zn2+ which can act as a "fence" to increase the distance between adjacent Co atoms and achieve spatial isolation of cobalt oxide species.

         Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses the specific techniques of using zinc as a secondary metal dopant in bimetallic ZnCo-ZIF precursors, and tuning the Zn/Co ratio, to control the isolation and dispersion of cobalt species. TEM and EDX data in Fig. 2 shows that increasing the Zn/Co ratio to 4 yielded highly dispersed cobalt species in the nanoscale range.

         [1] "The XPS spectrum of N 1 s shows that the main nitrogen species after pyrolysis are graphitic-N and pyridinic-N (Fig. S7), which are anchor points for Co species [29], [46], [47]."

         [2] "In order to further elucidate the changes in the structure of CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts during PDH, the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts after 2 h time on stream were also examined using XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 5b, the binding energy of the Co 2p3/2 core level of all the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts shift to higher energy (782 eV) than that of fresh CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts (780 eV), which signifies a transition of the original Co3+ states to lower reduction states during the PDH process [48]."
