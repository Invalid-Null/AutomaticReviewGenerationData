      [1] "After pyrolysis, the organic linker was carbonized into NC layer, and the low-boiling Zn species were evaporated at such a high temperature, while the reduced Co species remained and were encapsulated into the NC layer."
      
      [2] "The CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst exhibits higher propane conversions (>40%) and propene selectivities (>97%), and the propane conversions only decrease a little after 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."

      Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It shows that encapsulating cobalt species in nitrogen-doped carbon layers on a zeolite support prevents aggregation and deactivation during propane dehydrogenation at 600°C. The CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst maintained 40% propane conversion after 10 hours, indicating high stability.

      [1] "Tuning the molar ratio of Zn/Co in the ZIFs, Co species can be spatially separated to a varied isolation degree during pyrolysis, with the lowest degree of isolation for nanoparticles (Zn/Co = 0), a moderate value for small particles (Zn/Co = 2), and the highest isolation degree for isolated metal sites (Zn/Co = 4)." 

      [2] "The TOF value of CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst attains 48.5 h−1, which is higher than that of Co/S-1 (10.6 h−1), CoOx@NC/S-1(0) (16.7 h−1) and CoOx@NC/S-1(2) (30.2 h−1) catalysts."
