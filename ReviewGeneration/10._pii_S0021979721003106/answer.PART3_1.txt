[1] "the spatial distance between the Co atoms can be adjusted due to the coordination environment provided by the organic linker."

[2] "Subsequently, the secondary metals are selectively removed in situ, and isolated metal sites confined in N-doped carbon materials can be synthesized during the pyrolysis process."

[3] "These results collectively prove that the Zn species act as a fence and increase the distance between the adjacent Co atoms in space, thus realizing the spatial isolation of cobalt oxide species with nanoscale."

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It describes using zinc as a "fence" to increase the distance between cobalt atoms in the zeolite framework, and then removing the zinc during pyrolysis to leave isolated cobalt oxide sites encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon layers on the zeolite. This is shown to enhance catalyst stability compared to unsupported cobalt oxide nanoparticles.

[1] "In order to verify the impact of zinc dopant content in bimetallic ZnCo-ZIF precursors on the size and dispersion of CoOx species, TEM and EDX elemental mapping images were tested."

[2] "he intentional addition of Zn2+ can occupy the position of Co2+ and serve as a fence to further expand the adjacent distances of Co atoms." 

[3] "After the pyrolysis, the organic linker was carbonized into NC layer, and the low-boiling Zn species were evaporated at such a high temperature, while the reduced Co species remained and were encapsulated into the NC layer."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies the effect of adding zinc during synthesis of bimetallic zeolitic imidazole frameworks, showing that the zinc occupies sites between cobalt atoms and increases their spacing. This allows isolated cobalt oxide sites to be achieved after pyrolysis. TEM and EDX data confirm high dispersion from the preparation method.

[1] "In order to further elucidate the changes in the structure of CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts during PDH, the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts after 2 h time on stream were also examined using XPS spectra." 

[2] "As shown in Fig. 5b, the binding energy of the Co 2p3/2 core level of all the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts shift to higher energy (782 eV) than that of fresh CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts (780 eV), which signifies a transition of the original Co3+ states to lower reduction states during the PDH process."
