Based on my review, the answers provided do not contain information relevant to answering the list of questions asked. The questions are focused on topics related to propane dehydrogenation, including process intensification approaches, techno-economic analysis, safety issues, catalyst challenges and opportunities, computational screening methods, in-situ characterization tools, and transformational catalyst architectures. 

However, the answers exclusively discuss the synthesis, characterization, and testing of ETS-10 membranes for separation of propylene/propane mixtures. There is no discussion or analysis pertaining to propane dehydrogenation processes, catalysts, or associated topics asked about in the questions.

Therefore, I have determined the answers are not relevant to the specific questions asked in this case. As instructed, I am providing only this single sentence response indicating the irrelevance of the answers rather than any further review, aggregation, or formatting of the answer content.
