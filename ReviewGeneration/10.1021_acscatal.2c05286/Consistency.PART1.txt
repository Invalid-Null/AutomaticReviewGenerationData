 Here is the comparison of the answer files to the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "50%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "50%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I carefully compared the text of each answer file to the correct answers provided and calculated the consistency ratio for each question-file pair. The JSON output summarizes the percentage match between each file's response and the correct answer for the corresponding question number.
