 Unfortunately this literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the provided questions. The questions are focused on process intensification approaches, techno-economic analysis, safety issues, challenges and knowledge gaps, high-throughput computational methods, in-situ characterization tools, and transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation. However, the literature is focused solely on the development and characterization of CexZr1xO2-supported CrOx catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It does not discuss any of the broader topics inquired about in the questions.
