[1] "The oxidation states of Cr for the fresh and spent 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Figure 5). Both Cr6+ and Cr3+ were present in the as-prepared catalysts, with a Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio of 2.45 and 1.75 for 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst, respectively. After the CO2-ODH reaction, CrOx was reduced, and only Cr3+ was observed in both 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts. This suggests that Cr3+ is the active species during the ODH reaction."
</quotes>

<English version answer>

6. Yes, the article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, XPS data reveals that Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ during the CO2-ODH reaction over both ZrO2 and Ce-ZrO2 supported Cr catalysts. This indicates that Cr3+ is the active species responsible for propane dehydrogenation.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

6. 是的,这篇文章使用了X射线光电子能谱学(XPS)来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。具体来说,XPS数据显示在ZrO2和Ce-ZrO2支持的Cr催化剂上,Cr6+在CO2-ODH反应过程中被还原为Cr3+。这表明Cr3+是负责丙烷脱氢的活性物种。

6. Yes, the article uses XPS to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. XPS showed both Cr6+ and Cr3+ in fresh catalysts, while only Cr3+ remained after CO2-ODH reaction for both ZrO2 and Ce-ZrO2 supported catalysts.
