[1] "Comprehensive characterizations were conducted to understand the underlying reaction mechanism. The oxidation states of Cr for the fresh and spent 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Figure 5). Both Cr6+ and Cr3+ were present in the as-prepared catalysts, with a Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio of 2.45 and 1.75 for 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst, respectively. After the CO2-ODH reaction, CrOx was reduced, and only Cr3+ was observed in both 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts. This suggests that Cr3+ is the active site during the ODH reaction."

[2] "In situ DRIFTS study was carried out to provide insights on the CO2-ODH reaction pathway over the 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst (Figure 8). The fresh catalyst was first pretreated at 650 C for 30 min in the presence of 10%O2, followed by cooling down to room temperature for propane adsorption. After propane adsorption, the catalyst was purged at room temperature for 20 min. Adsorption of propane is evidenced by peaks at 1378 and 1456 cm1, corresponding to CH bending. Interestingly, three peaks appear in the region of 15001700 cm1 (i.e., 1560, 1616, and 1675 cm1) due to CC stretching, suggesting the formation of surface-adsorbed propylene. Desorption of propylene was observed when the catalyst was heated above 200 C. When propane and CO2 were coadsorbed on the catalyst surface, both propane and propylene peaks were observed (Figure 8b). Desorption of propylene occurs at above 200 C, similar to the case of propane adsorption only. In the temperature range studied (i.e., 25400 C), no CO peak was observed. This suggests that propane dehydrogenation is more favorable than CO2 splitting over the 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst."

Answer: The article proposes that Cr3+ is the active site for propane dehydrogenation over the Cr/ZrO2 and Cr/Ce-ZrO2 catalysts studied, based on XPS and in-situ DRIFTS characterization. The reaction is proposed to follow a dehydrogenation mechanism, with propane adsorbing and producing propylene on the Cr3+ sites. No CO2 activation is observed.

 <quotes>

[1] "Currently, propylene is mainly produced by two industrial processes: steam cracking of naphtha/liquid petroleum gas and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy gas oils."

[2] "Cr-based catalysts are among the most active catalysts for the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. (25,2830) However, poor catalyst stability remains the main obstacle for the practical implementation of the CO2-ODH process."

[3] "Many heterogeneous catalysts based on redox-active metal oxides (i.e., chromium oxide, vanadium oxide, and iron oxide) and main group metal oxides (i.e., gallium oxide) have been investigated for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane." 

[4] "Among the metal oxide catalysts, Cr-based catalysts have been reported to be among the most promising for the CO2-ODH reaction. For example, mesoporous silica (i.e., MCM-41)-supported metal oxides exhibit activity in the following order: Cr > Ga > Ni, V > Fe, Mn, and Co for CO2-ODH."

[5] "In fact, CrOx is the key component of the industrial catalyst used in the CATOFIN process for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

1. The article evaluates Cr-based catalysts as promising metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It states that Cr-based catalysts are among the most active catalysts for CO2-ODH reaction, and CrOx is a key component in the industrial CATOFIN process. The article also provides data showing Cr-based catalysts supported on MCM-41 exhibit the highest activity compared to other metal oxides like Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. However, poor stability remains an issue.

In fact, negligible CO2 chemisorption over the catalyst was observed based on the CO2-TPD study (Figure S5). Cr3+ as the active site is further supported by cyclic DRIFTS experiments in the presence of propane for two cycles without regeneration of the catalyst in-between (Figure S6)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. The article proposes a mechanistic scenario where propane dehydrogenation occurs over Cr3+ active sites. It provides evidence from XPS and DRIFTS showing that Cr3+ species are present and active for propane dehydrogenation after initial reduction of Cr6+, while CO2 activation is negligible. The DRIFTS study detects propane adsorption and subsequent propylene formation and desorption, supporting a dehydrogenation pathway over Cr3+ sites without redox participation of CO2.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

3. 这篇文章提出了一个机理假设,丙烷在Cr3+活性位点上发生脱氢反应。XPS和DRIFTS的证据显示,在Cr6+最初被还原后,存在Cr3+物种并对丙烷脱氢活跃,而CO2的活化可以忽略不计。DRIFTS研究检测到丙烷吸附后随即生成丙烯并脱附,支持丙烷在Cr3+位点上发生直接脱氢路径,没有CO2的氧化还原参与。
