[1] "Comprehensive characterizations were conducted to understand the underlying reaction mechanism. The oxidation states of Cr for the fresh and spent 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Figure 5). Both Cr6+ and Cr3+ were present in the as-prepared catalysts, with a Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio of 2.45 and 1.75 for 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst, respectively. After the CO2-ODH reaction, CrOx was reduced, and only Cr3+ was observed in both 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts. This suggests that Cr3+ is the active site during the ODH reaction."

[2] "In situ DRIFTS study was carried out to provide insights on the CO2-ODH reaction pathway over the 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst (Figure 8). The fresh catalyst was first pretreated at 650 C for 30 min in the presence of 10%O2, followed by cooling down to room temperature for propane adsorption. After propane adsorption, the catalyst was purged at room temperature for 20 min. Adsorption of propane is evidenced by peaks at 1378 and 1456 cm1, corresponding to CH bending. Interestingly, three peaks appear in the region of 15001700 cm1 (i.e., 1560, 1616, and 1675 cm1) due to CC stretching, suggesting the formation of surface-adsorbed propylene. Desorption of propylene was observed when the catalyst was heated above 200 C. When propane and CO2 were coadsorbed on the catalyst surface, both propane and propylene peaks were observed (Figure 8b). Desorption of propylene occurs at above 200 C, similar to the case of propane adsorption only. In the temperature range studied (i.e., 25400 C), no CO peak was observed. This suggests that propane dehydrogenation is more favorable than CO2 splitting over the 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst."

Answer: The article proposes that Cr3+ is the active site for propane dehydrogenation over the Cr/ZrO2 and Cr/Ce-ZrO2 catalysts studied, based on XPS and in-situ DRIFTS characterization. The reaction is proposed to follow a dehydrogenation mechanism, with propane adsorbing and producing propylene on the Cr3+ sites. No CO2 activation is observed.

答案:该文基于XPS和原位DRIFTS表征提出Cr3+是Cr/ZrO2和Cr/Ce-ZrO2催化剂上丙烷脱氢的活性位点。反应被提出遵循脱氢机理,丙烷吸附并在Cr3+位点上生成丙烯。没有观察到CO2活化。
