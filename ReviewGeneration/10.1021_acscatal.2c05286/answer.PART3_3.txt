[1] "The oxidation states of Cr for the fresh and spent 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Figure 5). Both Cr6+ and Cr3+ were present in the as-prepared catalysts, with a Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio of 2.45 and 1.75 for 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst, respectively. After the CO2-ODH reaction, CrOx was reduced, and only Cr3+ was observed in both 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts. This suggests that Cr3+ is the active site during the ODH reaction."

27. Yes, the article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to probe oxidation state changes of chromium during CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It shows that Cr6+ and Cr3+ are both present initially, but after the reaction only Cr3+ remains, indicating it is the active site.

</English version answer>

27. 是的,本文使用X射线光电子能谱来探测CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢反应过程中铬的氧化态变化。结果显示,最初Cr6+和Cr3+均存在,但反应后只剩下Cr3+,表明它是活性位点。
