[1] "The 5 wt %Cr/CeZrO2 catalysts were synthesized by a one-pot solgel method, as described in the experimental section, followed by calcination in air at 650 C for 6 h."

[2] "By increasing Ce doping from 0 to 100%, the surface area decreases from 99.5 to 30.3 m2/g."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It synthesizes the catalysts by a one-pot sol-gel method followed by calcination to achieve high dispersion of CrOx on CexZr1xO2 supports. Increasing Ce doping from 0-100% decreased the surface area from 99.5 to 30.3 m2/g.

[1] "In situ DRIFTS study was carried out to provide insights on the CO2-ODH reaction pathway over the 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst (Figure 8)." 

[2] "Cr3+ as the active site is further supported by cyclic DRIFTS experiments in the presence of propane for two cycles without regeneration of the catalyst in-between (Figure S6)."

[3] "Comprehensive characterizations were conducted to understand the underlying reaction mechanism. The oxidation states of Cr for the fresh and spent 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Figure 5)."

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ DRIFTS and XPS characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It performed in-situ DRIFTS to provide insights on the CO2-ODH reaction pathway over 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2. Cyclic DRIFTS experiments confirmed Cr3+ as the active site. XPS was used to examine the oxidation states of Cr in fresh and spent catalysts.

[1] "The oxidation states of Cr for the fresh and spent 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Figure 5). Both Cr6+ and Cr3+ were present in the as-prepared catalysts, with a Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio of 2.45 and 1.75 for 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst, respectively."

[2] "After the CO2-ODH reaction, CrOx was reduced, and only Cr3+ was observed in both 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
6. Yes, the article uses XPS to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. XPS showed both Cr6+ and Cr3+ in fresh catalysts, while only Cr3+ remained after CO2-ODH reaction for both ZrO2 and Ce-ZrO2 supported catalysts. This indicates reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ occurs during catalysis.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
6. 是的,文章使用XPS来探测丙烷脱氢化催化过程中的氧化态变化。XPS显示新鲜催化剂中同时存在Cr6+和Cr3+,而在CO2-ODH反应后,ZrO2和Ce-ZrO2支持的催化剂中仅存在Cr3+。这表明催化过程中Cr6+被还原为Cr3+。
