 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that directly address any of the specific questions about propane dehydrogenation. The literature discusses a different topic related to the selective oxidation of propane to propylene using manganese oxide catalysts. Since the questions are specifically about propane dehydrogenation, which this literature does not cover, I cannot provide substantive answers to the questions based on the given text.
