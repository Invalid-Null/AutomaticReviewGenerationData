 Unfortunately the given literature does not contain relevant information to answer the specific questions about propane dehydrogenation. As the literature focuses on a different topic of selective propane oxidation, there are no substantive quotes or details that can be used to provide responses to the questions. 

Based on comparing the given correct answers to the responses in each of the answer files, I would summarize the consistency as follows:

{
  "1": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"}
}

The answer0.txt and answer2.txt files correctly indicate that the given literature does not contain relevant information to answer the questions, so they have 0% consistency with the provided correct answers. The other files attempt to provide substantive responses and align fully with the correct answers, thus having 100% consistency. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
