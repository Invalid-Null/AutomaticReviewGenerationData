Acid Catalysis over Low-Silica Faujasite Zeolites

Abstract
Low-silica faujasite (FAU) zeolites (with Si/Al ratio of ca. 1.2–1.8) sustain framework integrity and porosity upon moderate ion exchange (0.01 M NH4NO3 solution for 1 h at ambient temperature), which introduces two kinds of protons, distinctive in reactivity and coordination to the zeolite framework, within supercages (HSUP). Moderate ion exchange limited within supercages transpires while maintaining full occupancy of Na+ cations within associated sodalite cages; this in turn helps stabilize the framework of low-silica H-FAU zeolites. Protons located on site II (H3630) and site III (H3650) within supercages on low-silica FAU zeolites can be classified and enumerated by virtue of infrared spectroscopy, providing an opportunity to compare reactivities of these distinct protons for monomolecular protolytic reactions of propane. Protons on site II exhibit prominently higher reactivity for monomolecular propane dehydrogenation and cracking than protons on site III. Low-silica proton-form FAU zeolites (zeolite X) upon moderate ion exchange possess protons on site III that are unavailable on high-silica FAU zeolites (zeolite Y) and limit ion exchange within supercages, providing unprecedented high-temperature structural and chemical stability (>773 K) and enabling their application as solid-acid catalysts.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) processes, which account for production of ∼50% of global gasoline supplies, rely primarily on faujasite (FAU) zeolite catalytic formulations. (1) High-silica FAU zeolites, including zeolite Y (Si/Al = 1.5–3 via one-pot synthesis) (2) and ultrastable Y (abbreviated as USY, with Si/Al > 3 via postsynthetic dealumination modification), (3) possess enhanced stability for high-temperature acid catalysis because of lower-framework Al contents in the zeolite framework. (3) Low-silica FAU zeolites, namely, zeolite X (Si/Al = 1–1.5), contain high-framework Al contents that provide abundant nonframework cation positions for ion exchange and find application industrially as molecular sieves, adsorbents, and ion-exchange reagents. (3) Proton-form (H-form) low-silica FAU zeolites, however, are not used as acid catalysts, as the enhanced framework Al content leads to severe dealumination during ion exchange required to prepare H+ form materials, and to framework collapse and pore blockage. (4) Thus, as-synthesized Na-form low-silica FAU zeolites are most often applied either for alkali catalysis (e.g., side-chain alkylation of toluene over Cs-X catalysts) (5) or as supports to encapsulate metal clusters within intracrystalline voids; they are not used as acid catalysts. (6) We report that moderate ion exchange (0.01 M of NH4NO3 solution for 1 h at ambient temperature) can be used as an effective strategy to achieve site-specific H+ exchange to formulate thermally stable low-silica (Si/Al = 1.2–1.8) H-FAU zeolites.
Precedence for the use of moderate and incomplete ion exchange can be found in our recent report on zeolite Y (Si/Al = 1.7). (7) High-silica H-FAU zeolites prepared upon ion exchange of as-synthesized alkali containing FAU materials result in formulations with protons located within both supercages and sodalite cages. (7,8) Remarkably, ion exchange of low-silica FAU materials using 0.01 M NH4NO3 does not allow occluded alkali cations within small-pore sodalite cages to be removed, but instead only removes Na+ circumscribed by large pore 12-membered ring supercages. Na+ cations act as inorganic templates to stabilize sodalite cages during zeolite crystallization, (9) and we surmise that the characteristic of low-silica FAU to limit H+ exchange to supercages enables occluded Na+ cations within sodalite cages to stabilize the framework for H+-catalyzed reactions at ∼800 K. Protons on low-silica FAU materials engendered upon moderate ion exchange can be associated with two distinct crystallographic positions within the supercage and exhibit different reactivity for high-temperature protolytic reactions of propane. We used a combination of techniques─including probe molecule infrared spectroscopy, synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Ar-adsorption─to probe the structural and chemical characteristics of low-silica H-FAU zeolites, and distinguish two kinds of protons within supercages based on the band area ratio of OH3630/OH3650 (i.e., OHSII/OHSIII, SII and SIII refer to site II and site III in supercages, as shown in Figure 1a) in infrared spectra acquired upon the adsorption of pyridine. (10) We selected monomolecular H+-catalyzed probe reactions of propane to compare dehydrogenation (kD) and cracking (kC) rate constants over the two kinds of protons (H3630 and H3650). In comparison to protons on site III (H3650), rates of propane dehydrogenation and cracking are prominently enhanced on protons on site II (H3630).

2. Results and Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
We selected six low-silica FAU zeolites, synthesized following protocols reported in the literature (see recipes in Table S1), to perform moderate ion exchange (0.01 M of NH4NO3 solution for 1 h). In all ion exchange experiments, we used 0.25 g of zeolite powder per 40 cm3 of ammonium solution. The EMT phase, which shares the same building units with the FAU phase but possesses a different stacking sequence of sodalite cages, (11) can be formed due to intergrowth phenomena during crystallization. (12) The peak area ratio of FAU(111) / (FAU(111) + EMT(100)) in XRD patterns can be used to estimate FAU/EMT fractions, (12) and all six Na-FAU zeolites reported herein exhibit high FAU fractions (Figure S1, Table 1 column 7). All Na-FAU (Figure S2) and H-FAU zeolites (Figure S3) remained crystalline without the detection of amorphous phases, and all H-FAU zeolites maintained higher than ca. 70% of pristine uptake capacity at p/p0 = 0.01, as confirmed by Ar-adsorption isotherms (Figure S4 insets). 29Si solid-state NMR spectra (Figure S6 and Table S2) were used to measure the distribution of Q4(nAl) Si species on H-FAU zeolites. The existence of Q2 Si species (a shoulder peak at ∼−88 ppm) (13) in these spectra suggests that mild dealumination occurs upon moderate ion exchange; consequently, proton-form materials exhibit enhanced framework Si/Al ratios (Table 1, column 4) compared to bulk Si/Al ratios (Table 1, column 2). We calculated the framework Si/Al ratio of zeolite materials from these data in accordance with “Loewenstein’s rule” (eq 1), (14) which stipulates that Al-O-Al linkages are absent in the zeolite framework.

Infrared spectra of dehydrated materials can be used to differentiate proton locations in zeolites. (16,17) Gounder et al. (18) reported that the band at ∼3600 cm–1 (Figures 1 and S7) is ascribed to OH groups on amorphous extrazeolite phases and is unrelated to acidic OH groups bridging adjacent Al and Si atoms in the zeolite framework. For conventional high-silica H-FAU zeolites (Figure S7), the symmetric band at ∼3640 cm–1 is ascribed to OH groups in supercages, while the band at ∼3550 cm–1 is ascribed to OH groups in sodalite cages. (18,19) For low-silica H-FAU zeolites reported here (Figure 1b–g), Figure S8, we observed only the asymmetric band centered at ∼3650 cm–1 with a shoulder at ∼3630 cm–1, which is ascribed to OH groups in supercages; the band at ∼3550 cm–1 ascribed to OH groups in sodalite cages was not observed. We discuss below a plausible explanation of this distinctive proton distribution in ion-exchanged low-silica FAU zeolites (which also works for commercial zeolite 13X, as shown in Figure S9) and discuss the reactivity of the two kinds of protons (H3630 and H3650) within supercages (HSUP) for high-temperature acid-catalyzed reactions of propane. (17,20)
For sites located within supercages, site II is located in the middle of 6-MR, and site III is located on the two neighboring 4-MRs. (24,25) The band at ∼3650 cm–1 is ascribed to H+ on site III, and the band at ∼3630 cm–1 is ascribed to H+ on site II, in line with early infrared studies from Kazansky. (10) Sites II and III are fully occupied (with a maximum multiplicity of 32) (21) by Na+ cations over low-silica Na-FAU zeolites (96 Na+/u.c.), while site II is fully occupied, but site III is the least occupied by Na+ cations over high-silica Na-FAU zeolites (58 Na+/u.c.); this is in accordance with inferences from Maesen and co-workers on the basis of Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns and configurational-bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations. (24) This difference explains why the infrared band ascribed to Si-OH-Al groups in supercages is asymmetric over low-silica FAU zeolites (Figure 1b–g and Figure S8), but symmetric over high-silica FAU zeolites (Figure S7)─namely, moderate ion exchange takes place on sites II and III at the same time over low-silica H-FAU zeolites, but only on site II over high-silica H-FAU zeolites. Site I′ is located on the external bases of prisms and within sodalite cages (24,25) and is fully occupied by Na+ cations on low-silica FAU zeolites, but it is not fully occupied by Na+ cations on high-silica FAU zeolites (Table 3 of ref (24)). Considering that sodalite cages are small voids connected to large supercages (Figure 1a) and that cation clusters can be stabilized within sodalite cages, (26,27) we speculate that the full occupancy of Na+ cations on site I′ excludes ammonium cations from sodalite cages at moderate ion exchange conditions. We posit that the occlusion of Na+ cations within sodalite cages enhances the stability of low-silica H-FAU zeolites at high temperatures, (28) as confirmed by XRD patterns (Figure S3) and Ar-adsorption isotherms (Figure S4) of H-FAU zeolites. No wavenumber shift or band deformation was observed after thermal treatment in vacuum (∼0.01 Torr) at 673 K for 5 h, suggesting that Na+ cations are not mobile and specificity in H+ exchange is retained under aggressive reaction environments for low-silica H-FAU samples. (Figure S10).
We compared proton reactivities of H3630 and H3650 on FAU zeolites in high-temperature reactions by molecular dehydrogenation and cracking of propane (eqs 2 and 3) probe reactions.

Kester et al. (29) reported that carbonaceous deposits contribute extrinsic active sites to promote alkane dehydrogenation, but intrinsic H+-catalyzed propylene formation rates can be assessed when samples are pretreated in H2 to remove any remnant reactive carbon species, and H2 is present in the inlet stream to mitigate on-stream deposition of organic species. We pretreated samples using H2/He mixtures (pH2 = 35 kPa, H2/He = 1:2) and cofed H2 (pH2 = 5.3 kPa, H2/C3H8/Ar/He = 3/3/1.5/60) in the inlet stream at different temperatures (818, 833, 848, 863, 878, and 893 K). Under these conditions, we observed first-order dependence of initial propylene and ethylene formation rates (Figures S11a,b and S12a,b) on propane pressure, and we observed these rates to be invariant with weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) (Figures S11c,d and S12c,d). At all conditions, CH4/C2H4 ratios fluctuated around unity (Figure S13), excluding potential secondary reactions of ethylene. We observe a 2.5× difference in rate constants assessed on a per gram basis among the six low-silica H-FAU zeolites for both dehydrogenation (Figure 2a) and cracking (Figure 2b), suggesting that protons located on sites II and III in low-silica FAU have distinct reactivity. We used the infrared band area ratio of OH3630/(OH3630 + OH3650) to estimate the OH3630 fraction in HSUP (Table 2, column 2), combining it with the HSUP per unit cell (Table 2, column 3) determined from chemical formulae (Table 1, column 5) to calculate specific proton densities (Table 2) to differentiate the reactivity of H3630 and H3650. The specific contributions of H3630 (Table 2, column 7) and H3650 (Table 2, column 8) to measured rate constants were determined from eq 4.

Specific rate constants for H3630 and H3650, including kD,3630, kD,3650, kC,3630, and kC,3650, were deemed to remain constant at a specific temperature among the six low-silica H-FAU materials and were assessed in AthenaVisual Studio to provide optimal estimates with 95% marginal HPD intervals, as shown in Figures 2c,d and S18. A comparison among experimental koverall and predicted koverall for dehydrogenation and cracking reactions is provided in Figures S14 and S15. Apparent enthalpic (Eapp) and entropic (ΔSapp) barriers for propane dehydrogenation and cracking over H3630 (on site II) and H3650 (on site III) measured from Figures S14a and S15a are provided in Table S3. These Eapp and ΔSapp values conflate kinetic and thermodynamic parameters and are not readily amenable to comparison among different zeolite frameworks. However, it is noteworthy that the rate constants per proton on low-silica FAU materials in this report are similar to those tabulated by Gounder and Iglesia for ZSM-5, MOR, and FER zeolites. (20)
As mentioned above, we deem that high-silica H-FAU zeolites only contain protons on site II within supercages as confirmed by the presence of the OH band at ∼3630 cm–1 in Figure S5 of our prior work, (7) and the reported kD,SUP and kC,SUP values (Figure 3c in ref (7)) are closer to the values of kD,3630 (Figure 2c) and kC,3630 (Figure 2d). H3630 located on site II exhibit higher averaged rate constants (on a per proton basis) for both propane dehydrogenation (Figure 2c) and propane cracking (Figure 2d) in reference to H3650 located on site III (Figure 2d). The plausibility of H3630 and H3650 catalyzing H+ reactions identically was excluded based on the large differences among experimental koverall and predicted koverall for dehydrogenation and cracking (Figures S16 and S17). Distinction in reactivity of protons circumscribed in the same pore environment but different T sites as noted here has not been experimentally demonstrated to date; such claims have only been based on computational chemistry studies.

3. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In summary, low-silica FAU zeolites (Si/Al = 1.2–1.8) remain stable at moderate ion exchange conditions (0.01 M of aqueous NH4NO3 solutions for 1 h; 0.25 g zeolite per 40 cm3 solution), resulting in two kinds of H+ sites in supercages, as inferred from subtraction infrared spectra of pyridine adsorption. We found that moderate ion exchange preferentially takes place within supercages over low-silica H-FAU zeolites with the occlusion of Na+ cations in associated sodalite cages. This distinctive proton distribution is intrinsically determined by Na+-cation distribution and framework Al contents. Considering that rare-earth additives are applied industrially to stabilize sodalite cages within high-silica FAU frameworks, occlusion of Na+ cations (the absence of H+ sites) within sodalite cages upon moderate ion exchange appears to accomplish the same in low-silica H-FAU zeolites. Among the two kinds of HSUP engendered upon moderate ion exchange, low-silica FAU zeolites provide new H+ sites on site III, which are unavailable on high-silica FAU zeolites. Distinct reactivity of protons on site II (located in the middle of 6-MR with a wavenumber signature at ∼3630 cm–1) from that of protons on site III (located on the two neighboring 4-MRs with a wavenumber at ∼3650 cm–1) for monomolecular reactions of propane is observed, demonstrating heterogeneity among protons localized at different crystallographic sites in a zeolite but confined in the same pore. We surmise that the synthesis protocols reported here for stabilizing low-silica FAU materials can be extended to other low-framework silicon content zeolites hitherto considered to have limited stability in the H+ form (e.g., zeolite LTA), offering a new class of shape-selective solid-acid catalysts stable for high-temperature operation.
