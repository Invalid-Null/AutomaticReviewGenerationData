<quotes>
[1] "It has been shown that SUZ-4-supported PtSnNa (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability."

[2] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."  

[3] "Because the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."

[4] "In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it shows that the strong acid sites of SUZ-4 prevented impregnation of the Pt precursor into the zeolite pores, leading to Pt particles being dispersed on the external surface. In contrast, the weak acid sites of ZSM-5 allowed more precursor impregnation into the pores, resulting in high Pt dispersion inside the pores after calcination.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
3. 是的,文章研究了针对优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。具体来说,它表明SUZ-4的强酸位阻止了Pt前驱体渗透入分子筛孔内,导致Pt颗粒分散在外表面。相反,ZSM-5的弱酸位允许更多的前驱体渗透入孔内,在煅烧后导致孔内Pt高度分散。

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it shows that the acidity of the zeolite support affects the dispersion of Pt particles. Stronger acid sites on SUZ-4 prevent Pt impregnation into the zeolite pores, localizing Pt on the external surface. In contrast, weaker acid ZSM-5 allows more Pt precursor to enter the pores and disperse as clusters during calcination.

3. 是的,文章调查了针对优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。具体来说,它表明分子筛载体的酸度会影响Pt颗粒的分散。SUZ-4上更强的酸点能防止Pt渗入分子筛孔内,将Pt局限在外表面。相比之下,酸度较弱的ZSM-5允许更多的Pt前驱体进入孔内,并在煅烧过程中以簇的形式分散。

It shows that the strong acid sites of SUZ-4 prevented impregnation of the Pt precursor into the zeolite pores, resulting in Pt being dispersed primarily on the external surface. In contrast, the weak acid sites of ZSM-5 allowed the Pt precursor to enter the pores and form highly dispersed clusters. This optimized dispersion on SUZ-4 enhanced stability by preventing deactivation from carbon deposition.

[1] "The structure and catalytic properties of PtSn catalysts supported on SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied by using various experimental techniques including XRD, nitrogen adsorption, NH3-TPD, TG, H2-TPR and TPO techniques combined with propane dehydrogenation tests."

[2] "In recent years, zeolites such as SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 have been found to be good supports because of their high surface areas, good thermal stabilities, large pore volumes and tunable acidity [12, 13, 14]."

[3] "The addition of sodium ions improved both the propane conversion and the propylene selectivity (entries 2,3 vs. 1), as shown in Table 1." 

[4] "A sodium content of 1.0% was found to be optimal (entries 3 vs. 2,4) and so was used in the following experiments."

[5] "Dibenzothiophene poisoning experiments were performed to investigate the detailed structures of the two supported catalysts."

[6] "To further assess the interaction of each component in the PtSnNa catalyst, TPR with H2 was performed."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies PtSn catalysts supported on SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolites using characterization techniques to understand the catalytic properties (Quote 1). It notes that zeolites like SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 are good supports due to their high surface area, thermal stability, pore volume and tunable acidity, which helps optimize metal dispersion (Quote 2). It shows adding sodium ions improves propane conversion and propylene selectivity, with 1.0% sodium being optimal (Quotes 3-4). It performs poisoning experiments to investigate the catalyst structures (Quote 5). It also uses H2-TPR to assess the interaction between Pt, Sn and the support, which affects metal dispersion (Quote 6).
