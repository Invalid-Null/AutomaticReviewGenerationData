<quotes>
[1] "It has been shown that SUZ-4-supported PtSnNa (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability."

[2] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."  

[3] "This is because that the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."

[4] "In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It shows that the strong acid sites of SUZ-4 prevented impregnation of the Pt precursor into the zeolite pores, resulting in Pt being dispersed primarily on the external surface. In contrast, the weak acid sites of ZSM-5 allowed the Pt precursor to enter the pores and form highly dispersed clusters. This optimized dispersion on SUZ-4 enhanced stability by preventing deactivation from carbon deposition.

3. 对,文章研究了优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它表明SUZ-4 的强酸位阻止了Pt前驱体进入分子筛孔隙,导致Pt主要分散在外表面。相比之下,ZSM-5的弱酸位使Pt前驱体进入孔隙并形成高度分散的簇。SUZ-4上的这种优化分散增强了稳定性,防止了碳积聚导致的失活。
