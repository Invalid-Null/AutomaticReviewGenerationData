<quotes>
[1] "The structure and catalytic properties of PtSn catalysts supported on SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied by using various experimental techniques including XRD, nitrogen adsorption, NH3-TPD, TG, H2-TPR and TPO techniques combined with propane dehydrogenation tests."

[2] "In recent years, zeolites such as SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 have been found to be good supports because of their high surface areas, good thermal stabilities, large pore volumes and tunable acidity [12, 13, 14]."

[3] "The addition of sodium ions improved both the propane conversion and the propylene selectivity (entries 2,3 vs. 1), as shown in Table 1." 

[4] "A sodium content of 1.0% was found to be optimal (entries 3 vs. 2,4) and so was used in the following experiments."

[5] "Dibenzothiophene poisoning experiments were performed to investigate the detailed structures of the two supported catalysts."

[6] "To further assess the interaction of each component in the PtSnNa catalyst, TPR with H2 was performed."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies PtSn catalysts supported on SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolites using characterization techniques to understand the catalytic properties (Quote 1). It notes that zeolites like SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 are good supports due to their high surface area, thermal stability, pore volume and tunable acidity, which helps optimize metal dispersion (Quote 2). It shows adding sodium ions improves propane conversion and propylene selectivity, with 1.0% sodium being optimal (Quotes 3-4). It performs poisoning experiments to investigate the catalyst structures (Quote 5). It also uses H2-TPR to assess the interaction between Pt, Sn and the support, which affects metal dispersion (Quote 6).

3. 是的,文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它使用各种表征技术研究了负载在SUZ-4 和ZSM-5分子筛上的PtSn催化剂,以了解其催化性能(引用1)。它指出SUZ-4和ZSM-5等分子筛因其高比表面积、热稳定性、孔体积和可调酸性而成为良好的载体,这有助于优化金属分散(引用2)。它显示添加钠离子可提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性,1.0%的钠含量是最佳的(引用3-4)。它进行了中毒实验以研究催化剂结构(引用5)。它还使用H2-TPR评估了Pt、Sn与载体之间的相互作用,这会影响金属分散(引用6)。
