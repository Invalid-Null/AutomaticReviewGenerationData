<quotes>
[1] "It has been shown that SUZ-4-supported PtSnNa (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability."

[2] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."  

[3] "Because the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."

[4] "In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it shows that the strong acid sites of SUZ-4 prevented impregnation of the Pt precursor into the zeolite pores, leading to Pt particles being dispersed on the external surface. In contrast, the weak acid sites of ZSM-5 allowed more precursor impregnation into the pores, resulting in high Pt dispersion inside the pores after calcination.

3. 是的,文章研究了针对优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。具体来说,它表明SUZ-4的强酸位阻止了Pt前驱体渗透入分子筛孔内,导致Pt颗粒分散在外表面。相反,ZSM-5的弱酸位允许更多的前驱体渗透入孔内,在煅烧后导致孔内Pt高度分散。
