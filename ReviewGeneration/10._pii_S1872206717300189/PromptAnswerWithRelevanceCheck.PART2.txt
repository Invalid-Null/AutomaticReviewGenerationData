<quotes>
[1] The structure and catalytic properties of PtSn catalysts supported on SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied by using various experimental techniques including XRD, nitrogen adsorption, NH3-TPD, TG, H2-TPR and TPO techniques combined with propane dehydrogenation tests.

[2] Supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been widely used because of their high activities and environmentally friendly characteristics [1, 2]. 

[3] In recent years, zeolites such as SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 have been found to be good supports because of their high surface areas, good thermal stabilities, large pore volumes and tunable acidity [12, 13, 14].

[4] Zhou's group [20] investigated propane dehydrogenation over ZSM-5-supported Pt-Sn catalysts and found that the propylene selectivity was significantly improved by introducing promoters to neutralize the support acidity. 

[5] PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability.
