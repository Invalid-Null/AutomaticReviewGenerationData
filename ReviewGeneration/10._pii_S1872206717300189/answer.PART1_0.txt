<quotes>
[1] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to exhibit higher activity and improved stability compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "The structure and catalytic properties of PtSn catalysts supported on SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied by using various experimental techniques including XRD, nitrogen adsorption, NH3-TPD, TG, H2-TPR and TPO techniques combined with propane dehydrogenation tests."

[3] "Compared with the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 afforded the highest propylene yields of up to 20%."
