[2] Supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been widely used because of their high activities and environmentally friendly characteristics [1, 2].

[4] Zhou's group [20] investigated propane dehydrogenation over ZSM-5-supported Pt-Sn catalysts and found that the propylene selectivity was significantly improved by introducing promoters to neutralize the support acidity.

[5] PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability.

[1] In recent years, zeolites such as SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 have been found to be good supports because of their high surface areas, good thermal stabilities, large pore volumes and tunable acidity [12, 13, 14].

[2] SUZ-4-supported catalysts have been widely used in many processes, such as the conversion of n-hexane [16], the synthesis of dimethyl ether from methanol [17], and the elimination of nitrogen oxides [18].

[3] PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability.

Yes, the article evaluates zeolite supports like SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It finds SUZ-4 to be a better support than ZSM-5, providing data showing higher activity and stability for PtSnNa/SUZ-4 compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5. The article suggests the tunable acidity and pore structure of zeolites make them promising supports.
