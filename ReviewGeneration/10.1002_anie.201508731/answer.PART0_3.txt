[1] "Propene, used in the chemical industry for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs is mainly produced from crude oil."

[2] "One way to convert propane to propene is the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is a successful example of raw-material change in the chemical industry."

[3] "Commercial catalysts with CrOx or PtSn species typically supported on Al2O33 are either toxic or have a limited availability of the active components."

[4] "Recently, Weckhuysen and co-workers5 developed an active Al2O3-supported catalyst consisting of two typical propane dehydrogenation components, that is, Pt and Ga2O3." 

[5] "In a long-term test over 150PDH/regeneration cycles, this catalyst, however, lost around 30% of its initial activity during the first twenty sequences and then operated at a stable level."

1. The article provides background that propylene is mainly produced from crude oil and is used in the chemical industry to make polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs. It states that propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a way to convert propane to propylene and is a successful example of raw material change in the chemical industry. The article mentions that commercial PDH catalysts using CrOx or PtSn on Al2O3 supports are either toxic or limited in availability. It also describes recent work by Weckhuysen using a Pt and Ga2O3 on Al2O3 catalyst that lost 30% of initial activity over 150 PDH cycles before stabilizing.

1. 文章提供了丙烯主要从原油中生产,并用于化学工业制造聚合物、溶剂、染料、树脂、纤维和药物的背景。它指出丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种将丙烷转化为丙烯的方法,并且是化学工业原料变化的一个成功例子。文章提到使用CrOx或PtSn在Al2O3载体上的商业PDH催化剂要么有毒,要么供应有限。它还描述了Weckhuysen最近使用Pt和Ga2O3在Al2O3催化剂上的工作,该催化剂在150个PDH循环中损失了30%的初始活性,然后稳定下来。
