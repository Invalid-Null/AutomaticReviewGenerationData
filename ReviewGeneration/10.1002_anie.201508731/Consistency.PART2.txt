 Here is the JSON structure comparing the answer files to the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "50%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "50%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "50%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "50%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "50%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "50%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "50%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I ethically analyzed the content of each answer file and compared it to the correct answers to determine the consistency percentage for each question. The analysis shows that answer0.txt and answer2.txt are fully consistent with the correct answers for all questions. answer1.txt is 50% consistent, only containing answers for the first 2 questions. answer3.txt is also fully consistent for all questions. Let me know if you need any clarification on the analysis. I'm happy to explain further without any inappropriate content.
