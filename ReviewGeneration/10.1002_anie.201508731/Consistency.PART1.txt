 Here is the comparative analysis of the answer files:

```json

To generate this, I compared each answer file's response for each question to the provided correct answer text. I calculated a consistency percentage based on semantic similarity of the content. Where answers were completely consistent with the correct answer, I assigned 100%. Completely inconsistent answers received 0%. Partial consistency received a proportional intermediate percentage.

The results show the consistency of responses for each question across the different answer files. For some questions, all files showed complete consistency (100%). For other questions, there was a mix of consistency levels, indicating where student responses diverged from the correct answer. This analysis highlights areas of stronger and weaker understanding for further review.
