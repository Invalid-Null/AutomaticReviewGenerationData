</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] We initially selected metal oxides differing in oxygen surface mobility,8 that is, SiO2, Al2O3, 10Si90AlOx (10wt% SiO2 in Al2O3), 40Si60AlOx (40wt% SiO2 in Al2O3), and LaZrOx (10wt% La2O3 in cubic ZrO2).
[2] The supports were significantly less active than the corresponding catalysts but their activity increased as the strength of the metaloxygen bond decreased.

Answer: The article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It selects metal oxides like SiO2, Al2O3, SiO2-Al2O3, and LaZrOx differing in oxygen mobility, and finds their activity increases as the metal-oxygen bond strength decreases.

答:本文研究了调谐金属氧化物的氧化态、氧迁移性和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它选择了氧迁移性不同的SiO2、Al2O3、SiO2-Al2O3和LaZrOx等金属氧化物,并发现随着金属氧键强度的降低,它们的活性增加。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] Herein, we elucidated and provide general fundamentals for designing alternative catalysts composed of unconventional PDH components, in which lattice defects of the support are the catalytically active sites. Our working hypothesis was that oxides of metals which usually have an unchangeable oxidation state but a high oxygen mobility can generate the required defects under PDH conditions. ZrO2 promoted with other metal oxides is a typical representative of such materials6 and has actually been used as a support for catalytically active Pt, CrOx, or GaOx species.
[2] Based on the results presented above and mechanistic studies on alkane dehydrogenation over CrOx-containing12 and GaOx-containing7d,13 catalysts, we postulate that Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen participate in the CH bond activation resulting in the formation of ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species. After the elimination of the β-hydrogen, propene and hydrogen are formed.

[1] ZrO2 promoted with other metal oxides is a typical representative of such materials6 and has actually been used as a support for catalytically active Pt, CrOx, or GaOx species.3d However, the loading was too high to test the intrinsic support activity.  
[2] We initially selected metal oxides differing in oxygen surface mobility,8 that is, SiO2, Al2O3, 10Si90AlOx (10wt% SiO2 in Al2O3), 40Si60AlOx (40wt% SiO2 in Al2O3), and LaZrOx (10wt% La2O3 in cubic ZrO2).
[3] Remarkably, pristine LaZrOx with the weakest metaloxygen bond gave an even higher rate than the catalysts with Ru or RhNPs on SiO2Al2O3 and slightly lower than Pt/SiO2Al2O3.

[1] We put forward that Ru NPs participate in the formation of adsorbed hydrogen species, which remove lattice oxygen from LaZrOx thus yielding Zrcus.  
[2] According to theoretical calculations,14 the excess electron density is mainly localized in the anion vacancy. Thus, Zr4+cus and not Zr3+cus should participate in propane activation.  
[3] After the elimination of the β-hydrogen, propene and hydrogen are formed.

Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the studied ZrO2-based catalysts.

Theoretical calculations suggest the excess electron density is localized in the anion vacancy, so Zr4+cus rather than Zr3+cus participates in propane activation.
