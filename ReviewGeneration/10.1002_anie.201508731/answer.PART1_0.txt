[1] We initially selected metal oxides differing in oxygen surface mobility,8 that is, SiO2, Al2O3, 10Si90AlOx (10wt% SiO2 in Al2O3), 40Si60AlOx (40wt% SiO2 in Al2O3), and LaZrOx (10wt% La2O3 in cubic ZrO2).
[2] The supports were significantly less active than the corresponding catalysts but their activity increased as the strength of the metaloxygen bond decreased.

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It selects metal oxides like SiO2, Al2O3, SiO2-Al2O3, and LaZrOx differing in oxygen mobility, and finds their activity increases as the metal-oxygen bond strength decreases.

[1] Herein, we elucidated and provide general fundamentals for designing alternative catalysts composed of unconventional PDH components, in which lattice defects of the support are the catalytically active sites. Our working hypothesis was that oxides of metals which usually have an unchangeable oxidation state but a high oxygen mobility can generate the required defects under PDH conditions. ZrO2 promoted with other metal oxides is a typical representative of such materials6 and has actually been used as a support for catalytically active Pt, CrOx, or GaOx species.
[2] Based on the results presented above and mechanistic studies on alkane dehydrogenation over CrOx-containing12 and GaOx-containing7d,13 catalysts, we postulate that Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen participate in the CH bond activation resulting in the formation of ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species. After the elimination of the β-hydrogen, propene and hydrogen are formed.

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. It suggests coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) and neighboring lattice oxygen in ZrO2-based catalysts participate in C-H bond activation to form Zrcus-C3H7 and OH surface species. After β-hydrogen elimination, propene and hydrogen are formed.

答:本文为在所研究的金属氧化物催化剂上丙烷脱氢提出了机制假说。它认为ZrO2基催化剂中配位不饱和的Zr阳离子(Zrcus)及相邻的晶格氧参与C-H键活化形成Zrcus-C3H7和OH表面物种。经过β-氢消除后,生成丙烯和氢气。
