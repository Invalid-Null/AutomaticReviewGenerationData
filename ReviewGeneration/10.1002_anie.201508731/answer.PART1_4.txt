[1] Compared to conventional supported PDH catalysts, alternative catalysts are bulk metal oxides with lattice defects on their surface functioning as active sites. The concept was verified for propane dehydrogenation over ZrO2-based catalysts, where Zrcus cations were identified to be the PDH active sites. Such sites can be created by promoting ZrO2 with metal oxides, which induce formation of structural anion vacancies or enhance ZrO2 reducibility.

<English version answer>
Answer: The article does investigate how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It reveals that promoting ZrO2 with metal oxides induces formation of structural anion vacancies or enhances ZrO2 reducibility, which creates active Zrcus sites for propane dehydrogenation.

[1] Compared to conventional supported PDH catalysts, alternative catalysts are bulk metal oxides with lattice defects on their surface functioning as active sites. The concept was verified for propane dehydrogenation over ZrO2-based catalysts, where Zrcus cations were identified to be the PDH active sites.  
[2] Based on the results presented above and mechanistic studies on alkane dehydrogenation over CrOx-containing12 and GaOx-containing7d,13 catalysts, we postulate that Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen participate in the CH bond activation resulting in the formation of ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species. After the elimination of the β-hydrogen, propene and hydrogen are formed.

<English version answer>
Answer: The article does propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. It describes that Zrcus cations act as active sites, and that Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen participate in CH bond activation to form ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species. After β-hydrogen elimination, propene and hydrogen are formed.
