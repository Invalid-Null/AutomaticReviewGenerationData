[1] ZrO2 promoted with other metal oxides is a typical representative of such materials6 and has actually been used as a support for catalytically active Pt, CrOx, or GaOx species.3d However, the loading was too high to test the intrinsic support activity. 
[2] We initially selected metal oxides differing in oxygen surface mobility,8 that is, SiO2, Al2O3, 10Si90AlOx (10wt% SiO2 in Al2O3), 40Si60AlOx (40wt% SiO2 in Al2O3), and LaZrOx (10wt% La2O3 in cubic ZrO2).
[3] Figure1A presents the rate of propene formation over supported catalysts and pristine supports. To assure the metallic state of Pt, Rh, and Ru, the catalysts (as well as the pristine supports) were pre-treated in a flow of H2 at 550C before the reaction. The supports were significantly less active than the corresponding catalysts but their activity increased as the strength of the metaloxygen bond decreased.

<English version answer>
Answer: The article does investigate how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It tests metal oxides like SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, La2O3 with different oxygen mobility. It finds that activity increases as metal-oxygen bond strength decreases, with LaZrOx showing the highest intrinsic activity among supports.

答:文章确实研究了调节金属氧化物的氧化状态、氧迁移能力和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它测试了不同氧迁移能力的SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, La2O3等金属氧化物。发现随着金属氧强度的降低,活性增加,LaZrOx作为载体表现出最高的固有活性。

[1] Our mechanistic analysis led us to the conclusion that coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus, where cus=coordinatively unsaturated) are the active sites possessing PDH activity and selectivity comparable to those of an industrially relevant CrOx-containing catalyst.  
[2] We postulate that Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen participate in the CH bond activation resulting in the formation of ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species. After the elimination of the β-hydrogen, propene and hydrogen are formed.

<English version answer>
Answer: The article does propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. It proposes that coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) are the active sites, which activate the C-H bond together with lattice oxygen to form Zrcus-C3H7 and OH species. After β-H elimination, propene and H2 are formed.

答:文章确实为所研究的金属氧化物催化剂提出了反应机理假说。它提出协调不饱和的锆离子(Zrcus)是活性中心,和晶格氧一起激活C-H键,生成Zrcus-C3H7和OH物种。经过β-H消除,生成丙烯和H2。
