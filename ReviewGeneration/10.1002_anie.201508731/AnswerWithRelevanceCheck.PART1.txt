         [1] ZrO2 promoted with other metal oxides is a typical representative of such materials6 and has actually been used as a support for catalytically active Pt, CrOx, or GaOx species.3d However, the loading was too high to test the intrinsic support activity.
         [2] We initially selected metal oxides differing in oxygen surface mobility,8 that is, SiO2, Al2O3, 10Si90AlOx (10wt% SiO2 in Al2O3), 40Si60AlOx (40wt% SiO2 in Al2O3), and LaZrOx (10wt% La2O3 in cubic ZrO2). 
         [3] Remarkably, pristine LaZrOx with the weakest metaloxygen bond gave an even higher rate than the catalysts with Ru or RhNPs on SiO2Al2O3 and slightly lower than Pt/SiO2Al2O3.

         Answer: The article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It evaluates metal oxides like SiO2, Al2O3, SiO2-Al2O3, and LaZrOx with different oxygen mobility. LaZrOx with the weakest metal-oxygen bond and highest oxygen mobility showed the highest intrinsic activity among the supports tested.

         答:本文的确探究了调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧迁移性和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它评估了氧迁移性不同的SiO2、Al2O3、SiO2-Al2O3和LaZrOx等金属氧化物。金属氧键最弱、氧迁移性最高的LaZrOx显示出测试支撑体中最高的固有活性。

         [1] Our mechanistic analysis led us to the conclusion that coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus, where cus=coordinatively unsaturated) are the active sites possessing PDH activity and selectivity comparable to those of an industrially relevant CrOx-containing catalyst.
         [2] We postulate that Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen participate in the CH bond activation resulting in the formation of ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species. After the elimination of the β-hydrogen, propene and hydrogen are formed.

         Answer: The article does propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. It proposes that coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) are the active sites, which activate the C-H bond together with lattice oxygen to form Zrcus-C3H7 and OH species. After β-H elimination, propene and H2 are formed.

         答:文章确实为所研究的金属氧化物催化剂提出了反应机理假说。它提出协调不饱和的锆离子(Zrcus)是活性中心,和晶格氧一起激活C-H键,生成Zrcus-C3H7和OH物种。经过β-H消除,生成丙烯和H2。
