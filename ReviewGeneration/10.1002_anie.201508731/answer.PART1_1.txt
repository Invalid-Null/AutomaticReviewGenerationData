<quotes>
[1] ZrO2 promoted with other metal oxides is a typical representative of such materials6 and has actually been used as a support for catalytically active Pt, CrOx, or GaOx species.3d However, the loading was too high to test the intrinsic support activity.  
[2] We initially selected metal oxides differing in oxygen surface mobility,8 that is, SiO2, Al2O3, 10Si90AlOx (10wt% SiO2 in Al2O3), 40Si60AlOx (40wt% SiO2 in Al2O3), and LaZrOx (10wt% La2O3 in cubic ZrO2).
[3] Remarkably, pristine LaZrOx with the weakest metaloxygen bond gave an even higher rate than the catalysts with Ru or RhNPs on SiO2Al2O3 and slightly lower than Pt/SiO2Al2O3.

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It evaluates metal oxides like SiO2, Al2O3, SiO2-Al2O3, and LaZrOx with different oxygen mobility. LaZrOx with the weakest metal-oxygen bond and highest oxygen mobility showed the highest intrinsic activity among the supports tested.

答:该文章研究了调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧迁移性和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它评估了氧迁移性不同的SiO2、Al2O3、SiO2-Al2O3和LaZrOx等金属氧化物。金属氧键最弱、氧迁移性最高的LaZrOx显示出测试支撑体中最高的固有活性。

[1] We put forward that Ru NPs participate in the formation of adsorbed hydrogen species, which remove lattice oxygen from LaZrOx thus yielding Zrcus.  
[2] According to theoretical calculations,14 the excess electron density is mainly localized in the anion vacancy. Thus, Zr4+cus and not Zr3+cus should participate in propane activation.  
[3] After the elimination of the β-hydrogen, propene and hydrogen are formed.

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the LaZrOx catalyst. It suggests that Ru NPs generate adsorbed hydrogen species that remove lattice oxygen and create Zr4+cus active sites. The Zr4+cus sites activate the C-H bond of propane, forming adsorbed propyl species. After β-hydrogen elimination, propene and hydrogen are produced as final products.

答:该文章为LaZrOx催化剂上的丙烷脱氢提出了一个机理场景。它认为Ru纳米粒子产生吸附的氢物种,这些氢物种去除晶格氧生成Zr4+cus活性位点。Zr4+cus位点激活丙烷的C-H键,形成吸附的丙基物种。经过β-氢消除后,生成丙烯和氢气作为最终产物。
