[1] "The dispersion of VOx species influences dramatically their redox and acidic properties." 

[2] "In combination with the catalytic performance, it can be speculated that highly dispersed VOx species showed higher apparent TOF value and stability, and lower propylene space time yield and propylene selectivity."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states and dispersion of vanadium oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It finds that highly dispersed vanadium oxide species have higher turnover frequency and stability, but lower propylene yield and selectivity compared to more aggregated vanadium oxide species.

2. 是的,文献研究了调控氧化钒的氧化态和分散度如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。发现高度分散的氧化钒物种具有更高的周转数和稳定性,但与更聚集的氧化钒相比,丙烯产量和选择性较低。

[1] "Propane molecule is activated at VOV site, and the transfer of proton from propane to VOSi is such proposed which would lead to the formation of isopropoxide and a SiOH group (Step 1). The as-formed propy-vanadate species reacts to form VOxC3H5 followed by H2 releasing (Step 2), as the rate-limiting step proved by temporal analysis of products (TAP)." 

[2] "In-situ DRIFTS results suggest that VOx-C3H5 species is an important intermediate which was observed both in propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation. Its further conversion brings about the formation of gas-phase propylene or coke."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the vanadium oxide catalysts. It suggests propane activation occurs at V=O sites to form propyl-vanadate intermediates which convert to VOx-C3H5 species. VOx-C3H5 is identified as a key intermediate, and its further reaction releases H2 as the rate-limiting step. VOx-C3H5 can also lead to propylene or coke formation.

3. 是的,文献提出了氧化钒催化剂上丙烷脱氢的反应机理。文献认为丙烷在 V=O 位点活化形成丙基钒化物中间体,后者转化为 VOx-C3H5 物种。VOx-C3H5被认为是关键中间体,其进一步反应释放 H2 为速率控制步骤。VOx-C3H5也可以导致丙烯或焦炭的形成。

[1] "Silica-based materials are typically used as supports for preparing selective PDH catalysts as they do not possess acidic sites which are considered to negatively affect selectivity due to coke formation."

[2] "Hexagonal mesoporous SiO2 (HMS) possessing medium mesopore and high specific surface area is especially suitable due to its prominent capacity in improving the active sites dispersion and enhancing the diffusion of reactants."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects by using hexagonal mesoporous silica as the support. It states that silica supports help provide selectivity in PDH by eliminating acidic sites that promote coke formation. HMS is identified as an optimal support for dispersing and stabilizing vanadium oxide active sites while enabling reactant diffusion.

4. 是的,文献使用六方介孔二氧化硅作为载体来探索金属-载体界面效应。文献指出,硅基载体通过消除促进焦炭形成的酸性位点来提高PDH的选择性。六方孔硅被认为是最佳的载体,可以使氧化钒活性位点得到分散和稳定,同时允许反应物扩散。
