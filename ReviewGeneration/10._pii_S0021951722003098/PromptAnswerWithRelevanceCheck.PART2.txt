 Unfortunately this article does not compare the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The article focuses solely on investigating vanadium oxide species supported on hexagonal mesoporous silica for propane dehydrogenation. No examples or explanations of selectivity modulation between metallic and oxidized metal catalysts are provided.
