[1] "Vanadium was introduced to hexagonal mesoporous SiO2 (HMS) to prepare supported vanadium-based catalysts (V-HMS). Their catalytic performance in the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) was modulated with V surface density varying from 0.12 to 15.08V atom·nm2."

[2] "High amounts of vanadium could be well dispersed as VOx on the surface of HMS, and propylene yield was 1.2 times higher in comparison with SBA-15-based sample [26]."
