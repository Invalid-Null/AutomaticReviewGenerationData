Abstract
Vanadium was introduced to hexagonal mesoporous SiO2 (HMS) to prepare supported vanadium-based catalysts (V-HMS). Their catalytic performance in the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) was modulated with V surface density varying from 0.12 to 15.08V atom·nm−2. VOx species with different structure were analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR and XPS. High propylene space time yield of 0.73 kg·h−1·kgcat−1 and excellent regeneration behavior were achieved. Correlating VOx polymerization degree with catalytic performance, VOx aggregates, mainly in low-polyvanadate form, were established to reveal high intrinsic activity and stability in comparison with their counterparts, including isolated or/and highly polymerized VOx as well as V2O5. Temporal analysis of products (TAP) identified hydrogen formation as the rate-limiting step in the PDH reaction. In-situ DRIFTS was employed to investigate the reaction mechanism. V species containing C=C bond, i.e., VOx-C3H5, was proposed to be an intermediate of gas-phase propylene.

1. Introduction
Propylene serves as a key basic feedstock for the production of various chemicals such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, etc. With the increasing demand for propylene, besides conventional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, alternative production routes with high efficiency and low cost are highly expected [1], [2]. Recently, driven by the development of exploring technology for shale gas, on-purpose non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) has caught much attention [3]. Pt and Cr-based catalysts are commercialized ones in several PDH processes including STAR, Oleflex, FDB, Catofin, etc [1]. Whereas, the high price of Pt and toxicity of Cr(VI) limit their widespread use, and the development of novel non-noble metal-based catalysts is highly needed. Zn-[4], Co- [5], Fe- [6], Ga- [7], V- [8] and ZrO2-based catalysts [9], [10] are reported to be active in PDH.
Compared with Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, vanadium-based catalysts are found to be highly active and selective to propylene with good regeneration ability [11], [12], [13]. The mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH) over such catalysts has been extensively studied. V5+/V4+ or V5+/V3+ redox cycle was considered to be important [14]. Nevertheless, only a limited number of studies were focused on PDH, and the recognition of effective VOx species needs to be further strengthened. The nature of VOx species and its catalytic performance are related to vanadium precursor usage, additive introduction and preparation method. It was found that the textural property and vanadium species dispersion of the catalyst can be influenced by employing different vanadium precursors which might possess different decomposition behaviors, and thus modulate the catalytic performance in PDH [15]. It was found that some additives, such as P and Mg, can adjust the surface acidity and interaction between VOx species and support, which would further affect catalytic performance [16], [17].
In addition, the choice of support has been regarded as the key point influencing catalyst activity and product selectivity. The structure of VOx species could be modulated by the kind of support through variation of texture property, acidity and vanadium-support interaction, which could tune the polymerization degree of VOx [8], [15], [18], [19]. Silica-based materials are typically used as supports for preparing selective PDH catalysts as they do not possess acidic sites which are considered to negatively affect selectivity due to coke formation. Especially for mesoporous SiO2, it has large surface area and practically no acidic sites. Mesoporous SiO2 also has highly ordered meso-structure, which can disperse metal oxide species into their channels easily [20]. As reported, SiO2-supported catalysts possess well-defined surface VOx species, and exhibit good catalytic performance in PDH [21], [22]. Rodemerck et al [23] compared VOx/SiO2, VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/SiO2-Al2O3 in terms of their intrinsic activity, on-stream stability and product selectivity. Among them, VOx/SiO2 possesses higher selectivity to propylene due to suppressed coke formation. Moreover, Chen et al [24] found that low polymerized VOx can be anchored on SiO2 support by the interaction of VOx species and surface hydroxyl groups, and this could improve the reactivity and stability by altering the electron state of active sites. Hexagonal mesoporous SiO2 (HMS) possessing medium mesopore and high specific surface area is especially suitable due to its prominent capacity in improving the active sites dispersion and enhancing the diffusion of reactants [25], [26]. High amounts of vanadium could be well dispersed as VOx on the surface of HMS, and propylene yield was 1.2 times higher in comparison with SBA-15-based sample [26]. However, deep studies on VOx species in vanadium-based HMS catalysts are rare, and the specific active sites are still unclear [27]. The influence of vanadium loading on polymerization degree, acidity and redox properties is ambiguous, especially on catalytic performance in PDH. To close such gaps, the present work aimed to study systematically the nature of VOx species and the catalytic performance of vanadium-based HMS catalysts in this reaction.
Herein, a series of HMS-supported vanadium-containing catalysts (V-HMS) with different V loadings were prepared, characterized and studied in PDH. The polymerization degree of VOx species as well as their redox and acidic properties were analyzed by XRD, UV–vis spectroscopy, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, etc. to understand their influence on catalytic performance. Typical catalyst of 8V-HMS with 8 wt% of vanadium on HMS exhibited 0.73 kg·h−1·kgcat−1 of propylene space time yield, and its initial activity could be well retained after regeneration for three cycles, which could all be attributed to the formation of VOx aggregates (mainly in low-polyvanadate form). Based on temporal analysis of products, H2 formation is determined as the rate-limiting step in the PDH reaction over V-HMS. The evolution of propane dehydrogenation over the as-prepared catalysts was also studied.
2. Experiments
2.1. Chemicals
Ammonium vanadate (NH4VO3, AR, lot number l1925074) and lauryl amine (DDA, 98%, lot number l1626065) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin biochemical technology Co., Ltd. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, AR, lot number 20200904) and oxalic acid dihydrate (AR, lot number 20180718) were bought from Sinopharm chemical reagent Co., Ltd., with ethanol (99.7%, lot number 20211016) from Tianjin Jindongtianzheng Precision Chemical Reagent Factory. All the chemicals were used as received.

2.2. Catalyst preparation
2.2.1. HMS preparation
3.5 g of DDA were dissolved into 24 mL of ethanol at room temperature followed by 34 mL of deionized water (DI) addition, and solution A could be well prepared after stirring vigorously for 30 min. Then, 5 mL of ethanol and 14.5 mL of TEOS were mixed and stirred for 15 min to prepare solution B, which was subsequently mixed dropwise with solution A, and stirred vigorously for 24 h at room temperature. The obtained mixture was filtrated and washed with DI for several times followed by drying at 90 °C for 6 h. After calcination at 550 °C for another 6 h, HMS powder could be prepared.
2.2.2. V-HMS Preparation
Vanadium-based HMS samples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. In detail, taking 1 wt% of V introduction for example, 0.046 g of NH4VO3, 2 g of HMS, 15 mL of DI and 0.1 g of oxalic acid dihydrate were mixed, and stirred at room temperature for 24 h followed by sonication for another 1 h. The extra water was evaporated at 90 °C, and the obtained powder was dried at 90 °C for 6 h followed by calcination at 550 °C for 6 h in air. During the preparation of other VOx-based HMS samples, the ratio of NH4NO3 to oxalic acid dihydrate was kept at 1:2. The as-prepared sample was denoted as nV-HMS, where n represents the theoretical weight percentage (wt%) of vanadium.
2.3. Characterizations
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained with ASAP 2460 Micromeritics at −196 °C. Before the test, a certain amount of sample was pre-treated in vacuum at 90 °C for 1 h and 300 °C for 3 h. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation and BJH method were used for data analysis. ICP-OES for V loading analysis was carried on by Agilent ICPOES730. XRD patterns were obtained from Bruker D8 Advance with a CuKα radiation operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. The scanning rate was 2°·min−1 in the 2θ range of 5–90°. UV-2600 (SHIMADZU) was used to collect UV–vis spectra in the range of 200–900 nm, and BaSO4 was served as the standard. XPS spectra were obtained from Thermo-escalab-250Xi, and all spectra were corrected with C 1s at 284.8 eV. TEM characterization was conducted on FEI Tecnai G2 F20 at electric voltage of 200 kV.
NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) profiles of as-prepared samples were recorded by TP-5076 (Xianquan China) automatic adsorption apparatus with a TCD detector. In a typical run, 100 mg of V-HMS was pretreated under N2 at 600 °C for 1 h and cooled down to room temperature, followed by adsorbing 5 %NH3/N2 for 30 min. After desorption with N2 for 2 h, the sample was heated from room temperature to 600 °C at the rate of 10 °C/min to record TCD signal. H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles were obtained with Pfeiffer-Vacuum-Omni Star GSD320. 100 mg of as-detected sample, pretreated at 550 °C under N2 for 1 h, was reduced by 5 %H2/Ar from room temperature to 900 °C at the rate of 10 °C/min with recording H2 (m/z = 2) and Ar (m/z = 40) signals. TGA analysis was done with Netzsch STA 449 F5/F3 Jupiter, and the temperature was increased from room temperature to 800 °C at the rate of 10 °C/min.
In-situ DRIFTS spectra were conducted on Bruker VERTEX 70 equipped with a Harrick DRP-BR4 DRIFT cell and a mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector. A certain amount of sample was pretreated under N2 flow (38.4 mL/min) at 550 °C for 30 min, and background spectra at desired temperature were recorded during the cooling step. Propane was introduced firstly at 30 °C for 30 min, and the temperature was elevated to 100, 200, 300, 400 and 550 °C sequentially to record DRIFTS spectra. After reaction at 550 °C, the sample cooled down in N2 to 30 °C, and the spectrum was recorded again after 30 min N2 sweeping. Propylene hydrogenation was also carried on for mechanism analysis by in-situ DRIFTS. During the test, propylene was introduced at 30 °C to adsorb for 30 min, followed by H2 adsorption for another 30 min. With increasing temperature from 30 °C to 550 °C step by step, DRIFTS spectra were recorded. Besides, ex-situ IR spectrum of spent catalyst was collected with KBr as the background.
2.4. Temporal analysis of products
The ability of 8V-HMS (selected as a representative material) to catalyze H/D exchange and C3H8 dehydrogenation was investigated in the temporal analysis of products (TAP-2) reactor. This is a pulse technique with a time resolution of approximately 100 µs. More details can be found in the references [28], [29]. A fresh catalyst sample (46 mg) was packed between two layers of quartz particles (fraction of 250–450 µm) in the isothermal zone of an in-house-made quartz tubular reactor (inner diameter: 6 mm, length: 40 mm). Prior to the experiments, the catalyst was heated in vacuum to 550 °C and then exposed to the flow of H2 (3 mL·min−1) and Ar (3 mL·min−1) for 30 min followed by evacuation to about 10−5 Pa. Hereafter, H2/D2/Ar = 1/1/1 or C3H8/Ar = 1/1 mixtures were pulsed at the same temperature. The mixtures were prepared using D2 (CK Special Gases Limited, N2.8), H2 (Air Liquide, 5.0), C3H8 (Air Liquide, 3.5) and Ar (Air Liquide, 5.0) without additional purification. The pulse size was 3.3 × 1015 and 1.9 × 1015 molecules in the experiments with D2 and C3H8, respectively. The feed components and the reaction products were quantitatively analyzed by an online quadrupole mass spectrometer (HAL RC 301, Hiden Analytics). The following atomic mass units (AMUs) were used for mass spectrometric analysis: 44.0 (C3H8), 42.0 (C3H8, C3H6), 41.0 (C3H8, C3H6), 30.0 (C3H8, C2H6), 29.0 (C3H8, C2H6), 28.0 (C3H8, C2H6, C2H4), 27.0 (C3H8, C3H6, C2H6, C2H4), 16.0 (CH4), 4.0 (D2), 3.0 (HD), 2.0 (H2) and 40.0 (Ar). For each AMU, the pulses were repeated 10 times and averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. For a proper comparison of the responses of gas-phase components differing in their molecular weights like C3H8 and H2, the experimental data were transformed into their dimensionless form according to the reference [30].
2.5. Propane dehydrogenation
Propane dehydrogenation tests were carried out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor of 6 mm diameter. 50 mg of the as-prepared sample was pressed into 40–60 mesh and filled into the reactor. After increasing the temperature to 550 °C, the sample was pretreated under N2 for 30 min. 10 mL/min of 40% C3H8/N2 was then introduced, and propane dehydrogenation reaction started. To test the intrinsic activity of the catalyst, the initial conversion was controlled to be below 10%. During the regeneration stability tests, the initial conversion was at around 15%. All products including propylene, ethylene, ethane and methane were analyzed with an on-line gas chromatograph (TP-3420 from Beijing Beifen-Ruili analytical instrument (group) Co., Ltd.) equipped with a FID detector and a capillary column of Agilent 115–3532.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physicochemical properties of V-HMS
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and texture properties of as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. S1a and Table 1. All the samples, except for 10V-HMS and 15V-HMS, show type IV isotherm with H2 hysteresis loop, illustrating the mesoporous structure of HMS even impregnated with VOx species. When V loading is 10 wt% and 15 wt%, obvious texture property changes caused by pore blockage could be observed. This difference is more noticeable in the pore size distribution (Fig. S1b and Table 1). When V loading is lower than 8 wt%, an average pore size is around 3.2 to 3.5 nm, and increased with rising V loading above 10 wt%, which might be caused by the vanadium species in large size blocking the pores. The blockage causes the loss of mesopores and promotes the formation of partic piled pores with large average size. This is in accordance with specific surface area (SBET) analysis. When V loading increased from 0 to 8 wt%, the SBET value decreased from 793 to 567 m2·g−1. A continuous increase in V loading to 15 wt% led to a lower specific surface area of 106 m2·g−1. Apparent V surface densities were calculated from the actual V loading and the specific surface area of as-prepared catalysts.

The reflex at 2θ of 1.6°, which is characteristic of the HMS structure, could be found in the XRD patterns of samples with V loading lower than 8 wt% but disappears in the patterns of 10V-HMS and 15V-HMS (Fig. S2a). This phenomenon might be caused by the blockage of mesopores of HMS upon vanadium introduction, especially when the V loading is very high, which can be in accordance with texture properties in Table 1 [31], [32]. Wide angle XRD patterns of as-prepared vanadium catalysts are shown in Fig. S2b. All the catalysts possess a characteristic reflex at 22°, belonging to the amorphous SiO2 structure [20]. For the samples with V loading lower than 8 wt%, very weak diffraction reflexes at 2θ of 15.3°, 20.2°, 26.1°, 31.0°, etc. could be found, indicating V2O5 starts to form. Their presence is obvious in the patters of 10V-HMS and 15V-HMS possessing V2O5 clusters [18].
3.2. Influence of V loading on nature of HMS-supported VOx species
To gain insight into the structure of supported VOx species, UV–vis spectra of as-prepared catalysts were recorded (Fig. 1a). Four kinds of absorption bands located at 200–265, 265–350, 350–450 and 450–575 nm could be found, which relate to the VOSi band, VOV band of low-polyvanadate, polyvanadate and V2O5, respectively [8], [15], [20], [33], [34], [35]. All the vanadium-based samples possess VOSi band at 200–250 nm due to O2–→Vn+ electronic transition. For 1V-HMS, only one band, the VOSi band with the maximum at 225 nm, could be found and is assigned to isolated VOx species. Thus, monovanadate is the main species on the surface of 1V-HMS. The VOSi absorbance band is shifted to higher wavelengths with an increase in V loading which agrees with previous reports [34], [36]. The band intensity at 250–350 nm in the spectra of the samples with V loading of 3 wt% and 5 wt% increases strongly accompanied by an appearance of an inconspicuous band at 350–450 nm. With a further increase in the loading to 8 wt%, VOV bands of low-polyvanadate and V2O5, located at 407 and 500 nm, are seen in the corresponding UV–vis spectrum.

Fig. 1. UV–vis spectra of V-HMS (a) and relationship between V density and band gap (b).
To compare the dispersion of VOx quantitatively, the band gap of as-prepared samples was determined from their UV–vis spectra [37], [38], and the results are shown in Table 1 and Fig. S3. The band gap decreases from 4.38 to 3.30 eV with increasing V loading from 1 wt% to 15 wt% (Table 1) or V surface density from 0.12 to 15.08V·nm−2 (Fig. 1b). The decrease is more pronounced for samples with low V surface densities and reaches the minimum at the highest V surface density. It proves that more VOx species with higher polymerization degrees are formed with rising V surface density [39], [40], [41]. Thus, monovanadate is the main species in 1V-HMS, and with increasing V loading to 5 wt%, monovanadate and low-polyvanadate are formed. Low-polyvanadate is the dominant species with gradually formed polyvanadate in 8V-HMS. V2O5 clusters exist in 10V-HMS.
NH3-TPD profiles of as-prepared samples were recorded to analyze the influence of V loading on acidity (Fig. S4a and Table 2). For HMS, no obvious NH3 desorption peak could be observed. After introduction of VOx species, NH3 desorption could be clearly found, indicating the acidity stems from the supported species. Fig. S4b shows the correlation between the amount of acidic sites and the band gap. When V loading is in the range of 1–10 wt%, the amount increases gradually with rising aggregation of VOx species, which is in agreement with literatures [40], [42]. The highest acidity could be found over 10V-HMS. For V loading at 15 wt%, the acid amount decreases, which might be caused by the formation of V2O5 cluster [15], [22].

Sample NH3-TPD H2-TPR
Acid amount (μmol NH3·gcat−1) Tmax(oC) H2 comsumption (μmol H2·gcat−1)
1V-HMS 238 569 78
3V-HMS 394 587 268
5V-HMS 577 600 420
8V-HMS 1063 614 756
10V-HMS 1157 629 1239
15V-HMS 835 660 1327
H2-TPR profiles of as-prepared V-HMS show that all the samples exhibit a reduction peak at 500–600 °C (Fig. 2a). According to the references [8], [43], [44], the maximum H2 consumption temperature (Tmax) at 580–650 °C corresponds to the reduction of polymerized VOx species. The Tmax of different VOx species follows the trend of Tmonovanadate < Tlow-polyvanadate < Tpolyvanadate < TV2O5. Thus, it could be deduced herein that 1V-HMS which has Tmax of 569 °C possesses mainly monovanadate species, and this is in accordance with the above-discussed relationship between the band gap and V surface density values. With increasing V loading to the range of 3–10 wt%, the polymerization degree of V species increases. V2O5 clusters are present in 15V-HMS and are characterized by the Tmax value of 660 °C [45]. By analyzing the influence of band gap on Tmax (Fig. 2b) and H2 consumption (Fig. 2c), it can be concluded that both the temperature to reduce oxidized VOx species and the H2 consumption amount increase with V loading, and the difference in the reducibility between V=O, VOSupport, VOV and V2O5 clusters is the main reason for this [46], [47].

XP spectra were recorded to analyze the oxidation state of vanadium in surface VOx species and the results are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3. It should be mentioned that the intensity of the V 2p3/2 signal in the spectrum of 1V-HMS is very low due to the low V loading and the results are accordingly not shown here. Three observed binding energies at around 518.5, 517.3 and 516.5 eV could be assigned to highly dispersed V5+ species interacting with SiO2, normal V5+ species including that in V2O5, and V4+ and/or V3+ species, respectively [36], [48], [49]. This indicates the coexistence of vanadium species in different chemical valences. The normalized proportion of VOx species listed in Table 3 shows that the proportion of highly dispersed V5+ species could still maintain in high level with V loading of 8 wt% (Fig. 3c). Besides, the proportion of normal V5+ species at around 517.3 eV showed a dramatical increase when the V loading increases further up to 15 wt% (Fig. 3e). In combination with the characterization results mentioned above, it further proves that V2O5 clusters are largely formed on the surface of 15V-HMS. Moreover, with ICP analysis, V/Si mole ratio in the as-prepared catalysts is higher than that characterized by XPS. Thus, it could be speculated that VOx species are dispersed mainly inside HMS [15]. The relationship between V loading and the fraction of different VOx species is shown in Fig. S5. When V loading increases from 3 wt% to 15 wt%, the fraction of V4+/V3+ species decreases from 28% to 10%, while that of normal V5+ species (including that in V2O5) increases from 30% to 49%. The variation of highly dispersed V5+ with V loading is not as large as those of V4+/V3+ species and normal V5+ species.

15V-HMS 0.20 0.10 518.8(41%) 517.5(49%) 516.3(10%)
According to the analysis mentioned above, a possible surface mode of the studied catalysts could be concluded herein. Monovanadate is the main V species in 1V-HMS, and monovanadate and low-polyvanadate coexisted at 3 wt% and 5 wt% of V loadings. 8V-HMS, dominated by low-polyvanadate V species, possesses the highest amount of low-polyvanadate compared with others. With further increasing the amount of V, the polymerization degree of V species continually increases, and V2O5 clusters, as the main species, exist at 15 wt% of V loading.
3.3. Catalytic performance of as-prepared V-HMS
Propane conversion over as-prepared V-HMS catalysts was controlled below 10% to compare their intrinsic activities in PDH. The initial propane conversion increased from 4.1% to 8.9% with increasing V loading from 1 wt% to 8 wt% (Fig. S6a) and slightly from 8.9% to 9.1% with increasing V loading to 10 wt%. The activity dramatically decreased to 6.8% with a further increase in V loading to 15 wt%. To further investigate the influence of the kind of VOx species on catalytic performance, we tried to correlate the band gap with catalyst performance. As seen in Fig. 4, the same trend could be observed for the initial propane conversion, propylene selectivity and space time yield of propylene (STY). 10V-HMS with the band gap value of 3.39 eV shows the best catalytic performance, and 8V-HMS is in the second place (Fig. 4a-c). The dependence of apparent TOF and deactivation coefficient (kd) on the band gap is established to further reveal the relationship between catalytic performance and VOx structure, which are given in Fig. 4d and 4e. It is obvious that when the band gap decreases from 4.38 to 3.30 eV, the apparent TOF value dramatically decreases from 44.4 to 3.7 h−1. For the kd value in Fig. 4e which represents the deactivation rate constant, it maintains at around 0.71 h−1 with V loading of 1-5 wt% (band gap of 4.38–3.89 eV), and it shows increase from 0.7 to 0.8 h−1 when V loading rises to 10 wt% with band gap value of 3.52 eV. Notable increase of kd value from 0.8 to 1.2 h−1 could be found with V loading up to 15 wt%.

In combination of these catalytic results with the characterization data discussed above, it could be deduced that 1V-HMS possesses high apparent TOF value, indicating that monovanadate species are intrinsically more active than their counterparts with higher polymerization degrees. While, 1V-HMS showed the lowest propylene selectivity of 78.8%, which might be also caused by the high activation ability, leading to the formation of more by-products. Increasing V loading to 10 wt% leads to VOx species with higher polymerization degree. At the same time, the initial propane conversion could be enhanced with the formation of polymerized VOx species, accompanied by the maximum of propylene selectivity (92.9%). Increasing the loading of V to 15 wt%, leading to abundant V2O5 clusters formation, would decrease the amount of active sites, and the catalyst deactivated dramatically. It should be noticed that for 8V-HMS and 10V-HMS, the similar catalytic performance could be observed, which might be resulted from higher fraction of low-polyvanadate and polyvanadate.
In consideration of both catalytic performance and deactivation, 8V-HMS, with suitable acidity and proper VOx species in the form of highly dispersed low-polyvanadate, exhibits high catalytic performance in PDH, which would be further used in the following mechanism study. Besides, for benchmarking purpose, a comparison of STY value over 8V-HMS with reported results is also given in Fig. S6. It could be confirmed that even under the conditions of high propane concentration and low V loading, 8V-HMS stays at the high-level compared with other vanadium-based catalysts in PDH [8], [11], [12], [15], [18], [20], [40], [22], [50].
3.4. Regeneration stability
The regeneration performance of 8V-HMS is illustrated in Fig. 4f. During the first 2 h time on stream PDH, propane conversion decreased from 16.1% to 10.5% while propylene selectivity maintained at 92–94%. After calcination of spent catalyst at 550 °C in air for 30 min, the initial propane conversion and the selectivity to propylene could be fully recovered as 16.8% and 90.2% respectively. A similar trend could be observed during the second and third regeneration cycles, indicating the high regeneration ability of 8V-HMS. This result shows that VOx species are stable during the PDH reaction, and coke deposition should be the reason for activity loss with increasing time on propane stream.
TEM images were recorded before and after reaction to verify the dispersion of VOx species (Fig. S7-S9). It could be found in Fig S7a and S7b that there is no obvious VOx species on HMS support. In the EDX mapping images of Fig. S8 and S9, VOx species could be found to disperse well on HMS before and after reaction. After regeneration test, a spacing of 0.24 nm corresponding to the graphite hexagons could be found which confirmed the formation of coke deposition [51]. Besides, after regeneration, 8V-HMS showed IR band at 1618 cm−1 indicating the existence of unsaturated aromatic hydrocarbons (illustrated in Fig. S10) [52], and this is in accordance with TEM image.
TG-DTA analysis was applied to analyze the nature of deposited coke on the surface of 8V-HMS after reaction and the results are depicted in Fig. S11. An exothermic peak at 370 °C in DTA curve could be observed, and this indicates the formation of deposited carbon species on the spent catalyst. Furthermore, the weight loss of 0.0836 g·gcat−1 in TG curve could be found when the temperature increased to 800 °C. In combination with regeneration results, this implies that the coke formation is the main reason for activity loss.
3.5. Rate-limiting step in PDH
The temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor operating at sub-millisecond contact time was applied for analyzing kinetically relevant step(s) in the course of the PDH reaction over 8V-HMS. The catalyst was reduced in a flow of H2/Ar = 1/1 at 550 °C for 30 min to mimic the reduction state of vanadium in the catalyst as under the PDH conditions but to avoid coke formation (see section 2.4). Propylene and hydrogen were detected after pulsing a C3H8/Ar = 1/1 at 550 ℃. The height-normalized responses of the alkane and the reaction products are shown in Fig. 5. The time scale was converted into a dimensionless form as suggested by Gleaves et al [30]. The dimensionless time is defined as t·Di/L2, where t is the experimental time, Di is the effective diffusion coefficient of each component, and L is the reactor length. The diffusion length for C3H6 and H2 was set from the beginning of the catalyst layer to the reactor outlet, while the whole reactor length was taken into consideration for C3H8. The transformation of the experimental responses is required for correct comparing the order of appearance of C3H8/C3H8 and H2 strongly differing in their diffusion velocity due to the strongly different molecular weights. The diffusion coefficients of C3H8, C3H6, and H2 were calculated from that of Ar according to the reference [30].

Fig. 5. Normalized (the axis X was transformed into a dimensionless form according to [30] transient responses of (a) C3H8 (green), C3H6 (blue) and H2 (red) after pulsing of a C3H8/Ar = 1/1 mixture and (b) D2 and H2 after pulsing of a H2/D2/Ar = 1/1/1 mixture at 550 ℃.
The responses of C3H6 and H2 appear after the response of C3H8 because these products are formed from the alkane. However, the rates of their formation are different as concluded from the position of the maximum of the corresponding responses. The maximal rate of H2 formation was achieved after the rate of C3H6 formation already declined (Fig. 5a). On this basis, we can safely conclude that the rate-limiting step in the course of PDH is H2 formation but not the cleavage of C-H bonds in C3H8. To check this conclusion independently, we carried out hydrogen isotopic exchange experiments by pulsing a H2/D2/Ar = 1/1/1 mixture. HD was not formed (Fig. 5b). This means that the rate of breaking of H-H and D-D and/or formation of H-D bond is very low. This result further supports that the PDH reaction is limited by H2 formation, while C3H6 formation proceeds faster.
3.6. PDH mechanism investigation with in-situ DRIFTS
Aiming to understand the mechanism of the PDH reaction over V-HMS catalysts, propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation over as-prepared 8V-HMS were investigated by in-situ DRIFTS, and the results are shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Fig. S12. In No. 1-5 spectra in Fig. 6, at reaction temperature below 400 °C, propane could be detected with characteristic peaks at 2966, 1470 and 1375 cm−1, standing for C-H bond antisymmetric stretching vibration and in-plane bending vibration [18]. Surprisingly, when the reaction temperature reached 550 °C (spectrum No. 6), a new band at 1735 cm−1 appeared, indicating the transformation of propane on the surface of 8V-HMS. After sweeping under N2 and cooling down to 30 °C (spectrum No. 7), the characteristic bands of propane, at 2966, 1470 and 1375 cm−1, disappeared proving the desorption of propane. It should be noticed here that the band at 1735 cm−1 could be remained after N2 sweeping (spectrum No. 7) which means the formation of intermedia species possessing strong interaction with 8V-HMS.

After desorption in N2 and cooling down to 30 °C, another spectrum numbered (7) was recorded.
Hydrogenation of propylene over 8V-HMS was also investigated. After adsorption of propylene and H2 in sequence at 30 °C (No.1 of Fig. 7), characteristic bands at 3089, 2950, 1664, 1639, 1470 and 1442 cm−1 assigned to propylene could be observed [18]. With increasing temperature to 550 °C (spectrum No. 6 in Fig. 7) under H2/N2, two new bands at 1735 and 1325 cm−1 appeared, which could stay still even after desorption under N2 and cooling down to 30 °C (spectrum No. 7). From Fig. S12, the band at 1325 cm−1 could not be observed over bare HMS, and coke-related species would be at 1618 cm−1 as shown in Fig. S10. This indicates the band at 1325 cm−1 is not from coke species. Besides, it was reported that symmetrical vibration of CH3-related species can be observed at around 1358 cm−1 during Rh catalyzed methane conversion reaction [53]. And it is well known that propylene is more active than propane, and side reactions of propylene would occur under the PDH reaction conditions. Therefore, it is deduced here that the appearance of this 1325 cm−1 band may be due to the methyl-vanadate related species, which can be generated through propylene cracking.
Besides the band at 1325 cm−1, it should be noticed that the band at 1735 cm−1 was identified in the spectra both in propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation processes. This indicates the two processes were reversed, and species at 1735 cm−1 could be deemed as intermedia during PDH. Generally speaking, the first step of PDH is often deemed as propane activation over metal oxide-based catalysts to form saturated alkane-metal species and bridge-bonded OH group [54], [55], [56], [57]. As reported in reference [58], saturated propane related species would hardly lead to the formation of the band at 1735 cm−1. In an oxidative propane dehydrogenation research [59], a band located at 1740 cm−1 was assigned to CO bond of acetaldehyde related species. While in this work, 1735 cm−1 band could be observed both in propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation, and the abundant existence of H2 would hinder the formation of CO bond, elucidating this band is not associated with CO. Meanwhile, for metal or metal oxide catalyzed PDH, propenyl-metal species were reported as intermedia, such as zinc propyl species [60] and propenyl-V species [18]. Thus, with consideration of general reported IR band position of VOx species, propenyl-VOx species (VOxC3H5) was proposed herein, and the CC bond of VOx-C3H5 might be associated with the band at 1735 cm−1.
Based on the above analysis of characterizations and catalytic data, a possible mechanistic scheme can be drawn, and it is shown as Scheme 1. For VOx species with low polymerization degree (such as low-polyvanadate VOx species in 8V-HMS), V5+ is firstly reduced to V3+ and lattice oxygen was removed, leading to the formation of V-O-V species and oxygen vacancy, which can be confirmed by XPS and TPR analysis. These sites firstly adsorb propane for further C-H bond activation [14], [50]. With the literature of ref. [61], metalOSi species on the surface are deemed to participate in the formation of H2 in PDH. Propane molecule is activated at VOV site, and the transfer of proton from propane to VOSi is such proposed which would lead to the formation of isopropoxide and a SiOH group (Step 1). The as-formed propy-vanadate species reacts to form VOxC3H5 followed by H2 releasing (Step 2), as the rate-limiting step proved by temporal analysis of products (TAP). The suggested VOxC3H5 intermediate was detected by in-situ DRIFT. In the end, VOxC3H5 reacts with the proton of V-OH-Si bond (Step 3) followed by propylene desorption (Step 4). In combination of TEM and TG analyses, we proposed that propylene and coke formation from VOx-C3H5 occur at the same time, which is in accordance with the references [14], [50], [18].

4. Conclusions
The dispersion of VOx species on the surface of HMS was tuned through variation of V loading. The nature of the active species and mechanistic aspects of PDH over VOx-based HMS catalysts were explored. Monovanadate, low-polyvanadate, polyvanadate and V2O5 cluster were found to be sequentially formed with increasing V loading from 1 wt% to 15 wt%. The dispersion of VOx species influences dramatically their redox and acidic properties. In combination with the catalytic performance, it can be speculated that highly dispersed VOx species showed higher apparent TOF value and stability, and lower propylene space time yield and propylene selectivity. In consideration of these analyses together, VOx species in low-polyvanadate form are deemed to be more active and stable in PDH, which also possesses excellent regeneration stability. The rate-limiting step in the course of PDH was established by H2 formation. In-situ DRIFTS results suggest that VOx-C3H5 species is an important intermediate which was observed both in propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation. Its further conversion brings about the formation of gas-phase propylene or coke. The present work provides an excellent candidate for PDH, and it will promote the understanding of VOx species for propane activation.
