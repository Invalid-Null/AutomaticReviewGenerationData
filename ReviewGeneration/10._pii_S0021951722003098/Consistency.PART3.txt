I carefully compared the answers provided in each file to the correct answers for each question. I calculated the consistency ratio by determining how similar the provided answer was to the correct one. A consistency ratio of 100% indicates the provided answer was identical or nearly identical to the correct answer. Lower percentages indicate more divergence from the correct answer.
