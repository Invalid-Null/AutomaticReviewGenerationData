          [1] "Vanadium was introduced to hexagonal mesoporous SiO2 (HMS) to prepare supported vanadium-based catalysts (V-HMS)."
        
          [2] "High amounts of vanadium could be well dispersed as VOx on the surface of HMS, and propylene yield was 1.2 times higher in comparison with SBA-15-based sample [26]."

         Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies the effect of varying vanadium loading on HMS silica supports from 0.12 to 15.08 V atoms/nm2. It states that high amounts of vanadium could be well dispersed on HMS, with higher propylene yield compared to SBA-15 supports.

          [1] "In-situ DRIFTS results suggest that VOx-C3H5 species is an important intermediate which was observed both in propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation."
        
          [2] "Based on temporal analysis of products, H2 formation is determined as the rate-limiting step in the PDH reaction over V-HMS."
       </Quotes>
      <English>
         Yes, the article utilizes in-situ DRIFTS characterization to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It identifies a VOx-C3H5 intermediate species during PDH and propylene hydrogenation reactions over VOx/HMS catalysts. It also uses temporal analysis of products to determine that H2 formation is the rate-limiting step.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         是的,该文献利用原位DRIFTS表征技术来研究工作中的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它在VOx/HMS催化剂上的丙烷脱氢反应和丙烯加氢反应中识别出了一个VOx-C3H5中间体物种。它还使用了产物瞬时分析技术来确定H2的形成是速率控制步骤。
