 Unfortunately this literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the questions asked. The article is focused on the nature of VOx structures in propane dehydrogenation catalysts and does not discuss process intensification approaches, techno-economic factors, safety issues, remaining challenges, computational methods, characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures. Since there are no relevant quotes, I will respond to each question directly:
