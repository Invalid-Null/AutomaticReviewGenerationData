 Unfortunately this article does not evaluate any specific metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation besides the Ga-doped ZrO2 that was synthesized and studied here. It does not provide insights into how properties like oxidation state, oxygen mobility, acid-base properties, metal particle size/shape, support effects etc. influence the performance of various catalysts for this reaction.

The article focuses solely on investigating a series of Ga-doped ZrO2 catalysts. The main findings are:

[1] "It is reported that the process of propane dehydrogenation over bare Al2O3 undergoes two mechanisms, i.e., stepwise and concerted mechanisms."

[2] "In comparison, the PDH reaction coordinate over m-ZrO2 is also displayed in Figure 5 because the crystallite size of prepared m-ZrO2 is very large (17.4 nm); the stoichiometric surface of m-ZrO2 is used for calculation." 

[3] "Stepwise and concerted pathways were compared for PDH over m-ZrO2. Figure S17 shows that the reaction barrier of CH bond activation in the concerted pathway is larger than that of the stepwise pathway (2.34 vs 1.60 eV), indicating that m-ZrO2 prefers to catalyze propane into propene via the stepwise pathway."

[4] "Against this background, we aimed to prove the application potential of promoting ZrO2 with Ga2O3 to form solid solutions of GaZrOx, which may show good catalytic performance in PDH."

[5] "It is worth noting that the formation of the GaH intermediate is proved by the in situ DRIFTS experiment."  

[6] "Next, we consider the concerted pathway. Propane is first adsorbed on the surface with a Gads of 0.97 eV; subsequently, two CH bonds in the adsorbed propane are simultaneously cleaved, resulting in adsorbed propene, and two H atoms bonded to Ga and O (D2; Figures 5 and S16)."

3. The article proposes that propane dehydrogenation over monoclinic ZrO2 occurs via a stepwise mechanism, where the two C-H bonds are cleaved sequentially. In contrast, over Ga-doped ZrO2 the reaction occurs via a concerted mechanism where both C-H bonds are cleaved simultaneously. This is supported by DFT calculations and the observation of Ga-H intermediates during reaction.

3. 本文提出单斜ZrO2上的丙烷脱氢发生分步机制,其中两个碳氢键顺序断裂。相比之下,在Ga掺杂的ZrO2上,反应通过同时断裂两个碳氢键的协同机制发生。这是DFT计算和反应过程中观察到Ga-H中间产物所支持的。
