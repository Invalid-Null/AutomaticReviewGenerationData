[1] Catalysts play a significant role in selective CH bond activation and regulating reaction pathways for improving activity and propene selectivity in PDH. 

[2] It is reported that Pd, Rh, and Ir also show high intrinsic activity for CH bond activation in propane; however, these catalysts are still expensive.

</quotes>

<English version answer> 

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing active sites that can selectively activate C-H bonds and steer the reaction along desired pathways, thereby improving activity and propylene selectivity. Examples of metal catalysts like Pd, Rh, and Ir that can activate C-H bonds are mentioned, but they are expensive. No specific mechanisms of catalyst activity are described.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

[1] The mechanism of the PDH reaction over GaZrOx was further investigated by DFT calculations at a molecular level.

[2] DFT calculations indicate that the active site consists of two coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy (Zrcus-Zrcus) and is responsible for the homolytic CH bond dissociation.

5. The article briefly mentions that DFT calculations were used to investigate the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation over GaZrOx catalysts at the molecular level. It also states that DFT calculations identified coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites at oxygen vacancies as active sites responsible for homolytic C-H bond dissociation over ZrO2. However, no specific computational insights into mechanisms or pathways from DFT are provided.

1. The article does not provide specific background information on the importance and applications of propylene production through propane dehydrogenation. It mentions propane dehydrogenation as an on-purpose propylene production route but does not elaborate further.

2. The article explains that catalysts can facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy barrier. It describes how gallium incorporation in zirconia catalysts enables a concerted dehydrogenation mechanism with simultaneous breaking of C-H bonds, compared to a stepwise mechanism on bare zirconia. 

3. The article briefly introduces some catalysts explored for propane dehydrogenation, including metals, metal oxides, and zeolites. It mentions Pt/alumina, chromia, and zeolite catalysts used in industry, as well as alternative metal oxides like zirconia. No specific examples are provided.

4. The article does not provide details on thermodynamic constraints or quantitative kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. It only presents apparent activation energies measured for zirconia and gallium-doped zirconia catalysts.

5. The article describes DFT calculations applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways over zirconia and gallium-doped zirconia surfaces. The computations reveal a lower energy concerted pathway enabled by gallium incorporation. 

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics. No rate equations, parameters, or kinetic models are discussed.

7. The article does not describe computational or experimental work to identify catalyst descriptors and structure-activity relationships for propane dehydrogenation performance.
