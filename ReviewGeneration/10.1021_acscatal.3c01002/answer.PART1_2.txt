[1] "DFT calculations indicate that the introduction of Ga into the framework of ZrO2 alters the CH bond activation pathway from a stepwise mechanism to a concerted mechanism involving simultaneous cleavage of two CH bonds in propane." 

[2] "In comparison, the PDH reaction coordinate over m-ZrO2 is also displayed in Figure 5 because the crystallite size of prepared m-ZrO2 is very large (17.4 nm); the stoichiometric surface of m-ZrO2 is used for calculation."

[3] "Figure 5 shows that t-GaZrOx(101) exhibits a lower apparent reaction barrier than that of m-ZrO2(111) (2.26 vs 2.4 eV), which is consistent with measured activation energies of m-ZrO2 and GaZrOx (166 vs 120 kJ/mol-1), indicating that GaZrOx exhibits higher intrinsic activity toward propene formation."

3. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied ZrO2 and Ga-doped ZrO2 catalysts based on DFT calculations. It shows that introducing Ga changes the mechanism from stepwise over ZrO2 to concerted over Ga-ZrOx, involving simultaneous cleavage of two CH bonds. This results in a lower barrier and higher intrinsic activity for Ga-ZrOx.

3. 是的,这篇文章基于DFT计算提出了在所研究的ZrO2和Ga掺杂ZrO2催化剂上丙烷脱氢的反应机理。它表明Ga的引入将ZrO2上的机理从步进改变为Ga-ZrOx上的共振机理,涉及同时断裂两个CH键。这导致Ga-ZrOx具有更低的势垒和更高的内在活性。
