[1] "In situ DRIFTS spectra of ZrO2 and GaZrOx-0.2 were recorded after different times of PDH at 550 C."

[2] "In situ DRIFTS, which is a powerful technique to monitor reaction intermediates and to elucidate the reaction mechanism in heterogeneous catalysis, is applied in this work."

[3] "In situ DRIFTS spectra of ZrO2 and GaZrOx-0.2 catalysts were selected for characterization." 

[4] "A signal at 1988 cm−1 could be observed in the spectrum of GaZrOx after reduction in H2. It can be related to the combined effect of Ga incorporation and H2 reduction pretreatment, which enables us to conclude that the peak could be GaH species."
