[1] Catalysts play a significant role in selective CH bond activation and regulating reaction pathways for improving activity and propene selectivity in PDH. 

[2] It is reported that Pd, Rh, and Ir also show high intrinsic activity for CH bond activation in propane; however, these catalysts are still expensive.

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing active sites that can selectively activate C-H bonds and steer the reaction along desired pathways, thereby improving activity and propylene selectivity. Examples of metal catalysts like Pd, Rh, and Ir that can activate C-H bonds are mentioned, but they are expensive. No specific mechanisms of catalyst activity are described.

[1] The mechanism of the PDH reaction over GaZrOx was further investigated by DFT calculations at a molecular level.

[2] DFT calculations indicate that the active site consists of two coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy (Zrcus-Zrcus) and is responsible for the homolytic CH bond dissociation.

5. The article briefly mentions that DFT calculations were used to investigate the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation over GaZrOx catalysts at the molecular level. It also states that DFT calculations identified coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites at oxygen vacancies as active sites responsible for homolytic C-H bond dissociation over ZrO2. However, no specific computational insights into mechanisms or pathways from DFT are provided.
