 Unfortunately this article does not evaluate any specific metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation besides the Ga-doped ZrO2 that was synthesized and studied here. It does not provide insights into how properties like oxidation state, oxygen mobility, acid-base properties, metal particle size/shape, support effects etc. influence the performance of various catalysts for this reaction.

The article focuses solely on investigating a series of Ga-doped ZrO2 catalysts. The main findings are:

<quotes>
[1] "It is reported that the process of propane dehydrogenation over bare Al2O3 undergoes two mechanisms, i.e., stepwise and concerted mechanisms."

[2] "In comparison, the PDH reaction coordinate over m-ZrO2 is also displayed in Figure 5 because the crystallite size of prepared m-ZrO2 is very large (17.4 nm); the stoichiometric surface of m-ZrO2 is used for calculation." 

[3] "Stepwise and concerted pathways were compared for PDH over m-ZrO2. Figure S17 shows that the reaction barrier of CH bond activation in the concerted pathway is larger than that of the stepwise pathway (2.34 vs 1.60 eV), indicating that m-ZrO2 prefers to catalyze propane into propene via the stepwise pathway."

[4] "Against this background, we aimed to prove the application potential of promoting ZrO2 with Ga2O3 to form solid solutions of GaZrOx, which may show good catalytic performance in PDH."

[5] "It is worth noting that the formation of the GaH intermediate is proved by the in situ DRIFTS experiment."  

[6] "Next, we consider the concerted pathway. Propane is first adsorbed on the surface with a Gads of 0.97 eV; subsequently, two CH bonds in the adsorbed propane are simultaneously cleaved, resulting in adsorbed propene, and two H atoms bonded to Ga and O (D2; Figures 5 and S16)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>  
3. The article proposes that propane dehydrogenation over monoclinic ZrO2 occurs via a stepwise mechanism, where the two C-H bonds are cleaved sequentially. In contrast, over Ga-doped ZrO2 the reaction occurs via a concerted mechanism where both C-H bonds are cleaved simultaneously. This is supported by DFT calculations and the observation of Ga-H intermediates during reaction.

3. 本文提出单斜ZrO2上的丙烷脱氢发生分步机制,其中两个碳氢键顺序断裂。相比之下,在Ga掺杂的ZrO2上,反应通过同时断裂两个碳氢键的协同机制发生。这是DFT计算和反应过程中观察到Ga-H中间产物所支持的。

[1] "DFT calculations indicate that the introduction of Ga into the framework of ZrO2 alters the CH bond activation pathway from a stepwise mechanism to a concerted mechanism involving simultaneous cleavage of two CH bonds in propane." 

[2] "In comparison, the PDH reaction coordinate over m-ZrO2 is also displayed in Figure 5 because the crystallite size of prepared m-ZrO2 is very large (17.4 nm); the stoichiometric surface of m-ZrO2 is used for calculation."

[3] "Figure 5 shows that t-GaZrOx(101) exhibits a lower apparent reaction barrier than that of m-ZrO2(111) (2.26 vs 2.4 eV), which is consistent with measured activation energies of m-ZrO2 and GaZrOx (166 vs 120 kJ/mol-1), indicating that GaZrOx exhibits higher intrinsic activity toward propene formation."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied ZrO2 and Ga-doped ZrO2 catalysts based on DFT calculations. It shows that introducing Ga changes the mechanism from stepwise over ZrO2 to concerted over Ga-ZrOx, involving simultaneous cleavage of two CH bonds. This results in a lower barrier and higher intrinsic activity for Ga-ZrOx.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

3. 是的,这篇文章基于DFT计算提出了在所研究的ZrO2和Ga掺杂ZrO2催化剂上丙烷脱氢的反应机理。它表明Ga的引入将ZrO2上的机理从步进改变为Ga-ZrOx上的共振机理,涉及同时断裂两个CH键。这导致Ga-ZrOx具有更低的势垒和更高的内在活性。

[1] DFT calculations indicate that the introduction of Ga into the framework of ZrO2 alters the CH bond activation pathway from a stepwise mechanism to a concerted mechanism involving simultaneous cleavage of two CH bonds in propane, leading to a superior CH bond activation ability and a lower reaction barrier than state-of-the-art metal oxide catalysts.

[2] We compared the Gads of iso-C3H7 and H over different adsorption sites and established that the adsorption of propane on the GaO2cI site (C2) requires the lowest energy (1.19 eV, Table S7). The first methylene CH activation barrier is calculated to be 0.97 eV. 

[3] Subsequently, two CH bonds in the adsorbed propane are simultaneously cleaved, resulting in adsorbed propene, and two H atoms bonded to Ga and O (D2; Figures 5 and S16). It is worth noting that the formation of the GaH intermediate is proved by the in situ DRIFTS experiment. The reaction barrier is determined to be 1.5 eV, which is much lower than that of the stepwise mechanism (1.50 vs 2.65 eV).

3. Yes, the article proposes a concerted mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over Ga-doped ZrO2 catalysts based on DFT calculations. It shows that Ga incorporation enables simultaneous cleavage of two C-H bonds in propane with lower barriers compared to stepwise C-H activation over monoclinic ZrO2. Key steps involve propane adsorption, concerted C-H activation, and Ga-H intermediate formation. The active site is identified as GaOZrO.
