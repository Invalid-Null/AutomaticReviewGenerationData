[1] "In order to give a deeper understanding of the active site structure and the reaction mechanism, in situ DRIFTS, which is a powerful technique to monitor reaction intermediates and to elucidate the reaction mechanism in heterogeneous catalysis, (46) is applied in this work."

[2] "Representative m-ZrO2 and GaZrOx-0.2 catalysts were selected for characterization by in situ DRIFT. The catalysts were pretreated under the same condition as before catalytic tests to ensure the same catalyst." 

[3] "Figure 4a compares the DRIFTS spectra of ZrO2 and GaZrOx-0.2 after a series of pretreatments including heating to reaction temperature, oxidation, and reduction."

[4] "In addition, in situ DRIFTS spectra of ZrO2 and GaZrOx-0.2 were recorded after different times of PDH at 550 C. As the band at 1988 cm−1 appeared, we put forward that GaH species were formed in the course of the PDH reaction, inspiring us to conclude that Ga atoms participate in the PDH reaction process (Figure 4f)."

4. Yes, the article utilizes in situ DRIFTS to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it compares the spectra of ZrO2 and Ga-doped ZrO2 (GaZrOx-0.2) after pretreatments like heating, oxidation, and reduction. It also records spectra after different times during propane dehydrogenation at 550°C. This revealed a peak at 1988 cm-1 assigned to GaH species, indicating gallium atoms participate in the reaction.

4. 是的,本文利用了原位DRIFTS技术来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。具体来说,它比较了在加热、氧化和还原等预处理后的ZrO2和掺钪ZrO2(GaZrOx-0.2)的光谱。它还在550°C下不同的丙烷脱氢反应时间记录了光谱。这揭示了一个位于1988 cm-1的峰,归因于GaH物种,表明钙原子参与了反应。
