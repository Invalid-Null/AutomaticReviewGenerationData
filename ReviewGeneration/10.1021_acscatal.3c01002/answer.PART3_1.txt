[1] "The binding energies of Zr 3d3/2 and Zr 3d5/2 decrease with an increase in the Ga/Zr ratio, while the binding energy of Ga 2p3/2 increases (Figure S10)." 

[2] "These changes indicate electron transfer from Ga to the Zr atom, resulting in electron richness around the Zr atom."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
6. Yes, the article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. XPS revealed a decrease in Zr 3d binding energies and an increase in Ga 2p binding energy with increasing Ga doping, indicating electron transfer from Ga to Zr atoms.
</English version answer>
