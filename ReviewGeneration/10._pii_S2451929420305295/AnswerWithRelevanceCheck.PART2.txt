         [1] "we report a single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn intermetallic alloys, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C."
         [2] "Comparatively, for the PtSn/Al2O3 reference catalyst, propane conversion dramatically dropped from an initial 34.8% to 11.7% after 100 h."

         Answer: Yes, the article evaluates PtZn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that the single-site [PtZn4] catalyst achieved over 95% propylene selectivity over 520-620C and high stability, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 which showed significant deactivation after 100 hours.

         [1] "we reveal that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke side reactions." 
         [2] "Although their geometric structures were similar to that of [PtM4] (M = Zn, Fe, Co, Ni) ensembles, where Pt atom is isolated by 4 neighboring M atoms on the surface of Pt1M1 IMAs, the electronic states significantly varied."

      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Zn in the PtZn alloy catalysts. It shows the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles promotes propylene desorption and stability compared to [PtM4] with M=Fe, Co, Ni, attributed to differences in electronic state.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         答:是的,该文研究了PtZn合金催化剂中次要金属Zn的电子和几何效应。它显示[PtZn4]集合中几何隔离和富电子的Pt促进了丙烯的脱附和稳定性,与[PtM4](M=Fe, Co, Ni)相比,这是由于电子态的差异所致。

         [1] "Therefore, the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs may be the key active site structures for PDH to propylene. The induced geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles could weaken the propylene adsorption and inhibit the structure-sensitive further dehydrogenation of propylene, leading to increased propylene selectivity and stability."
         [2] "The isolated Pt atom in [PtM4] ensembles is active for propane activation, but the neighboring coordination atoms significantly influence the electronic states of isolated Pt atom, wherein electron-richer single-atom Pt1 site in [PtZn4] coordination ensembles accounts for higher propylene selectivity."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article describes synergistic effects between Pt and Zn metals in the PtZn alloy catalysts, attributed to ensemble and ligand effects. It shows the [PtZn4] surface ensembles isolate the Pt active sites and alter the electronic state through ligand effects, weakening propylene adsorption and inhibiting over-dehydrogenation to improve selectivity.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         答:是的,该文描述了PtZn合金催化剂中Pt和Zn金属之间的协同效应,这是由于集合效应和配体效应。它展示了[PtZn4]表面配合体隔离了Pt活性位点,并通过配体效应改变了电子态,削弱了丙烯吸附并抑制了过度脱氢以提高选择性。
