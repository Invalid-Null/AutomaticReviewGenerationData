<quotes>
[1] "Consequently, SiO2-supported PtZn IMAs showed ascendant temperature tolerance ranging from 520C to 620C, enabling over 95% selectivity of C3H6 (Figure 2B), indicating superior selectivity of this PtZn IMA during the wide range of HTs."

[2] "Additionally, the crystalline structure of PtZn alloys is almost unchanged even after long-term stability tests (Figure S34)."

[3] "Therefore, PtZn supported on SiO2 exhibited better both propane conversion and propylene selectivity than Al2O3 (Figure S15), despite the similar sizes of PtZn particles (Figure S16)." 

</quotes>

<English version answer>
2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates PtZn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that SiO2-supported PtZn intermetallic alloy (IMA) catalysts exhibit over 95% propylene selectivity over a wide temperature range of 520-620°C. The PtZn alloy structure remains stable after long-term tests. PtZn/SiO2 also shows better conversion and selectivity than PtZn/Al2O3, attributed to weaker metal-support interactions with SiO2 allowing better PtZn alloy formation.
</English version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "Therefore, the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs may be the key active site structures for PDH to propylene. The induced geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles could weaken the propylene adsorption and inhibit the structure-sensitive further dehydrogenation of propylene, leading to increased propylene selectivity and stability."

[2] "The isolated Pt atom in [PtM4] ensembles is active for propane activation, but the neighboring coordination atoms significantly influence the electronic states of isolated Pt atom, wherein electron-richer single-atom Pt1 site in [PtZn4] coordination ensembles accounts for higher propylene selectivity."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
5. Answer: Yes, the article describes synergistic effects between Pt and Zn metals in the PtZn alloy catalysts, attributed to ensemble and ligand effects. It shows the [PtZn4] surface ensembles isolate the Pt active sites and alter the electronic state through ligand effects, weakening propylene adsorption and inhibiting over-dehydrogenation to improve selectivity.
</English version answer>

5. 答案:是的,该文献描述了PtZn合金催化剂中Pt和Zn金属之间的协同效应,这是由于集合效应和配体效应。它展示了[PtZn4]表面配合体隔离了Pt活性位点,并通过配体效应改变了电子态,削弱了丙烯吸附并抑制了过度脱氢以提高选择性。

[1] "we report a single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn intermetallic alloys, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C."
[2] "Comparatively, for the PtSn/Al2O3 reference catalyst, propane conversion dramatically dropped from an initial 34.8% to 11.7% after 100 h."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates PtZn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that the single-site [PtZn4] catalyst achieved over 95% propylene selectivity over 520-620C and high stability, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 which showed significant deactivation after 100 hours.

[1] "we reveal that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke side reactions."
[2] "Although their geometric structures were similar to that of [PtM4] (M = Zn, Fe, Co, Ni) ensembles, where Pt atom is isolated by 4 neighboring M atoms on the surface of Pt1M1 IMAs, the electronic states significantly varied."  
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Zn in the PtZn alloy catalysts.

[1] "Additionally, to illustrate the unique electronic structures of this [PtZn4] ensemble, we further compared the [PtZn4] ensemble with other [PtM4] ensembles in intermetallic Pt1M1 (M =F e, Co, Ni)." 

[2] "As shown in Figure S42A, although their geometric structures were similar to that of [PtM4] (M = Zn, Fe, Co, Ni) ensembles, where Pt atom is isolated by 4 neighboring M atoms on the surface of Pt1M1 IMAs, the electronic states significantly varied."

[3] "Comparatively, for Pt/SiO2, a more pronounced intensity of coke deposition (283.9 eV) in XPS C 1s peak (Figure S27) than that over PtZn/SiO2 (Figure 3F) was observed."

[4] "Therefore, the above results clearly imply that the electron-rich Pt in PtZn ensembles effectively inhibits the coke formation under PDH reaction conditions."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates PtZn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing PtZn/SiO2 has much higher propylene selectivity (96%) compared to Pt/SiO2 (67%) under propane dehydrogenation conditions. The article also compares PtZn with other PtM (M=Fe, Co, Ni) alloys and shows electron-rich Pt in PtZn is most effective for inhibiting coke formation and improving selectivity.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文评价了PtZn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供了数据显示,在丙烷脱氢反应条件下,PtZn/SiO2 的丙烯选择性(96%)远�于Pt/SiO2 (67%)。本文还将PtZn与其他PtM(M=Fe,Co,Ni)合金进行了比较,结果显示PtZn中电子丰富的Pt最有效抑制炭素生成,提高选择性。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "The calculated charge transfer from the neighboring Zn to Pt (Table S8) further reveals the feature of electron enrichment of site-isolated Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles (Figure 5C), which is beneficial to lower adsorption energy of propylene (Table S9)."

[2] "Consequently, compared with Pt (111) (< 0.1 eV), PtZn (110) IMA shows a larger difference between the third dehydrogenation step and propylene desorption barriers (> 1.0 eV), which leads to a much higher propylene selectivity and less coking favorability (Figures 5E and S48)."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Zn in the PtZn alloy catalyst. It shows through DFT calculations that electron transfer occurs from Zn to Pt in the [PtZn4] ensembles, making the Pt electron-rich. This lowers propylene adsorption energy and increases selectivity. The isolated Pt site geometry also leads to weaker propylene binding compared to multiple Pt sites.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 
答:是的,本文调查了PtZn合金催化剂中第二金属Zn的电子和几何效应。DFT计算显示,在[PtZn4]配位结构中,Zn向Pt发生电子转移,使Pt电子富集。这降低了丙烯的吸附能,提高了选择性。隔离的Pt位点几何结构也导致其与丙烯的结合变弱,比较多Pt位点。

[1] "Additionally, the atomically ordered IMA structure particularly guarantees the superior anti-segregation and anti-sintering resistance."

[2] "The resulting single-site [PtZn4] intermetallic catalysts bring the highest propylene productivity at a lowest deactivation rate under the industrial conditions." 

[3] "These findings provide a promising route to prepare efficient Pt-based bimetal dehydrogenation catalysts by isolating Pt atoms into single-site catalysts via assembling atomically ordered IMAs."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article describes synergistic effects between Pt and Zn metals in the PtZn alloy catalyst, attributed to ensemble and ligand effects. The ordered intermetallic alloy structure provides anti-segregation and anti-sintering resistance. The electron donation from Zn ligands also enhances selectivity on the isolated Pt sites. Overall, the combination of metals in the alloy improves productivity and stability.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文描述了PtZn合金催化剂中Pt和Zn金属之间的协同效应,这归因于配位集合和配体效应。有序的互金属合金结构提供了抗析出和抗烧结的稳定性。Zn配体的电子供体效应也增强了隔离Pt位点的选择性。总体来说,合金中金属的组合提高了产量和稳定性。
