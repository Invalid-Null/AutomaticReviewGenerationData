<quotes>

[1] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,4, 5, 6 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability.7"

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the high activation energy barriers resulting from the highly endothermic nature of the reaction. Specifically, it states that the highly positive enthalpy of 124 kJ/mol necessitates high reaction temperatures, which presents challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability.

[1] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke.8"

[2] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective.9, 10, 11 Isolating the active metal components into the single-atom site and the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions.2,9,12, 13, 14, 15"

4. The article discusses that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze undesired structure-sensitive side reactions like cracking and deep dehydrogenation, producing C1, C2 molecules and coke. It states that isolating active metal components into single atom sites could inhibit these structure-sensitive side reactions.
