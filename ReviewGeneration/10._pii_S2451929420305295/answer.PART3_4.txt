[1] "Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (AC-HAADF-STEM) imaging (Figure 1E and S3) revealed the formation of atomically ordered PtZn IMAs, featuring the alternating bright Pt column and dark Zn column contrast on [110] planes (Figure 1E)."

[2] "The atomic plane distances were measured as 0.286 nm, agreeing with a lattice spacing of intermetallic Pt1Zn1 along with the [110] directions, which implies the highly exposed (110) facets in these PtZn IMAs." 

[3] "At the surface of PtZn (110), the [PtZn4] ensembles (rectangle-framed motif) periodically formed, in which Pt atom was isolated by 4 neighboring Zn atoms, leading to the formation of single-atom Pt1 site."

[1] "In situ XANES spectra (Figure 3A) showed that after H2 reduction, all Pt atoms were in their metallic states, as evidenced by the white line intensity relative to that of the Pt foil."

[2] "In situ XPS was further employed to monitor the electronic states of this PtZn ensembles. After H2 reduction, for PtZn/SiO2, Pt was reduced to metallic Pt0 and the binding energy (BE) of Pt0 in Pt 4f7/2 peak was 71.1 eV (Figures 3D and S24), which was lower than that over Pt/SiO2 (71.3 eV) (Figure S25), indicating the electron transfers from Zn to the 5d band of Pt and formation of electron-rich Pt in PtZn ensembles."
