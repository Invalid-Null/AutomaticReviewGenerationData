[1] "Additionally, to illustrate the unique electronic structures of this [PtZn4] ensemble, we further compared the [PtZn4] ensemble with other [PtM4] ensembles in intermetallic Pt1M1 (M =F e, Co, Ni)." 

[2] "As shown in Figure S42A, although their geometric structures were similar to that of [PtM4] (M = Zn, Fe, Co, Ni) ensembles, where Pt atom is isolated by 4 neighboring M atoms on the surface of Pt1M1 IMAs, the electronic states significantly varied."

[3] "Comparatively, for Pt/SiO2, a more pronounced intensity of coke deposition (283.9 eV) in XPS C 1s peak (Figure S27) than that over PtZn/SiO2 (Figure 3F) was observed."

[4] "Therefore, the above results clearly imply that the electron-rich Pt in PtZn ensembles effectively inhibits the coke formation under PDH reaction conditions."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates PtZn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing PtZn/SiO2 has much higher propylene selectivity (96%) compared to Pt/SiO2 (67%) under propane dehydrogenation conditions. The article also compares PtZn with other PtM (M=Fe, Co, Ni) alloys and shows electron-rich Pt in PtZn is most effective for inhibiting coke formation and improving selectivity.

[1] "The calculated charge transfer from the neighboring Zn to Pt (Table S8) further reveals the feature of electron enrichment of site-isolated Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles (Figure 5C), which is beneficial to lower adsorption energy of propylene (Table S9)."

[2] "Consequently, compared with Pt (111) (< 0.1 eV), PtZn (110) IMA shows a larger difference between the third dehydrogenation step and propylene desorption barriers (> 1.0 eV), which leads to a much higher propylene selectivity and less coking favorability (Figures 5E and S48)."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Zn in the PtZn alloy catalyst. It shows through DFT calculations that electron transfer occurs from Zn to Pt in the [PtZn4] ensembles, making the Pt electron-rich. This lowers propylene adsorption energy and increases selectivity. The isolated Pt site geometry also leads to weaker propylene binding compared to multiple Pt sites.

答:是的,本文调查了PtZn合金催化剂中第二金属Zn的电子和几何效应。DFT计算显示,在[PtZn4]配位结构中,Zn向Pt发生电子转移,使Pt电子富集。这降低了丙烯的吸附能,提高了选择性。隔离的Pt位点几何结构也导致其与丙烯的结合变弱,比较多Pt位点。

[1] "Additionally, the atomically ordered IMA structure particularly guarantees the superior anti-segregation and anti-sintering resistance."

[2] "The resulting single-site [PtZn4] intermetallic catalysts bring the highest propylene productivity at a lowest deactivation rate under the industrial conditions." 

[3] "These findings provide a promising route to prepare efficient Pt-based bimetal dehydrogenation catalysts by isolating Pt atoms into single-site catalysts via assembling atomically ordered IMAs."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article describes synergistic effects between Pt and Zn metals in the PtZn alloy catalyst, attributed to ensemble and ligand effects. The ordered intermetallic alloy structure provides anti-segregation and anti-sintering resistance. The electron donation from Zn ligands also enhances selectivity on the isolated Pt sites. Overall, the combination of metals in the alloy improves productivity and stability.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文描述了PtZn合金催化剂中Pt和Zn金属之间的协同效应,这归因于配位集合和配体效应。有序的互金属合金结构提供了抗析出和抗烧结的稳定性。Zn配体的电子供体效应也增强了隔离Pt位点的选择性。总体来说,合金中金属的组合提高了产量和稳定性。
