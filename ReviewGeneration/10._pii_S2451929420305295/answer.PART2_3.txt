<quotes>
[1] "we report a single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn intermetallic alloys, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C."
[2] "Comparatively, for the PtSn/Al2O3 reference catalyst, propane conversion dramatically dropped from an initial 34.8% to 11.7% after 100 h."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates PtZn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that the single-site [PtZn4] catalyst achieved over 95% propylene selectivity over 520-620C and high stability, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 which showed significant deactivation after 100 hours.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章评估了PtZn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它显示单位址[PtZn4]催化剂在520-620°C实现了95%以上的丙烯选择性和高稳定性,优于PtSn/Al2O3,后者在100小时后表现出明显的失活。

<quotes>
[1] "we reveal that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke side reactions."
[2] "Although their geometric structures were similar to that of [PtM4] (M = Zn, Fe, Co, Ni) ensembles, where Pt atom is isolated by 4 neighboring M atoms on the surface of Pt1M1 IMAs, the electronic states significantly varied."  
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Zn in the PtZn alloy catalysts. It shows the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles promotes propylene desorption and stability compared to [PtM4] with M=Fe, Co, Ni, attributed to differences in electronic state.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章研究了PtZn合金催化剂中次要金属Zn的电子和几何效应。它显示[PtZn4]集合中几何隔离和富电子的Pt促进了丙烯的脱附和稳定性,与[PtM4](M=Fe, Co, Ni)相比,这是由于电子态的差异所致。

<quotes>
[1] "The induced geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles could weaken the propylene adsorption and inhibit the structure-sensitive further dehydrogenation of propylene, leading to increased propylene selectivity and stability."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article describes synergistic effects between Pt and Zn metals in the PtZn alloy catalysts, attributed to ensemble and electronic effects. Specifically, it shows the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles leads to weaker propylene adsorption and improved selectivity and stability.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 
答:是的,文章描述了PtZn合金催化剂中Pt和Zn金属之间的协同效应,这是由于集合和电子效应。具体来说,它表明[PtZn4]集合中几何隔离和富电子的Pt导致更弱的丙烯吸附和改善的选择性和稳定性。
