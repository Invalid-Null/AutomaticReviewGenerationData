 Unfortunately, the given literature does not contain information relevant to answering the questions about propane dehydrogenation and propylene production. The literature is a scientific article titled "Mercury Export to the Arctic Ocean from the Mackenzie River, Canada" and focuses on research related to mercury concentrations and export from the Mackenzie River in northern Canada.

Since there is no relevant information in the literature to answer the questions, my response is:
