 Unfortunately, the given literature does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It also does not investigate how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. The literature does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts, nor does it explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. 

Furthermore, the literature does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation, or investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts. It does not propose mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts.

In summary, this literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the given questions about propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The article is focused on characterizing copper oxide catalysts for cyclohexane oxidative dehydrogenation instead.
