Evidence for Copper Dimers in Low-Loaded CuOx/SiO2 Catalysts for Cyclohexane Oxidative Dehydrogenation
Abstract
Copper oxide catalysts supported on KIT-6 silica were evaluated for cyclohexane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) to determine the effects of copper oxide domain size on ODH activity and selectivity. The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of KIT-6 at copper surface densities spanning 0.010.7 Cu/nm2 with carefully controlled drying and calcination conditions to systematically vary the average local copper oxide domain size. A distinct copper oxide active site exhibiting an order of magnitude higher activity than large copper oxide domains was identified by model cyclohexane ODH studies coupled with in situ X-ray absorption and UVvisible spectroscopies during reduction in H2. The structure of this site is experimentally identified by a combination of extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, resonant Raman studies, and modeling by density functional theory. All constraints imposed by these techniques indicate the active site is a mono(μ-oxo)dicopper(II) structure with copper sited in 4-member rings formed by copper insertion into highly strained 3-member siloxane ring defects which form on dehydrated silica. Given the ubiquity of copper oxide sites in selective oxidation catalysis, the understanding of such structures may prove relevant for other oxidation reactions.

A major goal in heterogeneous catalysis is to develop structurefunction relationships linking structural features of the catalytically active site to reactivity metrics such as activity and selectivity. Some reactions, such as olefin hydrogenation, only require an accessible metal site and are insensitive to structural properties such as particle size. (1) However, many important catalytic reactions are sensitive to the exact structure of the catalytically active site, whether it is a terrace or step site on a metal nanoparticle for alkane hydrogenolysis, (2) an open or closed Sn site geometry for glucose isomerization by Snβ, (3,4) or the chromium-silica binding geometry in the Phillips CrOx/SiO2 catalyst for ethylene polymerization. (5,6) Ethylene polymerization over CrOx/SiO2 is an extreme case of structure sensitivity where it is estimated that only 110% of the metal sites in catalysts prepared by traditional incipient wetness are catalytically active. (5) Understanding the structural requirements of a reaction can assist in the design of synthesis strategies to maximize the fraction of catalytically relevant species for efficient catalyst design. This in turn makes them easier to study, as bulk spectroscopic techniques become useful for probing catalytically relevant species.
Transition metal oxides supported on silica or silicate frameworks form an important class of heterogeneous catalysts active for epoxidation (TS-1), (7) ethylene polymerization (Phillips catalyst), (5,6) propane dehydrogenation, (810) and propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) over VOx/SiO2 catalysts. (11) In particular, oxidic copper species exhibit an interesting ability to activate oxygen in direct methane to methanol conversion over Cu-MOR/MFI (1214) and the oxidation half-cycle in selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 in Cu-CHA (15) due to the unique redox properties of Cu. Redox reactions involving small copper clusters and oxygen are inherently structure sensitive due to O2 being a 4e oxidant, but individual copper atoms typically undergo redox cycles involving only one electron. (16) Understanding how copper clusters activate oxygen for use in selective oxidation reactions is an active area of debate for many reactions. (1620) Alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is one such unresolved case in that it involves a 2e redox cycle, and there is debate whether the reaction is structure sensitive. (11) We have previously disclosed that CuOx/SiO2 exhibits increasing cyclohexane ODH turnover frequency with decreasing Cu cluster size without change in CH abstraction selectivity. (21) The change in activity was correlated with a new, unassigned Cu+ UVvisible absorption band that appeared at low Cu loadings under reducing environments. An outstanding question from this previous work is whether this Cu+ feature implicates a distinct, highly active catalytic site with a large fraction of inactive metal as in the case of CrOx/SiO2 (5,6,22) or if intrinsic Cu site activity varies continuously as a function of copper oxide domain size.
In this paper, we investigate how cyclohexane ODH activity and selectivity change as a function of copper oxide cluster size using CuOx/KIT-6 catalysts varying in surface density from 0.01 to 0.7 Cu/nm2, and we find evidence for a distinct Cu site which is highly active for ODH. We first employ UVvisible spectroscopy and in situ X-ray absorption near edge (XANES) spectroscopy to probe average local copper oxide domain size and Cu2+/Cu+ redox activity as a function of Cu surface density and relate these structural and chemical properties to cyclohexane ODH activity and selectivity. We find that cyclohexane ODH turnover frequency increases continuously with decreasing copper oxide domain size and then plateaus below a critical Cu surface density. In situ UVvisible spectra of the catalysts show a critical change in Cu redox behavior below this critical Cu surface density which points to the existence of a distinct catalytic site for cyclohexane ODH at low Cu loadings. We investigate the Cu active site structure under oxidizing and reducing conditions by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), resonant Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) modeling and find that all evidence is consistent with a mono(μ-oxo)dicopper (CuOCu)2+ structure with one of the Cu atoms exchanged in a silica surface defect site.

2.1. Materials Synthesis
Mesoporous KIT-6 SiO2 was synthesized by a previously published procedure (21,23) using a molar ratio of 195 H2O/1.5 tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS)/1.7 n-butanol/1.83 hydrochloric acid (HCl)/0.017 Pluronic P-123. Briefly, 19.2 g of Pluronic P-123 (Sigma, Mn = 5800 g/mol) and 29 mL (37 wt %) of aqueous HCl (Fisher, ACS grade) were added to 650 mL of DI water and stirred at 310 K for 4 h until complete dissolution of the P-123 structure directing agent. Next, 30 mL of n-butanol (Sigma, 99.0%) was added as a cosolvent and stirred for 1 h. Then, 64.3 g of TEOS (Sigma, 99.0%) was added, and the mixture was stirred for an additional 24 h. The mixture was aged at 373 K for 24 h under reflux without stirring. Excess structure directing agent was removed by suspending the precipitate in 500 mL of 0.1 M HCl in ethanol for 2 h. The precipitate was then filtered and washed with 300 mL of ethanol followed by 750 mL of DI water. The resulting powder was dried at 373 K for 16 h before calcining at 823 K for 4 h with a 5 K/min ramp rate under static conditions before use. The KIT-6 Ia3d structure was confirmed using powder X-ray diffraction by the characteristic (220) reflection in Figure S1.
Copper oxide catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with careful drying and calcination procedures before and after impregnation. Before impregnation, KIT-6 was dried under vacuum at 473 K for 16 h to remove all water and partially dehydroxylate the surface. Catalysts were then impregnated to incipient wetness using aqueous copper nitrate trihydrate (Strem, 99.5%), with Cu2+ molarity adjusted to achieve the desired copper loading at incipient wetness. After impregnation, catalysts were dried for 4 h in air to remove bulk water from the pores followed by drying for 16 h at 293 K under dynamic vacuum. The dried materials were then calcined at 823 K for 4 h with a 10 K/min ramp rate. Two CuOx/KIT-6 series with different copper loadings were prepared this way. The first batch was stored in a desiccator and used for H2-XANES linear combination fitting but was subsequently exposed to moist air and hydrolyzed over a period of several months. The second CuOx/KIT-6 series was dried at 293 K under vacuum after calcination before storing under N2 to prevent hydrolysis of the active copper structures, and it was used for all other experiments.
2.2. Catalyst Characterization
Nitrogen physisorption isotherms were collected using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument. Prior to physisorption measurements, samples were dried at 423 K under dynamic vacuum for 612 h until pressure stabilized below 5 × 106 bar. The BET method was used to calculate surface area from N2 adsorption isotherms. Metal content was determined using ICP-OES (Thermo iCAP 7600) calibrated with Cu standards of known concentration. Samples were digested with 28.9 M HF and then diluted with 0.14 M aqueous HNO3 prior to analysis. Small angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected over 13 2θ in reflection mode using a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, and wide angle XRD patterns were collected over 2080 2θ in transmission mode using a STOE STADI MP diffractometer with Cu Kα1 radiation.
Diffuse reflectance UVvisible spectra were collected on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer equipped with a Harrick Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance accessory and reaction cell for in situ measurements. Polytetrafluoroethylene was used as the baseline white light standard, and reflectance data were transformed to pseudoabsorbance units using the KubelkaMunk transform, F(R), using KIT-6 as the reference.

A Savitzky-Golay filter with polynomial degree 2 and 11 point frame is applied to all pseudoabsorbance spectra to increase the signal-to-noise ratio at the expense of minor signal distortion. Absorption edge energies are estimated from the x-intercept of a linear fit of the rising absorption edge in a plot of (F(R)hν)2 vs hν where the exponent is due to the assumption that the copper oxide species exhibit a direct band gap similar to bulk copper oxide.
Cu K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was performed at sector 5 of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, on the DuPont-Northwestern-Dow Collaborative Access Team (DND-CAT) bending magnet D beamline using a Si(111) double crystal monochromator with resolution ΔE/E  1.3 × 104. Copper standards and CuOx/KIT-6 catalysts with 0.1 Cu/nm2 were measured in transmission mode with Canberra ionization chambers, while CuOx/KIT-6 catalysts with <0.1 Cu/nm2 were measured in fluorescence mode using four-channel SII Vortex-ME4 detectors. Energies were calibrated in transmission mode against a Cu foil, setting the first inflection point at the known Cu edge energy of 8979 eV. Catalysts were dried under flowing O2/N2 at 393 K for 15 min and cooled to 323 K before collecting X-ray absorption spectra. X-ray fluorescence self-absorption tests were conducted by comparing the white line of 0.05 Cu/nm2 catalyst successively diluted in boron nitride (Figure S2), and catalysts were diluted as appropriate to prevent distortion due to self-absorption when measuring in fluorescence mode. Spectra were normalized in Athena (24) for comparison of X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra. The speciation of copper in each oxidation state was determined by linear combination fitting each spectrum to silica supported Cu materials in the pure 2+, 1+, and 0 oxidation states. The pure states were verified by linear combination fitting the XANES for the supported standards to Cu foil, Cu2O, and CuO standards.
The kn-weighted χ(k) function was computed in Athena and background removed using the AUTOBK algorithm for extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. The Fourier transform was computed over the range k  [2.8, 11.612.2] Å1 using a Hann window function with width dk = 0.5 A1. The many-body amplitude reduction factor, S02, was determined by fitting Cu foil and CuO reference standards as in Figure S3. Scattering amplitude, phase shift, and electron mean-free-path functions for CuO, CuCu, and CuSi scattering paths were generated by FEFF6 (25,26) using atomic coordinates from the geometry optimized four coordinate mono(μ-oxo) copper dimer DFT model described below. All figures display k2-weighted χ-functions, but fitting and error estimates were calculated using k1-, k2-, and k3-weighted data.
The excitation wavelength of 250 nm for mid-UV resonant Raman measurements was provided by the third harmonic generation output of 750 nm laser line from a 4 kHz repetition rate, nanosecond pulsed, wavelength-tunable Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent, Indigo-S). The excitation wavelength of 325 nm for near-UV resonant Raman measurements was provided from a heliumcadmium laser (Kimmon Koha, Model IK3401R-F). The excitation wavelength of 458 nm for visible nonresonant Raman measurements was provided by a wavelength-tunable argon ion laser (Melles Griot, Model 543-AP). Collimated laser light was focused on the sample; then, the scattered light from the sample was refocused by using a 90 off-axis ellipsoidal reflector with backscattering geometry onto a triple-grating spectrometer (Princeton Instruments, Trivista 555) where Rayleigh light is filtered out and stray light is significantly suppressed. (27) The Raman signal was collected using a liquid N2-cooled UV-enhanced CCD detector (Princeton Instruments, SPEC-10).
To mitigate the risks of laser-induced Raman spectral change, all Raman spectra were obtained in flowing helium (100 mL/min) at room temperature in a fluidized bed cell which combines the use of a shaker and helium gas as a heat sink due to its high thermal conductivity. (27) Low laser powers were delivered on the sample (<3 mW at 458 nm, <2 mW at 325 nm, <1.5 mW at 250 nm) to avoid laser-induced degradation of the catalysts during Raman measurements. We observed reproducible Raman spectra for all catalysts with different Cu loadings which indicates that no laser-induced sample damage was present at our measurement conditions. Cyclohexane, chloroform, and air were used as frequency standards for calibration of Raman shifts. The accuracy of the Raman shifts is estimated as 1 cm1.
2.3. Catalytic Testing
Catalytic measurements were conducted in a packed-bed quartz microreactor using 45330 mg of catalyst diluted with SiO2 quartz. He (Airgas, 99.999%) and O2 (Airgas, 99.999%) flows were supplied by mass flow controllers while cyclohexane (Sigma, 99.9%) was supplied by bubbling He through a saturator with fixed pressure and temperature to achieve a known molar flow rate. All lines were heated to 373 K to prevent condensation of vapors. Catalysts were dried at 573 K for 0.5 h in a 20% O2/He stream before reactions. Contact time experiments were conducted at 573 K and atmospheric pressure using a fixed cyclohexane/O2/He molar ratio of 2:4:94 and total flow rates of 14.582 μmol/s. The identity and concentrations of reactants and products were analyzed using a gas-chromatograph (Agilent GC 6890) equipped with an HP-Innowax column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.5 μm) attached to a flame ionization detector (FID) in parallel with HP-Plot/Q (30 m x 0.53 mm x 40 μm) and HP-Molesieve (15 m × 0.53 mm × 50 μm) columns connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
All calculations of product yield, turnover frequency, and selectivity are conducted on a per C6 basis such that concentrations of CO and CO2 are divided by 6 before further calculations are performed. Steady state oxidative dehydrogenation turnover frequencies are determined from the slope of the differential region of product yield vs catalyst contact time after initial deactivation based on solving the mass balance for a packed bed reactor. Contact time and product yield are expressed in terms of mols of copper and product (on a C6 basis) so that turnover frequencies are normalized on a per copper basis. Initial C6 selectivity is determined by extrapolating product yields to zero contact time. For runs with sufficient cyclohexane conversion to give an accurate value, the carbon balance exceeds 95%.
2.4. DFT Calculations
Energy calculations, geometry optimizations, and vibrational analyses were performed using DFT as implemented in the Gaussian 16, Rev. A.03 program. (28) The TPSSh hybrid meta-generalized gradient approximation density functional (29) was used in this work based on prior benchmark studies, (30,31) with particular emphasis on its ability to accurately capture the geometries of first-row transition metal complexes. (30) The elements H and O were treated with the def2-SVP basis set, while Si and Cu were treated with the def2-TZVP basis set. (32) All Cu(II) dimers were modeled in the triplet state, and all Cu(I) structures were modeled as (closed-shell) singlets. Unless otherwise stated, all atoms were allowed to relax during geometry optimizations, after which the framework terminating H atoms were fixed in place for vibrational analyses to model the rigidity of the bulk silica framework. Vibrational analyses were performed on the partially constrained structures, which were confirmed to be local minima by the lack of imaginary frequencies. Gibbs free energies were calculated at 573 K and 1 bar, with all gas-phase species treated using ideal gas statistical mechanics. To model the thermochemistry of a supported catalyst using a cluster model, the translational and rotational degrees of freedom were omitted from the thermochemistry calculations for all surface species. Thermochemical calculations were performed using the Atomic Simulation Environment 3.16.0, (33) and Virtual NanoLab 2017.2 was used to visualize the DFT-optimized structures. (34)

3.1. Experimental Characterization
KIT-6 supported copper oxide catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of KIT-6 silica with aqueous copper nitrate, dried, and then calcined at 823 K for 4 h prior to use. Cu(NO3)2 solution molarity was adjusted to achieve copper surface densities ranging from 0.01 to 0.7 Cu/nm2 (0.17.4 wt % Cu) to investigate the effects of local surface structure on cyclohexane ODH reactivity. Copper loadings were determined by ICP-OES, and catalyst surface areas were measured by N2 physisorption after calcination to determine Cu surface density. While metal surface density is a useful metric for comparison between catalysts prepared by the same synthesis method, the local metal oxide structure is not solely a function of bulk surface density but instead may vary significantly based on synthetic method, calcination, and drying conditions. In particular, drying and calcination steps have been shown to have a large impact on the uniformity of copper distribution in mesoporous supports for supported catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. (3537) It is also important to consider catalyst storage conditions after synthesis, as the silica surface and resulting metal oxide structures can be sensitive to temperature and water vapor pressure. (3840) We note that, in the present study, CuOx/KIT-6 catalysts restructure slowly over the course of months in moist air, seen as a redshift in UVvisible spectra in Figure S4. To address these issues, synthesis, drying, and calcination steps were carefully controlled for all catalysts, and catalysts were stored under dry N2 to ensure the support degree of hydration remained constant during the course of experiments.
Diffuse reflectance UVvisible spectroscopy is employed to determine the relative copper oxide domain size as a function of surface density in Figure 1. Copper oxide catalysts in Figure 1A display an O2p  Cu3d ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) which is relatively constant at low Cu surface densities and redshifts as Cu surface density increases. The edge energy of this transition provides information on the average local copper oxide domain size. (4143) The gap in energy levels is highest for an isolated molecular structure and decreases with increasing copper oxide cluster size due to hybridization until the domains are large enough to form a band structure. (42) Edge energies for each catalyst are determined by the x-intercept of the linear portion of (F(R)hν)2 vs hν as seen in Figure S5, where F(R) is the KubelkaMunk pseudoabsorbance, and the exponent n = 2 is chosen for a direct allowed transition. Average local copper oxide cluster size as determined by the UVvisible edge energy decreases monotonically with decreasing Cu surface density and begins to plateau around 4.8 eV at loadings below 0.05 Cu/nm2 as seen in Figure 1B. This energy gap of 4.8 eV is therefore associated with the limiting copper oxide species at infinite surface dilution. Catalysts with higher loading and slightly lower edge energy may contain a fraction of this limiting surface species, as the observed edge energy is the average contribution of all local copper oxide structures. However, edge energy decreases sharply above 0.2 Cu/nm2 consistent with primarily copper oxide clusters of increasing domain size. UVvisible spectroscopy is highly sensitive to 3D CuO crystallites that absorb strongly in a band centered at 650 nm, (21,44) allowing for determination of crystalline CuO by the absorbance between 500 and 600 nm. CuOx/KIT-6 catalysts with <0.4 Cu/nm2 have zero pseudoabsorbance in this region (Figure 1A) which allows us to exclude the presence of 3D crystallites in these lower loaded catalysts. The 0.42 and 0.7 Cu/nm2 catalysts have a small but nonzero pseudoabsorbance in this region due to the tail end of the oligomeric Cu LMCT, which means the presence of CuO crystallites cannot be excluded for these higher loaded catalysts based on UVvisible spectra alone. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of freshly prepared CuOx/KIT-6 catalysts in Figure S6 supports the conclusion that catalysts with <0.4 Cu/nm2 contain only surface copper oxide phases, while catalysts with >0.4 Cu/nm2 may contain a minority fraction of CuO crystallites. The freshly prepared CuOx/KIT-6 catalyst with 0.37 Cu/nm2 contains no discernible CuO peaks, while the catalyst with 0.60 Cu/nm2 exhibits small CuO diffraction peaks.

Model cyclohexane oxidative dehydrogenation reactions were conducted for all catalysts varying contact time at constant T = 573 K, PC6H12 = 0.018 bar, and PO2 = 0.04 bar to determine how increasing average local copper oxide domain size impacts activity and selectivity to cyclohexene, benzene, and COx. Maximum cyclohexane conversion was limited to XC6H12 < 11% with corresponding maximum oxygen conversion of XO2 = 10% to remain in the differential conversion regime with respect to both reactants. At the conditions tested, the KIT-6 support activity is 2% of the lowest loaded CuOx/KIT-6 catalyst on a per mass basis, and the KIT-6 support produces only COx as products.
Catalyst activity decreases continuously with increasing time on stream (Figure S7) as the catalysts deactivate. Catalysts with <0.05 Cu/nm2 have an overlapping time on stream envelope such that they have approximately the same activity, and activity decreases with increasing Cu loading for catalysts with >0.05 Cu/nm2. To quantify these trends, the average turnover frequency (TOF) on a per copper basis is calculated for each catalyst from the slope of total product yield vs catalyst contact time after 6 h time on stream (Figure 2A). Average TOF increases by an order of magnitude with decreasing copper surface density then plateaus at 1.4 × 103  0.05 × 103 s1 for copper loadings below 0.05 Cu/nm2 (Figure 2B). Decreasing activity with increasing loading can be ascribed to one of two explanations. Trivially, turnover frequency will drop with increasing loading if some fraction of copper is inaccessible since activities are normalized on a total copper basis. Another explanation for decreasing TOF with increasing Cu loading is that ODH activity is an intrinsic function of the Cu active site structure. This has been observed for CuOx/KIT-6 catalysts in previous work (21) where cyclohexane ODH TOF increased with decreasing average local copper oxide cluster size determined by UVvisible edge energy. From Figure 1B, local copper oxide domain size increases with increasing copper surface density, and Figure 2B shows that TOF decreases with increasing copper surface density. Together, these suggest that cyclohexane ODH TOF decreases with increasing copper oxide domain size. The observed cyclohexane ODH TOF plateaus below 0.05 Cu/nm2 where the catalyst edge energy approaches the limiting value of 4.8 eV. The fact that TOF becomes insensitive to loading below 0.05 Cu/nm2 indicates that the limiting infinite dilution copper oxide structure is the dominant surface structure below this critical metal loading, and it has the highest cyclohexane ODH turnover frequency of all structures sampled by this catalyst series.

Turnover frequency is calculated from the linear portion of yield vs contact time after 6 h time on stream. (B) Average turnover frequency as a function of copper surface density.
One confounding issue is that catalysts deactivate over time as seen in Figure S7. This deactivation is accompanied by a decrease in UVvisible edge energy measured after 19 h of cyclohexane ODH time on stream at T = 573 K (Figure 1B). The decrease in edge energy after catalysis has been explained by aggregation of some copper oxide species during reaction leading to larger average cluster size. (21,45) However, both the average local copper oxide domain size order and TOF order with respect to Cu loading is preserved after reaction. Therefore, the observation that TOF decreases with increasing Cu domain size holds both before and after catalyst deactivation. Moreover, Figure S7b shows catalyst activity normalized to activity at t = 0 h vs time on stream. Catalyst activity does not collapse onto a single curve as would be expected if catalysts contained a single type of active site whose concentration decreases over time due to deactivation. This supports the conclusion that intrinsic catalytic activity changes continuously as a function of Cu domain size. Next, selectivityyield profiles are shown in Figure 3 to determine whether cyclohexane oxidation selectivity is a function of copper oxide cluster size.

Dashed lines in (A) are a linear fit to the C6 selectivityyield profiles after initial deactivation to estimate zero-yield selectivity.
Cyclohexane oxidation proceeds by two main pathways: an ODH-type pathway involving sequential CH bond abstraction, and nonselective combustion-like pathways which exclusively produce COx. In the ODH-like pathway, cyclohexane adsorbs to the catalyst followed by the rate determining initial CH bond abstraction with 2e reduction of the active site. (46,47) Selectivity to cyclohexene or benzene is determined by fast reaction steps after the rate determining initial CH bond abstraction. In addition, the CH bond dissociation energy for benzene is much higher than for cyclohexane or cyclohexene, (48) so it is expected that the CH bond abstraction pathway terminates at benzene without significant overoxidation to COx. Therefore, selectivity to C6 products on a per cyclohexane basis, defined as
(3)
gives an estimate of the pathway selectivity to useful ODH chemistry compared to combustion chemistry. In addition, benzene selectivity excluding COx, defined as
(4)
is a useful metric for analyzing productive ODH chemistry excluding direct combustion pathways.
Figure 3A shows catalyst C6 selectivity as a function of yield. The black dashed lines are a fit to selectivityyield data after 6 h time on stream to determine initial C6 selectivity at zero conversion, denoted S0,C6. All catalysts exhibit a modest decrease in C6 selectivity with increasing yield due to sequential reactions. The limiting case of C6 selectivity at zero yield is the intrinsic pathway selectivity for CH bond abstraction compared with combustion-like chemistries in a single adsorptionreactiondesorption cycle. The zero-yield C6 selectivity decreases with decreasing Cu surface density, which we assign to combustion on the increasing amounts of residual silica surface. The rates of both CH abstraction and direct combustion increase as Cu surface density decreases (Table S2), indicating that the decrease in ODH pathway selectivity with decreasing Cu cluster size (Figure 3A) is modest compared with the increase in overall TOF in Figure 2B.
While pathway selectivity to ODH vs combustion pathways changes as a function of copper oxide cluster size, all catalysts have the same benzene-yield profile as shown in Figure 3B, which shows that neither changes in copper oxide cluster size nor changes in the amount of residual silica surface affects the relative rates of allylic and aliphatic CH bond abstraction. This is consistent with previous work which found that sequential oxidative dehydrogenation was affected by promotor species such as Na+ or changing the active metal center from Cu2+ to V5+ but was insensitive to copper oxide precursor. (21)
There is a critical change in catalyst behavior below 0.05 Cu/nm2 in Figure 2B where cyclohexane ODH activity becomes independent of loading, and examining the ODH mechanism may help explain this behavior. The rate-determining step in alkane ODH involves a 2e reduction of the catalytically active phase, (46,47) and the rate of propane ODH for supported vanadia catalysts has been shown to increase with increasing vanadia redox activity. (49) For this reason, catalyst redox properties were investigated by in situ XANES and UVvisible spectroscopy while heating in a reducing environment to determine whether differences in redox activity between catalysts can explain differences in TOF with increasing Cu loading.
XANES spectra were collected during reduction of CuOx/KIT-6 catalysts in dilute H2/Ar between 393 and 603 K to track the evolution of Cu2+, Cu+, and Cu0 species at each point in the reduction profile as in Figure 4A. Bolded XANES spectra in Figure 4A show the representative features of copper in the +2, +1, and 0 oxidation states, respectively, as reduction time increases. (5052) Decomposition of each spectrum by linear combination fitting gives the fraction of copper in each oxidation state at each point along the reduction profile for a single catalyst as seen in Figure 4B. This procedure is repeated for each catalyst and presented in Figure S8, and the maximum error in any data point in any fit is 1.6 percentage points. Comparing the fraction of Cu+ at a single temperature along the reduction profile gives a way to quantify differences in redox activity between catalysts. At every temperature along the reduction profile, the fraction of reduced Cu+ increases in the order of decreasing Cu surface density (Figure S8), and so, the choice of temperature for comparison is arbitrary. Using T = 453 K for comparison, Figure 4C shows the fraction of Cu+ present in each catalyst at 453 K in dilute H2 increases with decreasing average local copper oxide domain size as determined by UVvisible edge energies. This is equivalent to the statement that Cu2+/Cu+ redox activity increases with decreasing copper oxide domain size. A more redox active site can more readily facilitate the rate determining initial CH bond abstraction in cyclohexane ODH. Combined with the fact that catalyst activity does not collapse onto a single deactivation curve (Figure S7b), this demonstrates that the increase in cyclohexane ODH TOF with a decrease in Cu loading in Figure 2B is due to an increase in the intrinsic activity of each active site rather than a trivial change in the fraction of accessible copper.

(C) Fraction of Cu in +1 oxidation state after reduction in 4% H2/Ar at T = 453 K for five catalysts plotted against UVvisible edge energy.
In addition to in situ XANES reductions, in situ UVvisible reduction profiles provide a plethora of information on copper structure and oxidation state during the critical reduction step which may help explain the observed dependence of turnover frequency on copper loading in Figure 2B. Cu2+ has a 3d9 structure while Cu+ and Cu0 have a full d-band, so reduction of Cu2+ can be tracked by a decrease in the dd transition band between 600 and 800 nm. (44) Metallic Cu0 also exhibits broad absorbance between 200 and 800 nm due to interband transitions and can be tracked easily by nonzero absorbance between 500 and 600 nm. (44,53) The presence and extent of an intermediate Cu+ phase during reduction depends on the average local copper oxide cluster size (51,54,55) and can be inferred from UVvisible spectra by a decrease in the Cu(dd) band intensity without increase in absorption due to metallic Cu0.
Figure 5A shows representative UVvisible absorption spectra collected for a CuOx/KIT-6 catalyst with 0.024 Cu/nm2 loading at different temperatures during the reduction, with similar plots for the rest of the series in Figure S9. The LMCT initially redshifts to λ = 270 nm on heating and then splits into two distinct bands at λ = 245 nm and λ = 300 nm by 573 K with a concurrent decrease in Cu(dd) band (Figure S10) as the copper reduces to Cu+. We previously observed this LMCT split on reduction in CuOx/KIT-6 catalysts prepared from a variety of precursors (21) and correlated it with higher catalytic activity for cyclohexane ODH. Notably, the higher energy λ = 245 nm feature is highly sensitive to the support preparation as seen in Figure S11. In that figure, copper was deposited onto commercial silica gel with two different pretreatments. The first batch was used as received and does not show the λ = 245 nm band on reduction, while the second batch was calcined at 823 K to dehydrate the surface before synthesis, and the resulting catalyst exhibits both Cu+ features at λ = 245 nm and λ = 300 nm on reduction. This suggests that the distinct Cu+ feature at λ = 245 nm is not intrinsic to the KIT-6 structure but forms generally on silica that has been dehydroxylated at high temperature.

Black dashed lines indicate location of the two distinct absorption bands identified in (A).
The extent of reduction and presence of these two Cu+ bands depends on average local copper oxide cluster size as seen in Figure 5B. Catalysts with >0.2 Cu/nm2 reduce directly to Cu0 at 573 K based on large absorbance between 500 and 600 nm. Reduction directly to Cu0 particles is typical for larger copper oxide domains and is consistent with their lower edge energies. Conversely, catalysts with <0.05 Cu/nm2 reduce to primarily Cu+ indicating all copper oxide domains in these catalysts are below the critical size where copper easily reduces to Cu0 which is consistent with their high edge energies. The LMCT band of all catalysts <0.05 Cu/nm2 splits into the two distinct bands at 245 and 300 nm seen in Figure 5A. The presence of such a distinct behavior at the critical loading where cyclohexane ODH TOF becomes constant is evidence for the existence of a distinct, highly active site for ODH. In addition, the two Cu+ bands form reproducibly on multiple redox cycles (Figure S12) which is necessary for any catalytically active site. The 0.1 Cu/nm2 catalyst spectrum is an intermediate case showing the two Cu+ features at 245 and 300 nm as well as some Cu0 particles based on the large LMCT tail. Since UVvisible spectroscopy shows an average of all structures, it is likely that the 0.1 Cu/nm2 catalyst contains both the distinct Cu sites as well as larger copper oxide domains.
The presence of distinct Cu+ bands in Figure 5B, UVvisible edge energies plateauing at 4.8 eV in Figure 1B, and the fact that cyclohexane ODH turnover frequency is structure sensitive but becomes insensitive to copper surface density below the critical loading of 0.05 Cu/nm2 in Figure 2B collectively provide strong evidence that CuOx/KIT-6 catalysts below this critical surface density are composed of a single dominant copper oxide structure which is highly active for cyclohexane ODH. In situ EXAFS and resonance enhanced Raman experiments combined with modeling by density functional theory were used to determine the active site structure in low loaded CuOx/KIT-6 catalysts under oxidized and reduced conditions.
X-ray absorption spectra of CuOx/KIT-6 catalysts were collected under reducing and oxidizing conditions, and the EXAFS Fourier transform (FT) magnitude is presented in Figure 6. EXAFS spectra for reduced catalysts were only collected for catalysts with 0.05 Cu/nm2 because H2UVvisible spectra in Figure 5 indicate higher loaded catalysts reduce to a significant fraction of metallic copper nanoparticles which are not relevant to structures present during ODH chemistry. Additional data and experimental details such as the k2-weighted χ(k) function and Fourier transform (FT) real components are presented in Figures S13 and S14. The FT magnitude of all oxidized catalysts in Figure 6 has a nonzero second shell scattering peak between 2.2 and 3 Å due to CuSi and CuCu scattering paths even at surface densities as low as 0.01 Cu/nm2. This second shell peak increases in intensity and narrows in line width below the critical 0.05 Cu/nm2 density and broadens again for the 0.01 Cu/nm2 catalyst. The second shell line shape is the product of interference between CuO, CuCu, and CuSi scattering paths and, as a consequence, is highly sensitive to Cu coordination and site heterogeneity. The increase in peak height with decrease in line width does not necessarily imply an increase in the second shell coordination number but may reflect a decrease in site heterogeneity. This is supported by EXAFS model fit parameters in Table S3 which show that catalysts with >0.05 Cu/nm2 have a larger CuCu coordination number than those with <0.05 Cu/nm2, but they have substantially larger σCuCu2 which results in a lower amplitude second shell scattering peak. On reduction to Cu+, the first shell peak decreases in intensity due to a decrease in CuO coordination, and the second shell peak disappears indicating a large increase in CuSi and CuCu separation distances. XANES of the 0.01 Cu/nm2 catalyst (Figure S15) collected in flowing 20% O2/N2 at T = 323 K shows that approximately 9% of the copper autoreduces to Cu+ even under oxidizing conditions. The increase in second shell line width in the 0.01 Cu/nm2 catalyst therefore may reflect increased site heterogeneity due to the large structural differences between Cu2+ and Cu+ structures. However, the 0.024 and 0.05 Cu/nm2 catalysts contain a single Cu2+ species based on the similar second shell scattering peak in Figure 6 in addition to reactivity data in Figure 2B and spectroscopic evidence in Figure 5B so that fitting their spectra can provide insight into the Cu site structure.

Fitting the 0.024 Cu/nm2 catalyst with only CuCu, only CuSi, or a combination of CuCu and CuSi paths in Figure S16 and Table S4 shows that the best fit model contains second shell contributions from both CuCu and CuSi scattering paths. Examining the CuSi and CuCu scattering paths in detail (Figure S17), they largely overlap destructively between R  (1.75, 2.3) Å and constructively between R  (2.3, 2.9) Å. The sum of their contributions is required to explain both the large amplitude and narrow line width of the second shell peak without resorting to unphysically large coordination numbers or unphysically small DebyeWaller factors. In addition, fitting the 0.024 Cu/nm2 EXAFS data to models with CuO and either CuCu or CuSi scattering paths requires a nonphysical fifth oxygen in the second coordination shell to fit the data between R = 1.72.3 Å. This indicates that there are CuCu interactions in all catalysts, even those below the critical 0.05 Cu/nm2 loading.
Figure 7 compares the Fourier transform magnitude and real component and best fit model for the CuOx/KIT-6 catalyst with 0.024 Cu/nm2 under oxidizing and reducing conditions. The catalyst exists in the pure Cu2+ state at T = 323 K in 20% O2/N2 (Figure 7A), and it reduces to the pure Cu+ state by T = 523 K in 4% H2/He (Figure 7B) based on linear combination fitting of the XANES spectra under these conditions. The data in each case was fit to determine the best fit EXAFS parameters in Table 1. The best fit model for the oxidized state has a CuO coordination number of 4 typical for Cu2+ complexes which decreases to 2.5 after reduction to Cu+. The decrease in CuO coordination on reduction is in line with the sharp XANES peak at 8983 eV (Figure S15) attributed to a 1s  4px,y transition for copper in a linear coordination environment. (50) In addition, the best fit model for the oxidized state gives a CuCu coordination number of 1 consistent with dimeric copper structures. Dimeric copper structures are well-known to activate oxygen in both enzymatic (19,56) and inorganic Cu-zeolite systems (15,57,58) which are active for phenol oxidation to quinone, (59) methane oxidation to methanol, (12,13,58) and the oxidation half-cycle in the selective reduction of NO with NH3. (15) These dimers can bind oxygen in a variety of configurations including end-on or side-on peroxo, bis(μ-oxo), or mono(μ-oxo) bridging structures. (56,57,60,61) The CuCu separation distance of 2.92 Å may be consistent with either a bis(μ-oxo) or mono(μ-oxo)dicopper core as seen in Cu exchanged zeolites (15,18) and is too short to accommodate oxygen bound in either end-on or side-on peroxo structures more common in enzymatic systems and recently observed in Cu-CHA. (6062) However, the EXAFS data does not discriminate between a bis(μ-oxo) or mono(μ-oxo) structure, and supplemental evidence from Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory is required to identify the copper core structure. It is also interesting that the best fit model in Table 1 gives a noninteger CuSi coordination of 1.5 suggesting that the copper atoms sit in an asymmetric environment with one copper atom coordinated closely with one framework Si while the other is coordinated closely with two framework Si.

In situ resonant Raman experiments were conducted to determine silica and copper structural motifs of the oxidized and reduced catalysts to supplement the geometric constraints placed on these structures by EXAFS fitting. Raman spectroscopy is an invaluable tool for probing low frequency vibrational modes commonly present in amorphous metal oxides which are difficult to examine by infrared spectroscopy. (27) Amorphous SiO2 supports such as KIT-6 are composed of several common structural motifs including siloxane rings varying in ring strain from 3 to 8 silicon atoms, SiOSi siloxane bridges, and silanols with different extents of interaction by hydrogen bonding. These motifs may serve as grafting or exchange sites for transition metal oxides, (22,6365) and the exact exchange site structure can impact the activity of the resulting grafted transition metal oxide species. For example, Scott and co-workers have observed a chromasiloxane ring size effect on the activity of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts for ethylene polymerization in which unstrained 8-member chromasiloxane rings do not activate ethylene, while strained 6-member chromasiloxane rings are very active ethylene polymerization sites. (22) Raman active vibrational modes for each of these siloxane structural motifs are present in dehydrated KIT-6 (Figure 8) with peak assignments given in Table 2.

The surface structures present on silica change as a function of the degree of hydration of the surface as seen in Figure S18, and so, catalysts were dehydrated at T = 823 K under flowing 5% O2/He before collecting in situ Raman spectra in oxidizing or reducing environments to ensure a constant degree of hydration of the surface in all spectra. In situ Raman spectra of the KIT-6 support and 0.024 Cu/nm2 exchanged CuOx/KIT-6 catalyst in Figure 8 show changes in the support surface structures upon copper deposition. The spectral band at 980 cm1 associated with the SiOH stretching mode has the same intensity when spectra are normalized by the bulk SiO2 symmetric SiOSi stretch, νs, at 820 cm1, indicating that copper does not exchange at silanol sites. Instead, there is a decrease in intensity of the 607 cm1 band attributed to strained 3-member siloxane rings with a subsequent increase in the 4- and 56-member siloxane ring intensities at 496 and 430450 cm1 respectively. This provides evidence that copper inserts into the strained 3-member siloxane ring defect sites to generate stable 4-member rings. This behavior has been observed in preparation of single site zinc and cobalt catalysts supported on silica (8,10) for propane dehydrogenation.
The excitation wavelength 458 nm (2.7 eV) used in Figure 8 favors SiO2 Raman features due to the large abundance of Si compared with Cu. However, vibrational modes associated with copper can be selectively resonance enhanced by excitation with a UV laser source with energy higher than the Cu LMCT. (27) Vibrational modes associated with copper were selectively resonance enhanced by excitation at 250 nm (4.96 eV) to probe copper vibrational states of the oxidized and reduced catalysts (Figure 9). Figure 9A shows growth of bands at 560 cm1 and 10401185 cm1 upon deposition of copper. Resonance enhancement of the asymmetric SiOSi stretches, νas, between 1040 and 1185 cm1 at 250 nm excitation provides strong evidence for charge transfer between copper and surface siloxane bridges. This charge transfer between copper and surface siloxane bridges is further confirmed by resonance enhancement at 325 nm in Figure S19 showing an even larger enhancement in νas upon copper deposition. In addition, the band at 560 cm1 is a vibrational mode associated primarily with copper based on the resonance enhancement at 250 nm. This mode could be consistent with the symmetric stretch of either a mono(μ-oxo) or bis(μ-oxo)dicopper(II) core depending on the CuOCu angle, and the exact nature of this dimeric copper core is investigated later by density functional theory.

(B) In situ UV-resonance enhanced Raman spectra of KIT-6 and 0.024 Cu/nm2 catalyst oxidized in 5% O2/He at 823 K and after reduction in 3% H2/He at 573 K. After gas treatment, catalysts are cooled in He, and spectra are collected at room temperature.
Resonance enhanced in situ Raman experiments were also conducted under oxidizing and reducing environments to determine how copper structural motifs change during multiple redox cycles. Raman spectra of the oxidized and reduced 0.024 Cu/nm2 catalyst in Figure 9B show the dicopper mode at 560 cm1 and enhancement of νas between 1040 and 1185 cm1 completely disappears on reduction in 3% H2/He at 573 K, indicating structural rearrangement of both the CuOxCu and Cu(SiOSi) moieties during reduction. This is consistent with EXAFS spectra in Figures 6 and 7 where the second shell scattering peak disappears after reduction due to an increase in the CuCu and CuSi separation distances. Moreover, the CuOxCu and Cu-(SiOSi) moieties form reproducibly on multiple redox cycles seen by reappearance of the bands at 560 and 10401185 cm1 on reoxidation in Figure S19. Reproducible formation of these bands is critical because it indicates that these two moieties can turn over during a redox cycle, and therefore, they may be associated with the catalytically active copper species for cyclohexane ODH.
3.2. DFT Modeling of Potential Active Site Structures
We assess the feasibility of mono(μ-oxo) and bis(μ-oxo)dicopper(II) structures by comparing the properties of several model systems presented in Figure S20 with EXAFS and resonant Raman results. In terms of model systems, silsesquioxanes have widely been adopted as cluster models of amorphous silica, (64,7173) and they have been previously used to model Zn(II) cations inserted into 3-member siloxane ring defect sites. (8) For the mono(μ-oxo)dicopper(II) structures, the locally amorphous silica surface was modeled using a silsesquioxane-based silica structure inspired by the prior work of Magg et al. (71) because it can incorporate a dimeric Cu structure, and the Cu is inserted into 3-member siloxane ring defects consistent with Raman results in Figure 8. Two nearby silanol groups were incorporated into some of the models to bring the total CuO coordination number up to 4 in agreement with the best fit EXAFS model.
The DFT-optimized structure for the four coordinate mono(μ-oxo)dicopper(II) model, denoted I-ox, is shown in Figure 10. The CuCu distance was found to be 2.90 Å, in excellent agreement with the 2.92 Å determined from EXAFS. To model the reduction of the mono(μ-oxo)dicopper(II) sites by H2, we consider a reaction wherein the bridging oxo ligand is hydrogenated to form H2O, which desorbs from the surface leaving behind two isolated Cu(I) sites, denoted I-red, in Figure 10. The positions of the terminating H atoms of the two nearby silanol groups were fixed during reduction to prevent unphysical interactions with the rest of the silica network.
From DFT, it is predicted that reduction via H2 significantly increases the CuCu distance from 2.90 to 5.21 Å, in agreement with the disappearance of the second coordination shell peak upon reduction from EXAFS. An increase in CuCu bond distance on reduction is typical for the mono(μ-oxo)dicopper(II) motif, and calculations of similar (CuOCu)2+ cores in Cu-MFI predict the degree of rearrangement is highly sensitive to how copper binds to the support lattice. (74) The reduction of the dicopper(II) core is also thermodynamically favorable at 573 K with ΔG573 K = 57 kJ/mol. Vibrational analysis of I-ox and I-red shows a Raman active CuOCu symmetric stretching mode at 559 cm1 which disappears on reduction in accordance with resonant Raman data in Figure 9. However, we note that the CuCu separation distance and CuOCu Raman vibrational frequency are sensitive to the exact Cu coordination environment. Model I incorporates two nearby silanol sites whose position is optimized to minimize the energy of the overall structure. In an actual catalyst, the location of nearby silanol sites depends on the local pore structure which may be slightly different for each copper site. To investigate how sensitive the model is to the local copper coordination environment, we removed the nearby silanol sites to generate three coordinate models II-ox and III-ox which differ in the proton topology around the CuOCu core.
The DFT-optimized structures, key geometric parameters, vibrational frequencies, and reaction energies for all models are reported in Tables S5S7. The three coordinate model systems exhibit the same key features as the four coordinate model: a thermodynamically favorable increase in the CuCu distance upon reduction and a Raman-active CuOCu symmetric stretching mode. However, the CuOCu angle increases from 101 in I-ox to 110 and 127 in models II-ox and III-ox, respectively, in compensation for the lack of fourth CuO coordination and difference in proton topology near the CuOCu moiety. This leads to an increase in the CuCu separation distance from 2.90 Å to 2.98 and 3.24 Å and a blue shift in the SiOSi symmetric stretch to 575577 cm1 in models II-ox and III-ox. Combined, this shows that a mono(μ-oxo)dicopper(II) site can exhibit features consistent with all EXAFS and resonant Raman data, but the exact properties are sensitive to the Cu coordination environment.
Figure 10

A bis(μ-oxo)dicopper(II) structure, denoted IV-ox (Figure S20), was also investigated using DFT, and its key geometric properties, vibrational frequencies, and reaction energy are reported in Tables S5S7. The bis(μ-oxo) CuCu distance was calculated to be 2.95 Å, which is predicted to increase to 5.37 Å upon reduction via H2. Vibrational analysis shows that model IV-ox exhibits a Raman-active antisymmetric stretching mode associated with the CuO2Cu core at 560 cm1 that disappears upon reduction. Both of these features are consistent with the EXAFS and Raman data. However, the bis(μ-oxo)dicopper(II) core places some constraints on the overall structure which are not consistent with EXAFS and Raman data. Most bis(μ-oxo) copper dimers described in the literature involve Cu(III) species, in which copper binds to both oxo ligands and an extended structure such as an organometallic ligand system or zeolite framework, (56,62,75,76) but XANES of the oxidized CuOx/KIT-6 catalysts show that all copper is Cu(I)/Cu(II) (Figure S15). To achieve a bis(μ-oxo)dicopper(II) species, the oxo ligands must form a covalent bond with the support, analogous to a bis(μ-OH) structure. This added constraint on the bridging oxo ligands is incompatible with the silsesquioxane-based silica model used to model the mono(μ-oxo)dicopper(II) as well as other models with Cu inserted into 3-member ring siloxane defects. Instead, we used a different minimal silica cluster model in model IV-ox to accommodate the bis(μ-oxo)dicopper(II) core, but this new structure is incompatible with the Raman data in Figure 8 showing Cu sited into 3-member ring siloxane defects. The increased interaction between the bridging oxo ligands and the support in IV-ox also results in a short average CuSi separation distance of 2.84 Å which is inconsistent with the average CuSi distance of 3.12 Å determined by EXAFS modeling.
The use of silsesquioxanes and many other common cluster models to simulate transition metal cations dispersed on a silica support naturally results in a symmetric active site geometry. (77) In general, one way to explore asymmetric sites is to construct a series of cluster models from periodic slab models of amorphous silica generated from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. (78,79) However, identifying a series of 3-member defect sites in these slab models that can support Cu(II) dimers in the coordination environment predicted by EXAFS is impractical, as these sites are likely to be minority species or not present at all in these MD-generated models. As such, while the silica-supported dicopper(II) model systems presented in this work have characteristic geometries and vibrational frequencies in agreement with experiment, they do not capture the asymmetric sites suggested by EXAFS and resonant Raman data.
3.3. Active Site Structure Discussion
Overall, the combined RamanEXAFSDFT results suggest the active site of CuOx/KIT-6 catalysts with <0.05 Cu/nm2 is a mono(μ-oxo)dicopper(II) core. EXAFS and resonant Raman experiments show this dimer may exist in an asymmetric environment with at least one Cu atom sited in a 4-member ring formed by introduction of Cu into the 3-member siloxane ring defect site (Figure 8) and the other Cu atom in a different environment as evidenced by EXAFS fit of NCuSi = 1.5 in Table 1 and charge transfer between Cu(SiOSi) moieties in Figures 9 and S19. DFT shows this site readily reduces to a Cu+···Cu+ core with increased CuCu separation distance consistent with loss of the EXAFS second shell scattering peak in Figure 7b. This reduced Cu+···Cu+ structure is associated with UVvisible absorption bands at λ = 245 nm and λ = 300 nm, which form reproducibly on multiple redox cycles (Figure S12). The λ = 245 nm Cu(I) band forms on reduction of Cu deposited on freshly calcined KIT-6 and commercial silica gel (Figures 5 and S11b) but does not form during reduction of Cu deposited on hydrated commercial silica (Figure S11a). KIT-6 has a large proportion of highly strained 3-member siloxane rings seen by the prominent 607 cm1 band in Figure 8, and the calcined commercial silica gel is likely very similar. The λ = 245 nm absorption band is therefore likely due to the fraction of Cu+ inserted into strained 3-member siloxane ring defects, while the λ = 300 nm absorption band is assigned to Cu+ in a more relaxed environment. Reoxidation is not rate-limiting, so the existence of two distinct Cu(I) sites should not impact catalysis under the conditions studied here.
The Cu+···Cu+ core reoxidizes in the presence of O2 to reform the mono(μ-oxo)dicopper(II) active site as evidenced by reversible formation of the symmetric CuOCu stretching mode on reoxidation (Figure S19). While the reoxidation pathway for the reduced Cu+···Cu+ core is unclear from the data presented, it may proceed by a pathway similar to that proposed for reoxidation of the Cu+···Cu+ in Cu-MOR and Cu-MFI thought to be the active site for methane oxidation to methanol. (18,80) In that case, it is suggested that O2 is first reduced by the Cu+···Cu+ core to form a side-on peroxo μ-(η2:η2) dicopper(II) core followed by 2e reduction of the peroxo bond by spectator Cu+ to regenerate the (CuOCu)2+ core. In the present case, a nearby Cu+···Cu+ core could provide 2e to break the peroxo bond and accept O2, thereby regenerating two (CuOCu)2+ cores. Additionally, CuOx/KIT-6 catalysts do deactivate under reaction conditions due to aggregation of copper oxide species. The Cu+ species are not bound strongly to the support and may become mobile in the presence of water generated during cyclohexane ODH instead of reforming the (CuOCu)2+ core.
The mono(μ-oxo)dicopper(II) species proposed in the current study shares many structural similarities with those proposed in Cu-MOR, Cu-MFI, and Cu-CHA, but the Cu site differs in how it bonds to the support. Specifically, Cu exchanged in MOR or MFI is bound ionically to a SiOAl surface site, while the Cu in CuOx/KIT-6 is covalently bound to the surface. Moreover, greater confinement in zeolite lattices compared with mesoporous KIT-6 imparts configurational constraints on the (CuOCu)2+ core which differ from that in Cu/KIT-6. These differences manifest as differences in observed Raman and XAS features. The symmetric CuOCu stretch measured at 560 cm1 in Cu/KIT-6 catalysts is in between that reported for Cu-MOR and Cu-MFI (460 cm1) (13) and Cu-CHA (617 cm1). (60,61) The CuCu distance of 2.92 Å in Cu/KIT-6 is similar to that observed in Cu-MOR and Cu-MFI with EXAFS and normal coordinate analysis of Raman data, (18,57) and it is much shorter than that observed by EXAFS in Cu-CHA. (60,61) The differences in (CuOCu)2+ structure and bonding to the support may impact catalytic performance, and more work is required to determine whether the dimeric Cu sites in CuOx/KIT-6 behave similarly to those exchanged in zeolites.
4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Here, we present evidence for how copper oxide structure impacts cyclohexane ODH reactivity as a function of average local copper oxide cluster size. Cyclohexane ODH activity increases with decreasing average local copper oxide cluster size due to increasing Cu2+/Cu+ redox activity with decreasing copper oxide cluster size as determined by UVvisible spectroscopy and in situ XANES studies. However, decreasing C6 selectivity at zero conversion with decreasing copper loading indicates that pathway selectivity to productive ODH chemistry decreases with decreasing copper oxide cluster size. While the proportion of ODH chemistry to direct combustion changes with cluster size, this does not impact the benzene selectivity within the ODH pathway. Constant benzene selectivity vs yield profiles for all catalysts indicate the relative rates of allylic and aliphatic CH bond abstraction are insensitive to copper oxide cluster size.
In addition, constant ODH rates at low Cu loadings and the onset of two distinct UVvisible Cu+ absorption bands during the reduction point to the presence of a distinct Cu site at low Cu loadings which is highly active for ODH chemistry. Spectroscopic features associated with the oxidized and reduced forms of this site form reversibly on multiple redox cycles, which is required for catalytic turnover during cyclohexane ODH. Combined in situ EXAFS, in situ resonant Raman studies, and DFT modeling show that this site is likely a mono(μ-oxo) copper dimer formed by interaction with a 3-member ring siloxane defect. In addition, the presence of two Cu+ UVvisible absorption bands, the fractional CuSi coordination number of 1.5, and evidence for two Cu binding motifs to the KIT-6 support collectively suggest that the two copper atoms in the dimer are situated in nonequivalent environments. This structure bears remarkable similarities to Cu motifs in Cu-MOR, Cu-MFI, and particulate methane monooxygenase that can activate methane for the production of methanol, and future work will follow up on this topic.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
