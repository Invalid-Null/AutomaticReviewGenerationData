         [1] "A series of catalyst materials, including ZnO/Al2O3 and Pt-ZnO/Al2O3, have been prepared by an impregnation method (see section S1 in the Supporting Information), and their physicochemical properties and catalytic performance are illustrated in Table 1." 
         [2] "Figure 2 shows a HAADF-STEM image of the representative 15Zn0.1Pt catalyst particle, which exhibits the best catalytic performance. No Pt or ZnO crystallites were detected by analyzing the number of particles, indicating a high dispersion and small particle size."

         3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes preparing ZnO/Al2O3 and Pt-ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts by an impregnation method to optimize the dispersion of Zn2+ active sites and Pt promoter sites. STEM imaging of 15Zn0.1Pt showed high dispersion and small particle size of Pt and ZnO.

         [1] "Figure 2 shows a HAADF-STEM image of the representative 15Zn0.1Pt catalyst particle, which exhibits the best catalytic performance. No Pt or ZnO crystallites were detected by analyzing the number of particles, indicating a high dispersion and small particle size. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) further confirmed the uniform PtZn element distribution over the Al2O3 support."
         [2] "Figure 2b. A proposed model for the PtZnAl catalyst."

         5. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like HAADF-STEM and EDX to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides imaging and analysis showing uniform Pt and Zn distribution over the Al2O3 support for 15Zn0.1Pt, and proposes a model for the PtZnAl interface.

         [1] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements suggest that the majority of Zn was present in the 2+ valence state and was mainly on the surface of Al2O3 (Table S1 and Figure 3), which is similar to PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts."
         [2] "In Figure 3, both fresh 15Zn and 15Zn0.1Pt catalysts displayed only one obvious peak at 499 eV, which was assigned to Zn2+. After 4 h of PDH reaction, a pronounced shoulder feature appeared at 496 eV for the 15Zn catalyst, which was attributed to Zn0, while no similar feature was found for the 15Zn0.1Pt catalyst."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         6. Yes, the article uses XPS to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. XPS data showed Zn was present as Zn2+ in fresh catalysts, and a shoulder peak indicating Zn0 formation appeared for 15Zn after reaction, while no peak change occurred for 15Zn0.1Pt, suggesting Pt stabilizes Zn2+.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         6. 是的,文章使用XPS来探究丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。XPS数据显示新鲜催化剂中Zn存在为Zn2+,并且在15Zn催化剂反应后出现一个表明Zn0生成的肩峰,而15Zn0.1Pt没有峰的变化,提示Pt稳定了Zn2+。
