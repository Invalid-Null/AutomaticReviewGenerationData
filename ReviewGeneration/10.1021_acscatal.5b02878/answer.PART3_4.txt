[1] "A series of catalyst materials, including ZnO/Al2O3 and Pt-ZnO/Al2O3, have been prepared by an impregnation method (see section S1 in the Supporting Information), and their physicochemical properties and catalytic performance are illustrated in Table 1."

[2] "Figure 2 shows a HAADF-STEM image of the representative 15Zn0.1Pt catalyst particle, which exhibits the best catalytic performance. No Pt or ZnO crystallites were detected by analyzing the number of particles, indicating a high dispersion and small particle size."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using an impregnation method to prepare ZnO/Al2O3 and Pt-ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts. STEM imaging showed no detectable Pt or ZnO crystallites for the 15Zn0.1Pt catalyst, indicating high dispersion and small particle size.

[1] "Figure 2 shows a HAADF-STEM image of the representative 15Zn0.1Pt catalyst particle, which exhibits the best catalytic performance. No Pt or ZnO crystallites were detected by analyzing the number of particles, indicating a high dispersion and small particle size. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) further confirmed the uniform PtZn element distribution over the Al2O3 support."

5. Yes, the article employs HAADF-STEM and EDX to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides a STEM image and EDX analysis showing uniform distribution of Pt and Zn over Al2O3 support for the 15Zn0.1Pt catalyst, and proposes a model for the PtZnAl catalyst interface.

[1] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements suggest that the majority of Zn was present in the 2+ valence state and was mainly on the surface of Al2O3 (Table S1 and Figure 3), which is similar to PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts."

[2] "In Figure 3, both fresh 15Zn and 15Zn0.1Pt catalysts displayed only one obvious peak at 499 eV, which was assigned to Zn2+. After 4 h of PDH reaction, a pronounced shoulder feature appeared at 496 eV for the 15Zn catalyst, which was attributed to Zn0, while no similar feature was found for the 15Zn0.1Pt catalyst."

6. Yes, the article uses XPS to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. XPS data showed Zn was mainly present as Zn2+ for fresh 15Zn and 15Zn0.1Pt catalysts. After reaction, a shoulder at 496 eV indicating Zn0 formation was observed for 15Zn but not 15Zn0.1Pt, suggesting Pt inhibits ZnO reduction.

6. 是的,这篇文章使用XPS来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。XPS数据显示新鲜的15Zn和15Zn0.1Pt催化剂中的Zn主要以Zn2+存在。反应后,15Zn上出现496 eV的肩峰表示形成了Zn0,而15Zn0.1Pt上没有,表明Pt抑制了ZnO的还原。
