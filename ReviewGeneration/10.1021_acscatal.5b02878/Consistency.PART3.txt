 Here is the comparative analysis of the answer files:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "66%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"}, 
  "4": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "66%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I parsed the correct answers and each comparative answer file to extract the English answers. I compared these to the correct English answers to determine consistency percentages for each question and file. The JSON output shows the consistency ratio for each question-file combination.
