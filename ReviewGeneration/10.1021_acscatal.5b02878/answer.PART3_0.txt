[1] "This paper describes a catalyst comprising ZnO modified by trace platinum supported on Al2O3, where the Zn2+ species serve as active sites and platinum acts as a promoter."

[2] "A series of catalyst materials, including ZnO/Al2O3 and Pt-ZnO/Al2O3, have been prepared by an impregnation method (see section S1 in the Supporting Information), and their physicochemical properties and catalytic performance are illustrated in Table 1."

[1] "Figure 2 shows a HAADF-STEM image of the representative 15Zn0.1Pt catalyst particle, which exhibits the best catalytic performance. No Pt or ZnO crystallites were detected by analyzing the number of particles, indicating a high dispersion and small particle size."

[2] "Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) further confirmed the uniform PtZn element distribution over the Al2O3 support."

[1] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements suggest that the majority of Zn was present in the 2+ valence state and was mainly on the surface of Al2O3 (Table S1 and Figure 3), which is similar to PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts."

[2] "In Figure 3, both fresh 15Zn and 15Zn0.1Pt catalysts displayed only one obvious peak at 499 eV, which was assigned to Zn2+. After 4 h of PDH reaction, a pronounced shoulder feature appeared at 496 eV for the 15Zn catalyst, which was attributed to Zn0, while no similar feature was found for the 15Zn0.1Pt catalyst."

6. Yes, the article uses XPS to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows Zn is present as Zn2+ in fresh catalysts, but some is reduced to Zn0 in spent 15Zn catalyst, while 15Zn0.1Pt maintains Zn2+ after reaction.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
6. 是的,文章使用XPS来探究丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。它显示新鲜催化剂中Zn存在为Zn2+,但在使用过的15Zn催化剂中有些被还原为Zn0,而15Zn0.1Pt在反应后保持Zn2+。
