<English version answer>
Answer: The article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on ZnO-based catalysts.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:文章没有评估任何像Cr2O3,Pt-Sn和Ga2O3等有前途的金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它专注于ZnO基催化剂。

[1] "Alternatively, among the various metal oxides that are actively used for PDH (vanadium oxide, gallium oxide, etc.), zinc oxide (ZnO) is a promising candidate, with both low cost and low toxicity."

[2] "Although the catalytic performance is far from satisfactory, few methods have been reported to simultaneously inhibit the deactivation and improve the activity of ZnO."

[3] "This paper describes how the addition of trace amounts of platinum substantially improves the catalytic performance for PDH over ZnO supported on Al2O3."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates how tuning oxidation states of ZnO affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that ZnO suffers from serious deactivation due to reduction to metallic Zn and addition of trace Pt substantially improves the activity and stability of ZnO catalysts by inhibiting the reduction of ZnO.

[1] "In order to further understand the dehydrogenation mechanism of propane on ZnO catalysts, DFT calculation on ZnO(1010), which was one of the most dominant surfaces of the ZnO particle, was selected as the model ZnO catalyst." 

[2] "Studies on gallium oxide have shown that GaH and GaOH species are difficult to regenerate, and the formation of H2 may be less favorable than water elimination, which limits the rate of dehydrogenation reaction and facilitates the reduction of gallium oxide. Similar behavior was observed on ZnO."

[3] "Therefore, it is not surprising that the 15Zn0.1Pt catalyst exhibited a higher propylene rate than the 15Zn catalyst, although both catalysts exhibited a similar amount of active sites. Hence, the results well illustrate that both H2 desorption and CH activation are promoted by platinum."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic scenario where propane dehydrogenation on ZnO involves dehydrogenation to form propylene and H species, which can recombine to H2 or eliminate as H2O. It shows addition of Pt promotes H2 desorption and CH activation steps.
