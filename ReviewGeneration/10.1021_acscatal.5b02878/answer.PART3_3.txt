[1] "A series of catalyst materials, including ZnO/Al2O3 and Pt-ZnO/Al2O3, have been prepared by an impregnation method (see section S1 in the Supporting Information), and their physicochemical properties and catalytic performance are illustrated in Table 1."

[2] "Figure 2 shows a HAADF-STEM image of the representative 15Zn0.1Pt catalyst particle, which exhibits the best catalytic performance. No Pt or ZnO crystallites were detected by analyzing the number of particles, indicating a high dispersion and small particle size."

[1] "Figure 2 shows a HAADF-STEM image of the representative 15Zn0.1Pt catalyst particle, which exhibits the best catalytic performance. No Pt or ZnO crystallites were detected by analyzing the number of particles, indicating a high dispersion and small particle size. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) further confirmed the uniform PtZn element distribution over the Al2O3 support."

[1] "To examine whether metallic zinc was present on the surface of the 15Zn and 15Zn0.1Pt catalysts, XPS characterization of fresh and spent catalysts was employed. The Zn L3M4.5M4.5 Auger peak was chosen because the change in the valence state from Zn2+ to Zn0 was observed as a pronounced 3 eV downward shift of the binding energy."

[2] "In Figure 3, both fresh 15Zn and 15Zn0.1Pt catalysts displayed only one obvious peak at 499 eV, which was assigned to Zn2+. After 4 h of PDH reaction, a pronounced shoulder feature appeared at 496 eV for the 15Zn catalyst, which was attributed to Zn0, while no similar feature was found for the 15Zn0.1Pt catalyst."

6. Yes, the article uses XPS to probe oxidation state changes of Zn during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows a shoulder peak appearing at 496 eV after reaction over 15Zn catalyst, indicating reduction of Zn2+ to Zn0, while no peak change is seen for 15Zn0.1Pt catalyst.
