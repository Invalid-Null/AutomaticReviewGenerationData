<Answer>
 Unfortunately, this literature review article does not actually discuss or provide any relevant analysis related to the questions asked. The questions are focused on process intensification, techno-economic analysis, safety issues, remaining challenges, computational catalyst screening, in-situ characterization, and novel catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation. However, the article is solely focused on reporting experimental results for a platinum-modified ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst. It does not address any of those broader topics or questions.
