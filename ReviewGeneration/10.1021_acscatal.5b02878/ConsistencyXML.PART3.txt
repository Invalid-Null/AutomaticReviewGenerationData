To determine the consistency ratio, I compared the English answers from each file to the correct English answers provided. I looked for semantic similarity in the key points addressed to determine if the answers fully matched the correct answer, partially matched, or did not match at all.

For each question, I gave a 100% consistency ratio if the provided answer fully matched the correct answer, 90% for highly similar answers with minor missing details, 80% for partial match but significant details missing, and 0% for completely inconsistent answers.

The XML structure organizes the consistency ratios by question number, with one <answer> tag per file specifying the filename and containing the percentage match text. Let me know if you have any other questions!
