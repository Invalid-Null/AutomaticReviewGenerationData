 Based on my review, the provided answers do not seem relevant to the questions asked. As instructed, I will respond with:

※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※

The answers focus on modeling and optimization of isobutane dehydrogenation, while the questions are about propane dehydrogenation. The answers do not address any of the specific topics asked about in the questions, such as process intensification approaches, techno-economic factors, safety issues, remaining challenges, use of computational methods, characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation.
