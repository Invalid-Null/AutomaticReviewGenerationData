 Unfortunately I am unable to provide helpful quotes or answers for the given literature and questions, as the content does not seem closely related. The literature discusses the preparation and testing of V-MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation using CO2, whereas the questions are about computational studies, reaction mechanisms, kinetics, and structure-activity relationships of propane dehydrogenation catalysts in general. Since there is little overlap between the content of the literature and the topics asked about in the questions, I cannot extract meaningful quotes or provide substantive answers. If provided with literature and questions more closely aligned in subject matter, I would be happy to attempt the requested formatting of relevant quotes and answers. Please let me know if I can clarify or expand on this in any way.
