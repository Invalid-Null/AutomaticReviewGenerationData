<quotes>
[1] "The nV-MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by a one-step hydrothermal synthesis."

[2] "With the one-step method, the active species can be directly incorporated into the pore channels and are better dispersed compared with the impregnation method, contributing to higher catalytic performance."

[3] "It is obvious that the 6.8V-MCM-41 catalyst has better V dispersion than the others, which is consistent with the XPS results."

[4] "The excellent catalytic performance could be related to highly dispersed V oxide on the large specific surface of MCM-41 with a highly ordered mesoporous structure, as described by the BET results."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It focuses on a one-step hydrothermal synthesis method to incorporate vanadium species into the MCM-41 framework, leading to better dispersion compared to impregnation. XPS and BET results confirm high dispersion of vanadium for the optimized 6.8V-MCM-41 catalyst.
