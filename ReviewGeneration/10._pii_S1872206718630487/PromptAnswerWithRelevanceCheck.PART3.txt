<quotes>
[1] "Metal-modified mesoporous silica can be synthesized by either a one-step co-condensation method or post-synthesis treatment. With the one-step method, the active species can be directly incorporated into the pore channels and are better dispersed compared with the impregnation method, contributing to higher catalytic performance."

[2] "The nV-MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by a one-step hydrothermal synthesis and applied to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) in the presence of CO2."

[3] "Because moderate amounts of V species were introduced into the framework of MCM-41, the catalyst maintained a large specific surface area, a highly ordered mesoporous structure, and highly dispersed V active sites (monomeric and dimeric V oxide species), while the high-vanadium-doping catalysts caused an enhancement in the number of acidic sites and V2O5 crystallites."
