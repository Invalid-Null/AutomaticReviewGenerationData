<quotes>
[1] "Metal-modified mesoporous silica can be synthesized by either a one-step co-condensation method or post-synthesis treatment. With the one-step method, the active species can be directly incorporated into the pore channels and are better dispersed compared with the impregnation method, contributing to higher catalytic performance."

[2] "The nV-MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by a one-step hydrothermal synthesis and applied to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) in the presence of CO2."

[3] "Because moderate amounts of V species were introduced into the framework of MCM-41, the catalyst maintained a large specific surface area, a highly ordered mesoporous structure, and highly dispersed V active sites (monomeric and dimeric V oxide species), while the high-vanadium-doping catalysts caused an enhancement in the number of acidic sites and V2O5 crystallites."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using a one-step hydrothermal synthesis method to incorporate vanadium species into the framework of MCM-41 mesoporous silica, which results in highly dispersed isolated vanadium oxide active sites compared to impregnation. The nV-MCM-41 catalysts prepared this way maintained high surface area and mesoporous structure.
