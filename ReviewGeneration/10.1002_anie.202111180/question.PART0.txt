Enhanced Reactivity of Accessible Protons in Sodalite Cages of Faujasite Zeolite
Graphical Abstract
Faujasite (FAU) zeolites (with Si/Al ratio of ca. 1.7) undergo mild dealumination at moderate ion exchange conditions (0.01 to 0.6M of NH4NO3 solutions) resulting in protons circumscribed by sodalite cages becoming accessible for reaction. The ratio of protons in sodalite cages (HSOD) to supercages (HSUP) can be manipulated by adjusting ammonium concentrations used in ion exchange.
Abstract
Faujasite (FAU) zeolites (with Si/Al ratio of ca. 1.7) undergo mild dealumination at moderate ion exchange conditions (0.01 to 0.6M of NH4NO3 solutions) resulting in protons circumscribed by sodalite cages becoming accessible for reaction without conspicuous changes to bulk crystallinity. The ratio of protons in sodalite cages (HSOD) to supercages (HSUP) can be systematically manipulated from 0 to ca. 1 by adjusting ammonium concentrations used in ion exchange. The fraction of accessible protons in the sodalite cages is assessed by virtue of infrared spectra for H-D exchange of deuterated propane based on the band area ratio of OD2620/OD2680 (ODSOD/ODSUP). Protons in sodalite cages (HSOD) show higher rate constants of propane dehydrogenation (kD) and cracking (kC) than protons in supercages (HSUP) plausibly due to confinement effects being more prominent in smaller voids. Rate constants of dehydrogenation and cracking including kD/kC ratios are also augmented as the fraction of accessible protons in the sodalite cages is enhanced. These effects of accessibility and reactivity of protons in sodalite cages hitherto inconspicuous are revealed herein via methods that systematically increase accessibility of cations located in sodalite cages.
Introduction
The three-dimensional microporous framework of Faujasite (FAU) zeolites is composed of supercages and sodalite cages, with the latter being connected via hexagonal prisms (Scheme1).1 The large pore size with a free diameter of 7.4Å for 12-membered ring (12-MR) channels, which constitute the aforementioned supercage, are primarily why FAU zeolites are utilized as catalysts for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC).2 As-synthesized Na-form FAU (Na-FAU) zeolites need to be transformed to H-form FAU (H-FAU) zeolites via ion exchange on non-framework cation positions to enable acid catalysis.1a Not infrequently, the high ammonium concentrations employed for ion exchange lead to partial framework collapse (e.g., 1M of aqueous NH4NO3 solution)3 or formation of intracrystalline mesopores (e.g., 3M of aqueous NH4Cl solution)4 by dissolution and removal of framework Al atoms.2b Correlating the structural changes of FAU frameworks caused by ion exchange and dealumination with its catalytic performance is stifled by the loss of crystallinity and emergence of amorphous phases,4, 5 and this in turn has resulted in strenuous research effort being devoted to developing controllable dealumination and ion exchange protocols that preserve crystallinity.1a, 2b, 5b, 6

Structure of faujasite framework with five types of non-framework cation positions (site I, I, II, II, and III). Adapted from ref.9. The secondary building units of faujasite framework materials, supercage, sodalite cage, and hexagonal prism are marked as blue, orange, and green, respectively.
We show that FAU zeolites undergo mild dealumination at moderate ion exchange conditions (0.01 to 0.6M of NH4NO3 solutions), leading to controllable opening of sodalite cages and rendering the associated protons, ones with catalytic properties distinct from protons in supercages of FAU zeolites, accessible. A combination of techniques, viz., probe molecule infrared spectroscopy, synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), Ar adsorption, 27Al and 29Si solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), are used to demonstrate that a fraction of sodalite cages permit influx/efflux and reactions of propane. The intermediate molecular size of propane (4.3Å)7 compared to the 6-MR window opening (2.6Å) and cavity diameter (6.6Å) of the sodalite cage (see Scheme1) led us to select H-D exchange of deuterated propane as a probe reaction to examine the accessibility and reactivity of protons in sodalite cages of FAU zeolites. Specifically, propane-accessible proton distributions in H-FAU zeolites herein are quantified via the infrared band area ratio of OD2620/OD2680 (i.e., ODSOD/ODSUP).8 Monomolecular H+-catalyzed probe reactions of propane facilitate comparison of dehydrogenation (kD) and cracking (kC) rate constants over the two kinds of protons (HSUP and HSOD). Both rates of propane dehydrogenation and propane cracking are prominently enhanced on HSOD in reference to HSUP plausibly due to enhanced confinement effects in smaller voids.10
Results and Discussion
Different levels of ammonium concentrations (i.e., 0.01M, 0.05M, 0.2M, 0.4M, and 0.6M) were selected to perform ion exchange. In all ion exchange experiments we used 0.25g zeolite per 40mL of ammonium solution. XRD patterns (Figure1(a)) show that all H-FAU zeolites preserve the FAU phase with high diffraction crystallinity upon ion exchange. SEM images (FigureS1) show that all H-FAU zeolites retain the morphology and size of as-synthesized zeolite particles. Ar-adsorption isotherms (Figure1(b)) show that the microporous volume of the FAU framework can be affected by the ammonium concentrations employed. An increase of overall pore volume is observed when the ammonium concentration is elevated to 0.2M and 0.4M (Figure1(b), FigureS2, Table1), and this trend does not continue at higher ammonium concentrations (H-FAU-0.6M). Limited by the small pore size of 6-MR with a free diameter of 2.6Å (Scheme1),1a intact sodalite cages are inaccessible for argon molecules with a molecular diameter of 3.4Å.11 We hypothesize that the enhanced microporous volume results from: (1)an enhancement in size of pore openings and accessible pore volume due to the replacement of Na+ with smaller H+ ions,12 and/or (2)sodalite cages made accessible by partial removal of framework Al atoms. 27Al solid-state MAS NMR spectra (FigureS3(a)) acquired subsequent to ion exchange with NH4NO3 reveal the formation of octahedral extra-framework Al (EFAl) on H-FAU zeolites,1a, 3 which affirms the occurrence of mild dealumination. 29Si solid-state MAS NMR spectra (FigureS3(b) and TableS1) were used to determine the distribution of Q4(nAl) Si species on FAU zeolites. The existence of Q2 Si species (a shoulder peak at ca. 88ppm)13 in these spectra also suggests mild dealumination of the framework occurs upon ion exchange. The framework Si/Al ratio of zeolite materials was calculated from these data with consideration of Loewenstein's rule14 prohibiting Al-O-Al linkages in the zeolite framework16 [Eq.1]:

[a]From ICP-OES analysis. [b]Framework Si/Al ratios are determined from 29Si MAS NMR data in accordance with Loewenstein's rule [Eq.(1)].14 [c]Calculated via a combination of bulk Si/Al ratio (column 2), Na/Al ratio (column 3), and framework Si/Al ratio (column 4), considering that the total number of T atoms per unit cell is 192 and each Na+ cation is coordinated with four water molecules.15 Extra-framework aluminum content is approximated as Al2O3 and provided along with the zeolite unit cell formula. All numbers that appear in chemical formulae are rounded to the nearest integer, except H and Al2O3 components. [d]Obtained from infrared spectra of pyridine adsorption (Figure1(c)). [e]Calculated by multiplying pyridine titrated H+ density (column 6) with molecular weight per unit cell using chemical formulae (column 5). [f]Obtained from analysis of argon-adsorption isotherms at 87K using a DFT model assuming spherical micropores and cylindrical mesopores.1a
An enhancement of framework Si/Al ratio on H-FAU zeolites compared to the parent Na-FAU zeolite was observed (Table1, column 4), reflecting the removal of framework Al atoms from H-FAU zeolites. The increase in microporous volume accompanying the formation of octahedral EFAl species on H-FAU zeolites indicates that mild dealumination takes place at moderate ion exchange conditions, which we hypothesize as the cause of accessible sodalite cages. Next, we describe probe molecule infrared studies that support this hypothesis.
Infrared spectra of dehydrated materials (FigureS4) can be used to differentiate proton locations in zeolites. The OH band at ca. 3640cm1 is ascribed to OH groups in supercages, while the OH band at ca. 3550cm1 is ascribed to OH groups in sodalite cages.1a, 17 Subtraction infrared spectra before and after pyridine adsorption are shown in FigureS5. The negative band at ca. 3550cm1 for H-FAU-0.05/0.2/0.4/0.6M (FigureS5) reflects perturbation of H+ sites in accessible sodalite cages by pyridine molecules (with a molecular diameter of 5.8Å).18 The absence of a negative band at ca. 3550cm1 for the H-FAU-0.01M (despite the presence of this band in the spectra of the dehydrated H-FAU-0.01M shown in FigureS4(a)) is attributed to the inaccessibility of its intact sodalite cages. Infrared spectra measured upon adsorption of pyridine (Figure1(c), FigureS6(b)) show that a band at ca. 1440cm1, ascribed to pyridine molecules adsorbed on Lewis acid sites (e.g. Na+ or Al3+),19 is only observed on Na-FAU and H-FAU-0.01M. The band at ca. 1540cm1 is ascribed to the interaction of pyridine with protons,1a and proton densities (Table1, column 6) can be assessed from the measured band area using the LambertBeer law and an extinction coefficient of 1.080.06cmμmol1 (FigureS7), which was calculated as described in the Section on Experimental Methods for Infrared Spectroscopy in the Supporting Information.17, 20
Non-framework cation positions on FAU zeolites can be divided into five types (site I, I, II, II, and III) based on their specific locations (Scheme1).21 Site I is located at the center of hexagonal prisms and is surrounded by six oxygen atoms from the two bases of prisms, cations on site I are inaccessible to guest molecules.22 For sites located within sodalite cages, site I is located on the external bases of prisms, and site II is located in the middle of 6-MR.21a, 21b For sites located within supercages, site II is located in the middle of 6-MR, and site III is located on the two neighboring 4-MRs.21a, 21b Charge repulsion exists between adjacent sites I and I, as well as adjacent sites II and II.22 Therefore, when cations fully occupy site II, site II is unoccupied by cations.21a, 22 Site III, which possesses the highest coordinative unsaturation due to the fewest number of proximal oxygen atoms on 4-MRs, is the least occupied as evidenced previously by Lamberti and co-workers.22
To describe the distribution of extra-framework cations (and protons), we first estimate cation distribution via a combination of elemental analysis (ICP-OES and 29Si MAS NMR) with infrared spectroscopy, and then we apply Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns to affirm the estimated cation distribution. Temperature-dependent in situ synchrotron XRD patterns (FiguresS8S9) show that intensities of diffraction peaks at low angles increase with the ramping temperature due to water removal, followed by stable diffraction intensities when water removal is complete. XRD patterns of Na-FAU and H-FAU-0.4M before and after dehydration (FiguresS10S11, S15S16, TablesS2S3, S7S8) reflect that sites II and III are occupied by H2O before dehydration, and H2O on these sites can be fully removed after dehydration. The absence of Na+ on site III is consistent with its low occupancy on high-silica FAU zeolites.21a As the NH4NO3 concentration increases, the number of H+ per unit cell increases (Table2, column 2). We consider the missing Na+ cations to be replaced by protons. As stated above, infrared spectra of dehydrated zeolites (FigureS4) can be used to differentiate protons within sodalite cages (ca. 3550cm1) and supercages (ca. 3640cm1).10a, 10b Extinction coefficients (ϵ) reported by Thibault-Starzyk etal.23 on FAU zeolites were used to calculate the ratio of protons circumscribed by sodalite cages (HSOD) and supercages (HSUP) via the ratio of (OH3550/ϵ3550)/(OH3640/ϵ3640) (Table2, column 3). The HSOD/HSUP ratio can be combined with the total H+ number per unit cell (Table2, column 2) to calculate HSOD and HSUP occupancies (Table2, columns 4 and 6), which can be applied for the subsequent XRD refinement analysis. HSOD and HSUP in Table2 are higher than the pyridine titrated H+ number per unit cell (Table1, column 7). We postulate this is because interactions between adsorbed pyridine species located within the same supercage,24 disallows all H+ sites to be titrated by pyridine simultaneously.

[a]Determined from chemical formulae (Table1, column 5) in accordance with results of 29Si MAS NMR and ICP-OES analysis. [b]Calculated from the equation of HSOD/HSUP=(OH3550/ϵ3550)/(OH3640/ϵ3640), and the infrared spectra of dehydrated H-FAU zeolites shown in FigureS4. Here, ϵ(OH)3640=6.76cmμmol1, and ϵ(OH)3550=5.39cmμmol1.1a, 23 [c]Calculated via combining the summation of HSOD+HSUP (namely H+ number, column 2) and the ratio of HSOD/HSUP (column 3). [d]Calculated by dividing specific H+ number per unit cell by the molecular weight using chemical formulae (Table1, column 5). [e]Obtained from infrared spectra of H-D exchange with deuterated propane over H-FAU zeolites at 623K (Figure2). ODSOD/ODSUP ratio is calculated from the ratio of (OD2620/ϵ2620)/(OD2680/ϵ2680), in which the band area ratio of OD2620/OD2680 is obtained from Figure2(g). We assume that the extinction coefficient ratio between protons with two kinds of locations (SOD and SUP) remains the same for both OD and OH groups, so that ϵ2620/ϵ2680=ϵ3550/ϵ3640=0.80. [f]Calculated as HSOD,accessible=HSUP × (ODSOD/ODSUP). We assume that ODSOD/ODSUP ratio represents the ratio of HSOD, accessible/HSUP, with the premise that H+ in supercages are accessible for C3D8 molecules.
Assuming that the Na+ fractional occupancy of site I (inaccessible) and site III (least occupied) remained invariant,29 we adjusted the occupancies of sites I and II to reflect the changes in Na+ in the sodalite cage and supercage, respectively. We then examined the above-determined distribution of non-framework cations for consistency with synchrotron XRD patterns via the Rietveld refinement analysis (TableS10, which is tabulated based on FiguresS10S17 and TablesS2S9), and two parameters (Rwp and Rp)25 are provided to evaluate the fidelity of refinement and affirm that XRD refinement analysis supports the cation distribution estimated by elemental analysis and infrared spectroscopy. HSOD/HSUP ratio on H-FAU-0.01M reached 0.36 (Table2), which means that ion exchange preferentially takes place within supercages at the mildest ion exchange conditions. HSOD/HSUP ratios on H-FAU zeolites treated with higher ammonium concentrations (0.2/0.4/0.6M) are ca. unity, implying that proton exchange at high ammonium concentrations no longer occurs preferentially within supercages.
H-D exchange of deuterated propane was selected to probe the accessibility of sodalite cages of the FAU framework, due to its intermediate molecular diameter (4.3Å) between the 6-MR window size (2.6Å) and the cavity diameter (6.6Å) of sodalite cages [Eq.2]:
(2)
After dosing a given pressure of C3D8 to the infrared cell operated in batch mode, appearance of the OD band was monitored (Figure2). The OD band at ca. 2680cm1 that appears upon H-D exchange could be correlated with the consumption of the OH band at ca. 3640cm1, and along the same lines the OD band at ca. 2620cm1 could be correlated with the consumption of the OH band at ca. 3550cm1 (FiguresS18S22).8 The H-FAU-0.01M zeolite contains protons within sodalite cages (with a HSOD/HSUP ratio of 0.36, Table2), and the absence of an OD band at ca. 2620cm1 (Figure2(b)) is because this material contains intact sodalite cages that are inaccessible to propane molecules. When the ammonium concentration employed for ion exchange was increased from 0.01M to 0.4M, the OD2620/OD2680 ratio increased monotonically (Figure2(g)), which reflects an increase in accessibility of sodalite cages. The somewhat lower OD2620/OD2680 ratio for H-FAU-0.6M compared to H-FAU-0.4M (Figure2(g)) is correlated with the decrease of microporous volume (Figure1(b)) attributed to partial structural collapse. As shown in Table2, we calculate site densities in accessible sodalite cages (HSOD, accessible) by multiplying site densities in supercages (HSUP) with the band area ratio of ODSOD/ODSUP. We assume that ODSOD/ODSUP ratio represents the ratio of HSOD, accessible/HSUP, since both cages are accessible for H-D exchange in reactions with C3D8. Propane, due to its smaller molecular size compared to pyridine, can titrate more H+ sites within accessible sodalite cages as shown in TableS11. Given that C3D8 shares the same molecular diameter as the probe molecule for monomolecular protolytic reactions (C3H8), we deem that fractions of accessible H+ sites in sodalite cages assessed via H-D exchange of deuterated propane are more reliable than those assessed via pyridine adsorption. Site densities in accessible sodalite cages (Table2, column 10) and supercages (Table2, column 7) will be used to determine rate constants for protolytic alkane dehydrogenation and cracking in the next section.

Molecular dehydrogenation and cracking of propane was employed as a diagnostic to test the relationship of proton reactivities with accessibility of cations circumscribed in sodalite cages on FAU zeolites [Eqs.3 and 4]:

(4)
A 7× difference in dehydrogenation rate constant on a per gram basis (kD,gcat) was observed between H-FAU-0.01M and H-FAU-0.4M from 818 to 893K (Figure3(a)), and a 5× difference in cracking rate constant on a per gram basis (kC,gcat) was observed between H-FAU-0.01M and H-FAU-0.6M (Figure3(b)). Herein, we postulate that the enhanced accessibility of sodalite cages increases the fraction of HSOD, accessible in the overall accessible proton densities, consequently leading to the increase of proton reactivities for molecular H+-catalyzed reactions of propane. H-FAU-0.01M only contains HSUP (Table2). Therefore, the kC and kD determined for this zeolite correspond to kC,SUP and kD,SUP, respectively. The specific contributions of HSOD,accessible to measured rate constants (kC,SOD and kD,SOD) for the other H-FAU zeolites were determined from Equation5:

Analysis of rate constants for molecular cracking and dehydrogenation of propane over H-FAU zeolites. Temperature dependence of rate constants on a per gram basis for a)dehydrogenation and b)cracking over H-FAU zeolites. c)Rate constants of kD,SOD, kC,SOD, kD,SUP, and kC,SUP (on a per proton basis specific to sodalite cages and supercages) over H-FAU zeolites. Reaction conditions: C3H8/Ar/He=3/1.5/21, with a total pressure of 110kPa and a total flow rate of 25.5 sccm, and space velocity=3600cm3 gcat1h1. Propane conversions are <1%. Standard deviations of kD,SOD and kC,SOD are provided in (c).
The values of HSUP and HSOD,accessible used in Equation(5) are listed in Table2. The procedure for their calculation has been described above and is summarized for convenience in FigureS23. Rate constants for H+ in sodalite cages, kC,SOD and kD,SOD are also shown in FigureS23, and their averages are given in Figure3(c). Protons in accessible sodalite cages exhibit higher averaged rate constants (on a per proton basis) for both propane dehydrogenation [Eq.(3)] and propane cracking [Eq.(4)] reactions than protons in supercages. Iglesia and co-workers10 reported that for mordenite (MOR) zeolites, protons in 8-MR pockets exhibited higher rate constants than protons in 12-MR channels for monomolecular alkane cracking and dehydrogenation due to spatial constraints imposed by 8-MR pockets. They explained that a lower free energy for transition states within small 8-MR side pockets originated from entropic gains compensating for enthalpic penalties caused by spatial confinement of propane molecules within smaller 8-MR voids.10 Herein, we attribute the enhanced rate constants of HSOD, accessible to spatial confinement within smaller sodalite cages (with a cavity diameter of 6.6Å) than in supercages (with a cavity diameter of 12.5Å) of FAU zeolites. Differences in Brnsted acid site strength, as reflected by the deprotonation energies (DPE) of these aluminosilicates are not expected to be a major contributor26 and we do not attempt to quantitate them here.
It is also observed that kD/kC ratios on HSOD, accessible (ca. 7) are higher than those on HSUP (ca. 4), implying that monomolecular dehydrogenation is promoted to a greater extent than monomolecular cracking within smaller sodalite cages in line with results reported by Iglesia and co-workers10c, 10d with the underlying premise that the variation in kD/kC ratio reflects preferential stabilization of monomolecular propane dehydrogenation transition states due to partial confinement.
Apparent enthalpic (Ea) and entropic (ΔSa) barriers for propane dehydrogenation can be calculated from temperature dependence of dehydrogenation rate constants in Figure3(c) via Equations6 and 7:27

(7)
in which nb, kB, and h represent the number of CH bonds (8 for propane),10c, 28 Boltzmann's constant, and Planck's constant. As shown in Table3, Ea and ΔSa for propane dehydrogenation over HSUP are 48.91.0kJmol1 and 210.01.2Jmol1K1 respectively, while counterparts over HSOD are 39.00.6kJmol1 and 217.00.6Jmol1K1 respectively. From Figure3(a), it is evident that the activation energy for dehydrogenation is lower in H-FAU-0.4M than that of the other tested catalysts. This can be attributed to HSOD having a lower Ea than HSUP for propane dehydrogenation, and H-FAU-0.4M having the highest fraction of accessible HSOD (HSOD, accessible/H+), as can be calculated from Table2 (HSOD, accessible in column 9, and H+ in column 2).

The measured apparent enthalpic (or entropic) barriers reflect the enthalpy (or entropy) difference between the dehydrogenation transition state (TS) in the intrazeolitic phase, and gas-phase propane and bare H+ [Eqs.8 and 9]:
(8)
(9)
Apparent enthalpic barriers for protolytic reactions are lower while the corresponding entropic barriers are higher in the sodalite cages in reference to H+ sites in supercages (Table3). These enthalpic-entropic tradeoffs are characteristic of H+ sites circumscribed in small pore cages and windows of zeolitic solids and have been reported previously for H-MOR materials.10e, 27, 29 The lower Ea and ΔSa values for propane dehydrogenation relative to protolytic cracking reflect preferential stabilization of monomolecular propane dehydrogenation transition states due to partial confinement,10e, 27 which is consistent with the higher kD/kC ratios on HSOD, accessible than HSUP as discussed above.
In summary, we illustrate ion exchange procedures that open 6-membered ring zeolite apertures, which are normally inaccessible due to their small openings (2.6Å). This is achieved without loss of bulk crystallinity or porosity. Specifically, for FAU-type Y zeolite materials, a formulation that is used industrially for fluid catalytic cracking and alkylation, mild/moderate ion exchange protocols confer accessible protons of higher reactivity and specificity within sodalite cages. This work indicates that moderate ion exchange can be used as a general strategy for exploring molecular sieving effects on adsorption and reaction proffered by small channels, windows, and pores in zeolites that were considered inaccessible or unstable under typical ion exchange conditions and, as such, broaden the tools available to tune activity and selectivity in zeolite catalysis.
Conclusion
FAU zeolites undergo mild dealumination at moderate ion exchange conditions (0.010.6M of aqueous NH4NO3 solutions; 0.25g zeolite per 40mL solution), resulting in controlled/partial access to proton sites in sodalite cages, as inferred from the infrared OD2620/OD2680 band area ratios acquired by virtue of H-D exchange with deuterated propane. We find that protons in accessible sodalite cages are more reactive than protons in supercages, and that enhanced proton reactivities (on a per gram basis) for partially-dealuminated FAU materials arises from the increasing fraction of HSOD in the overall accessible proton densities. We posit that the enhanced reactivity for HSOD over HSUP is due to spatial constrains in smaller voids. In addition, the enhanced accessibility of sodalite cages increases the selectivity of dehydrogenation to cracking (kD/kC ratio) during monomolecular protolytic reactions of propane, implying that confinement within smaller sodalite cages preferentially stabilizes transition states for dehydrogenation.
