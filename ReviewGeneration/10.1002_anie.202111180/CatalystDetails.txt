The document is relevant to propane dehydrogenation as it studies H-FAU zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and cracking reactions. 

The only catalyst mentioned is H-FAU zeolites, with protons (H+) as the active species supported on the zeolite material. No other details like conversion, selectivity, deactivation rates etc. are provided.

H-FAU zeolites are identified as the main contribution based on the focus of the manuscript being on demonstrating enhanced reactivity and selectivity of protons in the sodalite cages of H-FAU zeolites compared to the supercages.
