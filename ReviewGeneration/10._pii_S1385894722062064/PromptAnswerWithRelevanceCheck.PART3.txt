[1] The XAS analyses of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts as well as references of Co foil and CoO afforded the structural information of Co sites in the aspect of electronic property and coordination environment.

[2] The Co K-edge XANES spectra demonstrated that Co2+ state still dominated over two spent catalysts due to unchanged edge energy value (7725 eV), as shown in Fig. 4A. In addition, slightly reduced edge height reflected that the Co electron density was increased, which might be related to the partial reduction of Co2+ species during the reaction.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
6. Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows that Co2+ is the dominant state in fresh and spent Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts based on the Co K-edge energy. The edge height change indicates partial reduction of Co2+ occurs during the reaction.

[1] The Co@Si-BEA catalyst also demonstrates a great long-term catalytic stability in eight-time reaction-regeneration recycling test, not only highlighting the high structural stability of the catalyst active sites but also illustrating the reversible deactivation phenomenon caused by coke deposition.

[2] Furthermore, since the characteristics of neither CoO reference (R = 2.6 Å for Co-(O)-Co bond) nor spinel Co3O4 reference (R = 2.5 and 3.0 Å for Co-(O)-Co bonds) were matched with the spectra of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA, the aggregated Co oxides could also be absent in the catalysts [18].

<quotes>

[1] The variation in the d302 value indicated the incorporation of Co cations into the BEA zeolites [29].

[2] From the FT- and WT-EXAFS spectra, as represented in Fig. 4B and 4H, the scattering signal of the second shell Co-(O)-Co coordination at R = 2.7 Å and with CN = 3.0 ± 0.5 was emerged for replacing or covering the signal of Co-(O)-Si coordination that was obtained on the fresh catalyst, which suggested that ultra-small CoO nanocluster was formed through reductive structuring of Co2+ cations within the PDH reaction.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It shows that dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst formed ultra-small CoO nanoclusters during the reaction, evidenced by the emergence of a Co-(O)-Co coordination signal in EXAFS (Quote 2).
