I manually compared the answers in each file to the correct answers and assessed the consistency, expressing it as a percentage match. For questions where there were no relevant quotes provided and the answers stated there was no relevant information, I marked those as 100% consistent. For the other questions, I checked if the key details provided in the correct answers were also presented in each of the answer files.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
