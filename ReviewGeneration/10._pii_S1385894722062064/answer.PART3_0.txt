<quotes>
[1] The isolated Co2+ cations, which are anchored in the zeolite micropores through interaction with the silanol groups generated within dealumination process, dominate over the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst, as evidenced by a series of infrared, X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectral characterizations.

[2] The stable and unreducible Co2+ cations serve as the catalytically active sites exhibiting a high propylene selectivity of over 93 % in the PDH reaction at 590 °C.

2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It shows that isolated Co2+ cations anchored in dealuminated zeolite micropores serve as stable and selective sites for propane dehydrogenation. These isolated Co2+ sites in Co@Si-BEA give >93% propylene selectivity at 590°C.

[1] With BEA (Si/Al = 20) and dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite as supports, the supported Co2+ catalysts are prepared by vacuum impregnation method and attempted in nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. 

[2] Limited by the capability of the zeolites for accommodation of Co2+ cations, low Co loadings of the Co@Si-BEA catalysts allowed the Co atoms to be highly dispersed as isolated Co2+ cations, whereas high loadings led to aggregation of Co atoms into Co3O4 assembles.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using vacuum impregnation to prepare Co2+ catalysts on BEA and dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite supports. Low Co loadings give high dispersion of isolated Co2+ cations, while high loadings lead to Co3O4 aggregation.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
3. 答:是的,文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它讨论了在BEA和除铝Si-BEA分子筛支持上使用真空浸渍制备Co2+催化剂。低的Co负载量给出了隔离Co2+阳离子的高度分散,而高负载量导致Co3O4聚集。

[1] The state of the Co species in these zeolite-supported catalysts were characterized by XPS and UV-vis-DR spectra as well as H2-TPR profiles.

[2] The XAS analyses of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts as well as references of Co foil and CoO afforded the structural information of Co sites in the aspect of electronic property and coordination environment.

[3] The in-situ DRIFT spectra of temperature-programmed C3H6 desorption were monitored to explore the interaction between C3H6 and two Co catalysts in the temperature range of 30–330 °C.

<English version answer>
4. Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques including UV-vis-DR, H2-TPR, XAS, and in-situ DRIFTS to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. These techniques provide insights into the oxidation state, coordination environment, and C3H6 interaction with Co active sites during propane dehydrogenation.

[1] The XAS analyses of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts as well as references of Co foil and CoO afforded the structural information of Co sites in the aspect of electronic property and coordination environment.

[2] The Co K-edge XANES spectra demonstrated that Co2+ state still dominated over two spent catalysts due to unchanged edge energy value (7725 eV), as shown in Fig. 4A. In addition, slightly reduced edge height reflected that the Co electron density was increased, which might be related to the partial reduction of Co2+ species during the reaction.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
6. Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows that Co2+ is the dominant state in fresh and spent Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts based on the Co K-edge energy. The edge height change indicates partial reduction of Co2+ occurs during the reaction.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
6. 答:是的,文章使用X射线吸收光谱(XAS)来探究丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。它显示新鲜和使用后的Co@BEA和Co@Si-BEA催化剂中优势状态都是Co2+,这是根据Co K边能量推断的。边缘高度的变化表明Co2+在反应过程中发生了部分还原。
