         [1] "With BEA (Si/Al = 20) and dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite as supports, the supported Co2+ catalysts are prepared by vacuum impregnation method and attempted in nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions."
         [2] "The isolated Co2+ cations, which are anchored in the zeolite micropores through interaction with the silanol generated within dealumination process, dominate over the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst, as evidenced by a series of infrared, X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectral characterizations."

      <English>
         Yes, the article describes using dealumination to generate isolated silanol groups in the zeolite support, and then immobilizing isolated Co2+ cations at these sites via vacuum impregnation.

         [1] The Co@Si-BEA catalyst also demonstrates a great long-term catalytic stability in eight-time reaction-regeneration recycling test, not only highlighting the high structural stability of the catalyst active sites but also illustrating the reversible deactivation phenomenon caused by coke deposition.
         [2] Furthermore, since the characteristics of neither CoO reference (R = 2.6 Å for Co-(O)-Co bond) nor spinel Co3O4 reference (R = 2.5 and 3.0 Å for Co-(O)-Co bonds) were matched with the spectra of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA, the aggregated Co oxides could also be absent in the catalysts [18].

         Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. Co@Si-BEA demonstrates great long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles. X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows the absence of aggregated Co oxides, indicating encapsulation of isolated Co species.

         [1] The Co@Si-BEA catalysts with different Co loadings (0.1-5.0 wt%) were prepared by identical vacuum impregnation method for evaluating the relationship between their intrinsic activity and Co loading/state. 
         [2] By calculated the fitted band areas, the ratios of ID1/IG were obtained as 0.77 and 0.95 for the spent Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalyst, respectively. A higher ID1/IG ratio of Co@Si-BEA catalyst highlighted its lower graphitization degree for the coke species.

         Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It prepared Co@Si-BEA catalysts with Co loadings from 0.1-5 wt% by vacuum impregnation and showed the 0.1-0.5 wt% samples had the highest intrinsic activity due to well dispersed isolated Co2+ sites (Quote 1). It also showed the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst produced less graphitic coke than non-dealuminated Co@BEA (Quote 2).

         [1] X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments, including X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), were performed at BL-11B, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facilities (SSRF).
         [2] According to the FT-EXAFS and WT-EXAFS spectra of the spent Co@Si-BEA catalyst (Fig. 4B and 4H), there still was a single signal corresponding to the first shell Co-O bond with an almost unchanged coordination environment (CN = 5.7 ± 0.3), which confirmed that the incorporated Co2+ cations, acting as predominant Co active sites, were structurally stable against the PDH reaction.
