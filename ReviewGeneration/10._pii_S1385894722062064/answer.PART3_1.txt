[1] The Co@Si-BEA catalyst also demonstrates a great long-term catalytic stability in eight-time reaction-regeneration recycling test, not only highlighting the high structural stability of the catalyst active sites but also illustrating the reversible deactivation phenomenon caused by coke deposition.

[2] Furthermore, since the characteristics of neither CoO reference (R = 2.6 Å for Co-(O)-Co bond) nor spinel Co3O4 reference (R = 2.5 and 3.0 Å for Co-(O)-Co bonds) were matched with the spectra of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA, the aggregated Co oxides could also be absent in the catalysts [18].

2. The article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. Co@Si-BEA demonstrates great long-term catalytic stability in eight reaction-regeneration cycles. X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows the absence of aggregated Co oxides, indicating encapsulation of isolated Co species.

[1] The Co@Si-BEA catalysts with different Co loadings (0.1-5.0 wt%) were prepared by identical vacuum impregnation method for evaluating the relationship between their intrinsic activity and Co loading/state.

[2] Limited by the capability of the zeolites for accommodation of Co2+ cations, low Co loadings of the Co@Si-BEA catalysts allowed the Co atoms to be highly dispersed as isolated Co2+ cations, whereas high loadings led to aggregation of Co atoms into Co3O4 assembles.

[1] X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments, including X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), were performed at BL-11B, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facilities (SSRF). For the Co K edge signals, transmission mode was adopted using gas ion chamber detectors and the X-ray beam photon energy was calibrated with 7709 eV E0 for Co foil spectrum.

[2] The XAS analyses of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts as well as references of Co foil and CoO afforded the structural information of Co sites in the aspect of electronic property and coordination environment.

6. The article uses X-ray based techniques like XANES and EXAFS to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It performs XAS on fresh and spent Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalysts, revealing isolated Co2+ cations are the active sites and some restructure to nanoclusters under reaction.
