<quotes>
[1] "In this work, BEA zeolite with connected 12-membered rings is adopted as the ideal support of Co sites in consideration of the advantages of its higher stability at high Si amount and larger pore size than MFI-type zeolites [29], [30], [31], [32]."

[2] "With BEA (Si/Al = 20) and dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite as supports, the supported Co2+ catalysts are prepared by vacuum impregnation method and attempted in nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions."  

[3] "The effects of dealumination pretreatment on the BEA zeolite support are investigated with respect to structural property of Co2+ active sites and surface acid sites as well as the catalytic PDH performance."

[4] "The isolated Co2+ cations, which are anchored in the zeolite micropores through interaction with the silanol generated within dealumination process, dominate over the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst, as evidenced by a series of infrared, X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectral characterizations."

[5] "The stable and unreducible Co2+ cations serve as the catalytically active sites exhibiting a high propylene selectivity of over 93 % in the PDH reaction at 590 C."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates the BEA zeolite support for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It adopts BEA with 12-membered rings as the ideal support considering its higher stability and larger pore size compared to MFI zeolites. The article prepares supported Co2+ catalysts on BEA and dealuminated Si-BEA zeolites, and investigates the effects of dealumination pretreatment. The isolated Co2+ cations anchored in the micropores through interaction with silanol groups are identified as the active sites exhibiting high propylene selectivity (>93%) in PDH at 590°C.

答:是的,本文评估了BEA沸石用于丙烷脱氢催化剂的支持作用。它采用了12员环的BEA作为理想支持,因为相比MFI沸石它具有更高的稳定性和更大的孔径。本文在BEA和脱铝Si-BEA沸石上制备了 Supported Co2+催化剂,并研究了脱铝预处理的效果。锚定在微孔内通过与硅醇基团相互作用的隔离Co2+阳离子被确定为活性位点,在590°C下PDH反应中展现出高丙烯选择性(>93%)。
