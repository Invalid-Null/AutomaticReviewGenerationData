 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes in the given literature to answer the specific questions asked. Since the questions are seeking very detailed and quantitative information on computational studies, microkinetic modeling, and structure-activity relationships for propane dehydrogenation catalysts, which this review article does not contain, I cannot provide substantive answers. The article focuses on an experimental catalyst development study.

[1] AbstractHighlights
•
Isolated Co2+ as active sites are anchored in micropores of dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite.
•
Co@Si-BEA exhibits high single-pass propylene yield and recycling stability in PDH reaction.
•
Co@Si-BEA prefers propane CH activation rather than CC scission.
•
Favorable propylene chemisorption properties promote its desorption for high product selectivity.

[2] Propylene steadily increasing demand requires further capacity expansion through efficient production processes not limited to the conventional fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha. Benefited from the mass exploitation of shale gas resource, catalytically nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been recently developed as an available complement to produce propylene [1]. For propane dehydrogenation (PDH), two main groups of commercial catalysts have been applied, including PtSn/Al2O3- and CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts from Oleflex and Catofin craft, respectively [2], [3], [4]. However, considering of their existing drawbacks, i.e., high cost, high toxicity, and low cycling life, it is necessary to screen the alternative catalysts with rationally designed structure and satisfactory performance [5], [6].

[3] The isolated Co2+ cations, which are anchored in the zeolite micropores through interaction with the silanol groups generated within dealumination process, dominate over the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst, as evidenced by a series of infrared, X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectral characterizations. The stable and unreducible Co2+ cations serve as the catalytically active sites exhibiting a high propylene selectivity of over 93 % in the PDH reaction at 590 C.
