[1] "With BEA (Si/Al = 20) and dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite as supports, the supported Co2+ catalysts are prepared by vacuum impregnation method and attempted in nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions."

[2] "The isolated Co2+ cations, which are anchored in the zeolite micropores through interaction with the silanol generated within dealumination process, dominate over the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst, as evidenced by a series of infrared, X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectral characterizations."

[3] "The stable and unreducible Co2+ cations serve as the catalytically active sites exhibiting a high propylene selectivity of over 93 % in the PDH reaction at 590 C."

<English version answer>

1. Yes, the article describes using dealumination to generate isolated silanol groups in the zeolite support, and then immobilizing isolated Co2+ cations at these sites via vacuum impregnation. 

2. No, the article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports.

3. Yes, the article investigates using vacuum impregnation at low Co loadings to disperse isolated Co2+ sites in the dealuminated zeolite.

4. Yes, the article uses in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy to study the isolated Co2+ sites during propane dehydrogenation. 

5. No, the article does not use advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces.

6. Yes, the article uses XANES and EXAFS to show that the Co2+ sites are stable during propane dehydrogenation without oxidizing.

7. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types.

8. No, the article does not provide insights into scale-up considerations.
