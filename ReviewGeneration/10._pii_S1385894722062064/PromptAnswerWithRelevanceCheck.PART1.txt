[1] "With BEA (Si/Al = 20) and dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite as supports, the supported Co2+ catalysts are prepared by vacuum impregnation method and attempted in nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions."

[2] "The optimal 0.5 wt% Co@Si-BEA catalyst exhibits over 93 % selectivity to propylene, high single-pass yield and great regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions at 590 C."

[3] "Co@Si-BEA catalyst prefers propane CH activation rather than CC scission."  

[4] "The isolated Co2+ cations, which are anchored in the zeolite micropores through interaction with the silanol groups generated within dealumination process, dominate over the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates a supported mono-metallic Co catalyst (Co@Si-BEA) for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing the 0.5 wt% Co@Si-BEA catalyst achieves over 93% propylene selectivity and high single-pass yield at 590°C. The active sites are identified as isolated Co2+ cations anchored in the dealuminated zeolite micropores, which prefer propane CH activation over CC bond scission.

[1] "The Si-BEA zeolite without Al species was obtained from the dealumination treatment of the commercial BEA zeolite with a Si/Al ratio of ∼ 20. The Co catalysts of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA were prepared through the vacuum impregnation method using supports of the BEA zeolites with/without Al species."

[2] "The isolated Co2+ cations, which are anchored in the zeolite micropores through interaction with the silanol groups generated within dealumination process, dominate over the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst, as evidenced by a series of infrared, X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectral characterizations."

[3] "The stable and unreducible Co2+ cations serve as the catalytically active sites exhibiting a high propylene selectivity of over 93% in the PDH reaction at 590 °C."

[4] "The temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) result further reveals their preference to the activation of CH bonds with suppressing the cleavage of CC bonds in propane."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
4. The article explores metal-support interfacial effects in Co-BEA zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It investigates how dealumination of the BEA zeolite support affects the structure and catalytic performance of supported Co catalysts. Dealumination generates silanol groups that anchor isolated Co2+ cations in the zeolite micropores. These stable Co2+ sites selectively activate C-H bonds over C-C bonds in propane, leading to high propylene selectivity.

4. 该文探索了Co-BEA沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的金属-载体界面效应。它研究了对BEA沸石载体脱铝化处理如何影响负载Co催化剂的结构和催化性能。脱铝化生成硅醇基团,使隔离的Co2+阳离子锚定在沸石微孔中。这些稳定的Co2+位点优先活化丙烷中的C-H键,而不是C-C键,导致高丙烯选择性。

[1] "The Si-BEA zeolite without Al species was obtained from the dealumination treatment of the commercial BEA zeolite with a Si/Al ratio of ∼ 20. The Co catalysts of Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA were prepared through the vacuum impregnation method using supports of the BEA zeolites with/without Al species." 

[2] "Limited by the capability of the zeolites for accommodation of Co2+ cations, low Co loadings of the Co@Si-BEA catalysts allowed the Co atoms to be highly dispersed as isolated Co2+ cations, whereas high loadings led to aggregation of Co atoms into Co3O4 assembles."

[3] "At low loading levels (i.e., <1.0 wt%), most of Co species existed in isolated Co2+ cations and linear relationship between Co2+ amount and specific reaction rate could be achieved."

[4] "Therefore, as evidenced by the linear correspondence with intrinsic activity, the Co2+ cations of Co@Si-BEA catalyst could act as the primary active sites in PDH reaction."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
5. The article evaluates supported mono-metallic Co catalysts on dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that at low Co loadings (<1 wt%), isolated Co2+ cations are highly dispersed in the zeolite micropores. A linear relationship between Co2+ content and reaction rate confirms these cations are the primary active sites. At higher loadings, Co atoms aggregate into inactive Co3O4 particles.

5. 该文评估了负载在脱铝Si-BEA沸石上的单金属Co催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它显示在低Co负载(<1 wt%)下,隔离的Co2+阳离子在沸石微孔中高度分散。Co2+含量与反应速率之间的线性关系确认这些阳离子是主要活性位点。在更高的负载量下,Co原子会聚集成为无活性的Co3O4颗粒。
