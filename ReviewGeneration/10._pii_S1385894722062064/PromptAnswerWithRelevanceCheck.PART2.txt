<quotes>
[1] "In this work, BEA zeolite with connected 12-membered rings is adopted as the ideal support of Co sites in consideration of the advantages of its higher stability at high Si amount and larger pore size than MFI-type zeolites [29], [30], [31], [32]."

[2] "With BEA (Si/Al = 20) and dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite as supports, the supported Co2+ catalysts are prepared by vacuum impregnation method and attempted in nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions."  

[3] "The effects of dealumination pretreatment on the BEA zeolite support are investigated with respect to structural property of Co2+ active sites and surface acid sites as well as the catalytic PDH performance."

[4] "The isolated Co2+ cations, which are anchored in the zeolite micropores through interaction with the silanol generated within dealumination process, dominate over the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst, as evidenced by a series of infrared, X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectral characterizations."

[5] "The stable and unreducible Co2+ cations serve as the catalytically active sites exhibiting a high propylene selectivity of over 93 % in the PDH reaction at 590 C."
