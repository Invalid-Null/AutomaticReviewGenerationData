<quotes>

[1] The variation in the d302 value indicated the incorporation of Co cations into the BEA zeolites [29].

[2] From the FT- and WT-EXAFS spectra, as represented in Fig. 4B and 4H, the scattering signal of the second shell Co-(O)-Co coordination at R = 2.7 Å and with CN = 3.0 ± 0.5 was emerged for replacing or covering the signal of Co-(O)-Si coordination that was obtained on the fresh catalyst, which suggested that ultra-small CoO nanocluster was formed through reductive structuring of Co2+ cations within the PDH reaction.

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It shows that dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst formed ultra-small CoO nanoclusters during the reaction, evidenced by the emergence of a Co-(O)-Co coordination signal in EXAFS (Quote 2). This helped stabilize the active Co species compared to non-dealuminated Co@BEA (Quote 1).

[1] The Co@Si-BEA catalysts with different Co loadings (0.1-5.0 wt%) were prepared by identical vacuum impregnation method for evaluating the relationship between their intrinsic activity and Co loading/state.

[2] By calculated the fitted band areas, the ratios of ID1/IG were obtained as 0.77 and 0.95 for the spent Co@BEA and Co@Si-BEA catalyst, respectively. A higher ID1/IG ratio of Co@Si-BEA catalyst highlighted its lower graphitization degree for the coke species.

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It prepared Co@Si-BEA catalysts with Co loadings from 0.1-5 wt% by vacuum impregnation and showed the 0.1-0.5 wt% samples had the highest intrinsic activity due to well dispersed isolated Co2+ sites (Quote 1). It also showed the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst produced less graphitic coke than non-dealuminated Co@BEA (Quote 2).

[1] X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments, including X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), were performed at BL-11B, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facilities (SSRF). 

[2] According to the FT-EXAFS and WT-EXAFS spectra of the spent Co@Si-BEA catalyst (Fig. 4B and 4H), there still was a single signal corresponding to the first shell Co-O bond with an almost unchanged coordination environment (CN = 5.7 ± 0.3), which confirmed that the incorporated Co2+ cations, acting as predominant Co active sites, were structurally stable against the PDH reaction.

6. Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It performed XANES and EXAFS at a synchrotron source on fresh and spent catalysts (Quote 1). The EXAFS showed the active Co2+ sites in Co@Si-BEA remained stable after reaction with no oxidation state change (Quote 2).
