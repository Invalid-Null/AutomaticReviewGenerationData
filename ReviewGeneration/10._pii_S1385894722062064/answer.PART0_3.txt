 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes in the given literature to answer the specific questions asked. Since the questions are seeking very detailed and quantitative information on computational studies, microkinetic modeling, and structure-activity relationships for propane dehydrogenation catalysts, which this review article does not contain, I cannot provide substantive answers. The article focuses on an experimental catalyst development study.
