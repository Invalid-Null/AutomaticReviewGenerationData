<quotes>
[1] "With BEA (Si/Al = 20) and dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite as supports, the supported Co2+ catalysts are prepared by vacuum impregnation method and attempted in nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions."

[2] "The effects of dealumination pretreatment on the BEA zeolite support are investigated with respect to structural property of Co2+ active sites and surface acid sites as well as the catalytic PDH performance."  

[3] "The isolated Co2+ cations, which are anchored in the zeolite micropores through interaction with the silanol generated within dealumination process, dominate over the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst, as evidenced by a series of infrared, X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectral characterizations."

[4] "The stable and unreducible Co2+ cations serve as the catalytically active sites exhibiting a high propylene selectivity of over 93 % in the PDH reaction at 590 C."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates the BEA zeolite support for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It prepares cobalt-based catalysts supported on BEA zeolite with Si/Al ratio of 20, as well as dealuminated BEA zeolite, using a vacuum impregnation method. The effects of dealumination on the structure and performance of the catalysts are investigated. Isolated Co2+ cations anchored in the micropores of dealuminated BEA are identified as the active sites exhibiting 93% propylene selectivity at 590°C in propane dehydrogenation.

<English version answer>
Answer: No, the article does not investigate the effects of tuning zeolite Si/Al ratio beyond using a dealuminated BEA zeolite, or incorporating mesoporosity on propane dehydrogenation catalyst performance. No specific examples or structure-function relationships related to varying Si/Al ratio or mesoporosity are revealed.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 否,该文并没有研究调节沸石Si/Al比(除了使用除铝BEA沸石)或引入介孔对丙烷脱氢反应催化剂性能的影响。文中也没有提供调变Si/Al比或引入介孔的具体实例或结构-性能关系。
