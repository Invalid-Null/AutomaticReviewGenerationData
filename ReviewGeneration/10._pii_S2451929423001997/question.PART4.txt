The bigger picture
Redox is one of the basic reactions that functions in both the natural environment and human society, and it constitutes the cornerstone of numerous biological, chemical, energy, and environmental systems. Thereinto, metal oxide provides a compact, safe, and affordable container for chemical energy and plays a dominant role in artificial redox devices for energy conversion and storage. Decoupling oxidation and reduction by space or time is key to the controllable conversion of chemical energy (e.g., rechargeable battery and hydrogen storage materials). Chemical looping is another recently emerging redox technique that has the potential to efficiently produce a variety of platform chemicals, including light olefins. Herein, we clarified the dynamic redox process of vanadia and realized a controllable redox process by virtue of doping. We have found that the delocalization of the doping effect is key to adjusting the redox performance and efficiently producing the targeted chemical.
Summary
Redox chemistry plays an important role in the precise production of targeted valuable chemicals. However, achieving accurate control of the redox process still lacks the guidance of mechanistic insight. This paper describes how doping can enhance redox performance of vanadia for chemical looping oxidative propane dehydrogenation. By elucidating the dynamic redox process of vanadia, we discovered that molybdenum (Mo) dopant lowers the phase transformation barrier from defective V2O5 toward VO2. In the VO2 phase, Mo doping modulates chemical properties of every oxygen atom, while doping in V2O5 only affects the oxygen atoms that directly bond with the dopants. Charge analysis indicated that the conductive nature of VO2 delocalizes charge within the lattice and alters the overall chemical properties. Experiments confirmed that Mo-doped VO2 is the dominant phase during the redox process, exhibiting the best catalytic performance. Hence, delocalization could be key to future chemical applications of efficiently doped materials.

Introduction
Oriented production of valuable chemicals from inexpensive and readily available raw materials has been an enduring topic in the chemistry community. The production of light olefins, a type of platform chemicals, has been driven by the development of alkane dehydrogenation technology in response to the shale gas boom.1,2 Industrial alkane dehydrogenation, as an exceedingly endothermic reaction, requires high operation temperatures to shift the equilibrium toward the desired product alkene. However, elevated temperatures also promote side reactions such as CC cleavage, which could lead to coking.3,4 Hence, addressing the thermodynamics limitation is crucial in developing next-generation propane dehydrogenation catalysts that can operate at relatively low temperatures.
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH)5,6,7 is a promising strategy to break the thermodynamical limitation by introducing an additional oxidant to convert alkane to alkene. The chemical looping ODH (CL-ODH) technique8,9,10 is a moderate dehydrogenation technique that avoids direct contact between gaseous oxygen and light alkanes. The oxide, which serves as oxygen carrier in CL-ODH, delivers the oxygen atom of oxidant from oxidation reactor to reduction reactor, where propane is oxidized. The typical ODH catalyst vanadia possesses high surface propane dehydrogenation activity. However, its application in CL-ODH is limited by its overoxidation feature, i.e., high valency vanadia converts propane to COx rather than propylene.10,11 Meantime, previous studies have shown that V4+ in VO2 exhibits the best propane dehydrogenation performance with balanced activity and selectivity, while V2O3 species are known as unreducible non-ODH catalysts.12,13 Hence, suppressing the overoxidation and maintaining V4+ remain key issues for further development of the vanadia oxygen carrier for CL-ODH.
Incorporation of doping impurities could manipulate various physical and chemical properties of host materials. The carefully introduced dopants could release carrier to the host,14,15,16 which could modify the bonding pattern and corresponding chemical performance of host materials by filling the bonding or antibonding states.17,18,19 Meantime, due to the nature as defect, density of dopant is limited by the solubility in the host.20 If a small amount of dopant only works by direct bonding with host atoms, doping would only influence the local chemical environment. However, local modification is ineffective for solid redox chemistry. To improve the overoxidation feature of vanadia, the oxidizing capacity of every oxygen atom needs to be suppressed. Hence, delocalization of introduced carriers could play a key role in the further development of doping technique.
Conductivity could be key to spreading doping effect by virtue of free carriers, e.g., metallic nanoparticles easily delocalize the electrons generated by surface reactions.21 Metal to insulator transition (MIT)22 of strong correlated materials makes it possible to realize metallic conductivity even in highly ionic solid materials. As a representative, VO2 possesses a conductive nature at temperatures above 341 K after MIT.23,24 However, the rich valence states and crystalline forms of vanadia25,26 make its performance shows obvious stage-by-stage feature during the reduction process of CL-ODH. Hence, to maintain the optimal V4+ and show the potential distinctive doping effect in VO2, dynamic control of the redox process through doping is required. More specifically, promoting the conversion from V2O5 to VO2, while suppressing the oxygen release in VO2, maintains the VO2 phase and reduces oxidizing capacity. Such modification involves all O atoms within the entire lattice and makes the need for delocalized doping urgent.
Herein, combining theoretical calculations and experimental characterization, we aim to reveal the detailed mechanism of the dynamic vanadia redox process and the corresponding delocalized doping effect in maintained VO2, with the goal of applying this knowledge to the CL-ODH process. By simulating an atomic-phase transformation process, we found that molybdenum (Mo) dopant lowers phase transformation barriers, which boosts the conversion from defective V2O5 to VO2. In the VO2 period, the conductive nature of the high-temperature VO2 rutile phase can expand effective range of doping, such that the properties of oxygen atoms that do not directly coordinate with dopant can also be modulated by dopant in VO2. Charge distribution analysis shows apparent delocalized distribution in VO2. Finally, in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and reactivity test proved that delocalized doping increases the lifetime of VO2. The maintained doped VO2 significantly improved selectivity by modulating both doped and undoped sites. These findings address the potential of conductive oxide as a promising host for the further enhancement of doping effects.
Results
Phase transformation from defective V2O5 to VO2
Our oxygen vacancy formation energy calculation (defined as: VxOy(s) + H2(g)  VxOy  1(s) + H2O(g)) demonstrates that the introduction of the Mo element as dopant can effectively decrease the oxidizing capacity of vanadia, compared with other elements (Figure S1). As a result, we identified Mo as a promising dopant candidate and conducted phase transformation simulation to explore the influence of Mo on conversion between defective V2O5 and VO2.
The redox process of vanadia is a systematic circulation of two steps: formation of oxygen vacancy and phase transformation toward the subsequent phase. After the concentration of oxygen vacancies reaches a threshold, the defective phase would transform into the next phase. During the oxygen release period (i.e., oxygen vacancy formation) of V2O5, based on both our calculation (Figure S2) and previous work,27,28 oxygen vacancies would gather in O(I) sites of V2O5. Accumulation of vacancies in O(I) sites forms the so-called crystallographic shear planes29 (Figure S3).
A defective V2O5 structure that entails the key features above (Figure 1A; modeling details in supplemental information) was constructed to investigate its phase transformation process toward rutile VO2 (Figure 1B) via a complex potential energy surface sampling method, stochastic surface walking (SSW) method.30 Two parallel SSW optimizations were initiated simultaneously from defective V2O5 and VO2, with walking directions pointing toward each other. Upon reaching the same intermediate structure, the initial transformation pathway was successfully linked. Based on the structure with the highest energy in the pathway, more accurate transition states (Figures 1C and 1D) were further located via the constrained Broyden dimer (CBD) method.31 Finally, we obtained a series of structures that constitutes the phase transformation path, which starts from defective V2O5 and ends at VO2. We normalized the number of each structure from zero to one, which is used to represent the phase transformation coordinate. As shown in Figure 1E, according to the potential energy variation, along with phase transformation coordinate, the transformation path has an activation barrier of 1.64 eV in the undoped vanadia. The transformation consists of three main steps. First, half of the atoms relax and convert to rutile-like phase, while the rest of the atoms are still in a compressed and chaotic state. There is enough space in the loose crystal structure of defective V2O5; therefore, the first half of the atoms could transform into rutile structure without severe structural relaxation and high system energy. However, in the second step, as depicted by the transition-state structure (Figure 1C), transfer of another half of V and O atoms in the remaining restricted space leads to the model reaching the highest energy state. After this concerted transfer process, the crystalline structure reaches the rutile phase with significantly lowered total energy.

The inclusion of Mo dopant has a marked impact on the energy state of the phase transformation process. Our calculations demonstrate that the presence of Mo reduces the transformation barrier from 1.64 to 1.26 eV, thereby facilitating the transformation of defective V2O5 to rutile VO2 (Figure 1F). The three-step transformation mechanism is preserved, as evidenced by the characteristics of the transition structure (Figure 1D). However, the addition of Mo results in the first and second steps becoming independent of each other. This is illustrated by the appearance of two isolated peaks in the potential energy diagram, which combine into one peak in the diagram of undoped vanadia. In the Mo-doped vanadia, the intermediate structure after the first step is allowed to fully relax, whereas the corresponding structure in undoped vanadia enters the second step without undergoing any energy-decreasing process (Figure S4). This feature contributes to the lowered activation barrier observed in Mo-doped vanadia.
The inherent nature of the dopant, which is an impurity in the lattice, also influences the activation barrier of phase transformation, as demonstrated by the cell volume change during phase transformation in Figure 1G. Although the cell shrinks with phase transformation (rutile is a more compact and stable structure), the presence of Mo dopants reduces the extent of volume reduction. The phase transformation process is a concerted transfer process of multi-atoms, which is highly dependent on the available space within the lattice. Introducing an impurity disrupts the ordered crystal, leading to an expandable lattice and promoting the transfer process.
Electronic analysis via the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) indicates that the phase transformation after doping is a strengthening process of VO bonds, as compared with the undoped process. The strengthening interaction between V and O atoms acts as the driving force for the atoms to turn into the rutile structure. The summed integrated COHP (ICOHP) suggests doping cannot influence bond strength in V2O5, as the VO ICOHP difference between doped and undoped V2O5 is only 0.04 eV (Table S1). Meantime, the VO ICOHP difference between doped and undoped VO2 is 0.36 eV (Table S2), indicating that the bond strength is strengthened after doping. This phenomenon is correlated closely with our next topic, delocalization of doping in VO2. In summary, compared with the undoped-phase transformation process, doping reduces overlying of barriers of the elementary steps, opens up more space in the lattice, and strengthens bonds in the final state, all of which are additional driving forces in the doped-phase transformation process.
Delocalization of doping in VO2
Lower phase transformation barrier denotes faster conversion from defective V2O5 to VO2. In the generated VO2 (Figure 2A), O atoms could be classified into two types, MoO(III) and original VO(III). From a quantitative perspective, VO(III) is the key specie for determining whether macroscopic overoxidation could be suppressed by doping, since the amount of MoO(III) is limited due to the limited solubility of the dopant. Therefore, Ov formation energies of all O atoms in lattice were calculated and are shown in Figure 2C. For VO2, the effect of doping on VO(III) in doped VO2 is independent of spatial distribution; all VO(III) experiences a uniform impact from doping. The average Ov formation energy increases by 1.13 eV, compared with the value in undoped VO2 (i.e., from 1.53 eV in undoped VO2 to 0.40  0.12 eV), which is not as large as the increase of Ov formation energy of MoO(III) (1.53 eV) but still considerable. On the contrary, doping in V2O5 (Figure 2B) exhibits apparent differences. As shown in Figure 2D, only the Ov formation energy of MoO(I) slightly increases from 1.25 to 1.07 eV (detailed information of MoO(I) is shown in Figure S5). Meantime, for the VO(I), Mo dopant acts as spectator during their oxygen vacancy formation process. The average Ov formation energy is 1.22  0.05 eV, which is very similar to the value in the undoped system (1.23 eV). Hence, doping in VO2 shows a prominent delocalization feature, which enables the dopant to modulate global properties of host (suppressing the over-reactive state). While the strongly localized doping in V2O5 only influences a few specific sites, implying that a large amount of VO(I) remains in the state with high oxidizing capacity, the CL-ODH performance cannot be improved.

During a chemical looping process, the oxidation of propane leads to the consumption of surface O atoms, which establishes the oxygen concentration gradient from bulk to surface, and subsurface O atoms start diffusing to the surface. Since the kinetical diffusion process of lattice oxygen also plays an important role in the CL-ODH process, we investigated whether the diffusion process is modulated by doping. In VO2, the elementary diffusion step of lattice oxygen, i.e., from one O(III) site to the nearest O(III) site, possesses a 0.58 eV activation barrier (Figure S6). The introduction of Mo apparently alters the kinetics of lattice oxygen diffusion. Stronger bonding between Mo and O(III) increases corresponding diffusion barrier to 1.10 eV. Similar to the trend in thermodynamical Ov formation energies, delocalized doping effect in VO2 causes all transfer barriers of VO(III) to increase to 0.99 eV (Figure S6). Since the oxygen diffusion toward the surface is constituted by these calculated elementary steps, and formation of oxygen vacancies is suppressed due to increased Ov formation energy, the release of lattice oxygen to the surface is suppressed in Mo-doped vanadia, from both the kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. Meantime, doping effect on diffusion in V2O5 preserves the localized featureonly diffusion barrier of MoO(I) increases by 0.28 eV (Figure S6).
In addition to the bulk properties of VO2, delocalized doping effect also exists on the VO2 surface and modulates the adsorption of intermediates. Previous studies have suggested that destabilizing the C3H6 to promote its desorption from catalytic surface is key to enhancing the selectivity of aimed product C3H6.32,33,34,35 We calculated the relative adsorption energies (adsorption energy on undoped vanadia surface as reference) of different sites on Mo-doped vanadia surfaces. These results show that Mo doping can weaken the adsorption of C3H6 efficiently on the undoped site of Mo-doped VO2 surface (Figure 2E). Conversely, on Mo-doped V2O5, dopant could only weaken the C3H6 adsorption on doped site (Figure 2F). The changes in interaction between key intermediates and doped surfaces further influence the CL-ODH reaction kinetics, as shown in Figure 2G. Compared with undoped VO2 surface, barriers of first and second dehydrogenation steps of propane decrease on doped surface. Through these changes, the production of C3H6 could be boosted kinetically. Meantime, the overoxidation reaction route could be suppressed from the key intermediate acetone, which indicates the improvement of selectivity. Doping in V2O5 cannot influence the barriers of these reaction steps (Figure 2H). The barrier of acetone production is lower than propylene production, indicating a preference for overoxidation. Consequently, Mo-doped VO2 surface has both optimal activity and propylene selectivity.
Origin of delocalized doping in VO2
We have tested a series of chemical properties of doped VO2 system, of which the results show a comprehensive delocalized effect that must be correlated to intrinsic change of the electronic structure. Therefore, we further conducted charge density difference calculations to explore the variation of electronic structures in vanadia. To show clear electronic differences between V2O5 and VO2, a comparison of spatially charge distribution between undoped V2O5/VO2 and Mo-doped V2O5/VO2 was performed. As shown in Figures 3A and 3C (also Figures S7 and S8), the ways in which to accommodate the excess carriers introduced by dopant in V2O5 and VO2 are different. In V2O5, charge redistribution concentrates in the area around Mo dopant, while in VO2, the charges are delocalized throughout the entire lattice. Since both vacancy formation and propane dehydrogenation are sensitive to the electronic structure of corresponding sites, the delocalized charges that spread the doping effect allow for modulation of properties of all oxygen atoms (Figures 3B and 3D).

Substitutional doping, compared with other forms such as interstitial doping, is a less disruptive doping form to the host structure.14 Here, the dopant still follows the pattern of the host structure, forming adjusted bonding and antibonding states, which is the origin of its influence on directly bonded oxygen.36 Meantime, due to the different number of valence electrons and ionization energy of dopant element, extra carriers may be introduced into the lattice. For instance, in the case of Mo-doped VO2, only 4 valence electrons are needed to bond with surrounding O atoms under the framework of VO2 lattice. The extra two electrons may introduce a new doping level in the host, and the position of this level could be key to determining the delocalization of doping effect. Normally, in electronic or optoelectronic devices, researchers aim for doping levels around the valence band maximum or conduction band minimum to facilitate injection of carriers into the valence band or conduction band, respectively, and to achieve n-type or p-type conductivity.14
Doping for chemical applications shares the same goal of achieving free carriers that can transfer between unfilled states. These carriers can be injected into the bonding or antibonding states of a chemical bond far from the dopant and influence the corresponding chemical properties. COHP analysis has shown that bonding pattern between Mo and O in doped VO2 is adjusted, compared with VO in undoped VO2 (Figure S9), resulting in prominently strengthened bonding according to the ICOHP values (Table S2). Bonding and antibonding states for VO in doped VO2 generally preserved their patterns in undoped VO2 (Figure S9), while the carriers introduced by the dopant strengthens the occupancy of bonding states, as reflected in the more negative ICOHP value (Table S2). Conversely, in V2O5, COHP pattern (Figure S10) as well as ICOHP of VO (Table S1) show no difference after doping, indicating that the introduced carriers cannot be delocalized and influence VO that is far from the dopant. Hence, shallow doping is not always promising; careful device design and dopant-host matching are necessary.37,38,39 Extra demands from the specific chemical reaction for the dopant makes it more challenging. Hence, in this work, we highlight that doping in the conductive materials, where band gap is no longer existing, to inhibit the delocalization of carriers could be a more promising choice. Even for the highly ionic metal oxide that is normally a semiconductor, we can still find a special conductive system like VO2 that fits this idea.
Experimental verification of delocalized doping effect
A confirmatory experiment was performed to verify our calculation results. As expected, Mo dopant improves CL-ODH performance of vanadia prominently. In situ XRD patterns (Figures 4A and 4B) provided information about the entire redox process of vanadia in CL-ODH. Compared with the undoped system, V2O5-dominant period was prolonged for 8.5 min after Mo doping, which could be attributed to partly destabilized Ov and an increased oxygen transfer barrier. These factors suppress consumption of V2O5. Meantime, VO2-dominant period increased greatly from 10 min before doping to 34 min after doping. According to our theoretical results, the phase transformation from defective V2O5 to VO2 is accelerated by the dopant. Therefore, V2O5 could be converted to VO2 more easily. Then, in VO2, delocalized doping suppresses the release of lattice oxygen more efficiently. These factors together lead to a prominently extended VO2 lifetime.

(D) Conversion or selectivity of CL-ODH with reaction time over MoVOx/SiO2. Reaction conditions are same as Figure 4C.
Both our Ov formation energy calculation and surface reaction calculation indicates that doped VO2 possesses better CL-ODH reaction performance, so we further conducted the reactivity test. As shown in Figure 4C, for the pure vanadia, overoxidized product COx takes in a large proportion during the initial stage of the reaction, which denotes the exorbitant oxidizing capacity of lattice oxygen and low selectivity of surface reactions. Specific to atomic aspect, such overall reactivity performance corresponds to negative Ov formation energy and higher dehydrogenation barriers toward propylene for both V2O5 and VO2 (Table S3). After introducing Mo dopant, as shown in Figure 4D, we could observe the improved conversion and selectivity. XRD patterns of reacted Mo-doped vanadia and undoped vanadia verify that both samples have entered the V2O3-dominant period after reactivity test (Figure S11). Therefore, considering the long lifetime of VO2 in Mo-doped vanadia, we can conclude that Mo-doped VO2 is the optimal phase for CL-ODH, which corresponds with our theoretical calculation. In the following redox stability test, Mo-doped vanadia also shows stable CL-ODH performance, proving the redox cycles are repeatable (Figure S12). Besides, we also noticed that the initial reactivity for Mo-doped vanadia is still not satisfying, which shows the poor modification effect of localized Mo doping in V2O5.
Other oxides with delocalized doping
To prove the universality of the above idea, we further conducted defect calculations in other conductive oxidesTiO2 and SnO2. We introduced the same Mo dopant into their lattices and observed how doping influences the Ov formation energy. As shown in Figures S13 and S14, both TiO2 and SnO2 show a delocalized doping effect; no O atom maintains its original Ov formation energy in the undoped system. In addition, TiO2 shows an interesting phenomenon. After doping, formation energies of TiO(III)v in Mo-doped TiO2 increased while the rest of TiO(III)v formation energies decreased. This observation further indicates that doping effects for direct bonding atoms and indirect bonding atoms have different origins. Hence, the analysis in our work shows that doping in conductive oxide is promising to realizing delocalized doping, which is not sensitive to the choices of both host (Figures S13 and S14) and dopant (Figure S1). In Figure S1, we have chosen a series of dopants, and they all show stable delocalized feature (the test site is far from dopant spatially). This is the main advantage of doping in the conductive oxide. However, generally, semiconductor materials are still irreplaceable for chemical applications, but realizing delocalized doping in these materials is still challenging, as we have analyzed. Development of general rules to achieve delocalized doping in semiconductors with both proper host and dopant for corresponding chemical application would be key for designing next-generation doped materials for chemistry, which will attract the attentions of both physical and chemical communities.
Discussion
In summary, by employing a complex potential surface sampling method, we elucidated the dynamic redox process of vanadia, which comprises a defect emergence period and phase transformation period. On this basis, we have successfully improved the performance of vanadia in CL-ODH by means of doping. We demonstrate that phase transformation can be adjusted by doping to facilitate the formation of the VO2 phase that has optimal performance. During the VO2-dominated period, doping shows an apparent delocalization feature, which is key to realizing prominent modification with a small amount of dopant. We calculated bulk defect formation energies, oxygen diffusion barriers, surface intermediate adsorption, and surface reactions barriers. All doping-induced effects on these chemical properties are delocalized throughout the entire lattice and lead to adjustments toward superior activity and selectivity for CL-ODH. Meantime, for the semiconductive V2O5, these effects only manifest on the atoms that are directly bonded with Mo dopant. Charge density distribution analysis indicates that the introduced carriers are spread spatially by the conductive nature of VO2, which is the main origin of the delocalized doping. Catalytic performance and in situ XRD patterns confirm the macroscopical influence of delocalized doping. Calculations in similarly conductive TiO2 and SnO2 further prove the universality of the delocalization of doping in conductive oxides. Overall, delocalization should be the standard demand for future doped materials applicated in chemistry. Here, we shed light on doping in conductive oxide and provide a stepping stone toward the rational design of delocalized doped materials.
