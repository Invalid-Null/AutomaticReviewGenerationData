 Unfortunately the provided answers do not contain relevant information to address the questions asked. As the answers indicate, the literature reviewed focuses on vanadium oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, and does not evaluate other metal oxide or supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. No mechanistic insights or structure-function relationships are provided.

Therefore, I will respond with the statement:
