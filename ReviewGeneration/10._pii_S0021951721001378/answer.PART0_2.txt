[1] "With the continued increasing global demand of propene and the explored reserves of natural gas and shale gas, the C3H8 non-oxidative dehydrogenation reaction with high C3H6 selectivity has ignited wide research."

[2] "At present, the main commercial catalysts are K-CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 [1], [2]."

[3] "Coincidently, both catalysts are supported by alumina, which plays the role in modulating geometric and electronic structure of the active sites for optimizing the catalytic performance, including the dispersing, stabilizing or increasing electron density of the active sites [3], [4]."

[4] "Recently, a new perspective was proposed, alumina itself can play the role of PDH catalyst. Pure bulk Al2O3 materials [5], [6] show an intrinsic activity for selectively catalyzing propane and isobutane dehydrogenation."

[5] "The Alcu and neighbouring lattice oxygen (Lewis acid-base pairs) were proposed as active sites, which are created upon removal of OH-groups during alumina treatment at high temperatures." 

[6] "For the inert crystal Al2O3, we found that the surface oxygen vacancy amount of Al2O3 can be controlled by pretreatment of CO reduction, and the nearby coordinatively unsaturated Al-O (Alcu-O) pairs can effectively catalyze propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."

[7] "Giannis et al. [20] investigated the concerted and stepwise PDH reaction mechanisms on stoichiometric 110 γ-Al2O3 surface with or without OH, and found that alkane dehydrogenation activity depends on the strength of surface acid-base site pairs."

[8] "However, the effect of oxygen vacancies neighbouring Alcu-O acid-base site pairs on the PDH performance and the reaction mechanism is still elusive."
