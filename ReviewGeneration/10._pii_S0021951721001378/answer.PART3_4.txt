[1] "In situ DRIFTS experiments were conducted on a Bruker VERTEX 80v Fourier-transformed infrared spectrometer equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector and a Harrick Scientific DRIFT cell." 

[2] "For the intermediate detection of CO reacted with OH-groups, the sample was pretreated at 450 °C under N2 flow (30 mL/min) for 1 h to obtain a background spectrum, then the spectra were recorded continuously in CO flow."

[3] "The DRIFTS experiments were further performed over the CO-reduced γ-Al2O3 catalyst to investigate the surface adsorbed species and the coke."
