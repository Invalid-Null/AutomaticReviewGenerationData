 Based on the provided correct answers and text files, here is the comparison of the consistency between each answer file and the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I carefully compared each answer file against the provided correct answers for consistency. The percentage indicates the degree of match between each answer file and the correct answer for that specific question number. 0% means completely inconsistent, 100% means completely consistent.
