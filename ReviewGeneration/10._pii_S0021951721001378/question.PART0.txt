Abstract
Recently, the coordinatively unsaturated metal-O Lewis acid-base pairs of metal oxides are found to be able to activate the CH bond of light alkane efficiently. For the inert crystal Al2O3, we found that the surface oxygen vacancy amount of Al2O3 can be controlled by pretreatment of CO reduction, and the nearby coordinatively unsaturated Al-O (Alcu-O) pairs can effectively catalyze propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The C3H6 formation rate of γ/δ-Al2O3 is in line with the concentration of oxygen vacancies. The experiments and DFT calculations illuminate the importance of oxygen vacancy on the surface of Al2O3 for PDH reaction. The consumption of lattice oxygen reduces the one coordination number of the bonding Al, the formed Alcu-O as defective acid-base pairs, can be an effective way to tune the adsorption energy of the intermediates and the barriers of key steps (the first CH activation and H2 formation) to enhance the performance of PDH through both site-dependent concerted and stepwise mechanisms.

1. Introduction
With the continued increasing global demand of propene and the explored reserves of natural gas and shale gas, the C3H8 non-oxidative dehydrogenation reaction with high C3H6 selectivity has ignited wide research. At present, the main commercial catalysts are K-CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 [1], [2]. Coincidently, both catalysts are supported by alumina, which plays the role in modulating geometric and electronic structure of the active sites for optimizing the catalytic performance, including the dispersing, stabilizing or increasing electron density of the active sites [3], [4].
Recently, a new perspective was proposed, alumina itself can play the role of PDH catalyst. Pure bulk Al2O3 materials [5], [6] show an intrinsic activity for selectively catalyzing propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. The Alcu and neighbouring lattice oxygen (Lewis acid-base pairs) were proposed as active sites, which are created upon removal of OH-groups during alumina treatment at high temperatures. In fact, the coordinatively unsaturated Lewis acidic Al and Lewis basic O surface atoms are generally as defect sites to catalyze the dissociation of HH and CH bonds even at low temperature [7], [8], especially for the H/D exchange reactions [9], [10], [11]. The previous researches usually focus on the tricoordinate AlIII formed upon the dehydroxylation (especially for the terminal OH-groups). The reactivity of surface atoms is usually correlated with their coordination number, the lowest coordination is generally associated to the highest acidity or basicity. But how about further decreasing the Al coordination number by directly removing lattice oxygen or multibonded OH-groups?
Very recently, the reduced bulk ZrO2 [12], [13], [14], TiO2 [15], [16], W2O3 [17] nanoparticles with coordinatively unsaturated metal (Mcu)-O pairs, created by oxygen vacancies, have shown excellent PDH activity. The heterolytic dissociation of H2 at oxygen vacancies of CeO2(1 1 1) facilitated by frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) consisting of spatially separated O and Ce sites [18]. The FLPs with enhanced acidity and basicity, constructed by three or more oxygen vacancies on CeO2(1 1 0), were active for breaking the CH bond of methane with low activation energy [19]. It is generally accepted that the Mcu-O created by oxygen vacancies are favorable for binding with alkyl and H, as the oxygen vacancies can effectively create more different surface acid-base site pairs with a unique coordination environment. Giannis et al. [20] investigated the concerted and stepwise PDH reaction mechanisms on stoichiometric 110 γ-Al2O3 surface with or without OH, and found that alkane dehydrogenation activity depends on the strength of surface acid-base site pairs. However, the effect of oxygen vacancies neighbouring Alcu-O acid-base site pairs on the PDH performance and the reaction mechanism is still elusive.
The formation of oxygen vacancies is usually conducted by the lattice oxygen consumption of oxides at high temperature and reducing gas atmosphere [12], [21], [22]. Here, we found that the surface reduction degree of the different crystal Al2O3 can be facilely controlled by CO pretreatment time at high temperature. The relationship among CO reduction time, active sites density, crystalline phase and catalytic performance were investigated in detail through the designed experiments. At the atomic and molecular level, DFT calculations were employed to analyze the intrinsic effect of oxygen vacancy on Alcu-O acid-base pairs for efficient catalyzing PDH reaction.
2. Methods
2.1. Experimental
2.1.1. Catalyst preparation
The nano γ-Al2O3 (average diameter 10 nm) and α-Al2O3 (average diameter 30 nm) were purchased from Aladdin reagent (Shanghai) co. LTD. The δ, θ-Al2O3 were synthesized according to previous work, but with slight modification [23]. Typical synthesis procedures are as follows: 19 g of aluminium nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O) and 2.4 g of NaOH were dissolved in 100 mL deionized water under magnetic stirring for 6 h. The solution was then placed in a 200 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and maintained at 170 C for 24 h. After air-cooling to room temperature, the white precipitates were centrifuged and washed with deionized water several times and then dried at 100 C for 6 h. Finally, the δ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3 were obtained by calcination of the powder in air at 850 C and 1050 C for 5 h, respectively.
2.1.2. Catalyst characterization
The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were recorded on a Panalytical Empyrean power diffraction system using Cu Kα radiation over the 2θ range of 580. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on the Jeol JEM-2011 microscope and FEI Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope at the accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured at liquid nitrogen temperature (196 C) using a Micromeritics Triflex instrument. Before the measurements, the samples were degassed under vacuum at 350 C for 4 h. In situ DRIFTS experiments were conducted on a Bruker VERTEX 80v Fourier-transformed infrared spectrometer equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector and a Harrick Scientific DRIFT cell. For the intermediate detection of CO reacted with OH-groups, the sample was pretreated at 450 C under N2 flow (30 mL/min) for 1 h to obtain a background spectrum, then the spectra were recorded continuously in CO flow. For the detection of the consumption of the different surface OH-groups, the fresh γ-Al2O3 sample was pretreated at 600 C under a N2 flow for 1 h and cooled down to 60 C to obtain a background spectrum, and this spectrum was then subtracted from the spectra of CO reduced γ-Al2O3 sample. For the CO reduction process, the γ-Al2O3 sample was treated at 600 C in 25 mL/min 20%vol CO/N2 flow for 1 h, N2 purged and then cooled down to 60 C. The other two in situ DRIFTS experiments were conducted with C3H8 and C3H6 as the feed gas, respectively. The samples were pretreated at 600 C under a 20% CO/N2 flow (25 mL/min) for 1 h and cooled to the 60 C to obtain a background spectrum, which was subtracted from the sample spectra for each measurement.
An overall number of oxygen vacancies in Al2O3 catalysts was determined by O2 pulse experiments performed at 550 C in the temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor. The catalysts (100 mg) were initially treated in a flow of CO (20 vol% CO in N2) at 600 C for corresponding time followed by Helium purge. Then an O2/He = 2/98 mixture was pulsed until oxygen consumption was not observed. The Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 apparatus with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was applied for quantitative oxygen analysis. One O2 pulse amount was 3E-07 mol O2. For the He temperature-programmed desorption (He-TPD) experiment, the samples (50 mg) were pretreated at 300 C for 10 min and then cooled to room temperature in a He flow (30 mL min1). The temperature was raised at a rate of 10 C min1 in the range of 80850 C. The mass spectroscopy analyzer (HIDEN) monitored H2 and H2O signals. The H2 temperature-programmed reduction H2-TPR experiments is similar to He-TPD except for raising temperature in a H2 flow (10 vol% H2 in Ar). For the CO temperature-programmed reduction (CO-TPR) experiment, the samples (50 mg) were purged by He flow at 600 C for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature in a He flow (30 mL min1). After the pretreatment, the He flow was switched to 20 vol% CO/N2 (30 mL min1) gas flow, the temperature was raised at a rate of 10 C min1 in the range of 80850 C. H2, H2O and CO2 signals were monitored by mass spectroscopy analyzer (HIDEN)
2.1.3. Catalytic tests
PDH catalytic tests were performed at 1 bar between 500 C and 600 C using a continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz tubular reactor. 0.10.3 g catalysts with average 270 μm particle size and feed gas containing 5 vol% C3H8 in N2 were used. The components of the feed gas and the reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Beijing Beifen-Ruili Analytical Instrument (Group) Co.,Ltd. SP-3420) equipped with HP-PLOT/Q (for CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and C3H8) and TDX-01 (for CO and CO2) columns with flame ionization detector, CO and CO2 were converted into CH4 by hydrogenation in a nickel reformer and then detected by a hydrogen flame ionization detector. The propane conversion (CC3H8), selectivity of dehydrogenation products (Si), yield of dehydrogenation products (Yi) were determined from eqs (1), 2 and 3, respectively.

Here, for the pretreatment process, the catalysts were heated in O2 flow (20 mL·min1) to 600 C and hold 15 min, then further 25 mL·min1 N2 purged for 15 min. For the CO reduced catalysts, they were treated in a flow of CO (20 vol% CO in N2, 25 mL·min1) for 10, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min, respectively, then followed by purging with N2 (25 mL·min1) for 15 min.
To determine the rate of C3H6 formation (r(C3H6) expressed as μmol(C3H6)gcat-1min1) and overall activation energy of PDH, the tests were performed at a degree of propane conversion below 15%. The C3H8-N2 (5 vol% C3H8 in N2) mixture feeding were 530 mL min1 and the mass of catalysts were 0.050.4 g. The rate of propene formation was the initial performance at 500, 525, 550, 575 and 600 C, respectively after 1 h CO reduction pretreatment at 600 C.

2.2. Computational methods
All Spin-polarized periodic DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP 5.4.4) with a generalized gradient-approximated PBE exchange-correlation functional [24], [25]. The electron-ion interactions were described with the projected augmented waves (PAW) method and the energy cutoff was set to 400 eV [26]. A 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack K-points were used to sample the Brillouin zone. For structural optimizations, calculations were finished until the total energy was converged to 10-5 eV and the convergence criterion of force was less than 0.05 eV/Å. The Van der Waals (vdW) interactions were included by using Grimmes DFT-D3 (BJ) method [27]. The transition states were searched using the climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method [28], four to eight NEB images (the distance between neighboring images were less than 0.8 Å) generated by the Image-Dependent Pair Potentials (IDPP) method [29], and each transition state was reconfirmed with only one imaginary frequency.
The adsorption energy was calculated according to the equation Eads = Esurface + adsorbate  Esurface  Eadsorbate, where Esurface + adsorbate represents the total energy of the surface with adsorbate, Esurface is the energy of the pure surface, and Eadsorbate is the energy of free adsorbate in the gas phase.
The activation barrier (ΔEa) and the reaction energy (ΔEr) were calculated according to ΔEa = ETS  EIS and ΔEr = EFS  EIS, where EIS, EFS, and ETS are the energies of the initial state (IS), the final state (FS), and the transition state (TS), respectively.
The surface aluminum unoccupied 3s and 3p bands center (εunoccupied-sp) was calculated by the following equation according to the previous literature [30]:
where ρsp represents the density of 3s and 3p states, and E is the energy (eV). Ef is the Fermi energy.
The H2 binding energy (H2 BE) was computed, by dissociative hydrogen adsorption on Lewis acid and base sites of the oxide surface, according to the equation:
where
is the total energy of H2 adsorbed on the surface,
and
are total energies of the clean surface and gas-phase H2, respectively. The more negative the H2 BE, the stronger the bond of dissociative hydrogen adsorption (the strength of Lewis acid-base pairs).
3. Discussion
3.1. The relationship between the oxygen vacancy and catalytic performance
Herein, four different morphology and crystal Al2O3 nanoparticles were identified as of γ, δ, θ, α-Al2O3 according to lattice parameters form the XRD patterns (Fig. 1) and the TEM images [31] (Fig. S1-S6). Their specific surface area decreases with the thermodynamic stability of the crystal phase, γ > δ > θ > α (Table S1 and Fig. S7). The four crystal Al2O3 nanoparticles were directly used as PDH reaction catalysts, and their catalytic performance during 20 h at 600 C was evaluated. The low concentration of C3H8 (5%) was used, which is beneficial to inhibiting the coke; the average coke selectivity is low according to the results of thermogravimetry experiment (Fig. S8 and Fig. S9) and can be negligible. The carbon balance was almost 100% during 20 h PDH reaction. For γ, δ-Al2O3 catalysts, their C3H6 productivity and selectivity both gradually increased with 1h1 and 98%, respectively (Fig. 2a). Meanwhile, the cracking products (CH4 and C2H6) selectivity decreased gradually to nearly 0% (Fig. 2b). This phenomenon illustrates the gradual formation of PDH active sites on the surface of alumina under the reaction condition.

According to Kondratenkos report [5] about non-oxidative isobutane dehydrogenation on alumina, Alcu-O sites are created upon the removal of OH-groups, and responsible for CH bond activation resulting in Al-alkyl species and O-H group. In this non-oxidative PDH reaction system, after N2 purging at 600 C to eliminate the influence of surface adsorbed oxygen species and some OH-groups, as shown in Fig. 2c and Fig. S10, the oxygen of COx (CO and CO2) products may mainly come from the lattice oxygen of Al2O3 catalysts (tiny trace amount of O2 lower than 1 ppm level in the reaction gas generally can not be completely avoided), which lead to forming oxygen vacancies continuously and slowly. This phenomenon suggests that the Alcu-O sites as PDH active sites created by oxygen vacancy, which is similar to the nano-sized ZrO2 and TiO2 catalysts for PDH.
It is generally accepted that there are a large amount of OH-groups on the surface of γ-Al2O3, even after treatments at 400500 C, the OH density is 25 OH/nm2 [5], [8], [32]. According to Sautet et al work [33], [34], OH-groups on the surface of γ-Al2O3 are diverse, including terminal, bridged, or tribridged OH-groups bound on different coordinated Al atoms. If the surface lattice oxygen bonded with a hydrogen atom, it would be equal to bridged or tribridged OH-groups. The elimination of OH-groups is influent by the number of Al neighbors in the first coordination sphere of the oxygen atom and on the coordination number of Al itself. Here, according to the ability of elimination, the complicated OH-groups are simply classified as the active OH-groups and the stable surface OH-groups, which includes the surface lattice oxygen banded with a hydrogen atom.
According to the H2O and H2 MS signals of He-TPD in Fig. S11a, the active surface OH-groups gradually recombined and left alumina surface in the form of H2O with the increasing of temperature. However, for the relatively stable lattice oxygen, only their binding H species formed H2 at high temperatures. Almost no initial catalytic activity was observed after pretreatment of 30 min N2 flow at 600 C (Fig. 2a), which demonstrates that the removal of the active surface OH-groups did not lead to forming effective active sites. From the comparison of He-TPD and H2-TPR characterization results, more H2O formed at 115314 C and 600850 C during the H2-reduction (Fig. S11b), indicating that the introduction of H2 avails the consumption of the OH-groups or lattice oxygen with different coordination environments. Previous research also demonstrated that the H2 reduction can accelerate the removal of surface OH-groups and the formation of dehydrogenation active sites [5]. For the CO-TPR measurement (Fig. S8c), the γ-Al2O3 catalyst was pretreated in He flow at 600 C, most active OH-groups were removed according to the He-TPD results. The CO2 formed in the region of 400850 C attributes to the reaction between CO and the stable OH-groups or lattice oxygen. Interestingly, the formation of CO2 was along with H2 and their trends are similar, which demonstrated that the stable OH-groups can be consumed by CO to generate CO2 and H2 simultaneously. As shown in the Fig. S12, the band at 3000 cm1 and 2907 cm1 could be assigned to the CH vibration of formats, their intensity increased with the reaction time. It may demonstrate that the formates are the intermediates for CO2 formation when CO reacts with the abundant surface hydroxyls.
To further investigate the consumption of different OH-groups during the CO reduction, an in situ DRIFTS experiment was employed. The OH stretching frequencies of CO-reduced γ-Al2O3 sample are attributed to the consumption of OH-groups by the CO. As shown in the Fig. 3, the highest frequencies, at 3772 cm1, correspond to terminal OH-groups. The bridged OH-groups exhibit unambiguously lower frequencies at about 3687 cm1, the shoulder at 3590 cm1 can be attributed to tribridged OH-group species. The broad band at 3477 cm1 could be assigned to multibonded OH-groups [33], [34], [35]. The main OH stretching frequencies assigned to bridged and multibonded OH-groups, only a little terminal OH-groups. So, the active OH-groups mainly include some terminal OH-groups and the stable surface OH-groups are mostly composed of the bridged, tribridged, and multibonded OH-groups. For the thermal dehydroxylation, H2/CO reduction, or the in-situ reduction during PDH reaction, their essential contribution to PDH catalysts are the consumption of the relatively stable lattice oxygen (or OH-groups) to generate oxygen vacancy and Alcu sites.

This in-situ reduction of γ, δ-Al2O3 catalysts are too slow to lead the C3H8 conversion up to the summit within 8 h, indicating the very low consumption rate of lattice oxygen and the degree of surface reduction almost keeps constant in a short time. Especially, in the initial reaction period, the influence of in-situ reduction and coke on the amount of Alcu sites can be negligible. So, the initial catalytic performance of Al2O3 with the certain density of oxygen vacancy can equal to the actual catalytic performance. As shown in Fig. 4a, the C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity of γ, δ-Al2O3 catalysts increased with CO reduction time, and up to the maximum after around 1 h. The initial C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity of γ-Al2O3 catalyst rise to 27.5% and 95% at 600 C, respectively. It demonstrates that the formation of PDH active sites can be controlled by CO reduction time.

Fig. 4. The apparent activation energy of propene formation (Ea(C3H6)) determined for γ-Al2O3 and δ-Al2O3.
To further quantify the relationship between the oxygen vacancy amount and r(C3H6), on the one hand, O2-pulse experiments of the γ, δ-Al2O3 catalysts with different reduction degree were conducted (Fig. S13 and Table S2). Based on the theoretical assumption (Fig. S14) that one O2 molecule saturates two vacancies, the amount of oxygen vacancy is equal to twice the total amount of O2 consumption (Oxygen pulse titration of oxygen vacancies to saturation). On the other hand, to determine the r(C3H6), the activity tests were carried in the kinetic regime (Fig. S15, Table S3 and Table S4). As shown in Fig. 4b, the r(C3H6) was in line with the calculated oxygen vacancy concentration of γ, δ-Al2O3 catalysts. Thus, this result further demonstrates that the PDH active sites are the Alcu sites nearby oxygen vacancies through the surface lattice oxygen consumption by CO reduction. It also establishes an observation method to control the amount of Alcu on different crystal Al2O3 for PDH reaction. Furthermore, the calculated TOF is donated as r(C3H6) on the one oxygen vacancy, as shown in Fig. 4c, the apparent TOF(C3H6) of γ, δ-Al2O3 catalysts almost kept constant and were not affected by the number of oxygen vacancies or reduction degree. It indicates that the CO reduction process just changes the number of oxygen vacancies and Alcu sites, but not the type of active site for the one crystal Al2O3 catalyst.
The PDH activity of Al2O3 is not only governed by the number of the active sites, but also depends on the crystal structure. At the same concentration of oxygen vacancy, the r(C3H6) of γ-Al2O3 catalysts was higher than that of δ-Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 4b). It illustrates the structures of active sites on γ-Al2O3 and δ-Al2O3 crystal are different, which was further demonstrated by their different apparent activation energy of C3H6 formation (Fig. 5 and Fig. S16). The 1 h CO reduction pretreatment leads the γ, δ-Al2O3 catalysts to keeping almost same and summit concentration of oxygen vacancy, thus excludes the additional energy for active sites formation.

To further demonstrate the importance of oxygen vacancy, the γ-Al2O3 catalyst was firstly reduced by CO and then oxidized by O2 to eliminate the oxygen vacancies, almost no dehydrogenation activity was found as prediction, but just a trace amount of gas-phase reaction products similar to the product distribution in empty tube without catalyst (Fig. 6). Similarly, adding a trace amount of O2 in CO reduction process also led γ-Al2O3 to showing no catalytic activity. So, the formation of oxygen vacancy is intrinsically crucial to create Alcu-O Lewis acid-base pairs for the PDH reaction.

For θ, α-Al2O3 catalysts, there was almost no PDH activity through 20 h in-situ reduction or 1 h CO pretreatment at 600 C (Fig. 6). Their thermodynamic stability kept their surface structure unchanged, and no much lattice oxygen was consumed to form oxygen vacancies and neighbouring Alcu sites for PDH reaction.
The DRIFTS experiments were further performed over the CO-reduced γ-Al2O3 catalyst to investigate the surface adsorbed species and the coke. Fig. S17 shows the IR spectra obtained after adsorption of C3H8/C3H6 at 60 C (spectrum 1), Ar purging at 60 C (spectrum 2), in-situ reaction at 600 C for 1 h and then Ar purging and cooling to 60 C (spectrum 3).
The peaks between 2700 and 3200 cm1 can be attributed to the vibration of the CH bond in aliphatic, olefinic or aromatic hydrocarbons [36], [37], [38]. Peak ranges of 17001500 cm1 and 14501300 cm1 generally represented CC stretching vibration and aliphatic CH bending vibration, respectively [39]. The band at around 1630 cm1 is considered to correspond to the stretching vibration of the CC bond of olefinic species [40]. The broad band at 1600 cm1 is reported to be assignable to the CC stretching vibration of the aromatic ring [41].
As shown in Fig. S17ac (Spectrum 1), the bands at around 2960 cm1 assigned to C3H8 or C3H6. After Ar purging (Spectrum 2), almost no physisorption of C3H8 and C3H6 on the γ-Al2O3 was detected. The DRIFTS recorded after PDH reaction at 600 C for 1 h and subsequent Ar purging give the bands at 1600, 1533, 1394 and 1378 cm1 (Fig. 5b, Spectrum 3), which are the characteristic bands of coke, including aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon species. For the C3H6 reaction on the γ-Al2O3 surface, the DRIFTS appeared new bands at around 1630, 3000 and 2910 cm1, which illustrate that the olefinic coke species was formed from the polymerization and dehydrogenation of C3H6. These results demonstrate that the different concentration of C3H6 product affects the types of coke on the defect surface of γ-Al2O3 catalyst.
3.2. The investigation of the mechanism for PDH reaction on Alcu-O acid-base site pairs at molecular level
3.2.1. Catalyst models
Since the reduced γ-Al2O3 catalysts with abundant (1 1 0) termination exhibited the most excellent catalytic performance among the four crystal Al2O3, we constructed the (2 × 1) supercell with three periodic atomic layers to model the (1 1 0) surface of γ-Al2O3 (Fig. S18). In surface calculations, two layers in the bottom of models were fixed and the rest atoms were allowed to fully relax, and a 15 Å vacuum layer was used along the c direction normalized to the surface to avoid periodic interactions. The optimization of molecules such as propane was computed by placing molecules in a 20 Å wide cubic cell.
We focused on the nature of oxygen vacancy to create new Lewis Alcu-O acid-base pairs for the PDH reaction. Over the stoichiometric γ-Al2O3(1 1 0) surface (s-Al2O3 (1 1 0)), there are three-coordinated (Al3c) and four-coordinated (Al4c) Al cations as well as two-coordinated (O2c) and three-coordinated (O3c) anions. To create oxygen vacancy (Ov) and Alcu cations, a neutral oxygen atom in s-Al2O3 (1 1 0) was removed. The formation energy of oxygen vacancy (Ef (Ov)) as a computational measure of the surface reducibility, is defined as Ef (Ov) = Ed + 1/2EO2  ES, where ES is the energy of stoichiometric surface slab of the γ-Al2O3(1 1 0), Ed is the energy of surface with Ov, and EO2 is the energy of a gas-phase O2 molecule. The oxygen vacancy formation energies for Al2O3(1 1 0) surface corresponding to a surface concentration of one vacancy in eight possible oxygen sites (Fig. S19 and Table S5) vary between 5.27 and 6.50 eV. Furthermore, using the reduction agent of H2 and CO to create oxygen vacancy is more reasonable thermodynamically, oxygen vacancy formation through CO reduction is more favored than O2 and H2 with 2.53 and 0.73 eV energy difference, respectively. The O vacancy formation energy on the (1 0 0) facets was also calculated (Fig. S20 and Table S6), and the smallest oxygen vacancy formation energy (Ef (Ov)) on the (1 0 0) surface is 6.22 eV, which is still greater than the most favorable oxygen vacancy formation energy of 5.39 eV on the (1 1 0) surface. Therefore, we believe that the formation of oxygen vacancies on the (1 1 0) surface is more favorable than the (1 0 0) surface.
To further describe the formation of oxygen vacancy at the surface reduction temperature by taking into consideration enthalpic and entropic contributions, we converted DFT calculated the energy (
) to free energy (
) via the relation [42] as a function of temperature (T) and partial pressure of CO2 (

on γ-Al2O3 (1 1 0) is 1.27 eV. Even if this value is greater than easily reducible oxides (CeO2, TiO2 and NiO) [43], [44], [45], it is still lower than that of non-reducible oxides such as ZrO2 [12]. It has been experimentally and theoretically proved that the unsaturated Zr after the formation of oxygen vacancies as the active center in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation shows industrially relevant activity and durability. Therefore, we believe that γ-Al2O3 as a non-reducible oxide, the value is also expected to be feasible to produce unsaturated Al cations for the PDH reaction. It is consistent with the results of He-TPD, H2-TPR and CO-TPR (Fig. S11) for the γ-Al2O3 catalyst, CO consumed lattice oxygen at high temperature to form higher concentration of oxygen vacancies. Forming an O4 vacancy will generate two Alcu cations and leave two extra electrons in the vacancy (Fig. S21), owing to surface Al can not get reducted by accepting the electron, unlike reducible oxides, e.g., CeO2 [46]. In the following, we investigated propane dehydrogenation on defective γ-Al2O3(1 1 0) surface (d-Al2O3(1 1 0)) with the O4 removed.
3.2.2. Comparison of PDH reaction mechanisms on the four types of active sites
Alkane dehydrogenation activity depending on the strength of surface acid-base site pairs has been proposed [20], and coordinatively unsaturated metal created by oxygen vacancy can effectively create more different surface acid-base site pairs with unique coordination environment to achieve the regulation of intrinsic activity [12]. Therefore, to examine the effect of new surface acid-base site pairs created in the d-Al2O3(1 1 0) on the alkane DH mechanism and activation barriers, we selected two acid-base pairs, AlII-OII (pair d-A) and AlIII-OIII (pair d-B) highlighted in Fig. 7b, around the oxygen vacancy on the d-Al2O3(1 1 0), and two corresponding acid-base pairs on the s-Al2O3(1 1 0), AlIII-OII (pair s-A) and AlIV-OIII (pair s-B), respectively in (Fig. 7a). In the following, we investigated the PDH on these corresponding acid-base pairs on the s-Al2O3(1 1 0) and d-Al2O3(1 1 0) for both the concerted and stepwise mechanisms.

Fig. 7. PDH reaction paths on Al-O pairs via concerted and stepwise mechanisms.
For the two mechanisms (Fig. 8), the physisorption of propane on both stoichiometric and defective surfaces of γ-Al2O3(1 1 0) is weakly exothermic due to the non-polar characteristic of propane. It is consistent with the results of DRIFTS experiments (Fig. S17), there is not physical desorption of C3H8/C3H6 after Ar purging. However, calculated binding energies of propane on the d-Al2O3 (1 1 0) are more exothermic, due to lower surface coordination of the pairs d-A and d-B.

Fig. 8. The TOF values of PDH on Al-O pairs with the concerted and stepwise mechanism.
In the concerted mechanism (Fig. 8a,c), the first CH activation step evolves through a six-membered transition state and yields the olefin directly, along with two hydrogens bounding on the acid-base pair. For both stoichiometric and defective surfaces, this initial step is the rate-limiting step, and the barriers on pair s-A (1.81 eV) and pair d-A (1.86 eV) are lower than that on pair s-B (2.52 eV) and pair d-B (2.37 eV). Furthermore, the effect of the oxygen vacancy for the pair A and B is different, the first CH activation energy increases on d-A and decreases in d-B comparing with the corresponding stoichiometric site pairs. The subsequent H2 production step of recombination of surface-bound hydrogen atoms is generally found to exhibit low barriers (0.321.41 eV) on both stoichiometric and defective surfaces, and s-A (1.41 eV) and d-A (1.21 eV) have more energetical demanding than s-B (0.32 eV) and d-B (0.48 eV). Meanwhile, the impact of the oxygen vacancy on the barriers of H2 formation is opposited to that of the first CH activation. The barriers of H2 formation increases on d-A and decreases on d-B comparing with the corresponding stoichiometric site pairs.
In the stepwise mechanism (Fig. 8b,d), we note that initial CH activation barriers, yielding surface-bound n-propyl and hydroxyl species on Al and O sites, respectively, are lower (1.071.56 eV) than the corresponding barriers in the concerted pathway (1.812.52 eV) on respective site pairs. However, the trend of the H2 formation step is reversed, where the surface-bound hydrogen and one of the β-hydrogen atoms of the propyl fragment combine to yield molecular hydrogen and olefin in the stepwise mechanism. It is observed that H2 production is the rate-limiting step in the stepwise pathway as the barriers for H2 production step are higher than that of the CH activation step on both s-Al2O3 (1 1 0) and the d-Al2O3 (1 1 0). It can be seen from Fig. 7b,d that the oxygen vacancy makes the activation energy of the first step on A pairs increase (1.10 eV in d-A vs 1.07 eV in s-A), and the barriers on B pairs decrease (1.26 in d-B vs 1.52 in s-B), while the second step barriers have opposite trends. However, the influence trend of the oxygen vacancy in the stepwise mechanism is the same to the corresponding step in the concerted mechanism including both pairs A and B, respectively.
It can be deduced that changing the coordination number of Al by the oxygen vacancies to create the new defect pairs can be an effective way to tune the adsorption bond energy of the intermediates and the barriers of key steps to achieve regulating the performance of the PDH process. The more detailed process diagram of reaction mechanism are shown in Fig. S22-25.
3.2.3. TOF comparison
In order to comprehensively evaluate the effect of oxygen vacancies on γ-Al2O3(1 1 0) in the PDH process, we applied the energetic span model and transition state theory [47] to compute the overall turnover frequency (TOF) at 600 C in the PDH reaction for all site pairs on both stoichiometric and defective surfaces of γ-Al2O3(1 1 0) with stepwise and concerted mechanisms (Table S7 and Fig. 9).

Fig. 9. PDOS of the sum of 3s and 3p states of Al on the stoichiometric and defective surfaces of γ-Al2O3 (1 1 0).
The computed TOFs interestingly reveals that the preferred PDH mechanism and the change of activity at different site pairs in stoichiometric and defective surfaces of γ-Al2O3 (1 1 0). In the pairs s-A and d-A, the stepwise mechanisms are found to be preferred on both active site pairs. The second step of H2 formation is an exothermic reaction in stepwise mechanisms compared with the endothermic process in the concerted mechanism, thus the former reaction pathway is more favorable and has a lower overall reaction energy barrier than the later one. Furthermore, the TOF of the pair d-A is nearly ten times that of the pair s-A, owing to efficiently reducing the CH activation energy as the whole reaction energy barrier in stepwise mechanisms. However, in the pair s-B and d-B, it is found that the concerted mechanisms are more favorable on both the active site pairs, due to the exothermic process of the first CH activation in the concerted mechanisms, which is beneficial to reducing the overall activation energy. It can also be seen that the pair d-B balances the barriers of CH activation and H2 formation, resulting in higher PDH reactivity than the pair s-B (0.37 s1 in d-B vs 0.05 s1 in s-B).
Thus, it can be illustrated from the above results that both pairs d-A and d-B consisting of Alcu created by oxygen vacancies with different preferred mechanism can effectively regulate the reaction path of propane dehydrogenation and have the positive effect of PDH on γ-Al2O3(1 1 0), confirming the experimental results.
3.2.4. The reactivity origin of the defective Al-O pairs
As discussed above, the significantly different effects of d-A and d-B in defective surfaces on barriers of CH activation and H2 formation both enhancing PDH activity are obtained comparing the stoichiometric surfaces. In order to gain an insightful understanding of the origin of the reactivity of defective Lewis acid-base pairs constituted of Alcu, the electronic structures and structure-performance relationships were analyzed.
As the oxygen vacancy directly affects the coordination number of aluminum to create Alcu, the intrinsic Lewis acidity of the surface Al atoms is first evaluated using the center of the unoccupied bands in surface Al 2s and 2p orbitals (Fig. 10). The upshift indicates a decrease of the Lewis acidity, while a downshift demonstrates a higher Lewis acidity. On the stoichiometric surface of γ-Al2O3 (1 1 0), the AlIII of pair s-A with a band center at 5.44 eV compared to the AlIV of pair s-B (6.53 eV), shows higher Lewis acidity. With the formation of oxygen vacancy, the band center of AlII in the d-A (4.98 eV) and AlIII in the d-B (5.33 eV) both show the downshift to lower energy, and the appearance of the new bands on both sides of the Fermi in contrast to s-A and s-B, respectively, indicates the formation of higher Lewis acid Al on the defective γ-Al2O3 (1 1 0). Overall, the acidity of Al in both stoichiometric and defective surface follows the order: AlII (d-A) > AlIII (d-B) > AlIII (s-A) > AlIV (s-B), which also shows the trend that the less coordination number of aluminum, the stronger Lewis acid.

Fig. 10. PDH barriers on s-γ-Al2O3 (1 1 0) and d-γ-Al2O3 (1 1 0) for CH activation and H2 production are correlated with dissociated H2 binding energies on corresponding acid-base sites for concerted and stepwise pathways.
To simultaneously evaluate the Lewis acidity (Al) and basicity (O) of all pairs on both defective and stoichiometric surfaces on γ-Al2O3 (1 1 0), we then utilized the dissociative H2 binding energy as a descriptor for the PDH process [20]. We computed dissociated H2 binding energies of all pairs on both surfaces, and then plotted against the corresponding barriers of CH activation and H2 formation in both pathways.
As shown in Fig. 11, for both the defective and stoichiometric pairs in the same mechanism, the H2 binding energy is in line with the activation barriers for two PDH steps (the first CH activation and H2 formation) in the relatively wide range. The two linear correlations were inverse. The site pairs with strong H2 binding (strong Lewis acid-base pair) exhibit low CH activation barriers, while the sites with weak H2 binding (weak Lewis acid-base pair) exhibit low H2 production barriers, resulting in both directly limit of the performance of the PDH process and formation of the volcano relationship (Fig. 12).

The lattice oxygen deletion reduces the one coordination number of the bonding Al and leads to higher acidity for the two Lewis acid-base pairs. But the strong trend of the Lewis acid-base pairs is opposite, i.e., d-A decreases relative to s-A, while d-B increases relative to s-B, which leads to opposite effects in each corresponding step of both mechanisms in accordance with our above analyses. Meanwhile, the defective acid-base pairs, both d-A and d-B possess the moderate acid-base strength leading to suitable barriers of the first CH activation energy and H2 formation, which brings the activity close to the top of the volcano (Fig. 12). It reasonably explains the enhancement of PDH process. Therefore, the PDH activity is determined by the synergistic effect of Lewis acid-base pairs, cannot only depend on the property of acid (Al) or base (O) in Al-O pairs.
4. Conclusions
This work illuminates the importance of oxygen vacancies on the formation of Alcu-O Lewis acid-base pairs for the efficient activation of the CH bond in the PDH process. By exploring the surface and desorption species during the pretreatment and reaction process, we suggested the dynamic changes of the surface active and stable OH-groups, and found that the surface oxygen vacancy amount of Al2O3 can be controlled by pretreatment of CO reduction. The C3H6 formation rate of γ/δ-Al2O3 is in line with the concentration of oxygen vacancies. The DFT calculations extended to aim at rationalizing the results at a molecular level, and it can be deduced that the formation of defective Alcu-O acid-base pairs with a unique coordination environment created by the oxygen vacancy, can be an effective way to tune the adsorption energy of the intermediates. The synergistic acid-base effect makes defective pairs possess the moderate acid-base strength leading to suitable barriers of the first CH activation energy and H2 formation, which brings the activity close to the maximum of the volcano curve, reasonably explaining the enhancement of PDH activity.
