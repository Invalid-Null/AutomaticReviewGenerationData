[1] "The relationship among CO reduction time, active sites density, crystalline phase and catalytic performance were investigated in detail through the designed experiments."

[2] "The experiments and DFT calculations illuminate the importance of oxygen vacancy on the surface of Al2O3 for PDH reaction."  

[3] "The consumption of lattice oxygen reduces the one coordination number of the bonding Al, the formed Alcu-O as defective acid-base pairs, can be an effective way to tune the adsorption energy of the intermediates and the barriers of key steps (the first CH activation and H2 formation) to enhance the performance of PDH through both site-dependent concerted and stepwise mechanisms."

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of alumina affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that creating oxygen vacancies reduces the coordination number of Al atoms, forming Alcu-O acid-base pairs that tune the adsorption energies and reaction barriers, enhancing PDH activity.

[2] "To examine the effect of new surface acid-base pairs created in the d-Al2O3(1 1 0) on the alkane DH mechanism and activation barriers, we selected two acid-base pairs, AlII-OII (pair d-A) and AlIII-OIII (pair d-B) highlighted in Fig. 7b, around the oxygen vacancy on the d-Al2O3(1 1 0), and two corresponding acid-base pairs on the s-Al2O3(1 1 0), AlIII-OII (pair s-A) and AlIV-OIII (pair s-B), respectively in (Fig. 7a)."

[3] "It can be deduced that changing the coordination number of Al by the oxygen vacancies to create the new defect pairs can be an effective way to tune the adsorption bond energy of the intermediates and the barriers of key steps to achieve regulating the performance of the PDH process."
