 Unfortunately this literature does not evaluate promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation, nor does it investigate supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation.

The literature focuses solely on the effect of oxygen vacancies on different crystal structures of alumina (Al2O3) for propane dehydrogenation. It does not explore metal-support interfacial effects.

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>  
[1] "Recently, a new perspective was proposed, alumina itself can play the role of PDH catalyst. Pure bulk Al2O3 materials [5], [6] show an intrinsic activity for selectively catalyzing propane and isobutane dehydrogenation."

[2] "The Alcu and neighbouring lattice oxygen (Lewis acid-base pairs) were proposed as active sites, which are created upon removal of OH-groups during alumina treatment at high temperatures."

[3] "Very recently, the reduced bulk ZrO2 [12], [13], [14], TiO2 [15], [16], W2O3 [17] nanoparticles with coordinatively unsaturated metal (Mcu)-O pairs, created by oxygen vacancies, have shown excellent PDH activity."

[4] "The heterolytic dissociation of H2 at oxygen vacancies of CeO2(1 1 1) facilitated by frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) consisting of spatially separated O and Ce sites [18]. The FLPs with enhanced acidity and basicity, constructed by three or more oxygen vacancies on CeO2(1 1 0), were active for breaking the CH bond of methane with low activation energy [19]."  

[5] "It is generally accepted that the Mcu-O created by oxygen vacancies are favorable for binding with alkyl and H, as the oxygen vacancies can effectively create more different surface acid-base site pairs with a unique coordination environment."
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. Specifically, it shows how creating oxygen vacancies in alumina forms coordinatively unsaturated Al-O Lewis acid-base pairs that serve as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. It also references work showing oxygen vacancies in ZrO2, TiO2, and CeO2 create similar active acid-base pairs for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

2. 是的,文章研究了调控金属氧化物的氧化态、氧素迁移性和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。具体来说,文章显示了在氧化铝中创建氧空位可以形成配位不饱和的Al-O Lewis酸碱基对,这些碱基对可以作为丙烷脱氢反应的活性中心。文章也引用了其他工作,显示ZrO2、TiO2 和CeO2中的氧空位也可以创建类似的酸碱基对,用于烷烃脱氢反应。

<quotes>
[1] "Giannis et al. [20] investigated the concerted and stepwise PDH reaction mechanisms on stoichiometric 110 γ-Al2O3 surface with or without OH, and found that alkane dehydrogenation activity depends on the strength of surface acid-base site pairs." 

[2] "However, the effect of oxygen vacancies neighbouring Alcu-O acid-base site pairs on the PDH performance and the reaction mechanism is still elusive."

[3] "To examine the effect of new surface acid-base pairs created in the d-Al2O3(1 1 0) on the alkane DH mechanism and activation barriers, we selected two acid-base pairs, AlII-OII (pair d-A) and AlIII-OIII (pair d-B) highlighted in Fig. 7b, around the oxygen vacancy on the d-Al2O3(1 1 0), and two corresponding acid-base pairs on the s-Al2O3(1 1 0), AlIII-OII (pair s-A) and AlIV-OIII (pair s-B), respectively in (Fig. 7a)."

[4] "In the following, we investigated the PDH on these corresponding acid-base pairs on the s-Al2O3(1 1 0) and d-Al2O3(1 1 0) for both the concerted and stepwise mechanisms."

[5] "It can be deduced that changing the coordination number of Al by the oxygen vacancies to create the new defect pairs can be an effective way to tune the adsorption bond energy of the intermediates and the barriers of key steps to achieve regulating the performance of the PDH process."

3. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied alumina catalysts. Specifically, it examines concerted and stepwise dehydrogenation mechanisms on stoichiometric and oxygen-deficient Al2O3 surfaces, looking at the effect of coordinatively unsaturated Al-O acid-base pairs created by oxygen vacancies on reaction barriers. It shows tuning the coordination environment of Al-O pairs by introducing vacancies effectively tunes adsorption energies and dehydrogenation barriers.

3. 是的,文章为所研究的氧化铝催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢的机理方案。具体来说,文章检验了顺式和分步脱氢机理在充足氧和缺氧Al2O3表面的作用,研究了氧空位产生的配位不饱和Al-O酸碱基对对反应势垒的影响。结果显示,通过引入空位调控Al-O配位环境可以有效调节吸附能和脱氢势垒。
