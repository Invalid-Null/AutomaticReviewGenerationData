To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key points made in each answer to the key points in the corresponding correct answer. I expressed consistency as either 100% (fully consistent) or 0% (completely inconsistent).

The answer3.txt file provided some inconsistent answers to questions 3, 5 and 6 compared to the correct answers, while the other files were fully consistent. Let me know if you have any other questions!
