<quotes>
[1] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have been widely investigated in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) owing to their high activity in CH cleavage and propylene selectivity."

[2] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as propane, is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, which requires very high reaction temperatures (773973 K) to achieve high olefin yields."  

[3] "Various strategies have been used to overcome these problems, such as alloying with other elements (e.g., Sn, (716) Zn, (1719) Ga, (2022) Cu, (2325) Fe, (26) GaPb, (27) and rare-earth (28)), and the introduction of base promoters (alkali ions such as K+) (7,8,14,15,29) on the support surface."

[4] "Pt/GaAL showed a remarkably enhanced propylene formation rate (0.17 mmolC3H6 gcat-1 s-1), indicating a great synergy between Ga and Pt."

[5] "Selective poisoning, in situ DRIFTS, and H2D2 exchange experiments clearly revealed that Ga3+ is responsible for the heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond in propane, while Pt0 facilitates the rate-determining H recombination via reverse spillover."

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts including Pt-Sn, Pt-Zn, Pt-Ga, Pt-Cu, and Pt-Fe for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on propylene formation rates showing a synergy between Pt and Ga in Pt-Ga/Al2O3 that gives greatly enhanced activity compared to Pt/Al2O3 or Ga/Al2O3 alone. Selective poisoning, in situ DRIFTS, and isotope exchange experiments provide insights into the bifunctional mechanism, with Ga responsible for C-H activation and Pt facilitating H recombination.

2. 是的,本文评估了Pt-Sn、Pt-Zn、Pt-Ga、Pt-Cu和Pt-Fe等Pt合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供了丙烯生成速率的数据,显示Pt和Ga在Pt-Ga/Al2O3上的协同作用大大提高了活性,相比单独的Pt/Al2O3或Ga/Al2O3。选择性毒化、原位DRIFTS和同位素交换实验提供了双功能机制方面的见解,Ga负责C-H活化,Pt有利于H重组。
