[1] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have been widely investigated in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) owing to their high activity in CH cleavage and propylene selectivity."

[2] "Under harsh reaction conditions, conventional Pt catalysts suffer from low olefin selectivity and fast deactivation via coke deposition."

[3] "It has been reported that the atomically dispersed Sn species on the defect-rich graphene surface can even stabilize Pt3 clusters."  

[4] "The Pt particle diameter (dsurf) of Pt/GaAL was 3.9 nm after the 1st cycle and increased to 11 nm after the 10th cycle, which could be attributed to the significant Pt sintering"

[5] "2Ce-Pt/GaAL exhibited a higher HD formation rate (6.2 mmolHD gcat−1 s−1) than Pt/GaAL after the 1st cycle and also showed a much higher retention of the HD formation rate after the 10th cycle (5.6 mmolHD gcat−1 s−1)."

<English version answer>

8. No, the article does not evaluate Cr2O3, Pt-Sn or Ga2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

9. No, the article does not investigate how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties affects propane dehydrogenation performance.

10. No, the article does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts.  

11. No, the article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

12. Yes, the article evaluates supported Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that Pt-based catalysts are active for C-H bond cleavage and propylene selectivity, but suffer from deactivation via coking under harsh reaction conditions.

13. Yes, the article investigates how Pt particle size and support interactions affect performance. It shows smaller Pt particles are more active, and interactions with supports like Sn-doped graphene or Ce-doped alumina can stabilize small Pt clusters and inhibit sintering.

14. No, the article does not propose full mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported Pt catalysts. It mainly focuses on the role of Pt in facilitating H2 recombination.

<Chinese version answer>

8. 不,文章没有评价Cr2O3、Pt-Sn或Ga2O3等金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。 

9. 不,文章没有研究调节氧化态、氧的迁移能力以及酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。

10. 不,文章没有为金属氧化物催化剂提出丙烷脱氢的机理方案。

11. 不,文章没有探讨金属氧化物催化剂中金属与载体间的界面效应对丙烷脱氢的影响。

12. 是的,文章评价了负载Pt催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它表明Pt基催化剂对C-H键的断裂和丙烯选择性很活跃,但在严苛的反应条件下会因焦炭积累而失活。

13. 是的,文章研究了Pt粒子大小和载体相互作用如何影响性能。它表明较小的Pt粒子更活跃,与Sn掺杂石墨烯或Ce掺杂氧化铝等载体的相互作用可以稳定小的Pt簇,抑制粗化。

14. 不,文章没有为负载Pt催化剂提出完整的丙烷脱氢反应机理途径。它主要关注Pt促进H2重组的作用。
