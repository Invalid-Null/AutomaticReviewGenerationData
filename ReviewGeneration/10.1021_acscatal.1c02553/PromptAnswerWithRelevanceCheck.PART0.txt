<English version answer>

2. The article explains that catalysts can facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the high activation energy barriers associated with the endothermic, equilibrium-limited nature of the reaction. It states that very high reaction temperatures (773-973 K) are required to achieve high olefin yields without catalysts.

</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>

2. 文章解释说,催化剂可以通过降低与反应的端othermic、平衡受限本质相关的高活化能障碍,来促进丙烷脱氢。它指出,如果不使用催化剂,必须使用非常高的反应温度(773-973 K)才能获得高烯烃收率。
