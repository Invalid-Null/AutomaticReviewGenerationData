[1] "The Ce-containing Pt/GaAL catalysts (denoted as xCe-Pt/GaAL; x indicates the wt % of Ce) were synthesized in a manner similar to Pt/GaAL but with the addition of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Samchun) into the aforementioned synthesis mixture."

[2] "Notable, we demonstrate that atomically dispersed Ce3+ on the γ-Al2O3 surface greatly suppresses the sintering of Pt0 particles by providing enhanced metal-support interactions, whereas discrete CeO2 domains stabilize Pt in the form of inactive Pt2+ species."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes adding different weight percentages of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O to Pt/GaAL catalysts during synthesis to control Ce dispersion. It finds that low Ce loading (2 wt%) results in atomically dispersed Ce that enhances metal-support interactions and suppresses Pt sintering, while higher Ce loading forms inactive CeO2 domains.

3. 是的,文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它描述了在合成过程中向Pt/GaAL催化剂中添加不同重量百分比的Ce(NO3)3·6H2O来控制Ce的分散。它发现低Ce负载(2 wt%)导致原子分散的Ce,增强了金属与支撑体之间的相互作用,抑制了Pt烧结;而较高的Ce负载形成了无活性的CeO2域。

[1] "In situ DRIFTS was carried out using a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) and a PIKE diffuse IR cell accessory." 

[2] "The oxidation state of Pt was additionally analyzed using XANES (Figures S18–S21)."

[3] "HAADF-STEM images and EDS elemental mapping images were acquired with a Titan cubed G2 60-300 microscope (FEI Co.) operating at 300 kV (KAIST Analysis Center for Research Advancement, KARA)."

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ DRIFTS to study surface species during propane dehydrogenation, XANES to probe changes in Pt oxidation state during cycling, and HAADF-STEM imaging with EDS mapping to characterize metal-support interfaces. These provide insights into the catalytic roles of Ga, Pt, and Ce in the system.

[2] "The Pt particle size distributions of the catalysts were investigated in the course of repeated PDH cycles using HAADF-STEM. The Pt particle diameter (dsurf) of Pt/GaAL was 3.9 nm after the 1st cycle and increased to 11 nm after the 10th cycle (Figure S9)."

<English version answer>  
5. Yes, the article employs HAADF-STEM imaging to characterize changes in Pt particle size distribution during repeated propane dehydrogenation cycles. This reveals significant Pt nanoparticle growth due to sintering in Pt/GaAL without Ce, but much better stability in 2Ce-Pt/GaAL where atomically dispersed Ce enhances metal-support interactions.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
5. 是的,文章采用HAADF-STEM成像表征了重复丙烷脱氢循环过程中Pt颗粒大小分布的变化。这揭示了没有Ce的Pt/GaAL中的Pt纳米颗粒由于烧结而发生显著生长,但2Ce-Pt/GaAL中的原子分散Ce增强了金属与支撑体之间的相互作用,稳定性要好得多。

<quotes>
[1] "The Pt oxidation state of Pt/GaAL and 2Ce-Pt/GaAL were maintained below 0.2 over the reaction cycles, indicating the predominant presence of metallic Pt0. Conversely, the Pt oxidation state of 20Ce-Pt/GaAL gradually increased and plateaued at 2+ with increasing reaction cycles. 10Ce-Pt/GaAL exhibited an intermediate behavior."

[2] "In the XANES fitting, the spectra of Pt foil and Na2Pt(OH)6 were used as references for Pt0 and Pt4+, respectively." 
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
6. Yes, the article uses XANES to probe changes in the Pt oxidation state during repeated propane dehydrogenation cycles. It finds that Pt remains reduced as Pt0 in Pt/GaAL and 2Ce-Pt/GaAL, but increases to Pt2+ in 10Ce-Pt/GaAL and 20Ce-Pt/GaAL where CeO2 forms, demonstrating that discrete CeO2 domains stabilize inactive Pt2+.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
6. 是的,文章使用XANES探测了重复丙烷脱氢循环过程中Pt氧化态的变化。它发现Pt保持还原为Pt0存在于Pt/GaAL和2Ce-Pt/GaAL中,但在10Ce-Pt/GaAL和20Ce-Pt/GaAL中增长为Pt2+,这表明离散的CeO2域稳定了无活性的Pt2+。
