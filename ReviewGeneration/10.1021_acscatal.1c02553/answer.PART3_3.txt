[1] "The Ga-containing samples exhibited typical XRD patterns of γ-Al2O3 without distinguishable peaks for the Ga2O3 polymorphs (Figure S1)."

[2] "In the pyridine FT-IR spectra (Figure S3), the samples showed five major bands at 1612, 1595, 1576, 1490, and 1448 cm1, all of which could be assigned to pyridine coordinated to Lewis acid sites." 

[3] "Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 (Figure S4) revealed that GaAL and Pt/GaAL possessed larger amounts of strong acid sites (0.250.26 mmol g1) than Pt/AL (0.11 mmol g1) (Table 1), indicating that Ga doping of γ-Al2O3 enhanced the formation of strong Lewis acid sites."

[4] "To analyze the Ce structure of xCe-Pt/GaAL samples, we first investigated the Pt-free xCe-GaAL samples using HAADF-STEM, as the dispersed Pt and Ce species are difficult to distinguish." 

[5] "The investigation revealed that Ce mainly existed as an atomically dispersed species in 2Ce-GaAL (Figure 5a)."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it examines using a one-pot sol-gel synthesis method to incorporate gallium into the γ-Al2O3 framework to form solid solutions, as evidenced by typical XRD patterns for γ-Al2O3 (Quote 1). It also investigates loading optimal amounts of cerium (2 wt%) to achieve predominantly atomically dispersed cerium species on the γ-Al2O3 support, as shown by HAADF-STEM imaging (Quote 5).

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ DRIFTS to study propane dehydrogenation catalysts during reaction, revealing the formation of Ga-H and Pt-H species from propane dissociation over Pt/Ga/Al2O3 (Quote 1). It also employs XANES spectroscopy to probe changes in Pt oxidation state during repeated reaction-regeneration cycles (Quote 2).
