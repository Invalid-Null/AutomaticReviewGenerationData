[1] "To understand the catalytic roles of Ga and Pt, we prepared three γ-Al2O3 catalysts containing Ga (denoted as GaAL), Pt (Pt/AL), and both of Ga and Pt (Pt/GaAL)."

[2] "The Ce-containing Pt/GaAL catalysts (denoted as xCe-Pt/GaAL; x indicates the wt % of Ce) were synthesized in a manner similar to Pt/GaAL but with the addition of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Samchun) into the aforementioned synthesis mixture."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It prepares γ-Al2O3 catalysts containing Ga, Pt, or both by a one-pot sol-gel synthesis method. It also prepares Ce-containing Pt/GaAL catalysts with different Ce loadings to study the effect of Ce on catalyst performance.

[1] "In situ DRIFTS was carried out using a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) and a PIKE diffuse IR cell accessory. The samples were pretreated at 773 K for 4 h under He flow. After collecting the background spectra, propane (5 kPa C3H8/He) was introduced into the sample cell (10 mL min−1) for 30 min at 773 K." 

[2] "XPS measurements were carried out using a K-Alpha (Thermo Scientific) instrument equipped with a microfocused monochromator X-ray source."

[3] "The Ce K-edge (40443 eV) EXAFS and Pt LIII-edge (11570 eV) XANES data were collected in fluorescence mode at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (10C-XAFS beamline)."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article utilizes in-situ DRIFTS to study adsorbed species during propane dehydrogenation, XPS to analyze surface chemical states, and XAFS/XANES to probe changes in metal oxidation states during reaction. These techniques provide insights into the catalytic roles of different elements and changes occurring during repeated reaction-regeneration cycles.

[1] "The Pt oxidation state of Pt/GaAL and 2Ce-Pt/GaAL was maintained below 0.2 over the reaction cycles, indicating the predominant presence of metallic Pt0. Conversely, the Pt oxidation state of 20Ce-Pt/GaAL gradually increased and plateaued at 2+ with increasing reaction cycles."

[2] "To evaluate the average oxidation state of Pt, XANES spectra were evaluated by the linear combination fitting (LCF) analysis (from 30 to +50 eV). In the XANES fitting, the spectra of Pt foil and Na2Pt(OH)6 were used as references for Pt0 and Pt4+, respectively."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article uses XANES to probe changes in Pt oxidation state during repeated propane dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. It shows that Pt/GaAL and 2Ce-Pt/GaAL maintain Pt0, while 20Ce-Pt/GaAL shows an increase in Pt oxidation state to Pt2+. This provides insights into the stabilization of different Pt species by Ga and Ce promoters.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:本文利用XANES探测重复丙烷脱氢-再生循环过程中Pt氧化态的变化。结果显示,Pt/GaAL和2Ce-Pt/GaAL维持Pt0,而20Ce-Pt/GaAL的Pt氧化态增加到Pt2+。这提供了Ga和Ce促进剂对不同Pt物种稳定性的见解。
