I carefully compared the content of each answer file to the correct answers provided. For each question, I calculated the consistency percentage between 0-100% based on whether the provided answer contained the same key information as the correct answer. Questions without relevant quotes were considered 100% consistent if both answered no. Let me know if you have any other questions!
