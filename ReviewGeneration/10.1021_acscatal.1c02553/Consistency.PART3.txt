 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative answer files, I have compiled the following analysis of the consistency between each answer file and the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "80%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "90%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "90%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "90%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "80%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "90%"}, 
  "5": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "90%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "90%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "90%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "90%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "90%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I examined the content of each answer file and compared it to the correct answers to determine the consistency percentage for each question. Files with no relevant content were scored 0%, while those with identical answers to the correct answers were scored 100%. For partially consistent answers, I estimated a percentage based on the degree of overlap with the correct information.
