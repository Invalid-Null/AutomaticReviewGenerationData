[1] The ultimate goal of catalysis research is the development of novel catalysts with a desirable catalytic activity, high selectivity for target products and long-term durability. Pt-based catalysts that are used widely in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene encounter multiple problems, such as high manufacturing cost, uncontrollable dispersion, easy aggregation and rapid deactivation at elevated operating temperatures.

[2] An efficient propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process relies on the propensity to break carbonhydrogen (CH) bonds while simultaneously suppressing the cleavage of carboncarbon (CC) bonds. For a direct PDH process without oxygen, adsorption of the propane molecule, activation of CH bonds and fast desorption of the propylene product from the catalytically active sites are very important. Pt-based catalysts have been used widely in PDH because of their selective activation of CH bonds rather than CC bonds.

[3] Dispersing single atoms or subnanometric clusters of a metal precisely within confined spaces may be an alternative way to maximize atom utilization. However, when the metal active sites are dispersed at the scale of subnanometre clusters or even single atoms, the surface free energy of the metal species will increase, intensifying their agglomeration. This makes subnanometre clusters and single atoms susceptible to severe high-temperature deactivation, even in the presence of strong metalsupport interactions.

[4] More effective ways are thus being sought to immobilize and disperse single atoms or subnanometric clusters onto specific anchoring sites of the supports. So far, with the exception of a few confining supports based on bulk metals or oxides, porous materials such as crystalline zeolites have been selected as useful carriers, in the micropores of which metal species have been encapsulated using various means to suppress their aggregation.

1. The article discusses the importance and value of propylene, which has wide applications in the chemical industry. It states that propane dehydrogenation is an important route for propylene production. 

2. The article explains that catalysts promote propane dehydrogenation by selectively activating C-H bonds over C-C bonds. This reduces the activation energy barriers for breaking C-H bonds to produce propylene.

3. The article introduces supported metals, alloys, and zeolites as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Specific examples like Pt-based catalysts are provided.

4. The article discusses thermodynamic constraints and kinetics of propane dehydrogenation. It states the reaction requires breaking C-H bonds while avoiding C-C bonds. Fast desorption of propylene is also important.
