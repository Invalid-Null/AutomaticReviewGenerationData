         [1] Integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC-STEM) images40 for ultra-stable Pt-A-2h(31)-R and Pt-free UTL-C.  

         [2] The iDPC-STEM images acquired from the Pt-free UTL-C sample show empty channels, confirming that the adsorbed organic species can be removed effectively via heating treatment.  

         [3] The iDPC-STEM images of Pt-A-2h(31)-R show clear contrasts inside the 14-MR channels, which are apparently off-centre in the channel but close to the d4r units.

         [4] In our case, the Ge-UTL germanosilicates with a large skeleton-Ge content and a stabilized structure are promising to highly disperse and stabilize the Pt species.

         Yes, the article describes using acidic treatment of UTL-type germanosilicates to create isolated single sites within the zeolite pores, anchored to framework germanium species. It also discusses using Ge-UTL supports with high skeleton germanium content and stabilized structure to disperse and stabilize subnanometric platinum clusters. Advanced microscopy provides direct images of the isolated platinum species confined within the zeolite channels in proximity to germanium-rich regions.

         [4] Subsequent XAFS results on the catalyst precursors without H2 reduction clarified that skeleton-Ge-induced anchoring of guest Pt (from H2PtCl6) was the key to the formation of such PtOGe species.

         [5] The Pt-A-2h(31)-R catalyst showed the highest propane conversion together with the best stability.

      <English>
         Yes, the article evaluates encapsulating platinum species within the zeolite pores using germanosilicate supports to enhance propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. Data demonstrates a Pt@Ge-UTL catalyst with zeolite-encapsulated platinum exhibits ultrahigh stability for over 4000 hours under propane dehydrogenation conditions. In situ XAFS confirms platinum is anchored to framework germanium sites via Pt-O-Ge bonds, preventing agglomeration.

         是的,文章评估了使用锗硅酸盐载体在沸石孔内封装铂物种以提高丙烷脱氢催化剂的稳定性。数据证明了一个带有分子筛包裹的铂的Pt@Ge-UTL催化剂在丙烷脱氢条件下超过4000小时展示了超高稳定性。原位XAFS证实了铂通过Pt-O-Ge键锚定在框架锗位点上,防止了聚集。

      <Quotes>
         [2] We use a thermally/hydrothermally stable UTL-type germanosilicate (Ge-UTL), obtained via acidic treatment, as an alternative support to confine the Pt species, aiming to take advantage of its extra-large 14-membered-ring (14-MR) pores, high content of stable skeleton-Ge species and the specific d4r subunits.

         [3] The Pt@Ge-UTL catalyst was readily prepared from the Ge-UTL carrier and H2PtCl6 via simple wet impregnation and subsequent H2 reduction.

      <English>
         Yes, the article investigates methods like acidic treatment of germanosilicate UTL zeolites, wet impregnation of platinum precursors, and subsequent H2 reduction to synthesize propane dehydrogenation catalysts with optimized platinum dispersion. Using supports with high germanium content and thermally stable structure enables confinement and anchoring of subnanometric platinum clusters within the zeolite pores, preventing agglomeration.

         [4] Subsequent XAFS results on the catalyst precursors without H2 reduction clarified that skeleton-Ge-induced anchoring of guest Pt (from H2PtCl6) was the key to the formation of such PtOGe species. 

         [5] EXAFS was used to detect the local atomic structure and acquire the structural parameters of coordination number and bond length values.

         [6] The scattering path of GeOPt bonds was observed at 2.93Å in Pt-A-2h(31)-R, which confirmed that the Pt atom was fixed on the Ge-UTL zeolite through the formation of PtOGe bonds.

      <English>
         Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy to probe the local coordination environment and oxidation state changes enabling the formation of Pt-O-Ge anchoring sites during catalyst synthesis steps. This anchored the platinum and prevented agglomeration, contributing to the high stability.
