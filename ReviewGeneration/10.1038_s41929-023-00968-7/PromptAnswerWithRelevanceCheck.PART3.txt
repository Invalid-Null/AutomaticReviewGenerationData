[1] Integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC-STEM) images40 for ultra-stable Pt-A-2h(31)-R and Pt-free UTL-C. 

[2] The iDPC-STEM images acquired from the Pt-free UTL-C sample show empty channels, confirming that the adsorbed organic species can be removed effectively via heating treatment. 

[3] The iDPC-STEM images of Pt-A-2h(31)-R show clear contrasts inside the 14-MR channels, which are apparently off-centre in the channel but close to the d4r units.

[4] To provide more solid proof on whether or not and how the skeleton-Ge sites interact with the Pt species to induce an orientated dispersion, an in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) study was carried out on Pt-A-2h(31)-R and compared with monometallic reference compounds.

[5] EXAFS was used to detect the local atomic structure and acquire the structural parameters of coordination number and bond length values. 

[6] The scattering path of GeOPt bonds was observed at 2.93Å in Pt-A-2h(31)-R, which confirmed that the Pt atom was fixed on the Ge-UTL zeolite through the formation of PtOGe bonds.

[1] In particular, the two CO molecules in the Pt(CO)2 species are coordinated to Pt atoms that are not interacting with the zeolite framework of the zeolite-channel-confined subnanometric Pt clusters.

[2] We use a thermally/hydrothermally stable UTL-type germanosilicate (Ge-UTL), obtained via acidic treatment, as an alternative support to confine the Pt species, aiming to take advantage of its extra-large 14-membered-ring (14-MR) pores, high content of stable skeleton-Ge species and the specific d4r subunits.

[3] The Pt@Ge-UTL catalyst was readily prepared from the Ge-UTL carrier and H2PtCl6 via simple wet impregnation and subsequent H2 reduction.

[4] Subsequent XAFS results on the catalyst precursors without H2 reduction clarified that skeleton-Ge-induced anchoring of guest Pt (from H2PtCl6) was the key to the formation of such PtOGe species.

[5] The Pt-A-2h(31)-R catalyst showed the highest propane conversion together with the best stability.

[6] iDPC-STEM images of Pt-A-2h(31)-R show clear contrasts inside the 14-MR channels, which are apparently off-centre in the channel but close to the d4r units.

[1] "Here we report the design and synthesis of a durable supported-metal-cluster catalyst, Pt@Ge-UTL, that features subnanometric Pt clusters encapsulated inside the extra-large pores of a stabilized UTL-type germanosilicate."

[2] "This is achieved by selectively and directionally anchoring Pt, via PtOGe bonding, to the UTL zeolites unique secondary building units that feature a double-four-membered-ring (d4r) configuration and a Ge-enriched composition."

[3] "In situ X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) study was carried out on Pt-A-2h(31)-R and compared with monometallic reference compounds."

[4] "The Pt L3-edge normalized X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum showed that Ptδ+ (0<δ<1) was clearly observed in Pt-A-2h(31)-R after H2 treatment in situ." 

[5] "The scattering path of GeOPt bonds was observed at 2.93Å in Pt-A-2h(31)-R, which confirmed that the Pt atom was fixed on the Ge-UTL zeolite through the formation of PtOGe bonds."

[6] "We then carried out kinetics simulations on the microscopic level to obtain more detailed insights into the catalytic performance."

[7] "Combining the DFT calculations and microscopic kinetics simulations, we can conclude that the catalyst with the Pt4-Ge2-d4r@UTL structure can effectively lower the energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step, which is the rate-determining step of the entire PDH reaction, and thus promote the PDH reaction rate."
