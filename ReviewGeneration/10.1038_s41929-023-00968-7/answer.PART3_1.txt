[1] In particular, the two CO molecules in the Pt(CO)2 species are coordinated to Pt atoms that are not interacting with the zeolite framework of the zeolite-channel-confined subnanometric Pt clusters.

[2] We use a thermally/hydrothermally stable UTL-type germanosilicate (Ge-UTL), obtained via acidic treatment, as an alternative support to confine the Pt species, aiming to take advantage of its extra-large 14-membered-ring (14-MR) pores, high content of stable skeleton-Ge species and the specific d4r subunits.

[3] The Pt@Ge-UTL catalyst was readily prepared from the Ge-UTL carrier and H2PtCl6 via simple wet impregnation and subsequent H2 reduction.

[4] Subsequent XAFS results on the catalyst precursors without H2 reduction clarified that skeleton-Ge-induced anchoring of guest Pt (from H2PtCl6) was the key to the formation of such PtOGe species.

[5] The Pt-A-2h(31)-R catalyst showed the highest propane conversion together with the best stability.

[6] iDPC-STEM images of Pt-A-2h(31)-R show clear contrasts inside the 14-MR channels, which are apparently off-centre in the channel but close to the d4r units.

[7] 19F MAS NMR spectra (a,b) and possible structural models (c,d) of the Pt-free support A-2h(31) (a,c) and the catalyst Pt-A-2h(31)-R (b,d).

1. Yes, the article describes using acidic treatment of UTL-type germanosilicates to create isolated single sites within the zeolite pores, anchored to framework germanium species. This is done by optimizing the Si/Ge ratio and stabilizing the zeolite structure.

2. Yes, the article evaluates using the stabilized UTL zeolite with germanium to encapsulate platinum clusters, which enhances propane dehydrogenation stability compared to Pt/Al2O3. Data on conversion, selectivity over time and regeneration cycles demonstrates the high stability.

3. Yes, the article investigates wet impregnation methods and varying the Si/Ge ratio to optimize platinum dispersion within the zeolite pores. Lower Si/Ge ratios gave better platinum encapsulation and dispersion.

4. Yes, the article uses in-situ XAFS, in-situ infrared spectroscopy, and in-situ XRD to study the working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. This revealed details on platinum oxidation states, bonding, and cluster sizes during reaction.

5. Yes, the article uses iDPC-STEM and HAADF-STEM microscopy to characterize the platinum-zeolite interface. This revealed the location of sub-nanometric platinum clusters anchored near germanium-rich regions. 

6. Yes, the article uses XANES to probe platinum oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation. This showed platinum is partially oxidized during reaction.

7. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types. It only uses a fixed bed reactor for propane dehydrogenation studies.

1. 是的,这篇文章描述了使用对UTL型锗硅酸盐进行酸处理来在分子筛孔内创建隔离的单个位点,这些位点锚定在骨架锗上。这是通过优化Si/Ge比例和稳定分子筛结构来实现的。

2. 是的,文章评估了使用稳定的含锗UTL分子筛来封装铂簇,这提高了丙烷脱氢的稳定性,相比Pt/Al2O3。转换率、选择性随时间的数据和再生循环证明了其高稳定性。

3. 是的,文章研究了湿法浸渍方法和变化Si/Ge比例来优化铂在分子筛孔内的分散度。较低的Si/Ge比例实现了更好的铂封装和分散。

4. 是的,文章使用原位XAFS、原位红外光谱和原位XRD来��究工作中的丙烷脱氢催化剂。这揭示了反应过程中铂的氧化态、化学键和簇大小的细节。

5. 是的,文章使用iDPC-STEM和HAADF-STEM显微技术来表征铂-分子筛界面。这揭示了亚纳米铂簇锚定在锗丰富区域附近的位置。

6. 是的,文章使用XANES来探究丙烷脱氢过程中铂的氧化态变化。结果显示反应过程中铂被部分氧化。

7. 否,文章没有评估不同的反应器类型。它仅使用固定床反应器进行丙烷脱氢研究。
