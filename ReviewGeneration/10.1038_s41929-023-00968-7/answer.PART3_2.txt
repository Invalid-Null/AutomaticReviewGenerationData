[1] "Here we report the design and synthesis of a durable supported-metal-cluster catalyst, Pt@Ge-UTL, that features subnanometric Pt clusters encapsulated inside the extra-large pores of a stabilized UTL-type germanosilicate."

[2] "This is achieved by selectively and directionally anchoring Pt, via PtOGe bonding, to the UTL zeolites unique secondary building units that feature a double-four-membered-ring (d4r) configuration and a Ge-enriched composition."

[3] "In situ X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) study was carried out on Pt-A-2h(31)-R and compared with monometallic reference compounds."

[4] "The Pt L3-edge normalized X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum showed that Ptδ+ (0<δ<1) was clearly observed in Pt-A-2h(31)-R after H2 treatment in situ." 

[5] "The scattering path of GeOPt bonds was observed at 2.93Å in Pt-A-2h(31)-R, which confirmed that the Pt atom was fixed on the Ge-UTL zeolite through the formation of PtOGe bonds."

[6] "We then carried out kinetics simulations on the microscopic level to obtain more detailed insights into the catalytic performance."

[7] "Combining the DFT calculations and microscopic kinetics simulations, we can conclude that the catalyst with the Pt4-Ge2-d4r@UTL structure can effectively lower the energy barrier of the first dehydrogenation step, which is the rate-determining step of the entire PDH reaction, and thus promote the PDH reaction rate."

1. Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. Specifically, it discusses selectively anchoring platinum atoms to double four-membered rings containing germanium in a UTL zeolite via Pt-O-Ge bonding. This anchors and isolates the Pt active sites.

2. Yes, the article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides examples of encapsulating subnanometric platinum clusters within the pores of germanosilicate UTL zeolites, which enhances the catalyst stability compared to conventional Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. In situ EXAFS data confirms the anchoring of Pt via Pt-O-Ge bonds, which prevents agglomeration.

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like stabilizing the zeolite framework with dealumination and using germanosilicate supports to anchor platinum species. This prevents sintering and agglomeration, resulting in highly dispersed subnanometric Pt clusters.

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques like EXAFS to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. This revealed details on the local coordination environment of Pt such as the Pt-O-Ge anchoring and an average cluster size of 4 Pt atoms.

5. Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like aberration corrected STEM and iDPC-STEM to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. This provided insights into the location of subnanometric Pt clusters confined near double four-membered rings within the zeolite channels.

6. Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques like in situ EXAFS to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. The XANES spectra revealed the partial reduction of Pt species to Ptδ+ after H2 treatment and the lack of reduction of framework Ge atoms.

7. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses solely on fixed bed catalyst testing.
