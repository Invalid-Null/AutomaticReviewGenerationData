<quotes>

[1] The ultimate goal of catalysis research is the development of novel catalysts with a desirable catalytic activity, high selectivity for target products and long-term durability. Pt-based catalysts that are used widely in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene encounter multiple problems, such as high manufacturing cost, uncontrollable dispersion, easy aggregation and rapid deactivation at elevated operating temperatures.

[2] An efficient propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process relies on the propensity to break carbonhydrogen (CH) bonds while simultaneously suppressing the cleavage of carboncarbon (CC) bonds. For a direct PDH process without oxygen, adsorption of the propane molecule, activation of CH bonds and fast desorption of the propylene product from the catalytically active sites are very important. Pt-based catalysts have been used widely in PDH because of their selective activation of CH bonds rather than CC bonds.

[3] Dispersing single atoms or subnanometric clusters of a metal precisely within confined spaces may be an alternative way to maximize atom utilization. However, when the metal active sites are dispersed at the scale of subnanometre clusters or even single atoms, the surface free energy of the metal species will increase, intensifying their agglomeration. This makes subnanometre clusters and single atoms susceptible to severe high-temperature deactivation, even in the presence of strong metalsupport interactions.

[4] More effective ways are thus being sought to immobilize and disperse single atoms or subnanometric clusters onto specific anchoring sites of the supports. So far, with the exception of a few confining supports based on bulk metals or oxides, porous materials such as crystalline zeolites have been selected as useful carriers, in the micropores of which metal species have been encapsulated using various means to suppress their aggregation.

[1] Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic equilibrium reaction that converts propane into propylene and hydrogen.[36] Propylene is one of the most demanded basic petrochemicals that is widely used to produce various derivatives, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and so forth.[2] The huge demand for propylene has promoted further development of PDH technology.

[1] These catalysts are expected to rupture the C-H bond of propane while avoiding excessive cracking of the C-C bond to produce byproducts.[1] Pt-based catalysts have been used widely in PDH because of their selective activation of C-H bonds rather than C-C bonds.[5] For a direct PDH process without oxygen, adsorption of the propane molecule, activation of C-H bonds and fast desorption of the propylene product from the catalytically active sites are very important.[23]

[2] For the Pt4-Ge2-d4r@UTL site, despite the second dehydrogenation having a higher barrier and H2 formation exhibiting the highest energy barrier in the calculated energy diagram, the rate-determining step is the first dehydrogenation step because the reaction rate for the second dehydrogenation and H2 formation steps is restricted by the concentration of C3H7* and H* species, respectively (that is, the product of the first dehydrogenation step).[71]

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article explains that catalysts lower activation barriers for propane dehydrogenation by selectively activating C-H bonds over C-C bonds. Pt-based catalysts in particular activate C-H bonds preferentially. Key steps facilitated by catalysts are adsorption of propane, cleavage of C-H bonds, and desorption of propylene. DFT calculations showed the first C-H bond cleavage is the rate limiting step.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

2.文章解释了,催化剂通过选择性激活碳氢键而不是碳碳键来降低丙烷脱氢的活化能垒。尤其铂基催化剂优先激活碳氢键。催化剂促进的关键步骤是丙烷的吸附、碳氢键的断裂和丙烯的脱附。 DFT计算表明,第一次碳氢键断裂是速率控制步骤。

[1] Metal oxides, especially chromium oxide, have been used in commercial plants but suffer from rapid deactivation.[1,3,4] Supported noble metal catalysts demonstrated much higher activity and stability.[5–7]

[2] Dispersing single atoms or subnanometric clusters of a metal precisely within confined spaces may be an alternative way to maximize atom utilization.[1,2] However, when the metal active sites are dispersed at the scale of subnanometre clusters or even single atoms, the surface free energy of the metal species will increase, intensifying their agglomeration.[3,4]

[3] Porous materials such as crystalline zeolites have been selected as useful carriers, in the micropores of which metal species have been encapsulated using various means to suppress their aggregation.[8–12]

3. The article introduces metal oxides, supported metals, and zeolites as catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation. Metal oxides like chromium oxide are used commercially but deactivate rapidly. Supported noble metals like Pt show higher activity and stability but still aggregate. Zeolites have been studied to encapsulate metal species like Pt within pores to suppress aggregation.

3.文章介绍了金属氧化物、负载金属和分子筛等催化剂类别在丙烷脱氢方面的研究。例如商业上使用的铬氧化物快速失活。负载的贵金属如铂活性和稳定性更高,但仍会聚合。人们研究过分子筛等来固定金属活性种如铂在孔道内,抑制其聚合。

[1] An efficient propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process relies on the propensity to break carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds while simultaneously suppressing the cleavage of carboncarbon (CC) bonds.[1]

[2] Subsequent XAFS results on the catalyst precursors without H2 reduction clarified that skeleton-Ge-induced anchoring of guest Pt (from H2PtCl6) was the key to the formation of such PtOGe species.

[3] The first dehydrogenation step is endothermic by 24.2kJmol−1 with a barrier of 79.1kJmol−1. Then, the second H* detached from a methyl group bonds at a bridge site of the Pt(111) surface, which is endothermic by 62.7kJmol−1 and must overcome a barrier of 78.2kJmol−1.

[4] The calculated activation energy for Pt4-Ge2-d4r@UTL is close to the experimental value (Supplementary Fig. 20b) and lower than that for Pt(111).

<English version answer>

4. The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation relies on preferentially breaking C-H bonds over C-C bonds. It provides quantitative thermodynamic and kinetic details from DFT calculations, such as endothermic energies and activation barriers for each dehydrogenation step on Pt(111) and Pt4-Ge2-d4r@UTL sites. The calculated barriers match experimental values.

4.文章讨论了丙烷脱氢依赖于优先断裂碳氢键而不是碳碳键。文章提供了DFT计算的热力学和动力学定量细节,如在Pt(111)和 Pt4-Ge2-d4r@UTL位点上每个脱氢步骤的吸热能量和活化能垒。计算出的能垒与实验值吻合。
