[1] Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an endothermic equilibrium reaction that converts propane into propylene and hydrogen.[36] Propylene is one of the most demanded basic petrochemicals that is widely used to produce various derivatives, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and so forth.[2] The huge demand for propylene has promoted further development of PDH technology.

[1] These catalysts are expected to rupture the C-H bond of propane while avoiding excessive cracking of the C-C bond to produce byproducts.[1] Pt-based catalysts have been used widely in PDH because of their selective activation of C-H bonds rather than C-C bonds.[5] For a direct PDH process without oxygen, adsorption of the propane molecule, activation of C-H bonds and fast desorption of the propylene product from the catalytically active sites are very important.[23]

[2] For the Pt4-Ge2-d4r@UTL site, despite the second dehydrogenation having a higher barrier and H2 formation exhibiting the highest energy barrier in the calculated energy diagram, the rate-determining step is the first dehydrogenation step because the reaction rate for the second dehydrogenation and H2 formation steps is restricted by the concentration of C3H7* and H* species, respectively (that is, the product of the first dehydrogenation step).[71]

2. The article explains that catalysts lower activation barriers for propane dehydrogenation by selectively activating C-H bonds over C-C bonds. Pt-based catalysts in particular activate C-H bonds preferentially. Key steps facilitated by catalysts are adsorption of propane, cleavage of C-H bonds, and desorption of propylene. DFT calculations showed the first C-H bond cleavage is the rate limiting step.

[1] Metal oxides, especially chromium oxide, have been used in commercial plants but suffer from rapid deactivation.[1,3,4] Supported noble metal catalysts demonstrated much higher activity and stability.[5–7]

[2] Dispersing single atoms or subnanometric clusters of a metal precisely within confined spaces may be an alternative way to maximize atom utilization.[1,2] However, when the metal active sites are dispersed at the scale of subnanometre clusters or even single atoms, the surface free energy of the metal species will increase, intensifying their agglomeration.[3,4]

[3] Porous materials such as crystalline zeolites have been selected as useful carriers, in the micropores of which metal species have been encapsulated using various means to suppress their aggregation.[8–12]

[4] Pt-based catalysts that are used widely in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene encounter multiple problems, such as high manufacturing cost, uncontrollable dispersion, easy aggregation and rapid deactivation at elevated operating temperatures.[1]

3. The article introduces metal oxides, supported metals, and zeolites as catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation. Metal oxides like chromium oxide are used commercially but deactivate rapidly. Supported noble metals like Pt show higher activity and stability but still aggregate. Zeolites have been studied to encapsulate metal species like Pt within pores to suppress aggregation.

[1] An efficient propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process relies on the propensity to break carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds while simultaneously suppressing the cleavage of carboncarbon (CC) bonds.[1]

[2] Subsequent XAFS results on the catalyst precursors without H2 reduction clarified that skeleton-Ge-induced anchoring of guest Pt (from H2PtCl6) was the key to the formation of such PtOGe species.

[3] The first dehydrogenation step is endothermic by 24.2kJmol−1 with a barrier of 79.1kJmol−1. Then, the second H* detached from a methyl group bonds at a bridge site of the Pt(111) surface, which is endothermic by 62.7kJmol−1 and must overcome a barrier of 78.2kJmol−1.

[4] The calculated activation energy for Pt4-Ge2-d4r@UTL is close to the experimental value (Supplementary Fig. 20b) and lower than that for Pt(111).

4. The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation relies on preferentially breaking C-H bonds over C-C bonds. It provides quantitative thermodynamic and kinetic details from DFT calculations, such as endothermic energies and activation barriers for each dehydrogenation step on Pt(111) and Pt4-Ge2-d4r@UTL sites. The calculated barriers match experimental values.
