[1] Integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC-STEM) images40 for ultra-stable Pt-A-2h(31)-R and Pt-free UTL-C. 

[2] The iDPC-STEM images acquired from the Pt-free UTL-C sample show empty channels, confirming that the adsorbed organic species can be removed effectively via heating treatment. 

[3] The iDPC-STEM images of Pt-A-2h(31)-R show clear contrasts inside the 14-MR channels, which are apparently off-centre in the channel but close to the d4r units.

[4] To provide more solid proof on whether or not and how the skeleton-Ge sites interact with the Pt species to induce an orientated dispersion, an in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) study was carried out on Pt-A-2h(31)-R and compared with monometallic reference compounds.

[5] EXAFS was used to detect the local atomic structure and acquire the structural parameters of coordination number and bond length values. 

[6] The scattering path of GeOPt bonds was observed at 2.93Å in Pt-A-2h(31)-R, which confirmed that the Pt atom was fixed on the Ge-UTL zeolite through the formation of PtOGe bonds.
