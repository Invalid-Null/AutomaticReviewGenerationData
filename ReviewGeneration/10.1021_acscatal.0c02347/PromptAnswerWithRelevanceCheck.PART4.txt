</Answer>
<Answer>
 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that address any of the questions about propane dehydrogenation. The article focuses entirely on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using sulfate-modified NiAl mixed oxide catalysts. It does not mention propane dehydrogenation or any of the specific topics raised in the questions.
