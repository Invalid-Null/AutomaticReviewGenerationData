 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative files, here is the JSON structure comparing the consistency of each answer file:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer0.txt": "0%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"}
}
```

The consistency ratio for each file and question is determined by comparing the provided answers to the correct answers. Files with no relevant answers are scored 0%, while files with fully consistent answers are scored 100%.
