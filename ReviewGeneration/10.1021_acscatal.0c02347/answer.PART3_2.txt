[1] The NiAl metal-oxide catalysts were obtained by drying the precursor materials at 80 C overnight, followed by calcination at 600 C for 3 h.

[2] Here, 0, 0.003, or 0.05 mol of SDS was added as a surfactant into the liquid suspension. 

[3] Separation was conducted by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min, and the separated solid was washed multiple times with deionized water.

[4] The NiAl LDH precursor materials synthesized with 0.05 and 0.003 mol SDS are denoted herein as ultrathin LDH-1 and LDH-2, respectively.

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies the use of sulfate surfactants like SDS during hydrotalcite synthesis to control layer thickness and create ultrathin LDH precursors. These ultrathin LDHs led to catalysts with higher NiO dispersion and surface area.

[1] X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was conducted on a VG ESCALAB210 apparatus using an Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV). 

[2] The Ni 2p3/2 spectra can be divided into two characteristic peaks with binding energies of 854.6 and 856.2 eV, which are ascribed to Ni2+ and Ni3+ species, respectively.

[3] The atomic concentration ratios of the Ni3+/Ni2+ states for the NiAl-S1, NiAl-S2, and NiAl-B catalysts are determined from the respective areas under the characteristic peaks as 2.6, 1.8, and 1.5, respectively, indicating that the NiAl-S1 catalyst includes the greatest proportion of Ni3+ states.
