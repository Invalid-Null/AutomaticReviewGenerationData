[1] "The NiAl-S1 catalyst possesses the highest dispersion of NiO."

[2] "The decreased lower CN values in the NiNi shells can originate from the decrease of grain size of NiO from 4.9 nm for NiAl-B to 4.0 nm for NiAl-S1"  

[3] "The Ni3+ species affected by sulfate are inert to dissociate N2O, which would decrease the active sites to produce adjacent Ni3+O species. Hence, the isolated oxygen species on NiAl-S1 catalyst leads to the negligible N2O conversion."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies the use of sulfate modifiers and ultrathin layered double hydroxide precursors to obtain high dispersion of NiO species in NiAl mixed oxide catalysts, as evidenced by the smaller NiO grain size and reduced coordination number in NiNi shells for the sulfate-modified catalysts.

答:是的,这篇文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它研究了使用硫酸根修饰剂和超薄层状双氢氧化物前驱体来获得NiAl混合氧化物催化剂中NiO物种的高分散度,这可以从硫酸根修饰的催化剂中较小的NiO晶粒尺寸和NiNi壳层中的配位数降低中看出。

[1] "The dissociative adsorption of N2O on surface Ni2+ sites generates Ni3+O species and N2 as follows." 

[2] "An indicator of oxygen species coordination can be obtained by employing N2O as a probe gas due to the well-known first step of N2O dissociative adsorption to form an O atom and an N2 molecule."

[3] "The decomposition rates of N2O in the presence and absence of C2H6 were compared (Figure 3e) to further identify the coordination state of surface oxygen species."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ N2O decomposition studies to characterize the coordination state of surface oxygen species on the catalysts. It shows that N2O can dissociatively adsorb on Ni2+ sites to generate Ni3+O and N2, allowing N2O to be used as a probe for adjacent oxygen species. The coordination state is further verified by comparing N2O decomposition with and without ethane present.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,这篇文章利用了原位N2O分解研究来表征催化剂表面氧物种的配位状态。它显示N2O可以在Ni2+位点上解离吸附生成Ni3+O和N2,使N2O可以用作相邻氧物种的探针。通过比较有无乙烷存在下的N2O分解结果来进一步验证配位状态。

[1] "With respect to the catalyst materials, TEM results (Figure 2df) indicate that the NiAl-S1 catalyst possesses the highest dispersion of NiO."

[2] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results for the NiAl-S1 and NiAl-S2 catalysts (Figure S5) show two specific S 2p3/2 peaks with the binding energies at 169.0 and 168.4 eV, which can be assigned to NiSO4 and Al2(SO4)3, respectively."

[3] "The XPS results in Figure 3a, where the Ni 2p3/2 spectra can be divided into two characteristic peaks with binding energies of 854.6 and 856.2 eV, which are ascribed to Ni2+ and Ni3+ species, respectively."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes X-ray based techniques like XPS and XAS to probe oxidation state changes of the nickel species during catalyst preparation. For example, XPS is used to show increased Ni3+ species in sulfate-modified catalysts compared to unmodified catalysts. The oxidation state changes are attributed to the electron-withdrawing effect of the sulfate modifier.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,这篇文章利用XPS和XAS等X射线技术来探测催化剂制备过程中镍物种的氧化态变化。例如,XPS被用来显示相比于未修饰的催化剂,硫酸根修饰的催化剂中Ni3+物种的增加。氧化态的变化被归因于硫酸根修饰剂的吸电子效应。
