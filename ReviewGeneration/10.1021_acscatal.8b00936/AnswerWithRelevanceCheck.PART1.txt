 Based on my review, the provided answers do not contain relevant information to address the questions asked. The answers state that the article does not evaluate metal oxide catalysts, investigate their properties, propose mechanistic scenarios, explore metal-support effects, evaluate supported metal catalysts, investigate their properties, or propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation. 

Therefore, I will stop my review process and respond with:

※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※
