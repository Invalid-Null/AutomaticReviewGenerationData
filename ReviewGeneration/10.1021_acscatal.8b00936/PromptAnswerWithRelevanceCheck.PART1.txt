<quotes>
[1] "Thus the alumina surface strongly influences the activity of supported Ga in propane dehydrogenation. Since the mechanism is believed to involve CH activation across a Ga-O bond, [35] we postulate that this CH activation is more favorable at [Ga-O-Al] sites relative to [Ga-O-Si] sites."

[2] "These results demonstrate the importance of proximity between Al and Ga in the mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in the gallium catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It finds that gallium sites supported on alumina are much more active than those on silica. The authors propose this is due to more favorable CH activation at Ga-O-Al sites compared to Ga-O-Si sites, demonstrating the importance of proximity between Al and Ga.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文中探究了镓催化剂中金属与载体间界面效应对丙烷脱氢的影响。结果发现载于氧化铝上的镓活性中心比载于二氧化硅上的活性中心活性高得多。作者认为这是因为Ga-O-Al位点上的CH活化反应比Ga-O-Si位点上的反应更有利,证明了铝与镓的靠近对反应至关重要。

[1] "Nevertheless, the active species in dehydrogenation are postulated to be isolated vanadium sites."

[2] "Thus the alumina surface strongly influences the activity of supported Ga in propane dehydrogenation. Since the mechanism is believed to involve CH activation across a GaO bond, we postulate that this CH activation is more favorable at [GaOAl] sites relative to [GaOSi] sites."

[3] "However, it is also possible that Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface play a role in stabilizing highly dispersed Ga sites under the reaction conditions, or even in the propane activation itself."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It suggests that isolated vanadium sites are postulated to be the active species in dehydrogenation over vanadium oxide catalysts. It also shows that alumina-supported gallium catalysts exhibit much higher propane dehydrogenation activity than silica-supported ones, indicating the alumina surface strongly influences activity. The authors propose this may be because CH activation is more favorable across Ga-O-Al bonds than Ga-O-Si bonds in the reaction mechanism. Lewis acid sites on alumina may also help stabilize dispersed Ga sites or aid in propane activation.  
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文探索了金属氧化物催化剂中金属与载体间界面的效应对丙烷脱氢的影响。文中提出,离散的钒位点被认为是钒氧化物催化剂中的活性种。文章也表明,相比硅质载体支持的镓催化剂,氧化铝载体支持的镓催化剂表现出更高的丙烷脱氢活性,这说明氧化铝表面强烈影响活性。作者推测这可能是因为Ga-O-Al键上的CH活化相比Ga-O-Si键更有利。氧化铝上的刘易斯酸位点也可能帮助稳定分散的Ga位点,或者协助丙烷的活化。
