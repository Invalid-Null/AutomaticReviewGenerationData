[1] The peaks at 2115 and 2174 cm−1 are from gas-phase CO. The absence of 1800 cm−1 band suggests high dispersion of Pt.
[2] Sn 3d XPS spectra show Sn mainly in Sn2+/Sn4+ state on all catalysts. This implies boron-modified ZrO2 stabilizes oxidation state of Sn.
[3] The CO oxidation temperature is lowest over PtSn/B-ZrO2-10. More Pt-Sn interfaces from stronger interaction between Pt and Sn are proposed. 
[4] No relevant quotes
[5] No relevant quotes
[6] XPS results indicate electronic properties of Pt and SnOx are affected by their interaction and interaction with support.
[7] No evaluation of different reactor types.

<English version answer>

1. Answer: No, the article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It focuses on boron-modified zirconia supports.

2. Answer: No, the article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports. It studies PtSn catalysts on boron-modified zirconia.  

3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates methods for optimizing dispersion. It uses co-impregnation of Pt and Sn precursors onto boron-modified zirconia synthesized at different pH.

4. Answer: No, the article does not utilize in-situ techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

5. Answer: No, the article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces.

6. Answer: Yes, the article uses XPS to probe oxidation state changes. It shows interaction between Pt, Sn and support affects metal oxidation states.

7. Answer: No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.
