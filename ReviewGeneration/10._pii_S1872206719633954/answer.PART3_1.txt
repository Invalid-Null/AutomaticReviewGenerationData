[1] "The NH3-TPD and pyridine IR show that only Lewis acid is present and the acid strength increases with the synthesis pH."

[2] "Additionally, the drain effect of Sn that facilitates the migration of coke precursor from Pt surface is proposed to account for the improved stability after introduction of Sn."

[3] "The XPS results indicate that the electronic properties of Pt and SnOx are affected not only by their interaction but also by the interaction with support."

[4] "The results reveal that the interaction between Pt and Sn is influenced by their respective interaction with the support and a moderate interaction between the metal species and the support is desired."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates methods for optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies how the pH during boron modified ZrO2 preparation affects the acidity, which then influences the interaction between the Pt, Sn, and support. The moderate metal-support interaction at pH 10 gave the best PtSn dispersion and stability.
