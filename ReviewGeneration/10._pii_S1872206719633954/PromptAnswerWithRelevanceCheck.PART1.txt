1. It was reported that the interaction between Pt and Sn can also be affected by their respective interaction with support [74, 79].

2. An XAFS study also suggested three kinds of platinum species: PtSn alloy, Pt-O-Sn2+ species, and pure Pt clusters [74]. 

3. No relevant quotes

4. Notably, the role of oxygen storage capacity of various supports in CO oxidation cannot be neglected especially for possible isolated Pt particles on support in this work, as it was previously observed that CO oxidation was linearly correlated with the oxygen storage capacity [67, 68, 69]. However, no linear relation was observed between the oxygen storage capacity and the CO oxidation activity in this work.

Specifically, it suggests the interaction between Pt and Sn can be affected by their interaction with the B-ZrO2 support, with moderate metal-support interaction strengthening the Pt-Sn interaction. 

2. The article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation.

3. The article does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts.

4. The article does not propose mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over any studied supported metal catalysts.

1. The NH3-TPD and pyridine IR show that only Lewis acid is present and the acid strength increases with the synthesis pH. PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 exhibits the best catalytic performance with an initial propane conversion of 36% and a deactivation rate constant (kd) of 0.0127 h1. The XPS results indicate that the electronic properties of Pt and SnOx are affected not only by their interaction but also by the interaction with support. After a careful analysis of the oxygen storage capacity and activity in CO oxidation, it is hypothesized that the interaction between Pt and Sn becomes stronger following the order: PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-10.

2. The characterization with TPO and Raman on spent catalysts exhibits that more hydrogen deficient coke forms on the support and less coke deposits on the metal surface of PtSn/B-ZrO2-10. The results reveal that the interaction between Pt and Sn is influenced by their respective interaction with the support and a moderate interaction between the metal species and the support is desired.

<English version answer>

1. Yes, the article evaluates PtSn/B-ZrO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and deactivation rates for PtSn/B-ZrO2 catalysts synthesized at different pH values. The article shows that tuning the pH affects the acid-base properties, which influences the metal-support and metal-metal interactions and ultimately the catalytic performance. 

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning the pH and hence the acid-base properties of B-ZrO2 affects the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. Lower pH leads to weaker Lewis acid sites. Moderate pH of 10 gave the best PtSn/B-ZrO2 catalyst, with 36% initial propane conversion and lowest deactivation rate of 0.0127 h-1. This is attributed to optimal metal-support and metal-metal interactions at this pH.

3. No, the article does not propose detailed mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the PtSn/B-ZrO2 catalysts studied. It suggests the interactions between Pt and Sn species play an important role but does not describe specific reaction steps or intermediates.

4. Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in the PtSn/B-ZrO2 catalysts. It shows tuning the pH modulates the Lewis acidity of the support, which affects the electronic properties of Pt and Sn species. Moderate metal-support interaction at pH 10 leads to optimal metal-metal interaction and best catalyst performance and stability.

5. No, the article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt or Pd. 

6. Not applicable.

1. 是的,该文评价了用于丙烷脱氢的PtSn/B-ZrO2催化剂。它提供了在不同pH值下合成的PtSn/B-ZrO2催化剂的丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和失活速率的数据。该文表明调节pH值会影响酸碱性质,这又会影响金属-支撑物和金属-金属间的相互作用,并最终影响催化性能。

2. 是的,该文研究了调节pH值以及B-ZrO2的酸碱性质如何影响丙烷脱氢反应中的催化性能。较低的pH值会导致较弱的路易斯酸性位点。适中的pH值为10时制得最佳的PtSn/B-ZrO2催化剂,初期丙烷转化率为36%,失活速率最低为0.0127 h-1。这归因于在该pH条件下获得了最佳的金属-支撑物和金属-金属间相互作用。

3. 否,该文没有提出PtSn/B-ZrO2催化剂上丙烷脱氢的详细机理途径。它指出Pt和Sn物种之间的相互作用发挥重要作用,但没有描述具体的反应步骤或中间体。

4. 是的,该文探讨了PtSn/B-ZrO2催化剂中的金属-支撑物界面效应。它表明调节pH值会调节支撑物的路易斯酸度,这会影响Pt和Sn物种的电子性质。适中的金属-支撑物相互作用在pH 10时导致最佳的金属-金属相互作用和最佳的催化剂性能与稳定性。

5. 否,该文没有评价任何支撑单金属催化剂,如Pt或Pd。

[1] "However, no linear relation was observed between the oxygen storage capacity and the CO oxidation activity in this work."

[2] "Therefore, more interfaces between Pt and Sn oxides resulting from their intimate contact are hypothesized, which may play an important role in CO oxidation and increase in the order PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-10."

[3] "It has been reported that Lewis acid sites played a decisive role in providing anchoring sites for Pd or Pt and electron deficient Pd or Pt would be obtained due to the interaction between Pd or Pt and Lewis acid sites [26, 28, 75]."

[4] "The Py-IR result shows that only Lewis acid is present, and the NH3-TPD result shows that the acidity strength increases linearly with support synthesis pH."

[5] "Accordingly, it can be induced that moderate interaction between the metal species and the support would intensify the interaction between Pt and Sn, which obviously benefit propane dehydrogenation."

Answer: The article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It finds no linear relationship between oxygen storage capacity and CO oxidation activity over PtSn/B-ZrO2 catalysts, and hypothesizes the interaction between Pt and Sn increases with synthesis pH as: PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-10. It shows only Lewis acid sites are present, whose strength increases with pH. Moderate metal-support interaction is proposed to intensify Pt-Sn interaction and benefit propane dehydrogenation.

Answer: The article explores metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It hypothesizes more Pt-Sn oxide interfaces resulting from intimate contact play an important role in CO oxidation and increase with synthesis pH. Moderate metal-support interaction is proposed to intensify Pt-Sn interaction and benefit propane dehydrogenation. Less coke deposition on metal for PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 is attributed to its better stability over PtSn/B-ZrO2-11.

<Chinese version answer>  
答:文章探究了金属氧化物催化剂中金属-支撑物界面效应对丙烷脱氢的影响。它假设由于亲密接触产生的更多Pt-Sn氧化物界面在CO氧化中起重要作用,并随合成pH增加而增加。适度的金属-支撑物相互作用被认为可以增强Pt-Sn相互作用并有利于丙烷脱氢。PtSn/B-ZrO2-10比PtSn/B-ZrO2-11金属上焦炭沉积更少,这被归因于其更好的稳定性。
