1. It was reported that the interaction between Pt and Sn can also be affected by their respective interaction with support [74, 79].

2. An XAFS study also suggested three kinds of platinum species: PtSn alloy, Pt-O-Sn2+ species, and pure Pt clusters [74].

4. Notably, the role of oxygen storage capacity of various supports in CO oxidation cannot be neglected especially for possible isolated Pt particles on support in this work, as it was previously observed that CO oxidation was linearly correlated with the oxygen storage capacity [67, 68, 69]. However, no linear relation was observed between the oxygen storage capacity and the CO oxidation activity in this work.

1. The article does explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Specifically, it suggests the interaction between Pt and Sn can be affected by their interaction with the B-ZrO2 support, with moderate metal-support interaction strengthening the Pt-Sn interaction. 

2. The article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation.

3. The article does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts.

4. The article does not propose mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over any studied supported metal catalysts.

1. 该文章确实探讨了金属氧化物催化剂中金属与支持物界面的效应。具体来说,它提出Pt和Sn之间的相互作用会受到它们与B-ZrO2支持物的相互作用的影响,适度的金属-支持物相互作用会增强Pt-Sn之间的相互作用。

2. 该文章没有评估任何Pt、Pd或Ir等单金属负载催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。 

3. 该文章没有研究诸如金属颗粒大小、形状以及与支撑体相互作用等性质如何影响负载金属催化剂的性能。

4. 该文章没有提出任何所研究的负载金属催化剂上的丙烷脱氢反应的机理反应途径。
