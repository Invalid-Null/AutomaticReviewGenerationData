[1] Accordingly, it can be induced that moderate interaction between the metal species and the support would intensify the interaction between Pt and Sn, which obviously benefit propane dehydrogenation.

[2] The general scheme of coke formation on PtSn-based catalysts in PDH can be summarized as follows: first, coke precursor with a high hydrogen to carbon ratio is likely generated on Pt metal during reaction; then the precursor migrates to the support and undergoes oligomerization, cyclization, and condensation into more graphitized carbonaceous deposits with a low H/C [60, 84, 85].

[3] Notably, the role of oxygen storage capacity of various supports in CO oxidation cannot be neglected especially for possible isolated Pt particles on support in this work, as it was previously observed that CO oxidation was linearly correlated with the oxygen storage capacity [67, 68, 69].

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates PtSn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing PtSn/B-ZrO2 catalysts exhibit good initial activity and stability compared to PtSn/Al2O3. The article also provides insights into how the interaction between Pt and Sn, affected by the support, influences coking behavior and stability. Coke precursors form on Pt sites and migrate to the support. Moderate metal-support interaction enhances Pt-Sn interaction, improving catalyst lifetime.

Answer: 是的,该文评估了PtSn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供了数据,显示PtSn/B-ZrO2催化剂表现出良好的初始活性和稳定性,与PtSn/Al2O3相比。该文还提供了Pt和Sn之间的相互作用(受支持体影响)如何影响焦炭行为和稳定性的见解。焦炭前体在Pt位点上形成并迁移到支持体上。适度的金属-支持体相互作用增强了Pt-Sn相互作用,改善了催化剂的使用寿命。
