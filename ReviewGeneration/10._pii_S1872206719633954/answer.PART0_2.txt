<quotes>
[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been under wide investigation and currently available catalysts include PtSn and Cr supported on Al2O3 [6]."

[2] "The NH3-TPD and pyridine IR show that only Lewis acid is present and the acid strength increases with the synthesis pH."

[3] "Boron-modified ZrO2 (B-ZrO2) was synthesized under various pH values (9, 10, and 11) and used as the supports of PtSn catalysts (PtSn/B-ZrO2-x) for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[4] "The XPS results indicate that the electronic properties of Pt and SnOx are affected not only by their interaction but also by the interaction with support."
