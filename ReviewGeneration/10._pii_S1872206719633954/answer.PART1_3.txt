[1] "However, no linear relation was observed between the oxygen storage capacity and the CO oxidation activity in this work."

[2] "Therefore, more interfaces between Pt and Sn oxides resulting from their intimate contact are hypothesized, which may play an important role in CO oxidation and increase in the order PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-10."

[3] "It has been reported that Lewis acid sites played a decisive role in providing anchoring sites for Pd or Pt and electron deficient Pd or Pt would be obtained due to the interaction between Pd or Pt and Lewis acid sites [26, 28, 75]."

[4] "The Py-IR result shows that only Lewis acid is present, and the NH3-TPD result shows that the acidity strength increases linearly with support synthesis pH."

[5] "Accordingly, it can be induced that moderate interaction between the metal species and the support would intensify the interaction between Pt and Sn, which obviously benefit propane dehydrogenation."

<English version answer>  
Answer: The article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It finds no linear relationship between oxygen storage capacity and CO oxidation activity over PtSn/B-ZrO2 catalysts, and hypothesizes the interaction between Pt and Sn increases with synthesis pH as: PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-10. It shows only Lewis acid sites are present, whose strength increases with pH. Moderate metal-support interaction is proposed to intensify Pt-Sn interaction and benefit propane dehydrogenation.

答:文章探究了调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧的迁移性和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它发现PtSn/B-ZrO2催化剂的氧储量与CO氧化活性之间没有线性关系,并假设随着合成pH的增加,Pt和Sn之间的相互作用按以下顺序增加:PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-10。它显示只有Lewis酸位存在,其强度随pH增加而增加。适度的金属-支撑物相互作用被提出可以增强Pt-Sn相互作用并有利于丙烷脱氢。

[3] "The better stability obtained on PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 than PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 might be attributed to less coke deposited on metal."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article explores metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It hypothesizes more Pt-Sn oxide interfaces resulting from intimate contact play an important role in CO oxidation and increase with synthesis pH. Moderate metal-support interaction is proposed to intensify Pt-Sn interaction and benefit propane dehydrogenation. Less coke deposition on metal for PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 is attributed to its better stability over PtSn/B-ZrO2-11.

答:文章探究了金属氧化物催化剂中金属-支撑物界面效应对丙烷脱氢的影响。它假设由于亲密接触产生的更多Pt-Sn氧化物界面在CO氧化中起重要作用,并随合成pH增加而增加。适度的金属-支撑物相互作用被认为可以增强Pt-Sn相互作用并有利于丙烷脱氢。PtSn/B-ZrO2-10比PtSn/B-ZrO2-11金属上焦炭沉积更少,这被归因于其更好的稳定性。
