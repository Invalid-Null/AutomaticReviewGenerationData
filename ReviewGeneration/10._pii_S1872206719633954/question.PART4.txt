Effect of pH on the catalytic performance of PtSn/B-ZrO2 in propane dehydrogenation
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872206719633954
AbstractAbstract
Boron-modified ZrO2 (B-ZrO2) was synthesized under various pH values (9, 10, and 11) and used as the supports of PtSn catalysts (PtSn/B-ZrO2-x) for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The NH3-TPD and pyridine IR show that only Lewis acid is present and the acid strength increases with the synthesis pH. PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 exhibits the best catalytic performance with an initial propane conversion of 36% and a deactivation rate constant (kd) of 0.0127 h1. The XPS results indicate that the electronic properties of Pt and SnOx are affected not only by their interaction but also by the interaction with support. After a careful analysis of the oxygen storage capacity and activity in CO oxidation, it is hypothesized that the interaction between Pt and Sn becomes stronger following the order: PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-10. The characterization with TPO and Raman on spent catalysts exhibits that more hydrogen deficient coke forms on the support and less coke deposits on the metal surface of PtSn/B-ZrO2-10. The results reveal that the interaction between Pt and Sn is influenced by their respective interaction with the support and a moderate interaction between the metal species and the support is desired.
Graphical Abstract
The better stability of the catalyst PtSn/B-ZrO2 in propane dehydrogenation is likely attributed to a moderate interaction between metal species and the support and hence a strong interaction between Pt and Sn species.

1. Introduction
As one of the important basic chemicals, propylene is traditionally co-produced with ethylene from petroleum-based processes such as steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking [1, 2]. With the depleting crude oil and the discovery of large reserves of shale gas, steaming cracking of ethane with high selectivity to ethylene and negligible co-production of propylene becomes more competitive and is replacing the traditional petroleum-based processes [3]. Thus, a more economical alternative such as direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is desired to meet the increasing demand of propylene [4, 5].
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been under wide investigation and currently available catalysts include PtSn and Cr supported on Al2O3 [6]. Among them, PtSn-based catalyst is more environmentally benign and thus more widely used [3, 7]. However, the catalyst still suffers from problems such as deactivation mainly due to carbon deposits and metal sintering, and thus frequent coke combustion in air as well as re-dispersion in Cl2 atmosphere is required in practical process [8, 9, 10]. Protocols including improving the metal-support interaction, enhancing the interaction between Pt and Sn, and altering the acidic property of supports have been carried out in order to enhance the catalyst stability in PDH [11, 12, 13, 14]. For example, Zhu et al. [15] reported that Sn can be selectively deposited on Pt nanoparticle surface via surface organometallic chemistry and as-obtained catalysts exhibited a remarkable activity and stability in PDH. In addition, an improved stability was achieved by adding Mg or Zn to Al2O3 to eliminate acidic sites and strengthen the metal-support interaction [4, 16]. It should be noted that not all kinds of acid sites are detrimental in PDH. A number of studies have shown that Lewis acid sites may facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction while Brnsted acid sites favor side reactions such as cracking and oligomerization [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. This is further validated by a recent report that gallosilicate MFI zeolite with a higher concentration of strong Lewis acid sites and reduced concentration of Brnsted acid sites showed a better PDH activity and propylene selectivity [23]. Furthermore, these Lewis acid sites originating from the defect sites or coordinatively unsaturated sites can also provide anchoring sites for supported metal particles [24, 25, 26].
Notably, some oxides that can be treated to form defects are proven to be active in light alkane dehydrogenation. Rodemerck et al. [27] reported that even Al2O3 after reduction at 600 C for 10 h or calcined in air at 550 C exhibited activity for butane dehydrogenation, and the dehydrogenation activity was linearly correlated with coordinatively unsaturated Al sites (Lewis acidic sites) due to desorption of strongly bound surface OH groups in the form of water. Although that study did not identify the coordination number of such coordinatively unsaturated Al, a study by Kwak et al. [28] showed that coordinatively unsaturated Al sites produced by dehydration and dehydroxylation at high temperatures were penta coordinated, which also acted as the anchoring sites to stabilize Pt atoms. A following study by Shi et al. [29] exhibited that superior stability could be obtained by impregnating PtSn on alumina oxides rich in penta coordinated alumina. In addition, Otroshchenko et al. [30] reported that La or Y doped ZrO2 with tiny amounts of Cu or Ru could facilitate the reduction of ZrO2 and exhibited a competitive activity as the Cr2O3-based catalyst in PDH. The active sites were proposed to be the coordinatively unsaturated Zr cation and the adjacent oxygen [31]. Recently, Otroshchenko et al. [32] reported that the synergy effects between CrOx and coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ sites favored catalysts containing much lower chromium content with superior performance in comparison to commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3. It is also highly desirable to reduce the usage of Pt without degrading the catalytic performance. The latest generation of catalyst DeH-16 developed for UOP Oleflex process contains only 0.3 wt% Pt, 30% lower relative to previous generation catalysts. However, the catalyst stability was apt to deteriorate with decreasing Pt content [6, 33].
Although extensive work on the ZrO2 based catalyst for PDH has been conducted by BASF [34], the stability of ZrO2 supported PtSn catalyst in dehydrogenation reaction is still poor [35, 36]. Previous studies showed that the amount and strength of Lewis acid sites was enhanced while Brnsted acid sites was greatly suppressed by adding electron-deficient boron to ZrO2 through the inductive effect [37, 38]. In analogous with the case of Al2O3, we can propose that ZrO2 with a suitable amount of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites would be an eligible candidate support for PtSn in PDH. Moreover, ZrO2 is widely used as a support in reactions due to its high mechanical and thermal stability [39]. The synthesis pH value of support was reported to influence the catalytic performance in PDH [14]. However, there is still no study on the influence of synthesis pH value of boron modified ZrO2 (B-ZrO2) on the catalytic performance in PDH.
Herein, we showed that the synthesis pH value of B-ZrO2 has a significant effect on the catalytic performance of PtSn/B-ZrO2 in PDH with Pt loading around 0.35 wt%. Characterizations were carried out to investigate the correlations between the structure and catalytic performance of PtSn/B-ZrO2 catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
All chemicals are of analytical grade and purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. The previously reported method was adapted for preparation of boron modified ZrO2 [37]. Briefly, the pH of aqueous solution of ZrOCl2·8H2O (0.5 mol/L) and H3BO3 was adjusted to the desired value by dropwise addition of ammonia solution (2528 wt%) under vigorous stirring. The pH value was monitored with a PHS-3C pH meter (Rex Instrument Factory, Shanghai, China). Then the mixture was refluxed at 100 C for 26 h. The collection and subsequent treatment of precipitate were conducted according to the previous report [37] except that the products were calcined in flowing air at 800 C for 5 h at a heating rate of 10 C/min. The samples were denoted as B-ZrO2-x with the x representing the pH value.
PtSn/B-ZrO2-x samples were prepared by the incipient-wetness co-impregnation method with H6PtCl6·6H2O and SnCl2·2H2O as precursors. A 3 mL ethanol solution of H6PtCl6·6H2O and SnCl2·2H2O was impregnated onto 2 g B-ZrO2-x. Subsequently, the PtSn/B-ZrO2-x was kept at 40 C for 1 h and dried at 110 C for 12 h. Finally, the samples were calcined at 500 C for 4 h in flowing air at a flow rate of 40 mL/min. The loadings of platinum and tin were measured to be around 0.35 wt% and 0.8 wt%, respectively, by ICP-OES.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on an Empyrean diffractometer (PANalytical) using a Cu Kα radiation source with a scan rate of 10/min in the 2θ range of 570. The volume fraction of monoclinic ZrO2 was estimated according to the reported equations [40]:

(2)
where Im(111) and Im(11) are the peak intensities of the (111) and (11) planes of monoclinic ZrO2, respectively, and the It(011) is the peak intensity of the (011) plane of the tetragonal ZrO2.
The total oxygen vacancy or oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of various samples was measured using a thermogravimetric instrument (STA 449 F3, Netzsch, Germany) by the method adapted from the previous report [41]. The sample was first heated up to 800 C in N2 to release oxygen, then cooled to 40 C in air, and again heated to 800 C in N2. The weight loss during the second run was employed to represent the OSC expressed in μmol O2/g catalyst.
The concentration of B, Pt, and Sn was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on a PerkinElmer apparatus Optima 7300 DV.
Nitrogen physisorption was performed with a Quantachrome QUADRASORB SI system at 196 C. All samples were outgassed at 300 C for 6 h before measurement. The specific surface area was calculated with the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation using the adsorption data (P/P0 = 0.050.3). The total pore volume was calculated at the largest point of relative pressure P/P0. The average pore size was calculated by the BJH method from the nitrogen adsorption data.
NH3-TPD was performed on a Micromeritics Auto Chem 2910. The PtSn/B-ZrO2-x catalyst samples were pre-reduced at 500 C for 1 h in 10 vol% H2/Ar before NH3 adsorption at 100 C.
Pyridine adsorption FTIR infrared (Py-IR) spectroscopy was carried out on a Bruker Optics XF808-04 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) with pyridine as a probe molecule. The self-supported sample wafer was kept at 400 C in vacuum for 1 h before absorption of pyridine at room temperature. The signal was collected at room temperature after evacuation at 150 C for 30 min in vacuum.
CO-IR was carried out on a Bruker TENSOR 27 spectrometer. The self-supported sample wafer was in situ reduced at 500 C for 1 h in 100% H2. The spectroscopy of hydroxyl groups on reduced samples was obtained at room temperature after purge in N2 for 30 min. The FTIR spectra of CO on reduced products were collected after saturation adsorption of CO and subsequent evacuation in N2 for 30 min, respectively.
XPS was performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi with Al Kα as X-ray source. The binding energy was calibrated using C 1s at 284.6 eV. For characterization of reduced samples, the sample was in situ reduced at 500 C for 1 h in 100% H2 atmosphere.
The amount of coke was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TG) on a thermogravimetric instrument (STA 449 F3, Netzsch, Germany). Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was carried out on a home-made apparatus equipped with an on-line mass spectrometer (MS) to monitor the CO2 formation. Raman spectroscopy was collected on a NanoWizard Ultra Speed &inVia Raman.
2.3. Catalytic reaction
2.3.1. CO oxidation test
Before the catalytic activity test, the catalysts (20 mg) were pre-reduced at 500 C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature in Ar gas (30 mL/min), a gas mixture of 1% CO, 20% O2, and 1% N2 balanced with He was fed at a flow rate of 10 mL/min. The catalytic performance was investigated by temperature-programmed mode at a rate of 1 C/min. The effluents were analyzed with an online micro-gas chromatograph (Agilent GC-490) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with a 5Å molecular sieve column.
2.3.2. PDH test
The reaction was carried out at 550 C under atmospheric pressure in a quartz microreactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm. 200 mg catalyst was loaded and heated to 500 C in Air (30 mL/min) within 48 min, kept at 500 C in Air (30 mL/min) for 15 min, flushed with Ar (50 mL/min) for 10 min and then reduced at 500 C for 1 h in 100% H2 (30 mL/min) prior to reaction. The feed gas contained 10% propane, 10% H2, and 80% N2. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was 3 h1. The product was analyzed with an online gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 7890A) equipped with an FID detector with an HP-AL/S column. The conversion of propane and the product selectivity were calculated following Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively.

3.1. Results
The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of all samples shown in Fig. 1 are characteristic type IV with H3 hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of nonuniform mesopores formed by aggregates of particles. As presented in Table 1, the specific surface area (SBET), pore volume (Vpore), and the average diameter size (dpore) are the lowest for B-ZrO2-11.

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the bare supports synthesized at different pH values and the corresponding PtSn/B-ZrO2-x samples. Besides the peaks attributed to tetragonal ZrO2 (t-ZrO2), peaks at 2θ = 28o and 31o assigned to monoclinic ZrO2 (m-ZrO2) are also observed, which is different from the previous report [37]. This may be due to the digestion time shorter than 48 h or prolonged exposure to water or vapor, which promotes the phase transformation during cooling and purification [42, 43]. The volume fraction of m-ZrO2 formed at different pH was calculated and summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the content of m-ZrO2 decreases with pH value. The absence of Pt and Sn diffraction peaks indicates their high dispersion or their sizes below the XRD detection limitation. Compared with pure B-ZrO2, it is clear that the impregnation of PtSn and subsequent calcination lead to reduced fraction of m-ZrO2 and increased fraction of t-ZrO2 for all samples (Table S1), suggesting the occurrence of phase transformation from m-ZrO2 to t-ZrO2. It has been reported that the presence of oxygen vacancy was vital for the thermal stability of t-ZrO2 [44]. The inverse phase transformation taking place after impregnating PtSn and subsequent calcination may be triggered by the creation of oxygen vacancy due to the metal-support interaction [45, 46]. The existence and changes of oxygen vacancies or defects before and after impregnating PtSn on B-ZrO2 was further corroborated via the thermogravimetric analysis [47]. The oxygen storage capacity (OSC) is 394.1, 407.7, and 376.8 μmol O2/g catalyst for PtSn/B-ZrO2-9, PtSn/B-ZrO2-10, and PtSn/B-ZrO2-11, respectively, which are obviously higher than those of bare B-ZrO2-x (Table 1 and Table S1). A previous study reported that more anionic defects were generally found on m-ZrO2 than t-ZrO2 [48]. However, this is not observed in the present study, indicating that the phase of ZrO2 may not be the dominant factor affecting the vacancy concentration.

Fig. 2. XRD patterns of various samples.
The acidity of B-ZrO2 and corresponding supported PtSn samples was investigated by NH3-TPD. As shown in Fig. 3, the desorption temperature increases from 174 to 218 C, indicating that stronger acid sites are generated under a higher pH value. The apparent NH3 surface density (number of NH3 molecules adsorbed per nm2) of B-ZrO2-9 and B-ZrO2-10 is close while lower than that of B-ZrO2-11 (Table 1). However, upon impregnation with PtSn, the desorption temperature decreases for PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 and PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 while increases for PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 compared with the corresponding supports. Additionally, the apparent NH3 surface density of PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 and PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 increases and that of PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 reduces compared with the corresponding support (Table S1).

The nature of acid sites is further studied by IR using pyridine as a probe molecule (Py-IR). As shown in Fig. 4, the typical absorbance band at 1540 cm1 ascribed to Brnsted acid is absent on all samples, which is in line with previous results [37]. The band at 1610 cm1 should be attributed to pyridine adsorbed on the medium strength Lewis acid sites namely coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ cations [49, 50], while the 1630 cm1 band to the stronger Lewis acid sites [50]. The band at 1580 cm1 can be assigned to physically adsorbed pyridine, and the 1460 cm1 to the coordinatively bonded pyridine [37]. The areas of 1610 and 1630 cm1 were integrated to show the differences in number of medium strength and strong Lewis acid sites on various supports, respectively. It can be seen from Table 2 that the number of strong and medium strength Lewis acid sites follows the order B-ZrO2-9  B-ZrO2-10 < B-ZrO2-11. It should be noted that the number of strong Lewis acid sites on B-ZrO2-9 and B-ZrO2-10 is similar, contradicting the acidity strength determined by NH3-TPD. This might be attributed to the weak acidity and similar amount of acid sites on B-ZrO2-9 and B-ZrO2-10, as well as the semi-quantitative quality of Py-IR.

CO-IR was carried out to get further insight into the property of reduced PtSn/B-ZrO2. Fig. 5a shows that the band centered around 2174 cm1 and the one centered around 2115 cm 1 are observed for all samples, which can be attributed to gas-phase CO. The possible bands due to CO on Pt or PtO should be overlapped by the broad band centered at 2115 cm1 [51]. Notably, it can be seen that typical bands ascribed to surface hydroxyl groups or adsorbed water are absent in IR spectra of reduced samples (Fig. S2), which is a good indicator of the dehydroxylation or dehydration during reduction [52]. Then it would be understandable that the common bands in the range of 12001800 cm1 ascribed to CO interacting with basic or acidic OH groups are not observed [53]. Moreover, the weak peak at 1691 cm1 is therefore more likely assigned to CO adsorbed at the Pt-ZrO2 interface other than ionic bicarbonate species (i-HCO3) [54, 55].

Fig. 5. CO-IR spectra of reduced PtSn/B-ZrO2-x after saturated adsorption of CO (a) and after evacuation for 30 min (b).
IR spectra of CO adsorption on reduced samples after evacuation for 30 min are shown in Fig. 5b. The main bands at 2174 and 2115 cm1 disappear after evacuation at room temperature. The band in the range of 2076  2081 cm1 is ascribed to CO linearly adsorbed on highly coordinated Pt and the blue shift with increasing pH value is discernible [56]. The absence of 1800 cm1 band (characteristic CO bridge adsorbed on Pt particles) suggests a high dispersion of Pt [56].
The XPS spectra of the Pt 4f and Sn 3d for reduced catalysts are presented in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. The fitting spectra and semi-quantitative results are summarized in Table 3. As shown in Fig. 6, the Pt 4f XPS spectra can be deconvoluted into two doublets with the Pt 4f7/2 binding energies (BEs) of ca. 71.5071.67 eV and 72.4672.68 eV attributed to Pt0 and Pt2+, respectively [57, 58]. It can be seen from Table 3 that the percentage of Pt2+ for PtSn/B-ZrO2-9, PtSn/B-ZrO2-10, and PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 are 8.3%, 8.3%, and 15.1%, respectively, indicating the stronger interaction between Pt species and B-ZrO2-11, which may hinder the reduction of Pt oxides [51]. The binding energy of Pt0 4f7/2 as shown in Table 3 follows the order PtSn/B-ZrO2-9  PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-11, suggesting that most electron deficient Pt species formed on PtSn/B-ZrO2-11.

Fig. 7 shows the Sn 3d spectra of PtSn/B-ZrO2-x catalysts. The fitting spectra and semi-quantitative results are compiled in Table 3. There are two doublets with the Sn 3d5/2 BEs of ca. 484.78484.89 eV and 486.77486.96 eV attributed to Sn0 and Sn2+/Sn4+, respectively [59]. However, it is difficult to differentiate the Sn2+and Sn4+ because of the close binding energy between them [59]. As presented in Table 3, the percentages of Sn2+/Sn4+ are 91.9%, 94.7%, and 94.8% for PtSn/B-ZrO2-9, PtSn/B-ZrO2-10, and PtSn/B-ZrO2-11, respectively. This indicates that ZrO2 doped by even a small amount of boron in this study stabilizes the oxidation state of Sn and this differs from previous research that the interaction between pure ZrO2 and Sn is weak resulting in more Sn0 [35, 36].
The results of CO oxidation on different pre-reduced PtSn/B-ZrO2-x under atmospheric pressure as a function of temperature are shown in Table 4. The temperature for half conversion of CO (T50%) on PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 is the lowest at 160 C while it is similar on PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 and PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 (170 and 168 C, respectively, Table 4). The temperature for full CO conversion (T100%) follows the order PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 (Table 4).

Fig. 8 presents catalytic performance for PDH on PtSn/B-ZrO2-x as a function of reaction time. The initial propane conversion is 31.5% for PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 and 36.0% for PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 whereas it is 34.8% for PtSn/B-ZrO2-11. The propylene selectivity is the highest on PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 and the lowest on PtSn/B-ZrO2-10. The most stable catalyst is obtained on PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 with the deactivation rate constant (kd) of 0.0127 h1. In comparison, PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 exhibits a kd of 0.0997 h1 and PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 of 0.0272 h1. Moreover, compared to the industrially relevant reference catalyst using Al2O3 as the support, it can be seen that the conversion on PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 is close to that over 0.5 wt% PtSn/Al2O3 and the stability of PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 is better than that of 0.35 wt% PtSn/Al2O3 (Fig. S3).

It is notable that the specific activity of C3H6 formation of PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 (mol C3H6 formed)/(mol Pt*t(s)) is 0.374 s1, suggesting a larger specific activity of C3H6 formation but a lower deactivation rate constant (kd) of PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 than most of those catalysts listed in references [7] and [29]. Compared to recent studies on Pt-based catalysts with a similar loading around 0.35 wt%, PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 exhibits an excellent stability in PDH (Table S2).
The amount of coke formed on spent catalysts was evaluated by TG. The amount of coke on PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 is 0.06%, larger than that (0.04%) on PtSn/B-ZrO2-11. No weight loss is detected on spent PtSn/B-ZrO2-10. It should be noted that this does not mean no coke formation on PtSn/B-ZrO2-10. As more oxygen vacancy sites on PtSn/B-ZrO2-10, the weight augment by the oxygen replenishment may outnumber the limited weight loss due to coke combustion in oxidizing environment.
TPO was carried out and the evolution of CO2 was recorded by MS to gain insights into the location of coke depositions [60]. As shown in Fig. 9, a more obvious shoulder around 285 C is observed on PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 and PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 compared to PtSn/B-ZrO2-10. Additionally, the main peak shifts from 324 C for PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 to 338 C for PtSn/B-ZrO2-10. A broad band with its maximum above 400 C is identified for PtSn/B-ZrO2-11. The intensity of band above 400 C is stronger for both PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 and PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 than PtSn/B-ZrO2-9.

The peak centered around 13561329 cm1 can be attributed to the breathing mode of sp2 in rings, generally known as disordered graphite (D band) [61, 62]. The considerable band shift indicates the chemical changes of formed coke. The peak at 1528 cm1 with a shoulder around 1552 cm1 should be ascribed to conjugated olefinic species or polyenes, which were possibly aromatics precursors [62, 63]. Bands at 1587 cm1 may be due to graphite or large polycyclic aromatics (G band) [64]. The band shifted to 1603 cm1 for both PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 and PtSn/B-ZrO2-11, which can be due to ring stretches of C=C chains or aromatics rings [61]. The ID/IG ratio of PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 is higher than that of PtSn/B-ZrO2-10, indicating that coke deposited on PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 more hydrogen deficient.

3.2. Discussion
3.2.1. Possible factors affecting CO oxidation activity
Both the theoretical calculation and experimental findings support that even PtSn alloy formed by pre-reduction underwent isolation into domains of Pt and Sn oxides and the CO oxidation took place right on the interface between Pt and Sn oxides [65, 66]. This is plausible considering enhanced CO oxidation activity when more Sn was selectively deposited on Pt surface [15]. Notably, the role of oxygen storage capacity of various supports in CO oxidation cannot be neglected especially for possible isolated Pt particles on support in this work, as it was previously observed that CO oxidation was linearly correlated with the oxygen storage capacity [67, 68, 69]. However, no linear relation was observed between the oxygen storage capacity and the CO oxidation activity in this work. Therefore, more interfaces between Pt and Sn oxides resulting from their intimate contact are hypothesized, which may play an important role in CO oxidation and increase in the order PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-10.
3.2.2. The possible support effect on interaction between Pt and Sn
The XPS results showed that the binding energy of Pt0 follows the order PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 (BE: 71.50)  PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 (BE: 71.52) < PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 (BE: 71.67) (Table 2), indicating the most electron deficient Pt on PtSn/B-ZrO2-11. The positive effect of Sn on Pt in dehydrogenation was generally attributed to the electronic and ensemble effects [4]. Despite of no consensus on whether electron rich or deficient Pt is responsible for the high selectivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation, it should be noted that an opposite binding energy changing tendency can be expected if the electronic effect exist between Pt and Sn0 or Sn2+/Sn4+ [64, 70, 71, 72]. However, the shift of Sn0 or Sn2+/Sn4+ binding energy on various catalysts follows the order PtSn-B-ZrO2-11 > PtSn-B-ZrO2-9  PtSn-B-ZrO2-10, suggesting the lowest electron density of Sn0 or Sn2+/Sn4+ on PtSn-B-ZrO2-11. In light of the binding energy variation of Pt and Sn determined from XPS, the influence of support on the electronic property of Pt and Sn cannot be neglected. Although the existence of Pt0 and Sn0 can be confirmed by the XPS results in this work, the previous XAFS result showed that not all reduced Sn0 would form alloy with Pt [73]. An XAFS study also suggested three kinds of platinum species: PtSn alloy, Pt-O-Sn2+ species, and pure Pt clusters [74]. The Py-IR result shows that only Lewis acid is present, and the NH3-TPD result shows that the acidity strength increases linearly with support synthesis pH. It was reported that Lewis acid sites played a decisive role in providing anchoring sites for Pd or Pt and electron deficient Pd or Pt would be obtained due to the interaction between Pd or Pt and Lewis acid sites [26, 28, 75]. Thus, we can anticipate that Pt or Sn species, especially those separate species directly bound to support, might be electron deficient because of the binding effect of Lewis acid sites, and stronger Lewis acid would lead to more electron deficient Pt0 or Sn species, which would show higher binding energy in XPS results [75].
Some studies reported that the structure of PtSn may influence the catalyst stability but it is still not clear yet which kind of PtSn alloy is the best for PDH [64, 76, 77, 78, 79]. Additionally, the formation of PtSn alloy requires the reduction of SnOx to Sn0 [15]. However, the reduced Sn0 was not even detected while good activity and stability were still obtained in some reports [29, 80]. In this study, the oxidation state of Sn is mainly Sn2+/Sn4+ as shown in XPS results, in contrary to easier reduction of Sn on ZrO2 in previous reports [35, 36]. This indicates the stronger binding of Sn on boron modified ZrO2. The better stability obtained on PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 with less portion of Sn0 is in accordance with previous research that an improved stability was obtained on supports which stabilized the oxidized SnOx [13, 35, 36, 81, 82]. Furthermore, it implies that the reduction of SnOx to form PtSn alloy may not be the prerequisite to improve catalytic performance while the interaction between Pt and Sn may play a more important role in catalyst stability [13, 15, 83]. It has been pointed out that the interaction between Pt and Sn can also be affected by their respective interaction with support [74, 79]. Considering the stronger Lewis acid sites, the less fraction of Pt0 and most electron deficient Sn species, stronger interaction between the metal species and the support can be expected on PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 compared to PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 and PtSn/B-ZrO2-10. However, as CO oxidation result shows, the interaction between Pt and Sn on PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 may be inferior to that on PtSn/B-ZrO2-10. Accordingly, it can be induced that moderate interaction between the metal species and the support would intensify the interaction between Pt and Sn, which obviously benefit propane dehydrogenation.
3.2.3. Coking behavior
The general scheme of coke formation on PtSn-based catalysts in PDH can be summarized as follows: first, coke precursor with a high hydrogen to carbon ratio is likely generated on Pt metal during reaction; then the precursor migrates to the support and undergoes oligomerization, cyclization, and condensation into more graphitized carbonaceous deposits with a low H/C [60, 84, 85]. The coke with higher H/C located on metal or in the vicinity of metal was reported to show a lower oxidation temperature in the range of 250300 C, while the coke located on support was oxidized at a higher temperature [85]. It can be seen from the Raman result that coke deposited on PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 is more hydrogen deficient than that on PtSn/B-ZrO2-11. However, the main oxidation temperature of coke on PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 is lower than that on PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 (Fig. 9). This may be due to the higher OSC on PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 compared to PtSn/B-ZrO2-11, as higher oxygen storage capacity would facilitate the oxygen mobility and thus lower oxidation temperature of carbonaceous species on support [56, 86, 87]. The more intense signal in the range of 250300 C on PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 and PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 than that of PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 implies that more coke is deposited on metal for PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 and PtSn/B-ZrO2-11. The better stability obtained on PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 than PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 might be attributed to less coke deposited on metal.
Additionally, the drain effect of Sn that facilitates the migration of coke precursor from Pt surface is proposed to account for the improved stability after introduction of Sn [10]. Thus, it can be anticipated that more intimate interaction between Pt and Sn exist on PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 which leads to more dehydrogenated coke migrating to the support and needing a higher combustion temperature, in line with the TPO results.
4. Conclusions
The pH value during preparation of B-ZrO2-x (x = 9, 10, 11) supports affected the catalytic performance of PtSn/B-ZrO2-x catalysts in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The amount and strength of Lewis acid sites on B-ZrO2 were found to increase with the synthesis pH value of B-ZrO2. Because no linear relationship between OSC and CO oxidation activity was observed, it is hypothesized that the interaction between Pt and Sn plays a dominant role and increases in the order PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-11 < PtSn/B-ZrO2-10. A moderate interaction between the metal species and B-ZrO2-10 strengthens the interaction between Pt and Sn, and hence facilitates the migration of coke precursor from the active sites to the support, resulting in a better stability in PDH.
