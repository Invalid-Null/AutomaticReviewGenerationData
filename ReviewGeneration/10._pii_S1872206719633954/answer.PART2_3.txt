<quotes>
[1] Herein, we showed that the synthesis pH value of B-ZrO2 has a significant effect on the catalytic performance of PtSn/B-ZrO2 in PDH with Pt loading around 0.35 wt%.

[2] PtSn-based catalyst is more environmentally benign and thus more widely used [3, 7]. However, the catalyst still suffers from problems such as deactivation mainly due to carbon deposits and metal sintering.

[3] Fig. 8 presents catalytic performance for PDH on PtSn/B-ZrO2-x as a function of reaction time. The initial propane conversion is 31.5% for PtSn/B-ZrO2-9 and 36.0% for PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 whereas it is 34.8% for PtSn/B-ZrO2-11. 

[4] The most stable catalyst is obtained on PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 with the deactivation rate constant (kd) of 0.0127 h1.

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that PtSn/B-ZrO2 catalysts have high initial activity and the PtSn/B-ZrO2-10 catalyst synthesized at pH 10 exhibits the best stability among the catalysts studied, with a deactivation rate constant of 0.0127 h-1. The initial propane conversion and propylene selectivity data are also provided.
