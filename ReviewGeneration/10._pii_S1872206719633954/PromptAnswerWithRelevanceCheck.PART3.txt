[1] The peaks at 2115 and 2174 cm−1 are from gas-phase CO. The absence of 1800 cm−1 band suggests high dispersion of Pt.
[2] Sn 3d XPS spectra show Sn mainly in Sn2+/Sn4+ state on all catalysts. This implies boron-modified ZrO2 stabilizes oxidation state of Sn.
[3] The CO oxidation temperature is lowest over PtSn/B-ZrO2-10. More Pt-Sn interfaces from stronger interaction between Pt and Sn are proposed. 
[4] No relevant quotes
[5] No relevant quotes
[6] XPS results indicate electronic properties of Pt and SnOx are affected by their interaction and interaction with support.
[7] No evaluation of different reactor types.
