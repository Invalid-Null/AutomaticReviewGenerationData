[1] "Transition-metal ions (V, Cr, Fe, Co, etc.) isolated on silica surfaces are known to catalyze such processes."  

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation can be catalyzed by a variety of dispersed metal ions on silica, prepared by impregnation of metal salts on a support followed by calcination."

[3] "the mechanisms of these processes are currently unknown but are thought to involve CH activation as the rate-determining step."

</quotes>

2. The article explains that catalysts like transition metal ions on silica surfaces facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers through mechanisms thought to involve CH activation as the rate-determining step. It also states that metal ions on silica prepared by impregnation methods are known to catalyze propane dehydrogenation.

[1] "Conversion of hydrocarbons from petroleum typically requires CH activation before any changes to the carbon skeleton can take place. Transition-metal ions (V, Cr, Fe, Co, etc.) isolated on silica surfaces are known to catalyze such processes." 

[2] "the catalyst is very stable and its activity increases slightly with time on stream, unlike the industrial catalyst."

3. The article introduces that transition metal ions isolated on silica surfaces are known catalysts for hydrocarbon conversion reactions that require CH activation. It also mentions that Co(II) sites on silica are very stable propane dehydrogenation catalysts whose activity increases over time, unlike industrial catalysts. No other specific catalyst classes are discussed.
