1. The article does not evaluate promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

1. 该文没有评价Cr2O3、Pt-Sn、Ga2O3等有前途的金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] In general, the catalysts can be ordered in terms of the improvement of their activity through ZnO as follows: 4Zn/TiZrOx > 4Zn/CeZrOx > 4Zn/LaZrOx > 4Zn/YZrOx > 4Zn/ZrO2.

[2] Isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ species could be formed upon high-temperature calcination, promoting insertion of Zn2+ cations into the position of the Zr4+ cation in the lattice of ZrO2. 

[3] Moreover, we also established that supporting ZnO on ZrO2 or MZrOx inhibits the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen (Table 2).

[4] When comparing catalysts in terms of coke formation, it is important to consider the amount of propane converted, because coke is mainly formed from propene and to a minor extent directly from propane.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It finds that adding ZnO to different ZrO2-based supports greatly enhances activity, likely by modifying the oxidation state and oxygen mobility of the supports. It also shows that basicity affects coke formation.

</English version answer>  

<Chinese version answer>

2. 是的,该文研究了调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧迁移率和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢反应性能。它发现在不同的ZrO2基支撑物上添加ZnO大大提高了活性,可能是通过调节支撑物的氧化态和氧迁移率实现的。它还显示碱性会影响焦炭生成。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] When lattice oxygen is removed, Zr(cus) cations are formed. Two such sites form the active site for propane dehydrogenation.

[2] Isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ cations anchored on ZrO2 were suggested to actively participate in the target reaction. 

[3] The obtained catalytic data strongly suggest that there is a synergy effect between Zn2+, ZrO2, and TiO2 in terms of the intrinsic activity of the active sites.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. It suggests that isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ sites anchored on ZrO2 are active, possibly with a synergistic effect between Zn2+, ZrO2, and TiO2. It also notes that Zr(cus) sites formed by removing lattice oxygen are active on ZnO-free ZrO2 catalysts.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

3. 是的,该文提出了在所研究的金属氧化物催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机理情况。它认为锚定在ZrO2上的孤立三配位Zn2+位是活性中心,Zn2+、ZrO2和TiO2之间可能存在协同效应。它还指出,通过去除晶格氧形成的Zr(cus)位点在不含ZnO的ZrO2催化剂上是活性中心。

[1] "We focused our research on (i) identifying the kind of active sites, (ii) understanding the fundamentals for their formation, and (iii) the factors affecting product selectivity including coke formation and catalyst on-stream stability."

[2] "Isolated Zn2+ cations anchored on ZrO2 were suggested to actively participate in the target reaction."  

[3] "They [isolated Zn2+ cations] reveal a low ability toward coke formation and accordingly low deactivation."

[4] "In contrast to crystalline ZrO2, the usage of X-ray amorphous ZrO2 is of advantage for homogeneous distribution of Zn2+ on the surface of ZrO2."

[5] "The obtained catalytic data strongly suggest that there is a synergy effect between Zn2+, ZrO2, and TiO2 in terms of the intrinsic activity of the active sites."
