 Unfortunately the given literature does not provide any relevant information to answer the questions asked. The article focuses on elucidating the nature of active sites and fundamentals for their creation in Zn-containing ZrO2-based catalysts for nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation. It does not compare metallic vs oxidized supported metal catalysts, evaluate Pt alloy catalysts, investigate electronic/geometric effects in bimetallics, explore zeolite supports, or discuss tuning zeolite properties.
