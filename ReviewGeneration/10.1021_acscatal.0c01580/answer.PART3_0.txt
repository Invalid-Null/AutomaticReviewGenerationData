<quotes>
[1] "To derive mechanistic insights into the structure of active sites, reactivity, selectivity, and on-stream stability, the catalysts were characterized by XRD, HRTEM, EDX mapping, XPS, X-ray absorption, CO-TPR, CO2-TPD, NH3-TPD, pyridine-FTIR, operando UVvis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, TPO, and temporal analysis of products."

[2] "In situ XANES measurements were carried out as follows. The 4Zn/TiZrOx catalyst (sieve fraction of 100–200 μm) was loaded in an in situ microreactor (quartz capillary, 1.5 mm diameter, 0.02 mm wall thickness). It was heated in a flow of 20 vol % H2 in He up to 600 °C. XANES spectra were recorded every 100 °C. Before recording the spectra, the sample was kept at each temperature for 10 min."

[3] "For analyzing coke formation and removal, ex situ Raman, operando UVvis spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed oxidation of spent catalysts were used."

[4] "To distinguish between Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites, IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded."

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes several in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts, including:

- In-situ XANES to analyze the oxidation state of Zn and Zr under reducing conditions up to 600°C (Quote 2). 

- Operando UV-vis spectroscopy to analyze coke formation and removal during propane dehydrogenation (Quote 3).

- FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine to distinguish between Lewis and Brønsted acid sites (Quote 4).

[1] "The morphology of all catalysts was analyzed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Representative HRTEM images are shown in Figure 1b‒f and Figure S2." 

[2] "Transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were performed on a FEI F20 field emission source electron microscope equipped with aB6 electron gun."

[3] "As proven by energy dispersive X-ray element mapping (Figure S3), no ZnO aggregates could be observed in 4Zn/TiZrOx, which is in agreement with the XRD data (Figure 1a)."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article employs HRTEM and EDX mapping to characterize the metal-support interfaces and dispersion in the propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, HRTEM showed the mesoporous morphology of the catalysts, and EDX mapping demonstrated the absence of ZnO aggregates in 4Zn/TiZrOx (Quote 3).

[2] "To check if the oxidation state of Zn2+, Zr4+, and Ti4+ changes under reducing conditions, we carried out in situ XANES tests with 20 vol % H2 in He up to 600 °C (Figure S20) and NAP-XPS measurements at 550 °C using a C3H8/H2/N2 = 8:1:11 feed (Figure S21). No changes in the oxidation state could be determined by both techniques."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses in-situ XANES and NAP-XPS to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. In-situ XANES showed no changes in Zn, Zr, and Ti oxidation states under reducing conditions up to 600°C (Quote 2). NAP-XPS also showed no oxidation state changes at 550°C under propane dehydrogenation conditions (Quote 2).
