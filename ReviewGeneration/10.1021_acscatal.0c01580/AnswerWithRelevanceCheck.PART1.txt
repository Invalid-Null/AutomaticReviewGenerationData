         [1] In general, the catalysts can be ordered in terms of the improvement of their activity through ZnO as follows: 4Zn/TiZrOx > 4Zn/CeZrOx > 4Zn/LaZrOx > 4Zn/YZrOx > 4Zn/ZrO2.
         [2] Isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ species could be formed upon high-temperature calcination, promoting insertion of Zn2+ cations into the position of the Zr4+ cation in the lattice of ZrO2.  
         [3] Moreover, we also established that supporting ZnO on ZrO2 or MZrOx inhibits the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen (Table 2).
         [4] When comparing catalysts in terms of coke formation, it is important to consider the amount of propane converted, because coke is mainly formed from propene and to a minor extent directly from propane.

         Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It finds that adding ZnO to different ZrO2-based supports greatly enhances activity, likely by modifying the oxidation state and oxygen mobility of the supports. It also shows that basicity affects coke formation.

         是的,该文研究了调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧迁移率和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢反应性能。它发现在不同的ZrO2基支撑物上添加ZnO大大提高了活性,可能是通过调节支撑物的氧化态和氧迁移率实现的。它还显示碱性会影响焦炭生成。

         [1] When lattice oxygen is removed, Zr(cus) cations are formed. Two such sites form the active site for propane dehydrogenation.
         [2] Isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ cations anchored on ZrO2 were suggested to actively participate in the target reaction.
         [3] The obtained catalytic data strongly suggest that there is a synergy effect between Zn2+, ZrO2, and TiO2 in terms of the intrinsic activity of the active sites.

      <English>
         Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. It suggests that isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ sites anchored on ZrO2 are active, possibly with a synergistic effect between Zn2+, ZrO2, and TiO2. It also notes that Zr(cus) sites formed by removing lattice oxygen are active on ZnO-free ZrO2 catalysts.

         是的,该文提出了在所研究的金属氧化物催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机理情况。它认为锚定在ZrO2上的孤立三配位Zn2+位是活性中心,Zn2+、ZrO2和TiO2之间可能存在协同效应。它还指出,通过去除晶格氧形成的Zr(cus)位点在不含ZnO的ZrO2催化剂上是活性中心。
