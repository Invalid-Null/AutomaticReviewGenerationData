[1] "To this end, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Merck, 98%), La(NO3)3·6H2O (Merck, 99%), Y(NO3)3·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%), Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Alfa Aesar, 99.5%), and ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) were used for the synthesis of Zn-containing catalysts."

[2] "The catalysts were prepared through an impregnation method. Generally, a required amount of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was added to 8 mL of deionized water and stirred until the solution was formed." 

[3] "For both cases, 3 g of each support was then added to a Zn-containing solution and heated to 65 C under continuous stirring until the suspension became a slurry."

<English version answer>  
Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes using an impregnation method to deposit zinc nitrate onto various metal oxide supports like ZrO2, LaZrOx, YZrOx, and CeZrOx. The zinc nitrate solution is stirred with the support at 65°C to form a slurry, aiming to evenly disperse the zinc species.

[1] "In situ XANES measurements were carried out as follows. The 4Zn/TiZrOx catalyst (sieve fraction of 100–200 μm) was loaded in an in situ microreactor (quartz capillary, 1.5 mm diameter, 0.02 mm wall thickness). It was heated in a flow of 20 vol % H2 in He up to 600 °C. XANES spectra were recorded every 100 °C. Before recording the spectra, the sample was kept at each temperature for 10 min."

[2] "To check if the oxidation state of Zn2+, Zr4+, and Ti4+ changes under reducing conditions, we carried out in situ XANES tests with 20 vol % H2 in He up to 600 °C (Figure S20) and NAP-XPS measurements at 550 °C using a C3H8/H2/N2 = 8:1:11 feed (Figure S21). No changes in the oxidation state could be determined by both techniques."

Answer: The article utilizes in-situ XANES and NAP-XPS to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It performs in-situ XANES on 4Zn/TiZrOx under 20% H2 up to 600°C, taking spectra every 100°C. It also does NAP-XPS at 550°C under a C3H8/H2/N2 feed. These in-situ techniques revealed no changes in the Zn, Zr, and Ti oxidation states under reducing conditions.

回答:该文利用原位XANES和NAP-XPS技术研究工作中的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它在20%H2气氛中对4Zn/TiZrOx进行了原位XANES,在600°C以下每100°C记录一次谱图。它还在550°C、C3H8/H2/N2气氛下进行了NAP-XPS。这些原位技术显示,在还原条件下Zn、Zr和Ti的氧化态没有发生变化。
