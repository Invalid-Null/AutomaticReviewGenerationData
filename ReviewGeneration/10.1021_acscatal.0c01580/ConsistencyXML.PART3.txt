To determine the consistency ratios, I compared each answer file's response for a given question to the correct answer provided. If the file's answer conveyed the same information as the correct answer, I assigned a consistency ratio of 100%. If there was no overlap in content, I assigned 0%. For partial overlap, I estimated a percentage based on the similarity of key details.

The XML format organizes this comparison by question, with each question containing an <answer> element for each file specifying the percentage match to the correct response. This allows easy analysis of the consistency across files for each specific question. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the format.
