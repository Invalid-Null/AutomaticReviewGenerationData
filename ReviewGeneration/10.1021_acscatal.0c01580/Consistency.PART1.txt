 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative files, I have compiled the consistency ratios between each answer file and the correct answers in the requested JSON format:

```json

    "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART1_3.txt": "0%"
  },
  "2": {

}
```

I carefully compared the content of each answer file to the correct answers to determine the consistency percentages. Files containing no relevant information were scored 0%, while files with identical answers to the correct answers were scored 100%. In between, I estimated approximate consistency based on overlap of key details. Please let me know if you would like me to explain or clarify any part of the analysis.
