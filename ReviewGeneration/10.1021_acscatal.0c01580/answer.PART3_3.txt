</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "To check if and how the kind of support affects time-on-stream stability and selectivity to propene, we carried out a test lasting for 1 h on the propane stream with the 4Zn/MZrOx catalysts."

[2] "Regardless of the catalyst pretreatment (reductive or oxidative), 4Zn/TiZrOx revealed the highest stability and the highest selectivity to propene."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates methods for optimizing active phase dispersion by depositing ZnO on various ZrO2-based supports. It evaluates the time-on-stream stability and selectivity to propene for the different 4Zn/MZrOx catalysts. The 4Zn/TiZrOx catalyst showed the highest stability and selectivity to propene.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 该文通过在各种基于ZrO2的载体上沉积ZnO来研究优化活性相分散的方法。它评估了不同的4Zn/MZrOx催化剂的在线稳定性和丙烯选择性。4Zn/TiZrOx催化剂显示出最高的稳定性和丙烯选择性。

[1] "In situ XANES measurements were carried out as follows. The 4Zn/TiZrOx catalyst (sieve fraction of 100-200 μm) was loaded in an in situ microreactor (quartz capillary, 1.5 mm diameter, 0.02 mm wall thickness). It was heated in a flow of 20 vol % H2 in He up to 600 °C. XANES spectra were recorded every 100 °C."

[2] "To check if the oxidation state of Zn2+, Zr4+, and Ti4+ changes under reducing conditions, we carried out in situ XANES tests with 20 vol % H2 in He up to 600 °C (Figure S20) and NAP-XPS measurements at 550 °C using a C3H8/H2/N2 = 8:1:11 feed (Figure S21). No changes in the oxidation state could be determined by both techniques."

<English version answer> 
Answer: The article utilizes in-situ XANES and NAP-XPS to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It performed in-situ XANES on 4Zn/TiZrOx under 20% H2 up to 600°C, and NAP-XPS under reaction conditions. Both techniques showed no changes in oxidation state of Zn, Zr, and Ti under reducing/reaction conditions.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 该文利用了原位XANES和NAP-XPS来研究工作中的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它在20% H2气氛下对4Zn/TiZrOx进行了原位XANES测试,测试温度达到600°C,并在反应条件下进行了NAP-XPS。两种技术都显示Zn、Zr和Ti的氧化态在还原/反应条件下没有变化。
