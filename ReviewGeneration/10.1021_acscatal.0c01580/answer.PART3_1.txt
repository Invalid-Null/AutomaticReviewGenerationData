[1] "In situ XANES measurements were carried out as follows. The 4Zn/TiZrOx catalyst (sieve fraction of 100200 μm) was loaded in an in situ microreactor (quartz capillary, 1.5 mm diameter, 0.02 mm wall thickness). It was heated in a flow of 20 vol % H2 in He up to 600 C. XANES spectra were recorded every 100 C. Before recording the spectra, the sample was kept at each temperature for 10 min."

[2] "Near-ambient pressure XPS (NAP-XPS Specs GmbH) measurements were performed at a total pressure of 2 mbar using a monochromatic Al Kα radiation source (E = 1486.6 eV). The analysis chamber was initially filled with N2 followed by feeding the reaction mixture (40 vol % C3H8 and 5 vol % H2 in N2). The sample was mounted on a stainless-steel sample plate heated by a laser heating system to 823 K. Temperature was monitored by a thermocouple in direct contact with the sample surface. Reaction gases are monitored with a Quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS MKS e-vision 2) attached to the lens system of the spectrometer (Phoibos 150). The electron binding energies are referenced to the C 1s core level of carbon at 284.8 eV (CC and CH bonds)."

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ XANES and near-ambient pressure XPS to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. In-situ XANES was used to monitor changes in the Zn oxidation state during H2 reduction up to 600°C. NAP-XPS was used to analyze surface species during propane dehydrogenation at 550°C and 2 mbar total pressure.

[2] "To check if the oxidation state of Zn2+, Zr4+, and Ti4+ changes under reducing conditions, we carried out in situ XANES tests with 20 vol % H2 in He up to 600 C (Figure S20) and NAP-XPS measurements at 550 C using a C3H8/H2/N2 = 8:1:11 feed (Figure S21). No changes in the oxidation state could be determined by both techniques."

Answer: Yes, the article uses in-situ XANES and NAP-XPS X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. In-situ XANES showed no changes in Zn, Zr, and Ti oxidation states during H2 reduction up to 600°C. NAP-XPS also showed no changes under propane dehydrogenation conditions at 550°C.
