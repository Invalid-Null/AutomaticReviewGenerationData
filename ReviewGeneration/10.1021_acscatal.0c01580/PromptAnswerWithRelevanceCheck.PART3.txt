[1] "To derive mechanistic insights into the structure of active sites, reactivity, selectivity, and on-stream stability, the catalysts were characterized by XRD, HRTEM, EDX mapping, XPS, X-ray absorption, CO-TPR, CO2-TPD, NH3-TPD, pyridine-FTIR, operando UVvis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, TPO, and temporal analysis of products."

[2] "In situ XANES measurements were carried out as follows. The 4Zn/TiZrOx catalyst (sieve fraction of 100–200 μm) was loaded in an in situ microreactor (quartz capillary, 1.5 mm diameter, 0.02 mm wall thickness). It was heated in a flow of 20 vol % H2 in He up to 600 °C. XANES spectra were recorded every 100 °C. Before recording the spectra, the sample was kept at each temperature for 10 min."

[3] "For analyzing coke formation and removal, ex situ Raman, operando UVvis spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed oxidation of spent catalysts were used."

[4] "To distinguish between Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites, IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded."

[2] "Near-ambient pressure XPS (NAP-XPS Specs GmbH) measurements were performed at a total pressure of 2 mbar using a monochromatic Al Kα radiation source (E = 1486.6 eV). The analysis chamber was initially filled with N2 followed by feeding the reaction mixture (40 vol % C3H8 and 5 vol % H2 in N2). The sample was mounted on a stainless-steel sample plate heated by a laser heating system to 823 K. Temperature was monitored by a thermocouple in direct contact with the sample surface. Reaction gases are monitored with a Quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS MKS e-vision 2) attached to the lens system of the spectrometer (Phoibos 150). The electron binding energies are referenced to the C 1s core level of carbon at 284.8 eV (CC and CH bonds)."

<English version answer>

1. No, the article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports.

2. No, the article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability.

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses depositing ZnO species onto ZrO2-based supports, showing that using X-ray amorphous ZrO2 favors homogeneous distribution of isolated Zn2+ species on the surface. The metal oxide promoter for crystalline ZrO2 also affects Zn2+ distribution.

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ XANES to study the oxidation state of Zn, Zr and Ti during propane dehydrogenation over ZnO/ZrO2 catalysts. The measurements show no changes in oxidation state up to 600°C under reducing conditions.

5. No, the article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

6. Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS) to probe the local coordination environment and oxidation state of Zn species in the catalysts. It shows Zn is present as isolated Zn2+ sites in ZnO/TiZrOx, while ZnO clusters also form in other supports. XANES confirms Zn2+ is the only zinc oxidation state.

7. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.
