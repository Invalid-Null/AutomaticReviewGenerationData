[1] In general, the catalysts can be ordered in terms of the improvement of their activity through ZnO as follows: 4Zn/TiZrOx > 4Zn/CeZrOx > 4Zn/LaZrOx > 4Zn/YZrOx > 4Zn/ZrO2.

[2] Isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ species could be formed upon high-temperature calcination, promoting insertion of Zn2+ cations into the position of the Zr4+ cation in the lattice of ZrO2. 

[3] Moreover, we also established that supporting ZnO on ZrO2 or MZrOx inhibits the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen (Table 2).

[4] When comparing catalysts in terms of coke formation, it is important to consider the amount of propane converted, because coke is mainly formed from propene and to a minor extent directly from propane.

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It finds that adding ZnO to different ZrO2-based supports greatly enhances activity, likely by modifying the oxidation state and oxygen mobility of the supports. It also shows that basicity affects coke formation.

[1] When lattice oxygen is removed, Zr(cus) cations are formed. Two such sites form the active site for propane dehydrogenation.

[2] Isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ cations anchored on ZrO2 were suggested to actively participate in the target reaction. 

[3] The obtained catalytic data strongly suggest that there is a synergy effect between Zn2+, ZrO2, and TiO2 in terms of the intrinsic activity of the active sites.

3. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. It suggests that isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ sites anchored on ZrO2 are active, possibly with a synergistic effect between Zn2+, ZrO2, and TiO2. It also notes that Zr(cus) sites formed by removing lattice oxygen are active on ZnO-free ZrO2 catalysts.

3. 是的,该文提出了在所研究的金属氧化物催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机理情况。它认为锚定在ZrO2上的孤立三配位Zn2+位是活性中心,Zn2+、ZrO2和TiO2之间可能存在协同效应。它还指出,通过去除晶格氧形成的Zr(cus)位点在不含ZnO的ZrO2催化剂上是活性中心。
