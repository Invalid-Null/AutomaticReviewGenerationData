         [1] "To check if and how the kind of support affects time-on-stream stability and selectivity to propene, we carried out a test lasting for 1 h on the propane stream with the 4Zn/MZrOx catalysts." 
         [2] "Regardless of the catalyst pretreatment (reductive or oxidative), 4Zn/TiZrOx revealed the highest stability and the highest selectivity to propene."

      <English>
         Answer: The article investigates methods for optimizing active phase dispersion by depositing ZnO on various ZrO2-based supports. It evaluates the time-on-stream stability and selectivity to propene for the different 4Zn/MZrOx catalysts. The 4Zn/TiZrOx catalyst showed the highest stability and selectivity to propene.

         [1] "In situ XANES measurements were carried out as follows. The 4Zn/TiZrOx catalyst (sieve fraction of 100–200 μm) was loaded in an in situ microreactor (quartz capillary, 1.5 mm diameter, 0.02 mm wall thickness). It was heated in a flow of 20 vol % H2 in He up to 600 °C. XANES spectra were recorded every 100 °C. Before recording the spectra, the sample was kept at each temperature for 10 min." 
         [2] "To check if the oxidation state of Zn2+, Zr4+, and Ti4+ changes under reducing conditions, we carried out in situ XANES tests with 20 vol % H2 in He up to 600 °C (Figure S20) and NAP-XPS measurements at 550 °C using a C3H8/H2/N2 = 8:1:11 feed (Figure S21). No changes in the oxidation state could be determined by both techniques."

      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ XANES and NAP-XPS to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. In-situ XANES showed no changes in Zn, Zr, and Ti oxidation states under reducing conditions up to 600°C. NAP-XPS also showed no oxidation state changes at 550°C under propane dehydrogenation conditions.

         [1] "The morphology of all catalysts was analyzed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Representative HRTEM images are shown in Figure 1b‒f and Figure S2."
         [2] "Transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were performed on a FEI F20 field emission source electron microscope equipped with aB6 electron gun." 
         [3] "As proven by energy dispersive X-ray element mapping (Figure S3), no ZnO aggregates could be observed in 4Zn/TiZrOx, which is in agreement with the XRD data (Figure 1a)."

      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article employs HRTEM and EDX mapping to characterize the metal-support interfaces and dispersion in the propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, HRTEM showed the mesoporous morphology of the catalysts, and EDX mapping demonstrated the absence of ZnO aggregates in 4Zn/TiZrOx.
