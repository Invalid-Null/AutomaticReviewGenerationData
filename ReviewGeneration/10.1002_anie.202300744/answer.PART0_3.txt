[1] The overall reaction rate of propylene formation is mainly determined by three factors: (1) the number (concentration) of surface protons, (2) the transition-state stability at proton collision, and (3) the selectivity to propylene desorption or decomposition.

[2] Imposing a direct current on a catalyst allows high conversion at low temperatures by gaining the external free energy of electricity.

[3] In this reaction system, the overall reaction rate of propylene formation can be derived by solving the rate equation of step 3 as the RDS under a quasi-stationary approximation and the site conservation condition as follows: 

rate = k3 K1 K2 P(C3H8) P(e-) C0 / [1 + (k3/k4) K1 K2 P(C3H8)]  

where k3 is the rate constant of the proton collision step, K1 and K2 are equilibrium constants, P(C3H8) is the partial pressure of propane, P(e-) is the surface proton concentration C0, and k4 is the rate constant for propylene formation. This indicates the reaction orders of P(C3H8), P(e-), and C0 are between 0-1. Experimentally measured orders were 0.22 for P(C3H8), 1.37 for P(e-), and 0.42 for C0.
