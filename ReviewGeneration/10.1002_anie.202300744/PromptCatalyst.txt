Surface Engineering of Titania Boosts Electroassisted Propane Dehydrogenation at Low Temperature

Graphical Abstract
Pt−In nanoalloy supported on Sm-doped TiO2 is a highly efficient catalyst for electroassisted propane dehydrogenation. Surface doping of Sm3+ enriched the surface proton density on TiO2 by charge compensation, which boosted propane dehydrogenation by accelerating proton collision on propane due to enhanced surface protonics. A propylene yield of 19.3 % was achieved at 300 °C, which is far beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation.
Abstract
Electric field catalysis using surface proton conduction, in which proton hopping and collision on the reactant are promoted by external electricity, is a promising approach to break the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation in endothermic propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This study proposes a catalyst design concept for more efficient electroassisted PDH at low temperature. Sm was doped into the anatase TiO2 surface to increase surface proton density by charge compensation. Pt−In alloy was deposited on the Sm-doped TiO2 for more favorable proton collision and selective propylene formation. The catalytic activity in electroassisted PDH drastically increased by doping an appropriate amount of Sm (1 mol % to Ti) where the highest propylene yield of 19.3 % was obtained at 300 °C where the thermodynamic equilibrium yield was only 0.5 %. Results show that surface proton enrichment boosts alkane dehydrogenation at low temperature.

Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks to produce chemicals and plastic products in the global chemical industry, and the propylene gap between the world demand and supply is gradually increasing.1-3 Therefore, on-purpose propylene production technologies such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are of great interest to the petrochemical marketplace.1 Owing to the highly endothermic properties of PDH reactions, a temperature range of 550 °C to 600 °C is required to gain sufficient equilibrium yield. However, the required high-temperature system for sufficient propane conversion is expensive and energy consuming. Moreover, under such high temperatures, side reactions and deactivation by coking and metal sintering occur, severely hindering practical utilization.1-3 Therefore, developing a catalytic system for PDH that works at a lower temperature region is highly attractive.
One of the promising approaches for such low-temperature conversion is electroassisted catalysis based on surface protonics. Imposing a direct current on a catalyst allows high conversion at low temperatures by gaining the external free energy of electricity.4 In this system, surface protons migrate on the oxide support by the Grotthuss mechanism and attack the reactant molecule at the metal–support interface, which allows the conversion of robust molecules such as methane (CH4),5-7 nitrogen (N2),8-10 and carbon dioxide (CO2)11 at low temperatures. Applying electric field catalysis can also be a promising way to break the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation of propane conversion at low temperatures. In this reaction system, the overall reaction rate of propylene formation is mainly determined by three factors: (1) the number (concentration) of surface protons, (2) the transition-state stability at proton collision, and (3) the selectivity to propylene desorption or decomposition. First, the number of surface protons, which is the density of surface hydroxyl groups, is the key factor that directly determines overall reaction rate. Surface hydroxyl groups can be enriched by doping a heterocation on the support oxide surface region by charge compensation (Scheme 1).12-14 For other factors, electron-enriched active sites are able to stabilize the cationic transition state formed by proton collision while diluting the active metal ensemble by alloying with an inert metal to increase selectivity to propylene.15-17 Indeed, we recently demonstrated that alloying Pt with In to form intermetallic Pt3In effectively satisfies requirements (2) and (3) (Scheme 1).15, 18 As a result, the combination of the two modifications is expected to boost the potential ability for electroassisted PDH at low temperatures.

The catalyst design for enhancing electroassisted PDH at low temperatures. Sm3+ is doped on the TiO2 surface to increase the number of surface protons by charge compensation. Pt−In alloy is used for selective formation of propylene and to enhance the proton collision with propane.
In this study, we discovered that doping Sm3+ into the surface of anatase TiO2, which is a common oxide support suitable for surface protonics,5, 19 successfully increased the concentration of surface hydroxyl groups of TiO2 by charge compensation. Moreover, the promotional effect of this surface engineering of TiO2 and the active site modification based on Pt−In alloying could be synergized to combine factors (1)–(3) (Scheme 1), thereby enabling a drastic enhancement in the catalytic activity in electroassisted propane dehydrogenation at 300 °C. The hybrid catalyst, Pt−In/Sm−TiO2, afforded the highest propylene yield of 19.3 % at a 300 °C furnace temperature, where the thermodynamic equilibrium yield is only 0.5 %. Herein, we report not only a highly efficient propylene production system working at low temperatures, but also an advanced and universal strategy for improving the catalytic performance of electric field catalysis.
Results and Discussion
First, the dopant cation was selected according to the following criteria: (1) trivalent, to capture a proton by charge compensation (hydroxyl group is formed by attaching H+ on the adjacent lattice oxygen), (2) non-reducible and no other oxidation states, and (3) a much larger ionic radius than Ti4+, such that bulk region substitution is unfavorable. In this study, Sm3+ with an ionic radius (1.086 Å) much larger than that of Ti4+ (0.68 Å),21 was chosen as a dopant for anatase TiO2 support.13 Second, Sm should be doped only at the TiO2 surface region to obtain a higher content of surface hydroxyl groups while retaining the bulk conductivity of TiO2 support. Therefore, we prepared Sm-doped TiO2 (Sm−TiO2) using a hydrothermal method with anatase TiO2 as a core and Sm−Ti sol for the shell (Figure 1a). For the control sample, we also prepared Sm-loaded TiO2 (Sm/TiO2) by hydrothermal synthesis of a TiO2 shell on anatase TiO2 followed by impregnation of Sm3+ (Figure S1). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that the crystal structure of bulk anatase TiO2 and the crystallite size changed little upon Sm doping (10–11 nm, Figure S2), the latter of which was also consistent with the mean particle size (12.1 nm, Figure S3). This indicates that the Sm-containing TiO2 shell was constructed as a very thin layer on the surface of bare TiO2. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of Sm−TiO2 showed bright dots in the TiO2 crystal (Figure 1b), indicating that the doped Sm was highly dispersed in an isolated state. Elemental analysis confirmed that the Sm/Ti ratio (including bare TiO2) was 0.009 (Figure S4) which is consistent with the fed ratio in material synthesis (1 mol %). We also performed a cross-sectional analysis of Sm−TiO2 using fast-ion bombardment (FIB) etching.

Cross-sectional HAADF-STEM revealed that high crystallinity was retained to the outermost surface layers (Figure 1c), suggesting that the Sm-containing TiO2 layer was epitaxially grown on the bare TiO2. The corresponding elemental map showed that Sm was located mainly on the shell part and grain boundary of the nanocrystals (Figure 1d). Although there were some Sm spots overlapping on the bulk part of TiO2, this may be due to Sm species presenting on the backside surface of TiO2 nanocrystals. High-resolution HAADF-STEM showed that Sm actually replaced the surface Ti site (Figure 1e), demonstrating that surface doping was successfully performed. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis was then performed to obtain further structural information. The Sm K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of Sm−TiO2 and Sm/TiO2 showed absorption edge features similar to that of Sm2O3, confirming that the Sm species in these samples are in the trivalent state (Figure S5). Fourier transforms of the extended XAFS (EXAFS) spectra of Sm−TiO2 and Sm/TiO2 showed single coordination peaks assignable to Sm−O without any scattering of the second coordination sphere (Figure 1f), which indicates the high dispersion of Sm cations consistent with the results of HAADF-STEM and XRD. Notably, the Sm−O bond length of Sm−TiO2 was shorter than those of bulk Sm2O3 and Sm/TiO2 (see Table S1 and Figure S6 for curve fitting details). This is probably because Sm3+ was confined to the surface cation vacancy of TiO2 (Figure 1g), which is narrower than the environment of surface-loaded Sm (Figure 1h) and bulk Sm2O3.
Then, Pt and In were co-impregnated and alloyed on the Sm-doped and -loaded TiO2 (Figure 1a and Figure S1). Figure 1i shows the HAADF-STEM image of Pt−In/Sm−TiO2, wherein the size of Pt−In alloy particles ranges mainly from 2 to 4 nm (average: 2.7 nm). Elemental analysis revealed the Pt : In atomic ratio in the nanoparticle region was 3.00 : 0.97 on average (Figure S7). The XAFS analyses revealed that Pt and In were in metallic states (Figure S8) and indicated the presence of Pt−Pt and Pt−In scattering with a coordination number ratio close to 2 (5.7/3.1=1.84 for Pt−In/Sm−TiO2, Table S2 and Figures S9), which is that of the intermetallic Pt3In phase. These results strongly suggest the formation of intermetallic Pt3In as small nanoparticles on the Sm-doped TiO2 surface. Notably, similar XAFS results were obtained for Pt−In/Sm/TiO2 and Pt−In/TiO2 (XANES feature and coordination number ratio: 2.0, Table S2 and Figure S9), indicating that the degree of alloying and electronic state of Pt did not differ depending on the state or presence/absence of Sm. XPS analysis also showed that the electron density of Pt was not changed upon Sm-doping (Figure S10). The Pt dispersion of Pt−In/Sm−TiO2 estimated by CO chemisorption was 45.2 %, which was consistent with the particle size (STEM: 2.7 nm) when a half cuboctahedron was considered (model: 2.8 nm, Figure S11). Pt−In/TiO2 showed a similar but slightly higher Pt dispersion (56.5 %), indicating that the particle size is slightly smaller than that of the Sm-doped catalyst.
Next, we conducted infrared-mass temperature-programmed desorption (IR-MS-TPD) analysis to correctly quantify the number of surface hydroxyl groups upon Sm doping to TiO2. Figure 2a shows the FT-IR spectra of Pt−In/Sm−TiO2 at elevated temperatures from 100 to 800 °C under He flow. The peaks appearing at 3670 cm−1 and 1620 cm−1 are assigned to the O−H stretching vibrations of isolated surface hydroxyl groups21 and the scissors bending mode of molecularly adsorbed water, respectively.22 The O−H stretching vibration of hydrogen-bonded water was also observed as a broad band around 3300 cm−1. This broad feature was little observed for undoped Pt−In/TiO2 and Pt−In/Sm/TiO2 (Figure S12), indicating that Sm-doping made the surface more polar due to an increase in the surface hydroxyl group. Changes in peak area (absorbance) upon heating under He flow were plotted against temperature (Figure 2b), which correspond to the qualitative TPD profiles of surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed water. At 300 °C, water desorption completed, while dehydration condensation of surface hydroxyl groups did not start. Therefore, the number of surface hydroxyl groups can be separately quantified when the sample was preheated at 300 °C, followed by MS-TPD.23 Figure 2c shows the MS-TPD spectra of the prepared catalysts after dehydration. The amount of desorbed water was determined from the integrated peak area of the TPD spectra. The density of surface hydroxyl groups was estimated as the peak area in the MS-TPD per gram of catalyst, which is summarized in Figure 2d. Surface hydroxyl density of Pt−In/Sm−TiO2 was approximately 4.4 and 3.6 times higher than those of undoped Pt−In/TiO2 and Pt−In/Sm/TiO2, respectively. Thus, Sm doping drastically enriched surface hydroxyl groups on TiO2. More importantly, the Sm-loaded sample showed only a little enrichment in surface hydroxyl density demonstrating that embedding Sm cations into the lattice of TiO2 at near surface region is essential for enrichment. The slight increase in surface hydroxyl groups by Sm loading for Pt−In/Sm/TiO2 might be due to the filling of small amount of cation vacancies originally presenting at the TiO2 surface.

The prepared catalysts were tested in PDH using a fixed-bed continuous flow reactor. Two stainless steel rods were placed as electrodes in contact with the top and bottom of the catalyst bed to impose a direct current on the catalyst (Figure 3a, see Figure S13 for detailed setup). Before the reaction, the catalyst was pretreated under flowing H2 at 500 °C to reduce the metal particles and TiO2 supports. Notably, partial reduction of TiO2 is necessary for moderate bulk conductivity to facilitate surface protonics. Figure 3b shows the propylene yield dependence on electric power supplied to the system. Propylene yield was very low (<1 %) when no electricity was applied, which corresponds to the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation at 300 °C (Figure S14). Depending on electric power, the propylene yield monotonously increased, which indicates that PDH occurs with the aid of electricity (see Figure S15 for changes in electric power and voltage depending on current). However, electricity dependence varies widely among catalysts. For Pt−In-loaded catalysts, the catalytic performance order is as follows: Pt−In/Sm−TiO2>Pt−In/Sm/TiO2>Pt−In/TiO2, which is consistent with that of surface hydroxyl density (Figure 2d).

Thus, Sm doping on the TiO2 surface drastically improved electroassisted PDH catalytic performance. Pt−In/Sm−TiO2 gave sufficiently high propylene selectivity and carbon balance (>97 % and >95 %, respectively, Figure 3c,d), which can be attributed to the alloying effect by In.15 Although the catalyst bed temperature slightly increased up to 360 °C due to Joule heating (Figure 3d), the obtained propylene yields were far beyond thermal catalysis limitation (equilibrium yield at 360 °C: 2.0 %), suggesting the assistance of external free energy from electricity for the uphill reaction (ΔG360°C=+41 kJ mol−1).24 Propylene yield further increased to 19.3 % when electric power was elevated to 5.35 W (Table S3); this was the highest yield obtained in this study.
Reaching a yield level of approximately 20 % is also attractive for practical application because it is close to the commercial level (typically >25 % yield).1 However, propylene yield and selectivity slightly decreased for Pt−In/Sm/TiO2 when electric power exceeded 2.5 W, which implies that Sm cations loaded on TiO2 have negative effects not only on propane conversion but also on selective propylene formation. Therefore, Sm cations must be doped to the surface Ti sites but not be placed on the TiO2 surface. We also performed a control experiment using Ce4+, a similar lanthanoid but tetravalent cation, as a dopant to TiO2 instead of Sm3+. The resulting Pt−In/Ce−TiO2 (Ce: 1.0 mol %) catalyst showed surface proton density and the catalytic activity trend similar to those of the undoped Pt−In/TiO2 (Figure S16). This supports that the enrichment in surface proton by Sm3+ doping was surely due to charge compensation.
Then, to prove that surface hydroxyl density governs electroassisted PDH catalytic activity, a series of Pt−In/Sm−TiO2 catalysts with different Sm contents (0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, and 2 mol %) were prepared and their performances compared. The XRD patterns of the Pt−In/Sm−TiO2 catalysts showed that no diffraction other than anatase TiO2 phase was observed, indicating that no Sm segregation occurred even for 2 mol % Sm doping (Figure S17). Figure 3e shows Sm content dependence of the density of surface hydroxyl groups (measured by MS−TPD, Figure S18). The surface hydroxyl density monotonously increased with Sm doping up to 1 mol %, demonstrating proton enrichment by charge compensation. However, the surface hydroxyl density began to decrease with an increase in Sm content. This is likely because doping a large amount of Sm induced TiO2 structure deformation at the surface. Next, these catalysts were tested in electroassisted PDH, wherein the activity trend is plotted with the surface hydroxyl density as shown in Figure 3e. As a universal scale for catalytic activity in the electroassisted system, we applied propylene formation rates per electric power to the system. The activity trend agreed with the surface hydroxyl density with 1 mol % at the top, demonstrating that the number of surface hydroxyl groups determines the overall reaction rate of electroassisted PDH. We also tested the stability of Pt−In/Sm−TiO2 in electroassisted PDH at 300 °C, where the specific activity changed little up to 2 hours (Figure S19). Although slight deactivation was observed, this was probably due to the accumulation of carbonaceous species on the catalyst (Figure S20).
Finally, a mechanistic study was conducted to understand the electroassisted PDH catalytic system. Figure 3f shows the Eyring plots obtained from electroassisted PDH over Pt−In/Sm−TiO2. The ΔH≠ and ΔS≠ values were consistent with those of Pt−In/TiO2 (ΔH≠=21 kJ mol−1, ΔS≠=−219 kJ mol−1) but much lower than the corresponding values for thermal catalysis (ΔH≠=84 kJ mol−1, ΔS≠=−130 kJ mol−1) we recently reported.15 This suggests that Sm doping itself did not influence the energetics of electroassisted PDH and is consistent with an increase in the number of protons enhancing the overall reaction rate. The much lower ΔS≠ indicates that the rate determining step (RDS) is the proton collision to propane (associative path), unlike C−H activation of propane (dissociative path) in thermal catalysis. A kinetic study was then performed to further understand the role of Sm. The reaction mechanism of electroassisted PDH through surface protonics can be described as follows:

where, , , and indicate proton acceptor on the surface (excess), proton acceptor at the metal-support interface, and metallic adsorption site, respectively (1: proton hopping, 2: propane physisorption, 3: proton collision to propane, 4: propylene formation, 5: propylene desorption). The overall reaction rate can be derived by solving the rate equation of step 3 as the RDS under a quasi-stationary approximation and the site conservation condition as follows (see the Supporting Information page 15 for details):
(6)
where, kn, Kn, PX, E, and C0 are the rate equation of step n, equilibrium constant of step n, partial pressure of X, electric power, and surface proton density, respectively. Equation (6) indicates that the reaction order of P , C0, and E range between 0–1, 0–1, and 1–2, respectively. Their experimental reaction orders at 300 °C were 0.22, 0.42, and 1.37 (Figure S21), respectively, which are consistent with the predicted order ranges, thereby demonstrating the validity of this kinetic model. Interestingly, the reaction order of P was lower than that reported for Pt−In/TiO2 (0.75), whereas E was very close (1.44).15 This implies that the contribution of the K2P term in the denominator of Equation (6) became larger; namely, propane adsorption (step 2) was favored upon Sm doping. It has been reported that a coordinatively unsaturated metal cation site with a neighboring oxygen vacancy acts as an adsorption site for light alkanes.1 Therefore, there is a possibility that Sm-doping generates some oxygen vacancies other than surface protons, the former of which act as an effective adsorption site of propane at the metal–support interface and supply it to the neighboring Pt sites. Thus, it is likely that Sm doping not only enriches surface proton density but also promotes propane adsorption, both of which accelerate the rate of proton collision on propane (i.e., RDS in electroassisted PDH).
We also evaluated the energy efficiency of this catalytic system based on enthalpy gain from the endothermic reaction (C3H8→C3H6+H2: ΔH300°C=+128.0 kJ mol−1). For example, for the propylene yield of 13.7 % by Pt−In/Sm−TiO2 (at 3.36 W, Figure 3b), the enthalpy gain was estimated to be 0.12 J s−1 (W), which corresponds to 3.6 % energy efficiency for the supplied electric power. In contrast, for undoped Pt−In/TiO2, the corresponding energy efficiency was 1.7 % (0.054 J s−1 for 6.2 % yield at 3.14 W, Figure 3b). Thus, an approximately 2.1-fold enhancement in energy efficiency was achieved by the Sm doping strategy. Since the energy loss may be largely due to the bulk conduction of TiO2 and the resulting Joule heating of the catalyst, it is reasonable to increase the fraction of surface proton conduction in the overall current by enrichment of surface hydroxyl groups for better efficiency.
Conclusion
In this study, we designed a novel catalyst for electroassisted low-temperature PDH based on surface protonics chemistry, the concept of which entirely differs from our previous catalyst design based on alloy chemistry. Sm cations were doped into the surface Ti sites of TiO2 using anatase TiO2 as a core and Ti−Sm sol as a shell, which increased the density of surface protons (hydroxyl groups) by charge compensation. Nanoparticulate Pt−In with intermetallic Pt3In phase was supported on the Sm-doped TiO2 (Pt−In/Sm−TiO2), which acted as a highly efficient catalyst for electroassisted PDH at 300 °C. The catalytic activity in electroassisted PDH can be controlled by changing the surface hydroxyl density depending on the doping amount of Sm, where 1 mol % is the optimum doping amount. Thus, we discovered an unprecedented unique phenomenon that “surface proton density governs PDH activity”. A propylene yield of 19.3 % was obtained when an electric power of 5.35 W was applied, which is far beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation at 300 °C (only 0.5 %). Although Sm doping of TiO2 itself does not influence the reaction mechanism of electroassisted PDH based on surface protonics, it can drastically increase the overall reaction rate of propylene formation by promoting proton collisions on propane. This promotion is achieved not only by surface proton enrichment but also by the enhancement of propane adsorption by Sm. Thus, the results obtained in this study provide a highly efficient catalytic system for low-temperature alkane conversions and a general catalyst design concept for enhancing electroassisted catalysis based on surface protonics.
