Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question’s section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<quotes>

[1] "There remains significant scope for the development of better non-precious PDH catalysts." 

[2] "Their overall performance (typically, 65 mmol C3H6·gcat1·h1 from ref (14)) remains below the specific activity of Pt-based PDH catalysts (110 mmol C3H6·gcat1·h1 as a typical value from ref (15))."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. Yes, the article summarizes remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it notes there is significant scope to develop better non-precious metal PDH catalysts, as current non-precious catalysts have lower activity compared to Pt-based catalysts.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 

4. 是的,这篇文章总结了丙烷脱氢催化剂存在的挑战和知识空白。具体来说,它指出开发更好的非贵金属PDH催化剂仍有很大的提升空间,因为当前的非贵金属催化剂与基于钯的催化剂相比活性较低。
