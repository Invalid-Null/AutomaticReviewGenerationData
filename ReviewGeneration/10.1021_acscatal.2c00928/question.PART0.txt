Silicalite-1 Stabilizes Zn-Hydride Species for Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation
Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is promising for producing high value-added propylene. The discovery of a more efficient, economical, and nontoxic PDH catalyst is of great importance. Herein, we found zinc hydrides ([ZnH]+) as the highly reactive site for PDH. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that [ZnH]+ was transformed from zinc hydroxyl ([ZnOH]+) sites under reductive conditions. Accordingly, the formation of [ZnH]+ can be controlled by adjusting the amount of zinc hydroxyl ([ZnOH]+) species by various additives. The optimized CuZnO@S-1 consists of exclusively isolated [ZnOH]+ sites, which help produce more [ZnH]+ toward optimal PDH activity. Specifically, the catalyst enables 43% propane conversion with >88% propylene selectivity, close to the thermodynamic equilibrium. This efficient PDH performance was attributed to the electron-deficient Zn in [ZnH]+ that can lower the dehydrogenation barrier, and the Cu-modified [ZnH]+ structure favors the direct PDH pathway to further promote the formation of propylene and H2.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The growing availability of propane from shale gas and the increasing global demand for propylene have led to the development of technologies for on-purpose propylene manufacture. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial process that yields propylene with high selectivity. The main commercial processes for PDH are Oleflex and Catofin, which, respectively, rely on Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts. The high price of Pt and the toxicity of Cr6+ are the main drivers for the exploration of cheaper alternative catalysts with lower environmental impact. (13) Suitable non-precious-metal catalysts for PDH should contain coordinatively unsaturated sites (Mcus) that can lower dehydrogenation barriers by stabilizing dehydrogenated intermediates. Promising approaches involve the partial reduction of metal oxides and isolating metal species on a support. (49) Among the reported base metals, Zn exhibits superior PDH activity. Chen et al. and Zhao et al. reported good propane conversion over small ZnO nanoparticles (23 nm). (10,11) Han et al. and Xie et al. reported the stabilization of isolated Zn2+ ions on TiZr mixed oxides and silicalite-1 zeolites. (12,13) Recently, Zhao et al. reported an in situ reduction strategy to produce ZnOZn clusters interacted with the silanol nest of siliceous support, which shows the highest PDH activity among non-precious-metal PDH catalysts. (14) Nevertheless, their overall performance (typically, 65 mmol C3H6·gcat1·h1 from ref (14)) remains below the specific activity of Pt-based PDH catalysts (110 mmol C3H6·gcat1·h1 as a typical value from ref (15)). Thus, there remains significant scope for the development of better non-precious PDH catalysts.
Metal hydrides (MHx) are also promising catalysts for PDH, as the metal atoms in hydrides exhibit a lower electron density than the corresponding metal in oxides, (16) which stabilizes the propyl fragment upon dissociative adsorption of propane. It has, for instance, been shown that the propane turnover frequency over Ga hydrides is more than an order of magnitude higher than that over isolated Ga cations. (17) Another study reported that the ethane dehydrogenation barrier on In hydrides is substantially lower than on isolated In cations. (18) As MHx species are typically part of the catalytic cycle of PDH, (1,2) stabilizing the metal in the form of the corresponding hydride may be expected to reduce dehydrogenation barriers. Zeolites can stabilize Mcus sites due to the confinement effect of their microporous channels and, in this way, also stabilize the formation of MHx species. (19) Several recent studies focused on controlling the GaHx content in Ga/ZSM-5 by changing the Ga/Al ratio. (17,20) A drawback is the Al-containing zeolites typically contain strong Brnsted acid sites, which catalyze undesired cracking reactions. This explains why the propylene selectivity of the above-mentioned Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst is typically below 85%. Thus, it is worthwhile to explore the stabilization of MHx compounds in nonacidic zeolite.
Herein, we describe an efficient and noble-metal-free PDH catalyst based on the dispersion of highly dispersed Zn onto silicalite-1. Silicalite-1 is the all-silica analogue of ZSM-5 zeolite, which can suppress cracking and oligomerization side reactions. Zn is selected based on its outstanding performance among base metals according to the literature (14) and our own screening efforts. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) evidences the formation of Zn hydrides ([ZnH]+) upon H2 pretreatment and PDH reaction. Crucially, we found that the number of [ZnOH]+ species can be tuned by various additives, Cu being the predominant one among them. This helps in increasing the final [ZnH]+ amount toward higher PDH activity. In addition, Cu can further promote the intrinsic activity of [ZnH]+ by changing the PDH mechanism from an indirect pathway to a direct pathway.
Results and Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Based on screening a suite of catalysts for PDH, zinc was found to be more reactive than other transition metals (Figure S1). We optimized parameters such as support, zinc precursor, and Zn loading amount. The optimized ZnO@S-1 exhibits a propane conversion of 31.4% with a propylene selectivity of 93.9%, which is superior to ZnO_EDA@S-1, ZnO/DeAl-β, ZnO/HZSM-5, etc., which have been reported in the literature (Figure S2). (10,11,13) Therefore, it was taken as a benchmark to be further modified by various additives. The results in Figure 1a (see details in Figure S3) show that several additives, especially for Ga, Co, and Cu, result in an increased catalytic performance defined as space-time yield (STY) compared to parent ZnO@S-1, while several additives such as B lead to an inhibitory effect. The control experiments confirm that the activity contribution of Co, Cu, and Ga additives could be ignored in MZnO@S-1 catalysts (Figure S4). The catalytic performance and coke formation of these representative catalysts (ZnO@S-1 and MZnO@S-1 with Co, Cu, Ga, and B additives) were further analyzed in a 6 h PDH test (Figure S5). Notably, CuZnO@S-1 exhibits the best catalytic performance with propane conversion and propylene selectivity of 43 and 88%, respectively, which are close to the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion under given conditions (Figure 1b). The coke selectivity is about 0.51%, and the graphitic and disordered graphitic are the main coke species (Figure S6).
Figure 1
Figure 1. Catalytic performance in the PDH reaction. (a) Screening results of MZnO@S-1, reaction conditions: 0.15 g of catalyst, 600 C, 67 vol % propane balanced with H2, propane WHSV 4.7 h1; (b) experimental propane conversions vs thermodynamic equilibrium conversions simulated in Aspen Plus; (c) catalytic stability test under different operating conditions; and (d) regeneration of CuZnO@S-1 (similar reaction conditions as (a)).
The catalytic stability of CuZnO@S-1 under different reaction conditions was investigated (Figure 1c). The propane conversion decreases from 34 to 18% after 24 h harsh reactions (15) (600 C, pure propane with WHSV of 7.1 h1). The deactivation rate is 0.058 h1 based on first-order deactivation model. The H2 co-feed could inhibit coke formation to improve the catalytic stability (Figures 1c and S7). The CuZnO@S-1 could achieve an STY(C3H6) of 49.17 mmol C3H6·gcat1·h1 with a deactivation rate of 0.025 h1 under the 70 vol % C3H8-30 vol % H2 co-feed. No obvious Zn sintering was observed in the spent catalyst (Figure S8), and the Zn content was 1.66 wt % based on inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results indicate that Zn loss and coke deposits are the main deactivation reasons, rather than Zn sintering. We also evaluated the stability under less demanding conditions (550 C; with diluted N2 and H2 co-feed, propane WHSV of 3.55 h1). The propane conversion shows a slight decrease from 28.9 to 23.3%, while the propylene selectivity remained above 90%. The possibility to regenerate CuZnO@S-1 was investigated in 10 consecutive PDH runs with intermittent regeneration by calcination (Figure 1d). It is noted that mild regeneration at 500 C is beneficial for activity recovery (Figure S9). The initial propane conversion decreases from 43.2% in the first run to 37.2% in the seventh run and then became stable. The Zn content after the 10th PDH run is 1.86 wt % (2.05 wt % in fresh catalyst), and the Zn loss is acceptable compared to reported Zn PDH systems. (12) These results show that CuZnO@S-1 has appealing catalytic activity and promising durability. The simplicity of the preparation method and the low cost render CuZnO@S-1 a promising PDH catalyst.
Figure 2a shows an induction period for as-prepared CuZnO@S-1 when no H2 pretreatment was performed. Specifically, the propane conversion gradually increases from 19 to 43% with an increase of the propylene selectivity from 79 to 90% with time on stream. Such induction period can be eliminated by H2 pretreatment and was reproduced after air regeneration. The oxidative gas (i.e., O2 or CO2) co-feed also causes obvious activity loss (Figure S10). In situ DRIFTS measurements were performed to investigate the changes in the Zn speciation during the induction period. Figure 2b shows that the intensity of the ZnOH hydroxyl band (13) at 3635 cm1 decreases with increasing temperature during exposure to propane. Together with the erosion of the 3635 cm1 band, a band at 1844 cm1 appears, which can be attributed to the formation of [ZnH]+ (Zn-hydride) species. (21,22) The [ZnH]+ band assignment was also verified by the theoretical vibration analysis (Figure S11). The spectra point to the in situ transformation from zinc hydroxides ([ZnOH]+) to [ZnH]+ species during the PDH reaction, which was related to the observed induction periods in panel (a). Such induction periods and [ZnOH]+-to-[ZnH]+ transformation were also observed for other MZnO@S-1 catalysts (Figures S12 and S13). In addition, the reappearance of the induction period after regeneration (Figure 2a) may be because the air calcination can reoxidize the [ZnH]+ to [ZnOH]+ species (Figure S14). We then performed low-temperature in situ CO-DRIFT measurements to further identify Zn species and their transformation during H2 treatment. Figure 2c shows typical bands around 2160 cm1 for as-prepared catalysts, which is ascribed to CO adsorbed on isolated Zn2+ sites (from [ZnOH]+). (2325) For reduced CuZnO@S-1 and ZnO@S-1, new bands around 2137 cm1 were observed with the erosion of ZnOH bands at 2160 cm1. The increased vibration frequencies (2137 vs 2160 cm1) can be attributed to the formation of zinc hydrides as chemisorbed H* on ZnO will lead to the redshift of IR frequency of co-adsorbed CO. (22) In addition, the weak CO-DRIFT signal in BZnO@S-1 catalyst can be attributed to the lower amount of [ZnOH]+ species as discussed in the next section.

To further reveal the important role of [ZnH]+ species in propane activation, we choose the optimized CuZnO@S-1 to evaluate the catalytic performance of C3H8D2 co-feed and the DRIFT spectra upon D2 treatment. Figure 2d shows that the propane conversion under C3H8D2 reactant is only 22%, which is much lower than the corresponding conversion of 43% using the C3H8H2 co-feed. HD exchange DRIFT spectra in Figure 2e show that [ZnH]+-related bands at 1843 cm1 decrease upon D2 treatment, while new bands around 1638 and 1371 cm1 appear. The latter two bands are attributed to the HD and [ZnD]+ species, (26) which are formed by HD exchange reactions between D2 and [ZnH]+ species. The mass spectrometry spectra after H2/D2 pulse in Figure 2f further confirm the formation of HD species upon D2 treatment. The latter appearance of H2 response than HD is because the H2 produces from the consecutive exchange reaction with the latter. The erosion of [ZnH]+ species upon D2 treatment is related to the decreased PDH activity under C3H8D2 reactant, further revealing the unique role of [ZnH]+ species for propane activation. Indeed, the [ZnH]+ species were widely reported in aluminosilicate zeolites, but their activity for alkane activation is debated. (2729) The present work not only reveals that the [ZnH]+ could be stabilized by silicalite zeolites but also highlights its unique role in propane activation. More importantly, it is found that the [ZnH]+ formation could be regulated by the amount of [ZnOH]+ in as-prepared catalysts for improving PDH performance.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to gain insight into the structural transformation from [ZnOH]+ to [ZnH]+ under reductive conditions. The H2 molecules can readily dissociate on Zn zeolite catalysts, (30,31) which would produce Zn(H*)O(H*) configuration. The ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulation in Figure 3a,b shows that the dissociated H* on the O site can spontaneously react with the OH group in the [ZnOH]+ moiety to produce a H2O molecule, while the [ZnH]+ moiety keeps stable with a ZnHSi coordination (see details in Supporting Movie 1). As a result, the [ZnOH]+ to [ZnH]+ transformation via the pathway of [ZnOH]+ + H2 (g)  [ZnH]+ + H2O (g) is feasible with a negative Gibbs free energy change (ΔG = 0.28 eV). The Cu modification can further promote the [ZnOH]+ to [ZnH]+ transformation as revealed by the more negative ΔG value of 0.37 eV (Figure 3c). However, the production of zinc hydrides on [ZnO]3 (represent sintered ZnOx cluster) via H2 dissociation is unfavorable with a positive ΔG value of +0.19 eV. The DFT calculations further reveal the unique role of [ZnOH]+ to produce [ZnH]+.

The selected representative catalysts (ZnO@S-1 and MZnO@S-1 with Co, Cu, Ga, and B additives) all possess a typical MFI topological structure with a comparable pore structure, similar stacked nanosheet morphology, and actual Zn content (Figures S15 and S16 and Table S2). Combining with the [ZnOH]+-to-[ZnH]+ transformation and the increased propane conversions during induction periods, one can infer the additives would affect the amount of [ZnOH]+ and its derived [ZnH]+, thus leading to varied PDH activity for MZnO@S-1 catalysts. Thus, the quantification of [ZnOH]+ amount in as-prepared catalysts will be the focus of the following characterizations. The hydroxyl Fourier transform infrared (OH-FTIR) spectra in Figure 4a show bare silicalite-1 zeolite has only one band at 3735 cm1, attributing to the isolated silanol groups (SiOH). The SiOH band intensity decreases with the appearance of ZnOH hydroxyl band at 3635 cm1 after Zn introduction, revealing that [ZnOH]+ species are formed via consumption of SiOH species to coordinate with Zn sites. The integral area of the ZnOH band (I3635) was used to quantify the amount of [ZnOH]+ species. The results show that the promoted cases with Co, Cu, and Ga additives show higher [ZnOH]+ amounts than parent ZnO@S-1, while the inhibited BZnO@S-1 possesses a small amount of [ZnOH]+. Additionally, the MFI topology and abundant isolated SiOH species seem to be two important factors for [ZnOH]+ formation (Figures S17 and S18). The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) in Figures 4b and S19 indicate that no metallic Zn exists in fresh and reduced catalysts. Figure 4b further reveals the Zn LMM peaks in reduced catalysts all shift toward lower kinetic energies compared to its original position in fresh catalysts, which can be attributed to the [ZnOH]+-to-[ZnH]+ transformation. (28) Thus, the larger peak shifts for MZnO@S-1 (M = Co, Cu, and Ga) indicate the higher amount of [ZnOH]+ in these cases, while the smallest XPS peak shift of BZnO@S-1 is due to its lower amount of [ZnOH]+. For H2 temperature-programed reduction (H2-TPR) curves in Figure 4c, the parent ZnO@S-1 shows one TPR peak sited at 384 C, which can be attributed to the dehydroxylation of [ZnOH]+ species. (28) The TPR peaks in MZnO@S-1 with the additions of Co, Cu, and Ga shift toward lower temperatures than ZnO@S-1, suggesting that they can promote the [ZnOH]+-to-[ZnH]+ transformation, while the addition of B would restrain [ZnOH]+ transformation as it exhibits higher TPR temperature. Since the MOx (M = Co, Cu, Ga, B) shows no TPR peaks around 384C, we can correlate the 384 C-related H2 consumption to the transformation amount of [ZnOH]+ species. The results indicate that CuZnO@S-1 exhibits the largest 384 C-related H2 consumption (Figure S21 and Table S6), which is consistent with its highest intensity of the [ZnOH]+ IR-band (Figure 4d). The higher amount of [ZnOH]+ in CuZnO@S-1 was also revealed by the stronger intensity of the [ZnOH]+ band in Raman and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra (Figures S15b and S22). Moreover, Figure 4e shows that a good linear relationship exists between zinc hydroxyl IR-band area and propane conversion. Considering the [ZnOH]+ to [ZnH]+ transformation as indicated by Figure 2, one can infer that a higher amount of [ZnOH]+ in CuZnO@S-1 helps produce more [ZnH]+ species to achieve optimal activity.

The X-ray absorption fine structure technique was used for parent ZnO@S-1 and optimized CuZnO@S-1 to examine the chemical structure of metal sites. Figure 5a shows that the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of Zn K-edge for tested samples exhibit similar shape and position of absorption edge with standard ZnO, indicating that Zn mainly exists in the form of oxidation state rather than metallic state. The position of the Zn K-absorption peak in CuZnO@S-1 shifts to lower energy than parent ZnO@S-1, revealing a slight decrease in the Zn oxidation state with Cu modification. (14) Notably, the Zn k-absorption peak in H2-treated Cu-ZnO@S-1 exhibits a pronounced low-energy shift compared to the fresh one. This observation was because the [ZnOH]+-to-[ZnH]+ transformation leads to decreased Zn oxidation state, which is consistent with the Bader charge analysis (Figure S23). The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of ZnO@S-1 exhibit peaks at 1.52 and 3.05 Å (Figure 5b), which are attributed to the first ZnO shell and second ZnOZn shell coordination, respectively. (12,14) On the contrary, only one peak at 1.50 Å was identified for CuZnO@S-1, confirming that Cu can promote the formation of isolated Zn sites. The wavelet transform spectra in Figure 5c visually evidence the highly isolated Zn sites in CuZnO@S-1, while partial ZnOZn coordination related to ZnOx clusters was observed in parent ZnO@S-1. The coordination environment was further investigated by fitting the EXAFS results (Figure S24). As listed in Table S7, the ZnO coordination number (CN) of ZnO@S-1 is 3.4  0.2, while the CN of ZnOZn is 1.3  0.6. In comparison, no ZnOZn coordination was detected in the CuZnO@S-1 catalyst. The results indicate that CuZnO@S-1 possess exclusively isolated [ZnOH]+ sites, while both isolated [ZnOH]+ species and sintered [ZnO]x (x = 2-3) clusters exist in parent ZnO@S-1. No ZnOZn or ZnZn(Cu) coordination was detected for H2-treated CuZnO@S-1 catalyst (Figure 5b,c), which rules out the formation of ZnOx clusters and ZnCu alloys after H2 treatment. The CNs of ZnO in fresh CuZnO@S-1 and H2-treated CuZnO@S-1 are 3.9  0.1 and 3.4  0.4, respectively. The decreased ZnO coordination could be attributed to the [ZnOH]+-to-[ZnH]+ transformation as indicated by the in situ DRIFT and HD exchange measurements. In addition, the Cu K-edge XAFS analysis reveals that Cu exists as isolated Cu+ cations without CuOCu or CuCu coordination in CuZnO@S-1 (Figure S25 and Table S8). The higher Zn dispersion in CuZnO@S-1 was also verified by special aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope images and ultravioletvisible (UVvis) diffuse reflectance spectra (Figures S26 and S27). DFT results in Figure 5d (see details in Figure S28) show that the [ZnO]3 structure requires a larger formation energy with Cu modification (+0.33 eV) than the case without Cu (0.11 eV), well explaining the experimental observation that Cu promotes the Zn dispersion.

In situ C3H8-DRIFT spectra were recorded to investigate propane activation on parent ZnO@S-1 and optimized CuZnO@S-1. Figure 6a shows that the methyl bands at 1369 cm1 (i.e., CH3 groups in propane) diminish earlier than methylene bands at 1456 cm1 (i.e., CH2 groups in propane), revealing that the PDH reaction is initiated with the cleavage of methyl CH bonds. Moreover, the bands related to ZnC3H7* and ZnC3H6* species, as one key intermediate in PDH reaction, appear earlier in CuZnO@S-1 than in parent ZnO@S-1. The temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) profiles show, for CuZnO@S-1, that the C3H6 formation begins at 108.5 C and reaches the maximum at 331.7 C (Figure 6b), which is lower than the related temperatures for ZnO@S-1 (125.4 and 360.7 C). The results confirm that propane activation more readily occurs on CuZnO@S-1, which is consistent with its lowest experimental activation enthalpies based on EyringPolanyi plots (32) (Figure S30). The reaction orders were analyzed to further investigate the reaction kinetics. The propane reaction orders remain almost constant (about 0.25) for investigated catalysts (Figure S31), while the hydrogen reaction orders (n[H2]) differ greatly (Figure 6c). Basically, the catalysts with the first dehydrogenation (1st dehy.) step as the rate-determining step (RDS) should exhibit n[H2] close to zero, while the cases with 2nd dehy. step as RDS would exhibit n[H2] close to 0.5. (33,34) Considering that CuZnO@S-1 possesses a higher amount of [ZnH]+ (arising from more [ZnOH]+ species) and exhibits the most negative n[H2] value, one can infer that the 2nd dehy. step should act as the RDS for [ZnH]+ site. In comparsion, the less negative n[H2] for BZnO@S-1 and parent ZnO@S-1 is because they contain considerable ZnOx clusters, on which the 1st dehy. step acts as RDS.

The molecular PDH mechanism on various Zn sites was investigated through DFT calculations. The possibility of direct participation of H from [ZnH]+ in C3H8 activation was first ruled out (Figure S32). The direct and indirect PDH reaction pathways were also evaluated (Figure S33). As illustrated in Figure 7a, the unique Cu-modified [ZnH]+ site favors the direct PDH pathway, which effectively promotes the production of propylene and H2 compared to indirect pathways on [ZnO]3 and [ZnH]+ sites. As a result, the temperatures for reaching maximum propylene production and H2 production are comparable in CuZnO@S-1, while for parent ZnO@S-1, the H2 production has an obvious lag after propylene formation (Figure 6b). Figure 7b displays the full PDH reaction enthalpy diagrams of preferred routes (see corresponding structural models in Figure S34 and thermal correction to enthalpies in Tables S9 and S10). (35) The first dehydrogenation (1st dehy.) step over [ZnO]3 site would produce the n-propyl bonded with two-coordinated Zn (Zn2c) atom and the dissociated H* on the O2c site. This process is exothermic by 0.40 eV with an activation enthalpy barrier (ΔHapp) of 2.33 eV. The next dehydrogenation (2nd dehy.) step would produce a Zn(H*)(C3H7*)O(H*) configuration, which is endothermic by 0.92 eV with a ΔHapp of 1.49 eV. The following H2 formation involves a H* transfer step (ΔH = 0.16 eV) and the H2 coupling step (ΔH = 0.04 eV, ΔHapp = 1.61 eV). For the PDH reaction over [ZnH]+ site. The 1st dehy. step would produce C3H7* and H* species bonded with Zn3c and O2c site, which requires a lower ΔHapp of 1.43 eV (vs 2.33 eV on [ZnO]3). The decreased activation enthalpy barrier is because the electron transfer from Zn to H in [ZnH]+ site decreases the electron density of Zn sites (Figure 7c,d), which improves the Lewis acidity (Figure S35 and Table S11), therefore promoting the stabilization of C3H7* intermediates as revealed by Crystal Orbital Hamilton Populations analysis (COHP, Figure 7e, the more negative ICOHP value represents a stronger interaction (36)).

Moreover, we construct the Cu-modified [ZnH]+ model (Cu...[ZnH]+) to investigate whether adjacent Cu can affect the intrinsic activity of [ZnH]+ site. Figure 7b shows, compared to [ZnO]3, that the Cu...[ZnH]+ site also promotes the 1st dehy. step with a ΔHapp of 1.78 eV. For the 2nd dehy. step, the Cu...[ZnH]+ site enables the direct pathway that C3H7* attacks the OH group to directly produce C3H6* and a H2 molecule, which reduce the ΔHapp to 1.45 eV (vs 2.46 eV on [ZnH]+ site). The changed mechanism may be because Cu additives can reduce the electron density of O atoms adjacent [ZnH]+ site (Figure 7c), weakening the interactions between the first dehydrogenated H* and catalyst (also verified by COHP analysis in Figure 7e). The direct PDH pathway for Cu...[ZnH]+ sites effectively promote the 2nd dehy. step and H2 production, which is the RDS for zinc hydride sites in the PDH reaction (Figure S36). Therefore, the Cu...[ZnH]+ site exhibits the lowest overall PDH barrier (Figure S37), which contributes to the optimal activity of CuZnO@S-1.

In summary, this work describes a nonprecious and nontoxic CuZnO@S-1 catalyst for PDH. The catalyst enables appealing catalytic performance with 43% propane conversion and 88% propylene selectivity under simulated industrial conditions, which is close to the thermodynamical limitation. This high activity is attributed to the higher [ZnOH]+ amount helps produce more electron-deficient [ZnH]+ species to promote the first dehydrogenation, and the Cu-modified [ZnH]+ site favors the direct PDH pathway to facilitate the second dehydrogenation and H2 formation. This work provides new insights for understanding the unique role of metal hydrides in alkane activation.

Catalyst Preparation
ZnO@silicalite-1 (ZnO@S-1) was synthesized via a ligand-assisted crystallization approach (Scheme S1). TPAOH aqueous solution (13 g, 25 wt %), deionized water (15 g), TEOS (8.32 g), and zinc acetylacetonate (0.4 g) were mixed and stirred continuously for 6 h. The resulting mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was heated to and kept at 170 C for 3 days. The solid product was collected, washed, and dried at 80 C for 12 h, followed by calcination at 550 C for 6 h. The preparation of ZnO@S-1 was modified by adding 0.4 mmol of the acetylacetonate salt of the metal M to the zeolite precursor mixture to yield MZnO@S-1. The exception was the synthesis of BZnO@S-1, which comprised the use of boric acid as a boron source. Reference materials included ZnO loaded on porous materials (dealuminated β zeolite, HZSM-5, mesoporous MCM-41, commercial SiO2). All of these materials were prepared by conventional impregnation methods followed by calcination, and the detailed preparation procedure is provided in the Supporting Information. We also prepared MOx@S-1 catalysts (M represents various base metals) via the same ligand-assisted crystallization approach (detailed procedure in the Supporting Information).
Catalyst Characterization
The crystallinity and phase structure of all of the samples were recorded by powder X-ray diffraction (D8 ADVANCE) with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Raman spectra were recorded on a Renishaw inVia instrument with the 325 nm laser under ambient conditions. N2 physisorption isotherms of catalysts were measured at 196 C using a Micromeritics TriStar-II 3020 instrument. The catalysts were degassed in vacuum at 250 C for 3 h prior to measurements. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (E = 1486.6 eV). The binding energies were corrected to the C 1s core level of adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV.

Catalytic Activity Evaluation
The catalytic PDH performance was evaluated at 600 C under ambient pressure. Granular catalyst (0.15 g, 4060 mesh) was loaded inside a quartz tubular reactor. Prior to the PDH reaction, the catalyst was reduced in 40% H2/N2 (14 mL/min) at 600 C for 1 h. The reaction was started by switching the reduction flow to the reaction mixture containing C3H8 and H2 (67:33 vol %) at a total flow rate of 9 mL/min. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was 4.7 h1. Mass transport limitations were ruled out on the basis of the MadonBoudart test (Figure S38) and the WeiszParter, Mears criterion. The carbon balance was >90% for the catalytic PDH experiments (Figure S39). Coke was not accounted when reporting the propylene selectivity due to low coke selectivity. A 70 h stability test was performed at 550 C using 0.2 g of a catalyst and a reaction mixture of C3H8:H2:N2 = 6:3:6 (vol %) at a total flow rate of 15 mL/min. To evaluate catalyst regenerability, the catalyst used for 6 h in the PDH reaction was calcined in air (30 mL/min) at 500 C for 2 h to remove the coke deposit. The effluent products from the PDH reaction were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-9890 B). The propane conversion (CC3H8) and propylene selectivity (SC3H6) were calculated using eqs 1 and 2, respectively.

The space-time yield of propylene was defined as the number of moles of C3H6 formed per g catalyst per hour using eq 3
(3)
Catalytic stability was evaluated by the deactivation rate constant (kd, h1) based on a first-order deactivation model
(4)
Here, CC3H8,F and CC3H8,I are the final and initial C3H8 conversions of the PDH reaction, respectively, and t is the time on stream (typically, 6 h).
Computational Method
All density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out within the Vienna ab initio simulation program package (37) (VASP 5.4.4) using the GGA-PBE electron exchangecorrelation functional. The cutoff energy was set to 400 eV, and the Brillouin zone sampling was γ point. Geometry optimization was carried out with the force criterion <0.05 eV/Å. The atoms in the unit cell were allowed to relax, while the lattice constants were kept fixed. The transition states were examined using the climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method. (38)
A Si96O192 model was used to model silicalite-1 zeolite. One Si defect at the intersection between straight and sinusoidal ring channels was constructed to provide an anchor site for Zn species. Four proton H atoms (i.e., SiOH groups) were introduced to balance the charge. Based on XAFS results, a trinuclear [ZnO]3 model was used to simulate the ZnOx clusters, which were identified in parent ZnO@S-1. On the other hand, one Zn atom was coordinated with two SiOH groups to simulate the isolated [ZnOH]+ site. One H atom in the SiOH group was replaced by a Cu atom to simulate the Cu-modified [ZnOH]+ site (Cu...[ZnOH]+). The optimized models including [ZnO]3, [ZnOH]+, and Cu...[ZnOH]+ are shown in Figure S40. The ZnO and ZnZn coordination numbers for the [ZnO]3 model are 3 and 2, while those for [ZnOH]+ and Cu...[ZnOH]+ models are 4 and 0, respectively. The average ZnO bond length and ZnZn bond length in the [ZnO]3 model are 1.87 and 2.90 Å, while the average ZnO bond lengths in [ZnOH]+ and Cu...[ZnOH]+ models are 1.98 and 1.97 Å, respectively. The average CuO bond length is 1.97 Å in the Cu...[ZnOH]+ model. These results are consistent with the EXAFS fitting results, revealing the rationality of constructed models. The stability of these models was further verified by no significant distortion of geometric structure in ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations (Figure S41). A total of 10 ps AIMD simulation with the NVT ensemble was performed using the CP2K package. (39) The temperature was set at 800 K, and the time step was set as 0.5 fs. The microkinetic simulations were carried out using the MKMCXX program. (40)
The [ZnH]+ specie is produced through the H2 dissociation on the [ZnOH]+ site with the release of one H2O molecule. The reaction can be described as
