To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the answers from each file to the correct answers file on a per-question basis. I looked for semantic equivalence between the answers rather than exact word-for-word matching. For questions with no relevant quotes provided, I checked if the answer stated there was no evaluation of that topic in the article.

Some answers had partial information reflecting the quotes provided, so I used my best judgment to assign % consistency scores. Overall this provides a high-level measure of how consistent each answer set is with the correct answers. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
