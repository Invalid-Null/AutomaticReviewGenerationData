[1] "In situ DRIFTS measurements were performed to investigate the changes in the Zn speciation during the induction period."

[2] "Figure 2b shows that the intensity of the ZnOH hydroxyl band (13) at 3635 cm1 decreases with increasing temperature during exposure to propane." 

[3] "Together with the erosion of the 3635 cm1 band, a band at 1844 cm1 appears, which can be attributed to the formation of [ZnH]+ (Zn-hydride) species."

[1] "Figure 5a shows that the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of Zn K-edge for tested samples exhibit similar shape and position of absorption edge with standard ZnO, indicating that Zn mainly exists in the form of oxidation state rather than metallic state." 

[2] "Notably, the Zn k-absorption peak in H2-treated Cu-ZnO@S-1 exhibits a pronounced low-energy shift compared to the fresh one. This observation was because the [ZnOH]+-to-[ZnH]+ transformation leads to decreased Zn oxidation state, which is consistent with the Bader charge analysis (Figure S23)."

<English version answer>

6. Yes, the article uses XANES to probe oxidation state changes in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it shows Zn K-edge XANES reveals a decrease in Zn oxidation state after H2 treatment due to the transformation from ZnOH to ZnH species. This confirms the role of ZnH sites in enhancing catalyst performance.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

6. 是的,这篇文章使用XANES技术探究了丙烷脱氢反应催化剂中的氧化态变化。具体来说,Zn K边XANES谱显示,H2处理后Zn的氧化态降低,这是由于ZnOH向ZnH物种的转变造成的。这证实了ZnH位点在提高催化剂性能中的作用。
