<quotes>

[1] "Suitable non-precious-metal catalysts for PDH should contain coordinatively unsaturated sites (Mcus) that can lower dehydrogenation barriers by stabilizing dehydrogenated intermediates." 

[2] "The metal atoms in hydrides exhibit a lower electron density than the corresponding metal in oxides, which stabilizes the propyl fragment upon dissociative adsorption of propane."

[3] "Zeolites can stabilize Mcus sites due to the confinement effect of their microporous channels, and in this way, also stabilize the formation of MHx species."

2. Yes, the article explains how catalysts facilitate PDH by lowering activation barriers through stabilization of intermediates. It states catalysts should contain unsaturated metal sites that can stabilize dehydrogenated intermediates. Also, metal hydrides have lower electron density than metal oxides, better stabilizing propyl fragments from propane. Zeolites can further stabilize the unsaturated metal and metal hydride sites in their micropores.
