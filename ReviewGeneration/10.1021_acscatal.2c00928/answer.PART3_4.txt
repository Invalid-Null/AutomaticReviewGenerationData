1. Specifically, the combination of CuZnO@S-1 exhibits the best catalytic performance with propane conversion and propylene selectivity of 43 and 88%, respectively, which are close to the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion under given conditions

2. Zn is selected based on its outstanding performance among base metals according to the literature  and our own screening efforts.

3. No relevant quotes

4. Figure 2b shows that the intensity of the ZnOH hydroxyl band at 3635 cm−1 decreases with increasing temperature during exposure to propane. Together with the erosion of the 3635 cm−1 band, a band at 1844 cm−1 appears, which can be attributed to the formation of [ZnH]+ (Zn-hydride) species.

5. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM ARM-200F microscope.

6. Specifically, Figure 5a shows that the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of Zn K-edge for tested samples exhibit similar shape and position of absorption edge with standard ZnO, indicating that Zn mainly exists in the form of oxidation state rather than metallic state.

1. The article describes techniques like ligand-assisted crystallization to synthesize isolated single metal sites in silicalite-1 zeolite supports. CuZnO@S-1 made this way showed the best catalytic performance.  

2. The article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports.

3. The article investigates preparation methods like impregnation and ligand-assisted crystallization aimed at optimizing zinc dispersion. CuZnO@S-1 made by ligand-assisted crystallization showed the best dispersion.

4. The article utilizes in-situ DRIFTS to study propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It showed the in-situ transformation from zinc hydroxides to zinc hydride species during catalysis.

5. The article used aberration-corrected STEM to characterize metal-support interfaces. It showed highly dispersed and isolated zinc species in CuZnO@S-1.

6. The article used XANES to probe oxidation state changes during catalysis. It showed zinc mainly exists as Zn(II) rather than metallic Zn.

7. The article does not evaluate different reactor types.
