[1] Herein, we found zinc hydrides ([ZnH]+) as the highly reactive site for PDH. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that [ZnH]+ was transformed from zinc hydroxyl ([ZnOH]+) sites under reductive conditions.

[2] The optimized CuZnO@S-1 consists of exclusively isolated [ZnOH]+ sites, which help produce more [ZnH]+ toward optimal PDH activity. Specifically, the catalyst enables 43% propane conversion with >88% propylene selectivity, close to the thermodynamic equilibrium. 

[3] Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of ZnO@S-1 exhibit peaks at 1.52 and 3.05 Å (Figure 5b), which are attributed to the first ZnO shell and second ZnOZn shell coordination, respectively. (12,14) On the contrary, only one peak at 1.50 Å was identified for CuZnO@S-1, confirming that Cu can promote the formation of isolated Zn sites.

[4] Notably, the Zn k-absorption peak in CuZnO@S-1 shifts to lower energy than parent ZnO@S-1, revealing a slight decrease in the Zn oxidation state with Cu modification. (14) 

[5] In situ DRIFTS measurements were performed to investigate the changes in the Zn speciation during the induction period. Figure 2b shows that the intensity of the ZnOH hydroxyl band (13) at 3635 cm−1 decreases with increasing temperature during exposure to propane. Together with the erosion of the 3635 cm−1 band, a band at 1844 cm−1 appears, which can be attributed to the formation of [ZnH]+ (Zn-hydride) species. (21,22) The spectra point to the in situ transformation from zinc hydroxides ([ZnOH]+) to [ZnH]+ species during the PDH reaction, which was related to the observed induction periods in panel (a).

<English version answer>

1. Yes, the article describes using additives like Cu to promote the formation of isolated Zn sites in the silicalite-1 zeolite support, as evidenced by EXAFS data in Quote [3]. The CuZnO@S-1 catalyst specifically contains exclusively isolated Zn sites.

2. No, the article does not evaluate metal encapsulation for enhancing stability.

3. Yes, the article investigates using Cu additives to optimize Zn dispersion in the zeolite, producing isolated Zn sites rather than ZnO clusters, as shown in Quote [3].  

4. Yes, the article uses in situ DRIFTS to study the working PDH catalysts, as described in Quote [5]. This reveals the in situ transformation of ZnOH species to active ZnH species.

5. Yes, the article uses aberration-corrected STEM imaging to characterize the Cu-Zn interface and isolate nature of Zn sites, as mentioned in Quote [3].

6. Yes, XANES data in Quote [4] reveals changes in Zn oxidation state during PDH catalysis due to transformations between ZnOH and ZnH species.

7. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types. It studies a fixed bed reactor setup.

2. 否,文章没有评估金属封装来增强稳定性。

3. 是的,文章研究了使用Cu添加剂来优化沸石中Zn的分散度,产生隔离的Zn位点而不是ZnO簇,如引用[3]所示。

4. 是的,文章使用原位DRIFTS研究工作中的PDH催化剂,如引用[5]所述。这揭示了ZnOH物种到活性ZnH物种的原位转变。

5. 是的,文章使用球差更正STEM成像来表征Cu-Zn界面的隔离性质,如引用[3]中提到的。

6. 是的,XANES数据在引用[4]中揭示了ZnH和ZnOH物种之间转变过程中的Zn氧化态变化。

7. 否,文章没有评估不同的反应器类型。它研究了固定床反应器设置。
