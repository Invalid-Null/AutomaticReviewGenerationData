[1] "ZnO@silicalite-1 (ZnO@S-1) was synthesized via a ligand-assisted crystallization approach."

[2] "The optimized ZnO@S-1 exhibits a propane conversion of 31.4% with a propylene selectivity of 93.9%, which is superior to ZnO_EDA@S-1, ZnO/DeAl-β, ZnO/HZSM-5, etc."

[3] "In situ spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that [ZnH]+ was transformed from zinc hydroxyl ([ZnOH]+) sites under reductive conditions." 

[4] "Accordingly, the formation of [ZnH]+ can be controlled by adjusting the amount of zinc hydroxyl ([ZnOH]+) species by various additives."

[5] "The optimized CuZnO@S-1 consists of exclusively isolated [ZnOH]+ sites, which help produce more [ZnH]+ toward optimal PDH activity."

3. The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It synthesizes ZnO@S-1 via a ligand-assisted crystallization approach and finds this material has superior propane conversion compared to other ZnO zeolites. It also shows that Cu addition helps isolate [ZnOH]+ sites and transform them to active [ZnH]+ sites under reducing conditions, optimizing PDH activity.

[1] "In situ DRIFTS measurements were performed to investigate the changes in the Zn speciation during the induction period."

[2] "Figure 2b shows that the intensity of the ZnOH hydroxyl band (13) at 3635 cm−1 decreases with increasing temperature during exposure to propane. Together with the erosion of the 3635 cm−1 band, a band at 1844 cm−1 appears, which can be attributed to the formation of [ZnH]+ (Zn-hydride) species."

[3] "The HD exchange DRIFT spectra in Figure 2e show that [ZnH]+-related bands at 1843 cm−1 decrease upon D2 treatment, while new bands around 1638 and 1371 cm−1 appear. The latter two bands are attributed to the HD and [ZnD]+ species, which are formed by HD exchange reactions between D2 and [ZnH]+ species."

[1] "Figure 5a shows that the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of Zn K-edge for tested samples exhibit similar shape and position of absorption edge with standard ZnO, indicating that Zn mainly exists in the form of oxidation state rather than metallic state."

[2] "The XANES spectra in Figure 5a,b evidence the highly isolated Zn sites in CuZnO@S-1, while partial ZnOZn coordination related to ZnOx clusters was observed in parent ZnO@S-1."

[3] "Figure 5b further reveals the Zn LMM peaks in reduced catalysts all shift toward lower kinetic energies compared to its original position in fresh catalysts, which can be attributed to the [ZnOH]+-to-[ZnH]+ transformation."
