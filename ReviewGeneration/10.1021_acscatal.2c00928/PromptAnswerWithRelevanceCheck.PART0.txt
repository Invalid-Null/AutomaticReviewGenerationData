 Here are the relevant quotes and answers:

<quotes>

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is promising for producing high value-added propylene."

[2] "The growing availability of propane from shale gas and the increasing global demand for propylene have led to the development of technologies for on-purpose propylene manufacture."

[3] "PDH is a commercial process that yields propylene with high selectivity."

[4] "Propylene is used to produce important chemicals like polypropylene."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

1. Yes, the article provides background on the importance of propylene production through PDH. It states PDH produces high value propylene, which is in increasing demand globally. Propylene is used to manufacture important chemicals like polypropylene.  

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "Suitable non-precious-metal catalysts for PDH should contain coordinatively unsaturated sites (Mcus) that can lower dehydrogenation barriers by stabilizing dehydrogenated intermediates." 

[2] "The metal atoms in hydrides exhibit a lower electron density than the corresponding metal in oxides, which stabilizes the propyl fragment upon dissociative adsorption of propane."

[3] "Zeolites can stabilize Mcus sites due to the confinement effect of their microporous channels, and in this way, also stabilize the formation of MHx species."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article explains how catalysts facilitate PDH by lowering activation barriers through stabilization of intermediates. It states catalysts should contain unsaturated metal sites that can stabilize dehydrogenated intermediates. Also, metal hydrides have lower electron density than metal oxides, better stabilizing propyl fragments from propane. Zeolites can further stabilize the unsaturated metal and metal hydride sites in their micropores.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

2. 是的,该文阐述了催化剂如何通过稳定中间体降低激活栏垒促进PDH。它指出催化剂应包含可以稳定去氢中间体的非饱和金属位点。此外,金属氢化物比金属氧化物具有更低的电子密度,可以更好地稳定丙烷的丙基片段。分子筛可以进一步稳定其微孔中的不饱和金属和金属氢化物位点。

[1] "Figure 7b displays the full PDH reaction enthalpy diagrams of preferred routes (see corresponding structural models in Figure S34 and thermal correction to enthalpies in Tables S9 and S10)."

[2] "The results indicate that CuZnO@S-1 exhibits the largest 384 C-related H2 consumption (Figure S21 and Table S6), which is consistent with its highest intensity of the [ZnOH]+ IR-band (Figure 4d)." 

[3] "Moreover, Figure 4e shows that a good linear relationship exists between zinc hydroxyl IR-band area and propane conversion."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

7. The article describes DFT-calculated reaction enthalpy diagrams correlating Zn site structure to propane dehydrogenation activity. Experimental results also reveal a linear correlation between Zn-OH intensity and propane conversion over different catalysts. This indicates Zn-OH amount helps determine ZnH amount and resulting PDH activity.
