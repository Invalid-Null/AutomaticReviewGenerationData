[1] "In situ DRIFTS measurements were performed to investigate the changes in the Zn speciation during the induction period." 

[2] "Figure 2b shows that the intensity of the ZnOH hydroxyl band (13) at 3635 cm−1 decreases with increasing temperature during exposure to propane. Together with the erosion of the 3635 cm−1 band, a band at 1844 cm−1 appears, which can be attributed to the formation of [ZnH]+ (Zn-hydride) species."

[3] "The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of Zn K-edge for tested samples exhibit similar shape and position of absorption edge with standard ZnO, indicating that Zn mainly exists in the form of oxidation state rather than metallic state."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ DRIFTS and XANES to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows that ZnOH species transform to ZnH species during the reaction through in-situ DRIFTS. XANES reveals that Zn mainly exists in oxidized state rather than metallic state during the reaction.

[1] "Figure 5a shows that the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of Zn K-edge for tested samples exhibit similar shape and position of absorption edge with standard ZnO, indicating that Zn mainly exists in the form of oxidation state rather than metallic state."

[2] "The position of the Zn K-absorption peak in CuZnO@S-1 shifts to lower energy than parent ZnO@S-1, revealing a slight decrease in the Zn oxidation state with Cu modification."

[3] "Notably, the Zn k-absorption peak in H2-treated Cu-ZnO@S-1 exhibits a pronounced low-energy shift compared to the fresh one. This observation was because the [ZnOH]+-to-[ZnH]+ transformation leads to decreased Zn oxidation state."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
6. Yes, the article uses XANES to probe oxidation state changes of Zn during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows that Zn mainly exists in oxidized state rather than metallic state. The Cu modification and H2 reduction treatment cause decreased Zn oxidation state due to the transformation from ZnOH to ZnH species.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
6. 是的,这篇文章使用XANES技术探测Zn在丙烷脱氢反应催化过程中的氧化态变化。它表明Zn主要以氧化态而不是金属态存在。Cu改性和H2还原处理由于ZnOH向ZnH物种的转化导致Zn氧化态降低。
