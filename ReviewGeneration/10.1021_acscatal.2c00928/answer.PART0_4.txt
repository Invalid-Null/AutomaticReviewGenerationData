[1] "The molecular PDH mechanism on various Zn sites was investigated through DFT calculations."

[2] "As illustrated in Figure 7a, the unique Cu-modified [ZnH]+ site favors the direct PDH pathway, which effectively promotes the production of propylene and H2 compared to indirect pathways on [ZnO]3 and [ZnH]+ sites."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

5. The article describes how DFT calculations have been applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways over different Zn sites. It is found that Cu-modified ZnH sites favor the direct PDH pathway, promoting propylene and H2 production compared to indirect pathways on other Zn sites.

[1] "Figure 7b displays the full PDH reaction enthalpy diagrams of preferred routes (see corresponding structural models in Figure S34 and thermal correction to enthalpies in Tables S9 and S10)."

[2] "The results indicate that CuZnO@S-1 exhibits the largest 384 C-related H2 consumption (Figure S21 and Table S6), which is consistent with its highest intensity of the [ZnOH]+ IR-band (Figure 4d)." 

[3] "Moreover, Figure 4e shows that a good linear relationship exists between zinc hydroxyl IR-band area and propane conversion."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

7. The article describes DFT-calculated reaction enthalpy diagrams correlating Zn site structure to propane dehydrogenation activity. Experimental results also reveal a linear correlation between Zn-OH intensity and propane conversion over different catalysts. This indicates Zn-OH amount helps determine ZnH amount and resulting PDH activity.
