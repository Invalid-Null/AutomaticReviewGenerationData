I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

Abstract
Isotopically labeled reactants (D2 and C3D8) were used in order to probe H2S formation pathways during thiophene desulfurization on Co/H-ZSM5 at 773 K using H2 or propane as co-reactants. With D2/C4H4S or C3D8/C4H4S reactants, both D and H were present in the hydrogen sulfide formed, suggesting that desulfurization can occur via both direct thiophene decomposition with intramolecular hydrogen transfer and deuterium addition from D2 or C3D8. Thiophene, however, becomes readily deuterated via rapid exchange with D-containing intermediates formed from D2 or C3D8, suggesting that thiophene protonation-deprotonation steps are fast. These isotopic equilibration processes prevent a definitive assessment of the contributions of these two pathways to hydrogen sulfide formation. The D-content in hydrogen sulfide and in hydrocarbons are higher with C3D8/C4H4S than with D2/C4H4S reactants, indicating that propane is more effective than dihydrogen as a source of hydrogen for desulfurization reaction. C3H8/C4H4S and C3D8/C4H4S reactants gave similar reactions rates for hydrocarbon formation, suggesting that CH bond activation steps do not limit hydrocarbon formation rates. A normal kinetic isotope effect was observed for thiophene desulfurization, indicating that the abstraction of fragments from propane-derived intermediates for reactions with thiophene is more difficult for deuterated intermediates. A comparison of thiophene desulfurization rates with C3H8/D2/C4H4S, C3H8/C4H4S, and D2/C4H4S mixtures confirmed that propane is a more effective source of hydrogen than H2. The deuterium content in all products formed from C3H8/D2/C4H4S mixtures was lower than in products formed from C3H8/D2 reactants. These findings suggest that thiophene inhibits the hydrogen adsorptiondesorption steps responsible for the incorporation of D-atoms into adsorbed intermediates from D2 and for the desorption of dihydrogen during propane reactions.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
