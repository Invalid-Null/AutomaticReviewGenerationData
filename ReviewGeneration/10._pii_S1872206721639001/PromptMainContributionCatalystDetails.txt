Promoting propane dehydrogenation with CO2 over Ga2O3/SiO2 by eliminating Ga-hydrides

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872206721639001

AbstractAbstract
Due to the shortage supply of propylene and the development of shale gas, there is increased interest in on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production. Ga-based catalysts have great potential in PDH, due to the high activity, low carbon deposit and deactivation. Ga-hydrides formed during PDH reduce the rate, selectivity and yield of propylene. In this contribution, CO2 is introduced into PDH as a soft oxidant to eliminate the unfavorable intermediate species Gaδ+-Hx re-generating Ga3+-O pairs, and also minimize coke deposition thereby improving the catalytic performance. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy experiments show that CO2 can effectively eliminate Gaδ+-Hx. At different temperatures, co-feeding CO2 during PDH over Ga2O3/SiO2 catalysts with different loadings significantly improves the stability of the conversion and selectivity, especially the latter, and provide a new dimension for improving the performance of PDH process.

1. Introduction
Propylene is the second most utilized building block of the petrochemical industry after ethylene and is used for the synthesis of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylic, etc. Propylene is mainly produced by naphtha steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking [1]. However, crackers have been converted from naphtha to ethane units, with ethane feedstocks predominantly producing ethylene, thereby reducing propylene production. At the same time, the demand for propylene has gradually increased, resulting in a shortage of propylene supply. With the development of shale gas, there is increasing interest in on-purpose technologies for propylene production, such as catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [2, 3].
Currently, PtSn/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are commercially used, but challenges still exist, including insufficient C3H6 selectivity and deactivation caused by carbon deposition [1, 4]. A number of metal oxides, such as Ga2O3 [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], ZnO [11, 12, 13], VOx [14, 15, 16, 17], MoOx [18], are also active for the PDH. Ga-based catalysts have great potential in PDH, due to the low carbon deposition and high activity. Xu et al. [9] reported that the propylene selectivity can reach 74% at propane conversion of 39% over Ga2O3/ZrO2. Szeto et al. [8] have found that the mononuclear alumina-supported Ga sites also show promising activity and high selectivity toward propylene at 550 °C.
In recent years, Ga-based catalysts have attracted more attention. SiO2 supported well-defined Ga(III) single-site catalysts have been developed, which show higher activity and selectivity towards propylene compared with other single-site catalysts based on Fe, Co, and Zn [11] [19, 20, 21, 22]. There have also been many studies on the active sites of Ga-based catalysts. Getsoian et al. [23] suggested that features previously assigned to Ga+ in XANES may also be interpreted as low-coordinate Ga3+-Hx or Ga3+-Rx species on Ga-impregnated zeolites and SiO2-supported single-site catalysts. Cybulskis et al. [24] investigated the nature of active sites for PDH on single-site Ga/SiO2, and showed that Ga3+ alkyl and hydride intermediates have a great influence on PDH performance. Only four coordinate, single-site Ga3+-O species can cleave the C–H bonds of C3H8. The less stable Gaδ+-Hx species is formed under high temperature H2 treatment, and the rate of its transformation to Ga3+-O can affect the rate of propane dehydrogenation. Rane et al. [25] studied the PDH activity of Ga+ and GaO+ in zeolite ZSM-5, and showed that the monovalent Ga+ species are more active than GaH2+ species, and compared with these cations, GaO+ cations are the most active. Phadke et al. [26] investigated mechanism of PDH over Ga/H-MFI, and reported that [GaH]2+ cations are the catalytically active centers for PDH and H2 inhibits the dehydrogenation by reaction with [GaH]2+ cations to from [GaH2]+-H+ cation pairs.
Due to its promotional effect, CO2 has been extensively used as a mild oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. CO2 can alleviate the chemical equilibrium in oxidative dehydrogenation by the effective removal of H2 through coupling with reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Compared with O2, CO2 suppresses the unwanted total oxidation products due to its lower oxidizing ability. CO2 can also modify the surface and/or bulk composition of the catalyst, thereby affecting the structural, electronic, acid-base, adsorption, diffusion, and redox characteristics [27]. We speculate that the addition of CO2 in PDH may accelerate the transformation of Gaδ+-Hx species to Ga3+-O pairs to re-generate the active sites for C–H bond activation of propane, thus improving the catalytic performance. Meanwhile, the introduction of CO2 induces the change of the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of propane dehydrogenation. Without CO2, ΔG is 8.3 kJ/mol (600 °C), while it is 15.3 kJ/mol (600 °C) after the introduction of one molar equivlent of CO2. In this work, the role of Ga-hydrides in the PDH of supported gallium oxide is studied using in situ DRIFT, and the results show the effectiveness of CO2 to eliminate Ga-hydrides. With the introduction of CO2, the dehydrogenation performance was indeed improved, especially the propylene selectivity. This work provides an effective way to improve the dehydrogenation performance of Ga2O3/SiO2 catalysts, and also provides insight into the catalytically active centers.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The Ga2O3/SiO2 catalysts with different Ga loadings were synthesized by pH-controlled incipient wetness impregnation (pH-IWI). To prepare 3Ga2O3/SiO2, 1.5 g of Ga(NO3)3·xH2O (Aladdin) and 3.0 g of citric acid (Tian Da Corp.) were dissolved in 3.0 mL of deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 11 by adding 25% ammonium hydroxide solution (DAMAO), and the volume was adjusted to 17 mL by adding deionized water. The solution was then added dropwise to 10.0 g of silica (Aladdin, 406 m2/g) with continuous stirring. The mixture was dried overnight in an oven at 110 °C and calcined in air at 600 °C for 3 h. The impregnation was repeated twice to prepare 5Ga2O3/SiO2, three times for 8Ga2O3/SiO2 and four times for 10Ga2O3/SiO2. The final Ga loading was measured by using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES).
Ga2O3 was synthesized by calcining Ga(NO3)3·xH2O (Aladdin) in air at 600 °C for 3 h.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a Rigaku SmartLab 9kw diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) with 0.02° step size over the range between 5° and 80°.
Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on SDT Q600 (TA Instruments, USA). The samples were preheated to 100 °C and kept for 10 min in air with a flow rate of 30 mL/min, and then heated to 800 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min.
The textural properties of the samples were determined by N2 adsorption-desorption on a Quantachrome AUTO-SORB-1-MP sorption analyzer at liquid nitrogen temperature (−196 °C). The specific surface area was determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Prior to the measurements, the catalysts were degassed at 300 °C for 6 h.
High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) imaging was conducted to observe the carbon deposition on the catalysts, and were taken on a Tecnai F30 HRTEM instrument (FEI Corp.) operated at 300 kV. The samples for TEM analysis were prepared by dropping ethanol suspension of samples on the carbon film-coated copper grids.
In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra were collected on a Thermo Nicolet iS50 spectrometer with a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector cooled by liquid nitrogen. The outlet gas of the in situ cell were analyzed by a Mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer). Typically, the sample was heated to 600 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min under N2, and the background was collected at 400 °C. The sample was then exposed to 50 vol% H2/N2 at 600 °C for 1 h. N2 or 5 vol% CO2/N2 or 20 vol% CO2/N2 was fed in to explore the effect of CO2. The spectra were collected at 400 °C. In order to detect whether there is CO in the product after adding CO2 by mass spectrometry (MS), N2 and 20 vol% CO2/N2 were replaced with Ar and 20 vol% CO2/Ar respectively to repeat the above experiments. To monitor the formation of Ga-hydrides and their changes in propane dehydrogenation, the sample was heated to 650 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min under N2, and the background was collected at 550 °C. Then, the sample was kept at 650 °C under 50 vol% H2/N2 for 1 h. The sample was cooled to 550 °C and purged with N2 for 5 min to remove residual H2, then 5 vol% C3H8/N2 was introduced. The spectra were collected at 550 °C. To investigate the adsorption of CO2 and C3H8 on Ga2O3/SiO2, the sample was heated to 600 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min under N2, then cooled to room temperature. The background spectra were collected at different temperatures. The sample was kept at 25 °C under 20 vol% C3H8/N2 (or 20 vol% CO2/N2) for 10 min, then purged with N2 for 15 min. Subsequently. The sample was heated to desorb C3H8 (or CO2) chemically absorbed on Ga2O3/SiO2.
2.3. Catalytic testing
The propane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3/SiO2 catalysts were carried out under 0.05 MPa (gauge pressure) in a fixed-bed quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm. The flow rate of the feed gas was controlled using a mass flow controller (Brooks 5850E). The reactor was heated by a Micrometrics Eurotherm 2416 furnace while the catalyst bed temperature was monitored using a K-type thermo-couple located at the center of the catalyst bed. The gas products were analyzed using an online Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph.
Typically, 1.0 g of the sample was heated up to 600 or 627 °C (900 K) with a ramp rate of 5 °C/min under N2 at 50 mL/min. The reactant gas (5 vol% C3H8/N2 at 50 mL/min, CO2 and N2 at 15 mL/min totally) was then continuously fed into the reactor, the ratio of CO2 and C3H8 can be adjusted by changing the flow rate of fed CO2. To calculate the TOF of Ga2O3/SiO2, the mass of the samples was reduced to 0.2–0.3 g to reduce the conversion, then repeat the above experiments.
In order to study the effect of Ga-hydrides on C3H8 dehydrogenation, 0.2 g of 8Ga2O3/SiO2 was pretreated in H2 (20 mL/min) at 650 °C for 1 h, and then purged with N2 for 15 min at 20 mL/min to remove residual gas-phase H2 and physically adsorbed H2. Afterwards, it was cooled to 550 °C for propane dehydrogenation. The reactant gas (5 vol% C3H8/N2 at 50 mL/min, N2 at 15 mL/min) was then continuously fed into the reactor.
The catalytic performance was evaluated by the conversion of C3H8 and the selectivity of C3H6. The conversion of C3H8 is defined as
The selectivity of C3H6 is defined as

3. Result and discussion
3.1. The effect of Ga-hydrides on C3H8 dehydrogenation
PDH was firstly carried out on the SiO2 support to investigate gas-phase thermal cracking and SiO2-induced dehydrogenation reactions, and experimental results show the contribution of these side reactions are negligible at 600 °C. The Ga2O3/SiO2 catalysts with different loadings were prepared and evaluated. As shown in Fig. 1(a), there is no obvious diffraction peak of Ga species in the XRD patterns of Ga2O3/SiO2, which indicates that Ga2O3 is highly dispersed on the surface of SiO2. As shown in Figs. 1(b)–(c), within 4.5 h on stream, the catalysts with different loadings deactivated significantly. Taking 3Ga2O3/SiO2 as an example, the conversion dropped from 27% to 18%, while the selectivity dropped from 93% to 89%. The selectivity of by-products (methane, ethylene, and also a little ethane and butene) increases, especially for methane and ethylene. The carbon deposition on the catalysts was measured by TGA, and the results are shown in Fig. 2(a). As the reaction proceeds, the amount of deposited carbon increases and the yield of propylene decreases. However, the increasing rate of carbon deposition is not consistent with the decreasing rate of the propylene yield. For example, after 6 h on stream the propylene production shows a steady state, but the coke deposition keeps increasing. These results suggest the carbon deposition is not the only cause of deactivation. It has been reported that Ga-hydrides formed on isolated Ga sites are inactive for PDH and would reversibly decompose under reaction conditions [24]. Chen et al. made similar analyses in which tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+-O species are regarded as the key component to achieve high PDH activity [28]. The formation of Ga-hydrides on Ga2O3/SiO2 may also account for the deactivation with the increase of time on stream.

For Ga/SiO2 and Ga-containing zeolites, previous studies have suggested Ga3+-Hx species are formed during H2 pre-treatment at elevated temperatures (T > 550 °C) and under reaction conditions [23, 25, 30, 31]. We studied the PDH performance of 8Ga2O3/SiO2 with Ga-hydrides after pretreatment with H2 at 650 °C, and the rate of C3H6 formation is shown in Fig. 3(a). The initial PDH rate is 3.77 × 10−4 (mol C3H6) (mol Ga)−1 s−1, and it increases to 4.84 × 10−4 (mol C3H6) (mol Ga)−1 s−1 after 2 h on stream, approximately 28% higher than the initial rate. The increase of PDH rate implies the loss of unfavorable intermediate species and/or the increase of the total number of Ga active sites. The surface hydride species on 8Ga2O3/SiO2 during PDH were tracked by in situ DRIFT, as shown in Figs. 3(b) and (c). After pretreatment with 50% H2/N2, a band appears at 2035 cm−1, which is attributed to Ga-H [32, 33, 34, 35, 36], produced by the heterolytic dissociation of H2 across a Ga–O bond. During PDH, the band of Ga-H gradually becomes weaker, that indicates the loss of a large fraction of Ga-H. At the same time, the formation of propylene can be observed on the mass spectrometry profile, shown in Fig. 3(d). The decrease of the IR band of Ga-hydrides is accompanied by the increase of the rate of C3H6 formation. These results suggest Ga-hydrides are unfavorable intermediate species during PDH over Ga2O3/SiO2 similar to the single-site Ga catalysts.

3.2. The role of CO2 on the elimination of Ga-hydrides
Liu et al. [37] studied the mechanism of propane activation over Ga2O3 (100) using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and also proposed that co-feeding a soft oxidant like CO2 and steam may have promoting effects on the performance of the Ga2O3 catalyst through removal of the surface hydrogen. To investigate the effect of CO2 on eliminating Ga-hydrides, in situ DRIFT experiments were carried out on Ga2O3 and 8Ga2O3/SiO2 at 600 °C. In order to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, in situ DRIFT experiments were firstly carried out with unsupported Ga2O3 as a model catalyst. As shown in Fig. 4(a), when H2 is introduced, a band of Ga-H appears at 2035 cm−1. The longer the H2 treatment, the stronger the band. After 30 min H2 treatment, the intensity of the band of Ga-H no longer changes significantly. As shown in Fig. 4(b), following N2 treatment weakened the band of Ga-H, corresponding to partial decomposition of gallium hydrides, but the Ga-H species cannot be totally eliminated by N2. After 20-min treatment, the intensity of the Ga-H band remains almost constant. However, the band disappeared after CO2 treatment for 2 min, which suggests that Ga-hydrides on Ga2O3 is completely eliminated by CO2. Therefore, CO2 does effectively react and eliminate Ga-H on Ga2O3.

In situ DRIFT was also performed on 8Ga2O3/SiO2 at 600 °C to examine the effect of CO2 on eliminating Ga-hydrides. As shown in Fig. 5, similar results to Ga2O3 were obtained, although with lower IR band intensity. When the sample was pretreated with H2 for 1h, the band of Ga-H (2035 cm−1) appeared, and a large amount of Ga hydrides has been produced. Then, the samples were treated for 20 min by different atmospheres separately. After the introduction of CO2, the decrease of the band of Ga-H was more significant than after the introduction of N2. The higher the concentration of CO2, the more rapidly the loss of Ga-H. Treatment by 20% CO2/N2 completely eliminates the Ga-H band, which implies that Gaδ+-Hx species on 8Ga2O3/SiO2 decomposed to Ga3+–O bonds. The mass signal of the outlet gas is shown in Fig. 6(a). After the treatment by 50% H2/Ar for 1h, CO2 was introduced, and there is a signal from CO, which decreases confirming the reaction of CO2 with Ga-H. Simultaneously, the IR band of Ga-H disappears as shown in Fig. 6(b). Therefore, from the IR spectra and results of TPSR, it can be concluded that CO2 reacts with Ga-H through the reverse water gas shift reaction forming CO.

3.3. The promotion of CO2 on C3H8 dehydrogenation of Ga2O3/SiO2
Before introducing CO2 into PDH, the performance of 8Ga2O3/SiO2 for RWGS was determined. At 600 °C, methane was not observed in the products, only CO and H2O, and the TOF is 11.8 h−1; while the TOF of PDH over 8Ga2O3/SiO2 is 3.7 h−1. These results suggest that coupling the RWGS reaction with PDH is feasible, and the reaction rate will not be limited by the elimination of Gaδ+-Hx. The effect of CO2 on PDH with Ga2O3/SiO2 catalysts of different loadings is shown in Fig. 7. Co-feeding CO2 significantly improves the conversion stability and propylene selectivity for Ga2O3/SiO2 with loadings from 3 to 10 wt%. For the conversion, when CO2 was introduced, deactivation reduced by approximately 57% within 4.5 h on stream. More importantly, there is no obvious drop of the propylene selectivity within ~ 5 h TOS after the introduction of CO2. The improvement in PDH performance is consistent with our hypothesis that the addition of CO2 during PDH accelerates the transformation of Gaδ+-Hx species to Ga3+-O pairs, thus re-generating the active sites. The reduction in Ga-H sites not only increases the rate, but also the olefin selectivity.

HRTEM and TGA were also performed to detect the carbon deposition. As shown in the images in Fig. 8, coke was observed on the 8Ga2O3/SiO2 after 4 h on stream both without and with cofeeding CO2. The coke deposition seems less significant with cofeeding equal amount of CO2 to C3H8. Quantitative analysis of the coke was done using TGA. Mass loss between 400–600 °C in Fig. 9(a) indicates the presence of coke after PDH. For 8Ga2O3/SiO2, co-feeding CO2 significantly reduced the amount of coke by about 50%. As also shown in Fig. 9(b) and Table 1, the coke deposition increases with the increase of the Ga loading and propane conversion. During PDH in the absence of CO2, the carbon balance dropped from 97% on 3Ga2O3/SiO2 to 86% on 10Ga2O3/SiO2. Cofeeding CO2 increases the carbon balance (reduces the amount of coke deposition) leading to increased PDH stability. For example, co-feeding equal amount of CO2 increased the carbon balance from 87% to 92% over 8Ga2O3/SiO2. Xie et al. [38] studied the role of CO2 during propane dehydrogenation on Cr-ZrO2, in which CO2 can over-oxidize propane to CO and methane. However, with the introduction of CO2 to the PDH over Ga2O3/SiO2, the carbon balance calculated only on hydrocarbons is improved, as summarized in Table 1. Therefore, the propane over-oxidation by CO2 is negligible.

Reaction conditions: 600 °C, 0.05 MPa, GHSV = 3900 mL/g/h, TOS = 0.5 h.
The effect of CO2 concentration on catalytic performance for 3Ga2O3/SiO2 is shown in Figs. 10(a) and (b). The improvement of propane dehydrogenation performance does not vary significantly, when the concentration of CO2 is changed. When CO2 was introduced with the ratio of CO2 to C3H8 ranging from 1 to 2, the stability of conversion and selectivity is greatly improved. The results suggest when PDH is coupled with RWGS, the rate limiting step is PDH, which is also consistent with the results above that the TOF of RWGS is significantly higher than that of PDH. When the reaction temperature was increased to 627 °C, the stability of conversion and selectivity is also greatly improved, especially the selectivity. Without CO2, the selectivity decreased from 88% to 81% within 4.5 h on stream; however, there is no significant decline in C3H6 selectivity with time when the ratio of CO2 and C3H8 is in the range from 0.5 to 3. It can be concluded that CO2 is in excessive during the reaction, and only a small amount of CO2 is needed to improve the performance of PDH. In addition, there is a more significant effect at higher reaction temperatures where the formation of Ga-Hx is facile in the absence of CO2.

After the introduction of CO2, the initial TOF of Ga2O3/SiO2 slightly decreases. For example, when CO2 was introduced, the TOF of 8Ga2O3/SiO2 drops from 3.7 to 3.5 h−1, and the TOF of 3Ga2O3/SiO2 drops from 5.5 to 5.3 h−1. It may be due to the competitive adsorption of propane and CO2. Similarly, Xu et al. [9] observed that CO2 suppressed the PDH activity of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3, in which they also proposed the adsorption of CO2 on the active sites would reduce the possibility of the adsorption of propane on gallium oxide, leading to a decrease in the rate of PDH. The adsorption of CO2 and C3H8 on 8Ga2O3/SiO2 was detected by in situ DRIFT and the results are shown in Fig. 11. The propane adsorbed at room temperature is almost completely desorbed after 15 min of N2 purge. When it comes to the absorption of CO2, the band at 2300–2500 cm−1 attributable to gas-phase CO2 disappears after 15 min of N2 purge. However, the band at 1630 cm−1, which is assigned to bicarbonate species (HCO3*) on the Ga2O3 remains [39]. As the temperature increases, the band of HCO3* gradually becomes weaker. When the temperature increases to 250 °C, the band disappears and the CO2 absorbed on Ga2O3 is completely desorbed. Therefore, the adsorption of CO2 on Ga2O3/SiO2 is stronger than that of C3H8, which may lead to a decrease in the initial PDH rate.

4. Conclusions
The effect of co-feeding CO2 during propane dehydrogenation was investigated for Ga2O3/SiO2 catalysts with different Ga loadings. After H2 pretreatment, the propylene formation rate of 8Ga2O3/SiO2 increases with increasing time on stream due to the simultaneous transformation of Ga-Hx species. In situ DRIFT results show that CO2 can effectively eliminate Ga-H with the formation of CO. When CO2 is introduced to PDH, in addition to higher rates, the stability of propane conversion and propylene selectivity is also significantly improved. The improved stability appears to result from the elimination of Gaδ+-Hx species and reduced carbon deposition. The rate of Ga-H reaction with CO2 is higher than PDH, thus small amounts of CO2 are necessary for these improvements. These results may be applicable to other PDH catalysts.
