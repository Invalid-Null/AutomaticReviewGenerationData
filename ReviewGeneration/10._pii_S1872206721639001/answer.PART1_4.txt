 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that directly answer any of the questions. The article focuses on propane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3/SiO2 catalysts and does not evaluate other metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3 or Pt-Sn, nor does it discuss supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir. The article does not investigate tuning of oxidation states or acid-base properties, or provide insights into metal-support interfacial effects. While it proposes a mechanism involving Ga-hydride intermediates over Ga2O3/SiO2, it does not explore mechanistic pathways for other catalyst systems asked about in the questions.
