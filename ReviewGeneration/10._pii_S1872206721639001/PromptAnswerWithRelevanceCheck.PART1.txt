[1] "Ga-hydrides formed during PDH reduce the rate, selectivity and yield of propylene. In recent years, Ga-based catalysts have attracted more attention." 

[2] "Ga3+-Hx species are formed during H2 pre-treatment at elevated temperatures (T > 550 C) and under reaction conditions."

[3] "Only four coordinate, single-site Ga3+-O species can cleave the CH bonds of C3H8. The less stable Gaδ+-Hx species is formed under high temperature H2 treatment, and the rate of its transformation to Ga3+-O can affect the rate of propane dehydrogenation."

[4] "These results suggest Ga-hydrides are unfavorable intermediate species during PDH over Ga2O3/SiO2 similar to the single-site Ga catalysts."

[2] "These results suggest Ga-hydrides are unfavorable intermediate species during PDH over Ga2O3/SiO2 similar to the single-site Ga catalysts."

[3] "The increase of PDH rate implies the loss of unfavorable intermediate species and/or the increase of the total number of Ga active sites."

[4] "After pretreatment with 50% H2/N2, a band appears at 2035 cm-1, which is attributed to Ga-H [32, 33, 34, 35, 36], produced by the heterolytic dissociation of H2 across a GaO bond."

<English version answer> 

3. Answer: The article proposes that Ga-hydride species like Gaδ+-Hx are formed as intermediates during propane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3/SiO2. These Ga-hydride species are unfavorable and inactive for dehydrogenation. The active sites are Ga3+-O species. Transforming Ga-hydrides back to Ga3+-O can increase the dehydrogenation rate.
