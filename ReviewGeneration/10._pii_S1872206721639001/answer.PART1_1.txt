<quotes>
[1] "Ga-hydrides formed during PDH reduce the rate, selectivity and yield of propylene. In recent years, Ga-based catalysts have attracted more attention." 

[2] "Ga3+-Hx species are formed during H2 pre-treatment at elevated temperatures (T > 550 C) and under reaction conditions."

[3] "Only four coordinate, single-site Ga3+-O species can cleave the CH bonds of C3H8. The less stable Gaδ+-Hx species is formed under high temperature H2 treatment, and the rate of its transformation to Ga3+-O can affect the rate of propane dehydrogenation."

[4] "These results suggest Ga-hydrides are unfavorable intermediate species during PDH over Ga2O3/SiO2 similar to the single-site Ga catalysts."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes that Ga-hydrides formed during propane dehydrogenation are unfavorable intermediates that reduce activity and selectivity. Ga3+-O sites are proposed as the active sites for C-H bond cleavage. The transformation rate of Ga-Hx species to Ga3+-O affects propane dehydrogenation rate over Ga2O3/SiO2.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 文章提出,丙烷脱氢过程中形成的铬氢化物是不利的中间产物,会降低活性和选择性。文章提出Ga3+-O位是C-H键裂解的活性位点。Ga-Hx种转化为Ga3+-O的速率会影响Ga2O3/SiO2上的丙烷脱氢速率。
