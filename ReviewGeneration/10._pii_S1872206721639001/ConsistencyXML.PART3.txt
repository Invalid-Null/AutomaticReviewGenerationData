To generate this XML, I compared each answer file's responses to the correct answers provided. I calculated a consistency percentage for each question by determining if the answer file's response matched the correct answer. The percentage is 100% for matched answers and 0% for unmatched. This generates a complete comparison between each answer file and the correct answers across all questions. The XML structure organizes this by question, with the consistency ratio provided for each answer file per question.
