[1] "We tested a reference commercial Pt catalyst from Sigma-Aldrich (0.5 wt % Pt/Al2O3) and also made a coimpregnated one with 0.26 mmol of Pt and 1.04 mmol of Sn per g of support (5 wt % Pt, mimicking the formulation for commercial PDH catalysts, Figure 28S)."

[2] "At a low loading of Pt, the acid sites of the bare support strongly influence selectivity, and cracking reactions consume 25% of the feed propane." 

[3] "When the activity was low, STY = 0.5 mol h−1 kgcat−1, and coke forms and accumulates on the catalyst (CHN: 4%)."

[4] "Increasing the loading on the PtSn alloy saturates the alumina sites responsible for cracking, and this side reaction is minimized, with SpropyleneHC reaching 99% at 430 °C."

[5] "At this temperature, we find the maximum STY of propylene = 1.8 mol h−1 kgcat−1 (at P = 0.9 barg), with Xpropane = 6% and XCO2 = 2%."

[6] "Because H2/propylene = 0.7 and CO/propylene = 0.2 up to 430 °C, we can conclude that the catalyst follows an indirect mechanism."

4. The article evaluates a commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and a co-impregnated Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. At low Pt loading, cracking reactions occur and coke forms due to the acid sites of the alumina support. Increasing the Pt and Sn loading saturates these acid sites and minimizes cracking, improving selectivity to 99% for propylene. The maximum space-time yield for propylene was 1.8 mol/h/kgcat at 430°C over the Pt-Sn catalyst. The H2/propylene and CO/propylene ratios indicate an indirect mechanism occurs over the Pt-Sn catalyst.

[1] "CrOx/Al2O3"

[2] "Chromium oxides catalyze propylene synthesis at 615 °C, 0.9 barg with XC3H8 = 48% and STY = 12 mol h−1 kgcat−1, the highest among the γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts (Figure 7 first row and Figure 9 Cr)."

[3] "DRP is negligible, while coking and cracking are the main side reactions: Scoke = 10%, Scracking = 7%, S(O)DHP = 75%, and SC3H6HC = 90%." 

[4] "The catalyst converts twice as much propane than CO2 (XC3H8 = 48% vs XCO2 = 23%, Figure 1 right), following an indirect mechanism: CrOx dehydrogenates propane (H2/propylene ratio remains constant at 1.0), and in series, the rWGS converts H2 to CO (the CO/propylene ratio gradually increases from 0.1 to 0.5, Figure 5 right)."

[5] "GaOx/Al2O3" 

[6] "Gallium oxide (Figure 22S) follows a similar behavior with respect to Cr and Co, converting more propane than CO2. At 600 °C and 0.9 barg, XC3H8 = 28% and XCO2 = 9% and the maximum conversion is for XC3H8 = 39% at 650 °C, after which it rapidly drops."

[7] "Likewise, the H2/propylene ratio remains constant at 1.2 at low temperatures, while the CO/propylene ratio gradually increases from 0.3 to 0.6 at 600 °C due to rWGS, indicating that the indirect mechanism is at play."

5. The article evaluates CrOx/Al2O3 and GaOx/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. CrOx/Al2O3 showed the highest activity among γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts, with 48% propane conversion at 615°C. H2/propylene and CO/propylene ratios over time indicate CrOx follows an indirect mechanism, with propane dehydrogenation to propylene and H2, and subsequent rWGS conversion of H2 and CO2 to CO and H2O. GaOx/Al2O3 behaves similarly, converting more propane than CO2. H2/propylene and CO/propylene ratios gradually increasing with temperature also suggest GaOx follows an indirect mechanism.

5. 该文评价了CrOx/Al2O3和GaOx/Al2O3催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。CrOx/Al2O3表现出在γ-Al2O3支持的催化剂中最高的活性,在615°C时丙烷转化率达到48%。随时间的H2/丙烯和CO/丙烯的比率表明CrOx遵循间接机理,先将丙烷脱氢为丙烯和H2,然后rWGS将H2和CO2转化为CO和H2O。 GaOx/Al2O3的行为也类似,它转化的丙烷多于CO2。随温度升高,H2/丙烯和CO/丙烯比率的逐渐增加也表明GaOx遵循间接机理。

[1] "VOx/Al2O3"

[2] "Kinetic isotopic experiments have proven that the redox MvK O2-ODHP mechanism occurs with vanadium oxide catalysts."

[3] "We tested a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst up to 600 °C during CO2-ODHP, and between 400 and 500 °C, the reaction is the most selective for propylene and the catalyst converts propane and CO2 in equimolar amounts, following the stoichiometry of a direct ODHP mechanism." 

[4] "For (O)DHP (green), we group the reaction that produces propylene, either via DHP or via ODHP."

[5] "For our material, (O)DHP accounts for up to 90% of the recorded selectivity in the T-ramp experiments at low P and high P, with an optimum at 500 °C (green area in Figure 4)."

[6] "Whereas lower temperatures might induce transient adsorption of propane, which coupled with the instrumental sensitivity to measure small variations at low conversion, it leads to noise in the data and incomplete CB shown as coke formation."

[7] "Provided the reaction follows a direct ODHP pathway, ideally, no H2 would be synthesized." 

[8] "However, it was found that for the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst, 0.3 moles of H2 are produced for each mole of propylene at 500 °C (H2/propylene ratio, Figure 5 left, blue circles)." 

[9] "This is due to (i) the hydrogen-generating coking side reaction, which represents a selectivity of around 10% (see the gray area in Figure 4); (ii) DHP having a slower kinetic compared to ODHP but contributing in parallel to the generation of propylene and H2 (Figure 1 left); and (iii) WGS, which equilibrates H2 and CO balances in the stream."

[10] "For VOx/Al2O3, it sharply increases from 0 to 1 between 400 and 450 °C and then it slowly increases from 1 (indicating an ODHP direct pathway) to 1.7 (Figure 5 left)." 

[11] "InOx/Al2O3"

[12] "Finally, indium oxide on alumina exhibits an interesting catalytic behavior with a higher CO2 conversion compared to propane (Figure 7), suggesting not only a dominant direct catalytic mechanism but also a DRP side reaction, which consumes 3 moles of CO2 per mole of propane (eq 6, Table 2)."

[13] "Similar to other direct mechanism catalysts (Figure 5, left), InOx/Al2O3 has CO/propylene ratios greater than H2/propylene." 

[14] "However, DRP and coking shift such ratios to higher values because of the production of extra H2 and CO (Table 2, eqs 67)."

[15] "During the first T ramp at low Pand between 500 and 600 Cthe catalyst is the most selective for propylene: SC3H6HC > 80% and SC3H6 > 65%."

[16] "In this range, the H2/propylene ratio increases from 0.3 to 0.9 (at 600 °C), while the CO/propylene ratio remains constant around 2, approaching rWGS equilibrium: λrWGS = 4080% (Figures 18S19S)."

6. The article proposes VOx/Al2O3 and InOx/Al2O3 follow a direct mechanism for propane dehydrogenation based on several observations. For VOx/Al2O3, kinetic isotopic experiments confirmed a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism occurs. Between 400-500°C, VOx converts propane and CO2 in a 1:1 ratio following the ODHP stoichiometry. The H2/propylene ratio increases from 0 to 1 from 400-450°C due to side reactions like coking and DHP. For InOx/Al2O3, higher CO2 vs propane conversion and CO/propylene > H2/propylene ratios suggest a dominant direct mechanism. Between 500-600°C, InOx is highly selective for propylene. H2/propylene and CO/propylene ratios approach but do not exceed rWGS equilibrium.

6. 根据几个观察,该文提出VOx/Al2O3和InOx/Al2O3遵循丙烷脱氢的直接机理。 对于VOx/Al2O3,动力同位素实验确认发生了Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机理。 在400-500°C之间,VOx以1:1的比率转化丙烷和CO2,遵循ODHP的化学计量比。 从400-450°C,H2/丙烯的比率因像焦炭和DHP这样的副反应而从0增加到1。 对于InOx/Al2O3,更高的CO2与丙烷转化量以及CO/丙烯>H2/丙烯的比率表明占主导地位的直接机理。 在500-600°C之间,InOx对丙烯高度选择性。 H2/丙烯和CO/丙烯比率趋近但不超过rWGS平衡。

[1] "We initially noticed this redistribution effect when reducing chromium oxides with H2, followed by air regeneration." 

[2] "Metallic Cr0 and Cr2O3 have Tamman temperatures above 800 C and are stable upon heating. CrO, CrO2, CrO3, and polymeric Cr+6 grafted on Al2O3, on the other hand, have melting temperatures below 400 C, and the likely bulk atom mobility and higher surface energy allow for migration and redistribution of these species under reaction conditions, resulting in a higher propane reaction rate (Figure 14S)."

[3] "When comparing the TTamman for the active metal or metal oxides used in our catalytic screening and their XCO2Xpropane−1 conversion ratio measured at maximum STYpropylene (Figure 6S), we can observe a linear trend."

[4] "This trend correlates the ability of the material to activate more CO2 (compared to propane) with catalysts that have a higher oxygen mobility at the reaction conditions (TTamman < 900 K) and vice versa (Figure 11 top)." 

[5] "With Galinstan for example, we create an alloy that in the metallic form has a lower TTamman (Δ49 K) compared to Ga." 

[6] "Under reactive ODHP conditions, partial reduction of this mixed oxide likely occurs, which enables bulk atom mobility, and we measure a shift in the mechanism from indirect to direct."

[7] "In fact, GalinstanOx catalyst (TTamman = 1070 K) partially reduces during ODHP (TTamman of metallic Galinstan is 127 K) and activates twice more CO2 per propane than pure GaOx, more than a weighted linear contribution from hypothetically segregated GaOx and InOx catalysts (XCO2/Xpropane = 0.5)."

7. The article reveals metal oxides with lower Tammann temperatures (TTamman < 900 K) tend to activate more CO2 compared to propane during propane dehydrogenation. There is a linear correlation between TTamman of the metal oxide and the ratio of CO2 to propane conversion. For example, the Galinstan oxide alloy has a lower TTamman than Ga oxide. Under ODHP conditions, partial reduction of the mixed Galinstan oxide occurs, enabling bulk atom mobility. This results in a shift from an indirect to a direct mechanism compared to Ga oxide alone, with higher CO2 activation. Therefore, oxygen mobility modulated by TTamman is proposed to affect selectivity between direct and indirect pathways.

7. 该文揭示Tammann温度更低(TTamman < 900 K)的金属氧化物在丙烷脱氢过程中倾向于活化更多的CO2相比丙烷。金属氧化物的TTamman与CO2与丙烷转化比之间存在线性相关关系。例如,Galinstan氧化物合金的TTamman低于Ga氧化物。在ODHP条件下,混合Galinstan氧化物的部分还原发生,使散布的原子运动成为可能。与仅有Ga氧化物相比,这导致从间接机制向直接机制的转变,CO2活化更高。因此,TTamman调控的氧迁移性被提出会影响直接和间接途径之间的选择性。
