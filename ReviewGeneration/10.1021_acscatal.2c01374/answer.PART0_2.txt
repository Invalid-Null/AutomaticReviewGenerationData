Propylene is the second largest bulk chemical produced globally, primarily feeding the ever-growing polymer industry. The production of propylene has steadily increased by 6% annually in the past 10 years.
Dehydrogenation of (fossil) propane (DHP) offers an alternative as a selective on-purpose production of propylene with similar EI to FCC, with EI variabilities based on local heat supplies (shale gas vs coal vs electricity): GHG = 1.7 kgCO2-eq kgC3H61 (North America), 2.0 kgCO2-eq kgC3H61 (China), 2.2 kgCO2-eq kgC3H61 (electric), and FD = 1.21.6 kgoil-eq kgC3H61.
Several commercial catalytic processes exist today, satisfying 1520% of the global propylene production: Catofin, fluidized-bed dehydrogenation (FBD), propane dehydrogenation (PDH), Oleflex, and Star.
The DHP reaction is endothermic and thermodynamically limited below 500 C. However, working above this temperature causes coke to form, resulting in catalyst fouling, representing the main reversible deactivation mechanism and byproduct of the reaction.
Currently, only two active materials dominate the industrial marketchromium and platinumeach with similar activity and selectivity (8590%), but with design differences based on heat supply and in situ catalyst regeneration methods.

1. The article provides background that propylene production through propane dehydrogenation is very important, as propylene is the 2nd largest chemical feedstock globally, with annual growth around 6% per year and main use as a monomer for polymer production. Specific details are given on current and projected demand, and the major commercial processes for propane dehydrogenation are described.

2. The article explains how the dehydrogenation reaction is endothermic and equilibrium limited, so catalysts are critical to enable operation at lower temperatures. Some catalyst classes are mentioned but no specific mechanisms described.

3. Major catalysts discussed are chromium and platinum oxides, along with some details around their activation procedures, loadings, supports like alumina, and differences in reactor design needs based on catalyst regeneration requirements. No other catalyst classes are introduced. 

4. The article discusses the thermodynamic constraints, with the reaction limited below 500C. Quantitative kinetics are not provided.

5. The article does not describe any DFT calculations relevant to propane dehydrogenation.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation. 

7. The article does not identify any computational or experimental descriptors that correlate catalyst properties to performance.
