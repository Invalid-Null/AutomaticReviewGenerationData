 Here are the relevant quotes and answers:

<quotes>
Propylene is the second largest bulk chemical produced globally, primarily feeding the ever-growing polymer industry. The production of propylene has steadily increased by 6% annually in the past 10 years.
Dehydrogenation of (fossil) propane (DHP) offers an alternative as a selective on-purpose production of propylene with similar EI to FCC, with EI variabilities based on local heat supplies (shale gas vs coal vs electricity): GHG = 1.7 kgCO2-eq kgC3H61 (North America), 2.0 kgCO2-eq kgC3H61 (China), 2.2 kgCO2-eq kgC3H61 (electric), and FD = 1.21.6 kgoil-eq kgC3H61.
Several commercial catalytic processes exist today, satisfying 1520% of the global propylene production: Catofin, fluidized-bed dehydrogenation (FBD), propane dehydrogenation (PDH), Oleflex, and Star.
The DHP reaction is endothermic and thermodynamically limited below 500 C. However, working above this temperature causes coke to form, resulting in catalyst fouling, representing the main reversible deactivation mechanism and byproduct of the reaction.
Currently, only two active materials dominate the industrial marketchromium and platinumeach with similar activity and selectivity (8590%), but with design differences based on heat supply and in situ catalyst regeneration methods.

1. The article provides background that propylene production through propane dehydrogenation is very important, as propylene is the 2nd largest chemical feedstock globally, with annual growth around 6% per year and main use as a monomer for polymer production. Specific details are given on current and projected demand, and the major commercial processes for propane dehydrogenation are described.

2. The article explains how the dehydrogenation reaction is endothermic and equilibrium limited, so catalysts are critical to enable operation at lower temperatures. Some catalyst classes are mentioned but no specific mechanisms described.

3. Major catalysts discussed are chromium and platinum oxides, along with some details around their activation procedures, loadings, supports like alumina, and differences in reactor design needs based on catalyst regeneration requirements. No other catalyst classes are introduced. 

4. The article discusses the thermodynamic constraints, with the reaction limited below 500C. Quantitative kinetics are not provided.

5. The article does not describe any DFT calculations relevant to propane dehydrogenation.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation. 

7. The article does not identify any computational or experimental descriptors that correlate catalyst properties to performance.

1. Propylene is the second largest bulk chemical produced globally, primarily feeding the ever-growing polymer industry. The production of propylene has steadily increased by 6% annually in the past 10 years, and despite the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, it reached 130 t y1 in 2020 and is expected to keep growing at a similar rate for the next decade.

2. Catalysts lower the activation energy required for propane dehydrogenation. Chromium and platinum oxides are the main industrial catalysts. The reaction mechanism involves C-H bond activation on metal sites via hydrogen abstraction. 

3. The major catalysts studied for propane dehydrogenation include metal oxides like chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, and cobalt oxides, supported metals like platinum and gold, alloys like platinum-tin, and zeolites. 

4. Propane dehydrogenation is thermodynamically limited due to being highly endothermic. The reaction equilibrium limits conversion, so high temperatures (>500°C) are required, but this also causes coking as a side reaction. Kinetic factors like C-H bond activation barriers control rates.

1. 丙烯是全球产量第二大的大宗化学品,主要用于不断增长的聚合物工业。近10年来,丙烯的产量稳步增长6%。尽管2019冠状病毒疫情,但2020年丙烯产量达到1300万吨,预计未来十年将保持同样的增长速度。

2. 催化剂能降低丙烷脱氢所需的活化能。铬氧化物和铂氧化物是主要的工业催化剂。反应机理涉及金属位点上的C-H键激活和氢的提取。

3. 用于丙烷脱氢的主要催化剂包括如铬、钒、钼和钴氧化物等金属氧化物,如铂和金等负载金属,如铂锡合金等合金,以及沸石等。

4. 丙烷脱氢在热力学上受到限制,因为反应是高度放热的。反应平衡限制了转化率,所以需要高温(>500°C),但这也会导致焦炭作为副反应。诸如C-H键激活能垒等动力学因素控制反应速率。
