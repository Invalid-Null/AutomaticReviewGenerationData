1. Propylene is the second largest bulk chemical produced globally, primarily feeding the ever-growing polymer industry. The production of propylene has steadily increased by 6% annually in the past 10 years, and despite the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, it reached 130 t y1 in 2020 and is expected to keep growing at a similar rate for the next decade.

2. Catalysts lower the activation energy required for propane dehydrogenation. Chromium and platinum oxides are the main industrial catalysts. The reaction mechanism involves C-H bond activation on metal sites via hydrogen abstraction. 

3. The major catalysts studied for propane dehydrogenation include metal oxides like chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, and cobalt oxides, supported metals like platinum and gold, alloys like platinum-tin, and zeolites. 

4. Propane dehydrogenation is thermodynamically limited due to being highly endothermic. The reaction equilibrium limits conversion, so high temperatures (>500°C) are required, but this also causes coking as a side reaction. Kinetic factors like C-H bond activation barriers control rates.

1. 丙烯是全球产量第二大的大宗化学品,主要用于不断增长的聚合物工业。近10年来,丙烯的产量稳步增长6%。尽管2019冠状病毒疫情,但2020年丙烯产量达到1300万吨,预计未来十年将保持同样的增长速度。

2. 催化剂能降低丙烷脱氢所需的活化能。铬氧化物和铂氧化物是主要的工业催化剂。反应机理涉及金属位点上的C-H键激活和氢的提取。

3. 用于丙烷脱氢的主要催化剂包括如铬、钒、钼和钴氧化物等金属氧化物,如铂和金等负载金属,如铂锡合金等合金,以及沸石等。

4. 丙烷脱氢在热力学上受到限制,因为反应是高度放热的。反应平衡限制了转化率,所以需要高温(>500°C),但这也会导致焦炭作为副反应。诸如C-H键激活能垒等动力学因素控制反应速率。
