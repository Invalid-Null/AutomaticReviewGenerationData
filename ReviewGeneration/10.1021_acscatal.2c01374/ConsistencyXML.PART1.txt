To explain briefly:

- I compared the English answer from each file to the correct English answer provided. 
- I calculated a consistency ratio percentage based on my judgment of how consistent the meanings were between the two answers.
- 100% means the meanings were fully consistent, 0% means completely inconsistent or missing an answer.
- The XML format organizes the consistency ratios by question number and ties each ratio to the specific file it came from.

I aimed to determine semantic consistency, not just exact word match. But there is still some subjectivity in my consistency judgments. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
