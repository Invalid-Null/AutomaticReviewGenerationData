<quotes>

[1] "Cr+2, Cr+4, and Cr+6 have TTamman < 50 C but are unstable and will decompose upon heating (likewise for Pt, Au, and Ag oxides). Indeed, the alumina support stabilizes these highly valent species, but upon reaction, they are short-lived." 

[2] "In this context of oxygen mobility, we hypothesize that for an efficient use of a direct (redox) mechanism (Figure 1, left), catalytic materials need to have apparent reaction rates of ODHP and reoxidation of the same order of magnitude (rODHP ≈ rreoxidation)."

[3] "If dissociative chemisorption of CO2(g) competes with propane for the same active site, then it would seem we can increase the reactivity with a catalytic material capable of replenishing oxygen vacancies using bulk and neighbor lattice oxygen."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It notes that Cr, Pt, Au, and Ag oxides with lower Tammann temperatures are unstable but can be stabilized by alumina supports, indicating tuning oxidation states affects performance (Quote 1). It also hypothesizes matching ODHP and reoxidation rates by using bulk lattice oxygen mobility to replenish vacancies could increase reactivity, revealing how oxygen mobility affects performance (Quotes 2-3).

[1] "For certain indirect mechanism catalysts, a H-assisted pathway activates CO2 when H atoms are dissociated on the surface of the active site via intermediate formate HCOO or carboxyl HOCO species, ultimately forming rWGS products." 

[2] "For direct mechanism catalysts, propane dehydrogenation progresses on a limited number of highly valent metal oxide centers, in which lattice oxygen initiates the reaction by coordinating propane and abstracting H via an MvK mechansim."

3. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. It describes an H-assisted pathway with formate/carboxyl intermediates for indirect catalysts to produce rWGS products (Quote 1).

[1] "We tested a reference commercial Pt catalyst from Sigma-Aldrich (0.5 wt % Pt/Al2O3) and also made a coimpregnated one with 0.26 mmol of Pt and 1.04 mmol of Sn per g of support (5 wt % Pt, mimicking the formulation for commercial PDH catalysts, Figure 28S)."

[2] "At a low loading of Pt, the acid sites of the bare support strongly influence selectivity, and cracking reactions consume 25% of the feed propane." 

[3] "When the activity was low, STY = 0.5 mol h−1 kgcat−1, and coke forms and accumulates on the catalyst (CHN: 4%)."

[4] "Increasing the loading on the PtSn alloy saturates the alumina sites responsible for cracking, and this side reaction is minimized, with SpropyleneHC reaching 99% at 430 °C."

[5] "At this temperature, we find the maximum STY of propylene = 1.8 mol h−1 kgcat−1 (at P = 0.9 barg), with Xpropane = 6% and XCO2 = 2%."

[6] "Because H2/propylene = 0.7 and CO/propylene = 0.2 up to 430 °C, we can conclude that the catalyst follows an indirect mechanism."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. The article evaluates a commercial Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and a co-impregnated Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. At low Pt loading, cracking reactions occur and coke forms due to the acid sites of the alumina support. Increasing the Pt and Sn loading saturates these acid sites and minimizes cracking, improving selectivity to 99% for propylene. The maximum space-time yield for propylene was 1.8 mol/h/kgcat at 430°C over the Pt-Sn catalyst. The H2/propylene and CO/propylene ratios indicate an indirect mechanism occurs over the Pt-Sn catalyst.

</English version answer>

4. 该文评价了商业Pt/Al2O3催化剂和共浸渍Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。在低Pt负载量下,由于氧化铝支撑的酸性位点,发生了裂化反应和焦炭生成。 增加Pt和Sn的负载量饱和了这些酸性位点,使裂化反应最小化,使丙烯的选择性提高到99%。 在430°C的Pt-Sn催化剂上,丙烯的最大空时产率为1.8 mol/h/kgcat。 H2/丙烯和CO/丙烯的比率表明Pt-Sn催化剂发生了间接机理。

[1] "CrOx/Al2O3"

[2] "Chromium oxides catalyze propylene synthesis at 615 °C, 0.9 barg with XC3H8 = 48% and STY = 12 mol h−1 kgcat−1, the highest among the γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts (Figure 7 first row and Figure 9 Cr)."

[3] "DRP is negligible, while coking and cracking are the main side reactions: Scoke = 10%, Scracking = 7%, S(O)DHP = 75%, and SC3H6HC = 90%." 

[4] "The catalyst converts twice as much propane than CO2 (XC3H8 = 48% vs XCO2 = 23%, Figure 1 right), following an indirect mechanism: CrOx dehydrogenates propane (H2/propylene ratio remains constant at 1.0), and in series, the rWGS converts H2 to CO (the CO/propylene ratio gradually increases from 0.1 to 0.5, Figure 5 right)."

[5] "GaOx/Al2O3" 

[6] "Gallium oxide (Figure 22S) follows a similar behavior with respect to Cr and Co, converting more propane than CO2. At 600 °C and 0.9 barg, XC3H8 = 28% and XCO2 = 9% and the maximum conversion is for XC3H8 = 39% at 650 °C, after which it rapidly drops."

[7] "Likewise, the H2/propylene ratio remains constant at 1.2 at low temperatures, while the CO/propylene ratio gradually increases from 0.3 to 0.6 at 600 °C due to rWGS, indicating that the indirect mechanism is at play."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

5. The article evaluates CrOx/Al2O3 and GaOx/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. CrOx/Al2O3 showed the highest activity among γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts, with 48% propane conversion at 615°C. H2/propylene and CO/propylene ratios over time indicate CrOx follows an indirect mechanism, with propane dehydrogenation to propylene and H2, and subsequent rWGS conversion of H2 and CO2 to CO and H2O. GaOx/Al2O3 behaves similarly, converting more propane than CO2. H2/propylene and CO/propylene ratios gradually increasing with temperature also suggest GaOx follows an indirect mechanism.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

5. 该文评价了CrOx/Al2O3和GaOx/Al2O3催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。CrOx/Al2O3表现出在γ-Al2O3支持的催化剂中最高的活性,在615°C时丙烷转化率达到48%。随时间的H2/丙烯和CO/丙烯的比率表明CrOx遵循间接机理,先将丙烷脱氢为丙烯和H2,然后rWGS将H2和CO2转化为CO和H2O。 GaOx/Al2O3的行为也类似,它转化的丙烷多于CO2。随温度升高,H2/丙烯和CO/丙烯比率的逐渐增加也表明GaOx遵循间接机理。

[1] "VOx/Al2O3"

[2] "Kinetic isotopic experiments have proven that the redox MvK O2-ODHP mechanism occurs with vanadium oxide catalysts."

[3] "We tested a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst up to 600 °C during CO2-ODHP, and between 400 and 500 °C, the reaction is the most selective for propylene and the catalyst converts propane and CO2 in equimolar amounts, following the stoichiometry of a direct ODHP mechanism." 

[4] "For (O)DHP (green), we group the reaction that produces propylene, either via DHP or via ODHP."

[5] "For our material, (O)DHP accounts for up to 90% of the recorded selectivity in the T-ramp experiments at low P and high P, with an optimum at 500 °C (green area in Figure 4)."

[6] "Whereas lower temperatures might induce transient adsorption of propane, which coupled with the instrumental sensitivity to measure small variations at low conversion, it leads to noise in the data and incomplete CB shown as coke formation."

[7] "Provided the reaction follows a direct ODHP pathway, ideally, no H2 would be synthesized." 

[8] "However, it was found that for the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst, 0.3 moles of H2 are produced for each mole of propylene at 500 °C (H2/propylene ratio, Figure 5 left, blue circles)." 

[9] "This is due to (i) the hydrogen-generating coking side reaction, which represents a selectivity of around 10% (see the gray area in Figure 4); (ii) DHP having a slower kinetic compared to ODHP but contributing in parallel to the generation of propylene and H2 (Figure 1 left); and (iii) WGS, which equilibrates H2 and CO balances in the stream."

[10] "For VOx/Al2O3, it sharply increases from 0 to 1 between 400 and 450 °C and then it slowly increases from 1 (indicating an ODHP direct pathway) to 1.7 (Figure 5 left)." 

[11] "InOx/Al2O3"

[12] "Finally, indium oxide on alumina exhibits an interesting catalytic behavior with a higher CO2 conversion compared to propane (Figure 7), suggesting not only a dominant direct catalytic mechanism but also a DRP side reaction, which consumes 3 moles of CO2 per mole of propane (eq 6, Table 2)."

[13] "Similar to other direct mechanism catalysts (Figure 5, left), InOx/Al2O3 has CO/propylene ratios greater than H2/propylene." 

[14] "However, DRP and coking shift such ratios to higher values because of the production of extra H2 and CO (Table 2, eqs 67)."

[15] "During the first T ramp at low Pand between 500 and 600 Cthe catalyst is the most selective for propylene: SC3H6HC > 80% and SC3H6 > 65%."

[16] "In this range, the H2/propylene ratio increases from 0.3 to 0.9 (at 600 °C), while the CO/propylene ratio remains constant around 2, approaching rWGS equilibrium: λrWGS = 4080% (Figures 18S19S)." 

</quotes>

<English version answer>

6. The article proposes VOx/Al2O3 and InOx/Al2O3 follow a direct mechanism for propane dehydrogenation based on several observations. For VOx/Al2O3, kinetic isotopic experiments confirmed a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism occurs. Between 400-500°C, VOx converts propane and CO2 in a 1:1 ratio following the ODHP stoichiometry. The H2/propylene ratio increases from 0 to 1 from 400-450°C due to side reactions like coking and DHP. For InOx/Al2O3, higher CO2 vs propane conversion and CO/propylene > H2/propylene ratios suggest a dominant direct mechanism. Between 500-600°C, InOx is highly selective for propylene. H2/propylene and CO/propylene ratios approach but do not exceed rWGS equilibrium.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 

6. 根据几个观察,该文提出VOx/Al2O3和InOx/Al2O3遵循丙烷脱氢的直接机理。 对于VOx/Al2O3,动力同位素实验确认发生了Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机理。 在400-500°C之间,VOx以1:1的比率转化丙烷和CO2,遵循ODHP的化学计量比。 从400-450°C,H2/丙烯的比率因像焦炭和DHP这样的副反应而从0增加到1。 对于InOx/Al2O3,更高的CO2与丙烷转化量以及CO/丙烯>H2/丙烯的比率表明占主导地位的直接机理。 在500-600°C之间,InOx对丙烯高度选择性。 H2/丙烯和CO/丙烯比率趋近但不超过rWGS平衡。

[1] "We initially noticed this redistribution effect when reducing chromium oxides with H2, followed by air regeneration." 

[2] "Metallic Cr0 and Cr2O3 have Tamman temperatures above 800 C and are stable upon heating. CrO, CrO2, CrO3, and polymeric Cr+6 grafted on Al2O3, on the other hand, have melting temperatures below 400 C, and the likely bulk atom mobility and higher surface energy allow for migration and redistribution of these species under reaction conditions, resulting in a higher propane reaction rate (Figure 14S)."

[3] "When comparing the TTamman for the active metal or metal oxides used in our catalytic screening and their XCO2Xpropane−1 conversion ratio measured at maximum STYpropylene (Figure 6S), we can observe a linear trend."

[4] "This trend correlates the ability of the material to activate more CO2 (compared to propane) with catalysts that have a higher oxygen mobility at the reaction conditions (TTamman < 900 K) and vice versa (Figure 11 top)." 

[5] "With Galinstan for example, we create an alloy that in the metallic form has a lower TTamman (Δ49 K) compared to Ga." 

[6] "Under reactive ODHP conditions, partial reduction of this mixed oxide likely occurs, which enables bulk atom mobility, and we measure a shift in the mechanism from indirect to direct."

[7] "In fact, GalinstanOx catalyst (TTamman = 1070 K) partially reduces during ODHP (TTamman of metallic Galinstan is 127 K) and activates twice more CO2 per propane than pure GaOx, more than a weighted linear contribution from hypothetically segregated GaOx and InOx catalysts (XCO2/Xpropane = 0.5)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

7. The article reveals metal oxides with lower Tammann temperatures (TTamman < 900 K) tend to activate more CO2 compared to propane during propane dehydrogenation. There is a linear correlation between TTamman of the metal oxide and the ratio of CO2 to propane conversion. For example, the Galinstan oxide alloy has a lower TTamman than Ga oxide. Under ODHP conditions, partial reduction of the mixed Galinstan oxide occurs, enabling bulk atom mobility. This results in a shift from an indirect to a direct mechanism compared to Ga oxide alone, with higher CO2 activation. Therefore, oxygen mobility modulated by TTamman is proposed to affect selectivity between direct and indirect pathways.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

7. 该文揭示Tammann温度更低(TTamman < 900 K)的金属氧化物在丙烷脱氢过程中倾向于活化更多的CO2相比丙烷。金属氧化物的TTamman与CO2与丙烷转化比之间存在线性相关关系。例如,Galinstan氧化物合金的TTamman低于Ga氧化物。在ODHP条件下,混合Galinstan氧化物的部分还原发生,使散布的原子运动成为可能。与仅有Ga氧化物相比,这导致从间接机制向直接机制的转变,CO2活化更高。因此,TTamman调控的氧迁移性被提出会影响直接和间接途径之间的选择性。

[1] "Strong Lewis acid sites, on the other hand, induce alkane cracking via hydride abstraction and the generation of carbenium ion-activated complexes. Therefore, alkali metal promoters (K, Sn, Mg, Zn) are added to saturate the acid sites of the support and mitigate sintering."  

[2] "The type of alumina used depends on their acidic and morphological properties: α- and θ-alumina supports possess relatively less Brønsted and Lewis acid sites than γ-alumina and are more stable against sintering and coking but also have lower surface areas."

[3] "Strong Brønsted acid sites are also responsible for coking via direct alkane protonation and propylene condensation."

[4] "Lewis-acidic alumina with 5% SiO2 content (SASOL SIRALOX 5/320, specific surface area or SSA = 320 m2 g-1) proved to be a better support for CrOx than pure alumina (now loaded with the common 1.3 mmol of Cr gsupport-1)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that strong Lewis acid sites induce alkane cracking, so alkali promoters like K and Sn are used to saturate these sites and mitigate sintering. Different alumina supports are compared, with α- and θ-alumina having fewer acid sites and more stability against sintering/coking than γ-alumina but lower surface area. Strong Brønsted acid sites also cause coking via alkane protonation and propylene condensation. A SiO2-modified alumina support with 5% SiO2 is found to be better than pure alumina for supporting CrOx catalysts.

[1] "For chromium oxides, there is no consensus: either via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism (40) or via MvK."  

[2] "For highly valent Cr oxide, the CH bond activation proceeds via a LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism of CH cleavage and H-abstraction."

[3] "For redox materials like V oxides, this occurs via a Marsvan Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, (36−38) in which the CH bond activation proceeds via a lattice oxygen abstracting a H atom from an adsorbed propane molecule coordinated with a neighbor lattice oxygen."

[4] "There, CO2 consumes surface hydride species and H2 via the reverse water gas shift (rWGS) reaction, (43,44) while the reverse Boudouard reaction reforms soft coke into CO, (45,46) with CO2 promoting propylene desorption, thus lowering coke formation."  

[5] "If dissociative chemisorption of CO2(g) competes with propane for the same active site, then it would seem we can increase the reactivity with a catalytic material capable of replenishing oxygen vacancies using bulk and neighbor lattice oxygen."

</quotes>

<English version answer> 

3. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. For chromium oxides, propane dehydrogenation may occur via either a Langmuir-Hinshelwood or a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, with CH bond cleavage and H abstraction. For vanadium oxides and other redox materials, a MvK mechanism is proposed where lattice oxygen abstracts H from adsorbed propane. For non-redox catalysts like Pt or reduced metal oxides like Cr3+, CO2 consumes surface hydrides and reforms coke via reverse Boudouard reaction, while promoting propylene desorption to lower coking. The article also suggests increasing reactivity by using materials that can replenish oxygen vacancies via bulk lattice oxygen mobility.

3. 是的,该文为所研究的金属氧化物催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢的机理场景。 对于铬氧化物,丙烷脱氢可能通过朗缪尔-辛舍尔伍德机理或马氏文-克列文机理(MvK)进行,伴随CH键断裂和H的抽离。 对于钒氧化物和其他有重氧化还原性的材料,提出了MvK机理,其中晶格氧从吸附的丙烷分子上抽离H原子。 对于Pt或还原后的金属氧化物(如Cr3+)等非氧化还原型催化剂,CO2会消耗表面氢化物并通过反布杜阿尔反应改造焦炭,同时促进丙烯解吸以降低炭化。 文献还提出,使用能通过体相氧的迁移补充氧空位的材料来增加反应活性。

[1] "In this context of oxygen mobility, we hypothesize that for an efficient use of a direct (redox) mechanism (Figure 1, left), catalytic materials need to have apparent reaction rates of ODHP and reoxidation of the same order of magnitude (rODHP ≈ rreoxidation)." 

[2] "When comparing the TTamman for the active metal/metal oxides used in our catalytic screening and their XCO2/Xpropane-1 conversion ratio, we observed a statistically significant linear trend, correlating well the ability of a catalyst to activate more CO2 (compared to propane) with its higher oxygen mobility."

[3] "Lower vacancy formation energies of the bulk metal oxide should compare well with the vacancy formation energy at the surface as well because TTamman < 900 K (enabling oxygen mobility under reaction conditions, Figure 11 top)."

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that materials with higher oxygen mobility, as indicated by lower Tamman temperatures, tend to activate more CO2 compared to propane during CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation. Lower oxygen vacancy formation energies also correlate with higher CO2 activation. This indicates the importance of oxygen mobility in replenishing vacancies for the redox catalytic cycle.

2. 是的,本文研究了调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧mobility和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它显示氧mobility更高的材料,由较低的塔曼温度所指示,趋向于在CO2辅助的氧化脱氢过程中激活更多的CO2相比丙烷。较低的氧空穴形成能量也与更高的CO2激活相关。这表明氧mobility在补充循环红氧还原催化的空穴方面起着重要作用。

[1] "Low melting-point metallic Ga0 formed at the interface during ODHP conditions would enable the bulk atom mobility to replenish oxygen vacancies using lattice oxygen, increasing the reactivity with CO2."

[2] "When dispersed on Al2O3, the metal oxide showed no reactivity, while on ZrO2, it showed an even higher reforming selectivity (SDRP = 40%, Figure 9)." 

[3] "In the case of InOx/Al2O3, the fresh material after calcination appears to have a greater portion of active metal oxides, in clusters of NPs of In2O3, segregated from the parent alumina support, which we could quantify (SEM on the SI) as roughly 50 wt % external In2O3 NPs (Figures 8A and 38S39S)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. For example, it suggests that low melting point Ga metal formed from Ga2O3 under reaction conditions enables oxygen mobility to replenish vacancies and increase CO2 reactivity. It also shows In2O3 supported on Al2O3 forms In2O3 nanoparticles segregated from the support, which facilitate high reforming selectivity.

3. 是的,本文为所研究的金属氧化物催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢的机理场景。例如,它提出低熔点的Ga金属从Ga2O3在反应条件下形成,使得氧mobility补充空穴增加了CO2的反应性。它还显示Al2O3支持的In2O3形成与支撑体分离的In2O3纳米粒子,这促进了高的重整选择性。

[2] "More interestingly, the rWGS reaction (same conditions as ODHP experiments, but H2 in place of propane) helped eliminate the external NPs, redistributing the materials in the pores of the support (Figures 8C and 40S)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in InOx/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that In2O3 nanoparticles are initially segregated on the Al2O3 surface, but after the rWGS reaction, the nanoparticles disappear from the surface and redistribute into the support pores. This indicates metal-support interactions affect the distribution and location of active sites.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

4. 是的,本文探讨了InOx/Al2O3催化剂中金属-支撑体界面的效应对于丙烷脱氢的影响。它显示In2O3纳米粒子最初与Al2O3表面隔离,但在rWGS反应后,这些纳米粒子从表面消失并重新分配到支撑体孔内。这表明金属-支撑体相互作用影响活性位点的分布和位置。
