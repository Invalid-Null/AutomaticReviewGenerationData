[1] "In this context of oxygen mobility, we hypothesize that for an efficient use of a direct (redox) mechanism (Figure 1, left), catalytic materials need to have apparent reaction rates of ODHP and reoxidation of the same order of magnitude (rODHP ≈ rreoxidation)." 

[2] "When comparing the TTamman for the active metal/metal oxides used in our catalytic screening and their XCO2/Xpropane-1 conversion ratio, we observed a statistically significant linear trend, correlating well the ability of a catalyst to activate more CO2 (compared to propane) with its higher oxygen mobility."

[3] "Lower vacancy formation energies of the bulk metal oxide should compare well with the vacancy formation energy at the surface as well because TTamman < 900 K (enabling oxygen mobility under reaction conditions, Figure 11 top)."

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that materials with higher oxygen mobility, as indicated by lower Tamman temperatures, tend to activate more CO2 compared to propane during CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation. Lower oxygen vacancy formation energies also correlate with higher CO2 activation. This indicates the importance of oxygen mobility in replenishing vacancies for the redox catalytic cycle.

2. 是的,本文研究了调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧mobility和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它显示氧mobility更高的材料,由较低的塔曼温度所指示,趋向于在CO2辅助的氧化脱氢过程中激活更多的CO2相比丙烷。较低的氧空穴形成能量也与更高的CO2激活相关。这表明氧mobility在补充循环红氧还原催化的空穴方面起着重要作用。

[1] "Low melting-point metallic Ga0 formed at the interface during ODHP conditions would enable the bulk atom mobility to replenish oxygen vacancies using lattice oxygen, increasing the reactivity with CO2."

[2] "When dispersed on Al2O3, the metal oxide showed no reactivity, while on ZrO2, it showed an even higher reforming selectivity (SDRP = 40%, Figure 9)." 

[3] "In the case of InOx/Al2O3, the fresh material after calcination appears to have a greater portion of active metal oxides, in clusters of NPs of In2O3, segregated from the parent alumina support, which we could quantify (SEM on the SI) as roughly 50 wt % external In2O3 NPs (Figures 8A and 38S39S)."

3. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. For example, it suggests that low melting point Ga metal formed from Ga2O3 under reaction conditions enables oxygen mobility to replenish vacancies and increase CO2 reactivity. It also shows In2O3 supported on Al2O3 forms In2O3 nanoparticles segregated from the support, which facilitate high reforming selectivity.

3. 是的,本文为所研究的金属氧化物催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢的机理场景。例如,它提出低熔点的Ga金属从Ga2O3在反应条件下形成,使得氧mobility补充空穴增加了CO2的反应性。它还显示Al2O3支持的In2O3形成与支撑体分离的In2O3纳米粒子,这促进了高的重整选择性。

[2] "More interestingly, the rWGS reaction (same conditions as ODHP experiments, but H2 in place of propane) helped eliminate the external NPs, redistributing the materials in the pores of the support (Figures 8C and 40S)."

4. Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in InOx/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that In2O3 nanoparticles are initially segregated on the Al2O3 surface, but after the rWGS reaction, the nanoparticles disappear from the surface and redistribute into the support pores. This indicates metal-support interactions affect the distribution and location of active sites.

4. 是的,本文探讨了InOx/Al2O3催化剂中金属-支撑体界面的效应对于丙烷脱氢的影响。它显示In2O3纳米粒子最初与Al2O3表面隔离,但在rWGS反应后,这些纳米粒子从表面消失并重新分配到支撑体孔内。这表明金属-支撑体相互作用影响活性位点的分布和位置。
