[1] "Strong Lewis acid sites, on the other hand, induce alkane cracking via hydride abstraction and the generation of carbenium ion-activated complexes. Therefore, alkali metal promoters (K, Sn, Mg, Zn) are added to saturate the acid sites of the support and mitigate sintering."  

[2] "The type of alumina used depends on their acidic and morphological properties: α- and θ-alumina supports possess relatively less Brønsted and Lewis acid sites than γ-alumina and are more stable against sintering and coking but also have lower surface areas."

[3] "Strong Brønsted acid sites are also responsible for coking via direct alkane protonation and propylene condensation."

[4] "Lewis-acidic alumina with 5% SiO2 content (SASOL SIRALOX 5/320, specific surface area or SSA = 320 m2 g-1) proved to be a better support for CrOx than pure alumina (now loaded with the common 1.3 mmol of Cr gsupport-1)."

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that strong Lewis acid sites induce alkane cracking, so alkali promoters like K and Sn are used to saturate these sites and mitigate sintering. Different alumina supports are compared, with α- and θ-alumina having fewer acid sites and more stability against sintering/coking than γ-alumina but lower surface area. Strong Brønsted acid sites also cause coking via alkane protonation and propylene condensation. A SiO2-modified alumina support with 5% SiO2 is found to be better than pure alumina for supporting CrOx catalysts.

2. 是的,该文探究了调谐金属氧化物的氧化状态、氧迁移性以及酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它表明强路易斯酸位会引起烷烃裂解,因此使用碱金属促进剂如K和Sn来饱和这些位点并抑制烧结。比较了不同的氧化铝载体,α-氧化铝和θ-氧化铝具有比γ-氧化铝更少的酸位和更高的抗烧结/抗炭化性能,但表面积较低。强的勃氏酸位也会通过烷烃质子化和丙烯缩合引起炭化。添加了5% SiO2的氧化铝载体比纯氧化铝更适合负载CrOx催化剂。

[1] "For chromium oxides, there is no consensus: either via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism (40) or via MvK."  

[2] "For highly valent Cr oxide, the CH bond activation proceeds via a LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism of CH cleavage and H-abstraction."

[3] "For redox materials like V oxides, this occurs via a Marsvan Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, (36−38) in which the CH bond activation proceeds via a lattice oxygen abstracting a H atom from an adsorbed propane molecule coordinated with a neighbor lattice oxygen."

[4] "There, CO2 consumes surface hydride species and H2 via the reverse water gas shift (rWGS) reaction, (43,44) while the reverse Boudouard reaction reforms soft coke into CO, (45,46) with CO2 promoting propylene desorption, thus lowering coke formation."  

[5] "If dissociative chemisorption of CO2(g) competes with propane for the same active site, then it would seem we can increase the reactivity with a catalytic material capable of replenishing oxygen vacancies using bulk and neighbor lattice oxygen."

3. Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts. For chromium oxides, propane dehydrogenation may occur via either a Langmuir-Hinshelwood or a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, with CH bond cleavage and H abstraction. For vanadium oxides and other redox materials, a MvK mechanism is proposed where lattice oxygen abstracts H from adsorbed propane. For non-redox catalysts like Pt or reduced metal oxides like Cr3+, CO2 consumes surface hydrides and reforms coke via reverse Boudouard reaction, while promoting propylene desorption to lower coking. The article also suggests increasing reactivity by using materials that can replenish oxygen vacancies via bulk lattice oxygen mobility.

3. 是的,该文为所研究的金属氧化物催化剂提出了丙烷脱氢的机理场景。 对于铬氧化物,丙烷脱氢可能通过朗缪尔-辛舍尔伍德机理或马氏文-克列文机理(MvK)进行,伴随CH键断裂和H的抽离。 对于钒氧化物和其他有重氧化还原性的材料,提出了MvK机理,其中晶格氧从吸附的丙烷分子上抽离H原子。 对于Pt或还原后的金属氧化物(如Cr3+)等非氧化还原型催化剂,CO2会消耗表面氢化物并通过反布杜阿尔反应改造焦炭,同时促进丙烯解吸以降低炭化。 文献还提出,使用能通过体相氧的迁移补充氧空位的材料来增加反应活性。
