[1] "Inspired by the positive effects of the enlarged distance between the particles [28] and the nanoparticulated support [29] on reducing the sintering, in this contribution, the loading of Pt was reduced to 0.1 wt% and the commercial nano-Al2O3 was chosen as the support, on which the Sn could be dispersed as single atoms, serving as nucleation sites [30] for inhibiting the sintering of Pt nanoparticles."

[2] "The PtSn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst with a narrow PtSn size distribution at 1 nm, achieved an excellent productivity as high as 47.6 molC3H6 gPt−1 h−1 and exhibited an extremely stable behavior after a quick structural reconstruction."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It reduces the Pt loading to 0.1 wt% and uses nano-Al2O3 support to disperse Sn as single atoms that serve as nucleation sites to inhibit sintering of Pt nanoparticles. This results in a narrow PtSn size distribution around 1 nm and high productivity and stability.

[1] "By virtue of the characterization results of the aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning-transmission electron microscopy (AC-HAADF-STEM), in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy by using CO as the probe molecule (CO-DRIFTS), and theoretical calculations based on stochastic surface walking (SSW) method combined with the density functional theory (DFT), a clear profile of the atomic configuration evolution of the active sites of the PtSn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst during PDH reaction is delineated."

[2] "To further monitor the evolutions of the valence state and local structure of the Pt and Sn, the XAS spectra including XANES and EXAFS were collected at the different stages during the reaction process."

[3] "In situ XPS spectra were collected on a ThermoFisher Excalab 250Xi+ instrument."

[4] "In situ CO-DRIFTS were collected by an infrared spectrometer (Vertex 70, Bruker), equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride detector in the range 400–4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1."
