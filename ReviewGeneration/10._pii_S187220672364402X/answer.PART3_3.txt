[1] "In this contribution, the loading of Pt was reduced to 0.1 wt% and the commercial nano-Al2O3 was chosen as the support, on which the Sn could be dispersed as single atoms, serving as nucleation sites [30] for inhibiting the sintering of Pt nanoparticles."

[2] "To confirm the interactions between Pt and Sn in the reduced 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3, the in situ XPS was conducted." 

[3] "The Pt L3-edge were recorded at room temperature in the transmission or fluorescence mode, based on the energy calibration of Pt foil."

[4] "The Sn K-edge was collected in situ due to its highly sensitive property to oxygen [32]."

[5] "In situ XPS spectra were collected on a ThermoFisher Excalab 250Xi+ instrument."

[6] "In situ CO-DRIFTS were collected by an infrared spectrometer (Vertex 70, Bruker), equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride detector in the range 400–4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1."
