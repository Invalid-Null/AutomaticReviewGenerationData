To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key points extracted from each answer file to the reference correct answers. I calculated the consistency ratio as the percentage of key points from an answer file that were consistent with the reference. Some answers contained additional irrelevant information, but I focused on evaluating the correct key points rather than penalizing extra details. Overall I found high consistency across the answer files in identifying the key information relevant to responding accurately to each question.
