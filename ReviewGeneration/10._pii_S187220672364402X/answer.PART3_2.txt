[1] "The PtSn/Al2O3 is prepared by an industrially favorable co-impregnation method."

[2] "By combining complementary in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that a highly productive Sn1Pt single-atom alloy (47.6 molC3H6 gPt1 h1) forms after the reduction, and thereby self-assembles to the Pt3Sn intermetallic compound during the reaction, which exhibits a rather stable performance (kd-1040h: 0.0026 h1)."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it uses a co-impregnation method to prepare a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst with a Sn1Pt single-atom alloy that shows high productivity. The single-atom alloy then evolves into a Pt3Sn intermetallic compound that exhibits stable performance.

[2] "To further monitor the evolutions of the valence state and local structure of the Pt and Sn, the XAS spectra including XANES and EXAFS were collected at the different stages during the reaction process."

[3] "In situ CO-DRIFTS experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the absorption bands at 2070 and 1840 cm1 are seen on the reduced monometallic 0.1Pt/nano-Al2O3, which could be ascribed to linear CO adsorption on the under-coordinated Pt atoms and the bridged CO absorption on the Pt nanoparticles, respectively [51]."

[1] "The atomic configuration and size distributions of the samples were characterized by the AC-HAADF-STEM."

[2] "The AC-HAADF-STEM images and EDS mapping of the reduced 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 show that the Pt atoms aggregate to nanoclusters interspersed by a small fraction of Sn species, while the majority of Sn are still distributed as single atoms on the support (Figs. 2(d)-(f) and Fig. S5)."

[1] "To further monitor the evolutions of the valence state and local structure of the Pt and Sn, the XAS spectra including XANES and EXAFS were collected at the different stages during the reaction process." 

[2] "Fig. 3(c) shows the normalized XANES spectra at Pt L3-edge with the Pt foil as reference. It is found that the white lines of the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 catalysts are all lower than that of the Pt foil, which could be contributed to the electron transfer from Sn to Pt [32]."

[3] "To make the structure of the PtSn alloy clearer, in situ XAS of the Sn at K-edge of the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst was further collected (Fig. 3(e)). Distinguished from the SnO2, the profile of the XANES spectrum of Sn in the reduced 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 is similar with the SnO and Sn foil, suggesting that the average valence state of Sn in the reduced 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 might be between 0 and +2."

6. Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it uses in-situ XANES and EXAFS to monitor changes in the Pt and Sn oxidation states and local structure during the reaction. The data reveals electron transfer from Sn to Pt and shows the average valence state of Sn changing as the catalyst evolves.
