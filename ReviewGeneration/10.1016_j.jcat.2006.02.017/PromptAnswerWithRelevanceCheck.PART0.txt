<Answer>

 Unfortunately, the literature provided does not contain relevant information to directly answer any of the specific questions asked. The article focuses on the dehydrogenation of propane over supported gallium oxide catalysts, particularly in the presence of CO2. It does not provide significant background on the broader importance and applications of propylene, discuss general catalyst mechanisms for propane dehydrogenation, introduce major catalyst classes explored, or present computational studies, microkinetic modeling, or structure-activity relationships.
