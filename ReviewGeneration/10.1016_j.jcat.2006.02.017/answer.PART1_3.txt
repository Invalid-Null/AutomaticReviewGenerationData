1. No, the article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3 or Pt-Sn for propane dehydrogenation. It only studies Ga2O3 supported on different metal oxides like TiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2 and MgO. It provides data on propane conversion and product selectivity over these catalysts.

[1] The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface.

[2] XPS studies show that the different behavior of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts may be attributed to the different interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species.

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning acid-base properties and metal-support interactions of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation. It shows that high dehydrogenation activity correlates with abundant medium-strong acid sites. It also attributes the different behaviors of the Ga2O3 catalysts to differing Ga2O3-support interactions evidenced by XPS.

[1] It has been suggested that propane can be heterolytically dissociatively adsorbed on gallium oxide, forming gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species.

[2] Dehydrogenation proceeds on the supported gallium oxide catalysts probably through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway instead of a redox mechanism, similar to that on pure gallium oxide.

<English version answer>
3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the Ga2O3 catalysts studied. It suggests propane undergoes heterolytic dissociative adsorption on Ga2O3 to form gallium hydride and alkoxide species. Subsequent steps then lead to propene formation. This heterolytic pathway is preferred over a redox mechanism.

[1] XPS studies show that the different behavior of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts may be attributed to the different interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species.

[2] These different support effects may derive from the catalysts' differing H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, probably caused by the differing interactions between the gallium oxide and the support.

4. Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects in the Ga2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows differing Ga2O3-support interactions lead to differences in H2 adsorption, acid-base properties and overall catalysis. This modulates catalytic activity and product selectivity.
