<English version answer>
1. No, the article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3 or Pt-Sn for propane dehydrogenation. It only studies Ga2O3 supported on different metal oxides like TiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, and MgO.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
1. 这篇文章没有评价Cr2O3或Pt-Sn等有前景的金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它只研究了不同金属氧化物作为载体的Ga2O3催化剂,比如TiO2、Al2O3、ZrO2、SiO2和MgO。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface.
[2] Therefore, the emergence of the high temperature peaks can be attributed to the introduction of gallium oxide on the supports.
[3] Meanwhile, the impregnation of gallium oxide on the supports also significantly increased the total amount of surface acid sites, especially those of medium-strong acid strength (expressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 350600C), which are suggested to be active for the dehydrogenation reaction [16].
</quotes>

<English version answer> 
2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning acid-base properties affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that catalysts with more medium-strong acid sites (desorbing NH3 between 350-600C) like Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3 and Ga2O3/TiO2 exhibit higher propane dehydrogenation activity. This is attributed to the gallium oxide species interacting strongly with the supports to generate those acid sites.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
2. 是的,文章研究了调节酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它显示含有更多中等强度酸点(在350-600°C脱附氨)的催化剂,比如Ga2O3/ZrO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3 和 Ga2O3/TiO2,表现出更高的丙烷脱氢活性。这是由于氧化镓种与载体发生强相互作用,生成这些酸点。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] It has been suggested that propane can be heterolytically dissociatively adsorbed on gallium oxide, forming gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species [24]; the same process may occur over supported gallium oxide catalysts.
[2] The alkoxides further decompose to form the dehydrogenation products.
[3] Propene then results from the equilibrium.
[4] Dehydrogenation proceeds on the supported gallium oxide catalysts probably through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway instead of a redox mechanism, similar to that on pure gallium oxide.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the studied Ga2O3 catalysts. It suggests propane undergoes heterolytic dissociative adsorption on Ga species to form gallium hydride and alkoxide intermediates. The alkoxide then decomposes to give the dehydrogenated product propene, which is in equilibrium with a propyl carbenium ion that can exchange protons with the catalyst surface. The overall pathway does not involve a redox mechanism.  
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
3. 是的,文章提出了研究的Ga2O3催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机理场景。它认为丙烷在镓种上发生异裂解吸附,形成镓氢化物和烷氧化物中间体。烷氧化物进一步分解生成脱氢产物丙烯,后者与丙基碳正离子达成平衡,该离子可以与催化剂表面交换质子。整个途径不涉及氧化还原机理。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] XPS studies showed abundant reduced gallium atoms (45%) on the surface of Ga2O3/TiO2, which may account for this catalyst's unique catalytic behavior in the dehydrogenation reaction in the presence of CO2. 
[2] These different support effects may derive from the catalysts' differing H2 adsorption capacities and acidbase properties, probably caused by the differing interactions between the gallium oxide and the support.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
4. Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects. It shows Ga2O3/TiO2 has a unique behavior of enhanced propane dehydrogenation with CO2, while other supports like Al2O3 and ZrO2 exhibit decreased activity. This is attributed to the TiO2 support interacting with Ga2O3 to generate partially reduced Ga species and stronger H2 adsorption capacity, which facilitates the reverse water gas shift reaction to promote dehydrogenation.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 
4. 是的,文章探讨了金属-载体界面效应。它显示Ga2O3/TiO2在CO2存在下表现出增强的丙烷脱氢活性,而其他载体如Al2O3 和 ZrO2的催化剂活性降低。这是因TiO2载体与Ga2O3发生作用,生成部分还原态镓种和更强的H2吸附能力,有利于反向水煤气转移反应来促进脱氢。

2. Yes, the article investigates how acid-base properties of the metal oxide supports affect propane dehydrogenation performance over the supported Ga2O3 catalysts. It shows that catalysts with more medium-strong acid sites like Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3 and Ga2O3/TiO2 exhibit higher propane conversion than Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO which have weaker acid sites. Basic sites are also needed for propane adsorption.

<English version answer>

3. Yes, the article proposes that propane dehydrogenation proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation pathway over the supported Ga2O3 catalysts, similar to pure Ga2O3. It describes a mechanistic sequence where propane dissociatively chemisorbs on Ga2O3 sites to form gallium hydride and alkoxide species. The alkoxide then decomposes to give the alkene product, with the dehydrogenation rate enhanced by proton transfer from the support's acidic sites to the alkoxide intermediate.

4. Yes, the article explores the effect of metal-support interactions in the supported Ga2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that Ga2O3/TiO2 with partially reduced Ga species from strong metal-support interaction exhibits uniquely enhanced activity in presence of CO2 compared to other supports like Al2O3 and ZrO2 where Ga is fully oxidized. The varying extent of metal-support interface modulates propane adsorption strength and subsequent conversion over the catalysts.
