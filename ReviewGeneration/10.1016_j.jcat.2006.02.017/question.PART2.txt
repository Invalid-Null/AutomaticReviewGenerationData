Support effect in dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 over supported gallium oxide catalysts
Abstract
Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane. The conversions of propane over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts at 600C reached 23, 33, and 39%, respectively. The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface. Carbon dioxide can promote the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppress those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. The conversion of propane becomes 32, 26, and 30% in the presence of CO2 over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts, respectively. Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst. XPS studies show that the different behavior of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts may be attributed to the different interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species. The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway.
1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene is of increasing importance due to the growing demand for propene, which is an important raw material in the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction; therefore, relatively high reaction temperatures are needed to obtain high propane yields. The high reaction temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to form light alkanes and alkenes, leading to decreased product yield and increased catalyst deactivation. Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propene selectivity of the catalytic reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the overoxidation of propane.
Recently, catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been attempted [1], [2]. The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the reaction has been observed on many catalysts, including silica-supported Cr2O3 [1], [2], rare earth vanadates [3], and Ga2O3 [4]. Because carbon dioxide is one of the major greenhouse gases, the use of carbon dioxide is attractive not only economically, but also ecologically.
Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied intensively in the last decade. The role of gallium oxide in the aromatization reaction is thought to facilitate the dehydrogenation steps, including the dehydrogenation of alkanes, higher olefins, and cycloolefins [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. More recently, it has been found that carbon dioxide can markedly promote the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane over gallium oxide or supported gallium oxide catalysts [4], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. But this promotional effect was not observed over all of the supported gallium oxide catalysts; in fact, the dehydrogenation reaction was sometimes inhibited, such as over γ-Al2O3-supported Ga2O3 catalyst [12]. The reason for this unusual support effect remains still unclear. In addition, researchers have not yet reached agreement on the main role of carbon dioxide in reactions. Nakagawa et al. proposed CO2-promoted desorption of olefin products from the catalyst surface [12], and Michorczyk et al. considered CO2-consumed hydrogen via a reverse watergas shift reaction [13]. In previous work we found that the reverse watergas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction of CO2 may account for the enhanced catalytic activity and stability over Ga2O3 catalysts [16].
In the present work, five different supported gallium oxide catalysts Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2, and Ga2O3/MgO were prepared and characterized. Their catalytic performance for dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 was investigated, as was the support effect as well as the role of CO2. Finally, a probable mechanism of the reaction over supported gallium oxide catalysts was proposed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
ZrO2 and MgO were prepared by adding an aqueous solution of ammonia into ZrOCl2 and Mg(NO3)2 solutions, respectively, followed by aging overnight, filtering, washing, drying, and calcining at 600C for 6 h. TiO2 (Degussa P25), γ-Al2O3, and SiO2 were purchased directly and used with no further treatment.
Supported gallium oxide catalysts containing 5 wt% Ga2O3 were prepared by impregnating an aqueous solution of Ga(NO3)3xH2O (Aldrich) on TiO2, γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, or MgO using an incipient wetness method. The impregnated samples were dried at 100C and calcined at 600C for 6 h in air flow. The catalysts thus obtained were designated as Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2, and Ga2O3/MgO.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The specific surface areas of the catalysts were measured by nitrogen adsorption at
using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument and calculated by the BET method. Surface acidity was measured by NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) in a flow-type fixed-bed reactor at ambient pressure, and surface basicity was measured by CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) with a similar apparatus. A 100-mg sample was preheated at 600C for 3 h, and then cooled to 120C in flowing He. At this temperature, sufficient pulses of NH3 or CO2 were injected until adsorption saturation occurred, followed by purging with He for 2 h. The temperature was then raised from 120 to 600C at a rate of 10C/min, and the NH3 or CO2 desorbed was collected in a liquid N2 trap and detected by on-line gas chromatography. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out on a Micromeritics TPD/TPR 2900 instrument using 25 mg of catalyst under a mixed gas flow (40 ml/min) of hydrogen (10%) and argon (90%). The catalyst was pretreated in N2 flow at 300C for 3 h. The temperature was increased from 50 to 600C at a ramp rate of 10C/min. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to monitor the hydrogen consumed during the TPR experiments. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using
radiation (1486.6 eV) on a PerkinElmer PHI 5000C ESAC system with a base pressure of
. The sample was pressed and degassed in the pretreatment chamber for 2 h before being transferred to the analysis chamber for XPS measurement. All binding energy (BE) values were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. H2 and propane chemical adsorption measurements were carried out on a Micromeritics TPD/TPR 2900 instrument using 500 mg of catalyst under a argon gas flow (40 ml/min). The temperature was raised from room temperature to 600C at a rate of 10C/min, maintained at 600C for 2 h, and then cooled to the adsorption temperature (300C). For H2 adsorption, several pulses of the mixed gas (10% hydrogen and 90% argon) with fixed volume were introduced until no more H2 was adsorbed on the catalyst. For propane adsorption, when in the absence of CO2, several pulses of propane with fixed volume were injected until no more propane was adsorbed on the catalyst. While in the presence of CO2, the experiment conducted in the gas flow contained 5 vol% CO2 and the balance argon instead of pure argon.
2.3. Reaction testing
Catalytic tests were performed in a fixed-bed flow microreactor at atmospheric pressure, with nitrogen as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 ml/min. The catalyst load was 200 mg, and it was activated at the reaction temperature (600C) for 1 h in nitrogen flow before the reaction. For dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of carbon dioxide, the gas reactant contained 2.5 vol% propane and the balance nitrogen. For the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide, the gas reactant contained 2.5 vol% propane, 5 vol% carbon dioxide, and the balance nitrogen.
The hydrocarbon reaction products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph equipped with a 6-m packed column of Porapak Q and a flame ionization detector. The gas products, including N2, CO, and CO2, were analyzed on-line by another chromatograph equipped with a 2-m packed column of carbon molecular sieve 601 and a TCD. The conversion and selectivity were calculated as follows:
2.4. Pulse reaction
Pulse tests were carried out on a fixed-bed pulse microreactor. The catalyst load for the test was 200 mg. For CO2 and H2 pulse testing, the catalyst was pretreated with He for 1 h at reaction temperature, after which a pulse of CO2 and H2 gas mixture (1:1 molar ratio; 2.0 ml) was injected. For CO2 pulse reaction, the catalyst was first pretreated at the reaction temperature (600C) in He for 1 h and then in H2 for 30 min; then He was used to purge the pulse reaction system for 10 min to remove H2. Finally, a pulse of CO2 (2.0 ml) was injected. He, at a flow rate of 20 ml/min, was used as the carrier gas.
The products of the pulse reaction were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph equipped with a 2-m packed column of carbon molecular sieve 601 and a TCD. The reaction data in the work were reproducible with a precision of
.
3. Results
3.1. Catalyst characterization
TiO2-, γ-Al2O3-, ZrO2-, SiO2-, and MgO-supported gallium oxide catalysts containing 5 wt% Ga2O3 were prepared by an incipient wetness method. Their powder X-ray diffraction patterns were measured. No other diffraction peaks but those of the supports were observed, indicating that gallium oxide was well dispersed on all of the supports. TPR experiments were also carried out to study the reducibility of these catalysts. No reduction peaks could be identified in the TPR profiles, suggesting that the supported gallium oxide catalysts cannot be reduced by hydrogen below 600C.
The surface acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD; the results are given in Table 1, together with those of the supports for comparison. All of the supports exhibited only one broad peak on the TPD profiles, in the range of 228327C, indicating that the acid sites of the supports are of weak to medium strength. The acidity of the supports was modified significantly after being impregnated with gallium oxide. Evidently there were two desorption peaks on the TPD profiles of all of the supported gallium oxide catalysts. The low temperature peaks at about 218313C and the high peaks at 392442C corresponded to the weak and strong acid sites of the samples. The low temperature peaks were similar to those of the supports; therefore the emergence of the high temperature peaks can be attributed to the introduction of gallium oxide on the supports. Meanwhile, the impregnation of gallium oxide on the supports also significantly increased the total amount of surface acid sites, especially those of medium-strong acid strength (expressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 350600C), which are suggested to be active for the dehydrogenation reaction [16]. The amount of medium to strong acid sites of the catalysts has the following sequence: Ga2O3/ZrO2 > Ga2O3/Al2O3 > Ga2O3/TiO2 > Ga2O3/SiO2 > Ga2O3/MgO.

The surface basicity of the supports and the supported gallium oxide catalysts were measured by CO2-TPD. One broad CO2 desorption peak was observed for all of the supports as well as the supported gallium oxide catalysts; the peak temperature and amount of desorbed CO2 of all samples are summarized in Table 2. There was a much smaller number of basic sites than of acidic sites on all of the supported gallium oxide catalysts except for Ga2O3/MgO, possibly due to the relatively strong basic property of the MgO support. Therefore, the supported gallium oxides except Ga2O3/MgO are primarily acid catalysts. The sequence of increasing amount of basic sites on the catalyst surface was Ga2O3/MgO > Ga2O3/ZrO2 > Ga2O3/γ-Al2O3 > Ga2O3/TiO2  Ga2O3/SiO2.

The XPS spectra of supported gallium oxide catalysts were recorded. The deconvoluted spectra in the Ga 3d region are shown in Fig. 1. Only two peaks appear in the spectra of the Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, at about 24 and 21 eV, respectively, which can be assigned to O 2s and Ga3+ 3d bands according to the literature [17]. The Ga 3d banding energy was increased when gallium oxide was supported on ZrO2 or Al2O3, indicating a strong interaction between the Ga2O3 species and the ZrO2 or Al2O3 support, in accordance with previously reported results [18], [19]. A low-energy peak (LBE) at 19.6 eV appeared in the spectrum of Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/SiO2, and Ga2O3/MgO catalysts, which can be attributed to the presence of
species (
) [20], suggesting that Ga2O3 was partially reduced on these supports. Similar results have been reported previously [21], and the decrease of Ga 3d binding energy of the gallium species in the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst has been tentatively attributed to desorption of some loosely bound surface oxygen atoms at high calcination temperatures. The relative ratios of the Ga3+ and
species of the three catalysts were calculated and the percentage of
species was found to decrease in the order Ga2O3/TiO2  Ga2O3/MgO  Ga2O3/SiO2. The XPS results are summarized in Table 3.

3.2. Catalytic activity
Dehydrogenation of propane over supported gallium oxide catalysts in the absence of CO2 was carried out at 600C; the results, along with the BET surface areas of the catalysts, are given in Table 4 and Fig. 2. The major product formed in the reaction was propene, and the minor products were methane, ethane, and ethylene. As Fig. 2 clearly shows, the catalytic behaviors of the five supported gallium oxide catalysts in the reaction differ considerably. The initial conversion of propane on the catalysts decreases in the order Ga2O3/ZrO2 > Ga2O3/Al2O3 > Ga2O3/TiO2 > Ga2O3/SiO2 > Ga2O3/MgO, paralleling the sequence of the amount of medium to strong acid sites and indicating that surface acidity should play an important role in dehydrogenation. For all catalysts, propane conversion decreased along with the reaction time, but the decrease was much slower on the Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/MgO, and Ga2O3/SiO2 catalysts than on the Ga2O3/TiO2 and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts. Catalyst deactivation is commonly attributed to the formation of coke on the catalyst surface.

The dehydrogenation of propane was also run over the supported gallium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 at 600C; the reaction data are summarized in Table 5 and Fig. 3. CO was detected in the reaction product. The addition of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction has different effects on the Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/SiO2, and Ga2O3/MgO catalysts. The initial activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 in the presence of CO2 was much higher than that in the absence of CO2; in contrast, that of Ga2O3/Al2O3 and Ga2O3/ZrO2 was reduced in the presence of CO2, whereas for Ga2O3/MgO and Ga2O3/SiO2, CO2 seemed to have little effect on initial dehydrogenation activity. The initial conversion of propane on the catalysts in the presence of CO2 decreased in the following order: Ga2O3/TiO2 > Ga2O3/ZrO2 > Ga2O3/Al2O3 > Ga2O3/SiO2 > Ga2O3/MgO.

The amount of initial CO2 conversion on the catalysts was in the order Ga2O3/TiO2  Ga2O3/ZrO2  Ga2O3/Al2O3  Ga2O3/SiO2  Ga2O3/MgO, indicating that evidently CO2 participated in dehydrogenation only over Ga2O3/TiO2 and Ga2O3/ZrO2. It has been reported that the dehydrogenation reaction can be influenced by CO2 through the reverse watergas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction [16], as follows:
(1)
CO2 + H2  CO + H2O
and
(2)
CO2 + C  2CO.
The conversion of CO2 in reactions (1), (2) can be estimated from the amount of CO and CO2 before and after the reaction, as follows:

The results, given in Table 6, indicate that the effect of adding CO2 differs among the five catalysts. For Ga2O3/TiO2, CO2 is consumed mainly through the reverse watergas shift reaction, which may account for the enhancement of the dehydrogenation activity; whereas for Ga2O3/ZrO2, the main role of CO2 becomes the elimination of coke by the Boudouard reaction, which may account for the enhancement of stability of Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalyst after the addition of CO2 (Fig. 2, Fig. 3).

3.3. Effect of the CO2/C3H8 ratio on the dehydrogenation of propane
The effect of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation of propane over supported gallium oxide catalysts was also studied; the results are shown in Fig. 4. Propane conversion over Ga2O3/TiO2 initially increased with the CO2/C3H8 ratio, reaching its peak when the CO2/C3H8 ratio equaled 2, then decreased with further increases in the CO2/C3H8 ratio. In contrast, propane conversion over Ga2O3/Al2O3 and Ga2O3/ZrO2 decreased continuously with increasing CO2/C3H8 ratio, dramatically at the beginning and more slowly later on. In Ga2O3/MgO and Ga2O3/SiO2, the increase in CO2/C3H8 ratio had only a limited negative effect on propane conversion at first.

3.4. Pulse reaction
To obtain more information on the dehydrogenation of propane over various supported gallium oxide catalysts, CO2 and H2 pulse reaction, as well as CO2 pulse reaction, were carried out. The results of the CO2 and H2 pulse reaction are shown in Fig. 5. The process is the reverse watergas shift reaction, as shown in reaction (1). As shown in the figure, all of the supported gallium oxide catalysts except Ga2O3/SiO2 displayed high activity for the reverse watergas shift reaction, with activity increasing with increasing reaction temperature for all catalysts. At 600C, the extent of activity followed the order Ga2O3/ZrO2 > Ga2O3/TiO2  Ga2O3/MgO > Ga2O3/Al2O3  Ga2O3/SiO2.

The reverse watergas shift reaction can proceed only when both H2 and CO2 are adsorbed on the catalyst surface, as reported previously [22]. Purportedly, H2 can be dissociatively adsorbed on gallium oxide and supported gallium oxide [20], [23]; meanwhile, basic sites are also needed to adsorb CO2. Therefore, the low activity of the reverse watergas shift reaction over Ga2O3/SiO2 can be attributed to its small amount of basic sites (Table 2).
CO2 pulse reaction was also applied for further research. The results are illustrated in Fig. 6. When the supported gallium oxide catalyst was pretreated with H2 for 30 min, a certain amount of H2 was heterolytically dissociatively adsorbed on the catalyst surface [24], with the rate constant of
as shown in reaction (3). Then the catalyst was treated with He for 10 min to remove H2 in the reaction system. (That a certain amount of the chemisorbed H2 desorbed simultaneously from the catalyst surface via the reverse reaction with the rate constant of
was unavoidable, however.) Finally, a sufficient pulse of CO2 was injected to react with H2 remaining on the catalyst surface, with the rate constant of
:
(3)
Because Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/MgO are good catalysts for the reverse watergas shift reaction, and because the amount of CO2 injected is much larger than that of adsorbed H2, the amount of CO produced through reaction (3) should connect directly with the amount of adsorbed H2 remaining after purging with He for 10 min. The more CO produced, the more adsorbed H2 remaining, and hence the smaller the
. Therefore, the CO2 pulse reaction results suggest that the
of Ga2O3/TiO2 is much smaller than that of Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/MgO.

3.5. H2 and propane chemisorption test
To gain more information on the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation reaction, the H2 and propane chemisorption capacity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts was measured; the results are given in Table 7, Table 8. The tables show that at 300C, the H2 chemisorption capacity of Ga2O3/TiO2 was much higher than that of the other four catalysts, indicating that the chemisorbed H2 over Ga2O3/TiO2 is more stable and difficult to desorb, in agreement with the results of the pulse reactions.

The special H2 adsorption property of Ga2O3/TiO2 reported earlier may be connected to the abundant reduced gallium atoms on the Ga2O3/TiO2 surface (45%), because reduced gallium ions (
cations,
) are thought to have higher dehydrogenation efficiency [25], and a galliumhydrogen bond can be formed on these reduced gallium ions by heterolytic hydrogen dissociation and can be stabilized on the support surface [20]. Only a small fraction or even no reduced gallium species could be detected on the other four supported gallium oxide catalysts, leading to the rapid desorption of H2 on the surface.
The results also show that the propane adsorption capacity decreased when CO2 was introduced to all catalyst except Ga2O3/SiO2, which had a very low adsorption capacity. This decrease may be due to displacement of adsorbed propane by the CO2 introduced, because CO2 is obviously much more acidic than propane and thus much more readily adsorbed on the basic catalyst sites. But on Ga2O3/SiO2, only a very small number of basic sites were detected by CO2-TPD, indicating the catalyst's weak CO2 adsorption ability; therefore, adding CO2 in the gas flow has hardly any effect on this catalyst's propane adsorption capacity.
4. Discussion
The dehydrogenation of propane or ethane over reducible metal oxide catalysts, such as chromium and iron oxides, in the presence of CO2 has been suggested to follow a redox mechanism [26], [27]. Propane is oxidized to propene with the simultaneous reduction of metal oxide (e.g., Fe2O3, Cr2O3), and subsequently the reduced metal oxide catalyst is reoxidized by CO2. According to our experimental results, supported gallium oxide catalysts cannot be reduced under the reaction temperature, and thus the redox mechanism is probably inapplicable for this reaction. It has been suggested that propane can be heterolytically dissociatively adsorbed on gallium oxide, forming gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species [24]; the same process may occur over supported gallium oxide catalysts, as follows:
(4)
The alkoxides further decompose to form the dehydrogenation products,
(5)
and
(6)
Step (5) is slow and represents the limiting step in propene formation [24]. When both Ga2O3 and H+ are present on the catalyst, the propyl carbenium ion on Ga2O3 will readily exchange with a proton via a surface migration reaction [24],
(7)
in which S represents catalyst surface. Propene then results from the equilibrium,
(8)
The conjugated effect of gallium oxide and proton increases propane dehydrogenation activity by replacing the slow step (5) by the fast equilibria (7), (8). Therefore, the amount of proton existing on the surface of the supported gallium oxide catalyst should have a considerable effect on the dehydrogenation activity.
The above reaction mechanism gives a good explanation for the different activities of the five supported gallium oxide catalysts toward the dehydrogenation reaction in the absence of CO2, that is, the high activity of Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/TiO2, and Ga2O3/Al2O3 and the low activity of Ga2O3/MgO and Ga2O3/SiO2. NH3-TPD studies showed that the medium to strong acid sites are more abundant on the surface of Ga2O3/ZrO2, Ga2O3/TiO2, and Ga2O3/Al2O3 than on Ga2O3/MgO and Ga2O3/SiO2, which would facilitate the reactions (7), (8) to bypass the slow step (5), thus enhancing the activity of propane dehydrogenation. The amount of medium to strong acid sites has the order Ga2O3/ZrO2 > Ga2O3/Al2O3 > Ga2O3/TiO2 > Ga2O3/SiO2 > Ga2O3/MgO (Table 1), exactly the same order as for the initial activity.
When CO2 is introduced into the propane dehydrogenation reaction, chemisorbed H2 formed from steps (5), (7) can also be removed via an alternative route (9) (i.e., the reverse watergas shift reaction), besides step (6):
(9)
In fact, the major pathway of the removal of the dissociatively adsorbed H2 depends on the relative rate of steps (6), (9). Our pulse reaction tests and H2 chemisorption measurements indicate that step (6) is relatively slow over Ga2O3/TiO2. Therefore, the fast step (9) becomes the preferred reaction instead of the slow step (6) after CO2 is introduced, because Ga2O3/TiO2 has proven to be a good catalyst for the reverse watergas shift reaction, which transforms H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O, shifting the reactions (5), (7) to the product side and thus enhancing the total reaction rate. In contrast, step (6) is relatively fast over Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, and Ga2O3/MgO and thus will still be the dominant reaction pathway for the removal of chemisorbed H2 after introduction of CO2. Thus, the enhancement effect of CO2 on the total reaction rate is not evident for these catalysts. This can be further proven by the fact that the amount of CO2 reacted on Ga2O3/TiO2 via reaction (9) (
) is close to the conversion of propane (32%) in the initial state (because the molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 equals 2), whereas for Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, and Ga2O3/MgO catalysts, the amount of CO2 participating in the reverse watergas shift (9) is much lower than the conversion of propane (Table 5, Table 6). For Ga2O3/SiO2, because activity for the reverse watergas shift reaction is very low, it would be difficult for CO2 to react with the chemisorbed H2 over Ga2O3/SiO2, and thus a positive effect of CO2 would not be observed.
Meanwhile, CO2 has a negative effect on the reaction by displacing the propane adsorbed on the catalyst surface [4], [11]. Propane is dissociatively adsorbed on gallium oxide; basic sites are needed for the adsorption of
, and acidic sites are needed for the adsorption of H. Because CO2 is much more acidic than propane, the adsorption of CO2 on the basic sites would certainly reduce the possibility of the adsorption of propane on gallium oxide, leading to reduced propane conversion. This phenomenon is demonstrated by the greatly reduced adsorption capacity of propane over most supported catalysts after the introduction of CO2 (Table 8). For those catalysts with activity enhanced by the addition of CO2, such as Ga2O3/TiO2, the negative effect of CO2 displacement on the reaction is not as evident at a low concentration of CO2, and propane conversion increases with increasing CO2/C3H8 ratio. When the CO2 concentration increases, this negative effect becomes dominant, and the propane conversion begins to decrease. For such catalysts as Ga2O3/Al2O3 and Ga2O3/ZrO2, the addition of CO2 does not have a promoting effect on activity, the negative effect of CO2 will always prevail. This explains why the propane conversion over Ga2O3/TiO2 has a maximum with increasing CO2/C3H8 ratio, whereas the conversion over Ga2O3/Al2O3 and Ga2O3/ZrO2 decreases continuously from the very beginning with increasing CO2/C3H8 ratio (Fig. 4). For Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO, the rate-determining step (reaction (5)) is very slow, because there are insufficient protons to exchange with
via reaction (7) to circumvent this slow reaction. Therefore, the decreased rate of reaction (4) by the displacement of CO2 against propane would have only a limited negative effect on the rate-limiting step (5) (Fig. 4).
5. Conclusion
Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over five supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated, and distinct behaviors were observed. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 are better catalysts for the dehydrogenation reaction than Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO, because they contain many more acid sites of medium to strong and strong strength on the surface. CO2 has a promoting effect on dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but a negative effect over Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. These different support effects may derive from the catalysts' differing H2 adsorption capacities and acidbase properties, probably caused by the differing interactions between the gallium oxide and the support. XPS studies showed abundant reduced gallium atoms (45%) on the surface of Ga2O3/TiO2, which may account for this catalyst's unique catalytic behavior in the dehydrogenation reaction in the presence of CO2. Results for the pulse reaction and dehydrogenation reaction with varying partial pressures of CO2 indicate that CO2 plays two roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and a negative role by displacing propane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites. Dehydrogenation proceeds on the supported gallium oxide catalysts probably through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway instead of a redox mechanism, similar to that on pure gallium oxide.
