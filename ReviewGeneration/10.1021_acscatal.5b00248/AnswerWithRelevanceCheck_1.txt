          [1] "The synthesis of our zinc and cobalt catalysts is performed using the stable ammonia coordination complexes in water, followed by thermally dissociating the ammonia ligands." 

          [2] "In the case of iron, Tilley et al. prepared Fe3+ catalysts on SiO2 by grafting Fe[OSi(Ot-Bu)3]3 on SBA-15, followed by calcination to remove the remaining organic groups."

          [3] "Notestein et al. used the iron ethylene(diamine)tetraacetic acid (EDTA) complex to prepare highly-dispersed iron species on SiO2 surface and also removed the EDTA via calcination."

          [4] "Silica-supported iron oxide clusters were poorly active. Little conversion of propane was observed with the same amount of iron as in the tests of 1-FeII."

          Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like grafting organometallic precursors onto the silica surface and then removing ligands via calcination to generate isolated metal sites. It also compares isolated FeII species to iron oxide clusters and finds the isolated FeII has higher activity, indicating better dispersion.

          [1] "The XANES, Figure S2, and EXAFS spectra were also obtained at propane dehydrogenation reaction conditions and after cooling to room temperature."  

          [2] "The XANES spectrum of 1-FeoCp is shown in Figure 3. The pre-edge energy of both 1-FeoCp and 2-FeN* are 7112.9 eV, as listed in Table 1, consistent with FeII."

          [3] "Fitting of the EXAFS spectra gives four FeO bonds at a distance of 1.95 Å (Table 1)."
