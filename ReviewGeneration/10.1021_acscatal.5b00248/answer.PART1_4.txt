[1] "We propose two possible non-redox mechanisms for the dehydrogenation chemistry shown by 1-FeII (Figure 10). The initial step of both proposed mechanisms consists of heterolytic CH cleavage to form a metal alkyl and a SiOH, that is, a protonated FeOSi bond. This is followed by a rapid β-hydride elimination of the Fe alkyl to release propene."

[2] "Heterolytic cleavage of CH bonds has also been suggested by Weckhuysen et al. and Copret to be the activation mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation by Cr/Al2O3."

3. Yes, the article proposes two possible non-redox mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the isolated FeII/SiO2 catalyst studied. The proposed steps involve initial heterolytic C-H cleavage to generate a metal alkyl and protonated support, followed by β-hydride elimination to release propene. Prior work suggesting heterolytic C-H cleavage for Cr/Al2O3 ethane dehydrogenation is also noted.

3. 是的,文中为所研究的单点FeII/SiO2催化剂提出了两个可能的非氧化还原机理途径。提出的步骤首先包括异裂C-H键生成金属烷基和质子化载体,其次是β-氢消除释放丙烯。文中还提到之前的工作也建议Cr/Al2O3乙烷脱氢反应经历了异裂C-H键过程。

[2] "Heterolytic cleavage of CH bonds has also been suggested by Weckhuysen et al. and Copret to be the activation mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation by Cr/Al2O3. For catalysts proceeding through this mechanism, midtransition metals with partially occupied d shells should have a lower barrier to beta hydride elimination, which is the rate-determining step for Zn and Ga-based catalysts."

4. Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects for the isolated FeII/SiO2 catalyst. It proposes initial heterolytic C-H cleavage occurs at the Fe-O-Si interface to generate a metal alkyl and protonated support. It also notes that the metal-support interface enables non-redox dehydrogenation for Cr/Al2O3 systems, and that the interfacial geometry influences key steps like beta-hydride elimination.
