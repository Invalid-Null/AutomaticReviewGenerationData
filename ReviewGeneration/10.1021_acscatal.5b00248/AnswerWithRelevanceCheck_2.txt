         [1] "The synthesis of 1-FeoCp is self-controlled in terms of Fe loading because the excess precursor does not readily react with surface hydroxyls because of the steric bulk of the diene ligand." 

         [2] "For catalysts proceeding through this mechanism, midtransition metals with partially occupied d shells should have a lower barrier to beta hydride elimination, which is the rate-determining step for Zn (11, 13) and Ga-based (12) catalysts."

         [3] "The synthesis of our zinc and cobalt catalysts is performed using the stable ammonia coordination complexes in water, followed by thermally dissociating the ammonia ligands."

         [4] "In the case of iron, Tilley et al. prepared Fe3+ catalysts on SiO2 by grafting Fe[OSi(Ot-Bu)3]3 on SBA-15, followed by calcination to remove the remaining organic groups." 

         [5] "Notestein et al. used the iron ethylene(diamine)tetraacetic acid (EDTA) complex to prepare highly-dispersed iron species on SiO2 surface and also removed the EDTA via calcination."

         Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like grafting organometallic precursors onto the silica surface and then removing ligands via calcination to generate isolated metal sites. It also discusses how the electronic properties of the metal center affect the catalytic mechanism and activity.

         [1] "The catalyst was well sealed to keep the catalyst air-free during the whole catalytic testing."  

         [2] "The XANES, Figure S2, and EXAFS spectra were also obtained at propane dehydrogenation reaction conditions and after cooling to room temperature."

         [3] "The XANES, Figure S2, and EXAFS spectra were also obtained at propane dehydrogenation reaction conditions and after cooling to room temperature. Both spectra were identical to that in H2, showing only low-coordinate Fe(II) silicate species (see fits in Table 1)."

      <English>
         Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS) to study the working propane dehydrogenation catalysts under reaction conditions. This provides insights into the oxidation state and coordination environment of the active metal sites during catalysis.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         是的,该文利用了原位X射线吸收光谱(XANES 和 EXAFS)来研究反应条件下的丙烷脱氢化催化剂。这提供了对催化作用中活性金属位点的氧化态和配位环境的洞察。

         [1] "The XANES spectrum of 1-FeoCp is shown in Figure 3. The pre-edge energy of both 1-FeoCp and 2-FeN* are 7112.9 eV, as listed in Table 1, consistent with FeII."

         [2] "Upon treatment of 2-FeN* with H2 at 650 °C, the FeII reduced to metallic Fe0 nanoparticles (2-NP-Fe0). The XANES of 2-FeN* after H2 treatment at 650 °C clearly shows the shift to the metallic energy (7112.0 eV) and shape of the XANES (Figure 7a)."

      <English>
         Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES) to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows that the Fe species starts as Fe(II), but can be reduced to metallic Fe(0) under high temperature hydrogen treatment.
