[1] "In situ XANES and EXAFS measurements at the Fe K-edge (7.112 keV) were conducted on the bending magnet beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MRCAT, 10-BM) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. Ionization chambers were optimized at the midpoint of the Fe spectrum for the maximum current with linear response (1010 photons detected per second) using 35% He in N2 (15% absorption) in the incident X-ray detector and a mixture of 17% Ar in N2 (70% absorption) in the transmission X-ray detector. "
[2] "The XANES spectrum of 1-FeoCp is shown in Figure 3. The pre-edge energy of both 1-FeoCp and 2-FeN* are 7112.9 eV, as listed in Table 1, consistent with FeII (see Table S1 for the pre-edge energies of Fe(II) and Fe(III) reference compounds)."
[3] "X-ray absorption analysis of the Fe K-edge XANES energy was determined from the inflection point of the leading edge, by determination of the energy of the maximum in the first peak of the first derivative. EXAFS fits of the Fe/SiO2 catalysts were determined from experimental phase shift and backscattering amplitudes, which were obtained from the Fe(acac)3 (6 FeO at 1.99 Å)."
[4] "Catalytic tests of 1-FeII were performed under differential conversions of <10% (5%) initially to determine intrinsic rates at t = 0 h. The turnover frequency (TOF, h1), for example, the molecules of propane converted per hour per Fe ion, was calculated by assuming all Fe is active."
[5] "The XANES, Figure S2, and EXAFS spectra were also obtained at propane dehydrogenation reaction conditions and after cooling to room temperature. Both spectra were identical to that in H2, showing only low-coordinate Fe(II) silicate species (see fits in Table 1)."

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS) to study the oxidation state and coordination environment of iron species during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Quotes [1]-[3] describe the experimental setup and data analysis techniques. Quotes [4]-[5] show that these techniques were used to confirm that the active iron species remained as isolated Fe(II) under reaction conditions.

5. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation. There are no relevant quotes or discussion of this topic.

6. No, the article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. There are no relevant quotes or examples of this.

7. No, the article does not investigate zeolitic supports or metal encapsulation methods. There are no relevant quotes or examples of this.

8. No, the article does not evaluate techniques aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. There are no relevant quotes or examples of this.
