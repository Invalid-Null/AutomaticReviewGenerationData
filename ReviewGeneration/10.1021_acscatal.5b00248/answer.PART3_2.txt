<quotes>
[1] "The synthesis of 1-FeoCp is self-controlled in terms of Fe loading because the excess precursor does not readily react with surface hydroxyls because of the steric bulk of the diene ligand."

[2] "For catalysts proceeding through this mechanism, midtransition metals with partially occupied d shells should have a lower barrier to beta hydride elimination, which is the rate-determining step for Zn (11, 13) and Ga-based (12) catalysts."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using an organometallic precursor with bulky ligands (Quote 1) to control the number of surface sites for Fe grafting. It also discusses how the electronic properties of the metal center affect the catalytic mechanism and activity (Quote 2).

[1] "The XANES spectrum of 1-FeoCp is shown in Figure 3. The pre-edge energy of both 1-FeoCp and 2-FeN* are 7112.9 eV, as listed in Table 1, consistent with FeII." 

[2] "The catalyst was treated for 30 min in flowing H2 at 400 and 650 °C and in propane/He at 650 °C. After treatment at elevated temperature, the catalysts were cooled in the flowing gas and measured at room temperature without exposure to air."

[3] "The XANES, Figure S2, and EXAFS spectra were also obtained at propane dehydrogenation reaction conditions and after cooling to room temperature. Both spectra were identical to that in H2, showing only low-coordinate Fe(II) silicate species (see fits in Table 1)."

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS) to study propane dehydrogenation catalysts under reaction conditions and after treatment at high temperatures (Quotes 1-3). This reveals insights into the oxidation state and coordination environment of the active Fe species during catalysis.

[2] "Upon treatment of 2-FeN* with H2 at 650 °C, the FeII reduced to metallic Fe0 nanoparticles (2-NP-Fe0). The XANES of 2-FeN* after H2 treatment at 650 °C clearly shows the shift to the metallic energy (7112.0 eV) and shape of the XANES (Figure 7a)."

<English version answer>
6. Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows that the Fe species starts as Fe(II) (Quote 1), but can be reduced to metallic Fe(0) under high temperature hydrogen treatment (Quote 2).
