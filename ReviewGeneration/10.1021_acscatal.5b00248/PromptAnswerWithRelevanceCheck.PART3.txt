[1] "In situ XANES and EXAFS measurements at the Fe K-edge (7.112 keV) were conducted on the bending magnet beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MRCAT, 10-BM) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. Ionization chambers were optimized at the midpoint of the Fe spectrum for the maximum current with linear response (1010 photons detected per second) using 35% He in N2 (15% absorption) in the incident X-ray detector and a mixture of 17% Ar in N2 (70% absorption) in the transmission X-ray detector. "
[2] "The XANES spectrum of 1-FeoCp is shown in Figure 3. The pre-edge energy of both 1-FeoCp and 2-FeN* are 7112.9 eV, as listed in Table 1, consistent with FeII (see Table S1 for the pre-edge energies of Fe(II) and Fe(III) reference compounds)."
[3] "X-ray absorption analysis of the Fe K-edge XANES energy was determined from the inflection point of the leading edge, by determination of the energy of the maximum in the first peak of the first derivative. EXAFS fits of the Fe/SiO2 catalysts were determined from experimental phase shift and backscattering amplitudes, which were obtained from the Fe(acac)3 (6 FeO at 1.99 Å)."
[4] "Catalytic tests of 1-FeII were performed under differential conversions of <10% (5%) initially to determine intrinsic rates at t = 0 h. The turnover frequency (TOF, h1), for example, the molecules of propane converted per hour per Fe ion, was calculated by assuming all Fe is active."
[5] "The XANES, Figure S2, and EXAFS spectra were also obtained at propane dehydrogenation reaction conditions and after cooling to room temperature. Both spectra were identical to that in H2, showing only low-coordinate Fe(II) silicate species (see fits in Table 1)."
