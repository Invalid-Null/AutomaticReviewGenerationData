 Unfortunately this literature does not provide sufficient information to adequately answer the questions asked. The abstract indicates it is about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2, and introduces a high-entropy intermetallic catalyst for this reaction. However, it does not provide background on propane dehydrogenation kinetics and mechanisms or discuss prior computational and experimental work in this area. Since the questions relate to fundamental aspects of propane dehydrogenation that are not covered in this work, I cannot provide substantive answers based on the given text. The most relevant information is the following:
