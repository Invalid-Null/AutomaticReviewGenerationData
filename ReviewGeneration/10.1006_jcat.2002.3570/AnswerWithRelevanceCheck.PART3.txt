 ※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※

Based on my assessment, the answers provided do not contain information relevant to the questions asked. Across all the answer sections, there are statements indicating that the article does not describe the techniques, methods, examples, data, insights, etc. that were asked about in the questions. 

Since the answers clearly state that the article does not cover the topics inquired about in the questions, I have concluded that the answers are not relevant to the questions. Therefore, I am stopping my review and responding with the single sentence indicating irrelevant answers as instructed.
