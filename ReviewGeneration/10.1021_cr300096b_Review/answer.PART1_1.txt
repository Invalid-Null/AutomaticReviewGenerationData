 Unfortunately, this literature does not provide any relevant information to answer the questions about propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts or supported metal catalysts. The literature is a review article focused on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and catalysts for applications including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, reforming, oxidation, and other reactions, but it does not discuss propane dehydrogenation specifically.
