 Here are the consistency percentages for each answer file compared to the correct answers:

```json

I carefully compared each answer file's responses to the correct answers provided and calculated consistency percentages based on semantic similarity. For most questions, the answer files stated that the literature did not contain relevant information, which matches the correct answers. The only exception is Question 3, where answer.PART3_4.txt fully matched the correct answer while the other files stated no relevant information was present.
