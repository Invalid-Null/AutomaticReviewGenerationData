<Answer>

 Unfortunately, the given literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the specific questions asked. The literature is a review article focused on Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, primarily for hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, reforming, and oxidation reactions. It does not contain any data or discussion related to propane dehydrogenation or the use of zeolite supports, which are specifically asked about in several of the questions. 

As the questions pertain to topics not covered in the provided literature, I cannot provide direct quotes or substantive answers from the given text. The questions appear more tailored to research studies on propane dehydrogenation catalysts and the effects of zeolite supports, rather than this general review on Pt alloy catalysis. I would need relevant literature containing experimental data and discussions focused on propane dehydrogenation and zeolite-supported catalysts in order to provide substantive responses. With only the current background review paper, I unfortunately cannot answer the specific questions posed.
