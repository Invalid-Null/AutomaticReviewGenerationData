[1] "Incipient wetness impregnation is the most commonly utilized method because of its ease in sample preparation."

[2] "Slurry synthesis method. This method is used for synthesizing catalysts with high metal loadings and/or supports with low surface areas." 

[3] "Colloidal synthesis. This method has the potential to synthesize supported catalysts with precise control over the size and composition of the bimetallic particles because the metallic colloid is prepared in the presence of a surfactant, which prevents the coalescence of small particles."

[4] "Core-Shell synthesis. Core-shell nanoparticle catalysts consist of a transition metal core covered with a 1-2 monolayer shell of another metal, such as Pt."

[5] "Reverse micelle synthesis. This method uses microemulsions to produce supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution."
