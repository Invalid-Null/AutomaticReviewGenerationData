I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Studies on Ptx SnyBimetallics in NaY. II. Further Characterization and Catalytic Properties in the Dehydrogenation and Hydrogenolysis of Propane
Abstract
CO adsorption and desorption, as studied by IR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry has been used to characterize PtNaY and PtxSnyNaY samples. The change observed between adsorbed CO spectra and CO TPD has been attributed to an increase of the particle sizes due to the addition of Sn to Pt. The catalytic properties of these materials were studied by using propane dehydrogenation and propane hydrogenolysis. The TOF of propene formation is nearly the same for all samples and the apparent activation energy remains unchanged, indicating that no change in the Pt dehydrogenation properties is induced by adding Sn. In contrast the hydrogenolysis properties are deeply depressed by alloying Pt to Sn, these changes being attributed to a dilution effect rather than to an electronic effect.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
