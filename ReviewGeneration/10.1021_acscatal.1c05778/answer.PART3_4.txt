<quotes>
[1] "The XANES spectra of the as-synthesized catalysts, Zn foil, and commercial ZnO are shown in Figure 4a. The latter two spectra are used as references for Zn-oxidation states of 0 and +2, respectively." 

[2] "The position of the absorption edge in the XANES spectra of all catalysts is about 9662 eV, which is similar to that of commercial ZnO. Thus, the oxidation state of Zn in all as-synthesized catalysts should be +2."

[3] "The FT k2-weighted EXAFS spectra are presented in Figure 4b (extracted EXAFS functions are given in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). The EXAFS fitting parameters are summarized in Table 2, while the fits are reported in Figure S8 in the Supporting Information."
