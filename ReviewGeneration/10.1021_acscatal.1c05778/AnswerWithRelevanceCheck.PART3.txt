      [1] Thus, ZnO and MgO should be highly dispersed. 
      [2] "ZnO-containing catalysts based on various supports such as Al2O3, SiO2, HZSM-5, dealuminated Beta, and silicalite-1 were also widely studied."
      [3] "To verify this hypothesis, the designed catalysts were characterized by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and temperature-programmed reduction with carbon monoxide (CO-TPR)."

    <English>
      Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses techniques like using a one-pot hydrothermal method to synthesize MgO-modified ZnOx/silicalite-1 materials with high dispersion, and synthesizing ZnO-containing catalysts based on various supports which are characterized by XAS, IR, XPS, XRD, and CO-TPR to study the dispersion.

      [1] The XANES spectra of the as-synthesized catalysts, Zn foil, and commercial ZnO are shown in Figure 4a. The latter two spectra are used as references for Zn-oxidation states of 0 and +2, respectively.  
      [2] The position of the absorption edge in the XANES spectra of all catalysts is about 9662 eV, which is similar to that of commercial ZnO. Thus, the oxidation state of Zn in all as-synthesized catalysts should be +2.
      [3] "The XANES spectra of the as-synthesized catalysts, Zn foil, and commercial ZnO are shown in Figure 4a. The latter two spectra are used as references for Zn-oxidation states of 0 and +2, respectively." 
      [4] "The position of the absorption edge in the XANES spectra of all catalysts is about 9662 eV, which is similar to that of commercial ZnO. Thus, the oxidation state of Zn in all as-synthesized catalysts should be +2."
      [5] "The FT k2-weighted EXAFS spectra are presented in Figure 4b (extracted EXAFS functions are given in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). The EXAFS fitting parameters are summarized in Table 2, while the fits are reported in Figure S8 in the Supporting Information."

    <English>
      Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques like XANES and EXAFS to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows XANES data demonstrating the Zn oxidation state is +2 in the as-synthesized catalysts compared to Zn and ZnO references. It also presents FT-EXAFS spectra and fitting results to analyze the local structure and coordination environment of Zn species.
