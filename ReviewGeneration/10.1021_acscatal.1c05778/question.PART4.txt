Controlling Reaction-Induced Loss of Active Sites in ZnOx/Silicalite-1 for Durable Nonoxidative Propane Dehydrogenation
Abstract
ZnO-based catalysts are promising for nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene owing to their low cost and environmental friendliness but experience serious loss of the active component because of the reduction of ZnO to metallic Zn that evaporates. Here, we demonstrate that MgO-modified ZnOx/silicalite-1 materials prepared through one-pot hydrothermal method are active, selective, and durable in the PDH reaction. The undesired loss of Zn could also be successfully suppressed without negative effect on the PDH performance owing to a strong interaction between Mg2+ and ZnOx, as concluded from the results of X-ray photoelectron and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic measurements as well as temperature-programmed reduction with CO. X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that atomically dispersed Zn2+ sites are responsible for PDH. Using an industrially relevant feed with 40 vol % propane, propene selectivity between 88 and 95% at propane conversion between 15 and 32% was achieved over six PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles lasting for about 20 h on stream at 550 C without loss in the initial activity, while some deactivation occurred after longer (up to about 60 h) time on stream. The deactivation (caused by Zn loss) constant of Mg-modified ZnOx/silicalite-1 considering the 2nd and 20th cycles is more than 3 times lower than that of its Mg-free counterpart.

ZnO is a multipurpose material used for the production of batteries, (1) pigments, (2) foods, (3) and even drugs. (4) It also can be used as a support or active component in heterogeneous catalysis, (57) for example, methanol synthesis (810) and steam-reforming of methanol (1113) as well as in photocatalysis. (1416) Owing to great developments in synthesis and characterization techniques, varieties of ZnO nanostructures have been synthesized, which are nanotubes, (17,18) nanobars, (19) nanosheets, (20) nanoflowers, (21,22) and even quantum dots. (23,24) They are, however, widely employed in low-temperature (<300 C) reactions since these nanostructures are prone to sintering at high temperatures. Moreover, ZnO can be reduced to metallic Zn at high temperatures in the presence of reducing agents. The metal melts at about 420 C leading to sintering of small Zn aggregates or their evaporation. Thus, the application potential of ZnO-containing materials could be strengthened when methods for stabilizing certain Zn-containing structures or for hindering ZnO reducibility to metallic Zn are established.
Propene, an important building block in the chemical industry, can be produced through both oxidative (ODP) and nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH). (25,26) The former one is usually carried out with an oxidizing agent that oxidizes not only propane to propene but also these hydrocarbons to carbon oxides. Consequently, the selectivity to propene is low at industrially relevant degrees of propane conversion. Due to these reasons, the ODP is still not commercialized, while the PDH is the basis of several large-scale technologies. (25,26) The present commercially applied Pt-based or Cr-based catalysts have shortcomings related to the high cost of platinum or toxicity of chromium(VI) compounds. To overcome these drawbacks, a multitude of alternative catalysts on the basis of oxides of Ga, (27,28) V, (2931) Zr, (3236) or Sn (37,38) have been developed and tested in the PDH reaction.
ZnO-containing catalysts based on various supports such as Al2O3, (39) SiO2, (40) HZSM-5, (41) dealuminated Beta, (42) and silicalite-1 (4345) were also widely studied. These catalysts show, however, industrially unattractive propene productivity due to either low propane conversion or low propene selectivity and were tested using industrially irrelevant reaction feeds. Furthermore, reduction of ZnO to metallic Zn under reaction conditions led to poor durability and irreversible deactivation of catalysts due to evaporation of the metal. (41,42) Very recently, (46) we have introduced a simple method for preparation of highly active and selective Zn-containing catalysts under industrially relevant conditions. The most active developed catalyst shows about 3 times higher propene productivity in comparison with an analogue of commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3. We merely use a physical mixture of bulk ZnO and silicalite-1(S-1) as a catalyst. Catalytically active binuclear ZnOx species are in situ formed through a reaction of metallic Zn atoms with OH nests upon reductive treatment or during the PDH reaction. Such species can, nevertheless, form metallic Zn that leaves the zeolite and reactor resulting in deactivation after about 250 h on propane stream. However, the active site and catalytic performance could be totally recovered by periodic addition of fresh ZnO on the top of the catalyst bed. Depositing a nitrogen-doped carbon layer on the S-1 support can help stabilize the ZnOx species owing to the strong interaction between Zn and N species in the carbon layer. (43) Unfortunately, the developed catalysts are not compatible with oxidative regeneration required for removal of coke deposits formed in the PDH reaction since the protective layer is oxidized. Thus, new approaches for stabilizing ZnOx species are highly needed.
Against the above background, the purpose of the present study was to provide a method for preparation of catalysts with improved thermal stability of ZnOx under reducing conditions of the PDH reaction. The idea behind our approach is the easy formation of stable ZnMgOx solid solutions due to similarity of the ionic radii of Mg2+ (0.72 Å) and Zn2+ (0.74 Å). (47,48) On this basis, we elucidated the potential of Mg modification of ZnOx/S-1. To verify this hypothesis, the designed catalysts were characterized by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and temperature-programmed reduction with carbon monoxide (CO-TPR). In contrast to major previous studies on the PDH reaction over Zn-containing catalysts, we determined catalyst activity, selectivity, and durability under industrially relevant conditions using a feed with 40 vol % propane as recommended in a recent review article.

Chemicals and Catalyst Preparation
Ludox colloidal silica (40 wt %, Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co., Ltd), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (25 wt %, TPAOH, Shanghai Cairui Chemical Engineering Technology Co., Ltd), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd), Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (Guangfu Chemical Reagent Co.), NH3·H2O (25 wt %, ROTH), and ethylenediamine (Guangfu Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) were used for catalyst preparation as received without any further purification.
ZnO/silicalite-1 samples were synthesized according to ref (49) but with some modifications. Briefly, desired amounts of deionized water (40.56 g), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and ethylenediamine were mixed at 35 C under continuous stirring. The molar ratio of ethylenediamine to Zn2+ was fixed to 3. After 30 min stirring, 36 g of colloidal silica was added to the above solution and stirred for additional 30 min. Then, 40.99 g of TPAOH was added to the obtained suspension at 35 C upon continuous stirring for aging for 6 h. Afterward, the suspension was placed in a stainless-steel autoclave with a polytetrafluoroethylene insert (200 mL) at 150 C for 3 days. The formed solid product was collected by filtration, washed with deionized water, and then dried at 100 C overnight and finally calcined at 550 C for 6 h to remove the structure-directing agent. The samples are denoted as xZnO/S-1, where x stands for the theoretical loading of zinc in the weight percentage. The actual zinc loading was determined by ICP, which is 2.0, 3.9, 5.6, and 5.9 wt % in 2ZnO/S-1, 4ZnO/S-1, 6ZnO/S-1, and 8ZnO/S-1, respectively (Table 1). Bare silicalite-1 (named as S-1) was synthesized according to the same procedure but without the addition of Zn source and ethylenediamine.

aZn loading in the spent materials was determined after 6 PDH/regeneration and 20 PDH/regeneration (in parentheses) cycles.
bAmounts of Zn and Mg were obtained by ICP.
The same method was also used for the preparation of a series of Mg-modified 6ZnO/S-1 samples. The required amounts of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were added into deionized water to achieve the molar ratio of Mg to Zn between 0.3 and 1.5. The amount of ethylenediamine was calculated according to the molar ratio of ethylenediamine to (Zn2+ + Mg2+) of 3. The remaining steps were the same as described above for the preparation of the ZnO/S-1 materials. The Mg-containing samples are denoted as 6ZnO/S-1(yMg), where y stands for the molar ratio of Mg to Zn in the initial gel. The actual molar ratio of Mg to Zn in the obtained samples is close to the nominal value (Table 1).
For comparative purposes, nonsupported Mg-doped ZnO (Mg2+/Zn2+ = 1:1) was also synthesized according to ref (50) but with some modifications. Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (5.00 g) and Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (4.31 g) were dissolved in 50 mL of H2O. Oxalic acid (3.59 g) was dissolved in 50 mL of H2O at 60 C. The pH value of Zn2+- and Mg2+-containing solutions was adjusted to the same pH value as that of the oxalic acid solution by adding 2 M HNO3. Both solutions were mixed under stirring, and the pH value was adjusted to 9 by adding 25 wt % aqueous ammonia solution at 60 C. The suspension was stirred at the same temperature for 1 h. The final catalyst was obtained after filtration, washing, drying and calcination at 550 C for 4 h.
Catalyst Characterization
Phase composition of as-prepared catalysts was determined by means of XRD measurements on an XPert Pro Theta/Theta diffractometer (Panalytical) with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA) in the 2θ range from 5 to 80. Peak positions and profile were fitted with the pseudo-Voigt function using the HighScore Plus software package (Panalytical). Phase identification was done by using the PDF-2 database of the International Center of Diffraction Data. The amorphous content was quantified according to the K-factor approach implemented in the HighScore Plus software package using NIST 676 Al2O3 as the external standard. (51) The crystallinity was calculated according to eq 1.

where wcrystalline and wamorphous stand for the weight fractions of crystalline and amorphous phases in each sample, respectively.
The electronic state of Zn in the catalysts was analyzed by XPS using a Thermo Fisher K-Alpha spectrometer. The electron binding energies (BEs) were obtained after referencing the C 1s core level of adventitious carbon at 284.6 eV.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of as-prepared samples were recorded on a Bruker VERTEX 70 spectrometer equipped with DLaTGS detector in the transmission mode. Each fresh sample was mixed with KBr with a weight ratio of 100(KBr):1(sample) and dried at 120 C overnight followed by pressing into a self-supported wafer. The background spectrum was recorded using pure KBr and automatically subtracted. All FTIR spectra were recorded by accumulating 16 scans at a resolution of 4 cm1.
The reducibility of ZnOx species was investigated by CO-TPR using an in-house developed setup containing eight individually heated continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactors. Before reduction, each sample (50 mg) was heated in a flow of Ar to 550 C followed by feeding air for 1 h and then cooling down to room temperature in air. The reduction was carried out in a flow of 1 vol % CO in Ar from room temperature to 900 C with a heating rate of 10 C/min. The CO (m/z = 28), CO2 (m/z = 44), and H2 (m/z = 2) signals were detected by an on-line mass spectrometer.
The amount of coke over the spent catalysts was determined by the temperature-programmed oxidation measurements with O2 (O2-TPO) using the same setup as applied for CO-TPR. Typically, 30 mg of each spent catalyst was loaded to a continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactor and flushed by Ar at room temperature for 30 min. The oxidation tests were carried out in a flow of 5 vol % O2 in Ar with a heating rate of 10 C/min from room temperature to 900 C. The rate for coke formation was also determined based on the total amount of carbon deposition on the catalyst.
X-ray absorption near-edge spectra and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (XANES and EXAFS) at the Zn K absorption edge were recorded at the P65 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg) in the transmission mode. The energy of the X-ray photons was selected by a Si(111) double-crystal monochromator, and the beam size was set by means of slits to 0.2 (vertical) × 1.5 (horizontal) mm2. The spectra were normalized, and the EXAFS background was subtracted using the ATHENA program from the IFFEFIT software package. (52) The k2-weighted EXAFS functions were Fourier transformed (FT) in the k range of 2.512.3 Å1. Then, the amplitude reduction factor S02 = 1.05 was obtained by fitting the ZnO reference spectrum to a wurtzite structural model as reported in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (collection code is 34477). The fits of the EXAFS data were performed using Artemis (52) by the least-squares method in R-space between 1.0 and 3.2 Å. The model with two shells from the wurtzite structure (ZnO and ZnZn) was used for the fits. However, to fit the second shell with physically meaningful values, it was necessary to increase the starting interatomic distance for this shell by ca. 0.2 Å relative to the distance found in the original ZnO model. Thus, only the first shell was considered here. Coordination numbers (CNs), interatomic distances, energy shift (δE0), and mean square deviation of interatomic distances (σ2) were refined during fitting. The absolute misfit between theory and experiment was expressed by ρ.
Catalytic Tests
Catalytic tests were performed using an in-house developed setup equipped with 15 fixed-bed quartz tubular reactors. Before testing, the as-synthesized catalysts were heated in N2 flow of 10 mL·min1 up to 550 C, and then they were treated in air followed by purging with N2 for 15 min. Afterward, N2 was replaced by a feed consisting of 40 vol % C3H8 in N2 with a total flow rate of 10 mL min1. To determine catalyst durability, that is, the ability to restore initial activity after oxidative regeneration, PDH/regeneration tests were carried out as follows. The catalysts were tested in the PDH reaction at 550 C for 2 h and then flushed with N2 for 15 min. Then, air was fed to the reactors with a flow of 10 mL min1 for 30 min at the same temperature. The oxidized catalysts were flushed with N2 for 15 min and tested again in the PDH reaction for 2 h. In total, 20 PDH/regeneration cycles or 6 PDH/regeneration cycles were carried out over 6ZnO/S-1 and 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) or 6ZnO/S-1(yMg) samples.
For determining the rate of propene formation, PDH tests with oxidatively or reductively treated catalysts were carried out at a degree of propane conversion below 10%. The catalysts (50 mg) were initially treated in N2 and air at 550 C as described above. Then, they were either directly used for PDH or reductively treated at 550 C in a flow of 50 vol % H2 in N2 for 1 h and then applied for PDH. The rate was determined at the same temperature with a feed containing 40 vol % C3H8 in N2 and a total flow rate of 40 mL min1. The rate of propene formation and turnover frequency (TOF) values of propene formation with respect to Zn were calculated according to eqs 2 and 3, respectively.

The feed components and reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890) equipped with flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors. The time taken for one analysis was 4 min. The gas chromatograph was equipped with PLOT/Q (for CO2), AL/S (for hydrocarbons), and Molsieve 5 (for H2, O2, N2, and CO) columns. Propane conversion, propene selectivity, yield, and carbon balance were calculated according to eqs 47, respectively.

The constant of catalyst deactivation due to Zn loss was calculated according to eq 8. This equation was adapted from a previous study. (53)

To exclude the effect of coke deposition on Zn-loss related deactivation, we used the initial conversion of propane in the 1st cycle (X(C3H8)1st) for 6ZnO/S-1, in the 2nd cycle (X(C3H8)2nd) for 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg), and in the 20th cycle (X(C3H8)20th) for both catalysts. The reason for choosing the second cycle for the MgO-containing sample is its activation behavior in the first cycle. t is the time on total propane stream, that is, 40 and 38 h for 6ZnO/S-1 and 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg), respectively.

General Characterization of ZnO-Based Catalysts
To determine the crystalline phases in the developed catalysts with or without MgO, X-ray powder diffraction analysis was applied. In all samples, no crystalline ZnO could be identified. Neither crystalline MgO nor mixed MgOZnO phases could be detected in MgO-containing samples. Thus, ZnO and MgO should be highly dispersed.
The only identified crystalline phases are related to the zeolite support. Bare S-1 is present in the monoclinic structure (Figure 1a). This structure changes to the MFI polymorph with increasing amounts of Zn-content in MgO-free samples, as clearly indicated by the changes of diffraction data in the 2θ range between 23 and 25 (Figure 1ac). Such changes could be caused by the presence of a foreign cation or a structure-directing agent, temperature, pressure, and so on. (54,55) The Zn-related structural changes in our samples should not be caused by the incorporation of Zn into the framework of the zeolite due to the following reasons. As reported in a previous study dealing with Mn-ZSM-5, the Bragg peaks in the 2θ range of 710 shift to lower values when manganese is inside of the framework. (56) If zinc were present in the framework of our catalysts, a similar shift should be expected because the ionic radii of Mn2+ and Zn2+ are larger than the ionic radius of Si4+. The Bragg peaks in the 2θ range of 710 in xZnO/S-1 samples remain at the same position as for S-1 (Figure 1b). Thus, ZnOx species should be on the surface, that is, in extra-framework positions.

(a) Wide-angle XRD patterns of S-1 and ZnO-containing samples; (b) magnified XRD patterns in the range of 2θ = 710; (c) magnified XRD patterns in the range of 2θ = 2225; (d) wide-angle XRD patterns of S-1 and Mg-free and -containing samples; (f) magnified XRD patterns in the range of 2θ = 710; (e) magnified XRD patterns in the range of 2θ = 2225.
The orthorhombic MFI structure also maintains in the MgO-containing samples when the molar ratio of Mg/Zn is in the range of 0.31.0. When the ratio increases to 1.5, the structure collapses to a larger extent (Figure 1d). Regardless of the crystallinity of these samples, the diffraction peaks indicate the presence of an orthorhombic MFI structure (Figure 1e,f). The structural collapse in the 6ZnO/S-1(1.5Mg) sample can be explained as follows. Due to the high amount of metal ions in the initial gel upon synthesis of S-1, the nucleation and crystalline processes were suppressed. (57) Hence, the crystallinity of the zeolites decreases with an increase in MgO loading (Figure 1d and Table 1).
The surface area of each sample was determined by means of N2 adsorptiondesorption measurements. Except for the 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) sample, the surface area of MgO-free and MgO-containing samples remains in the range of 340381 m2/g, where the area of the bare support is 363 m2/g (Table 1). Thus, small amounts of metal ions in the initial gel have no obvious effect on the surface area. When the ratio of Mg and Zn increases to 1.0, the surface area decreases significantly to 247 m2/g. This should be due to the low crystallinity of this sample (Table 1). Too high Mg loading is also detrimental for the surface area of micropores. It is 176 m2 g1 for 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) and in the range of 256314 m2 g1 for all the other materials.
Catalytic Performance
To check the effect of Zn loading in xZnO/S-1 on catalyst activity, the rate of propene formation was determined at 550 C. Both bare S-1 and commercial ZnO were also tested for comparative purposes. The bare support is totally inactive, while commercial ZnO shows some activity (the rate is below 0.1 mmol·g1·min1, Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). The activity of ZnOx/S-1 increases with Zn loading and reaches the highest value of 0.57 mmol·g1·min1 over 6ZnO/S-1 and then decreases to 0.34 mmol·g1·min1 over 8ZnO/S-1.
Based on the above screening test, a series of MgO-promoted 6ZnO/S-1 catalysts were prepared. The catalysts were tested for their activity in the PDH reaction after oxidative or reductive treatment. It is worth mentioning that in comparison with MgO-containing 6ZnO/S-1 catalysts, the unsupported MgO-doped ZnO catalyst shows significantly lower activity (about 0.08 mmol·g1·min1). Thus, bulk ZnOMg structure is inactive for PDH (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). To fairly compare MgO-free and MgO-containing catalysts based on S-1, the TOF value of propene formation was calculated based on the total amount of Zn in each sample according to eq 3 and is shown in Figure 2. For the oxidized catalysts, this value for the MgO-free catalyst is 0.0116 s1, while the counterparts with the molar ratio of MgO/ZnO of 0.3 and 0.5 possess the values of 0.0137 and 0.0142 s1, respectively. The corresponding values for the reduced catalysts are 0.011, 0.012, and 0.015 s1. The reduced 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) catalyst has a TOF value of 0.0141 s1. Based on these results, no correlation between the activity and MgO content could be established. Thus, we put forward that all Mg-containing 6ZnO/S-1 catalysts have the same ZnOx active sites, and the presence of Mg does not affect their intrinsic activity. Additionally, no relationship could be determined between the TOF values and catalyst microporosity. Therefore, the micropores should not affect the catalytic performance.
Figure 2
Figure 2. TOF values over 6ZnO/S-1(yMg) catalysts tested after oxidative (light gray bars) or reductive (dark gray bars) treatments. Reaction conditions: 550 C, catalyst amount of 50 mg, C3H8/N2 = 2:3, and total flow rate of 40 mL·min1.
The TOF value determined for the oxidatively treated 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) is about 3 times lower than that for its reductively treated counterpart. We suppose that Zn species in 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) need a reducing atmosphere to be activated. Such activation is common for catalysts based on metal oxides. (41,42) This assumption is supported by our results presented below.
The 6ZnO/S-1(yMg) catalysts were also tested in the PDH reaction for their durability at industrially relevant degrees of propane conversion. For their proper comparison, the contact time was selected to achieve about 30% initial propane conversion. The catalysts were oxidatively treated before the PDH reaction. Apart from 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg), which activates with rising time on propane stream in the first dehydrogenation cycle, all other catalysts deactivate (Figure 3). The deactivation should be due to coke formation. (43) Depending on MgO loading, the catalysts could recover their initial activity to a different extent after oxidative removal of coke. The strongest loss in the initial conversion of propane from the first cycle to the sixth cycle was determined for the 6ZnO/S-1 sample, and the corresponding conversion values are 29.6 and 22.2% (Figure 3a). According to our previous study, (43) there are two mechanisms of deactivation of ZnO-based catalysts. Besides the reaction-induced formation of coke, which is responsible for the decrease in the activity with time on propane stream, Zn loss under PDH conditions is another reason for the deactivation with rising number of dehydrogenation/regeneration stages. The latter statement is supported by the present ICP results (Table 1). The loading of Zn in the 6ZnO/S-1 catalyst decreased from 5.6 to 4.9 wt % after six dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles. Importantly, the loss of Zn was suppressed when 6ZnO/S-1 was promoted by MgO. The higher the loading of MgO, the less pronounced the Zn loss (Table 1).

Reaction conditions: 200 mg catalyst, 550 C, C3H8/N2 = 2:3, total flow rate of 10 mL·min1, and WHSV (propane) = 2.36 h1. Regeneration conditions: 550 C, 30 min, air flow (10 mL·min1).
The positive effect of MgO on ZnO stabilization is also reflected in the higher catalyst durability. As seen in Figure 3bd, the decrease in the initial propane conversion from cycle to cycle becomes less pronounced with an increase in MgO loading. The activity of 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) in the last five cycles is fully recovered after removal of coke deposits in an air flow at 550 C. Except for 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) in the first PDH cycle, other catalysts showed similar selectivity to propene and coke, which are in the range of 8895 and 310%, respectively (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). Higher propene selectivity (about 92%) and lower coke selectivity (about 4%) were obtained over the 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) sample in the first cycle in comparison with the other next cycles. This should be due to the lower conversion of propane. We also compared our catalysts with the state-of-the-art ZnO-based catalyst in terms of selectivity-conversion relationship for propene (Figure S4a in the Supporting Information). They show comparable propene selectivity at a similar degree of propane conversion with however a higher concentration of propane in the feed.
It is also worth mentioning that many state-of-the-art ZnO-based catalysts were not evaluated for their durability. (41,42,44,45,58,59) There are only two reports where such tests were carried out. (42,44) Znβ-10 and Zn-4@S-1 catalysts were tested in three PDH/regeneration cycles at 550 C or 600 C using, however, diluted reaction feeds with 10 or 5 vol % propane. For example, propane conversion over Znβ-10 and Zn-4@S-1 significantly dropped after two PDH/regeneration cycles from about 5138% (42) and from about 3023%, (44) respectively.
Our most promising 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) catalyst was benchmarked against an analogue of commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst in terms of propene productivity. The highest space time yield of C3H6 formation in each PDH cycle is shown in Figure S4b in the Supporting Information. The activity of K-CrOx/Al2O3 can be fully restored from cycle to cycle, while 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) deactivated to some extent. Nevertheless, 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) shows higher STY(C3H6) than K-CrOx/Al2O3.
To further demonstrate the effect of MgO on the durability of ZnO-based catalysts, the 6ZnO/S-1 and 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) catalysts were also tested in 20 PDH/regeneration cycles. The obtained conversion and selectivity values are shown in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information. When comparing the 1st and the 20th cycle, the conversion of propane over 6ZnO/S-1 or 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) decreases from 30.8 to 14.8% or from 26.1% (the initial conversion in 2nd cycle as it is the highest for this catalyst) to 20.9%. In addition, an apparent deactivation constant was calculated according to eq 8 for 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) and 6ZnO/S-1. The corresponding obtained values are 0.0076 and 0.0234 h1.
O2-TPO was carried out with spent catalysts (after six PDH/regeneration cycles) to check if and how the presence of MgO affects coke formation. The temperature of maximal rate of CO2 formation over all catalysts is well below 550 C, and the combustion process is completed below 600 C (Figure S6a). Taking these data into account and the fact that we used a feed with 20 vol % O2 upon catalyst regeneration, we can safely conclude that the coke formed in the PDH reaction is completely removed during the oxidative regeneration. The average rate of coke formation was calculated from the amount of CO2 formed in the O2-TPO tests (eq 9). This rate decreases with an increase in MgO loading (Figure S6b) probably due to the basic properties of MgO. Thus, the role of MgO promoter for ZnO/S-1 is twofold: (i) thermal stability of ZnOx species under reduction conditions is improved and (ii) coke formation is hindered.

Nature of Active ZnOx Sites
To derive an insight into the local structure of active ZnOx species participating in PDH, XAS was applied. The XANES spectra of the as-synthesized catalysts, Zn foil, and commercial ZnO are shown in Figure 4a. The latter two spectra are used as references for Zn-oxidation states of 0 and +2, respectively. The position of the absorption edge in the XANES spectra of all catalysts is about 9662 eV, which is similar to that of commercial ZnO. Thus, the oxidation state of Zn in all as-synthesized catalysts should be +2. However, there is a shoulder at about 9673 eV in the spectrum of 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg), indicating that the electronic structure of Zn is different from that in the Mg-free sample. No ZnZn scattering on Zn neighbors as in metallic Zn (2.3 Å) is found in all as-synthesized catalysts. Unlike commercial ZnO, the first-shell ZnO scattering at about 1.5 Å (uncorrected distance) dominates in the spectra of 6ZnO/S-1 and 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) samples, while the intensity of the second shell of ZnO is virtually invisible suggesting the presence of atomically dispersed Zn2+ in both samples.

dNote: CNs and distances in reference materials: Zn metal: CN1(ZnZn) = 6, r1(ZnZn) = 2.665 Å; CN2(ZnZn) = 6, r2(ZnZn) = 2.913 Å. Bulk ZnO: CN(ZnO) = 4, r(ZnO) = 1.970 Å; CN(ZnZn) = 6, r(ZnZn) = 3.213 Å; CN(ZnZn) = 6, r(ZnZn) = 3.250 Å.
Since the ZnZn distance and CN of Zn in 6ZnO/S-1 and 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) could not be perfectly fitted, we put forward that Zn2+ species exists in the form of a single site. EXAFS is especially sensitive to interatomic distances, and the significant difference here as well as the significantly higher disorder (Debye-Waller factor, σ2) strongly suggest the absence of binuclear Zn species for 6ZnO/S-1 and 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) samples. This difference between the EXAFS spectra of previously reported binuclear Zn sites and 6ZnO/S-1 and 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) is further illustrated in Figure S9 in the Supporting Information. In addition, the fitted CN of ZnO is 3 instead of 4, with the latter being typical for Zn2+ inside the framework of the zeolite. Thus, isolated ZnOx species should be located on the surface, in line with XRD results.
From a kinetic viewpoint, ZnOx single sites in 6ZnO/S-1 and 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) reveal about 56 times lower intrinsic activity expressed as Zn-related TOF in comparison with binuclear ZnOx in S-1 reported in ref (46); the TOF values are 0.011, 0.014, and 0.066 s1. This experimental result nicely supports our density functional theory calculations. (46)
Origins of the MgO Effect on Thermal Stability of ZnO
To explain why and how the presence of MgO affects the thermal stability of ZnO, we applied several techniques for characterizing the selected catalysts. The FTIR spectra of the 6ZnO/S-1 and 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) materials are shown in Figure 5a. The band located at about 450 cm1 is attributed to the ZnO stretching mode. (50) In comparison with the Mg-free sample, a blueshift (from about 450 cm1 to about 460 cm1) in the spectrum of 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) should be especially noted. From a fundamental point of view, there are many factors that can affect the vibrational frequencies in IR spectroscopy, for example, mass of the atoms, conjugate effect, or hydrogen bonding. For example, the vibrational frequencies are inversely proportional to the mass of the atoms according to Hookes law; in other words, the bonds between lighter atoms have higher vibrational frequencies. In our case, such a blueshift is mainly caused by the presence of Mg, which has lower relative atomic mass (24) than Zn (65). Thus, this result suggests that a ZnOMg bond is formed in the 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) sample. (50,60)

Figure 5. (a) FTIR spectra of 6ZnO/S-1 and 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg); (b) Zn 2p XP spectra of 6ZnO/S-1 and 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg).
Electronic properties of Zn in Mg-free and Mg-containing samples were also investigated by XPS. As seen in Figure 5b, there are two peaks at BEs of about 1022 and 1045 eV, which are attributed to Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2, respectively. (61,62) Compared to the 6ZnO/S-1 sample, the BEs of Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 in 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) are shifted to higher values from 1022.3 to 1022.6 eV and from 1045.4 to 1045.7 eV, respectively. The shift indicates that there should exist electronic interactions between Zn2+ and Mg2+. Thus, combining the IR and XPS data, we can safely conclude that Mg2+ and Zn2+ are in proximity and strongly interact with each other.
Further CO-TPR measurements were carried out to check the effect of MgO on the reducibility of ZnOx species. For comparative purposes, the reducibility of commercial ZnO was also studied. This metal oxide was oxidatively treated at either 550 or 800 C before the CO-TPR tests (Figure 6a,b). The high-temperature treatment was necessary to remove surface OH groups. According to ref (63), two different mechanisms are considered for CO reaction with metal oxides, that is, removal of OH groups or lattice oxygen (eqs 10 and 11). When ZnO was oxidatively treated at 550 C and subsequently used for CO-TPR, CO consumption occurred in two temperature regions with the maximal rates at about 400 C and above 600 C. The low-temperature consumption of CO is accompanied by the formation of CO2 and H2 (Figure 6a). No H2 is observed in the high-temperature region. This product is also not found in CO-TPR of ZnO treated oxidatively at 800 C (Figure 6b). Based on these experimental observations and mechanistic concepts of CO reaction with metal oxides (eqs 10 and 11), the low-temperature CO consumption in Figure 6a should be related to the removal of OH groups by CO, while the lattice oxygen of ZnO reacts with CO above 600 C.

The CO, CO2, and H2 profiles recorded in CO-TPR tests with 6ZnO/S-1 and 6ZnO/S-1(yMg) are shown in Figures 6c,d and S10 in the Supporting Information, respectively. MgO is not expected to be reduced under the conditions applied in our study. Thus, all CO consumption should be attributed to the reduction of ZnOx species. It is obvious from Figure 6c that the temperature of maximal CO consumption rate (Tmax) is shifted to higher temperature with an increase in MgO loading. The corresponding value for 6ZnO/S-1, 6ZnO/S-1(0.3Mg), 6ZnO/S-1(0.5Mg), and 6ZnO/S-1(1.0Mg) is 655, 698, 709 and 792 C, respectively. H2 could be observed in CO-TPR measurements (Figure S10 in the Supporting Information). This indicates that OH groups probably connected to Zn2+ were removed by CO. Unlike the CO2 signal (Figure 6d), the intensity of the H2 signal decreases when the reduction temperature increases further (Figure S10 in the Supporting Information). Therefore, we put forward that both reduction mechanisms are valid for 6ZnO/S-1 and Mg-promoted 6ZnO/S-1 samples, and the continuous formation CO2 should be attributed to the removal of oxygen coordinated with Zn atoms (Figure 6d). Based on these results, we can conclude that promotion of ZnO/S-1 with MgO inhibits reduction of ZnOx during PDH reaction due to the strong interaction between ZnO and MgO.
Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The usage of magnesium as a promoter in the one-pot synthesis of Mg-modified Zn2+/silicalite-1 enables stabilization of Zn2+ against its reduction to metallic Zn0, with the latter being responsible for the undesired loss of this metal under reducing conditions at high temperatures. The stabilization effect relates to an increase in the strength of the ZnO bond. Moreover, the method is also suitable for generation of atomically dispersed ZnOx species even at a metal loading of about 6 wt %. Such species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Owing to the structural stabilization of such species, catalyst durability in the PDH reaction is improved in comparison to Mg-free samples without changes in the activity and propene selectivity. The obtained results highlight the importance of controlling the structure and local surrounding of highly dispersed ZnOx species for designing active and stable ZnO-based catalysts for nonoxidative hydrocarbon conversion under industrially relevant conditions.
