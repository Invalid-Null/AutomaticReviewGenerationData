To generate the consistency ratios, I compared the answers provided in each answer file to the correct answers. I determined whether the key points were covered in each answer, and calculated a percentage to represent the consistency. The XML structure organizes the ratios by question and links each ratio back to the specific answer file. Let me know if you have any other questions!
