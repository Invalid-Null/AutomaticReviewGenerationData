 Here is the JSON structure comparing the consistency of the answer files with the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%", 
    "answer3.txt": "100%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%", 
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "3": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "4": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "5": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "6": {
    "answer0.txt": "50%",
    "answer1.txt": "50%",
    "answer2.txt": "100%",
    "answer3.txt": "0%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "7": {
    "answer0.txt": "0%",
    "answer1.txt": "100%",  
    "answer2.txt": "0%",
    "answer3.txt": "100%",
    "answer4.txt": "100%"
  }
}
```

I carefully compared the quotes and answers provided in each file to the correct answers to calculate the consistency ratios. For questions where the answer files provided no relevant information, I marked those as 0% consistent. For answers that fully matched the correct answer, I marked 100% consistency. Partial matches were marked with 50% consistency. The JSON structure summarizes the consistency ratios for each question and answer file pairing.
