[1] "Indeed, we also found that the structure I can catalyze CH bond rupture on CH4 with a mere 0.22 eV barrier (Figure S12)." 

[2] "In order to gain an insightful understanding of the structureperformance relationships of vanadium oxides, the electronic structures of the model catalysts were analyzed."

[3] "The extraordinary CH bond rupture ability of monomeric vanadium oxide (structure I) results from the high surface oxygen activity in that the p-band center of surface oxygens (VO and VOAl) over structure I are very close to the Fermi level indicating the good electrons affinity."

[4] "Interestingly, when the terminal oxygen is gone, the chemical environment of vanadium can change, which may lead to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated vanadium atoms."

7. Yes, the article describes computational work identifying descriptors that correlate catalyst properties to propane dehydrogenation performance. For example, it found that monomeric vanadium oxide structure I can catalyze CH bond rupture on methane with a 0.22 eV barrier, revealing its activity. Electronic structure analysis provided insights into structure-activity relationships, finding the p-band center of oxygen correlates with activity. The formation of coordinatively unsaturated V atoms when terminal oxygen is lost was also found to impact activity.
