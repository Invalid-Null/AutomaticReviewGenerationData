To generate this XML, I carefully compared each answer file's answers to the correct answers for each question. I calculated a consistency percentage based on how closely the answers matched. For questions 1-3 and 5-7, all answer files were fully consistent with 100% match to the correct answers. For question 4, some files matched 80% while others matched 100%, based on the level of detail provided. This XML structure organizes the comparisons for each question and rates the consistency per answer file.
