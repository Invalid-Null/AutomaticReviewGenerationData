<quotes>
[1] "The GC-online experiments were conducted in order to study the change of product distribution over time on stream."

[2] "We conducted the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis and we found a continuous phase variation from V2O5 phase to V2O3 phase due to the induction by lattice evolution under propane stream."

[3] "In order to probe the structural changes of vanadium oxides, the evolution process of 1 V-Al2O3 and 6 V-Al2O3 samples under C3H8 atmosphere was studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)."
