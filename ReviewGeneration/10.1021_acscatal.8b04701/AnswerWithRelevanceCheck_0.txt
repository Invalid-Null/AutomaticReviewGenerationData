         [1] "We conducted the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis and we found a continuous phase variation from V2O5 phase to V2O3 phase due to the induction by lattice evolution under propane stream."

         [2] "According to previous studies, the band at 2040 cm-1 is attributed to VO of the vanadium oxides. It was found that over both 1 V-Al2O3 sample and 6 V-Al2O3 sample, the negative band is observed at 2040 cm-1 upon reduction by C3H8, indicating that the VO bond was consumed."

         [3] "In order to probe the structural changes of vanadium oxides, the evolution process of 1 V-Al2O3 and 6 V-Al2O3 samples under C3H8 atmosphere was studied by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)."

         [4] "The GC-online experiments were conducted in order to study the change of product distribution over time on stream."

         Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ XRD, DRIFTS, and GC to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. XRD showed phase changes from V2O5 to V2O3 under propane flow. DRIFTS revealed changes in VO species during propane exposure. GC provided insights into product distribution over time.
