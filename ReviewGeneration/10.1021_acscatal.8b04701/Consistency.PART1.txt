 Here is the comparative analysis of the answer files:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART1_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "0%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_1.txt": "60%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "80%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "80%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART1_0.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_1.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "0%"},
  "5": {"answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I manually compared each answer file's response for each question to the correct answer provided and estimated a percentage consistency. 100% indicates complete consistency with the correct answer, while 0% means completely inconsistent or irrelevant.
