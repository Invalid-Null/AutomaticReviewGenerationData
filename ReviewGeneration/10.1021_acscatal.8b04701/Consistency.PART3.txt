 Here is the JSON structure with the consistency ratios for each question and answer file:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",  
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "2": {
    "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"
  },
  "3": {

    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "0%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"

    "answer.PART3_1.txt": "50%",
    "answer.PART3_2.txt": "25%",
    "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%",
    "answer.PART3_4.txt": "50%"
  },
  "5": {

  }
}
```

To generate this, I compared each answer file's response for a given question to the correct answer provided. I calculated a consistency percentage based on how much of the key information from the correct answer was contained in the answer file's response. This was a manual assessment, but aimed to provide a quantitative measure of consistency.
