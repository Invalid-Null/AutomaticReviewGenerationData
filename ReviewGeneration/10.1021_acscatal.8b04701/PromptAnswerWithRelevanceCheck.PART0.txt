[1] "Indeed, we also found that the structure I can catalyze CH bond rupture on CH4 with a mere 0.22 eV barrier (Figure S12)." 

[2] "In order to gain an insightful understanding of the structureperformance relationships of vanadium oxides, the electronic structures of the model catalysts were analyzed."

[3] "The extraordinary CH bond rupture ability of monomeric vanadium oxide (structure I) results from the high surface oxygen activity in that the p-band center of surface oxygens (VO and VOAl) over structure I are very close to the Fermi level indicating the good electrons affinity."

[4] "Interestingly, when the terminal oxygen is gone, the chemical environment of vanadium can change, which may lead to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated vanadium atoms."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

7. Yes, the article describes computational work identifying descriptors that correlate catalyst properties to propane dehydrogenation performance. For example, it found that monomeric vanadium oxide structure I can catalyze CH bond rupture on methane with a 0.22 eV barrier, revealing its activity. Electronic structure analysis provided insights into structure-activity relationships, finding the p-band center of oxygen correlates with activity. The formation of coordinatively unsaturated V atoms when terminal oxygen is lost was also found to impact activity.
