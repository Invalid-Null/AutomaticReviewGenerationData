[1] "With the variance of vanadium loading, the degree of polymerization (e.g., monomeric, polymeric and crystalline vanadium oxides species) can greatly changed."

[2] "Herein, we considered three kinds of vanadium oxide models: monomer, dimer, and V2O5(001) slab, representing the monomeric, polymeric, and crystalline vanadium oxides, respectively."

[3] "In terms of the monomeric vanadium oxides, i.e., structure I (Figure 5a), both AlOV and VO sites are highly active for the first CH bond activation with the energy barrier less than 0.15 eV." 

[4] "In terms of the dimeric vanadium oxides (structure III), the first dehydrogenation barrier of C3H8 is around 1.5 eV, much higher than the monomeric case."

[5] "A similar circumstance occurred on crystalline vanadium oxide (structure V), as we can see in Figure 5c: the relative energy of the transition state of C3H6* formation (on both VO site and VOV site) is higher than that of CH3CO*CH3 formation on the VO site."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over monomeric, polymeric, and crystalline vanadium oxide catalysts. It evaluates monomer, dimer, and crystalline V2O5 slab models. The monomeric model shows low barriers (<0.15 eV) for initial CH bond activation on AlOV and VO sites. The dimeric model has higher barriers (~1.5 eV) for initial dehydrogenation. On crystalline V2O5, CH3CO*CH3 formation is easier than C3H6* formation, especially on VO sites.

[2] "In summary, we have systematically investigated the structureperformance relationships of different polymerizations of the vanadium oxides (namely, monomer, dimer, and crystalline structures) in propane dehydrogenation reactions using DFT calculations in conjunction with experimental studies."

[3] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported vanadium oxides, the propane dehydrogenation reaction can be divided into two periods: the initial ODH dominant period and the subsequent PDH dominant period." 

[4] "The VO of all three structures (I, III, IV) contributes to the H2O and CH3CO*CH3 formation and takes the dominant role in the ODH dominant period."

[5] "With the loss of VO, PDH commence to take the dominant place." 

[6] "Over monomeric vanadium oxide (structure II), AlOV is active."

Answer: The article proposes a mechanistic scenario where propane dehydrogenation occurs in two steps over supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The initial ODH dominant period involves VO sites contributing to H2O and CH3CO*CH3 formation. After VO is lost, PDH becomes dominant, with AlOV sites active for monomeric VOx, AlOV and unsaturated V sites active for dimeric VOx, and O3 sites active for crystalline VOx.
