[1] "Electronic structure analysis illustrates that surface oxygen with p-band center adjacent to Fermi level and unsaturated vanadium atoms are active sites for CH bond breakage."
[2] "In terms of the monomeric vanadium oxides, i.e., structure I (Figure 5a), both AlOV and VO sites are highly active for the first CH bond activation with the energy barrier less than 0.15 eV."
[3] "The extraordinary CH bond rupture ability of monomeric vanadium oxide (structure I) results from the high surface oxygen activity in that the p-band center of surface oxygens (VO and VOAl) over structure I are very close to the Fermi level indicating the good electrons affinity."

<English>
Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states and oxygen mobility affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows the p-band center of surface oxygen correlates with CH bond activation barriers, with oxygen closer to Fermi level being more active. It also shows monomeric VOx with high oxygen mobility is much more active than polymeric VOx.

是的,文章研究了调节氧化态和氧原子迁移性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。文章展示了表面氧的p带中心与CH键活化能垒相关,Fermi能级附近的氧原子活性更高。文章还展示了氧原子迁移性高的单体VOx的活性远高于聚合VOx。

[1] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported vanadium oxides, the propane dehydrogenation reaction can be divided into two periods: the initial ODH dominant period and the subsequent PDH dominant period."
[2] "The VO of all three structures (I, III, IV) contributes to the H2O and CH3CO*CH3 formation and takes the dominant role in the ODH dominant period." 
[3] "With the loss of VO, PDH commence to take the dominant place. Over monomeric vanadium oxide (structure II), AlOV is active. Over dimeric vanadium oxide (structure IV), the AlOV and coordinatively unsaturated vanadium atom are active sites."
</Quotes>
<English>
Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied VOx catalysts. It describes initial ODH period with VO as active site, and subsequent PDH period with AlOV and unsaturated V sites as active after VO is lost. It also describes key steps like CH3COCH3 formation and VO removal.
</English>
<Chinese>
是的,文章提出了在所研究的VOx催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机理场景。文章描述了初始的ODH期,这时VO是活性中心,以及VO脱落后的后续PDH期,这时AlOV和不饱和的V位点变得活跃。文章还描述了如CH3COCH3的形成和VO的脱落等关键步骤。

<English>
Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects by using alumina-supported VOx catalysts. It shows VOAl sites at metal-support interface are active for propane dehydrogenation after initial VO loss.
</English>  
<Chinese>
是的,文章通过使用氧化铝支持的VOx催化剂来探索金属-支持体界面效应。文章展示了在初始VO脱落后,金属-支持体界面处的VOAl位点对丙烷脱氢活性很高。
