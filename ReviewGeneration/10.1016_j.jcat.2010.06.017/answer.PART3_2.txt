[1] "Pt nanoparticles were dispersed onto the calcined support via grafting."

[2] "The dispersion of Pt on Mg(Ga)(Al)O tended to decrease with increasing Ga/Pt ratio from about 78% to 52%, corresponding to an increase in average Pt particle size from 1.5 to 2.2 nm."  

[3] "The observed decrease in Pt dispersion with increasing Ga/Pt ratio is very likely due to the decrease in the concentration of Al cations at the surface of the support, which have been observed to facilitate the dispersion of Pt."

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It examines the effect of the Ga/Pt ratio on the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on the Mg(Ga)(Al)O support. The article finds that increasing the Ga/Pt ratio leads to a decrease in Pt dispersion from 78% to 52% and an increase in Pt particle size from 1.5 nm to 2.2 nm. This is attributed to a decrease in Al concentration at the support surface with higher Ga content, where Al helps anchor and disperse the Pt nanoparticles.

答:是的,这篇文章研究了目标优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它检验了Ga/Pt的比率对Mg(Ga)(Al)O支持体上Pt纳米粒子分散度的影响。文章发现Ga/Pt比率的增加导致Pt分散度从78%下降到52%,Pt粒子大小从1.5 nm增加到2.2 nm。这是由于Ga含量更高时支持体表面上的Al浓度下降,而Al有助于锚定和分散Pt纳米粒子。

Answer: No, the article does not utilize any in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It focuses on ex-situ characterization of model PtGa/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts not applied specifically for propane dehydrogenation. No in-situ data under propane dehydrogenation conditions are presented.

[1] "A TEM image of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 is shown in Fig. 5. After calcination, the support still exhibited a layered structure, similar to that seen earlier for Mg(Al)O [55]. Small Pt particles about 12 nm in diameter are also seen."

[2] "Additional evidence for the formation of PtGa alloys was obtained from EDX analysis of the samples."  

</quotes>

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in the catalysts. It uses TEM to image the layered structure of the Mg(Ga)(Al)O support and show dispersed ~1-2 nm Pt nanoparticles (Fig. 5). It also uses scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to analyze the bulk and surface composition of individual Pt nanoparticles, revealing variations in Ga content that indicate PtGa alloy formation.

Answer: No, the article does not use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It focuses on catalyst synthesis and characterization rather than evaluating catalytic performance or changes under propane dehydrogenation conditions. No propane dehydrogenation data or in-situ X-ray measurements are presented.
