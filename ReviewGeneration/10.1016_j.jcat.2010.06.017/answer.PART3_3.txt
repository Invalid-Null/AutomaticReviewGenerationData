<quotes>
[1] "A novel approach is described for preparing Ga-promoted Pt particles for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes. The modifying element, Ga, was introduced by transference from the support, a calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O hydrotalcite-like material." 

[2] "Pt nanoparticles were dispersed onto the calcined support via grafting."

[3] "The dispersion of the Pt particles on calcined hydrotalcite-like supports, determined by H2 chemisorption, is presented in Table 2."

[4] "The observed decrease in Pt dispersion with increasing Ga/Pt ratio is very likely due to the decrease in the concentration of Al cations at the surface of the support, which have been observed to facilitate the dispersion of Pt [54]."

[5] "A TEM image of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 is shown in Fig. 5. After calcination, the support still exhibited a layered structure, similar to that seen earlier for Mg(Al)O [55]. Small Pt particles about 12 nm in diameter are also seen."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes a novel approach for preparing Ga-promoted Pt particles on a hydrotalcite-derived support. Methods like grafting Pt nanoparticles onto the calcined support and characterizing dispersion via H2 chemisorption are discussed. Decreasing Pt dispersion with higher Ga content is attributed to lower Al concentration that helps anchor Pt. TEM imaging also reveals small 1-2 nm Pt particles on the supports.

答:是的,该文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它描述了一种新方法,用于在水滑石衍生支持体上制备Ga掺杂的Pt颗粒。文中讨论了像Pt纳米颗粒嫁接到煅烧支持体和通过H2化学吸附表征分散度等方法。随着Ga含量的增加,Pt分散度的降低归因于低的Al含量,Al有助于锚定Pt。TEM成像也显示了支持体上1-2 nm的小Pt颗粒。

[1] "Lattice images of these small particles can be seen in the high-resolution micrograph shown as an inset in Fig. 5."

[2] "Additional evidence for the formation of PtGa alloys was obtained from EDX analysis of the samples."  

[3] "EDX was conducted on larger particles of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 and of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12 after reduction at 723 K and 873 K."

Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like TEM and STEM-EDX to characterize metal-support interfaces in the hydrotalcite-supported catalysts. High resolution TEM reveals lattice fringes of small metal nanoparticles. EDX line scanning quantifies Ga incorporation into Pt particles after different reduction treatments, confirming PtGa alloy formation.
