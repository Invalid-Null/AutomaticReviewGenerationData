[1] "Pt nanoparticles were dispersed onto the calcined support via grafting." 

[2] "The dispersion of the Pt particles on calcined hydrotalcite-like supports, determined by H2 chemisorption, is presented in Table 2."

[3] "The observed decrease in Pt dispersion with increasing Ga/Pt ratio is very likely due to the decrease in the concentration of Al cations at the surface of the support, which have been observed to facilitate the dispersion of Pt."

[4] "Evidence for the interactions of Ga with Pt was obtained from EXAFS."

[5] "Therefore, we propose that during the reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O at elevated temperatures, H atoms formed on the surface of Pt particles spill over onto the support and initiate the reduction of Ga3+ cation to Ga atoms, which then interact with the supported Pt nanoparticles to GaPt alloys."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses grafting to disperse Pt nanoparticles onto the calcined hydrotalcite-like support (Quote 1). It measures Pt dispersion by H2 chemisorption (Quote 2) and finds that dispersion decreases with increasing Ga content, likely due to decreasing Al concentration which helps anchor Pt (Quote 3). Interactions between Ga and Pt are probed by EXAFS (Quote 4). The proposed mechanism involves H spillover from Pt particles reducing Ga cations to Ga atoms, which then form GaPt alloys (Quote 5).

答:是的,本文研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它使用移植法将Pt纳米粒子分散在煅烧后的水滑石类载体上(引文1)。它通过H2化学吸附测量Pt分散度(引文2),并发现随着Ga含量的增加,分散度降低,这可能是由于帮助固定Pt的Al浓度的降低(引文3)。用EXAFS探究了Ga与Pt之间的相互作用(引文4)。提出的机理涉及Pt颗粒上的H原子外溢到载体上,将Ga阳离子还原为Ga原子,后者然后形成GaPt合金(引文5)。
