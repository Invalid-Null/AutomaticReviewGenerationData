<quotes>

[1] "The dispersion of Pt on Mg(Ga)(Al)O tended to decrease with increasing Ga/Pt ratio from about 78% to 52%, corresponding to an increase in average Pt particle size from 1.5 to 2.2 nm. The observed decrease in Pt dispersion with increasing Ga/Pt ratio is very likely due to the decrease in the concentration of Al cations at the surface of the support, which have been observed to facilitate the dispersion of Pt"

[2] "Evidence for the interactions of Ga with Pt was obtained from EXAFS." 

[3] "After reduction at 723 K, majority of the platinum is present in Pt and PtOx particles ranging in size from 1.4 to 2.2 nm."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

6. The article investigates how the Ga/Pt ratio affects Pt particle size and dispersion, showing that increasing Ga/Pt ratio decreases Pt dispersion from 78% to 52% and increases particle size from 1.5 nm to 2.2 nm on average. This effect is attributed to decreasing Al concentration, which helps anchor Pt particles. EXAFS data provides evidence for Pt-Ga interactions. After 723 K reduction, Pt particles of 1.4-2.2 nm exist as metallic Pt and PtOx.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  

6.本文研究Ga/Pt比如何影响Pt颗粒大小和分散度,结果显示Ga/Pt比的增加会使Pt分散度从78%下降到52%,平均颗粒大小从1.5 nm增加到2.2 nm。这种效应归因于Al浓度的降低,Al有助于锚定Pt颗粒。 EXAFS数据证明了Pt-Ga的相互作用。在723 K还原后,1.4-2.2 nm的Pt颗粒以金属Pt和PtOx存在。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "Therefore, we propose that during the reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O at elevated temperatures, H atoms formed on the surface of Pt particles spill over onto the support and initiate the reduction of Ga3+ cation to Ga atoms, which then interact with the supported Pt nanoparticles to GaPt alloys."  

[2] "A portion of the Ga3+ cations near the surface are reduced to Ga atoms by H atoms spilled over from the supported Pt particles, leading to the formation of PtGa alloys ranging in Ga/Pt ratio from 0.1 to 1.1."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

7. The article proposes that during high temperature reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, H atoms from Pt particle surfaces spill onto the support and reduce Ga3+ cations to Ga atoms, which then diffuse back and alloy with supported Pt nanoparticles to form PtGa alloys with 0.1-1.1 Ga/Pt ratios.

</English version answer>  

<Chinese version answer>  

7. 本文提出,在高温还原Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O期间,来自Pt颗粒表面的H原子溢出到载体上,并将Ga3+阳离子还原为Ga原子,然后这些Ga原子回扩散并与载体上的Pt纳米颗粒形成Ga/Pt比为0.1-1.1的PtGa合金。
