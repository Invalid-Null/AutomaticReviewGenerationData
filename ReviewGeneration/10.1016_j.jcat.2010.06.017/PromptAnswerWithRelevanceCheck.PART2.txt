[1] "The means by which the promoting element interacts with Pt and influences its catalytic properties are best understood for Sn."
[2] "EXAFS [7], [8], [9], Mossbauer [10], [11], [12], and TEM [13], [14], [15] studies of supported SnPt catalysts suggest that Sn forms a variety of bimetallic alloys, which enhance the dissociative adsorption of the reacting alkane and attenuate the adsorption of the product alkene"
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Ga in the Pt-Ga bimetallic catalyst. As stated in Quote [1], the interactions between the promoting element (Sn or Ga) and Pt influence the catalytic properties.
