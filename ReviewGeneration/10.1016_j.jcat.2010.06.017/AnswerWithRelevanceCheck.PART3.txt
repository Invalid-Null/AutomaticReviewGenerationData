         [1] "Pt nanoparticles were dispersed onto the calcined support via grafting." 
         [2] "The dispersion of Pt on Mg(Ga)(Al)O tended to decrease with increasing Ga/Pt ratio from about 78% to 52%, corresponding to an increase in average Pt particle size from 1.5 to 2.2 nm."
         [3] "The observed decrease in Pt dispersion with increasing Ga/Pt ratio is very likely due to the decrease in the concentration of Al cations at the surface of the support, which have been observed to facilitate the dispersion of Pt."

      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It disperses Pt nanoparticles onto the Mg(Ga)(Al)O support by grafting. It is found that the Pt dispersion decreases and particle size increases with increasing Ga/Pt ratio, likely due to fewer Al cations on the surface that help anchor the Pt.

         是的,该文探究了目标于优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它通过接枝的方式将Pt纳米粒子分散到Mg(Ga)(Al)O载体上。发现随着Ga/Pt比的增加,Pt分散度降低而粒子大小增大,这可能是因为表面促进Pt扩散的Al阳离子更少的原因。

        [1] "Additional evidence for the formation of PtGa alloys was obtained from EDX analysis of the samples."   
        [2] "Fig. 11, Fig. 12 show the distribution of Ga/Pt ratios for of the metal particles characterized by EDX after reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 and Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12 at 723 K." 
        [3] "In this case, Fig. 11, Fig. 12 show that the Ga/Pt ratio of the Pt particles rises to between 0.1 and 0.59 for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 and between 0.1 and 1.09 for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12."

     <English>  
        Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in the Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts. It uses STEM-EDX analysis to obtain evidence for PtGa alloy formation and determine the distribution of Ga/Pt ratios in the metal particles after different reduction temperatures. This provides insights into the migration of Ga from the support to the Pt to form alloys.
