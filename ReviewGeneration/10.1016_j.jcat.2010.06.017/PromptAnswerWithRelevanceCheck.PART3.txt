[1] "Pt nanoparticles were dispersed onto the calcined support via grafting."

[2] "The dispersion of Pt on Mg(Ga)(Al)O tended to decrease with increasing Ga/Pt ratio from about 78% to 52%, corresponding to an increase in average Pt particle size from 1.5 to 2.2 nm."

[1] "Pt nanoparticles were dispersed onto the calcined support via grafting." 

[2] "The dispersion of the Pt particles on calcined hydrotalcite-like supports, determined by H2 chemisorption, is presented in Table 2."

[3] "The observed decrease in Pt dispersion with increasing Ga/Pt ratio is very likely due to the decrease in the concentration of Al cations at the surface of the support, which have been observed to facilitate the dispersion of Pt."

[4] "Evidence for the interactions of Ga with Pt was obtained from EXAFS."

[5] "Therefore, we propose that during the reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O at elevated temperatures, H atoms formed on the surface of Pt particles spill over onto the support and initiate the reduction of Ga3+ cation to Ga atoms, which then interact with the supported Pt nanoparticles to GaPt alloys."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses grafting to disperse Pt nanoparticles onto the calcined hydrotalcite-like support (Quote 1). It measures Pt dispersion by H2 chemisorption (Quote 2) and finds that dispersion decreases with increasing Ga content, likely due to decreasing Al concentration which helps anchor Pt (Quote 3). Interactions between Ga and Pt are probed by EXAFS (Quote 4). The proposed mechanism involves H spillover from Pt particles reducing Ga cations to Ga atoms, which then form GaPt alloys (Quote 5).

<English version answer>

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It examines the effect of the Ga/Pt ratio on the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on the Mg(Ga)(Al)O support. The article finds that increasing the Ga/Pt ratio leads to a decrease in Pt dispersion from 78% to 52% and an increase in Pt particle size from 1.5 nm to 2.2 nm. This is attributed to a decrease in Al concentration at the support surface with higher Ga content, where Al helps anchor and disperse the Pt nanoparticles.

答:是的,这篇文章研究了目标优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它检验了Ga/Pt的比率对Mg(Ga)(Al)O支持体上Pt纳米粒子分散度的影响。文章发现Ga/Pt比率的增加导致Pt分散度从78%下降到52%,Pt粒子大小从1.5 nm增加到2.2 nm。这是由于Ga含量更高时支持体表面上的Al浓度下降,而Al有助于锚定和分散Pt纳米粒子。
