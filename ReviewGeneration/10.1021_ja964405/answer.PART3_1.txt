 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature to answer any of the questions asked. The article discusses the surface organometallic chemistry on metals through the formation of a stable Sn(n-C4H9) fragment as a precursor of surface alloy obtained by stepwise hydrogenolysis of Sn(n-C4H9)4 on a platinum particle supported on silica. It does not discuss techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports, metal encapsulation in zeolite supports, catalyst preparation methods for optimizing active phase dispersion, in-situ characterization of propane dehydrogenation catalysts, advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces, X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis, or evaluation of different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.
