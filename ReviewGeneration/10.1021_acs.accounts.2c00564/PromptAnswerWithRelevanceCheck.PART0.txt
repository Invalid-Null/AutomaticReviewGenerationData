<Answer>

 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that directly answer the specific questions asked. The literature focuses on the synthesis and characterization of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) based nanomaterials for catalysis applications, but does not provide substantial details on propane dehydrogenation mechanisms, kinetics, thermodynamics, computational studies, microkinetic modeling, or structure-activity relationships.

 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that directly address the questions asked. The literature focuses on engineering nanostructured interfaces of hexagonal boron nitride-based materials for enhanced catalysis, but does not discuss propane dehydrogenation specifically. As the questions are about propane dehydrogenation catalysts and mechanisms, I cannot provide substantive quotes or answers from this unrelated literature. Please provide scientific literature focused on propane dehydrogenation catalysts and mechanisms in order to obtain relevant quotes and answers.
