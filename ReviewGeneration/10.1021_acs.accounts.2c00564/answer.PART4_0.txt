 Thank you for the detailed instructions and example. Unfortunately, I did not find any relevant quotes or information in the given scientific literature to directly answer the list of questions provided. The article discusses the engineering of hexagonal boron nitride-based materials for enhanced catalysis applications, but does not mention propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since the questions are not related to the content of the literature, my response is as follows:
