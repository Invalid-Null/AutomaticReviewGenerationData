 Unfortunately this literature does not provide sufficient information to directly answer the questions asked. It focuses on describing experimental methods and results related to studying different gallium oxide nanoparticle catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide broader background or context about propane dehydrogenation catalysis research and applications. Since there are no relevant quotes from the literature, I will respond "No relevant quotes" for each question.
